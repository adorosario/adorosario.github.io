"really a great pleasure to welcome"
"michael to as our"
"very first inaugural distinguished"
"lecturer for our new school of"
"biomedical engineering at the university"
"of sydney"
"uh michael's uh as you can see there"
"from the allen discovery center at tufts"
"um in boston"
"and uh he's very well known for the"
"discovery of xenobots"
"which are described as living robots"
"that are made from frog skin cells that"
"can sense their own environment and as"
"an engineer i think it's amazing that"
"this discovery was simulated first and"
"then and then"
"you built"
"that's that's how we really like to do"
"things in engineering and a great uh use"
of
"biology synthetic biology"
uh
so
michael's
"got a great treat for us and i'd like to"
"welcome him to to start his presentation"
"thank you michael"
"thank you so much and uh yeah i'm very"
"honored to be able to share some"
"thoughts with all of you um if anybody"
"is interested in getting in touch with"
"me later on you can find all the primary"
"papers and everything else at these"
websites
"what i'd really like to talk about is"
"cognition and how minds can exist in the"
"physical world i want to make sure"
"however that it doesn't just stay at the"
"level of philosophy and uh what i'm"
"going to do in this talk is something a"
"little unusual i'm going to"
mix
"and sort of jump back and forth between"
"some of the conceptual theory that we've"
"developed around that uh that idea and"
"uh practical applications because in our"
"group these form a very tight feedback"
"loop where we develop theory and then"
"actually actually test these in the lab"
"in biomedical context so i'm going to go"
"back and forth between some some fairly"
"philosophical subjects and some very"
"practical regenerative medicine"
approaches
"so uh i think that everyone will"
"recognize who this is this is um alan"
"turing and we know him as uh the one of"
"the forefathers of artificial"
intelligence
"he was very interested in uh what minds"
"are and how we can create uh novel minds"
"um actually we of course we already"
"create minds all the time those would be"
"children um but but this is what dan"
"dennett calls competence without"
"comprehension right and and uh alan"
"turing wanted us to have comprehension"
"about creating novel minds you know to"
"understand how it works"
"now what you may not know is that he was"
"also very interested in morphogenesis"
"the idea of shape arising from the"
"interaction of biological cells now"
"that's kind of curious one might wonder"
"why it is that a computer scientist"
"would be interested in this in this"
"problem and i think that uh"
"in keeping with with how profound the"
"rest of his work is i think he"
"understood something very clearly"
"and i think if he had lived longer we"
"probably would be further along in uh"
"regenerative medicine because he saw"
"that these are fundamentally the same"
"problem and i think uh that actually is"
"is quite true and i'm going to talk"
"about that today one important thing for"
"us all to remember and to be humble"
"about is that um we all used to be"
"single cells so this is a lacrimaria"
"this is one one cell there's no brain"
"there's no nervous system there's no"
"cell to cell communication this animal"
"is doing things that uh if you're into"
"soft robotics or engineering or anything"
"else uh who should make us very jealous"
"we have nothing remotely of this"
competency
"and what it's able to do is handle all"
"of its goals at the single cell level so"
"it's physiological metabolic uh more"
"morphological behavioral goals"
"everything everything is handled and"
"during uh the process of embryonic"
"development we all make the journey"
"across what's called the cartesian cut"
"we start life as a single cell that many"
"molecular biologists would see as a"
"molecular network it's what people call"
"just physics and uh and then very slowly"
"over the period of many months and then"
"years we transition into a creature"
"that's going to make claims about its"
"consciousness and it's uh you know sort"
"of first-person perspective and and so"
"on we all we all make this journey from"
"from physics to cognition that's kind of"
"amazing i should say uh although we"
"don't have the time to get into this now"
"that that even at the lowest level for"
"example the level of these gene"
"regulatory networks we found that there"
"are and other people have as well at"
"least six different kinds of memory um"
"learning basically that can be done in"
"molecular networks so actually maybe"
"there's not even a zero on this on this"
"kind of continuum at all even at the"
"beginning there may be some some"
"cognition but certainly"
"we need to understand uh what kind of uh"
"what kind of cognition is possible in"
"what system and one of the things that"
"i've been working on is a framework that"
"uh has uh at its core this idea of the"
"axis of persuadability so the idea is"
"that with any system be it evolved"
"designed or combinations and we'll talk"
"about this"
"one gains a practical"
"advantage meaning meaning the most"
"amount of control for the least amount"
"of effort by understanding where on the"
"scale your system lies and it may be"
"something very simple that you can only"
"deal with in terms of hardware rewiring"
"it may be something a little better such"
"as a thermostat that actually has an"
"encoded goal state and you can change"
"the goal without having to rewire the"
"machine maybe it's better than that and"
"you can provide rewards and punishments"
"without knowing anything about how it"
"works which humans have done for you"
"know thousands of years or maybe it's"
"really complex and in that case you may"
"communicate not even with with uh"
"training but actually with with with"
"reasons and at some point you know"
"something like this we're going to have"
um
"you know ways to to to repair uh various"
"artifacts that we make and the best way"
"to repair them is going to be to"
"understand why they're upset and things"
"like this so so this is this is a kind"
"of scale the idea is then that we can't"
"assume where things lie on the scale"
"that's very important we have to do"
"experiments and so the main points of"
"what i'm going to do uh tell you about"
"today are basically these uh all"
"intelligence is collective intelligence"
"it's not just for um ant colonies and"
"bees and things like this we are all"
"made of parts and in fact biology uses a"
"kind of multi-scale competency"
"architecture which i'll explain as a set"
"of nested problem solvers each of which"
"work in diverse problem spaces"
"i'm going to argue that uh the the"
"really useful invariant for recognizing"
"creating and actually relating to uh"
"unconventional agents uh is uh is their"
"degree of goal directedness and this"
"leads to a very specific model of the"
"cognitive boundary for scaling of mind"
"from very simple agents to highly"
"complex ones i'm going to spend most of"
"the time talking about anatomical"
"control as an example i'm going to show"
"you an unconventional"
"collective intelligence made of cells"
"that operate in anatomical space or"
"amorphous space and i'm going to tell"
"you that uh the medium of this"
"unconventional intelligence is"
"our electrical networks they're a kind"
"of proto-cognitive"
"of brain function and there are huge"
"opportunities here for biomedicine"
"because we're going to be able to"
"complement these kind of uh current"
"hardware focused approaches and in the"
"end i'm going to talk about how"
"synthetic bioengineering provides uh an"
"incredibly large option space for new"
"bodies and new minds that don't have"
"standard evolutionary backstories and so"
"this raises many many uh interesting"
"questions for for evolution for medicine"
"and even ethics so the goal of my"
"framework is to be able to uh relate to"
"truly diverse intelligences the idea is"
"that not only the kinds of things we're"
"familiar with um but but also really"
"really unusual creatures colonial"
"organisms swarms creatures that are made"
"anew that that have never existed on"
"earth before uh ones that may exist only"
"in software or in some sort of uh"
"engineering uh embodiment"
"and and perhaps at some point um off of"
"off of the n equals one example on on"
"earth may we may encounter life"
"somewhere else so we need to be able to"
"uh understand what all of these things"
"have in common and we need to do it in a"
"way that is not restrictive but rather"
"moves work forward moves experiments"
"forward towards new capabilities so i'm"
"going to do that in four in four parts"
"first um i want to remind us of some"
"facts that we may not uh"
"may not remember"
"and um"
"talk about talk about the importance of"
"thinking about continua"
"instead of discrete discrete kinds of"
"creatures and i'm going to introduce"
"this notion of multi-scale competency"
"then we're going to look at examples"
"specifically of morphogenesis as a"
"collective intelligence and"
"bioelectricity as a kind of cognitive"
"glue that binds this this holds it"
"together well we'll come back then to"
"some of the uh kind of theoretical uh"
"aspects of the framework that we need to"
"have to be able to explain uh how this"
"all works and then at the end i'll"
"introduce you to some novel organisms"
"that have never existed on earth before"
"so this is um"
"this is a famous uh painting of adam"
"naming the animals in the garden of eden"
"and this kind of view has been with us"
"for a long time because uh when people"
"often think about these kinds of"
"problems they will talk about a human"
"brain or a rat or you know some other"
"kind of object as if as if this was a a"
"natural kind you know a discrete"
"category and and we're going to uh we're"
"going to work to break that down a"
"little bit the first thing i want to"
"point out is that uh"
"cognitive subjects uh change during"
"their lifetime and so so here you see a"
"soft-bodied kind of creature that has to"
"crawl around and chew leaves it must"
"become a flying hard-bodied creature"
"that drinks nectar during this process"
"of course the brain has to be different"
"so the brain during metamorphosis is"
"basically liquefied most of the cells"
"die all the connections are broken it"
"rebuilds an entire new brain so while"
"people often think philosophically"
"what's it like to be a caterpillar"
"what's it like to be a butterfly"
"what's it like to be a caterpillar"
"turning into a butterfly right this this"
"kind of uh severe remodeling makes um uh"
"you know the stresses of of of going"
"through puberty as a as a child uh makes"
"that seem just you know just minor uh"
"this is you know this is an uh an"
"embodied mind uh changing drastically"
"uh in real time you know this is not"
"just um uh evolutionary time scales so"
"and and you can read about and and by"
"the way one of the most interesting"
"things is that memories that a"
caterpillar
"acquires during its lifetime are still"
"present in the butterfly so despite the"
"fact that and you can read about"
"examples of that here despite the fact"
"that the brain the medium of this memory"
"uh is is taken apart and rebuilt the"
"memories remain this is actually uh"
"it goes even further in a creature we"
"call planarian flatworms so we'll we'll"
"hear much more about this today"
"um these guys have the amazing property"
"that they can be cut into pieces the"
"record is something like 276 pieces"
"every piece uh can it knows exactly what"
"a correct planarian looks like they"
"regenerate whatever is missing and now"
"you have multiple little worms"
"mcconnell james mcconnell in the 60s"
"discovered this and was very"
"controversial but we've repeated it in"
"our lab it actually does work you can"
"train these animals on a particular"
"memory you can cut off their heads"
"including their brain the tails will sit"
"there doing nothing for about eight days"
"they they regrow a new brain as the new"
"they regrow a new brain and begin"
"behavior you can test them and discover"
"that in fact they remember the original"
"information so we have here is this is"
"this fact that information moves through"
"the body uh we have this linkage between"
"information of function meaning learning"
"and memory uh tied very closely to"
"information about structure about the"
"shape and the growth and form"
"and then you know if uh if if you've"
"taken philosophy 101 and talked about uh"
"this kind of malfunctioning uh"
"transporter right that instead of"
"transporting you to another planet it"
"simply makes a copy and forgets to get"
"rid of the original and now you've got"
"two identical individuals with the same"
"memories how many people are there"
"planaria do this all day long every day"
"so you can cut planario in fact they cut"
"themselves into pieces and then uh you"
"know now you have you know all kinds of"
"interesting questions about personal"
"identity and so on so"
"what's what's interesting about biology"
"is that uh of course there are many"
"levels of organization so molecular"
"cellular tissue organ and swarm and so"
on
"but it's not just structural it's not"
"just that we're made of of parts that"
"are made of parts every uh piece of"
"every every level in biology has"
"competency meaning that it solves"
"problems in various spaces that might be"
"anatomical amorphous space it might be"
"transcriptional space the space of all"
"possible gene expressions space of"
"physiological states and of course"
"three-dimensional behavior and what"
"evolution does is use some of the same"
"tricks in all these different spaces and"
"all of these different levels cooperate"
"and compete with each other to"
"accomplish their various goals so this"
"becomes very important so so here's a"
"here's a simple example"
"this is a tadpole of the frog xenopus"
"lavish here is the brain here are some"
"nostrils uh the gut is down here and"
"this is the tail now you're going to"
"notice something very strange about this"
"tadpole here's where you would expect"
"the eyes to be there are no eyes here"
"we've engineered it to instead have an"
"eye on its tail okay now the this animal"
"for for for a very long time has evolved"
"for the brain to expect visual input"
"from two specific locations into the"
"optic tectum uh"
"we can we can create these animals it"
"turns out they can see perfectly well so"
"we built this machine to train them for"
"visual um learning so you things like"
"stay out of a blue of a moving blue spot"
"and things like that"
"um they can they can see quite well the"
"and so so what you see here is this"
"incredible competency of the eye"
"primordium it finds itself sitting next"
"to muscle instead of brain no problem it"
"still knows how to make an eye then the"
"optic nerve comes out it needs to"
"connect somewhere oftentimes it'll find"
"the uh the spinal cord and connect to"
"the spinal cord and the animal can still"
"see so you can see what uh what an"
"incredible uh feature of of uh for"
"evolutionary uh"
uh
"you know evolutionary change and"
"efficiency it is when you can depend on"
"your parts to do their job even when"
"things change so so this"
"goal-directedness uh"
"of incompetency of the lower levels"
"buffers the negative consequence of"
"mutations it means you can explore all"
"kinds of things because as your as your"
"organs move around and things change"
"they can still perhaps get their job"
"done right so this is this is very"
important
"now as we think about these parts we"
"realize now that because of uh"
"chimeric technologies and bioengineering"
"all of the parts are swappable so all"
"the way from molecular components all"
"the way up to the creatures of a hive"
colony
"you can swap any piece of this out for"
"uh other objects whether it be evolved"
"material or something something"
"engineered like a nano material or a"
"smart chip or something like that it's"
"somewhere along this scale right it"
"could be evolved it could be designed or"
"some mix thereof it could be a very"
"simple thing passive it could be a very"
"intelligent machine you can you can now"
"swap all these things and so now we"
"realize that you really can't"
"rely on old categories in terms of what"
"something looks like and what part of"
"the evolutionary tree it comes from to"
"understand or estimate their"
"intelligence or their agency we already"
"have all kinds of high cyborgs and"
"hybrids and"
"all sorts of combinations that that"
"never existed before and so in in this"
"this idea that there's this there's this"
"massive uh tree of possible living"
"beings we need to find an invariant we"
"need to find something that they all"
"have in common something that we can use"
"as a parameter to organize them to"
"compare them with each other uh"
"regardless of what they're made of oh"
"how they got here now this was already"
"already back in the 1940s"
"uh you know rosenbluth weiner and"
"bigelow were already thinking about this"
"they wrote a really nice paper where"
"they proposed this this idea the um the"
"scale for all of these creatures whether"
"they be machines the artificial machines"
"or natural machines"
"evolved organisms"
"they would be somewhere on this scale"
"where the invariant is goal directedness"
"in the cybernetic sense not in the"
"mystical you know sort of sense but but"
"but in the cybernetic notion"
"okay and so what i want to do now is uh"
"go over some examples with you about uh"
"what what this what this means in"
"biology okay what what goal directedness"
"looks like and in order to do that we"
"have to ask some very basic questions"
"that a lot of times we we gloss over in"
"teaching developmental biology and"
"things like that"
"uh where do anatomies come from so this"
"is a cross-section of a human torso you"
"can see this remarkable"
"complexity in fact invariant complexity"
"in all normal humans all the different"
"organs tissue structures everything is"
"in the right place the right or"
"orientation relative to each other"
"simply amazing and of course it starts"
"off as this it's a ball of early"
"embryonic blastomere somehow it has to"
"do this where is this information okay"
"how do they know what to build now a lot"
"you might be tempted to say dna in the"
"genome but we can read genomes now and"
"we know that none of this is directly in"
"the genome genomes specify proteins they"
"specify the micro hardware of every cell"
so
"lots of questions how do cells know what"
"to build and when to stop um if but part"
"of this is missing or damaged what"
"actually do we need to do to convince"
"these cells to rebuild exactly what was"
"there they did it once why can't they do"
"it again and as engineers and we'll get"
"back to this at the end of the talk how"
"far can we push this could we get the"
"exact same cells to build something"
"completely different than their genomic"
"defaults okay and so"
"so we need to really understand this so"
"uh you can imagine why this problem is"
"so important because let's let's think"
"about the endgame of region of medicine"
"what what what do you want in the end"
"you want something that's that we can"
"call the anatomical compiler meaning"
"that uh if if somebody should be able to"
"sit down in front of the computer and"
"draw the anatomy of the animal or plant"
"that we want not the molecular pathways"
"but actually what we care about which is"
"the anatomy right so you draw this thing"
"and if we knew what we were doing the"
"software would compile that down into a"
"set of stimuli that would have to be"
"given to individual cells to get them to"
"build whatever this is why do we want"
"such a such a thing because with the"
"exception of infectious disease all"
"problems in biomedicine so birth defects"
"traumatic injury cancer aging"
"degenerative disease all of this would"
"be completely solved if we knew how to"
"tell cells what to build okay um and so"
"so this is this is central to all of"
"medicine and yet we are nowhere near"
"being able to do this why is that"
"we've had so much progress in genomics"
"and stem cell biology why can we not"
"build this well um let's ask a simple"
"question here is um here's a baby"
"axolotl a salamander they have legs okay"
"uh a flog frog larvae do not have legs"
"so tadpoles don't have legs i"
"am we're in the process of making a frog"
"a lottle okay this is real these things"
"are quite viable so you take some cells"
"from an axolotl embryo combine them with"
"cells from a frog embryo and you've got"
"this chimeric frogalottle embryo now you"
"have the axolotl genome you have the"
"frog genome a simple question are"
"froglottel is going to have legs or not"
"and if they do have legs will those legs"
"be made only of axolotl cells or of frog"
cells
"we have no models in biology that can"
"give us an answer to this other than try"
"it and see what happens okay even though"
"you have full access to the genomes and"
"in fact it's actually even worse even"
"without making um"
"these chimeras just from being given a"
"genome you have no idea what the size"
"shape symmetry type of the organism is"
"going to be you can compare it with"
"other genomes that you already know but"
"that's cheating so so the idea is that"
"we we understand uh quite a bit about"
"the mechanisms that are required for"
"cells to accomplish certain certain"
"things so all these molecular pathways"
"we're really good at this we're a very"
"long way away from uh control of"
"large-scale form and function in"
"particular what we need to understand is"
"how do cellular collectives know what to"
"do in particular in novel circumstances"
"and i'm going to suggest that's a kind"
"of intelligence and"
"modern modern molecular medicine has"
"been operating largely at this level"
"everything today is uh"
"you know very exciting"
"with respect to um uh stem cell biology"
"genomic editing crispr protein pathways"
"protein engineering it's"
"all of the focus is on the molecular"
"hardware of life we still really do not"
"understand the software and yet we know"
"we know how much computer science and uh"
"information technology benefited when we"
"moved from programming computers this"
"way to to exploiting software properties"
so
"um i want to uh talk a little bit about"
"um intelligence and william james gave a"
"really interesting uh definition of"
"intelligence which is uh the ability to"
"uh reach the same goal by different"
"means and there are two interesting"
"things here one is that it focuses on"
"goal directed activity and i think that"
"emphasis is exactly right and it's this"
"uh it emphasizes this this flexibility"
"the idea is that uh you to to in"
"proportion to how intelligent we can say"
"that a system is it has the ability to"
"overcome novelty perturbations things"
"like that"
"to still reach their goals i'm going to"
"show you some examples"
"i told you that embryonic development is"
"a very reliable which is which is"
"fantastic but it isn't hardwired so if i"
"take an early mammalian embryo i cut it"
"in half i don't get two half embryos"
"which is what would happen if you cut"
"any of our technology in half you get"
"perfectly normal monozygotic twins each"
"side knows what's missing"
"rebuilds now you got two creatures"
amazing
"uh it gets even it gets even more"
"interesting this is the lumen of a"
"kidney tubule in a in a newt"
"and uh normally they're made of you know"
"let's say eight to ten cells working"
"together to make this structure one"
"thing you can do is uh force the cells"
"to be bigger and bigger okay and if you"
"make bigger cells the animal remains the"
"same size it's just that fewer cells now"
"participate in this that's already"
"interesting it's an adjustment here's"
"the real kicker if you make the cells"
"gigantic just one cell will bend around"
"itself and give you the exact same lumen"
"now what's interesting about that and"
"this is this work this is not our work"
"this has been known since the 40s"
"what's interesting about that is that"
"this is a completely different molecular"
"mechanism this is cytoskeletal bending"
"this is cell to cell communication so"
"different molecular components are being"
"called up in an entirely novel situation"
"to implement the same high-level"
"anatomical goal state okay"
"this is the ability to get to the same"
"goal despite perturbations not only"
"perturbations of the environment such as"
"injury but actually changes in in the"
"parts that you have to work with that"
"you know we don't have anything remotely"
"able to do something like this okay now"
"in addition to development there's a"
"more general capacity which is"
"regeneration so this is a an axolotl"
"these these guys regenerate their limbs"
"their eyes their jaws"
"their spinal cords portions of the brain"
"and heart and if you cut the cut off the"
"limb you can cut it at any level it will"
"grow exactly what it needs uh to be a"
"perfectly correct salamander arm so you"
"can see that now it gets to the same"
"goal from different starting positions"
"the most amazing thing about this"
"process is that it stops"
"when does it stop it stops when the"
"correct salamander target morphology for"
"that arm has been complete so that we"
"that that's you know that's the stop"
"condition for this computation it"
"actually has to know what a correct"
"salamander arm is by the way"
"regeneration is not just for so-called"
"lower animals"
"the human liver regenerates even the"
"ancient greeks knew that how they knew"
"that i have no idea it's actually a very"
"interesting question"
"deer regenerate their antlers every year"
"up to a centimeter and a half of new"
"growth per day when these when this bone"
"and nerve and everything else is going"
"and in fact human children um regenerate"
"their fingertips below a certain age if"
"they have a clean amputation without"
"sewing over the skin they'll just"
regenerate
"okay so to continue this this theme of"
"of same goal by different means this is"
"this is the collective intelligence of"
"cellular groups working out some"
"interesting problems this one of the"
"things that they can do is reach the"
"same goal in novel paths through"
"morphospace so this is a frog this is a"
"frog leg frogs unlike salamanders do not"
"normally regenerate their leg but we can"
"we can make them do that i'll talk more"
"about that momentarily if we induce that"
"what you see here is that the legs"
"regenerate eventually you get a very a"
"very nice looking leg however the"
"intermediate steps don't look anything"
"like the developmental path that limbs"
"take in order to form in fact they look"
"much more like a plant you've got the"
"central stalk you've got these these"
"toes coming off the sides you got a"
"toenail and yet they come to the same"
"spot afterwards so uh this this this"
"collective intelligence is able to"
"navigate more for space through in a new"
"in a new path and this really takes off"
"in this example where we discovered this"
"a couple years ago this is a tadpole of"
"course here the eyes the brain uh the"
"mouth um in order to become a frog"
"tattles have to"
"rearrange their face so the so the jaws"
"have to come out the eyes have to move"
"forward everything has to move and it"
"was thought prior to this it was thought"
"that what the genome specifies is is a"
"kind of machine that has a"
"you know every part moves in the right"
"direction the right amount and you go"
"from a standard tadpole to a standard"
"from so what we did was we wanted to"
"look for some intelligence in this"
"process what we did was we made"
"so-called picasso tadpoles everything is"
"in the wrong place the mouth is off to"
"the side the eyes on top of the head"
"everything is off to the you know"
"everything's in the wrong place"
"amazingly they give rise to pretty"
"normal frogs because all of this stuff"
"is going to move around in novel"
"unnatural paths in fact sometimes they"
"go too far and have to come back a"
"little bit"
"and then it all stops when they reach a"
"correct frog phase so what the genetics"
"actually gives you is a machine that is"
"able to execute an error minimization"
"scheme okay it's able to reduce the the"
"delta between whatever the shape is now"
"and the correct state and it will do so"
despite
"uh various uh the unusual starting"
"conditions and so on that raises all"
"kinds of interesting questions so um in"
"my group what we've been doing is uh to"
"the this this here is the uh sort of"
"typical um"
"paradigm view of developmental biology"
"that uh it's a feed forward open loop"
"kind of process that which you have here"
"is gene regulatory networks the genes"
"will turn each other on and off there"
"will be some proteins that do things"
"they're sticky or they diffuse or they"
"do exert force and they do something and"
"this highly parallel physics will"
"through the process this this magical"
"process of emergence uh when you have"
"lots of very simple rules being followed"
"in high um you know in parallel and high"
"numbers there will be an emergent"
"complexity symmetry breaking all of that"
"and then you get this this wonderful"
"outcome and all of that is true that all"
"of that does happen but it's it's not"
"the complete story"
"because we now know that when you"
deviate
"the system from its correct target"
"morphology with injury with um"
"with with with uh mutations with"
teratogens
"feedback loops will kick in uh either at"
"the level of physics or uh or or"
genetics
"that will try to get back to where it's"
"supposed to be now of course feedback"
"loops are nothing new in biology"
"everybody understands feedback loops but"
"there's a couple of interesting twists"
"on it here the first thing is that and"
"and so and so by the way what this is is"
"it's it's a basic homeostatic cycle it's"
"it's pattern homeostasis right like you"
"have in your thermostat"
"um the twists are several fold one is"
"that we understand feedback loops but we"
"usually think of single numbers scalars"
"like like uh ph temperature hunger level"
"right in this case the set point for"
"this process uh is a a fairly complex"
"state it's a it's a coarse grained"
"representation of geometry so so that's"
"that's kind of interesting and unusual"
"the other unusual thing about it is that"
"we are not used to thinking about"
"biology working towards goals you're"
"supposed to sort of try to reflect we're"
"all taught to try to reframe our our"
"uh our uh explanations to be kind of"
"emergent from low level rules but of"
course
"cybernetics and control theory give us"
"ways to think about this that isn't"
"magical so so that that's okay um"
"so so having this hypothesis we"
"it makes a very strong prediction the"
"prediction is this uh"
"if this is true if if the animal has in"
"some way a represented set point the way"
"that all homeostatic systems have to"
"then if we were able to find that set"
"point meaning how is it encoded we were"
"able to decode it and we were able to"
"rewrite it then we should be able to"
"overcome an important limitation in"
"medicine the problem here is this if you"
"want to make changes here at the system"
"level and you believe that everything"
"percolates up from from this level"
"you've got a terrible inverse problem to"
"solve how do we make changes down here"
"to to have specific outcomes here with"
"the exception of low hanging fruit like"
"single gene diseases it's it's uh it's"
"entirely um"
"likely that that crispr technologies"
"genome editing all of that is going to"
"reach a ceiling uh because because it's"
"completely unknown what it is that you"
"would change here to modify the shape of"
"somebody's limb to give back an eye"
"these kinds of things"
"if if this is true then you can do what"
"you do with a thermostat which is that"
"you can change the set point you don't"
"have to rewire the thermostat in fact"
"you don't even know you don't even need"
"to know how the whole thing works what"
"you do need to know is where the set"
"point is and how to change it so so"
"could this could this really be true and"
"we started thinking about this years ago"
"and for inspiration we turned to uh the"
"first system that the the one system"
"that very obviously in biology"
uncontroversially
"stores goals and pursues them and that"
"is the brain so in the brain"
"the system works roughly like this you"
"have some hardware the hardware consists"
"of a network of cells every cell has"
"these little ion channels they uh send"
"ions in and out and basically allow a"
"voltage uh potential to form across the"
"membrane and that voltage potential may"
"or may not propagate to their neighbors"
"through these um uh these these these"
"electrical synapses known as gap"
"junctions selectively so so that so"
"that's the hardware and the commitment"
"of neuroscience is this idea that the"
"electrical activity going on in this"
"network and you're seeing this this is a"
"lovely movie that someone made of a"
"zebrafish uh brain this is electrical"
"activity in a living zebrafish brain the"
"idea is that that is the medium in which"
"the cognitive uh uh content of that mind"
"is stored whether it be a human or a"
"zebrafish uh if we knew how to decode it"
"you would have access to the memories"
"the preferences the goals everything"
"else that belongs to this mind right so"
"so by reading the electrical"
"pattern you literally have access to the"
"uh the information content of that mind"
"from from a cognitive perspective now"
"what's uh what's interesting is um"
"actually that um"
"uh every every cell in the body does"
"this so it turns out that every cell in"
"your body has ion channels most of them"
"have gap junctions with their neighbors"
"they all make electrical networks and we"
"can do something very similar to the"
"idea of neural decoding in neuroscience"
"and we can try to decode what it is that"
"the rest of your body tissues are"
"thinking about they're not thinking"
"about three-dimensional behavior i'll"
"show you in a minute what they are"
"thinking about this is a companion to"
this
"to this video this is a"
"this is not a model this is a real real"
"data this is a voltage-sensitive"
"fluorescent dye uh this is a movie of an"
"early frog embryo"
"created by my colleague danny adams"
"where you can actually see"
where
"uh all the electrical states are as"
"these cells uh try to figure out who's"
"gonna be anterior posterior left right"
"and so on and so the parallelism between"
um
"between the nervous system and"
"electrical activity outside which we"
"call developmental bioelectricity is"
"extremely strong so whereas"
"the electrical activity of your brain is"
"used to control your muscles to move"
"your body through three-dimensional"
"space the exact same kind of activity"
"only slower of the rest of your body"
networks
"are used to control your cells to move"
"the configuration of your body in more"
"for space okay everything else holds"
"it's it's a very similar system now we"
"shouldn't be surprised about this"
"because if we ask where did neurons come"
"from we find out that of course they"
"didn't just sort of appear out of"
nowhere
"they especially they speed optimized"
"things that pre-neural cells have been"
"doing for a really long time before"
"brains and nervous systems came on the"
"scene evolution figured out that"
"bioelectricity was a great way to"
"process information"
"around the time of bacterial biofilms"
"it's an ancient thing and and and you"
"can read read more about that so so"
"developmental bioelectricity is the"
"precursor to uh to the kind of cognition"
"that people study in neuroscience"
"now what we did was we created some"
tools
"to allow us to uh to uh to read and"
"write the uh the the thoughts of the"
"body basically the information content"
"that was present in somatic networks uh"
"that that we were that we were testing"
"this this hypothesis that it had"
"something to do with controlling"
"morphogenesis so so first uh were with"
"this we applied this dye technology that"
"just allows us to take measurements and"
"see where all the electrical states are"
"as a function of time and so this is a"
"time lapse video we do a lot of"
"computational modeling to understand"
"given the various channel and pump genes"
"why do they give rise to these specific"
"patterns and i'm going to show you um"
"some interesting patterns"
"this for example is an early frog embryo"
"putting its face together again time"
"lapse and so you'll see here this is"
"this is a grayscale the same voltage die"
"uh all kinds of things going on here's"
"one frame out of that movie and i'm"
"showing you this example among many"
"others because here's the most obvious"
"we can see this in the easiest way which"
"you know neuroscientists should be"
"jealous because because the patterns in"
"the brain are not this easy to decode"
"and of course most of our patterns are"
"not either this is this is an example uh"
"that that happens to be very"
"straightforward you can actually see"
"where everything is going to be before"
"the genes turn on to regionalize this"
"ectoderm into the face here's where the"
"mouth is going to be here's where the"
"animal's right eye the left eyes"
"actually comes in later here where the"
"placos are uh all of this"
"this you can already see a"
"representation of what a what an"
"embryonic face looks like"
"before any of that happens now we know"
"that this pattern is instructive because"
"if i modify this bioelectrical pattern"
"i'm going to tell you in a minute how we"
"do it then i can reproduce or i can i"
"can move all these organs and reproduce"
"them elsewhere that's how we make the"
"picasso tadpoles it's by it's by messing"
"around with this we call this the"
"electric face and so and so by messing"
"around with this instructive pattern you"
"can change where everything forms that"
"is a natural pattern that is absolutely"
"required for normal development in fact"
"human human patients with"
"channelopathies will have craniofacial"
"defects and other defects exactly for"
"this reason because it screws up the um"
"the electrophase now here's a"
"pathological pattern which we'll come"
"back to"
"shortly having to do with cancer so if"
"you if you inject an oncogene let's say"
"for a nasty human k-ras mutation into"
"this animal eventually it makes a tumor"
"but before these tumors become apparent"
"already you can see the bioelectrical"
"consequence of this oncogene it"
"basically decouples these cells from the"
"from the network and uh they will they"
"will transition to a unicellular-like"
"existence treating the rest of the"
"animal is just external environment and"
"sort of go off and do amoeba things that"
"i mean you know that amoebas like to do"
"um so uh so this is this is a way to"
"track these now much more important is"
"uh the ability to to write the"
"information to do functional experiments"
"now i want to be clear this is the all"
"of the phenotypes i'm going to show you"
today
"nothing about electrodes or applying"
"electrical fields there's no"
"electromagnetic so there's no waves"
"everything is molecular physiology so"
"the idea is in any kind of tissue we"
"really have only two things we can do we"
"can control which cell talks to each"
"other cell so we can control the"
"topology of this network and we can do"
"that by mutating these gap junctions by"
"opening them and closing them with drugs"
"that kind of thing or we can go in and"
"use either optogenetics or drugs or um"
"again mutating channels that will"
"control the electrical state of uh the"
"individual cells so we can we can write"
"the information and of course the latest"
"technology is optogenetic so we can"
"actually put down light masks onto these"
"uh animals um onto these tissues rather"
"and really control what all the"
"electrical patterns are going to be okay"
"so now what happens uh if you do this"
"right what is the what what is actually"
"the evidence and of course when when"
"when i first suggested that we were"
"going to do this now back in you know"
"1999 or so the the basic assumption was"
"and was what everybody said is that"
"voltage is a housekeeping parameter if"
"you if you mess around with cell voltage"
"you're going to get uninterpretable"
"depth and that's all that you know that"
"there's going to be to it so um i'm"
"going to show you some things some"
"things that actually happen because it"
"is not a housekeeping parameter it is an"
"informational medium now the one example"
"is if i take this early frog embryo and"
"i take some cells that are going to"
"become gut here and i inject rna and"
"coding specific uh potassium channels we"
"choose these channels because we we know"
"we can calculate that they're going to"
reproduce
"an eye specific pattern in whatever"
"cells they landed when you do that guess"
"what the cells end up making even though"
"they're endodermal cells that normally"
"would be faded to be gut they'll make an"
"eye this by the way this eye can be"
"formed anywhere on the uh on the embryo"
"uh the so-called master i gene pac-6"
"does not do that it only forms eyes up"
"here in the anterior and erected room"
"this way you can make eyes anywhere uh"
"they have all the right layers um optic"
"nerve or lens right and all of that"
"stuff uh"
"notice notice two interesting things one"
"is that this is modular at the level of"
"organs we did not give enough"
"information to specify how to make an"
"eye for good reason we have no idea how"
"to make an eye it has it has all kinds"
"of different cell types we don't know"
"how to micromanage their construction to"
"you know and to control all the gene"
"expression we don't know how to do that"
"what we did do was find a trigger a"
"subroutine call that basically"
"kickstarts the i building program and we"
"just said here build it build it right"
"here you already know how to do it uh go"
"go ahead and and the whole thing is"
"self-limiting so it didn't make a giant"
"eye that takes over the whole embryo it"
"doesn't make a tumor it makes an exact"
eye
"so that's that's the first thing it's"
"highly modular which is very good for"
"regenerative medicine that's great so so"
"you can call up simple triggers right"
"very well we'll get back to the issue of"
"memory momentarily simple triggers give"
"rise to very complex recall of action"
"now the other thing is here's this is a"
"cross-section of a lens sitting out in"
"the tail of a tadpole somewhere that we"
"induced the blue cells tagged with this"
"beta gal"
"enzyme are the cells that are actually"
"carrying our new ion channel"
"but there's not enough of them to make a"
"proper lens so while we are instructing"
"these cells to make a lens they do a"
"secondary instruction and they tell"
"their neighbors that hey all of you need"
"to work with us to uh to to help us"
"complete this lens these cells down here"
"were not themselves affected by us at"
"all so there's two levels of instruction"
"we instruct these cells these cells"
"instructor neighbors and they complete"
"this this this very specific"
"construction process um even though we"
"only managed to uh to inject half of"
"them okay so so that's very interesting"
"there's all kinds of all kinds of"
"modular instruction going on here not"
"just by us now"
"in addition to eyes what else can you"
"make well we can make we can make extra"
"forebrains we can make ectopic odor"
"cysts which are balancing organs we can"
"make ectopic hearts as you can see here"
"we can make legs so this is you know we"
"have five and six-legged uh frogs"
"um you can see you can see that and uh"
"something else that's interesting you"
"can make fins now that's a little odd"
"because tadpoles shouldn't have fins and"
"uh we'll get we'll get to that we'll get"
"to that momentarily but but so so we can"
"call up you know we can call up all"
"these different organs many other organs"
"we have no idea how to make yet we're"
"still in the process of cracking this"
"this code"
"but of course it has lots of biomedical"
"implications for example in regeneration"
"so frogs uh unlike salamanders for you"
"amputate the leg"
"45 days later there's nothing um"
"you what we did was uh design an"
"ionophore cocktail that would put the"
"wound in a pro-regenerative state when"
"you do that it kick-starts uh things"
"like msx1 which are regeneration genes"
"and eventually you get an you get a leg"
"the leg is touch sensitive it's motile"
"as you see here and eventually a pretty"
"a pretty respectable um like we are now"
"in the process of doing this in in"
"mammals ideally you know hopefully"
"someday in human patients um we're"
"nowhere close to humans yet we're just"
"working this out i have to do a"
"disclosure here this is um david kaplan"
"and i are co-founders of a company"
"called morphoceuticals inc which are"
"which you know they they make the uh"
"these bioreactors that are wearable uh"
"delivery vehicles for uh the signals"
"that we're trying to give"
"and the important thing about these this"
"this approach is that we are not going"
"to 3d print or or micromanage at the"
"level of stem cells this process at all"
"uh in the frog"
"you put the bioreactor on for 24 hours"
"you get uh 18 months of leg growth"
"during that time you don't touch it at"
"all the point is is not to control that"
"process throughout the point is to"
"change the decision making of those"
"cells immediately after the injury where"
"they're trying to decide are we going to"
"scar are we going to build something at"
"that point you change the the you you"
"shift the the circuit and then you don't"
"touch it again that's that's that's our"
"that's our ideal goal"
"okay so uh i want to switch back to this"
"uh to this uh these planarians planaria"
"are very interesting um they have a true"
"brain most of the same neurotransmitters"
"that you and i have lots of internal"
"organs uh of course they're regenerative"
"they also are immortal that's"
"interesting uh there's no such thing as"
"an old planarian they they do not age"
"enough at the level of the organism any"
"cell that senesces and dies they"
"regenerate it uh"
"that uh tells you something that uh"
"that that you know these these ideas"
"about thermodynamic limits of on"
"lifespan are are in fact not not you"
"know not not real uh also they don't"
"have uh multiple copies of p53 the way"
"that people think elephants need to um"
"to keep away from cancer but they do"
"know plenary don't get cancer they're"
"incredibly regenerative it's because of"
"their incredibly tight control over"
"their anatomy they have so something"
"like 30 percent of this animal is um"
"is plastic stem cells and and yet"
"there's no there's no there's no cancer"
"here so so what i want to use them for"
"is something very interesting"
"um here is uh here's a planarian it's"
"got one head one tail uh the anterior"
"gene marker is expressed in the head"
"like it should be not in the tail uh the"
"the we amputate the head we amputate the"
"tail this middle fragment will"
"regenerate this normal worm 100 of the"
"time it's it's got incredibly high"
fidelity
"but uh here's something has happened"
"again one headed worm head and tail the"
"gene expression is normal but when we"
"cut him"
"we got a two-headed worm this isn't"
"photoshop these are real real animals um"
"but i just told you it's a very uh it's"
"a very robust process why is this"
"happening well because we found an"
"electric circuit"
"it actually tells these animals how many"
"heads they're supposed to have and what"
"we did in the meantime was here's the"
"here's the pattern here's the"
"information stored in this electric"
"circuit that says one head one tail what"
"we did was and you can see it's kind of"
"messy the technology is still being"
"worked out um what you see is that we we"
"basically incepted a false memory into"
"this collective we said no actually a"
"planarian should have two heads like"
"this and uh and sure enough two heads"
"they make now here's the most important"
"thing on of about this whole story"
"this is not a map of this two-headed"
"animal okay the bioelectrics is not a"
"readout of what the anatomy is doing now"
"this is a map of this one-headed animal"
"so what you're seeing here is that a"
"normal one-headed anatomy can store it"
"can represent one of two"
"at least one of two uh uh"
"memories or or representations of what a"
"correct planarian is supposed to look"
"like now until they get injured"
"they ignore it and so it's kind of a"
"latent memory but as soon as they're"
"injured this is what guides the cells"
"when we ask the question how do they"
"know what to do and when to stop this is"
"it that that when i when i showed you"
"that feedback loop and i said that a"
"homeostatic circuit has to store set"
"points somewhere"
"we are now we are now looking at it you"
"are seeing the encoding of the set point"
"and not only are we seeing the set point"
"we know it's uh it's it's it's"
"instructive functionally because we can"
"change it and the anatomy follows and"
"probably there are many other things"
"that can store but"
"this is the one we've nailed down the"
best
"by the way"
"this may be if you think about where"
"complex cognitive capacities come from"
"this may be the the origin of counter"
"factual thought right this is a simple"
"circuit that can think about what it's"
"going to do if it gets injured at a"
"future time this is this is information"
"that is not at all related to what's"
"going on right now and it's not uh"
"related to um what all of its lengthy uh"
"past history was it's about the future"
"okay now i keep calling this thing a"
"memory why do i do that"
"because if i take one of these"
"two-headed animals and i chop off the uh"
"the the the endogenous head i chop off"
"this this crazy secondary head you know"
"people will say well the the posterior"
"tissues were epigenetically reprogrammed"
"okay fine we throw them in the garbage"
"we just keep the nice normal middle"
"fragment there's no genomic editing here"
"the genome is wild type so you would"
"think that the standard paradigm would"
"be that well what else could they do but"
"regenerate normal animals all of their"
"genetic instructions are for how to"
"build a one-headed animal right wrong"
"because because these middle middle"
"fragments will continue to build"
"two-headed worms in forever as far as we"
"can tell unless until we come back we"
"actually know how to reset them back to"
"being one-headed so there's a few"
"interesting things here"
"uh this is this is a memory because it's"
"long-term stable it's rewritable now"
"that we know how to do it it has latency"
"or conditional recall there are discrete"
"uh discrete behaviors that it can"
"remember in the one headed versus two"
"and so uh because the genome is"
"completely wild type here the question"
"the the answer to the question of where"
"is the determinant of the number of"
"heads in the planarian is not the genome"
"what the genome does is gives you some"
"hardware whose default behavior says"
"build one hit that's just the default"
"behavior the hardware is actually much"
"more interesting than that it has it"
"stores that information in a stable uh"
"electrical state of a circuit like a"
"flip-flop like a like a volatile ram"
"kind of thing and you can come along and"
"change it and when you do change it it"
"will stay it remembers the change state"
"you can go back and forth you can change"
"it so the answer to how many heads you"
"have is is um"
"is interesting it's it's the it's the"
"memory that you have in that electrical"
"circuit and what the genome does is set"
"the default state now here's a video"
"this is this is what these uh two-headed"
"animals do in their spare time um"
"i always show this video now the first"
"time i i presented this data at a"
"meeting someone stood up and said that"
"that's impossible those animals can't"
"exist and so now i make sure there's"
"there's a video so everyone can see"
"these are from from multiple cuts right"
"and what we're doing now is trying"
"really hard to uh merge together the two"
"lenses through which people see this"
"stuff on the one hand it's an electrical"
"circuit and it's a piece of physics and"
"you want to understand the stable"
"attractors and you know why does it do"
"certain things in certain states but on"
"the other hand we have this really"
"interesting um connectionist paradigm"
"that tells us how networks remember"
"things and in particular electrical"
"networks that can do pattern completion"
"right machine learning is is all over"
"the stuff when"
"you can make networks that learn such"
"that when a piece of the uh of the"
"pattern is missing the network will give"
"it back to you and there's of course"
"also a a kind of um uh kind of a"
"thermodynamic view on this so we're"
"trying to we're trying to merge we're"
"trying to merge all this stuff now i've"
"told you that you can make worms with"
"two heads but you can go even further"
"than that you can actually find"
"attractors in this circuit space that"
"belong to other species so if i take a"
"species if i take a planarian with a"
"triangular head"
"and we amputate the head uh"
"then what does that and then and then"
"for about 48 hours we we use a drug to"
"prevent the cells from electrically"
"talking to each other so we basically"
"fragment the network uh it it stays in"
"this really weird fragmented state we"
"pull out the drug everything settles"
"down to a to a stable"
"state when that happens sometimes"
"there's a stochastic process sometimes"
"it comes back to the correct triangular"
"head other times it makes a round head"
"like this piece like this s"
"mediterranean sometimes it makes a flat"
"head like this pifalina the frequency of"
"these heads is proportional to the"
"evolutionary distance from here to these"
"other species somewhere between 100 and"
"150 million years distance the genome"
"hasn't changed it's the same exact"
"hardware making uh completely different"
"types of heads not only the shape of the"
"head but the shapes of the brain the"
"distribution of the stem cells because"
"it can find these other attractors in"
"the state space that other species use"
"by default okay so you can knock it into"
"these other into these other tractors"
"you can actually go even further than"
"that and you can find"
"regions of amorphous space that that"
"evolution does not use because they're"
"not uh"
"ecologically competitive you can make"
these
"uh crazy spiky forms you can make you"
"change the symmetry type and make it a"
"cylinder you can make a combination that"
"has a flat uh you know flatworm with a"
"with a tube going into the third"
"dimension right and so what's what we're"
"doing now and and this is this is the"
"key to um to to to to biomedicine is to"
"make a full stack multi-scale set of"
"models where we start with the genetic"
"description of what are the channels and"
"pumps that exist in these cells so"
"transcriptional networks then we"
"simulate the physiology that results"
"from this in the tissue that is where do"
"the ions go and what are the voltage"
"patterns and result and that's built up"
"into large scale body-wide patterns and"
"the rules and we extract the rules by"
"which they change and ultimately what we"
"want is these kind of algorithmic models"
"that basically enable us to without"
"having to solve the inverse problem"
"enable us to make rational changes we"
"understand what the logic is right we we"
"can make certain changes so this is"
"so we want to go from the components"
"from the physics all the way up through"
"the physiology and ultimately to"
"something that looks like uh decision"
"making and the way that works is and"
"this is um our collaborator alexis pitek"
"made this incredible simulator which"
"where you can it's a virtual you can"
"make a virtual creature every cell runs"
"whatever circuit of ion channels and"
"genes and whatever else you want to put"
"in there and then you can ask system"
"level questions like hey when i cut this"
"in half how come it rescales the"
"electric pattern rescales or maybe it"
"doesn't rescale"
"uh so right so so uh so so you can do"
"all that um now uh one of the things you"
"can do with this model and and this is"
"this is just one of many examples is you"
"can make very targeted repairs of"
"complex defects so here is a frog a"
"tackle brain okay here's the forebrain"
"midbrain and hindbrain and what you can"
"do is let's say you expose them to some"
"kind of uh terratic alcohol nicotine"
"mutation of neurogenesis genes what you"
"will see is that"
"the normal bioelectrical pre-pattern"
"that controls where the edges of the"
"brain should go can can go awry and what"
"we did was we made a computer model and"
"this is also um the work of um"
"alexis uh pythag and uh a staff"
"scientist in our group"
pai
"they uh they made a computational model"
"of what actually goes wrong in these"
"cases and then they were able to ask the"
"model well given that the bioelectric"
"pattern is now wrong in other words"
"you're unable to remember the correct uh"
"shape that you're trying to make what"
"channels would we open and close to get"
"the shape back to normal okay so you can"
"interrogate that model that model made a"
"prediction there's this one interesting"
"ion channel called hcn2 which would"
"actually and this is not at all obvious"
"it's such a non-linear thing you can't"
"just guess you have to do that you have"
"to do the simulations um but it told us"
"that there was an interesting channel"
"that would actually fix the pattern so"
"we tried it and uh"
"you know to my great amazement when when"
"when models make actually make"
"predictions that turned out to be"
"correct uh what what happens is so here"
"again is the normal the normal tadpole"
brain
"now here what we did we did something"
"even worse than teratogens we mutated"
"notch notch is a really critical"
"neurogenesis gene okay it's required for"
"normal uh neural development when you"
"mutate notch the forebrain is gone the"
"midbrain and hindbrain are a bubble"
"these animals have no behavior they just"
"lay there just terrible terrible brain"
defect
"on this background we"
"open we show two things you can either"
"introduce new hcn2 channels or you can"
"just use drugs in fact already human"
"approved drugs to open the native hcn2"
"channels and when you do that you get"
"your normal brain back you get the brain"
"structure back in fact these animals"
"have iqs but in the learning assay that"
"are indistinguishable from wild types so"
now
"this is where this this field has gone"
"when we started we were doing uh screens"
"of bioelectric moderate modifications to"
"find out what is the space of possible"
"things that bioelectricity controls now"
"we're to the point where we have an"
"actual computational model of the"
"circuit that can predict drugs so this"
"is this is not um you know that's very"
"important to realize that we're now and"
"again this is still very early you know"
"this is this baby steps compared to"
"what's possible but but basically we're"
"to the point where we can understand"
"these circuits and make models that"
"allow us to infer interventions and so"
"the idea is and and some you know"
"there's a simple version of it up that"
"people can play with and there's some"
"some software that you can download but"
"the idea is that someday you're going to"
"be able to sit in front of the software"
"you're going to pick some tissues the"
"software will already know from from rna"
"from rna-seq studies"
"what all the control knobs in this"
"tissue are meaning all the channels that"
"are expressed and it will know what the"
"correct pattern is and it will then"
"simply help you pick drugs that open and"
"close the correct channels using that"
"simulator that of course is the key part"
"the bioelectric simulator so lots and"
"lots of work to do but we can already"
"see the the shape of this uh the shape"
"of this tool coming so now i want to uh"
"back off from the from the biomedical"
"stuff which is important because i'm"
"going to give you a bunch of um ideas"
"that are that border on philosophy and"
"it's really important to know that this"
"stuff actually drives uh experimental"
"progress right it's not just the stuff"
"that you can sort of take it or leave it"
"the way that a lot of philosophical"
"claims are now this this actually is"
"testable and it's driven on progress"
"so let's let's just look at let's just"
"look at some of this uh one of the"
"things we know is that goals"
"can uh can change scale during the"
"lifetime of of an individual so"
"individual cells have very very simple"
"goals uh they can scale up they can they"
"can merge together to pursue very large"
"scale goals for example uh the goal of"
"maintaining a limb now individual cells"
"have no idea what a limb is only the"
"cellular collective can measure the"
"these these states to know if the limb"
"is right or not in fact many of them"
"will have to die all the stuff in"
"between the fingers has to has to has to"
"die so this is a goal that the"
"individual cells aren't following it the"
"collective is following it so the so the"
"the um the goal has has grown but it can"
"also shrink and so this is here this is"
"glioblastoma in culture"
"and so what you can see here is that uh"
"these cells have become electrically"
"isolated from the network they go back"
"to a their their primitive unicellular"
"lifestyle where uh you know what are"
"their goals now well uh every you know"
"every cell wants to become two cells uh"
"and that famous quote and uh and and to"
"migrate to where life is good so now"
"metastasis um you know uh transformation"
"and so on"
"okay so so so the goal now now what's"
"important to to think about is that"
"a lot of times people think of cancer"
"cells as being more selfish than normal"
"cells actually think that's wrong i"
"think they're exactly as selfish as any"
"other biological creature it's just that"
"their cells are tiny so these cells are"
"all being very selfish as well but their"
"self is huge they're their goal and"
"they're taking energy away from other"
"organs and so on their goal is to make"
"this thing the so so their self is"
"rather large the self can shrink the"
"self can grow and and shrink and so what"
"that means is that we can start to think"
"about cognition as uh the size of the"
"goals that individual cells are capable"
"of pursuing so a single cell may have a"
"little bit of memory going backwards a"
"little bit of anticipation capacity"
"going forward but a network of cells can"
measure
"much larger areas they can have more"
"memory and more anticipation because"
"they have more computational hardware"
"basically this is uh again this is the"
"just to say this is not just empty"
"theory we actually use this this is that"
"the tumor that i showed you"
"we said okay what we're going to do is"
"we're going to along with that oncogene"
"we're going to inject an ion channel"
"that's going to force you to remain"
"connected to the electrical network"
"meaning yes you've got the oncogene"
"which which theory says should you"
"should transform you except that"
"you're still going to be electrically"
"connected to the network that remembers"
"what a correct set of organs and tissues"
"are and this is what happens right the"
"the oncogene is labeled in red you can"
"see there's tons of it's blazingly"
"strongly expressed in fact it's"
"everywhere there's no tumor and there's"
"no tumor because this cell is not being"
"allowed to go off on its own it's being"
"it's being forced to uh to be part of"
"this uh this this larger scale tissue"
"level um system that is basically not"
"into making tumors it's it's its goal"
"state is is is maintaining nerve and"
"muscle and everything else that's there"
okay
"so uh what you can then do is you can"
"think about all sorts of uh creatures in"
"fact any arbitrary creature be it a"
"natural creature involved an alien"
"whatever you want and you can plot it on"
"a diagram that tracks the scale of the"
"biggest goals that that creature can"
"pursue so this is this kind of looks a"
"little bit like those minkowski"
"relativity diagrams where i've taken um"
"all of space and put it on one sort of"
"axis time is here and so what i simply"
"ask for any kind of creature"
"you know you want you want to produce"
"i'll say okay what is the"
"largest in terms of space and time goal"
"that it's a capable of following is it"
"is it just measuring local local um you"
"know butyrate concentration and it's got"
"a memory of you know a few seconds and"
"so on maybe it's a bacteria or a tick"
"does it have a memory backwards of you"
"know some number of months in"
"anticipation forward a little bit but"
"you really can't care about what's going"
"to happen three months from now and you"
"know 10 miles over it's just impossible"
"right if you're a human well you might"
"be you might be working towards world"
"peace and you might be stressed out by"
"the financial markets and you might be"
"depressed that the sun is going to burn"
"out in some number of billion of years"
"you know your your your goal uh"
"your your ability to represent goals are"
"is are enormous right this is huge and"
so
"we can define a cognitive horizon almost"
"like a um like a like a light cone of"
"things that you can possibly care about"
"humans maybe uniquely are capable of"
"caring about goals that are bigger than"
"their own lifespan and so that probably"
"has has a lot of psychological"
"ramifications uh for us that other"
"creatures don't have to deal with"
"because if your goals are small you are"
"guaranteed they are guaranteed to be"
"achievable in your lifespan we are maybe"
"you uniquely can have goals that are"
"definitely not achievable in our"
"lifespan right so we can we can think"
"about that but the idea is that"
"you can place you can you can compare"
"all of these different types of"
"cognitive systems on the same uh on the"
"same kind of graph no matter what"
"they're made of or how they got here"
"it's the central invariant is what kind"
"of goals can they follow and in fact um"
"we can we can make some very specific"
"models about how these goals scale up so"
"to go from here to here from a single"
"cell that has this very small"
"homeostatic loop of things that it"
"measures compares and then acts uh once"
"you start connecting cells with gap"
"junctions with these electrical synapses"
"everything scales up what what every"
"cell measures is in part a function of"
"what its neighbors measure so now"
"they're measuring something very large"
"they're um they're they're"
"in all of these pieces"
"the set points become bigger the the"
"actions become bigger and so their goals"
"scale up okay and so this is one way to"
"scale them one of the important uh"
"aspects of how they scale is the fact"
"that gap junctions have an interesting"
"property the gap changes are kind of"
"magic because unlike regular signaling"
"see when this cell signals to this other"
"cell through let's say a secreted"
"molecule this cell knows perfectly well"
"that the signal came from outside and so"
"you could it can it can um ignore it you"
"can choose to do something about it but"
"it but the boundary between between"
"it and and another cell the the"
"individual identity is is very strong"
"right it's very strongly maintained what"
"happens with gap junctions is that they"
"provide uh a uh access from each cell to"
"it to the intracellular miller of the"
"other cell so that means that when this"
"cell experiences something right so"
"something happens and there's a there's"
"a calcium spike and then you know that"
"that's the engram of that memory of that"
"event right the cell has a memory"
"that calcium can propagate to the"
"neighboring cell it has no metadata on"
"it about who it belongs to and so this"
"cell now receives that same calcium it"
"has no idea whether that's my memory or"
"whether that's your memory so what these"
"things do in effect what the gap"
"junctions do is they dissolve or at"
"least partially the boundaries between"
"individuals it's like a mind meld"
"because the information now becomes"
"shared once that happens you are"
"automatically growing in in cognition"
"because not only do your goals get"
"bigger it's impossible not to cooperate"
"you can't you can't uh you know in the"
"in the game theory sense you can't"
"defect against yourself you're basically"
"whatever you do to your neighbor it"
"comes it comes back to you immediately"
"okay you're linked so it erases it's"
"kind of interesting my so so my memory"
"becomes our memories my stress whatever"
"you're stressed about becomes our stress"
"and my goal becomes our goal and all of"
"these things uh become larger so in the"
"last couple of minutes i just have a few"
minutes
"what i want to do is show you these"
"novel organisms because we've been"
"talking a lot about goals and the idea"
"of of goal directedness as a central"
"aspect of scaling of cognition we can"
"ask interesting questions where do these"
"goals come from right and the standard"
"answer of course is evolution and"
"selection so"
"we started this project a few years ago"
"this was driven in my group by staff"
"scientist doug blackiston and then we"
"worked very closely with uh josh bongard"
"at university of vermont and sam"
"kriegman was his grad student at the"
"time and uh and and this is part of this"
"this new um institute for"
"computationally designed organisms we"
"asked we asked a couple of questions the"
"first question is um"
"how much plasticity is there in cells"
"building things of course there's the"
"genomic default you know"
"fish eggs make fish and and acorns make"
"oak trees but much plasticity is there"
"and and then the question is what do"
"cells actually want because we don't see"
"the cell so let's let's look at skin uh"
"skin has this is boring two-dimensional"
"life on the outside of an embryo it"
"keeps out the bacteria we don't know"
"what the skin cells want because"
"normally they're under instruction from"
"all the other cells what happens if you"
"if you give them a chance to kind of"
"reboot their multicellularity what are"
"they what are they what are the"
"backgrounds and this is important"
"because evolution"
"doesn't work on a blank canvas evolution"
"has to modify uh the agendas of cells"
"much like we as i'll show you in a"
"minute evolution works with this kind of"
"agential material and so it has to deal"
"with whatever it is that cells are going"
"to do and then modify that in in various"
"ways for uh to improve selection so um"
"so here's what happens uh we take this"
"is a frog embryo at about uh"
"about 12 to 18 hours uh"
"you you you take the uh you take the ant"
"the the animal cap cells these are faded"
"to be skin you dissociate them into um"
"here you can see that they're being"
"pipetted so this is a dissociated clump"
"of cells they're being pipetted into"
"this uh into this little hole now"
"there's many things they could have done"
"they could have died they could have"
"crawled off they could have become a"
"nice flat monolayer the way cell"
"cultures do they didn't do any of those"
"things they combined together like this"
"they they sort of uh condensed and then"
"what you're seeing the flashing that's"
"actually calcium signaling so so already"
"we can tell something interesting is"
"going on looks very very brain-like and"
"then what they do is they become these"
"mobile little creatures called xenobots"
"so we call them xenobots xenopus lavis"
"is the name of the frog they come from"
"what they do is they repurpose their"
"little hairs their little cilia that are"
"normally used to"
"redistribute mucus on the outside of the"
"of the body they use them to swim now"
"they've repurposed it here's here's ears"
"it's chugging along these guys you can"
"see the variety and behaviors this one's"
"going in circles that one sort of"
"patrols back and forth here are some"
"collective behaviors that one's going on"
"a longer journey these two are"
"interacting somehow these guys are just"
"sitting there all kinds of varieties now"
"i'm going to show you what happens when"
"you put them in a maze this is still"
"water there's no water movement here"
"there's no gradients it's just just"
"spring water"
"it takes the corner without having to"
"bump into the opposite wall at this"
"point something happens is some sort of"
"nano free will kicks in or something and"
"it decides to turn around and go back"
"where it came from you have no idea why"
"there's some sort of internal dynamics"
"that controls their behavior so so it's"
"you know it's sort of exploring it takes"
"that it takes the corner at this point i"
"forget it it's going back where it came"
"from right so of course we need to now"
"start to understand what drives these"
"various behaviors now they can uh they"
"can regenerate so if you cut them in"
half
"they can uh they can try to uh"
"regain their new uh zen abode shape um"
"notice the force that it has to generate"
"through this through this hinge back"
"here but 180 degree hinge right think of"
"doing a bicep curl through when you when"
"your arm is completely straight it's"
"really hard and here they generate this"
"massive force and they sort of fold"
"themselves up back to a nice cinema now"
"here is the calcium signaling looks very"
"brain like there are no neurons in here"
"this is just skin okay this is these are"
"just skin cells and one of the most"
"amazing things that they do"
"is uh"
"what we what we discovered is that when"
"you take these when you take these"
"creatures and you uh"
"take away the ability for them to"
"replicate in their normal froggy"
"fashions they can't do any of that"
"anymore what they do is they figure out"
"a new way to replicate themselves we"
"call it kinematic replication that as"
"far as we know no other creature on"
"earth does they do exactly what we did"
"when we created zenobots they work with"
"the material they're given so what we do"
"is we sprinkle a bunch of skin cells"
"loose skin cells in their environment"
"and they've basically rediscovered von"
"neumann's dream what they will do is"
"they will run around collect parts and"
"make copies of themselves out of those"
"parts okay now the reason this works is"
"because they're not working in a"
"a passive medium we are able to make"
"xenobots i mean the xeno the cells do"
"all the heavy lifting we don't know how"
"to create a xenobot but we it works"
because
"the material itself uh has um has"
"certain activities it likes to do which"
"which means it likes to get together"
"into a into a zone about and have"
"certain behaviors and they take"
"advantage of that exact same property as"
"does evolution in the material that they"
"have so they create these little they"
"create these little clumps the little"
"clumps become cinnabots and guess what"
"they do they go and they make the next"
"generation of cinemas which makes the"
"next generation of cinemas this is not a"
"true evolutionary lineage they don't"
"have strong heredity yet at least as far"
"as we know uh but it is a method of"
"replication that they figured out within"
"about 48 hours of of life on earth never"
"having existed before there has never"
"been evolutionary selection for them to"
"be able to do this okay this has just"
"never happened this is completely novel"
"where does it come from and so we can we"
"can start to think about this there's a"
"there's a"
"genome a xenopus genome the xenopus"
"genome produces"
"cells these cells can work together to"
"make an embryo and it will look like"
"this and then like this and then make"
"these little tadpoles running around or"
"it can do this and it will make a"
"xenobot if we if we um feed it and"
"extend their lifespan for about two and"
"a half months they have a developmental"
"sequence they make this what is that"
"i've never seen that i have no idea what"
"that is they have their own"
"developmental sequence again never"
"existed on earth before as far as we"
"know and they have a completely"
"different behavior which is that"
"the xenobots uh don't have a"
"straightforward evolutionary backstory"
"the cells do but they were selected to"
"sit quietly on the outside of a"
"of an embryo and keep out the bacteria"
"um the selection pressure was was"
"completely different the behavior is"
"emerging we don't know what their"
"cognitive capacities are we're still"
"we're investigating so just to close up"
"i'm finishing up here uh this is the"
"framework that i'm working on um"
"uh called uh t a m e technological"
"approach to mine everywhere and the"
"emphasis is this there's a continuum of"
"agency uh no binary categories about"
"whether something is cognitive or isn't"
"or has true memory or not"
"everything is is continuous uh"
"empirically testable on this idea of"
"what level of cognitive um it's it's"
"basically then its intentional stance"
"which is what what we applied to"
"engineering which is what level of um of"
"cognitive model it gives you the optimal"
"prediction and control okay not"
"necessarily for brains"
"for for any kind of substrates selves"
"are defined by the goals that they're"
"capable of pursuing and their"
"intelligence is uh defined by the size"
"of the goals they're able to navigate"
"towards in abstract spaces developmental"
"bioelectricity is a phylogenetic"
"precursor of what we see in brains it is"
"the actual physiological medium for the"
"software of life and thus for the"
"cognition of morphogenetic swarms other"
"things may be too i don't know this is"
"just the you know the one the one that"
"we found"
"and evolution is is greatly potentiated"
"by this kind of multi-scale competency"
"architecture it doesn't build it doesn't"
"find solutions to environments it builds"
"machines that solve novel problems and"
"understanding how that happens is uh is"
"is you know one of the most exciting"
"things for the future so i will just"
"close by reminding us that um you know"
uh
"darwin was um kind of um"
"uh impressed with the with a variety of"
"living things and he has this phrase you"
"know endless forms most beautiful and i"
"think uh"
"many of us are going to be uh living in"
"the world where all of the things that"
"darwin thought about meeting all the"
"natural evolved products of that one"
"evolutionary tree on earth are all going"
"to be a tiny corner of this incredibly"
"huge option space every combination of"
"evolved material dna cells tissues some"
"sort of engineered object and nano"
"materials machines and my you know and"
"so on and and software uh put together"
"make a viable body with some kind of"
"cognitive apparatus we got hybrids and"
"cyborgs and biorobotics and just you"
"know uh if all of this is going to make"
"the um"
"uh the cantina scene at the beginning of"
"star wars seem"
"just absolutely tame uh by comparison"
"all of these things will be here and the"
"important thing is for for society via"
"ethics and other aspects is that we will"
"no longer be able to know how to relate"
"to something based on how it got here or"
"where it fits on the evolutionary tree"
"it used to be easy you could come along"
"and sort of knock on something if you"
"heard a metallic sound you could say ah"
"that came from a factory it's going to"
"be boring i have the right to take it"
"apart if i want and and that's that it's"
"a machine and if i do that and i you"
"know and it's sort of soft and fuzzy"
"then ah it's evolved and it's and it's"
"probably interesting and i have to be"
"nice to it and so on that's going to be"
"out the window none of those simple"
"tests are going to work anymore we're"
"going to be we're going to have to"
"figure out a new um a new way to relate"
"to systems that we just have have"
"absolutely no guideposts to so um"
"lots of papers about any of this please"
"contact me if you would like them uh i"
"want to thank the um"
"thank the postdocs and students who did"
"all the work thank the uh always thank"
"the animals they do all of the all of"
"the hard work and all this all of this"
"stuff our funders of course um the two"
"disclosures which are the companies that"
"we're associated with and um yeah that's"
"it uh thank you so much i'll take"
questions
"thank you thank you michael for your uh"
"wonderful talk i think we have learned a"
"lot you know from the lectures you know"
"particularly um um"
"when i"
um
"was you know going through your your"
"lectures i find that you know it reminds"
"me of a movie the amazing spider-man"
"so you know part of it is actually about"
"you know the uh the professor was like"
"like to grow you know sort of this uh"
"regrow his hand over on this movie"
"itself so it's very interesting so i"
"think you know many of our colleagues"
"you know have benefited from this you"
"know i would like to encourage you know"
"our music colleagues you know to discuss"
"possible um collaboration you know with"
"michael and this will surely"
"further strengthen our research"
"collaboration relationship with tough"
"universities so with that let us move on"
"with the q and a sessions and please"
"raise your hand you know if you have any"
"questions and we'll do this on the first"
"come first serve basis or you can type"
"your questions um"
"into the chat box and i will direct your"
"questions to michael for answering your"
"queries so let us now start the qns"
sessions
"brett calcutt has raised his hand if"
"you'd like him to be able to talk"
"sure go ahead"
please
"uh hi can you hear can you hear me yep"
"yes i can"
"uh thanks for a fascinating uh talk i've"
"been thank you looking looking at work"
"for a few for a while now and um it's"
"very nice to hear it here live and the"
"question i have"
"um concerns the notion of a set point"
"and a default set point so"
"you're looking at changing the set"
"points interactively with the sort of"
"living organisms but as you mentioned"
"these the default sharepoint"
"must somehow be encoded in uh"
"in a heritable way as well so"
"whereabouts my question to you is where"
"abouts or can we find where those"
"heritables default seat points are"
"and then look at"
changing
"these heritable set points so in other"
"words instead of intervening on the"
"living animal you could intervene on the"
"single cell the heritable single cell"
"and actually change a lineage um at the"
"genetic level"
"yeah um right so so let's see so so the"
"first uh"
"the first question is where where do the"
"where do the default set points come"
"from so"
"basically they emerge from from symmetry"
"breaking an app and amplification of an"
"electrical circuit that's encoded by ion"
"channel genes so what evolution does"
"among other things is"
"sculpt the the"
"complement of ion channel genes that a"
"collective of cells is going to have"
"that creates a circuit that by default"
"when the when the power comes on so to"
"speak and the thing is is becomes alive"
"the the the electrical circuit settles"
"down reliably settles down to a default"
"state now if you wanted to you could try"
"to intervene there at the genetic level"
"and in fact we've done that we've we've"
"added and removed channels and you can"
"certainly do that uh the problem is like"
"with many of these systems that it it's"
"it's it's uh there's a there's a very"
"non indirect relationship so so you have"
"to do a lot of computational modeling"
"and in fact that's for example what we"
"did in that in that brain study"
"to know what channel would i need to"
"change genetically to give me the final"
"pattern that i want it's a really hard"
"problem you know we've made a little bit"
"of progress but it's very hard i think"
"in the end a much easier way is going to"
"be to take advantage of the memory uh"
"and and the behavioral properties of"
"these systems and to actually train them"
"so i think so so so yes in theory you"
"can do it from the bottom up but i think"
"we're going to find that it's much"
"easier to to interact with them"
"be due to their computational properties"
"not not at the level of hardware"
"right any more questions from me"
"uh no i think i think that's uh that's a"
"very interesting i mean i guess that the"
"the approach i'm coming from is i'm"
"interested in the the"
"the evolutionary pathways as well as the"
"developmental pathway so i'm like"
"i guess i'm really fascinated how you"
"can trap"
"push these things in different"
"evolutionary ways but but i think that"
"the answer sounds sounds definitely"
"right trying to trying to reverse"
engineer
"that kind of thing sounds like a very"
"very hard ass"
"well and actually i'll i'll say one"
"other thing about about there's an"
"interesting thing about evolution too"
"which is that uh if you think about um"
"of evolution uh working on these uh"
"you know the the the the"
"the fitness landscape right and"
"evolution uh is uh has has paths from"
"from from one region to two to another"
"to try and uh create a particular kind"
"of pattern there's actually"
"the the evolution has the exact same"
"options that we as engineers do it can"
"try to micromanage the process by"
"tinkering with the individual proteins"
"right the channels and i'm sure it does"
"that but there's a much faster road and"
"i think actually what evolution does"
"given how incredibly rapid evolutionary"
"change is i mean it's always shocking"
"how fast this hill climbing search"
"actually works in biology is that what i"
"think it actually tries to do most of"
"the time is to exactly do what we do"
"which is which is to work at a higher"
"level so in other words uh"
"yes you can try to reproduce a bunch of"
"ion channels in just the right"
"configuration to uh to make specific"
"things happen in the embryo but it's"
"it's it's much easier to to um tweak"
"certain cells to stimulate those cells"
"to uh kick start an existing module is"
"this the same way that we do so it has"
"the ability right to act at different um"
"at different uh different levels and and"
"then both of those are available to"
"evolution and and they have pros and"
"cons of course"
"thanks very much"
"thank you"
um
"the next uh"
"uh person is paul griffin's paul would"
"you like to ask questions"
"or you would like me to leave your"
"questions you can you can read that he's"
"written it down in the chat so okay so"
"paul is actually asking you know your"
"inductions of the eye can't help but"
"bring to the mind or experiment on"
"organizers and the later discovery that"
"simple chemical stimuli"
"could induce"
"specific structures and then later"
"master control gene so could you say"
"something about how these previous"
"discoveries of powerful"
"interventions variables relate to your"
"new discovery how do these causes fit in"
"a sequence of a network"
"yeah yeah thanks paul um great question"
um
"couple things uh so it is certainly the"
"case that a bioelectric"
"bioelectric triggers are not"
"the only"
"uh they are not the only uh"
"triggers that exist so there are there"
"are there are so called master regulator"
"uh pro you know biochemical signals"
"there are biomechanical states that that"
"triggers specific things right um"
"so so from from that perspective i think"
"that evolution the uses as well with"
"physic you know it exploits physics in"
"in whatever way it can to create this"
"kind of hierarchical modular control"
"structure now i i will say that i do so"
"so by electricity is not alone in being"
"able to serve as as a high-level"
"controller but it has interesting and"
"unique properties so every once in a"
"while you'll see in nature or science"
"you'll see somebody made a logic gate"
"out of diffusible molecules or liquid"
"you know some kind and the reason it's"
"in nature in science is because it's so"
"hard it is so hard to make these kind of"
"computational devices out of uh out of"
"out of biochemical states electricity is"
"great for this and i think evolution"
"noticed how convenient it is"
"back as far back as bacteria not because"
"you can't do it another way it's just"
"super convenient to make feedback loops"
"to propagate information long distances"
"to make networks that may that uh that"
"do computations it's just electrical"
"networks there's no um it's it's not an"
"accident that that nervous systems use"
"it that our computer technology uses"
"it's just super convenient and so"
"also there will be uh two other kind so"
"that that i think is the more general"
"more interesting aspect the"
"i will i will also say a couple of"
"things uh there is a so-called master"
"eye regulator pac-6 which which you know"
"if you look in the developmental biology"
"textbook it will say this thing tells"
"you where the eye should be"
"that only works in the anterior"
"neurectoderm in frog it does not work"
back
"you know behind the middle of the head"
"uh the bioelectric state works anywhere"
"and one of the things it does is turn on"
"pack six turning on pac-6 alone is not"
"sufficient the bioelectrics is is"
"further upstream so i'm not claiming"
"that in every possible case the"
"bioelectrics is going to be upstream"
"there may well be cases where the most"
um
"uh you know uh"
"the most uh"
"tractable the most powerful control"
"point maybe by mechanical or by"
"electrical but in every case that we've"
"looked at it was the it was the"
"bioelectrics and so um i see i see your"
"question about um about specificity that"
"that's interesting that that's very"
"interesting too in uh in the"
"bioelectrics where the as far as we can"
"tell and we're open to surprises down"
"the line the the specificity the of the"
"bioelectric code we in fact we've done a"
"lot of thinking about this like where"
"where is the what's the encoding"
"actually how do you say i versus limb"
"versus heart like where's the"
"specificity it seems to be"
"and we have computational models that"
"you know i'll show you offline that kind"
"of implement this it's it's in a spatial"
"pattern of resting potentials it is not"
"in any one cell there's no one cell that"
"holds the pattern it is a think of like"
"like they're almost like flags right"
"where it's which is a defined the flags"
"of various countries are a defined piece"
"of um you know piece of rectangular"
"real estate that has a certain pattern"
"and when you see that pattern you know"
"that that's mapped to a particular"
"outcome that's what bioelectric seems to"
"be cells can recognize specific patterns"
"and we've been cataloging some of those"
"patterns we've been looking at how"
"they're interpreted that's that's how"
"that's how the bioelectrics codes"
"encode specificity"
interesting
"any any more questions from paul"
"one more from tom close if possible"
"otherwise we're good"
sure
"can you i can't see the questions do you"
"have the questions john"
"oh i can see the i can see them on the q"
"a you want me to just uh yeah if you"
"just put the q a down the bottom uh"
"it'll yep jump there okay"
"yeah um so yeah so he's asking about the"
"placebo effect um i i think you're right"
"on the money this is something that"
"we've spent some time thinking about"
"recently um and there's some very"
"interesting work um"
uh
"on on on not only placebo effect but uh"
"uh hypno dermatology and uh the idea of"
"uh yeah uh albert mason did some amazing"
"work um on uh"
"hypnotic treatment of uh of of skin"
"diseases and we're not talking about"
"stress-induced rashes you know that go"
"away when you calm down we're talking"
"about actually missing uh"
"cell types in the skin that were causing"
"esterosis and various other things uh i"
"think you're absolutely right i think um"
"as we start to think about levels of"
"control and okay i can control at the at"
"the molecular level and try to get all"
"the gene expression correct to make"
"something happen that's brutally hard i"
"can try it at the level of uh at the"
"tissue level and try to convince the"
"tissue to do certain things it it"
"as one tries to climb that that that"
"ladder i think ultimately it's entirely"
"possible that you can relate to these"
"things uh from the nervous system down"
"by convincing"
"uh the master of regulator between our"
"ears that certain things are supposed to"
"happen it will percolate down to uh"
"control the physiology of the body way"
"better than we could micromanage it"
"right i think that's entirely possible"
"so so yeah i think i think there is"
"there is a version of the placebo effect"
"here and in fact one of our projects is"
"to take um all of the concepts or as"
"many as possible concepts from uh"
"cognitive neuroscience and convert them"
"into things you can do in the body so"
"there ought to be a version of the"
"placebo effect that uh that that uh you"
"know that war in in fact actually"
"actually i'll tell you there is um you"
"know now that you ask uh it turns out we"
"already have an example is i didn't even"
"think of it that way before uh we showed"
"that uh in models of gene regulatory"
"networks you ought to be able to do and"
"when we're testing it now in at the"
"bench but we don't have any data on it"
"yet you ought to be able to do"
"associative learning that is you ought"
"to be able to pair a neutral drug that"
"doesn't do anything with a powerful drug"
"that changes the state of the network"
"you present them paired okay the way"
"basically pavlov's dog right you present"
"you present a neutral stimulus with a"
"with a functional stimulus you do that"
"for a while the network learns to"
"associate them and then eventually you"
"can just present the the the inert drug"
"and the and the system acts the same way"
"that can be looked at as a cellular"
"placebo effect because at that point you"
know
"much as like like we we you know people"
"human patients say oh wow he's giving me"
"a blue pill that's got it you know"
"that's got to do something you know"
"useful the tissue does the same thing"
"basically eventually once it's learned"
"the pairing the the inactive drug causes"
"the same effect"
"maybe maybe that's maybe that's a"
"version of a cellular placebo effect"
"thank you alistairs"
"thanks yeah i just wanted and that's an"
"amazing idea i think"
"all right yeah i just want to check tom"
"is that that's that's what you're after"
um
"are there any more questions you know"
"from the floor"
"one one point you made uh fairly"
"strongly but briefly was around control"
"at any external electric fields um you"
"know we my colleagues and i do a lot of"
"work with electrical stimulation and"
"electrical impedance"
"uh we're looking at you know cure"
"treatments for"
"some conditions where we're you know"
"applying external fields"
"to the brain to the spinal cord to other"
things
"do you always"
uh
"steer clear of that are the external"
"fields or do you think they're they're"
"another tool to use here"
"there's certainly another tool um the"
"reason the reason we tend not to use"
"them is is for a very simple reason"
"we are because we are not trying to"
"control spiking and excitable cells"
"right what we want to set up are"
"standing fairly complex patterns of"
"resting voltage potential that stay for"
"hours in some cases days"
"we don't know how to induce that with"
"electrodes right because what you can do"
"is now what's what's very good with"
"electrodes is you can certainly control"
"spiking right so you can trigger trigger"
"neurons and you can you can induce um"
"directional electrical fields that will"
"help cells migrate so that's that's"
"great if you want cells crawling so you"
"set up your electrodes and they'll crawl"
"but the problem is if i have a cell in"
"in in you know between two electrodes"
"and i and i set up a"
"an electrical field"
"this side of the cell will be"
"depolarized that cell will be that side"
"will be hyperpolarized the net is"
"unchanged i don't know how to use"
"electrodes to set up the okay you're"
"going to be minus 30 you're going to be"
"minus 40 you're going to be minus 50 and"
"you stay that way for six hours i don't"
"know how to do that with electrodes it's"
"entirely possible uh that someday"
"someone you know if you have thoughts on"
"that definitely email me you know"
"offline and we'll and let's talk about"
"it i've never seen a way to do that with"
"electrodes that's the only way there's"
"nothing wrong with it it's great for all"
"kinds of applications but i just don't"
"know how to set up voltage gradients"
"like long-term voltage gradients with it"
"yeah i think if you do you end up uh"
"changing ph and causing electrolysis"
"things like that"
"there are some"
"there have been some papers around uh"
"using beam forming techniques"
"but if that works if that really works"
"i'm not quite sure you know"
"maybe in a bowl of saline but"
"more complex i i haven't seen the you"
"know it didn't move forward since a few"
"years ago so"
"it'd be great to go back and take a look"
"at that it it it would be great because"
"because a lot of the technologies you"
"know let's say optogenetics requires you"
"to have a light path to the cells and"
"that's great for things that are"
"ectodermal on the outside but what are"
"you going to do you know deep deep"
"inside so um yeah it would be great to"
"have those kind of technologies you know"
"there are some other things like uh"
"the combination of um"
"ultrasound and other and"
"kind of you know the light lightning"
"thunder kind of relationship with you"
"yeah yeah the future yeah the future you"
"know this technology is everything i've"
"shown you is is baby steps uh you know"
"the future is going to be amazing"
"there's lots of um lots of reagents that"
"need to be developed for this"
"fantastic thank you so much it's been"
"thank you very much an amazing talk i"
think
"uh covered you know"
really
"kind of"
"eye-opening mind kind of um expanding um"
"ideas fantastic um super thank you so"
"much i'm really glad"
"we would like to wish michael to"
"continue his to achieve greater heights"
"in his academic career"
"and uh we hope that he can visit us soon"
"and we are happy to host him and love"
"tonight i will close these sessions and"
"we wish and i wish everyone a good day"
