"thank you for having me here I'm"
"delighted to be able to talk to you"
"about these topics the title and"
"everything else I was changing up until"
"this morning so apologies that it's a"
"little different um I was asked to talk"
"about the by electrics of cancer today"
"and so what you'll notice is that the"
"first third to almost half of the talk"
"is developmental biology and this is"
"because I think fundamentally there are"
"some really profound issues in cancer"
"that have the roots in developmental"
"biology and I want to share with you"
"some some thoughts on this topic if you"
"have any other questions in the future"
"you can you can find me here so the"
"whole talk summarized in one sentence"
"basically is that what I'm going to tell"
"you is that like the brain somatic"
"tissues in the body communicate"
"electrically they form networks and"
"these networks much like neural networks"
"can make decisions and the decisions"
"they make are decisions about Anatomy so"
"instead of behavior they decide"
"questions of anatomy and that we can now"
"target the system for control of"
"large-scale cellular decision-making and"
"that this has many applications I think"
"in cancer medicine and I will tell you"
"right now that I'm gonna show you some"
"pretty weird-looking organisms such as"
"this five legged frog and none of these"
"things are photoshopped these are all"
"real real animals that are alive in our"
"lab ok so the first thing I want to talk"
"about is some some thoughts about cancer"
"by different ways to think about cancer"
"biology so this animal right here is a"
"single-cell animal called a lacrimarum"
"this is in real-time and you will see it"
"as he goes around hunting for bacteria"
"in its environment you'll see a few"
"things so first of all notice the"
"incredible control it has over its"
"Anatomy so people who are into soft body"
"robotics and things like this we don't"
"have anything that remotely approaches"
"this so this this animal controls its"
"pattern its physiology and its behavior"
"all in one cell and the reason I'm"
"showing this to you is because a lot of"
"people work on the question of why is"
"there cancer and why why cancer happens"
"I think another really important"
"question is why isn't there any why is"
"there anything other than cancer because"
"individual cells are extremely competent"
"so so this guy doesn't really care about"
"anybody else in this environment he's"
"going to do whatever he needs to do to"
"survive to proliferate he's going to go"
"where he wants he's going to eat what he"
"wants he dumps and"
"Trippi into the into back into the"
"environment so the the boundary of this"
"of this creature is right at the edge of"
"that cell that's all that it's concerned"
"with in terms of measuring and managing"
"events it's Auliya all its concerned"
"with so individual cells are highly"
"competent why would these things ever"
"get together to form a large a large"
"body right because because he's gonna"
"give up a lot if he's gonna become a"
"skin cell and sit there quietly at the"
"edge of an organism and eventually get"
"dropped off"
"you know he's sacrificing quite a bit so"
"this issue of how these very competent"
"cells with selfish behaviors get"
"together is is pretty important and they"
"do get together in a remarkable way so"
"this is an early early embryo with a"
"bunch of blastomeres and then pretty"
"soon it becomes this is a cross-section"
"from a human torso and you can see the"
"amazing invariant distribution of all"
"the tissues that that these cells have"
"to make and it's basically does the same"
"thing every single time so where does"
"this pattern actually come from because"
"these these cells they get together and"
"they do something very important they"
"have to reproduce the same anatomical"
"structure each time during development"
"and then they have to maintain it during"
"adults so in my group we think about"
"questions like where Anatomy comes from"
"how individual cell groups know what to"
"make and when to stop and what happens"
"when this process breaks down that's"
"cancer we also think about it as"
"engineers in terms of how do we get"
"these cells to build something different"
"and then regenerative applications and"
"so on"
"so so this is so so so what's really I"
"think interesting to keep in mind is"
"that pattern control is a really"
"fundamental problem in biomedicine"
"because if we had control over"
"large-scale three-dimensional structure"
"we really could have the solution to"
"birth defects traumatic injury cancer"
"degenerative disease aging creation of"
"synthetic living machines almost"
"everything with the exception of perhaps"
"infectious disease could be handled if"
"we really understood how to make cells"
"build what we want them to build so what"
"I'm gonna do today is talk to you about"
"bodies as information processing"
"constructs that create remodel and"
"repair complex shapes we're gonna talk"
"about some key knowledge gaps that I"
"think are gonna end up being very"
"relevant to both development and the"
"cancer problem specifically we'll talk"
"about the bioelectric code which is the"
"way that information is processed"
"electrically in cells and tissues and"
"then talk about some future applications"
"so this is development we all start life"
"as a single cell this reliably self"
"assembles into one of these many"
"anatomies sometimes this process goes"
"wrong but this this this is a teratoma"
"and this is very interesting to"
"developmental biologists because in this"
"kind of scenario this this thing has"
"teeth and and skin and hair and but"
"pieces of bone and muscle and so on and"
"so cell differentiation proceeded okay"
"so so there's no problem with cell"
"differentiation the problem is with the"
"three-dimensional arrangement so the"
"reason this is different from that is"
"that even though you have all your all"
"your cell types they're not arranged in"
"the in the correct three-dimensional"
"organization with each other so this"
"tells you that even if we understood all"
"the mechanisms that take cells down"
"specific lineages to form different"
"types of tissues that's still not the"
"same as understanding the difference"
"between between cancer and normal normal"
"embryogenesis so this is the sort of"
"thing that many people think about in"
"developmental biology where it's sort of"
"an open-loop feed-forward system where"
"you have some gene regulatory networks"
"some of these genes make proteins there"
"are some physics by which these proteins"
"interact perhaps adhesion and and so on"
"and then there's this magical process of"
"emergence whereby lots of different"
"cells interact with each other under"
"these rules and eventually something"
"like this comes out and so so that's"
"kind of a feed-forward way of looking at"
"things but here's something very"
"interesting actually patterning is not"
"an open-loop system so if you split an"
"early embryo you don't get to half"
"embryos you get to perfectly normal"
"normal monozygotic twins so each half"
"knows exactly what's missing and it can"
"reproduce the missing part you can do"
"the opposite and you can actually smush"
"embryos together at early stages and you"
"get a perfectly normal animal out the"
"other end so this is this is amazing"
"plasticity we don't again have any any"
"artifacts that behave this way there's"
"nothing we have that you can cut in half"
"and you can have two two working working"
"copies so beyond embryo Genesis this is"
"regeneration so some animals like this"
"axolotl this salamander can regenerate"
"its eyes its limbs its ovaries its jaws"
"its heart"
"and portions of the brain spinal cord"
"and so on incredibly highly regenerative"
"during its during its lifespan here you"
"can see what happens when you amputate a"
"leg so over time exactly an"
"indistinguishable limb will appear one"
"of the most amazing things about"
"regeneration lots of people are working"
"on how to augment regeneration and"
"humans let's say one of the really"
"critical questions is why does it stop"
"so this is a system that has a very"
"rapid cell proliferation and all kinds"
"of things go on but when it finishes"
"making a normal axolotl limb everything"
"grinds to a halt and it stops so this is"
"a system that knows what a proper"
"axolotl limb looks like because that"
"serves as a stop condition to all these"
"processes so we really need to"
"understand how that works and beyond"
"that there are other animals so this is"
"a planarian which you'll see some more"
"information about later but this is a"
"flatworm that actually you can cut into"
"many pieces and each piece gives rise to"
"a perfectly normal tiny little plain"
"area and then they will they will grow"
"and then you'll have many flat worms so"
"so every piece you can cut it anywhere"
"you like the record sometimes people"
"wonder how small can you get the record"
"is about 275 and every piece knows"
"exactly what's missing and can reproduce"
"exactly what's needed and to restore a"
"normal planaria now right away you see"
"that there's some very interesting"
"decisions that have to be made so for"
"example if you cut it like this just cut"
"it in half here these cells will grow to"
"make a tail these cells will grow to"
"make a head so notice that you have"
"completely different anatomical outcomes"
"from cells that were near neighbors they"
"were they were sitting right next to"
"each other so this is not a local"
"phenomenon you can't decide what your"
"gonna be head or tail just by knowing"
"your position will in the end within the"
"animal so these kind of positional"
"information models have a lot of work to"
"do because it's not enough to know where"
"you are you have to actually communicate"
"with the rest of the tissue and say well"
"the heads over here and there is a head"
"so I have to make a tail all these kinds"
"of things and we need to understand how"
"how that works important to know"
"regeneration is not just for so-called"
"lower animals so the human liver is"
"highly regenerative deer is an amazing"
"phenomenon although a terrible model"
"system unfortunately but so many times"
"I've tried to I've tried to get people"
"to take this up but um the thing is so"
"these guys large adult mammals they"
"regenerate and remember this is not a"
"horn this"
"an antler which means true bone"
"vasculature innervation the whole thing"
"up to a centimeter and a half of new"
"bone per day just think what I mean you"
"can almost see this growing when it's"
"coming out it's ridiculous rates of bone"
"growth and of course human children"
"regenerate their fingertips and then"
"they lose this ability somewhere between"
"7 and 11 so what we really have then is"
"this kind of a feedback system where"
"yeah there's this forward part but"
"there's actually very important feedback"
"both at the genetic and at the level of"
"physics which is this is the one I'm"
"gonna talk to you about today that"
"implements this sort of error detection"
"control loop that basically when some"
"some biological systems are deviated"
"from their correct Anatomy there are"
"feedbacks that that kick in that will"
"try to reduce the error and try to"
"undertake cellular activity that gets"
"back to the correct shape so this is"
"basically looks like a very simple um"
"homeostatic cycle this is we could we"
"call this pattern homeostasis so instead"
"of keeping to some parameter like"
"temperature or pressure or something"
"like that this is a homeostatic cycle"
"that that tries to restore correct"
"anatomical structures and if you think"
"about systems this way then you have to"
"ask two simple questions number one"
"could we rewrite the set point so every"
"anatomical system has a particular set"
"point and can we change that set point"
"and let the cells build something"
"different and and so could we could we"
"target this kind of this this"
"computational process instead of"
"rewiring some of this stuff could we"
"could we change the pattern to which"
"these cells are working so what we would"
"like to do is in addition to this is"
"kind of a mainstream task everybody's"
"doing this explain the sort of the finer"
"mechanistic details of how cells become"
"other cell types and so on but really we"
"want to understand also the information"
"processing that allows cells to"
"coordinate their behavior towards a"
"large-scale goal system level goals"
"tissues organs and so on we have some"
"fundamental gaps in our understanding"
"here which are not often thought about"
"most of us when when during our lifetime"
"if you have a mutation somewhere in your"
"body this is not passed on to your"
"offspring okay and so so that sort of"
"keeps the the lineage but more or less"
"clean planaria do something completely"
"different most planaria"
"most of the time though the planarian"
"reproduced by a by fission so they tear"
"themselves in half each half regenerates"
"and now you've got two worms but that's"
"an amazing thing because that's somatic"
"inheritance this means that mutations"
"that you have in your body do propagate"
"if they don't kill this L do propagate"
"to the next generation and so in fact"
"planaria and genomes are an incredible"
"mess okay so so you can't even really"
"ask how many chromosomes this animal has"
"because they're mixed deployed every"
"cell has a different number of"
"chromosomes and and their genomes are"
"just an incredible mess so what is that"
"telling us about the relationship"
"between genomes and anatomy if the"
"genome can get really pretty trash over"
"four to 500 million years of somatic"
"inheritance but the pattern of"
"regeneration is perfect every single"
"time okay so so that's kind of amazing"
"you know we we don't we people tend to"
"think about a pretty tight relationship"
"between the genome and the anatomy but"
"something very interesting is going on"
"here so we really don't understand at"
"all how this is so we're getting better"
"at the mechanisms but we really don't"
"understand some of the algorithms that"
"determine these large-scale large-scale"
"structures so the reason it's important"
"of course is because this is the kind of"
"thing we're pretty good at now is"
"deriving gene regulatory networks and so"
"on what we really want to understand"
"predict and control is this"
"three-dimensional structure and so what"
"I think is that we're getting very good"
"at manipulating molecules and cells but"
"we're a long way off from from"
"understanding how to control specific"
"specific patterns and it's important and"
"one way to think about what happened"
"here is that this this is a very"
"interesting picture this is what"
"programming looked like in the 40s okay"
"and the reason this is interesting is"
"because in order to program she is"
"rewiring the hardware she is literally"
"moving wires around because that's how"
"you have to program back then now the"
"reason we have this amazing revolution"
"and information technology is because we"
"went from this to machine code and now"
"to the point where if you wanted to"
"program you don't need to know anything"
"about your hardware you may not have any"
"idea where your hardware is it might be"
"virtualized that you don't know what"
"you're running on but what you can do is"
"you can focus on the control algorithm"
"you can focus on talking to your system"
"at the level at which you could really"
"describe what you want it to do"
"and that's because computer science"
"really understood the distinction"
"between software and hardware and you'll"
"see how this theme develops in the rest"
"of the talk I think it's very important"
"that what we're what what most biology"
"does now is this we're all about the"
"hardware we love rewiring a"
"transcriptional networks single molecule"
"kind of approaches all of that is is"
"interacting with the system at the level"
"of hardware and I think there's there's"
"a complementary approach which computer"
"science took decades ago in which we can"
"we can start thinking about so so let's"
"think about cancer as an example of some"
"of this there are lots of different"
"views of cancer I'm certainly not gonna"
"argue that cancer is a single single"
"thing there probably many different"
"aspects to it but this guy had an"
"interesting quote that sort of"
"summarizes our our view of this that"
"basically what he's saying is that it's"
"not a disease of cells any more than a"
"traffic jam as a disease of individual"
"cars so it's a way to think about system"
"level disorders that don't necessarily"
"have anything to do with the mechanics"
"of how the individual pieces do what"
"they do it's more of an information /"
"computational problem so what I'm going"
"to talk about is this this idea that"
"that at least some cancers are a"
"developmental disease they're almost a"
"disease of geometry in a sense there are"
"they're a disorder of how cells interact"
"with the field of information that tells"
"them what to do and keeps their activity"
"orchestrated towards the anatomical"
"needs above a large host and so you can"
"speak cells yes cells communication with"
"other cells and with their environment"
"so some of the some of the important"
"aspects of the environment are probably"
"probably not cellular but you know other"
"types of molecules and so on but yeah"
"it's AI would agree with that I think I"
"think it is fundamentally a"
"communication issue yeah yeah so so you"
"can start thinking about some"
"predictions of these ideas so for"
"example if we think about a lot"
"oftentimes people ask us also why do"
"human bodies have reduced regenerative"
"potential and you know we're not we're"
"not like salamanders"
"so on so so there's two ways to think"
"about this if you are focused on things"
"like cell cycle checkpoints such"
"tgf-beta x' and and so on controls at"
"the single cell level then what you"
"might say is the reason we are not"
"highly regenerative is because if you're"
"a long-lived organism with ready access"
"to the kind of proliferative cells that"
"you would need in order to regenerate"
"that you'd be you'd have a high"
"carcinogenic load that basically the"
"cost of cancer over the lifespan would"
"be too high so in order to avoid that"
"we've really cranked down all those"
"mechanisms so when on that view cancer"
"and and regeneration should go together"
"that is animals that are good at"
"regenerating should be susceptible to"
"cancer there's a different way to think"
"about this which is which you could say"
"if you're focused on the morphogen etic"
"control systems you could say that"
"organisms that are actually good at"
"being plastic and controlling their"
"their anatomical structures might"
"actually be able to resist cancer by"
"continuously reinforcing the"
"communication with cells that makes them"
"do whatever they're supposed to be doing"
"and so on that view you should have"
"regeneration and cancer being"
"anti-correlated okay and so so here's an"
"example where the perspective a sort of"
"top-down versus bottom-up perspective"
"make different predictions so it's not"
"just philosophy to make actually"
"different predictions and so it turns"
"out actually that this is that this is"
"the correct the correct relationship so"
"so animals that are highly regenerative"
"have generally have very low incidences"
"of cancer and in many cases processes"
"like embryonic development and also"
"regeneration tend to normalize or"
"convert tumors into normal tissues so"
"this was shown years ago in salamander"
"limbs and also in in mouse embryos where"
"you can take aggressive carcinomas to"
"come into an early mouse embryo and they"
"basically end up contributing as normal"
"cells to the most correct right right so"
"there are some costs to regeneration as"
"well and I can tell you so nobody knows"
"they're the real answers nobody knows"
"but I can tell you I can tell you a"
"story about"
"mammals let's say if you are an early"
"mammal you know something Mouse like"
"you're running around the forest and"
"somebody bites your leg off problem is"
"you have a couple problems problem"
"number one is you're gonna bleed out you"
"have a high high blood pressure you are"
"you know you"
"salamanders can sort of hang out for"
"long periods of time and you know six"
"months later they'll get it they'll get"
"it like so so the mammalian version of"
"this is you need to clot you need to"
"scar you need to seal it or you're not"
"gonna be around long enough to to"
"regenerate the other thing is that"
"unlike these animals that are aquatic so"
"so most of the good regenerators are"
"aquatic and and I think there are two"
"reasons for that one is that in in an"
"aqueous environment the limb doesn't"
"have to be load-bearing you're not"
"trying to step on it you know you're not"
"gonna regenerate much of a bless team if"
"you're constantly grinding it into the"
"forest floor as you're as you're walking"
"around the other thing is that and"
"actually the one example of mammals that"
"are highly regenerative the deer it's"
"not the legs that regenerate it's the"
"it's the antlers which which experience"
"no pressure at all the other thing that"
"that I think it really helps about being"
"aquatic which we'll get to in a minute"
"is the fact that in water you can more"
"easily Drive a lot of the by electric"
"currents that you actually need to"
"kick-start this so I think what mammals"
"have done is simply said it's it's not"
"useful enough we just really need to go"
"the scarring route and they went towards"
"scarring clotting"
"you know inflammation all that kind of"
"stuff so so that's it but but but I"
"don't have any proof of that that's just"
"the story that is a great question I'm"
"not sure anybody's allowed to check if a"
"dolphin or a whale is regenerative but"
"it might be a good it's a great question"
"I don't know but but record keep in mind"
"that all of them went through a land"
"face right as far as I know and so so I"
"think they may have not regained it or"
"they may have unclear unclear skin is"
"you know skin scarring is also not quite"
"the same as regeneration and we can get"
"we can get back to in in some senses it"
"might be easier to actually regenerate a"
"structure than to heal skin and we can"
"we can talk later about what that might"
"be but this is very much an open"
question
"has any idea why regeneration is very"
"sort of sporadically sprinkled around"
"it's not like that all those simple"
"organisms regenerated in the complex"
"it's really not that at all it's it's"
"there our sister species of crabs or one"
"regenerates and one doesn't regenerate"
"anything it's very three strange okay so"
"okay so so so one of the ideas then is"
"that at this at this way of thinking"
"about things that's that's sort of at"
"the center of development regeneration"
"and cancer is that if it is a problem of"
"communication and not some sort of"
"irrevocable defect in a specific founder"
"cell then what you might be able to do"
"is reboot the patterning program which"
"would would be an alternative method to"
"killing chemotherapy which it has aside"
"from the toxicity it also you you can"
"evolve to more resistance you can avoid"
"you can activate a compensatory"
"proliferation response all kinds of"
"things it would be nice if we could"
"reprogram these cells instead of having"
"to track all of them down and killing"
"them so what we're interested in then is"
"asking you so what are these signals"
"that keep cells working towards a normal"
"Anatomy because if you knew what those"
"were maybe you could re reactivate them"
"during during the instances of cancer so"
"we all cells in the body are embedded in"
"this in this Morpho genetic field it's"
"basically just the sum total of all the"
"information that comes at cells that's"
"telling them what to do when this"
"information comes at them within"
"different flavors there's obviously"
"chemical signals extracellular matrix"
"tension stresses pressures oxygen"
"gradients lots of different things the"
"one we're going to talk about is by"
"electrical it's sort of my favorite"
"element it's just but but but the reason"
"I put this up here is that if I spend"
"the next half hour talking about by"
"electricity it's not because I think by"
"electricity does everything it's because"
"it's an important layer of them of a"
"very complex informational structure so"
"let's talk about by electricity and what"
"that is everybody's used to the story of"
"neuroscience which is that the brain"
"consists of some hardware or Hardware is"
"basically these cells that have ion"
"channels in the plasma membrane they"
"allow each cell to acquire some resting"
"potential and then this may or may not"
"get propagated to neighbors through open"
"gap junctions and so we've got these"
"networks of cells that set their"
"electrical potential as a function of"
"their own"
"and their neighbors activity okay that's"
"that's the hardware the software is this"
"what you're seeing here is this is a"
"zebrafish brain and it's the activity"
"the electrical activity here is whatever"
"is representing whatever it is that the"
"fish is currently thinking about and so"
"there's this there's this effort of"
"neural decoding the idea is that if we"
"understood what we were doing we could"
"look at this electrical activity and"
"extract from it computationally the"
"cognitive state of that of that mind"
"that we would know we would know what"
"the what the the animal was thinking"
"about or visualizing and people have"
"done this in animals and human subjects"
"to some extent and the idea is that we"
"want to be able to read out the"
"information content of the electrical"
"activity of this tissue okay"
"so it turns out that this is not just a"
"story about brains all cells do this so"
"all cells have ion channels most cells"
"have gap junctions or these electrical"
"synapses and in fact you can see here"
"this is an early frog embryo and the and"
"the the pseudo coloring shows you the"
"voltage gradients of all the different"
"cells as they communicate with each"
"other to figure out who's going to be"
"left who's going to be right dorsal"
"ventral anterior posterior and our goal"
"is very similar we want to understand"
"this electrical language and figure out"
"the the information content of the"
"signals so that we know what at what"
"anatomical structures they're making"
"okay it's very very parallel and the"
"reason it's parallel is because all of"
"this stuff didn't just sort of emerge"
"out of nowhere all of the tricks that"
"the brain has evolved by speed"
"optimizing much more ancient electrical"
"properties that have been around since"
"the time of bacteria so all cells have"
"been doing this kind of information"
"processing long before neurons showed up"
"so so by electricity"
"then the kind of we're talking about is"
"slow voltage changes across endogenous"
"endogenously produced changes across"
"tissues not rapid action potential"
"spiking and no external electromagnetic"
"component so this is not at all like"
"what happens when you hold your cell"
"phone up for too long next year head the"
"in in in developmental by electricity"
"there's no magnetic component really and"
"and it's not external it's all"
"endogenous phenomena so in"
"single at the single cell level already"
"in the 70s people understood a really"
"interesting relationship which is that"
"if you simply plot a bunch of different"
"cell types on this axis from depolarized"
"here to hyperpolarized you see an"
"interesting grouping that you're mature"
"quiescent terminally differentiated"
"cells tend to set up here you are a"
"proliferative embryonic cells stem cells"
"and cancer cells tend to live down here"
"and then liver is an interesting sort of"
"in-between case probably not a"
"coincidence that it's the one really"
"plastic a regenerative organ so this is"
"now at the at the single cell level and"
"what's interesting is that this is not"
"just an epiphenomenon people have shown"
"that you can take cells and and and and"
"alter their proliferative and and"
"plastic differentiation potential by"
"altering the resting potential so you"
"can drive cells in this direction or in"
"that direction by controlling the by"
"electric sort of a control knob for"
"overall plasticity so we developed some"
"some strategies for looking at this in"
"vivo now to think about a large-scale"
"types of things so here is the flank of"
"a tackle it's been soaked with a voltage"
"sensitive fluorescent dye each one of"
"these little things is a single cell"
"bunch of ion channels here setting the"
"potential and you can see what we call a"
"vmm pattern so there's an anatomical"
"gradient between d polar the the"
"anterior and the posterior of the animal"
"that shows you there's some interesting"
"patterns and this is one snapshot but of"
"course we can make movies of this and"
"and do this in in real time and then any"
"changes in this pattern is a is a bio"
"electrical signal a change and these by"
"electrical signals come in two flavors"
"one are the endogenous normal ones that"
"are important for development so here"
"this is unfortunately grayscale but you"
"can see here what's happening this is"
"this is an early embryo"
"I'm putting its face together and oh"
"this is one one frame out of that movie"
"in which you can see is that even before"
"all the genes come on that determine"
"where the eyes are going to be the mouth"
"of plaque codes and so on there is a by"
"electrical pre pattern that sort of"
"shows you where all that's going to be"
"and if you artificially move these"
"domains these are these these do these"
"areas of differential vmm if you move"
"them optogenetic lee or in other ways"
"the gene expression will"
"and the anatomy will follow so you can"
"radically rearrange the frog face by"
"messing with this pattern and so this is"
"an endogenous pattern that is the normal"
"part of how the embryo lays out where"
"its various structures are going to be"
"on this nascent ectoderm if you do"
"calcium imaging you get a very different"
"pattern there is a calcium imaging"
"pattern but it's completely different"
"and we've just started I'm looking into"
"this the thing with this with this"
"pattern okay so the calcium pattern is"
"very very spiky you know it's lots of"
"flashing and this is a very steady you"
"know this so this is time elapsed and so"
"so this is this pattern sits there for"
"hours so the calcium I think is"
"responding to a different timescale of"
"events so so we need it did you have"
"yeah that's absolutely true one eye one"
"eye always comes first that's actually"
"true yeah yeah well not one eye comes"
"first yep so so that's an interesting"
"question where do these patterns come"
"from so there are definitely channels"
"that are required for this to happen but"
"if you look at where the channels are"
"expressed they are not expressed in this"
"pattern so the pattern does not come"
"from the spatial distribution of the RNA"
"the pattern it comes from a what"
"channels are there but be from"
"spontaneous symmetry breaking and"
"self-organization of this pattern I"
"think touring patterns it's a little"
"like that yeah okay so so so these are"
"the endogenous paths but there's also"
"pathological patterns so here's an"
"embryo that was injected with mRNA"
"encoding various human oncogene x' this"
"one I forget if it was a chaos mutation"
"probably so so what happens is"
"eventually you will get these these"
"these tumors and eventually they'll"
"spread and so on but before you get this"
"you can already see with a voltage die"
"you can already see where the cells are"
"depolarizing one of the first things"
"they do when they start expressing these"
"oncogenes is they depolarize they shut"
"off the gap junctions to their neighbors"
"and they sort of revert back to this"
"almost unicellular past where if they're"
"if they're uncoupled with the rest of"
"the animal then they treat the rest of"
"the body as just"
"they go where they want they proliferate"
"as much as they want it's really in a"
"computational sense it's a shrinking of"
"the of the boundary of the self it's a"
"it's a weird way to think about it but I"
"think it's helpful because otherwise all"
"of these cells normally are responding"
"to cues about things much bigger than"
"themselves they're trying to maintain a"
"muscle you know muscle Chevron's or or"
"blood vessels or something else and"
"they're constantly being told what to do"
"to maintain this this large scale"
"structure these these cells are only"
"going to worry about themselves from now"
"on they're only going to measure and act"
"on things in their own immediate"
"immediate environment and they're going"
"to start to we you know leave this area"
"and go somewhere else and proliferate as"
"much as they can so it's the gap"
"junctions so it's the gap junction so"
"it's a loss of gap Junction connectivity"
"so so so the first physiological and"
"eventually transcriptional so eventually"
"they will actually change their"
"transcriptional profile but the first"
"thing they do is that the existing gap"
"junctions just shut down and you can see"
"this directly web dies you can put in"
"small fluorescent dyes and you can just"
"see you can just see that they've"
"stopped communicating with the rest of"
"the the rest of the animal well nothing"
"is do it nothing is direct as far as I"
"know there there's there are some steps"
"in between but it's it's it's direct in"
"the sense that it's it's very strong and"
"reliable it's not direct in the sense"
"that I don't believe the k RS protein"
"itself you know sort of binds the gap"
"Junction I think there's some stuff in"
"between but but yes that's exactly what"
"happens so these are these these so and"
"we've looked at a variety of oncogenes"
"and and it's a kind of a common factor"
"they all they all just shut it down"
"that's a great question that's a great"
"question hang on to that for about five"
"minutes we're gonna get into a non-local"
"effects here so that that's entirely"
"possible yeah"
"so okay so so I wonder if Li show you"
"some tools that we use because because"
"one of the things people often people"
"are unfamiliar with how one studies to"
"these by electrical signals so the first"
"thing we do is we have ways of tracking"
"this with voltage dyes and of course now"
"there's a genetically encoded to voltage"
"report of proteins and so on so you want"
"to be able to track these states then we"
"do a lot of quantitative simulations so"
"we have a particular tool that has been"
"developed that I'll mention towards the"
"end that allows us to take the knowledge"
"of which ion channels and pumps are"
"expressed in a particular cell and to"
"figure out well k well what is the"
"resting potential going to be then right"
"it's a very non-trivial non-trivial"
"thing and then really important are the"
"functional tools so if we have some sort"
"of network of non neural cells here we"
"basically can do one of two things we"
"can control the topology of the network"
"so we can take these gap junctions in"
"either genetically or pharmacologically"
"we can we can either close them or open"
"them introduce new ones and put in"
"mutants of gap junctions so so we can"
"control which cells talk to which other"
"cells or we can control directly the"
"electrical state of individual cells so"
"again with drug blockers or putting in"
"new channels or optogenetic lis we can"
"control the individual state of these"
"cells so so in neuroscience this is"
"roughly equivalent to synaptic and"
"intrinsic plasticity that we can we can"
"control let me show you a couple of"
"examples of why this is important and"
"sort of warm up the idea that that these"
"these electrical communications actually"
matter
"so one thing we discovered long ago is"
"that because and eventually we"
"discovered that that Danny Adams in my"
"group discovered this electric face"
"phenomenon we found out that if you if"
"you simply Express of variety of ion"
"channels in regions of the embryo that"
"are going to give rise to tissues"
"outside of the head so here's themselves"
"that are gonna give rise to this gut and"
"we throw in some kV one point five"
"channel remarkably this this portion of"
"the gut now forms an eye and this is"
"pretty pretty amazing for a couple of"
"reasons number one it was thought before"
"based on experiments with the master I"
"gene pack six that only tissues up here"
"in the anterior directed are more"
"competent to become I so that's not true"
"you can make eyes out of almost anything"
"we've made eyes in spinal cord we've"
"made eyes out of"
"you know gut and so so that's pretty"
"interesting it's not really thought that"
"that ended or I'm supposed to be able to"
"make eyes and the other thing that's"
"interesting is they have all the same"
"tissue layers that you would expect lens"
"right and all that so the other thing"
"they are they are functioning oh that"
"that's a whole separate thing we can"
"talk about we've done we've done a whole"
"study of of plasticity of brain"
"plasticity and it turns out that you can"
"put eyes on the tail of a tadpole of"
"that's otherwise blind and that animal"
"will absolutely see out of that eye so"
"the brain the plasticity is amazing the"
"brain the brain that evolves for"
"millions of years to expect visual input"
"from this part of the body can suddenly"
"see how there's this weird itchy patch"
"of tissue on my tail I know what that is"
"that's visual data and and just do color"
"you know recognition and and and image"
"will you know they have some image"
"forming ability it's it's pretty amazing"
"yeah but the other thing that's pretty"
"cool about this is that notice the"
"modularity here in other words what we"
"did not have to do is go in and and and"
"micromanage the the construction of the"
"eye and to say okay I want some lens"
"here I want some optic nerve here we"
"don't know how to do that we have no"
"idea how to do that so you know if so"
"what's interesting to me is that this is"
"this is a very modular effect that you"
"can basically basically what I think we"
"found is is almost like a subroutine"
"call of saying build an eye right here"
"and there's a particular state that"
"induces eye formation the animal already"
"knows how to make an eye and you really"
"don't need to know all the steps of how"
"it happens in order to trigger this and"
"another example of that is here the"
"planaria you've got your head and tail"
"here's the middle fragment the middle"
"fragment is very interesting by"
"electrical gradient that tells it where"
"the head and the tail are supposed to go"
"and if you go and depolarize this end to"
"match that and these cells will happily"
"decide that they need to now make a head"
"and now you have this two-headed animal"
"and again we didn't have to go in and"
"say here's how you build a planarian"
"head and you need 17 different cell"
"types we have no idea how to do that but"
"what you can do is specify where the"
"particular things go so what's"
"interesting to me about this is that we"
"clearly there's clearly a way to specify"
"pattern at the level of organs so this"
"is not individual cell information we're"
"not controlling the differentiation of"
"individual cells were actually"
"specifying organ level information and"
"so this is a system that actually has"
"ways to"
"interpret organ level organ level"
"specification oh yeah you can absolutely"
"yeah absolutely so so people have so so"
"violent race today is very rich history"
"people have been have been thinking"
"about this stuff for for well over 100"
"years Thomas Hunt Morgan has experiments"
"and buy electricity from 1902 or"
"something like that so what people used"
"to do is back back in the day when we"
"didn't have all the fine-scale control"
"over the over the voltage gradient"
"people would would do one of two things"
"they would either apply electric fields"
"to living systems or they would shunt"
"native fields in both of them and"
"chicken was a popular model so in both"
"of those cases absolutely you can by"
"applying fields you can for example flip"
"dorsal-ventral polarity of the early"
"chick embryo so Claudio Stern did that"
"in the 80s or by shunting the existing"
"field in the limb or the tail you can"
"prevent both of those structures from"
"having normal morphology the problem is"
"the control the control that you have by"
"manipulating the actual electric field"
"is pretty low so so it's a sledgehammer"
"you can you can screw things up but it's"
"really hard to do anything like this"
"this this stuff basically is only"
"possible because we now have control"
"over the vmm gradients which is very"
"hard to do with electrodes electrodes"
"are just not a great modality for this"
"yes yes yes so yeah so so that would be"
"an hour another hour of attack so I"
"didn't bring all that stuff but I'll"
"give you I'll give you a rough rough"
"idea so we have we have two levels of"
"analysis that we've been doing and one"
"is to simply make a computational model"
"of an on neural electric tissue and if"
"you do that and so Adam Cohen certainly"
"has done that and we are now doing it"
"you know for these kind of cases what"
"you see is that there are absolutely"
"system level rules about how electrical"
"patterns break symmetry how they"
"propagate how you establish boundaries"
"the size control all of"
"these kinds of things the other way to"
"think about it which we're also doing is"
"if you think about what people have done"
"in computational neuroscience in terms"
"of artificial neural networks so you"
"have this feel of an ends where you can"
"actually you have this whole canoe all"
"these ideas of connectionism where you"
"can sort of say okay here's how we train"
"a neural network here's how the"
"information is represented here's the"
"fact that the intermediate layers"
"progressively abstract from the input"
"then people have done this in a retina"
"and various other places so what we are"
"doing and I have a postdoc who's done"
"some very nice work on this"
"we're just submitting it in that next"
"month his his first work on this is this"
"idea that you can actually take all the"
"the basic results of connectionist"
"thought and abstract it away from"
"neurons there's really nothing neural"
"about any of that stuff and you can"
"relax a lot of assumptions that are"
"typically made in those kind of networks"
"as far as topology and various other"
"things and what you can show is that"
"similar methods of storing memories"
"learning training propagate reducing"
"error you know error minimization all of"
"these get logic gates you can make logic"
"gates all of these kinds of things are"
"easily implementable in non neural"
"bioelectric networks so there are much"
"like in the brain there are multiple"
"levels you can you can track the"
"physiology in great detail and just to"
"see waves propagate and so on or you can"
"ask what's the computational function of"
"this thing and you can actually see"
"pattern recognition I mean he built he"
"literally built a pattern recognizer out"
"of these non neural networks which is"
"very important because question number"
"one is the the axolotl has been damaged"
"how does it know if the patterns correct"
"or incorrect it has to be able to"
"compare so so function number one is to"
"be able to compare one sort of the set"
"of data to another set of data and say"
"how far off are we and can we minimize"
"that distance so you actually build that"
"fairly easily it turns out right so so"
"one of the things you can do and I'll"
"show you a screenshot from this"
"simulation platform but but we have a"
"simulation platform where you have a"
"two-dimensional tissue and you can load"
"in whatever ion channels you think it"
"has and then just say go and it will"
"sort of just"
"whatever whatever is going on one of the"
"things you can ask it to do is to show"
"you all the gap Junction connections and"
"if you do that what you'll find out is"
"that there's a lot of regionalization so"
"so that's true we don't really have"
"although even that's not quite right"
"some some cells do there are these"
"tunneling nanotubes I know if you've"
"seen the stuff that reach yeah there is"
"so some cells make these really weird"
"projections they're they're extensions"
"of the cell membrane that have one gap"
"junction at the end at the end it's like"
"a tube and and it reaches I think maybe"
"on the level on the scale of like 10"
"cell diameter some of they're so not"
"super long but but but I don't think any"
"of that is necessary I think that's"
"icing on the cake I think the important"
"part is that even in the sheet of flat"
"sheet of cells where every cell is only"
"next to its neighbors what you see is"
"that there are long range gap Junction"
"or paths and I'm gonna show you some"
"long-range data in a minute to show how"
"the information actually gets across but"
"basically what you will have is these"
"paths they're less they're much less"
"linear than then in a typical neural"
"network but I'm not even sure how linear"
"that is between the astrocytes and"
"everything else right like I don't I'm"
"not sure how linear that that classic"
"thing is anyway okay so so so moving"
"forward with this modular idea were very"
"interested in regenerative medicine so"
"we were we took this frog on like a"
"salamander the frogs and we generate"
"either nothing or a hypo morphic spike"
"so 45 days later here you see at the"
"stage you see nothing and then what we"
"were able to do is design a cocktail"
"that we apply that would basically"
"trigger a leg regeneration program here"
"and what you see is that you you up"
"regulate some some MSX one here at the"
"wound you start growing a leg and this"
"leg is touch sensitive and motile so the"
"animal can can feel and can use that leg"
"and eventually you get a pretty pretty"
"pretty pretty good leg here"
"this is an early unfortunately this"
"process takes months and so people love"
"taking early pictures of this because"
"nobody wants to wait nine months to get"
"to the end so you can see this leg is"
"pretty short but eventually it grows and"
"you've got you've got a toenail and some"
"toes so so so we're in the process now"
"with David Caplin our collaborator of"
"trying to transition this to mammal so"
"he makes these bio reactors that are"
"basically going to provide an aqueous"
"almost amniotic like environment for"
"these wounds and then our job is to so"
"he makes the devices our job is to come"
"up with a cocktail of I uncheck all"
"drugs to get this to happen so stay"
"tuned for that I don't have"
"most like to show you yet but hopefully"
"so so another thing we've done is to use"
"this in the in the in the sort of field"
"of Rick trying to repair on birth"
"defects and I only have one slide of a"
"very long project but the bottom line is"
"that remember that electric face pattern"
"that I showed you so there's a similar"
"pattern for the brain so if you look"
"down at how the brain develops there are"
"very specific bioelectric patterns that"
"tell you where the edges of the brain"
"are going to be and many things that"
"screw up brain development like"
"teratogen so alcohol think fetal alcohol"
"syndrome your nicotine these nasty"
"things that so or in fact mutations and"
"important genes like knotch"
"one of the first things that happens is"
"those those bioelectric patterns get get"
"perturbed and so what we did was we"
"built a this was the work of i popeye"
"who's a scientist in our group and"
"alexis pi talked our collaborator they"
"built a computational model of these of"
"these electrical patterns and they asked"
"a simple question"
"when these patterns get messed up by"
"these various drugs or or mutations what"
"can we do to put them back to normal"
"okay and it's a very non obvious thing"
"because a lot of these channels as you"
"all know there are there's complex"
"gating voltage gating and so everything"
"is sort of nonlinear it's very hard to"
"know what to do but the simulation"
"handles it and you can ask the question"
"of what would be an intervention that"
"would get the bioelectric pattern back"
"to normal so the amazing thing and so"
"and so it gave us some some options we"
"then went a so it said okay if you miss"
"express this particular channel or or"
"open this other channel things will the"
"pattern will correct itself we went and"
"tried it really remarkable when these"
"models produce something that actually"
"works on something so complex so this is"
"what a tadpole brain looks like in a"
"normal case here's the forebrain"
"midbrain and hindbrain here's a tadpole"
"that's expressing a dominant notch"
"mutation so as you would expect the"
"brain is all screwed up so the forebrain"
"is gone the midbrain is a bubble the"
"hind brain is a big mess here and"
"despite the fact that the notch mutation"
"is there you can get a pretty normal"
"brain structure brain gene expression"
"and behavior so so what we do is we"
"measure IQ by training them on a"
"behavioral asset you have tadpoles have"
"an IQ and and you can actually measure"
"so the ones with these kind"
"defects have basically 0iq they learn"
"nothing these guys are put back to"
"normal performance simply by reinforcing"
"that particular by electric pattern so"
"the important part so this is really"
"critical because the early days was"
"basically we see what you can mess up"
"right the idea was there we had these"
"patterns and if we scrub to buy"
"electrics things go wrong okay I mean"
"that's nice but what we now have that's"
"a lot a lot more important than that is"
"the computational portion of this is now"
"sufficiently good that we can actually"
"take a case of damage and fix it so that"
"we're back to a very normal structure so"
"I think that's that's a really important"
"step for this for this whole effort is"
"to go is to go beyond showing that these"
"things are necessary to actually develop"
"effective interventions temporarily so"
"they are for some amount of time the"
"thing with development is you wait long"
"enough everything's gonna change"
"anyway but but on the correct timescale"
"yes these are things what you want to do"
"is you want to push it there are"
"attractors for specific patterns and you"
"want to push this is so that's why they"
"come the modeling is so important"
"because you want to understand where"
"those attractors are and what you need"
"to do what are they gonna be stable to"
"and and so on okay so so so so what"
"we've talked about is that a lot of"
"important information is generated at"
"the physiological level sort of on the"
"fly and that manipulating some of this"
"and and and you know mind you we could"
"we could talk for many hours about other"
"other data that suggests this"
"manipulating the electrical"
"decision-making gives you some some"
"really pretty pretty amazing control"
"over growth and patterning that would be"
"very hard to duplicate with competing"
"approaches such as specific growth"
"factors and things like this so so now"
"so now I want to show you some of the"
"cancer specific some of the cancer"
"specific issues so basically I'm just"
"gonna show you very quickly three three"
"stories I'm gonna show you that by"
"electrical signatures could be a"
"diagnostic tool that you should be able"
"to induce cancer like phenotypes just by"
"modulating these gradients and I'm gonna"
"show you some suppression or repair and"
"just very quick"
"to say that I own transporters are"
"continuously being channels and pumps"
"are being implicated in cancer so"
"there's now a number of these that are"
"considered to be oncogenes and you can"
"see here in these in these databases"
"like this geo database you could see"
"what happens to certain channel"
"expressions as something moves from from"
"normal to - to malignancy but I want to"
"I want and some people there's people"
"that are very excited about this and"
"people that are using this kind of"
"profiling to try and fish out channels"
"that they consider drug targets okay the"
"problem is that you can't think of these"
"things in the way that you would a"
"transcription factor or a growth factor"
"these these channels they open and close"
"post translationally as a function of"
"the cell physiology so you can't merely"
"look at this and say oh well the"
"malignant version has it off so what I"
"want to do is turn it on here maybe but"
"maybe not it you can't it's not as"
"simple because these things are not"
"handled at the level of transcription"
"it's the physiological state not the"
"presence of the protein that's important"
"so there's some there's something some"
"issues with that we have to really deal"
"with with the physiology so so so here's"
"what a frog tumor looks like here you"
"can see it's attracted some blood"
"vessels that you could see the the blood"
"going and so so basically I've already"
"shown you this you can use by electric"
"dyes to know to determine where these"
"kind of these kinds of things are going"
"to take place and so there are some"
"obvious applications for diagnostics and"
"modalities to try to visualize tumor"
"margins maybe during surgery maybe as"
"you know look for pre cancer on the skin"
"and so on so the next story I want to"
"tell you about has to do with how can"
"you you can induce cancer without acqua"
"genes without DNA damage without"
"carcinogens so here's a neural crest"
"cell from Xenopus one of the things that"
"these guys make is melanocytes or"
"pigment cells and there's what normal"
"pigment cells look like right here and"
"so they're absent from these peri ocular"
"regions but you there's a small number"
"of these and what we found is that"
"there's a specific population of cells"
"in the embryo that if you disrupt their"
"electrical communication with their"
"neighbors one of the things that happens"
"is these mulana"
"sites which apparently depend on signals"
"from these other cells go completely"
"crazy you can see what happens here when"
"you do that and we do this with a with a"
"you can do this either with a miss"
"expression of a channel or a drug that"
"opens this glycine gated chloride"
"channel and these cells they over"
"proliferate so you can see there's way"
"more of them they they migrate into"
"these areas that are normally pretty"
"clear it's an M MP dependent process"
"like you would expect from for"
"metastasis and this is what they look"
"like so here's here's the cross-section"
"through a tackle here are normal"
"melanocytes small number of nice round"
"little melanocytes this is what"
"transformed melanocytes look like you"
"can see here they've got these crazy"
"long projections it's because they're"
"trying to dive into they invade the"
"neural tube they invade the lumen here"
"try to get into the brain they get all"
"into the the blood vessels here I mean"
"it's basically melanoma and remember"
"that that there's nothing genetically"
"wrong with these animals so now if you"
"sequence this or you look for markers"
"eventually they turn on slug and snail"
"and all these things that you would"
"expect to see in melanoma but originally"
"there's nothing wrong with there's"
"nothing wrong with any of these cells"
"per se all that's happened is a one"
"particular ion channel has left them"
"unable to communicate with these"
"Instructor cells there's also a a blood"
"vessel phenotype that you can see here"
"and so the interesting thing here is to"
"keep in mind is and this starts to get"
"at what you were asking before I'll show"
"you some more data on this keep in mind"
"that the cells that were electrically"
"targeted are not the cells that"
"responded so here in in this in this"
"blue lineage dye these are the cells"
"that were that were targeted these up"
"here are the cells that that transform"
"this is a long-range signaling event I"
"don't have a lot of time to go into it"
"what happens to be certain urgently"
"mediate it we took apart this whole"
"thing it has to do with that with with"
"serotonin and so on there's a lot of a"
"lot of actual detail about how that"
"works but this is this is a non cell"
"autonomous effect so what happens"
"electrically in one region has a lot of"
"implications for what cells do in"
"another region I'll show you more of"
"that in a moment so and so so then we"
"come to the opposite we said okay well"
"if if if the disruption of these"
"electrical signals is sufficient to"
"trigger the is this metastatic phenotype"
"can we do"
"opposite and suppress or reprogram"
"cancer by restoring normal electrical"
"properties so what we would do is we"
"would inject um human oncogene RNA and"
"Co inject a various ion channels to try"
"to get the force the cells to remain to"
"remain at normal vmm and what you see"
"here this is just one example we did"
"this for k our ass for 4l 3 for Glee and"
"so on p53 basically normal cells and"
"anion Kachinas red-tagged okay so so the"
"redtag cells are giving you these tumors"
"but even though the two in the case"
"where you co inject a particular channel"
"even though the cells are expressing the"
"the oncogene quite strongly there"
"doesn't have to be a tumor here and it's"
"a very significant suppression effect if"
"you force the the electrical properties"
"of these cells with a completely"
"exogenous channel that the oncogene"
"doesn't doesn't know how to how to turn"
"off it happens to be a constituent of"
"the active one then you can you can"
"maintain normal physiology and even"
"though even though you've got this this"
"oncogene you will not have a tumor so"
"this is this is another important area"
"where the sort of genetic information"
"diverges from what the actual phenotype"
"is because if you sequence this thing"
"you will find the the oncogenic mutation"
"and you will make a prediction that"
"you're gonna have a tumor and actually"
"you can't you won't know the right"
"answer until you you actually profile"
"the physiology so it's very important"
"that you can't predict these just by"
"protein or transcriptional profile alone"
"and so we've done this now also with"
"optogenetics so you can put in various"
"optogenetic channels and again depending"
"on how you light it up you can suppress"
"suppress tumorigenesis and so on so"
"really to drive this home this idea of"
"this dissociation between the outcome"
"and the and the end the genetics here's"
"an example where we basically we"
"introduce a particular sodium channel"
"and depending on how much actual sodium"
"we put into the medium you will either"
"get a tumor this really invasive thing"
"or you will get an ectopic i structure"
"and the difference between whether or"
"not you get a tumor or an eye is"
"literally the amount of sodium in the"
"water that's all so so that you know"
"that's a very like like simple"
"demonstration that the outcome is not"
"necessarily dictated by in both cases"
"the channel is exactly the same and so"
"and of course there's no DNA damage"
"anywhere here so to start to close up"
"I'm just going to show you a few"
"a few things where I think this is going"
"here's again this this theme of uh and"
"and this this this theme of genome"
"versus versus outcome but I think it's"
"very important the reason I harp on all"
"this stuff is just to underscore how"
"important this physiological layer is"
"that sits in between the the genetics"
"and the and the anatomy so so here's our"
"here's our two-headed worm that I showed"
"you and one of my students asked a"
"simple question in 2009 or so well so so"
"you've got this two-headed worm and you"
"wait a couple weeks the drug is gone"
"within 48 hours you wait a few weeks and"
"then what we're gonna do is we're going"
"to remove this this ectopic head we're"
"gonna remove the primary head we're"
"gonna leave just the nice normal gut"
"that has no no brain at all"
"whatever we teach in ethically"
"reprogrammed or whatever for the sec"
"topic head that's gone there's no"
"genomic editing that took place so"
"surely the sim would make a normal"
"embryo of a normal worm rather and so"
"because in theory the genome sets the"
"that's that's the structure so let's"
"let's do that and the reason I'm showing"
"this to you is because that's not at all"
"what happens what happens is that when"
"you do this what these worms are in"
"perpetuity 2-headed permits permanent"
"okay and so so think about what this"
"means again you sequence these guys all"
"you're gonna get is a normal dog aza"
"japonica genome there's nothing wrong"
"with their with their genomic sequence"
"the information about how many heads are"
"supposed to have is a property of an"
"electrical circuit that has at least two"
"states probably more so far we found two"
"one headed or two headed and you can"
"flip them back and forth and we know how"
"do we can take this guy and put them"
"back to one headed because it's a kind"
"of electrical memory circuit it"
"basically just holds that information"
"and there's other components that we now"
"know about side of skeletal structures"
"and and planar priority and so on that"
"are are driven by these changes and you"
"can set it back and back and forth and"
"so there's a and so it's very important"
"to note that a transient change in this"
"by electric network state can drive a"
"permanent re specification of the shape"
"to which this animal regenerates okay"
"and the idea is that this target"
"morphology the shape to which it"
"regenerates can be stable rewritten so"
"some of this important information is"
"not stored at the genomic level and so"
"so I only show you this as an example of"
"why we should be really targeting the"
"geological layers so I think that cancer"
"is not only a genetic disease but also a"
"disorder of pattern regulation which"
"takes place at the level of physiology"
"these by electric properties can be used"
"to detect induce and reprogram"
"neoplastic cell behavior at least in the"
"models that we've looked at we are now"
"moving all this to Muto to mammalian"
"cells and so on we'd like to do a lot"
"more of that and and I want to talk for"
"just a minute about these"
"pharmacological strategies so so this is"
"our this is just some snapshots of our"
"simulator this was the first the first"
"paper that came out she Alexis Patek"
"made this amazing system this whole"
"thing is free it's freely downloadable"
"you can you can you can get and play"
"with it but it's a it's an incredible"
"simulator of all this all this by"
"electrics and you can now start to ask"
"these questions of how the different"
"regions do or do not communicate with"
"each other and so on and to once again"
"talk about this long range and you were"
"saying you know how things are connected"
"here's that here's this a functional"
"example that here's a frog frog let"
"actually still got his tail what what my"
"student did was amputate one of the legs"
"because she wanted to look at the by"
"electrical signaling that was involved"
"in regeneration or not of this leg but"
"what she noticed was that the opposite"
"leg within 30 seconds the opposite leg"
"that you never touched undamaged would"
"light up exactly the same kind of signal"
"at about the same level of where the cut"
"was so within 30 seconds the opposite"
"untouched leg finds out where the damage"
"was and what kind of damage because you"
"can actually recover from from looking"
"at the signal you can recover"
"information about whether it was a stab"
"wound or a cut wound or what it was so"
"it that that information propagates"
"centimeters across and it does so edit"
"it's a very interesting speed it's it's"
"and actually so we know it's not i'm"
"knurled because you can take out the"
"spinal cord all here and it still gets"
"across it's not neroli mediated it's"
"it's slower than what neural conduction"
"would be but it's way faster than what"
"diffusion would be okay so that's a good"
"that's a great question yeah yeah we"
"were thinking about why okay so why does"
"the uncut leg need to do this and"
"there's a couple of options one option"
"is that it's it's using this as a"
"template of what it's going to do for"
"regeneration that's one possibility"
"another possibility is that this leg is"
"getting ready on the theory that"
"something just bit off one leg it"
"sparked it might still be around so is"
"there anything we could do to make life"
"better if he does decide to bite the"
"other leg so that's you know I mean"
"that's a hypothesis we have no idea if"
"that's if that's right so we're still"
"we're still you know this is this is"
"just a few months ago we um we published"
"this see I see yeah could well could"
"well be could well be yeah it could well"
"yeah we don't we don't know but one"
"thing this one thing this offers the"
"opportunity of doing is surrogates site"
"monitoring so the idea is if we didn't"
"have access to what was going on here"
"could we look at another part of the"
"animal and figure out what was going on"
"right how much can you tell from looking"
"at one portion and another we have all"
"kinds of experiments correct yeah which"
"makes perfect it makes perfect yeah yeah"
"I think that's but that's my guess right"
"now there's a couple of things we need"
"to rule out first the one thing we"
"haven't done this rule out of blood flow"
"yet we have to take out the heart and"
"make sure that it's not vascular you"
"know blood mediated I don't think it is"
"but we have to prove that but yeah we"
"think we think based on that and and"
"various other persistence we've dealt"
"with we think it's its propagation of"
"slow slow waves through the gap Junction"
"whole field right right the propagation"
"because because the propagation itself"
"might be it might be pulsatile it might"
"be calcium it might be like relay kind"
"of thing we don't we don't know yet what"
"is going through so so it's not"
"necessarily that it's a voltage itself"
"that's going through it could be small"
"second messengers it could be I'm pretty"
"partial to serotonin cuz it keeps"
"propping up it could be things that we"
"can't see it but by the time it gets to"
"where it's going it gets converted to"
"that that's what we think right now"
"absolutely not in fact in fact one of"
"the most common ways that by electrics"
"so in all these different projects we"
"always have to find out how does the"
"voltage change talk to the nucleation of"
"to transduce the voltage change and"
"sometimes it's calcium but about a third"
"of the time it's it's through serotonin"
"so it's it's a voltage dependent"
"movement of small molecule messengers"
"sometimes in butyrate that's a cool and"
"because that comes from bacteria and we"
"have a couple of stories now about"
"bacteria being part of the electric"
"circuit the bacteria the Norton"
"endogenous microbiome actually is part"
"of the electric circuit and and"
"regulates what happens downstream so"
"absolutely chemical relays are part of"
"this that's what makes this whole system"
"much slower than you know pure pure"
"neural so so one of the other"
"interesting things that we discovered"
"about this the by electrics is that we"
"saw this and we said boy you know this"
"works at quite a distance what happens"
"if we if we put the two more RNA on this"
"side but we put the hyperpolarizing"
"channel all the way over here and you"
"can see that even there even that way it"
"has an important effect on reducing the"
"number of actual tumors so you can and"
"now we understand we didn't understand"
"why before but we actually now have"
"quantitative models that show how by"
"electric states propagate across these"
"large distances so that it's not you"
"don't even have to treat the actual"
"tumor cells themselves the environment"
"is really important and so what you're"
"saying about the environment shutting"
"off that communication that that's"
"absolutely part of it and so we're now"
"designing these simulated systems to try"
"and basically understand how we can"
"target that yeah so this is just"
"something I said before is that because"
"these channels are opened in close"
"post-translationally I mean neuroscience"
"is pretty obvious that that you don't"
"need changes in gene expression to to to"
"run by electrical States but that's it's"
"really critical for the cancer biology"
"field to understand this that ion"
"channels are not cancer genes in the"
"sense that some of these other types of"
"genes are it's the physiology that"
"matters and you can't see this on"
"transcriptional or proteomic profiles"
"and so what we're doing now is we're"
"basically building a computational"
"platform where we take all of the"
"existing ion channel expression data so"
"that we know what channels are in"
"whatever tissue you're interested in we"
"from the experiments we should know what"
"voltage pattern is appropriate and then"
"you can use the simulator to say okay"
"well given the"
"arrogance you have and given the pattern"
"you want what channels do you need to"
"open and close and then you should be"
"able to design a cocktail the reason"
"that you need a simulator for all this"
"is that not only is this all very"
"complicated you need to satisfy a bunch"
"of criteria for example well you better"
"not stop the heartbeat so so right so"
"there's a bunch of bunch of cells that"
"you really don't want to mess with so"
"you really need a pretty good a"
"computational component here to identify"
"a cocktail of channel drugs that are"
"gonna give you what you want and so"
"we've been we've been developing these"
"kinds of machine learning tools that"
"will take various networks that contain"
"both by electric and chemical nodes and"
"search for that needle in a haystack"
"intervention and then this is this is we"
"you know we did some of these things to"
"predict ways to suppress that metastatic"
"phenotype that I showed you so so I"
"think we're looking at a bunch of"
"directions such as trying to refine as"
"physiological signature trying to refine"
"these control methods for mammalian"
"systems we've done some some things in"
"human cells in vitro and and some Mouse"
"work but really that's kind of a lot of"
"the future of the next few years and and"
"really try to crack this this"
"bioelectric code that goes from the"
"electrical state of the tissues to the"
"actual outcome and so obviously we'd"
"love to work together with more and so"
"just to thank all the various the"
"various postdocs and the grad students"
"that worked on this so let's see Daniel"
"Lobo was our computational guy that did"
"some of the predictive work Brooke chair"
"net worked on cancer suppression Maria"
"lo bacon worked on the cancer of the"
"metastatic induction so pi does the"
"brain repair stuff does blakiston's did"
"a lot of the the I work"
"falen Durant was the one who did the"
"two-headed planaria experiments and"
"Danny Adams developed some of the early"
"dye dye experiments and of course I"
"thank my funders the paul allen"
"frontiers group and various various"
"other people who have helped us do this"
"work DARPA Keck Foundation and so on"
"Templeton matters and of course NIH and"
"then if you're ever wondering how what"
"the two-headed animals look like this is"
"what they look like"
"so so if you cut off the two heads what"
"you will get is each individual head"
"will grow a tail and but the middle"
"fragment will go will have grow two"
"heads so you got two single heads and"
"one double head from each of those cuts"
"yeah yeah so thank you I'll take"
questions
