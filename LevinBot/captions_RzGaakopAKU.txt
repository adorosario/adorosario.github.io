"there's bioelectrical events there's"
"biomechanical events there's biochemical"
"events all those things are happening at"
"the same time but what's really"
"important to ask is"
"what is each layer doing and what does"
"each layer give us the opportunity to do"
"i would argue that the genome is"
"actually not the software i think what"
"the genome does is actually nail down"
"the hardware i think the genome tells"
"every single cell what proteins it gets"
"to have and so from that perspective"
"what the genome is giving you is a"
"specification of the lowest level"
hardware
"you can do a lot by manipulating the"
"hardware but when you're on your laptop"
"and you want to switch from microsoft"
"word to photoshop you don't get out your"
"soldering iron and start rewiring"
"because making system level changes by"
"manipulating things at the lowest level"
"of your machine of the hardware is super"
"hard and that's not how evolution does"
"it what one of the nice things that this"
"bioelectrical level of control gives you"
"is it actually gives you control over"
"some of the really important"
"physiological software that deals with"
"large scale concepts like the size of"
"certain organs the shape of certain"
"organs the positioning how many heads do"
"you have and therefore when you interact"
"with that layer you get to program top"
"down it's almost as if you were working"
"in a higher level language that doesn't"
"require you to understand well gee you"
"know i'm programming on this thing of"
"copper and silicon and and aluminum and"
"god knows what else is in there you"
"don't need to know all of that because"
"you have access to these higher level"
controls

"welcome to the first demystifying"
"science podcast of the new year i am"
"very very excited to be here with dr"
"michael levin whom has been brought to"
"our attention by you guys by uh some of"
"our listeners who posted his ted talk"
"it was really exciting to see"
"that dr levin had been"
"building a framework for development"
"that didn't rely on typical chemical"
"signaling so"
"he has this bioelectric network"
"conception of development which is"
"fascinating because it's both primitive"
"and sophisticated at the same time"
"he was also in the news this year for"
"these xenobots and there's plenty of"
"podcasts and other youtube shows about"
"that stuff"
"maybe we'll talk about it a bit today"
"too but what i really wanted to get into"
"was dr levin's philosophy of"
"the self and cognition which i think is"
"really interesting thank you for being"
"here dr levin"
"thank you so much yeah thank you for"
"having me why do you avoid the word"
"consciousness and stick with these other"
"terms like agency"
and
"uh cognition"
"as opposed to the most popular word in"
"philosophy right now which is"
"consciousness can you tell us a bit"
"about the distinction between those two"
"ideas and then maybe we'll get into the"
"netting greatest of your ideas"
"sure sure and and um if you don't mind"
"um i just want to address one super"
"quick thing from from from the"
"introduction which is that um you know"
"my work on bioelectricity is certainly"
"not meant to be uh instead of um"
"understanding biochemical signaling so"
"i'm i'm in no way suggesting that the"
"traditional gene regulatory networks"
"chemical gradients uh you know"
"biochemical pathways i'm in no way"
"suggesting that those things aren't"
"important or that somehow bioelectricity"
"will do it all by itself so those things"
"are absolutely like critical mechanisms"
"but but um and hopefully we can talk"
"about that later today i think"
"bioelectricity has some really"
"interesting unique properties that make"
"it something that is is very worthwhile"
"to um to to track in in addition to the"
"you know kind of the canonical"
"mainstream stuff that has been going on"
"for years but so so i you know i just"
"want to be clear that that i'm not i'm"
"not i'm trying to"
"you know downplay any of that so it's"
"like you see you see those happening in"
"parallel like there's all these"
"different systems uh throughout the"
"organism that are contributing to memory"
"and intelligence it's like this is just"
"another track that's happening and of"
"course like i guess the traditional"
"paradigm where dna is you know this what"
"we would say i guess the software and"
"the or the genetic information is the"
"software and then there's this kind of"
"machine running the body is a bit"
"different from the way you see things"
"which is more"
"uh yeah hierarchically dispersed i"
suppose
"i mean so so i would say it a little"
differently
"certainly all those things are happening"
"simultaneously so there's there's"
"bioelectrical events there are"
"biomechanical events there's biochemical"
"events all those things are happening at"
"the same time but what's what's really"
"important to ask is"
"what is each layer doing and but"
"what it what does each layer give us the"
"opportunity to do so when you target the"
"bioelectrics or when you target the"
"biochemistry or the genetics what does"
"that allow you to do and i think i would"
"argue and i have argued that"
"what the genome the genome is actually"
"not the software i think what the genome"
"does is actually nail down the hardware"
"i think the genome tells every single"
"cell what proteins it gets to have"
"and so from that perspective what the"
"genome is is giving you is a"
"specification of the lowest level"
"hardware now now as we know from from"
"from working with with computer"
technology
"you can do a lot by manipulating the"
"hardware but you know why doing this is"
"kind of a silly example i use all the"
"time when you when you're on your laptop"
"and you want to switch from microsoft"
"word to photoshop you don't get out your"
"soldering iron and start rewiring now"
"why don't you do that right you could"
"and in the 50s when i give a talk i have"
"this picture of what programming looked"
"like in the 40s and 50s and there's this"
"woman and she's literally like like"
"moving wires around right that's what"
"reprogramming looked like you could do"
"that but why don't we do that anymore"
"because it's brutally difficult because"
"because making lot making system level"
"changes by manipulating things at the"
"lowest level of your machine of the"
"hardware is super hard right it's just"
"it's just incredibly hard and and that's"
"not how evolution does it and either and"
so
"um what what one thing i am we we can"
"get into this i think that"
"what one of the nice things that this"
"bioelectrical level of control gives you"
"is it actually gives you control over"
"some of the really important"
"physiological software that deals with"
large-scale
uh
"concepts like this the size of certain"
"organs the shape of certain organs the"
"positioning how many heads do you have"
"like that that kind of a thing and and"
"therefore when you interact with that"
"layer you get to program top down it's"
"almost as if and and"
"it's almost as if you were working in a"
"higher level language that doesn't"
"require you to understand well gee you"
"know i'm programming on this thing of"
"copper and silicon and and aluminum and"
"god knows what else is in there you"
"don't need to know all of that because"
"you have access to these higher level"
"controls now i'm certainly not saying"
"that biology it resembles the kind of"
"computers that you and i use today right"
"that's that's that's the you know that's"
"for sure that get that gets people very"
"agitated when they when they think that"
um
"that's being claimed and so i'm"
"certainly not saying that but but there"
"is something very profound about um"
"computers in general which is this idea"
"of reprogrammability and the idea of"
"separation of data from machine and the"
"idea of having different levels of"
"control where where yes sometimes you"
"want to go to the very lowest level and"
"deal with the with the you know what are"
"the chips made of and other times you"
"don't want to know that whatsoever you"
"want to say well this is my algorithm"
"and i wanted to compute this and that"
"and i don't care what's underneath right"
"and so and so that gives you a lot of"
"power so so i think what um what"
"evolution discovered very early on"
"like around the time of bacterial"
"biofilm so really early on"
"is that uh and and and there's some"
"there's some beautiful work out of uh"
uh
"ucsd on that um"
"i think what evolution discovered is"
"that bioelectric networks are are really"
"good at processing information they make"
"it really easy to do computations to do"
"memory to integrate information from"
"from across a distance to um have"
"reprogrammability to have this kind of"
"nested architecture where you have"
"subroutines where you can say build an"
"eye here and you don't need to know how"
"to build an eye you just need to be able"
"to specify that that's where the eye"
"goes and there are other modules"
"underneath that you know do the do the"
"um do the nitty-gritty work are those"
"genetic modules at that point"
"uh yeah they involve they involve lots"
"of things they involve um genetics they"
"involve biomechanics because you have to"
"bend you know tissues and you have to"
"exert forces and and of course other"
"bioelectrics as well right um but but"
"that's what i think is really kind of"
"unique and interesting about"
"bioelectricity and and we could have"
"already guessed that because that's what"
"the brain does right why what you know"
"the the the brain uses that same"
"uh kind of uh kind of architecture to"
exploit
"uh to exploit bioelectrics to get all"
"these cool features like for example"
"you can learn things during your"
"lifetime you don't need to completely uh"
"replace your brain every time you want"
"to learn something new that same"
"hardware can"
"can store one of numerous possible you"
"know control um algorithms for what"
"what's going to happen and this is"
"and if i can interrupt you this is sort"
"of the place where the distinction"
"between cognition and consciousness"
"and the way that you prefer to use"
"cognition becomes relevant right because"
"if you're talking about the human that's"
"going out and learning something there"
"is all of this sort of"
self-generative
"material that is necessary to create the"
"motivation to go out and to learn"
something
"but for a cell is it considered"
"cognition by you simply because the"
"instruction has to come from somewhere"
"else to tell it what to do"
"um no so so let's say so so let me let"
"me address that that question then"
"what's the what the deal with"
"consciousness is so so my distinction of"
"consciousness versus cognition is not"
"about uh the level of it so i'm not"
"avoiding consciousness because i want to"
"reserve consciousness for like a really"
"high order self-reflective you know"
"metacognition where i know what i know"
"and i you know that i'm not talking"
"about any of that stuff i'm i actually"
"you know"
"long story short i actually think that"
um
"consciousness is something that goes all"
"the way down i i mean i'm in no way"
"trying to reserve that for the kind of"
"human-like conscious experience that we"
"have i think i think consciousness goes"
"goes way all the way down the"
"distinction the distinction i make is"
"somewhat different the thing about"
"the thing about um cognition agency"
"behavior intelligence memory problem"
"solving all these nice terms that i use"
"all the time in in the work the thing"
"with about those words is that they are"
"they're they're functional words in"
"other words we can study them in third"
"person you and i can look at something"
"we can define this as a function of what"
"it's doing we can assign criteria that"
"we um"
"that uh"
"we are easy to measure all of these"
"things are measurable we can agree on"
"whether that did or didn't happen or it"
"happened to with a you know 75 percent"
"quality or whatever it's going to be and"
"we have theories that are where the"
"outcome of those theories are let's say"
"quantity their numbers predictions of"
"those theories are numbers i can say i"
"think that's memory and because i think"
"that under those same circumstances"
"we've got an 80 chance that past"
"experience is going to make this thing"
"do xyz in the future right these are"
"these are all third-person kind of"
"objective science experiments that we"
"can do"
"consciousness and and and this is a"
"controversial view not everybody agrees"
"with this"
"i think that consciousness is unique and"
"special in the sense that"
"it it it's it's really only applicable"
"to the experience of a first person"
"observer it's in and this has been one"
"one way that people who have done way"
"more work on consciousness than i have"
"put it is what's it it's the sort of"
"what is it like to be a you know"
"whatever and and the thing i want to i"
"want to say about there's a couple of"
"things i want to say about consciousness"
"one is"
"you have to be very careful because i"
"think a lot of people who say they're"
"studying consciousness are in fact"
"studying correlates of consciousness"
"they're studying behaviors they're"
"studying structures and the way you know"
"that is"
"if there's a couple of there's a couple"
"ways you know that one is if somebody"
"gives you a theory of consciousness"
"right let's say let's say it has to do"
"with a particular structure in the brain"
"or a particular organization or some"
"sort of um frequency of of binding of"
"you know neural activity or whatever"
"it's going to be"
"just ask yourself this question if if"
"somebody gave this to this the story to"
"me on a piece of paper and said this"
"happens this happens"
"if they didn't tell me that this was"
"meant to be a story about consciousness"
"and i read about all these events going"
"on what i ever in a million years have"
"said oh that is amazing i can from that"
"i can see that that wow there must be a"
"subject home inside there and you know"
"and it's that that you know that subject"
"will have an experience of what it's"
"like to be that never happens right any"
"story about consciousness and i'm you"
"know probably lots of people will be mad"
"at this but but but"
"in my experience when somebody gives you"
"an account of"
"where consciousness comes from"
"you can almost always read that account"
"and you can you can imagine that you you"
"can there's nothing conscious about it"
"it's a description of some physics or"
"some chemistry or both or whatever it's"
"it's never quite obvious why that in"
"particular has anything to do with"
"consciousness other than they told you"
"that this was supposed to be a story"
"about consciousness so now now some"
"people will say"
"right and that's because there's nothing"
"more to say and there is that all there"
"is right are the facts of chemistry and"
"then the rest of it is a user illusion"
"and so on so that that i mean that's"
"fine that's that's um which makes it a"
"spiritual question rather than a"
"scientific one"
"i think i think that's true i think that"
uh
"you can you very quickly run out of"
"proper terminology because people people"
"will well people will often say it's an"
"illusion right and you say but illusions"
"usually have a subject that's that's"
"that's mistaken about something right"
"that's being um you know confused or"
"whatever so uh"
"anyway it's so so that's so that's one"
"so so i think that i think that it's"
"very very difficult to actually do"
"experiments any kind of work about"
"consciousness um i think that if we want"
"to stick to making progress in terms of"
"experiments that we can do so this is"
"why i usually talk very little about it"
"because i think that the what we"
"actually make progress on are things"
"like cognition and intelligence and"
"behavior i think it's very hard to make"
"progress on actual consciousness the"
"other the other way you know this that"
"there's a problem here is is this"
"imagine imagine that some time in the"
"future some some number of decades from"
"now we have a correct theory of"
"consciousness let's say somebody cracks"
"it and we figure it out okay"
"so now let's just ask ourselves so now"
"so we have this correct theory and i am"
"looking at some particular creature in"
"some particular weird state uh and i"
"asked this theory"
"to make a to to tell me what the"
"prediction is right so so what is it"
"what is the con the the content of the"
"consciousness of this creature and so"
"the question is what format does the"
"answer of the theory take what does it"
"look like virtual virtual reality or"
"something like how would you output that"
data
"you see that's that's the that's the"
"question right how would you output it"
"because for for any normal scientific"
"theory we you may not know the answer"
"but you know what the answer would look"
"like right it would be a set of numbers"
"or it would be up top a lot you know"
"some sort of weird topological form or"
"some you know we we kind of know what"
"what theory is supposed to look like"
"what would it what would a theory of"
"consciousness ever output well and so"
"and so i think you're right on the money"
"by saying virtual reality because"
"uh i think the only way to actually do"
"real experiments on consciousness is to"
"be the system"
"itself to experience it first person how"
"are you going to experience it first"
person
"you know for for things that aren't too"
"different yes i think virtual reality"
"would would do"
"but but the other the other thing that"
"you might do is look let's let's let's"
"talk about um"
"kind of a standard experiment so so i'm"
"you're a neuroscientist and you're"
"looking at this uh you know whatever"
"living thing it's going to be you've got"
"some electrodes or some some"
"optogenetics or something you're"
"watching the brain"
"that's all of that stuff is getting"
"processed via some sort of computer"
"algorithm it's coming out on a screen"
"and then you're watching that screen"
"with your eyeballs and saying ah that's"
"a conscious experience of of you know of"
"a fear or whatever it is right that's"
"that's what we're looking at now"
"what you're what you're seeing of course"
"is some sort of third-person description"
"of what the neurons are doing you"
"actually have no idea what the actual"
"experience is you might be able to say"
"something about behavior you might be"
"able to say oh yeah i predict this"
"thing's going to you know run away from"
"whatever i do you know whatever we just"
did
"but let's but let's go further let's say"
"why do we have all this weird um"
"uh technical interface between that"
"creature and and my and and my you know"
"in my brain let's get rid of all that"
"i'm gonna wire what i'm gonna do is i'm"
"gonna i'm gonna take the output of my"
"electrodes i'm going to wire them"
"directly into my brain i'm not going to"
"go through a computer screen and a you"
"know and my eyeballs and you know my"
"retina and everything else i'm just"
"going to wire it into my brain"
"and so now now you're kind of you're on"
"your way because now to some extent"
"you're actually experiencing as if it"
"were a sense right so instead of retinas"
"imagine if instead of retinas we now had"
"an interface that read other people's"
brains
"you're on your way a little bit right"
"because now you're directly experiencing"
"some of what they're experiencing not"
"exactly right and then eventually you"
"say wait man i don't i don't want this i"
"don't want these electrodes at all i'm"
"just going to fuse my brain to their"
"brain the way that your left and right"
"hemispheres are fused together like"
"you're going to do such a good job and"
"and this is all doable you're going to"
"do such a good job fusing"
"that you want the direct experience now"
"the only the only thing to keep in mind"
is
"you are not going to be you are not"
"going to become"
"that creature and know what it's like to"
"be that creature both you and that"
"creature are going to know what it's"
"like to now be a third creature that"
"didn't exist before that is a"
"combination of the two of you right this"
"is like siamese twin studies or"
something
"very close actually very close this is"
"all extremely relevant but but now you"
"know the key thing is that we can do all"
"this now right we can do all these all"
"these kind of cut and paste experiments"
"are totally doable and"
"uh are they limited by the similarity of"
"the brains because i imagine that if you"
"take something you know you talk about"
uh
"like a flatworm would you be able to"
"fuse the brain of a flatworm with the"
"brain of a of"
"a human"
being
"the structures are like sufficiently"
"parallel the structures well the"
"structures are completely different but"
"that doesn't matter but you see so you"
"can never know what it's like to be a"
"flatworm because you're not a flower"
"only a flower and we'll know what it's"
"like to be a flat one but you can know"
"what it's like to be a creature that's a"
"half you and have flatworm and so right"
"and so so people actually"
"is that a problem of motivations like"
"we're not going to understand the"
"motivations of the flatworm is is that"
"it like we're always going to be seeing"
"things through human motivational"
"structures i'm not even sure that it's"
"necessarily human i mean we can get into"
"that whole question of what exactly is a"
"human because it's not very obvious at"
"all but but you know so so there's been"
"work for example somebody put um"
"drosophila neurons into the brains of"
"human patients like that's been done and"
"the drosophila neurons do fine they"
"interface with the other neurons there"
"you know was an epilepsy it was a"
"treatment for epilepsy that was done in"
"russia and um you you know uh yeah"
"you're you're never going to turn"
"yourself into a into a flatworm but"
"you can certainly modify your structure"
"i mean at some point with all the"
"bioengineering that goes on at some"
"point you're going to say you know i"
"would like a third hemisphere"
"and we know that can work because"
"because in the blind your your other"
"senses take over that new real estate"
"right that's that's released when your"
"eyes aren't working so we know that your"
"brain regions can take over new real"
"estate we already know that so so at"
"some point you might say i i want a"
"third hemisphere because i want more"
"more real you know more processing power"
"for some of the things my brain does and"
"don't make it out of human cells i would"
"really like it to be very regenerative"
"so how about some axolotl and and you"
"know and there will be some"
"you know the details of immune rejection"
"whatever those are just details you know"
"the fundament the fundamental like the"
"you know the the"
"fundamental aspects of it are are"
"totally solvable so so"
"then you can do experiments on"
"consciousness then you can say wow now i"
"see what it's like to be a creature"
"that's got two human hemispheres and a"
"third axolotl hemisphere whatever i'm"
"making that up whatever whatever you're"
"going to be"
"then you can study consciousness but but"
"as long as you are observing it from the"
"outside i don't think you're studying"
"consciousness i think you're studying"
"correlates of consciousness or things"
"that may or may not potentiate"
"consciousness so so this is why like"
"what's really the goal of a theory of"
"consciousness anyways is it to are you"
"going to try to explain the like the"
"emergence of this experience is that the"
goal
"um that's a good that's a really good"
"question uh i think that i think that"
"some people who work in this field"
"to them there's a much more basic"
"question which is"
"the question of"
"what is what what is it in the first"
"place like what is a what is a useful"
"definition of consciousness right but if"
"what you're saying is correct that the"
"these cognitive"
"agentic processes go all the way down to"
"the cellular level then it's it's almost"
"like when i was reading some of your"
"work i got the impression that what you"
"were saying i'm probably totally wrong"
"and correct me is that"
"consciousness or"
"cognition let's"
"an agency these things aren't something"
"that emerges at this like metal level"
"you know at the wider organismal level"
"but that they're actually goal seeking"
"behaviors all the way down and so it"
"almost sounds to me like you're saying"
"that that theory of consciousness or"
"metacognition or whatever you want to"
"say isn't"
"uh it's sort of an elusive quest because"
"there's probably something going on at"
"every level and it's not just this thing"
"that snaps into place all of a sudden"
"um yeah but well all of all of that is"
"true so so so so i do think that uh"
"there are uh a"
"cognitive experiences of all of your"
"parts so your tissues your organs your"
"cells uh and and probably the molecular"
"networks in your cells um are goal"
"seeking agents of a particular type and"
"they will have some kind of cognition"
"they will have some degree of"
"intelligence meaning problem solving in"
"various weird spaces like like"
"physiological spaces and transcriptional"
"spaces and so on uh that doesn't mean"
"that um when you and i are talking now"
"there isn't a new emergent very high"
"level uh additional agent that forms"
"right which which is great and it's"
"verbal and we can have this conversation"
"but at the same time there are lots of"
"other agents on both sides of this"
"connection that are not verbal that we"
"are not talking to and that we're only"
"beginning to understand um how to you"
"know how to how to communicate with them"
"um yeah"
"you say you"
"you say something interesting there"
"about the sort of the problem solving"
"ability on a cellular level"
where
"can you so"
"in the process of regenerating let's say"
"a limb"
"is there really"
"a problem to be solved or is there a"
"program to be executed"
um
"i don't think those are"
"those are not mutually exclusive i think"
"executing programs is one way to solve"
problems
"i think whether or not"
"it's actually"
"you know"
"whether or not the the metaphor of a pro"
"of a program is actually useful to that"
"scenario remains to be seen but for sure"
"it's useful uh for sure the problem"
"solving paradigm is is absolutely useful"
so
"william james's definition of"
"intelligence was the ability to get to"
"the same goals by different means the"
"idea was that you're looking at an"
"agential system when you can figure out"
"what it wants and it has the ability to"
"some degree of competency right from"
"from very primitive kind of"
"intelligences to very advanced"
"intelligence is some some capability of"
"getting to its goal even though things"
"are changing perturbations the"
"environment changes you've moved the"
"thing you know you've moved stuff around"
"and it still can do that"
"that is seen all the way from from"
"bacteria on up in various spaces you"
"just have to be clever the thing about"
"the thing about recognizing agency and"
"intelligence is that it's a two-way"
"operation when when when we try to"
"estimate how much intelligence something"
"has or how much agency it has we are"
"ourselves taking an iq test because if"
"we're not clever enough to recognize"
"what the system is doing we're going to"
"say oh man that's a paperweight that's"
"not really doing anything and really it"
"might be doing all kinds of interesting"
"things and this is probably why people"
"think bacteria are very simple little"
"organisms since humans are super complex"
"because they're not capable of"
recognizing
"you know just how complicated and"
"difficult it is being a bacteria my"
"favorite yeah yeah"
"yeah and the reason you know the reason"
"is is because ours all of our senses are"
"pointing outwards so our training set of"
"what you know"
"all animals and in particular you know"
"humans and and others you know primates"
"and social animals are very good at"
"recognizing agency around them it's"
"extremely important when you look around"
"to say is that a rock and therefore i"
"know it's only going to do certain"
"things based on its environment or is"
"that you know a sleeping tiger and it's"
"going to do all kinds of things that"
"have nothing to do with which way the"
"hill is pointing down or not you know"
"it's very important for us to uh to"
"catch agency in the in the environment"
"but all of our senses are pointing"
"outwards so we are very good at"
"seeing intelligence that operates at"
"medium-sized scales roughly things about"
"our size medium time scales not"
"evolutionary time frames nor might you"
"know micro you know millisecond time so"
and
"everything that to us all the all the"
"intelligence that we know how to"
"recognize takes place in"
"three-dimensional space so we know we"
"can see you know uh"
"certain kinds of activities moving"
"things from here to there opening locks"
"and bringing this to the over there and"
"those kinds of things are we we're"
"primed to recognize intelligence in"
"three-dimensional space that's because"
"all of our senses are pointing outwards"
"if we had imagine if imagine if we had"
built-in
um
biofeedback
"so that uh"
"you had an immediate sense of everything"
"your your pancreas was doing at any"
"given moment right now we know we don't"
"but imagine if you did if if we had an"
"experience all the way from from our you"
"know from our early early um"
"uh time we that we were in an embryo we"
"had the experience of knowing what was"
"going on and what did our pancreas do in"
"response we would have no trouble"
"recognizing the pancreas as a kind of"
"really intelligent uh creature that"
"navigates this amazingly complicated"
"physiological space right because you"
"know the glucose is going up and down"
"all these hormones and all this stuff is"
"going on in the environment things you"
"eat and all the time what's the what"
"what are your organs doing they're"
"trying to keep you in optimal health"
"despite all this craziness that you"
"subject them to um with with rhythms and"
"diet and everything else and"
"we would if we had access to that data"
"set we would recognize these things as"
"and nowadays when we think of robotics"
"when i say robot you think it's this"
"thing that moves around and it you know"
"moves around in 3d space things like an"
"automated insulin pump that you might"
"have in your body right if you if you"
"needed one that's a robot that's a robot"
"that works in physiological space it"
"moves around in this physiological space"
"it might measure all sorts of different"
um
"chemicals in your bloodstream that are"
"all these orthogonal dimensions of the"
space
"and it is navigating that space just"
"like any robot would navigate"
"three-dimensional space it's just on us"
"to to um"
"be be more open-minded than our than our"
"typical uh senses have led us to be the"
"corollary of that is that you could"
"easily learn"
"to look inward the same way that you"
"have to learn to be able to identify"
"intelligence that's non-standard because"
"i've known diabetics that after years of"
"carrying an insulin pump they're able to"
"tell you what's happening to their"
"insulin without the pump and so what"
"happens is that you have this feedback"
"of what's actually happening you have"
"something like you were saying earlier"
"about the ability if you measure"
"something and you can tie it to"
"something else then you begin to have"
"kind of a functional"
"system which allows you to see something"
"that wasn't visible before and i wonder"
"if it's not the same for other bodily"
systems
"and our inability to see it is due to"
"sort to to a lack of data"
"yeah yeah i think that's i think that's"
"spot on i think that's exactly right and"
"and let's be clear there are lots of"
"pre-scientific traditions people people"
"have spent before modern science people"
"have spent a lot of time figuring this"
"out so there are whole you know if you"
"want to think about yoga and these and"
"things like this there are a lot of"
"people who do all kinds of uh exercises"
"to a uh gain control over various body"
"functions that you normally don't have"
"any access to"
and
um
"these kinds of uh these kinds of ideas"
that
"uh that talk about you know the various"
"kinds of intelligence of the things you"
"know the different subsystems of your"
"body i mean this has this has existed"
"for for a really long time i think you"
"know we're not uh you know we're"
"discovering it now in a rigorous sort of"
"mathematical way and so on but these"
"ideas have been around forever and uh"
"and and the idea that i mean i mean"
"pavlov i mean you know of course even"
"older than that but pavlov in the 20s"
"was was um trying to train organs you"
"know he didn't just train dogs he"
"actually trained the organs of the dogs"
"right he was doing all kinds of"
"interesting experiments with memory of"
"bodily organs this was yeah you know"
"this is not just something that's coming"
"up now and by the way to to put this"
"back to the discussion about"
consciousness
"that's probably even older than this of"
"people saying that the only way to"
"understand your consciousness is to work"
"on your consciousness and to experience"
"it whether or not it's going to be"
"through um"
"thought modification practices which"
"might be meditation or they might be you"
"know there's a whole bunch of techniques"
"or whether it's it's psychedelic drugs"
"whether it's uh different ways to change"
"you know how you"
"how you go through life whatever but"
"this idea that that you have to be a"
"participant in the study of"
"consciousness you can't be an external"
"observer is is ancient it's super"
"ancient it's funny that you say that"
"because i've always sort of looked at"
"the world now and i've thought that we"
are
"entering into an era where"
"the ability to understand and"
"communicate will be the most important"
"ability because we have developed all of"
"these technological"
"tools up until this point and it seems"
"sort of to be a little bit dramatic"
"about it that the final frontier is the"
"ability to communicate and in order to"
"be able to communicate"
to
"to cause the sorts of changes that you"
"want in the world without having to"
"micromanage them and i imagine that"
"being on or within your own body too"
"within like i was thinking about these"
these
"these uh what do you call them robot"
organs
uh
"don't they need to be able to"
"integrate into that sense of self as"
"well like they need to communicate in"
"such a way that they understand that"
"this is their self now"
is
"i mean"
"what yeah"
"yeah i mean it's an interesting it's an"
"interesting uh question uh"
"we we like to we like to draw boundaries"
"around the organism so that you say okay"
"you know here's a human and right at the"
"sort of at the edge of their skin is"
"where the body stops but if you think"
"about the internal organs what's their"
"external environment as far as your"
"kidney is concerned the the the cells"
"sitting next to it that's its external"
"environment right so so yes it's part of"
"a greater it's part of a greater"
"organism as as we are parts of an even"
"greater system but but at every point"
"there are smaller selves within within"
"these larger cells and they have an"
"external environment which from the"
"perspective of the higher level system"
"you look down you say ah you're still"
"all part of me you're still part of the"
"same thing but"
"and that and that's great for you but"
"but but for the for them uh they are"
"dealing with an external environment"
"whatever comes through the bloodstream"
"they don't have immediate control over"
"that that's their extra they can take"
"actions and maybe you know in the next"
"20 minutes things will get better maybe"
"they won't but but these are things that"
"are happening to them from the outside"
"as far as they're concerned but you also"
"run in this problem then with like"
"externalities right where you're if they"
"don't treat their external environments"
"as something that's"
theirs
"then perhaps you you could build up damn"
"it you get aging yeah you get problems"
right
"uh to the extent that we understand how"
"aging even occurs in cancer and things"
"like corrosive disorders yeah damaged"
sure
"sure sure and we have we have we have"
"some some work on this and specifically"
"in cancer where what you can do is you"
"can you can specifically disconnect"
"cells from their neighbors electrically"
"and as soon as you do that the"
"the the as i've called it this this"
"cognitive light cone the boundary of the"
"goals that these that these systems can"
"um can take care of are is shrinks from"
"from from the large goal of hey i'm"
"maintaining a nice organ to a tiny goal"
"of i'm a single cell the rest of this"
"body is just external environment as far"
"as i'm concerned i'm an amiibo again and"
"what are my goals my goals are to become"
"two amoebas and uh and to go where life"
"is good so that's metastasis and so and"
"and maybe at some point i'll try to"
"regain some sort of the half-assed"
"multicellularity and i'll try to make a"
"tumor but you know not really not really"
"useful as far as the larger system is"
"concerned um but and and you can go in"
"the opposite direction you can take a"
"cell expressing a really nasty oncogene"
"which is trying to depolarize and and"
"disconnect and you can artificially"
"force it to remain connected and then"
"guess what even though the genetic"
"damage is there it will be part of a"
"normal tissue right and so and so this"
"idea of the the boundary between self"
"and world um shrinking and growing"
"happens all the time in our bodies it"
"grows during embryonic development it"
"shrinks during cancer"
"and outside of our bodies too i mean"
"this is just i can't like help but see"
"the social implications of this as well"
"where like especially in our country"
"right now you have this like stark"
"division between the ideas of"
"individuals stark individualism you know"
"especially where we live like in the"
"state of jefferson out here you know"
"it's like there's this there's this real"
like
"tension between the idea of how much is"
"does me matter versus my community"
"versus my country and so on and so forth"
and
"it seems like a huge part of"
"bioengineering in the future and"
"social engineering the right word um a"
"terrifying version of the right word"
"government governing a society is going"
"to come down to uh patterning"
"the development of that balance yeah"
"like how much does this translate from"
"the organismal level to the social level"
"is that something that's beyond the the"
"scope here"
"i mean i i don't think it's beyond the"
"scope i want to be careful and uh be"
"clear that i don't have any particular"
"expertise uh in talking about these"
"social things this is the speculation"
"you are a human though so you're"
"entitled to a human perspective yeah"
"yeah we can do that and and i actually"
"um you know and and i've actually lived"
"uh you know the first part of my life my"
"childhood in a society that was i was"
"born in russia and you know during the"
"height of uh you know the ussr and so on"
"so it was almost nothing actually well"
"not during the hyatt i was born in the"
"collapse i advented the collapse yes i"
"see yeah yeah well well i was there i"
"was there long before that and so and so"
"we can we can talk about that a little"
"bit i think i i think what's really"
"important to keep in mind"
"is that it's no i mean the the cancer"
example
"is a little misleading because there"
"what you take away from that is oh man"
"uh ev everything should just be"
"connected and and following these"
"large-scale goals and then light and"
"then we're good right we don't have"
"cancer we have a nice organism so that"
"that try that sort of suggests that you"
"should just you know connect everything"
"up and follow these higher goals and so"
"on you got to be careful with that"
"because because"
"when was the last time you lost any"
"sleepover how many cells you shed every"
"day right"
"never and so the nice the important"
"thing about these large systems is that"
"they develop new goals that often don't"
"really overlap at much at all with the"
"goals of the subsystems so when you when"
"you connect all of these things into"
"this larger glorious hole"
"you got to remember"
"to to to ask yourself well what happened"
"to the to the individuals and uh are"
"they better off or worse off and then"
"you know again people"
"think about evolution and so on they say"
"of course you're better off i mean look"
"at you know look at the the the the"
"large animal is able to you know have be"
"very successful as opposed to individual"
"bacteria sure the large animal is"
"but how about the individual cells of"
"that a large animal are they any better"
"off than they would have been if they"
"were bacteria i'm not sure right it's"
"not obvious at all and so so these"
"higher levels show up and then they have"
"goals and then they have bigger goals"
"that are that say you know i'm i'm gonna"
"go um i'm gonna go uh i'm gonna take a"
"boxing okay and and i'm gonna meet all"
"of my personal goals of you know"
"whatever and yeah you know i'm gonna"
"lose some cells i'll lose some brain"
"cells and they'll lose some knuckle skin"
"and i'll lose some some other stuff no"
"problem well that's great for you"
"but right so but but you see where i'm"
"going with this so i think i think we"
"have to be very careful with"
"interpreting the cancer example as"
"suggesting that we should just max max"
"out the the larger the goal the better i"
"don't think that's that necessarily true"
"at all well no i was seeing it more like"
"as a balancing act actually"
"right and"
"i wonder what it's like integrating you"
"know back to the robotic organs or back"
"to tissue regeneration or cancer uh"
remediation
"it seems like you're always going to be"
"seeking this really delicate equilibrium"
"and trying to typify the pattern of that"
"equilibrium so that you can instruct the"
"tissue to"
"wander in that direction and it seems to"
"me like i could be totally wrong but"
"from your work i'm getting the"
"impression that it's about finding out"
"what the goals of those"
"cells on those different scales are so"
"that the goals can be over"
"can be sort of uh"
"yeah complementary to them to the"
"maximal extent so you have this balance"
"between all of their different goals and"
"then you would have maybe perfect health"
"or something or you could but"
"yeah i think you're right i think the"
"key is there's going to be some sort of"
"positive there's some sort of balance"
"that that will be optimal uh there i"
"think we're very uh rapidly leaving the"
"domain of science and entering i'm not"
"sure what because because i don't think"
"there's any scientific method that's"
"going to tell you what the right balance"
"is there's going to be science that"
"tells you what balances are achievable"
"what balances are stable what balances"
are
"you know possible with certain methods"
"whatever but"
"but all of them are going to be"
"trade-offs in the sense that somebody's"
"goals are going to be met and somebody"
"else's goals are not going to be met and"
"the systems making those decisions are"
"biased you know when a bunch of people"
"sit around and decide what to do"
"uh they're awfully biased to the human"
"scale side of things uh you know um"
"and so"
"finding this finding a proper balance"
"and deciding what a good balance is is"
"distinctly non-trivial i mean i'll give"
"you a simple uh kind of kind of example"
"but i think this is the kind of thing"
"that keeps me up at night sometimes"
"there was this there was a story of of a"
um
"a psychotherapist who was he was"
"treating somebody with what what used to"
"be called multiple personality disorder"
"i guess now it's a dissociative identity"
"disorder and so the deal is that uh the"
"patient comes in and he says uh this is"
"driving me crazy i can't i can't keep a"
"job because these other personalities"
"are coming up and some of them are"
"pretty rowdy and you know and i'm"
"getting fired and like i can't have this"
"we got to fix this and uh and the the"
"therapist is"
"yep we got this thing called integration"
"therapy we're going to work together and"
"we're going to you know we're going to"
"integrate you and you'll be back you"
"know you'll be back back to normal so"
"they're working on this and and so one"
"day patient comes in"
"and it's the other and it's the other"
"personality he says hey doc what says i"
"hear about integration he says well"
"we're gonna he said well let's let's"
"just break that down for me when when"
"when you integrate where am i going to"
"be and he's like well you're kind of"
"going to be gone and really and so"
"that's i i don't like the sound of that"
"what happened to the hippocratic oath"
"you you you and this other guy are"
"working on making me disappear what's up"
"with that and and you know and and so"
"that really to me that really gets to"
"the bottom of this whole issue right"
because
"there are certain selves and and agents"
"that are very that are verbal and very"
"good at advocating for themselves like"
"your left hemisphere for most of us"
"you are home to another agent which is"
"normally not heard from until somebody"
"cuts the you know the the corpus"
"callosum and then you can find out what"
"your right hemisphere thinks and there's"
"all kinds of other sub units inside of"
"us that we normally you know you"
"normally are going to take the side of"
"the larger system not necessarily the"
"side of the cell so so all of this i"
"think is"
"really tricky as far as who's deciding"
"what on whose behalf and who's forcing"
"what other system into a different uh"
"fate than they otherwise would have had"
"it's it's it's very non obvious and so"
"in a worm where you are"
"you know leading it to"
"generate two heads or you take a"
"salamander and you regrow its limbs even"
"so going from the sort of the"
the
non
"i don't want to say non-natural but the"
"sort of the the bodily organization"
"that's not found in nature"
"to the regular aspect of regrowth"
"is there a difference in the sort of the"
"communication that's happening there or"
"is the only difference that it's coming"
from
"the outside versus"
internal
"i think that uh one one way to think"
"about this is um"
uh
"you can so so the biological example"
"well i'll just tell you what the"
"biological example is and we'll sort of"
"um we'll we'll dissect a little bit"
"what you can do what what you can have"
"is uh you can you can notice that the"
"pieces of a of a flower"
"have an electrical circuit every cell"
"has a particular set of ion channels and"
"the whole thing forms this giant"
"electrical circuit that has a number of"
"stable states and it has a number of"
"different conditions that it could land"
in
"and those electrical states"
"turn on and off various genes downstream"
"that cause heads or tails to be built in"
"various configurations"
"what the genome does really well is make"
"sure that by default without with"
"nothing else happening that electrical"
"circuit will always land in the correct"
"state one head of the right size and"
"shape for that species boom nice and"
"stable what we figured out how to do is"
"to go in and push the cells towards one"
"of these other stable states when you do"
"that you basically push it towards a"
"different memory i mean literally a"
"different memory of what a correct"
"planarian should look like so we could"
"so so then the pieces will make multiple"
"heads they will make heads belonging to"
"other species so this is you know you"
"said you just used the word natural a"
"moment ago it's natural in the sense"
"that there really are other species of"
"planaria crawling around with those"
"kinds of heads just not correct for this"
species
"back to this idea of hardware software"
"the hardware hasn't been changed and you"
"can innate you do this just by"
"manipulating the ion channels that's"
"correct that's correct and this is i"
"think what i meant at the beginning when"
"i said this isn't like your typical"
"biochemical situation because when i"
"took developmental biology in college i"
"mean granted this is like 15 years ago"
"it was like oh well this chemical is"
"being emitted over here this you know"
"embryo portion of the embryo is going to"
"start you know moving over this way and"
"there's these chemical gradients and"
"that's pretty much controlling"
"everything and you're like"
"no you can just grow a head wherever you"
"want as long as it gets the right"
"you know patterning somehow"
"i mean those things are not incompatible"
"so so all the things that you just said"
"are still happening right so so there"
"are still gradients there are still"
"chemicals there are still genes being"
"turned on and off all that is still"
happening
uh
"the the trick is to ask yourself well"
"here here's a simple question that"
"hardly anybody works on we still don't"
"know how does it know when to stop so so"
"here you see you've got a planarian you"
"cut you cut its head off and then the"
"cells will start to grow like crazy"
"faster than any tumor they start to grow"
"but then it stops why does it stop it"
"stops because the correct planarian head"
"has been finished"
"how and how does it know what a correct"
"planarian head is supposed to look like"
"and is this what you mean by memory"
"because i i guess when you when you"
"speak of memory i think of something"
"that has"
"been sort of held over from the past but"
"this seems like something that is"
"discovered in the future do you know"
"what i mean by that"
"yeah um so so so i i use a very generic"
"definition of memory so so memory is a a"
"some sort of physical data structure"
"that guides your future behavior based"
"on things that have happened in the past"
"so that could be that could be computer"
"memory that could be behavioral memory"
"that could be pattern memory um it's"
"it's it's a memory because what we can"
"do is we can take a planarian"
"change the electrical pattern"
"and it'll just"
"sit there and then nothing is happening"
"until you cut the head off it's a latent"
"memory it's not active when you cut the"
"head so it's a memory"
"of what you're going to do in the future"
"if you get injured it's a counter"
"factual memory right and in fact it's a"
"false memory because we've because"
"instead of a nice picture of a"
"one-headed worm you're now carrying this"
"this weird idea of what a worm is"
"supposed to look like it's actually a"
two-headed
"two-headed shape so it's kind of a false"
"memory but whatever it's your memory and"
"so now"
"uh when you do get injured the the cells"
"will build to that they will use that"
"memory as the as their set point of what"
"a correct planarian should look like and"
"when can we stop can we stop when we've"
"made one head no because the memory of"
"what a correct planarian is is two heads"
"and and think about think about the"
"simplest way to think about this think"
"about your thermostat in your house"
"right the thermostat is a very simple"
"example of of like the basement of"
"agential systems it has a simple memory"
"what does it remember it only remembers"
"one thing what is the correct"
"temperature and it needs to know that"
"and it's encoded and uh it will keep"
"working as hard as it can to make sure"
"that that that's the actual that the"
"delta the error between the the measure"
"temperature and this memory is as low as"
"possible that's what all these"
"regenerative systems do they measure the"
"error which when you get injured the air"
"goes sky high stress goes up you're"
"stressed the stress is i gotta i gotta"
"reduce this i gotta reduce this stress i"
"gotta reduce that error and i'm gonna do"
"whatever i can to get back to the set"
"point in the meantime some scientists"
"like us came along and changed the set"
"point so hold on i have a question about"
"this and this might be a stupid question"
"so when you cut the head off of a worm"
"i imagine that there's two ways in which"
"it can regrow"
"one is just this sort of"
"almost 3d printed version where the"
front
"each each layer of cells that is"
"deposited has the structures within it"
"and they basically build until the"
"structure is in three-dimensional space"
"appropriate and then they stop"
"versus a sort of more"
"root-based way of things growing where"
"you have"
"let's say you develop the circular syst"
"the circulatory system and then cells"
"grow out from that like leaves on a tree"
"which way does a planarian regrow its"
head
"neither a planarian does something"
"entirely different so so what a"
"planarian does is is is kind of amazing"
"uh and what they do is you see all the"
"planarian cells and this we have no idea"
"how this works but all the planarian"
"cells uh together the collective not"
"individual cells but the collective has"
"a really good idea of what the size and"
"scale of a proper planarian is so what"
"happens is when you chop off the head"
"the remaining cells at the at the wound"
"become a head become"
"nose i mean there's no nose but you know"
"the tip of the they basically decide"
"that they are now the tip of the the"
"front with the most anterior tip of the"
"planarian the cells behind them will say"
"well then i must be brain and so they"
"will remodel themselves to be a brain"
"the cells behind them say well i got to"
"be you know something else and the whole"
"thing as it's regenerating the whole"
"thing is shrinking why is it shrinking"
"because when the new tiny little head"
"forms you don't want to be a big"
"planarian with a tiny head that doesn't"
"work you want to be you want to be"
"perfectly proportioned so it's it's"
"absolutely amazing they keep their"
"proportion the rest of the animals"
"shrinks to be correctly sized and shaped"
"much smaller worm right so so that's"
"what happens and"
"why why can't humans do this"
"uh humans can do this uh when they are"
"very very young so human embryos you"
"know what happens when you cut a human"
"embryo in half right you get twins you"
"get you get monozygotic twins yeah so so"
"i you know i i remind my students when"
"they say oh man you know as planaria are"
"amazing they can they can regenerate"
"from even a small fraction of their body"
"so well half of you can regenerate a"
"whole human from one cell right so so we"
"can we can do that we all start life as"
"a fertilized egg and we regenerate i"
"mean development i think and this is"
"also controversial but i think i think"
"that development is just a um a special"
"case of regeneration"
"so can you get to can you cut the"
"planarians in such a way and have them"
"that they regenerate into two worms"
"because that seems like to i mean and"
"well they do i mean you can cut it you"
"can the record is like 276 pieces and"
"every piece gives rise to a worm to a"
"full-on worm"
"they're definitely"
"multicellular organisms that are"
"able to regenerate whole organ systems"
"right i mean a head like they're"
"sexually reproduced"
"uh they can some planarian species can"
yeah
"they they often don't bother i mean"
"which which is which is a whole other"
interesting
"uh that's a whole other interesting"
"thing imagine"
"when when we when when creatures"
"reproduce through sperm and egg right"
"there's there's this thing we have which"
"is called weissman's barrier which is"
"the idea that if you get some crazy"
"mutation in your body during your"
"lifespan that doesn't transfer to your"
"children because your children all come"
"from one cell right the rest of your"
"body is disposable"
"in and then that and that's uh in in"
"planaria that's not true because the way"
"they generally reproduce not all species"
"but the way some species reproduce is"
"they tear themselves in half they"
"literally tear themselves in half the"
"front half makes a new tail the back end"
"makes a new head now you got two worms"
"great right now you've reproduced so if"
"you do that think about what that means"
"that means that every mutation that"
"doesn't kill this the stem cell that it"
"hits is amplified into the new into the"
"offspring and so and so this is why the"
"the genomes of the planarians are an"
"incredible mess they're mixed employed"
"they have different numbers of"
"chromosomes for god's sake and right and"
"you don't even know you know we the"
"genetics are a mess we don't have a"
"proper assembly for some of these"
"species because we don't you don't know"
"what you're sequencing every cell has a"
"different number of chromosomes now"
"think about what that but think about"
"what that means right um"
"for 400 million years you've been"
"accumulating mutations every cell has a"
"different number of chromosomes you're a"
"complete mess at the genetic level and"
"you are the world champion regenerator"
"your anatomy is rock solid every time"
"you get caught 100 of the time you make"
"the correct thing"
"yeah 100 of the time like you never see"
"like a mis-shaped worm come out of a cup"
"it's extremely rare if you cut if you"
"cut very thin tiny pieces they get"
"confused sometimes you can do that but"
"regular but but just you know normal"
"cuts into into large chunks they never"
"screw up they always do it right and so"
"how is that possible yeah it does like"
"this lead to a lot of problems do you"
"get a lot of really deranged planarium"
"like whole species of monsters or no no"
"absolutely no absolutely not and so so"
"this is so so i want to say two things"
"about that that are interesting one one"
"is that"
"think about think about how little we"
"must know about the relationship between"
"the genome and the anatomy when"
"you can basically trash the genome from"
"hundreds of millions of years and still"
"have rock solid anatomy if you if you"
"didn't know about planaria you went"
"through a developmental biology or a"
"genetics class and somebody said to you"
"at the end i want you to make a"
"prediction i'm gonna i'm gonna screw up"
"the genome so bad your cells are gonna"
"be mixed applied like a tumor that has"
"different you know we know that in"
"tumors there's genetic you know damage"
"and whatever the different numbers of"
"chromosomes i'm going to do that what do"
"you think your anatomy is going to be"
"like what would you have said right any"
"normal person going through a genetics"
"or a developmental biologist class would"
"say oh man you're going to be a mess"
"you're going to be a tumor at best right"
yeah
"so so ours and that does happen though"
"right like we do have there are"
"definitely teratomas"
"there's uh there's developmental"
"disorders that you know babies are born"
"with multiple chromosomes and it makes"
"makes problems right so"
"sometimes but we're not very but but you"
"see we're not very regenerative is the"
"problem right right so what is that"
"hinge what is the"
"no nobody has any idea"
"my point my point is not that i have an"
"answer to it yes my point my point is"
"that i think it's very critical to keep"
"an eye on your your knowledge gaps"
"because because people go through a"
"whole education in genetics and"
"developmental biology and they never"
"hear this stuff right and"
"when you read a developmental biology or"
"genetic textbook"
"you get the feeling that yeah this is"
"cool we got this under control you know"
"we know a bunch of stuff and and i'm"
"saying no no there are fundamental gaps"
"in our knowledge that we don't even we"
"we have no idea what what what's going"
"on here because nobody would have"
"predicted that that this that this that"
"this thing would be true um the other"
"thing uh so so that's you know so so"
"that's uh that that's kind of um an"
"important thing about"
"about about plenary is that there's"
"about any of this is that there's this"
"distinction between"
"what the hardware is going to do and"
"what the um you know the uh the"
"specification of the hardware you get"
"out of the genome and then the amazing"
"ability of the software to do all kinds"
"of interesting things and we can get"
into
"all the plasticity and the you know"
"including the zenobots that you"
"mentioned and all the other types of"
"amazing problem solving that we see it's"
"just there are huge things we don't"
"understand when we talked you on the"
"phone earlier uh before the show"
"you mentioned that so the zenobot stuff"
"got a lot of coverage in the news um was"
"you seemed to express that you felt like"
"some aspects of that had been handled"
poorly
"do you do you recall mentioning this or"
"you felt like"
"you felt like some of the key points"
"were sort of glossed over well this is"
"true i i don't you know uh i i don't"
"know what handled poorly i i certainly"
"think that a lot of people"
"have not yet understood what i think to"
"be the main uh the main importance of"
"this and other people focused on aspects"
"of this that i think they got you know"
"they they got the story wrong um and"
"then there have been some just"
"completely crazy uh news stories that"
"just totally screwed up the facts uh you"
"know in a very wild way"
"so that sounds about right what uh what"
"do you think are the salient features"
"that that maybe got missed or or could"
"have been centered better well"
"there's there's a couple of things uh"
"let's start off with um with what i"
"think what i think is is is important"
"and significant here"
"there are three ways in which this whole"
"technology is uh and just to just to"
"remind in case anybody doesn't know what"
"this is this is the observation that"
"when you"
"then this is this is joint work that um"
"is done"
"in collaboration with joshua baumgardt's"
"lab at the university of vermont and"
"this is sam kriegman uh who's the"
"computer scientist and doug blackiston"
"who's the in my group who's the"
"biologist um this is a joint project and"
"uh it's it's it's the observation that"
"when you take skin cells from a frog"
"embryo and you liberate them from the"
"instructions that normally say"
"you're going to have a very boring life"
"you're going to sit there quietly as a"
"two-dimensional layer on the outside of"
um
"on the outside of the embryo you're"
"going to keep out the pathogens that's"
"what you're going to do and so so when"
"you liberate cells from that condition"
"you you take these skin cells you put"
"them in a sep in a different environment"
"and you basically say well now you don't"
"have those instructive cues you can"
"reimagine your multicellularity what are"
"you going to be right what are you going"
"to do and they could have done all kinds"
"of things they could have crawled off"
"they could have made a monolayer like a"
"cell culture they could have died they"
"could have done all sorts of things"
"instead what they do"
"is they come together in about 48 hours"
"they come together and they form this"
"new creature that we call a zenobot for"
"xenopus lavis is the name of the frog"
"and it's a biobot and it makes this"
"little proto-organism that does all"
"kinds of amazing things it it swims"
"around on its own it has all kinds of"
"behaviors it has group behaviors it has"
"individual behaviors it can regenerate"
"if you damage it it um it and it does"
"all these interesting things so one of"
"the most amazing things that it does"
"is that"
"because it can't reproduce the normal"
"way because it doesn't have the normal"
"frog reproductive organs it it figured"
"out a completely new way to replicate"
"itself so what it can do is if you give"
"it a bunch of loose cells it basically"
"does a version of what"
"what von neumann was was toying with"
"this idea of a replicator that goes"
"around and collects parts and builds a"
"copy of itself they basically run around"
"and they and they heard like like"
"sheepdogs they heard a bunch of loose"
"cells into little piles and sculpt them"
"into other xenobots and guess what they"
"do they will run around and do the same"
"thing and there's you know three or four"
"generations down"
so
"and and there's no genetic there's no"
"genomic editing anywhere here if you"
"sequence these things all you're gonna"
"ever see is xenopus labels and you have"
"no idea you would have zero i this is"
"this is going back to that that idea of"
"how much do we really know about the"
"genome and the anatomy"
"if you can have something that acts and"
"looks in a completely different way and"
"has the same wild type anatomy with the"
"same wild type genome right and do you"
"think that this is possible with cells"
"from or from other organisms or is there"
"something special about there's there's"
"nothing froggy about this i i i can't go"
"into details now because i don't talk"
"about unpublished work but you know in"
"these contexts but"
"i can just tell you this has nothing to"
"do with fraud it's it it's it's a much"
"more no more embryos it's a much more"
"general phenomenon so you think that you"
"could make something like this from"
"human cells"
"yeah we we will see stay tuned oh we"
will
"need some permission for that problem"
"we'll we'll see yeah"
"put that on your account"
"so let's so so let me let me just uh let"
"me just uh finish finish that at that"
point
so
"so this is this is what they're doing"
"with their standard genomes right"
and
"what what i think is what i think is is"
"really significant here"
"is that"
"for every other creature on earth if you"
"ask the question why does it look the"
"way it looks why does it have the"
"behavior it has why is it this color why"
"is that this many eyes the answer is"
"always the same because for millions of"
"years the ancestors were selected for"
"this and that"
"that doesn't exist here these things"
"never existed before all of these cells"
"were selected to be a nice quiet uh skin"
"skin layer right instead on their own"
"they have a much more exciting life"
"they're autonomous they run around they"
"do all kinds of stuff"
"so the question of where do these things"
"come from where does its body plan come"
"from right if you ask where does a frog"
"body plan come from well people will say"
"well selection you know millions of"
"years of selection for being a nice frog"
"well where does xenoblack bodies come"
"from there's never been selection it's"
"an artificial selection is it not i mean"
"if you're scraping off this skin cell"
"versus that but we're not selecting them"
"but i mean but we're not selecting them"
"i mean we do not know anything that it"
"takes to build a robot that does this"
"kind of stuff right the answer to how"
"does it know to you know to to do all"
"these things is not because mike and"
"josh made them do it i mean there's a"
"component of the project where we use"
"machine learning to kind of nudge them"
"towards specific outcomes right and"
"that's that's very important to learn to"
"do this um"
"by like tuning the soup or something or"
"not yet although that's where it's going"
"up until now we've just been sculpting"
"the ai says you know if you just cut"
"away of you know some cells from here to"
"there they'll they'll move better or"
"they'll do certain things um"
"so so so look there's there's there's"
"three really important things about"
"about all this one is that it's uh at"
"some point we'll have useful synthetic"
"living machines so that you know they'll"
be
"scraping the plaque off your artery"
"walls or chasing down tumor cells in"
"your gut or something you know there's"
"all kinds of useful applications"
"uh the second thing is that they're"
"teaching us about how to how do"
"collectives of cells make decisions"
"about what to be"
"that that's the answer to regenerative"
"medicine though"
"the whole field of regenerative medicine"
"is is basically stuck because we don't"
"know the answer to that question"
"how do collections of cells make"
"decisions about what they're going to do"
"the genome is not the answer stem cell"
"biology is not the answer uh"
"we do not understand how collectives of"
"cells make decisions large scale"
"decisions this is a sandbox mod a"
"platform it's a you know it's a very"
"simple system it's one with you know one"
"type of tissue just to skin um"
"okay so so so ultimately what this is"
"for way beyond useful or you know useful"
"machines is we are going to try to"
understand
"how do you how do cells get their goals"
"collect collectives of cells get their"
"goals where did the goal of being a"
"zenobot come from because it showed up"
"in 48 hours did not require millions of"
"years of evolution so the question is"
"where did that goal come from and more"
"importantly how do we re-specify it so"
"if we if i said you know um that's great"
"and all but i don't want a rounds and a"
"but i want a long flat one and and i"
"wanted to do this and that like what"
"what what are the signals that i need to"
"give you because once we crack that"
"that's the key to proper regenerative"
"medicine where we can make new organs we"
"can fix birth defects we can reprogram"
"tumors so is that because you'd"
"understand the goals of the organ cells"
"and you could kind of give them what"
"they want and they'll just"
"execute their"
"you it'll it'll be a combination of"
"giving them what they want meaning"
"meaning uh incentivizing them with"
"rewards and punishments and a"
"combination of re-specifying the goal"
"states just like in the plenary if your"
"goal state for whatever reason is"
"screwed up and you think you're going to"
"be a tumor i got a better goal state for"
"you here here's a new pattern memory"
"that you're going to follow and i'm"
"going to incentivize that with a little"
"bit of you know whatever reward or"
"punishment or whatever whatever you're"
"going to do"
"and then and then the bigger picture and"
"this sort of takes us back to this"
"conversation about like society and then"
"everything that we were talking about"
"the bigger picture i i see this as a"
"uh as an existential"
"as as mitigation of existential risk for"
"humanity i mean look at this we are"
"surrounded by systems large-scale"
"systems like internet of things uh"
"you know computer networks uh swarm"
"robotics social structures um financial"
"structures we have of only the barest"
"beginnings of a science of knowing what"
"do these collectives want as goals we"
"have absolutely no idea in some way"
"we've turned ourselves into cells that"
"are part of a larger organ that's"
"correct and the cells have no clue what"
"the organism is going to want to do what"
"are the what are the goals of the larger"
"scale system in fact if you think of uh"
"think of"
"shrinking yourself down to the level of"
"a single cell inside of an early embryo"
"and you're looking around and you're"
"seeing all the stuff that's happening"
"and all the noise and chaos and cells"
"are dying off and moving from it falling"
"off and all this stuff would you ever in"
"a million years know that this is going"
"to make a 100 reliable fish or frog or"
"human you would never know that if you"
"didn't already know about embryonic"
"development and the fact that was"
"reliable you would never know that"
"that's what was going to happen"
"and yeah so"
"go ahead go ahead sorry well just to"
"finish up so so so we are we are"
"surrounding ourselves with complex"
"systems that are going to have goals"
"those goals are going to be different"
"from ours they're going to be as"
"inscrutable to us as the goals of the"
"organism are to the cells you know when"
"you think about your your goals in the"
"morning or your life plan for the next"
"uh you know three years uh"
"the cells in your body and the organs"
"and the tissues don't even have the the"
"the beginnings of a cognitive system to"
"appreciate what what's going to what's"
"going to go on here right we're"
"surrounding ourselves with with this and"
"we do not"
"have a good science of anticipating and"
"managing collective goals so so my point"
"is if we can learn from some frog skin"
"which by the way frogs are shedding into"
"rivers all the time so you know uh"
"people get all crazy about this but"
"that i mean that's another thing because"
"oh my god you know these these zenobots"
"this is frog skin for god's sake do you"
"you understand that we've had our we've"
"had synthetic bacteria viruses both"
"natural and synthetic we've had germ"
"warfare we've had genetically modified"
"um uh you know organisms being released"
"like compared to all of that this should"
"be so far down on your list of things to"
"worry about it's ridiculous"
"the news cycle is hungry well the news"
"cycle is hungry and i did i did have"
"this weird feeling when they were"
"starting to release genetically modified"
"mosquitoes where i was like why is no"
"one freaking out about this it was very"
"sort of just matter some people i mean"
"some people did freak out about it uh"
"people i personally was freaking out"
"about it because i'm like we have"
"crossed the rubicon at this point like"
"this is this is"
"a huge decision to make to drive a"
"specific parasite or disease-carrying"
"mosquito to extinction i'm like i don't"
"know that we've given enough"
"yeah i mean we've kind of"
"no you're right but i mean we've kind of"
"done that before i mean we've driven"
"we've we've more or less driven polio to"
"extinction right we've uh with with"
"native native wheat and and all the like"
"like the old school crops that are"
"almost gone now"
"yeah yeah we we've been doing that for a"
"while and i think that um people are"
"just so tired of it that they're like uh"
"what's another one"
"uh no i don't think so because because"
"when they hear about the zenobots they"
"suddenly are full of energy again"
"and they friend them people freak out i"
"just i i think we ought to uh"
"be really realistic about um"
"apportioning our limited our finite"
"energy for concern right apportioning it"
"proportionally to what's an actual"
"problem and i think we have plenty of"
"problems to worry about this is an"
"extremely safe system"
"in which to understand a really critical"
"thing which is where complex systems get"
"their goals like that's crucial"
"do you oh god i was going to say do you"
"do you think that you could go out into"
"the environment and find"
self-made
xenobots
"like you say that frog skin is getting"
"shed into the environment um"
"i'm sure that there's lots of other skin"
"cells from lots of other animals our own"
"skin cells get washed down the drain"
"right yeah yeah it's it's an interesting"
"it's an interesting point um i read just"
"yesterday i read a paper about um cancer"
"and clams and the amazing thing about"
"clam cancer is that the individual clam"
"uh tumor cells get released into the"
"waterway and they find their way to"
"other clams and they get in there and"
"they infect them"
"so they're sort of a they can live on"
"their own and and i i have i i don't"
"know if you you got to see that um"
"life death and self paper but but i talk"
"about that exactly that you could"
"imagine an organism it wouldn't be a you"
"know wouldn't be a"
"mammal because it doesn't have it"
"wouldn't work in dry land but in the"
"water you could imagine an organism that"
"when the organism dies"
"there's still a bunch of living cells in"
"there right there's lots of you know"
"when a fish or a frog dies for whatever"
"reason there's plenty of living cells in"
"there they could in theory that could be"
"a life um uh a"
"kind of a kind of a life history where"
"the cells go off they go off on their"
"own and they either become amoebas and"
"live as amoebas or they come back and"
"they become some kind of a zen about"
"looking thing you know and then you know"
"maybe they develop another developmental"
"sequence like all of that are perfectly"
"viable life strategies that you might"
find
"maybe on earth maybe somewhere else um"
"yeah i don't see why not this really"
"puts into perspective the funeral rights"
"of various cultures the fact that we're"
"like so like you know what we got to"
"make sure that that body cannot do"
"anything after death it's still very"
"much alive"
"why do you call them bots instead of"
"straight-up organisms like you one of"
"the one of the really cool papers you"
"sent us i'll try to put all these in the"
"description too is"
"uh where you're sort of making this"
"dichotomy between machines and organisms"
"well i'm trying to burn down the"
"dichotomy i'm sorry"
"yeah sort of interesting are you"
"thinking about the one where it was"
"talking about the intelligence of"
"machines yeah you do make some like"
"specifications right uh where like uh"
"anastasia says you're saying that you"
"know organisms aren't intelligence at"
"all these skills and"
"uh machines never could be even"
"intelligent and i've never didn't i've i"
"i've never said they couldn't be i would"
"i what i think okay so no no i don't"
"think so hopefully hopefully there is a"
"heading in one of the papers that says"
"machines are not intelligent and never"
"oh yes yes that's because but"
"yes yes but that's because those"
"headings if you look at all the headings"
"we are basically what we're doing is"
"we're we're trying to we're trying to"
"demolish the the the typical statements"
"that are made by people i see i"
"all of the all of those headings are"
"things that we are but basically the"
"rest of the text is trying to shoot it"
down
"so you're trying to say that the the"
"idea of a machine as we understand it is"
"outdated and that we need to start"
"thinking about machines in different"
ways
"here's here's what i think uh"
"this a lot of the terminology that"
"people use around this machines robots"
"um organisms uh intelligence a lot of"
"these things the the definitions we have"
"now are not going to survive the next"
"couple of decades they are based on"
"extremely outmoded criteria that are i"
"mean look in the olden days some number"
"of decades ago you could walk up to"
"something if you didn't know what it was"
"you could knock on it and if you heard a"
"clanging metallic sound you could you"
"could know several things it came off a"
"factory i'm morally uh in my rights to"
"do whatever i want with this thing take"
"it apart put it in the garbage keep fine"
"and it's going to be boring and it's not"
"going to do anything interesting right"
"whereas if you do this and it's sort of"
"wet and and kind of squishy right and"
"and and you know sort of like that then"
"you would say ah this this was evolved"
"on earth it wasn't designed by by a mine"
"uh i better be nice to it and i can"
"expect some really interesting hygiene"
"you know if i if i have it in my house"
so
"that th"
"those conclusions were"
"made entirely based on the limitations"
"of past technology they're not deep"
"they're they're just so you know there's"
"a total crap basically at this point"
"they're not going to survive you now now"
"we have machines that that are that are"
"um that are evolved using using"
"evolutionary strategies there are"
"designed organisms um"
"going into the future what you look like"
"and what you're made of and how you got"
"here your origin story are going to be"
"terrible guides to your moral um"
"standing and to your cognitive capacity"
"they're going to be terrible you you"
"will we will be surrounded this is"
"something i was just writing about the"
"other day"
"we are going to be surrounded by every"
"possible combination of"
"the evolved living material um designed"
"uh artificial materials and software"
"every kind that you can think of the the"
"the you know that star wars cantina"
"scene is gonna be just totally tame"
"compared to what how we're actually"
"going to be living and this distinction"
"when people say machines can't do this"
and
"if you just if you just push on that a"
"little bit and say okay tell me what a"
"machine is tell me what a robot is and"
"by the way that definition better be"
"useful beyond like 1960. you know it"
"better be a modern definition that that"
"doesn't lean on these ridiculous"
"limitations that are just not even true"
"anymore certainly not going to be true"
"in the future so so that's yeah so"
"that's and if i recall first of all i"
"love that you're obsessed with"
"definitions that's something that we are"
"completely nuts about domestic science"
"and our you know we have a facebook"
"group and most of what we do is argue"
"about definitions and so that's awesome"
"what and i believe you"
"just before we go any further that the"
"machines you define as basically"
"they have to be useful right is that"
something
"that's that's one way to that's one way"
"to do it um i think is so so just to"
"back up a second here's what i think"
"about definitions"
"definitions are meant to the the the"
"reason you want definitions is to"
"facilitate progress you don't want"
"definitions that uh that that hinder you"
"from from thinking in various ways and"
"so to me"
"there are no"
"and this this also gets me crazy some"
"people will say well that's just a"
"metaphor and it's not okay everything is"
"a metaphor there's there's no we don't"
"have it we don't have access at least i"
"don't believe that we have access to any"
"any real objective truth ever what we"
"have access to are metaphors which can"
"be good they can be more or less useful"
"right so what my so i'm going to suggest"
that
"to the extent that you want to use the"
"word machine for example um"
"it better be a definition that is that"
"is useful in some fashion it helps you"
"do something so to me"
"right now a useful definition of machine"
"doesn't have anything to do with what"
"you're made of or whether you were"
"designed or evolved i i think the"
"salient and i'm not saying i have the"
"best answer by the way i'm sure i'm sure"
"there's plenty of work to be done to get"
"better definitions of all of all of this"
"but i think the interesting thing about"
"a machine"
"is that it's a system that works"
"according to uh understandable logical"
"rules that's able to be manipulated to"
"uh for specific outcomes so now a"
"machine is something that you can with"
"with sufficient effort and brain power"
"you can say okay i see how this works"
"and part of seeing how this works is if"
"i wanted to change it to do something it"
"doesn't normally do here's how i would"
"do that right anything you can do that"
"too that's that's a machine so um i also"
"the other important thing about all of"
"this is that i don't believe in binary"
"definitions for almost anything so"
"there's no such thing as i i don't think"
"yes this is a machine that is not a"
"machine it there's no binary"
"about machines there's no binary about"
"cognition about consciousness about"
"intelligence it's never does it or"
"doesn't it it's always how much and what"
"kind so if somebody shows me"
"uh somebody shows me um uh you know a"
"bacterium i'm going to say"
"yes that's that's quite a it's got many"
"properties of what you consider an"
"organism it's got quite a few properties"
"of what you consider a machine by the"
"time you get to a human has some of the"
"properties of the machine there's a lot"
"you can do with the physiology and the"
"behavior and there's a but it's got a"
"bunch of other stuff that really you"
"wouldn't help you to treat it as a"
"machine at least now it wouldn't maybe"
"sometime in the future you could um so"
"does context have a lot to do with this"
"then like does a definition need to be"
"set in some place like you know if i'm"
"sitting here next to a washing machine"
"and we're trying to decide which of two"
"of us is the machine"
"maybe one definition would work quite"
"nicely whereas if you're comparing me to"
something
"that's a little bit more on the edge"
"where you're talking about like an"
"engineered organ or something"
"it's kind of"
"you know a little bit tricky"
"like a pancreas versus an insulin pump i"
"think is maybe like a better"
"boy uh yeah i think uh i i think they're"
"the they're certainly both kinds of"
"machines they have different uh"
"there's some different properties and"
"and the they're"
"useful in different circumstances i"
"think it's not just context they think"
"it's all observer dependent so it's"
"everything to to me everything is in the"
"eye of the beholder it's in the eye of"
"the observer now the observer by the way"
"might be the system itself when it looks"
"at itself we can talk about that in a"
"minute but but if i if i look at"
"something and i say"
"it and it's the same thing with seeing"
"intelligence if i look at uh at"
"at you and the washing machine and my"
"goal is to i need a paperweight i need a"
"really good paperweight i look at the"
"washing machine i go that's awesome that"
"thing i'm going to set that thing down"
"on my papers that's not going anywhere"
"you are a terrible paperweight because"
"you have a tendency to get up and wander"
"around i don't like it so right yeah so"
"so that's so that's one thing on the"
"other hand if i want uh you know if i if"
"i want um you know if i want you to uh"
uh
"you know do do some kind of useful thing"
"i'm gonna say this washing machine is"
"very limited i'm never gonna get this"
"thing to like guard my house or do"
"anything else all it does is this one"
"thing it's a very boring kind of machine"
"i you know you look at an organism you"
"say that that is a much more interesting"
"machine that has all kinds of stuff and"
"and maybe i can get it to do certain"
"things and maybe i can't because it's a"
"it's a it's a kind of machine that is"
"self-motivated and at some point you"
"might decide to just leave and then you"
know
"uh yeah so it's in the eye of the of the"
"observer all of this"
"it's just terrifying because does that"
"kind of destroy the any chance of"
"defining life itself"
"if we can't really"
"separate machines from organisms"
"well look uh"
"what what do we really what useful"
"definition of life do we really have to"
"begin with if if you you ask yourself if"
"if uh what what tools do we have when we"
"go to other planets and uh or synthetic"
"biology if i may i mean already people"
"make all kinds of stuff that that you"
"can have a week of arguments about"
"whether it's it's primitive life or not"
"right um and and and and knowing what"
"you find on"
you
"you're sitting home one day and uh"
"spaceship lands on your front lawn and"
"this this thing trundles out and it's"
"kind of shiny and metallic but it walks"
"up to you and it's got this poem that it"
"wrote on the way over right and it's"
"like look i i'm here to meet you here"
"and you're looking at it and so now"
"what do you have in your toolkit that"
"you're going to say is it alive is it is"
it
"does it have cognition was it made by"
"someone did it evolve somewhere we"
"usually i mean we usually start i mean"
"we argue about this non-stop within our"
"social media and so forth it's actually"
"one of our favorite topics is what is"
"life and like the closest we've gotten"
"is something like autonomous intention"
"like the some some"
"expression of intention"
"do you you know do you but if if these"
"machines are going to be capable of"
"goal-oriented behavior then it's like"
"and it's autonomous to some extent"
"i mean defining i i i i'm sympathetic to"
"what you're trying to do but but i think"
"defining that in a in a rigorous way is"
"brutally hard right i mean you're you're"
"you know your roomba has autonomous uh"
"intentions and it's been programmed by"
"us but you know"
"yeah but but but it's not difficult to"
"set up a um"
"an evo you know an evolving uh algorithm"
"that would just would evolve this from"
"scratch right it's i i don't i don't"
"find it particularly"
"helpful i i don't even know look i don't"
"even know that the word life is"
"particularly useful that's what i was"
"getting at yeah right like i i've always"
"had this feeling that the question of"
"what is alive versus what isn't alive is"
"a question of"
"how can i treat this object"
"yes yes and i 100 agreed i think i think"
"that is all that is about that is what"
"all of this stuff is about i think that"
that
"alive is not particularly useful it was"
"useful pre"
"you know i don't know at the turn of the"
"century it was useful because it was"
"pretty clear that"
"you could segregate things into alive"
"and not alive and that would that would"
"correlate great with how you're supposed"
"to treat that kind of kind of right"
"because if you look at something like"
"the biosphere it's very hard to look at"
"earth and be like earth is alive and yet"
"when it comes down to looking at the"
"turn of the century and you have the"
"industrial revolution and you have the"
"consumption of raw materials there's"
"nothing inherently bad about breaking up"
"a mountain and taking"
"coal or whatever else out of it but"
"there is something about the extractive"
"process which if you're able to look at"
"the earth as being alive despite the"
"fact that it's this object you begin to"
"have a different attitude"
"towards the way that you can treat it"
"and so i'm not sure that it was"
"necessarily possible to easily bend"
"things even a hundred years ago i think"
"people did"
"yeah i you you're right of course uh i"
"think i think you're right um the"
"problem is that a live we we have a we"
"have a terrible history of um"
"not using the the category of alive to"
"dictate proper uh proper behavior right"
"so we we farm animals and we we do all"
"kinds of uh horrible things to things"
"that we're pretty sure are alive right"
"so i think long before you get to worry"
"about whether the mountain the kind of"
"ecosystem was alive we've got questions"
"about factory farming and and what we do"
"to each other and various kinds of"
"things right so so i think alive"
doesn't
"really do the trick in fact i don't know"
"what it does i honestly don't know of"
"any really great useful things you can"
"get out of the word alive i mean here's"
"one thing what about like large-scale"
"physics you know there's like the motion"
"of so i mean this might not actually be"
"relevant to things on earth but"
"certainly a lot of people spend their"
"careers trying to figure out why the"
"heck the galaxies are rotating the way"
"they are and things like that and"
"there's no consideration to"
"intentionality in those processes"
"because we don't consider them alive"
"um why"
"i think that the question of whether or"
"not there's intentionality there has"
"nothing to do with whether or not or how"
"alive it is i think i think there are"
"plenty of things that have"
"intentionality that you wouldn't say are"
"alive maybe again i don't know what"
"saying that"
"when you when you say something is or"
"isn't alive what does that allow you to"
"then assume i almost know as far as i"
"can tell almost no i guess you could"
"explain something without relying upon"
"newtonian physics or you know"
traditional
"momentum based calculations right you"
"can be like okay well the reason these"
"things don't orbit the way that we"
"thought they would is not because"
"there's an invisible"
"substance there or something it's just"
"because they don't want to"
"something like that"
"that's a whole other so so that's not"
"about being alive that's about picking"
"the right level of agency for any given"
"system and i will say i have a whole"
"story i can tell about that but but"
"basically i think"
"i think the the interesting thing is"
"that i don't think you can"
"much like with almost anything else i"
"don't think you can sit back in your arm"
"chair and make decisions on what's"
"agential and what's not you've got to do"
"experiments so so for just give you a"
"simple example um"
"gene regulatory networks right the"
"little little pathway arrow models that"
"people build all the time they're like"
"uh the paradigm example of determinism"
"there's no magic there's no weird forces"
"you know what all the genes are you know"
"what you know you know and and and"
"people treat them as as you know kind of"
"deterministic systems and they work"
"because there's a lot so it may not be"
"newtonian but whatever it is"
um
"and then and then a bunch of people a"
"few a few groups and in our lab as well"
"show that actually they can learn they"
"have they have including associate of"
"learning right so they have a tiny"
"little bit of agency i mean it's tiny"
"it's nano but they can learn which means"
"that in your relationship to them you"
"don't just push things around at the"
"hardware level you can train them with"
"experience what does that mean that they"
learn
"meaning that their future behavior is is"
"um uh altered by their past experiences"
"i give you a simple example of"
"associative learning"
"you have a you have a pathway gene"
"regulatory network you have a drug that"
"causes a particular outcome right"
"and what you can do is you can take and"
"then you have another drug that targets"
"another part of the network that doesn't"
"cause that outcome right if you present"
"them together long enough over a few"
"iterations eventually you can just put"
"you can just provide the second one and"
"you'll get the same outcome it's"
"pavlov's dog that's right it's the bell"
"you know it's the bell and the meat"
"right because because the system has"
"that bit of memory that's able to"
"associate past stimuli remember them and"
"act upon them in the in the future now"
"nobody would have said that sitting back"
"in their arms or nobody would have said"
"that gee no i think i think uh pathways"
"could be agents nobody would have said"
"that you have to do experiments and so"
"when you talk about the galaxies okay i"
"i have no reason to think that this is"
"true however um this is something that i"
"was actually last year i was i was"
"driving a couple of astronomers crazy"
"trying to say could we could we could we"
"design a a galactic scale system of"
"synapses working in gravitational space"
"such that such that passages of of"
"masses would would would deflect certain"
"things that would hold state they would"
"have memories could make could make a"
"giant synapse like a"
"you know a solar system size synapse and"
"if we did and if we and there was"
"something like that would we know could"
"we tell that from the inside in other"
"words to me all of this is an ex"
"it's um these are all open questions to"
"be settled by experiment and you can do"
"experiments you how do you do"
"experiments on this"
"if you think about the um uh the i i"
"call this uh in in the paper that just"
"went up on the archive yesterday i call"
"it the um uh the continuum of"
"persuadability the question is how do"
"you relate this is exactly what you just"
"said how do you relate to the system so"
"just imagine this this continuum on the"
"left side you have"
"you have boring mechanisms like"
"mechanical clocks right if if that's"
"what you're dealing with"
"then then you're not going to convince"
"it of anything you're not going to"
"punish it you're not going to train it"
"you just have to rewire the hardware"
"that is the only way you're going to"
"relate to this thing then you then you"
"you go a little further on the continuum"
"you have an interesting system like a"
"thermostat now"
"that thing is interesting you're still"
"not going to convince it of anything"
"you're going to punish it but it has a"
"set point and what you what you can do"
"is you can alter the set point and get"
"the whole system to do something"
"different you don't even need to know"
"how it works really all you need to know"
"that it is in fact a thermostat and you"
"need to know how to read and write the"
"set point you need to know how to change"
"the set point and then so that's a"
"completely different way of interacting"
"with the system but because it's a goal"
"directed system you change the goals and"
"you let the system do what it does best"
"you don't rewire you just change the"
"rules go a little further and you've got"
"a rat and now that system has"
"preferences and it has it's it's able to"
"learn from rewards and punishments now"
"you don't need to know how it stores the"
"set points you don't need to rewire it"
"mechanically you can get it to do circus"
"tricks and all kinds of complex"
"behaviors with rewards and punishments"
"this is why humans have been training"
"animals for thousands of years without"
"knowing any neuroscience why can you do"
"that because you don't need to know that"
"the neuroscience you you you can relate"
"to it"
"from the level of motivation not from"
"the level of micromanagement and not the"
"level of set points right and then you"
"go further still and now you've got a"
"rational human and now you don't even"
"need to do any of that you can give them"
"a logical argument right a teeny-weeny"
"sort of amount of energy spent you just"
"say hey did you know that xyz and now"
"you're completely hands off you're"
"relying on that system to go oh my god"
"you're right well that means i gotta i"
"gotta you know i gotta you know work"
"towards world peace or whatever you're"
"gonna do you can launch this like"
"massive effort on the part of the system"
"you're not micromanaging it you're not"
"you don't know how it sets its you know"
"set points you're not rewarding it"
"directly you're communicating logic to"
"it right so all along here you have"
"different kinds of systems now when you"
"when you say uh the galaxy spinning"
"where are they along this thing i don't"
"know but i also think it's uh not a"
"great idea to just pick a spot and say"
"i'm sure it's there you know problem"
solved
"all of these things are empirical"
"questions and and let's just see"
"they're not they're not"
"it's not magic it's not philosophy it's"
"it's science let's let's see what is the"
"best system"
um
"i love that"
"um i know we've taken a lot of your time"
"already there's one last thing i really"
"wanted to ask you about um which you"
"have i'm gonna just read a little quote"
"from this paper this is the paper you"
"did in aeon uh is it the magazine that"
"journal is called aeon i believe with uh"
"dan dennett"
"and you say i'm going to read this"
"sentence thanks to charles darwin"
"biology doesn't ever have to invoke"
"quote intelligent"
"an intelligent designer who created all"
"of those mechanisms"
"evolution by natural selection has done"
"and is still doing all that refining and"
"focusing and differentiating work"
"when you when you make evolution an"
actor
"do you think that you're really moving"
"away from the idea of an intelligent"
"designer in that you have a conceptual"
"actor that's not actually a physical"
entity
"that's doing"
"yeah i think that's that's a great point"
"so so here's what i think we're doing"
"there what i think we're doing is saying"
that
"a designer"
"is not really what you think it is it's"
"it's you can you can be you don't need"
"to be an engineer with a pencil behind"
"your ear that's able to envision all the"
"different things that could happen and"
"and work towards them that's a kind of"
"designer and that's great there are"
other
"much more um miniature you know sort of"
"much more humble versions of that that"
"also produce amazing amazing pieces of"
"engineering and novelty and creativity"
and
"when we say that's not a designer um"
"ultimately i mean this was a look this"
"was a short piece you know okay we"
"couldn't go into all this stuff here and"
"actually i don't even know um you know"
"if dan would agree with everything i'm"
"saying here but i'm just gonna tell you"
"what i think i think that evolution is"
"not nearly as as dumb and short-sighted"
"as people say it is for a couple of"
"interesting reasons but i also think it"
"is not so far on the right of that scale"
"where where you could say it has"
"specific um you know sort of second"
"order goals and it knows where it's"
"going you know it's not that kind of"
"designer but but being again i don't"
"like this idea of designer being a"
"binary term"
"there's almost no binary terms that i"
"like and and i think that being a"
"designer is a matter of degree and i"
"think evolution is kind of a a small one"
"still still quite impressive actually um"
"but but but it's not the kind of"
"designer that you would want from a"
"human or you know or god or whatever"
"it's not that kind of designer but it is"
"still a"
"non-physical actor"
"it's a it's a process i mean what's a"
"physical actor i don't know we're not"
"physical actors either right we're we're"
"sort of meta-stable whirlpools of the"
"energy moving through you know a"
"particular construct like what's what's"
"what's really a physical actor i don't"
"know it's a sledgehammer i guess or"
"something i think that i think that"
"evolution is a physical actor to some"
"degree because you have these axiomatic"
"principles as to how molecules interact"
"and the outcome of those interactions"
"evolution's an idea though but evolution"
"is also a process which is which is"
"emergent from"
"cells living doing getting eaten versus"
"not getting eaten right so certainly"
"those cells are doing something but"
"just yeah i mean"
"i think"
"yeah i i think i think it's important to"
"um to keep in mind that evolution"
"is is much deeper evolution doesn't have"
"anything to do with cells really right"
"evolution you can do you can do"
"evolution in in an afternoon on on with"
"with algorithms uh"
"you you know that has that have nothing"
"to do with cells ever what what's what's"
"cool about i mean the evolution that"
"cells do is interesting for other"
"reasons but the core properties of"
"evolution this idea that you can do this"
"this all you need is three things you"
"need you need some kind of heredity"
"right you need you need um you need"
"limited resources and you need your"
"heredity not to be perfect so that"
"sometimes make mistakes that's it those"
"are the three things and and what are"
"the three things that that applies to"
"can anything it can be it can be um you"
"know it can be it can be concepts in"
"your head it can be uh engineered"
"artifacts it could be cells it's a very"
"generic kind of system and it has all"
"kinds of interesting properties that we"
"don't uh that we can't anticipate you"
"know in advance and and by the way when"
"you think of an actual designer"
um
"we don't have any idea what's so so so"
"we know how in in science we know how to"
"take something and say don't worry folks"
"there's no designer here here's how it"
"works through evolution"
"let's go the other direction let's take"
"an example of a designer that is"
"non-controversial here's our engineer"
"right and and she's sitting there with"
"you know the pencil behind her and just"
"designing something okay what is going"
"on in that case that's magical and"
"different from this other case i mean"
"what's happening in there i mean kind of"
"running through some options right and"
"saying okay these are all trash i'm"
"gonna focus on these four and i kind of"
"like this one this might"
"how how much different does that sound"
"than this other than this other system"
like
"i guess just because it's not embodied"
"right i guess it's like it's sort of"
"this disembodied actor which is very"
"it's just it just seems like often to me"
"like it's not that far off from a deity"
like
"if you have this"
"disembodied actor called evolution"
"that's doing stuff like the fact that it"
"has the verb do like it isn't it"
"you know what i'm saying i don't know i"
"know i know i know what you mean but but"
"but here's here's the thing uh i think"
"it only seems disembodied because we're"
"looking at the wrong scale so we are at"
"our scale and we're teeny tiny beings"
"both in space and time and when we say"
how
"where is all this cool stuff happening"
"evolution is a is in fact a lineage you"
"know 50 000 years of alligators or"
"whatever 50 million years um"
"that is an individual right it's it's a"
"massive individual we don't see it every"
"every genome is a hypothesis made in the"
"mind of that individual about what the"
"outside world is like those hypotheses"
"and this is you know from carl fristan's"
"work on um"
"on hypothesis uh testing in the brain uh"
"ev every each one of those hypotheses"
"gets tested many of them die because no"
"no good the good ones uh you know sort"
"of go go forth we're just looking at the"
"wrong scale if you if you back off and"
"look at a whole evolving lineage over a"
"massive you know time and spatial scale"
"then it's very embodied and you can"
"point to all the things you're used to"
"you can say here's where the computation"
"happens here's where the hypotheses are"
"formed here's where the hypotheses are"
"tested against the world it looks"
"exactly like uh the modern pictures of"
"the brain with active inference and"
"everything else so i i just you know at"
"a different scale things look different"
"and and so maybe there's a more"
"appropriate more physical term for that"
"meta actor that we just haven't really"
"stumbled upon right now and so we're"
"referring to the process as the actor in"
"the meantime or something like that"
"i i think actor"
