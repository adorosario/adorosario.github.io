"thanks everybody for joining us today"
"for our"
"regenerative medicine webinar from prime"
"movers lab with a focus on tissue"
"engineering have uh three incredible"
"panelists today and also joined by my"
"colleague brian baugh for those of you"
"who are in our community welcome again"
to
"to our webinar series and for those of"
"us that are"
"new for those of you that are new to"
"our webinar series this is part of prime"
"movers lab"
"work that we do in terms of"
"looking into the scientific areas and"
"areas where we're currently looking at"
"companies and conducting diligence and"
"really just sort of fascinated overall"
"we are a deep tech venture investing"
"firm and we do look for breakthrough"
"scientific inventions that have the"
"potential to impact billions of lives"
"and certainly this is one of those areas"
"that it's not overstating uh when we say"
"the potential to impact so many lives um"
"just as a little bit of housekeeping and"
"how our webinars work we will absolutely"
"keep it to an hour um brian and i will"
"kick it off with some questions from our"
"panelists after they've had a chance to"
"introduce themselves um but um other"
"than that probably about 20 minutes you"
"know with about 20 minutes to go in the"
"webinar we'll uh start collecting some"
"questions from the chat and from q a and"
"uh weave those into the further"
"discussion with the panelists today so"
"that's sort of how it rolls"
"um and then myself i am amy cruz i am"
"one of the general partners here at"
"prime movers lab my focus is on the life"
"sciences i'm a neuroscientist by"
"training and have had a pretty fun and"
"interesting career over the past two"
"decades and and now have turned all of"
"that into a focus on uh venture"
"investing and more specifically in our"
"human augmentation theme which is part"
of
"what the regenerative medicine topic"
"here today is and i would like to"
"introduce my colleague brian bah who is"
"also one of our partners and focuses on"
"manufacturing brian you want to say a"
"few words yeah thanks for having me i'm"
"excited my background is in large scale"
"in most streams mostly in an industrial"
"capacity so this will be pretty new and"
"informative to me also so i'm here to"
"ask some of the more layman's questions"
"that come along"
"amazing thanks brian and then um like to"
"just go through and have our panelists"
"sort of introduce themselves take a"
"couple of minutes maybe give a little"
"bit of background on themselves and then"
"we'll sort of kick it off from there so"
"maybe i'll start with eric eric lagasse"
"once you introduce yourself yeah hi so"
"i'm a"
"faculty at the university of pittsburgh"
"i'm also the chief scientific officer"
now
"at lightogenesis"
"my background really started with cell"
"biology stem cells"
"i was at stanford for a long time uh"
postdoc
"doing work with the"
"metabolic stem cells"
"then i moved to a company and then"
"eventually moved to the university of"
"pittsburgh very interested about cell"
"transplantation regenerative medicine"
"and really using the body uh uh as as"
"the place where we can regenerate in"
"vivo tissue and organ and particularly"
"with the liver that is a very"
"interesting organ"
"uh for originating the relative function"
"and potential the organization"
amazing
"harold how about you"
"yeah thanks amy uh i'm a thoracic"
"surgeon at mass general hospital and i"
"also i'm the chief scientific officer of"
"aviva medical which is a startup company"
"that focuses on regenerative medicine so"
"how i got to regenerative medicine uh"
"was really realizing how"
"we how bad we are still in medicine at"
"fixing chronic conditions you know in"
"some ways clinically i i try to tackle"
"one of the main"
"main challenges we face is a patient"
"suffering from cancer and i try to"
"literally in surgery remove it"
"but i encounter many situations"
"in daily clinical practice where i can't"
"help my patients and that's always the"
"worst kind of experience and that"
"applies to pretty much all chronic"
"diseases you know as you as you age and"
"as you survive cancer your kidney or"
"your liver or your pancreas"
"fails and there are very little things"
"we can very few things we can do for you"
"and so in my academic lab and in the"
"company i try to address that need by"
"coming up with solutions for diseases"
"such as end-stage renal disease or"
diabetes
"amazing thank you and then mike why"
"don't you share"
"yes hi um so i'm mike levin i am a"
"faculty member at tufts university i'm a"
"professor in the biology department um i"
"run the allen discovery center at tufts"
"and i'm also an associate faculty at the"
"uh visa institute at harvard and uh and"
"with david kaplan i'm a co-founder of a"
"company called morphaceuticals which uh"
"and our goal is to exploit"
"bioelectricity and other modalities for"
"or complex organ regeneration"
"my background was in computer science i"
"was fundamentally interested in"
how
"collective intelligence works and in"
"particular in biology the collective"
"intelligence of cells right so how cells"
"get together to form complex organs and"
"so on and um yeah this is what this is"
"what we do is try to understand how the"
"cells communicate electrically"
"chemically and so on to enable us then"
"to grow organs repair organs and so on"
"amazing thank you thank you and then"
"just kind of as a recap you know we talk"
"about regenerative medicine obviously"
"it's like it's the process of"
"engineering or regenerating human cells"
"human tissue organs in order to sort of"
"restore function and maybe just starting"
"um with you harold obviously"
"as a as a surgeon and somebody who's"
"practicing in this space"
"you are clearly motivated by the"
"shortage of organs and you know and sort"
"of that those tissues that you're seeing"
"can you say a little bit about how"
"sort of dire the situation is now and"
"and why this is maybe something we"
"haven't solved yet"
"yeah absolutely i mean the it's it's"
"fascinating uh how medicine has really"
"how much medicine has achieved and life"
"sciences have achieved in helping us"
surviving
"acute conditions right you you we manage"
"because of antibiotics we manage to"
"survive pneumonia or because of advanced"
"trauma care and seat belts that's not"
"just medicine obviously that's"
"engineering we're able to"
"decrease the mortality in the injuries"
"from from trauma"
"and and now that we understand better"
"what we have to do after trauma we get"
"patients through all these things and if"
"you look at look at medicine in the last"
"50 years the main focus has really been"
"on that um what that leads to in in a"
"good way is that more people live longer"
"and have more experiences and experience"
"more injury that they survive"
um
"what's what's fascinating about the"
"human body is its complexity but also"
"unfortunate and its ability to"
"adapt to other conditions but"
"unfortunately it's not very good at"
"repairing itself right as we as we and"
"that's what what's so fascinating about"
"this topic is that on the one hand we"
"build ourselves but then once we're"
"built we can't really fix ourselves and"
"in some ways it applies to a lot of"
"structures of daily life but a house"
"can't really fix itself or or whatever"
"any other machine or or object is really"
"not able to now come up with a repair"
"mechanism now and you'll hear more about"
"this today there is such a thing as as"
"repair tissue repair and whoever added a"
"sunburn in their life knows that you"
"know some of our tissues are actually"
"able to repair themselves and that's"
"largely because of cells because of stem"
cells
"within our tissues that are actually"
"able to to do some sort of repair"
"but to speak to the larger problem"
"in the developed world three out of four"
"people have a mixture of chronic"
"diseases three out of four adults have a"
"mixture of chronic diseases that affect"
"multiple systems"
"one in four living adults in the world"
"is suffering from multiple chronic"
conditions
"and so for all of us on this webinar you"
"know the chance that one of our single"
"systems fails is pretty much greater"
"than 50 or 75 percent"
"and once we hit that what will happen is"
"after a certain period of time our"
"quality of life will suffer our health"
"span would suffer"
"and there are really very little"
"curative options to help us through that"
"there is options to make us live with"
"the defects we acquire and with the"
"damages we acquire"
"but we don't have a lot of tools to to"
"restore lost organ function restore sort"
"of that biologic function that's where"
"regenerative medicine really comes in"
"you know ways to harness the biological"
"potential of our cells and our organs to"
"to restore the lost function"
"right right thank you thank you for that"
"you know eric you know one of the things"
"that that you've been working on for"
"quite some time and and is is obviously"
"some of the work that you're also doing"
"at my genesis is the idea of kind of"
"like co-opting"
"the lymph node right into"
"uh what you've called a a bioreactor"
"maybe you could say a little bit like"
"how did how did you how did you come up"
"with that and why"
"why is the lymph node such a good target"
"um for yeah"
"of work yeah thank you yeah so we we"
"really to a certain extent stumble uh"
"advances discovery uh we were working"
"with a mouse model of liver disease a"
"tower's anemic model it's a model where"
"the mouse will get a liver disease and"
"eventually die of cysts legal disease"
"and we were working with hepatocyte"
"transplantation which is the liver cells"
"that we would uh"
"transplant into the liver and at one"
"point um"
"i decided with a post doc to"
"not transplant the cells directly into"
"the liver"
"uh but try to transplant the cell in"
"other places and the rationale behind it"
"is because if you think about cell"
"transplantation like liver cell"
"transplantation in a patient with ant"
"stage liver disease is that the liver"
"the site is already somehow destroyed or"
"it's a not a good site for"
"transplantation and the question was"
"even if you have the right cell how"
"would you regenerate a liver in a size"
"where the liver is not is is dying to a"
"certain extent"
"and that's why we we use really the"
"mouse as a"
"a a a"
"an assay if you want or testing"
"different places"
"and uh she supposedly argued this"
"experiment it was actually a very"
"talented postdoc"
"md phd"
"did the the different type of"
"transplantation and then a completely"
"forgotten experiment until two months"
"later when i asked him what what"
"happened with the experiment we talked"
"about he said well i transplant all"
"these animals there is only one set of"
"animals that survive and that's the one"
"that got the cells into the peritoneal"
"cavity and i knew when she's animal"
"model there was really only two"
"possibility that the animal would"
"survive uh the genetic defect that he"
"had it was one of them would be that the"
"liver cell that he transplanted went"
"back to the liver and originated the"
"liver as the normal acid of his mouse is"
"or the the cell found another place and"
"it was a second option that that"
"happened is the cell found the lymph"
"node as a site for for for growing an"
"ectopic liver now when you think about"
"lymph node"
"this is not a random process okay"
"lymph node was designed by our immune"
"system a long time ago and it was"
"designed to nurture a certain type of"
"cells for the t cells which is a cell"
"that is very important for viral"
"infection because at that time i think"
"there was two things that was really"
"really important for the immune system"
"to deal with is bacterial infection and"
"viral infection"
and
"the these t cells is lymphocytes this"
"cell has an extremely it has to react"
"extremely fast to a viral infection as"
"we know because viral infection can"
"destroy i mean you think about kobe 19."
so
"what the the immune system design is a"
"lymph node and lymph node is really a"
"site for the t cells to actually grow"
"and expand and go back and do the job"
"and uh so the the lymph node is really a"
"bioreactor designed by the immune system"
"for t cells and t cell is probably the"
"fastest growing cell in your body when"
"activated probably divide every six or"
"eight hours so and and you and you think"
"about you know other things like for"
"example in cancer why it's a metastatic"
"process the cells eventually go to the"
"lymph node again the same process happen"
"you have a tumor cell you have a lot of"
"cells growing and eventually they found"
"the lymph node as being the site where"
"they can continue to grow and what we"
"design eventually is you take cells and"
"you transplant them directly normal"
"cells you transplant them directly into"
"the lymph node the lymph node the"
"environment really nurtures the sea"
"cells and in the case of liver disease"
"where you have the native liver"
"starting to die and want to regenerate"
"the growth factor any cues that cannot"
"really interact with the primary"
"parasite in the liver will interact with"
"the liver cell that are now in the lymph"
"node in the right hand environment and"
"then something extraordinary happen"
"because you"
"you create organogenesis and a"
"functional liver at the end of the"
"process amazing amazing so essentially"
"the the growth factors that the damaged"
"liver are cranking out are the ones that"
"then cause"
"those transplanted cells to kind of take"
"off and kind of do their"
"yeah to a certain extent the liver is"
"still the master it basically tells the"
"hepatocytes that are present ectopically"
"now you need to generate liver function"
"so basically you have to prefer you that"
"but at the end of the process it's not a"
"mass of cells just sitting there doing"
"the job it's actually an organ"
"vascularized and and the structure is"
"like like a liver and and that's what we"
"are now trying to do with the genesis in"
"the clinical trial that we're starting"
"very soon uh to do amazing amazing mike"
"so so you have been working uh primarily"
"on on limbs and limb regeneration but"
"you have a much bigger"
"i would say hypothesis about"
"um you know you've mentioned before like"
"the the intelligence of cells and and"
"potentially the innate intelligence of"
"cells can you share with us a little bit"
"how you're thinking about that because"
"there's been a lot of talk about"
"reprogramming cells and and and and"
"maybe just"
"you know talk talk to us about the type"
"of intelligence you're talking about"
sure
"one of the most interesting things about"
"uh cells is that when they get together"
"they know how to first of all they get"
"together and they build reliably they"
"build specific things so in embryonic"
"development they build all of the organs"
"in your body so throughout your lifespan"
"you know that those cells have the"
"information to build everything that"
"your body needs but the other amazing"
"thing about it is that uh they're able"
"to uh behave appropriately in very novel"
"circumstances so for example in um in in"
"axolotls right the mexican salamander"
"those those animals regenerate their"
"limbs their eyes their jaws their tails"
"including spinal cord portions of the"
"brain and heart throughout their"
"lifespan and so what they're telling us"
"and in fact there are other regenerative"
"animals like planaria that are immortal"
"it's okay so they've solved the aging"
"problem there's no such thing as an old"
"planarian because they're so highly"
"regenerative and so what these animals"
"are telling us is that it is possible to"
"be a complex animal where these cells"
"are willing to rebuild structures"
"throughout your lifespan okay even even"
"there's some in in mammals you know we"
"think of mammals as not being that"
"regenerative but for example deer every"
"year they shed their antlers they'll"
"regenerate bone up to a centimeter per"
"day of new bone okay and this on their"
"on their adler so"
"so what's what's remarkable about this"
"and where the intelligence comes in is"
"that let's say you have a salamander"
"limb and let's say the salamander loses"
"that limb somewhere along the you know"
"the the mediolateral axis what will"
"happen is the cells begin to immediately"
"grow uh they proliferate they migrate"
"they change uh they they undergo"
"morphogenesis and they regrow exactly"
"what's missing no more no less so no"
"matter where you got cut they will only"
"regenerate the piece that's missing and"
"the most amazing thing is that they stop"
"when they're done so now that requires"
"the whole collective to actually know"
"what you know when do they stop well"
"they stop when a correct salamander limb"
"has formed and in fact you can do really"
"crazy things like you can make um"
"uh you can make salamander cells that"
"are very large so way larger than normal"
"cells and when they build an embryo they"
"will use fewer of those cells to build"
"exactly the correct size newt and in"
"fact sometimes even one cell you know"
"will wrap around itself to make a kidney"
"tubule instead of the normal 10 that it"
"takes to do that so this is when i say"
"intelligence this is what i mean it's"
"the it's the ability of the collective"
"to undergo novel behaviors that they"
"normally don't do right it's not just a"
"matter of we we are hardwired we do the"
"exact same thing every single time and"
"then that's it no it's actually it's"
"extremely plastic and i and our goal is"
"is to first of all understand"
"this plasticity right we need to"
"understand how cellular collectives make"
"decisions how do they decide what to"
"build when to stop"
"and you know"
"understanding the hardware of the"
"situation meaning the molecular biology"
"and the and the proteins that are in"
"every cell that's only the start of the"
"story right that's that's what the"
"hardware is but we know that this"
"hardware is able to um do some really uh"
"incredible problem solving in the"
"anatomical space and physiological space"
"and so our goal now is to uh really"
"understand that software of life is to"
"understand how the decisions are made"
"and then to discover interventions yeah"
"and we and we've been doing this in the"
"space of bioelectric um"
"uh cell communication is how do you how"
"do you nudge that collective to build"
"whatever it is that you want them to"
"build a healthy organ and vivo in vitro"
"um you know whatever you want"
i'm
i'm
"impressed with where you all are going"
"some very"
"exciting fields just just kind of taking"
"back because you guys were all talking"
"about some pretty acute situations how"
"does this also play into"
"like lifespan human lifespan and the"
"health span also at the end of human"
"life and can you expound upon a little"
"bit of you know once we've moved past"
"acute care where does does this take us"
"over the long term"
"i'll let anybody jump in"
"maybe i'll jump to that brian that's a"
"great question i think"
"in many ways right as we as we i mean we"
"heard some really important terms here"
"like morphogenesis and regeneration and"
"bioreactors these are these are"
"basically components of a tissue repair"
"and an assembly process and as we as we"
"get better in understanding this process"
"and actively manage it"
"i think this will become part of of"
"medical practice"
"you know in the sense that we already um"
"we we can already support somebody who's"
"lacking um a certain hormone or or a"
"certain enzyme look at diabetes right we"
"figured out yeah it's a lack of insulin"
"type one diabetes"
"and we can supply that and as a"
"physician when i hear eric and mike"
"talking there i'm really dreaming uh of"
"of a day when we can we can inject"
"somebody with with the correct set of"
"stimulants or the correct set of signals"
"to guide um to guide regeneration of"
"functional tissue to to achieve that"
"directed morphogenesis that's actually a"
"term i i like to use in some ways"
"because in the stem cell biology"
"if you look at the last decade we've"
"gotten pretty pretty good or many groups"
"have have achieved what's called"
"directed differentiation so we can take"
"a stem cell we turn it you know back"
"into a blank slate basically back into"
"an embryonic like stem cell from a"
"patient and then we can drive that cell"
"towards becoming a liver cell"
"or a kidney cell or pancreas cell"
"um now that that works in some instances"
"in the from a therapeutic perspective as"
"in car t therapy for example or recently"
"very exciting you know the"
"transplantation of insulin producing"
"cells in diabetic patients but as you"
"need higher complexity"
"we need to understand or not only"
"directed differentiation but also"
"directed morphogenesis right so so how"
"can we how can we rebuild structure and"
"you know thinking from from a"
"translational perspective so what that"
"means is thinking of medical"
"interventions and products that we can"
"offer to our patients"
"i really think there's going to be a"
"spectrum where in one instance you might"
"be able to guide"
"in inside to regenerational repair or"
"functional tissue and in some instances"
"you might provide cells and in some"
"instances you might have to go as far as"
"taking taking an approach where you"
"build a whole liver or kidney outside of"
"the body and then transplant it similar"
"to a donor organ"
"yeah and to your question how does that"
"fit into the bigger picture of health"
"span um you know there's nothing more"
"saddening than a patient walking in and"
"you cure lung cancer and then they die"
"from renal failure right"
"within a short period of time so so"
"there are so many patients where this is"
"not an end of life phenomenon but it's"
"actually right smack in the middle you"
"know and and and that's i think the key"
"target here is to help us all"
"have that full health span"
"yeah yeah um really you know this this"
"this uh point about um uh uh the"
"interventions for morphogenesis is"
"really really uh very very critical if"
"you look at uh where um computer science"
was
"at its beginning you know what what did"
"programming look like in the 40s and 50s"
"you know you can see this right right"
"you can see this picture you know she i"
"show this in every talk i give she's"
"sitting in front of this giant thing and"
"she's literally moving wires in and"
"around right because because in those"
"days uh you had to in order to program"
"you had to interact at the level of"
"hardware right and what happened was and"
"the reason that we have this incredible"
"information technology revolution is"
"that people figured out that if your"
"hardware is good enough and the"
"biological hardware is definitely good"
"enough then what you can do is something"
"much easier than try to program you know"
"when you when you um on your laptop when"
"you try to switch from from microsoft"
"word to photoshop you don't get out your"
"soldering iron and start rewiring right"
"why don't you do that because because"
"you've got a system with which it's rich"
"it has all kinds of innate modules all"
"kinds of innate behaviors that you can"
"trigger it with experiences with stimuli"
"and so our goal is to uh now i think"
"to really understand the kind of uh"
"capabilities that are that are going to"
"allow us to communicate with the cell"
"collectives okay not not micromanage it"
"at the level of hardware you know all"
"the most exciting things in in molecular"
"medicine tend to be you know single"
"molecule approaches and and and crispr"
"and genomic editing like this is all"
"down at the hardware level and we need"
"to complement this with an understanding"
"of what are the cellular collectives"
"able to do what do they measure what are"
"their memories what do they know how to"
"build and how do we trigger those and i"
"think it's exactly as harold just said"
"it's going to be exactly that it's going"
"to be"
"providing the the minimal intervention"
"that you need to get the body to do what"
"it already knows how to do it's not"
"going to we're not going to solve"
"everything from the bottom up by by you"
"know micro micromanaging this process"
"how much does it play into"
"like um preventative medicine and early"
"diagnosis this whole kind of field and"
"thinking about early adoption and all"
that
"yeah brian i i think that's that's a"
"that's another really cool question"
"because at some point a lot of damage is"
"when repair goes wrong right like and if"
"you go back to the sunburn example i"
"used you know if you're if your sunburn"
"is just a little bit too deep let's say"
"it's not a sunburn but it's an iron or"
"or in a pan"
"and it goes beyond the level of repair"
"potential um repair goes wrong and you"
"do what's called scarring right and and"
"scarring frequently um means loss of"
"function and that applies to so many"
"organs if you look at interstitial lung"
"disease or in smokers or you look at"
"you know cirrhosis basically or kidney"
"fibrosis these are all examples where"
"the body is trying to fix some some"
"injury trying to repair itself but the"
"process doesn't quite work out"
"and so so i think what the knowledge we"
"gain here and and that understanding"
"that collective intelligence like mike"
"had said um will apply to these to these"
"early stages just as much where we"
"hopefully will be able to actually"
"intervene and prevent that from"
"happening i mean in some ways that's"
"what you already do like in burn care"
"you know if you stick with the skin"
"example you try to really"
"use aloe gel for example or even surface"
"surface modification to enable a more"
"constructive repair process and you can"
"take that to the next level ultimately"
"yeah eric i think"
"yeah we can also say you know for"
"example uh organ failure is really a"
"dramatic event for patients uh and as we"
"age there is more and more uh issue with"
"the organ failure and and there is some"
"solution in in some cases which would be"
"organ transplant but now"
"i think what we can we can say there is"
"a panel of different approaches that"
"could help uh uh this lack of"
"originating potential that you see"
"through aging but also through injuries"
"and other things"
that
"some of these possibilities that that"
"are more and more real where you can"
"activate regeneration or provide"
"regeneration that might be still there"
"in the body uh through an environment uh"
"that would that would help and and and"
"provide that provide the protection and"
"and the potential growth of the cells or"
"tissue and and really to what function"
"because the fact of the matter what"
"happened at one point another you you"
"lack function that are essential for for"
life
"yeah and eric just to just to uh uh"
"carry on with that um"
"i know when when we had talked you had"
"you had mentioned obviously the liver is"
"is one of the first things that you're"
"you're looking at but there are also"
other
"tissues that you think can be"
"um i mean injected into the lymph nodes"
"to create uh you know other organs and"
"we talked about the thymus which is kind"
"of like this mysterious you know sort of"
"sort of organ which is also you know"
"potentially has some relationship to to"
"to aging can you say a little bit about"
"the different cell types that you have"
"looked at and maybe just a couple of"
"words about the thymus in particular"
"yeah so we if we talk with the thymus"
"what is interesting is that the the"
"lymph node is a is a lymphoid organ and"
"the thymus produce cells that go in the"
"lymphatic system so they're basically"
"sort of cousin or close cousin and when"
"when we put the thymus into a lymph node"
"it seems to be really the the right"
"environment because you basically plug a"
"cell an organ that produce t cells in"
"the highways where the t cell would go"
"which is the lymphatic system"
"and and so we have demonstrated one is"
"that it works really well and that if"
"you take"
"we have dances in small animals you take"
"a small animal that does not have a"
"thymus and and you"
"you you put a thymus into a lymph node"
"we provide very very fast"
"functional t cells and and basically"
"immune cells that are lacking because"
"there is no thymus present what we have"
"also done as a study and it's ongoing"
"study so we don't know everything about"
"it yet"
"but what we know is that if you take a a"
"young thymus and you put it in an old"
environment
"it seems to be that is also helping uh"
"uh the animal at different levels the"
"first things uh what happened with the"
"with the thymus little bit complex but"
"the the cell that get in the thymus and"
"and produce these so-called t cells that"
"are very important for immune function"
"they seem to um rejuvenate by going"
"through a young thymus indicating that"
"there are some kind of"
"reprogramming or something is happening"
"because the thymus is basically like a"
"big box where cells get in and they get"
"out and when they get out the functional"
"t cells and so there is a process there"
"that is actually quite interesting the"
"other thing what is interesting is that"
the
"the cells uh t cells for example orbit"
"hematopoies are blood cells they go"
"everywhere in the body and they're very"
"important for other organ and other"
"functions and people have shown actually"
"that if you take young cells young"
"immune cells and put them in the body of"
"an old body you actually see some"
"rejuvenation not only the immune system"
"but actually the tissue and the org"
"indicating that this is a very"
"interesting uh uh approach"
"not especially directly into putting a"
"new simon's in a young thymus in an old"
"patient this will be probably very"
"complex but at least understanding what"
"exactly happened here and and why is it"
"that you can rejuvenate cells"
"a certain way which is"
"has not been described so far so"
"that is very interesting with the times"
"now for the other tissue i mean we try"
"many many different tissues and you know"
"that actually basically everything seems"
"to work in the liquid to a certain"
"extent and i think again because as i"
"said previously this is a mini"
"bioreactor very well vascularized and so"
"you can think about a lot of different"
"tissue you could you would put there or"
"cells if you put there that would be"
"nurtured by your body and and and"
"produce a lot of function that would be"
"necessary so pancreatic eyelids we did"
"that and and we showed also the"
"pancreatic eyelid has been transplanted"
"basically everywhere in the body except"
"the lymph node and we show that lymph"
"node is actually also"
"awesome sites because the"
"vascularization is very important for"
"eyelid cells to survive and so when we"
"we try kidney also but it's a little bit"
"more complicated and we try even brain"
"tissue i mean you you could actually"
"develop brain tissue in the lymph node"
"and and brain was actually the the best"
"model to to to create organogenesis in"
"the lymph node the only of of course uh"
uh
"sort of problem is try to figure out for"
"for what we would do a a a brain into"
"the lymph nodes but yeah yeah yeah that"
"makes that makes that makes sense but i"
"we have a couple questions sort of that"
"cut that are coming in but i did want to"
"ask one question mike to you obviously"
"again um you know in terms of body"
"patterning and and limb regeneration but"
"it also seems like the you know the"
"innate intelligence of the cells is is"
"at the same thing"
"reflected in the same way with with"
"organs right and and some of the other"
"sort of less external more internal"
"things is that have you looked at that"
"is that which have have you seen"
"anything there or are you sort of"
"getting to that next yeah no no we have"
"um and and i think you know in fact in"
"fact uh we're working on a on a theory"
"of this field that is based on uh cells"
"uh collectives of cells solving problems"
"in various spaces now this is anatomical"
"space right and figuring out what what"
"structures need to be there they also"
"solve problems in physiological space"
"and we have examples like this where um"
"for example you can take um"
"we showed that you can take a you can"
"take a flat worms you can put them in a"
"solution of barium right and barium is"
"this non-specific potassium channel"
"blocker it prevents the cells from"
"exchanging potassium which is a major"
"problem their heads explode right"
"literally their heads explode"
"but if you leave them in the barium"
"within about a week they regrow new"
"heads that are completely barium"
"adaptive no problem at all right now we"
"asked the simple question what is"
"different about these new heads versus"
"versus original heads um and what we"
"found is that uh basically there's only"
"about half a dozen genes that are"
"differentially regulated in order to"
"allow this to happen now what's critical"
"about this is that barium is not"
"something that planaria ever see in the"
"wild so this is not anything that you"
"could have had an evolutionary sort of"
"preparation for this is you know barium"
"poisoning this is what i do what these"
"cells have done think about this they"
"have you know how many tens of thousands"
"of genes in this incredibly high"
"dimensional space of all the possible"
"gene expression patterns you can have"
"how do you know which half a dozen genes"
"are going to solve your physiological"
"problem right it's really it's it's it's"
"if we had if we had um some sort of um"
"robotics that could do this this would"
"be you know this would be prize-winning"
"ai that could take a novel solution and"
"a novel problem and find a solution in"
"this massively high dimensional space so"
"um we have to understand you know we"
"know we know all about how transcription"
"works all these things we have to"
"understand how the decisions are made"
"right how do they solve these problems"
"and i'm i'm convinced that this is all"
"over the place in in biology and"
"medicine where"
"we're just not we're not clever yet at"
"uh detecting intelligent behavior in"
"other spaces other than"
"three-dimensional space because that's"
"what we look at all day long all of our"
"tissues and organs are solving these"
"problems transcriptional problems"
"physiological problems metabolic"
"problems they're solving this with with"
"uh with novelty right not just the same"
"thing over and over again and if we were"
"if we were better at it um you know and"
"we actually are thinking of"
"a machine learning tools that will help"
"us recognize these things and then the"
"next step is of course to develop"
"interventions based on that"
"amazing awesome i love some machine"
learning
"and just kind of on the same thread"
"because if you're pulling on some of my"
"manufacturing background with me to talk"
"now and we have a question here that"
"asks about um vascular organs and 3d"
"printing and bioprinting and"
"the question is how far are we along in"
"that path and whether we'll be able to"
"build them in body or whether they'll"
"have to be"
"in vitro"
"solutions i don't know if that's the"
"first one you want to jump on mike if"
"anybody else wants to"
"field an answer for that one"
"yeah the only thing i can say about that"
"i mean i'm that's not my expertise the"
"only thing i will say is that i'm sure"
"for some things that will be the right"
"approach but there's going to be a very"
"wide class of problems in medicine where"
"we don't have the information and we"
"don't have the capability of"
"manipulating it at the lowest level"
"right if you're going to try to 3d print"
"something like a you know a human arm or"
"an eye or something like this"
"think about all the things you have to"
"know you have to know where all the"
"different cell types go and you have to"
"this is the sort of thing that by itself"
"stem cell biology does not solve because"
"how do you get all the other you know"
"you can have a teratoma where you have"
"these mature tissues and just not in the"
"right organ you know organization you're"
"much better off uh trying to activate"
"this at a higher level of control where"
"you can see you can you can kickstart a"
"module a patterning module with a simple"
"signal that says you know build a leg"
"here or build it this is what we've done"
"in the frog model for example we've"
"induced leg regeneration we've made eyes"
"we've fixed birth defects all be not not"
"because we know how to build legs and"
"eyes but because we found these"
"subroutines in the body that we can"
"trigger with relatively simple signals"
"that then kick-start the whole process"
"that then we don't micromanage so like"
"in the frog for example"
"24-hour stimulation with this bioreactor"
"in our in our cocktail and then you get"
"a year and a half of leg growth and"
"during that whole time we never touch it"
"we never touch it we don't have any idea"
"how to you know how to micro assemble a"
"frog leg and you don't need to because"
"those decisions scarring versus build"
"the leg that that happens in the first"
"hours following amputation and if you"
"can you know tweak it at that point then"
"then you can sort of leave it alone that"
"that's you know"
interesting
"harold how about how about with you"
"thinking about the work that you've been"
"doing in terms of you know um not"
"necessarily trying to 3d print the whole"
"tissue itself but trying to embed"
"functional cells within some some sort"
"of 3d matrix do you do you have an"
"opinion about 3d printed versus"
"something in between and extra corporeal"
"versus something that gets implanted"
"now yeah so so the"
"the way i think of it is very similar to"
"what what mike and eric have mentioned"
"uh that that you have to whatever you do"
"or whatever therapy we develop i think"
"we have to to harness this i love that"
"term subroutines you know it's when"
"whenever you try to accomplish something"
"that's not aligned with biology"
"we're ourselves as such smart machines"
"i i don't think it will work and and one"
"of those uh"
"one of those examples is really i think"
"in some ways cell therapy where it"
"didn't work where you just provide a lot"
"of building blocks but you might not"
"have harnessed that subroutine you might"
"have put them in the wrong environment"
"um you know as as eric had said in the"
"liver or in the heart and the fibros"
"infarcted heart and then nothing"
"happened and the cells weren't really"
"able to execute the program"
"so i think"
"whatever manufacturing approach we take"
"we have to provide the three-dimensional"
"environment to to trigger that and the"
"signals to trigger that subprogram to to"
"get that process and the morphogenesis"
"and not the scarring process started and"
"so so 3d printing i think is is one way"
"to get cells into into a"
three-dimensional
"network into a profused network because"
as
as
"as we're big beings in some ways there's"
"a certain critical mass that has to be"
"hit in order for it to make a dent or a"
"therapeutic difference"
"but there's other manufacturing"
"techniques so so in our case for example"
"we tried to leverage a multitude of"
"manufacturing techniques to create that"
"three-dimensional scaffolding"
"and then the put the cells into that"
"three-dimensional context and turn on"
"the program for for morphogenesis or"
"tissue tissue generation so so there's"
"probably going to be a spectrum of"
"technologies that are required um as"
"long as and they will work as long as"
"they are aligned with a biologic program"
"yeah that makes yeah i know what i would"
"call it is the sort of the needle"
function
"you need to have the needle function at"
"one point or another because uh you know"
"our body will not maintain something"
"that is not needed"
"um and and and would eventually except"
"maybe with with a frog"
"you can put an eye where where it should"
"be but you might have hijacked some some"
"of the program"
"uh of genetics that i and then that's"
"that's different but let's say if you"
"want to have i actually with the liver"
"which sometimes when mike talks i"
"already think about the liver and some"
"of the stuff he said you can really see"
"the liver doing it like regeneration and"
"so on even even in you know in in adult"
"uh people you have regeneration of the"
liver
"but uh this is process there yeah need"
"of uh needle function is is i think"
"essential uh to maintain the and and"
then
"again location where you would want to"
"do that uh how you want to ask your eyes"
"of course whatever you want to"
regenerate
"in this patient is very important"
"yeah and there was there was a"
"clarifying question eric around around"
"the lymph node and i think this is an"
"important point because i remember"
asking
"uh you know early on when we were"
"thinking about this so so when you put"
"the tissues into the cells into the"
"lymph node the organ regenerates in that"
"lymph node and it stays put right you"
"don't you don't extract it and and put"
"it someplace else in the body you let it"
"no stay functional right no okay and"
"then yeah and i was just gonna say and"
"then maybe you could say a little bit"
"about what lymph like obviously we have"
"a pretty extensive lymphatic system"
"throughout our bodies are you targeting"
"specific lymph nodes that are near or"
"next to the organs that they might have"
"been next to or or does it matter"
"yeah so there we have around 600 uh"
"lymph nodes in our body so there are"
"plenty of"
"us obviously"
"anywhere you know a spot and and for"
"example in the clinical trial that blood"
"genesis will do uh they use basic"
"basically mesenteric hypnos using uh an"
"endoscopic ultrasound method which is"
"this method normally that a patient"
"will will get if"
"the the u.s or endoscopy ultrasound when"
"there is a potential of"
"lymph node with"
"tumors so they can do biopsies into"
"patient and it's a outpatient procedure"
"it's actually a pretty pretty uh benign"
"procedure for for a patient and so we'll"
"use that"
"approach to actually"
"put cells in because it's the same"
"process but instead of"
"taking a piece of tissue you just inject"
"and you put more cells into the lymph"
"node so"
"lymph node there are many different"
"lymph nodes and many different potential"
"how to transplant cells into the lymph"
"node and there are even technology like"
"us endoscopy ultrasound that already"
"there ready to be used for for for this"
approach
"that's cool and then one one more"
"question because this is just so"
"interesting is that is that what let's"
"say it generates a liver i mean it stops"
"at some point right like it gets big"
"enough for function but then once the"
"function is restored it stops growing"
"yeah so that's a little bit what mike"
"was was talking about about about the"
"different tissue and the legs and how it"
"stopped at one point with the liver it's"
"the same thing first you know the liver"
"if you remove two thirds of the liver"
"let's say of a mouse"
"uh five days later the liver grow back i"
"mean by compensatory growth the mass of"
"the liver is again back back there now"
"if we create another levels what we we"
"did with the with the lymph node now you"
"have two levers okay and his liver as i"
"said the ectopic liver is driven by the"
"need of function and the fact that the"
"native liver the liver that we have"
"normally is not working properly so it"
"would grow to a certain size but then"
"when it's when you reach the the"
"function level it stop growing"
"and actually what we have even shown is"
"that if you if you"
"if some cell migrate back into the"
"native liver or if you transplant it"
"into the native liver and make the"
"native liver works again"
"then the ectopic liver shrink and"
disappear
"and it's normal because you know why"
"would you maintain two liver in your"
"body if you don't need it again the the"
"concept i was talking about the need of"
"function you you don't have your liver"
"mass my liver mass immune mass of a"
"herald is basically"
"is metabolic function okay and you you"
"don't need to have a second liver except"
"if you if your main lever is not working"
"that's so cool"
"that's right brian i think you had a"
"question that you had that you had"
"queued up"
um
"there was a question that kind of took"
"it in a slightly different direction"
"aimed it for mike"
"how do you see the yama i'm going to"
"butcher this yamaha knockout factors"
"impact on epigenetic age reversal versus"
"the bioelectric communication activating"
"the ion channels in the context of"
"hardware versus software so we're kind"
"of going back in a different direction"
"but it'd be good to get that answered"
"yeah i think that uh direct"
"reprogramming of cells via yamanaka"
"factors or other kinds of factors are"
"that's going to be a good way to go when"
"you have a specific"
"you know maybe a single cell type"
"disease or something something that's"
"that's that's fairly um structurally"
"fairly simple right that might be the"
"way to go but overall i think that uh"
"managing managing complex organs and"
"structures is going to be really hard"
"that way and one of the problems is when"
"you when you address things at that sort"
"of lowest level of organization right"
"right you're you're literally"
"micromanaging the the cell types you"
know
"then then it's on you to take care of"
"everything and and it's a and there are"
"a lot of things to take care of and this"
"is why i i you know when you do this"
"right like much like with various drugs"
"that basically interfere right at the"
"end the symptom you're trying to solve"
"you end up with all kinds of side"
"effects things you never you know you"
"never you never intended and um"
"it's like uh in in in our systems for"
"example in the planaria we can induce"
"ectopic heads like extra heads when you"
"do that genetically you might get ahead"
"but there are but they don't start out"
"the right size because because you"
"didn't take care of the size all you did"
"was tell them what to make ahead but now"
"the size is wrong whereas what you can"
"do if you go upstream and you say okay"
"what is the what is the signal that the"
"animal itself uses to say i need a head"
"in this in this you know in this"
"location and that in in many examples"
"tends to be a bioelectrical state right"
"these bioelectrical pattern memories"
"that tissues use to figure out what"
"should go where once you trigger that"
"everything downstream is taken care of"
"because you don't need to you don't need"
"it's not on you it's on the animal now"
"you've you've pushed all that complexity"
"back onto the system they already know"
"how to make the the you know the"
"identity of the organ in the head the"
"size of the head everything else is"
"handled for you so uh"
"if we want to have these complex organ"
"outcomes without tumerogenic risk and"
"without the wrong things being in the"
"wrong place you want to go as high up"
"the chain as you can which me which"
"which for us we you know we've had the"
"most luck with with bioelectric"
interventions
"yeah that's interesting i guess we"
"should stop calling it tissue"
"engineering then we should call it"
"tissue programming"
"i'd be intrigued to follow up a little"
"bit on what harold said about the"
"structures interplaying with what you're"
"talking about those"
"advanced subroutines and what kind of"
"adaptions we have to make to the the"
"hardware the structures to actually"
"ensure that those seven routines are"
"working correctly am i asking the right"
"question the right way i hope so"
"yeah yeah no it's it's definitely a good"
"question because there will be"
"situations you know if you're missing an"
"enzyme or if you're fundamentally"
"missing something important uh"
"bioelectrics is not going to help with"
"that you need to have the the material"
"there but if but but but in many cases"
"you can you can get the tissue and the"
"organs to do new things right and that"
"that in that informational um you know"
"that informational structure is is is"
"often handled by electrically and and i"
"i love what eric was talking about the"
"the coordination and the need to"
"function because that's the sort of"
"thing you know in uh in in a in a frog"
"right uh if it loses one limb let's say"
"at the knee or something like this"
"there's a set of bioelectrical signals"
"that you can see at the wound site the"
"opposite leg that was never touched"
"there's nothing wrong with it no no"
"nobody ever touched it lights up in"
"exactly the same location within 30"
"within 30 seconds you can you the other"
"leg knows what happened to the to the"
"other leg this is this this kind of"
"information is present throughout the"
body
"and and we've seen in in cases of um in"
"the repair of birth defects and also in"
"cancers we have lots of information on"
"on on how this kind of um collective uh"
"gold directed behave morphogenesis goes"
"wrong in cancer"
"whether or not you get a tumor at one"
"side of the body that was injected with"
"an oncogene is partly determined by what"
"the electrical state is over the on the"
"other side right these are not local"
"events these are these are um and of"
"course you know bioelectricity is a"
"great way to integrate information"
"across across distance but but these"
"things these things are not purely local"
"and i think"
"more and more we're going to realize"
"that for these regenerative events you"
"don't just look at the wound it's not"
"just the cells of the wound it's the"
"cells in the rest of the body it's the"
"nervous system it's tissues that are"
"that we never normally don't even think"
"about that are all in communication and"
"taking part in making these decisions"
"that's pretty cool but there's a"
"question around"
"the convergence of biology and and sort"
"of mechanical engineering to create"
"hybrid solutions so let's imagine"
that
"that is is there a way to use sort of"
"the intelligence of tissues and and"
potentially
"um i don't know other other entities or"
"other structures is it possible if yeah"
"i mean could you have a"
"synthetic you know lymph node and then"
"and then do some of the things that"
"you're trying to do with the bioreactor"
"here or is it yeah open question on the"
"on the fusion of these hybrid pieces"
yeah
"yeah i like for me i don't know okay"
"uh i i don't know it would be it would"
"be probably interesting to create a"
"synthetic uh"
"lymph node for many different reasons"
"not only for"
"organ development but also for the"
"immune system it would it would be very"
"cool but i i'm not an expert there i can"
help
"one of the one of the really exciting"
"areas that i think is going to impact on"
"biomedicine is um"
"synthetic morphology so this is this"
"this idea that not just synthetic"
"biology of uh you know metabolic and"
"other circuits in single cells but"
"actually building novel um"
"living constructs that never existed"
"before and and part of the the beauty of"
"the intelligence of biology is that the"
"cells are highly interoperable so so"
"people have made brains that drive"
"robotic hearts right so their body is a"
"robot that now you know or if they play"
"pong or they you know they do these"
"various things because because cells"
"will enter into as as eric was showing"
"these these beautiful basically chimeras"
"right where you have cells in the wrong"
"location doing their job getting along"
"with their neighbors um cells will will"
"cooperate with with electrodes with all"
"kinds of nano materials with you know"
"they can be instrumentized so you can"
"readily see you know we're going to have"
"we already have to some extent but we'll"
"have more people that are basically"
"cyborgs right that have some combination"
"of biology uh bioengineering and um"
"engineered constructs that might be"
"might be um"
"prosthetic limbs you know people are"
"driving wheelchairs with their mind and"
"things like this right nowadays so"
"there's going to be more and more of"
"this this clean line between the biology"
"and the engineering is just"
"going to be wiped away there's too many"
"great applications at the at the"
"intersection yeah i love that that's"
great
"yeah so so maybe just one one more kind"
"of very practical question and then i'll"
"ask a little bit more open-ended"
"question what are some of the"
"the sort of i mean this is very exciting"
"i think anybody who's listening to the"
"webinar right now i will feel optimistic"
"which i do um what are some of the"
"regulatory implications is this i mean"
"is everybody thinking this way or that"
"you know does the fda kind of think this"
"way or is this going to be"
"kind of like a more of a big education"
uh
"you know uh"
"sort of front first and then working on"
"the regulatory from there what's the"
"reaction been like"
"well maybe i'll tackle that one i think"
"the reaction is very positive right i"
mean
"if you just think of the last question"
"actually there there in many ways you"
"know pacemakers and and aortic valve"
"replacement and uh and many many"
"therapies that we currently use already"
"taking biology into account or more and"
"more into account understand better how"
"materials interact"
"and just as mike had said you know so"
"many people are was the definition of a"
"cyborg right there there's many many"
"treatments if you walk around with a"
"stent in your heart or in your carotid"
"artery or somewhere"
"you you could be considered a cyborg"
"maybe to a certain extent a much more"
"intelligent device is being used so so"
"one i think there is a regulatory path"
"for medical devices and as we as we"
"start to incorporate more and more"
"biology into this uh you know to"
"concrete applications"
"i think there's going to be a regulatory"
"path to allow for that you know it's at"
"the very beginning you know"
"t-cell therapies for example are sort of"
"the first few"
"engineered blood vessels are going to be"
"next if you look at"
"changes in regulatory pathways there's"
"such a thing called as rmat which is a"
"regenerative medicine"
"application pathway by the fda"
"or breakthrough devices um they're"
"basically new paths even on the"
"regulatory side where"
"people have recognized the need to to"
"venture into new areas"
"and and leverage biology for medical"
"devices so i think you know in medicine"
"there's sort of this one on overarching"
"rule which is first do no harm right as"
"long as we can show"
"that devices are safe and of course then"
"show that we improve patients lives with"
"them there will be motivation both on"
"the on the patient side"
"on the patient's side on the regulatory"
side
"on the payer side and and on the science"
"side to to drive these therapies forward"
"um so i'm quite optimistic about that"
"and especially hearing you guys talk"
"about it"
"i'm also but i think it will be a little"
"step by little step because it's very"
"expensive or very complex so you cannot"
"bring to the idea of a highly complex"
process
"or you you will be in trouble because uh"
"that would be so costly that it would be"
"difficult so i see this as a sort of"
"step-by-step process to add on"
"different technology"
"yeah i've one more question before i ask"
"my big my broad question um there was uh"
"you know a question around exosome"
"therapy and playing a role in in limb"
"regeneration and mike i'm not sure if"
"you have a an opinion on that um but if"
"you do it'd be great if you could share"
it
"no sorry i don't yeah we that's not"
"something we've explored"
"okay okay great awesome well then i will"
"i will sort of open it up again um to"
"obviously the first of all the"
"discussion's been incredible as always"
"i'm super excited about this space and"
"feeling really really hopeful um i think"
"even based on what you've heard each"
"other share today as well as your sort"
"of knowledge of the overarching field"
"where you know maybe share a little bit"
"about where each of you thinks the"
"future of regenerative medicine is"
"headed and and even if you care to share"
"maybe even something that you find"
"exciting whether it's not the exact"
"stuff that you're working on could be"
"something else but a little bit about"
"the future and a little bit about what's"
"exciting you right now if you don't mind"
"open questions"
"everybody's thinking"
"there's a lot to be excited about"
"well i guess i guess uh what what i'm"
"really excited about is a two-pronged"
"approach where we simultaneously do very"
"basic science and this is this is cell"
"biology this is neuroscience and this is"
"computer science of figuring out how to"
"communicate with cellular collectives"
"not how to not not how to force um end"
"end goals but how to communicate"
"large-scale uh"
"anatomical pattern memories for the"
"cells to to fill out right so this is a"
"basic science program and to merge that"
"with the engineering needed to deliver"
"these interventions so we're talking"
"about bioreactors whether they're in"
"vivo bioreactors whether they're"
"engineered bioreactors um you know"
"there's whether they're you know"
"optogenetic technology whether it's"
"exosomes whatever there's going to be"
"lots of really exciting technologies to"
"uh to deliver the right signals and then"
"the key is knowing what those signals"
"are and that that i think is going to"
"really like that basis just imagine you"
know
"pretty much everything except for"
"infectious disease right so so birth"
"defects traumatic injury aging"
"degenerative disease all of that stuff"
"would be solved if we knew how to"
"convince cells to build what we wanted"
"them to build right everything hangs on"
"this one on this one question so that"
"that to me that that discovery is is you"
"know the most exciting thing"
amazing
"eric or harold uh well i'm i'm from the"
for
"the little little uh uh"
"really uh feasible step and i think"
"probably in aging and transplantation"
"and cell transplantation we might be"
"able to improve aging in patients"
"one way or the other maybe so cells"
"maybe so other other other factors but"
"improving aging i think it's a is a"
"feasible approach when you think about"
"it with all the different technology"
"that are out there and the the different"
"discovery i do believe that uh we will"
"uh very soon have some formula uh so to"
speak
"which will allow it would not be like"
"we'll have 200 years old which tastes"
"for 200 years but it would it would"
"definitely improve"
"our day-to-day life"
"i think those are good points"
"what i find or what gives me a lot of"
"reason for optimism is really to also"
"see how much basic science is now"
"quicker and quicker feeding into"
"formation of new therapies you know i"
"think traditionally you know you when"
"needed to become a surgeon or to or to"
"work in the on the bench side right and"
"those two fields wouldn't really"
"blend as much as they are now where"
"where the speed of and the iterative"
"power and the computational power"
"uh and the understanding of biology are"
"so much more integrated in our daily"
"practice that that i think the"
"our ability to implement some of these"
"or apply some of these discoveries to"
"clinical world and helping people"
"will will increase over time that's"
"that's what i find exciting about this"
"field that the degenerative medicine"
"applies as just as mike had said to to"
"so many human conditions to the human"
"condition basically in some ways right"
"and and and as we go forward we'll see"
"these things come to clinical"
"application which is what we need so"
"yeah no that's i mean that definitely"
"reflects like why"
"we've become and i've become so excited"
"on this topic as we you know sort of"
"turned our attention here"
"uh in in the new year and i know um you"
"know both thinking from um"
"you know in terms of human health uh"
"health span"
"uh diseases of aging"
"um you know"
"the the body's innate ability to go"
"after uh some of the insults and other"
"things that are that are facing it i"
"think is is really sort of sort of"
"critical so thank you so much for"
"sharing your thoughts and insights with"
"us today we are really grateful for the"
"opportunity to bring you together and"
"as always after one of our webinars we"
"do i'll do a blog post recap of some of"
"the insights that we talked about there"
"will be a replay"
"of the webinar that everyone can access"
"and and share and certainly um you know"
"feel free to reach out to brian or"
"myself with you know additional"
"questions after the webinar if that's of"
"interest to folks and we'll help field"
"those uh with the folks that we've had"
"online but really grateful thank you"
"again mike harold and eric for your time"
"today thanks brian for hosting this with"
"us and yeah just everybody be well stay"
"safe and and think about your innate"
"capability and the intelligence of your"
"tissues as you so thank you"
"thank you so much"
"thanks brian thank you so much"
"okay bye-bye"
