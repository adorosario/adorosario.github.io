"welcome to another episode of progress"
"potential and possibilities discussions"
with
"fascinating people designing a better"
"tomorrow for all of us"
"i'm your host ira pastor"
"welcome everybody again to another"
"episode of our show with another truly"
"fascinating guest who is helping to"
create
"a better tomorrow for all of us uh today"
"we have the honor of being joined by dr"
"michael levin a tufts university"
"professor he holds the van of our bush"
"endowed chair and biology department"
"uh he serves as both the director of the"
"tufts center for regenerative and"
"developmental biology and director"
"of the allen discovery center at tufts"
"uh dr levin's group's focus is on"
"understanding biophysical mechanisms"
"that implement decision making"
"during things like complex pattern"
"regulation and harnessing endogenous"
"bioelectric dynamics towards rational"
control
"growth and form uh his lab's current"
directions
"are in understanding how somatic cells"
"form bioelectrical networks restoring"
"and recalling pattern memories that"
"guide morphogenesis"
"uh he's involved in creating"
"next-generation artificial intelligence"
tools
"for helping scientists understand"
"top-down control methods"
"of pattern regulation and also using"
"these insights to enable new"
"capabilities in gender medicine"
engineering
"dr levin got dual degrees in both"
"computer science and biology"
"and received this phd from harvard uh he"
"does postdoc training at harvard medical"
"school where he began to uncover"
"uh this new concept of a bioelectric"
"language behind cells that helped"
"coordinate embryogenesis uh his"
"independent laboratory"
"it develops new molecular genetic and"
"conceptual tools to pose large-scale"
"information processing"
"during regeneration embryogenesis and"
"cancer suppression and he has a slew of"
"recent honors"
"including the scientist division award"
"and distinguished scholar award uh all"
"that being said dr michael vinn thanks"
"so much for joining us"
"on the show today well thank you very"
"much for having me it's a pleasure to be"
here
"mike it's it's always great to see you"
"uh i'm always amazed by"
"by all the things you have going on i'd"
"like to hand you the floor just for a"
"couple of minutes uh to sort of"
"introduce yourself to the audience and"
"just a little bit of about your"
"background and how you got uh"
"involved and interested in this"
"fascinating area of of form control and"
morphology
"and obviously bioelectric networks yeah"
"uh my original um interest it was well"
"my my background is computer science"
"initially and i was always interested in"
"this question of"
"how minds arise in bodies so if you look"
"around you see a wide variety especially"
"in biology you see a wide variety of"
"organisms you know bugs i started out as"
"a kid looking at bugs"
"and insects and various things and you"
"know there's this"
"fascinating question of how the"
"the mechanics and the uh sort of the"
"chemistry the mechanics the physics"
"of uh the way that the body operates"
"allows these bodies to do"
"things like store memories have"
"preferences try to"
"implement goals uh some of them can plan"
"anticipate and so on"
"and so i'm really interested in this"
"interface between mind and body to"
"to figure out what are the necessary and"
sufficient
"conditions for the kinds of processes"
"that can be considered"
"uh cognitive or mental in some in some"
sense
"and so the kinds of processes that we"
"deal with"
"of course are include behavior which is"
"what typically people"
"how people study these things but we"
"also look at"
"the cognitive side of processes that"
"people normally don't"
"treat that way they uh they usually"
"think about these things as mechanical"
"in some sense"
"such as uh embryonic development"
regeneration
"the kinds of uh the kinds of processes"
"that that enable complex very complex"
biological
"structures to form and to be um and to"
"be maintained against against aging and"
"so on"
"and so one way to look at these things"
is
"as the outcome of a swarm intelligence"
"so you have a collection of cells"
"these cells are individually quite"
"competent they do various things as we"
"know from"
"looking at unicellular life forms but"
"when they get together"
"they form these these collectives these"
"cellular swarms"
"that are able to pursue goals and when i"
"say goals i mean"
"things like we're going to make a"
"correct salamander arm"
"and we're going to keep going until that"
"is achieved and as soon as we get the"
"correct salamander arm we're going to"
stop
"proliferating and remodeling and so i'm"
"really interested in in this question of"
"how intelligence"
"and problem solving scales and how you"
"can get"
"from individual cells that do"
"interesting things to"
"cellular collectives that do completely"
"different things whose goals are not"
"the goals of any individual cell in that"
"collective so the scaling of cognition"
"the origins of"
"things like preferences and goals in in"
"all kinds of"
"media you know the biological media of"
"course electronic media"
"all of those things that's that's what's"
"of great interest to us"
"and and uh moving along that path"
"obviously the last time we chatted we"
"talked a lot about"
"uh morphology uh you know the concept as"
"you were just saying that whether we're"
"talking about"
"shape or size or polarity or position of"
something
"that's a lot more than a gene or a"
"specific protein but these really"
"complex interactions"
"could you just take a few minutes um"
"sort of anyway discuss this for a long"
"time last time but"
"sort of reintroducing this uh concept"
"that's been around for about a century"
"of a morphogenetic field"
"your interest in bioelectric networks as"
a
"reservoir of that information and this"
"briefly if you could touch one your"
"interest in"
"looking at ways of modulating those"
"bioelectric fields with very interesting"
um
"ion channel moieties small molecule"
drugs
"as opposed to some of the other topics"
"we hear about nowadays like"
"electroceuticals they're sort of"
"zapping these particular networks"
"and that's a multi-part question sorry"
"about that yeah um"
"right there's a lot of interesting"
"things there so so i think"
"one of the first things to to point out"
"is that"
"i i'm certainly not making the claim"
"that gene"
"networks and and proteins are not"
"important i think of course they're"
"absolutely critical"
"but i think uh one way one fruitful way"
"to look at this"
"area is that those define the hardware"
"of the living system so what your"
"genes do for you is they describe uh in"
"in in sufficient detail to to to have"
"them build"
"uh the proteins and the other uh kinds"
"of structures that are available"
"to cells and thus and thus to tissue so"
"that that defines the hardware"
"now once you we we all know from from"
"from computer science and complexity"
"theory and various other"
"cybernetics various other disciplines"
that
"knowing what you're what the structure"
"of your hardware is is"
"not quite sufficient to understand"
"systems if they"
"uh go above a certain level of"
"complexity so if you're dealing with a"
"uh you know with a mechanical clock then"
"pretty much knowing the hardware"
"tells you everything you need to know"
"you're not going to be uh"
"talking about its preferences you're not"
"going to be trying to convince it of"
"anything you're not going to be"
"communicating with it you can treat it"
"as a machine and and that that provides"
"an optimal uh level of explanation and"
control
"but of course we know that there are"
"other systems for example"
"uh living systems with brains as just"
"one example"
"which have a different property i mean"
"yes of course the hardware is critical"
"both the molecular and the sort of the"
neural
"neural types of hardware but but these"
"machines have abilities"
"that have to do with memories with"
"expectations with preferences"
"and what that means is that you can you"
"can explain and control these things"
"using different strategies you can try"
"to motivate them for example"
"with rewards and punishments you can"
"formulate theories of what they're going"
"to do based on what experiences they've"
"had in the past"
"you can think about memories they may"
"have you can think about goals that they"
may
"uh be able to achieve and you may you"
"may maybe um"
"what you want to do is uh re rewrite"
"those goals you may act you may try to"
"convince that system to to"
"to pursue a different goal so what you"
"really have then is this"
"uh this this continuum this axis and i"
"and i don't i i don't believe in a"
"binary distinction between mechanisms"
"and cognitive systems i"
"i think that's a complete false"
"dichotomy i think"
"what we have is a is a continuum and the"
"real question is not"
"uh whether or not you are a mindful"
"system the question is how cognitive are"
"you whatever whatever that system is and"
"it might be very little and it might be"
"quite a lot"
"and so so based on that continuum your"
"strategies for"
"optimal prediction and control are going"
"to be different you have a richer"
toolkit
"on the far side of that continuum if a"
"system is is is really"
"you know reprogrammable if it has if it"
"has gold um directed capacity memory and"
"so on"
"so so one question you might ask is is"
"where do"
"patterning systems land on that"
"continuum so for example embryonic"
"development regeneration"
"and so on and uh the reason the reason"
"it matters quite a bit"
"is is very practical so so i think it's"
important
"to keep in mind that what i'm not"
"talking about is is"
"is affiliate philosophical um uh"
"considerations of of of uh"
"you know what what makes for a uh for a"
"cognitive system"
"those things have been argued argued"
"about for for hundreds of years"
"this is an extremely practical issue and"
"the practical issue is this"
"if we want to achieve the goals of"
"regenerative medicine so let's say"
"inducing a replacement a limb or an eye"
"or creating some other biological organ"
"or structure or in fact a synthetic"
"living machine"
"then it becomes a a really practical"
"question what is the fastest path to"
that
"because um building it from scratch"
"you know using let's say stem cell"
"derivatives you know 3d printing that"
"kind of stuff"
"is is is going to be a very hard road to"
"micromanaging something as complex as a"
"as a human hand for example"
"is going to be incredibly difficult and"
"so with the techniques that we the"
"bottom up techniques that we have things"
like
"genomic editing stem cell biology these"
"are all"
"incredibly important tools for specific"
"things but"
"uh one wonders whether they're going to"
"be sufficient"
"to really get us to the capacities that"
"we want in regenerative medicine"
"so it matters if we if we discover that"
"uh these kind of morphogenetic processes"
"are actually"
"uh have a a a cognitive component to"
"them that we can exploit"
"it matters because we all you know we"
"know that for"
"just to give you a silly example um if"
"you want uh or"
"something like a rat to do a circus"
"trick to put a ball in a hoop or"
"something like this"
"you've got two choices right so you can"
"you can try to"
"uh directly control all the relevant"
"neurons in the rat's brain and sort of"
"operate it like a puppet and get it to"
"do that"
"and maybe that's possible and i think it"
"will take"
"it's certainly not going to happen in"
"our lifetime but at some point maybe"
"it'll be possible to do that"
"but there's another strategy that people"
"have used for"
"probably thousands of years with knowing"
"nothing about what's actually uh between"
"the ears of a rat"
"and that's training and training the"
"animal so the idea is that you can take"
"advantage of the fact that it's"
"uh it has uh preferences and and various"
"behavioral features"
"and you can you can get to the same end"
"goal of this complex system"
"knowing much less about the the um its"
"inner workings"
"and in fact it went much faster than if"
"you were trying to manipulate it with"
"molecules and"
"and proteins and so on so so it becomes"
"really important to ask"
"what aspects of biological functioning"
"are amenable"
"to that kind of approach and so so years"
"ago um i was i was sort of floored by"
"you know many many years ago now i was"
"floored by this idea that"
"um embryonic development is regulative"
"that is in some"
"animals you can cut the embryo in half"
"and you don't get a half"
"embryo you get two perfectly normal"
"monozygotic twins because"
"each half of the embryo knows what's"
"missing it regenerates the rest and so"
on
"and the same thing with regeneration you"
"know you have a salamander"
"if you have a salamander you amputate"
"the limb um the cells undergo this this"
"incredible activity of proliferating and"
"and remodeling and so on and then it"
"makes a correct salamander limit as soon"
"as it makes that limb that's when it"
stops
"so what you have here is a system that"
"can recognize this particular target"
"morphology can recognize"
"the the end goal that it's working"
"towards and then and then stop"
"so it becomes interesting to ask to what"
"extent is is a system like that"
"uh actually in some important sense a"
"goal-directed system that represents"
"at least some parts of what it's trying"
"to accomplish internally and could we"
"could we uh um could could we"
"communicate with this primitive"
"um collective intelligence and and and"
"thus drive it to do things that might be"
"very hard to micromanage from the bottom"
up
"and so i started thinking about this and"
"thinking about um other systems that we"
"know of that have this property and the"
"most obvious one is of course the brain"
"and so the brain is a a"
"a collection of cells that are that are"
"somehow able to work together"
"to represent and pursue very large"
"goals that are not uh that don't belong"
"to any one cell in particular"
"um and so and so you you start to to ask"
"you know that's the goal of neuroscience"
"to understand how this all works"
"but what's interesting in the in the"
"brain is that uh"
"evolution exploited a particular set of"
"physics principles which is"
"bioelectricity um and it"
"and and this enables the brain to do"
"things that we now understand"
"electrical networks can do they can"
"process information they can do logic"
"they can store memories"
"of pattern recognition all these"
"interesting modularity all these"
"interesting things"
"so so from that um it's it's"
"that the next question becomes well you"
"know uh"
"what happened before there were brains"
"and did"
"these and did these magic capacities of"
"of neurons"
"exist prior to that and as it turns out"
"they did and"
"and in fact they predate um most of the"
"interesting things here in in terms of"
"ion channels and"
"neurotransmitters and and synapses"
"synapses and so on"
"all of these things predate uh uh the"
"development of the nervous system and"
"many of them predate multicellularity"
"bacteria already do a lot of these"
things
"so this sort of led me to think that"
"um perhaps what we need to be uh doing"
"in order to"
"address things like birth defects and"
"traumatic injury and and tumor"
"you know tumor remodeling and and so on"
"maybe one thing we could do"
"is manipulate the information processing"
"in these cells and tissues"
"and so this is where uh this sort of"
"parts way with"
"with some of the bioengineering"
"approaches to bioelectricity there are"
"lots of people that have achieved"
interesting
"uh outcomes by applying electrical"
"currents to things okay"
"that that can certainly be done um but"
"what what that what the limitation there"
"is that"
"um it's still sort of pursuing the"
original
"um kind of the the older strategy of"
"micromanaging the system we're going to"
"apply some force to it"
"and we're going to uh you know we're"
"going to um"
"make specific alterations by applying"
"forces i think"
"i think that's going to be that that"
"works in in some"
"interesting applications but it's not"
"the whole picture and the whole picture"
"is that you don't want to force the"
"system what you want to do is motivate"
"the system"
"and what i mean by that and i'm not you"
"know people say oh that's very"
anthropomorphic
"the point the point is not to say that"
"collections of cells"
"have hopes and dreams in the same way"
"that let's say human beings can"
"the point is to demystify the"
"understanding of cognition in humans"
"and to point out that in fact it's not"
"magic it there's a it has"
"simpler versions that date all the way"
"back to bacterial biofilms"
"and uh to say and to simply say that"
"uh the fact that we can store memories"
"and pursue goals is a really advanced"
"version of something that systems have"
"been doing for uh eons and a biology"
"discovered this trick"
"long long ago and that you know it it"
"it it disrespects our understanding of"
evolution
"to to think that there's some some some"
"clear bright line that"
"that's between you know cognitive uh"
"agents that are you know i don't know"
"maybe great apes and humans as some"
"people think"
"and then everything else is sort of as"
"if cognitive i think that's a major"
mistake
"so what we do is we try to understand"
"how it is that electrical communication"
"between cells and i'm talking about all"
"cells you know embryonic cells not just"
"nerve and muscle"
"how electrical communication underlies"
"the ability of these cells to join into"
networks
"that have group intelligence that have a"
"swarm intelligence in the same sense"
"that people study anthills and and flog"
"flocks of birds and so on"
"and how this these uh these these"
"large-scale electrical networks"
"can do interesting things like represent"
"morphological outcomes so"
"they can store and process information"
"and thus they can they can tell"
"uh what the correct uh anatomical state"
"should be"
"and they can tell when the current state"
"deviates from that for example during"
"injury or"
"or early development or cancer or"
"something like that and so what we've"
"been doing"
"is learning to manipulate these"
"endogenous electrical states not by"
"applying currents or exogenous"
"external fields again those techniques"
"have been successfully used for years"
"for various"
"various aspects they're very hard to"
"control they're it's very you know"
"they're kind of a blunt tool"
"and what we do is we use modern uh"
"techniques of molecular neuroscience"
"so this is everything from ion channel"
"blocker drugs to"
"um optogenetics so light based opening"
"and closing of ion channels"
"to manipulate the natural mechanism by"
"which these"
"cell collectives coordinate their"
"activity so"
"we turn on and off various ion channels"
"we turn on and off"
"um electrical synapses and thus we"
control
"the information processing in that uh"
"in that in that group of cells so rather"
"than when we're not trying to"
"um force it to a particular micro state"
"because that's incredibly difficult and"
"i think in the end it's not going to"
work
"we are trying to alter uh the the the"
"memory and the perception the"
"the primitive the primitive cognition"
"that these group agents are"
"are implementing and just as a"
"for the audience uh dr levin has"
"published extensively uh in these areas"
"in terms of embryogenesis in terms of"
"regeneration in terms of normalizing"
tumors
"i suggest anyone that wants to put him"
"into pubmed and read"
"uh some of the most fascinating papers"
"you'll you'll come in contact with do"
that
"um what i wanted to do mike what i"
"wanted to uh"
"ask you about today because it's"
"extremely recent and once again it comes"
"to this theme that you're just talking"
"about in terms of motivation"
"you know always so when i when i read"
"your papers and i think about that"
"salamander or the or the planarian"
"i always think about wow this is a"
"fascinating word it's kind of dirty"
"uh whether it's hanging out in the swamp"
"or whether it's getting bitten by it's"
"them getting bitten off by a snake"
"there's a lot of germs around and i was"
"wondering you know i wonder if those"
"bacteria have anything"
"are involved at all in this regenerative"
"process and lo and behold uh"
"i checked your uh your papers the other"
"day and you have a new paper that has to"
"do with"
"uh regulating the axial and head"
"patterning of planarian regeneration"
"by a commensal bacteria that hangs out"
"in the planaria"
"it's a fascinating paper talk a little"
"bit about how now"
"you're looking okay and we have sort of"
"the genetic tools the biophysical"
"is there a microbiome component of this"
"motivation that"
"no one's looked at yet and this is why"
"you're beginning to look at this theme"
"as well"
"yeah um we and so so this is work done"
"with uh ben wolf's lab"
"also at tufts university ben wolfe is a"
microbiologist
"uh that studies bacteria of various"
"kinds and"
"what we uh try to do is is we we try to"
understand
"the the this from the the following"
scenario
"uh in in in certain types of biological"
"experiments there there's a lot of"
"stochasticity meaning"
"you do exactly the same experiment to a"
"set of animals you put exactly the same"
"thing in the water"
"and you get two different outcomes and"
"so one one thing that we were facing in"
"our in our planarian models and planaria"
"these flatworms that regenerate every"
"part of the body so you chop them into"
"pieces and every piece"
"knows exactly what's missing regrows"
"exactly what it needs you get"
"now you have multiple normal worms so we"
were
"in in messing around with these"
"electrical um"
"uh elec electrical uh circuits that"
dictate
"what a planarian is supposed to look"
"like meaning how many heads how many"
tails
"we were able to make two-headed worms"
"and and that you know that was published"
"years ago"
"our more recent work show that there's"
"another manipulation that you can make"
"where you put a let's say a hundred"
"worms under the same conditions"
"70 of them will come out one-headed 30"
"will come out two-headed"
"and i i was i was incredibly interested"
"in this question of"
"why why why is the outcome different for"
"for a given worm why is the answer not"
"always the same right why do they have"
"these diverse outcomes and of course"
"biomedically it's critical because we"
"all know that"
"any any uh drug that you take if there's"
a
"there's a wide range of efficacy there's"
"a wide range of side effects"
"it's just not the same for every person"
"that takes it so we were interested in"
this
"and one hypothesis that we came up with"
"was that"
"maybe this has to do with differences in"
"the microbiome of these animals"
"i should point out that these these"
"planaria are clonal"
"so they all came from one worm that was"
"sent to me from japan in the year 2000"
"or so"
"and uh and so so they all live in the"
"same box so so"
"not only are there genetics clonal um"
with
"some caveats but but but they're not an"
"outbred population in the in that"
"in with the same variety that let's say"
"human human beings are they live in the"
"same box so their environment is all the"
"same and yet they're having these"
"different outcomes why would that be"
"so we had this idea that maybe it's the"
"microbiome and what makes that"
"reasonable is that well if these worms"
"have a bioelectric"
"set of mechanisms that control the"
"ability of the"
"tissues to regenerate wouldn't there be"
"an evolutionary"
"uh an evolutionary force for the various"
"things that live on and around planaria"
"to learn to hijack that system"
"so there'd be this pressure this this"
"evolutionary arms race where"
"the planaria are trying to control their"
"own pattern but"
"the the the commensals and the parasites"
"and everything else that that lives on"
them
"might want might develop over over"
"evolutionary time might develop ways to"
"plug into that same system and to"
"basically hijack it for its own ends"
"whatever that"
"may be and so what we discovered long"
"long story short is that"
"in fact well first of all there are tons"
"of bacteria that live"
"normally on these planaria sure and we"
"discovered that"
"if you disrupt the balance among the"
"different types the different species"
"and those one particular species that we"
"um that we worked with"
"that if you if you just disrupt this"
balance
"in fact the planarian pieces will"
"uh have very characteristic defects"
"they're more likely to make two heads"
"they have defects of the visual system"
"so the the nerves that go from the brain"
"to the eyes are not normal the eyes"
"themselves are not normal"
"so there are all these morphological"
"changes that are induced by"
"nothing other than the presence of"
"different types of bacteria"
"on the worms the genetics of the worms"
"is untouched in fact the bioelectrics"
"are not directly manipulated meaning we"
"don't we don't directly do anything to"
"to them"
"it's the it's it's which bacteria live"
"on these things that matters"
"really fascinating really fascinating um"
"now okay talking about bacteria now"
"moving a little bit up the chain"
"and as i mentioned beforehand i got a"
"lot of people yelling at me that the"
"last time we chatted we didn't talk"
"enough about the topic of xenobots"
"but um you know this is uh everybody can"
"google this"
"uh i mean an amazing amount of uh"
"stuff in the popular press but basically"
uh
"living uh artificial organisms derived"
"from uh"
"xenopus frog embryos uh a lot of the"
"uh the work and and you can take this if"
"you went through a little bit this"
"concept of evolutionary algorithms"
"artificial ontogeny"
"uh but you know a lot of the stuff in"
"the uh the popular press had to do hey"
"what can we do with these"
"uh can be these potentially be used to"
"clean up oceans"
"one day could they be used to terraform"
"other planets but"
"once again you know a new new new uh"
"paper that you just came out with uh"
"life death in the cell fundamental"
"questions about primitive cognition view"
"to the lens of bodily plasticity and"
"synthetic organisms"
"where you go into a fascinating uh"
"discussion about how"
"uh though all those those things are"
"great but one thing we can really"
"interesting do with these xenobots"
"is now we have the ability to study as"
"you were saying sort of"
"uh the the transition of the self"
"from embryo to what we are today and how"
"our ability to store information over"
"time changes"
"uh walk us through this uh please it's a"
"fascinating concept"
"yeah um let me let me introduce real"
"quick uh for for people who haven't"
"heard of the"
"of the whole xenobot story i'll just"
"introduce what that is and then i'll"
"i'll talk about this um"
"this this paper that you're talking"
"about so how"
"how this whole thing started as is a"
"couple of a couple of"
"uh directions that led us to this number"
"one is just in general you know my"
"background is engineering i'm interested"
"in of course taking things apart but"
"also really important to be able to put"
"them together"
"so i'm interested in what is what is"
"sufficient for the kinds of"
"um cognitive and behavioral phenomena"
"that we see not just"
"the the parts that are necessary so we"
"want to build these things from scratch"
"and uh the other thing that we were"
"interested in is plasticity in other"
words
"normally frog embryonic cells make a"
frog
"fish cells make a fish and human cells"
"make a human"
"um if you ask i mean i've given talks to"
"middle school kids and you know and even"
"the nine-year-olds if you ask them why"
"is it that a frog egg makes a frog and a"
"chicken egg makes a chicken they will"
"immediately say dna it's the genome"
"so one interesting thing that i like to"
"think about is"
"what what what are cells actually able"
"to build"
"so normally of course there's a default"
"thing that they will build all other"
things
"being equal if you don't uh disrupt it"
"you know the chicken embryo cells will"
"make a chicken"
"but is that in fact all it can build and"
"to what extent is it reprogrammable"
"so you know having fixed the hardware of"
these
"of these cells and and we were there"
"there's lots of work on plasticity some"
"of our early work was like"
"uh if you um if you if you"
"cause an eye to form on the tail of a"
"tadpole instead of in the head"
"those tadpoles can see out of that eye"
"perfectly well so so that eye connects"
"to the spinal cord not directly to the"
brain
"and those animals can see so so already"
"you're starting to see this incredible"
"plasticity that when the body structure"
changes
"the the brain is is completely not um"
"uh uh you know uh disturbed by the fact"
"that hey"
"i'm getting uh some information from"
"this weird patch of tissue on the back"
"here and and i know that's visual data"
"and and i can"
"perform in a behavioral light sensing"
"assay so so there's plasticity so we're"
"interested in this plasticity and so"
"what we did was to take"
"some cells out of an early frog embryo"
"and i should say"
"there's one primary paper that came out"
"last year on this in pnas"
"and there's there's this there's a whole"
"set of new papers that are about to come"
"out and then down in the pipeline there"
"will be"
"a lot more of this in the next in the"
"next few weeks and then the next month"
"excellent so i'm just going to talk"
"about the kind of the general aspects of"
"this that that may not already be in"
"that one pnaas paper that you will have"
"seen by today"
"um the the deal is that we we we took"
"some cells"
"from from early frog embryos uh in"
"particular we focused on skin cells so"
"just removing some cells that are going"
"to be skin"
"we took we liberated them from the"
"normal context of the frog embryo we put"
"them in a separate environment and we"
asked
"what what what would they build if"
"anything and so there are lots of"
"possibilities one thing is they could"
"have just crawled away from each other"
"and sort of sat alone in a dish"
"they could have um not done anything and"
"and became kind of this lump in the in"
"in reality what they did was they"
"cooperated together"
"they constructed a an interesting little"
"creature which we call a zenobot"
"for xenopus levis which is the name of"
"the frog"
"and uh what these things do is they move"
"on their own they navigate through an"
"aqueous environment"
"and they have uh they have a variety of"
"behaviors so they have individual"
"behaviors they have group"
"behavior so they cooperate in a group"
"they pass information to each other in a"
group
"and uh they don't look anything like"
"tadpoles or frogs and they have a"
"a brand new um behavioral and more"
"morphological repertoire"
"there's a couple of interesting things"
"about that the first thing is i"
"sometimes when i give talks about this i"
"sometimes give a talk this way"
"i show videos of these things running"
"around and doing various things"
"and then i ask people to guess what it"
"is and people will say well"
"you found it in the bottom of a pond"
"somewhere and they say yeah well"
"i've got the genome well you know we"
"know we know the genome of these things"
"and people say oh it's fantastic uh"
"let's look at the genome and then we'll"
"learn something and i said well the"
"genome is 100 xenopus lavish"
"what what can we tell from that in fact"
"you can tell very little from that"
because
"the the reprogramming plasticity is such"
"that it can take features"
"that like things like cilia like other"
"other other um"
"you know adhesion proteins other things"
"that these cells have and"
"it it basically repurposes them for a"
"completely different"
"system level outcome so while you have"
"the genome you can have"
"you can have 100 insight into the the"
"nuts and bolts of this thing into the"
"material and the hardware"
"you actually uh have have a really hard"
"time predicting"
"um what these things are capable of both"
"morphogenetically and behaviorally"
"and the reality is that's always true in"
"other words"
"looking at a genome a straight-up genome"
"under normal conditions we can't tell"
"what the animal is going to look like"
"right you can cheat and compare that"
"genome to another animal that you do"
"know what it looks like and say well"
"this kind of looks like a tetrapod and"
"it actually it's very similar to a fish"
"i'm going to say it's going to look like"
"a fish right but that's cheating the"
"idea that the reality is that"
"we don't have the ability to to look at"
"a genome and and and derive"
"from the beginning what what this thing"
"is actually going to make"
"but that that aspect is obscured a lot"
"of people"
"don't think of it that way it's obscured"
"by the fact that it's so reliable so"
"nobody nobody thinks about that because"
"we all know that"
"that fish eggs make fish and so on and"
"and in these zenobots it really"
"uh is brought to light how little"
"predictive value"
"we still have in in these cases right"
"where where cells"
"um have the opportunity to sort of"
"reimagine their multicellularity"
"without changing the genome we didn't"
"have to engineer anything about the"
"genome these cells already know how to"
"do this"
"so so that's one interesting thing about"
"them the other interesting thing about"
"them is"
"if you for any other creature on earth"
"that i'm aware of if you wanted to know"
why
"it looks a certain way or why it's able"
"to swim or why it's able to do various"
things
"the answer is always the same well it's"
"because the ancestors going back"
"you know thousands or millions of years"
"its ancestors were"
"selected for the ability to do this so"
"there's this there's always a back story"
"of of long periods of evolution and"
selection
"these zenobots don't have that they're"
"the only system"
"uh on on the planet at the moment whose"
uh
"who whose evolutionary um selection you"
"took at the level of the organism took"
"place inside a virtual world it was"
evolved
"actually in a uh in a in a simulation of"
"of um"
"of the bond guard lab in their in their"
"computer so of course now the individual"
cells
"were of course evolved on earth but"
"these skin cells were evolved for being"
"able to sit quietly on the outside of a"
"frog embryo and keep out the pathogens"
"they were not evolved with selective"
"specific selective pressure"
"to form this this this weird looking"
"thing that's going to swim around and do"
"all this stuff that that tadpoles and"
"frogs don't do"
"so uh what this synthetic system allows"
"you to do"
"is get away from the frozen accidents of"
evolution
"and this this long this baggage of of"
"selection and"
"and and and ask from from from scratch"
"what are cells able and willing to do in"
"a completely novel configuration"
"that wasn't shaped by the specific uh"
"um ecological uh you know niches and"
"and and and eons of pressure to be a"
"particular way"
"um in fact uh and and so"
"and so it becomes really interesting to"
"to watch the appearance of new body"
"plans and new structures"
"from scratch in front of you within"
"within two days"
"you get this thing that it has could"
could
"easily be mistaken for any other"
"creature you might find it has it has"
"all these"
"uh all these interesting capacities and"
"yet there was no"
"lengthy uh evolutionary selection for"
"what you're seeing"
"so i think that's that's important and"
um
"you know there are other there are other"
"examples of this"
"that uh people have picked out picked up"
"in the past"
"but this is this is an incredibly um"
"tractable new platform"
"because you can do this in front of your"
"eyes in a very sort of molecularly"
amenable
"system two examples that i always think"
"of that are kind of related to this"
"one one is the rubber hand illusion if"
"you've ever seen this you can you can"
"see these videos on youtube where"
"you sort of set up a rubber hand and you"
"and you put away your own hand and you"
"look down and you you sort of stroke"
"this rubber hand with a"
"uh uh with a with a with a paintbrush or"
"something like this"
"and within a short amount of time while"
"while somebody's actually uh doing the"
"same thing to your hand"
"you know off off where you can't see it"
"within a very short time"
"you start imagining this rubber hand as"
"your hand okay"
"and and then and then somebody will the"
"the funny clips on youtube somebody will"
"take out a hammer and they and they"
"whack the"
"they whack the rubber hand and the"
"person the person jumps like you know"
"just just"
"completely jumps think about what that"
"is you"
"the the the basic body plan of of having"
"four limbs and"
"in particular two for you know two four"
"limbs has been with us for"
"how many millions of years and within"
"less than"
"10 minutes your brain is willing to"
"accept the fact that well i got three"
"hands now"
"yeah so right so the plasticity is is"
just
"you know it's just ridiculous the the"
"the ability of of of of this"
"expectation of having having this body"
"structure that's been that's been with"
"you for"
"you know millennia can be overridden by"
"experience within minutes"
"and and and this is also this has also"
"been seen in sensory substitution"
"experiments and augmented"
"augmented reality and all of that so so"
"very interested in this"
"in this plasticity so what in this in"
this
"paper and and so of course people are"
"interested in"
"uh useful synthetic living machines you"
"know can we learn to program these these"
"bots and what can they do"
"you know we talk about um you know they"
"can go through your bloodstream someday"
"and scrape the artery"
"the fat off the arteries and they can"
"maybe uh you know chase down cancer"
"cells or whatever"
"and out in the environment they'll do"
"you know useful things"
"but i think the bigger uh really the"
"fundamental importance of this is what"
"it's telling us about cellular"
plasticity
"and what it's telling us about the"
"collective goals"
"of these group agents and where they"
"come from you know"
"if you ask the question of where does"
"the goal of making a precise salamander"
"limb come from in a salamander embryo"
"you're tempted to tell a story about"
"selection and long periods you know long"
"evolutionary history of shaping the"
"embryo to a specific thing"
"but where do the behavioral and"
"morphological goals of these zenobots"
"come from they're they're a completely"
"novel form"
"and i think understanding uh"
"understanding this um"
"the ability of of new new goals and uh"
"and and new group cognitive structures"
"from scratch"
"is is incredibly important not only for"
"biology and regenerative medicine and"
"learning to"
"convince cells to make organs for"
"transplant and all that but but think"
about
"the issues that we're facing with"
"technology and um"
"and artificial intelligence you know we"
"are going to be"
"surrounded i think in our in in our"
"lifetime we're going to be surrounded"
"by uh very competent subunits there's"
"going to be the internet of"
"things your refrigerator is going to"
"want to do things your your roomba wants"
"to do things you know there's going to"
"be there's going to be machines around"
"everywhere that have small scale goals"
"and some degree of flexibility about how"
"they go about to achieve those"
"they're all going to be communicating"
"with each other and"
"we are going to be sitting in the middle"
"of this massive"
"collective intelligence that is going to"
have
"certain cognitive properties we have no"
"clue what those properties are"
"we don't we don't have a good science"
yet
"of um being able to go from the"
"understanding of what the subunits are"
doing
"to some understanding of the robustness"
"the the goal directedness the the the"
preferences
"and so on these these cognitive"
"properties of"
"the collective of which they are apart"
"so so when you have this internet of"
things
"there are going to be lots of surprises"
"and anybody who works in robotics in"
"artificial life knows that these systems"
"have incredible capacity to surprise us"
"and that's because we don't understand"
"where goals and"
"and um mental properties of of"
collectives
"come from and that's another you know"
"that's another area of this of this"
"field it's not just biomedicine and"
neuroscience
"it's artificial intelligence and and"
"swarm robotics and all of those things"
"and and and keeping on that theme um you"
"know the last time we chatted"
"uh we talked a little bit about probably"
"one of my favorite"
"of your papers the stability of memories"
"during brain remodeling"
"a perspective and in communicative"
"integrative biology"
"where you know you go into the planarian"
"brain the amphibian"
"the the metamorphic insects uh the the"
"mam the the small hibernating mammals"
"their brain collapses memories come back"
somehow
"um recently i saw an announcement that"
tufts
"uh was uh given this technology by"
"the venture capitalist jeff stevel uh"
"called braingate"
"uh a uh sort of brain computer interface"
"tool neurotechnol and really"
"advanced stuff uh and and you know here"
"we are you're quoted"
"in the uh in the article talking about"
uh
"another besides sort of the typical"
"brain computer interface stuff that we"
"think about moving the robotic arm"
"here's a tool that may allow us finally"
"to begin to interpret some of this"
communication
"um and how these memories survive where"
"they go"
"uh just talk a little bit about what"
"this project is about if you could and"
"then you know sort of"
"uh is this something where you're gonna"
"strap the uh the salamander in to study"
"its brain or is this"
"something you can just go right to"
"humans and in different disease states"
and
"begin to understand you know what's"
"going on and different"
"areas of damage when we how memories are"
"recalled and so forth"
"yeah these are right so so this is a"
"very powerful technology and uh it's"
"going to be used of course for"
"uh for neurological diseases and the"
"study of brains and all of that"
"um and i think it has it has huge"
"potential in those in those areas"
"the the name of the game in general for"
"this kind of thing is"
"something akin to neural decoding so the"
"idea is that"
"if we believe that your mind is"
"in in some important sense a function of"
"the processes going on inside your brain"
"then you ought to be able to if we knew"
"what we were doing you ought to be able"
"to read out"
"the electrical and maybe the chemical"
"states of of the brain"
"and be able to decode them and to have"
"an idea of what that person"
"is thinking about at that time what"
"their goals states are what their"
"memories are and so on"
"there should that should at least be"
"possible and there are people that are"
"that are working on it and this"
"technology is an important"
"step in that direction by allowing us to"
"take readings"
"from uh various parts of the brain and"
"get the data of of what what it's"
"electrically doing"
"we we have applied uh although we"
"haven't used physically that"
"the technology yet we've we've used"
"other methods to"
"try to apply the same tools of"
neuroscience
"outside of neurons so so knowing that"
"there are electrical circuits in all"
"tissues that are really important for"
"uh determining what these tissues are"
"going to be doing"
"we would like to read them out to read"
"out that information we'd like to be"
"able to decode it we call this"
"cracking the bioelectric code so we"
"could use exactly the same technology"
"and we've been using voltage-sensitive"
"fluorescent dyes"
"but the electrodes are really useful as"
"well to uh to read out"
"these electrical signals and uh try to"
"try to decode"
"what the cells are are trying to do are"
"they on their way to making a particular"
"organ if so what will the shape be are"
"they on their way to tumorogenesis"
"if so how do we how do we convince them"
"to go otherwise and so on"
"uh so so it's a very um very important"
um
"technology for that the thing with the"
"thing that you you that you mentioned"
"about uh the persistence of memories"
"for in in brain uh regeneration let's"
say
"i i sort of in the in that other paper"
"that you mentioned in the bbrc paper"
"i tried to take this in a in a different"
"direction and to really hammer"
"this idea that see i think i think in"
"when when you deal with standard animal"
"species so so here's a mouse here's a"
"zebra fish here's a human"
"with their long evolutionary history and"
"it's a and then and you can count them"
"you know exactly what a mouse is and"
"and exactly what a zebrafish is you we"
we
"sort of get the feeling that we know"
"things that we actually don't know"
"and i think that one one important way"
"of and"
"and that paper has a bunch of of this"
"already but i'm working on a couple of"
"other papers that should really"
"just just uh really really blast this"
"this point hard"
"is that by making these novel synthetic"
"living organisms and in fact chimeric"
organisms
"uh it starts to that that starts to show"
"us that things that we thought we"
"understood we really don't understand i"
"think that's very important in science"
"is to"
"keep an eye on where the the profound"
"areas of ignorance are"
"so um when i say when i say chimeric i'm"
"talking about the fact that"
"um you can actually you know cells and"
"in fact"
"non-living materials are highly"
"interoperable so"
"you can put together cells of uh you you"
"can put"
"drosophila neurons into a mouse brain or"
"in fact into a human brain they do"
"perfectly fine together"
"you can combine uh embryos of frog and"
"salamander they do perfectly fine"
together
"you immediately find out that wow i have"
"no idea"
"what the shape of that is going to be"
"because baby salamanders have legs"
"frog larvae do not have legs if i mix"
"half and half of cells are they going to"
"have legs"
"not a clue right despite despite the"
"fact that you have all the genetic"
"information for both species"
"you you won't know if they're going to"
"make it make legs or not and um and then"
"this by the way is an actual project in"
"our lab that we're working on"
"um because that and so and so that that"
"aspect of chimerism highlights this"
"important aspect of of our ignorance"
"about being able to predict what the"
"morphology is"
"which is already with us i mean you"
"didn't really know from the frog genome"
"either how many likes it was going to"
"have but but that's hidden that's"
"obscured by the fact that"
"everybody knows what frogs look like"
"whereas nobody knows what these chimeric"
forms
"sure are going to look like and and so"
"so you can mix cells you can mix tissues"
"you can in fact make uh combinations of"
um
"of biological forms and inorganic uh"
"materials so"
"so just to give you an example you might"
"have on on one end"
"on one end of the spectrum you might"
"have a human"
"that can move uh a wheelchair with with"
"his mind and that's something that's"
"already happening you know there's"
"electrodes there's right okay"
"and so and so also he can maybe control"
his
"vacuum cleaner he's got a robotic vacuum"
"cleaner and then he can sort of send it"
"around and have it"
"so this is so so now you have a system"
"that is um"
"you know let's say 98 human and two"
percent
"something else you know that whether"
"it's a whether it's a digital"
"um a wearable prosthetic or whether it's"
"a remote vacuum cleaner whatever it's"
"going to be right"
"now consider the flip side the flip"
"situation where you have a vacuum"
cleaner
"and or some other appliance and uh and"
"inside of it it has a bioreactor that"
has
"some some human brain cells and these"
"things make a little organoid and all"
"that organoid has been trained to do is"
"to go around and and and clean the floor"
"or something like this"
"so now you have 98 machine 2 human right"
"and as soon as you've established those"
"two poles of your continuum"
"it becomes incredibly obvious that what"
"you can actually do is fill in"
"any point along that continuum you can"
"have any percentage you want of human"
"brain of human cells and something else"
"that something else could be animal"
"cells it could be"
"um it could be smart materials it could"
"be computer components it could be"
"uh uh robotics it could be a machine"
"learning appliance"
"whatever it is so so now when we used to"
p
"people make claims like well humans have"
"real understanding of things and robots"
are
"you know robots are just robotic they're"
"just faking it's pretty clear we have no"
"idea what we're talking about"
"because what is uh you know a standard"
"issue human when you know that you can"
"have any percent of these things that"
"you want"
"and and you know there's people that"
"argue that you know robotics"
"doesn't have intrinsic motivation how do"
"you punish a robot right robots don't"
"actually care these follow algorithms"
"well that's all well and good but of"
"course we know cells do have"
"preferences and you can create very"
"easily a hybrid"
"device that has biologicals strongly"
"integrated with"
"machine learning and robotics does that"
"thing now have intrinsic preferences you"
"know this"
"this this this desire that people have"
"to make it a yes or no"
"thing it fails utterly when you think"
about
"uh these these chimeric examples right"
"and so and so that so that's something"
"that breaks down another thing that"
"breaks down"
"is this idea of of memory um"
"we we you know when you say when you say"
"something has a memory"
"you have this idea that there's this"
"integrated monadic sort of single"
"thing that that is the owner of that"
"memory you know you have this mouse and"
"the mouse knows something and you know"
"it's learned something and the mouse has"
"this memory"
"so what i talk about in that paper are"
"all the scenarios where"
"that you know you basically you you can"
"take nothing for granted because you're"
"right that that mouse is in fact a bag"
"of cells as we all are"
"and you can ask who in fact is the owner"
"of these memories"
"when the brain can be uh it can be"
"integrated with other things it can be"
"cultured it can be fused with other"
brains
"there are organisms that fall apart and"
"rejoin and they might rejoin in the same"
"combination or other combinations"
"you can think about um i talk in that"
"paper about about life and death and"
"this idea that when when an organism"
dies
"most of the cells in it are usually"
"perfectly alive"
"and you can easily imagine a scenario"
"uh in which something uh something like"
"like a like a fish dies"
"and some of the migratory cells move out"
"of the body and"
"and and live live live in a in an amoeba"
"ecological niche the way that amoebas"
"live right that's a perfectly viable way"
"to make one's living in the short"
"sphere and so and and and at some point"
"they might come back together"
"and form a little xenobot and have"
"another life form and so"
"so this idea of these fixed you know i"
"think what we have to lose is this idea"
"of these fixed natural kinds that hey"
"that's a mouse"
"there's really no such thing as any of"
"that everything is incredibly plastic"
"and um that's important because because"
"it shows us the gaps in our"
"understanding of"
"what does it mean to have a coherent"
"memory when in fact you're a collective"
"you're a collective of cells"
"and that can come and go and it can and"
"can change form"
"and you know i think i open the the"
"paper with with this question of"
"is so people in in philosophy of mind um"
"have asked the um"
"what's it like to to be something and"
"what's it like to be a bat right tommy"
"eagle asked that question"
"so that's a great question one can ask a"
"further question"
"what's it like to be a caterpillar while"
"you're transitioning to be a butterfly"
"because during that process your brain"
"is basically taken apart"
"and so that that cognitive capacity you"
know
"or or or during embryogenesis what"
"what's it like when"
"your cognition is just being put"
"together from scratch from a bunch of"
cells
"you know these things and i don't mean i"
"don't mean that"
"it it necessarily has this sort of rich"
"second order cognition where you can"
"verbalize in the line you know in a rich"
"language what that's like i don't mean"
that
"i just mean the fact that these"
"cognitive agents don't just sort of"
"show up all already and and you know"
"sort of made with with tight"
"demarcations and you know exactly what"
"it is and it's a great it's an adult"
"organism and now you can say"
"if it can learn or whatever the"
"plasticity of all this is telling us"
"that we don't understand any of these"
"things really yeah"
"and uh after i'm going to relay the"
"concept about the with the roomba"
"around here somewhere i know my son's"
"probably going to open it up make sure"
"there's not a little brain growing in"
"there now but"
"let's not think of another time um mike"
"i know we're coming up"
"against the hard stop for you i just"
"want to one one quick thing if you could"
"share about"
"two minutes of your thoughts and he"
"wrote this article recently on"
"uh you know how scientists uh you know"
"they've been hit with this restriction"
"on lab access"
"uh you wrote this article in the"
"sciences magazine using the pandemic to"
"expand the lab to home"
"just give us a couple of minutes on on"
"your your concepts of making science"
"more portable and sort of"
"a benefit that might have come out of"
"the pandemic in this context"
"yeah i mean i you know"
"in general when people hear this idea of"
"doing science at home"
"immediately one one can think of all"
"kinds of cases where that's impossible"
"so you're definitely not going to bring"
"your mouse colony home you're not going"
"to bring"
"uh you know your your bl3 viral lab"
"home there's a million ways in which in"
"which this doesn't apply"
"but at the same time i think we have to"
"realize that"
"this is not our last pandemic this is"
"this is not the last time we all get"
"sent home i think"
"not only that uh there are thriving"
"movements now"
"that are things like frugal science like"
"citizen science"
"like um people trying to find low-cost"
"ways to"
"uh develop new knowledge in environments"
"that are not"
"the same as the top-tier highly funded"
"research labs you know being able to do"
"things in the field being able to"
"do things in um developing environments"
"where you don't have all the benefits"
"that we have here in in boston and so on"
"um all of that should be"
"it's it's fantastic that all of that is"
"outward-facing to to reach more people"
"to do science"
"it should equally well be developed to"
"to face inward to ask"
"right how much of my work can i actually"
"do elsewhere if i'm not able to come to"
"the lab"
"so uh you know a lot of the kinds of"
"things that we've talked about today so"
"things having to do with"
"uh with with bacteria with slime modes"
"with plants with"
"cells with uh uh devices and they"
"already you know there's a company"
"called backyard brains that sells all"
"these kits for"
"for putting electrodes and cockroaches"
"and things like this there's an"
"incredible potential for"
"real science to be done outside the lab"
"and i think it's very important not only"
"to keep things going in a pandemic which"
"is certainly"
"now on everybody's mind but actually to"
"open up"
"science to people that are otherwise"
"limited by these very"
"uh strict kinds of environments so so"
"people that are"
"taking care of somebody whether that be"
"children or or the elderly or the infirm"
"or people who have physical limitations"
"that keep them from being in lab every"
day
"we ought to be working really hard to"
"open up science to everybody and and i"
"think we you know we can't afford"
"whether it be uh"
"us and our sort of typical scientists"
"being kept out of the lab by covid"
"or people that were kept out of it"
"before kovitz simply because"
"uh for for for numerous valid reasons"
"they couldn't show up in the lab every"
day
"um we ought to be working very hard to"
"enable these people"
"to uh to fulfill their dreams to do"
"research and to contribute knowledge and"
"i think there are so many really"
fundamental
"problems that are still addressable in a"
"very simple"
"setting and i i've done this with my"
"kids i've done it with high school"
"students that have contacted me wanting"
um
"to do a science experiment and and i"
"mentor them remotely and they end up"
"with first author publications"
"there's there's tons of stuff that's"
"accessible it's it's simply not true"
"that all the"
"all the all the interesting problems"
"that require million dollar"
"uh you know setups in a lab so so that's"
"so that's my point is"
"is um all of the tools that have been"
"created to expand science"
"uh in other environments we should be"
"taking advantage of that to keep"
"research going"
"outstanding outstanding um as as always"
"mike it's fascinating hearing everything"
"you're doing and then wishing you"
"the best with it all uh for everybody"
"listening to this particular episode on"
"the podcast network or you can be"
"watching on the youtube channel you've"
"been listening to the amazing dr michael"

"tufts university professor van over bush"
"endowed chair in biology"
"director of tufts center for"
"regenerative and developmental biology"
"and director of the allen discovery"
"center at tufts"
"mike it's always a great time seeing you"
"i want to thank you for taking the time"
"to come on the show again um to to share"
