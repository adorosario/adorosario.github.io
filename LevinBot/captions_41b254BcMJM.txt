"welcome everyone to fawcett's biotech"
"and health extension group sponsored by"
"100 plus capital i'm so thrilled to have"
"michael levine here today he was"
"recommended by someone whose"
"recommendations are hold very highly so"
"i'm terribly excited for your talk i"
"think you're tying together a variety of"
"different super interesting fields"
"you're definitely i think pushing the"
"envelope with the research that you do"
"um i will say no more and and let you"
"guide the conversation we'll have a"
"little break halfway through in which"
"we'll have a few announcements from"
"people in the community and then we'll"
"go for a longer discussion i think"
"michael already said he can stay a"
"little longer"
"but this is just a reminder for me on"
"the beginning that i will in a second"
"prompt you in the chat to ask questions"
"uh and um usually what happens at the"
"end of these talks is that lots of"
"questions we have lots of questions and"
"not the time to cover them all so don't"
"be shy ask them early then we can start"
"uploading downloading questions because"
"usually at the end of it we always try"
"to keep them as short as possible but"
"why not start early with asking"
"questions so thank you so so so much for"
"joining today and michael it's really a"
"pleasure to finally have you on we"
"scheduled this a while back already and"
"you're gonna tell us lots of things"
"about regenerative medicine that i think"
"many people here don't even have on the"
"radar yet at all you're leading the taft"
"center for regenerative and"
"developmental biology i will post more"
"on your bio in the chat for now please"
"take it away i'm really thrilled to have"
"you here and thank you for joining"
"thank you so much and yeah thank you for"
"having me and uh for the opportunity to"
"speak to you all about this um"
"so let's see uh can everybody see my"
slide
"yeah perfect okay so so you see here two"
"websites uh please feel free to get in"
"touch with me afterwards if you have any"
"questions that we don't cover everything"
"is there all the primary papers and"
"everything else is there"
"and i have to do a disclosure i have a"
"spin-off company called morphaceuticals"
"inc with david kaplan"
"and i'll tell you a little bit more"
"about that"
"so uh i want to"
"give the main point of the talk right up"
"front um and here here are the four"
"things i'm going to try to transmit"
"today i think that uh solving the"
"problem of anatomical homeostasis which"
"i will discuss is the key to really"
"transformative regenerative medicine"
"which will address aging as well as many"
"other things"
"and that"
"the current approaches focusing on stem"
"cell biology genomic editing things like"
"this are"
"limited by themselves and that what is"
"really uh really key is uh to understand"
"the software of life and i'll show you"
"some examples of that"
"a key medium by which cells compute and"
"make decisions in vivo is what we call"
"non-neural bioelectricity and it now"
"turns out that we have learned to read"
"and write various goal states into the"
"collective intelligence of tissues and"
"i'll show you some examples of that and"
"i think fundamentally that cracking this"
"bioelectric code which is a sort of"
"evolutionary precursor to the electric"
"code that our brains use will enable a"
"really profound new class of"
"electroceuticals with lots of new"
"applications in birth defects"
"regenerative medicine cancer aging and"
"synthetic bioengineering so those are my"
"main points if we boil down the whole"
"talk to one sentence what i'm here to"
"tell you is that"
"like the brain all of your body cells"
"and tissues make decisions and these are"
"decisions about"
"structure and function and that we can"
"now we have the techniques to actually"
"read uh the the information processing"
"that goes into those decisions and"
"actually modify it rationally and what"
"you see here is our one of our"
"five-legged frogs and this is my"
"reminder to tell you that you're going"
"to see all kinds of weird-looking"
"creatures today and that is not"
"photoshop these are actual real animals"
"that we produce as a means of testing"
"our theories of where"
"shape comes from and how to how to"
"control it"
"so let's talk first about some"
"fundamental knowledge gaps i want to"
"highlight what it is that we don't know"
"despite all of our"
"you know amazing advances in molecular"
biology
"so what we would like to have is"
"something we call the anatomical"
"compiler the idea is that someday you"
"should be able to sit down at a computer"
"and draw the animal or plant that you"
"would like to have so so not uh try to"
"create it a bottom up from a description"
"of pathways you shouldn't need to think"
"about pathways you should be able to"
"like we do for computer aided design if"
"the when the field is mature you should"
"be able to sit down and say i want a"
"three-headed flatworm with with with a"
"shape that roughly looks like this and"
"what the compiler would do is convert"
"that anatomical description"
"into the set of stimuli that have to be"
"given to those cells to produce whatever"
"it is that you asked for okay that's the"
"end game for this field it's complete"
"and total control of morphology and it"
"might be a liver and it might be a heart"
"and it might be a whole of"
"organism or it might be something that's"
"never existed on earth before it"
"shouldn't matter we should be able to to"
"take a description of the the ana the"
"anatomy that we want and to to"
"figure out what uh stimuli would have to"
"be given to cells to be able to produce"
"it and the critical thing is that if we"
"could do this we would immediately have"
"all the answers to birth defects to"
"regenerating lost or damaged organs to"
"the defection from the body plan known"
"as cancer to aging to all of these uh"
"challenges to the normal healthy"
"morphology of a body"
"and so this is fundamentally a problem"
"of information processing as i will i"
"will argue and so the question is why"
"don't we have this yet you know"
"genomics has proceeded very rapidly why"
"do we not have this because of course we"
"don't have anything remotely like this"
"our control over anatomy is still"
"extremely poor"
"and so"
"uh the reason is is because there are"
"fundamental um gaps in our understanding"
"and i'll just give you a very simple"
"example so here on the left you see an"
axolotl
and
"axolotl larvae have legs and on the"
"right you see a frog larva and frog"
"larvae do not have legs so tadpoles"
"don't have legs and one can do a thought"
"experiment and say that while i'm going"
"to at the early embryonic stage i'm"
"going to take 50 percent of the axolotl"
"embryo 50 of the frog embryo i'm going"
"to mix them up and i'm going to make a"
"frog a lottle okay and it turns out the"
"cells do perfectly fine they actually do"
"do work together"
"but now now i ask you a simple question"
"will the frogalado have legs"
"you have access to both genomes you have"
"access to the axolotl genome you have"
"access to the frog genome will the"
"frogalot will have legs and if so will"
"the legs be made entirely of axolotl"
"cells or will they recruit the frog"
"cells the point is we have no idea and"
uh
"until we do the experiment of course"
"right so so even having the genomic"
sequence
"these basic fundamental questions about"
"what shape is going to result are"
"something that we cannot yet answer and"
"that really holds back regenerative"
medicine
"and so let's just let's just ask the"
"fundamental question where does shape"
"come from and so uh we all start life as"
"this uh sort of ball of embryonic"
"blastomeres and then here you see a"
"cross section through the human torso"
"also look at this incredible"
"arrangement all the organs are in"
"exactly the right place"
"orientation size position relative to"
"each other where does all this come from"
"and if you're if you know you might be"
"tempted to say the genome and so the"
"genome certainly produces the cellular"
"hardware that you need to create this so"
"the genome gives you all the protein"
"sequences but the genome doesn't"
"directly say anything about this this"
"kind of order it's a"
"it's it's simply it's simply not there"
"in in that in that way and so we really"
"need to understand how do cell groups"
"know what to make and when to stop right"
"it's a it's a collective it's a it's um"
"a collective intelligence problem in the"
"sense that all of these cells are active"
"agents that do various things and the"
"result of their activity is to"
"self-assemble this amazing organism and"
"as part of understanding this process we"
"need to ask first of all in regenerative"
"medicine if part of this is missing how"
"do we convince the cells to rebuild it"
"again and as engineers we might ask well"
"what else could we build could we build"
"something completely different out of"
"these same cells and so this this"
"central question of what"
"where anatomical order comes from and"
"how do we control it is the key i think"
"to really uh really profound changes in"
"in how we do medicine so"
"the important thing is that single cells"
"are incredibly competent so here you"
"have this this uh creature is called the"
lacrimarian
"and uh you can see what it's doing it uh"
"it's hunting it handles all of its"
"physiological its anatomical and it's"
"behavioral needs all in one cell there"
"is no brain there's no nervous system"
"there are no stem cells there's no cell"
"to cell communication it's one cell and"
"it's doing and it's doing everything it"
"needs on the scale of one cell now when"
"cells get when when cells get together"
they
"actually scale up this this ability"
"and they work on much bigger goals and"
"these goals are the production of"
"complex invariant anatomy such as such"
"as these here and we know that simply uh"
"differentiating stem cells into"
"particular tissue types is not"
"sufficient because then you can get"
"something like this down here which is a"
"teratoma so this is a tumor that might"
"have skin and hair and teeth and bone"
"and muscle and the reason this is not a"
"good embryo is uh because it's missing"
"that that three-dimensional uh"
"organization that structure all the stem"
"cell differentiation proceeded fine"
"you've got your you've got your cell"
"types you've got your mature derivatives"
"but they're not arranged in the correct"
"place so it's not enough to have the"
"building blocks you actually need to"
"specify how they get together"
"and so there's this uh there's there's a"
"kind of a mainstream paradigm which"
"thinks about a feed feed-forward"
"emergent process where you have gene"
"regulatory networks and these genes turn"
"each other on and off they make proteins"
"some of these proteins are sticky or"
"they exert force or they diffuse and so"
"on and as a result there's this process"
"what they call emergence and at the end"
"something uh something really complex"
"comes out and the difficulty with this"
"paradigm for regenerative medicine is"
"that if you want to make changes here if"
"you want to make repairs to the anatomy"
"you have to somehow invert"
"this this this chain to figure out what"
"are you going to do back here which"
"genes are you going to edit and how in"
"order to make complex anatomical changes"
"and that inverse problem is is"
"fundamentally intractable it's extremely"
"difficult and so"
"this is this is basically what's holding"
"back regenerative medicine we simply"
"don't know how to figure out what"
"changes to make at the very lowest"
"levels to give you the desired uh"
"effects at this at the system level and"
"so what we're very good at in the field"
"is figuring out things like this which"
"genes and proteins"
"control each other and so on these"
"pathways what we really want to"
"understand is this where do these"
"different shapes come from and what do"
"we do when uh when we want to alter them"
"rationally um"
okay
"so um uh i should i should point out"
"that it's not only about"
"creating a complex body during"
"embryogenesis it's also about the"
"amazing ability of the cellular"
"collectives to repair over time so here"
"what you see here is"
"an animal called an axolotl so this is a"
"mexican salamander"
"these animals throughout their lifespan"
"regenerate their eyes their limbs their"
"ovaries portions of their heart and"
"brain and their spinal cords so they"
"will um sort of bite off each other's"
"legs all the time and you know if you"
"keep them in an aquarium and the legs"
"grow back and so here's what what what"
"happens no matter where you where you"
"amputate or where they lose it along"
"this axis they will do exactly the"
"correct amount of growth and patterning"
"and then you have an indistinguishable"
"limb at the end and so"
"uh what's what's remarkable about this"
"is not only that uh it it"
"rapidly um"
"and and creates the correct"
"tissues that actually stops"
"at the right time the fact that"
"regeneration stops is really amazing"
"think about it when does it stop it"
"stops when a correct salamander limb has"
"formed and until then it has really"
"rapid proliferation and and and cell"
"movement and then changes in gene"
"expression but all of that grinds to a"
"halt when a correct salamander limb has"
"formed how does it know what a correct"
"salamander limit is how does it know"
"when to stop because this is not simply"
"a process that always starts at the egg"
"proceeds during a set of hardwired steps"
"and then stops this is a flexible"
"process that you can interrupt you can"
"make changes you can cut at any point"
"and it will pick up exactly at the right"
"spot do what's needed and then stop when"
"it's done so there's a there's a degree"
"of um plasticity and adaptive um"
"problem solving here so uh uh of course"
um
"axolotls are not the only creatures that"
"regenerate so the human liver is"
"regenerative and even the ancient greeks"
"knew that i don't know how they knew"
"that but they did as you see here"
"deer are a large adult mammal that every"
"year regenerates uh huge amounts of bone"
"and skin and innervation and vasculature"
"these these antlers grow up to a rate of"
"a centimeter and a half per day think"
"about that a centimeter and a half of"
"new bone per day is possible in mammals"
"and even human children uh usually below"
"the age of somewhere between 7 and 11 if"
"they amputate their fingertips if you"
"don't sew it over with skin but just"
"sort of keep it clean they will"
"regenerate so even human children"
"initially have some some regenerative"
"ability to regenerate their uh their"
"their their fingers and then and then it"
"goes away"
"okay so these here uh are i think the"
"champions of regeneration and this this"
"should be um a a really uh motivational"
"and uh sort of aspirational animal for"
"us all who are interested in uh healthy"
"lifespans this is a planarian these"
"animals have a couple of interesting"
"properties first of all they're a"
"complex animal with a true brain and"
"bilateral symmetry they're not like"
"earthworms these these are similar to"
our
"direct ancestor okay they first of all"
"have the ability of regeneration so you"
"can cut them into any pieces uh along"
"any along any plane the record is"
"something like 276 pieces"
"every piece will regenerate exactly"
"what's missing no more no less and give"
"you a perfect tiny little worm every"
"piece they regenerate their brain every"
"other organ not only that they're smart"
"so they can learn they have the ability"
"to learn in a variety of behavioral"
"assays and best of all they are immortal"
"there is no such thing as an old"
"planarian so"
"individual cells senesce and fall off"
"and they regenerate whatever's missing"
"and they just keep on going and so what"
"these guys are telling us is that it is"
"possible to be an immortal uh highly"
"regenerative uh creature that also has"
"intelligence this is not only for you"
"know sea anemones and things like this"
"you can actually be a bilaterian with a"
"true brain all the same"
"neurotransmitters that we have"
"and the immortal okay so so this is uh"
"this is a proof of uh proof of principle"
"right here an existence fruit"
"so um"
"one of the really important concepts to"
"try and understand how all this works is"
really
"the idea of uh problem solving by the"
"collective intelligence of cells and i"
"want to show you just one example there"
"are many examples i want to show you one"
example
"here is a tadpole face and here's some"
"eyes and the brain and the nostrils and"
"tapples need to become frogs and in"
"order to become frogs they rearrange"
"their face so the nostrils have to move"
"the eyes have to move forward the jaws"
"have to move all these things have to"
"move around and it used to be thought"
"that somehow what the genetics does is"
"it gives you"
a
"a hard-wired set of movements after all"
"all tackles of the same and all frogs"
"look the same so as long as"
"everything moves in the right way you"
"should get from a normal tackle to a"
"normal front so what we did was we made"
"so-called picasso tackles where"
"everything is in the wrong place so the"
"eyes are off kilter um the nose is not"
"where it's supposed to be the jaws are"
"on the side of the head everything's"
"yeah everything's not where it's"
"supposed to be so"
"when this happens uh what we find is"
"that they still make largely normal"
"frogs why because all of the different"
"uh components move around in novel paths"
"okay and in fact sometimes they go too"
"far and have to back up and come back"
"but they all move around until they get"
"pretty much to a normal frog phase this"
"is remarkable this means that what the"
"gen x actually gives you"
"is a machine that is able to minimize"
"error that it has some internal"
"representation of what a correct frog"
"face looks like and when you start it"
"off in a in the wrong configuration"
"something that never"
"appears during normal embryogenesis uh"
"no problem they can still navigate more"
"of space they can navigate a path to"
"where they need to be"
"from this completely unexpected starting"
"position so this if we if we had a swarm"
"robotics uh instance that was able to do"
"this you know instead of cells we had"
"little robots that could do this this"
"would be a you know"
"a remarkable example of collective"
"intelligence and so it is here these are"
"groups of cells that are able to solve"
"this problem from different starting"
"configurations and this is the process"
"that that collective intelligence and"
"that problem solving is what we need to"
"solve in addition to all of the"
"mechanistic advances over the the"
"component pathways in order to uh really"
"control um anatomy and to really solve"
"regenerative medicine"
"so what we would like to do is to uh try"
to
"move to a point where we really"
"understand this at an algorithmic level"
"not just the mechanisms that are"
"required for this to happen but the"
"algorithms that are sufficient for this"
"to happen and we really need to"
"understand how these cellular"
"collectives process information and how"
"reprogrammable really is it so"
"computer science offers us an"
"interesting uh"
"an interesting analogy"
"back in the 1940s and 50s this is what"
"programming looked like so in order to"
"program this computer you had to"
"physically move the wires around you had"
"to uh you had to you had to physically"
"change the structure of the machine and"
"since then what the um the journey that"
"computer science has taken is to realize"
"that if your hardware is good enough if"
"it's reprogrammable then you don't need"
"to physically change the hardware what"
"you can do is interact with it by means"
"of inputs or experiences and take"
"advantage of the software that's in the"
"system and the plasticity that's in the"
"system okay so of course um what you'll"
"what you'll notice that all of modern"
"biology is basically down here at this"
"point we are um all of the exciting"
"advances are single molecule uh"
"approaches you know we're rewiring"
"pathways genomic editing um everything"
"is about getting getting more and more"
"specific at the at the low level of the"
"hardware and these are very important"
things
"but um they need to be coupled with an"
"understanding of what the software looks"
"like and how much we can get done with"
"stimuli not with rewiring whether it be"
"genetic or or otherwise"
"and so the framework that we work in"
"looks a little bit more like this where"
"uh yes there's this feed forward"
"component but there's also a very"
important
"set of feedback loops where any"
"challenge to the body and this could be"
"traumatic injury this could be aging"
"this could be keratogens pathogens"
whatever
"triggers a set of feedback loops both at"
"the level of physics and genetics that"
"serves to get back to the correct target"
"morphology um anybody that's taken"
"engineering will immediately recognize"
"this as a homeostatic cycle it's"
"basically what you have in your in your"
"thermostat at home where"
"uh this is a system that's able to"
"regulate back to the correct state now"
um
"the the of course if feedback is is is"
"not uh is not new biology biologists all"
"understand about"
"the importance of feedback but there are"
"two unusual things here in this model"
"that i'm going to talk about the first"
"is that the set point for this"
"homeostatic process is not a simple"
"number or a scalar like a temperature or"
"ph or hunger level or anything like that"
"it's actually a much more complex"
"structure that's a coarse graining of"
"the anatomy so so large scale patterning"
"information is what's being is what's"
"guiding this homeostatic process and the"
"second part that's kind of unusual is"
"that this is a process that has a goal"
"in the in the when i say goal this is"
"not in some"
"some mystical sense it's it's basically"
"in the uh cyber in the sense of"
"cybernetics and control theory there's a"
"set point and this is a system that's"
"fundamentally able to expend energy and"
"effort to get back to the correct region"
"of state space by uh by by activating um"
"all kinds of cellular behaviors to get"
"back as close as possible to minimize"
"error and minimize the difference"
"between whatever the current shape is"
"and the shape that it's supposed to have"
"so if you make that hypothesis it has a"
"couple of strong predictions"
"one strong prediction is that uh you"
"ought to be able to find the medium in"
"which that target morphology is encoded"
"so the setpoint has to be recorded"
"somewhere and then it means that you"
"could alter that set point you could"
"rewrite it and ask the machine to build"
"something different"
"without having to rewire it right in the"
"same way that you can set your"
"thermostat to a different um a different"
"temperature and the exact same system"
"will now maintain a different"
"temperature because there's a"
"distinction between the data and the"
"execution here so this is what we've"
"been doing in my group for some years"
"now is saying can we find the"
"representation of the target morphology"
"and exploit it for regenerative medicine"
"and i think we found an important um"
"chunk of it and so"
"in order to tell you um how that target"
"morphology is encoded i have to"
"introduce you to developmental"
bioelectricity
"and uh"
"all cells in the body are sitting in a"
"morphogenetic field of information that"
"comes in all kinds of uh different media"
"so there's chemical gradients"
"extracellular matrix tensions and"
"stresses and so on and uh and and then"
"the one that we're interested in is"
"bioelectricity so bioelectricity is not"
"the only important layer but it's a it's"
"a i think a uniquely powerful and"
"interesting one and that's the one we'll"
"be talking about now"
"okay so what is bioelectricity well"
"let's think about what happens in the"
"brain in the brain uh"
"you have networks of these cells called"
"neurons they all have ion channels they"
"create voltage potentials by passing"
"ions in and out of these ion channels"
"and they can pass those electrical"
"states to their neighbors through these"
"little electrical synapses the synapse"
"is known as gap junctions"
"and networks of these cells have this"
"really interesting property that they"
"can execute uh physiological um"
"information processing that we associate"
"with memory with behavior with goal"
"directed activity with preferences and"
"so on and so what you can see here is an"
"example of um tracking electrical"
"activity in the brain so this happens to"
"be a zebrafish thinking about whatever"
"zebrafish think about and you can"
"literally see the the electrical"
"activity and neuroscience has the"
"following commitment we think that"
"if we understood the encoding if we"
"understood the neural electric code we"
"could look at this electrical activity"
"and extract the semantic information we"
"would know what is"
"what is the meaning to to the animal"
"what is the"
"the content of that of that memory of"
"whatever it's thinking about okay and so"
"people are working on and have had some"
"success with all kinds of uh decoding"
"methods to try and pull that information"
"out of the electrical activity in the"
"brain well you can sort of ask yourself"
"where did this all come from certainly"
"this didn't just"
"evolve out of nowhere it must have had a"
"simpler um evolutionary precursor and it"
"did the evolutionary precursor is the"
"fact that all cells do this not just"
"neurons so every cell has ion channels"
"most cells have gap junctions to their"
"neighbors and this um"
"this this kind of scheme of putting"
"electrically active"
"subunits into networks is about as old"
"as bacterial biofilms it's an extremely"
"ancient evolutionary thing and all cells"
"do this and so what you're seeing here"
"is an early frog embryo"
"in time lapse where the cells are having"
"discussions with each other electrically"
"about who's going to be anterior"
"posterior left right dorsidental and so"
on
"because whereas the"
"electrical activity in the brain is"
"designed to move to activate muscles to"
"move the body to solve problems in"
"three-dimensional space"
"what developmental bioelectricity does"
"is process information to move the body"
"through morphospace to change and"
control
"morphogenesis and we can do this the"
"exact same thing here we can we can we"
"can try to decode this to try to"
"understand how is it that"
"specific patterns arise and how can we"
"change them okay"
"so we've developed"
"my lab has developed some tools to do"
"this so uh first the"
"here are voltage-sensitive fluorescent"
"dyes and this is uh my colleague danny"
"adams perfected this particular"
"technique of using voltage reporters so"
"this is not a model this is an actual um"
"an actual embryo using these voltage"
"dies to to to read in real time all the"
"electrical conversations that these"
"cells are having we of course do lots of"
"computational modeling and then more"
"importantly we have functional"
"techniques where you can go in and"
"change the electrical information"
"processing in the tissue we do not use"
"electrodes applied electric fields"
"there's no electromagnetics going on"
"this is purely molecular physiology to"
"target the native"
"um processes by which these cells are"
"communicating electrically so"
"there are uh there are ways to control"
"um the the topology of the network so"
"which cells talk to each other cells"
"through these gap junctions and we can"
"open them we can close them we can"
"mutate them and so on and the same thing"
"for the ion channels we can go in and"
"literally uh set the electrical states"
"using either optogenetics or drugs or"
"mutations that change the channel"
"properties okay so so exactly so"
"basically taking all the tools of"
"neuroscience and uh using them to"
"control morphogenetic decision-making"
"outside of the outside of the nervous"
"system and so this is um this is just a"
"simple example of what some of these"
"endogenous patterns look like here you"
"see again a time lapse this this embryo"
"is putting its"
"tadpoles face together you can see all"
"the dynamic electrical patterns here's"
"one frame from that movie and the"
"amazing thing is and the reason i love"
"this example so much is that the"
"encoding is really simple here the"
"electric we call this the electric face"
"the bioelectric pattern of the face"
"actually looks like a face and this"
"shows up before the genes are turned on"
"uh to um"
"to to regionalize the face and so here"
"you can see here's where the eye is"
"going to be here the placards use where"
"the mouth is going to be all these"
"bioelectrical gradients are a"
"pre-pattern they're a subtle scaffold"
"that directs downstream gene expression"
"and anatomy and if we go in and we"
"change these uh the distribution of"
"voltages here you will change the gene"
"expression and you will change the"
"anatomy that is one way to make those"
"picasso tadpoles that i showed you about"
so
"um the so so this is a native pattern"
"that is required it's a normal natural"
"part of"
"specifying what the tackle face is going"
"to look like there's a pathological"
"pattern what we've done here is oops"
"what we've done here is inject"
"a human oncogene into the sample they"
"will make tumors like this"
"but before they do you can already see"
"using this this bioelectric map you can"
"already see that these cells have a have"
"a really aberrant electrical potential"
"they are dissociating from the"
"electrical network they're basically"
"reverting back to their unicellular"
"state and they're going to treat the"
"rest of the animal as just external"
"environment they've unplugged from the"
"collective and this is metastasis this"
"is just um this is this is failure to"
"participate in embryogenesis because the"
"first thing that oncogenes do is uh"
"uncouple you from the um from the"
"electric network that normally tells"
"every cell what it should be doing okay"
"so um the reason we know this is"
"important is that if you then so you"
"inject tumors like nasty chaoras"
"mutations and so on if you inject these"
"things and cause tumors you can prevent"
"the actual tumorogenesis even though the"
"oncogene is very strongly expressed so"
"here this is the same animal right so"
"here's the oncogene that we've labeled"
"it with with red very strongly expressed"
"and yet um there's no tumor because what"
"we've done is co-inject an ion channel"
"that forces these cells into a voltage"
"state that keeps them coupled to the"
"rest of the electrical network and they"
"they simply don't progress to um to to"
"to tumor genesis or metastasis so we"
"know it's we know this is instructive"
now
"going beyond the single cell property of"
"of you know conversion to to cancer we"
"could look at morphogenesis and we can"
"say okay here's a tadpole let's take a"
"region of the gut so here these are some"
"cells in the embryo that are going to"
"become gut and we're going to inject"
"some ion channels that uh will set a"
"voltage state that normally is"
"associated with making an eye and guess"
"what happens these cells once you"
"instruct them that way they will in fact"
"build an eye out of cells that were"
"faded to the gut and you can make these"
"eyes anywhere on the tail spinal cord in"
"the gut whatever they have all the"
"correct layers the retina optic nerve"
"all of that and also pretty cool is that"
"they instruct their neighbors so these"
"blue cells here are the ones whose"
"voltage we changed and they they"
"recruited a whole bunch of other cells"
"which we never touched directly right"
"these are just neighboring cells that"
"they recruit to make this nice lens"
"that's sitting out in the tail of this"
"uh of this tadpole"
"and so we can use these this this"
"technique we can induce eyes brains um"
"hearts and uh and and other things and"
"then there's many things that we can't"
"we don't know how to make it so the"
"point is that these bioelectrical"
"gradients are instructive for anatomy"
"they control at the large scale and and"
"one of the"
"most important features of this is that"
"we don't have to micromanage this"
"process so"
"the what we basically found is is is an"
"instructive hook into sub routines that"
"say make an eye here or make a heart"
"here or make a brain here we don't have"
"to go in and give all the information"
"about well how do you make an eye what"
"are all the layers or all the cell"
"differentiation cascades what all the"
"genes that have to be expressed that"
"would be incredibly difficult we're"
"nowhere near being able to do that as a"
field
"but what you can do is find the native"
"uh modular um"
"modular control structure in the uh in"
"the in the bioelectric layer that"
"determines which organs get placed in"
"what regions and then the cells will"
"will take it from there once you've"
"instructed them what what to do they"
"will they will turn on all the all the"
"things they need"
"so so let's let's look at the planaria"
"because this is really this is really"
"interesting in a planarian you chop off"
"the head and the tail you got this"
"middle fragment the middle fragment um"
"has to know to build a new head here and"
"a new tail here how does it know to do"
"that well it has this interesting"
"voltage gradient that says one head here"
"in this depolarized region one tail here"
"and if we go in and we artificially"
"manipulate the voltage back here to be"
"depolarized then sure enough these cells"
"will build what you said and they will"
"make a two-headed animal and these are"
"perfectly viable so you can make a"
"two-headed animal you can make a"
"no-headed animal okay so again"
"instructive and all we've done is"
"activate the build ahead subroutine and"
"we've done it here at this particular"
"region without actually knowing too much"
"about how you go about building a head"
"in the first place the cells will will"
"turn on and off all the genes that they"
"need once they've received this high"
"level uh instruction about what organ"
"they're supposed to build not only can"
"you build ectopic heads of the same"
"animal you can actually build heads"
"appropriate to other species okay so if"
"we do this we take this planarian with a"
"nice triangular head here chop off the"
"head perturb the electrical network and"
"you can get uh flatheads like a pifilina"
"you can get round heads like an s"
"mediterranean or you can get your normal"
"triangular heads and this is because not"
"only do you get the head shape but"
"actually the brain shape uh changes in"
"the distribution of stem cells becomes"
"just like these other species because"
"the space of possible outcomes of this"
"electrical circuit contains attractors"
"that correspond to other other species"
"that evolution has found in the past"
"okay and you can dial in those without"
"any changes to the genomics so both in"
"here and then the two-headed animals i"
"showed you there's nothing wrong with"
"the genome the genetics are completely"
"wild-type this is modifying the"
"information stored in the electrical"
"network and you can access other"
"attractors that belong to other species"
"with the exact same genetically normal"
"cells and in fact you can access regions"
"of that state space that evolution"
"doesn't use because they're not viable"
"you can take flat planaria and turn them"
"into these weird spiky forms you can"
"make these um"
"three-dimensional uh things that look"
"like hats uh you can make this um this"
"kind of thing which are sort of"
"combinations so flatworms don't even"
"need to be flat anymore and so the idea"
"here is that uh you can really have"
"drastic control over large scale anatomy"
"given the same genome because what the"
"genome builds is um"
"cellular collectives that use"
"electricity to uh store their their uh"
"set points their their target"
"morphologies and this sounds it should"
"sound like a very familiar story for uh"
"for neuroscientists because that's"
"exactly how how brains work so"
"um getting to the uh sort of applied uh"
"regenerative medicine side of this"
"unlike salamanders frogs do not"
"regenerate their legs"
"and um what we've done is we've taken"
"froglets and we've designed we've used"
"this information to design a cocktail of"
"of drugs that changed the electrical"
"state of the wound and you can see here"
"normally in the frog you amputate the"
"leg and there's basically nothing on 45"
"days you um we add the cocktail the the"
the
"applications actually just for 48 hours"
of
"sorry 24 hours so one day and after that"
"one day exposure it kick-starts the"
"whole cascade so here pro-regenerative"
"genes become turned on so this is msx1"
"and then immediately you start growing"
"this leg"
"by 45 days later you've got some toes"
"you've got a toenail eventually a very"
"nice leg and you can see that the leg is"
"both touch sensitive and motile so what"
"you can do is override the normal"
"program of growth which is normally very"
"little and and uh give give the whole"
"thing of a simple signal over um 24"
"hours that then is is picked up by all"
"the transcriptional cascades and"
"everything else that will work over"
"months in fact our latest paper 13"
"months of leg growth following one day"
"um one day treatment"
"okay and so so we you know we've looked"
"at this in as these are frogs and worms"
"we've looked at this in human"
"mesenchymal stem cells and"
"cardiomyocytes and so on and it it's"
"it's very highly conserved um it works"
"uh throughout the tree of life um we"
"know it's relevant to humans because of"
"human channelopathies so lots of human"
"ion channel mutations give rise to um"
"different kinds of birth defects telling"
"us that even in even in humans these"
"electrical um properties are very"
"important for setting correct correct"
"morphologies and so what we do now and"
"so this is this is our company with uh"
"david kaplan the tufts"
"we we have a company that's focused on"
uh
"david's lab builds these bioreactors"
"which basically deliver um uh uh"
"cocktails of ion channel drugs that are"
"that are picked by us to"
"induce pro-regenerative states and we"
"are now having more or less salted in"
"frog we are now in um in mammals we're"
"doing this in mice and then hopefully um"
"someday hopefully humans of course"
"so um just to you know start wrapping up"
"here uh the point of all of this is that"
"we now are starting to understand the"
"circuits to the point where we can make"
"multi-scale models so we start with"
"knowing what genes are there to produce"
"various types of ion channels but these"
"ion channels open and close so simply"
"knowing the genes doesn't tell you what"
"the electrical states are going to be"
"you have to simulate the physiological"
"tissues and those give rise to larger"
"organ structures and eventually you can"
"get down to algorithmic types of control"
"that show you how the electrical"
"activity in these tissues makes"
"decisions about what's going to go where"
"so you go from the genomically specified"
"hardware to the low level and then the"
"higher level software that allows these"
"cells to uh to make the kinds of"
"decisions to robustly create and repair"
"complex morphologies okay and so in that"
"process of course um there's a there's a"
"huge um"
"opportunity for application machine"
"learning and so we've done some of this"
"use machine learning to both discover"
"the electrical circuits and to discover"
"the modulations that are needed to to uh"
"to use these therapeutically and just as"
"a very simple i'll just close up here"
"with a couple of slides to show you a"
"very simple example this is um this is"
"what a normal tadpole brain looks like"
"and if you perturb it with a mutation"
"let's say in a really important gene"
"like notch which basically the forebrain"
"is gone the midbrain is a bubble um"
"behind brain is you know it's also a"
"bubble just they have no behavior this"
"lay there and what you can do is uh"
"create a model of the bioelectric"
"circuit that determines uh brain shape"
"and ask it in under circumstances like"
"this that either there's a mutation or"
"they've been hit by out with alcohol or"
"nicotine or some other kind of poison"
"what what would you have to change which"
"channels would you open and close to get"
"back to this correct bioelectric pattern"
"that is responsible for a normal brain"
"and so the model is actually now"
"sufficiently detailed that it can"
"actually tell us what uh what channel is"
"and using that we can pick drugs so"
"known ion channel drugs and and uh can"
"be and when you do this you get back the"
"correct uh brain shape the correct brain"
"size um and you get their in good"
"behavior you get their iqs back so their"
"learning rates are back to normal"
"despite the fact that they've had um"
"really uh debilitating mutations or"
"exposure to teratogens like nicotine or"
"alcohol and so on"
"okay so this is an example of starting"
"off with a basic understanding of"
"bioelectric circuits and how they work"
"to a computational model that actually"
"helps you design therapeutics to to fix"
"a rather complex outcome which is which"
"is brain development okay and so what we"
"are doing now is we're creating a we're"
"trying to create a complete pipeline"
"where you start off with existing"
"information on what ion channels are in"
"your tissue of interest what"
"bioelectrical state do you want and then"
"use the model and the simulations to"
"tell you what channel openers and"
"blockers do you need something like 20"
"of all drugs are ion channel drugs so"
"there's this there's this huge tool kit"
"that we call electroceuticals"
"which with the correct um correct"
"computational um simulations you will"
"you can you can actually start to deploy"
"um outside of uh things like uh you know"
"cardiac arrhythmias and epilepsy is all"
"those drugs can be repurposed now for"
"for for regenerative medicine and so um"
"this is an example of our software you"
"can you can all um you can help play"
"with it"
"it's online and the idea is that you"
"would you would pick the tissues you"
"want and it would actually help you uh"
"help you pick the correct uh help you"
"pick the correct drugs okay"
"so um i'll just close here and uh just"
"summarize what i've what i told you is"
"that there's this incredibly powerful"
"physiological software layer that sits"
"between the genotype and the anatomy and"
"it's a really tractable target for"
"regenerative biomedicine evolution"
"discovered very early that electrical"
"signaling is a really convenient medium"
for
"computation and global decision making"
"and this is why brains exploit it this"
"is why our computer technology exploits"
"it and this is why morphogenesis runs on"
"the system cracking this code uh you can"
"really give us the opportunity to"
"rewrite the pattern memories that uh"
"allow us to control uh large scale shape"
"when i say pattern memories i mean these"
"are literally that tho those two-headed"
"worms that i showed you if you now cut"
"them into pieces with no more"
"manipulation of any kind they continue"
"to make two-headed animals even though"
"their genomes are wild-type okay this is"
um
"this is that memory it really that"
"electrical circuit really keeps the"
"memory and so you can set it back to"
"being one added but until you do that"
"the pieces will continue to make"
"two-headed worms okay and so new"
"artificial intelligence tools are now"
"coming online to help us design these"
"kind of strategies so it's now rational"
"design to address birth defects cancer"
"and regeneration and also our latest"
"work has been on making synthetic living"
organisms
so
"with that i'd like to thank the people"
"who contributed to all this work um"
"our our funders um and uh and i'll thank"
"um all of you for listening"
"and if we could take a five minute uh"
"break and then i'll come back and i'm"
"happy to answer any questions"
"wow that was a lot i think we do need a"
"break we will let you go for now and"
"have you back in five minutes thank you"
"so so much already and there's lots of"
"questions in the chat but i will"
"moderate them and we'll see you in a bit"
"perfect five minutes"
"okay sounds great okay lovely well that"
"was quite a lot to digest um"
"keep the questions coming and also"
"upload the ones that you want to push"
"forward he already agreed to that he can"
"stay on for half an hour up to half an"
"hour longer so for those of you who want"
"to learn more about this"
"feel free to join longer for now we have"
"lots of exciting community updates lots"
"of exciting projects and events and"
"fellowships and hackathons and so forth"
"in the community we will start with"
"elena elena if you're here for future"
"i'm mute and"
"and tell us about your upcoming"
conference
"yeah hello everyone uh very nice to see"
"a lot of useful developments in the"
"field and hear all those awesome talks"
"i'm actually a very big fan of this"
"group even though not always can i"
"attend anyways um i just wanted to let"
"you know that soon we are going to have"
"our fourth annual uh conference"
"and in adriatic diseases 2021 uh it's"
"going to take place virtually this year"
"again because we're not so sure that"
"it's safe for uh all of us together we"
"hope that it will change in the next"
"years of course so the conference is"
"going to take place on august 1922 uh"
and
"in the eastern time zone so we will"
"focus on the four traditional topics"
"which will be the mechanisms of aging uh"
"the human trials of rejuvenation"
"biotechnology therapies the biomarkers"
"of aging and of course traditionally"
"investment matters and regulatory"
matters
uh
"as usual we have a number of"
"prominent researchers giving their talks"
"some of the information is going to be"
"pretty fresh just from the lab so i hope"
"uh that you will have a look at the"
"program of the conference and probably"
"get inspired and come join us this year"
"for more information please visit our"
website
"lifespan.other conference"
"and as a way to"
"support this community"
"you are welcome to apply a promo code"
"for site 2021 to get a discount i will"
"drop a link"
"that will automatically apply a discount"
"in the chat of this call just in case"
"you would like to proceed right away"
"thank you so much lovely okay and next"
"one up we have anastasia anastasia are"
"you here"
"oh can you hear me"
"yes wow lovely background"
"oh thank you it's idaho um yeah"
"thanks alison and uh great to meet you"
"all on this"
regular
"meetings that are really great and"
"import informative um"
"some of you might know me and uh so i"
"work with ranjan um rajon is the founder"
"of r42 group we are a fund and also"
"investing in the ai and longevity and"
"also an institute uh part of our"
institute
"that we have is a fellowship so it's a"
"fellowship and we're now in our cohort"
four
"and uh our demo day is actually tomorrow"
"between 8 a.m to 12 p.m noon pacific"
"some really great projects"
"uh students from all over the world were"
"working on these projects over the"
"12-week period so"
"they include"
"mathematics of venture capital no code"
"machine learning platform for biomedical"
"researchers um cancer biology um just"
"kind of a wide range of really exciting"
"projects so you're all welcome to come"
"and i'll send you the schedule and also"
"the registration link in the chat as"
"well as yeah feel free to pop in and out"
"and come for all our new presentations"
"so yeah great"
"and uh yeah thank you"
"here he might add a few words"
"let us know in case you want to do so"
"wonder and otherwise we look forward to"
"it yes that's okay it's free i'll just"
"add it's free so"
"and we're going to have the"
"first holographic telephone call"
"tomorrow between england and uh silicon"
"valley so that'll be around about 11am"
pacific
"exciting stuff you're taking the ai"
"theme very meta okay lovely next one up"
"we have dima"
"yeah hi everyone um so we're organizing"
"a longevity hackathon so it's a 48-hour"
event
to
"bring the ideas to fruition in longevity"
"and the idea is to bring together"
"longevity researchers developers um ai"
"scientists entrepreneurs"
"attract people from outside the field as"
"well help them build teams and"
"tackle the kind of like long hanging"
"fruits that you can actually where you"
"can actually produce innovation over"
"just 48 hours so there's topics from"
"biotech ai pharma"
"we already have um people from all"
"continents except perhaps like"
"antarctica and australia"
"but like there's people joining from all"
"over the world um there's um longevity"
"tech funds uh will invest a hundred k"
"into uh the winning teams uh so i'm also"
"confident that this will you know"
"continue afterwards and then foresight"
"institute is also supporting with the"
"fellowship for 2022. uh so yeah uh"
"please um join we're still looking for"
"sponsors mentors uh feel free to reach"
"out and i'm gonna drop it and chat as"
"well on the information about it"
"thank you okay i have one more to go"
"which is the aging research and drug"
"development conference in copenhagen on"
"august 31st to september 3rd i'll drop a"
"link to that and as you can tell there's"
"lots of exciting stuff happening nathan"
"i think is on the"
"journey fellowship i reached out to you"
"earlier if you want to say something"
"feel free to do so now or in the chat"
"otherwise i think we have michael back"
"okay michael are you back i'm back okay"
"lovely um okay great uh i think um"
"let's see let's let's do maybe a few"
"questions on the record and if anyone"
"prefers to have theirs of the record"
"then i'll turn the recording off for"
"that i think some people i just prefer"
"that for a more open discussion but the"
"first one that got uploaded a bunch is"
"called call us i think three questions"
"so you can make your pick now no"
"pressure on you this is totally good"
"these are good questions to be on the"
"record because um well i mean first of"
"all just let me say kudos this is very"
"awesome thank you sounding stuff and"
"kind of blows me away a little bit um so"
"so before getting into you know aging"
"and regenerative medicine even just this"
"just more basic back you know i have"
"loads of more basic background questions"
"about these bioelectric networks so the"
"meta question in you know i'll just give"
"two example questions the meta question"
"you know that the myriad of questions is"
"um raises is what's the best"
"modern review or textbook that"
"introduces all those people who don't"
"know anything about these bioelectric"
"networks to that but so the two example"
"questions i had right away were um what"
"is the down you know what is within a"
"cell what is the pathway for these um"
"for this bioelectrics to actually"
"um control gene expression right so we"
"uh so what what is what's going on in"
"the cell that way how does it work"
"epigenetically and um and then the other"
"question i wrote was"
um
"in non-regenerative species after"
development
"what do these bioelectric networks do"
"with anything yep yeah great um okay"
"three three questions let's see uh as"
"far as um reviews so so i i have lots um"
"i i've written lots um a couple of other"
"people have written some good ones"
"anybody who's interested please email me"
"um or if you guys have some sort of you"
"know a forum that i can post this at i"
"will i will post tell allison later out"
"offline she can florida sure yep i will"
"yeah there are yeah we've we've written"
"tons of very basic reviews on this stuff"
"taking you from zero all the way to"
"what's known today okay"
"the second question is uh transduction"
"to gene expression so"
"on the"
"single uh on the single"
"cell level we know there are about half"
"a dozen ways in which voltage change"
"regulates downstream gene expression so"
"this includes things that you're"
"familiar with the neuroscience for"
"example voltage-gated calcium signals"
"followed by calcium transduction this"
includes
"control of neurotransmitter movement"
"like serotonin between cells through gap"
"junctions or through the serotonin"
"transporter and this includes some more"
"exotic things like voltage-sensitive"
"phosphatases it includes things like"
"voltage-gated butyrate transporters that"
"then hit hdac and and those kind of"
"you know chromatin modification pathways"
"all of that is known i i should i should"
"say though that uh it's it's um highly"
um
"unsatisfying because what that i mean"
"it's good information it's good to have"
"that the problem is all of that is"
"single cell level data and if you know"
"if you want to know why your hand"
"doesn't look like your foot it's good to"
"know the transduction on a single cell"
"level but you still have to ask about uh"
"global dynamics that determine the size"
"and the shape and the scaling it's not"
"enough to know what the transduction"
"looks like on the single cell"
"i mean what's the third oh what's it"
"doing in adults i think what it's doing"
"in adults is"
"morphostasis so it's keeping you"
"together against individual cell"
"senescence and turnover so so usually"
"what it's uh and and by the way the"
"interface between bioelectricity and"
"aging is not well understood at all no"
"one has studied it right we haven't even"
"touched it so so it's not as if we know"
"what the answer is but but basically i"
"think probably what it's doing is it's"
"just uh cancer suppression and"
"morphostasis and keeping your tissues"
"together and it's really activating"
"those very dynamic um morphogenetic"
"rearrangement modules that is needed to"
"really sort of rejuvenate and restore"
"after injury"
"are you satisfied okay lovely glad you"
"snuck three questions and call okay next"
"one up we have ronald"
"we do okay"
um
"fascinating stuff so what is the what"
"controls the appearance of these"
"electrical zones"
"what determines their dispersal"
"as well right"
"yep so uh there's two there's two uh two"
"important pieces to this one important"
"piece is what underlies the hardware"
"itself and so you have to ask in order"
"to have any kind of electrical uh states"
"you have to have the the correct ion"
"channels that are capable of producing"
"them so one thing that uh that you need"
"to understand is what channels are there"
"and what are their properties so for"
"example they might themselves be voltage"
"sensitive or they might be ph gated or"
"whatever and this controls um"
"the properties of of these channels are"
"the excitable medium on which"
"these um these electrical"
"these electrical phenomena propagate now"
"the specific the specific patterns let's"
"say that electric face pattern"
"is uh it's an emergent pattern in the"
"same way that touring patterns emerge"
"from uh from a chem from an excitable"
"chemical medium or the way that um you"
"know when i when we talk about this with"
"my students i i start off and i say"
"visualize you have a collection of"
"electric parts that that make a um a"
"calculator and when you turn it on it"
"has a default behavior right that that"
"the the parts were chosen so that when a"
"juice is turned on and the thing is is"
"running it will by default start off at"
"a uh at a at a"
"consistent baseline emergency state"
"which is zero now past that it has"
"interesting properties of"
"reprogrammability and"
"all kinds of other things it can do but"
"there's this there's this basic state"
"that that the parts which are shaped by"
"evolution um uh there's a there's an"
"emergent pattern and we can study that"
"symmetry breaking so it's a process of"
"symmetry breaking of amplification of"
"long-range inhibition short-range"
"activation that sets up you know it sets"
"up exactly two eye spots at a particular"
"distance apart all of these things can"
"be can be modeled"
"are you satisfied i don't know yes okay"
great
"lovely great next one up we have josh"
"hey um thanks again for the talk that"
"was like super interesting"
"my question was for the worms to put"
"planaria is how you pronounce it"
"um if you chop you mentioned that they"
"could have like learned behaviors"
"i was curious if like the worms chopped"
"up multiple pieces if once those pieces"
"grow if all the pieces retain those"
"learned behaviors of like the original"
"worm yeah that's a great question um"
"it's uh it was addressed first in the"
"60s by a guy named mcconnell and he"
published
"his observations that in fact they do so"
"you can take a worm and you can train on"
"a particular task chop off the tail"
"raise a new worm from that tail so we in"
"in 2013 we reproduced all his that"
"aspect of his work he did other stuff"
"but that's what we reproduced and it's"
"true they do so what that's telling you"
"is that uh even learned"
"sort of behavioral information not just"
"morphological information is stored uh"
"outside the brain that you know in some"
"form and is able to be imprinted on the"
"new brain as it forms it's pretty"
"remarkable because that tail doesn't do"
"anything until the new brain forms right"
"so it grows in your brain and then the"
"information is somehow imprinted so what"
"you're seeing is learned information"
"moving around within the body super"
"interesting not well understood at all"
cool
"wow um okay ashish is next"
"hi michael very nice talk okay i wanted"
"to ask which intervention tools are"
"available right now for"
"for mainly for the regenerative medicine"
"purposes is it mainly iron channel genes"
"or something else also"
"available yeah the tools i mean as as uh"
"as as i see it the best tools of the ion"
"channel drugs i mean in model systems at"
"the bench ion channel uh ion channel"
"genes are useful because they give you"
"the cleanest you know the genetic"
"technologies like the cleanest for"
"getting pathway information but i think"
"in in medical application you don't want"
"to have to do gene therapy every time"
"you know you want to"
"target these pathways and you don't have"
"to because i think we've had we've had"
"great success using uh using drugs"
"together with a computational model"
"that's the key you need both you need"
"the the available toolkit of drugs that"
"target all these ion channels and then"
"you need the computational model to tell"
"you which channels to turn on and off"
"and when to get the correct outcome so i"
"see that as the most important toolkit"
"right now it's the collection of channel"
drugs
"all right thank you very much"
"lovely we have martin next"
"hi um is there a relationship between um"
"endogenous peptide based ionophores and"
"the ionophores use"
"um we have used so so the vast majority"
"of our work is not with ionophores we've"
"done a little bit with ionophores the"
"main ionophore we've used is monensin"
"and we've also used we also used a"
"couple other things but um i'm sure"
"there are others i mean i i don't know"
"about the peptide based ones so maybe we"
"should we should have a conversation"
"offline so that um"
"i could learn more about them but we've"
"we've used things like like lake"
"monensen basically"
"yeah but the majority of things we use"
"are not you know the ionophores are"
"really kind of a sledgehammer in many"
"ways um we we tend to use very specific"
"ion channel drugs that hit classes of of"
"different kinds of channels"
"thank you"
thanks
"next one up we have ellen"
"i can also ask you a question in case"
"you have trouble meeting she's just"
"asking what is the cocktail does it"
"include dpca"
"is this uh is this ellen heber cats is"
"that right oh hey ellen uh it's been a"
"while i don't have a lot of time no see"
"um yeah so so there's a there's a"
"variety of of uh there's a variety of"
"cocktails the earliest cocktail was uh"
"it wasn't even a cocktail it was"
"extremely simple it was um"
"i was just it was just monensen we had"
"one after that that had progesterone and"
"things like that uh we we are playing"
"with uh with the dpca stay tuned uh"
"among among many other things the"
"current cocktail has five different uh"
"five different ingredients and it should"
"be that paper should be out in a matter"
"of weeks so you'll see you'll see the"
"cocktail you'll see all the all the"
"dosages and everything else"
"okay lovely next enough anton"
"ah hello so i was really impressed uh by"
"your uh"
"uh in vivo results uh with uh fog liver"
"generation uh but i actually have a"
"question uh regarding uh in vitro"
"application like"
can
"your drug cocktails"
"and or similar interventions be used for"
"suspension culture to grow some"
"vascularized organoids or some"
"vascularized muscle tissues for clean"
"meat application or for"
"in vitro we have to do something quite"
different
"yeah great great question so i i think"
"absolutely they can we we've not done"
"that particular thing what we have done"
"with david kaplan's group and some"
"others is we've done in vitro with uh"
"cell culture so mammalian human cell"
"culture it absolutely um works so you"
"can keep stem cells more stem-like you"
"can force stem cells to differentiate"
"you can do those kinds of things exactly"
"the same methods uh i think absolutely"
"they would work in uh in organoids we"
"are currently using them in our um"
"synthetic biobots which are sort of"
"what's like organoids one step further"
"which they're they're organized with"
"behavior so they move around they do"
"various things and uh and that's that's"
"what we're doing but um i i would love"
"to uh if that's something you work on"
"drop me an email and let's talk about it"
"because um yeah that's a that's an open"
"area of application that just nobody's"
"gotten to it yet"
"oh yeah we work a bit i will drop an"
"email sure drop me anywhere yeah"
"thank you"
"vadim is up next"
"okay thank you um yeah i the answer to"
"my question probably is not known but uh"
"michael based on what"
"i mean based on your understanding of"
"the regeneration process uh in your"
"systems what do you think uh would be a"
"biological age of the regenerated"
"tissues would it be younger or the same"
"age of the rest of the animal will be"
"older great question um i don't know the"
"answer to that we we have been working"
"with um"
"so um so uh steve uh"
"is making uh this um methylation clock"
"right for various organisms and and"
"we're waiting until he uh calibrates the"
"frog one and then and then we can see um"
"i you know that that would be the"
"easiest way to do it right now if you"
"have some other markers um i'd i'd love"
"to hear about it but we don't know"
"actually we are doing this together with"
"him for the fraud oh well there you go i"
"see okay great so okay so so we'll you"
"know as soon as you guys are ready um"
"we'll we can we can check it out um and"
"and and maybe"
"you know once we get once we get the"
"mice uh working uh then we can check i"
"mean that that that that should be much"
"easier once we get the mouse where mice"
"working we can see what the mouse"
"tissues look like"
"that stuff is still in progress"
"fantastic okay then uh next one up let's"
"take one who hasn't asked the question"
"thomas schroeder"
"yeah hi uh fantastic talk um so i have a"
"question basically uh about an example"
"that you mentioned sort of in passing"
"which is um the fact that in like deer"
"antlers grow at rates um on the order of"
"centimeters per day now you mentioned in"
"the flatworms that you were able to sort"
"of activate um"
uh
"processes that uh"
"happen in certain species in flatworms"
"that are of other species and what i'm"
"wondering is whether um you think it"
"might be possible to use bioelectrical"
"signaling to trigger bone regrowth on"
"that same sort of order"
um
"yeah in kind of the same way"
"yeah i i mean"
"optimistically i think so um i you know"
"it's entirely possible that we will run"
"into some weird aspect of deer"
"physiology that permits it whereas for"
"humans it wouldn't work i can't say that"
"that doesn't exist i don't we don't know"
"but i don't think so i think that um"
"i i think these are all very fundamental"
"things and like you know we can i can"
"tell you some speculative stories about"
"why i think humans normally don't do"
"this kind of stuff but i i think it's"
"there to be unlocked i i doubt it's"
"going to be a dear specific issue yeah"
"thank you oh lots of work to be done"
"brad english"
"sorry you're breaking up i can't hear"
"gender pathways that you maybe someone"
"else could ask me i might be in an issue"
"for me my questions in the chat"
okay
"have you tried uh"
"sitting a plate of cells atop a con"
"conductive plate with a certain pattern"
"to see if you could guide its"
development
"sorry what is it what do you mean by a"
"conductive what's a conductive plate"
"like with a voltage or current running"
"through it to oh oh"
"yeah the underlying"
firmware
"yeah got it got it um you can okay so so"
"generally speaking uh"
"using external electrical"
"signals like like like using electrodes"
basically
"is uh"
"you can you can do certain things that"
"way so one thing you can do that way is"
"provide a a vector for cell migration so"
"that's an easy way if you have migratory"
"cell types it's that that is a great way"
"to get them all moving in one particular"
"direction which what's very hard uh"
"using using external electrodes is to"
"set up standing patterns of voltage"
"across tissue which is which is what the"
"what the encoding really is the"
"bioelectrical code is really spatial"
"patterns of voltage differences across a"
"field of cells that's actually very"
"difficult to do with with electrodes um"
"but but if you want to do things like"
"move cells around that you can do with"
"with external um external currents"
"okay so you might have to go as small as"
"like magnetic nanoparticles or something"
"pulling around to produce something more"
"interesting like that or sit with the"
"chemicals but yeah i see your point and"
"you're right it's mesoscopic at that"
"point yeah i mean but but but the tools"
"are already here so i mean if we want to"
"set up um a pattern that uh encodes the"
"correct size and shape of the brain"
"which is not a simple pattern we can"
"already do that with with drugs and if"
"you want a more complex pattern i think"
"what you would do is optogenetics so you"
"would you would lay down a light mask"
"that had the exact shape that you want"
"and you would you know your tissue would"
"have a channel option or something in it"
"and then we've we've done we we've done"
"that for um kick-starting uh tail"
"regeneration and things like that i"
"think i think that right now that's"
"that's the the easier path for this"
"fascinating thank you so much michael"
"leading edge stuff cool thanks"
"we have artem and then carl"
"uh hi hi there um"
just
"earlier to do"
"ashish and the brett's question just now"
"i think"
um
"more operational than the senescence"
"question but uh"
"yeah is there is there anything uh you"
"you think that could be brought from"
"like from uh"
"tip to your computer science background"
"from uh"
"uh adjacent fields like uh microscopy or"
"ngs sequencing"
"to you know to enrich this toolkit that"
"you mentioned of you know both using the"
"the drugs to alter the ion channels and"
uh
yeah
"to get to get access to"
"the more of the morpher space let's say"
"sure sure yeah no abs absolutely i mean"
"on the microscopy and um better better"
"dyes and better imaging of bioelectric"
"uh states in under various conditions is"
"really important so so nobody's done the"
"the basic profiling so like physiomic"
"profiling of asking every every normal"
"organ in its normal structure what is"
"the bioelectric map right"
"no one's done that we i mean we've done"
"it in very specific cases for some frogs"
"and worms and things like this but but"
"in general that data is extremely sparse"
"so so lots more uh lots more imaging"
"using better dyes that need to be"
developed
"and just just just getting those"
"physiomic data sets to complement the uh"
"the transcriptomic and the um and the"
"genomic data sets is critical for ngs"
"yeah ngs is good i feel like we already"
"have most of the ngs that we need"
"because almost any tissue you know what"
"do we want to know we want to know which"
"channels are there because those are our"
"control knobs so pretty much um any"
"tissue you can go online and you can"
"download somebody's profiling and you"
"can you can figure out what what what"
"channels are there so that's probably"
"not the right limiting step with the"
"microscopy for sure yeah"
"oh okay now carl you go again"
"um so"
"outside of the sort of translational"
"aspect here of you know getting things"
"to regenerate or fixing problems in the"
process
"how many labs in the world are are"
"studying the basic"
"you know get us more information about"
"this questions especially like you"
"mentioned that there's not a whole lot"
"of work understanding the aging"
"aspect of this like you know what what"
"changes about the nine to 11 year olds"
"or whatever that makes their fingertips"
"not regenerate versus before what's"
"different about the bioelectric disorder"
"or what's what's involved in human liver"
"regeneration do those networks change"
"over time things like that you know and"
"and the question allison asks at the end"
"uh which maybe she was still saving is"
"what can this group do for you so so"
"maybe in relation to that question you"
know
"what you know are you doing anything to"
"encourage research labs that focus on"
"aging to nudge in this direction"
"yeah um so so so overall uh definitely"
"there's there are not that many labs"
"it's it's it's still relatively speaking"
"a small field um there are there are"
"people who work in in bioelectricity and"
"don't know they work in bioelectricity"
"and what i mean by that is people who"
"for example if you study anderson table"
"syndrome right and you're a geneticist"
"and you don't care about bioelectricity"
"but you care about anderson table"
"syndrome and then eventually you"
"sequence and you find out that whoa it's"
"a potassium channel why do my potassium"
"channel patients have craniofacial"
"dysmorphias well now you're working in"
"developmental bioelectricity right so so"
"there are some some folks that sort of"
"get get dragged into that into it that"
"way but but really labs that really"
"focus on this there's not that there's"
"there aren't that many um there really"
"aren't that many and in particular"
"getting money for profiling is almost"
"impossible right if you're lucky if you"
"can from from standard sources nih and"
"so on you're lucky if you can get"
"funding for functional data like i'm"
"going to um you know figure out uh what"
"these ion channels do in in drosophila"
"development or something like this you"
know
"with that you can do that but but"
"but getting money for a uh comprehensive"
"profiling project the way that you the"
"way that they do in you know uh when"
"they have these uh let's let's figure"
"out what every cell in the brain is"
"expressing right and you know the allen"
"um uh brain atlas and these kind of"
things
"that getting funding for that is almost"
"impossible so so so no one's"
"no no one's done it um as far as your"
"last question uh yeah i mean i i would"
"love to get into uh aging i'd love to"
"collaborate with anybody in this in this"
"community generally speaking what we've"
"been doing for years now to try and"
"lower the barrier for other people to"
"get in is that we publish a lot of um"
"reviews and a lot of how-to protocols so"
"we put everything online as far as if"
"you wanted to get into this from"
"whatever system whatever you're"
"interested in here is like literally"
"step abc how what do you do next right"
"and so we send out um gift baskets of"
"reagents we provide um all the"
"all the plasmids the dye protocols uh"
"you know all the data interpretation"
"stuff we we all all of that is out there"
"so anybody that's interested i would be"
"more than happy to um to help you guys"
"do this so it'd be great"
"fantastic thank you and um well you also"
"mentioned there's a company right um and"
"which you might clear quickly at the"
"beginning of the talk and so what's"
"happening with that next what are what"
"are your next steps in this arena yeah"
"um it's basically the the the company is"
um
"for the the initial focus is quite"
"narrow it's uh limb regeneration and so"
"what we're doing is we're testing our"
"various cocktails in mice using david"
"kaplan's wearable bioreactor short-term"
"application our ion channel cocktail can"
"we trigger um can we trigger a limb"
"regeneration that's that's the beginning"
"obviously my my dream is to grow this to"
"uh a bit um you know kind of fundamental"
"approach to"
"picking uh electroceuticals for all"
"sorts of indications from birth defects"
"to regenerative medicine to aging to"
"cancer but but right now right now it's"
"just about limb regeneration"
"okay and anything uh people in this"
"group could do there to help like are"
"you looking for collaborators with that"
"company or like investors or is there"
"anything uh what are the next steps"
sure
"i'd like you know we had certainly happy"
"to hear from from investors um for sure"
"uh anybody that wants to collaborate"
"drop me an email and let me know what"
"you do and and we'll see what you know"
"we'll see what what makes sense yeah"
"yeah we we're our lab is very"
"collaborative we work with all kinds of"
"people so um for sure i'd love to i'd"
"love to hear from this community"
"great well it seems like you're already"
"collaborating at least with the team"
"unbeknownst around corners um one final"
"thing which is you know we ask people to"
"submit a longevity channel challenge"
"which you've done and um this is just"
"another pack that people can answer this"
"challenge and uh and actually again up"
"to 250 dollars doing so do you want to"
"say maybe a few words about the"
"challenge that you submitted"
"yeah well i mean so so i wasn't really"
"familiar with how all this works but but"
"basically uh"
"the big challenge in this field that i"
"see is just uh what i what i think let's"
"put it this way what i think would um"
"make a real"
"breakthrough and move the field forward"
"kind of a watershed effect would be uh"
"the ability to really uh image"
"these bioelectric states in"
"all sorts of important conditions and"
"not because imaging by itself you know i"
"i really focus on functional experiments"
"i mean seeing the beautiful patterns is"
"nice but more importantly are they"
"instructive right can i show that when"
"you alter the pattern the gene"
"expression changes and the anatomy"
"changes and we do that and so that's"
"what my lab is focused on but it would"
"certainly make it much easier to develop"
"those kind of functional approaches if"
"we have the baseline data from other"
"model systems other conditions various"
"disease conditions various human organs"
"this would be a real game changer so so"
"that's you know that's that's what i put"
in
