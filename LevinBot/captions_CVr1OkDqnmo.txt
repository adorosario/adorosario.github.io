"good evening everyone today I have the"
"pleasure of introducing you to a very"
"special guest all the way from the"
"Distant Shores of Massachusetts Dr"
"Michael Levin a distinguished professor"
"in the biology department and Van of"
"airbrush chair at Tufts University"
"Dr Levin serves as director of the Tufts"
"University Center regenerative and"
"developmental biology"
"his achievements in the field have been"
"honored with Awards such as the"
"scientist Division and the distinguished"
"scholar award"
"has been seeking novel methods to"
"understand and control complex pattern"
"formation in biological systems"
"his work aims to tackle the most"
"fundamental of questions about how life"
"organizes itself"
"the ability of an axolotl to regrow a"
"divided arm is an unquestionable Marvel"
"of nature"
"but I'll take a second to think about"
"how the remaining arm cells know how to"
"do that"
"how do they know when to stop growing"
"how many fingers to have what length to"
be
"how does a single egg cell give rise to"
"the millions of individual cells to make"
"up the human body"
"if these questions keep you up at night"
"as well then fear not for you have come"
"to listen to the right person"
"so sit back engage those neuronal Gap"
"Junctions and enjoy tonight's Journey"
"Through The Mind expanding Realms of"
"collective Consciousness cellular"
"Computing and regenerative medicine"
"please take it away Dr Levin"
"if anybody's interested later on you can"
"you can find all of the primary work in"
"our software and everything else at"
"these two websites and you can reach me"
"there as well so um what we're going to"
"talk about uh is there's a number of"
"ways to kind of get into this but I want"
"to start thinking about one particular"
"way which is uh the change that's"
"happening in engineering you know for"
"for hundreds if probably thousands of"
"years we've been engineering with"
"largely passive materials and more"
"recently you might have seen some work"
"on active materials uh and even"
"computational materials or computational"
"matter but now we are able to start"
"engineering with a gentle matter and I'm"
"going to argue that any kind of"
"engineering with living cells or living"
"materials really takes us into a very"
"interesting completely new world where"
"we have to start asking ourselves what"
"do the parts of the body think about and"
"so um we can warm up this way so this"
"person needs no introduction of course"
"this is Alan Turing who was very"
"interested in intelligence mind and ways"
that
"this this kind of um this kind of meant"
"these these mental features can exist in"
"the real world he was interested in"
"different implementations what kind of"
"obviously uh certain Biologicals have"
"have a mind and intelligence but what"
"else right could we make out of other"
"substrates could we make that so he was"
"he was interested in kind of the the"
"general aspects of of mentality that's"
"distinct from some particular"
"implementation but um he also wrote this"
"he wrote a really interesting paper on"
"morphogenesis and one might wonder why"
"would the same person be interested in"
"these two things what does morphogenesis"
"or pattern formation have to do with"
"intelligence and I'm going to argue that"
"he was on to something very"
"fundamentally deep because these are"
"really the same problem and um and the"
"answers uh to to both of these to these"
"fields enrich enrich each other so um"
"one thing that uh sometimes happens is"
"that people will look at things like ant"
"hills and and term might colonies and"
"flocks of birds and we sometimes talk"
"about these as collective intelligences"
"and so people wonder well"
"um you know to what extent could we call"
"these real intelligences because I I am"
"a centralized true intelligence and then"
"maybe a collection of events may be uh"
"thought of as a collective intelligence"
"and the thing to think to to realize is"
"that actually there are no centralized"
"intelligences we are all collective"
"intelligences in fact all intelligence"
"is collective intelligence because we"
"are walking bags of cells we are not"
"some uh kind of indivisible Diamond of"
"of cognition but we are actually"
"a structure that's built of lots and"
"lots of cells interacting in some way"
"that allows the collective to have goals"
"and memories and preferences and"
"thoughts that belong to the emergent"
"self and not to any of the individual"
"cells from which you arise so this this"
"the scaling of intelligence across"
"collectives is really a fundamental"
"question and this is not just for for um"
"these kind of systems this is for all of"
"us and so in biology and what we see is"
"that biology uses a multi-scale"
"competency architecture where basically"
"what happens is that at each level of"
"organization from molecules to cells to"
"tissues organs and so on we're not just"
"a collection of Nesta dolls structurally"
"that that much is obvious everybody knew"
"that but actually each of these layers"
"has a particular competency to solve"
"problems in its own space so all of"
"these things have the ability to at"
"every level they have the ability to"
"solve problems in different kinds of"
"spaces transcription spaces"
"physiological spaces of course the"
"familiar 3D behavioral space of classic"
"behavior and so on and so so all of"
"these things have competencies and this"
"has uh really important implications"
"because we're not used to uh in the in"
"the in the engineering World we're not"
"used to dealing with systems that have"
"competencies on multiple scales you know"
"sometimes I give a talk called why"
"robots don't get cancer and the reason"
"is because they're largely made of very"
"passive parts right the collective has"
"some sort of goal directed Behavior but"
"the parts generally are pretty dumb so"
"uh biology is not like that and so let's"
"think about what are we made of this"
"this is the sort of thing that we're"
"made of this is a now this is a"
"lacromerium so this is a single cell it"
"has no brain it has no nervous system uh"
"it has no stem cells or cell to cell"
"communication or anything like that it's"
"one cell uh you can see the incredible"
"competency with which it handles its"
"local uh physiological behavioral"
"anatomical all of its various kinds of"
"needs all handled within one cell and so"
"so we are made of single cells and uh"
"the single cells when they join together"
"to form our body they don't give up all"
"their IQ but they do harness it in new"
"ways and the important thing to think"
"about is that each of us took this"
"journey this amazing journey from"
"physics to mind what I mean by that is"
"that we all Start Life as a quiescent"
"OSI it's a little it's a little a little"
"blob of chemicals you can model it with"
"something like this these little little"
"protein and Gene regulatory networks you"
"look at it and you say okay this is"
"clearly a piece of chemistry there is no"
"magic here there is no high level"
cognition
"um it's just chemistry and physics and"
"yet eventually uh that oversight will"
"give rise to something like this or"
"perhaps one of us and then some nine"
"months and and years later after that"
"you get whatever we are you get a human"
"with complex metacognitive capacity that"
"can make comments about its own high"
"level cognition and hopes and dreams and"
"and everything else and the key is that"
"of course this is an extremely smooth"
"and continuous process there is no magic"
"lightning Flash in developmental biology"
"where boom on this particular step"
"that's where cognition enters the"
"picture everything else was physics now"
"we really have mine that doesn't happen"
"so so so so this this development from"
"um from this kind of system to this kind"
"of system tells us that anything that we"
"want to say about this so uh the degree"
"of of intelligence cognition memory goal"
"directedness must have a whole uh"
"spectrum of continuously reducible and"
"and you know sort of sort of um uh uh"
"reducing uh different types of those"
"capacities all the way back down to"
"whatever the very minimal capacities are"
"of chemical and physical systems so um"
"let's uh let's just think about what how"
"our anatomy comes to be so so here's an"
"early set of embryonic blastomeres we"
"started life like this and then"
"eventually this is the cross section"
"through the human torso so you can see"
"this amazing three-dimensional order all"
"the organs are in the right place in the"
"right shape orientation uh positioning"
"relative to each other where does this"
"order actually come from now you might"
"be tempted to say DNA that's what"
"everybody thinks uh right away but of"
"course now we can read genomes and when"
"you read The genome you don't find any"
"of this information when you read The"
"genome what you find is protein"
"sequences and what we now know is that"
"what the DNA does is it nails down the"
"hardware of every cell it tells what"
"every cell what Hardware it gets to have"
"but after that comes the more the more"
"difficult job for us of asking what does"
"the software look like how does how does"
"that Hardware executed in parallel give"
"rise to a very stereotypical specific"
thing
"and so beyond that uh we need to"
"understand how do these collections of"
"cells know what to build and when to"
"stop where so where does this pattern"
"come from"
"um as the workers in regenerative"
"medicine we might want to say well if a"
"piece is missing or damaged how do we"
"get these cells to rebuild it again and"
"as Engineers we might want to do"
"something even crazier and say well I'd"
"like them to build something completely"
"different and we can do some of that too"
"so uh the end game of this kind of uh"
"research project so this is regenerative"
"medicine is something I call an"
"anatomical compiler so someday you"
"should be able to sit down in front of a"
"computer and draw the animal or plant"
"that you want anatomically and then what"
"it would do is it would compile that"
"description into a set of stimuli that"
"would have to be given to cells to get"
"them to build whatever you wanted to"
"build such as for example this"
"three-headed flatworm now why do we need"
"such a thing well uh the the uh kind of"
"practical implications are very obvious"
"uh just about everything except for"
"infectious disease so birth defects"
"traumatic injury cancer aging"
"degenerative disease all of this would"
"go away would be completely solved if we"
"understood how to tell cells what to"
"build if we knew how collections of"
"cells make a swarm a type of decisions"
"about this this kind of collective"
"intelligence decisions about what"
"they're going to build we could replace"
"or repair any of these things and so"
"what this is really about is to"
"understand how do we control uh the"
"scaling of individual cellular"
"activities towards large-scale system"
"level goals having the right number of"
"eyes the right number of Limbs and so on"
"and of course this is also very"
"important for understanding genomes"
"Evolution and all of those things now we"
"are extremely far away from this now and"
"and that's and that's kind of odd you"
"would think that wow all the genetics"
"and genomics has been going gangbusters"
"the biochemistry has been advancing like"
"crazy why do we not have something like"
"this we know how to make any protein we"
"want from uh from a from a genetic"
"sequence why can't we make anatomies on"
"demand and so just think give you a"
"simple simple example of of the wide"
"ocean of ignorance here let's look at"
"this this is a this is a baby Axolotl"
"and baby axolotls have legs this is a"
"tadpole of the frogs and a slavus of"
"tadpoles do not have legs and so now I"
"ask a simple question we're going to"
"make it as we have in our lab we're"
"going to make a frog bottle so it's"
"going to have 50 of frog cells and 50 of"
"Axolotl cells now you've got the Frog"
"genome you've got the Axolotl genome"
"they've both been sequenced all the"
"genomic information is there so I ask"
"you a simple question is the Frog a lot"
"going to have legs or not"
"and what you realize very quickly with"
"questions like this which even uh you"
"know of a seven-year-old could ask this"
question
"um that despite all of the molecular"
"information about the hardware we have"
"absolutely no idea how the collective"
"makes anatomical decisions because we"
"can't answer questions like this we know"
"we know everything there is to know"
"about the genomic sequence I have no"
"idea how to predict if it's going to"
"have legs or not and if it does if those"
"legs will be will be"
"um will consist of only Axolotl cells or"
"it'll recruit some frog cells I mean we"
"just don't know so uh the state of the"
"art here is this that we are very good"
"at manipulating molecular Pathways so"
"the cellular Hardware we're a very long"
"way away from control of Form and"
"Function and uh all of molecular"
"medicine today is basically stuck um or"
"or focused on this level of approach so"
"this is what computer programming looked"
"like in the 40s and 50s you literally"
"physically had to interact with the"
"hardware to get that computer to do"
"something different and this is what"
"what molecular medicine is about today"
"everybody's very excited about genomic"
"editing crispr uh rewiring Pathways and"
"so on and so of course this is this is"
"great you have to understand your"
"hardware and be able to manipulate it"
"but what uh the success of computer"
"science and the information technology"
"Revolution is telling us is that that it"
"doesn't stop there okay the capacity"
"will only grow once you understand how"
"to manipulate it with software with"
"experiences or stimuli not by rewiring"
"this is why when I say to my students um"
"you could get out your laptops switch"
"from Microsoft Word to photoshop and in"
"order to do that get out your soldering"
"iron and start rewiring right and"
"everybody laughs and now why is that"
"funny because we're used to the fact"
"that that computers allow us to do these"
"incredible changes of function without"
"any rewiring whatsoever and I'm going to"
"argue that biology can let us do that"
"too so so I want to talk about a couple"
"of interesting examples uh and uh we we"
"can start thinking about um the"
"definition of intelligence by William"
"James which was this it was the ability"
"to get to the same outcome by different"
"means that's a very interesting"
"definition because it's substrate"
"agnostic meaning it doesn't say anything"
"about brains or neurons it's it's"
"extremely functional and sort of"
"cybernetic and it also requires the"
"Observer us or the scientists or the"
"cells themselves to specify uh the"
"problem space and within within that"
"problem space there will be some degree"
"of Competency so here's an example of"
"solving problems in anatomical space so"
"here's the salamander this Axolotl they"
"regenerate almost all of their body"
"organs it's it's an amazing thing when"
"you amputate that limb it will grow no"
"matter whether you cut it here or"
"whether you cut it here or anywhere it"
"will grow exactly what's needed until it"
"reaches uh the perfect salamander Lim"
"and then it stops okay so it's stops"
"when the correct Target morphology has"
"been reached which suggests very obvious"
"question of how does it know what he"
"correct salamanderlin looks like right"
"here is an even more amazing example"
"these are planaria planaria regenerate"
"everything and so you can cut them into"
"pieces the record is I think 275 pieces"
"or something like that so you can cut"
"them into pieces any way you want every"
"piece will give rise to a perfect little"
"worm and"
"um just to kind of reiterate this theme"
"of going between mind and body if you"
"train a planarian on a specific memory"
"and then you cut off their heads"
"including their brain you let the tail"
"regenerate a brand new head like this"
"you find out that okay now they've also"
"regenerated their memories so wherever"
"that memory was stored it becomes"
"imprinted onto this new brain and then"
"they show evidence of remembering it"
"right so so memories are stable to"
"complete regeneration of their brain so"
"think about this this this"
"um amazing degree of of plasticity here"
"this is an example in vertebrates uh"
"this is a tadpole so here are the"
"nostrils here's the mouth here's the"
"spinal cord the brain is here the gut"
"you'll notice something very weird there"
"are the normal eyes are gone but there's"
"an eye on its tail so we engineered this"
"kind of tadpole putting an eye on its"
"tail and then we use this machine to"
"train these animals for on visual tasks"
"and we find out that they actually see"
"quite well and so what you find out is"
"that this brain which for millions of"
"years expected visual input from these"
"two locations now it's got a weird patch"
"of is sort of itchy tissue on its back"
"that's sending some kind of electrical"
"signals actually the synapse on the"
"spinal cord they don't go directly to"
"the brain and that's good enough the"
"animal can use that information and see"
"it perfectly well so the brain adjusts"
"so uh this these are all examples of"
"getting to the same goal by different"
"means having adaptive functionality even"
"when things are going really wrong right"
"your eyes are in the wrong location your"
"head's been cut off all these things"
"biology is amazing at uh doing what it"
"needs to do despite all these"
"perturbations and um just here's a"
"here's a very sort of clean and simple"
"example of this where"
"what we what what you have here is uh"
"this is again a tadpole in order to"
"become a frog tadpoles have to rearrange"
"their face so the Jaws have to move the"
"eyes have to move all this stuff has to"
"move around and it used to be thought"
"that this was a hardwired set of"
"processes that somehow every organ just"
"moved in the right direction the right"
"amount and then you have your normal"
"frog so we decided to test the"
"hypothesis that this process was"
"actually much more intelligent than it"
"seems because you cannot estimate the"
"intelligence of processes without"
"perturbation if you just observe things"
"they may be reliable you have no idea"
"what they're actually capable of until"
"you start poking around so what we did"
"was we created these Picasso tadpoles so"
"basically they're scrambled everything"
"is in the wrong place the eyes are on"
"the side of the head the Jaws are off to"
"the side you know everything is"
"everything is scrambled and what you"
"find is that they still make perfectly"
"normal frogs because all of these organs"
"move around in in novel abnormal paths"
"sometimes they in fact go too far and"
"they have to sort of come backwards but"
"they run around and they end up where uh"
"they're supposed to be for a normal frog"
"face so what the genetics actually gives"
"you is not a hardwired set of processes"
"what it does what it gives you is a"
"problem-solving uh system it gives you"
"an error minimization scheme that is"
"able to keep changing until the Delta"
"from the desired Target morphology is"
"sufficiently low so that raises again"
"this this question where is the memory"
"how does it know what the correct shape"
"is supposed to be and can it be"
Rewritten
"um and uh and so we've been we've been"
"we've been doing this research and for a"
"long time and I'm just going to show you"
"one I'm going to kind of focus on one"
"particular aspect of it will be just for"
"reasons of time uh to ask where where is"
"this memory how does it know what the"
"right pattern is so uh we"
"a long time ago I started thinking about"
"this and I thought okay well for"
"inspiration let's think how what's the"
"best example of goal directed activity"
"we have that's obviously um brain driven"
"behavior and so there we have the same"
"problem we have a collection of cells"
"between your ears that is able to"
"somehow store memories memories of"
"geometric um you know mazes if you're a"
"rat or other kinds of things if you're a"
"different animal uh it is stored"
"geometric um representations and pursue"
"goals and have these kind of behaviors"
"how does it do that well in the brain uh"
"it's pretty clear it how it does it it"
"has uh it's a system of these"
"electrically active cells called neurons"
"they are able to uh acquire different"
"voltage states by exchanging charged"
"molecules across their membrane through"
"these ion channels and because it's a"
"network they're sometimes able to"
"propagate that voltage State through"
"these little"
"um uh electrical synapses known as Gap"
"Junctions so that's that's the hardware"
"and it's basically the commitment of"
"Neuroscience that that hardware stores"
"and underlies all of the cognition of"
"the uh of the brain that basically all"
"of your memories and your goals and all"
"your capacities are somehow uh encoded"
"and and implemented by these electrical"
"kinds of Dynamics well it turns out that"
"this this set of uh this amazing"
"architecture is not something that is"
"arose when brains showed up on the"
"evolutionary scene these are actually"
"incredibly ancient uh mechanisms they"
"existed Even in our unicellular"
"ancestors and evolution figured this out"
"uh that that electrical networks were"
"really good to store and process"
"information a long long time ago even"
"around around the time of bacterial"
"biofilms so basically every cell in your"
"body has ion channels most of them have"
"Gap Junctions to their neighbors and"
"they all make electrical networks and"
"you can see a lot more of this here"
"basically the idea is that most of the"
"tricks of the brain uh arose by"
"basically speed optimizing and pivoting"
"into a different problem space so"
"three-dimensional movement instead of"
"morphogenesis uh some of the exact same"
"dynamics that all networks have been"
"doing for a really long time so what we"
"did was we developed some tools to read"
"and write these electrical States in"
"tissues exactly how neuroscientists have"
"been doing it for the brain so this idea"
"of reading out a neural decoding right"
"reading out these brain States and then"
"incepting false Memories We we developed"
"some tools to do this uh basically"
"stealing all kinds of Concepts and tools"
"from Neuroscience because the cells"
"can't tell the difference that's really"
"important we set up different"
"departments for body physiology"
"developmental biology and Neuroscience"
"but this is completely artificial so the"
"cells can't say the the tools that we"
"use cannot tell the difference"
"where they're applied so uh so here's"
"one one example what you're seeing here"
"is a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye"
"where the brightness of the of the each"
"pixel is proportional to the voltage"
"state of the cell and this is a time"
"lapse movie showing you uh the early"
"frog embryo putting its face together so"
"um what happened was that my colleague"
"Danny Adams uh soaked these things in"
"this voltage sensitive fluorescent dye"
"and then you can see that uh uh long"
"before the anatomy of the face shows up"
"and the genes that are important to a"
"pattern the face here this is one frame"
"out of that video we call this the"
"electric face because you can already"
"see it looks like a face here's where"
"the right eye goes the animal's left eye"
"will come in after you know later here's"
"where the mouth goes here are the"
"placards you can already see and I'm"
"showing you this one because it's the"
"easiest one to understand some of the"
"others are quite complex"
"uh but so so this is a normal"
"bioelectrical pre-pattern this is what"
"determines what the face of the frog is"
"going to look like and we know that"
"because if you interfere with this"
"bioelectrical pattern you change the"
"anatomy of the face uh how do we do that"
"well again we use all the same"
"techniques as neuroscientists do so"
"there are no waves electromagnetic"
"radiation no magnets no electrodes"
"nothing like that this is all playing on"
"the endogenous bioelectrical interface"
"that the cells expose to us so these ion"
"channels are exactly how the cells were"
"meant by Evolution to control each"
"other's Behavior so they could cooperate"
"together and now we are hijacking that"
"and so we do that by controlling these"
"ion channels think of them as a kind of"
"keyboard onto this computational medium"
"of tissues and so we can control the ion"
"channels and we can control the Gap"
Junctions
"and this is why we can use light we can"
"use drugs we can mutate the different"
"channels although mostly we use we use"
"drugs and um and and light so when you"
"do this so what happens when you do this"
"can we actually incept so so the the"
"argument I'm making is that much like in"
"the brain in the rest of your body"
"during interesting events such as"
"embryogenesis regeneration cancer"
"suppression metamorphosis the electrical"
"grid of the rest of the cells are"
"basically is basically the computational"
"medium by which that collection of um of"
"cells makes decisions about what it's"
"going to build okay so so much like we"
"navigate three-dimensional space using"
"the electrical circuits of our brain the"
"rest of the of of the cells are using"
"that those same kinds of electrical"
"circuits to navigate other spaces for"
"example morphe space to build and what"
"they want so so can we get them to build"
"something else so here's a few examples"
"um we I showed you a bioelectrical"
"pattern that makes an eye in the face so"
"what we did was uh basically impose that"
"same bioelectrical pattern on the gut"
"and if and you can do that by injecting"
"RNA that encodes specific ion channels"
"um and when you do that and you can do"
"this anywhere in the animal those those"
"cells read that pattern they say I guess"
"we're supposed to make an eye and they"
"make an eye so these eyes can have all"
"the same layers so all retina optic"
"nerve all that same stuff if you only uh"
"convert a few cells to this um to this"
"electrical state they're smart enough to"
"grab a bunch of their neighbors so the"
"blue one this is this is a cross section"
"through a lens in the tail of a tadpole"
somewhere
"and the blue ones are the ones we"
"actually injected with that ION channel"
"but they realize there's not enough of"
"them to make a proper lens so they've"
"recruited a bunch of their unmanipulated"
"neighbors okay these guys were not the"
"brown ones were not themselves"
"um converted in any way and yet they all"
"participate together right because"
"because there's two levels of induction"
"here we we instruct these cells to make"
"an eye these cells instruct their"
"neighbors to work with them to make this"
"eye right this is this morphological"
"um goal directed activity so doing that"
"you can make uh ectopic otisists or"
"inner ears you can make extra Hearts you"
"can make extra brain you can make extra"
"legs so none of this is Photoshop these"
"are all real real live animals"
"um you can so here's our six-legged frog"
"you can make fins which is kind of"
"interesting because tadpoles aren't"
"supposed to have fins that's more of a"
"fish thing and we'll get to that"
momentarily
"um but so so you see here that what I'm"
"showing you is that these biological"
"states are instructive that they control"
"a very simple signal is basically a"
"subroutine call uh induces the system to"
"uh to head for specific regions of"
"morphe space meaning to make limbs or"
"hearts or whatever else"
"okay so I want to give you one specific"
"example where this is perhaps one of the"
"places where we work this out in the"
"most detail this is a flatworm these"
"planarium and uh the plenary when you"
"cut off the head and the tail they"
"regenerate a single-headed animals 100"
"of the time they they always get it"
"right so"
"um what you can do is you can take this"
"middle fragment and you can ask well"
"here the anterior genes are expressed in"
"the head not in the tail fine here's the"
"bioelectric state"
"um the anterior side is um"
"the interior side is is depolarized so"
"that's where the head is going to be and"
"you get a one-headed animal however what"
"you can do is in this two-headed animal"
"you can induce this kind of"
"bioelectrical state by opening and"
"closing some specific ion channels and"
"when you do that when you injure it it"
"will make a two-headed animal because"
"now the memory of what a correct"
"planarian is supposed to look like has"
"changed keep in mind this is very"
"important this bioelectrical map is not"
"a reading of this two-headed animal this"
"is a bioelectrical map of a one-headed"
animal
"so a one-headed nor anatomically normal"
"planarian can store one of two ideas"
"representations of what it's going to do"
"if it gets injured in the future this is"
"a counter factual memory if you're"
"interested in neuroscience and where"
"this kind of mental time travel comes"
"from to be able to Envision things that"
"are not going on right now I think this"
"is a a basal example of it this is a"
"pattern for what's going to happen if it"
"gets injured in the future okay and so"
"it sits there like this it's a latent"
"memory it sits there doing nothing until"
"you injure the animal and then the cells"
"build to this pattern as opposed to this"
"pattern and they make a two-headed"
"animal remember there's nothing"
"genetically these animals are completely"
"genetically normal none of that has been"
"has been altered"
"um and why do I keep calling it a memory"
"because uh if you take one of these"
"two-headed animals you cut off the"
"primary head you cut off uh this this"
"crazy ectopic secondary head and you say"
"well I have a middle fragment uh there's"
"no extra head there the genetics are"
"have not been touched of course it"
"should go back to normal and make a"
"one-headed planarian and that's not what"
"it does once you've that circuit that"
"biological circuit stores the"
"information of how many heads a worm is"
"supposed to have it's not in the DNA"
"it's in the bioelectric circuit so once"
"you've Rewritten that circuit it keeps"
"State it's kind of like a flip-flop and"
"what it'll if you can keep cutting it"
"and they will stay continuously"
"two-headed unless you go back and you"
"actively change it to be one-headed and"
"if you're wondering what these things"
"look like in Behavior here they are"
"here's a little video um"
"uh this this has all the properties of"
"memory it's long term stable but it's"
"rewritable it has conditional recall"
"meaning it can sit there doing nothing"
"until you cut them and has discrete"
"possible outcomes now I've shown you"
"that by electrically we can uh by"
"manipulating the memory this is"
"literally the electrical memory of the"
"tissue of what it's supposed to look"
"like uh by manipulating it we can ask it"
"to make a second head fine but we can"
"also ask it to make heads appropriate to"
"other species so here's a triangular"
"headacharian we can make them make"
"flatheads like P falinas round heads"
"like s mediterraneas"
"um the distance here is about 100 to 150"
"million years okay again nothing wrong"
"with it with their DNA if you sequence"
"the Genome of these things you're not"
"going to find anything different but"
"they have a completely different Anatomy"
"not only their head shape but um the"
"shape of their brain and the shape of"
"and the um the distribution of the stem"
"cells just like these other species so"
"so we can access other attractors in"
"this morphe space by I can by by"
"altering how the cells talk to each"
"other electrically after injury you can"
"even push it push the system to to very"
"distant attractors that don't belong to"
"planarians at all so you can make things"
"that look like this these spiky forms or"
"this um kind of cylindrical shape or"
"kind of a hybrid hybrid form so again"
"these are all where what we're doing"
"here is we're incepting false memories"
"encoded by electrically encoded patterns"
"into the collective intelligence of this"
"set of cells that Argo is going to then"
"guide their their morphogenetic activity"
"so in the last uh just two two more"
"minutes or so I want to take this one"
"step further and ask"
"um what are what are the limits of this"
"you know how much real-time plasticity"
"is there uh and how much does standard"
"development really obscure this"
"plasticity and this intelligence and so"
"to to answer this"
"um we asked uh what would happen if we"
"took some cells and we liberated them"
"from their normal environment in the"
"embryo and we're basically um just uh"
"just asking them to reboot their"
"multicellularity in the new context the"
"same old cells what are they going to do"
"what are they going to build so here's"
"an example"
"um here's a frog embryo this this uh in"
"cross section these cells up here are"
"they're Theta to be skinned so what we"
"do is we take them off and we put them"
"by themselves in the petri dish and we"
"ask what they're going to do now in"
"theory so so here they are being these"
"are dissociated skin cells being put in"
"this little depression now they could"
"have done many things they could die"
"they could do nothing they could crawl"
"away from each other they could form a"
"flat monolayer like cell culture many"
"things they could do what they do"
"instead is they make something very"
"interesting which we've called a xenobot"
"it's a biorobotics platform made from"
"xenopus lavis cells so what they do is"
"overnight they come together like this"
"into this nice round little little form"
"the flashes are calcium signals I'll"
"talk about that in a minute and then"
"this thing does something very"
"interesting it um it exploits the fact"
"that skin cells in the Frog and where"
"you have little hairs called cilia they"
"move and so what it does is it now uses"
"it for Locomotion what are those hair"
"cells originally used for they're used"
"to distribute mucus down the side of the"
"animal but in this case this the the the"
"system is able to use them to move"
"around so here's a single one swimming"
"through some particles here are some"
"group Behavior so you can see these guys"
"are resting doing nothing this one is"
"going on kind of a long journey these"
"two are interacting with each other this"
"one is sort of rolling in place they can"
"roll in place like this they can Patrol"
"back and forth like this"
"um they can do a maze so here's one so"
"so it takes off it moves over here it's"
"gonna take a turn without bumping into"
"the opposite wall it just takes the turn"
"it knows the turn is there and then at"
"this point for some internal reason we"
"don't understand it decides to turn"
"around and go back where it came from"
"okay much like any other creature you"
"would observe in the wild it has all"
"kinds of internal dynamics that we don't"
"yet understand it's a fully self-motile"
"we are not actuating it there we are not"
"controlling it in any way this little"
"proto-organism formed from skin cells"
"has a completely novel set of behaviors"
"uh you can see this this uh this calcium"
"signaling which we're seeing here is"
"just it's very brain-like so if you do"
"this in a if you look at calcium"
"signaling in the brain this is the kind"
"of thing you would see and of course"
"we're investigating now what are their"
"protocognitive capacity cities what do"
"can they learn do they have preferences"
"whatever they can heal if you injure"
"them like this they will heal back so so"
"you can cut them like this almost in"
"half and they will just fold up back to"
"their new xenobot shape and the most"
"amazing thing is this"
"um we have made it impossible for these"
"guys to reproduce in their normal froggy"
"fashion because all they are are skin"
"now they don't have any of the things"
"that would enable them to reproduce So"
"within a couple of days they basically"
"figure out a new way to reproduce"
"themselves so what happens is if you put"
"them in an environment with a bunch of"
"loose skin cells what they will do is"
"they will run around both individually"
"and as collectives they will run around"
"and they will make these little these"
"little piles they make the little piles"
"and then they sort of Polish them and"
"polish them and push the cells together"
"and the end result of that is this thing"
"which of course by the next morning"
"becomes the next generation of xenobot"
"and so what that will do then is mature"
"and start to do exactly the same thing"
"run around and collect the loose cells"
"into the Next Generation present about"
"this is called kinematic"
"self-replication this is uh kind of Von"
"Neumann's dream of a robot that goes out"
"and and builds copies of itself from"
"parts that it finds in the environment"
"um but the thing to to to realize here"
"is that uh no no other animal to our"
"knowledge with no other creature on"
"earth uses this kind of um this kind of"
"process uh this only works because cells"
"are in a gentle material we are able to"
"make xenobots because the cells uh have"
"the the competency to get together and"
"form this new organism and each xenobot"
"is able to make the next generation of"
"xenobot only because it's dealing with a"
"a gentle material it's dealing with"
"cells that are also competent to do that"
"right so so the fact that you're we're"
"not dealing with passive Parts gives the"
"whole system amazing capacity so so I'm"
"just finishing up here uh to say that"
"here are some amazing things about this"
"this is this is the Frog genome these"
"xenobots have a perfectly wild type frog"
"genome we haven't added anything we"
"haven't given them new genes we haven't"
"given them time to uh evolve or mutate"
"much like all the other things that I"
"showed you the tadpoles of what the"
"tails on their eyes don't need periods"
"of adaptation immediately know how to"
"use that eye"
"that genome can give rise to at least"
"two probably many more things it can"
"give rise to a typical embryo which will"
"have certain shape and behavior or if we"
"engineer by subtraction meaning taking"
"away a bunch of cells that are normally"
"inhibiting these skin cells from having"
"their full potentiality then they will"
"do this they become a xenobot then the"
"xenobot has its own developmental"
"sequence it becomes something crazy"
"looking like this and they have a"
"completely different Behavior now look"
um
"typically when we ask why does a certain"
"animal or plant have a particular shape"
"or behavior the answer is evolution long"
"periods of selection right selection to"
"be a good whatever it is and you can"
"tell that story about a frog because"
"there have been long periods of"
"selection for a frog to have specific"
"features that match the Frog environment"
"you cannot tell such a story for"
"xenobots because there's never been any"
"xenobots there's never been selection to"
"be a good xenobot there's never been"
"selection to be able to do kinematic"
"self-replication there's a completely"
"different set of Concepts that are"
"needed to understand where these"
"capacities are coming from and that"
"plasticity the fact that when you look"
"at skin cells and it's so reliable and"
"all the embryos are doing the same thing"
"and you say well that's obvious of"
"course skin cells become this boring"
"two-dimensional layer on the outside of"
"the animal well what else are they going"
"to do they're skin cells but actually"
"the only reason they do that is because"
"they're basically bullied into it by the"
"rest of the cells that are signaling to"
"them to get them to do it they're being"
"Behavior shaped by the other cells left"
"to their own devices in the absence of"
"those cells that's really all we did"
"it's we've took away a bunch of cells"
"now you get to see what these cells are"
"really capable of so this is this is why"
"it's so important bioengineering and"
"synthetic morphology so critical to"
"understand the competencies of cells and"
"tissues and organs because just by"
"looking at the standard"
"um kind of default path that that"
"Evolution took uh in its uh phylogenetic"
"tree is not sufficient to see this so"
"now I'm just going to stop here and say"
"that uh everything all of the amazing"
"life forms you know Darwin called um the"
"endless forms most beautiful right"
"there's a lot of amazing animals and so"
"on all of that is like this tiny little"
"little blip on the in the space of all"
"possible agents because life is"
"incredibly interoperable and for reasons"
"that we can discuss so any combination"
"of evolved material such as cells and"
"tissues design material like Nano"
"materials and things and software any"
"combination of those is some uh coherent"
"agent that's going to have shapes and"
"and behaviors and cognitive capacity"
"completely alien for what we're used to"
"all of our biology knowledge comes from"
"here and it's a tiny area of of the"
"space of possible beings maybe we'll"
"find some of those in exobiology and"
"maybe we'll well for sure we'll we'll"
"make a bunch of these the important"
"thing is to realize that you can't uh"
"test your theory on the same data that"
"generated it and for this reason we have"
"to go outside the standard forms that uh"
"the One path of evolution on Earth has"
"given us so"
"um with that uh I will just say that"
"there are a bunch of papers where I"
"develop all of these things with with"
"various colleagues in different"
"directions I want to thank the folks who"
"did all the work so so Doug Blackiston"
"and Sam kriegman"
"um and uh and uh Sam's old boss Josh"
"bongard we did all the all the xenobot"
"stuff together"
"um tal Shamrock did the um the planarian"
"memory work Maya Evans Bell did some of"
the
"um changing the planaria to different"
"species and um uh Fallon Durant did all"
"the bioelectrical control of of of a"
"head number in planarian so I want to"
"thank I want to thank them I want to"
"thank the model systems because they do"
"all the heavy lifting in these"
experiments
"um of course our funders and a couple of"
"disclosures so I'm associated with two"
"spin-off companies um morpheuticals Inc"
"and fauna systems and I thank you very"
"much and I'll take questions"
