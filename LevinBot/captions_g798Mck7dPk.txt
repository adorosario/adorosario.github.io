"well welcome to the arizona cancer"
"evolution center's monthly discussion"
"series on cancer and the nature of life"
"and we've got a great talk for you today"
"the electric life of cancer our speaker"
"is mike levin vannevar bush professor of"
"biology at tufts university and i know"
"he's got a few other titles too"
"mike leads a research group that studies"
"how complex tissues process information"
"to perform self-assembly and repair"
"including intriguingly the use of"
"electrical networks that make decisions"
"about growth and form"
"and with him will be paul davies paul is"
"a regents professor of physics at asu"
"and director of the beyond center for"
"fundamental concepts in science he"
"served as a principal investigator of"
"asu's center for the convergence of"
"physical science and cancer biology"
"and he's interested in deep evolutionary"
"roots of cancer"
"and his book demon in the machine"
"touches many of the topics that we'll be"
"talking about today"
"so this is the order mike will talk"
"first followed by a discussion with paul"
"and then questions from the audience"
"and so can you please use the q a"
"function to ask your questions and then"
"we'll gather them together and put them"
"to you so i'm just going to turn it over"
"now to mike mike"
"thank you so much uh it's a real"
"pleasure to be here um"
"i'm very pleased to be able to share"
"some some thoughts with you um hopefully"
"you can see the slides and"
"if you're interested in getting further"
"into the details of what i'm about to"
"show you you can find all that"
"information and lots more at these at"
"these websites"
"so i'd like to talk about uh cancer"
"as a as a kind of a disease of geometry"
"and i'll explain what i mean by that um"
"here's a simple question uh we don't"
"have a problem of robots getting cancer"
"why is that well fundamentally it's"
"because uh most of our technology today"
"is a flat architecture where if there is"
"some uh kind of intelligent behavior in"
"the large-scale machine"
"the individual pieces don't have that"
"right so so it's made basically of more"
"or less passive components"
"and all of the all of the intentionality"
"is present in the larger in the larger"
"scale machine biology isn't like that uh"
"biology is operates on a multi-scale"
"competency architecture which means that"
"all the way from the molecular networks"
"the subcellular components uh tissues"
"and organs and organisms and then of"
"course swarms every level of this"
"biological organization has its own"
"agenda they all solve problems they have"
"a kind of minimal cognition"
"where in various kinds of problem spaces"
"they are able to pursue local"
"appropriate goals at different degrees"
"of sophistication and this while it"
"enables the amazing capabilities of"
"multicellular life is also why we have"
"this this this problem of cancer so"
"what i'm going to tell you today is that"
"as it turns out all cells not just"
"neurons communicate as electrical"
"networks that process information and"
"this enables us to detect induce and now"
"even normalize cancer by manipulating"
"the electrical signals that allow cells"
"to cooperate towards large-scale"
"anatomical goals and to see what i mean"
"we can start by looking at individual"
"cells so this is a creature known as a"
lacrimaria
"and you can see the uh the fact that uh"
"this this organism has all of its local"
"needs under control so"
"it's it's metabolic it's morphological"
"it's behavioral needs you can handle"
"this at the single cell level there's no"
"brain there's no nervous system so we"
"have to start with the understanding"
"that individual cells are highly"
"competent right and"
"actually the fact that they even work"
"together to form large-scale structures"
"already requires explanation so the real"
"question isn't why do we have cancer the"
"real question is why is there ever"
"anything other than independent cell"
"behavior this is uh an early embryo so"
"we all start life as"
"a set of embryonic cells"
"and this is a cross section through a"
"human torso so look at the incredible"
"order here right the invariant uh"
positioning
"size shape orientation everything is in"
"the right place next to uh the right"
"thing where does this pattern actually"
"come from how is it that these cells can"
"cooperate to build uh with with very"
"high reliability to build exactly this"
"now you might be tempted to say that dna"
"is is where it's uh where this"
"information is stored but we can now"
"read genomes and we know that genomes"
"don't directly mention any of this"
"genomes specify the micro level hardware"
"that every cell gets to have so the"
"proteins of every cell but we still need"
"to understand how cells"
communicate
"and cooperate to build one thing rather"
"than another and uh and when they and"
"how do they know when to stop growing"
"how can we communicate to them that when"
"something is missing let's say a piece"
"of this has been damaged how do we get"
"those cells to rebuild"
"and uh what happens when this incredible"
"process of working towards a complex"
"anatomical goal breaks down and one of"
"the things that happens is cancer so"
"this is a very uh very fundamental um"
"very fundamental problem and it's"
"important to realize that there are many"
"knowledge gaps currently in the field"
"despite all of the progress in molecular"
"biology and genetics here's one typical"
"example of that so this is the larva of"
"a salamander known as an axolotl and"
"baby axolotls have legs this is a"
"an embryo of the frog"
"and frog tadpoles don't have legs and"
"one can imagine as we have done in our"
"lab making something called a"
"frogolottle which consists of some"
"amount of embryonic axolotl cells some"
"amount of frog cells and they cooperate"
"just fine they build a frog a lot of now"
"we have the genome of the axolotl we"
"have the genome of the frog do we know"
"ahead of time whether froga bottles will"
"have legs"
"and if they do have legs will those legs"
"be made entirely of axolotl cells or"
"will they include some frog"
"frog cells and and the point is we"
"there's no predictive"
"there's no predictive structure that you"
"can use even though you have all the"
"genomic information we currently don't"
"have any models that can answer"
"questions like this and so uh there's a"
"really a fundamental knowledge gap still"
"around pattern control how are"
"individual cellular decisions harnessed"
"towards large-scale anatomical goals"
"like these amazing bodies here and this"
"is a fundamental problem because just"
"think if we could if we could answer"
"this question this was the answer to"
"this one question would solve almost"
"every aspect of medicine with the"
"exception of infectious disease"
"everything else birth defects traumatic"
"injury uh uh cancer degenerative disease"
"aging and even uh creation of novel"
"structures via synthetic bioengineering"
"would be solved if we could tell cells"
"what it is that we want them to build in"
"other words of"
"new new organs of proper functionality"
"now the amazing thing about embryonic"
"development is that while this process"
"of generating form is reliable it is not"
"hardwired and uh you can see that by uh"
"looking at what some of some other"
"animals can do this is a salamander"
"known as an axolotl"
"these animals regenerate their legs"
"their eyes their jaws their tails"
"including spinal cord portions of the"
"heart and brain and what happens is that"
"if uh if if this animal loses its limb"
"and this can be anywhere along the"
"length what the cells will do is very"
"rapidly grow to"
"rebuild that structure and then they"
"stop this is the most amazing aspect of"
"regeneration how do they know when to"
"stop because they stop"
"when a correct salamander arm has been"
"completed so this is this is uh clearly"
"some sort of"
"error minimization scheme they're able"
"to detect the deviation and and to"
"continue working until that is corrected"
"the champions of that process are these"
"this is uh these are planarium the"
"flatworms with a true brain uh lots of"
"internal organs same neurotransmitters"
"that you and i have and the amazing"
"thing about planaria is several things"
"one is that you can chop them into"
pieces
"and uh each piece and the record is"
"something like 275 pieces"
"each piece knows exactly what to rebuild"
"to make a perfect little worm in fact"
"while the new heads and tails are built"
"the the remaining fragment actually"
"scales down so that everything is"
"properly proportioned when it's when"
"it's done these animals not only don't"
"don't normally get cancer but they are"
"also immortal there's no such thing as"
"an old planarian they have no obvious"
"life limit whatever is um"
"uh whatever is senescence it drops off"
"and the animal simply regenerates it and"
"you can already see that this is a"
complex
"problem of cell to cell communication"
"because if you if you cut one of these"
"planaria in half the back end here needs"
"to grow a tail the front half here needs"
"to grow ahead so completely different"
"anatomical structures but these cells"
"were direct neighbors when you when you"
"separated them with the scalpel in other"
words
"they can't tell what they should do"
"simply from their position they have to"
"talk to the rest of the tissue to make"
"decisions about well we don't have a"
"head yet we need to grow ahead and so on"
"so that that sort of thing is is"
"absolutely critical"
"um it should be noted that uh"
"regeneration is not just for so-called"
"lower animals so the human liver is"
"highly regenerative even the ancient"
"greeks knew that somehow"
"deer every year regenerate large amounts"
"of antlers the so this is bone that"
"grows at the rate of a centimeter and a"
"half per day so bone vasculature"
"innervation skin and even human children"
"can regenerate their fingertips below a"
"certain age so we really need to"
"understand this where where does all"
"this stand well we are very good at"
"manipulating cells and molecules so"
"we're very good at getting this kind of"
"information which genes turn other genes"
"on and off what proteins control which"
"genes what proteins interact with each"
other
"we're very good at getting that kind of"
"hardware information we're actually a"
"really long way from understanding how"
"these collectives decide what to make"
"when to stop and actually resolve all"
"kinds of novel problems which we'll talk"
"about momentarily so this this here is"
"what computer programming looked like in"
"the 40s and 50s and the important thing"
"here is that in order to get this"
"machine to do something different she is"
"literally rewiring it right she's"
"physically changing the structure of the"
"machine and this is where most of"
"molecular medicine is today all of our"
"efforts are"
"are focused on things like crispr genome"
editing
"changing molecular pathways protein"
"engineering it's all uh basically stuck"
"at the level of hardware and so what we"
"would like to do now"
"is to really understand uh how can we"
"take advantage of the software of life"
"the actual uh physiological"
"decision-making that goes on that we"
could
"exploit for purposes of medicine and i'm"
"talking about uh the intelligence and uh"
"the decision-making of these cells and i"
"and i mean those those terms exactly"
"cells form a kind of collective"
"intelligence in the sense of that we're"
"used to thinking about uh swarms of of"
"bees and ants and things like this as"
"collective intelligences but we're"
"actually we're all collective"
"intelligences we're all made of parts"
"i want to show you an example of"
"biological problem solving so this uh"
"this is a tadpole of the frog so here's"
"one eye here's the other eye here's the"
"brain the gut and the nostrils"
"and these tadpoles need to become frogs"
"and in order to become frogs the tadpole"
"face has to uh change so so the jaws"
"have to come out the eyes have to move"
"forward everything has to change and it"
"was thought originally that what the"
"genome of the frog somehow does is"
"encode a hardwired set of movements"
"after all all the tadpoles all normal"
"tadpoles look the same and so if you"
"just uh move every piece in the right"
"direction the right amount you get a"
"normal fraud so"
"uh to to to check uh for the uh to to"
"check for the plasticity of this process"
"uh we created what we call picasso"
"tadpoles so so everything is in the"
"wrong place the eyes on the back of the"
"head the jaws are off to the side"
"everything is moved"
"and the amazing thing is that these"
"animals become largely normal frogs"
"because all of the different organs will"
"move in novel unnatural paths and"
"continue to keep moving in fact"
"sometimes they go too far and actually"
"have to double back a little bit they"
"will keep moving until they get to a"
"correct frog face this is the remarkable"
"thing about this is it matches a very"
"nice definition of intelligence by"
"william james which basically said that"
"intelligence is the ability to reach the"
"same goal by different means so as the"
"configuration of of the head changes as"
"the starting position changes in a way"
"that uh that"
"is completely unexpected and abnormal"
"these cells and tissues figure out what"
"to do in order to move around and get to"
"their goal which is a a particular"
"region of the space of all possible"
"configurations this is called amorphous"
"space or anatomical amorphous space and"
"they make they make a proper head and so"
"so what evolution actually gives us is"
"not a set of hardwired movements but the"
"genome actually specifies a machine"
"that's able to minimize error from a"
"kind of a kind of specification and so"
"what is really critical about this this"
"phenomenon is that it's in cybernetic"
"terms it's a process that has a goal it"
"has a goal because it will keep working"
"and keep spending energy until a"
"particular condition is satisfied that"
"goal here is the creation of a"
"particular anatomical structure so what"
"you can see actually is that"
"the the size of goals scales so while"
"individual cells are mainly concerned"
"with very small small scale cell level"
"goals metabolic states ph hunger level"
"things like that uh collections of cells"
"are able to work towards very large"
"goals like"
"up key upkeep of a whole limb individual"
"cells have no idea what a limb is or how"
"long a finger is but the collective does"
"the collective intelligence is able to"
"manage this very large goal but as much"
"as these goals scale up during evolution"
"they can also scale down so this is uh"
"this is glioblastoma cells these are"
"cancer cells and what happens is that"
"when cells are disconnected and we'll"
"get more into this momentarily when"
"cells disconnect from the electrical"
"network that allows the group to"
"maintain a large state such as a shape"
"of a tissue or an organ"
"to maintain that tissue memory they will"
"go back and they basically roll back to"
"an ancient unicellular lifestyle where"
"the rest of the body is just outside"
"environment to them they are going to do"
"what what all single cells want to do"
"which is to reproduce and become"
"multiple cells"
"and go wherever life is good so"
"fundamentally one can think about the"
"problem of cancer as uh the shrinkage"
"the shrinking of the goal state from"
"something very large to something quite"
"small and we can understand here that uh"
"cancer cells from this perspective are"
"not more selfish it's just that their"
"cells are smaller so these cells are"
"perfectly selfish and they compete with"
"other organs in the body to make this"
"this nice limb and here these cells do"
"exactly the same thing it's just that"
"the the the boundary of the self is much"
"much smaller here so what we would like"
"to do"
"is uh to understand how do we reconnect"
"cells to these larger scale structures"
"so that they can pursue a patterning"
"program instead of a single cell"
"program and in particular"
"we we asked what are the signals that"
"keep individual subunits working towards"
"a larger scale goal now in the body it"
"looks like this every every cell is"
"sitting in this morphogenetic field of"
"information some of that information is"
"chemical some of it is biomechanical and"
"some of it is bioelectrical and"
"bioelectric bioelectricity is special"
"because uh evolution long ago"
"around the time of bacterial biofilms"
"evolution noticed that electricity was"
"an amazingly good way to"
"scale up computations and uh and and the"
"kinds of goals that these systems pursue"
"and in particular the brain of course is"
"a great inspiration for this because"
"there you see exactly what happens a"
"collection of individual cells neurons"
"are bound together into electrical"
"networks that can pursue long-term"
"memory prediction goal directed activity"
"and so on so let's look um how this"
"works so in the brain the hardware looks"
"like this there are large numbers of"
"these cells connected in networks"
"each of these cells each of these"
"neurons has ion channel proteins on"
"their surface because these channels can"
"pass charged molecules sodium potassium"
"chloride and so on in and out there ends"
"up a voltage gradient across this"
"membrane that electrical potential can"
"be propagated to their neighbors through"
"these little these little conduits"
"called the gap junctions and so there's"
"an electrical state it can propagate and"
"thus flow in various complex ways"
"through the network which represents"
"computations and those computations are"
"a kind of"
"electrical software this is imaging done"
"by this group beautiful imaging of a"
"living zebrafish brain"
"while the zebrafish is thinking about"
"whatever it is that zebrafish think"
"about and the commitment of neuroscience"
"is that this electrical activity is what"
"holds the cognition of that animal so"
"whatever memories plans preferences"
"whatever else it has if we knew what we"
"were doing we could decode this"
"electrical activity and we wouldn't know"
"what those things are and so there's"
"this goal of"
"of neural decoding to be able to read"
"the electrical activity of the brain and"
"to know what the animal is thinking"
"about so it turns out"
"for very good evolutionary reasons that"
"actually every cell in your body does"
"this so neurons did not invent this"
"trick from scratch they basically just"
"speed optimized things that your cells"
"were doing long before we had brains or"
"neurons so every cell in your body has"
"ion channels most of them have"
"gap junctions to their neighbors and one"
"can think about doing exactly the same"
"thing in the body that neuroscientists"
"have been trying to do in the brain to"
"read the electrical activity and to try"
"to decode it to ask what is the"
"collective thinking right in this case"
"the electrical activity is literally the"
"memory medium of the collective"
"intelligence of cells"
"the same way that electrical activity in"
"the brain is the memory medium of the"
"collective intelligence of neurons same"
"thing so let's look at some of these"
"patterns this um"
"this is a pattern uh discovered by my"
"colleague danny adams uh where we call"
"this the electric face and um when she"
"was a postdoc in my lab she used uh"
"voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes for"
"the first time to look at this frog"
"embryo as it was putting its face"
"together and what you can see is that"
"this is one frame from that video what"
"you can see is that even before the"
"genes come on they're going to pattern"
"this face into the various organs"
"already you can see that that this"
tissue
"is already"
"already has a pre pattern a memory of"
"where everything is going to go so"
"here's the animal's right eye this is"
"where it's going to be here's where the"
"mouth is going to be here are the"
"placodes and the way we make those"
"picasso tadpoles i showed you a minute"
"ago is simply by changing the"
"bioelectrical states which i'll tell you"
"shortly how i do that we change the"
"bioelectrical states which then causes"
"the cells to be uh to have a different"
"uh different pattern of what they should"
"be building and they build something"
"completely different so this is a normal"
"instructive pattern which is absolutely"
"required for normal development and in"
"fact humans with channelopathies often"
"have craniofacial defects for exactly"
"that um reason where the electric face"
"pattern is disrupted"
"this is an endogenous pattern what"
"you're seeing here is a pathological"
"pattern this this animal was injected"
"with a human oncogene it's going to make"
"a tumor the tumor is going to"
"metastasize but uh even before the tumor"
"becomes visually apparent you can"
"already see using this voltage-sensitive"
"fluorescent dye that these cells have an"
"aberrant electrical potential they've"
"closed their gap junctions they've"
"disconnected from the rest of the grid"
"and they're basically just reverting"
"back to their ancient unicellular self"
"so this is has obvious implications for"
"a diagnostics modality"
"so we developed some tools to uh to work"
"with this"
"uh one is of course the the the use of"
"these voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes"
"this is this is an early frog embryo"
"it's a time lapse of about oh probably"
"about eight hours uh where you get to"
"see all of the electrical conversations"
"that the cells are having with each"
"other as if they were neurons as if this"
"was a brain uh but this this tissue is"
"able to figure out who's going to be"
"head tail left right dorsal ventral so"
"we do the imaging then we do a lot of"
"computational modeling to say okay if we"
"know what the channels are can we guess"
"what the different voltages are going to"
"be and why the voltages are what they"
"are and then the most important thing is"
"learn so this is this is about reading"
"and understanding the electrical"
"patterns in the tissue now of course"
"what we want to do is to be able to"
"rewrite them so in order to rewrite them"
"we really only have two tricks"
"both borrowed from neuroscience"
"here's a particular tissue and uh what"
"we can do is we can control these"
"electrical synapses using either drugs"
"or or modifying the gap junctions in"
"various ways"
"or we can directly open and close the"
"ion channels and thus change the voltage"
"of each cell so i can either control who"
"talks to whom or i can control what is"
"the state of various cells and we don't"
"use any applied electric fields there"
"are no magnetics there are no waves"
"there are no frequencies"
"this is only molecular physiology this"
"is this is targeting the native"
"machinery that these cells use to set up"
"and communicate their their signals okay"
"so when we do this and you can use"
"optogenetics you can use all the"
"techniques of neuroscience you can um"
"what happens when you do this well"
"here's here's just one example one"
"example is that"
"we saw what it is that triggers eye"
"formation in the head and that's a"
"particular bioelectrical pattern and we"
"can induce that pattern by injecting rna"
"encoding a particular potassium channel"
"somewhere else let's let's introduce"
"that pattern into the gut so here's the"
"animal's gut we injected those cells"
"with a particular ion channel and here"
"what you can see is they built a very"
"nice eye out of uh gut cells because uh"
"that pattern is what tells the cells"
"what they should be building now if you"
"section these eyes they have the same"
"lens retina optic nerve they have all"
"the right components but there and there"
"are two amazing things about this one is"
that
that
"we didn't have to specify all the"
"details of how you build an eye this is"
"basically a subroutine call a trigger"
"that says to these cells build an eye"
"here all the downstream the molecular"
"genetics that that operates downstream"
"all the i specific genes everything else"
"is turned on so this is a trigger of a"
"module the other thing is that there are"
"two levels of instruction here the first"
"level is um"
"that we the these blue cell this is a"
"lens sitting out in the flank of a"
"tadpole somewhere the blue cells are the"
"ones whose voltage we modified with"
"these ion channels but there wasn't"
"enough of them to make a lens and so"
"what they did"
"was that they recruited a bunch of their"
"neighbors the neighbors that we didn't"
"directly modify at all and so so the"
"first level of instruction is us telling"
"these cells you need to make an eye and"
"the second level of instruction is these"
"cells uh"
"recruiting a bunch of their neighbors to"
"say that well there's not enough of us"
"you need to help out we're gonna we're"
"gonna all work together to make this eye"
"so there's there's communication from"
"the from from us and then there's the"
"communication between the cells"
now
"i want to show you one other"
"quick example of what i mean by a"
"pattern memory by this kind of"
"bioelectrical pattern memory here's one"
"of these flatworms here's a planarian"
"the gene expression of forehead genes"
"are in the anterior like it should be"
"and if you amputate the head and the"
tail
"this middle fragment will give you a"
"perfectly normal one-headed one-tailed"
"worm 100 of the time it's extremely"
stable
"now here's another one-headed worm same"
"gene expression everything is fine but"
"when we cut this worm we get two-headed"
"animals why would why would we get"
"two-headed animals so i just told you"
"it's a very um"
"reliable process and that's because in"
"the meantime we figured out this"
"electrical circuit that determines"
"enables the cells to know how many heads"
"a planarian is supposed to have and when"
"we modify this electrical pre-pattern"
"that normally says one head one tail we"
"can modify it to say two heads it's a"
"little bit messy the technology is still"
"being worked out but when you do that"
"this piece will end up making two heads"
"and now here's the really critical part"
"of this"
"this bioelectrical pattern is not a"
"readout of this two-headed animal"
"this bioelectrical pattern is a readout"
"of this perfectly normal anatomy of this"
"one-headed animal that means that a"
"one-headed body a normal body can store"
"at least one of two different"
"pictures of what a correct planarian"
"looks like it's a memory it's in fact"
"it's a counter counterfactual memory"
"it's not true now this animal doesn't"
"have two heads now but what it does have"
"is a representation of a planarian that"
"is going to have two heads if it gets"
"injured so it's a um"
"it's a kind of latent memory that"
"doesn't uh act i mean the animal doesn't"
"do anything until it gets injured when"
"it gets injured that's when the cells"
"consult this memory and"
"and decide that now they're going to"
"need to build two heads and the other"
"reason i call this a a a memory is that"
"if you then take these two headed"
"animals and and start cutting them in"
"plain water no more manipulation"
"they will continue to make two headed"
"animals in perpetuity forever uh and"
"then we can we now know how to set them"
"back to one headed so let's let's take"
"stock of what we have oh and here's a"
"video if you want to know what these"
"things do in their spare time this is um"
"two-headed animals uh hanging out"
"so uh let's let's just take stock of"
"what we have first of all you can"
"convert an animal into a one-headed form"
"or a two-headed form without touching"
"the genome there's no genomic editing"
"the genotype is wild type um"
"there is this this electrical memory it"
"has all the properties of memory it's"
"long-term stable it's rewritable or"
"labile it has conditional recall or"
"latency which i just showed you and it"
"has these discrete possible memories one"
"head to it so the answer to the question"
"what determines the number of heads in"
"the planarian is a little tricky it's"
"not specifically in the dna what the dna"
"gives you a is a machine with an"
"electrical circuit that reliably by"
"default generates a pattern that encodes"
"one head but it also has a learning"
"capacity where you can modify that"
"memory directly kind of like"
"a memory inception as neuroscience is"
"what it would do and you can modify that"
"memory directly and then it will have"
"two heads so the question uh how many"
"what controls the heads is actually"
"the state of the electrical pattern"
"memory that the cells use to figure out"
"what to do when they get injured in fact"
"not only can you get ectopic heads on"
"one animal you can get heads that are"
"appropriate to other species so here's"
"one planarian type with a triangular"
"head if we amputate the head and with a"
"for about 48 hours we use a drug that"
"prevents the cells from communicating"
"with each other electrically then we"
"pull them out of the drug let the"
"electric circuits settle down to a"
"stable state and sometimes about eight"
"percent of the time it settles down into"
"the correct uh uh the correct attractor"
"and you get your normal head but other"
times
"you get a round head like s"
"mediterranean or you get a flathead like"
"a p fellina they regrow the heads of"
"other species"
without
"any genomic changes so the genome is"
"still the same in fact they have the"
"head shapes and the stem cell"
"distributions of these other species so"
"in the amorphous space of all possible"
"planarian heads there are certain"
"attractors that are reachable by"
specific
"dynamics of the electrical circuit and"
"you can you can knock a perfectly"
"genetically normal animal into these"
"other attractors if you interface with"
"the physiological software directly now"
obviously
"this has uh implications for"
"regenerative medicine so we're working"
"on for example limb regeneration so"
"normally frogs don't regenerate their"
"limbs uh you can induce them to"
"regenerate their limbs with a cocktail"
"that puts these cells into a build-a-leg"
"here kind of state here they turn on uh"
"pro-regenerative genes like msx1 they"
"start immediately growing here's a"
"here's a leg with a toe a toenail and"
"some toes"
"eventually a very respectable leg that"
"is uh touch sensitive and motile so"
"these legs are quite functional the"
"amazing thing is that"
"the intervention with the bioelectric"
"signal takes place for 24 hours then we"
"don't touch it again the legs grow for a"
"year and a half okay so it's a it's an"
"early decision point are we going to"
"grow a leg or not once you've shifted"
"them to that decision point you don't"
"need to do anything else and we are now"
"uh doing this"
"uh and this is i have to do a disclosure"
"this is we have david kaplan and i have"
"a company called uh"
"morphaceuticals inc where we are trying"
"to take that technology using a wearable"
"bioreactor that contains the ion channel"
"drugs and we're trying to induce"
"regeneration of of limbs in in a"
"mammalian model and hopefully eventually"
"inpatient so what i've told you so far"
"is that just like in the brain there's a"
"there's a kind of a cognitive glue"
"mechanism that binds competent"
"individual cells towards a large scale"
"common purpose that purpose being"
"organogenesis and that that process it"
"can it can so it can"
"solve problems in this morpho space if"
"things are in a different location if"
"there's not enough cells too many cells"
"it's uh it's extremely flexible and it"
"uses bioelectrical uh communication to"
"uh to execute that kind of problem"
"solving and we can now modify that"
"electrical software in real time as i've"
"just shown you uh controlling the"
"formation of organs controlling axial"
"body polarity in these planaria"
"without any need for for genomic editing"
"of the hardware so now um the"
"all-important question can we harness"
"this approach to uh to control the"
"morphogenetic defections of cancer i've"
"already shown you that"
"uh you can use this to to diagnose so"
"these uh these voltage-sensitive um"
"fluorescent dru fluorescent dyes allow"
"us to see the cells before they defect"
"in fact one can imagine this is this is"
"just an artist's rendition but one can"
"imagine a tool like this a augmented"
"reality display where a doctor will be"
"able to"
"look down onto a um look down onto onto"
"a tumor during surgery and and see where"
"all the metastases and where the margins"
"are and so on by using their their"
"bioelectric so so this is that some of"
"this technology is going to go towards"
"diagnostics now one thing that we've"
"learned is that thinking about the"
"causes of of cancer is that the"
"this disease does not need to have a"
"genetic component so for example here's"
"a normal tadpole these little black"
"cells are melanocytes they're pigment"
"cells this animal where the melanocytes"
"have obviously overgrown like crazy uh"
"there's nothing genetically wrong with"
"it there are no oncogenes there have"
"been no carcinogens no no radiation all"
"that's happened is that a particular"
"cell type has been prevented from"
"communicating electrically with its"
"target and these cells go crazy in fact"
"not only do they do they make the animal"
"uh very very dark but here through in"
"cross section you can see this is what"
"normal melanocytes look like little"
"little small numbers of little nice"
"little round cells instead they they uh"
"they do this they they become highly"
"arborized they become these crazy long"
"projections they dip down into the into"
"the brain into the lumen of the neural"
"tube basically they start to invade and"
"metastasize they fill the blood vessels"
"right so so just like just like melanoma"
"uh this this is full-on melanoma in a"
"uh in an animal that has uh that has no"
"mutations and no carcinogenic um"
"exposure and it's triggered by a"
"disruption of electrical uh coordination"
"among cells now um"
"we can do this in uh in in this this is"
"this is also true in human melanocytes"
"and culture but there's an amazing"
"aspect of this the effect is not"
"on the cells themselves so these blue so"
"this is again a cross section through a"
"tapple these blue cells are the ones"
"that uh we targeted with our electrical"
"blocking rna"
"these these are the melanocytes that uh"
"that that converted to melanoma as a"
"result they're not the same cells the"
"the effect happens at a distance it"
"actually happens by serotonin by a"
"neurotransmitter signaling and um"
"and so now we can see that that"
"that cancer is a is is fundamentally a"
"physiological disorder of cell"
organization
"towards normally coordinated patterning"
"so so of course the best thing that we"
"want to do as opposed to uh to inducing"
"it we want to suppress it or or or"
"normalize it and we can do that so in"
"the frog you can inject these these"
"oncogenes uh for example human oncogenes"
"like nasty k-ras mutations they're"
"labeled in a red fluorescent protein so"
"here they are here's the here's the"
"tumor there's the oncoprotein"
"labeled in red and if you co-inject an"
"ion channel that prevents these cells"
"from disconnecting electrically from"
"their neighbors even though the"
"oncoprotein is blazingly strongly"
"expressed here it is in fact it's all"
"over the place here there's no tumor and"
"and it is a very very significant"
"reduction of of tumor because what what"
"matters is the physiology the physiology"
"trumps the genetic state despite the"
"mutation these cells when they're"
"connected to their neighbors will"
"continue to carry out their normal"
"morphogenetic duties you can do this"
"with with ion channels you can do this"
"with drugs you can do this with light so"
"here's an example of using um"
"optogenetic kinds of tools as one does"
"in the nervous system to uh to control"
"light gated channels and uh and knock"
"down the tumor burden in animals that"
"are bearing really tough kras mutations"
"in fact"
"uh we can we could look at uh sodium"
"channels here's a normal tadpole here's"
"a tumor induced by a particular sodium"
"sodium channel and just tweaking that"
"sodium channel slightly so that the"
"amount of sodium that gets in is a"
"little different instead of a tumor you"
"get an eye okay so the so the"
"determinant of whether or not a bunch of"
"cells make a tumor rni is not anything"
"about their genetics it's literally"
"environmental it's the amount of sodium"
"that gets in because the sodium is what"
"controls and you can do the same thing"
"with potassium and chloride"
"it's got nothing to do with dna damage"
"in these cases um it's uh it's it's all"
"about the the electrophysiology and so"
"we've been moving now from the frog and"
"this is this is literally uh this paper"
"just came out um a couple of days ago"
"this is uh the work of a number of"
"people led by juanita matthews and it"
"basically takes a bunch of novel um uh"
"uses for ion channel drugs that humans"
"already take so these are human approved"
"compounds that that normally target"
"target ion channels and in uh in rodent"
"and human glioblastoma cells what they"
"do is they knock down very strongly they"
"knock down the proliferation of these"
"cells even after the drug is removed the"
"the cells the the cell numbers continue"
"to drop or stay even and they partially"
"normalize these cells here they are"
"turning on connection 43 is actually a"
"gap junction right so these whereas"
"these cells were loners now they're"
"starting to differentiate they're"
"starting to"
"connect up to their neighbors again and"
"they're turning on this this tissue so"
"we're very we're very hopeful for for"
"moving this technology um from basic"
"science in the frog to uh some sort of"
"clinical application um soon"
"okay so uh so so to summarize uh cancer"
"can be caused by a disorder of pattern"
"regulation specifically the ability of"
"cells to cooperate towards large-scale"
"organogenesis uh electrical properties"
"now can be used to detect to induce and"
"to reprogram these kinds of cells"
"and the idea is that the behavior of"
"these electrical circuits controls cell"
"behavior and can be modified"
"physiologically and that we're now"
"looking for and finding pharmacological"
"and light-based strategies to do this so"
"the future steps of this research"
program
"are basically this we're trying to"
"refine that physiological signature so"
"to figure out uh diagnostics for for"
"either for surgery or for or for"
"personal you know personal use in"
"scanning cancer screening"
"we want to refine these voltage control"
"methods for mammalian systems right and"
"the big picture here is to crack this"
"bioelectric coat to really understand"
"the mapping between specific patterns of"
"bioelectricity and outcomes such as eye"
"leg heart"
"limb and so on"
"and so that so that we can use existing"
"ion channels as as a huge toolkit of"
"electroceutical so something like 20 of"
"all um drugs that people take are"
"in some way uh ion channel modifier"
"drugs and all of that it can be"
"repurposed for"
"modifying uh the the behavior of"
"electrical networks so um so in the last"
"in the last few slides i i want to uh"
"come back out of this sort of medical"
"focus and think about what this means in"
"terms of evolution"
"uh i"
"i started out by saying that uh the"
"basics the basic condition of cells is"
"as individual single-celled organisms"
"who who are going to try to reproduce"
"and do various things and it is uh"
"multicellularity is a way to harness"
"them and and prevent them from doing"
"things and enable them to do other"
"things and and really really to control"
"them so"
"so let's let's let's look at a really a"
"very um very i think profound example of"
"of this of this idea of what is the"
"let's think about what is the basic"
"state of of certain cells let's think"
"about skin cells in the embryo now"
"one thing you might think is that the"
"the baseline uh"
"kind of"
"baseline behavior of skin cells is to be"
"a have a sort of boring two-dimensional"
"life on the outside of the animal"
"keeping out the bacteria keep out the"
"pathogens and just sort of sit there and"
"not do much and we wanted to to think"
"about this in this in the context of"
"figuring out what genomes actually do"
"and it's it's not as obvious as you"
"might think and also um"
"to understand what kind of baseline"
"behaviors and cells are the result of"
"their control by a collective and so"
"this is uh this is largely the work of"
"doug blackiston in my group and he"
"did the following experiment we took an"
"early frog embryo we took some of these"
"uh early skin cells okay and we"
"basically set them aside into their own"
"in their own little dish we didn't add"
"anything we didn't change the genome we"
"didn't put in new genes or nano"
"materials or or drugs or anything but we"
"took something away what we took away"
"was the rest of the animal so we"
"basically asked these skin cells to"
"reboot their multicellularity now in the"
"absence of all the normal cells what do"
"you want to do now right you're free now"
"there's a number of things they could"
"have done they could have died for lack"
"of proper neighbors they could have done"
"absolutely nothing and sat there they"
"could have spread out away from each"
"other they could have formed a monolayer"
"like a cell culture and they didn't do"
"any of that what they did was this"
"so here they are here the the cells"
"being put into this little depression"
"and what they do overnight is they"
"coalesce they get together and then they"
"form um"
"they form this interesting around"
"spherical structure and this uh and and"
"what you see the the the flashes here"
"are calcium signaling looks very"
"brain-like remember there's no neurons"
"here it's just skin and what this little"
"what this little thing does which we"
"call them xenobots a xenobots for"
"xenopus lavis is the name of the frog"
"this is what they do they take the"
"little hairs that skin has on its"
"surface to keep the mucus flowing down"
"the side of the frog and they use them"
"as little oars to swim along so they"
"have swimming activity they can they can"
"go in circles like this they can patrol"
"back and forth like this guy here's some"
"tracking data on some collective"
"behavior so here they are these are"
"interacting with each other this one is"
"going on some sort of long journey"
"these are just sitting there doing"
"nothing so they have a wide range of"
"motile behaviors again just skin okay"
"this is this is what skin does when left"
"to its own devices uh when when it's"
"when it's taken away from the"
"restrictive influence of the rest of the"
"cells it becomes a a novel"
"proto-organism that repurposes"
"its genomically specified hardware for"
"new activities um here it is uh in a"
"in a maze of water so you can see what"
"it does it swims along uh it's gonna"
"take this corner it doesn't need to bump"
"into the opposite wall it takes the"
"corner at this point for whatever reason"
"that nobody knows it decides to turn"
"around and go backwards came from"
"so it just has it has some sort of"
"internal dynamics that allow it to um"
"change its behavior um on on the fly so"
"here it is it's going to go down here"
"and at this point it just turns around"
"and goes back"
"these uh we can we can use the same"
"technologies uh with these in terms of"
"calcium imaging and signal analysis to"
"ask what are these cells saying to each"
"other that enable them to make this"
"completely novel proto-organism and what"
"might two zenobots be saying to each"
"other they have another uh i just want"
"to show you one more amazing capacity"
"that they have which is this"
"these xenobots don't have the ability to"
"reproduce the way that frogs normally"
"reproduce because because all of those"
"types of tissues are gone so within 48"
"hours they discover a new solution to"
"this problem and the solution is this if"
"you sprinkle loose skin cells in their"
"vicinity what they will do is they will"
"run around and they will collect these"
"skin cells into little little piles"
"little balls they will um"
"continue to uh sort of polish both both"
"in groups and individually they will"
"continue to polish and coalesce these"
"little balls and you can see them you"
"can see them here and because they're"
"working with the skin cells that are the"
"again in a gentle material meaning it's"
"a material with an agenda it's not a"
"passive it's not a passive material it's"
"not even a merely an active material"
"what these cells do when you push them"
"into a little ball like this is they"
"become more xenobots so this is"
"kinematic self-replication each of these"
"zenobots is making copies of itself new"
"xenobots out of loose material that it"
"finds in the environment this is von"
"neumann's uh idea for for machines that"
"go around and make copies of themselves"
"from materials they find nearby"
"so they make multiple generations so"
"each generation of bots does exactly"
"what we as engineers do with they find"
"the loose cells"
"put them push them into into piles and"
"then rely on the cells themselves to do"
"the rest the cells do all the heavy"
"lifting the engineers and and the bots"
"themselves are fairly minor actors in"
"all this i mean of course it doesn't"
"happen without them but"
"but but the cells uh all of this works"
"because once pushed into piles the cells"
"know what to do they become the next"
"generation of xenobots okay so so this"
"is kinematic self-replication as far as"
"we know no other animal on earth does"
"this it's completely novel"
"so here are here are some some some deep"
"implications of this um"
"all of these what you just saw as as a"
"completely normal xenopus-levis genome"
so
"the zen so the frog genome can"
"do one of at least two probably many"
"more things they can produce here's a"
"here's the normal development of of of"
"the frog and then here's the kind of"
"behavior here's tadpoles running around"
"or in a sli in a different configuration"
"it can make these zenobots now where did"
"this capacity come from there is you"
"know when we ask why do tadpoles have"
"certain features"
"like with any any"
"life form the answer is always the same"
"for millions of years selection forces"
"shaped it to do this and that so they"
"could survive well there's never been"
"any zenobots there's never been"
"selection force to be a good xenobot"
"these cells are able to"
"solve all these problems in novel"
"configurations from scratch and this is"
"the developmental sequence i have no"
"idea what this is and i this is you know"
"over over two months the zenobots turn"
"into this this is their nor this is"
"their developmental sequence this is"
"them um acting you know in their in"
"their behaviors"
"so uh what we see here is that evolution"
"doesn't just give us solutions to a"
"particular environment let's say a frog"
"being a solution to a kind of niche"
"where the frogs can prosper it actually"
"makes a machine that can solve many"
"different kinds of problems and make"
"different kinds of organisms and the"
"ability of individual cells to work"
"together to make one thing rather than"
"another thing is exactly at the root of"
"not only development evolution and"
"regeneration but also cancer this is"
"really the key to this whole problem is"
"to understand under what circumstances"
"do cells cooperate to do one thing than"
"another and what is the role of the"
"genome you know the genome nails down"
"the hardware for these cells they have"
"they have the proteins that they're"
"supposed to have and then the question"
"is at the level of software what is that"
"hardware going to do and the hardware is"
"amazing biological hardware is"
"incredibly clever and uh we need to take"
"advantage of this collective"
"intelligence to uh repair it in cases of"
"cancer as opposed to trying to"
"micromanage from the bottom up the"
"molecular pathways so um i just want to"
"thank uh the people who did all the work"
"that i showed you today um here they are"
"amazingly uh talented um uh postdocs and"
"grad students i want to uh thank the"
"animals that we work with uh they do all"
"the uh all the all the hard work um the"
"our our various funders and again the"
"disclosures for morphaceuticals and uh"
"thank you very much we can talk about it"
"totally amazing mike and uh you know i"
"know we've had a couple of comments in"
"the chat saying that it was amazing and"
"people want to watch this again and i"
"know i certainly do there's so much"
there
"so i'll turn over to paul"
"well let me echo that uh"
"sentiment so pauline just expressed"
"every time i hear"
"about your work mike i am blown away and"
"uh i've got a notepad in front of me and"
"it's absolutely covered with questions"
"and of course we can only touch on a few"
"things um i suppose the physicist in me"
"always comes to the fore when i hear"
"these accounts and i uh ask myself well"
"what's going on"
"um and uh"
"the to me the deepest mystery is that uh"
"clearly when we're talking about say"
regeneration
"uh the"
"that morphological information the"
"information about the shape the size of"
"the men and the set of instructions when"
"it should stop growing all of that you"
"know has to come from somewhere i guess"
"it's stored somewhere obviously not in"
"jeans it's obviously distributed"
"and the question is over what sort of"
"scale and my first thought is well"
"you chop a worm in two"
"uh maybe it's just around the wound"
but
"i think that's that's a bit naive are"
"you able to pin down"
"just uh"
"does it involve the whole organism or a"
"patch of the organism or"
"have you got anywhere any idea sure yeah"
"yeah it it absolutely is not just that"
"the wound and we already know that just"
"from sort of um"
"from from very very simple ancient"
"experiments uh and the more modern stuff"
"that we've done shows that it's in fact"
"throughout the whole body so in a"
"froglet if you amputate one of the legs"
"the other leg and you track"
"bioelectricity the other leg within 30"
"seconds lights up at the same location"
"and you can tell from that signal you"
"can tell what kind of damage it was and"
"where on the leg it was so cells across"
"the body"
"know what's going on when we do our"
"brain repair work you can do it from the"
"belly side as well as you can from the"
"dorsal side where the brain actually is"
"so this information spreads throughout"
"the whole body"
"and uh we can see it when you when you"
"look when you look for the bioelectrical"
"patterns they're quite large they span"
"they span the whole the whole body and"
"we because the nice thing about the frog"
"is that from the very first moments of"
"development right the the fertilization"
"of the egg it's right there in front of"
"you so you can see the patterns form so"
"we know where they come from where they"
"come from"
"is the spontaneous symmetry breaking and"
"self-organization of the electrical"
"circuit that's distributed in a set of"
"cells so you can imagine and and i have"
"lots of we have lots of computational"
"models that that i can show you that"
"show exactly how this works when you"
"have a set of cells let's say a"
"two-dimensional uh sheet uh you know an"
"epithelial tissue uh every cell has the"
"exact same electrical circuit dictated"
"by the genetics but that becomes an"
"excitable medium that will break"
"symmetry and spontaneously self-organize"
"certain kinds of patterns which patterns"
"will that determine is determined by"
"what ion channels they have and what gap"
"junctions they have and that's what"
"evolution tinkers with but once you have"
"the correct set of channels there is a a"
"self-organization of a pattern and the"
"rest of the tissue uses that pattern as"
"a reference point so error dv anatomical"
"deviation from that rough uh you know"
"rough sort of pattern things are very"
"something's very simple you know one"
"head one tail that's it and something's"
"quite complex like the like the like the"
"electric face all of those are um"
"uh spontaneous uh uh self-organization"
"of an electrical circuit with uh"
"components that were were were finely"
"honed by evolution"
"yeah we're used to uh people talking"
"about morphogenetic fields"
and
"it goes back to alan turing and"
"the assumption has always been that this"
is
"uh chemical gradients"
that
"are set up in some way presumably"
"coupled to as we would now know coupled"
to
"gene regulatory networks so you've got"
"chemical networks and you've got gene"
"networks but you've obviously got"
"electrical networks as well and i assume"
"the full story we've been uh"
"understanding how all three of these"
"will couple together plus possibly"
"mechanical that's right that's right"
"this this is absolutely true yeah um"
"it it is and the full the full uh set of"
"processes from beginning to end"
"encompass electrical signals uh"
"biomechanical signals and molecular"
"types of gradients but one can ask an"
"interesting question about all of this"
"one one can ask instead of tracking"
"every single detail that happens here"
"could we coarse grain this in an"
"important way could we ask what is the"
"causal structure of this network such"
"that uh what are the what are the states"
"that have the most uh bang for your buck"
"in terms of control i mean i can go in"
"and i can try to micromanage it by"
"single-handedly directly turning on and"
"off each cell each gene at the right"
"time right so so you know sort of um and"
"you could do that you could micromanage"
"it this way or you can ask but what you"
"can ask what are the master control"
"states that when if i trigger them will"
"percolate down through the rest of the"
"network and give me the the most"
"coherent powerful anatomical change for"
"the least amount of input that's how"
"that's how we look at this of course all"
"these things are important but we want"
"the upstream controller right we don't"
"want to micromanage we want to know"
"where is the decision made and"
"temporally the decision is made in"
"almost every case that we've studied"
"it's made in the bioelectric circuit"
"after injury uh in the first three hours"
the
"in the worm for example in the first"
"three to six hours the bioelectric"
"circuit makes a decision of what it's"
"going to do and then over the next uh 18"
"to 24 hours all the gradients become"
"established all the the the"
"the morphogens the the genes turn on and"
"off the distinguished head from tail all"
"that stuff kicks on"
"subsequently and so in the examples and"
"i'm not saying it will always be this"
"way but the examples that we've seen"
"uh the bioelectrics gives us"
"a particular a uniquely powerful layer"
"of the system that holds large-scale"
"coarse-grained states where you don't"
"have to micromanage you know it's the i"
"always think of this is this is"
"obviously very very primitive on the"
"with respect to the physics but i always"
"think about this in terms of boyle's law"
"and things like that versus trying to"
"trying to control you know where every"
"individual molecule of the gas is going"
"the difference being that right so so"
"the difference being that the biologists"
"today because of all the fancy um"
"uh uh high throughput techniques we"
"we're starting to get this idea that you"
"know maybe we could track every molecule"
"of the gas and as a result right you"
"could you could probably watch every"
"gene all the time someday that will be"
"possible and so i think we're missing"
"out on these mesoscale laws that are"
"actually incredibly powerful and up and"
"um and and hold uh really the"
"understanding not just the micro level"
"prediction but actually the"
"understanding of um the rules of the"
system
"now we've got a lot of questions backing"
"out can we go into some of them paul i'd"
"like we should i've got just one more"
"thing i'd like to ask but i'd say really"
"yeah let's let's do the let's do some of"
"the questions and um"
"you know we can stay on the line i know"
"some people will have to go at um two"
"o'clock but we can keep going for a"
"little bit longer let's go to barbara's"
"first one how are well it's her third"
"one how are the electrical memories"
"encoded and stored"
"yeah um they're they're they're stored"
"in the uh stable state of the electrical"
"circuit so so imagine that you have a"
"tissue every cell in that tissue has"
"exactly the same ion channels and"
"they're coupled by gab junction so you"
"basically have"
"you basically have a uh an excitable"
"medium that has that has the property"
"that it will um it will store a"
"distribution of resting potential for"
"long periods of time that's how it's"
"stored it's stored it's literally an"
"electrical memory related to a memory in"
"the brain not exactly the same mechanism"
"and um yeah and it's and you can and you"
"can see these electrical states we have"
"a we have a you know very nice uh"
"computational models that show you uh"
"how they're how they're stable um"
"and uh and and that's and that's what it"
"is and you can rewrite them"
"at will if you have a computational tool"
"which we're beginning to build now that"
"tells you"
"which channels do i need to open and"
"close to change the pattern to a"
"different uh to a different pattern"
okay
um
"next one"
"from sergio are you effectively updating"
"the cellular software to recruit current"
"living cells without inducing the"
"formation of new cells"
uh
"yeah depending on depending on which"
"which system you're talking about we can"
"definitely rearrange existing cells"
"many of these contexts do"
"uh involve production of new cells but"
"but that's not that's not necessary we"
"can have so for example in the zenobot"
system
"there isn't much cell proliferation it's"
"what the cells you have are the cells"
"you're working with in planaria they're"
"definitely new cells that definitely do"
"appear during the during the repair"
process
"okay so i thought we go to one um in the"
"chat and this is from ammon"
"and he's very complimentary talk was"
"amazing i wonder if there's been any"
"work done on analyzing eprom like"
"properties of cancer cells i don't know"
"if you know what that they are"
"especially in breast cancer"
"yeah we we have done we have done some"
"work and um this is with uh with with"
"madeleine udain uh"
"uh we have done some work on the"
"biologics of breast cancer um the the"
"the one thing to just to say is that"
"it's not necessarily the properties of"
"the individual cells the network is most"
"important so it's the environment it's"
"the other cells and it's the"
"cells that are going to be transformed"
"so the whole you know you have to look"
"at it for as a network but yeah we have"
"we have done some work on that"
"um so michaels is saying how do you"
"control for the effects of autocrine and"
paracrine
"chemical cell signaling could it be that"
"the electrics are an effect"
"or the effect"
"or non-effect correlate"
"yeah um well first of all uh absolutely"
"the autocrine and paracrine and and all"
"of the other um you know distribution of"
"morphogens and and gr all of that stuff"
"absolutely happens in the sense that in"
"order to make an eye you do need to turn"
"on genes that are going to encode you"
"know be for beta crystalline for the"
"lens and for all these all these kinds"
"of things"
"they are all downstream and we know this"
because
"we can very specifically change the"
"voltage using either"
"sodium potassium chloride the the"
"channel doesn't matter doesn't really"
"matter the ion doesn't matter as long as"
"you get the voltage right when you"
"change the voltage all of the the"
"distribution of the bioelectrics the"
"downstream genes we know all the genes"
"that are downstream we know uh the"
"distribution of morphogens in many of"
"these cases all of that stuff will"
"follow hours after you tweak the voltage"
"now sometimes there are feedback loops"
"because some of those things go back in"
"turn and control channel channel opening"
"and closing and that actually the the"
"evolution of the system"
"uh involves back and forth between the"
"electrical and the biochemical but uh in"
"every case that we've looked at and"
"we've even tried cases where we make"
"them um uh we we make them fight so so"
"we put in uh let's say in in human uh"
"mesenchymal stem cells will put in a"
"chemical inducer of differentiation but"
"then keep a voltage in the state that"
"says don't differentiate so try to pit"
"them against each other in every case"
"that we've seen so far uh the the"
"again not saying that that's always"
"going to be that way but this is what"
"what we've seen so far uh the the"
"bioelectrics is is the driver and uh"
"downstream and the other stuff is"
"downstream including sometimes feedbacks"
"back but but the the bioelectric circuit"
is
"the most"
"efficient uh master regulator of what's"
"going to happen downstream including all"
"of the autocrine and paracrine signaling"
okay
"ryan these cancer cells that exist in"
"fully developed tumors and are forced to"
"reconnect their surrounding tissues do"
"we see these cells start to normalize"
"their function or are they more likely"
"to cease"
"function and self-destruct"
"great question uh there's much more"
"needs to be done on this we only have"
"limited information in the frog"
"they resume normal function so they"
"crawl off they join other tissues you"
"can track them they join other tissues"
"and they have a normal life as other"
"other types of tissues in the"
"in the human case that we just started"
"looking at in the glioblastoma"
"some of them turn on senescence markers"
"and they sort of uh um"
"just quiet down and and do nothing and"
"uh and others turn on differentiation"
"markers which look like they're on their"
"way to becoming normal neurons so so at"
"this point with the drugs that we have"
"now which are just the first pass of"
"this uh there's kind of a mix of both"
"there's a kind of quiescence but also"
"some normalization"
"right and a question from ashley large"
"scale quantum biology question mark if"
"non-living systems are non-coherent"
"entropy noise etc could this be global"
electric
"photon coherence for example"
"fizz pop does this pop mean anything"
"yeah yeah i i know what you mean uh so"
"so ultra weak photon emission and fritz"
"albert pop um the kind of stuff that he"
"studied i i think i think that that"
"mode of signaling is very interesting we"
"don't have any evidence that that's"
"what's going on here it might but but"
"everything that we've done so far obeys"
"pretty nicely a standard"
"electrophysiology rules that don't"
"really require at least as far as i can"
"tell for now they don't require"
"any kind of quantum modifications or"
"taking taking into account the photons"
but
"who knows what what we'll see in the"
"future well"
"i just want to ask my own very basic"
"question from right at the start you've"
"got your planaria and you say if they"
"get damaged they um just develop new"
"parts so that they in effect can't be"
"killed is that and that's true so you"
"can you know they just can't die from an"
"accident they would have poisoned would"
"they or how would you care"
"they're not invulnerable so you can"
"certainly squish one uh you know they"
"can be killed for sure uh but uh but the"
typical
"um you know cutting them into pieces"
"doesn't do it uh cutting them either the"
"pieces will continue to uh to to"
"regenerate so literally the record i"
"think is you know thomas hunt morgan in"
"1903 or something cut there's a paper"
"where he cut them into 275 pieces and"
"and those pieces still regenerate okay"
"oh well so we're going to be carrying on"
"but i just want to um tell people what's"
"going to happen"
"in our uh next talk which will be in a"
"month's time and um on the 15th of april"
"so look out for this one um cancer in"
"our cancer in the nature of life series"
"is going to be can cancer jump species"
"with michael metzger and he's shown that"
"it can actually he works for on clams"
"and muscles does amazing work so do come"
"and see that talk on the 15th of april"
"um so thank you and for everyone who's"
"joined and we're going to carry on for a"
"few minutes because this is so"
"fascinating if you're willing mike sure"
"sure absolutely so paul would you like"
"to carry on your conversation yes i've"
"got as i said a whole host of questions"
"but here's one that i don't expect you"
"know the answer to uh mike but i think"
"it's an interesting thought so um this"
uh
"membrane potential is essential for life"
"that uh"
"that it's achieved normally by pumping"
"ions from the inside of the cell to the"
"outside and these pumps have developed"
over
"billions of years um and so uh in a in a"
"normal healthy condition there'll be"
"what a few hundred millivolts uh"
"potential difference across the cell"
"membrane um and so what i"
"don't know i'd be interested to know is"
"uh the genes that control"
"that uh"
"that process of maintaining the correct"
"uh potential are they very ancient genes"
"you would expect them to be and and"
"would the genes that control it in"
"eukaryotic cells be"
"be simply homologues of those ancient"
"ones or more recently evolved or do we"
"know anything at all about the genetic"
"backstory are we underpinning this"
"electrical control sure sure um"
"extremely ancient genes extremely"
"ancient uh some of the most well"
"conserved uh ever so so so maybe the"
"most interesting one that you want to"
"think about"
"is called a v atpase it's a proton pump"
um
"it's uh it's found it's conserved uh"
"ever almost almost completely conserved"
"everywhere and if you uh"
"once once we um"
"we looked at uh uh rna rna-seq data you"
"know transcriptional profiling data of"
"experiments on regeneration in uh in in"
"in deer in axolotl in um"
"zebrafish in frog and in plants right so"
"across independent origins of"
"multicellularity when you look at all"
"the genes that are involved in"
"regeneration and all of these across"
"kingdoms you know all these different"
"things there is only one gene that is"
"common to them all that's involved in"
"regeneration that gene is the v atpase"
"and it is it is incredibly ancient uh it"
"it's what powers um uh it's it's related"
"to the mitochondrial uh energy pump it"
"runs backwards it's basically a"
"backwards running version of the"
"mitochondrial energy producing pump"
"i've got another question from almond"
"he's reading a few papers"
"over expression of potassium channel in"
cancers
"could you kindly comment a little more"
"on that"
um
"if so what's the impression"
"thanks for your response"
"yeah um potassium channels yeah yeah but"
"so so so the the key um"
"the way we the way we look at this is is"
"the key is uh the the"
"the status of the cell in the electrical"
"network of the tissue which is"
"determined by"
"its voltage and its gap junction"
"connectivity and that in turn is uh"
"dependent on the various channels that"
"the cell is using most uh mammalian and"
"i guess vertebrate cells in general rely"
"very heavily on potassium channels"
insects
"sometimes go for chloride and so on but"
"but um"
"yeah potassium channels are really"
"critical and lots of people are now"
"looking at"
"potassium channels as oncogenes and"
"potassium channel drugs as uh putative"
"cancer drugs but i think the difference"
"the one difference between uh what we're"
"doing and um what what uh other people"
"have done on this is that"
"you know you can treat these channels as"
"a cancer target the way that you would"
"let's say a transcription factor or any"
"other protein you know you might find it"
"upregulated so you try to knock it down"
"in the tumor things like that"
"i i think that that approach is going to"
"have a limited value i think it will it"
"will work in some cases but in the end"
"the the problem is that"
"it's still an approach focused on the"
"hardware the point isn't to get rid of"
"the channel because the channel can be"
"open or closed and you're going to have"
"some cases where you want the channel"
"open other cases you're going to have"
"one at close we should not be tracking"
the
"expression level or the presence of the"
"channel we should be tracking the"
"information that it's exchanging with"
"the tissue by virtue of the voltage that"
"that channel produces it's the the"
"physiological state is the trigger not"
"the presence or the absence of the"
"channel so so i think um"
"you know there's there's huge"
"opportunities for using potassium"
"channel modulation in terms of drugs"
"potassium potassium channel um you know"
uh
"targeting in within various ways to"
"control that that information flow not"
"just the presence of the gene or the"
"protein but the information flow"
"barbara um i had a an earlier question"
and
"mike answered one of barbara's questions"
"about the um"
uh
"planaria being chopped up"
"through subsequent generations but she"
"also asked a question that i was going"
"to ask which is um"
that
"we've known you for a number of years"
"mike and followed this amazing story um"
"but would you say it's not yet"
"mainstream and if it's not"
"shouldn't it be"
"um i i have no complaints uh the though"
"you know we've worked very hard"
"there are in the current developmental"
"biology textbook there are three stories"
"now based on the work that we've done um"
"i don't know if it's mainstream uh"
"certainly uh it's it's in uh you know"
"the last review i did on this was in"
"cell which is about as mainstream as it"
"gets so i have no complaints uh i will"
"say that um"
"this this is the bioelectrics"
"is has gotten a late start relative to"
"other aspects of"
"of molecular biosciences for a couple of"
"reasons um"
"people actually the the importance of"
"biologics was obvious to people at the"
"turn of the last century already people"
"like thomas hunt morgan and some of the"
"other um"
"forefathers of developmental biology"
"were already talking about the"
"importance of currents but the problem"
"is that unlike uh molecular biology and"
"biochemistry where you can take a cell"
"fractionate it into pieces uh fix it"
"with with formaldehyde take all the"
"proteins the the the rnas the you know"
"the sugars everything else and and"
"analyze them in the dead state"
"bioelectrics doesn't let you do that the"
"minute the cell dies this is all gone so"
"you have to do everything in the living"
"state that is extremely hard"
"only only recently i mean we we"
"basically made the first tools around"
"2000 we made the first tools to start"
"reading and writing this information in"
"the living state and you know prior to"
"that there were older techniques of"
"electrophysiology and applying currents"
"with electrodes and so on but but but"
"the modern tools only appeared"
"relatively recently um and and the other"
"thing is that um"
the
"the formalisms needed to understand"
"what's going on here are"
uh
"very multi-disciplinary so so much like"
"in neuroscience you have a multi-scale"
"interpretation issue here uh you have to"
"use uh all kinds of uh techniques from"
"from from from computer science from"
"from from physics from cognitive science"
"it's this is this is a a a of an"
"extremely exciting emerging field and i"
"think uh there's gonna be way more in"
"the future but like i said i have no"
"complaints about where we are now"
"only did i get that right"
"i think you did"
"it's uh"
"yes it was very close to the question i"
"think i think she might have been"
"implying when she said mainstream would"
"it be actually be used clinically at"
"some stage that's what the implication"
"was to me"
and
"well uh i mean at this point"
"the uh"
"i mean yes and no uh there are numerous"
"ion channel drugs used for various"
"things they have not uh they've not yet"
"been used let's say for regenerative"
"medicine that's what we're trying to do"
"now so that's so we have this company"
"morphoceutical that's exactly what it's"
"trying to do it's trying to um uh re uh"
"start to deploy these uh these ion"
"channel drugs for"
uh
"uh for purposes of regeneration you know"
"and cancer as well and someday some of"
"the birth defects so so i think you know"
"just starting it's there's no i don't"
"you know we don't have a we don't have"
"an actual application in patients yet"
"i think that's been wonderful"
"and i want to thank you mike on behalf"
"of all of us it's been the most amazing"
"talk um i'm sure you would agree paul"
"and absolutely yeah so my notebook is"
"still full of questions"
"yeah you can deal with those uh by email"
"thank you so much and thank you"
"everybody for all the for all the"
"questions yeah great thank you and if"
"you want more information about mike's"
"work go to his website at tufts"
"university you'll easily find it so"
"thank you again and this will um be the"
"recording will be on our website on the"
arizona
"cancer evolution website so great great"
"yeah thank you so much thank you"
everyone
"good to see you man yeah great to see"
"you thanks"
