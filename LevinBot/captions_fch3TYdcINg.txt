"i am here with two very distinguished"
"gentlemen i'm in fact i'm thrilled to"
"have them both here today i i wasn't"
"sure this was actually gonna work but it"
"did i've got"
"michael levin from tufts university and"
"i did a podcast with him"
"um a couple years ago called"
"picasso tadpoles and the dark matter of"
"biology which"
"got got a lot of um comments and and"
"stuff and we've since"
"been working together"
"in several capacities"
"and he he helped me with a paper that i"
"wrote last year"
"i've been helping with him"
"with our science foundation so a lot of"
"interesting things there you'll hear"
"more about um don hoffman"
is
"a cognitive psychologist and a professor"
"at the department of cognitive sciences"
"at uc irvine and he is author"
"of this book that you see here called"
"the case against reality how evolution"
"hid the truth from our eyes"
"and uh both of these folks"
"have very interesting views about"
consciousness
"and cognition"
"and and i think"
"cognition if uh"
"you several words agency consciousness"
cognition
"i think is the central issue in biology"
"and i think for a long time would you"
guys
"agree that in some circles"
"for a long time this was like a"
"red-headed step-child like"
"nobody really wants to"
"genuinely acknowledge the"
"like how important this is i mean"
"am i overstating at all by saying that"
"not at all i remember when i was a"
"graduate student at mit"
"you couldn't talk about consciousness"
"for example"
"if you if you talked about consciousness"
"that showed that you weren't a real"
serious
"student and probably weren't worth"
"people's time"
"so i i had to work on it sort of just"
"under other names like perception and so"
"forth but when when francis crick in the"
"early 90s late 80s early 90s said hey"
"you know we really need to jump on this"
"then then it became more more"
respectable
"so you would have a you would have a"
"conscious experience of having a very"
unpleasant
day
"if you made too much of of consciousness"
"right well"
"so i just didn't do it"
[Laughter]
"well i was just gonna say yeah i think"
"that's absolutely true and and worse yet"
"there are many places that you can't"
"even talk about cognition never mind"
"consciousness so"
"uh there are of course departments where"
"we study the brain and then cognition is"
"fine and then you go next door and maybe"
"it's a molecular biology department or"
"something like this and now never mind"
"consciousness now cognition is out too"
"and and now you're supposed to talk"
"about chemistry"
"and uh and so yeah well so i think"
"there's a very interesting"
"overlap between your work and"
"i'm i'm not entirely clear on"
"you know where you guys are 100"
"sympatico and where you might disagree"
"i'm probably going to find out today but"
"michael i'll i'll start with you"
um
"you have this"
extremely
"let's start with"
"you told me a story when i saw you in"
"person last summer"
"that you went into computer science"
because
"you wanted to figure out"
"artificial intelligence and like how are"
we
"some how are we going to make a brain an"
"artificial brain and like how how can"
"all that kind of stuff work in it"
"and you ended up realizing well"
"it's actually the biology people that"
"we're going to have to go look at if"
"we're going to figure this out can you"
"uh explain how that"
uh
"the inception of that and how that path"
"went for you"
"yeah i think i think the easiest way to"
"think about this is simply that i mean i"
"was always interested in mind and this"
"idea that there are some objects in our"
"world that seem to have preferences they"
"seem to have memories they seem to have"
"the ability to expend energy towards"
"certain kinds of outcomes and not others"
"and that that that's a very and and"
"their competency at doing that is widely"
"differing right"
"and so uh"
"you know we really uh it it was really"
"fascinating to me to find out what the"
"difference was right what are the what's"
"the difference between a complex piece"
"of engineering that we put together"
"versus one of these um"
"uh one of these kinds of"
"creatures that has intrinsic kinds of"
"motivation and so on and so the easy the"
"reason that this leads to biology is"
"simply this we we all all of us took the"
"journey across the cartesian cut we all"
"started life as a bag of chemicals right"
"as an oocyte as an unfertilized egg and"
"so so that's that's a bag of chemicals"
"you can look at it you can say and and"
"some people will say that that's just"
"physics whatever that means they will"
"say you know this is a this is a"
"mechanistic system it's just physics"
"there's no cognition there fine"
"then eventually you become"
"not that much longer thereafter so nine"
"months plus some years thereafter you"
"become this this creature with complex"
"metacognition cells you know"
"self-awareness and people and and you"
"become maybe one of the folks that will"
"make claims like i have true you know"
"cognition the rest of you know there's"
"no way machines can do x y z i have the"
"real thing"
"but you got there very smoothly and"
"slowly from a bag of chemicals right"
"both evolutionarily and of course"
"developmentally so so that's the thing"
"that drives me is this idea that there"
"was no lightning flash at you know day"
"71 where aha now you're a cognitive"
"system no every every day something very"
"very small changes happen and you sort"
"of rearranged your structures and so on"
"and then you went from physics to"
"cognition and how does that happen so"
"that's that's what drives me is this is"
"the idea of this continuum the fact that"
"we change slowly and we change"
"profoundly and and and how does that how"
"does that happen and when was it that"
"you realized"
"that the computer science guys weren't"
"the guys"
"that had this figured out"
"well um let me let me turn it on its"
"head uh i mean i i i"
"realized that in in undergrad i mean i"
"went there primarily to do machine"
"learning and artificial intelligence and"
"and and realized that uh yeah we didn't"
"seem to know how to do that but i i i"
"i'll sort of put it on its head by"
"saying that i still think that what i do"
"is computer science it's it's in living"
"media but i think it's a branch i think"
"it's a branch of computer science and i"
"don't think there's any you know i don't"
"want to come off as saying that"
"computer science is somehow limited and"
"we have to go outside the field i"
"actually think in many ways what we're"
"interested in in biology is basically a"
"branch of"
"the science of computation not the"
"science of computers as we know them but"
"the signs of computation done in"
"unconventional media"
"okay okay that's that's great and so"
"and and just so tell a little more more"
"of the story so"
"you get out of"
"computer science school and then"
"and then you did what and and now you're"
"doing what just give me a two-minute"
"version of that yeah i i i got also a"
"biology undergrad degree so i have bs"
"degrees in computer science and biology"
"after that"
"i went to grad school in biology"
"specifically in genetics i got a phd in"
"genetics and then after that i did a"
"post-doc in cell biology and then i"
"started my own lab and so since those"
"ever since then my group works at this"
"um kind of weird intersection of"
"developmental biology computer science"
"and cognitive science we're interested"
"in how uh"
"how various kinds of"
"living machines make decisions how they"
"have uh preferences beliefs um inner"
"experience all of that"
"very interesting interdisciplinary stuff"
"too so john"
um
"how did you"
"was it on purpose by accident how did"
"you stumble into this"
strange
"field very similar to to what mike said"
"but maybe just the compliment so i i was"
"in the psychology at ucla in"
"quantitative psychology program"
"and i was quite taken by a class on the"
"neuroscience of vision and i was stunned"
"at all these receptive fields and what"
"they were doing and"
"and i was also taking courses in"
"computer science i actually was working"
"at hughes aircraft company programming"
"military microprocessors as a way to pay"
"my way through ucla so i was part of the"
"cold war"
"and i was writing machine code"
"at the time so i was doing computer"
"programming all the time for my day job"
"and then"
"doing it at ucla for my classes writing"
"a compiler for pascal and so forth"
and
"then i discovered this guy named david"
marr
"at a class at ucla and his his writing"
"about vision really grabbed my attention"
"it was like"
"he had a phd in neurophysiology he'd"
"done something some work on the"
cerebellum
"some brilliant work but he had realized"
"sort of the complement of what mike just"
"said which was if he was going to really"
"understand the neuroscience he had to do"
"the the computation stuff well i guess"
"it's really what mike was saying but but"
"the the arrow came from the"
"neurophysiology into the computers"
"instead of the other way"
"and so david maher went to to mit and"
"was part of the ai lab there"
"as well as was now the brain and"
"cognitive science department so i said"
wow
"i want so i managed to get it"
"into grad school there so i went and"
"became david student uh with david marr"
"and whitman richards and was in the ai"
"lab and then the brain and cognitive"
"science department so i was very much"
"interested in how the two related and i"
"liked the"
"the computational point of view because"
"i was concerned that the neuroscience"
"wouldn't lead to"
"clean theories that would tell us how"
"the thing worked"
"and why i was doing what it did and so i"
"was very interested in in having"
"theories that you could build right if"
"you think this is how vision works build"
"one if you can build one that works it"
"doesn't mean you're right but at least"
"it means you have a theory that's worth"
"our time to to figure out why it's wrong"
"and and so uh so that's sort of how like"
"i got into this whole thing"
"well i think what we're all three"
"interested in is building stuff i'm an"
"engineer by education"
"and um"
"dick feynman long ago said something"
"like that which i cannot build i do not"
understand
"and i i like to say the gold standard in"
"science isn't peer review it's can you"
"build it and does it work and so you"
guys
"you guys are both interested in building"
"stuff and you're interested in building"
things
"that have consciousness or cognition or"
"use consciousness and cognition so"
"that's it's very interesting it's very"
"scary so"
"so don you have this very"
"i think it's a very understandable"
"uh fascinating metaphor"
"about computer desktops and icons that"
"you use to explain why"
"what we perceive"
"to be reality"
"is not necessarily what reality is and"
"in fact perceiving it in some perfectly"
"objective way might not even be helpful"
"could you"
"um explain that metaphor for the people"
"here that haven't heard that"
"right so i i decided"
"i don't know 15 years ago"
"to tackle a very specific technical"
question
"the question is this"
does
"evolution by natural selection"
shape
"sensory systems"
"to show"
organisms
"aspects of the structure of reality"
"right so in other words are we shaped to"
"see truth"
"what is the probability that evolution"
"shapes organisms to see the truth where"
"i use the word c in the generic sense"
"perceive the truth"
"and that's it"
"it turns out that evolution of natural"
"selection is a mathematically precise"
"theory now we have evolutionary game"
"theory evolutionary graph theory"
"all even genetic algorithms so so we"
"don't have to wave our hands we can"
"actually look at the theory and ask"
"answer this technical question and so i"
"first worked with justin mark and brian"
"marion some graduate students of mine"
"con stevens"
"and and our simulations seem to indicate"
"that uh you know"
"seeing the truth wasn't going to win"
"most of the time it was it was actually"
"going to make you extinct for"
"against creatures that just use"
"shortcuts rules of thumb and heuristics"
"even if the creatures were of equal"
complexity
"so then i went to uh"
"colleague chaitan prakash who's a"
mathematician
"and also manish singh and and some other"
"chris fields and we worked on on this"
"together and but but chaitan was the"
"mathematician who really brought it home"
"and it's basically a theorem that the"
"probability is zero"
"that any sensory system"
"for any organism"
"has ever been shaped to see any aspect"
"of objective reality with with one"
exception
"we can go into if you're interested it's"
"called sigma algebras and i can go into"
why
"sigma algebras are the one exception but"
"but other than that that there's there's"
"absolutely nothing in the theory"
"now again i'm not dr nair about this i'm"
"just saying"
"evolution of natural selection is the"
"single best theory we have right now for"
"understanding biology so as a scientist"
"it's my job to take that"
"theory very seriously and ask precise"
"questions of that theory and and so we"
"can ask a precise question and the"
"answer is surprising the the precise"
"answer is the probability of zero that"
"anything that we see so space and time"
"the shapes of objects the colors the"
"positions even the very existence of"
"these objects independent of our"
perceptions
"the probability is zero so you know"
"einstein's question is the moon there"
"when no one looks"
"evolution answers no"
"evolution answers that the moon is some"
"kind of data structure that your sensory"
"systems create"
"you're interacting with with some kind"
"of reality but that reality is not"
"spatial temporal it doesn't have"
"physical objects like moons and neurons"
"it's something utterly different"
"and the theory is good enough to tell us"
"that but it's not good enough to tell us"
"what's beyond space and time right our"
"theories can only tell us they're the"
"limits but they can't tell us"
"what's on the other side and i'll just"
add
"um we may want to talk about this as"
well
"quantum field theory it turns out says"
"the same thing space-time is not"
"fundamental particles are not"
"fundamental and it then is provable from"
"that theory so when we have the two big"
"pillars of modern science namely quantum"
"field theory with gravity"
"and evolution of natural selection both"
"saying um that space time is doomed"
"space time is not fundamental"
um
"that has all sorts of implications for"
"the study of life and neuroscience that"
"the neuro scientists aren't yet even"
"beginning to think about"
"well the first question a person should"
"ask when you talk about objective"
"reality is"
"what's objective reality right so"
so
"this is going to feed right into the"
"analogy that's in your book but"
"i'm i'm looking at a computer screen"
"it's got a little camera and a green"
"light and a keyboard and everything"
"but if you say what's a computer and"
"what's going on in the computer well"
"there's these pixels on my screen and"
"they're doing what we're all seeing"
right
"but that screen is just a representation"
"of a deeper reality of what's going on"
"in the circuit boards in the hard drive"
right
"and anybody that's done computer science"
"knows that there's i don't know 56 or 17"
"levels of"
"codes and systems and operating systems"
"and every so which one of those like"
"you could look at every single one of"
"those layers and it would tell you"
"something different"
"none of us have enough brain cells or or"
"eyes and ears to see all the stuff"
"that's going on so we have to pick"
something
so
"why don't you go into your computer icon"
"analogy to try to"
"i think you can say it better than i can"
"right so and"
"the the thing that you led off with too"
"is a very important point which is and"
"then i'll go into the analogy as you"
"pointed out how how in the world could i"
"use evolutionary theory"
"to tell us that we don't see the truth"
"if i don't know what the truth is"
"so if i don't know what objective"
"reality is then how in the"
"what kind of guy is this that claims"
"that we don't see the truth how does he"
"know what the truth is how so it seems"
"like i've i've proposed something that's"
"just a fool's errand right"
"you have to know the truth so that you"
"don't know the truth well that's the"
"power of scientific theories evolution"
"by natural selection gives us the tools"
"to answer the question answer the"
question
"for any possible structure that reality"
"might have"
"we don't know what structure actually"
"has or what structures it has but in"
"each case you can say if it had a total"
"order if it had a metric if it had this"
topology
"what is the probability that that"
"structure would be preserved in"
"in by our sensory systems and you can"
"show in each case the probability is is"
"precisely zero as you let the number of"
"states of the world get arbitrarily"
"large on the number of payoff values you"
"get so so you don't have to know what"
"the truth is to to know"
"according to evolutionary theory that uh"
"whatever the truth is you don't see it"
"except for sigma additive classes and"
signals
"but but so then"
"the the next question that you raised"
"here was is basically"
"the natural one that comes next which is"
"okay well if"
"our senses haven't been shaped by"
"natural selection to show us the truth"
"then what good are they and what are"
"they doing for us i mean you know it"
"seems like"
"you've destroyed the one thing that you"
"would expect of your sensory system of"
"course they're going to show you the"
"truth that's how you stay fit you see"
"the truth that's how you you don't see"
"all of the truth but you see the parts"
"of the truth that you need to stay fit"
"clearly that's how it works and that's"
"what most of my colleagues have assumed"
"and that's what i assumed until i did"
"the work"
"i'm still alive i didn't get hit by the"
"bus yesterday my eyes were telling"
right
"exactly right yeah and someone could say"
"well look if you think that bus isn't"
"real step in front of us and after"
"you're dead we'll know that it was real"
"well and so that's where this computer"
"interface analogy comes in right so so"
what
"and i'm i'm just saying this is analogy"
"this is you know this is to help people"
"get get intuitions"
"as you said if you if you have a desktop"
"interface and you're writing a book say"
"and the icon for the book is blue and"
"rectangular in the middle of your screen"
"does that mean that the book itself is"
"blue and rectangular and in the middle"
"of your computer right anybody who"
"thought that just misunderstands the"
"point of the the interface it's not"
"there to show you the truth in fact we"
"pay good money"
"for an interface"
"to hide the truth we don't want to have"
"to toggle voltages and magnetic fields"
"in a computer to write a book if you had"
"to do that"
"there would be very little book"
"publishing and very little emails being"
"sent and so forth so that's what"
"evolution did it actually gave us a user"
"interface that effectively completely"
"hides the nature of objective reality"
"hides all those gory details and gives"
"us just the eye candy the simple icons"
"that we need to"
"control those aspects of reality that we"
"need to control to stay alive long"
"enough to reproduce"
"full stop so we have an interface that"
"guides adaptive behavior and that's all"
"evolution does it gives you senses that"
"guide adaptive behavior and seeing the"
"truth is not a part of it it's not"
"needed and so is not done"
"so don would it be accurate to say that"
perception
"is representations and even"
"representations of representations"
and
"because they have to be useful"
"our senses are do very much what we do"
"when we build a computer which is"
"um you know it was a great blessing to"
"the world when instead of having to"
"toggle machine code and do all this"
"really weird stuff"
"like you would like whatever um a"
"sinclair 1000 computer like which hardly"
"anybody can figure out how to use versus"
"steve jobs gave us a okay drag the thing"
"to the trash and"
"he made a a useful representation"
"rather than an absolute truth"
"and everybody's like okay i can deal"
"with that"
"abs absolutely so that's that's what"
"evolution did and and you're right my"
"first programming was on a military"
"microprocessor called the anyak30 and i"
"literally was toggling ones and zeros i"
"knew the machine code"
"and we did an entire flight simulator in"
64k
"you could do any mission it's 64k but"
"that's because we programmed every"
"single bit you can imagine my relief"
"when i didn't have to do the bits and"
"when i started being able to use you"
"know higher level programming languages"
"and but but of course the evolution has"
"given us something even more advanced"
"than like you know fortran or lisp or"
"pascal or something like that or c plus"
"plus it's given us a full-on graphical"
"user interface which allows us to"
"control the bits at a very very high"
"level but that's what we're doing we're"
"toggling bits"
"effectively and so we have our data"
structures
"and so so as i look up at the sky and i"
"see the moon"
"i'm creating on the fly"
"a data structure"
"and as soon as i look away i garbage"
"we're using computer science terminology"
"now i garbage collect that data"
"structure it no longer exists"
"so this makes a clean prediction"
"in physics"
"clean prediction no physical object"
"has definite values of its physical"
"properties like position momentum and"
"spin when it's not observed"
"so that's the the claim is technically"
"something called local realism"
"and non-contextual realism are have to"
"be false according to evolution by"
"natural selection"
"and and it turns out when the physicists"
"do the experiments local realism and"
"non-contextual realism are false"
"in fact space time itself is doomed so"
"it's not just the objects the space time"
"that's not there"
so
"isn't this an a way of pointing out that"
"even though especially us technical"
"people we tend to think we like to think"
"of science"
"as this objective"
thing
"but the reality is every measurement"
"that we didn't do we are trusting"
"somebody else"
"that their senses"
"and their measurement and their meter or"
"their temperature gauge"
"was what they said it was and then guess"
"what if i do the experiment myself i'm"
"still doing the experiment through my"
senses
"and through my perceptions"
"that that's right but the way scientists"
"have thought about this is that we can"
"always take a reductionist view of those"
"senses so"
"even though we have the neurobiology of"
"vision and haptics and you know"
"acoustics and so forth"
"um the"
"i would say 99 of my colleagues in"
"cognitive neuroscience for example are"
full-blown
"reductionists right so they they assume"
"that um as you"
"reductionism is the claim"
"as you go to smaller and smaller scales"
"in space"
"or space time"
"you get to deeper and deeper more"
"fundamental laws of nature"
well
"it turns out that space time itself"
"is doomed you if you want a physicist to"
"tell you this nema arkhani hamed nimar"
"kane hamed at the institute for advanced"
"study she just googled his name and"
"space time is doomed you can hear it"
"from the man himself like there's a"
"semester-long course at harvard in 2019"
"you can take his course online is free"
"and you can find out in as much detail"
"as you want why it's over space time has"
"had a good ride and as he puts it"
"with it reductionism is dead"
"in in fact space-time only"
"goes to 10 to the minus 33 centimeters"
"it's not that deep it was 10 to the"
"minus 33 trillion centimeters i'd be"
"impressed but it's only 10 to the minus"
"33. so the very notion of of space"
"spatial features below that scale have"
"no operational definition the same thing"
"for time less than 10 to the minus 43"
"there's no operational meaning to these"
"things so space-time is not fundamental"
"it cannot be fundamental and what's"
"what's stunning is"
"they've found structures"
"beyond space-time"
"some these are"
"believe it or not their geometry is"
"called polytopes"
"so amplitude"
"cosmological polytope a sociohedron"
"these are structures beyond space time"
"so there's no space there's no time"
"but you can show how quantum theory"
and
"einstein's theory of space-time"
"both arise together joined at the hip"
"from a deeper theory that has no space"
"time and no quantum theory no hilbert"
"spaces so there's so the physicists"
"now for the last 15 years"
"have really been pursuing this um this"
"is fairly new"
"the first hint came in 1986 i think with"
"some physicist named park and taylor who"
"discovered a formula for scattering of"
"gluon processes that they needed to do"
"for collision analysis scattering"
"analysis and they discovered that if you"
"do it in space time well feynman had"
"taught us how to do it in space time it"
"was just like"
"on hundreds of pages of algebra for like"
"two gluons in four gluons out you"
"couldn't if you're doing millions of"
"these per second you you couldn't do the"
"computations on a computer so park and"
"taylor discovered"
"a single formula"
"that you could write down on the sheet"
"of paper by hand that collapsed hundreds"
"of pages of algebra to just a couple"
"terms and then the amplitude with uh"
"nema or kanye hemet and"
"yourself trinket discovered and then"
"further work on that has found many many"
"more of these scattering amplitudes that"
"can be when you do them in space and"
"time if you force yourself to do the"
"computation in space and time it's ugly"
"and you don't see symmetries something"
"called the dual conformal symmetry which"
"is true the scattering data you don't"
"see it so the math is ugly the"
"symmetries are hidden"
"and but when you let go of space-time"
"all of a sudden these jewels appear"
these
"geometric jewels the volumes of"
"different parts of the jewels completely"
encode
"the scattering probabilities of"
"scattering amplitudes and sort of the"
"face structure gives you unitarily and"
"locality all so all the stuff that we"
"like in space and time is coded"
"implicitly in these things and you see"
"new symmetries that are true of the data"
"that can't be seen in the space time so"
"it's really over for space time and and"
"therefore it's over for reductionism so"
"the reductionist framework"
"which has been so powerful for for the"
"last couple of centuries is is now it's"
"it's it's over and"
"neuroscience is going to take a while to"
"catch up this is only the last 15 years"
"in physics so that's and i'm not"
"surprised that neuroscience hasn't"
"caught up but but frankly"
"we shouldn't be wasting our time with"
reductionism
"you know we now know it's like newton"
"right once you know about the the"
"ultraviolet catastrophe with black body"
"radiation you you know that newton's not"
"the final word on reality it's you know"
"the the smart money is going to be"
"looking at something like einstein"
"for the new"
"new insight and so right now i i would"
"say the smart money is not on"
"reductionist neurobiological"
"neurobiological reductionist theories of"
consciousness
"we need to go deeper because our best"
"science is telling us that reductionism"
"is dead that's both"
"evolution of natural selection and"
"physicists both"
"so this is a perfect time to jump over"
"to mike so mike"
um
"we were talking about toggling bits and"
"versus moving icons around and you've"
"got your own version of this because the"
"bit togglers in biology are molecular"
biologists
"and geneticists and you know they're"
"dealing at a very"
"granular level"
and
"you've been saying and showing for quite"
"a while that they're completely other"
"higher level systems of biology"
that
"you can reprogram in"
"things and get results without even"
"knowing what's going on at those bottom"
levels
"could you talk about"
well
"go anywhere you want with that you"
"you've got about a hundred examples of"
"it what's one or two of your favorites"
"yeah um i i wanna i wanna take a quick"
"step back and uh uh kind of draw a"
"little a little picture that that merges"
"i think very nicely with what dawn has"
"been saying"
"because uh the way i got to a a similar"
"conclusion i i i mean not the physics i"
"can't follow any of the physics but i"
"agree with the with the basics of what"
"don is saying for the following reason"
um
"and i'll give you some examples um i"
"think that that evolution"
"isn't it isn't it here's a here's a"
"slightly different take on what"
"evolution is actually doing which i"
"think doesn't make sense here i don't"
"think evolution is"
"solving a specific problem in the sense"
"of here's an environment and we're going"
"and evolution is going to design a"
"creature that's fit for that environment"
"right because that's the sort of view"
"that might expect you to have a creature"
"that accurately sees its world i don't"
"actually think that's what evolution is"
"doing i think what evolution is doing is"
"producing machines"
"that are very good at solving novel"
"problems so so evolution isn't producing"
"solutions to problems it produces"
"machines that solves problems"
"on the fly right uh the the the"
"neuroscience version of that view is uh"
"there's a there's a book for example by"
"by nick chader called the mind is flat"
"and it's this idea that a lot of these"
"things are kind of generated on the fly"
"and and i have a similar thing that that"
"i'm working on writing that could be"
"summarizes development is flat but"
"basically the idea is that"
"because you're dealing with let's start"
"all the way in the beginning uh of"
"evolution let's say of multicellular"
forms
"is not working with passive materials"
"that it has to arrange in specific um"
"organizations and make sure that"
"everything works and so on evolution is"
"dealing with an agential material it's"
"dealing with cells that are themselves"
"former organ in fact still organisms"
"they have their own agendas they already"
"do things and so what you what evolution"
"has to has to work with is the space of"
different
"signals inducements rewards and"
"punishments and the ways to get those"
"cells to do whatever"
"whatever is appropriate for them to do"
"and those cells if you look at things"
"from their perspective"
"they don't know"
"what space they should be solving"
"problems in it might be metabolic it"
"might be transcriptional it might be"
"morphogenetic space it might be"
three-dimensional
"spaces we're used to you know animals"
"big animals like us running around and"
"modern robotics and so on doing things"
"in 3d space there are many different"
"problem spaces and cells don't know"
"where the organism begins and ends"
"because every every internal cell is"
"some other cell's external environment"
"right uh"
"right and so and so because these these"
"creatures as they're being put together"
"from literally from molecules have to"
"solve all these problems on the fly they"
"have to do active inference they have to"
"make predictions about their environment"
"they have to build stories about"
"themselves meaning self models of what"
"their causal power is they have to"
"understand what you know they're limited"
"in terms of their metabolic so they"
"can't just be giving out every single"
"signal they want"
"and they have to be able to tell in"
"their environment what are the signals"
"that actually make things happen right"
"what are the what are the most causally"
"potent knobs that they can twist in this"
"in this world that they're in and then"
"they can they sort of turn that on"
"themselves and they and they and they"
"have to construct models of themselves"
"as causal integrated agents as selves"
"um and all of this stuff figuring out"
"what problems you're solving where you"
"begin and end who your neighbors are uh"
"what you are how much causal capacity"
"you have all of these things get get"
"solved on the fly and and i'll you know"
"i can give you some examples of that uh"
"no no wonder uh evolution is not uh"
"you know sort of"
"trying to trying to drive you to an"
"accurate picture of your reality because"
"there's no saying what that reality is"
"going to be all of the prior experience"
"that you've had is not necessarily a"
great
"um guide to what you're going to"
"encounter in the future and what biology"
"is really good at and one of the one of"
"the amazing you know kind of super"
"interesting areas is why it is that that"
"evolution actually does this biology is"
"really good at learning to get along"
"with whatever it is that you've got"
"right and and and if you're building all"
"that stuff from scratch and you're"
"trying to make sense of your world from"
"scratch all the time and you know maybe"
"you think you can rely on certain things"
"and maybe you can't uh then then of"
"course what you're going to try to do is"
"tell the best story to yourself that you"
"can about where you are and what you're"
"doing and nev and you can forget about"
"uh this is some idea that there's some"
"objective i mean everything is observer"
"dependent in this in this view um"
"it's it's all from the perspective of"
"either the system itself or some sort of"
"parasite that's trying to hack it or a"
"con specific that wants to mate with it"
"or yeah all of this is observer"
"dependent by the way the observers come"
"in different scales so the cells are"
"watching each other the tissues are all"
"watching each other the swarm i mean"
every
"no no wonder there's not a single"
"objective reality that any of this can"
"dependably uh sort of sort of hone in on"
"right and and the kinds of examples uh"
"there's a couple examples of that that i"
"can give there's a there's a here's"
"here's a very old example"
"which is that's where it comes from the"
"40s where uh normally normal development"
"which by the way"
"the the thing about all of this is that"
"normal development is so reliable that"
"it really obscures the intelligence of"
"all of these parts it seems kind of well"
"what else is then of course that's"
"what's going to happen well that's only"
"because you've seen it happen reliably"
"so many times once you start messing"
"with it you really see the intelligence"
"of these things uh so so here you are"
"you have a you have a you have a nude"
"and um the newt is starts with with a"
"you know with a single fertilized egg"
"and then it develops into a nude"
"and and the cells are a certain size and"
"they work together to make tubules"
"kidney tubules these little tubes that"
"go to the kidneys if you take a"
"cross-section through one of those"
"tubules you'll see that there's maybe"
"eight to ten cells and they sort of work"
"together in a kind of a circle and they"
"leave a lumen in the middle and that's"
"your that's your kidney tubule so one"
"thing you can do is uh you can you can"
"you can throw a trick that we don't need"
"to get into you can force the early"
"cells to have more than normal the"
"number of chromosomes so right so you"
"can double triple whatever the number of"
"chromosomes well the first thing for the"
"first amazing thing is that you still"
"get a nude out after you've doubled in"
"the instructions supposedly the"
"instructions and all of that you still"
"get a normal nude so that's already kind"
"of weird but let's let's get past that"
"one of the things that happens is the"
"cells get much bigger so the more"
"genetic material the bigger the"
"physically bigger the cells get"
"when the cells get bigger how do you"
"make a kidney tubule with bigger cells"
"why you use fewer cells to make the"
"exact same size tubule so that's already"
"interesting because it turns out that"
"this thing is is really smart and it"
"doesn't just all scale up and make this"
"giant tubule because the legos are"
"bigger no actually as the legos get"
"bigger there's fewer of them that work"
"together to make the exact same tubule"
"so that's that's that's the interesting"
"thing part two that's all also amazing"
"it gets even better than that the best"
"part is when you make those cells so big"
"that you can't even fit two of them"
"around the circumference of the tubule"
"what do they do a single cell will bend"
"around itself"
"leaving a spot in the middle and making"
"a tubule all by itself what's amazing"
"about that is that it uses a completely"
"different molecular mechanism where"
"normally you would have cell to cell"
"communication and so on in this case no"
"you have cytoskeletal bending so what"
"you have i mean talk about talk about"
"reductionism what you have here is this"
"amazing example of top-down causation"
"where in the service of a large-scale"
"macrostate having a proper anatomical"
"tubule diverse molecular states get"
"activated why did cytoskeleton bending i"
"get activated instead of cell to cell"
"communication because you need it to"
"have a tubule of the correct size okay"
"now obviously this way of looking at it"
"is not mainstream right it's this you"
"know this we can talk about this whole"
"you know kind of teleonomic approach"
"that i use and so on but but that is an"
"example of many things it's an example"
"of of intelligence in anatomical"
"morphospace meaning solving problems"
"solving new problems that you haven't"
"seen before"
"it's an example of"
"the incredible plasticity of life so"
"here is all the developmental mechanisms"
"i've been using exactly these size cells"
"for how many millions of years all of a"
"sudden you change the parts no problem"
"everything gets fixed this goes beyond"
"plasticity to things like injury i mean"
"it's it's amazing enough that the same"
"salamander you cut its arm off it'll"
"grow a new arm but injuries happen all"
"the time that's you know that that's you"
"can sort of see how that capacity is"
"there you not only in changes of the"
"environment but changes of your own"
"parts right that's why all of this works"
"is because all of this every example of"
"development is is doing this it's"
"figuring out how to do this with the"
"parts i have all the time and you only"
"see the these amazing kind of um"
"uh examples of novelty when you start"
"really perturbing things and we don't"
"have any technology where you can say uh"
"you know what i'm gonna i'm gonna"
"quadruple the size of all my parts i"
"still want the exact same size car"
"though like we don't we don't have any"
"technology that that don't work that"
"works that way so so so you see that"
"kind of intelligence you see you see the"
"ability to navigate more for space using"
"different parts starting off from"
"different uh configurations right um"
"the example of the frog face that i"
"often give the fact that if you start"
"off with a uh with a with a tadpole with"
"all the organs scrambled in the wrong"
"location you still largely get a normal"
"frog because all of because because it"
"what what what the biology gave us"
"is is not a system that moves in a very"
"predetermined way to make a frog out of"
"a tadpole it actually gave us a machine"
"that can do error minimization that"
"basically you're starting off in the"
"wrong position no problem wander around"
"until the error is is small enough"
"traverse that morph of space in a with"
"with some degree of competency get to be"
"a frog error is low then everything"
"stops so that's one that those are a"
"couple of examples the other you know"
"one of my favorite examples are these"
"are the others of the zenobots so the"
"thing with the xenobots is these are"
"for anybody doesn't know these are um so"
"so what you do is uh you take a you take"
"an early frog embryo and by the way this"
"has nothing to do with being an embryo"
"or being a frog this is a much more"
"general phenomenon you take uh you take"
"the skins you take the the embryo you"
"take some skin cells off of it and you"
"let those skin cells have a new life you"
"you basically let them reimagine they're"
"multicellular you don't add anything no"
"new genes no nano materials nothing but"
"but you take something away it's"
"engineering by subtracting constraints"
"what you do is you take away the other"
"cells that are normally bullying these"
"skin cells into being a boring"
"two-dimensional layer on the outer"
"surface if you if if you look at a"
"normal embryo and you ask what do skin"
"cells want to do well you would say well"
"of course they want to be the outer you"
"know flat layer you know around the the"
"the embryo that's not what the cells"
"want to do how do you know because if"
"you take away the other cells that are"
"normally forcing them to do that you get"
"to see what they do on their own what do"
"they do on their own they well there's"
"many things they could do they could do"
"nothing they could die they could run"
"off and separate from each other they"
"could make a nice flat monolayer the way"
"cell culture does they don't do any of"
"those things what they do is"
"over over a couple of a couple of nights"
"they uh merge together into this little"
"ball they repurpose their little hairs"
"the little cilia that are normally used"
"to redistribute mucus over the surface"
"of the frog they use those to row"
"against the water so the ones on the"
"left row this way the ones on the right"
"row this way and the whole thing swims"
"and then they do cool things like they"
"run mazes they cooperate with each other"
"to build copies of themselves out of"
"loose cells so von neumann's dream right"
"of of a machine that runs around and"
"collects parts and they do that they do"
"kinematic self-replication if you just"
"sprinkle a bunch of loose cells they"
"will run around corral them together"
"corral them into little little piles the"
"little piles become xenobots and guess"
"what they do they run around do the same"
"things you have multiple generations of"
"bots doing this now here's the here's"
"the kicker this is why i'm bringing all"
"this stuff up"
"first of all uh any any creature on"
"earth a standard creature that you pick"
"up and you ask why does it look the way"
"it looks why is it this color why does"
"it have this behavior the answer is"
"always the same why selection of course"
"because for millions of years it's been"
"shaped to to everybody else died off and"
"and this is the thing that fits the nice"
"you know froggy environment right okay"
"there's never been there's never been"
"any zenobots there's never been"
"selection to be a good xenobot yeah ever"
"this this whole thing was was was"
"figured out by these cells on the fly"
"within 48 hours in a completely novel"
"configuration right uh there's no"
"there's no creature that reproduces by"
"kinematic cell for a replication that we"
"know of what we've done is we've made it"
"impossible for these cells to reproduce"
"in the normal frog like fashion they"
"figure out another way of doing it so"
"that that that"
"that ability of these cells to find"
"themselves in a novel configuration that"
"never had specific i mean of course the"
"cells were the product of selection in"
"the context of skin so they do all kinds"
"of cool skin things right which get"
"repurposed they they regenerate so for"
"example skin repairs itself so they"
"regenerate so xenobots can regenerate"
"but but all of this gets repurposed into"
"a new coherent proto-organism it's never"
"existed before where where along you"
"know eons of selection are not at all"
"the explanation for how they got here um"
"right and so and so the interesting and"
"so and so that level of you know of"
"course they're going to build a"
"different model of reality than than"
"than tadpoles and embryos build"
"and uh"
"you know the the the other thing the"
"other cool kind of cool thing about it"
is
"when we as engineers build these"
zenobots
"we do very little the bots the cells do"
"most of the heavy lifting right they"
"they know how to do this stuff and and"
"we're working with this agential"
"material we're basically just giving"
"them input stimuli this is exactly what"
"you and don were talking about where"
"we're not rewiring the genome we're not"
"you know micromanaging any of this stuff"
"we're giving them a new environment to"
"sort of push them into this it's guided"
"self-assembly it isn't it isn't"
micromanagement
"that's exactly how xenobots make the"
"next generation of xenobots they run"
"around and they and they make these"
"little piles"
"that the whole multi-generational trick"
"only works because the piles themselves"
"are going to turn into the next"
"generation of bots"
"the whole process takes advantage of the"
"competency of these cells so we as"
"engineers took advantage of the"
"competency the bots themselves took"
"advantage of that competency in making"
"the next generation and guess who else"
"takes advantage of that evolution itself"
"because what that means is when you're"
"doing evolution you don't have to search"
"this horrible"
"mult you know astronomically large space"
"of all possible micro configurations no"
"you search a nice smooth space of of"
"different signals that you could send to"
"cells to modify them to do this or that"
"so so right so so yeah so so that's it i"
"think i think i think it's extremely"
"compatible with with don's view because"
"all of this stuff has to be constructed"
"on the fly and so that's what evolution"
"is giving us is machines that are good"
"at doing that not being attached to some"
"one model of reality that's been there"
"for you know eons with this you know in"
"this particular lineage it has to work"
"it has to work immediately with whatever"
"comes your way mutations you know play"
"the hand you're dealt right whatever"
"whatever mutate whatever your genome"
"looks like whatever your um you know we"
"could talk about uh the distinction"
"between you know what what's between the"
"genome and the anatomy actually but"
"whatever whatever the environment is"
"whatever you happen to be at any given"
"moment you can't count on what you"
"thought you were going to be"
"you you have to you have to play the"
"hand you're dealt"
"so i hoped"
"that you would tell i was going to ask"
"you to tell the tubule story"
because
"well both that story and the zenobot"
story
"in my mind when you learn certain things"
"they obliterate"
"a previous way of looking at things"
"um if if you always thought that"
"squirrels and salamanders and babies and"
"and crickets"
"are all generated by this"
"algorithm-like robotic program that's"
"kind of like you know stamping out"
"fenders in a car factory if you thought"
"that was how biology worked you find out"
"well we quadrupled the cells"
"of this newt was it"
"and um and a tube that's got to go from"
"a kidney to somewhere else goes from"
"formed by a ring of cells to a cell"
"becoming a c and closing itself"
um
"with a"
"using uh a cytoskeleton instead right"
so
"wait a minute so what does this tell us"
"it tells us"
that
"the organism is a"
"it's not a recipe it's a set of"
relations
"that the parts of the organism are"
"trying to get to like a tadpole face am"
"am i"
"describing this right mike"
"yeah it's it's it's a very interesting"
"thing i mean prior to"
"genetics and"
"and being able to read genomes"
"some people had this idea that well"
"there's a plan in the genome for the"
"organism um it was always implausible"
"for many reasons but but but now it's"
"completely dead because we can read"
"genomes now and we know that there's"
"nothing directly in the genome that"
"speaks to any of these things what's in"
"there is a description of the micro"
"level hardware right the protein level"
"hardware that every cell gets to have"
"that's exactly what's in the genome now"
"it turns out and this is the part that"
"needs lots more work it turns out that"
"for some interesting reason which is you"
"know people often think of evolution as"
"re as as blind and dumb and and always"
"picking like immediate like like local"
"benefits all you know always taking the"
"short term benefits"
"give if if that's your view why it is"
"that we make these really why it makes"
"these really um"
"uh uh competent problem-solving machines"
"it kind of needs a lot of explanation so"
"so we you know that's all other thing"
"but uh"
"what the hardware that emerges out of"
"this evolutionary process is uh"
"has has it has competencies in lots of"
"different capacities and it has one of"
"the competencies it has is to put is to"
"uh by default pick up certain set points"
"for homeostatic processes anatomical"
"homeostasis and we call that the"
"standard target morphology of the"
"species so you know why do why do um"
"frog eggs make frogs and acorns make oak"
"trees because for the same reason that"
"your calculator when you put it together"
"you turn it on it always starts with"
"zero why does it have zero because"
"because you've got a piece of hardware"
"that by default right the laws of"
"physics are such that that by default it"
"lands in a particular configuration fine"
"reliably so that's great"
"but what it also does is give you"
"hardware that has all kinds of other"
"competencies which is it's"
"reprogrammable and it solves problems"
"and it can minimize certain things and"
"optimize for other things uh you know"
"kind of agendas and intelligence all all"
"the way through and um"
"that's uh and and that's because i mean"
"i think i i really think that that"
"evolution would not would not work fast"
"enough without the stuff if you really"
"had to search the space of"
"i mean look at look at look at it this"
"way uh"
"when you when you uh when you take when"
"you make a tadpole with the eye in the"
"wrong position it will eventually get to"
"where it's going if we put an eye on the"
"tail of a tadpole those animals can see"
"out of those eyes perfectly well we've"
"shown that"
"this means that in evolution"
"if you have a mutation that i mean one"
"thing i'll back up for a second one"
"thing as engineers and programmers i"
"don't know about you but when when when"
"i first started thinking about what the"
"real theory of evolution was supposed to"
"be having written code first"
"it seems utterly ridiculous because"
"because we know what happens when you"
"make random changes to these complex"
"systems i mean are you kidding me that"
"and and it's not that it doesn't work of"
"course we have genetic algorithms and we"
"can see that it works but the rate at"
"which you might expect interesting"
"things to happen is is is um"
"very much up for debate and so"
"what's what's interesting is if if every"
"mutation that moved the eye so it was"
"let's say by but you know mutations have"
"usually multiple um side effects right"
"they do many things every mutation does"
"multiple things so let's say let's say"
"there's a mutation and it moves the eye"
"and it also does something else that's"
"good somewhere you know pro pro"
"you know pro adaptive somewhere else in"
"the embryo if that animal now can't see"
"or the mouth is off or something you"
"will never be able to explore the"
"benefit of that mutation it's it because"
"your fitness is low you're now dead and"
"that means that every time you want to"
"do something"
"if every time you want to find a good"
"solution to something uh you have to"
"discover all the mutations that that do"
"that without screwing up everything else"
"that will take you know i'm"
"that that'll take too long i think what"
"makes evolution actually go is the fact"
"that the parts are competent so if your"
"eye is slightly off but something else"
"is happening great you'll get a chance"
"to explore that and see if that's good"
"for fitness because guess what your eye"
"will find its way unless i mean of"
"course of course there are birth defects"
"that and and you know that that totally"
"screwed things up but the the constant"
"competency of these parts in"
"physiological space right the"
"homeostasis the ability to solve novel"
"novel problems in in in transcriptional"
"space and so on means that you can"
"explore it's a much smoother space it"
hides
"all of these um"
"things that otherwise would just wreck"
"the system because your parts are"
"competent because you're not building"
"with with dumb passive materials and so"
"that's so that's one implication of all"
"this the other implication i think"
"that's pretty cool is that it makes an"
"intelligence ratchet and the way that i"
"think the ratchet works is is as follows"
"imagine that um"
"because because your parts are competent"
uh
"defects in or or sub-optimal genetics"
"often gives rise to pretty good bodies"
"because the cells make up for it they'll"
"get to where they're going they can make"
"do with with weird metabolism and so on"
"they'll make do what that means is that"
"when when selection takes a look at two"
"organisms which look pretty good"
phenotypically
"it can't tell whether they look good"
"because the genetics are awesome or"
because
"the genetics were so so but the cells"
"actually made up for a lot of it"
"once once you can't really tell"
"then your power to weed out the good the"
"good genetics from the bad genetics is"
"greatly diminished so what what"
"competency developmental competency that"
"layer between uh between genetics and"
"and fin and outcomes and phenotype the"
"competency at that letter at that level"
"masks a lot of information from"
"selection which means that if you want"
"to make progress you can't make progress"
"by optimizing the hardware anymore the"
"genome but you can make progress by"
"cranking up the intelligence of the"
"cells the competency of the cells and i"
"just want to give two quick examples of"
"that um the technological example of"
"this and this was pointed out to me by"
"steve frank a few months ago is that"
"you know raid arrays right these arrays"
"of disks that are designed to make them"
"very you know make the whole system not"
"lose not lose information"
"ever since raid arrays got going the"
"quality of the hard drive media has"
"dropped and it keeps going down because"
"you don't need to have good media"
"anymore because the raider a takes care"
"of everything the pressure to have"
"awesome disc media is off because the"
"raid will will let you right so you get"
"the idea this is this and but but what's"
"cool about it it's a ratchet you can't"
"go backwards right once you have that"
"now you take off the raid ah the media's"
"the media is stinks so you can't do it"
anymore
"so i think we have the same kind of"
"ratchet in evolution where once the"
"parts are competent and they're"
"competent from day one because they're"
"cells they already know how to do things"
"you have this immediate ratchet that"
"you're better off optimizing the iq of"
"the cells and their various capabilities"
"rather than trying to get the hardware"
"right from from day one and the best"
"example of this and i don't know why all"
"the other animals aren't such good"
"examples of this so that's kind of a gap"
"that needs to be you know filled in with"
"details but but but here's an amazing"
"example that is basically the right"
"array in biology"
"planaria right these flatworms the two"
"two key things about planaria one is"
that
"uh when you when you cut them into"
"pieces every piece regenerates exactly"
"what's missing so you get tiny perfect"
"tiny little worms"
"the old material actually shrinks down"
"so that when the new stuff shows up"
"they're properly scaled right so it's"
incredible
"uh 100 of the time it's reliable they're"
"incredibly robust in fact they're"
"immortal there's no such thing as an old"
"planarian they're so good at this that"
"they're just you know so so champions of"
"regeneration immortality they you know"
"they can they can normalize cancer i"
"mean just amazing"
"but one fun thing about them is that"
"some species reproduce by tearing"
"themselves in half and regenerating they"
"don't do the sperm and egg thing most of"
"the time"
"that means that unlike us when we have a"
"mutation in our body we don't pass it on"
"to our offspring right our germline"
"stays pretty clean most of the time not"
"so with planaria they accumulate every"
"mutation that doesn't kill the cell"
"because every mutation that doesn't kill"
"the stem cell gets propagated into the"
"next generation as it rebuilds the body"
"right their bodies show evidence of this"
"for 400 million years they've been"
"keeping every every mutation that"
"doesn't doesn't kill the cell they are"
"mix applied right every cell has a"
"different number of chromosomes they're"
"all their genetics are all over the"
"place they look like a tumor they're"
"just an incredible mess and yet"
100
"anatomic fidelity every single time"
"right what does that what does that say"
"about how little we understand the"
"relationship between the genome and the"
"anatomy there are there is no model that"
"would predict this"
"that would say that oh yeah don't worry"
"you know your genetics can be all over"
"the place but the anatomy will be great"
"we have no models that predict that"
"except for"
"what i just said to you about this"
"intelligence ratchet because i think"
"what's happened there"
"more so than than most other animals is"
"evolutions put all of the all of the"
"hard work went into the algorithm it"
"went into i don't care what your"
"genetics are to a wide range of defects"
"we can get this done"
"despite the fact that the cells are"
"somewhat different than this and that"
"it's it's uh all the all the hard effort"
"went into polishing the algorithm so i"
"think right the competency of these"
"cells which is incredible and then and"
"then of course the the pressure to keep"
"the genetics pure is is low because the"
"algorithm takes care of it so right so"
"so that's you know that those are some"
"things that that we need to think about"
"mike you made a uh put out a paper"
"with your"
"theory of"
"mind everywhere"
"a technology approach to mind everywhere"
"and and you talked about you you made"
"mention of"
"when students have not been"
"pre-programmed with the idea that this"
"or that is impossible they"
"like they they just naturally"
"pick up that um and i i'm not going to"
"try to find the quote"
"and so"
"what i want to"
"ask both of you is"
"let's say you could push a big reset"
button
"and instead of scientific revolution"
"taking 50 years"
"we're get we're going to start a new"
"university in a brand new country on an"
"island somewhere"
and
"we can"
"instead of"
"clinging to reductionism we can embrace"
"an agent-based or a consciousness-based"
"view of science"
"and we're unfettered to pursue that to"
"the nth degree"
"how does that science look different"
"5 10 15 years from now as it develops"
"and what kinds of things is it doing"
"that are just not possible"
"in the reductionist view i'd like to"
"start with dawn"
and
"then michael"
"right so"
"letting go of reductionism is a big move"
"we've all been raised in it so this is a"
"new trick for for most of us and hard to"
"think out of the box but"
"the the direction that i'm myself"
"pursuing and i would want to pursue is"
"the physicists have already found"
"structures beyond time"
"they're already there they're finding"
"these polytopes"
"they don't know what the polytopes are"
"about all they know is that when you"
"compute the volumes of these polytopes"
"you get the right answer and you see"
"symmetries in the data and you can see"
how
"space time gets its features of"
"unitarity and locality"
"from these structures that don't really"
"care about unitarian locality they're"
"beyond space time"
so
"the question then is"
"i think this is at the forefront of the"
"current science what in the world are"
"these polytopes about"
"right they're the next step they're"
"clearly the next step beyond space time"
"what are they about"
"and if we have a model of in which we're"
"talking about consciousness"
"right we have to completely reboot how"
"we think about it right now 99 of my"
"colleagues are in the reductionist mode"
"how do"
"microtubule quantum state reductions"
"that are orchestrated in the right way"
"cause specific conscious experiences how"
"do integrated information structures in"
"physical systems create consciousness"
"how does a global workspace with the"
"right broadcasting"
"um capabilities working memory how does"
"that create conscious experiences so"
"it's all in a reductionist framework if"
"we start with small physical systems"
"and then neurobiological systems how can"
"we boot up consciousness from that well"
"space time is doomed those those"
"entities don't even exist when they're"
"not perceived"
"so to be very very clear i have no"
"neurons right now if you looked you"
"would see neurons because that's a data"
"structure you create in your interface"
"when you need it and as soon as you"
"don't need it you garbage collected so"
"neurons exist when you perceive them"
"and otherwise they don't exist so the"
"the whole neurobiological reductionist"
"approach and the physical reductionist"
approach
really
"that's the big step first we have to let"
"go of that"
"and then whatever we propose is going to"
"have to show where these polytopes come"
"from so"
"what i'm working on are is a dynamics of"
"consciousness so it's not in space and"
"time it's a dynamics in an abstract"
"consciousness space"
"and it it looks like the asymptotic"
behavior
"so the"
"so the long-term behavior of this can be"
"described by"
"things called burkhoff polytopes"
"and the brick off polytubes turn out to"
be
"cells in the gr the positive grasmanian"
"that gives rise to the amplitude"
"so so the direction i'm i'm looking at"
"right now and this is you know a moon"
"shot but you got to you got to you got"
"to do it"
"you start with a theory in which"
"consciousness is fundamental it's a"
"dynamics outside of space and time"
and
"the dynamics itself can be can be"
"stationary in the technical sense that"
"the entropy does not increase"
"so in some sense it's a it's it's a"
"timeless dynamics of consciousness in"
"the sense there's no entropic time"
"entropy is not increasing but you can"
"prove a couple things"
"it's trivial to prove that any"
"projection of this timeless dynamics by"
"conditional probability will lead to an"
"artifact of entropic time"
"in other words"
"the reason why space time isn't"
"fundamental is that time itself is an"
"artifact of a projection of a dynamical"
"system which itself need not be time it"
"need not have any time in the in the"
"entropic sense of time you can have a"
"sequence but not entropic time"
so
"from that we can then say suppose we"
"have a dynamical system of conscious"
"agents in which there's not competition"
"and there's not limited resources"
"it could still look"
like
"limited resources like time is is an"
"artifact that's a that's a limited"
resource
"evolution of a natural selection itself"
"that whole framework may be an artifact"
"of a projection of a system in which"
"there is no competition in which there"
"is no limited resource this would be a"
"complete revolution in our understanding"
"of how the whole universe works"
"so that's right because right now"
"we are not yet"
"a species that knows how to think"
"outside of time"
"and that's what we have to do it's a new"
"trick but we can do it we can learn to"
"think about structures outside of time"
"and perhaps outside of limited resources"
"once we've done that"
"once we've got so"
"the idea would then be have specific"
"models of conscious agent dynamics that"
"lead to specific"
"connections with like the amplitude and"
"the cosmological polytube so that we can"
"then give a dynamical systems"
"understanding of these static polytopes"
"that the physicists have found the"
"polytropes are just sitting there they"
"encode all the information but what are"
"they about you know why is there's this"
"platonic world of politics just sitting"
there
"isn't there some like dynamism behind"
"that that we should be understanding"
"even if it's not in tropic time there's"
"some kind of dynamism and that's what"
"i'm working on is a dynamism of"
"conscious agents whose"
"the goal would be to show that it's"
"asymptotic behavior precisely gives rise"
"to these polytopes and these polytopes"
"then the physicists show how to take"
"them into space time so we then see how"
"our interface is built"
"we have perception and consciousness now"
"being fundamental"
"but scientifically rigorous and then we"
"show all the way through the the"
"asymptotics of that projects into the"
"you know natural trihedron for example"
"which projects into space time we see"
"precisely how our interface is created"
"and then"
"we can play with the interface once we"
know
"what's beyond space and time with"
"mathematical precision"
"we can"
"expect new technologies that would not"
"be mind-blowing"
"and a new understanding of life so on"
"the technologies right now most of the"
"galaxies that we see"
"um we could never get to because they're"
"moving away too fast"
"so if we try to go through space to them"
"there's all this beautiful release real"
"estate that's waving at us and we can"
"never get to it"
"but if we don't have to go through space"
"time if we realize that space time is"
"just a data structure"
"maybe we can go"
"outside of it go around it we just don't"
"have to go through it that would be"
"truly stunning"
"but but the other aspect of this is that"
"that life itself"
"the distinction we make between living"
"and non-living"
"we think of it as a principal"
"distinction right we say you know a"
"person they're alive a mouse is alive"
"probably a bacterium yeah that's alive a"
"virus uh i don't know"
"a proton definitely not protons so we"
"have this idea about what's living and"
what
"from the point of view that space time"
"is not fundamental is just an interface"
"the distinction we make between living"
"and non-living is an artifact"
"of the limitations of our interface it's"
"not an insight into the nature of"
reality
"and so"
"so what we have to do is understand that"
"there's going to be this deeper level"
"perhaps you know a theory of"
"consciousness but"
"what that means is not that a rock is"
"conscious or that you know a proton is"
"conscious it just means that we're"
"dealing with the dynamical system of"
"consciousness and some of it we when i"
"see mike levin i get a pretty good idea"
"about mike as a conscious being and what"
"he might be feeling and so forth but"
"it's it's it's fallible but but pretty"
"good with a mouse i'm getting much"
"poorer and with the proton i'm getting"
"no insight into what i'm dealing with"
"but that doesn't mean that the first"
"that the proton exists is just a it's a"
"symbol it's an interface symbol and"
"second my statement that is not alive"
"that just means my symbol is not very"
"informative that's all so we have to"
"everything as you can see basically all"
"of our assumptions right now in science"
"in cognitive neuroscience trying to"
"understand almost every one of them has"
"to be"
"ripped apart and re-thought from the"
"ground up once we let go of space-time"
"being fundamental it's it's"
"so then it's we need to use a younger"
"generation that's ready to think out of"
"the box because that's where the the"
"resource the ideas are going to come"
mike
"yeah um well i think i think that don"
"and i could could run this on the same"
"island uh that's that's what"
"that's what i heard um okay i i would i"
"would do a couple of things uh i there's"
"a couple things i would tweak if i could"
"uh to to how things are done now the"
"first thing i would like to do is to uh"
"and i said this in that in that paper"
"the reason it's called a technological"
"approach to mind everywhere is that i"
"would like uh an engineering commitment"
"to these things such that"
"don't let's not have preconceptions to"
"how things"
"should be that chemistry is the best"
"level of explanation or that there's no"
"way that my thermostat has goals and"
"memories and you know and then work out"
"away from there let's let's just go with"
"whatever model is going to give us the"
"best prediction and control that's what"
"engineers do and uh and i and i take a"
"bunch of flack forward because some"
"people i've had people say you know"
"you're going to use you know prediction"
"and control as a as a you know as a"
"criterion of truth that's that's"
"terrible well what else you got i don't"
"know what else you have"
"i don't know i i honestly i i'm sure"
"it's i'm sure it's a philosophically"
"naive view fine but i i don't know what"
"else we have"
"i i"
"right so so to me all of this has to be"
cast
"in an observer"
"relative and i think don was was was"
"mentioning some of this an observer"
"relative um"
"kind of uh perspective where not ev"
"everybody's view of things is not"
"equally valid no but but we can compare"
"them and we compare them with empirical"
"experiment we do experiments on all this"
"we don't have feelings about this so if"
"you if you make a claim that some"
"particular system has zero agency or"
"very low agency or it can't do this or"
"it can't do that let's find out can you"
"train it can you communicate with it can"
"you right is it capable of of you will"
"be surprised as as we and others have"
"found out that you know you can look at"
"a gene regulatory network and say ah"
"this is the um you know this is a"
"paradigmatic example of determinism it's"
"just a bunch of arrows turning genes"
"turning each other on and off well guess"
"what they can do six different kinds of"
"learning right you don't know these"
"things until you try you can't just sort"
"of put you know"
"make make decisions about this from an"
"armchair so that's the first thing i"
"would say let's let's let's commit to"
"doing experiments and having"
"engineering uh be be uh the the kind of"
"role model for this that's the first"
"thing the second thing i would do is i"
"would do away with almost right almost"
all
binary
"uh categories so let's take evolution"
"and developmental biology seriously what"
"what they're telling us is that"
"almost everything of interest is a"
"graded continuum that that you can very"
"smoothly you know and if you think"
"there's some sort of"
"phase transition that happens let's zoom"
"in and let's make some chimeras and and"
"you will find out that in your in your"
"sort of what you what you thought was a"
"rapid transition there are in fact lots"
"of in between cases that are going to"
"give you a headache as far as trying to"
"decide is it cognitive or isn't it"
"there's no there's no way anybody's"
"going to draw any convincing you know"
"bright lines here right so so all of"
"this is it's um it's kind of like i use"
"the example of it it's kind of like the"
"category of being an adult right it's"
"useful in court and everything but we"
"all know there's nothing that magically"
"happens to you when you turn 18 that"
"makes this a scientifically valid notion"
"i mean nothing my son turned 18 today so"
"well listen up because because uh"
"nothing nothing much is gonna is gonna"
"change today uh right and so and so"
"people have these um you know people"
"have these categories it's is it a you"
"know is it a machine or is it alive is"
"it a robot it's not cognitive i'm"
"cognitive that's just phys none of these"
"categories are useful they're not going"
"to survive the next few decades as we"
"make hybrids and cyborgs and the"
"bioengineered things that all kinds of"
"pseudo pseudo problems arise by"
"pretending that there are that there are"
"sharp distinctions between these things"
"um so that so that's the second thing i"
"think we need to we need to get rid of"
"uh the third thing uh we need to"
"radically revise and this is this is"
"going to get if it touches very nicely"
"um onto things that don was talking"
"about is this question of where is it"
"encoded so people ask me all the time"
"when we talk about the goals for these"
"states they say well where is it encoded"
"because they're used to looking at"
"things like protein sequences where if"
"you ask me where is it encoded i know"
"exactly where it's encoded it's encoded"
"in the dna that's how protein sequences"
"work but most things don't work that way"
"so so for example there are many great"
"examples one example is um you know"
"there's this thing"
"called a galton board which is a piece"
"of wood you bang a bunch of nails into"
"it you take a bag of marbles and you"
"drop it into the top of the thing they"
"go boom boom boom boom they do this and"
"you get them with this beautiful bell"
"curve so now i ask you where is the"
"shape of this bell curve encoded you can"
"stare at the wood you can stare at the"
"nails you can look at the distribution"
"of the nails"
"it's not explicitly encoded anywhere"
"right here's another example let's say"
"evolution wants to make a triangular"
"organism it evolves the first angle it"
"involves the second angle does it need"
"to evolve the third angle nope it's"
"already there for you why are these"
"things where is all this stuff and so i"
"you know"
"i mean people people hate this kind of"
"talk but i think don was exactly right"
"somewhere in platonic space"
"there are"
"some sort of affordances from the laws"
"of computation the laws of mathematics"
"the kinds of things that uh don't change"
"when the laws of the universe change"
"right these truths of number theory and"
"all this stuff they are there for you"
"when you make the right machine when you"
"make a configuration of uh of matter"
"that somehow resonates with with these"
"things you you get to pull down these"
"very useful you know you give these very"
"useful things that live out i mean i"
"don't know where they are mathematicians"
"have been talking about this forever but"
"but it's exactly right if you make if"
"you if you use transistors to make a"
"little a little and gate"
"you get a truth table well where was the"
"truth table when you were put when you"
"were soldering the you know the the"
"transistors together that's not in there"
"you could you can x-ray it all you want"
"now you're not going to see it these"
"things are right this is my god it's"
"doing logic it's a truth table yep and"
"you didn't it's not anywhere that you"
"can get your hands on so so i do think"
"we need to get away from this simplistic"
"idea that"
"uh things have to be encoded somewhere"
"and and again you know people understand"
"emergence and complexity and all that"
"but it's it's way more than that and uh"
"and it's this idea that you don't need"
"to micromanage all this stuff because a"
"lot of it you get for free the kinds of"
"things that stuart kaufman talks about"
"the properties of networks properties of"
"you know biomechanical kinds of things"
"there's just an incredible amount of"
"stuff out there in computation and"
"physics and math"
"various machines get to use it and what"
"evolution does is is is tweak the"
"machines and a lot of the the hard work"
"is not done at the level of that"
"hardware at all it's just pulling down"
"these these capacities and so so a lot"
"of what the so so what's the work gonna"
"look like the work is going to look like"
"trying to understand map out the with"
"the the shape of that space"
"what space was it that had a zenebot"
"attractor in it right what what else is"
"in that space what else do these cells"
"know how to do and in particular for you"
"know and so applications talking about"
applications
"uh you know the ones that i can think of"
"are twofold one is regenerative medicine"
where
"we don't try to micromanage the process"
"and try to uh operate the way that we do"
"you know all molecular medicine today is"
"doing what what what you and don were"
"talking about before it's all about"
"rewiring the hardware it's all about you"
"know changing the genes the protein"
"pathways protein engineering all that"
"stuff that's fine but but let's let's"
"see let's we can go beyond that and take"
"advantage of the intelligence of the"
"system we should be operating with uh"
"proper experimentation as far as what is"
"the iq level of all the components what"
"do cells know how to do what does tissue"
"and organs know how to do"
"and can we can we do behavior shaping so"
"regenerative medicine to actually um"
"rewrite and we've done this in in"
"certain contexts to rewrite the gold"
"state and let the system do what what it"
"knows how to do right engineers you know"
"biologists don't often believe in goals"
"but engineers sure do otherwise you"
"couldn't use thermostats you can only"
"write you you have a thermostat because"
"you know full well you can depend on"
"this thing even though some stuff is"
"going to change it will get the job done"
"right so so so again you gain massive"
"amounts of of power that way that that"
"are just impossible from the bottom up"
"and then and then the other thing i"
"think that we're going to gain from this"
is
"uh is is uh is is general artificial"
"intelligence because by paying attention"
"to how it is that competent tiny little"
"competent parts scale up into large"
"selves so right so the scaling of"
"cognition the quad the competition and i"
"could tell stories about how that might"
"work competition and cooperation between"
"these things as they as they scale to"
"larger goals and more more profound um"
"stress states and things like that"
"that is how you build real real"
"intelligence that is that is um uh uh"
"self developed from the ground up from"
"pieces that don't know what they are"
"until they sort of form themselves"
"that's you know when people say ah you"
"know machines can never be you know"
"they're metal it's not the it's not the"
"substrate it's not the fact that what"
"they're made of it's not the fact that"
"they came off of a factory instead of"
"evolution it's not any of that it's it's"
"that it's that i think it's the process"
of
"self-creation using using basic"
"principles of of active inference and"
"limited resources and various other"
"things that are very generic"
"uh and then and then you have a system"
"that has true preferences like intrinsic"
"motivation and all of this stuff and it"
"really you know uh then then then you"
"have a real real agent as opposed to the"
"kinds of machines and ai we have now"
"which is set by somebody else by the"
"user the the creator says this is what"
"you are here's what you can do here's"
"the program that you're following you"
"know you're good to go and and and so on"
"so i think we can get way beyond that"
"gentlemen this has been great"
"i love just i i i had a"
"space nerd head buzz"
"talking to you about all this so"
"uh thank you both uh donald uh hoffman"
"author of"
"the case against reality and uh don"
"where can people find more of your work"
and
"so on"
