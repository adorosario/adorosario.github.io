so
"there any any microphones open"
"yeah i hear some echoes of people could"
"yeah i think we have to mute uh it's"
"it's us probably um so i will mute"
"myself before um once once you start so"
"okay we were having now like mike"
"levin's talk"
um
and
"i think"
"where is your screen share"
"are you sharing the screen"
"correct i'm already sharing the screen"
yeah
"can people not see my screen no we don't"
"we don't see your screen but"
"it might be you don't see the screen"
[Music]
[Music]
"there you go"
"okay so now we have you and let's"
"confirm with the other yeah the audience"
"can see it so we are fine okay welcome"
"michael thank you for participating in"
"our conference in workshop and"
"the stage is yours"
"very good uh thank you so much for"
"inviting me this has been an extremely"
"interesting workshop um lots of new"
"ideas and i look forward to sharing uh"
"some more information with you and some"
"thoughts uh all of the primary papers"
"and and if you need to get in touch with"
"me these two websites you can reach me"
"all the papers the data the software"
"everything is is there what i'm going to"
"tell you about today is a framework that"
"i've been developing based on um our"
"empirical data so probably about 15"
"years of of work at the intersection of"
"developmental biology and computer"
science
"that has driven"
uh
"my attempt to pull together some some"
"some deep ideas for how to understand"
"this and how to move it forward and i"
"call this tame t-a-m-e uh that stands"
"for technological approach to mind"
"everywhere and basically it's a"
"framework for understanding truly"
"diverse intelligences you'll see what i"
"mean by that based on uh fundamentals of"
"a kind of goal directed behavior in"
"unconventional agents so the main points"
"that i would like to transmit today are"
"these first"
"that the question of how much agency or"
"cognition uh is to be attributed to a"
"particular system has to be treated as"
"an engineering problem not philosophical"
"pronouncements of what various systems"
"can and can't have but actually um an"
"empirical approach uh to find the uh the"
"optimum level of description to uh"
"enable uh control and prediction of that"
system
"and i'm going to talk about the fact"
"that uh"
"very diverse intelligences can actually"
"be directly compared with each other and"
"placed in a sort of the same space if we"
"think about the spatio-temporal scale of"
"the goals that these systems are capable"
"of working towards so this gives rise to"
"a kind of a model of what i call the"
"cognitive light cone based on the types"
"of goals that these systems are able to"
"represent and pursue"
"and i'm going to show you that synthetic"
"bioengineering and some advances in in"
"biology provide an incredibly large"
"option space for new bodies and new"
"minds these new creatures don't have"
"standard evolutionary backstories in"
"this they are a very important set of"
"systems for impacting our understanding"
"of evolution"
"of what the genome actually does and and"
"so on and i'm going to show you some"
"very specific examples uh from"
"developmental biology looking at uh"
"morphogenesis as a kind of"
"unconventional collective intelligence"
"meaning the collective intelligence of"
cells
"solving problems in morphospace that"
"would be the example in which i'm going"
"to illustrate some of these concepts but"
"i think they're much much broader than"
"that and i'm going to show you some data"
"showing that developmental"
"bioelectricity provides an interesting"
"window on the scaling of cognition both"
"during development and during evolution"
"so um"
"i i started this framework uh"
"prompted by a really interesting"
"conference uh at the uh"
"diverse intelligence summer institute"
"that templeton foundation put on"
"where we were asked to come up with a"
"way to compare truly diverse"
"intelligences and this isn't just you"
"know humans apes"
"birds maybe octopus things like that but"
"it's actually it needs to a good"
"framework is going to enable us to uh"
"compare and contrast really unusual"
"creatures colonial organisms swarms like"
"ants and bees and so on but also"
"synthetic biology so engineered novel"
"life forms that never existed before"
"both unicellular and multicellular we"
"should be able to use the same framework"
"with ai so artificial intelligences"
"whether embodied or purely software or"
whatever
"and of course exobiological agents"
"that we may find during exploration of"
"uh off off the planet if that ever"
happens
"and uh the key to this framework is that"
"it has to move experiments forward it"
"cannot be pure philosophy it has to"
"actually uh suggest make predictions and"
"suggest novel capabilities so the"
"outline for today's talk i'm gonna uh"
"isn't basically in three parts first i'm"
"just going to talk about uh some"
"examples and some"
"uh some some"
"some ways in which we can we should"
"broaden typical cognitive science"
approaches
"then i will talk about this this"
"framework the philosophical principles"
"and then some some very specific"
"hypotheses for how we can define selves"
"and how cognition can scale and then i'm"
"going to show you the the vast majority"
"of the talk is data so i'm going to show"
"you how we've been using these ideas to"
"understand and control morphogenesis as"
"a collective intelligence and then i'm"
"going to show you some novel uh"
"synthetic organisms that that have never"
"existed before and these are called"
"zenobots so the first thing i want to"
"think about is the fact that"
"uh when we usually think about"
"intelligence and uh and cognition and"
"agency we think about this the subject"
"of all of those things the self so the"
"self is this construct that is the owner"
"of complex memories of uh credit"
"assignment among the individual parts uh"
"that that function together to to"
"provide positive and negative uh"
"outcomes uh it's the it's the owner of"
"goals and and uh preferences and things"
"like that and the interesting thing"
"about this is that biology shows us that"
"these these selves are extremely"
"malleable they change over time not just"
"evolutionary time but actually during"
"the time of the uh the time of the"
"organism so for example here's here's"
"one example so this is a caterpillar"
"and it's a creature it's a soft bodied"
"kind of creature that crawls and chews"
"plants and it needs to turn into this"
"very different type of creature that"
"flies and drinks nectar and because of"
"that the brain is completely different"
"so the caterpillar brain is quite"
"different from the um from the"
"butterfly or moth brain and during this"
"process of metamorphosis that brain is"
"largely liquefied the cells many of the"
"cells die most of the synaptic"
"connections are broken"
"and a completely new brain is rearranged"
"this is all during the lifetime of the"
"agent so if you know if you're"
"philosophically minded you can ask"
"yourself what it's like to be an agent"
"uh during during the time that your"
"brain is completely reorganized one of"
"the most amazing things about this is"
"that the memories which caterpillars"
"have in fact persist through this"
"process so the the butterfly remembers"
"training that um the caterpillars"
"underwent and there's there's"
"some nice data on this you can see"
"reviews of that here"
um
"but this is this is in fact not just for"
"for unusual metamorphosing creatures all"
"of us made the journey of the cartesian"
"cut from a single cell so we all started"
"life as a single fertilized egg this is"
"something that molecular biologists"
"would look and say this is a machine"
"this is uh this you know it's a"
"molecular machine it has lots of"
"biochemical components functioning"
"according to rules um"
"it's a very nice uh you know it's a it's"
"a it's a very nice piece of physics and"
"then at some point this um this is"
"self-assembled into one of many"
"creatures inc some of which at least or"
"possibly all of them have what we"
"consider to be cognition let's say a"
"human in the case of a human embryo so"
"all of us went from undertook this"
"journey and so so"
"one thing that is clear in biology is"
"that there is no sharp line that is"
"supportable where you can say this was"
"just physics and then something happened"
"and now you have a cognitive being so so"
"we have to understand how um how"
"cognition scales gradually across these"
"kind of it scales and it modifies"
"gradually uh both during evolutionary"
"time scales and"
"the animal's own development so this is"
"another way in which ontogeny"
"recapitulates phylogeny because we all"
"take this take this journey"
"so in fact"
"uh we like to think of ourselves as"
"integrated beings intel true"
"intelligences and then maybe ants and"
"bees have some sort of collective"
"intelligence but actually we are all"
"collective intelligences we are all made"
"of parts uh we are in particular we have"
"um collections of neurons and various"
"other cells and so when you look through"
"uh through life forms you see that they"
"are made of nested subunits not only"
"structurally we all know that we are"
"made of organs made of tissues which are"
"made of cells and so on not just"
"structurally but actually"
"functionally and uh cognitively because"
"there's this evolution uses this"
"multi-scale competency architecture"
"where every layer solves problems so"
"from the swarm to the individual animal"
"to the organs to the"
"cells in the subcellular components all"
"of these systems uh solve various kinds"
"of problems in diverse spaces okay now"
"what evolution does is reuse some of the"
"same problem-solving tricks in different"
"spaces now we are all very uh familiar"
"with understanding intelligence when we"
"see it as uh operating in"
"three-dimensional space behavioral space"
"so we see these birds they know how to"
"pick up cigarette butts and receive a"
"reward and and we say okay that's pretty"
"intelligent the bird has learned"
"something all of our sense organs point"
"outwards and so we are we are very"
"familiar many many animals are very good"
"at detecting agency in the outside world"
"but if we had sense organs pointing"
"inwards let's say a kind of uh"
"biofeedback where at every step of the"
"of the of"
"your life from from childhood you knew"
"exactly what your liver or your pancreas"
"was doing with respect to what are the"
"physiological states what are the uh the"
"the actions that it takes we would then"
"have no problem recognizing some of"
"their behavior as intelligence and what"
"i mean by intelligence is simply problem"
solving
"and to move to uh better regions of some"
"state space and these spaces might be"
"the space of all gene expression of"
"course these are all very high"
"dimensional spaces i sort of collapse"
"everything into two spaces here but the"
"space of all possible gene expression"
"amorphous space which we'll spend the"
"most of the talk about which is the uh"
"the the the space of possible"
"configurations of the body so so anatomy"
"anatomical space and physiological space"
"okay there there are many many examples"
"here your organs and your cells are"
"solving problems in these spaces all the"
time
"and we should we should be humble about"
"the fact that when we look at a system"
"and try to understand how much and what"
"kind of intelligence it has we are"
"ourselves taking an iq test because"
"recognizing goal-directed"
"problem-solving behavior in a system"
"requires us to be smart enough to notice"
"it to notice the appropriate space and"
"to understand what is the system doing"
"and many times when we don't see that we"
"need to ask ourselves if if"
"if we're in fact missing something"
important
so
"one of the things we can say about"
"intelligence in all these spaces is"
"basically that a kind of a generic"
"statement is basically that"
"it's proportional to the ability uh to"
"to stay out of local local minima to"
"have a uh kind of a a wider view of what"
"actions you should take so that for"
"example you know this from from here to"
"here is the most direct path where where"
"this dot can get to where it wants to go"
"but actually if it if it was willing to"
"have some patience and walk away from it"
"for a while it could then do much better"
"right and so so there's this there's"
"this sort of local energy barrier that"
"the more intelligent you are the more"
"you're able to overcome these kinds of"
"things and one of the things that we now"
"are able to do with uh with with"
"chimeric and bioengineering technologies"
"is take this multi-scale biological"
system
"and replace any at any level replace"
"components of this with new uh"
"components that might be engineered"
"and they might be other cells or or"
"molecules of other creatures"
"and so we can build these composite"
"beings that are"
"not standard issue evolved creatures so"
"we can replace um we could we can"
"replace any level of organization we can"
"replace with components that are"
"somewhere on this uh on the scale"
"somewhere between evolved and designed"
"so maybe they're natural maybe they're"
"modified maybe they're completely"
"engineered and they will have some"
"degree of intelligence maybe they're"
"just pure mechanism in the sense of"
"the very passive mechanisms or maybe"
"they will be uh quite quite intelligent"
"problem-solving uh problem-solving"
"components and already we start to see"
"this right so you have humans with"
"various appliances so so basically early"
"stage cyborgs we have bioengineered"
"animals we have synthetic"
"machines like hybrids which are brains"
"driving robotic bodies and so on"
"and so so you can see this at every at"
"every every portion we can start to"
"replace these these these components"
"right with whether with with dna or with"
"tissues and so on and all of these are"
"going to be somewhere on this on this"
"hierarchy see what's important about"
"this is once we start changing all of"
"these things we can no longer use the"
"familiar touchstones of phylogeny we"
"can't say well this kind of looks like a"
"fish so therefore i expect fish level um"
"sophistication of cognition because the"
"all of these uh synthetic and we'll come"
"we'll come back to this the synthetic um"
"creations are"
"not going to have uh origins or"
"components that make it very easy to say"
"what's going on so we need a kind of"
"cybernetic understanding of of of"
"cognition that isn't based on what"
"you're made of or how you got here but"
"is actually based on much more much much"
"deeper um principles of what your"
"cognition is like and so that's so so"
"that that's uh it is is the beginning of"
"how we started thinking about this"
"uh this this this approach and uh uh we"
"let's let's talk a little bit about uh"
"some of the theory now and then and then"
"we'll get to the data so"
"the foundations and and i only say this"
"because i like to make these this"
"explicit you're gonna see all of this in"
"the next stuff in the next sections but"
"i'd like to i like to make the"
philosophical
"underpinnings of all this completely"
"explicit so we all know we all know"
"what's going on nothing is hidden here"
"the first thing is that i think we need"
"to take evolution and developmental"
"biology very seriously and that means"
"doing away with binary categories you"
"know when we talk is it really cognitive"
"is it just physics or is it does it have"
"real memories you know"
"there are no sharp categories here"
"everything is is very gradual and we'll"
"we'll talk about that"
"the point here uh is that we're not"
"we're not trying to anthropomorphize"
"simple systems in fact there's"
"nowadays now that we understand"
"evolution and bioengineering i'm not"
"sure there's any such thing as"
anthropomorphizing
"in the sense that you know humans have"
"some sort of magical properties that can"
"be incorrectly attributed to other other"
"types of beings i don't think that"
"exists i think as long as you're"
"appropriately scaling uh your uh your"
"model to whatever system you're working"
"with and it's giving you uh empirical"
"advantages um"
"that's that's how we have to do this uh"
"because there's there's no other there's"
"no other way to do it and so we're i'm"
"going to stick very closely to an"
"engineering approach where uh i'm not"
"worried about uh talking about goals uh"
"in the in the cybernetic sense um i'm"
"not talking about"
"i'm not worried about trying to avoid um"
"you know attributing too much agency to"
"things because attributing too much"
"agency is just as bad as not attributing"
"enough right to an engineer these are"
"these are identical errors and so uh"
"we'll talk about the fact that agents"
"are a patchwork of multiple"
"unconventional intelligences at"
"different levels i don't believe there's"
"any magic in the material there's"
"nothing really magic about synapses or"
"protoplasm or anything else so we're"
"going to be material independent here"
"and i really want to understand biology"
"which chris langton refers to as life as"
"it can be right so not zoology not just"
"the types of plants and animals we have"
"here now but actually"
"what what's what's unique um"
"what's what's unique and important about"
all
"cognitive systems"
"so one of the things that uh that this"
uh
"this framework does from an engineering"
"perspective is simply uh say that there"
"is a uh there's a continuum a smooth"
"continuum with with some some some"
"waypoints you know alongside along this"
"journey where the way that you need to"
"understand the the cognitive capacity of"
"whatever system you're dealing with"
"is really defined by what is the"
"the most efficient most most optimal way"
"to interact with that system the way to"
"change the way the system functions so"
"if you're dealing with a certain class"
"of of of hardware systems like like"
"clocks for example your only option is"
"modification of the hardware at the"
"lowest level you're not going to teach"
"it anything you're not going to convince"
"it of anything hardware modification is"
"your only is your only option"
"then there's a there's a more"
"interesting class of devices like"
"thermostats which uh which are a little"
"further along because they have"
"an encoded set point right so they have"
"they they spend energy to get to to"
"maintain a specific goal state and you"
"can interact with them in a very"
"interesting way you can rewrite or alter"
"the goal state and then the machine will"
"now pursue pursue that goal let's say a"
"different temperature range without you"
"having to rewire the hardware you don't"
"have to change the hardware of the"
"system in fact you don't even have to"
"know about the hardware you don't have"
"to know how it works if as long as you"
"know what the setpoint is you can"
"recognize where it's encoded and so on"
"then there's another there's a whole"
"other class of systems"
"like this where"
"you actually need to know even less"
"about what's going on because you can"
"train them and so human beings have been"
"training animals for thousands of years"
"without knowing any neuroscience because"
"they appreciated the important fact that"
"systems like this can be"
"can be modified based on stimuli based"
"on rewards and punishments and you can"
"actually rely on the system itself to"
"reconfigure its own internal"
"mechanisms right in terms of plasticity"
"and then various other things and you"
"don't need to do that you don't need to"
"micromanage it you don't even need to"
"know how it works you just need to"
"understand how to motivate the system"
"how to communicate with the system and"
"then we get to some very advanced"
"creatures here"
"where you can actually communicate not"
"simply with rewards and punishments but"
"actually with with cogent reasons for"
"doing things so this is this is a very"
"engineering approach because because the"
"idea is not to have philosophical um"
"sort of feelings about whether"
"thermostats do or do not have real"
"desires the point is actually for any"
"given system well in any given let's say"
"novel biological or novel um"
"kind of engineered system uh this it's"
"it's the the the task is very simple"
"which kind of model gives you the best"
"prediction of control so using these"
"kind of models on these systems"
"will give you"
"nothing of use but actually using these"
"kind of models on sophisticated systems"
"actually leaves a lot on the table as"
"far as capabilities and this is one of"
"the limitations of modern molecular"
"medicine is that the assumption is that"
"everything is a a a piece of passive"
"hardware like this and must be dealt"
"with at the hardware level so genomic"
"editing pathway"
"rewiring pathways protein engineering"
"everything is focused on on the hardware"
"we've actually done a lot of work"
"showing that uh some of these other"
"approaches are much more powerful in in"
"medical um kinds of circumstances where"
"you're trying to get the system to do"
"something complex so"
"um the uh the the one way to uh think"
"about how all of these different uh very"
"diverse types of systems can be related"
"to each other is simply to try to map"
"and again i've collapsed space into one"
"dimension this is almost like a"
"minkowski kind of diagram where we can"
"collat we can we can plot on a diagram"
"of space and time what is the scale of"
"the goals that a given system is able to"
"pursue now remember this is not a"
"diagram of how far a system can sense or"
"how far away it can act but actually the"
"size of the goals that a system is able"
"to pursue so if you're a bacterium or"
"something or a tick or something like"
"that you are only interested in very"
"local concentrations of certain"
"compounds you may have a little bit of"
"memory going backwards you may have a"
"little predictive capacity going"
"forwards but everything you're doing is"
"in a very small"
"radius of of of a goal directed activity"
"you're only interested in"
"very local things and in fact you're not"
"capable of caring about"
"things that are very far away so so it"
"forms a kind of cognitive light cone of"
"the things that you are even that your"
"cognitive system is capable of doing and"
"so we can think about other other"
"animals that may have some pretty good"
"memory going backwards a little bit of"
"prediction of predictive capacity going"
"forwards but still unable to really uh"
"care about things that are going to"
"happen two months from now in the next"
"town it's just impossible right for some"
"of these but if you're a human for"
"example you might have an enormous light"
"cone in fact uniquely among animals you"
"might care about things that will for"
"sure take longer than your lifespan some"
"of your goals are actually not"
"achievable because their your lifespan"
"is not as as as big as your goal space"
"and then we can imagine all sorts of"
"other shapes for for possible alien or"
"synthetic kinds of creatures and of"
"course all of this is nested so we are a"
"patchwork of uh modules within modules"
"each of which is capable whether in"
"physiological space or anatomical space"
"or behavioral space contain various"
"sizes of goals right very large very"
"small and so on now what's what's really"
"interesting is that um"
"uh the scale of these cells can change"
"quite rapidly so here this is this is"
"one cell this is a lacrimal area there's"
"no brain there's no nervous system this"
"is one cell that is handling all of its"
anatomical
"physiological behavioral metabolic needs"
"at the level of a single cell now these"
"cells um"
"you know relatives of these single cells"
"can communicate can collaborate together"
"to work on very large things here you"
"see a multi-cellular body this is a"
"salamander if you amputate the limb the"
"cells immediately begin to grow they"
"will continue to grow and shape a new"
"limb until it's complete and then they"
"stop so we'll talk in a minute about"
"what this is this is a an anatomical"
"homeostasis where the set point is very"
"large all of these cells are solving a"
"problem in anatomical space they start"
"out in a region of"
"of anatomical space that's not good they"
"want to get to the much better region"
"that is their goal and they know how to"
"the collective is able to to get there"
"so that's the scaling of goals that"
"occurs during evolution but there's"
"actually a reduction that takes place"
"and we call that cancer so what happens"
"is when individual cells and this is a"
"human glioblastoma"
"when individual cells become"
"disconnected functionally disconnected"
"i'll show you how this works"
"functionally disconnected from these"
"large scale goals they revert back to a"
"ancient unicellular amoeba-like"
"lifestyle where their only goals are to"
"reproduce and to optimize certain"
"metabolic functions which means migrate"
"wherever life is good okay so the so the"
"boundary between self and world"
"in this case these cells basically treat"
"the rest of the body as just that"
"external environment they're not more"
"selfish than any other than any other"
"biological construct they're equally"
"selfish it's just that the self is not"
"very small right so that boundary"
"between self and world can grow and and"
"shrink and so the way the way you can"
"schematize it is simply this that"
"you have individual individual cells and"
"this takes place at many layers i'm just"
"going to i'm going to introduce this"
"with this example of cells so um"
"individual cells have some uh degree of"
"uh being able to uh compute and and and"
"remember and make predictions about um"
"states of of their local environment but"
"when they"
"join into networks these uh these net in"
"particular i'm gonna talk about"
"electrical networks these networks are"
"actually have a lot have have higher iq"
"they're not only measuring um"
"information from from wider"
"uh from wider spatial areas meaning"
"they're integrating lots of lots of"
"signals spatially but they actually have"
"higher computational capacity and"
"they're able to uh they're able to have"
"larger scale goals and so so this is"
"what we see you can you can sort of"
"track the the the width and space and"
"time of the um"
"uh of of what these cells are concerned"
"with and here's a very important um"
uh
"component of this which is which is"
"which is stress this idea that what what"
"stresses uh what you know what's what"
"stresses different kinds of agents is is"
"basically a delta between your goal"
"states and the state you're in now right"
"stress is what drives you to make"
"changes whether it be through gene"
"expression or physiology or behavior to"
"get closer to your goal so stress is a"
"kind of metric"
"but what's very interesting about stress"
"is stress isn't just that delta stresses"
"the ability to export that delta to your"
"neighbors so the idea is that all of"
"these cells"
"are able to uh measure something much"
"measure states much larger than what"
"individual cells can can can care about"
"and uh and thus and thus reduce the the"
"delta for much more complex states so"
"one can say that uh if you tell me what"
"you're stressed about i can make a"
"pretty good guess about your cognitive"
"sophistication so if you're stressed"
"about loc"
"if the most complicated thing that could"
"possibly stress you is local uh glucose"
"level then you're probably something"
"like a bacterium if you're stressed"
"about uh you know the state of the"
"economy um on earth then you're probably"
"a human level or or above these you know"
"being able to be stressed by complex"
"large scales of events is a very"
"a strong driver of sophistication and so"
"what you can see this is now let's let's"
"look at some of some some data here what"
"you can do is you can uh introduce uh"
"oncogenes in particular human oncogenes"
"into normal cells in this frog embryo"
"this is a tadpole so here's here's the"
"eye here's the gut"
"the spinal cord is back here so we can"
"introduce these these oncogenes and what"
"you can see the first thing that happens"
"when these oncogenes are active is they"
"cause the cells to detach electrically"
"from their neighbors and to enter an"
"aberrant bioelectrical state this is a"
"voltage map and i'll show you in a"
"minute we use this a lot we map the"
"electrical state of these cells and here"
"they are you can actually catch them"
"converting to"
"uh two of this kind of ancient"
"amoeba-like state and uh and and"
"the the most important thing is that you"
"can actually suppress this process"
"despite the fact that the oncogene is"
"there if you grab control of the"
"bioelectric state of the cell by"
"co-injecting an ion channel that's going"
"to uh even though the oncogene is very"
"strongly expressed there there may be no"
"tumor because you're managing the uh the"
"goals that these states are going that"
"these cells are going to follow they are"
"now connected to their neighbors and"
"they're all working towards making a"
"nice uh you know nice skin muscle and"
"and everything else"
"one of the most important uh things that"
"evolution discovered to to do that uh is"
"this thing called a gap junction so gap"
"junction is this uh it's a it's a"
"primitive synapse it's an electrical"
"it's an electrical synapse uh used"
"throughout the body that enables cells"
"to directly communicate with each other"
"through their um"
"to connect to directly connect their"
"intercellular millers and what that"
"means is that"
"uh traditional signaling like this you"
"have one cell and it produces some kind"
"of signaling factor and uh it it you"
"know it diffuses and this cell can feel"
"it this it's very easy for these cells"
"to remain to um remain separate and keep"
"their identity because once you receive"
"a signal like this you know it came from"
"the outside and so you can ignore it you"
"can you can you can remember it or you"
"can not remember it"
"you have"
"this cell has its set of memories and"
"this cell has its set of memories about"
"past events that have happened and it's"
"very easy for them to be separate but"
"once cells become coupled by these gap"
"junctions something very interesting"
happens
"the information that comes across does"
"not have any metadata about the owner"
"okay so anything that happens to this"
"cell that triggers some kind of a second"
"messenger response that serves as a as a"
"memory engram of that experience once"
"that propagates into this cell"
"this cell now has no way to tell whether"
"that information originated within with"
was
"related to this cell or in fact it came"
"from this cell so all of the experiences"
"and um and prior history of this cell"
"are now shared by them both they cannot"
"separate uh who's who it's a kind of"
"mind meld so to speak because their um"
"their uh internal medias are linked in"
"an important way and so now a lot of"
"their individuality is is really"
"stripped right you get you now get this"
"one system with a larger uh larger"
"networks larger iq lots of memory of of"
"what happened to both cells but it's no"
"longer possible to keep that very strict"
"um separation and this is how goals"
"scale so"
"what you can do and and we're making um"
"some very um"
"uh some very rigorous models of this is"
"you can start with very simple"
"homeostatic loops single cells all they"
"do let's say ph right all they do is"
"they sort of they measure the ph they"
"compare the set point and then they"
"either um load acid load or efflux"
"that's it and so so these very small"
"very humble goals once you start"
"connecting these cells by gap junctions"
"you have a bioelectrical medium you have"
"this excitable medium that's able to"
"store and process very large states as"
"goals and this is something that's"
"that's been worked a lot in hopfield"
"networks and other kinds of um"
"systems so we are we are making those"
"kind of models to understand large-scale"
"memories uh in particular pattern"
"memories as a scaling of simple"
"homeostatic units in electrical networks"
"right it's a kind of a connectionist"
"approach so let's so let's look at let's"
"look at some um some real data and let's"
"see what you can do with all this so"
"we'll do two things we'll talk about"
"morphogenesis is a collective"
"intelligence and then uh we'll look at"
"this this novel proto-organism okay and"
"we're going to try to understand uh how"
"these goal memories are actually stored"
"and processed so the mechanisms by which"
"collective intelligences of cells store"
"set point information so the first thing"
"um i just want to mention is that there"
"are uh there's huge plasticity in living"
"things which has really important"
"implications for evolution this is a"
"this is a tadpole that we've made there"
"are no eyes in the primary where they're"
"supposed to go so these are nostrils"
"here's the brain here's the gut so what"
"we've done is we suppress the primary"
"eyes but we've we induced an eye on the"
"tail and we can have a separate"
"discussion about how we do that we do"
"that through the"
"techniques that i'm talking about today"
"we induce the eye on the tail and we"
"have this machine that tests these"
"animals for visual learning it basically"
"trains them for certain behaviors and"
"visual visual cues we find out that"
"these animals can see perfectly well um"
"this this eye uh synapses onto the"
"spinal cord not the brain and their"
"behavior is quite normal they can they"
"can learn they can see"
"uh they're very nice very nice visual"
"behaviors and so what this means is that"
uh
the
uh
"the ability of of uh of evolution to"
"explore the um the the various"
"configurations is greatly potentiated by"
"the fact that if things happen let's say"
"there's a mutation that moves the eye"
"uh no problem your behavioral repertoire"
"doesn't automatically fall apart such"
"that now your fitness is very low in"
"fact the animal can the animal can still"
"uh still function and then you can"
"explore other um other consequences of"
"of that mutation so"
"so this is so this is really important"
"and this ability this this plasticity"
"and this ability to handle novel"
"circumstances right that's the key here"
"is the novelty this animal evolved for"
"millions of years to process visual"
"input from the eye fields but one"
"changed and and and it can it can handle"
"this this is another example of uh"
"problem solving in physiological space"
"so here's here's a flat worm these are"
"planaria i'm going to show you much more"
"much more of this these flat worms have"
"this amazing property of regeneration so"
"if if you cut off their heads for"
"example they will regrow a new head in"
"fact they regrow everything so what we"
"found is that if you take one of these"
"planarians and you um"
"expose them to barium chloride so barium"
"is a non-specific potassium channel"
"blocker it's a really a bad problem"
"because now these cells can't uh pass"
"potassium so the heads of of the heads"
"of these planaria literally explode um"
"overnight they just go ahead"
"deprogression they literally explode but"
"what's incredible is that over the next"
"couple of weeks if you leave the animal"
"in the barium they will regrow brand new"
"heads that are completely normal that"
"are barium adapted they have no problem"
"with barium whatsoever so what we did"
"was we we did some transcriptomic"
"analysis to simply ask the question what"
"what new genes are expressed in these"
"animals that are not expressed in these"
"animals you know how is it that their"
"barium adapted what happened and it"
"turns out it's actually a very small"
"number of genes that was changed in"
"order to uh to do this so now think"
about
"the uh the critical part here is is two"
"things one is that barium is not"
"anything that planaria find in nature so"
"there's never been evolutionary"
"selection to uh to put up with with"
"barium that's completely novel and the"
"other thing is that cells in the system"
"don't reproduce quickly the way bacteria"
"do so you can't uh use some sort of a"
"selectionist explanation that basically"
"the everybody tries random sets of gene"
"expression and whoever survives"
"repopulates the head there's no time for"
"that these cells don't turn over that"
"fast so it's almost the problem here"
"think about this problem you have"
"tens of thousands of different genes"
"that you can turn on and off it's sort"
"of i visualize this as a nuclear reactor"
"control room right your your cells are"
"poisoned you have this physiological"
"stressor the cells are poisoned things"
"you know everything's melting down you"
"have to find a very small number of"
"genes that you're going to up and down"
"regulate to solve this problem you've"
"never seen this problem before how do"
"you know which things you are going"
"which genes you're going to turn on and"
"off and so part of that might be some"
"sort of generalization from other"
"problems you've had that may have been"
"similar for example um excitotoxicity"
"epilepsy things like that may be similar"
"to this but it requires an incredible"
"amount of uh problem problem-solving"
"ability to navigate that transcriptional"
"space that space of all gene expression"
"to find"
"exactly what you're looking for so"
"so that's so that's an example in"
"physiology now let's look at"
"examples in anatomy so this this here is"
"a cross-section through uh the kidney um"
"tubule of a newt of a salamander and if"
"you look the normal uh tubule has you"
"know eight to ten cells or so that is um"
"that that work together to build a lumen"
"of a particular size right these tubules"
"have a particular diameter what you can"
"do is you can make uh you can make these"
"newts with uh progressively larger cells"
"and you do that by um inducing extra"
"copy numbers of their chromosomes"
"amazingly the cells put up with it and"
"they just simply get bigger the cells"
"the cells get bigger as the cells get"
"bigger what you will see and this isn't"
"our work this is this this goes back to"
"the to the 40s what you will what you"
"will see is that"
uh
"fewer and fewer cells are now working"
"together to make basically the same size"
"lumens so they're adjusting the number"
"of cells based on this really novel and"
"unexpected outcome of of having to build"
"a salamander with much larger bricks"
"okay so this is you know if we had we"
"had robotics building something you"
"could give it a completely different"
"size of brick and it would make"
"adjustments and and things would still"
"work we don't have anything like that"
"the most amazing part of this is that"
"if you make cells that are truly"
"enormous what will happen is just one"
"cell will bend around itself okay"
"and achieve the same outcome so"
"completely different molecular"
"mechanisms not cell to cell"
"communication but now cytoskeletal"
"bending that gets you to the same place"
"using a different set of molecular"
components
"in service of a large-scale anatomical"
"feature so this is very much looks like"
"a kind of top-down control where the"
"goal of making a tubule can"
"be uh can be implemented with with"
"diverse you know it's it's got that"
"degeneracy it can be implemented with"
"diverse molecular mechanisms and you"
"call it this the system executes uh"
"whatever it needs at the lower levels to"
"to to maintain um the correct region of"
"anatomical space at the higher levels we"
"we don't understand how this works but"
"it fits nicely william james's"
"definition of intelligence which is uh"
"same goal through different means right"
"the ability to reach your goal when"
"things are changing including in this"
"case not just changes of internal"
"external environment but changes of your"
"of your own components your cells are"
"now way bigger than evolution prepared"
"you for and you can still do what you"
"need to do"
"here's another example this is uh this"
"is a frog frogs unlike salamanders"
"normally do not regenerate their legs"
"and so um what we've done is we've in"
"some of our work uh that aims towards"
"regenerative medicine we've we've"
"figured out how to make them regenerate"
"their legs when you do that something"
"very interesting happens this is an"
"early leg these early here's here's a"
"toenail here's some toes these early"
"legs don't look anything like"
"the way that legs normally develop"
"eventually they get to the same place"
"and they make a very nice"
"frog leg at the end but the intermediate"
"paths are not like developmental uh"
"strategies at all in fact they look kind"
"of like a plant really um it's it's just"
"a different way to navigate more for"
"space to get to the same outcome so what"
"you see here is that biology has this"
"incredible plasticity of behavior of"
"physiology and of anatomical"
"construction to get to the same goals"
"via very different paths and"
"as i'm going to show in a minute also"
"from diverse starting positions so so"
"that plasticity that intelligence of"
"these systems is is really important to"
"understand and as we think about shape"
"we have a very basic question where is"
"anatomy specified in the first place i"
"mean you so you start life as a"
"collection of blastomeres right a bunch"
"of cells descended from from the egg and"
"uh this is a cross-section of a human"
"torso this is amazing look at this"
"incredible invariant order all of the"
"the cells the organs everything is in"
"the right position the right orientation"
um
"uh the right uh"
"uh the right location uh relative uh"
"relative to each other and so uh how"
"does it know where it actually uh wait"
"where these things should actually go"
"now people naturally say the genome but"
"of course uh"
"the the we know how to read genomes now"
"and what's in the genome is the"
"specification of the micro level"
"hardware dna specifies the proteins"
"there's nothing in the genome that"
"directly talks about anatomical size"
"shape symmetry type"
"you know it's all about the micro level"
"hardware so so we need to understand how"
"does this order arise we need to"
"understand if part of it is missing how"
"do we um"
"uh how do we repair or or edit this you"
"know how do we how do we get the cells"
"to rebuild and then as engineers we want"
"to go one step further and ask well what"
"else could these cells build and how"
"could we convince them to build"
"something completely different than"
"their default outcome and so um i've"
"already shown you this that these these"
"individual cells are very competent on"
"their individual cell uh scale but it"
"gets it gets much more interesting in"
"examples like this uh this here what"
"you're seeing here is this is a normal"
"tackle so here are the eyes here's the"
"brain here's the gut and these tadpoles"
"need to become a frog in order for a"
"tadpole to become a frog they have to"
"rearrange their face so this means that"
"they have to move their jaws have to"
"move forward their eyes have to move"
inward
"everything has to move and it was"
"thought previously that somehow the"
"genetics basically tells each organ the"
"direction and the um and the amount to"
"move because then you can always go from"
"a standard tadpole to a standard frog so"
"what we did was we made these we call"
"them picasso frogs they are completely"
"mixed up everything is in the wrong"
"place the jaws are off to the side the"
um
"uh you know the eyes are on the back of"
"the head everything is everything is"
"moved around and when you do this what"
"you find out is that they still make"
"largely quite normal frogs because all"
"of these organs will move around in"
"unnatural paths in fact sometimes they"
"go too far and actually have to have to"
"come back they will keep moving until a"
"correct frog face is built so what the"
"system actually does is the genetics"
"doesn't specify the move the movements"
"the genetics specifies the the the"
"the seed that constructs a machine that"
"minimizes error it's able to from from"
"novel starting configurations it's"
"progressively able to minimize the delta"
"between where we are now and what the"
"correct faces which obviously raises"
"some important questions how does it"
"know what the correct frog face looks"
"like so"
"um so so in my group what we've been"
"doing is this this is kind of the"
standard
"model of of developmental biology where"
"you have gene"
"regulatory networks that uh that turn"
"each other on and off some of these"
"genes make proteins that are sticky or"
"they diffuse or they're doing various"
"things so then there's this parallel"
"physics that goes on and then there's"
"this uh process of emergence where if"
"lots of individual pieces do the the"
"execute these these local rules then"
"eventually something very complex"
"happens like this nice um salamander"
"so so this is all true this all happens"
"of course of course there is a feed"
"forward emergent component to this but"
"there's actually also a very uh"
"important set of feedbacks that occur"
"both at the level of physics and"
"genetics and we're going to talk about"
"um the the physical one here today that"
"basically executes a uh"
"a loop of anatomical homeostasis when"
"the system is perturbed from its normal"
"target morphology and this might be with"
"injury with uh with with pre-cancerous"
"um conversions with uh teratogens"
"mutation anything that takes the system"
"away from this correct"
"shape kick-starts uh cascades that will"
"try to get back to the correct location"
"in um in morphospace so what we needed"
"to know was can we find the um"
"the storage mechanism for this set point"
"right every homeostatic process has a"
"set point and so what you want to do is"
"you want to find uh the storage"
"mechanism of the setpoint and you want"
"to know how to change it can we learn to"
"read and write these set points and this"
"is very important for the kind of"
"biomedical approaches that that we're"
"really focused on in my group because uh"
"making changes here which is what all of"
"molecular medicine tries to do is to"
"make changes somewhere somewhere down"
"here is incredibly uh difficult as a"
"means of changing what we really care"
"about which is anatomy right which is"
"solving birth defects and and traumatic"
"injury and aging and things like this"
"because reversing this to be able to to"
"decide what changes do you need to make"
"is incredibly hard this is an inverse"
"problem that's probably unsolvable to"
"try to in general to to to try to"
"reverse this"
"highly non-linear highly recursive"
"process to say what do i need to do at"
"the micro level to get me to a desired"
"system level state"
"so what we would like to do is we like"
"to change the set point leave all of"
"this intact the cells are very good at"
"implementing different set points we"
"just like to change the set points so"
"where is it encoded so we took our"
"inspiration from the brain"
"we know how this works in the brain"
"brains are an excellent system for"
"maintaining uh behavioral set points and"
uh
"being intelligent about getting to those"
"set points so we said how does this work"
"in the brain well in the brain"
"you've got some you've got some uh some"
"cellular hardware that basically"
"is a set of electrical networks that"
"is the home of the"
"interesting electrical dynamics which"
"you might call the software because it's"
"able to be changed by experience and so"
"on and what people in neuroscience are"
"doing is uh this project called neural"
"decoding so so the idea the commitment"
"is that if you were to uh read and be"
"able to decode all of the electrical"
"activity in the brain you could infer"
"the um the memories the preferences the"
"goal states you know that's where it's"
"all encoded it's all encoded in the"
"electrochemical dynamics of of what this"
"hardware is doing and what the nervous"
"system is using all this for is to"
"coordinate muscles in three-dimensional"
"space so that you can move around and do"
"various things"
"what did evolution where did this come"
"from you know in evolution this is"
"brains didn't just appear out of nowhere"
"these electrical systems are actually"
"ancient even bacterial biofilms have all"
"of this stuff so what did this look like"
"before we had brains before we had"
"muscles for large-scale behavior"
"it looked um actually surprisingly"
"similar it uh we have the exact same"
"scheme so you have all cells in the body"
"are actually producing these uh these"
"electrical uh dynamics through the"
"network and uh what you can do and this"
"is a video um of a early frog embryo"
"we're tracking the voltage this is not a"
"model or a simulation this is real data"
"you're looking at all the electrical"
"dynamics as you might when you look at a"
"brain that we could try to read and we"
"could uh test the hypothesis that these"
"electrical dynamics are the medium in"
"which the collective intelligence of"
"these cells is making decisions who's"
"going to be anterior posterior left"
"right how many heads do we have and"
"things like that so it's a very parallel"
"project to what neuroscience is doing"
"but taken away from sort of generalized"
"away from neurons and and asked about"
"all cells so"
"uh just again to nail this down all cell"
"this is developmental bioelectricity all"
"cells have ion channels all cells set"
"electrical um resting potentials they"
"communicate those through gap junctions"
"which we met a few slides ago uh that"
"can communicate them through um"
"to their to their neighbors using the"
"exact same mechanisms uh"
"and um and here you can you can read"
"about um how"
"how we think that uh that that"
"coordinating uh problems in morphospace"
"was the basis of uh intelligence in"
"behavior when evolution pivoted from uh"
"just coordinating the body shape to"
actually
"running around in three-dimensional"
"space by using muscles and uh and sense"
"organs and things like that so um"
"uh let's let's think about uh how then"
"if i'm i'm making the claim that that"
"these bioelectrical uh patterns are a"
"kind of cognitive proto-cognitive medium"
"for making decisions in the anatomical"
"space and i'm just going to show you"
"some examples of that so here's our"
"planarian here's the flatworm here are"
"the eyes the head here's the tail"
"what we can do is we can first ask let's"
"look at gene expression which of these"
"cells think they're part of the head"
"well it's this one these blue cells here"
"right so there's anterior gene"
"expression in the head there's none in"
"the tail that's very good so it's"
"supposed to be when you cut off the head"
"and the tail this middle fragment"
"remembers exactly what goes at each end"
"and pretty soon you have a new planarian"
"one head one tail fine now here's"
"another planarian again one head one"
"tail again anterior gene expression in"
"the um in the head that's fine when you"
"cut this guy you get something amazing"
"which is a two-headed form now this is"
"not photoshop these are these are real"
animals
"now why would this animal with normal"
"gene expression in normal anatomy why"
"would this animal suddenly by the way"
"this process is is a hundred percent uh"
"of fidelity you know it's habit it's"
"it's it's very hard to make them make a"
"mistake they always basically do this"
"correctly why would they suddenly make a"
"two-headed animal because in the"
meantime
"what we did was we looked at a"
"bioelectrical circuit that um"
"oops uh that we looked at this this"
"bioelectrical circuit and we realized"
"that there might be uh some uh there"
"might be a gradient some electrical"
"communication that allows these these"
"cells to to remember how many uh heads"
"they're supposed to have and where the"
"heads go and so what we did was we"
"learned to uh to to suppress this and"
"this is not with applied electric fields"
"or magnets or anything like that this is"
"by using um"
"rna interference and specific drugs to"
"target ion channels target the native"
"machinery by which these cells uh"
"produce the voltage gradients and what"
"we found is that um"
"these animals actually make uh"
"two-headed uh do these these ones once"
"uh the bioelectric circuit is perturbed"
"in a very specific way they actually"
"make two-headed animals and one of the"
"most amazing aspects of these uh of"
"these two-headed animals is that and i"
"keep calling this a memory here's why if"
"you were to recut this animal again in"
"plain water no more manipulations of any"
"kind so"
"you you chop off the primary head you"
"get rid of this ectopic secondary head"
"if you thought some of these cells were"
"you know epigenetically reprogrammed to"
"be ahead fine they throw them away all"
"we leave is this nice normal gut"
"fragment and that was nothing weird"
"about that about this gut fragment that"
"the the genetics are unchanged and so"
"you might think that it should just"
"regenerate a normal planarian but that's"
"not what happens they regenerate these"
"two-headed forms and if you cut those"
"they still regenerate as two-headed"
"forms and this is basically permanent"
"and we now know how to change that"
"circuit back with a with another brief"
bi-electrical
drug
"stimulation change it back to being"
"one-headed so the question of how many"
"heads a planarian has or is supposed to"
"have is quite interesting the default"
"that that the hardware specified by the"
"juno will make is one but that's not"
"really where the information is stored"
"the information is stored as i'll show"
"you momentarily in the real-time"
"electrical state of a circuit that tells"
"these cells what the target morphology"
"of a correct planarian is it is the set"
"point and that setpoint is not genetic"
"the genetics here are untouched we"
"didn't edit the genome or anything like"
"that we"
we
"change the encoding of what the correct"
"state is uh um considered by these cells"
"when they are injured and so"
"this meets all the properties of memory"
"it's long-term stable it's rewritable it"
"has conditional recall which looks like"
"this so"
"the reason that"
"that this guy made a two-headed animal"
"is that we looked at the bioelectrical"
"circuit here's what a normal one state"
"looks like the voltage here just tells"
"you one head and what we did was we"
"altered it and it's a little messy the"
"technology is still being worked out but"
"basically what we did was we induced a"
"different pattern memory in the exact"
"same kind of body so this says when you"
"are injured you will build to the target"
"morphology and this is what the correct"
"planarian target morphology looks like"
"make two heads and that's what it does"
"so to be"
"super clear"
"this electrical map is not the memory of"
"this existing animal this is a memory of"
"this one-headed animal so a one-headed"
"body a normal a normal body can store at"
"least one of two different"
"representations of what a correct"
"planarian should look like so this is"
"what i mean when i say the bioelectrical"
"state is the"
"protocognitive medium of this collective"
"intelligence the cells are literally"
"keeping a representation a visible i"
"mean we can read this now and we can"
"rewrite it a visible bioelectric"
"representation of what they should do if"
"they get injured until they get injured"
"this pattern is ignored it's a latent"
"memory it doesn't do anything once it"
"gets injured then you see what it is"
"because it guides them to make this this"
"two-headed worm now"
"this kind of approach can make uh"
"ectopic heads of the same species and"
"that's that's kind of"
"sufficiently surprising but if we can go"
"further than this and it turns out that"
"what you can also do is push the tissue"
"to recall memories that belong to"
"different species so here is one"
"planarian species that has a triangular"
"head you chop off the head you perturb"
"the electrical network in a particular"
"way where you basically prevent the"
"cells from communicating with each other"
"very well for 48 hours during that time"
"um everything gets kind of confused you"
"withdraw the drug the network settles"
"back down to a stable attractor when it"
"does that attractor sometimes is the"
"correct one so sometimes you get a nice"
"triangular head other times it lands in"
"the wrong"
"tractor that actually belongs to other"
"species of worms so you can get round"
"heads like this uh s mediterranean you"
"can get flat heads like this uh p felina"
okay
"um and it's not just the shape of the"
"head but actually uh the uh the shape of"
"the brain is changed to be just like"
"these other species or the just and the"
"distribution of the stem cells is"
"changed and again no genetic change here"
"we didn't do anything uh to to alter the"
"hardware we altered the ability of this"
"electrical network to remember what the"
"correct pattern is during regeneration"
"okay and"
"this is uh you know the the idea here is"
"not just to um"
"to to make weird-looking uh worms you"
"know worms and frogs there's a lot of"
"biomedical uh implications to all of"
"this where we're looking for um optimal"
"control of these kind of outcomes in a"
"way that doesn't require us to try to"
"micromanage gene expression and so on"
"which i don't i don't think will be"
"doable in our lifetime so"
"um you know there's applications here"
"for cancer obviously both diagnostics"
"and for normalization strategy so not"
"chemotherapy but normalization and of"
"course for um regeneration you know"
"using triggers to regenerate uh"
"regenerate complex organs such as limbs"
"so in the last few minutes i just want"
"to show you um uh step step away from uh"
"kind of natural natural bodies to show"
"you the the the real um the real"
"plasticity of of cells and and how"
"remarkable this is"
"so uh evolution provides standard"
"animals with a set of uh instincts that"
"operate in anatomical amorphous space"
"these are default outcomes this is why"
"uh acorns make oak trees and zebrafish"
"eggs make zebrafish right there's a"
"default outcome but much like in the"
"nervous system there is a lot of"
"reprogrammability here and so we"
"wanted to understand how much plasticity"
"there is"
"and so"
"we wanted these these new pattern"
"memories we wanted to see if they could"
"form uh very rapidly and we want to"
"understand where they come from so so"
"this is this is the work of uh staff"
"scientists in in my group doug"
"blackiston um we have a collaboration"
"through this new institute with uh josh"
"bongard's lab at the university of"
"vermont and um and his uh student sam"
"kriegman now a postdoc in my group"
"and what they uh what what they were"
"doing is computational analysis of the"
"following situation if you take cells"
"and you liberate them from their normal"
"environment right from the normal set of"
"instructive interactions that the cells"
"are that the other cells are telling"
"them to do you know this larger network"
"that has these bigger goals would they"
"reboot their multicellularity what would"
"they do okay well if would they"
"cooperate and if so what it what what is"
"it that they would build so we did this"
"simple experiment and here's the frog"
"embryo we take some some skin cells off"
"of the off of the top of this early"
"embryo so these are these are ectodermal"
"cells uh we dissociate them and then we"
"put them in a little um in a little"
"depression you can you can see that here"
"so basically we just dissociate them and"
"then we just pipet them down into this"
"little hole and so over the next uh over"
"the next 24 hours they will simply"
"compact like this okay you can see them"
"they compact together right and then um"
"here this is actually the flashing you"
"see is actually calcium signaling it's"
"um and some very interesting signaling"
"ionics but they make this this this"
"round sort of thing now they could have"
"made lots of they could have done lots"
"of different things they could have"
"crawled away from each other they could"
"have died they could have formed a"
"monolayer like you see in cell culture"
"could have done lots of things instead"
"what they do is they form something we"
"call a zenobot xenobot for xenopus"
"lavish that's the name of the frog and"
"uh it's a biobot platform so first of"
"all what you see here is that they are"
"self-motile so here it is swimming along"
"they have cilia the way the reason they"
"move is they have little um"
"little hairs known as known as cilia"
"that uh that they use to uh to to to to"
"row against uh against the medium and um"
"uh and so and so they they swim along"
"the cilia are normally used on the skin"
"to uh to move pathogens and mucus off of"
"the off of the surface of the frog you"
"can see here that uh that they have all"
"kinds of behaviors this one goes in the"
"circle this one sort of patrols back and"
"forth right"
"here is some tracking data on a group of"
"them this one's going on kind of a"
"longer journey this one is going in"
"circles these two are interacting with"
"each other"
"these skin cells normally are"
"restricted to a very boring"
"two-dimensional life sitting on the"
"outside of a temple by the rest by the"
"instructive signals from the rest of the"
"animal when liberated from this they it"
"turns out they have a completely"
"different capacity to cooperate and make"
"a new uh sort of little proto animal um"
"we didn't add anything we didn't edit"
"the genome this is uh we didn't"
"induce it we didn't put any um any trans"
"genes there are no nano materials all we"
"did was take something away we took away"
"the restrictive in in instructive"
"signals that the rest of the cells"
"impose and we ask these cells what do"
"they want to do so now you're starting"
"to see this this this multi-scale um"
"multi-scale competency architecture"
"where the plasticities that i've been"
"showing you about being able to correct"
"for all sorts of defects and so on is"
"because all of the components have their"
"own agendas which can be modified by the"
"larger scale network that they're a part"
"of but you can start to see this when"
"though when some of those are lifted now"
"uh here is here it is in a maze this is"
"filled with still water so there's no"
"water flow it's completely closed so you"
"can see it it takes the corner without"
"bumping into the edge um it then decides"
"to turn around and come back where it"
"came from okay so some sort of internal"
"uh dynamic so here it is i'm swimming"
along
"it can uh it can take this corner"
"without having to bump into the opposite"
"edge so it somehow knows that there's a"
"possibility to take a corner here and"
"then uh and then it turns around we"
"don't know why it turns around they have"
"all sorts of spontaneous behaviors right"
"in this system"
"they have the interesting capacity to"
"regenerate themselves so if you uh cut"
"them in half this one was basically like"
"pinched in half you can see here over"
"this 180 degree uh that hinge right"
"there right over that that 180 degree um"
"the forces the forces must be must be"
"really strong but was able to do is able"
"to try and fold itself back up into its"
"new shape into its new xenobot shape and"
"if you actually pay attention to the"
"calcium dynamics you can see it's very"
"brain-like they have this is you know"
"this is basically what what calcium"
"looks like um"
"in uh in in brains when you image living"
"living animals there are no neurons here"
"this is just skin everything that you've"
"seen was just skin cells cooperating"
"towards a new kind of morphology right"
"they have another very interesting"
"behavior that we first saw"
"that's a kind of hurting behavior where"
"they operate in groups like this and"
"they they they do these kind of circular"
um
"these kind of circular behaviors to make"
"little piles and and why do they make"
"little piles well the most amazing thing"
"is that um these little piles if these"
"little piles are themselves skin cells"
"then what they will do is they will push"
"them together into these little piles"
"guess what the little piles become the"
"little piles become"
"the next generation of xenobots so"
"there's there's a couple of interesting"
"things going on here first of all"
"this is a kind of replication it's not a"
"real lineage they don't have strong"
"heredity yet but it's a kind of uh uh"
"replication because"
"given components in the environment they"
"will uh make copies of themselves this"
"is much closer to um von neumann's idea"
"of reproducing machines than to the way"
"that any other organism reproduces right"
"so they will they will go around they"
"will make uh you know multiple"
"generations of these little balls and"
"the little balls become xenobots and"
"continue the cycle and keep doing it"
"again and again"
"one interesting thing is that um"
"what's happened here is that when we"
"made it impossible for these cells to"
"reproduce in their normal fashion within"
"48 hours they have found a new way to"
"pretty much do the same thing"
"that has never existed as to our"
"knowledge never existed in evolution no"
"other no other animal does this and so"
"uh this is an amazing example i think an"
"amazing example of problem solving and"
"plasticity when you can't do things the"
"original way you can repurpose your"
"existing hardware to swim around to uh"
"and then to undergo behaviors that will"
"actually uh do things that you can't do"
"the normal way that that's the first"
"thing the second thing to note here is"
that
"when we made these xenobots we"
"it was very much a collaboration between"
"us and the cells themselves we don't"
"know how to tell cells to assume a"
"particular shape yet all we were able to"
"do was to uh remove some some"
"constraints and put them in the new"
"environment the cells did all the rest"
"after that all the heavy lifting and we"
and
"this is this is very important because"
"it's a new kind of"
"robotics and engineering where your"
"material is not passive it is not active"
"it's more than that it's an agential"
"material right the new um i think the"
"future of bioengineering is of"
"engineering in general is working with"
"parts that are themselves"
"some sort of simple or maybe not so"
"simple homeostatic agent so that what"
"you're doing is you're not engineering"
"the way we normally engineer you"
"micromanage every part you have to know"
"how to do everything you are actually"
"signaling to with with you know you're"
"trying to shift the way that that that"
"your parts are going to behave because"
"they have their own behavior and"
"evolution does exactly that when these"
"when these bots make the next generation"
"of bots this only works because the"
"material they're working with the cells"
"that they are working with is itself an"
"agential material and is going to do the"
"same things on its own that's the only"
"reason this works"
"and that's and and the same is true of"
"evolution when you when you try to"
"change an organism you have to motivate"
"and uh and and uh uh effect it's guided"
"self-assembly the cells that you're"
"working with they have their own um they"
"have their own agendas and so what when"
"you see these xenobots they have a"
"normal frog genome and and these"
"zenobots don't have a straightforward"
"evolutionary backstory if you ask why do"
"xenobots have a particular"
"behavior and structure the answer is not"
"because for millions of years they were"
"selected to be good xenobots there's"
"never been any zenobots so"
"the cells themselves were part of the"
"evolutionary stream on earth but they"
"were selected for a completely different"
"set of um"
"functions so we really need to"
"understand how it is that evolution uh"
"doesn't make it doesn't find solutions"
"to specific problems it finds machines"
"that solve problems in novel ways right"
"so here's the here's the unique"
"developmental sequence of a zenobot this"
"is what normal frogs do they are they"
"look like this then they look like that"
"then they run around like this this is"
"what zenobots do they make a they make a"
"body like this eventually they will"
"transition and"
"you know two months later they"
"transition into something that looks"
"like that where does that come from"
"that's never existed before during"
evolution
"so um just to close up um"
"here's here's the uh the the summary of"
"what i tried to say is that uh"
"there is a framework which is really"
"focused on a continuum of agency not"
"binary categories it's very engineering"
"focused in terms of finding the best"
"most appropriate"
"models for to explain the scaling of"
cognition
"the materials uh don't matter there is"
"no privileged substrate one useful way"
"to think about systems is as the scale"
"of goals that they are capable of"
"of of pursuing we can think of"
"intelligence as problem solving in"
"abstract spaces and developmental"
"bioelectricity is a great way to start"
"to look at how competent individuals can"
"scale their goals and i think that's"
"exactly what um what evolution did and"
"we can certainly do that evolution is"
"hugely uh potentiated sped up by this"
"kind of multi-scale competency"
"architecture and the biggest to me one"
"of the biggest questions going forward"
"is where do these goals come from it's"
"not going to be selection where else can"
"they come from"
"and i just want to remind people that"
"now with the new technologies everything"
"that every every um organism you've ever"
"heard of right everything that darwin"
"meant when you said endless forms most"
"beautiful all of that is a tiny little"
"corner of this incredibly large state"
"space of cyborgs and hybrids and"
"chimeras and"
"all all possible combinations of evolved"
"material uh engineered material and"
"artificial intelligence and we're going"
"to have to be able to uh relate in some"
"way to these things when we're not able"
"to say uh what it is and what it's"
"capable of based on what it looks like"
"and where it came from so um lots of"
"lots of papers on all these things i'm"
"happy to um send send things out um"
"these are the um"
"the people that did all of the the hard"
"work of the things that i showed you"
"today so i thank them i thank our"
"collaborators um our funders of course"
"um and and the model systems which which"
"always do the heavy lifting and i will"
"uh stop here and thank you"
"okay oh"
"can you hear us michael"
"yeah yeah okay"
"well amazing talk what can i say"
"i'm i'm really really impressed i knew"
"some of your research personally but now"
"it's like see more i want to know"
"very very nice attractor of topics"
um
"well we start with the question around"
"anybody has questions"
comments
"yeah francis"
"well i think what this illustrates is"
"that agency is something uh very"
"primitive in life and agency is not just"
"adaptation as you say to very specific"
"selective pressures but it's"
"adaptation to"
"a wide range of things so it's the"
"plasticity it's the flexibility it's the"
"adaptivity that has been selected"
probably
"so i assume that these cells have some"
"general agential behaviors which adapt"
"to the circumstances and when the"
"circumstances are very different like in"
"the case of these server bots"
"i assume there is still enough agency"
"left that they can do"
"things that look kind of intelligent"
"even though they are completely"
"different from what they normally do"
"so yeah"
"it reinforces a little bit my uh"
"proposal in my talk that i said that the"
"first step is after self maintenance"
"it's resilience whereas means expanding"
"your basin of attraction that means"
"expanding the space in which you can"
"solve problems"
"so what these things probably have"
"learned a very long time ago before they"
"were folks is to expand this space of"
"problems they could solve so that now if"
"you take them out of their normal space"
"where they are in the focus body they"
"can still do things in this completely"
"different space because they have almost"
"this kind of genetic agency you might"
"call it"
"yeah yeah i think that's that's right"
"that's absolutely correct uh"
"of course one of the big mysteries that"
"we now have to address and we are we're"
"doing this in computational models and"
and
"and and at the bench is to really uh"
"understand how evolution is able to"
"produce this because the standard you"
"know sort of the standard story is that"
"evolution is supposed to always pick the"
"immediate um you know sort of short-term"
"benefit right and uh how it is that that"
"it maximizes this incredible uh ability"
"to problem-solve instead of uh a very"
"hard-wired and certainly there are"
"animals that act hardwired in various"
"ways you know c elegans and things like"
"that but but but larry but the majority"
"are exactly as you just said and so how"
"that arises from from evolutionary"
"dynamics that are that you know we're"
"always told are very um kind of"
"short-sighted and you know always taking"
"the immediate benefit it's it's not"
"clear and that that represents a huge"
"area for research uh"
"well my hypothesis is that when we think"
"about evolution we're thinking about"
"organisms that are already very highly"
"specialized and then they are already so"
"well optimized for certain things that"
"they can't afford to take risks to make"
"too many changes but if you think about"
"the origin of life and you think about"
"other catalytic systems or there are all"
"kind of molecules coming and going and"
"temperatures changing and and water"
"entering and drying out"
"these very first cells they had to be"
"extremely non-specialized they had to be"
"extremely silly they had to be extremely"
adaptive
"and probably these properties are just"
"properties that define life to have to"
"get to the first"
"living cells you have to have this"
"extreme adaptivity and then"
"when once you had this more specialized"
"organism you didn't need all these"
"functions anymore but they are still"
"there because they're probably the"
"essence of life"
"more comments questions"
no
well
um
"i have a little"
"question here"
"this hand has a little question"
"ah it's frozen"
"even better"
"yeah and"
um
so
"i as i understand you you are using the"
the
"the electrical"
"field on the cell"
"or the how what what electrical what is"
"the volt you measure the voltages but"
"what what would be like the the real"
"object that is uh"
"being uh measured there"
"yeah what what we're measuring is uh"
"the voltage difference between the"
"inside and the outside of the cell so"
"every cell has a membrane and there's of"
"electrical potential between zero and"
"let's say 80 millivolts that's between"
"the inside and the outside so what we're"
"looking at is if you think think about"
"um think about a neural network or an"
"artificial neural network where every"
"node has an activation level right and"
"so what we're looking at is the uh the"
"electrical state of every individual"
"cell but that's not actually where you"
"know that's not actually the the where"
"the information is the information is in"
"the flow of electrical computations"
"through the whole network so what we're"
"measuring is is the is the spatial uh"
"pattern and then over time we take"
"videos uh of each individual activation"
"weight it's exactly like um it's exactly"
"like neuroscience except that the time"
"is is greatly sk slowed down so all of"
"the you know you can take almost any"
"neuroscience paper and just do a find"
"replace in microsoft word replace the"
"words neuron with the word cell replace"
"millisecond with power and everything"
"else basically works it's it's the same"
"kind of thing yeah"
"so so this"
"pattern sat are across multiple cells"
"then it's not the oh yeah"
"yeah yeah yeah no that's critical that's"
"critical it's it's not individual cells"
"yeah yeah yeah yeah so okay so"
"yeah okay"
and
um
"so you are using now with there is this"
uh
"genetic information that is kind of like"
"the hardware you were mentioning then"
"you have the electrical field which is"
"the electrical component"
"which encodes an extra mechanism which"
"has been kind of like overlooked by"
"by evolutionary morphogenesis or like"
"for by the fields you were mentioning"
"and then i wonder"
um
"like this is that my wonder is like"
"might there all be other forces at play"
"um have you have have you studied or"
"measured or why would have to be only"
electrical
uh
"so so that's the"
"since there are many other physical"
"quantities that might have similar"
"dynamics dynamics and play a role of"
"meaning transmission and so on sure sure"
"sure there there have there are many"
"others and many people study them"
"there's biomechanical forces there's"
"ultra weak photon emission there are of"
"course chemical gradients that everybody"
"studies all of these exist uh"
"my claim is not that they're not"
"important or that bioelectricity does"
"everything no but but bioelectricity is"
"where the only data that i know of has"
"been uh"
"obtained where those bioelectrical"
"dynamics are actually the memory medium"
"of this collective intelligence it's"
"possible that you know 10 years from now"
"somebody will find out that the"
"biomechanical stress patterns are also"
"storing the same thing entirely possible"
"but it hasn't been done the only you"
"know these other these other forces have"
"been treated as"
"as pieces of physics at the lowest level"
"that need to be tracked to um to"
"understand the system and there by"
"electricity is exactly like all these"
"others but what we have shown i think is"
"that bioelectricity has a really"
"important role"
"as the uh as the as the actual medium of"
"the computation so it's like you know"
"you can look at a computer and okay yep"
"there are stress forces there are"
"vibrations there are um you know heat"
"gradients is all kinds of things going"
"on but if you want to uh really"
"understand what computations are doing"
"the bioelectric the the you know the"
"electric patterns through the circuits"
"have a privileged um status and maybe"
"these other modalities will have the"
"same thing it's entirely possible maybe"
"evolution uses them all but it's but"
"it's not known it's only known at this"
"point for the bioelectrics yeah yeah"
"that was my my question please drink"
yeah
"very amazing talk first of all and i"
"knew your work already so but okay it"
"was nice to see all these little details"
"explained carefully"
"no i i i'm a quantum physics sister so"
"electricity is"
"is fought on there so in a certain way"
"i wonder actually"
"certainly because you have this memory"
"effect sir so there is something new"
"being revealed here i think"
"that has not been really"
"identified and that is difficult to"
"to explain out of darwinian evolution"
"even in in in an easy way at least"
"in a straightforward way"
"well that's also the message which was a"
"little bit in your talk i think uh"
"so i wonder whether"
because
"it would be too long to to to tell you"
"the details now but i could send you"
"some some material there but let's say"
"we are working on on an integration of"
"quantum physics where this would fit in"
"in some way you see"
"that there would be things"
"happening on the quantum level in in in"
"photon clouds"
"which which which were not which not"
"have been revealed"
"yet yet clearly"
"that have to do with with meaning"
"meaning that would be stored in in in"
"light in some way"
"and uh"
"so so it's amazing it's amazing these"
experiments
"thank you i knew them already so it was"
"not the first time that i saw them but"
"let's say that"
"yeah yeah i'd be very happy to yeah"
"please send me uh yeah send me uh send"
"me what you have yeah i will send you on"
"an email because this would take too"
"long to make my own explanation"
"the kind of things that we want to"
"want to happen that we connect with each"
"other and also the"
"online audience can also bring"
"bring connections and why not keep keep"
"discussing i'm totally interested in"
"this and i know some people who will be"
"interested too so i'm kind of new to the"
"topic but it's extremely extremely"
"interesting as for me as well please"
francis
"another thing that i find very"
"interesting in your work i have heard"
"about it before this idea of the"
"cognitive boundary where you use the"
"metaphor of the white cone but i'm not"
"sure that's a very good metaphor because"
"the light curve kind of extends in this"
"way while yours comes together so maybe"
"more something like a cognitive horizon"
"i would say the horizon is as far as you"
"can see"
"and i personally have been using the the"
"concentratory for four years of prospect"
"the prospect is what you can see ahead"
"of you and what you can imagine to be"
"good or bad so perspective is both"
"anticipation and the notion of"
"good or bad of value the prospect is the"
"things you see potentially that you may"
"go to or that you may want to avoid"
"and i think your notion of cognitive"
"bond is very similar to my notion of"
"prospect and indeed the term in"
"evolution you might say is to extend the"
"prospect because the larger the prospect"
the
"easier it becomes to find something"
"valuable to go towards a goal that is"
"worthwhile and the easy it also becomes"
"to see the potential dangers and to"
"avoid them so"
um
"i just heard the commentary about uh"
"where they are there who had a kind of a"
"mystical philosophy but here he puts"
"intuitions he had this law of complexity"
"consciousness where he says during"
"evolution complexity and consciousness"
"increase at the same time and this"
"notion of consciousness was a little bit"
"like this notion of the cognitive"
"boundary as evolution progresses the"
"systems can see farther ahead and see"
"wider around them and that comes with"
"the idea of the laws here"
"by the internet now we can all in"
