"and that is brilliant during the winter"
"break i decided to brush up on the"
"fundamentals of information theory which"
"is what constructor theory is heavily"
"based in and i'd like to do an episode"
"on that so i took brilliant's course on"
"knowledge and uncertainty and random"
"variables and after taking that course i"
"could finally see why entropy is defined"
"the way it is why the formula for it is"
"extremely natural there are plenty of"

"to today's episode which is one that i'm"
"extremely lucky to be able to present to"
"you all you'll be able to see the mutual"
"respect that the guests have for one"
"another we start off actually by asking"
"what is it that you respect about each"
"other's work enjoy this theo locution"
"between carl fristen michael levin and"
"chris fields i've been extremely excited"
"about this"
"so professor what do you find unique"
"about carl's and chris's work and what"
"is it that you respect about them"
"well what a great question i think all"
"discussions should uh should should"
"start with that question um uh there's a"
"lot i mean i think i think uh the most"
"basic thing i can say is this that i'm"
"i'm often asked by by uh conference"
"organizers and students as far as who"
"who they should follow yeah who's whose"
"work they should um keep track of and"
"and so i keep lists and uh and and carl"
"and chris are at the very top of two"
"specific lists for me and i'm just"
"always amazed about this is that the"
"first the first is that um both of them"
"are experts in at least three different"
"fields but probably more so so so they"
"have the ability to kind of merge really"
"deep um understanding of different"
"fields i mean there's many people that"
"are experts in one thing"
"but i'm just i'm just always incredibly"
"impressed that's how they uh both of"
"them can we weave together a really deep"
"knowledge from from from diverse"
"disciplines and and and that leads to"
"the kind of the second thing that that"
"i'm really inspired by which is just the"
"kind of the sheer density of new ideas"
"you know it's hard enough to push things"
"in one just kind of one known direction"
"and do science and so on but both both"
"chris and carl's work um consistently"
"make me think in new ways uh give me"
"ideas i've never never thought of before"
"it's just just just amazing so yeah so"
"i'm super excited to be able to work"
"with both of them and to have this"
discussion
great
"chris same question but toward michael"
"and carl"
"uh well i can say that"
"one thing i certainly"
admire
"is that"
uh
"michael and carl are both"
"top-level biologists who are interested"
"in theory"
"and and deeply involved in theory"
"and have a deep understanding"
of
"uh theory"
and
uh
"something that i enormously admire"
"is that both of them"
"have that interest"
"and yet are deeply engaged in practical"
applications
uh
"carl and mental health and"
"mike and regenerative biology"
"and that's"
"a rare combination"
"carl what is it that you find unique"
"about michael's and chris's work and"
"what do you particularly respect about"
"them as people perhaps"
"i deliberately haven't rehearsed an"
"answer so what i say comes from the"
heart
um
"so with mike um"
"i first met him vicariously through a"
"friend giovanni pizzulo"
and
"didn't really know very much about his"
"work until i visited his website and"
"then i realized how influential and"
"important he was and then i recognized"
"all the little bulletins you get on"
"social media and emails i started to"
"recognize his name and realize that he"
"was you know he was quite a mover and"
"shaker out there"
"what i like about both of them they both"
"think really really fast and they both"
"think out of the box um"
"so i think what characterizes"
"both of their thinking really is just to"
"ask what is a thing in and of itself"
"without making any prior assumptions and"
"then putting it back together"
"from basic principles and coming up with"
"some sometimes counter-intuitive um"
"conclusions and but for me"
"almost uh universally exactly the same"
"counter-intuitive conclusions i've come"
"to after about 10 years of thinking"
"about a particular problem but never"
"dare tell anybody but they do they write"
"it down very eloquently and"
"they're very very productive"
"chris i've known for less long and i've"
"met him via mike um and"
"in addition to that in the same way that"
"many people i meet have physics envy and"
"i've got quantum envy uh for about chris"
"yeah he just seems to know so much"
"and think about the world in a way which"
"i don't have that sort of fluency in but"
"it sounds really really useful and and"
"quite correct so i'm hoping if i hang"
"around long enough some of it will rub"
"off on me"
"should be able to use the words without"
"sounding like an idiot"
"what would be an example of this"
"out-of-the-box thinking you mentioned"
"thinking about what is a thing in and of"
itself
"what else"
"there are numerous examples um the first"
"thing that just came to mind was just"
"putting together"
"fundamental questions about"
"self-organization if you were varela uh"
"you know so autophagus self-assembly"
"self-construction if you're a chemist it"
"would be self-assembly if you're a"
"theoretical biologist"
"um you will be wondering about why on"
"earth is it that um all multicellular"
"organisms form"
"because there's a deep paradox there yep"
"if it is the case that i have to have a"
"surface as a little organ"
"then some of myself have cells have to"
"stop replicating and yet that is in"
"direct contradiction to the principles"
"of natural selection i'm going to turn"
"off my reproductive capacity my adaptive"
"fitness so defined in a theoretical"
"context so i just really sit down"
"grasping the nettle i'm thinking about"
"well these things exist"
"what principles could possibly explain"
"the paradoxes were looked at from sort"
"of the unilateral the monothematic view"
"of natural selection for example or the"
"monothematic view of self-organization"
"in physics so thinking out of the box"
"literally in this instance um entails"
"being able to take multiple perspectives"
"on a particular problem and seeing the"
"contradictions and seeing how they can"
"be resolved now they'll be one of many"
"examples uh look there was a paper like"
"i'm afraid i can't remember the specific"
"one perhaps mike and chris will be able"
"to enlighten me but there was one"
paper
"written i i think about a year or two"
"ago where they actually listed i think"
"there were 15 basic conclusions about"
"the the fundaments and the and the"
"the nature of self-organization and self"
"as distinct from other uh in any system"
"and you know this listing uh"
"15 really interesting points and"
"predictions all of which either um i'm"
"sure will be formally demonstrably"
"analytically um"
"true uh or"
"at least yield or be amenable to a"
"mathematical analysis um or would be"
"empirically verifiable um over the next"
"few years"
"what was that"
"there was a paper in neuroscience of"
consciousness
of
"arguing for"
a
"an approach to consciousness that"
"spanned phylogeny"
"and we were very interested in that"
paper
"specifically to look at"
"bacteria and single cells"
"and um"
"facultative multicellular such as"
"microbial biofilms"
"and ask"
"what do these systems know about the"
"world how did they see the world"
uh
"how does it how does e coli perceive the"
"world for example"
and
"we suggested that"
"the the answer is in in terms of of the"
"sorts of things that we call taste and"
viscosity
"but that"
"experiences of taste and viscosity are"
"perfectly good kinds of experiences"
"and that if we think about"
how
"these kinds of systems"
"deal with their worlds"
"and solve problems within their worlds"
"that that would give us a more"
"unified understanding of what it meant"
"to be"
"a system that was aware"
"and so you're trying to"
"use e coli as a"
"means of understanding yourself or"
"humans by the way is this a project do"
"you feel like your undertaking is an"
"attempt for you to understand yourself"
"or you're trying to understand humans"
"like i'm wondering is this more"
"philanthropic or it's selfish and then"
"it bleeds into the philanthropic"
"well i i actually also want to"
"understand e coli"
"and b we have"
"we don't have a great understanding of"
"of the lives of other organisms"
"professor levin"
"what puzzle do you find most important"
"what do you think about on a semi daily"
"basis or even perhaps multiple times a"
"day and then we'll go around the table"
"here with chris fields and carl fursten"
"next and then it's essentially me taking"
"a backseat and allowing you all to free"
"flow just for the audience to know i"
"know you all know this template already"
"yeah um so so the thing i think about"
"many times a day has to do with the"
"scaling of cognition so i want to"
"understand to two two major things one"
"is how it is that uh some collection of"
"competent uh parts comes together to"
"form a"
"an emergent self with preferences goals"
memories
"cognitive capacities that belong to it"
"but not to the individual parts so i"
"want to understand how that how that"
"emerges how the goals of uh you know"
"sort of humble um"
"a simple uh simple kinds of systems"
"scale up into much more grandiose goals"
"that we see in during during development"
"during behavior uh you know during uh"
"culture and and so on and and i'm also"
"very interested in uh the sort of the"
"left side of that spectrum where does it"
"begin you know is there really a zero on"
"the spectrum i think that uh all of us"
"we here would agree that there is a"
"spectrum for these things it's not a set"
"of binary categories but what happens at"
"the very left side of the spectrum and"
"so one of the first questions you know"
"when we get to that that um that i'd"
"written down to ask both chris and"
"carlos to sort of comment on"
"what does the what does the venn diagram"
"look like of of the set of things that"
"are alive versus the set of things that"
"are cognitive yeah how do those two"
"categories relate to each other until"
"they overlap is one a subset of the"
"other and what really happens at the"
"very beginning you know like"
"can we can we develop a kind of um"
"which which i think i think both of them"
"have been working on a kind of basically"
"a kind of pan psychism that doesn't"
"doesn't sort of paint on new cognitive"
"mysteries on top of physics that works"
"perfectly well but instead to try and to"
"try to view physics from the bottom up"
"as having already a useful cognitive"
"lens on it and how does that help us to"
"build up cognition so that's that's"
"something that i think about every day"
chris
um
"i i thought"
"every day or almost every day for a long"
time
about
why
we
humans
"see objects embedded in space-time"
"so why do we see things"
"that we treat as independent of each"
other
"and why do we"
"see them operate on them interact with"
them
"think about them"
as
"embedded in this coordinate system that"
"we call space"
and
"uh equally important"
"why do we see them as maintaining"
"their identities as things"
"over this other coordinate that we call"
time
carl
um
"i have to confess i spend recurrently"
"most of my time thinking about me um but"
"in an academic sense you know how do i"
work
so
"it's a curious mixture of"
"introspection and trying to understand"
"why i can introspect uh in from the"
"perspective or through the lens of a"
"physicist so i i spend most of my time"
"dissembling preconceptions the gifts"
"that uh our sentience has given us um"
"and try to"
"reassemble them in relation to"
"physics density dynamics uh you know"
"that that has to be articulated in terms"
"of the kind of maths that a physicist"
"would use which would be effectively"
"differential equations and the calculus"
"of variations"
"and having done that there are so many"
um
"there are sufficient number of moving"
"parts but not that many uh but the"
"combinatorics then lead you to the"
"the kinds of questions that mike was was"
"talking about so you know what different"
"ways could this um"
"physics of sentience"
um
"be manifest what possible ways could it"
"be manifest and how does that address"
"the distinction between um things"
"particles creatures um that would show"
"the kind of sense-making and to my mind"
"an important aspect is planning that"
"this would disambiguate them from other"
"natural kinds or particular kinds that"
"don't have that kind of facility and"
"what underwrites that um"
"so that's what i spend most of my time"
"doing i have to say in conversation both"
with
"mike and chris and other people um"
"there you can easily get distracted um"
"in in a rightful way um"
by
"um thinking about that mechanics in uh"
"exactly what chris was talking to which"
"is a scale-free way but in my rhetoric"
"that scale freeness speaks more to the"
"coupling between different scales that"
"mike was alluding to"
"so how does"
"this um mechanics this physics of"
"sentience which which i understand"
"largely in terms of probability theory"
and
"effectively bayesian um probability"
theory
"so what you have is a bayesian mechanics"
"how does that basic mechanics apply at"
"one scale and another scale and then of"
"course the big questions is how did the"
"two scales couple to each other so that"
"that that for me is something that i i"
"find myself increasingly pressed upon"
"largely through conversations and"
"collaborations um"
"that does mean that i spend a lot of my"
"time thinking about that and you're"
"writing demos or mathematical equations"
"trying to try to get to the um"
"the uh the underpinnings of it"
"mike i see you nodding so what is it"
"about what carl said i'm sorry okay"
"professor 11 i apologize and what is it"
that
"what is it that professor fristen said"
"that has you"
"feeling like you agree with it"
"well as as usual i mean he said it"
"perfectly i couldn't i couldn't say it"
"better myself i think that's uh that's"
"that's exactly the kind of um"
"uh research agenda that i'm interested"
"in i mean that's that really is the kind"
"of a very good um description of what i"
"think we're all looking for in a certain"
sense
"is there a difference between cognition"
and
consciousness
"is one distinct is there overlap"
"is someone a subset"
"i i actually can't conceive of"
"cognition without"
consciousness
"which i"
"i prefer to call awareness"
"not just to be perverse but because in"
"many cases"
"consciousness is"
"used in a way that implicitly means"
self-consciousness
"whereas awareness is often used in a way"
"that does not make that implication"
and
"it's i i find it difficult to conceive"
"of cognition without any kind of"
"awareness at all"
"so so so could i just so i'll ask a"
"question then based on what what chris"
"just said and then what when you know"
"and what carl has to say about it so so"
"what do you think about the so-called"
"hard problem is there in fact a hard"
"problem at all"
"i would um"
"i would take andy clark's view on this"
uh
"who has worked closely with david"
chalmers
"i i i don't think so no i i i don't"
"think that the hard problem in and of"
"itself is um"
"is the um"
"interesting um focus of inquiry"
"i think the um the move that i see in"
"philosophy um has been to the meta"
"problem or the meta hard problem which"
is
"um as andy clark puts it quite"
"succinctly is why do we spend so much"
"time puzzling about why we are aware"
so
"just asking that question"
um
"speaks to i think the nature of the"
"heart problem which is a sort of very"
"much a second order a meta um a metric"
"capability that we can"
"make sense of our own sense-making and"
"we um associate that with selfhood so"
"one has to ask the question what kinds"
"of systems"
"again i think particles or creatures"
"would have the capacity"
"to represent selfhood and furthermore"
represent
"the counterfactuals"
"that would enable you to ask the"
"question why am i conscious that"
"immediately just logically presupposes"
"that there is an alternative hypothesis"
"some other counterfactual that i'm not"
conscious
"so imagine now you're talking to"
"a creature you're talking to me that has"
"this capacity to imagine"
"counterfactuals that cannot exist"
"so that's a remarkable capacity to have"
"you know um from my point of view a sort"
"of internal world moral regenerative"
model
"where counterfactuals can exist is quite"
"remarkable i i don't imagine that a"
"thermostat or a virus or"
"an e coli"
"will have a sufficiently sophisticated"
"set of you know"
"electrochemical uh dynamics or kinetics"
"that would enable them to physically"
represent
"counterfactuals of this sort and i could"
"go on um"
"the the usual line of argument is why do"
"we have models why do we have the"
"capacity to represent counterfactuals um"
"the you end up with saying yes you have"
"to have them"
"just if you"
[Music]
contemplate
"things at plan so things plan"
"they have to have"
"um an ability to simulate the future"
"that because they have to simulate or"
"represent at some elemental level the"
"consequences of their action upon the"
world
"and if they have now the capacity to"
represent
"something that has not yet happened"
"namely in the future then they now have"
"the capacity to represent counter"
"factual outcomes so i think"
"the meta hard problem"
"inherits simply because we have a"
sufficiently
"temporally deep"
"generative model"
"that can represent the consequences of"
"our actions and of course using the word"
our
implies
"some kind of elemental agency and some"
"kind of self-worth because it's only me"
"that's doing the acting and the"
"consequences of my action not your"
"action uh so so"
"in in that sense i think that the hard"
"problem um"
"sort of pales into into insignificance"
"in relation to the the meta problem of"
"why it is that we have philosophers"
"can i pursue that just a little bit"
"i think you raise an extraordinarily"
"interesting point here carl"
"and so"
"i want to ask you"
"from a phylogenetic perspective"
"do you think that"
organisms
"that can plan"
necessarily
"are able to represent multiple"
counterfactuals
"so let's give an example"
"of suppose you're a cheetah chasing a"
gazelle
"you're planning your moves"
"while looking at the gazelle's moves"
"and your objective is success"
"do you think that the cheetah worries"
"about the other counterfactual condition"
"where the gazelle isn't caught"
"or does it just represent this one"
"counterfactual condition that is in a"
"sense the goal state"
"i think that's an excellent question i"
"personally think that"
"and when i answer these questions i"
"think how would i simulate this how"
"would i put a cheater in silico"
and
integrate
"according to the differential equations"
"that must be present under certain"
"assumptions um and my guess is that the"
"cheetah chasing the gazelle would as you"
"say just be pursuing a path of least"
"action and it would not have an explicit"
"representation of alternative paths so"
"it would be responding in the moment in"
"a reflexive habitual way so that's a"
"really important question because if we"
"don't have or all of our behavior"
"is just a manifestation of pursuing"
"those paths of least resistance or"
"mathematically those you know paths of"
"space reaction"
"um then there is no counterfactual to"
"select from and there is no notion of"
"planning in the sense of i am going to"
"do this as opposed to that but that"
"doesn't mean to say biological organisms"
"um don't have the capacity to"
"plan multiple futures and i'll just give"
"you one real simple example of um"
"your our brains and i would imagine even"
"the brains of reptiles to a certain"
"extent um"
"being able to plan multiple um"
"actions in the future and that's in eye"
movements
"so if i just take one of the simplest"
"problems in terms of planning or perhaps"
"not the simplest but one of the um"
"the the the problems of planning that"
"have to be resolved within um"
"you know several hundred milliseconds"
"given that we have to choose where to"
"look every 250 milliseconds in order to"
"gather the right kind of information to"
"make you know to construct the scene in"
"which we are situated and coming back to"
"your preoccupation chris your you know"
"how on earth do we then explain these"
sparse
um
"uh psychotic samples"
"within some frame of reference and"
"space-time sort of phrase how do we you"
know
"sense make with reference to some"
"constructs such as space and time but"
"the point i'm making here"
"is the anatomy of um"
"many uh"
"brains many phenotypes does have the"
"capacity to represent the consequences"
"of looking everywhere at the same time"
"at once before they have looked so these"
"are sort of"
"sometimes referred to as salience maps"
"and we know that"
"there are good candidates for these"
"salience maps for example the deep"
"layers of the superior colliculus and"
"what could have argue um possibly some"
"anatomy of the pulvina so if you look at"
"the um if you like the neuronal encoding"
"of the salience of where the salience of"
"the next place to look"
"what's going to grab my attention"
"and make that be manifest overtly with"
"an eye movement to go look over there"
"then there you can interpret i think the"
"anatomy the oculomotor system and"
"especially the um"
"that which underlies uh circadian"
"control synthetic eye movements as"
entertaining
"a whole range possibly millions of"
"potential um"
"plans of action and the consequences"
"and then the brain literally selects the"
"one that's most likely"
"which you can simulate by doing bump"
"attractors on these sort of salience"
"maps or representations of the the"
"salience of the epistemic affordance or"
"the expected information again if i"
"looked over here and over here and over"
"here looked over here you select that"
"your eyes jump over there and off you go"
"again so i think it's a great question"
"and in a sense speaks i think to a"
"certain extent to what mike was alluding"
"to before that there are certain"
"setups or a certain sort of neuronal"
"electrochemical um"
infrastructures
"out there"
"that can be read as just pursuing"
"passively such action in a reflexive way"
"and there are others that may have this"
"um richer structure this deeper"
"structure that could be uh support the"
"you know the the the active sentence and"
"the sort of what i i'm reading now is"
"cognition if cognition entails planning"
"uh then i certainly think there has to"
"be an act of selection in play here um"
"selection what does that mean from"
"something from what well multiple"
"alternatives and then we come back to"
"the central notion of this this counter"
factual
"mike is that what you had in mind in"
"terms of breaking this sort of uh pan"
"psychism uh sort of trap you know the"
"different kinds of"
self-organization
"yeah i mean that's certainly certainly"
"related you know uh the thing the the"
"thing that i and and so i agree with"
chris's
"kind of gut feeling on this i find it"
"very difficult to imagine cognition"
"without some sort of awareness or or"
"simple consciousness however what what"
"strikes me as"
"different than real about the hard"
"problem is that unlike all the quote"
"unquote easy problems and maybe unlike"
"the meta hard problem"
"we kind of know the format or the shape"
"of answers to those questions right"
"they're either they're numbers or their"
"equations or their lists of capacities"
"you know we we know what what a proper"
"answer would look like and yet i find it"
"very hard to imagine if we if somebody"
"claimed to have a"
"a good theory of consciousness and i"
"were to ask them okay well what is the"
"prediction of your theory in this"
"particular case i don't know what the"
"format of the answer looks like because"
"numbers and the typical things we get"
"don't do the trick they you know they're"
"sort of third person descriptions and so"
"so is the answer does the answer come in"
"the form of a poem is it art is it you"
"know something you have to literally"
"plug yourself into to then have that"
"experience like what's the i i find it"
"different because i don't know what if"
"we had a true a correct theory i don't"
"know what that theory would output you"
"know unlike for all these other theories"
"where at least we have some idea of what"
"the output looks like"
"well that's a better answer to the hard"
"problem then that's very good"
before
"i'm sure the answer is quantum physics"
"and that's that's what it's going to"
"look like if we could if we could"
"understand it the answer would be in"
"quantum physics"
"chris do you agree"
"well i i'd like to to back up a little"
bit
uh
"and in a sense"
"play off what carl was just saying about"
"alternatives and the role of"
"alternatives in the heart problem"
"i mean chalmers drives his arguments"
"about the hard problem with"
"the alternative of unconsciousness"
and
"this alternative"
makes
"great sense"
"against the background of a particular"
"set of assumptions about"
physics
uh
"which is"
"the assumption that"
"nothing is going on cognitively in the"
"physical world that there's that there's"
"no reason to"
"talk about"
"uh experience or awareness or anything"
"like that"
"when we're talking about"
"rocks or billiard balls or planets or"
"electrons or"
"anything else"
and
"in that case"
"there is this"
cut
"that is"
"not really a cut in scale"
of
"spatial scale or temporal scale"
"but is in a sense a cut in some measure"
"of complexity"
"that suggests that"
"below some"
"cut point which may be a bright line and"
"maybe a fuzzy area who knows"
"there's the possibility"
"or below some cut point there's there's"
"no awareness at all none"
zero
"and above that cut point there's some"
"possibility of awareness"
"and in that case one's forced to say how"
"what what could be added"
"by complexity other than complexity"
"to produce awareness"
"and it's that intuition i believe that"
"drives the hard problem"
"do you mind explaining that a bit more"
"what can be added by complexity that's"
"not complexity or the sentence"
well
"um yeah"
"and one way to put it is"
complexity
"as complexity increases some magic has"
"to happen"
and
"you suddenly get awareness"
and
"it's not clear quite how much complexity"
"one has to add"
"but as soon as one reaches the the right"
"amount then"
uh
"out of the blue you've got awareness"
"whereas without crossing that threshold"
"you you had no awareness whatsoever"
"so there's a zero point and the zero"
"points somewhere on the scale of"
complexity
"and it's nowhere near the bottom"
"so i think one can i can i think one can"
"view a lot of research on"
consciousness
"as a way to escape that"
argument
so
i'll
"consider integrated information theory"
oh
"in integrated information theory the"
"criterion for"
"consciousness or awareness"
"is actually very simple you you need to"
"have an internal feedback loop"
"and if you've got an internal feedback"
"loop you're at least a candidate for"
"being aware"
"as long as you're not embedded in"
"something bigger that has bigger"
"internal feedback loops"
and
"if one"
"thinks about"
"the work of peter strawson for example"
"from a philosophical perspective"
"his arguments toward"
pansysm
"are all arguments of the form"
"there's no way to draw the lie"
"in the"
"scale of complexity"
"and get a place where"
"magic basically plausibly happens"
so
"i think i think chalmers did a real"
"service in in"
"posing the problem in that way because"
"it forced us to think about this idea of"
"magic or you could call it emergence if"
"you wanted to"
"of something completely new that was"
awareness
"now i i do agree with carl that"
"quantum theory can help us"
"dispel the problem"
"uh by by being in effect a theory that's"
"about awareness"
"but we can we can get to that farther"
"down the road"
"do you have any reason to believe that"
"we're embedded in something larger you"
"mentioned in"
"iit there's the feedback loop that is"
"necessary for consciousness and you said"
that
"one is conscious as long as one is not"
"embedded in something else that's"
"of which that is conscious like there's"
"a larger feedback loop there"
"do you see there being some larger"
"feedback loop some people say the"
"universe itself is conscious or that"
"societies can act as some larger level"
consciousness
"like with each of us acting as neurons"
"in some sense"
"well i would certainly wouldn't want to"
"rule that view out a priori"
"i mean it's it's obvious that we're"
"embedded in much bigger systems"
and
"i think we understand"
"essentially nothing about the cognitive"
"capacities of those systems"
yeah
michael
"yeah yeah i think i think that's a"
"really important question and i i think"
"a lot about the perspective of let's say"
"you know if you were a neural network or"
"something like this being trained and so"
"on what would the perspective of a sub"
"component of that be what you know let's"
"say if you had the capacity as a neuron"
"to sort of look around and ask yourself"
"you know do i do i live in a cold"
"mechanical universe that doesn't care"
"what happens or uh is there some some"
"sort of uh agency in my environment that"
"you know am i when i'm as a piece of"
"that network am i am i learning from my"
"environment or am i being trained right"
"because when you're being trained right"
"the real question is like how many how"
"many um agents are there in that"
"interaction is it just you learning as"
"you will you're the boss and you're sort"
"of learning whatever from your"
"environment or are you actually being"
"trained because the environment is an"
"agent with an agenda that is training"
"you for some particular purpose right"
"and so so this question of uh how would"
"you know so so you look around and you"
"see you say to yourself well"
"if you're a piece of this of this"
"network and it's being trained for some"
"image image recognition task you know"
"you you would be i think wrong to come"
"to the conclusion that you live in a in"
"a mechanical universe you would you"
"should come to the conclusion that it's"
"actually it's clearly rewarding you and"
"punishing you for for specific things"
"it's not neutral with respect to what"
"you do and for some reason it really"
"likes it when you find you know you find"
"um pictures of dog eyes or something"
"like this and you have no idea that what"
"what it does is recognize dog faces out"
"of you know all the other all the other"
"inputs so"
"no doubt there's some kind of gerdelian"
"limit to to be able to actually"
"understand what the larger system is"
"doing but i wonder if we can even have"
"some evidence that uh just just for the"
"fact that yes there is a greater you"
"know sort of a agential dynamic going on"
"in which i'm caught up even if you're"
"not able to you know sort of comprehend"
"what that's going to what that's going"
"to be i i don't know i don't know what"
"that's going to look like but i think"
"it's pretty important and i think as"
"chris said we really don't have a very"
"good science at all of"
"trying to predict or control"
"the cognitive capacities of systems made"
"up of parts so so we can know many"
"things about parts cells robotics or"
"whatever and we routinely make these"
"larger systems have then and then get"
"surprised about what it does or doesn't"
"do or what what what the goals are going"
"to be what goals is it capable of"
"pursuing what preferences does it have"
"this is probably an existential level um"
"job for for society is to get a good"
"science of that of that going"
"you have done that there haven't you"
"well we've started anyway"
"i mean you couldn't i i would go film"
that
"i think i think your work would"
represent
"a substantive and established um"
"formal framework to address exactly"
"those issues um"
"and you can see your embryonic versions"
"arising in many different fields i just"
"came back from a meeting"
"of economists and financiers and they"
"are trying to make the move from"
"behavioral economics to cognitive"
"economics and they were exactly"
"addressing these kinds of issues you're"
understanding
the
um
"the notion of distributed cognition in a"
"market um so you know and ultimately"
"that they cannot they'll come knocking"
"at your door i can see that i can see"
"exactly the"
"sequence of people um you know searching"
"around for people to talk about um"
illuminating
"that realization that the i mean it"
"comes back to what we were talking about"
"before where you've started and you know"
"i was picking up on the um"
"on the the link between different scales"
"of self-organization where every scale"
"has you know complies with the same"
"principles but how does that"
"contextualize and i think one really"
interesting
"example of that um"
"is to think about an individual in an"
"ensemble or a society and just to"
"wrestle the argument back to pick up on"
"something that chris was saying about"
"you know"
"you know if if there is a bright line"
between
"the kind of"
"mechanics that would qualify"
as
"conscious in the sense of being"
"self-aware and i'm distinguishing that"
"from the kind of consciousness that"
"would just entail qualitative experience"
"you know a loss of phenomenal uh"
"transparency so i'm talking about now"
"self-awareness is you know one of one of"
"the bright lines that may be very blurry"
"blurry and vague but certainly one which"
"is induced by uh the hard problem"
"you know just asking a simple question"
"your what kind of explanation for my"
"world whether i'm a single neuron or a"
"single person"
"and would"
"enable me or justify"
"the notion that i am myself"
"and the obvious answer is"
"when i have to disambiguate between the"
"consequences of my action and your"
"action if you are very similar to me"
"so if i"
"you know managed to survive in on an"
"alien planet"
"where there are no structures like like"
"me that could cause the same sense to"
consequences
"then there would be no problem inferring"
"did i cause that or did you cause that"
"so just having um the existence of a"
"population of con specifics in some sort"
"of formal structural sense"
"suddenly induces the inference problem"
"did you cause that do i cause that and"
"of course that naturally calls for"
"generative models or internal dynamics"
"representations on the inside"
um
"that entertain the hypothesis on the"
"notion that that's me"
"as opposed to not me so you get for free"
"in and only in this context where you've"
"put lots of these particles together"
"like you know the"
"if you like the license or the"
"motivation to have a hypothesis um you"
"know a representation of selfhood um"
"that you know from the statisticians"
"point of view"
"is exactly"
"the justification for the increased"
"complexity that chris was talking about"
"so i was listening to that really"
"interesting sort of uh um sort of"
"nod to iit and all it brings to the"
"table in terms of this sort of you know"
"commitment to some threshold crossing or"
"trans traversing a cut"
"with increasing complexity but why i"
"mean one simple answer is that um"
"you know if you ask a statistician what"
"is complexity and they'll tell you well"
"um it's basically the degrees of freedom"
"you're using up to explain some sensory"
data
"um you could articulate it as a kl or"
"relative entry between a posterior prior"
"if you're a bayesian but in essence it's"
"just the degrees of freedom"
"you're um using in order to accurately"
"explain these data"
"so mathematically the evidence is equal"
"to the accuracy minus the complexity so"
"why would you need what why why is that"
"useful well an increase in complexity"
license
"is only licensed by an increase in the"
"accuracy so the simple argument would go"
"and if i am"
"obliged to model and predict and explain"
"a world"
"and that is constituted by other things"
"like me"
"then the accuracy of my predictions will"
"be greatly enhanced if i have a"
"representation of me as distinct from"
you
"and if that entails an increase in the"
"degrees of freedom namely adding in this"
"extra kind of a hypothesis and"
"everything that it entails"
then
"i'm going to have a greater complexity"
"but it's a complexity that is more than"
"paid for by the uh by the increase"
"increase in the accuracy"
"and i you know"
"just coming back to you know my original"
"point um"
"yeah i think a lot of the work um that"
"you've done at the cellular level"
um
"would be very gracefully translated to"
"the societal level and to things like"
"economics and to"
"echo niche construction and in ethology"
"and i know chris is probably wanting to"
"say this"
"but language has one way of facilitating"
"that notion that ability to"
"um to efficiently with minimum"
"complexity in this instance um"
"do this distributed cognition so i'm"
"both trained being trained and learning"
"at the same time and we're doing it"
"together to invent some kind of"
"generalized synchrony"
"so i mentioned language for chris there"
"the font hope he wants to pick that one"
up
oh
"well well again what i'd actually like"
"to do is back up a little bit"
"and uh put some of what you just said"
into
"very simple active inference language"
"if if i see something happening"
"on my markov blanket on my interface"
"with the world"
"then i always have the question"
"did i do that or did the world do that"
"where the world means everything outside"
me
and
"in a sense"
"the answer is always the world did it so"
"the question becomes"
"did the world do that in response to"
"something i did to it"
"or did it just do it"
"not not in consequence of any of my"
actions
"and so one gets immediately to this kind"
"of babbling scenario that we've talked"
"about many times"
"in which"
"an infant or a robot or some system"
"is trying to figure out"
by
"measuring correlations"
whether
"the world's inputs to it have anything"
"to do with its inputs to the world"
and
just
"asking that question"
"requires enormous"
"representative capacity"
"because one has to represent one's"
actions
"and represent them pretty well in time"
"and one has to"
"have a good memory"
"to represent enough actions to get any"
"kind of statistical support for drawing"
"an inference about correlation"
and
"that memory has to"
"be represented as a memory"
"uh not just part of one's own current"
input
"so i think this"
"question that you"
posed
"is really the key question faced by any"
"agent at all"
"that's trying to get a model off the"
ground
which
"which in a sense gets back to the"
"question that mike asked early early on"
"about how does this all start"
uh
"maybe it starts with babbling"
"in very simple systems"
"you know i i was thinking recently uh"
"this this this whole issue of how many"
"agents are there and where is the border"
"between the agent and the world and how"
"do you self-model that border is is a"
"fascinating topic and there's a there's"
"an amazing um"
"developmental model for this which is"
"which is that you know we often talk"
"about one embryo and the embryo does"
"this in the embryo does that but"
"actually what happens at the beginning"
"let's say for example an amniote embryos"
"is that there's a there's a flat blasted"
"disc which has just a few cell layers"
"thick so it's kind of think of it like a"
"like a frisbee and it just has a few"
"cell layers"
"and normally what has to happen is that"
"one point in this in this disc breaks"
"symmetry and then organizes the primary"
"axis of the first embryo and basically"
"tells all the other cells"
"don't do it because because i'm doing it"
"and that's how you end up with one"
"embryo now that process is very easily"
"perturbed and and i many people have"
"done it i used to do it in my in my"
"graduate work and what you can do is if"
"you perturb that process that initial"
"blasto disc that undifferentiated sort"
"of pool of of cells which are these sort"
"of proto"
"uh low-level proto-proto-agents that"
"pool can break up into not one embryo"
"but actually multiple and so you can"
"have so i did this in in bird embryos"
"and you could have twins and chicken and"
"duck and things like this you can have"
"in humans humans have exactly the same"
structure
"you can get them head to head you can"
"have to get them side by side you can"
"get all sorts of geometries you can get"
"triplets you can get multiple"
"individuals awry emerging by different"
"partitions of this of this"
"really kind of"
"medium this particular medium where"
"where you have a bunch of cells and you"
"don't know ahead of time how many"
"individuals at the level of how many"
"larger individuals so embryos are going"
"to arise from this medium because the"
"the dynamics by which in that's you know"
"local activation and long-range"
"inhibition and things like that the the"
"dynamics that break up that that"
"undifferentiated ocean of of potential"
"selves into one two or three or more"
"selves is actually um it's very dynamic"
"it can it can go different ways"
"and then you get interesting interesting"
"things like this so for example you"
"might know that human conjoined twins"
"that are you know sort of stuck together"
"side to side one of the twins often has"
"left right asymmetry defects and it's"
"because when you have two twins side by"
"side the cells in the middle both twins"
"can't quite agree on who they belong to"
"are they the right side of this twin or"
"are they the left side of that twin and"
"both twins think they belong to them but"
"in fact they're overlapping they're the"
"same cells and so one side will have"
"correct left and right the other guy the"
"other side will have like two rights for"
"example right and this ends up this ends"
"up giving one of the twins laterality"
"defects with respect to heart and gut"
"patterning and so so their models each"
"twins as as the collective of cells"
"tries to compute uh things like which"
which
"where things are and what's left and"
"what's right and so on their models can"
"disagree with each other they can they"
"can draw the boundary between self and"
"world in different ways and you can have"
"these sort of disputes over certain"
"areas as to where who they actually"
"belong to"
"and and so so i'm just i'm just"
"incredibly interested in this in this"
"process of of emerging of"
"individualization so to speak out of"
"this like ocean of of potentiality these"
"cells you know 50 000 cells and some"
"number of individuals at the um at the"
"embryo level will be formed and each of"
"them will have specific goals in"
"morphospace each of them will try to"
"achieve very specific morphologies uh"
"and uh and they've and then you don't"
"know ahead of time how many there were"
"going to be you know"
"carl what occurs to you when you hear"
that
um
"ambiguity um again sort of um"
"just thinking about the imperatives for"
self-organization
so
"when i hear that was a fascinating story"
"um and don't let me forget we ought to"
"explain to the viewers what babbling"
"means just in this context as well"
"because that's quite illuminating"
"perhaps we can i'm not sure that the"
"cells do do motor babbling um but they"
"certainly resolve um the same kind of"
"problem um so my um chris correct me if"
"i'm wrong but by babbling all we mean is"
"that when you're"
"first born into any universe you've got"
to
um
"work out"
"or test the hypothesis that i cause that"
"or the world caused that and so you"
"don't know you don't have a self model"
"you don't you know"
"whether this is sort of"
"a declarative model completely so"
"personal just"
"hardwired into the um the synaptic"
"efficacy and connectivity of your brain"
"so the first thing you have to do is"
"just to work out what you can control"
"and what you can't control"
"and the idea is that you you"
"engage in"
"what i would call epistemic or respond"
"to epistemic affordances or epistemic"
"plans that reveal knowledge they resolve"
"uncertainty and in this instance it's"
"the uncertainty about whether"
"i was the cause of this rattle rattling"
"so if you imagine um motor babbling"
"as manifest in a little baby"
"rattling its rattle"
"generating both the sensations"
"from the muscles and the skin but also"
"the visual"
"and the auditory sensations all co-occur"
"providing definitive evidence that"
"there's something special about"
"this process and this event"
"that um"
"that provides the basis for the"
"hypothesis there's a unitary cause"
"there's a unitary cause which is me"
"shaking the rattle but of course it may"
"take several months if not years to"
"actually get there to actually realize"
"that causes me so what can you imagine"
"sort of you know robots learning about"
"the uh the manipulator that they can"
"articulate all the the way in which they"
"can move around and you know um"
"for ambulate um but i think the idea"
"bring it back to sort of where the self"
"had come from um"
"it would um"
"rest upon"
"the testing the hypothesis which has to"
"be physically represented with a deep"
"more complex genetic model and sense"
making
"that in fact it's me that's actually"
"caused this single cause of all these"
proprioceptive
"motor sensations visual sensations"
"auditory sensations um and that would be"
"especially prescient when you're"
"starting to realize that some of these"
"causes which you thought were you"
"of the sort associated with nurturing"
"and suckling um were actually due to mum"
"and we come back to this argument to to"
"actually have a good hypothesis which"
"explains why i am not in charge of mum"
"because she is now not always responding"
"to me when i cry"
"yeah to have to explain that i have to"
"now develop a hypothesis yes it was me"
"causing all of this"
"um but sometimes there's something else"
"else out there that's not me but very"
"much like me and that's mum and then you"
"can see how there would be a pressure"
"in terms of you know finding the best"
"explanations for your sensations to to"
"have that so if you take that notion now"
"think of the same problem uh from the"
"point of view of a cell"
"um you know what are the impaired or a"
"bunch of cells that have to work"
"together or will ultimately form a uh an"
embryo
"via this process of symmetry breaking"
"you you know you have to ask what are"
"the underlying imperatives how how could"
"it be any other way um and of course it"
"could be more like i said it could be"
"lots of ways but"
"the ways the ways in which it goes wrong"
"um which would be another way of saying"
"um those rare occasions or the the ways"
"that it doesn't happen in"
"consequence of their rarity um involve"
"this ambiguity again"
"literally in this in the context of some"
"cells not knowing whether they're"
"belonging to one twin or or another twin"
"from the from the cell's perspective"
um
"so um i was just thinking about the"
"nature of ambiguity and of course you"
"know it is exactly the same"
um
"one can account"
for
the
"simple observation that"
self-organization
"does not tolerate ambiguity does not"
"tolerate uncertainty it's only um"
"manifest in the context of"
"accurate and"
"well-evidenced definitive uh exchanges"
"so come back to chris's notion of your"
"sense making"
"projecting onto my markov blanket or my"
"holographic screen from the point of"
"view of the quantum formulation"
"that i need to resolve all the"
"uncertainty uh"
"as much uncertainty as i can but put"
"that another way"
"um as in a more slightly more"
"deflationary way"
"stuff which we see the way the universe"
"seems to work"
"is um"
"can be described as"
"um realizing processes that minimize"
"this this kind of uncertainty and"
"ambiguity and simply maximize the mutual"
"predictability of what's being projected"
"or impressed upon my surface on my"
"holographic screen or my markov blanket"
"uh so i you know that's what i was that"
"was going through my mind i thought it"
"was a beautiful example of of you know"
"when it goes wrong the the the the the"
the
"uncertainty in ambiguity you're in the"
"game and uh and that tells you something"
"quite fundamental about when it goes"
"right and when it goes right it's just"
"basically um a statement of what exists"
"and what you know what what perseveres"
"over time chris did you have anything to"
"say to add to that"
"well i would be interested to uh"
"to see how actually"
how
"mike responds to"
that
uh
"discourse with respect to the example of"
"this embryonic sheet where"
"the cells are each trying to figure out"
"what they're supposed to do"
uh
and
"there's they're still"
uh
"they still certainly believe that they"
"should be reproducing so they they"
"definitely do that and they signal to"
"each other"
"but somehow their"
"the collective effect of all of that"
"signaling to each other"
"is to organize different roles for them"
"for each for themselves"
"so how does the symmetry breaking occur"
"yeah so so that's that's really"
"interesting so as i was hearing um carl"
"talk about this i realized a couple of"
"things that um first of all uh as we"
"were saying before feedback loops are"
"absolutely central to this process"
"because the easiest way to prevent any"
"of this from happening and to end up"
"with a uh uh um kind of a mono um you"
"know sort of uh i you know a very a"
"featureless sheet where there are no"
"embryos is to block that is to block the"
"positive feedback loop that yeah so so"
"that long that that short range"
"inhibition long range activation that"
"says to one cell i'm going to now be the"
"organizer i'm going to make this axis"
"everybody else don't do it you those are"
"both feedback loops and so if you break"
"those feedback loops you get nothing so"
"so the feedback loops are right at the"
"beginning of this process and and the"
"other thing that that i thought was"
"really interesting that carl just said"
"is about the cells babbling so what i"
think
"it's a really good name for what we see"
"when you take a cell and you put it out"
"into a dish"
"what you'll see you'll and in fact in"
"any in any new environment you will see"
"two things that i think are probably"
"babbling in different spaces one is that"
"in physical space you will see that it's"
"incredibly active it's constantly"
"putting out and pulling back these these"
um
"kind of extensions so these cytoplasmic"
"extensions that have all kinds of"
"sensors on them they're not just sitting"
"the cell is never just sitting there"
"waiting for something to happen it's"
"constantly probing its environment it's"
"incredibly active i'm sure it's taking"
"all kinds of energy costs to do all this"
"um there are videos of it that are just"
"remarkable on online and you know we see"
"them every day the other the other"
"babbling takes place in transcriptional"
"space so gene expression is also never"
"just sort of still and this is you know"
"these are the genes that are expressed"
"and i'm just gonna sit here and do that"
"all the genes are constantly going up"
"and down within specific ranges as it"
"sort of wiggles in this transcriptional"
"space and i think both and probably"
"physiologically metabolically i bet this"
"is going on in all these other spaces"
"and i think babbling is an excellent uh"
"framework for for understanding what"
"it's actually doing it's actually taking"
"these little actions looking for"
"evidence of specific things that it can"
"then make use of to start to draw you"
"know to draw boundaries and and as chris"
"as chris was saying i think what happens"
"is that"
"in this blastoderm you get uh"
"what what what will happen is that once"
"once that that individuation starts"
"where there's a specific cell that"
"starts to go down this road of uh being"
"the organizer of this new"
"larger collective it immediately begins"
"to distort the action space for all the"
"nearby cells it starts putting out all"
"kinds of signals you know reward signals"
"and and physical forces and all these"
"other things that now"
"are going to bend the uh the option for"
"all the other cells and the best example"
"of that we have are these xenobots where"
"these things are just made of embryonic"
"skin cells and if you look at a standard"
"old embryo you get this idea that well"
"what do skin cells want to do they want"
"to be a passive two-dimensional layer on"
"the outside of the animal they do"
"nothing except sit there keep out the"
"bacteria you know nice and a boring"
"two-dimensional life but what you find"
"out is that that's only true because the"
"other cells are basically bullying them"
"into it left to their own devices with"
"the in the absence of these instructive"
"interactions with the rest of the embryo"
"what they what the skin cells actually"
"want to do is get together into a"
"three-dimensional uh kind of ball like"
"architecture they are self-motile that"
"you know they'll run around and move and"
"do very have various behaviors including"
"make copies of themselves if provided"
"with materials and so that is completely"
um
"kind of obscured by standard development"
"where what you're seeing actually is is"
"cells in a space that was really"
"deformed by by all their neighbors right"
"and that's you know that kind of process"
"that that that starts to devel you know"
"make them make those distinctions where"
"the embryo"
"the embryo can tell what part uh what"
"parts are inside and what parts are"
"supposedly outside of itself and that"
"that gets reinforced by all these early"
activities
"carl or chris do you want to jump in on"
"that i think i think we've been"
"describing cyclists that says basically"
"that it's curiosity all the way down"
"every system is trying to figure out"
"what's going on i was struck with that"
"with this image of the little cells"
"putting out fingers you know this is"
"expiration your sort of true blue"
"exploration and mathematically it's"
"simply as it says it's um"
what
what
"artificial intelligence um research"
"aspires to which is artificial curiosity"
"you know"
"going out there getting the right kind"
"of data"
"that's going to maximally resolve your"
"uncertainty and paint the way the way"
"forward and of course it's"
"intimately related to planning"
"in the sense you have to um"
"realize that palpation you know whether"
"it's a little cell palpating whether"
"it's failure or podia or um whether it's"
"me palpating my visual world i move my"
"eyes around or whether it's the"
"little baby babbling and palpating it's"
"cot this this this this palpation"
"has to be planned"
"it could be planned in the sense of the"
"gazelle sorry because it's not the"
"gazelle the cheetah chasing the gazelle"
"so it doesn't have to be very"
"sophisticated cognitive conscious"
"planning but certainly has to has to be"
"planned it has to have this sort of"
"curious behavior um i mean it you know"
"it strikes me that that is such a"
"fundamental um aspect"
"that i think would qualify"
behaviors
"that have that aspect as cognitive in"
"some sense and it's so fundamental"
"because of course it's it's just an"
expression
of
"dynamics that apply"
to
"um action upon the world"
um
that
underwrite
"everything that we do as certainly as"
"scientists and one could imagine as as"
"human beings but certainly as scientists"
"you know that the maths of curiosity was"
"was actually worked out um by dennis"
"lindley in the 1950s"
"um in terms of expected information gain"
"and then reintroduced by people like"
"david mckay in the context of active"
"learning so bringing this active notion"
"that you can learn by actively acquiring"
"the right kind of data that optimizes"
"that kind of learning"
"and it became known as"
"the principles of optimum bayesian"
"experimental design"
"so it's exactly the same kind of"
"curiosity that we as scientists use all"
"the time whenever we design an"
experiment
"it's basically configuring actively"
"configuring some process to generate"
"something that can be sensed or measured"
that
"that maximally resolves our uncertainty"
"or affords the greatest amount of"
"information so"
"you know"
"the three of us as scientists uh have"
become
um
"experts at this kind of formal curiosity"
"simply you know"
"just by acquiring uh knowledge about"
"in the in the particular paradigms or"
"setups and the fields that we find"
"ourselves in the right way to do"
"experiments but you could argue that"
"that's life"
"you know in a sense that is the the"
"infant bubbling uh"
"it is you know"
"that kind of sense making getting"
"actively getting the right kind of data"
"to work out your place in the world"
"uh to work out what you know what you"
"should do next"
"is one of the most existentially"
"important imperatives um and you know i"
"was struck out you know but the"
"mechanics that mike was talking about in"
"terms of the you know"
"the little skin cells left their own"
"devices have it having a party and"
"forming balls and wandering around i"
"mean you know one could apply that kind"
"of mechanics"
"to people couldn't you or even even"
"cultures and countries we're all trying"
"to find our place and we're all trying"
"to work out how to respond to those"
constraints
"people around us at many different"
scales
"put on our behavior and try and infer"
"well how am i meant to behave in this"
situation
"so even if we all start off with the"
"same genetic code and the same sort of"
"model of you know"
"how people behave"
"the context in which we find ourselves"
"now needs to be inferred in order to"
"have to know how to behave in this"
"context either with a child or as a"
"mother as a politician or as an aid"
"worker or a first responder whatever you"
"want you have to make that inference and"
"of course that inference"
"inferring that context requires"
"the curious behavior that"
that
"chris had picked up on"
"in mike's example"
"wow could could you know what i'd love"
"to hear is each of you talk about um"
"what is the"
"simplest most basic uh"
"thing so you know hopefully going down"
"to like"
"physics prior to life but but whatever"
"you like what is the most basic thing"
"that is able to do that because that's"
"what i find in in talking about this"
"stuff to other communities the thing"
"that people are the most resistant to is"
"this idea that these kind of dynamics"
"this this kind of uh exploration"
"curiosity prediction all of these things"
"that we're talking about that you know"
"people people think it's it's brains"
"first and then you can do all these"
"these these great things i i would love"
"to hear um you know what you think is"
"the simplest physical system that can do"
"that kind of thing so that we can talk"
"about how far down it actually goes"
"while chris is thinking about that with"
"a profound answer"
"not a trivial answer but a formal um"
"answer uh i i think it's"
"um you'd have to identify the um the"
"depth of planning"
"um that underwrote the"
"the dynamics of the behavior of the"
"system um"
"in question um and that would be"
basically
"if you were putting this in a sort of"
"path integral formulation it would be"
"the sort of the the amount of time over"
"which you are integrating your paths and"
"you're evaluating the best way forward"
um
"once you move"
"once you move from uh very short time"
scales
um
"then the depth of that planning i think"
"eludes um physical realizations that"
"could be written down in terms of um"
"representations in terms of"
"concentrations and"
"um depolarizations and the like um and"
"one has to move to a quantum discrete"
"time representation so you know"
"i guess i'm basically making the"
"difference between the sort of um"
"the the the kind of dynamics you'd find"
"in a uh in chemotaxis or a thermostat um"
"that could be written down as"
"differential equations in fact"
"the kind of differential equations we"
"used in one of those early"
"pattern formation papers and knowing"
"your place uh approaches um where"
"everything could be articulated in terms"
"of differential equations so that there"
"is a kind of planning but it's not of"
"the curious kind that we talked about"
"it's just following the most likely"
"paths of at least action so i would say"
"that they're not cognitive in the sense"
"that they have planning"
"um so i put chemotaxis and thermostats"
"and possibly most viruses probably at a"
precognitive
"or proto-cognitive level but as soon as"
"you get to"
um
"generator models that can roll out deep"
"into the future and i i repeat just when"
"you try to implement this in silico"
"you know using computer simulations you"
"really have to move to a discrete time"
"representation um which i think is a"
"non-trivial thing i mean just for"
"example remember the sort of the eye"
"movement example yeah we sense make"
"by getting little snapshots of the world"
"every 250 milliseconds"
"uh it's not like i've got i am a"
"thermostat and i'm taking a continuous"
"record of the temperature that is a"
"continuous i'm actually getting"
"quantal observations um and i think once"
"you move to that kind of generative"
"model or biophysics that entails um the"
"gradient flows under that genitive model"
"then i think you're in a position to"
"talk about sort of planning and"
"cognition and curiosity of the kind that"
"would we're talking about uh so i you"
"know i'd literally put time constants on"
"this i'd say about you know 300"
"milliseconds if you've got the ability"
"to represent the future"
"300 milliseconds"
"you know"
"sorry represent the consequences of your"
"actions more than 300 milliseconds in"
"the future then i put you in"
"having crossed that one of those cuts"
"um and"
"moved from from being a sort of um yeah"
"a virus to you know to to i don't know"
"perhaps an insect i'm not sure"
"perhaps you had to go"
"are you seriously putting the 300 ml"
"seconds forward or like or is that"
facetious
um
"it's it's facetious but"
"but not as facetious as it might as you"
"might think"
"i do think that they're"
"yeah i think there's a"
"there's one way of celebrating the um"
"the escapes from pan psychism that we"
"started off with when you know when mike"
"was saying what he spends his time"
"talking about one of the ways is to"
"commit to vagueness and you know how"
"many um"
"how many grains of sand do i need before"
"this is all becomes a pile um and try"
"and work out what the uh what the"
"quantity is uh that defines that"
"spectrum that we were talking about"
"before uh along the switch there is"
"vagueness at some point consciousness of"
"a certain kind um"
"arises um but i also think there are"
"natural kinds that actually have bright"
"lines between them"
"and you know"
"what i'm saying here and i i don't think"
"i said it before and i probably wouldn't"
"say it again um"
but
"unless i've simulated it but certainly"
"in my experience"
"qualitatively different kinds of"
"generative models that represent time in"
"very very different ways you can get so"
"mathematically things like kalman"
"filters that can be cast or linear"
"quadratic control robotics"
"and the like that can be cast purely in"
"terms of futures that are represented in"
"terms of velocities and accelerations"
"and higher order motions that are just"
"in the dynamics and the equations of"
motion
"uh and you can realize and build these"
"things you can simulate them and they"
behave
"in a very plausible way you can get them"
"to do handwriting you can get them to"
"self-organize and do all sorts of"
"interesting things"
"our thermostat"
"but that's um"
"that's as far as it goes these things"
"don't show curious behavior to do"
"curious behavior you're really gonna"
"roll out much further into the future"
"and in running out further into the"
"future it's very difficult to represent"
"the future just using differential"
"equations unless you move to very very"
"high orders of motion"
"and at which point you start to sort of"
"you know to minimize that complexity"
"start to articulate things in discrete"
"time and then the maths and so the mass"
"the new"
"the um numerics become much simpler and"
doable
and
"then you've got a qualitatively"
"different kind of genitive model you"
"move from a continuous to a discrete"
"time a quant a quantized generative"
"model um so that for me is not does not"
"allow a vagueness you know there is"
"actually a natural kind that will"
"represent things in the moment in terms"
"of flows and dynamics and other natural"
"kinds that will represent things um in"
"terms of discrete not universal clock"
"time but discrete iterations um and i'm"
"saying that the you know for for"
"certainly our scale of interactions and"
"the way that we sense make i would have"
"thought 300 milliseconds was not a"
"controversial um i say that because"
"that's the cognitive moment it's also"
"the time interval between the way that"
"we sample the world not just with our"
"eyes but when we sniff"
"we sniff"
"at a frequency which means that each new"
"sampling of that well that palpation"
"with our chemo acceptors and olfactory"
"receptors is again every couple you know"
"every 200 milliseconds so suggest to me"
"there's a sort of discrete"
"belief updating um and it is a discrete"
"belief updating that is underwritten by"
"the way we act the plans have to be in"
"these discrete chunks of time so that's"
"where the 300 second milliseconds come"
"from you see it everywhere"
"mice whisking they whisk at that"
"frequency so they touch the palpate"
"every 300 milliseconds the way i'm"
"speaking now every phoneme is reaching"
"your ears every 300 milliseconds or so"
or
"or possibly less so wherever you look in"
"our biological scale"
"that's they does seem to be this"
"uncharacteristic uh"
"timestamp that's purely empirical so you"
know
"the facetious aspect inherits from the"
"fact that that's that's very egocentric"
"it's just for things like me i don't"
"know if it's the things like cells or"
"quantum physics well it's interesting"
"because in physics the number three has"
"an interesting role in fundamental"
"physics because there's three"
"generations of"
"of matter and there's that number three"
"crops up and it's a mystery as to why so"
"it sounds like the number 300 or 300"
"milliseconds a unit attached to it or"
"neuroscience maybe a a fundamental"
"constant so chris"
"what are some of the deep thoughts that"
"you were having"
"well i i was just having a visual"
"impression actually when mike was"
talking
"and um"
"of babbling"
and
"the visual impression was of our our"
"sort of model of the quantum vacuum"
and
"when we think of when we think of the"
vacuum
"or at least i think of it"
"visually as little things popping in and"
"out of existence all the time"
and
so
"one can think of that as a as a kind of"
"babbling right the the field itself is"
"exploring what's going on outside of"
itself
"that's extremely interesting"
by
uh
"forming a little entity to go off and"
"explore and then report back"
"so this is a this is a very different"
"picture from the one that that"
"carl gave"
"in that"
um
"but i suppose it also has a similarity"
"or two"
that
"when we write down"
"uh a model of that activity it is"
discrete
"it is operating in a discrete kind"
"by generating discrete events"
"even though it's it's modeled in a"
"continuous space time which"
uh
"once when digs a little bit deeply the"
"continuous space time itself becomes"
discrete
but
"this raises a question for me"
"which is another of the things that i"
"think about a lot"
um
"which is the question of"
"what we mean by randomness"
and
"certainly to take a bayesian point of"
"view where probabilities are all"
subjective
uh
"it becomes very difficult to say what"
"randomness might mean if if used in a"
"way that's meant to be objective or to"
"refer to something objective"
"and we model things like"
"fluctuations in the vacuum as"
random
"which from a bayesian point of view just"
means
"it's uncertain to us it represents"
"information that we"
"don't have and quite possibly can't get"
"even in principle"
"but if we think of that system"
"as an agent"
"then of course you're expected to be"
"exploring its world whatever it is"
whatever
uh
"exists that's not it"
and
maybe
"we can really think of babbling all the"
"way down as a model of of what's"
"happening in"
"these phenomena that we"
"persist in thinking of as random"
"but we also"
"don't typically think of these sorts of"
"systems as agents"
"this is this is this is incredibly"
"interesting um"
"what i heard what i heard carl"
"saying among other things is that there"
"is a there is a qualitative transition"
"when things go from analog to digital in"
"a certain sense right from from from"
"continuous to to phase and based on what"
"chris just said it would just remind us"
"to to think about the kind of the"
"quantum world where"
"at least to my understanding a lot of"
"things are in fact uh you know sort of"
"discrete does that mean that really"
"could it be that that that is the sort"
"of base state as chris just outlined"
"with with with that kind of uh"
"proto-cognitive exploration all the way"
"down and that these continuous models"
"that we put on top of it by by by course"
"graining um you know tiny events into"
"the kind of macroscopic things that we"
"see here that's that's an abstraction"
"that sort of loses the essential uh"
"mindfulness of it and then we have to"
"try to rebuild it again by the time we"
"get to brains but actually all we've"
"done is obscure the the fact that all"
"the way from the beginning it was"
"already digital to start with and we"
"just sort of put some put some vaseline"
"on our lens here you know to make"
"everything look um you know sort of"
"continuous which then which then made it"
"look like there was nothing going on at"
"the lower levels and then somehow we're"
"we're shocked that we have to recover it"
"from from somewhere later on"
"that that's that's what i just heard"
"from the combination of those two"
explanations
"it's a very interesting idea and it"
"connects nicely to the history of"
mathematics
"or at least the history of mathematics"
"post descartes and leibniz"
"which was"
"all built around the idea of continuous"
"functions and analysis and calculus and"
"so on"
"very very nice convenient mathematics to"
use
"but uh"
"obscure it to the surface"
"carl did you have any thoughts to add to"
that
um
[Music]
"yeah i i'd probably um"
"this is why i wanted to hang out with"
"with mike and chris to learn about"
"quantum theory because i do think"
"there's something fundamental about this"
"sort of"
"the way that we carve up the world or"
"the world the way the world can only be"
"defined in a carved way into tiles or"
quantum
"discrete things"
um
"so um i i think that the the the those"
"observations that we just heard i think"
"are quite fundamental um and it would be"
"great to understand"
um
"everything from the sort of cultural"
"perspective a discretized perspective"
"and how continuous constructs rights you"
"know space and time emerge from that um"
"you know if necessary um"
"having said that um i have to say that"
"um as a physicist i would bring"
"something else to the table so i'm quite"
"comfortable dealing with random"
"fluctuations so for me random"
"fluctuations are just variables that"
"change very very quickly"
"so if i want to write down"
"um as a physicist so now i don't talk"
"about a physicist that doesn't know"
"anything about quantum mechanics um so i"
"just want to write down a launchvan"
"equation to describe my universe um i"
"write it as a mixture of states and"
"random fluctuations and somebody asked"
"me what licenses i just saw the"
"manufacturations are very very quick and"
"the uh the states are very very slow um"
"and this is just a natural consequence"
of
"some kind of renormalization group you"
"know i i could"
"make them even slower by going to the"
"next stage scale and throw each and even"
"more fast stuff so there's nothing"
"really if you like"
"problematic uh from the point of view of"
"that kind of physicist"
"um in in the random fluctuations um"
"uh it just means that all the"
"stuff that determines flows and dynamics"
"of the kind that we can"
"that we engage with and we can plan um"
"has a particular form"
"that particular form um"
"does actually"
"bring a quantal aspect um to the table"
"or a discretization aspect of the table"
"that may or may not be if you like"
"explained away or absorbed into a"
"quantum information theoretical"
"treatment but what i'm talking about"
here
"are the mathematical image of light"
"life cycles and biorhythms and"
oscillations
"and i mean that right from the other the"
"perspective of a dendrite in my"
"hippocampus oscillating away at a fast"
"gamma frequency you know sort of"
"say 80 hertz through to the"
"the motion of the heavenly bodies"
"wherever you look you get the this"
"solenoidal flow"
um
"that is characteristic of things that"
"hang around and don't dissipate almost"
"immediately um and these are not part of"
"the random flute version but they become"
"more evident as you go away from the"
"fast random stuff into the slow um the"
"slow uh dynamics um in the sense that"
"you know clearly uh the orbit of the"
"moon around"
"well the orbit of the earth around the"
"sun for example this deals with very"
"very massive large things where all the"
"random fluctuations are effectively"
"averaged to zero um whereas if you go"
"down to the quantum scale"
"um then you know you're not licensed to"
"do that and these solenoidal flows um"
"become much less um much less apparent"
"but our scale"
"if we uh if life is um"
"on this reading of physics um"
"sufficiently classical to have um"
"oscillations biorhythms"
"um things that would you need for"
"feedback that didn't go off to plus or"
"minus infinity for example just saying"
"that you're keeping you're circulating"
"in some states or phase space"
"in a way that you keep yourself to some"
"attracting set and as you move through"
"this you are naturally going to be"
oscillating
"in a highly non-linear possibly chaotic"
"way but still the essence is life cycles"
"if that's the case then the poncharis"
"section does indeed permit a description"
"that is necessarily discretized in the"
"sense you're going to pass through the"
"neighborhood of various states and"
"discrete points in time"
recurrently
so
"that's what i was thinking from the"
"point of view of a physicist who does"
"not have the fluency of quantum"
"mechanics to get back to a discrete"
"thing but it also i think um"
"highlights the um"
"the deep connection between"
"things recurring discretely or occurring"
discretely
"being one way of defining another"
"characteristic of"
"biological self-organization which is"
"basically the repeat biorhythms and life"
cycles
"that have this sort of self-contained"
"itinerancy because in that"
"self-containment you've got this natural"
"resolution of ambiguity and uncertainty"
"because you always know you're you're on"
"the same arterial path repeatedly"
"visiting the states that you once"
"occupied so that that's what i would say"
"from the point of view of physicist i"
"may say something very different in a"
"few years time when i've learned more"
"about quantum theory so let me ask chris"
"could you ever describe that kind of"
"mathematic physicist's treatment of"
"dynamics in pure quantum information"
"theory and that at that kind of scale"
"well i i think if we if we try to think"
"of scaling up from"
from
um
"descriptions of things like quantum"
"fields then this looks impossible"
but
"if we think of it"
"informationally maybe it doesn't look"
impossible
now
"i'll go back to john wheeler's"
"notion that a bit is fundamentally the"
"answer to a yes or no question"
and
"information the information theory is"
"about bits and systems that exchange"
bits
but
question
"do you mind repeating that last part but"
what
"what wheeler's aphorism"
"doesn't specify is the complexity of the"
question
"that has a yes or no answer"
"so in in your case carl you have an"
"oscillatory system that"
"passes after a discrete time a"
"particular boundary"
so
"the the system may well be asking the"
"question have i passed this boundary"
"and the answer is yes or no"
"or am i passing the boundary right now"
"well that's one bit"
"uh that's a yes or no question but it's"
"an extremely complicated question"
so
"it may be that we can"
develop
"a theory that leaves the complexity of"
"the generative model unspecified"
"and concentrates"
"just on the bit flow"
"across the boundary"
"that counts as evidence in one direction"
"and perturbative action in the other"
direction
"and and then i think the two pictures"
"fit together rather nicely"
"because one can imagine that"
"generative model operating it that the"
"general model being the model that"
"generates the questions"
"operating in many different scales"
"where one could think of the scales as"
"computational complexity"
"and this gets back in a sense to your"
"question about language"
how
"language is a way of posing questions"
"it's a way of babbling in the world"
"now this"
"process of babbling it seems to me as"
"far as i understand it's like poking and"
"prodding to test your own self model to"
"see what's the difference between me and"
"the world it sounds like that"
"never stops even though we"
"call it babbling as if infants do it"
"does it ever stop are we not engaging in"
"this right now"
"and i like this phrase babbling all the"
"way down"
"i'm gonna put that on a t-shirt by the"
"way chris or and it also by the way"
"seems like babbling all the way up too"
"because we're constantly engaging in"
"this so firstly is that true"
"does babbling have an end"
and
"and also does it not"
"presume a self"
"in order to test the self"
"what i mean is carl when you were"
"speaking about"
"the process of babbling it's the infant"
"doing something on the world in order to"
"make a model"
"but that first part was it's it is doing"
"something to the world to me already"
"presumes the external world whereas the"
"way that i'm understanding it is that"
"the self is a model but it's also"
"in your point of view it's something"
"objective and i believe from my readings"
"of chris i don't i believe chris is more"
"on the non-dual end where it's it's it's"
"that's less the case so i'm unsure"
"anyway i just said a slew so please"
"respond to it as you"
"as you wish"
"right well i mean just to um"
"dispel the notion that the self is um"
"objective no i i didn't mean that i i"
"meant it in exactly the same way that um"
"i think both chris and mike have been"
"intimating that you know from the inside"
"of a cell or a person or the baby's"
"skull um"
your
"self um is"
"quite a a sophisticated um construct"
"fantasy hypothesis"
"that is physically realized possibly"
"neuronally in some lucky creatures and"
"some lucky children uh you may actually"
"find some children never get that far"
"you know i'm thinking here of people"
"with severe autism for example who don't"
"have a theory of mind simply because"
"they never developed the notion that um"
"i am a person um and you know what comes"
"along with that is that"
"you know if you've got very very severe"
"autism or you know if he likes other"
"theoretically idealized autism and that"
"means that personhood doesn't exist so"
"you would be i would regard you as an"
"animate french or you know"
"some um"
"interesting autonomous vehicle but you"
"would never be a person because i don't"
"i don't have the hypothesis that you"
"know there are people out there and that"
"people share certain sort of phenotypic"
"characteristics and um have intentions"
"in the same sense that i have intentions"
"so i just i'm not aware of that because"
"i just don't don't have that hypothesis"
"so it's a long-winded way of saying that"
"i didn't mean to imply"
"any objectivity here i was more going"
"the other way really i'm just saying"
that
"selfhood um"
"that would be one part of consciousness"
"and if you"
"want to associate cognition and"
"consciousness then perhaps possibly um"
"that kind of minimal selfhood would you"
"know would be necessarily part of of"
cognition
"this is a gift that you have to get by"
"crossing one of those bright lines"
"and it's just a fantasy that you bring"
"to the table to make sense of"
"all the impressions on your sort of"
"sensory surface or your holographic"
"screen or your or your cell surface or"
"also the receptors you are equipped with"
"um to sense what's going on out there"
"does that make sense yeah i know that"
"mike and and chris you may have a"
"response to that but i just want to"
"quickly respond to what professor first"
"was saying is so"
"and this is to both of you how do you"
"then prevent an existential crisis as"
"you start to study this so for example"
"carl before you and i were speaking and"
"i told you about some experiences i had"
"where i've deeply felt what you're"
"saying as being true that the self is a"
"fantasy and this oneness with all this"
"world being generated in one's mind and"
"i felt like that was akin to a psychotic"
"episode and it was extremely"
"destabilizing and to be quite frank i'm"
"still recovering from that and so i'm"
"unsure how any of you all"
"do this work without constantly"
"being in a debilitating state of of"
"existence well existence is the question"
"here that it's an existential crisis"
"which i'm inquiring about so how is it"
"that you prevent yourself from getting"
"into that how could you say these words"
"of well the self is is not objective the"
"self may be a a fantasy quote unquote"
"but not then be able to to not speak and"
"look around you in awe and and horror at"
"the same time"
"okay so that's a psychological uh"
"philosophical question anyone who wants"
"to take that up"
"i think i think there is a good deal of"
"existential um"
what
"uncertainty involved in"
uh
"in doing what we're doing so it's just"
"par for the course"
right
"how do you get over it"
"i'm not sure when gets over it"
"i i"
"think it's more"
um
[Music]
"being comfortable with it"
"you know i i i think you raise a really"
"a really important point and it's i"
"think this is in a class of"
uh
"a number of really destabilizing um"
"uh ideas that one picks up as one gets"
"older and studies things and there are"
"many of these i remember as a child"
"being completely freaked out by the fact"
"that i realized that you know we grow up"
"and we become these adults and these"
"adults bear"
"some resemblance to the children but"
"they're definitely not the same thing"
"and so in some sense you could sort of"
"see it coming it's almost even even"
"before you realize that you're gonna you"
"know you're gonna you're gonna die"
"biologically someday before long before"
"that you realize that you're going to"
"undergo some transition that's going to"
"you know turn you into a completely"
"different sort of creature which really"
"you know has some continuity but maybe"
"not you know it's certainly not you"
"persisting in the same way as you are"
"now right so some kind of weird butter"
"you know caterpillar butterfly effect"
where
"you're just not going to be around in"
"that same way as as you are now right so"
"that's kind of the first thing you you"
"realize as a child and then there's many"
"others that sort of you know you learn"
"about boltzmann brains and all the"
"different you know human arguments so"
"but you know all the stuff that you know"
"i had to i i did um"
"i did a philosophy class with my son"
"when he was little uh uh we were doing"
"um homeschooling and so i kind of did"
"this and i realized very quickly that i"
"have to be very careful with this stuff"
"because if right somebody who has the"
"capacity to understand it it's extremely"
"destabilizing and i think that uh for at"
"this point for myself uh what you know i"
"sort of go with with descartes a little"
"bit in the following sense"
"i i i'm not depressed by it in the sense"
"that whatever we discover is is a truer"
"model of the self than we may have had"
"it doesn't it i don't i don't think"
"there's any way in which it makes it"
"less um it makes us less less less"
"valuable less interesting less engaging"
"all of that is still true it's just that"
"now we've realized that a different set"
"of mechanisms can now"
"implement that magic than we thought"
"right so you may have had so you know"
"some sort of um idea that well there has"
"to be some sort of um"
"different kind of unique process that"
"makes this permanent self and therefore"
"i'm this individual and i have i have uh"
"you know i have true true beliefs and"
"preferences and i exist in some way i i"
"don't think you can ever convince"
"yourself that you that that that isn't"
"true and that you don't exist it's just"
"that now you find out that actually"
"the way you get to be that is by these"
"sets of mechanisms and they're very"
"interesting it's the sort of thing that"
"carl and chris have been talking about"
"so that's what gets you to be this"
"individual this kind of individual and"
"it's kind of amazing that that works but"
"that doesn't to me that doesn't um"
"diminish all of the things all of the"
"things that i thought were true about"
"what the individual actually is right"
"your reality the reality of it the"
"impermanent impermanence is there but we"
"knew that from the time you were a kid"
"you knew that it wasn't going to be"
"permanent so that that part you know you"
"sort of have to deal with from the start"
"after that it's all you're learning"
"after that is just that you were really"
"mistaken about what it takes to be that"
"sort of creature you thought maybe it"
"had to be some magical whatever now you"
"think that wow it's a set of you know"
"feedback loops and whatever else so"
"that's surprising but"
"that's okay we we learn about you know"
"we learn about uh different"
"underpinnings to things all the time so"
"that's okay but i don't i don't think"
"any of it diminishes the the the sort of"
"um uh just the incredible awe of of"
"being a sentient being i can think about"
"these things"
yeah
"just to reiterate that sorry i didn't in"
"any way mean to demean um our selfhood"
"or yourself in particular um by calling"
"it a fantasy i actually meant it"
"and indeed have written about it um in"
"terms of something quite fantastic"
"so we've written papers called the"
"fantastic organ the brain is a fantastic"
"organ just because it can produce these"
"fantasies it's absolutely fantastic"
"and of course they"
"you know in relation to our early"
"conversation the capacity to have these"
"fantasies which have incredible"
"explanatory power"
"if you can attain them and you can"
"maintain them um is the part of the"
"complexity which allows us to cross"
"these bright lines or these gaps uh and"
"become our cuts and become um closer to"
"you know to the kind of creatures that"
"can can even entertain the notion of the"
"heart problem"
"just to so"
"mike i just love that better answer we"
"don't know what the answer will look"
like
"i'm going to tell andy clark about that"
"he'll tell david chalmers"
"but to come back to the point so i"
"didn't mean to demean that um"
and
"you know"
"phrases that i remember coming across"
and
"having to learn uh when i was a student"
"of things like existential angst and"
"ontological security all of these things"
"um you know rear their"
"face if you are worried about these"
"things but the very fact that you are"
"able to entertain the notion that you"
"are not real is quite remarkable um and"
"i repeat is it is a gift of a fantastic"
"sort it is a kind of fantasy that very"
"few um creatures haven't and sometimes"
"even few people have so there are people"
"who actually will go out there to try"
and
"um experience that and to become and"
"treasure the uh the gift of being able"
"to make sense of the world as me and by"
"taking drugs or doing mindfulness"
therapy
"in order to actually get to a state"
"where um"
"so almost a freudian oceanic state where"
"selfhood is dissolved so they can"
"experience it and certainly if you've"
"taken um sort of psychedelic drugs in"
"sufficient quantity um you may have that"
"kind of experience that's a"
"derealization or dissociative experience"
"which is the realization that"
"your your construct your fantasy of"
"selfhood that is engaged and"
"engaging continuously and for as long as"
"you live"
um
"then um you know"
"if you want to appreciate that then you"
"have to experience the you know"
"the alternative hypothesis uh so you"
know
"experiencing derealization or this is"
depersonalization
"is actually i think"
"one really important step to"
"self-understanding so i don't see it as"
"at all threatening nor diminishing it's"
"it's just"
"part of self-understanding which not"
"everybody gets"
"the opportunity to indulge i mean i mean"
"in some you know in some sense the most"
"destabilizing thing of all ought to be"
"just the bare facts of developmental"
"biology when you learn that you are in"
"fact not some sort of uh un indivisible"
"monadic whatever which i don't even i'm"
"not even sure what that would entail if"
"you were but but the fact that we are"
"all like all intelligence is our"
"collective intelligences we are all made"
"of parts and the idea that you used to"
"be this quiescent oocyte this little bag"
"of chemical reactions that did very"
"little and then very slowly sort of step"
"by step you turned into whatever you are"
"now if that's not destabilizing i don't"
"know what is because just knowing"
"nothing knowing nothing else about"
"evolution or i mean to me developmental"
"biology is sort of like the the you know"
"the queen of of all the sciences because"
"just that fact that you go from from"
"from chemistry and physics to mind in in"
"nine months plus to however many years"
"it takes uh and that and that you are"
"literally a collection of cells that you"
"could see in pond water more or less is"
"just if you know you're you're a bunch"
"of cells in the trench coat you know"
"like the in the cartoons like if if"
"that's not destabilizing i don't know"
"what i don't know what else is"
"so quickly just i know we have to get"
"going and i'd like to wrap"
"with a set of"
"brief questions"
"but quickly carl and perhaps well anyone"
"who would like to answer what is it that"
"separates those who are depersonalized"
"or go through certain psychotic episodes"
from
"what is it that separates those who are"
"fortunately like myself where it's"
"abating and i'm able to function and i'm"
"able to have friends and so on versus"
"those who go into"
"a ward"
"because obviously those issues can like"
"you mentioned it's a gift"
"for some it's not a gift i felt like for"
"myself would i don't want that gift to"
"go i'll return that gift i wish there"
"was a receipt with it but and i still"
"actually feel like that but for some"
"obviously it's it's it's a horrible and"
"persistent feeling so what is it that"
"separates them"
"well i'll answer from the point of view"
"of a"
"psychiatrist with a with with a"
"commitment to sort of a mechanistic or"
"theoretical uh understanding i i think"
"it's um the inability to resolve the um"
"the uncertainty that is"
attends
"entertaining the dual hypothesis that i"
"may exist or i may not exist as me"
"but as soon as you increase your"
"hypothesis space you naturally induced"
uncertainty
"an ambivalence and"
"a kind of ambiguity"
"so it is exactly the same if you like um"
"we're talking about the same imperatives"
"that we've been talking about all along"
"which is to resolve uncertainty resolve"
"ambiguity to make the most sense of"
"things so if you've entertained this"
"hypothesis that you know you are not you"
"and you are you and you can't fully"
"resolve that then you will"
"find yourself in a state of chronic"
"uncertainty that unfortunately does have"
"pathological consequences um i'm not"
"sure that being in a psych ward is"
"necessarily too pathological i mean you"
know
"there are ways to live very nicely and"
"constructively and fantastically in"
"psych wars and i've done i spent two"
"years in the therapeutic community um"
"but there will be other sequelae of"
"an inability to resolve uncertainty"
"they're expressed clinically and"
"physiologically in terms of anaesthetic"
"load and the like and chronic stress and"
"the like which can be very unpleasant uh"
"and ultimately can have physical"
"consequences from the point of view you"
"know the effects on your body so the"
"question now is why can't some people"
"resolve that uncertainty i think it's"
"then a question of the"
the
biophysical
"processes that enable you to update your"
"beliefs and build good models of of your"
"world and that"
"again this is a very pragmatic answer"
"from the point of view of you know of of"
clinical
"of a clinician um"
"probably the answers lie in the way that"
"your brain has assembled itself"
to
"coordinate and attend to various sources"
"of evidence um and the it looks at the"
"mechanisms that underwrite that ability"
"to deploy attention"
"rest very much upon neuromodulating"
"neurotransmitters and the kind you you"
"know you'll have heard about in the"
"popular media and will have read about"
"things like dopamine serotonin um and"
"indeed um"
"oxytocin uh all the drugs that are"
"either used or the targets of um"
"psycholytics or psychedelics or"
"psychometics or drugs that are used to"
"try and control some of these feelings"
"and some of these signs and symptoms"
"specifically that attend um anxiety"
"disorders and"
depression
"so you know understanding the and this"
"is the not the feedback loops that do"
"self-organization in a developing embryo"
but
"the same kinds of mechanisms that do the"
"feedback loops and self-organization of"
"different um structures within the brain"
"um that can be construed as blankets"
"within blankets or holographic screens"
"within holographic screens or cells"
"within cells um or um complying the same"
"principles but in the particular"
"instance of the brain doing this and"
"understanding the neurochemistry and the"
"biophysics of this fundamental"
"sense-making self-organization"
"um it turns out that these are certain"
"these neurochemical messages um"
are
"particularly important in resolving that"
"kind of uncertainty and it may be that"
"you are have either taken drugs or you"
"have just grown up to not be able to"
"deploy these neurotransmitters possibly"
"properly um again leading us to well how"
"would you gain control of it"
"well you might want to do mindfulness"
"training meditation and the like that"
"just internal attention state training"
"basically to mentalize"
"how you deploy your attention"
"mike i know that you had a set of"
"questions that you're eager to ask"
"both carl and chris did you already get"
"to all of them"
"uh well that would be impossible but i"
"got to uh i get to men i get too many of"
"them most of the important ones i"
"learned i learned a massive amount today"
"this has been just amazing um but i will"
"be um pestering both of them with"
"additional questions in uh you know"
"years to come"
great
"to end i actually i have a question that"
"i didn't email you that just occurred to"
"me as you all were speaking it's"
"something that professor levin that you"
"said what are some aspects of your field"
"maybe their theories or concepts that"
"your peers are extremely resistant to"
"but you are not"
"wow um"
"i don't know if we got uh time for all"
"that but that's a lot that's a that's a"
"lot of stuff um i mean the most basic"
"there are many i mean the most basic"
"thing is this notion of uh profound"
"symmetries between these fields uh you"
"know this idea that you can um that you"
"can you can basically import uh"
"concepts and strategies from cognitive"
"neuroscience or behavioral science and"
"deploy them in other spaces"
"developmental biology and metabolism"
"that you can that it even makes sense to"
"talk about um you know goals memories uh"
"planning navigation uh all of these"
"kinds of things outside of what we're"
"used to which is some you know rat in"
"the maze or something like this so so"
"that continuum this idea that it goes"
"that that something important goes all"
"the way down or maybe a long way down"
"even if not all the way down that that"
"that is uh in in in a few circles that's"
"okay in most circles that that i would"
"deal with that's just that's just"
"complete you know complete heresy um"
"yeah there are many others but that's uh"
"that's kind of a basic one"
chris
"well i i think that mike really nailed"
"it with that answer"
"and um"
"i would say"
"yes it's it's not"
"a popular idea that"
"physics and biology and psychology are"
"actually all more or less the same"
science
but
"uh i think that they are"
[Music]
"professor fristen"
"yeah well that would be my favorite"
"heresy i'm just going to agree with with"
"mike and chris you know the physics"
"biology psychology they're all the same"
"thing and i just wanted to end by saying"
"uh you know heresy i'm not so sure"
"anymore i i"
"you know the number of times for example"
"i see mike levin cited"
"in high-end philosophy journals and"
treatments
"um suggests to me that in fact it's"
"going to be the minority um in at least"
"in a few years time that that don't"
"subscribe to this more holistic um um"
"encompassing um and i think um correct"
"way of viewing um you know cellular life"
"sciences but you're more generally sort"
"of the natural sciences"
so
"you know who is going to be the heretic"
"in a few years time i i suspect it won't"
"be any of us"
"and i'll end with one that i see"
"from particularly chris and michael is"
"it sounds like"
"without using the word it sounds like"
"what you all are doing or trying to"
"understand god or trying to come up with"
"the model of god and the reason why i"
"say that is because with looking at a"
"neuron and saying okay how can a neuron"
"look around and have some model and know"
"that it's embedded in something higher"
"that sounds to me like well if we apply"
"that to ourselves and continually do so"
"we would reach something akin to god and"
"then chris with the quantum babbling if"
"one can think of it like that well what"
"is babbling"
"i know that maybe you all don't want to"
"use the word god but for me"
"what i"
"i have that many of my peers are"
"extremely against would be to"
"philosophize about god or to explicate"
"god or to take god seriously as not an"
"old man in the sky with a beard"
"and so i i see you all as doing"
"something similar in him"
"i'm happy to be in your company i'm"
"extremely lucky"
"all science um"
"starts with an act of faith with a very"
"important act of faith which is that the"
"world is in some way understandable that"
"we are not just a bubble in this um you"
"know random universe that just happens"
"to you know as"
"a as a total random string of of of"
"coincidence looks like it's got laws and"
"then in a tomorrow somewhere you know"
"while you sleep the whole thing falls"
"apart and we go back to a random you"
"know sort of random distribution of"
"events so we all there's no proof of any"
"of it of any of that right we take we"
"have to take that on faith and that may"
"be for a scientist that may be the most"
"destabilizing thing if you can't get"
"yourself to believe that that that the"
"world isn't for some weird reason"
"understandable and amenable at least to"
"some extent to our logic and probing"
"then then you can't do science you can't"
"do any of the things that that we do so"
"so being uh useful and and hopefully"
"productive in in what we do"
"starts with that act of faith that is"
"just completely to my knowledge it's"
"it's it's it's it's an axiom it's not"
"based on any evidence that you could"
"possibly have so so i do think that sort"
"of underlies everything that we do just"
"this idea that we can in fact squeeze"
"some understanding out of what's going"
"on around us"
"i'd also think you'd be surprised i know"
"that you said that it doesn't comport"
"with the traditional definition of god"
"but it depends on what tradition and how"
"far back one goes because there are"
"mystics of let's say christian mystics"
"and his"
"muslim mystics or islamic mystics and so"
"on yeah and obviously then the eastern"
"end is much more"
mystical
"so okay well thank you all so much for"
for
"thank you so much for coming out to this"
"and thank you i i've learned a"
"tremendous amount and i hope you all"
"have too i i i'm blessed and thank you"
"so much"
"well thank you very much this was this"
"was a very interesting conversation and"
"thank you very much for putting it"
"together yeah absolutely this is this is"
"great great great idea thanks for having"
"us on"
"yeah i'm just super pleased super"
"pleased to have been part of it yeah it"
"went in directions that i didn't expect"
"i didn't i don't even think i looked at"
"my notes my my notepad here and i wrote"
"some notes but they occurred to me in"
"the moment okay thank you all mike i"
"know you got to get going and and"
"so well thank you all all right thank"
"you cheers cheers thanks so much bye"
"everyone bye bye"
"the podcast is now finished if you'd"
"like to support conversations like this"
"then do consider going to patreon.com"
"c-u-r-t j-a-i-m-u-n-g-a-l"
"that is kurt jaimungle it's support from"
"the patrons and from the sponsors that"
