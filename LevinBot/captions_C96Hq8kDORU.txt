"Michael Levin is a Developmental and"
"synthetic biologist and professor at"
"Tufts University he has made some very"
"important contributions towards"
"understanding bioelectricity in the role"
"that plays in developmental biology in"
"regenerative medicine in cancer research"
"and he's also very interested in the"
"foundations of cognition he's interested"
"in diverse embodiments of cognition"
"that's sort of the scalability of"
"cognition all the way from from Gene"
"regulatory networks to bioelectricity to"
"behavior and psychology and Beyond and"
"also in in synthetic engineered"
"cognitive systems I'm really intrigued"
"by the foundations of cognition"
"cognitive science I think it really"
"holds the key to understanding some very"
"very puzzling deep problems uh here we"
"start off by getting a quick rundown of"
"bioelectricity in the role that it plays"
"in developmental biology and then we go"
"on to talk about some more foundational"
"problems in cognition and cognitive"
science
"um including the the scalability of"
"cognition Consciousness a bit about goal"
"directedness and the role that has in"
"explaining the idea of identity"
"this is my conversation with Michael"
"just to start off maybe just to orient"
"the audience uh do you mind introducing"
"how bioelectricity bioelectrical States"
"uh ended up playing a role in"
"developmental biology"
"um to sort of"
"change the conventional wisdom of how"
"gene expression determines everything"
yeah
"um well uh well I mean one one thing to"
"to keep in mind is that I'm certainly"
"not saying that gene expression is not"
"important uh absolutely it's a required"
"component of this and so there are kind"
"of three streams of of um three three"
"main streams that are that are uh really"
"critical to setting up any kind of"
"patterning which is you know biome bio"
"uh chemical signaling including Gene"
"regulatory networks and transcription"
"and then there's biomechanical signaling"
"and then there's bioelectricity so all"
"of these three things are important and"
"they all sort of interplay back and"
"forth uh to to implement this this"
"cooperativity among cells to build the"
"body in various parts of it"
"um the interesting thing about"
"bioelectricity is that much like in the"
"brain it plays I think a rather unique"
"role although it's possible that someday"
"people will find that some of the other"
"modalities do it too uh I think"
"Evolution really likes to use"
"bioelectricity as a computational medium"
"so if you think about what happens in"
"the brain I mean a lot of this can be"
actually
"um nicely visualized by thinking about"
"the brain and and loosening some"
"constraints so we think about what"
"happens in the brain you have you have"
"an electrical Network and this"
"electrical Network allows very rapid"
"learning decision-making memory"
"preferences goals the you know these"
"kinds of cognitive things and then the"
"electric circuits have their say and"
"then this gets uh transduced into"
"neurotransmitter movement other seconded"
"messenger Cascades and eventually"
"changes in gene expression in the brain"
"but these are all you know sort of"
"slower Downstream steps where where a"
"lot of the initial computation is done"
"at the electrical level right so the"
"rest of the body is basically very"
"similar and that's not an accident it's"
"because I think that these bilateral"
"Dynamics were the evolutionary precursor"
"of what we see in brains and neurons so"
"I think what evolution did was basically"
"speed optimize these dynamics that had"
"always been going on since the time of"
"bacterial biofilms so I think if you"
"zoom in on a single cell level what you"
"see is electrical properties that become"
"transduced through one of half a dozen"
"we know we know about half a dozen"
"transaction mechanisms they become"
"um transduced into changes of cell"
"Behavior including transcription changes"
"including cell motility cell shape of"
"apoptosis in some cases proliferate"
"proliferation all these things so that's"
"at the that's if you zoom in at the"
"Single Cell level if you take a step"
"back and ask what is the bioelectrical"
"layer doing well it seems to be doing a"
"number of computations that have to do"
"with making decisions at the at the"
"tissue and organ level so it it decides"
"things like if you're a regenerating"
"planarian how many heads should we have"
"if you're a developing frog face where"
"do the eyes go how many eyes where does"
"the mouth go right uh those those kind"
"of decisions so that's you know our our"
"goal is not only to understand"
"the molecular details of transduction at"
"the Single Cell level but to take a step"
"back and crack the code on a tissue and"
"organ scale and to say how is it that"
"specific bioelectrical pre-patterns map"
"onto changes of gene expression and"
"Anatomy that follow them right was this"
"was this a surprise to you because I"
"mean in a way this has to have always"
"been around they're far older than human"
"brains but but as a surprise to you how"
"successful the research has been and and"
"how far is developed so so the in the"
"details absolutely so I'm always stunned"
"when when I see you know new examples of"
"bioelectric pre-patterns when I when we"
"develop new um uh control modalities"
"where we can make something new"
"phenotypes and we can make something"
"cool happen or repair a defect that to"
"me is the most amazing ass so those"
"things those things kind of surprise and"
"shock me every day uh on on the other"
"hand you know I started I started down"
"this road basically you know my my first"
"thoughts about this kind of stuff was"
"when I was probably 17"
"um coming across Becker's uh Becker's"
"Body Electric book and starting to think"
"about whether these things were not just"
"another piece of physics but actually"
"the information carriers that that that"
"might have been what the the medium by"
"which the body uh process information"
"before brains and neurons like that that"
"that's something that that's a that's a"
"a something I've been thinking about for"
"many many years and so from that"
"perspective it's kind of um it didn't"
"really fall out of the blue because"
"because I've been sort of working toward"
"this but but I'm shocked every day when"
"when I see these things actually"
"actually working it's just you know it's"
"amazing right one of the most insightful"
"points they take away from your work is"
"how biometric biological mechanisms"
"aren't aren't novel to the brain yeah uh"
"right I mean you know"
um
"it's interesting in a couple of in a"
"couple of ways on the on the one end uh"
"certainly uh there's a lot of there's a"
"lot of focus on on for example in in"
"Neuroscience of course on neurons and on"
"spiking and so on but people who study"
"fertilization physiology of you know"
"kidney inner ear of a gut these kinds of"
"things I mean those folks have been"
"studying electrical circuits for a long"
"time and of course there's a whole"
"literature on developmental"
"bioelectricity going back I mean some of"
"the first experiments are in the you"
"know in the early 1900s and then there"
"was a kind of a wave of research in the"
"30s and 40s and then again in the 60s"
"through the 80s and uh a lot of it got"
"sort of deprioritized when molecular"
"genetics came on the scene because doing"
"biochemistry is easier because you can"
"work with dead cells and tissues you can"
"you can right grind them up and extract"
"the DNA and protein this stuff is hard"
"this bioelectricity you can only see in"
"the living state so you know so so a lot"
"of that information is has been around"
"but you could you can also sort of reach"
"a lot of this from first principle if"
"you just ask yourself where did neurons"
"come from right and and and and now"
"we're starting to see that all the"
"Machinery ion channels and synaptic"
"machinery and neurotransmitters and all"
"this they're ancient and they were uh"
"even in the um"
"kind of uh uh in our unicellular"
"ancestor already had a lot of this stuff"
"right so you can sort of you can sort of"
"then naturally start to ask the question"
"okay so and and by the way some very"
"beautiful uh work in bacterial biofilms"
"now from um from grow as well lab uh so"
"yeah if you just sort of ask yourself"
"what are the evolutionary precursors of"
"the kinds of tricks that the brain is"
"able to do you know it then then it"
"becomes kind of natural to think about"
"it right right uh I read something about"
"um I found different types of memory in"
"just doing regulatory networks"
"um which was very surprising"
"yeah that's this is uh this is a"
different
"um um kind of line of research for us"
"because it's not bioelectric in any way"
"but but you know a good the majority of"
"our lab in fact the kind of the the"
"central theme of our lab is looking at"
"uh cognition and unfamiliar guises so"
"we're interested in understanding"
"different aspects of of Mind of"
"intelligence of problem solving and in"
"all kinds of weird implementations right"
"so bioelectricity is great because it"
"really helps understand the story of how"
"individual competent cells work together"
"to be a higher level uh agent that that"
"solves different problems in in"
"morphological space for example instead"
"of cellular or physiology space"
"but there are other there are other"
"architectures that do this too and Gene"
"regulatory networks um of course are"
"very popular in terms of in in standard"
"developmental biology and so on and what"
"they what what they illustrate now now"
"but also we are not the first person uh"
"if we're not the first to to to realize"
"that Gene regulatory networks can learn"
"so Richard Watson and a few other people"
"have have had papers on this for a long"
time
"um what uh what they help us see is is"
"the is the kind of uh"
"Folly of making assumptions about levels"
"of agency of of something before you"
"check it so if you look at a gene"
"regulatory Network model you would say"
"okay look this is this looks just like a"
"piece of chemistry I can see what"
"everything that's happening here there's"
"no magic with this this thing is going"
"to be basically at the level of a"
"mechanical clock right that it's a piece"
"of it's a deterministic piece of physics"
"and that has medical implications it"
"means that if I want to change how this"
"works I have to manipulate the the"
"hardware I have to remove nodes add"
"nodes change promoters add new um you"
"know new genes and so on and to change"
"the topology of the network so"
"but but and and but but that's a really"
"limiting assumption because if you if"
"you don't sort of assume that zero level"
"of of cognitive capacity here but you"
"actually say well let's find out let's"
"let's see what it can do what you can"
"then discover and what we did was to"
actually
"um probe uh something like uh uh I don't"
"know 50 or 60"
"um existing biological Gene regulatory"
"networks compared with um random ones"
"that you just make up for uh for"
"controls and you simply ask the question"
"can they learn from prior experience in"
"the grn experience means a stimulation"
"of one or more of the nodes and and so"
"so having had that experience what do"
"they do later and what we found is that"
"we can actually make a taxonomy of six"
"different kinds of learning including"
"habituation sensitization and and"
"remarkably associative learning and we"
"found that even grns are capable of if"
"you if you look at them the right way"
"meaning if you choose the right nodes"
"for your stimulus your conditional"
"stimulus your unconditional stimulus in"
"your response if you look at them the"
"right way you discover that that yeah"
"they can do Associated learning it's"
"amazing and so and so right and so that"
"it tells you two things it tells you"
"number one to be really careful when"
"making assumptions because some things"
"are smarter than you think they might be"
"and so we have to it's an empirical"
"question you have to check you can't"
"just sort of assume or or have feelings"
"about it uh that's the first thing and"
"the second thing is it gives you a"
really
"interesting new way to think about"
"um how to use drugs because this idea"
"right that that uh that you find a dose"
"and you put the patient on that dose and"
"then you sort of stay there and hope for"
"the hope for the best that's um in many"
"cases that's not going to be the best"
"way to control the pathway the the"
"better way would be a timed pulse"
"stimulation where you're literally"
"trying to uh"
"um Behavior shape the you know it's"
"Behavior shaping it's not rewiring at"
"that point so that's a completely"
"different way and and we're certainly um"
"working now on on those kinds of"
"applications right so uh like thinking"
"about the foundations of cognition uh"
"bioelectricity or geometry networks are"
"are widely used because we have the we"
"have the understanding the work is set"
"out and we have the technology and tools"
"to to intervene there but in principle"
"they're not privileged uh levels of"
"software there's no such thing as a"
"privileged substrate it's just what's"
"convenient given given the reality of it"
"is that sword right I think you're I"
"think you're right I think I think"
"there's two levels of convenience here"
"there's there's what's convenient for us"
"as scientists in that uh you know"
"there's an old saying I don't know who"
"said it but the show me the net that"
"you're using to to fish and I'll show"
"and I'll tell you what fish you can find"
"right so so they're they they they're"
"convenient for us meaning yes we found"
"them who knows what else we're not"
"finding because it does it's not"
"convenient it's a it's an alien form of"
"cognition that we're just not good at"
"noticing so so it you know Keeps Us"
"humble it should keep us humble about"
that
"um the other thing though is that"
"clearly Evolution finds it very"
"convenient so for example bioelectrics"
"is an amazingly convenient interface"
"that cells and tissues expose to whom to"
"us as Engineers but also to Evolution"
"itself to each other to other cells and"
"also to parasites and and con specifics"
"and various other things that might uh"
"um exploit them so"
"so uh but but you're right in that I"
"don't think there's anything magical"
"about either bioelectrics or grns"
"they're just the the examples we"
"understand now and it's entirely"
"possible that uh for example I there's a"
"few people that have um done some some"
"amazing work on networks of Springs and"
"literally just Springs and you know so"
"so Christopher Buckley and and Richard"
"Watson have been studying uh various"
"kinds of uh uh learning and and behavior"
"and collect in networks made of Springs"
"and for all we know there are other"
"architectures that exploit biomechanics"
"magnetics uh Optical phenomena who knows"
"right in the wide universe I mean"
"there's probably many other substrates"
"right so there might be like uh the"
"principal limits as to how far we can"
"look at the substrate like gordelian"
"type of limits as we can we can only"
"scale up to a certain extent just"
"because we might have some epistemic"
"Machinery that stops us from going"
"further yeah yeah it's entirely possible"
"I mean uh it's it's it's it's the"
"problem of giving an IQ test to somebody"
"who's smarter than you right it may be"
"really hard right it might be really"
"hard for us to recognize new kinds of"
"intelligence it's related to the problem"
"of hierarchical nested intelligence"
"which is which which I'm also really"
"interested in you know individual cells"
"work together to form larger agents that"
"solve larger problems they might they"
"form tissues and organs and the the you"
"know individuals form collectives and"
"you know ant colonies and things like"
"that one might ask as a as an individual"
"can you tell if if you are part of a"
"larger system like that and if you can"
"if you can and what might the goals of"
"that system be now I think you're right"
"in that there are probably serious"
"girdle type limits as far as really"
"being if you're really just a piece of"
"the of the of the machine to really"
"understand what the collective is doing"
"we probably cannot understand that but"
"you might be able to gather evidence"
"that something like that is going on"
"right if your if your action space is"
"being distorted"
"uh you might be able to gain evidence"
"that it's not being randomly distorted"
"so so I I like to think about this as"
"the um"
"imagine imagine for the moment that uh"
"you're a you're a neuron in a in a"
"neural network that's being trained"
"right and so if you could and I know I'm"
"mixing metaphors here but but if if you"
"were smart enough to ask the question"
"you might ask yourself do I live in a"
"cold Mechanical Universe that doesn't"
"care what happens to me or do I live in"
"some sort of mindful bigger picture"
"Universe where there's a bigger picture"
"and a grand design of some sort right so"
"humans argue about this all the time you"
"know some people are saying you know no"
"words sort of cogs in a in a mechanical"
"machine and other people say no no you"
"know life teaches me lessons and then I"
"feel like there's a greater pattern"
"right so if you if you think about that"
"from the perspective of a neuron if that"
"neuron were to conclude that uh the"
"universe that it lives in is a sort of"
"um a zero agency sort of cold"
"environment it would be factually wrong"
"because in fact right because as the"
"network is being trained for certain"
"things so you could imagine you know"
"certainly it can't have a good"
"understanding of what the goal is but it"
"might you know as these waves of back"
"propagation and and and you know sort of"
"external tuning of the wash over it it"
"might realize that you know certain"
"things get rewarded and punished in this"
"world and maybe there is right maybe"
"there is some kind of a purpose to"
"what's going on that is uh different"
"from just you know just Randomness so so"
"I don't know you know again I think I"
"think it's a good there are certain I'm"
"sure there are girdle limits but but we"
"might be able to get at least"
"probabilistic evidence that something is"
"happening to us"
"right right no that makes sense okay so"
"just for the audience do you mind uh"
"introducing this notion of a multi-scale"
competency
"hierarchy architecture and what role"
"that plays in in getting to the"
"foundations of cognition yeah"
"um uh the multi-scale competency"
"architecture is basically this notion"
"that that in biology and and there's no"
"reason why we can't uh you know it's not"
"it's not uniquely biological I mean"
"today it is but but in the future"
"there's no reason why we can't as"
"Engineers all can't use this is this"
"idea that we are that we are not only"
"nested kind of hierarchical uh beings in"
"a structural sense so we all know you"
"know there are chemical networks that"
"are that make up cells that make up"
"tissues and organs and and so on so"
"there's this hierarchy but it's not just"
"a structural scale hierarchy it's a it's"
"a hierarchy in which every layer and"
"component of that hierarchy is itself a"
"uh a goal directed agent meaning that it"
"has some competency it may be very"
"profound maybe very very very subtle"
"competency to solve problems in some"
"specific space so there are cells that"
"solve problems in metabolic and"
"physiological spaces and then there are"
"tissues that's an organs that solve"
"problems in anatomical amorphous spaces"
"and then they give rise to a human for"
"example that or or any other motile"
"animal that might solve problems in"
"three-dimensional space and and maybe"
"later you learn to operate in linguistic"
"space and who knows what else what else"
"there is"
"so this this has uh many many profound"
"implications I mean one implication is"
"that uh"
"well oftentimes people will make this"
"distinction they will say well through"
"our Collective intelligences right so"
"ant colonies and termites and then bird"
"flocks and so on and then there are real"
"intelligences like me and and so and so"
"you know then then you know maybe I"
"consider a termite with my own a a real"
"you know a collective intelligence and"
"maybe I don't but you have to make the"
"case that this is like a real entity"
"aside well the thing is there are no"
"there are all intelligences are"
"collective intelligence is because all"
"intelligences are made of Parts there is"
"no such thing as this like immutable"
"Diamond of of intelligence that is like"
"a single indivisible thing that it's"
"impossible so we are all you know you"
"and I are our bags of cells basically"
"right we are all made of of these"
"competent little little pieces of um"
"components that are neurons and other"
"things and the big puzzle here is to is"
"to understand how the competencies of"
"the individual Parts give rise to a hole"
"to the next level up that has goals and"
"competencies in a completely different"
"space and all right and and okay so so"
"so that's so that's one uh one kind of"
"implication to really understand that"
"there are no non-collective"
"intelligences we are We Are All Made of"
"Parts the second implication is for"
engineering
"uh you can ask this question um I I"
"sometimes give a talk called why why"
"don't robots get cancer so you can start"
"thinking about this this idea that right"
"now the way we build most of our"
"technology you hope let's say let's say"
"some sort of autonomous robotics you"
"hope that there's some intelligence at"
"the higher level but the parts are"
"completely passive the parts are not"
"doing anything right for by and large I"
"mean of course there's no efforts in in"
"um uh smart materials and things like"
"that so so so so so the good news is"
"that you never face the problem of robot"
"cancer meaning that the parts are never"
"going to go off and do something"
"different because they have their own"
"agenda and the coordination is broken"
"down so that that's that's good and so"
"that makes them more predictable and"
"then maybe a little more boring"
"um the bad news is that uh and we can we"
"can talk about this um some of the some"
"of the most amazing properties of living"
"things come from the fact that all of"
"these levels are cooperating and"
"competing against each other so the fact"
"that that there are multiple levels that"
"solve independ and problems is hugely"
"important and so that leads me to the"
"third implication which is for for"
"evolution now just give you a very"
"simple example we've we've shown that if"
"you have a tadpole uh and you put an eye"
"on its tail instead of in its head those"
"animals can still see the eye can"
"connect to the spinal cord the brain can"
"recognize information coming from its"
"tail somehow and and those animals can"
"still see"
"similarly uh if you make a tadpole with"
"a craniofacial organs are scrambled and"
"the mouth is sort of off to the side"
"during during the steps towards"
"metamorphosis it will all of this stuff"
"will sort of rearrange and you'll get a"
"pretty normal face out of it"
"those now what what are those those are"
"competencies of the individual organs it"
"means that if you induce an eye on the"
"tail or a mouth in the wrong off to the"
"wrong place they have the competency to"
"still get their job done the cells will"
"do what they need to do to get as close"
"to normal as possible"
"this has this has massive implications"
"for evolution because"
"if if you didn't have this if you had an"
"organism that was basically Lego right"
"where every piece just goes exactly"
"wherever the genome uh to put it that's"
"where it goes okay and I'm not sure"
"there are any organisms like this maybe"
"see Elegance maybe I'm not sure but but"
"if you had organisms like this then"
"anytime you had a mutation let's so"
"let's say that you had a mutation and"
"like all mutations it does multiple"
"things it uh let's say that it moves the"
"mouth off to the side but also does"
"something useful somewhere else well"
"Evolution would never get to see the"
"useful part because that animal would"
"starve and the fitness is zero and as"
"you would expect most mutations would um"
"would be a negative that would be"
"deleterious and and so this the search"
"space right that Evolution would have to"
"search would be really rugged because"
"you would have to wait until you found a"
"different mutation that did the good"
"thing but not move them out that might"
"be very hard it might be impossible"
"um okay uh however in contrast imagine"
"that uh you had a you had an animal"
"which is much more realistic where the"
"parts had some competencies and so now"
"this mutation shifts the mouth or the"
"eye and it also does something else well"
"now those parts will get back to where"
"they need to go they will be functional"
"so an evolution gets to explore the"
"other consequences of that mutation"
"so by having the parts be competent it"
"gives it greatly Smooths and Alters the"
"landscape of of that Evolution has to"
"search because"
"um now now all those potentially"
"negative mutations are neutral because"
"the competencies of the parts can sort"
"of make up for a lot of that so so that"
"has that has a couple of interesting"
"implications the obvious one that's"
"obvious and one that's really not"
"obvious the obvious one is that it makes"
"things much more evolvable and so it"
"right it means that uh it's You're Now"
"searching instead of searching a really"
"difficult space of all of of micro"
"positioning of all this stuff you're"
"searching some kind of a reward space"
"where it's really Behavior shaping right"
"your material is not passive it's an"
"agential material your cells already"
"have capabilities and preferences and"
"the signal processing and so on so what"
"you're searching is is the signals that"
"will get them to do specific things the"
"not obvious thing is that by having"
"competent and parts you are hiding a lot"
"of information about the genome from"
"selection because if selection gets hold"
"of a pretty good individual you can't"
"tell whether that's a good individual"
"because the genome was was amazing or"
"because the genome is actually not very"
"good but all the parts are made up for"
"it right so so maybe maybe the genome"
"had all kinds of problems with where the"
"eye is supposed to go in the mouth but"
"by the time selection acts everything's"
"where it needs to be"
"that sets up a positive feedback loop"
"that becomes an intelligence ratchet"
because
"the more competency you have the less"
"evolution is able to to to select for"
"better genomes and the only work that"
"can happen at that point is to select"
"for more competency because you can't"
"select for better Hardware because you"
"don't see the hardware you know you"
"don't see the the genetics that specify"
"the hardware but what you might be able"
"to do in evolution is to improve the"
"competency and so therefore there's this"
"kind of runaway effect where uh that's I"
"think that's and and if you want to talk"
"more about this I have an example with"
"planaria that I can talk illustrate this"
"but the idea is that it just it just"
"sort of selects for this incredible"
"competency of of of morphogenesis that"
"that try that that is able to make up"
"for all kinds of perturbations and and"
"so on for this for this for this reason"
"is that sort of a signifier of"
"intelligence that you're using the the"
"ability to uh solve whatever goal is at"
"relevant at that level uh despite all"
"sorts of changes all sorts of challenges"
"yeah I I mean so so of course there are"
"many definitions of intelligence and I'm"
"not saying mine is the only one and"
"there are many good ones but but the one"
"that I like that's appropriate for our"
"work is one that William James uh pulled"
"out and his his idea was basically"
"the ability to reach the same goal by"
"diverse means so that's that's very"
"interesting but it's a very interesting"
"definition because it's agnostic about"
"all the right stuff it doesn't mention"
"what you have to be made of it doesn't"
"mention that you have to be have a brain"
"it doesn't mention how you got here so"
"whether you were evolved or designed or"
"some combination of both doesn't say"
"anything about any of that what it does"
"is it focuses on a very kind of"
"cybernetic notion which is that you have"
"the ability to uh to to achieve some"
"sort of preferential State whether or"
"not whether you start in different other"
"configurations and the thing that uh the"
"control knob that we get to twist is"
"well there's three of them the first one"
"is how much competency do you have so"
"you could have very low competency you"
"could be a ball rolling down the hill"
"and about the only thing you know how to"
"do is minimize your your your potential"
"energy and that's and that's it right so"
"or you might be really clever and some"
"sort of autonomous vehicle or or an"
"animal or a human that there's all kinds"
"of different gradations so you so so"
"what competencies do you have and then"
"if course you have to specify the space"
"in which those goals exist right and"
"then you have to specify what the goals"
"are and all of these things are"
"empirical they're not you know this"
"isn't philosophy you can't just make"
"this up you have to make hypotheses"
"about this and then do the experiment"
"and see what competencies does your"
"system have to reach those goals in that"
space
right
"um so just a kind of conceptual question"
"um thinking about cognition intelligence"
"memory these things"
"um how how people often think of it as"
"I'm just taking a shot at it I think"
"there's a lot of diverse ways how people"
"think Foundation but"
"um think of cognition is sort of a"
"container for information processing"
"systems and then things like intentional"
"intelligence or memory or perception"
"seem to be added on uh properties of"
"information processing systems is that"
"do you think conceptually helpful"
"um and how to think about cognition or"
"would you would you change anything"
"I I like um"
"like I like uh sort of the pers the the"
"uh active inference approach you know"
"kind of like Carl friston's sort of"
"stuff where it's really very much um at"
"the beginning so it's like already very"
"simple physical systems have have some"
"ability to uh minimize certain"
"quantities and and and to do some amount"
"of active inference about what happens"
"next and so on top of that and and so I"
"can you know I can sort of tell a story"
"if you want I can tell a story about how"
"I think"
"um minimal agents arise from from"
"nothing basically but but all of the"
"capacities that we think about so so so"
"memory and and preferences and then"
"metacognition that lets you change your"
"goals and so on and then uh planning and"
"then who knows what else right all of"
"these things sort of are scaled up"
"versions of very simple things that"
"really minimal agents are doing so I can"
"tell stories about"
"um metacognition in bacteria and I can"
"tell story worries about a sense of Free"
"Will in extremely minimal kinds of"
"systems right so where yeah how do you"
"how do you address the question of where"
"it starts like is there is there a"
"bottom out somewhere where there is zero"
"cognition I know that question is very"
"um annoying to deal with because uh both"
"answers you want satisfied right like it"
"seems unsatisfying to say that oh"
"there's a point where it's just physics"
"and it stopped and it becomes live but"
"adult it's also kind of ridiculous to go"
"the other way where you say"
"um everything is alive in some sense so"
"yeah how do you how do you deal with"
"that a couple things uh I'm not going to"
"say anything about what's alive because"
"I actually don't know of a good"
"definition for that and I spend no time"
"thinking about the definition of Life"
"other people do so so it's a fine"
"question but but I don't deal with that"
"I deal with cognition which I the"
"question of how that overlaps with the"
"set of things that are alive I have no"
"idea so but but let's let's talk about"
"cognition does it go all the way down so"
"I I I'm not I'm not sure I'm not not"
"sure yet however Eileen strongly towards"
"um the answer that that that in this"
"universe there is no zero that it does"
"not go to zero the reason the reason is"
"twofold number one"
"uh imagine imagine if I said to you"
"let's come up let's come up with the"
"most the most minimal versions of What"
"cognition would have to be like what's"
"the what's the most minimal uh capacity"
"or criteria that which you would have to"
"have so if I think about what the most"
"minimal capacity is I would say it has"
"to have two things for it to to be on"
"the cognitive Spectrum it has to have"
"two things one is it has to be able to"
"take actions that are not fully"
"determined by local circumstances that"
"means that right if you're if you're a"
"billiard ball the only action you're"
"ever going to take is if you're giving a"
"push if you're given a push by something"
"else that's why you're acting right"
"there's no there's nothing that happened"
"three days ago that matters there's"
"nothing that happened you know that's"
"going to happen in the future that"
"matters it's nothing that happens you"
"know uh far away that happens it's"
"everything's pretty local"
"but but the ability to act with some"
"dependency on either future States if"
"you're really you know cognitive to be"
"able to anticipate things or or events"
"that happened a long time ago or events"
"that are far away any any ability along"
"that axis is raises the chance that"
"you're actually cognitive you have to"
"have some some ability to for non-local"
"decision but non-local action and that's"
"the first thing and the other thing is I"
"would say you have to there has to be"
"able there has to be a reasonable story"
"that could be told about you being a"
"goal directed agent so there has to be a"
"way there has to be a way to look at the"
"system where it looks like it's pursuing"
"some sort of goal with some level of"
"Competency even with the extremely low"
"but some level so so having said having"
"put out those two criteria I now really"
"you you realize that uh Elementary"
"particles already do this so so you have"
"Quantum indeterminacy which tells you"
"that they have this now it isn't it"
"isn't uh in in terms of unpredictability"
"so fundamental unpredictability now it's"
"random which is not what we want for"
"advanced cognition you don't want to be"
"a random agent that doesn't that doesn't"
"really help but the fact that the fact"
"that it is not uh fully locked down by"
"local conditions gives you that Nano you"
"know sort of minimal level of of free"
"action right that you could ask for I"
"don't know what else I don't know what"
"else minimal minimal Freedom would look"
"like if not if not that uh and the"
"ability to to pursue goals again with"
"least action principles you already see"
"that that there's this like extremely"
"low level but not zero ability to pursue"
"goal States you see it in photon paths"
"you see it in rocks uh you know do"
"whatever so"
"um of course what biology does that's"
"really amazing is scale those up in a"
"way that just being a pile of rocks does"
"not uh so so that's so that's my one one"
"reason for thinking that there's no zero"
"because as I think to the most minimal"
"things in the world that we know of they"
"seem to already have it that's the first"
"thing the second thing is uh as you as"
"you you pointed out that it's kind of"
"satisfactory in both ways uh I I think"
"the right way to think about this is to"
"go backwards if you if you start with so"
"a lot of people start forward meaning"
"that they'll say I just can't imagine"
"that paramecia have uh have you know"
"have have hopes and dreams like us well"
"well you have to do two things first of"
"all of course you scale down your"
"expectations no one is saying that"
"paramecia have hopes and dreams like us"
"but but most capacities have come from"
"simpler versions of those capacities and"
"the the way to think about this is not"
"to start with paramecia and go up is to"
"start with you and go backwards so"
"assuming that you and I believe that"
"whatever cognition is we have it we have"
"something otherwise the word means"
"nothing so we have something so now"
"let's just start walking backwards so"
"you walk backwards to when you were born"
"and you walk backwards day by day minute"
"by minute and eventually you get to a"
"spot where you are in unfertilized"
"oocyte and"
"if if having having gotten to the"
"position of an unfertilized oocyte you"
"say that okay all I see is physics and"
"chemistry I see I see Zero cognition"
here
"then you have to tell me well at what"
"stage remember we started at some"
"reasonable level of human cognition when"
"did it wink out if you if we get to zero"
"you have to tell me when it when it"
"disappeared and I mean people you know"
"uh people will will pick lines that are"
"convenient for running a society so they"
"will say you know you have agency when"
"you can sign a contract or when you can"
"rent a you know rent a car which is by"
"the way older than than when you can"
"vote it's interesting right uh uh and"
"and going backwards so so but but all of"
"this but we know all of this is baloney"
"in the same way that uh you know"
"reaching reaching maturity on your 18th"
"birthday is baloney does anything happen"
"when the clock ticks over to 18 no of"
"course not we know that it's just it's"
"just convenience so so I have never"
"heard despite people talk about phase"
"Transitions and this and that I think if"
"we take development seriously"
"developmental biology and we see how how"
"slow and continuous that process is"
"there's literally nothing that is sharp"
"that so you know sort of ticks over you"
"say oh well look on day 17 of"
"development this particular thing just"
"boom happened I mean that just doesn't"
"happen so I I've never heard of a"
"convincing place to put any phase"
"transition like that anything that's"
"sharp like that so"
um
"that leads me I I don't know of any way"
"out of this I I I think there's got to"
"be cognition to I think it has to be a"
"Continuum and I think it has to go all"
"the way down you know can can I prove"
"that there's no phase transition that"
"happens when the you know ten thousandth"
"neuron sort of gets born no I can't"
"prove that but it's completely"
"implausible to me and I've seen I've"
"seen no story like that that makes any"
"sense yeah I mean I I think the approach"
"of going backwards has to be more"
"helpful because it's empirically false"
"viable you can deal with it empirically"
"versus uh I feel like whenever we have"
"the whatever people sit down and make"
"definitions for what this is what life"
"should be this is what cognition should"
"be and then let's go progressively find"
"examples of it it never tends to work"
"out you can always found find countertop"
"examples that throw the whole Paradigm"
"up exactly exactly and and I think that"
"uh I think that developmental biology"
"and evolution too uh because you can go"
"backwards that way as well until you get"
"to you know whatever was here before"
archaea
"um if you take it seriously it's it's"
"sort of the uh the ultimate uh it's it"
"to me it's the most magical of all the"
"Sciences because you get to see in front"
"of your eyes you get to see the journey"
"that we all take from physics to mind"
"like that's it you just see it right"
"there you start with a pie with a with a"
"pile of chemicals and you end up with uh"
"with something that's going to make"
"Grand philosophical claims about you"
"know being or not being an agent and so"
"on and so so that is a slow process you"
"can watch it happen it's it's amazing"
"it's that is where all the insights"
"should come from"
"yeah as we tend to think as we begin to"
"think more about uh nested hierarchies"
"and and synthetically uh engineered"
"cognitive forms I think those"
"distinctions are going to get even more"
"loose and confusing uh well you won't be"
"able to have that simple test of this"
"thing is alive or sentient or cognitive"
"or cognitive and we should treat it"
"ethically and then this thing isn't we"
shouldn't
"I I completely agree uh what all of what"
"what uh I mean science fiction are our"
"authors have been talking about this for"
"the for the longest time but but but"
"right now uh both developmental biology"
"and synthetic bioengineering are"
"highlighting the fact that the"
"categories that we used to use so these"
"binary categories are they were never"
"any good but they're definitely not good"
"now they used to be sort of okay"
"heuristics because back in the olden"
"days you could walk up to something and"
"you could sort of knock on it right and"
"if you heard a metallic clangy sound you"
"could conclude that okay this thing came"
"from a factory and it's got very you"
"know it's got basically zero um uh or or"
"near zero agency and I'm ethically uh"
"permitted it's permissible for me to do"
"whatever I want take this thing apart if"
"you sort of knock on it and it's kind of"
"furry and and soft and wet you would"
"conclude that this is the product of"
"biological evolution and I'm supposed to"
"be nice to it and and so on now uh yeah"
"of course of course the science fiction"
"authors have been pointed out for for"
"for for many decades that yeah that only"
"works with an N of one example here on"
"Earth if you're afraid if something"
"lands on your front lawn and this thing"
"sort of trundles out and it's kind of"
"like like metallic looking but it hands"
"you this poem that it wrote and you know"
"about how happy it is to meet you like"
"what are you going to use to decide what"
"your what your responsibilities here are"
"I mean we're completely at Sea here"
"because because our categories were"
"terrible because because uh really our"
"binary definitions of of robot of"
"organism of being you know this idea"
"that our our ethical uh Norms are"
"somehow tied to a a one particular"
"um path that that that that phylogeny"
"took here on Earth and that you know"
"we're gonna we're gonna look at how much"
"your brain looks like a human brain and"
"and then and then we'll decide I mean"
"this was never this was never good but"
"but it was it was it was good enough for"
"a while to sort of you know uh keep keep"
"things rolling but but all of that none"
"of that stuff is going to survive the"
"coming decades we're going to need for"
"sure we're going to be surrounded by uh"
"creatures that defy a description using"
"old categories and and and and the"
"ethics uh is gonna have to keep up with"
that
yeah
"um just just a silly aside"
"um have you seen any any fiction or just"
"popular media where where you like it"
"like where you where you think that it"
"does Justice or asks interesting"
questions
"um yeah you know I wasn't I wasn't uh I"
"should clarify I wasn't down on sci-fi"
"at all I think sci-fi has been has done"
"has done the right thing in in bringing"
"up all these crazy Corner cases and uh"
"and it's it's the ignoring of all that"
"by by scientists who um uh that that's"
"that's really the problem uh"
"I mean you know in the I I really like"
"uh I mean one of my favorite authors is"
"uh stanislav LEM and in his uh you know"
"I I think I think that's that that's"
"that's good and also um"
"uh just kind of out of the popular uh uh"
"you know more more popular"
"um repertoire uh the the Cantina scene"
"in the original Star Wars right this"
"like just incredible mix of of crazy"
"Biologicals different uh you know"
"different robots running around you know"
"the the things that look like a"
"footstool on Wheels and then there's"
"C-3PO with concern you know existential"
"concerns about life and whatnot like"
"that that um there what you don't have"
"which which I I think they handle it way"
"better than for example in in Star Trek"
"right if you watch the new well it's not"
"new anymore but but the but the Next"
"Generation Star Trek right they had they"
"had no end of debates about oh my God"
"what is data is he this is he that Star"
"Wars didn't have any of that you you"
"everybody knew that right it was all you"
"have this giant Spectrum there were"
"every crazy creature under the sun was"
"there you had your your your"
"um Androids that you had relationships"
"with and of various various kinds and"
"there were no nobody right so they spent"
"zero time figuring out whether C-3PO had"
"a you know was was this or that or I"
"that's what I think the future is going"
"to look like I think we are going to"
"transition to uh you know the young"
"people I I think the young people today"
"have very different attitudes than than"
"a lot of the um a lot of the older folks"
"about this stuff they have no problem"
"recognizing that some of these things"
"look I don't know why uh fundamentally"
"uh I I hear all the time that you know"
"this is a living organism the you know"
"the Majesty of it you know we can't"
possibly
"what is it why does why does the the"
"process of evolution which is basically"
"this this like um"
"Meandering hill climbing search over"
"phenotype space why do we think that"
"that process has uh a unique Monopoly on"
"creating rational agents why right to me"
"if somebody said well here's the process"
"of evolution which is sort of blindly"
"pokes around and sometimes things good"
"things happen and then here is a set of"
"Engineers which by the way can also use"
"evolutionary search if they want to but"
"also they have the possibility of"
"rational design which of these two"
"things is going to come up with better"
"cognitive agents I I I'll I'll pick I'll"
"pick the engineers every time because"
"right because why would it have to only"
"be a Natural Evolution that can give"
"rise to this that makes no sense to me"
"at all and I think I think as we get"
"better and better at capturing what it"
"is that we mean by"
"um by true agency which arises"
"spontaneously in those process of Auto"
"police is where it's not a robot where"
"everything was nailed down you're struck"
"you you know your structure your your"
"your your problem space your"
"capabilities like everything is nailed"
"down by somebody else that doesn't do"
"the trick but once we as Engineers once"
"we uh really get on to some of the"
"things that are that are important about"
"agency we're going to be creating this"
"stuff like these these beings left and"
"left and right um all over the place and"
"we need to get over the fact that uh"
"we're going to be able to draw some kind"
"of binary you know some kind of binary"
"line but but it's very problematic look"
"at look at um you know what happened to"
"Darwin right Darwin basically"
"basically said well we used to think"
"there are two categories right so so you"
"know kind of dumb matter and then humans"
"and angels and whatever that's what we"
"used to think and so Darwin gave us one"
"axis of a Continuum and everybody"
"freaked out and this is still freaking"
"out about this this right there's people"
"still very upset about this the idea"
"that there's a Continuum and then you"
"have to worry about you know if we had"
"had a um if we had a some kind of early"
"hominid you know what what would your"
"responsibility to it be right like who"
"knows so so that that's already uh"
"that's already a problem forget that one"
"axis we're going to have an option space"
"a hugely dimensional option space of"
"every possibility of of of biological of"
"synthetic material of software is going"
"to be some kind of agent and uh and and"
"we're gonna have to yeah so so to me I"
"don't know to me the um oh oh and"
"there's another there's another piece so"
"so yeah so so I guess the Cantina scene"
"is the one that I always think of uh the"
"other thing the other thing that was"
"kind of cool and I I don't I didn't"
"watch the whole show so I have no idea"
"what else happened but I just remember"
one
"scene out of Westworld you know there's"
"a show Westworld on HBO right and"
"there's one there's this one scene that"
"I thought was pretty good where uh one"
"of the Androids is uh malfunctioning so"
"they say we're going to take you in for"
"repairs and when they take it in for"
"repairs what what does that look like"
"well it's a room there's a couch and"
"there's a guy with a clipboard and he"
"says okay lie down on the couch tell me"
"what's bothering you that that that's"
"that's how you go for repairs and that"
"makes perfect sense because when you get"
"to the point of complexity that you are"
"able to uh carry on a um a a"
"sophisticated interaction with with"
"human you know clients or whatever it"
"was uh by that point nobody's fixing you"
"the way that that they would fix a"
"vacuum cleaner with with you know with"
"with screwdrivers at that point you may"
"have um existential uh angst and and"
"phobias and who knows what the heck else"
"that probably where the repair process"
"probably looks like more like"
"Psychotherapy than it does like like"
"anything else so I thought I thought"
"that was a pretty good um yeah that was"
"a pretty good take on it yeah 100 I mean"
"it's just unimaginable like the"
"possibility space of things on company"
"is just unimaginable"
"um like one thing that threw me in"
"preparing for This was"
"um I know you don't like to talk about"
"Consciousness because of all the"
"confusion but um"
"um talking about what the conscious"
"experience of developing would be like"
"not just what the conscious experience"
"of this complete organism is but what is"
"what does it feel like to be to be a"
"fetus of an a developed child"
"um I mean even that's unimaginable uh"
"let alone the possibility space of"
"possible cognitive agent"
"yeah yeah uh I mean we have some we have"
"some examples right here on Earth that"
"uh have to do so so for example the um"
"uh the caterpillar butterfly transition"
"right so so never mind what is it like"
"to be a butterfly what's it like to be a"
"caterpillar becoming a butterfly when"
"your brain is literally dissolved into"
"most of the cells die every all the"
"connections are broken up a completely"
"new brain is built which by the way uh"
"contains uh at least some of the"
"original memories so that's the thing"
"you can you can train caterpillars and"
"and the and the moth or butterfly will"
"will show the information uh show"
"evidence of retention so so there's some"
"fascinating questions of personal"
"identity I mean if the memories carry"
"over then then then there's some"
"identism excuse you know cognitive"
"identity there uh what does that feel"
"like and this"
"the thing with so you know so so so yeah"
"so so what this whole issue of what's it"
like
"is really important because it shows us"
"the problem with the problem with"
"Consciousness the problem with"
"Consciousness the the the the hard"
"problem is"
"that for every other"
"type of uh the question that we may have"
"we may have a theory and those Theory"
"and what we know we we may not know if"
"it's right or wrong but we know for sure"
"is the format in which those theories"
"give answers so for example if you're"
"going to have a theory of gravity or a"
"theory of whatever you know what it"
"outputs it outputs numbers that you or"
"something like it that you can then"
"compare with with observations that's"
"what it outputs so now let's ask"
"ourselves okay imagine that we had a"
"correct Theory Of Consciousness whatever"
"it is it doesn't matter what it is but"
"let's say"
"what does it output what are the what"
"are the right what are the uh what"
"format are its predictions in because"
"anything that is is"
um
"predictions that you can compare to"
"physical outcomes that's that's a theory"
"of behavior that's not a theory of"
"Consciousness that's a theory of"
"behavior so that's fine what uh what"
"what a good theory of Consciousness even"
"output so if I want to know what is it"
"like to be a caterpillar or a or a"
"xenobot or whatever what is what is the"
"answer going to be like I mean if the"
"only thing I can think of is that it's"
"uh that it's art that it's basically the"
"idea is that what it outputs is some"
"sort of stimulus that attempts to put"
"you in in a similar state so and and"
"that there was a really I'm blanking on"
"that there was a great quote about this"
"from from somebody that to the to the"
"effect that if if you want somebody to"
"uh what was it if you want somebody to"
"be to be scared or something don't tell"
"them how scared you are tell them"
"something that makes them scared right"
"and that that basically so so the output"
"of these things is not anything like a"
"theory that we recognize it's an it's a"
"it's a protocol almost right is it here"
"well if you want to know how I feel here"
"do XYZ and then you will feel like I"
"feel as much as you know as much as"
"possible right so it's a completely"
"different way of thinking about um"
"about about you know theories and"
"predictions and and yeah trying trying"
"to understand what these uh what these"
"other uh creatures what what it's like"
"to be them is uh you know maybe a"
"hopeless endeavor"
"yeah I mean the methods are so different"
"like you said like uh I often think"
about
"um uh the contemplative practices and"
"meditation and the philosophy that's"
"attached that's attached with them it's"
"it's very interesting very fruitful but"
"I often think like is it even possible"
"to analytically understand that"
"philosophy the way that we interact with"
"Western philosophy or they're just the"
"way that we we go about it is totally"
"differently I don't think reading it"
"without without the practice involved"
"um really will help me understand"
"Consciousness uh yeah I think you're I"
"think you're you're right uh the other"
"the other thing that makes the"
"Consciousness unique is that it's one of"
"those areas where you really can't uh do"
"any you can't do experiments and make"
"progress and remain the same so so right"
"so so in every in every other uh kind of"
"thing you can do physics experiments and"
"you can do biology and behavioral"
"experiments and you can still be you"
"because because it's a third party kind"
"of uh it's a third person kind of uh of"
"a thing right I mean you're changed a"
"little bit by virtue of the fact that"
"you've now gained new knowledge you have"
"memories so you changed a little bit but"
"but it's not much uh if the only way to"
"study Consciousness is to do experiments"
"where you yourself are going to change"
"your your Consciousness is going to"
"change your propensity to have different"
"kinds of thoughts in the future are"
"going to change if you're involved in"
"some sort of contemplative practice that"
"where the goal is over some really long"
"period of time consistent effort will"
"get me to have certain kinds of thoughts"
"more or less frequently or whatever"
"you're trying to you know achieve"
"um uh yeah it it changes the subject of"
"of the experiment so and I think uh"
"people yeah people who are into that"
"stuff um you know recognize that a long"
"time ago and and point out that this is"
"very different it's a very different way"
"of doing experiments"
"okay uh shifting gear spit uh so so"
"personal identity"
"um how is the idea of goal directedness"
"relevant to understanding identity we uh"
"I try to um"
"uh I try to uh a few years ago now uh I"
"try to come up with a framework where we"
"could try to understand what a self is"
"another way to say that is is a you know"
"an agent of some sort"
"um and what I wanted was a definition"
"and a framework where you could compare"
"in the same space selves of radically"
"different construction and Providence so"
"so they might you know you could compare"
"um aliens and uh and swarms and uh Norm"
"you know sort of conventional animals"
"and and plants and uh and robots in it"
"yeah you should be able to you should be"
"able to compare them all on the same in"
"the same rubric so so what I came up"
"with my proposal was and I'm certainly"
"not the first person to uh emphasize"
"gold you know teleology of some sort uh"
"as a central binding feature of a self"
"this this idea that uh you are a self to"
"the extent that you can pursue goals"
"that are not the goals of your"
"individual parts and with some"
"competency low or higher in the middle"
"and um one thing that defines your"
"degree of of selfhood is the scale of"
"your goals literally the spatial"
"temporal scale of your goals and so this"
"is uh this is I call this a cognitive"
"light cone this idea that no no no no no"
"it's not how far out can I sense or how"
"far can I act it's how big are the goal"
"states that I can strive towards in"
"space and time so so you can imagine"
"right if you're if you're some sort of a"
"bacterium then your goal is to increase"
"the local sugar concentration right now"
"and maybe you've got a little bit of a"
"tiny bit of predictive of you know"
"capacity going forward in the gradient"
"but that's about it if if you're a dog"
"you have a lot more but but you are"
"never going to care about any you're"
"never going to have a goal about"
"anything that's you know three Towns"
"over and two weeks later like that's"
"just not going to happen right you have"
"you have some spatial and temporal"
"cognitive cone within which all your"
"goals fit if you're a human"
"uniquely you might have goals that are"
"longer than your own lifespan which"
"meaning meaning that they're"
"fundamentally on a provably unattainable"
"so you might have goals that are"
"enormous they might be planetary"
"scalable you might have world peace or"
"you want to go to Mars or you want you"
"know you're upset that the universe is"
"going to you know experience heat death"
"right so you might have you might have"
"these these enormous goals uh that are"
"that are your like home might be"
"gigantic and um and and or or maybe not"
"and uh the point is that that could also"
"possibly be the source of some of our"
"um psychosis because you know we are"
"maybe the first creature to be able to"
"have goals that are guaranteed"
"unachievable like that's that's real"
"that's a that's a tough pill to swallow"
"actually right so we are the only ones"
"at least for now that know that so it is"
"there any sort of General way of"
"thinking about how these levels of"
"Competency these different nested"
"hierarchies interact that um like can we"
"take any general lessons away from how I"
"don't know how psychology needs to pay"
"attention to to lower level mechanisms"
"or or economics needs to pay attention"
"to some mechanism or is it just a matter"
"of or is it just an empirical question"
"always that you have to kind of go in"
"and find find what's relevant and"
"operable I think I think it's largely"
"empirical but there are some principles"
"we can sort of guess at like one one"
"principle uh that that we're working"
"with is this idea that the larger system"
"is bending the option space of this of"
"the of the systems underneath it so in"
"other words uh if if you as a as a"
"subsystem are good at doing XYZ then I"
"don't need to micromanage how you're"
"going to do that but I do need to bend"
"the the reward space for you so that by"
"doing what you're good at you will"
"accomplish something that I as the"
"larger system want so so right so that"
"that idea of of the option space being"
"being distorted and this has a lot of"
"um for for it it's it's kind of obvious"
"how it works for cells but even at the"
"even at the larger scale for example"
"you've got people who um I don't know if"
"you're uh if you're a smoker and you"
"want to stop smoking one thing that"
"people will do is they'll they'll take"
"their cigarettes and their car keys and"
"you know and and and throw them out the"
"window uh at night because they know"
that
"um even though uh they're going to want"
"to smoke in the middle of the night it's"
"too much effort and it's cold it denied"
"that's not going to do it so so what"
"you're doing is you've got this higher"
"level that has large scale goals and"
"systems I really shouldn't be smoking"
"but you don't have direct control over"
"the fact that you're you're you're"
you're
"um uh circuits in your body are addicted"
"to nicotine you know you don't have any"
"direct control over that but what you"
"can do is change the the energy barrier"
"and you can make it a you can make you"
"can you can you can distort things in"
"your environment that just makes it that"
"just so you know you're not gonna when"
"you get up at night you're not going to"
"do it and so right so just this kind of"
"a silly example but but this idea that"
"it just that that's how you distort uh"
"the uh the energy landscape for your"
"other systems to reward and punish them"
"and induce them to do various things"
"so the details of all of that are is our"
"empirical questions and they need to be"
"you know kind of uh settled every time"
"but I think that idea that that we are"
"all navigating different problem spaces"
"and that our parts are good at certain"
"things and what you really want is for"
"the actions of your uh of your parts to"
"you they make it they make it easy for"
"you not to have to micromanage stuff"
"right that they're good at and and uh"
"and you have to distort their option"
"space so that you can get your own goals"
"met right so is that is that top-down"
"causality then like it's not top-down"
"causality in the sense that at the"
"emergent level you're consciously moving"
"something at the lower level but but you"
"if you can understand the goal directed"
"behavior of the lower level and somehow"
"intervene to to accomplish something"
"does that"
"yeah um I I do think that I do think"
"that top-down causation exists uh I"
"think that well the good news is that"
"they're kind of amazing now is that we"
"don't have to guess or have"
"philosophical debates about it"
"um people like Eric Hall uh have"
"actually developed a formalism where at"
"least for certain kind of systems you"
"can do the math and you can actually see"
"which level does the most work and so in"
"many cases it will be the lowest level"
"but it but but in other cases it won't"
"be so you could actually it it becomes"
"um kind of a calculable question for for"
"certain kinds of systems but I mean"
"there's some there's some amazing"
"examples in biology of top-down"
"causation for example um"
"there's this uh"
"there's this there's this uh you know uh"
"in in the in a newt there are these um"
"uh kidney tubules these little tubes"
"that go to the kidneys right if you take"
"a cross section through them you see"
"that in normal uh kidney there's about"
"eight to ten cells that that communicate"
"with each other and they form a little"
"circle and that's that's the that's the"
"tube right"
"what you can do is experimentally this"
"was discovered back in the 40s which you"
"can do experimentally is make the cell"
"size larger and larger artificially as"
"you make the cell size larger and larger"
"the new the the kidney tubule stays the"
"same now how does that happen because"
"fewer and fewer cells are now part of"
"this thing"
"the amazing thing is that if you make"
"the cells truly gigantic then just one"
"cell will bend around itself leave a"
"hole in the middle and make the tubule"
"so now so now here's where the top down"
"causation comes in that the mechanism of"
"a cell bending itself around is a"
"completely different mechanism from"
"cells uh undergoing cell to cell"
"communication and tubulogenesis so that"
"means that in the service of this larger"
"scale structure of making this tubule of"
"a certain size different molecular"
"mechanisms get called up"
"so so the idea that that uh different"
"and we have other examples that I won't"
"go into now where uh the same thing"
"happens transcriptionally where specific"
"uh pieces of the genome are used when"
"they're needed and so on it's uh I think"
"that in a lot of these cases you lose a"
"lot by deciding up front that you're"
"only going to do bottom-up emergence as"
"opposed to top down causation I think"
"you lose on pre on the predictive power"
"in a lot of these situations"
"so do do you think like our our future"
"engineering Technologies need to take a"
"hint from this that we need to develop"
"except helping sort of systems that are"
"just macro managing dumb Parts they need"
"to develop these nested hierarchies that"
"I mean it doesn't have to be to be"
"biological it does not be"
"transcriptional too anatomical to uh uh"
"neural networks and so on but but our"
"nested hierarchy is the way to go yeah"
"yeah it's essential"
"um and uh actually Engineers are already"
"pretty good at this uh we you know"
"they've been building with thermostats"
"and with things like that for a really"
"long time so Engineers are okay with"
"with with the machines that have purpose"
"and and teleology and so on it's the"
"biologists that are really upset about"
"it and uh I I think so you know Jamie"
"Davis and Davies and I just wrote a"
"review on uh engineer bioengineering"
"with agential materials and I've been"
"saying for years that uh the way we're"
"going to get transformative regenerative"
"medicine is not to micromanage the"
"hardware of where wherever you sell and"
"where all the gene expressions are but"
"to figure out uh how to"
um
"convince the collective intelligence of"
"the cells to take a certain path in"
"morph a space basically change the"
"navigation uh uh via VIA resetting the"
"goals I mean we and we've we've shown"
"this experimentally in in certain cases"
"you do much better by resetting the"
"goals of an intelligent system like that"
"than you will by micromanagement so so I"
"think I think where the benefits will"
"first show up is in regenerative"
"medicine and then uh bio you know"
"synthetic engineering and so on right"
"yeah I mean I think computer scientists"
"have a good knack for not getting"
"cripped up over these questions because"
"um they don't care about a privileged"
"substrate or a privileged hierarchy"
"level I mean as long as the"
"implementation works it works yeah yeah"
"well and and they have they have a"
"really great example uh I mean one of"
"the best examples of this is uh"
"if you look at uh you look at a you look"
"at a microprocessor taking instructions"
"and executing them right"
"you could try to be a um you know sort"
"of a a reductionist about this and you"
"can say there's no such thing as an"
"algorithm all there is is electrons"
"following Maxwell's laws of you know the"
"electron motion have you ever met a"
"coder that thinks that way I mean you"
"would never you would never you would"
"never be able to do anything if right it"
"it shows you the sterility of this view"
"if you want to achieve anything in this"
"uh in this in this discipline you have"
"to take seriously the fact that the"
"algorithm drives it's it's a it's an"
"amazing thing it's the algorithm"
"whatever the hell that is is actually"
um
"causally shifting electrons in different"
"paths through your through your circuits"
"if you don't believe that you will never"
"build anything right so yeah"
"and that's what evolution exploits right"
"like it finds ways to to build computer"
"systems yes we just finds ways to build"
"logic gates and that opens up"
"expansively the space of things that can"
"be done"
"okay sorry I know we just passed the"
"hour mark just two quick questions"
"um so so one thing goals uh I have to"
"ask you where do goals come from because"
"I mean in in feedback looped I can"
"understand sort of simple feedback loops"
"but but uh High course grade and complex"
"image of what should be built how how"
"does that happen that that's yeah yeah"
"that's that's a really uh deep question"
"and I'm not going to pretend I have any"
"the answer to it but I'll I'll I'll give"
"a couple thoughts um"
"the easiest way to sort of the the cheap"
"way to think about this is that well"
"Evolution so so Evolution makes sure"
"that we only see organisms with certain"
"kinds of goals everything else that had"
"other goals died out in the in the fight"
"for for survival okay that's that's one"
"way to think about it however"
um
"it doesn't do that it doesn't quite do"
"the trick and the reason is think about"
"um think about our xenobot so so our"
"xenobots are these synthetic uh"
"proto-organisms that are formed from"
"frog skin cells that you basically no no"
"genetic modification you take these skin"
"cells off of a frog embryo give them a"
"chance to kind of reimagine their"
"multicellularity they form something"
"completely different they form this"
"little thing that runs around and has"
"all kinds of behaviors and makes copies"
"of itself from loose cells it finds in"
"the environment"
"so so we don't know yet it's very early"
"days we don't know what their cognitive"
"capacities are we don't know what their"
"what their um behavioral goals are we"
"have no idea but they have capacities"
"like for example kinematic replication"
"meaning that if you sprinkle a bunch of"
"cells in the environment they will run"
"around compact those cells into little"
"snowballs those become more xenobots and"
"those will go and do the same thing and"
"generation you know several Generations"
"forward so now you might ask yourself"
"well where did that come from where you"
"know it did not come from was years of"
"selection to be a good xenobot because"
"there's never been any xenobots there's"
"never there's never been selection to be"
"a good xenobi so where does it come from"
um
"I I don't know uh but I think the"
"closest and and Andreas Wagner uh he is"
"he has some some really good uh books"
"like a rival of the fittest and some"
"other stuff so so he I think his"
"thoughts is the closest to mine on this"
"which is that I really think we're"
"talking about here the same question"
"that people talk about when they ask"
"where the truths of mathematics come"
"from so for example right"
um
"if you let's say you're trying to evolve"
"a triangle and so you evolve the first"
"angle and then you evolve the second"
"angle well you don't need to evolve the"
"third angle you already know what it is"
"now that's kind of amazing that's a free"
"gift that's saved Evolution a ton of"
"time where did that come from so that"
"leads the the simple question well where"
"do these truths live of geometry of"
"number Theory you know the fact that uh"
"you know if you if you have um if you"
"have 10 10 10 apples and three kids you"
"just simply cannot divide it evenly"
"right uh where does that fact live"
"because because it it isn't the same as"
"as a lot of the other kinds of"
"explanations we have the fact that you"
"couldn't do it the fact that there's no"
"mechanism that does it the explanation"
"is live somewhere in platonic"
"mathematical land right so I I it's it's"
"a very um"
"unconvinced unsatisfying uh kind of uh"
"kind of answer but I think it's the same"
"sort of question I think there are what"
"what Stu knew Stuart Newman would call"
"um inherent laws which are free gifts"
"free lunches from physics from laws of"
"computation from geometry the fact that"
"if you if as you were saying earlier if"
you
"discover an ion Channel ion"
"voltage-gated ion channels are basically"
"voltage-gated current conductances right"
"they're they're basically transistors so"
"as soon as you discover that well now"
"you've got logic gates that you can"
"build did you have to evolve a truth"
"table for the logic gate no by by virtue"
"of evolving the the the the the"
"uh the transistor that you could make a"
"logic with you get the truth table for"
"free so so all of that kind of stuff who"
"knows what else is hanging out there in"
"this like I visualize this sort of"
"invisible you know world of platonic"
"forms that are not passive they"
"uh they are um capable goals and"
"capabilities that you sort of connect"
"with by building the right physical"
"machine that can take you take advantage"
"of that you know Archimedean machines"
"you know all these kinds of things that"
"hang out there that you can make"
"Advantage take advantage of if you have"
"the right Hardware"
"oh man that's that's so unbelievably"
"hard to get to yeah mathematical"
"plainism it's just can't imagine a world"
"where it's not true can't imagine a"
"world where it is it's so confusing yeah"
"yeah I agree yeah okay final question"
"um so uh you and your lab I think are"
"exceptionally good at at managing"
"theoretical conceptual work and"
"empirical work uh in this space do you"
"sort of have any general principles or"
lessons
"wow uh yeah I mean it's it's incredibly"
"hard to the point where I feel lucky"
"whenever we manage to uh do something"
"like that and so I would be lying if I"
"said I had a general uh kind of turn the"
"crank algorithm by which this was I mean"
"I can't even necessarily reproduce It On"
"Demand never mind telling anybody else"
"how to do it"
"um I do I mean here here are here are my"
"my principles and and uh you know we"
"squeeze out of them what we can one"
"thing that I think that I try very hard"
"is to"
"try to make sure that my philosophy has"
"practical implications so right so so"
"this is for example my approach to um to"
"to agency you know I think I think that"
"agency claims are engineering claims I"
"think they are claims about how to"
"relate to systems how to control them"
"predict them uh communicate with them"
"and so on uh in the sense that I don't"
"think you can have I don't think you"
"should be able to have armchair pre-pre"
"commitments to things like well you know"
"thermostats don't have goals that's my"
"you know that's a hill I'll die on it's"
"a to me that's an empirical question"
"right all of these things that you have"
"to do experiments so so one thing we"
"tried it I try to do I used to have"
"views that uh that have practical"
"implications not everything is testable"
"right now right of course but but"
"everything should make some kind of uh"
"contact with with the reality where"
"where I I like uh theories that uh to to"
"me a good theory is one that opens new"
"new suggest new experiments so new"
"capabilities new experiments thing"
"things that people people sometimes say"
"to me I'll give a talk and people say"
"I love that I love the experiments in"
"the data but I wish you'd stop talking"
"about all this crazy agency stuff it's"
"just you know it's uncomfortable it's"
"it's probably probably you know useless"
"just just do the experiment because then"
"you don't understand we wouldn't have"
"done any of these experiments if we"
"didn't have that way of thinking about"
"it right so uh to to me the the the the"
"the ideal thing is to is to have a kind"
"of um a a generative uh sort of approach"
"to things that constantly suggests new"
"newer research programs new capabilities"
"so that's so so so we do the best we can"
"there but"
"um you know the devil is always in the"
"detail some of this stuff is testable"
"some is not and for much of it we're not"
"you know for much of it I'm not smart"
"enough to to really know what the ideal"
"right way to crack it right now is"
"hopefully as we"
"uh you know as we as we do more work it"
"becomes but but I but I but I am rather"
"uh pleased that the way that so far uh"
"we've been able to tie in some some"
"novel experimental results"
"to these kind of theories that have"
"given rice them and that makes me think"
"you know that makes me think we're at"
"least a little bit on the right track"
basically
