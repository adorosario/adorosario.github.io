"Michael Levin's work on regulating"
"intractable pattern formation in living"
"systems has made him one of the most"
"compelling biologists of our time in"
"Translation this means that his team is"
"sussing out how to develop limbs"
"regenerate limbs how to generate minds"
"and even life extension by manipulating"
"electric signals rather than genetics or"
"epigenetics his work is something that I"
"consider to be worthy of a Nobel Prize"
"and I don't think I've said that about"
"anyone on the podcast Michael Levin's"
"previous podcast on toe is in the"
"description that's a solo episode with"
"him where we go into a two-hour Deep"
"dive as well as there's a Theo locution"
"so that is him and another guest just"
"like today except between Carl friston"
"and Chris fields on Consciousness"
"yoshibak is widely considered to be the"
"Pinnacle of an AI researcher dealing"
"with emotion modeling and multi-agent"
"systems a large focus of boxes to build"
"a model of the Mind from strong AI"
"speaking of Mind Bach is one of the most"
"inventive Minds in the field of computer"
"science and has appeared several times"
"on toll prior again there's a solo"
"episode there's also a theologution"
"between yoshibak and Donald Hoffman on"
"Consciousness and yo shabach and John"
"vervaki also on in reality biology has"
"much to teach us about artificial"
"intelligence and vice versa this"
"discussion between two brilliant"
"researchers is something that I'm"
extremely
"lucky blessed fortunate to be a part of"
"as well as us as collective as an"
"audience that are fortunate enough to"
"witness approximately 30 minutes into"
"the conversation you'll see two sponsors"
"they are Masterworks and Roman I implore"
"you not to skip it as firstly watching"
"it supports toe directly and then"
"secondly they're fascinating companies"
"in and of themselves additionally you'll"
"hear from one more Trade coffee around"
"the one and a half hour mark thank you"
"and enjoy this theolocution between"
"yoshabak and Michael Levin welcome both"
"Professor Michael Evan and yoshabak it's"
"an honor to have you on the toll podcast"
"again both of you and then together"
"right now thank you it's great to be"
here
"likewise I enjoy very much being here"
"and look forward to this conversation I"
"look forward to it as well so we'll"
"start off with the question of what is"
"it that you Michael find most"
"interesting about yosho's work and then"
"Yoshi will go for you toward Michael"
yeah
"um I really enjoy the uh the breadth so"
"so I've been looking I think I've"
"probably read almost everything on your"
"on your website you know the short kind"
"of blog pieces and everything and uh"
"yeah I'm I'm uh I'm I'm a big fan of of"
"the breadth of of tackling a lot of the"
"different issues that you do with"
"respect to uh you know computation and"
"and cognition and Ai and uh you know and"
"ethics and everything I I really like"
"that aspect of it so"
"then you're sure yeah my apologies my"
"blog is not up to date I haven't uh"
"done any updates for a few years now on"
"it I think"
"um so of course I'm still in the Pro"
"process of progressing and having new"
"ideas and the ideas that I had in recent"
"years I have a great overlap with a lot"
"of the things that you are working on"
"and when I listen to your Lex podcast"
"last night there were many thoughts that"
"you had that I had stumbled on"
um
"uh that I've never heard from anybody"
"else and so I found this very"
"fascinating and thought"
"um maybe let's look at some of these"
"thoughts first and then go from there"
"and expand"
"um Beyond those ideas but uh I for"
"instance found after thinking about how"
"cells work"
"kind of obvious but missed by most"
"people in Neuroscience or in science in"
"general is that every cell has the"
"ability to send multiple message types"
"and receive multiple message types and"
"do this conditionally and learn an"
"average conditions to do that and to"
"modulate this also every cell is an"
"individual reinforcement learning agent"
"single-sided animal that tries to"
"survive by cooperating with its"
"environment gets most of its rewards"
"from its environment"
"and as a result this means that every"
"cell can in principle function like a"
"neuron it can fulfill the same learning"
"and information processing tasks as a"
"new one the only difference that exists"
"with respect to neurons or the main"
"difference is that they cannot do this"
"over very long distances because they"
"are mostly connected only to the cells"
"that are directly adjacent of course new"
"ones also only communicate to adjacent"
"cells but the adjacency of neurons is"
"such that they have Excellence parts of"
"the cell that reach very far through the"
"organism so in some sense in your one is"
"a telegraph cell that uses very specific"
"messages that are encoded in a way like"
"Morsi signals in extremely short high"
"energy bursts that allow to send"
"messages over the very long distances"
"very quickly to move the muscles of an"
"animal at the limit of what physics"
allows
"so it can compete with other animals and"
"search for food and in order to make"
"that happen it also needs to have a"
"model of the world that gets updated at"
"this higher rate so there is going to be"
"an information processing system that is"
"duplicating basically this cellular"
"brain that is made from all the other"
"cells in the body of the organism and at"
"some point these two systems get"
"decoupled they have their own codes"
"their own language so to speak and but"
"it still makes sense I guess to see the"
"brain as a telegraphic extension of the"
"community of cells in the body and for"
"me this Insight that I stumbled on just"
"because means and motive that Evolution"
"would equip cells with doing that"
"information processing if the organism"
"is long enough lives long enough and if"
"the cells share common genetic Destiny"
"so they can get attuned to each other in"
"an organism that basically every"
"organism has the potential to become"
"intelligent and if it gets old enough to"
"process enough data to get to a very"
"high degree of understanding of its"
"environment in principle so of course a"
"normal houseplant is not going to get"
"very old with compared to us because the"
"information processing is so much slower"
"so they're not going to be very smart"
"but at the level of ecosystems it's"
"conceivable that there is quite"
"considerable intelligence and then I"
"stumbled on this notion that our"
"ancestors thought that one day in"
"Fairyland equals seven years in human"
"land which is taught in the Artemis and"
"also I just at some point I revised my"
"notion of what the spirit is for"
"instance is a spirit is it's an old bird"
"for the operating system for an"
"autonomous robot"
"and the event this word was invented the"
"um only autonomous robots that were"
"known were people and plants and animals"
"and nation states and ecosystems"
"right whatever no robots built by people"
"yet but uh there was this pattern of"
"control in it that people could observe"
"that was not directly tied to the"
"hardware that was realized by the"
"hardware but disembodied in a way and"
"this notion of several is something that"
"we lost after the enlightenment when we"
"tried to deal with the"
"um wrong Christian metaphysics and"
"Superstition that came with it and threw"
"out a lot of babies with the bath water"
"and suddenly we basically lost a lot of"
"Concepts especially this concept of"
"software that existed before in a way"
"this a software being a control pattern"
"or a pattern of course a structure that"
"exists at a certain level of course"
"graining as some type of very very"
"specific physical law that he exists by"
"looking at reality from a certain angle"
"and what I liked about your work is that"
"you systematically have focused on this"
"direction of what their can do that a"
"cell is an agent and that levels of"
"agency emerge in the interaction between"
"cells and and you use a very clear"
"language and uh clear Concepts and you"
"obviously are driven by questions that"
"you want to answer which is unusual in"
"science I found that most of our"
"contemporaries in science get broken it"
"if it doesn't happen earlier during the"
"PHD into people who apply methods in"
"teams instead of people who join"
"Academia because they think it's the"
"most valuable thing they can do with"
"their lives to pursue questions that"
"they are interested and want to make"
"progress on"
"all right Michael there's plenty to"
"respond to yeah yeah lots of lots of"
ideas
"um yeah I think I think it's very uh"
"your point is very interesting about you"
"know what what it really what really"
"fundamentally is the difference between"
"neurons and other cells of course"
"evolutionarily they're reusing Machinery"
"that has been around for a very long"
"time since the time of bacteria"
"basically right so our multi our"
"unicellular ancestors had a lot of the"
"same machinery and and even I mean of"
"course axons are very can be very long"
"but but uh there are sort of"
"intermediate structures right there are"
"tunneling nanotubes and things that"
"allow cells to connect to maybe five or"
"ten diameter cell diameters away right"
"so so not terribly long but but also not"
"immediate neighbors necessarily so that"
"kind of architecture has been around for"
"a while and people like roll so well"
"look at"
um
"but a very brain-like electrical"
"signaling in bacterial Colony so this is"
"you know I think I think Evolution began"
"to reuse this toolkit specifically of"
"using this kind of communication to"
"scale up"
"um with the computational and other"
"kinds of um other kinds of uh tricks uh"
"yeah a really long time ago you know and"
"I like to I like to imagine that if"
"somebody had come to the people who were"
"inventing connectionism and the first"
"you know sort of perceptrons and neural"
"networks and so on if somebody had come"
"to them and said oh by the way sorry you"
"know we're with the biologists we we got"
"it wrong it's not the thinking isn't in"
"the brain it's in the liver and so then"
"the question is what would they do right"
"what would they have changed anything"
"about what they're doing and we said ah"
"now we have to rethink our model or with"
"is that fine who cares uh this is"
"exactly the same the same model"
"everything works just as well so I often"
"I often think about that that that"
"question what exactly do we mean by by"
"neurons and isn't it interesting that we"
"are able to to steal most of the tools"
"the concepts the Frameworks the the math"
"from neuroscience and apply it to"
"problems in other spaces so not movement"
"in three-dimensional space with muscles"
"but for example movement through"
"amorphous space right anatomical"
"amorphous space the techniques can't"
"tell the difference we use all the same"
"stuff optogenetics neurotransmitter"
"signaling we model active inference and"
"uh we see perceptual by stability you"
"name it you know we take Concepts from"
"from neuroscience and we apply it out"
"elsewhere in the body and uh generally"
"speaking uh everything works exactly the"
"same and that shows this I think what"
"you were saying that there's this really"
"interesting uh kind of um symmetry"
"between these these uh that that a lot"
"of the distinctions that we've been"
"making are you know in terms of having"
"different departments and different PHD"
"programs and other things that say you"
"know this is neuroscience this is"
"developmental biology a lot of these"
"things are just not um uh not as not as"
"firm distinctions as we used to think"
"yeah I suspect that people who insist on"
"strong disciplinary boundaries do this"
"out of of a protective impulse and what"
"I noticed by I was studying many"
"disciplines when I was young that"
"um the different methodologies are so"
"incompatible across fields that when I"
"was studying philosophy"
"um by or psychology I felt that computer"
"scientists would be laughing about the"
"methods that each of these fields are"
"using to justify what they're doing and"
"this I think is indicative of a defect"
"because if you take science into the"
"current regime of regulating it entirely"
"by peer review there is no external"
"Authority even the grand authorities are"
"mostly fields or people who have been"
"trained in The Sciences in existing"
"paradigms and then are finding the"
"continuation of those paradigms from the"
outside
"this um"
"meta paradigmatic thinking it does not"
"really exist that much in a"
"peer-reviewed paradigm and ultimately"
"when you do peer review for a couple"
"Generations it also means that if your"
"peers deteriorate there is nothing who"
"pulls your science back"
"and uh what I missed specifically in a"
"lot of the way which Neuroscience is"
"done is what you call the engineering"
stance
"and this engineering sense is very"
"powerful and you get it automatically"
"when you're a computer scientist because"
"you don't really care about language is"
"it written in what you care in is what"
"causal pattern is realized and how can"
"this be realized and how could I do it"
"how would I do it how can Evolution do"
"it what it means are it is disposal and"
"this determines the search space for the"
"things that I'm looking for but this"
"requires that I think in causal systems"
"and this thinking and causal systems is"
"not impossible to it's possible not to"
"do for a computer scientist"
"but it is unusual outside of computer"
"science and once you realize that it's"
"it's very weird and suddenly you have"
"Notions that try to replace causal"
"structure with say evidence and then you"
"notice that uh for instance evidence"
"medicine is is not about uh"
"probabilities of how something is"
"realized and must work like you see"
"people on the cruise ship getting"
"infected over distances and you think oh"
"this must be upward but no there is no"
"peer control study so there is no"
"evidence that it's airport and when you"
"look at resistive planes from the"
"outside like in this case the medical"
"profession or the medical messaging and"
"decision making or um I get terrified"
"because it directly affects us and in"
"terms of Neuroscience um of course"
"there's more theoretical for the most"
"part but there must be a reason why it's"
"for the most part a theoretical because"
"why there is no causal model that"
"clinicians can use to explain uh what is"
"happening in certain syndromes that"
"people are exhibiting and I noticed this"
"when I go to a doctor and even at a"
"reputable institution like Stanford that"
"most of the neuroscientists at some"
"level there are of most of the"
"neurologists that I'm talking towards us"
"at some level dual lists that they uh"
"don't have causal model of of the way in"
"which the brain is realizing things and"
"a lot of studies which discover that"
"very simple mechanisms like the ability"
"of human beings to use grammatical"
"structure are actually reflected in the"
"brain this is so amazing would have"
thought
foreign
"developments that existed in computer"
"science have letters on a completely"
"different track there is uh the"
"perceptron is vaguely inspired by what"
"the brain might be doing but I think"
"it's it's really a toy model or a"
"caricature of what cells are doing and"
"not in the sense that it's inferior it's"
"amazing what you can put forth with the"
"modern perceptron variations right the"
"current machine learning systems are"
"mind-blowing and what they can do but"
"they don't do it like biological"
"organisms at all it's it's very"
"different cells do not form change in"
"which they wait uh sums of real numbers"
"that there is something going on that is"
"roughly similar to it but there's a"
"self-organizing system that designs"
"itself from the inside out not by a"
"measure learning principle that applies"
"to the outside and updates weights after"
"reading and comparing them and Computing"
"gradients to the system so this"
"perspective of local surf organization"
"by reinforcement agents that try to"
"trade rewards with each other that is a"
"perspective that I find totally"
"fascinating and I wish this would have"
"come and from Neuroscience into computer"
"science but it hasn't there are some"
"people which have thought about these"
"ideas to some degree but there's been"
"very little cross-pollination and I"
"think all this talk of Neuroscience uh"
"influencing computer science is mostly"
"visual thinking"
"yeah it's also uh I find uh this you"
"know what you were saying about the"
"different disciplines it's it's kind of"
"amazing how uh well when I when I give a"
talk
"um I can always tell which department"
"I'm in by by which part of the talk"
"makes people uncomfortable and upset and"
"it's always different depending on which"
"department it is right so so there are"
"things you can say in one Department"
"that are completely obvious and you say"
"this in the in another group of people"
"and they they throw tomatoes they think"
"this is just crazy for instance"
"uh for for instance um I could I could"
"uh say in you know in in a neuroscience"
"Department I could say uh information"
"can be processed is without changes in"
"gene expression you don't need changes"
"in gene expression to process"
"information because the the the"
"processing inside a neural network that"
"runs on the physics of of action"
"potentials right so I mean so right so"
"so you can do all kinds of interesting"
"information processing and you don't"
"need genetic change sort of"
"transcriptional or genetic change for"
"that if I say the same thing in a"
"molecular genetics department that say"
"hey these cells could be processing tons"
"of information long before the the"
"transcriptome ever finds out about it"
"this is this is considered you know just"
"just completely wild because because"
"it's thought that that that most of the"
"hard work or in fact all of the hard"
"work is done in in gene regulatory"
"circuits and things like that right"
"there are other other examples if I say"
"um uh here's a uh here's a collection of"
"cells that communicate electrically to"
"to remember a particular spatial pattern"
"again molecular cell biology that's what"
"do you mean how can how can a collection"
"of cells remember a spatial pattern but"
"again in Neuroscience or in in an"
"engineering department yeah of course"
"the the of course they have electrical"
"circuits that remember patterns and can"
"do pattern completion and things like"
"that so"
"um you know views of views of causality"
"views of uh just just lots of things"
"like that that are that are very obvious"
"uh to one group of people is completely"
"taboo elsewhere so that that that"
"distinction and and and and yeah and as"
"as you as Joshua just said"
"um it impacts it impacts everything it"
"impacts education it impacts grants you"
"know Grant reviews because when these"
"kind of interdisciplinary grants come up"
"the study sections have a really hard"
"time finding people that can actually"
"review them because what often happens"
"is you'll find you'll you'll get a some"
"kind of computational biology Grant and"
"you put a proposal and you'll have some"
"people on the on the panel who are"
"biologists and some people who are the"
"computational folks and it's very hard"
"to get people that actually can"
"appreciate both sides of it and"
"understand what's happening together"
"right so they will sort of each critique"
"a certain part of it and the other part"
"they say I don't know what this is and"
"and as a result grants like that don't"
"tend to not have a champion you know one"
"person who can say no I get I get the"
"whole thing and I I think it's really"
"good or not"
"so yeah it's uh even to the point where"
"I I'm often asked you know when when"
"people want to you list me somewhere"
"they'll say so so what what what are you"
"you know what kind of what kind of uh"
"what's your field and I I never know how"
"to answer that question you know this"
"day it's been 30 years I still don't"
"know how to answer that question I I"
"just can't boil it down to one you know"
"it just wouldn't make any sense to to"
"say any of the traditional um you know"
"the traditional fields"
"so what do you say yosha when someone"
"asks you what field you're in"
"and it depends on who's asking"
"so for instance I found it quite useful"
"to sometimes say and"
"sorry I'm not a philosopher"
um
"but uh but this or"
"um I'm not that interested in machine"
"learning and I'm I did publish papers in"
"philosophy and in machine learning but"
"it's not my specialty in the sense that"
"I need to identify with it and"
"um in some sense I guess that these"
"categories are important when you try to"
"write a grant proposal or when you try"
"to find a job in a particular"
"institution and they need to fill a"
"position but for me it's more what"
"questions am I interested and what is"
"the thing that I want to make progress"
"on or what is the thing that I want to"
"build right now"
"and uh I guess that in terms of the"
"intersection I'm a cognitive scientist"
"so I was asking Michael prior to you"
"joining yosha why is that Michael that"
"you were doing podcasts and if I"
"understand correctly part of the reason"
"was because you think out loud and you"
"like to hear the other person's thoughts"
"and take notes and it Spurs your own and"
"firstly like Michael you can correct me"
"if that's incorrect and then secondly"
"yoksha I'm curious for an answer for"
"this the same question what is it that"
"you get out of doing podcasts other than"
"say some marketing for if you were"
"promoting something which I don't"
"imagine you are currently"
"uh no I'm not bucketing anything I uh"
"what I like about podcasts is the"
"ability to publish something in a format"
"that is engaging to an interesting to"
"people who actually care about it"
"I like this informal way of uh holding"
"on to some ideas and also like"
"conversations is a medium to develop"
"thought is this space in which we can"
"reflect on each other look into each"
"other's minds interact with the ideas of"
"others in real time uh the production"
"format of a podcast creates a certain"
"focus of the conversation that can be"
"useful and it's a pleasant kind of"
"tangent that focuses you to stay on task"
"and I also found that uh it's genuinely"
"useful to some people like uh with the"
"feedback that I get is that uh people"
"tell me I had this really important"
"question and I found this allowed me to"
"make a progress on it and I feel much"
"better now about these questions I uh"
"just clarified something for me that has"
"plagued me for years and"
"um put me on track to solving it or this"
"is inspired the following work so it's a"
"form of uh publishing ideas and getting"
"them into circulation in our Global"
"Health Minds that is very informal in a"
"way but it's not useless and also it's"
"uh believes me in in this instance at"
"least of the work of cutting editing and"
"so on uh but anyway so I'm very grateful"
"that you provide the service of curating"
"our conversation and putting a little"
"form that is useful to other people"
"yeah yeah there's something well the two"
"two things I was thinking of one is that"
"uh you know I mean I have conversations"
"with people all day long about these"
"issues right so people in my lab"
"collaborators whatever and most of"
"course the vast majority of those"
"conversations are not recorded and they"
"just sort of disappear into the ether"
"and then I I take something away from it"
"and the other person takes something"
"away from it but I've often thought that"
"wouldn't it be wouldn't isn't it a shame"
"that all of this is uh just just kind of"
"disappears and it would be amazing to to"
"have have a record of it and of course"
"not every conversation is you know as"
"gold but but but a lot of them are are"
"useful and interesting and uh there are"
"plenty of people that um could could be"
"interested in could could benefit from"
"it so so I really like this aspect that"
"uh we can have conversations and then"
"they are you know sort of canned and"
"they're out there for uh for for people"
"who are who are interested the other"
"kind of um aspect of it which I don't"
"really understand but but it's kind of"
"neat is that if when somebody when"
"somebody asks me to uh pre-record a talk"
"it takes crazy amount of time because"
"because I keep stopping and realizing I"
"could have said that better let me start"
"from the beginning and and it's just"
"it's it's an incredible ordeal whereas"
"something like this that's real time uh"
"I'm sure has as many you know mistakes"
"and things that I would have rather"
"fixed later but but you can't do that"
"right so you just sort of go with it and"
"that's it and then it's done and you can"
"move on so so I like I like that"
"real-time aspect of it because it just"
"it just helps you to get the ideas out"
"without getting hung up and and trying"
"to redo things 50 times"
"yeah it's a format that allows"
"tentativity if we have published we have"
"culture in sciences that requires us to"
"publish the things that we can hope to"
"prove and make the best proof that we"
"can but when we have anything"
"complicated especially when we take our"
"engineering stance we often cannot prove"
"how things work"
"instead our answers are in the realm of"
"the possible and we need to discuss the"
"possibilities and there is a value in"
"understanding these possibilities to"
"direct our future experiments and the"
"Practical work that we do to see what's"
"actually the case and we don't really"
"have a publication format for that right"
"we don't get neuroscientists to publish"
"their ideas on how the mind works"
"because nobody has a theory that they"
"can prove and as a result there is"
"basically a vacuum where theories should"
"be and the theory building happens"
"informally in conversations that"
"basically requires personal contact"
"which is a big issue once conference has"
"been virtual because that contact"
"diminished and you get a lot of"
"important ideas by reading the"
"Publications and so on but this uh what"
"could be or connecting the dots or"
"possibilities or ideas that might be"
"proven wrong later that we just exchange"
"as in the status of ideas that is"
"something that has a good place and a"
podcast
"now is this podcast some not this toe"
"podcast but podcasts in general"
"something new so for instance I was"
"thinking about this and I well podcasts"
"go back a while and Brogan invented this"
"long-form format or popularized it"
"however on television there are"
"interviews so there's Oprah and those"
"are long one hour they're 60 minutes and"
"then back in the 90s there was a three"
"and a half hour it's essentially a"
"podcast it's like Charlie Rose three and"
"a half hour conversation it's like a"
"Theo location with Freeman Dyson Daniel"
"Dennett Stephen J Gould like the Rupert"
"sheldrake all of those on the same one"
"format it's essentially a podcast"
"talking about metaphysics like man oh"
"man I can't believe that got published"
"and then also I think about it well did"
"Plato have the first podcast"
"because he's just publishing these"
"dialogues and you read them but it's not"
"as if maybe he would have published it"
"in video I think Plato was the first"
podcaster
"so is there something new about this"
"format of podcasting that wasn't there"
"before or what's new about it I think"
"it's like it's like vlogging uh blogging"
"is also not new right being able to"
"write text that you publish uh and uh"
"people can follow about your writing and"
"so on did exist in some sense before but"
"uh the internet made it possible to"
"publish this for everyone do you don't"
"need a publisher anymore and you don't"
"know your TV studio anymore you don't"
"need a broadcast station that is"
"recording your talk show and sends it to"
"an audience there is no competition with"
"other talk Source because uh there is no"
"limitations on how many people can"
"broadcast at the same time and this"
"allows an enormous diversity and of"
"thoughts and small Productions that are"
"done at a very low cost lowering the"
"threshold for putting something out"
"there and seeing what happens so in this"
"sense it's the ecosystem that emerged is"
"new because a variable change that"
"changed the cost of producing a talk"
show
"all right"
"Michael you agree"
"um yeah yeah I mean yes that and and all"
"of that and also just the fact that you"
"know uh as you as you just said uh these"
"kind of like long form things were"
"fairly rare so most of the time if"
"you're going to be in one of the"
"traditional media they tell you okay"
"you've got the you've got you know three"
"minutes uh you know we're gonna cut all"
"this stuff and we're gonna boil it down"
"to three minutes and this this is often"
"incredibly frustrating and and I"
"understand I mean we're drowned in"
"information and so so there's obviously"
"a place for very short statement on"
"things but the kind of stuff that we're"
"talking about uh cannot be boiled down"
"to to you know TV sound bites or"
"anything it's just not and and so so the"
"ability to have these long-form things"
"so that anybody who wants to really dig"
"in can hear what the actual thought is"
"as opposed to something that's that's"
"been just uh you know boiled into into a"
"very um very very short statement I"
"think is is invaluable just being able"
"to have it out there for people to find"
"now a brief note from two sponsors this"
"is a considerably easy sponsor because"
"some of you watching this are losing"
"your hair and it's not because you have"
"a you have trouble understanding the"
"content so you're pulling it out it"
"happens to approximately half of all men"
"it's uncomfortable but there are methods"
"to help and even to stop the process of"
"balding Roman offers clinically proven"
"medication to help treat hair loss all"
"of course from the comfort and privacy"
"of your own home Roman offers"
"prescription medication and"
"over-the-counter treatments they also"
"offer specially formulated shampoos and"
"conditioners with ingredients that"
"fortify and moisturize the hair to look"
"fuller research shows that 80 of men who"
"use prescription hair loss medication"
"had no further hair loss after two years"
"Roman is licensed and the whole process"
"is straightforward and discreet plans"
"start at twenty dollars a month"
"currently Roman has a special offer for"
"toe listeners that is you use the link"
"ro.co Kurt c-u-r-t to get 20 off your"
"first order again that's ro.co"
"c-u-r-t the link is in the description"
"and you get 20 off as the toe project"
"grows we get plenty of sponsor is coming"
"and I thought you know this one is a"
"fascinating company our new sponsor is"
"Masterworks Masterworks is the only"
"platform that allows you to invest in"
"multi-million dollar works of art by"
"Picasso bansky and more Masterworks has"
"given you access to invest in Fine Art"
"which is usually only accessible to"
"multi-millionaires or billionaires the"
"art that you see hanging in museums can"
"now be partially owned by you the"
"inventive Parts is that you don't need"
"to know the details of art or investing"
"Masterworks makes the whole process"
"straightforward with a clean interface"
"and exceptional customer service they"
"are innovating as more traditional"
"Investments suffer last month we"
"verified a cell which had a 21.5 percent"
"return so for instance if you were to"
"put ten thousand dollars in you would"
"now have twelve thousand Welcome to our"
"new sponsor Masterworks and the link to"
"them is in the description just so you"
"know there's in fact a wait list to join"
"their platform right now however total"
"listeners can skip the wait list by"
"visiting the link in the description as"
"well as by using the promo code theories"
"of everything again the link is in the"
"description you can see important"
"regulation A disclosures at Masterworks"
"dot com slash CD what some stance of"
"yours some belief that has changed most"
"drastically in the past few years let's"
"say three and it could be anywhere from"
"something abstruse and academic to more"
"colloquial like I didn't realize the"
"value of children or I overvalued"
"children now I'm stuck with them like"
"geez that was a mistake"
"yeah so something where I changed my"
"mind was RNA based memory transfer"
"and uh I think it's a super interesting"
"idea in this context because it's uh"
"close to uh stuff that Michael has been"
"working on and is interested in uh there"
"have been some experiments in the Soviet"
"Union I think in the 70s where"
"scientists look planaria uh trained them"
"to learn something I think they were"
"learned how to be afraid of electric"
"shocks and things like that and then"
"they put their uh the brains into a"
"blender extracted the iron a injected"
"other planaria visit and these other"
"planaria had learned it"
"and I I learned about this as a kid when"
"I in the 1980s read Soviet science"
"fiction into Twitter I grew up in"
"Eastern Germany and the evil scientist"
"uh harvested the brains of geniuses and"
"injected himself is RNA extracted from"
"these brains and thereby acquired the"
"skills and even though I'm pretty sure"
"it probably doesn't work if you if you"
"do it at this level"
"this was inspired by this original"
"research and I later heard nothing about"
"this anymore and so I dismissed it as uh"
"similar things as I read in Sputnik and"
"other Russian Publications which create"
"their own methodological Universe about"
"ball lightning that is authentic and"
"possibly sentient and so on and"
"dismissed this all as basically Another"
"Universe of another Reader's Digest"
"culture that is producing its own ideas"
"that then later on get dissolved once"
"science advanced answers because"
"everybody knows it's it's synapses it's"
"connections between neurons that matter"
"the RNA is not that important for the"
"information processing might change some"
"state but you cannot learn something by"
"extracting RNA and re-injecting it into"
"the next organism because how would that"
"work if it's done in the synapses"
"and uh then recently there were some"
"papers which replicated uh the original"
"research and has been replicated from"
"time to time"
"in different types of organisms but to"
"my knowledge not in of course macaques"
"or not even mice but so it's not clear"
"if their brains work according to the"
"same principles as planaria but planaria"
"are not"
"extremely simple organisms only a"
"handful of neurons there are something"
"intermediate with some their main"
"architecture is different from ours and"
"their functioning principles of their"
"neurons might be slightly different but"
"it's worse following this idea and going"
"down that rabbit hole and then I looked"
"for my computer science engineering"
"perspective and I realized that there"
"are always things about the synaptic"
"story that uh I find confusing because"
"they're very difficult to implement"
"so for instance weight sharing as a"
"computer scientist I require weight"
"sharing I don't know how to get around"
"this if I want to entrain myself as"
"computational Primitives in a local area"
"of of my brain for instance the ability"
"to rotate something which rotation is"
"some operator that I apply on a pattern"
"that allows this pattern to be"
"represented in a slightly different way"
"to have this object rotated a few"
"degrees but an object doesn't consist of"
"a single point it consists of many"
"features that all need to get the same"
"rotation applied to them using the same"
"mathematical Primitives so how do you"
"implement the same operator across an"
"entire brain area do you make many many"
"copies of the same pattern and computer"
"scientists solve that with so-called"
"convolutional neural networks which"
"basically use the same weights again and"
"again in different areas using only"
"training them once and making them"
"available everywhere and that would be"
"very difficult to implement and synapses"
"maybe there are ways but it's not"
"straightforward another thing is if we"
"see how training Works in babies they"
"learn something and then they get rid of"
"the Surplus synopsis initially they have"
"much more connectivity than they need"
"and uh when they get uh after they've"
"trained they optimize the way in which"
"the wiring works by discarding the"
"things they don't need to compute what"
"they want to compute so it's like"
"calling the synapses it does not uh"
"freeze or Edge the learning into the"
"brain but it optimizes the energy usage"
"of the brain another issue is that"
"patterns of activation are not"
"completely stable in the brain they in"
"the cortex if you look you find that"
"they might be moving the next day or"
"even rotate a little bit which is also"
"difficult to do with synapses you cannot"
"read out the weights and copy them"
"somewhere else in an easy"
"straightforward fashion and another"
"issue is defragmentation if you learn"
"for instance your body map into a brain"
area
"and then somebody changes your body map"
"because you have an accident and lose a"
"finger or somebody gives you an"
"artificial limp and you start to"
"integrate this into your body map how do"
"you shift all the representations around"
"how do you make space for something else"
"and move it or also initially when you"
"set up your Maps via happier learning"
"how do you make sure that the"
"neighborhoods are always correct and you"
"don't need to realign anything and I"
"guess you need some kind of realignment"
"and uh all these things seem to be"
"possible when you switch to a different"
paradigm
"and uh this so if you take this RNA"
"basically seriously go down this wrapper"
"tool what you get is"
"um the neurons are not learning a local"
"function over its neighbors but they are"
"learning how to respond to the shape of"
"an incoming activation front"
"right the spatial temporal pattern in"
"their neighborhood and they are densely"
"enough connected so the enabled is just"
"the space around them and in this space"
"they basically interpret this according"
"to a certain topology to say this uh is"
"maybe a convolution that gives me two"
"and a half D or it gives me 2D or 1D or"
"whatever the type of function is that"
"they want to compute and they learn how"
"to fire in this in response to those"
"patterns and thereby modulate the"
"patterns when they're passed on so the"
"neurons act as something like a"
"self-modulating ether so which waveforms"
"propagate that perform the computations"
"and they store the responses to the"
"distributions of incoming signals"
"possibly in RNA so you have little mix"
"tapes little tape fragments that they"
"store in the Soma and that you can make"
"more of very cheaply and easily if they"
"are successful mixtapes and their useful"
"computational Primitives that they"
"discovered and they can distribute this"
"to other neurons through the entire"
"cortex so new ones of the same type will"
"gain the knowledge to apply the same"
"computational Primitives"
"and that is something I don't know if"
"the brain is doing that and of the human"
"brain is using these principles or if"
"it's using them a lot and how important"
"this is and how many other mechanisms"
"exist but it's a mechanism that we"
"haven't so my knowledge tried very much"
"in Ai and computer science"
"and it would work there is something"
"that is a very close analog that is a"
"neural cellular automaton"
"here so basically instead of learning"
"weight uh weight shifts or weight"
"changes between adjacent new ones what"
"you learn is"
"um Global functions that tell neurons on"
"how to respond to patterns in the"
neighborhood
"and these functions are the same for"
"every point in your Matrix"
"and you can learn arbitrary functions in"
"this way and what's nice about is that"
"you only need to learn computational"
"Primitives once our kubernetworks need"
"to learn the same linear algebra over"
"and over again in many different corners"
"of the neural network because you need a"
"vector algebra for many kinds of"
"operations that we perform like for"
"instance operations in space"
"where we shift things around or rotate"
"them and if they could change exchange"
"these useful"
"um operations with each other and just"
"apply an operator whenever the"
"environment uh dictates that this would"
"be a good idea to try to apply this"
"operator right now in this context that"
"could speed up learning it could make uh"
"training much more sample efficient"
"right so something super interesting to"
"try and this is one of the rabbit holes"
"I recently fell down whenever I changed"
"my thinking based on some experiment"
"from Neuroscience that doesn't have very"
"big impact for for the mainstream of"
"Neuroscience but that I found reflected"
"in Michael's work with planaria"
"yeah that's that's super interesting"
"stuff um I I can sprinkle a few a few"
"details onto this um uh the original so"
"so the original finding in planaria was"
"um was a guy named James McConnell in"
"the in in Michigan actually in the US"
"and and then that was in the 60s the"
"early 60s and then there were some"
"really interesting Russian work um that"
"that picked it up after that uh we"
"reproduced some of it recently in using"
"modern uh modern quantitative uh"
"Automation and and things like this but"
"one of the one of the really cool"
"aspects of this and there's a whole"
"Community by the way with um you know"
"people like uh Randy gallistel and Sam"
"gershman and um you know of course"
"glansman David glansman and people who"
"are that that story of memory in the in"
"the precise details of the um of the"
"synapses is that that story is really"
"starting to crack actually for a number"
"of reasons but one of the one of the"
"cool things that that was done in the"
"Russian work and it was also done later"
"on by um uh Doug Blackiston who's who's"
"in my lab now as a staff scientist and"
"other people is this this you can"
"certain certain animals that go through"
"larval stages right so you can take so"
"what the Russians were using um beetle"
"beetle larvae and uh and Doug and other"
"people used uh used used moths and"
"butterflies so what happens is you train"
"you train the larva right so so here"
"you've got a butterfly a caterpillar so"
"so this caterpillar lives in a"
"two-dimensional world it's a soft-bodied"
"robot it lives in a two-dimensional"
"world that eats leaves and so on right"
"and so you train this thing for a"
"particular task well during"
"metamorphosis it needs to become a moth"
"or butterfly which it lives in a"
"three-dimensional world plus it's a"
"hard-bodied creature so so the"
"controller is completely different right"
"for running this for running a"
"caterpillar versus a butterfly so so"
"during that process what happens is the"
"brain is basically dissolved so most of"
"the connections are broken most of the"
"cells are gone they die uh you you put"
"together a brand new brain itself"
"assembles and you can ask all sorts of"
"interesting philosophical questions of"
"what it's like to be a creature whose"
"brain is undergoing this massive change"
"uh but the information remains and and"
"so one can ask okay this is you know"
"certainly for computer science it's it's"
"amazing to have a cop to have to have a"
"memory medium that can survive this"
"radical re Remodeling and reconstruction"
"and there's there's the RNA story but"
"but also"
"um uh you had mentioned you know does"
"this does this work from for mammals so"
"there was a guy in the 70s and 80s there"
"was a there was a guy named George Ungar"
"who did tons of he's got tons of papers"
"he uh reproduced it in rats so so his"
"was fear of the dark and he actually"
"um by by establishing this essay and"
then
"um uh you know fractionating their"
"brains and and extracting this this"
"activity now he thought it was a peptide"
"not not RNA so he he ended up with a"
"with a thing called uh scottophobin"
"which turns out to be I think an eight"
"mer peptide or something and the claim"
"was that you can transfer this"
"scotophobia you can synthesize it and"
"then transfer it from brain to brain and"
"and that's and that's you know that's"
"that's that's what he thought it was and"
"then of course I think David glansman"
"favors RNA again but yeah I agree with"
"you I think I think that's a that's a"
"that's a super important story of how it"
"is that this kind of information can"
"survive uh just just massive uh"
"remodeling of the of the cognitive"
"substrate in planaria what we what we"
"did and and planaria you know they they"
"have a true centralized brain they have"
"all the same neurotransmitters that we"
"have they're not as simple a simple"
organism
"um what we did was McConnell's first"
"experiments which is to train them on"
"something and we train them to recognize"
"a laser etched um kind of bumpy pattern"
"on the bottom of the dish to recognize"
"that that's where their food was going"
"to be found so they made this"
"association between this pattern and the"
"and getting food and then we cut their"
"heads off and and we took the Tails and"
"the Tails sit there for 10 days doing"
"nothing and then eventually they grow a"
"new brain and what happens is that"
"information is then imprinted onto the"
"new brain and then and then you can"
"recover behavioral you know evidence"
"that they remember the information"
"so so that's pretty cool too because it"
"suggests that well we don't know if the"
"information is everywhere or if it's in"
"other places in the peripheral nervous"
"system or in this you know in the Nerf"
"core that we don't know where it is yet"
"but it's clear that it can move around"
"that the information can move around in"
"the body because it can be in the"
"posterior half and then imprinted onto"
"the brain which actually drives all the"
"all the behaviors"
"so thinking about that I I totally agree"
"that this is this is a really important"
"rabbit hole for asking but but it has it"
"there's an interesting puzzle here which"
"which is which is this you know it's one"
"thing to remember things that are"
"evolutionarily uh adaptive like fear of"
"the dark and things like this but"
"imagine and this hasn't really been done"
"well but imagine for a moment if we"
"could train them to something that is"
"completely novel let's say let's say we"
"train them um uh three yellow life"
"flashes means so take a step to your"
"left otherwise you get shocked something"
"like that and let's say they learn to do"
"it we haven't done this yet but let's"
"say let's say this could be could work"
"one of the big uh puzzles is going to be"
"when you extract whatever it is that you"
"extract let's say it's RNA or protein"
"whatever it is you stick it into the"
"brain of a recipient host and in order"
"for that memory to transfer one of the"
"things that the host has to be able to"
"do is has to be able to decode it in"
"order to decode it it's one thing if we"
"share the same code book and by"
"Evolution we could have this same code"
"book for things that come up all the"
"time like fear of the dark fear you know"
"things like that but how do you how how"
"would the recipient look at a a a a"
"weird sort of you know some some kind of"
"crazy hairpin RNA structure and look at"
"and and analyze it and be like oh yes"
"that's three light flashes and then uh"
"step to the left I see so you would need"
"to be able to interpret somehow this the"
"structure and convert it back to the"
"behavior and for and for behaviors that"
"are truly arbitrary that might be I I"
"don't know actually how that would work"
"and so so I think the frontier of this"
"field is going to be to have a really uh"
"convincing demonstration of of a"
"transfer of a memory that doesn't have a"
"plausible pre-existing shared"
"evolutionary decoding because because"
"otherwise you have a you have a real"
"puzzle as to how the how the the"
"decoding is going to work so this this"
"idea and and then and then even without"
"the transfer you can also think of it a"
"different way every memory is like a"
"message is like basically a transplanted"
"message from your past self to your"
"future self meaning that you still have"
"to decode your memories whatever your"
"memories are in an important sense you"
"have to you know those engrams you have"
"to decode them somehow so"
"um that that whole issue of of encoding"
"and decoding whatever the substrate of"
"memory is is you know maybe one of the"
"most important questions there are"
"one of the ways I we can think about"
"these engrams I think that there are"
"priors that condition what kinds of"
"features are being spawned in which"
"context for instance when we see a new"
"scene the way that perception seems to"
"be working is that we uh spawn lots lots"
"of feature controllers that then"
"organize into objects that are"
"controlled at the level of the scene"
"and uh this is basically a game engine"
"that is forming in our brain that is"
"creating a population of interacting"
"objects that are tuned to track our"
"perceptual data at the lowest level so"
"all the patterns that we get from our"
"retina and so on uh are samples noisy"
samples
"um that are difficult to interpret but"
"we are matching them into these"
"hierarchies of features that are"
"translated into objects that assign"
"every feed a feature to exactly one"
"object and every pixel so to speak to"
"exactly one except in the case of"
"transparency and use this to interpret"
"the scene that is happening in front of"
"us and when we are in the dark"
"what happens is that we spawn lots of"
"object controllers without being able to"
"disprove them because there is no data"
"that forces us to reject them and if you"
"have a vivid imagination especially as a"
"child you will feel this Darkness"
"automatically with lots of objects many"
"of which will be scary"
"and so I think that lots of the fear of"
"the dark doesn't need a lot of encoding"
"in our brain it is just an artifact of"
"the fact that there are scary things in"
"the world which I learned to represent"
"at an early age and that we cannot"
"disprove them that they just will just"
spawn
"I remember this vividly as a child that"
"whenever I had to go into the dark"
"basement to uh get some food in our"
"house uh in the countryside that this"
"Darkness automatically filled with all"
"sorts of shapes and things and"
possibilities
"and it took me later to learn that uh"
"you need to be much more afraid of the"
"ghosts that can hide in the light"
"so what would be the implications of if"
"you were able to transfer memory for"
"something that's"
"not trivial so nothing that's like an"
"archetype of fear of the dark between"
"a mammal like rats"
"and when I say transfer memory I mean in"
"this way that you blend up the brain or"
"you and also can you explain what's"
"meant by I think I understand what it"
"means to blend the brain of a planaria"
"but I don't think that's the same"
"process that's going on in rats maybe it"
"is they they well ongar did exactly the"
"same thing he would train rats for"
"particular tasks he would extract the"
"brain literally liquefy to extract the"
"chemical contents uh he would then"
"either inject the whole extract or a"
"filtered extract where you would divide"
"it up you'd fractionated so here's the"
"rnas here's the proteins here you know"
"other things uh and and then he would"
"inject that liquid directly into the"
"brains of recipient rats so you know"
"when you do that you lose you lose"
"spatial structure on the input because"
"you just Blended your brain whatever"
"spatial structure otherwise you just"
"destroyed it also on the recipient you"
"just you just inject it it's not you"
"know you're not finding that particular"
"place where you're going to stick that"
"you just inject this this thing right in"
"the middle of the brain who knows where"
"it goes you know where the fluid goes is"
"it sort of there's no spatial"
"specificity there whatsoever so if that"
"works uh what you're counting on is the"
"ability of the brain to take up"
"information via a completely novel route"
"so it's not information that's for"
"example visual right visual information"
"the accounts it comes in exactly the"
"same place all the time right there are"
"there are there are optic nerves that"
"connect to the same place in the in the"
"brain and that's where that information"
"arrives if you bathe the brain in some"
"sort of uh informational extract you're"
"basically asking the cells to take it up"
"almost as as a primitive animal would"
"with taste or touch you right that's"
"kind of distributed all over the body"
"and you can sort of pick it up anywhere"
"and then you have to process this"
"information so so you've got those"
"issues right off the bat right that"
"you've destroyed the incoming spatial"
"structure you you can't really count on"
"where it's going to land in the brain"
"and and then the third thing is as you"
"just mentioned is the idea that"
"especially if we start with information"
"that isn't any that is is that is so um"
"uh kind of uh specific and"
um
"you know kind of uh invented you know"
"that free light flashes means move to"
"your left I mean there's never there's"
"never been an evolutionary reason to"
"have that encoded like as you just said"
"having a fear of the dark is absolutely"
"a natural kind of thing that shows that"
"that you can expect but and then there"
"are many other things like that but but"
"something something as as contrived as"
"as you know three light flashes and then"
"you move to your left there's no reason"
"to think that we have a built-in way to"
"recognize that so when you as a as a"
"recipient brain are handed this weird uh"
"molecule with a particular structure or"
"or a set of molecules uh being able to"
"analyze that having the cells in your"
"brain or or other parts of the body"
"actually that could Analyze That and"
"recover that original information would"
"be extremely puzzling I actually don't"
"know how that would work and I'm a big"
"fan of of unlikely sounding experiments"
"that have implications if they would"
"work so this is something that uh that I"
"think should absolutely be done and um"
"and you know at some point we'll we'll"
"do it but we haven't done it yet but so"
"how far did the research in my school"
"what is the complexity of things that"
"could be transmitted via this road the I"
"as as I I don't remember everything that"
"he did uh the vast majority of he he did"
not
"um go"
"far to test all the complexities what he"
"tried to do was because as you can"
"imagine he faced incredible opposition"
"right so so everybody you know sort of"
"wanted to critique this thing so he"
"spent all of his time on he picked one"
"simple assay which was this fear of the"
"dark thing and then he just he just"
"bashed it for for 20 years uh to just"
"finally try to kind of crack that into"
"the into the Paradigm he did not"
"um as far as I know do lots of different"
"assays to try and make it more complex I"
"think uh I think it you know it's it's"
"very ripe for for investigation uh this"
"is the kind of did anyone else build"
"upon his work"
"um not that I know I mean I mean David"
"glansman is the best modern person who"
"works on this right so he does aplizia"
"and he you know and he does RNA so so he"
"favors um he favors RNA"
"um there's a little bit of work from um"
"in Israel with C elegans uh he's kind of"
"looking into that it uh there's related"
"work that has to do with cryogenics"
"which is this this you know this idea"
"idea that that if if it is if if"
"memories are a particular kind of"
"dynamic electrical State then some sort"
"of cryogenic freezing is probably going"
"to disrupt that whereas if it's a stable"
"molecule then it should survive so again"
"I think there are people interested in"
"that aspect of it but I'm not sure"
"um I'm not sure they've done anything"
"with it there's also a goraf uh"
"venkataraman I think he's oh yes yes"
"yeah yeah yeah yeah he uh taught me that"
"uh he has been working on this for"
"several years but he said It's"
"sociologically Tricky and that's to me"
"fascinating that we should care about"
"that what does he mean by that what do"
"you care about what stupid people think"
"uh if this uh possibility exists that"
"this works the upside is so big that"
"it's criminal to not research this I I"
"think it's a disaster that you can read"
"uh introductory textbooks on your"
"residence and never ever hear about any"
"of these experiments yeah yeah like uh"
"everybody who gets the introductory"
"stuff on Neuroscience only knows about"
"uh information stored in the connect"
"home and this leads to for instance the"
"blue brain project if that if RNA based"
"memory transfer is a thing then this"
"entire project is doomed and because you"
"cannot get the story out of uh just"
"recording the contact home or the most"
"of the research right now is focused on"
"reconstructing The Chronic tone as as it"
"was circuitry and hoping that we can get"
"the functionality of information"
"processing and to use the specificity of"
"the particular brain what it has learned"
"from the connections between neurons but"
"what if it turns out this doesn't matter"
"what is if you just need a connection"
"that dense enough and so basically"
"stochastic lattice that is somewhat"
"randomly wired and what matters is what"
"the new ones are doing with the"
"information that they're getting through"
"this ether to this lattice right this"
"changes the entire way in which we need"
"to look at things and if this"
"possibility exists and if this"
"possibility it's just one percent but"
"there is some experimentice points in"
"this direction it is not"
"um it's ridiculous to not pursue this"
"with high pressure and focus on it and"
"support research that goes in this"
"direction basically what's useful is not"
"so much answering questions in science"
"it's discovering questions it's"
"discovering new uncertainty reducing the"
"uncertainty is much easier than"
"discovering new areas of where you"
"thought that you were certain"
"but that allow you to get new insights"
"and it seems to me that a lot of"
"Neuroscience is stuck that does not"
"produce uh results that seem to"
"accumulate in an obvious way towards a"
"theory on how the brain processes"
"information yeah so the Neuroscience I"
"just don't deliver input to the"
"researchers and add the Transformer is"
"not the result of uh reading a lot of"
"Neuroscience it's really mostly the"
"result of people thinking about"
"statistics of data processing and it"
"would be great if we would focus on"
"ideas that are promising and new and"
"that have the power to shake existing"
"paradigms yeah this is you know this is"
"this is so important and it's not just"
"Neuroscience in developmental biology we"
"have exactly the same thing and and I'll"
"just give you two two very simple"
"examples of it where and I tell the"
"students when I when I give talks to"
"students I say isn't it amazing that"
"that in in your whole"
"course of biology in your developmental"
"biology textbook there's not a mention"
"of any of this because it completely um"
"uh just undermines a lot of the basic"
"assumptions so here's a couple of"
"examples one one example is that as of"
"trophic memory and deer so there are"
"species of deer that every year they"
"regenerate that you know the whole so"
"they make this antler rack on their"
"heads the whole thing falls off and then"
"it regrows the next year so these two"
"guys bubenic which are the Father and"
"Son team that did these experiments for"
"40 years and actually have all these"
"antlers in my lab now because when when"
"the younger one retired I asked he sent"
"me all these things all these antlers"
"the idea is this um what you can do is"
"you take a knife and somewhere in this"
"Branch structure you you make a wound"
"and the bone will heal and you get a"
"little callous and that's you know"
"that's it for that year then the whole"
"thing drops off and then next year"
"it starts to grow and it will make an"
"ectopic tine an ectopic Branch at the"
"point where you injured it last year and"
"this goes on for five or six years and"
"then eventually it goes away and and and"
"you get a normal normal rack again and"
"so the the amazing thing about it is"
"that you know as you you could you can"
"you can the the the standard models for"
"for patterning for morphogenesis are"
"these kind of um Gene regulatory"
"networks and and you know genetic um"
"Kinds of Kinds of uh biochemical"
"gradients and so on you know if you try"
"to try to come up with a with a with a"
"model for this so for for encoding an"
"arbitrary Point within a branch"
"structure that your cells at the scalp"
"have to remember for months after the"
"whole thing is dropped off and then not"
"only remember it but then implement it"
"so that when the bone starts to grow"
"something says oh yes that's the you"
"know the start another another time"
"growing to your left exactly exactly"
"here right trying to trying to make a"
"model of this using the standard tools"
"of the field is uh just just incredibly"
"difficult and and this is that that's"
"and there are other examples of this but"
"this kind of"
"non-non-genetic memory that's just very"
"difficult to explain with standard"
"models the other thing which is any I"
"think an even bigger Scandal is the"
"whole situation with planaria"
um
"planaria some species of planaria the"
"way they reproduce is they tear"
"themselves in half each half regenerates"
"the missing piece and now you've got two"
"that's how they reproduce so if you're"
"going to do that what you end up"
"avoiding is weissman's barrier this idea"
"that when we get mutations in our body"
"our children don't inherit those"
"mutations right so this means that any"
"mutation that doesn't kill the stem cell"
"in the body gets Amplified as that cell"
"contributes to regrowing the worm so"
"every as a result of this for for 400"
"million years these planaria have"
"accumulative mutations their genomes are"
"an incredible mess their cells are"
"basically mixoploid that meaning meaning"
"they're like a tumor every cell has a"
"different number of chromosomes"
"potentially they just they just look"
"look you know it just looks horrible as"
"an end result you've got an animal that"
"is Immortal incredibly good at"
"regenerating with 100 Fidelity and very"
"resistant to cancer now this is all of"
"this is the exact opposite of the"
"message you get uh from from from a"
"typical course through through biology"
"which it says that what is the genome"
"for The genome is for setting your body"
"structure if you mess with the genome"
"that information goes away you get you"
"get aging you get cancer right why does"
"the animal with the worst genome have"
"the the the best anatomical Fidelity I"
"mean that's just that and and I think we"
"actually as of as of you know a few"
"months ago we actually I think have some"
"insight into this but but but it's been"
"bugging me for for years and this is the"
"kind of thing that nobody ever talks"
"about because it it goes against the"
"general Assumption of what of what"
"genomes actually do and and what they're"
"for and you know this this complete lack"
"of uh correlation between the genome in"
"fact an anti-correlation between the"
"genome quality and the incredible"
"ability of this of this animal to uh to"
"to to to to have a healthy Anatomy yeah"
"what is that Insight that you mentioned"
"you acquired a few months ago"
"preliminary so so okay uh in the in the"
"name of uh you know throwing out uh kind"
"of new unproven ideas right so this is"
"you know this this is this is just my my"
"conjecture we've we've done some we've"
"done some computational modeling of it"
"which which I initially this was a um a"
"very uh clever student that I work with"
"named lakshman who I did did some models"
"with me and uh uh I initially thought it"
"was a bug and then I realized that no"
"actually this is this is this is the"
"feature the idea is this imagine so so"
"we've been working for a long a long"
"time on a concept of"
"um competency among embryonic parts and"
"what this means is basically the idea"
"that uh there are there are um"
"homeostatic feedback loops among various"
"cells and tissues and organs that"
"attempt to reach specific outcomes in"
"anatomical amorphous space despite"
"various perturbations so the idea is"
"that if you have a tadpole and you do"
"something to it whether by a mutation or"
"by a drug or something you do something"
"to it where the eye is a little"
"off-kilter or the mouth is a little off"
"all of these organs pretty much know"
"where they're supposed to be they will"
"try to minimize distance from other um"
"landmarks and they will Remodel and"
"eventually you get a normal frog so that"
"so that they will they will sort of"
"um a a recover the correct uh Anatomy"
"despite starting off in the wrong"
"position or even things like changes in"
"the number of cells or the size of cells"
"they're really good at getting their job"
"done despite various changes right so"
"okay so they have these competencies to"
"optimize specific uh things like like"
"their position and structure and things"
"like that"
"so uh so so that's so that's competency"
"now now here's here's the interesting"
thing
"imagine that you have a species that uh"
"has some some degree of that competency"
"and so you've got an individual of that"
"species comes up for selection uh"
"Fitness is high looks pretty good but"
"here's the problem selection doesn't"
"know whether the fitness is high because"
"his genome was amazing or the fitness is"
"high because the genome was actually so"
"so but the competency sort of made up"
"for it and now everything kind of got"
"back to where it needs to go so what the"
"competency apparently does is Shield"
"information from Evolution about the"
"actual genome it makes it harder to pick"
"the best genomes because you're"
"individuals that perform well don't"
"necessarily have the best genomes what"
"they do have is competency so what"
"happens and what happens in our"
"simulations is that when if you start"
"off with even a little bit of that"
"competency Evolution loses some power in"
"selecting the best genomes but it but"
"but where all the work tends to happen"
"is increasing the competency"
"so then the competency goes up so the"
"cells are even better at and the tissues"
"are even better at getting the job done"
"despite the bad genome that makes it"
"even worse that that that that that that"
"makes it even harder for for evolution"
"to see the best genomes which relieves"
"some of the pressure on having a good"
"genome but it basically puts all the"
"pressure on being really competent so"
"you've got this so so basically what"
"happens is that uh the the the genetic"
"fitness basically levels out at a really"
"sub-optimal level and in fact the"
"pressure is off of it so so it's"
"tolerant all kinds of craziness but the"
"competency and the mechanisms of"
"Competency get get pushed up really high"
"so in many animals and but there are"
"other factors that sort of push against"
"this ratchet but it becomes it becomes a"
"positive feedback loop it becomes a"
"ratchet for Optimal Performance despite"
"a sub-optimal genome and so in some"
"animals this sort of evens out at a"
"particular point but I think what"
"happened in planaria is that this whole"
"process ran away to its ultimate"
"conclusion the ultimate conclusion is"
"the competency algorithm became so good"
"that basically whatever the genome is"
"it's really good at creating and"
"maintaining a proper worm because it is"
"already being evolved in the presence of"
"a genome whose quality we cannot control"
"so so in computer science speak it's"
"kind of like um and Steve Frank put me"
"onto this analogy it's kind of like what"
"happens in raid arrays when you have a"
"nice raid array where the software makes"
"sure that you don't lose any data the"
"pressure is off to have really uh really"
"high quality media and so now you can"
"tolerate you can tolerate media with"
"lots of mistakes because because the"
"software takes care of it in the in the"
"raid and the on the architecture takes"
"care of it so so basically what happens"
"is you've got this animal where that uh"
"that runaway uh feedback loop went went"
"so far that the algorithm is amazing and"
"it's been it's been uh evolved"
"specifically for the ability to do what"
"it needs to do even though the hardware"
"is kind of crap and and it's it's"
"incredibly tolerant so this has a number"
"of implications that that to my"
"knowledge have never been explained"
"before for example in every kind every"
"other kind of animal you can you can"
"call a stock Center and you can get"
"mutants so you can get mice with with"
"kinky kind of Kink tails you can get"
"flies with red eyes and you can get uh"
"chickens without toes and you can get"
"you know humans come with that it has"
"various you know albinos and things you"
"can you can there's there's always"
"mutants that you can get uh planaria"
"there are no there are no abnormal lines"
"of planaria anywhere except for the only"
"exception is our two-headed line and"
"that that one's not genetic that one's"
"that one's bioelectric so so isn't it"
"amazing that that that nobody has been"
"able despite despite a hundred and you"
"know I don't know 120 years of"
"experiments with planaria nobody has"
"isolated a uh a line of planaria that is"
"anything other than a perfect planarian"
"I think this is why I think it's because"
"they have been actually selected for"
"being able to do what they need to do"
"despite the fact that there the the"
"hardware is just very junky and so so"
"that's my that's my current that's my"
"current current take on it and and and"
"really uh it puts more kind of more"
"emphasis on on on the algorithm and the"
"decision making among that cellular"
"Collective of what what you know what"
"are we going to build and what's the"
"algorithm for for making sure that we're"
"all working to build the correct thing"
"so if you translate this idea into"
"computer science a way to look at it is"
"imagine that you find some computers"
"that have"
"um artists that are very very noisy and"
"where the heart is basically makes lots"
"and lots of mistakes in encoding things"
"and bits often flip and so on and you"
"will find that these computers still"
"work and they work on pretty much the"
"same way as the other computers that you"
"have and there is an orthodox sect of"
"computer scientists that thinks uh it is"
"necessary that uh the every bit on the"
"hard disk is completely reliable or"
"reliable to such a degree that you only"
"have a mistake once every 100 trillion"
"copies and you can have an error"
"correction quote running on the hard"
"disk at the low level that corrects this"
"and after some point it doesn't become"
"efficient anymore so you need to have"
"reliable hard disks to be able to have"
"computers that work like this but uh how"
"would these other computers work and it"
"basically means that you create a"
"virtual structure on top of the noisy"
"structure that is correcting for"
"whatever degree of um uncertainty you"
"have or the degree of Randomness that"
"gets injected into your substrate David"
"Dave Eckley has a very nice metaphor for"
"this you know maybe yeah yeah he's a I"
"think a beautiful artist who explores"
"complexity by tinkering with"
"computational models I really find this"
"work very inspiring and he has this idea"
"of best effort Computing so in his view"
"our own nervous system is a best effort"
"computer it's one that does not rely on"
"the other neurons around you working"
"perfectly uh but make an effort to be"
"better than random and then you stack"
"the improbabilities empirically by"
"having a system that evolves to measure"
"in effect the unreliability of its"
"components and then stack the"
"probabilities until you get the system"
"to be deterministic enough to do what"
"you're doing with what to do with it"
"right so you uh if you have a system"
"that is as in a planaria inherently very"
"noisy where the genome is an unreliable"
"witness of what should be done and the"
"body you just need to interpret it in a"
"way that Stacks the probabilities that"
"is evaluating things with much more"
"error tolerance and maybe this is always"
"the case maybe there is a Continuum"
"um maybe not it's also possible that"
"there is some kind of phase shift where"
"your switch from organisms with reliable"
"genomes to organisms with noisy genomes"
"and you would basically use a completely"
"different way to construct the organism"
"as a result but it's a it's a very"
"interesting hypothesis then to see if if"
"this is a radical thing or a gradual"
"thing that happens on all organisms to"
"some degree yeah what I also like about"
"this uh description that you give about"
"how the organism emerges it maps on in"
"some sense also in how perception Works"
"in in our own mind at the moment measure"
"learning is mostly focused on"
"recognizing images"
"so our individual frames and the you"
"feed in information frame by frame and"
"the information is relatively"
"disconnected from a system like Delhi 2"
"is trained by giving it several hundreds"
"of millions of images"
"and they are disconnected the they're"
"not adjacent images in the space of"
"images and a baby could not probably"
"learn from giving 600 million images in"
"a dark room and only looking at this"
"introduce the structure of the world"
"from this whereas Delhi can which gives"
"Testament to the power of our"
"statistical methods and Hardware that we"
"have that far surpasses I think the"
"combined power and valuability of brains"
"which probably would not be able to"
"integrate so much information over such"
"a big distance"
"for us the world is learnable because"
"it's adjacent frames are correlated"
"basically information gets preserved in"
"the world so time and we only need to"
"learn the way in which the information"
"gets transmogorified"
"and these transformifications of"
"information means that we have a dynamic"
"World in which the static image is an"
"exception the identity function is a"
"special case of how the universe changes"
"and we mostly learn change we just got"
"visited by my cat and my cat has"
"difficulty to recognize static objects"
"compared to moving objects where it's"
"much much easier to see a moving ball"
"than a ball that is laying still yeah"
"and it's because it's much easier to"
"segment it out the environment when it"
"moves right so the task of learning on a"
"moving environmental Dynamic environment"
"is much easier because it imposes"
"constraints on the world and so how do"
"we represent a moving world compared to"
"a static well the semantics of features"
"changes and the uh an object is"
"basically composed of features that are"
"there can be objects themselves and the"
"scene is the decomposition of all the"
"features that we see into a complete set"
"of objects that explain the entirety of"
"the scene and the interaction between"
"them and causality is the interaction"
"between objects right and in a static"
"image these objects don't do anything"
"they don't interact with each other they"
"just stand in some kind of relationship"
"that you need to infer which is super"
"difficult because you only have this"
"static snapshot and so the features are"
"classifiers that tell you how to whether"
"a feature is a hand or a foot or a pen"
"or a Sun or a flashlight or whatever and"
"how they relate to the larger scene in"
"which again you have a static"
"relationship in which you need to"
"classify the objects based on the"
"features that contribute to them and you"
"need to find some kind of description"
"where you interpret the features which"
"are usually ambiguous and could be many"
"different things depending on the"
"context which you interpret them into"
"one optimal Global configuration right"
"but if scene is moving this changes a"
"little bit what happens now is that the"
"features become operators they're no"
"longer classifiers that tell you how"
"your internal State needs to change how"
"your world needs to change or your"
"simulation of the universe in your mind"
"needs to change to track the sensory"
"patterns right so a feature now is an"
"change operator a transformation"
"and uh the feature is in some sense a"
"controller that tells you how the bits"
"are moving and in your local model of"
"the universe and they are organized in a"
"hierarchy of controllers"
"and these controllers need to be turned"
"on and off at the level of the scene and"
"they have a lot of flexibility once you"
"have them they can move around in the"
"scene they're basically no"
"self-organizing self-stabilizing"
"entities in the same way as the mouse is"
"moving around in your organism a feature"
"can move around in the organism and"
"shift itself around to communicate with"
"other features until they negotiate a"
"valid interpretation of reality"
"that's that's incredibly interesting"
"because I you know as soon as you"
"started saying that uh I was starting to"
"think that the the virtualization that"
"enables right so the earlier part of"
"which we're saying the virtualization of"
um
"uh the the information that allows you"
to
"um deal with with unreliable hardware"
"and everything the the bioelectric uh"
"circuits that we deal with are a great"
"candidate for that because actually we"
"see exactly that we see a bioelectric"
"pattern that is very resistant to"
"changes in the details and make sure"
"that everybody does the right thing"
"under a wide range of you know different"
"defects and so on but but but even more"
"than that the other thing that what you"
"were just um emphasizing this the fact"
"that we learned the Delta right and that"
"and that we're looking for change very"
"interesting if you if you pivot the"
"whole thing from the temporal domain to"
"the spatial domain so so in development"
"what we we when we look at these"
"bioelectric patterns now now these"
"patterns are across space not across"
"time so so on like a neuroscience where"
"everything is kind of in the temporal"
"domain for neurons these things these"
"are voltage static voltage patterns"
"across tissue right across the whole"
"thing so for the longest time you know"
"we asked this question how are these"
"read out what how do cells actually read"
"these because because one possibility"
"early this was a very early hypothesis"
"you know 20 years ago was that maybe the"
"local voltage tells every cell what to"
"be so it's like a paint by numbers kind"
"of thing and every and and each voltage"
"you know each voltage value corresponds"
"to some kind of outcome that turned out"
"to be false what we did find is that"
"there and we have computational models"
"of how this works now"
"um what is read out is the Delta the"
"difference between regions it doesn't"
"care nobody cares about what the"
"absolute voltage is what what what is"
"read out in terms of outcomes for for"
"Downstream cell Behavior gene expression"
"all that what is actually right out is"
"the voltage difference between two"
"adjacent domains so that is exactly"
"actually what it's doing just in a"
"spatial domain it it only keys off of"
"the Delta and what is in what is learned"
"from that is um exactly just as as you"
"as you were saying it modifies uh the"
"controller for for what's Downstream of"
"that and there may be multiple ones that"
"are sort of moving around in Cohen"
"having I mean it's a very it's a very"
compelling
"um picture actually and way to look at"
"some of the some of the simulations that"
"that we've been doing about how the"
"bioelectric data are interpreted by the"
"rest of the cells you know it's very"
"interesting could we take a couple of"
"couple minute break yeah sure I'll get a"
"new coffee all right"
"speaking of coffee a brief note from our"
sponsor
"coffee helps me work it helps me fast"
"from carbs it's become one of the best"
"parts of my day consistently that's why"
"I'm delighted that we're collaborating"
"with Trade coffee they partner with top"
"independent Roasters to Freshly roast"
"and send the finest coffee in the"
"country directly to your home on your"
"preferred schedule this matters to me as"
"I work from home their team of experts"
"do all the work testing hundreds of"
"disparate coffees to land on a final"
"curated collection of 450 exceptional"
"coffees I chose these three and the team"
"at Trade coffee worked to create a"
"special lineup for theories of"
"everything for the tow audience based on"
"some questions they asked me such as how"
"much caffeine do I enjoy and what's the"
"bitterness ratio Etc you can get that"
"line up or if that's not let's say your"
"cup of coffee then you can take your own"
"quiz on their website to find a set that"
"matches your specific profile if you'd"
"like to support small businesses and"
"Brew the best cup of coffee you've ever"
"made at home then it's time to try Trade"
"coffee right now trade is offering our"
"listeners thirty dollars off your first"
"order plus free shipping at"
"drinktrade.com everything that's"
"drinktrade.com everything for thirty"
"dollars off so Professor Levin use the"
"word competence earlier and I'd like you"
"to Define that"
yeah
um
"I in order to Define it uh I I want to"
"put out two two concepts to this one one"
"idea is that to me and this goes back to"
"what we were talking about before is the"
"engineering stance on things I"
"think that useful cognitive claims such"
"as something you know when you say this"
"system has whatever or it can whatever"
"right as far as various types of"
"cognitive capacities I think those kind"
"of claims are really engineering uh"
"claims that is when you tell me that"
"something is competent at a particular"
"level maybe right so so you can think"
"about like like wiener and rosenberg's"
"scale of"
"cognition that goes from simple um you"
"know simple passive materials and then"
"reflexes and then all the way up to kind"
"of second order metacognition and all"
"that when you tell me that something is"
"on that ladder and where it is what"
"you're really telling me is if I want to"
"predict Its Behavior or I want to use it"
"in an engineering context or I want to"
"interact with it or relate to it in some"
"way this is what I can expect so right"
"so that's what you really telling me so"
"all of these terms what they really are"
"are engineering protocols so if you tell"
"me that something has the capacity to do"
"um a associate of learning or or"
"whatever what you're telling me is that"
"hey you can do something more with this"
"than you could with a mechanical clock"
"you can provide certain types of uh"
"stimuli or experiences and you can"
"expect that to do this or that"
"afterwards or if you tell me that"
"something is a um a homeous you know a"
"homeostat that means that hey I can"
"count on it to keep some variable in at"
"a particular range without having to be"
"there myself to control it all the way"
"it has a certain autonomy now how much"
"right and if you tell me that something"
"is really intelligent and it can do XYZ"
"then I know that okay you're telling me"
"that it has even more autonomous"
"behavior in certain contexts so so all"
"of these terms to me what they really"
"are they're not and that has an"
"important implication the implication is"
"that they're Observer dependent that"
"that that that you you've picked some"
"kind of problem space you've picked uh"
"some kind of perspective and from that"
"problem problem space in that"
"perspective you're telling me that with"
"with sort of given certain goal States"
"this system has that much competency to"
"pursue those gold States and different"
"observers can have different views on"
"this for any given system so for example"
"somebody might look at a brain like"
"let's say a human brain and say well I'm"
"pretty sure the only thing this is this"
"is a paperweight so it's really pretty"
"much just competent in going down"
"gravitational gradient so all I can do"
"is hold down paper that's it and"
"somebody else will look at and say ah"
"you missed the whole point you missed"
"the whole point this thing is"
"competencies in behavioral space and"
"linguistic space right so these are all"
"um empirically testable uh engineering"
"claims about what you can expect the"
"system to do so when I say competency"
"what I mean is we specify a space a"
"problem space and at the time when we"
"were talking about this the problem"
"space that I was talking about was the"
"the anatomical morphe space that was the"
"space we were talking about so so the"
"space of possible anatomical"
"configurations and specifically"
"navigating that morph of space so you"
"start off as an egg or you start off as"
"a damaged limb or whatever and you"
"navigate that morphe space into the"
"correct structure so so when I say"
"competency I mean you have the ability"
"to deploy certain kinds of tricks to"
"navigate that amorphous space with some"
"level of uh performance that I can count"
"on and so the competency might be really"
"low or it might be really high then I"
"would have to make specific claims about"
"what I mean here's an example of a"
"compound and there are many you know if"
"you just think about the Behavioral"
"Science of navigation there are many"
"competencies you can think about does it"
"you know does it does it know ahead of"
"time where it's going does it have a"
"memory of where it's been or is it a"
"very simple you know sort of reflex arc"
"is all it has or um here's one one"
"example of a pretty cool competency that"
"um that that a lot of biological systems"
have
"if we take some cells that are in the"
"tail of a tadpole and we"
"give them a particular we we modify"
"their ion channels uh with such that"
"they now acquire"
"um a a the goal of navigating to an eye"
"fate in more in in this morphe space"
"meaning that they're going to make an"
"eye these things in fact will create an"
"eye and they'll make an eye in the tail"
"on the gut wherever you want but one of"
"the cool and so that's already pretty"
"pretty cool but but one of the amazing"
"aspects is if I only modify a few cells"
"not enough to make an actual eye just"
"just a handful of cells and we've done"
"this and you can see this work"
"one of the competencies they have is to"
"recruit local neighbors that were"
"themselves not in any way manipulated to"
"help them achieve that goal it's a"
"little bit like in an ant colony right"
"there's a there's this idea of"
"Recruitment and ants and termites is an"
"idea of recruitment where where"
"individuals can can recruit others and"
"you know talk about a flexible"
"collective intelligence this is it this"
"is they they you you've re-specified the"
"goal for that set of cells but one of"
"the things that they do without us"
"telling them how to do it or having to"
"micromanage it they already have the"
"competency to recruit as many cells as"
"they need to get the job done so that's"
"a very nice for an engineer that's a"
"very nice competency because it means"
"that I don't need to worry about taking"
"care of getting exactly the right number"
"of cells if I'm if I'm a little bit over"
"that's fine if I'm way under also fine"
"the system has that competency of"
"recruiting other cells to get the job"
"done so so that's what I so that's what"
"I meant so to me to make an um any kind"
"of a cognitive claim you have to specify"
"the problem space you have to specify"
"the goal goal towards which it's"
"expressing competencies and that may"
"right and and then and then you can make"
"a claim about well how competent is it"
"to get to that goal and somebody I wish"
"I could remember who it was but somebody"
"made this really nice analogy about kind"
"of the ends of that spectrum they said"
"two magnets try to get together and"
"Romeo and Juliet try to get together but"
"the degree of flexible problem solving"
"that you can expect out of those two"
"systems is incredibly different and"
"within that range there are all kinds of"
"in-between systems that may be better or"
"worse and may deploy different kinds of"
"strategies you know can they avoid local"
"Optima can they have a memory of the"
"where they've been can they look further"
"than their local environment a million"
"different things so that's that's what I"
"meant by competency it's it's it's it's"
"a claim about what and what an engineer"
"can expect the system to do given a"
"particular problem space in a particular"
"goal that you think it's uh trying to"
reach
"so the way in which you use the word"
"competency could be treated as the"
"capacity of a system for adaptive"
control
"yeah yeah yeah"
"one uh issue that I have with the notion"
"of goals and goal directedness is that"
"sometimes you only have a tendency in a"
"system to go in a certain direction and"
"so it's it's directed but the goal is"
"something that can be emergent sometimes"
"it's not sometimes there is an explicit"
"representation in the system of a"
"discrete event that is associated or a"
"class of events this fulfilling a"
"certain condition that the system has"
"committed itself to and if you don't"
"have that you don't have a proper goal"
"but in real systems it's difficult to"
"say I mean when do we pursue goals right"
"sometimes we just are vaguely hungry are"
"moving towards the kitchen because we"
"hope that something will"
"opportunistically emerge that will deal"
"with this vague tendency in our Behavior"
"we could also say we have the goal of"
"finding food but uh that is a"
"rationalization that is maybe stretching"
"sick sometimes yeah so uh sometimes a"
"better distinction for me is"
"going from a simple controller to an"
"agent and I try to because we are very"
"good at discovering agency in the world"
"what does it actually mean when we"
"discover agency and when we discover our"
"own agency and start to amplify it"
um
"by making models of who we are and how"
"we deal with the world and with others"
"and so on the minimal definition of"
"agent that I found it's a controller for"
"future States"
"the thermostat doesn't have a goal by"
"itself right it just has a Target value"
"and a sensor that tells the deviation"
"from the target value and when that"
"exceeds a certain threshold the heating"
"is turned on and if it goes below a"
"certain threshold the heating is turned"
"off again and this is it so the"
"thermostat is not an age and it only"
"reacts to the present frame it's only a"
"reactive system"
"whereas an agent is proactive which"
"means that it's trying to um not just"
"minimize the current deviation from the"
"target value but the integral over at"
"the time span previously the future"
"deviation so it builds an expectation"
"about how uh an action is going to"
"change this trajectory of the universe"
"and over that trajectory it tries to"
"figure out some measure of how big the"
"compound Target deviation is going to be"
"and so as a result you get a branching"
"universe and the branches in this"
"universe some of these branches depend"
"on actions that are available to you and"
"that translate into decisions that you"
"can make that uh move you into more or"
"less preferable wealth States and"
"suddenly you have a system with emergent"
"beliefs desires and intentions but to"
"make that happen to move from a"
"controller to agency and agent has been"
"a controller with an integrated setpoint"
"generator and the ability to control"
"future states that requires that you can"
"make models that are counterfactual so"
"because the future universe doesn't"
"exist right now you need to create a"
"counterfactual universe The Future model"
"of the future Universe maybe even a"
"model of the past universe that allows"
"you to reason about possible for future"
"universes and so on and to make these"
"counter factual causal models of the"
"universe you need to have a turing"
machine
"so without a computer without something"
"that is too incomplete that insulates"
"you from the causal structure of your"
"substrate that allows you to build"
"representations regardless of what the"
"universe says right now around you right"
"you need to have that machine and the"
"simplest uh system in nature that has"
"turing machine integrated is the cell"
"so uh it's very difficult to find a"
"system in nature that is an agent that"
"is not made from cells as a result"
"maybe there are systems in nature that"
"are able to uh compute things and make"
"models but uh I I'm not aware of any so"
"the simplest one that I know that can do"
"this reliably is the cells or"
"arrangement of sets and that can possess"
"agency which is interesting thing that"
"explains this coincidence that living"
"things are agents and vice versa that"
"the agent that we discover are mostly"
"living things or there are robots that"
"have computers built into them or uh"
"virtual robots that have that rely on"
"computation so the ability to make"
"models of the future is the prerequisite"
"for agency and to make arbitrary models"
"which means structures that embody uh"
"causal uh simulations of some sort that"
"requires computation"
"yeah yeah um you know I'm on board with"
"that with that ladder of that that"
"taxonomy uh of of uh"
"of of goals and so on one one"
"interesting thing about uh about goals"
"and as you say some are emergent and and"
"some are not there's a there's an"
"interesting uh planarian"
"um uh version of this which is which is"
"this we"
"we made this hypothesis about so so with"
"implant area you chop it up into pieces"
"and every piece regenerates exactly the"
"right rest of the work right so if it's"
"if if you chop it into pieces each piece"
"will have one head one tail so and then"
"and then of course what happens is it"
"stops when it when it may when it"
"reaches a correct planarian then then it"
"stops and so so we started to think that"
"there are two there are a couple of"
"possibilities one possibility is that"
"this is a purely emergent process and"
"that the goal of rebuilding ahead is is"
"an emergent thing that comes about as a"
"consequence of other things or could"
"there be a an actual explicit"
"representation of what a correct"
"planarian is that serves as a set point"
"as an encoded as an explicitly encoded"
"set point for these cells to follow and"
"and because it's a cellular a collective"
"we're communicating electrically we"
"thought well maybe maybe what it's doing"
"is basically storing a memory of what"
"did you like you would in in a neural"
"circuit you're storing a memory of what"
"it should be so we started looking for"
"this and this is what we found and this"
"is this is kind of I think one type of"
"one one important type of goal in a in a"
"goal seeking system is is a is a goal"
"that you can rewrite without changing"
"the hardware and the system will now"
"pursue that goal instead of something"
"else in a purely emergent system that"
"doesn't work right if you have a"
"cellular automaton or a fractal or"
"something that that does some kind of"
"complex thing if you want to change what"
"that complex thing is you have to figure"
"out what the local rule how to change"
"the local rules that's very hard in most"
"cases but what we found in planaria is"
"that we can literally using a voltage"
"reporter die we can look at the worm and"
"we can see now the pattern the the and"
"it's a distributed pattern but we can"
"see the pattern that tells this animal"
"how many heads it's supposed to have and"
"what you can do is you can go in and"
"using a a brief transient uh"
"manipulation of the ion Channels with"
"drugs with ION channel drugs that and we"
"have a computational model that tells"
"you what those drugs should be that"
"bring briefly changes the electrical"
"state of the circuit but the circuit is"
"amazing it's it it once you've changed"
"that state it holds so so by default it"
"in a standard planarian it always says"
"one head but but it's kind of like a"
"flip-flop in that when you you"
"temporarily shift it it holds and you"
"can push it to a to a state that says"
"two heads so now something very"
"interesting happens"
"um two interesting things one is that if"
"you if you take those worms and you cut"
"those into pieces you get two-headed"
"worms even though the genetics are the"
"hardware is all wild type there's"
"nothing wrong with Hardware all the"
"proteins are the same all the genetics"
"is the same but the electric circuit now"
"says make two heads instead of one and"
"so this is in in an interesting way it"
"is an explicit goal because you can"
"rewrite it because much like with your"
"thermostat there's an interface for"
"changing what the goal state is and then"
"you don't even need to know how the rest"
"of the thermostat works as long as you"
"know how to use your how to modify that"
"interface the system takes care of the"
"rest the other interesting thing is and"
"and I love what you said about the"
"counter factuals what you can do is you"
"can change that electrical pattern in an"
"intact worm"
"and not cut it for a long time and if"
"you do that when you look at that"
"pattern that is a counter factual"
"pattern because that two-headed pattern"
"is not a readout of the current state it"
"says two heads but the animal only has"
"one head it's a normal planarian so the"
"that pattern memory is not a readout of"
"what the animal is doing right now it is"
"a representation of what the animal will"
"do in the future if it happens to get"
"injured and you may never cut it or you"
"may cut it but if you do then the"
"pattern becomes uh then the cells"
"consult a pattern and build a two-headed"
"worm and then it becomes a you know the"
"current state but until then it's this"
"weird like primitive"
"um uh it's a primitive counterfactual"
"system because it's able to a body of a"
"planarian is able to store at least two"
different
"representations of what probably many"
"more but we found two so far what a"
"correct planarian should look like it"
"can have a memory of a one-headed"
"planarian or a memory of a two-headed"
"planarian and and and both of those can"
"live in exactly the same Hardware in"
"exactly the same the same body the other"
"kind of cool thing about this and um"
"I'll just mention this even though this"
"is this is you know disclaimer this is"
"not published yet so this is uh you know"
"take all this with a grain of salt the"
"the but but the the latest thing you can"
"do is you can actually treat it with"
"some of the same compounds that are used"
"in uh Neuroscience in in humans and in"
"rats as memory blockers so so things"
"that block recall or or memory"
"consolidation and when you do that you"
"can make the animal forget how many"
"heads it's supposed to have and then"
"they basically turn into a featureless"
"circle when when you can just wipe you"
"can just wipe the the pattern memory"
"completely with it using exactly the"
"same techniques you would use in a in a"
"rat or a human they just forget what to"
"do when they turn into they fail to"
"break Symmetry and they just become a"
"Circle so yeah I I think I think what"
"you were saying is is right on with with"
"this this ability to uh store"
"counterfactual states that are not true"
"now but may represent"
"aspects of the of the future I think"
"that's that's a very important capacity"
"another important notion is a constraint"
"uh constraint satisfaction a constraint"
"is a rule that tells you uh whether two"
"things are compatible or not and the"
"constraint is satisfied if they're"
"compatible so you basically have a"
"number of conditions that you establish"
"by measuring that somehow for instance"
"uh whether you have a head or multiple"
"heads and you try to find a solution"
"where you can end up with exactly one"
"head and if you end up with exactly one"
"head based on the starting State then"
"you have managed to find a way to"
"satisfy your constraints and so in a"
"sense uh what you call a competency is"
"the ability of a system to take a region"
"of this of states of the space of the"
"universe some basically some local"
"region of possible state that the Euros"
"can be in and move that region to a"
"smaller region that is acceptable so the"
"basically there is a region on the"
"universe State space where you have only"
"one head"
"and there's a larger region where you"
"don't have any head at all but the"
"starting state of your organism and then"
"you try to get from A to B so you get"
"from this larger region to the one in"
"which you want to be of course if you"
"have one head you want to stay in the"
"region in which you have one head which"
"of course is usually much easier but the"
"ability basically to condense the space"
"to get to Bridge Over many regions into"
"the target region is what comes down to"
"this this is what this competency is the"
"system basically has an emergent wanting"
"to go in this region and it's trying to"
"move there and so there are constraints"
"on the level of the substrate"
"uh that are battling with the functional"
"constraints that the organism wants to"
"realize to fulfill its function and"
"sometimes uh you cannot satisfy this and"
"you end up with two heads because you"
"don't know which one you'll get rid of"
"or how to digest one of the heads and so"
"on and you end up with some Siamese twin"
"and uh so this this is an interesting"
"constraint that you have to solve for"
"when you are dealing with reality and"
"how you battle with the substrate until"
"you get to the functional solution that"
"you evolve for"
"yeah it's that's that's interesting I"
"mean we we've also found that there are"
"so so we look at exactly this uh the the"
"navigation this kind of navigation and"
"Morpher space how you get from here to"
"there and what paths are possible to get"
"from here to there and so on one of the"
"things that we found is that there are"
"regions of that space that belong to"
"other species and you can you can push a"
"a planarian with a standard wild type"
"genome into the goal state of a"
"completely different species so we can"
"get them to grow ahead so there's a"
"species that normally has a triangular"
"head you can make it grow a round head"
"like a like an like a different species"
"or or a flathead or whatever uh you can"
"so those are about 100 100 to 150"
"million years of evolutionary distance"
"and you can do it you know within within"
"a few days just by um by by perturbing"
"that electrical circuit so that it lands"
"in the wrong space and then outside of"
"that there are regions that don't belong"
"to planaria at all so planaria are"
"normally nice and flat we can make we've"
"made planarians that are they look like"
"a they are cylinder like like a ski cap"
"you know they become like a like a like"
"a hemisphere or really weird ones that"
"are spiky they're they're like a ball"
"with spikes on it they're all kinds of"
"other uh regions in that space that you"
"can that you can push them to uh and so"
"those are new those are not species that"
"they diverge from those are no one's"
"ever said to my knowledge that's yes"
"there's no such there are no such"
species
"um it's easier to you know and we've"
"done this in frog too you can you can"
"push tadpoles to make it to look like"
"those of other species"
"um or you can make you know I mean"
"that's a whole interesting thing for"
"evolution anyway right what one species"
"birth defect is a pretty is a perfectly"
"reasonable different species so we can"
"make we can make tadpoles with a rounded"
"tail which for a xenopus tadpole is a"
"terrible Tale But for zebrafish that's"
"exactly the right tale so you can sort"
"of Imagine imagine right Evolution uh"
"manipulating the different information"
"processing whether whether by the"
"bioelectrical circuits or other other"
"Machinery uh that help the system"
"explore that morphe space and you know"
"start to"
"uh this is start to start to move away"
"from from whatever the you know that"
"speciation is moving away from your"
"standard attractor that you usually land"
"on how does this relate to intelligence"
"well intelligence is the ability to make"
"models and and usually in the service of"
"control at least that's the way I would"
"uh explain intelligence"
"there are other definitions but it's the"
"simplest one that I found it also"
"accounts for the fact that many"
"intelligent people are not very good at"
"getting things done uh that's it's"
"basically an intelligence and goal"
"rationality are support orthogonal"
"and excessive intelligence is often a"
"prosthesis for bad regulation have you"
"read the intelligence trap"
"no okay the author makes a similar case"
"and he's coming on shortly essentially"
"saying that there are certain traps that"
"people with high IQs have that are not"
"beneficial for them as biological beings"
"they're mainly cognitive biases so for"
"instance it's extremely interesting so"
"let's just give one of the biases to say"
"you're either liberal biased or you're"
"conservative biased and then you were to"
"give a test where there's some data that"
"says that on the surface it shows that"
"the data shows that gun control prevents"
"gun violence well the Liberals are more"
"likely to say yes this data does show"
"that but if you're conservative you're"
"more likely to find oh actually the"
"subtleties in the data show that gun"
"control increases gun violence and then"
"they thought okay well let's just switch"
"this to make it such that The"
"Superficial data suggests that gun"
"control increases violence you need to"
"look at the data carefully to show that"
"it actually prevents violence well the"
"conservatives in that case would be more"
"quickly to say oh look the gun control"
"increases violence and the Liberals"
"would find the the loophole well that's"
"one of the reasons why I don't mind"
"interviewing people who are biased"
"because to me they're more able to find"
"a justification for something that that"
"may be true but I or and others are so"
"well we all have our own biases we're so"
"inclined in some other direction that we"
"just we're blind to it but anyway the"
"point is to affirm what you're saying"
"yosha okay so I know Michael has a hard"
"cut off at 2PM so I want to ask the"
"question for AGI that is artificial"
"general intelligence it seems as though"
"we're far away or that our current"
"methods of machine learning and what we"
"learn in Neuroscience or or what we"
"learn in computer science is something"
"that we're missing some paradigm shift"
"or we're missing some new techniques is"
"there something from Michael's work"
"Yoshi I'm asking you this and then"
"Michael please respond is there"
"something from Michael's work that you"
"think can be applied to the development"
"of AGI if such a creature mind can exist"
"because there are some arguments against"
"it so first of all I don't know how far"
"we are for the HEI it could be that the"
"existing private names are sufficient to"
"brute force it"
"but we don't know that yet right so"
"we're going to find out in the next few"
"months uh but it could also be that we"
"need to rewrite the stack to build"
"systems that work in real time that are"
"entangled with the environment that can"
"build uh shared representations with the"
"environment and uh that we need to"
"rewrite the stack and there are actually"
"a number of questions that I'd like to"
"ask Michael"
"um what uh I noticed that Michael is"
"wisely reluctant to use certain words"
"like Consciousness a lot and it's"
"because a lot of people are very"
"opinionated about what these concepts"
"mean and you first have to deal with"
"these opinions before you come down to"
"saying oh here I have the following"
"proposal for implementing reflexive"
"attention as a tool to form coherence"
"and a representation and this leads to"
"the same phenomena as what you call"
consciousness
"right so uh that is is a detailed"
"discussion maybe you don't want to have"
"that discussion in every Foreman rather"
"than uh that and then having this"
"discussion you may be looking at uh how"
"to create coherence using a reflexive"
"attention process that makes a real-time"
"model of what it's attending to and the"
"fact that it's attending to it so it"
"remains coherent but for itself so this"
"is a concrete thing but uh I wonder how"
"to implement this in a self-organized"
"fashion if the substrate that you have"
"are individual agents and there is a"
"similarity here between societies and"
"brains and social networks"
"that is uh if you have"
"self-interested agents in a way that try"
"to survive"
"and that get their rewards from other"
"agents that are similar to them"
structurally
"and and they have the capacity to learn"
"to some degree"
"and that capacity is sufficient so they"
"can in the aggregate learn arbitrary"
"programs arbitrary computable functions"
"and it's efficient enough so they can"
"Converge on the functions that they need"
"to to as a group reap rewards that apply"
"to the whole group because they have a"
"shared Destiny like the poor little"
"cells that are locked in the same skull"
"and they are all going to die together"
"if they up so they have to get"
"along they have to form an organization"
"that is Distributing rewards among each"
"other and this gives us a search space"
"for possible systems that can exist and"
"the search space is mostly given I think"
"by the minimal agent that is able to"
"learn how to distribute rewards"
efficiently
"while doing something useful using these"
"rewards to change how you do something"
"useful so you have an emerging form of"
"governance in these systems there's not"
"some centralized control that is imposed"
"on the system from the outside as an"
"existing machine learning approaches and"
"AI approaches but this is this only is"
"an emergent pattern in the interactions"
"between the individual small units small"
"reinforcement learning agents and this"
"control architecture leads to"
"hierarchical government it's not fully"
"decentralized in any way there are"
"centralized structures that distribute"
"rewards for instance via the"
"dopaminergic system and very centralized"
"top-down Manner and that's because every"
"regulation has an optimal layer where it"
"needs to take place some stuff needs to"
"be decided very high up some stuff needs"
"to be optimally regulated very low down"
"depending on the incentives game"
"theoretically a government is an agent"
"that imposes an offset on your payoff"
"metrics to make your Nash equilibrium"
"compatible with the globally best"
outcome
"right so to to do this you need to have"
"agents that are sensitive to rewards"
"it's super interesting to think about"
"these reward infrastructures Elon Musk"
"has bought Twitter I think because he"
"has realized that Twitter is the network"
"of among all the social networks that is"
"closest to a global brain"
"it's totally mind-blowing to realize"
"that he basically trades a bunch of"
"frothy stock for the opportunity to"
"become Pope pope of a religion that has"
"more active participants than"
"Catholicism even right daily"
"practitioning people who enter this"
"church and think together and it's a"
"thing that is completely incoherent at"
"this point almost and completely"
"incorrect the bubbles of sentience but"
"for the most part this thing is just"
"screeching at itself"
"and now the SD question can we fix the"
"incentives of Twitter to turn it into a"
"global brain"
"and a Elon Musk is global brain build he"
"believes that this is the case and"
"that's the experiment that he is trying"
"to do which makes me super excited right"
"this might fail is a very big chance"
"that it fails but there is also the"
"chance that we get the global brain that"
"we get emerging collective intelligence"
"it is working in real time using the"
"internet in a way that didn't exist"
"before so super fascinating thing that"
"might happen here and it's fascinating"
"that very few people are seeing this"
"that Elon Musk is crazy enough to to"
"spend 44 billion dollars on that"
"experiment just because he can and has"
"nothing else to do with things it's"
"meaningful to do it more meaningful than"
"having so much money in the bank right"
"so this makes me interested in this test"
"bed for rewards and this is something"
"that translates into the way in which"
"society is organized because social"
"media is not different from society not"
"separate from it problem of governing"
"social media is exactly the same thing"
"as governing a society you need a right"
"form of government you need a legal"
"system ultimately you need"
"representation and all these issues"
"right it's not just the moderation team"
"and the same thing is also true for the"
"brain what is the government of the"
"brain that emerges in what Gary Edelman"
"calls neural Darwinism among different"
"forms of organization in the mind until"
"you have a model of a self-organizing"
"agent that discovers that what it's"
"Computing is driving the behavior of an"
"agent in the real world and discovers a"
"first person perspective and so on how"
"does that work how can we get a system"
"that is looking for the right incentive"
"architecture and that is basically the"
"main topic where I I think that where"
"Michael's research is pointing from from"
"my perspective that is super interesting"
"we have this overlap between the looking"
"at cells and looking at the world and of"
"humans and animals and stuff in general"
"yeah yeah so super interesting um we so"
"so Chris fields and I are are working on"
"a model of of on a framework to"
"understand the the"
"where where"
"um Collective agents first come from"
"right oh well how Auto police is how do"
"they organize themselves and we've we've"
"we've we've got a model already about"
"this idea of of rewards and sells"
"rewarding other cells with with"
"neurotransmitters and things like this"
"to keep copies of themselves nearby"
"because they're the most predictable so"
"so this idea of reducing surprise well"
"what's the least surprising thing it's a"
"copy of yourself and so you can sort of"
"this with Chris calls it the Imperial"
"model of multicellularity but one thing"
"to really think about here is Imagine an"
"embryo this is a um an amniote embryo"
"let's say a human or or a bird or"
"something like that and what you have"
"there is you have a flat disk of fifty"
"to ten thousand fifty thousand cells and"
"when people look at it you say what is"
"that they say it's an embryo one one"
"embryo well the reason it's one embryo"
"is that under normal conditions what's"
"going to happen is that in this in this"
"disc one cell is symmetry breaking one"
"cell is going to decide that it's the"
"organizer it's going to do local"
"activation long range inhibition it's"
"going to tell all the other cells you're"
"not the organizer I'm the organizer and"
"as a result you get one special point"
"that uh begins uh the a process that's"
"going to walk through this amorphous"
"space and create a particular"
"large-scale structure with two eyes and"
"four legs and whatever else it's going"
"to have but here's the interesting thing"
"those cells that's not really one embryo"
"that's that's um a weird kind of"
"Freudian ocean of potentiality what I"
"mean by that is if you take and I did"
"this as a grad student you can take a"
"needle and you can put a little scratch"
"through that blastoderm put a little"
"scratch through it what will happen is"
"the cells on either side of that scratch"
"don't feel each other they don't hear"
"each other's signals so that symmetry"
"breaking process will happen twice once"
"on each end and then when it heals"
"together what you end up with is two"
"conjoined twins because because each"
"side organized an embryo and now you've"
"got two conjoined twins now many"
"interesting things happen there uh one"
"is that every cell is some other cells"
"in external environment so in order to"
"make an embryo you have to self-organize"
"A system that puts an arbitrary boundary"
"between itself and the outside world you"
"have to decide where do I end and the"
"world begins and it's not given to you"
"uh you know somehow um from outside for"
"a biological system every biological"
"system has to figure this out for itself"
"unlike modern robotics or whatever where"
"it's very clear here's where you are"
"here's where the world is these are your"
"reflectors these are your sensors here's"
"the boundary of the outside world living"
"things don't have any of that they have"
"to figure out all of this out from"
"scratch the benefit to being able to"
"figure it out from scratch having to"
"figure out from scratch is that you are"
"then compatible with all kinds of weird"
"initial conditions for example if I"
"separate you in half you can make two"
"you can make twins you don't you don't"
"have a failure you know a total failure"
"because now you have half the number of"
"cells you can make twins you can make"
"triplets but probably you know many more"
"than that so if you ask the question you"
"look at that um blasted room and you ask"
"how many individuals are there you"
"actually don't know it could be zero it"
"could be one it could be some small"
"number of individuals that process of"
"Auto releases has to happen and and and"
"here all the here are a number of things"
"that that are uniquely biological that"
"that I think relate to the kind of"
"flexibility plasticity uh that you need"
"for for for AGI in whatever space it"
"doesn't have to be the same space that"
"we work in but your your boundaries are"
"not set for you by an outside Creator"
"you have to figure out where your"
"boundaries are where is the outside"
"world so you make hypotheses about where"
"you end and where the world begins you"
"don't actually know what your structure"
"is kind of like Bond guards robots from"
"2006 where they didn't know their"
"structure and they had to make"
"hypotheses about well do I have wheels"
"do I have legs what do I have and then"
"make a model based on basically babbling"
"right like the way that babies babble so"
"so you have to figure out you have to"
"make a model of of where the boundary is"
"you have to make a model of what your"
"structure is you are energy limited"
"which most the most Ai and Robotics"
"nowadays are not when your energy and"
"time limited it means that you cannot"
"pay attention to everything you are"
"forced to coarse grain in some way and"
"lose a lot of information and compress"
"it down so you have to you have to"
"choose a lens a coarse graining lens on"
"the world and figure out how you're"
"going to represent things"
"um uh and and all of this has to and and"
"there are many more things that we could"
"talk about but all of these things are"
"self-constructions from the from the"
"very beginning and and then and then you"
"have to you have to uh you start to act"
"in various in various spaces which again"
"are not predefined for you you have to"
"solve problems that are metabolic"
"physiological anatomical maybe"
"behavioral if you have muscles"
"um but but nobody's telling nobody's"
"defining the space for you"
"um for example if you're a bacterium a"
"Chris field zupo points this out if"
"you're a bacterium and you're in some"
"sort of chemical gradient you want to"
"increase the amount of sugar in your"
"environment you could act in"
"three-dimensional Space by physically"
"swimming up the gradient or you can act"
"in transcriptional Space by turning on"
"other genes that are better at"
"converting whatever sugar happens to be"
"around and that solves your your"
"metabolic problem instead of right so"
"you have these hybrid problem spaces so"
"all of this I think what what"
"contributes in a strong sense to all the"
"things that that we were just talking"
"about is the fact that everything is in"
"in biology is self-constructed from the"
"beginning you can't rely on you don't"
"know ahead of time when you're a new"
"creature Born Into the world and we have"
"many I have many examples of of this"
"kind of stuff you don't know how many"
"cells you have how big your cells are"
"you can't count on any of the priors so"
"you have this like weird thing that"
"Evolution makes these these machines"
"that don't take the past history too"
"seriously it doesn't over train on them"
"it makes problem-solving machines that"
"use whatever Hardware you have this is"
"why we can make weird chimeras and and"
"and cyborgs and and you can mix things"
"and mix and match the biology in every"
"in every way with other living things or"
"with with non-living things because all"
"of this is interoperable because it does"
"not make assumptions about what you have"
"to have it tries to solve whatever"
"problem it's given it plays the hands"
"that it's dealt and um that that that"
"results in uh that assumption that you"
"cannot uh you cannot trust what you come"
"into the world with you cannot assume"
"that the hardware is what it is it gives"
"rise to a lot of that intelligence I"
"think and a lot of that plasticity so if"
"you translate this into necessary"
"insufficient conditions what seems to be"
"necessary for the emergence of general"
"intelligence in bunch of cells or units"
"is that basically each of them is a"
"small agent which means it's able to"
"behave with an expectation of minimizing"
"future Target value deviations so it"
"learns that the configurations"
"environment that signal anticipated"
"reward next thing these units need to be"
"not just agents that need to be"
"connected to each other"
"and they need to get their Rewards or"
"proxy rewards something that allows them"
"to anticipate whether the organism is"
"going to feed them in the future from"
"other units that also adaptive"
"so you need multiple message types and"
"the ability to recognize and send them"
"with a certain degree of reliability"
"uh what else do you need you need enough"
"of them of course"
"what what's not clear to me is how"
"deterministic do the units need to be"
"how much memory do they need to be or"
"which way how much State can they store"
"how much uh"
"how deep in time does the indeed"
"recollection need to go and how much"
"forward in time do they need to be able"
"to form expectations so basically how"
"large is this activation front that they"
"can or this or the shape of the"
"distribution that they can learn"
"and have to learn to make this whole"
"thing happen"
"and so basically the conditions that are"
"necessary are relatively simple"
"if you just wait for long enough and get"
"a search assistance to percolate I"
"imagine that the compound agency will at"
"some level emerge on the system just in"
"the competition of"
"um possibilities in the same way as"
"emerging agency has emerged on Twitter"
"in a way with"
"um devoke religion in a way that people"
"who are starting to shift around their"
"behavior to maximize likes and retweets"
"and there was no external reward that"
"was given on Twitter so as a result a"
"local structure emerged a local agency"
"that was Shifting the rewards by itself"
"an emerging causal structure that was in"
"some sense in Dawn what causation"
"going to organize groups of people into"
"a behavioral things it's really"
"interesting to look at better as"
"something like a mind at some level"
"right it's working slower but it would"
"probably be possible to make a"
"simulation of these Dynamics in a more"
"abstract way and to use this for"
"arbitrary problem solving"
"and so what would an experiment look"
"like in which we start with these"
"necessary conditions and narrow down the"
"sufficient conditions yeah"
"yeah yeah very very right on and that's"
"I mean yeah we're doing some of that"
"stuff uh some of that kind of modeling I"
"apologize I've got a I've got a um I've"
"gotta run here thank you both for coming"
"out for this I appreciate it thank you"
"so much and thank you for bringing us"
"together so a great great conversation I"
"really enjoyed it so yeah thank you"
"anyways I've enjoyed it very much thank"
"you thank you thank you so much thanks"
"Russia the podcast is now concluded"
"thank you for watching if you haven't"
"subscribed or clicked on that like"
"button now would be a great time to do"
"so as each subscribe and like helps"
"YouTube push this content to more people"
"also I recently found out that external"
"links count plenty toward the algorithm"
"which means that when you share on"
"Twitter on Facebook on Reddit"
"Etc it shows YouTube that people are"
"talking about this outside of YouTube"
"which in turn greatly AIDS the"
"Distribution on YouTube as well if you'd"
"like to support more conversations like"
"this then do consider visiting"
"theoriesofeverything.org again it's"
"support from the sponsors and you that"
"allow me to work on top full time you"
"get early access to ad-free audio"
"episodes there as well every dollar"
"helps far more than you may think either"
"way your viewership is generosity enough"
"thank you"
