"have they have some really amazing"
"examples of uh the control of aging in"
"their various"
"mammalian systems and mice and human"
"cells so on uh we are going to"
"look to see what the bioelectric"
"component that is how much of how much"
"of that control what happens to the"
"bioelectrics during aging can you use"
"the bioelectrics to try to reverse aging"
"hi everyone welcome to live longer world"
"a podcast where we unite to fight aging"
"and boost longevity"
"all resources and premium member"

livelongerworld.com
"now on to today's episode"
"i'm michael and welcome to the live"
"longer world podcast such a pleasure to"
"have you here today thank you very much"
"really pleasure to be here"
"thank you um very excited uh to talk to"
"you about your research today huge fan"
"of it and i want to start by reading out"
"a sentence from your website where you"
"say that"
"most of the interesting questions in"
"biology boil down to the control of"
"shape we all start life as a single cell"
"the egg which somehow self-assembles"
"into an incredibly complex organism"
"and the question of how it's able to"
"achieve its intended pattern or"
"morphology as you call it is the main"
"issue of developmental biology and i"
"think this is fascinating because what"
"you're saying is that"
"cells come together to form these"
"tissues and organs and entire complex"
organisms
"and a lot of your research focuses on"
"the fact that cells have this collective"
"intelligence that they use"
"to form entire organisms or"
"bioelectrical signals so i'll let you"
"explain what you mean by collective"
"intelligence or bioelectrical signals"
"sure well there's a couple of things"
"going on here with with the focus on"
"embryonic development one is if we just"
"sort of really practically think about"
biomedicine
"you can notice that"
"with the exception of infectious disease"
"almost all of the problems of medicine"
"would be solved"
"if we could tell cells what to do so if"
"we if we have the ability to determine"
"what it is that cells build together"
then
"you know a birth defect traumatic injury"
"cancer aging degenerative disease all of"
"this all of this could be could be"
"resolved because you could simply tell"
"the cells to build healthy new organs"
"right so it's so so so morphogenesis is"
"a really fundamental problem in biology"
"and medicine in particular"
"in terms of this question of how do"
"collectives of cells decide what they're"
"going to be what they're going to build"
"because it's clear that they can build"
"multiple things they normally build the"
"same you know default kinds of patterns"
"but but how do we understand that how do"
"we control that that's the first thing"
"the other sort of more more uh kind of"
"deeper more philosophical way to think"
"about it is that a lot of times people"
will
"look at themselves or other you know"
"other humans or even other"
"what so-called advanced animals"
"and they will say this you know i i am a"
"cognitive system i have true"
"beliefs memories cognition right"
preferences
"that there is just physics you know this"
"other thing whether it be some sort of"
"um you know ai that somebody built or a"
"synthetic you know construct or whatever"
"that's just physics that's just"
"mechanism but we all in our life made"
"that journey from just physics which was"
"a single cell with all the chemistry"
"that goes on there but very slowly step"
"by step with no magical you know light"
"flash of any kind when when cognition"
"you know sort of shows up we become this"
"this uh this this highly um"
"uh sentient uh being with a first person"
"perspective and so on so that process is"
"very slow and smooth and and we all"
"journey through that and so that that"
"helps us really uh think in an important"
"way about where"
"things come from such as cognition such"
"as memory preferences you know all these"
"all these issues so i think it's very"
"important to keep in mind where we come"
"from both evolutionarily and and"
developmentally
"i see so there are two points you"
"mentioned that one of course once we"
"understand how cells process this"
"information it can have important"
"implications for regeneration aging"
"cancer as you mentioned and we'll talk"
"about some of that and then the second"
"one super interesting from a"
"philosophical standpoint then"
"so is that i mean i guess is that a way"
"of saying we're maybe programmed and"
"once you figure out these electrical"
"signals um you can essentially create"
"these organisms with you know memory and"
"cognition or free will or consciousness"
"or what have you and i think you've"
"probably shown that maybe initially with"
"some of your experiments around xenobots"
"as well"
"yeah i think i think that's unavoidable"
"if in in in a modern scientific world"
view
"uh i think it is unavoidable and that"
"taking evolution seriously taking"
"developmental biology seriously"
"realizing that um all of these changes"
"are very slow and gradual i think uh it"
"is it is unavoidable to think that"
"the kinds of processes that give rise to"
"cognition memory and and so on in us and"
"you know in other animals are something"
that
"not only can arise through the processes"
"of evolution but of course can be"
"engineered as well there's nothing"
"really magical about evolution it's a"
"you know it's this kind of um"
"large scale hill climbing search through"
"the space of possible bodies which give"
"rise to possible minds and there's zero"
"uh reason why engineers couldn't do"
"better than a more or less randomly"
"guided uh you know process that that"
"basically just optimizes for biomass you"
"know it's not really optimizing for"
"intelligence or anything like that so"
"yeah i think i think it's absolutely"
"likely that we will be able to engineer"
"those things so that that raises many uh"
"important um responsibilities for us and"
"both ethically and scientifically to"
"understand really what we're doing uh"
"yeah and i think uh"
"it's it's it's you know programming we"
"can talk it separately about the issue"
"of programming but just in general uh"
"this this idea that there's a deep"
"continuity between things that we"
"consider to be just chemistry and"
"physics and things that we consider to"
"be cognitive systems there is no you"
"know sharp dividing line there it's a"
"very smooth continuum"
"fascinating so what you're saying is"
"that if i understand say yeah"
"bioelectrical signals i can create"
"another mic 11 just just like you maybe"
"things like you as similar intelligence"
"but i guess over"
"with your experiences that would evolve"
"as well"
"yeah i mean so let's go back to the way"
"where the bioelectrics comes into all of"
"this right um"
"we are all collective intelligences you"
"know people people often think of well"
"there's collective intelligence like"
"ants and and you know ants and"
"and termites and bees and things like"
"that and then there is"
"real intelligence like you know me i'm a"
"real intelligence in the sense that i"
"have a centralized i don't i don't feel"
"like a collection of things i feel like"
"a single unified and then obviously"
"there's all kinds of data and cognitive"
"science and psychology that says that's"
"you know mistaken in many ways but but"
"but the reality though is that we are"
"all collective intelligences in the"
"sense that we're all made of parts so"
"you and i are bags of neurons basically"
"and some other things um and the mystery"
"here of course is how is it that the"
"scaling right how is it that a"
"collection of individual cells which"
"themselves are cognitive agents they're"
"very competent in their local areas they"
"know how to solve problems that are"
"metabolic problems physiological and so"
on
"how do they uh"
"join together to form this new emergent"
"entity that knows things that none of"
"the individual pieces know they have"
"goals and preferences that the"
"individual parts are unable to to"
"comprehend and so on"
so
"that means that there has to be some"
"kind of mechanism that acts as a"
"it's a sort of uh cognitive glue it's a"
"it's something that will take individual"
"uh subunits and bind them together in a"
"way that they're not just a pile of"
"stuff that that in some way a new"
"capability of of following a much larger"
"goals of storing larger memories of"
"thinking about bigger things somehow"
"that has to happen now in the brain of"
"course we know how that happens at least"
"at least we know the piece is involved"
"we don't know most of the important"
"stuff but we know the pieces the pieces"
"it's an electrical network so basically"
"what evolution has discovered which is"
"that um"
"electrical networks among cells are an"
"excellent uh mechanism for"
"coordinating information across distance"
"for binding subunits into decision"
"making circuits for representing"
"information as memory all these kinds of"
"things you know bioelectricity is great"
"for that and so then it's very simple"
"you just ask yourself where did neurons"
"come from right neurons didn't just"
"appear this this magical trick that the"
"brain does doesn't you know didn't just"
"appear out of nowhere it basically just"
"speed optimized the things that cells"
"were doing long before neurons and"
"brains appeared so bioelectrics was"
"evolution discovered by electricity"
"around the time of bacterial biofilms"
already
"you know that far back already it was it"
"was it was so selectively advantageous"
"to uh to to exploit that type of physics"
"to coordinate information across space"
"in a multicellular kind of structure"
"so so this was uh now now one can ask"
"some other interesting questions there"
"too okay before"
"neurons and muscles appeared where you"
"could you know at that point you would"
"be thinking about behaviors you're going"
"to do in three-dimensional space what"
"did tissues"
"think about before there were brains so"
"right in in the early evolutionary"
"lineages when uh"
"the bodies were using which they still"
"are using um electrical circuits to"
"control anatomy"
"what information were they processing"
"and i think the answer is they were"
"navigating more for space morphospace is"
"simply the uh the space of all possible"
"anatomical configurations right so so so"
"there are areas of an amorphous space"
"belonging to a particular shape of the"
"face of a frog in the foot of a you know"
"of a chicken and all these things these"
"all these things are regions of"
"amorphous space and bodies navigate"
"morph of space the way that uh modern"
"animals navigate three-dimensional space"
"and you need an information processing"
"tool for that that's what bioelectricity"
does
"i see so it's typically assumed though"
"that you know dna is this information"
"processing tool and you say that no dna"
"is just this hardware in this"
"bioelectricity which is actually the"
"cellular collective intelligence or"
"information processing can you talk a"
"bit about that like how do we know that"
"this information does not come from the"
"dna sure um well"
"i'd like to take a step back and uh just"
"again make a kind of a more or less of a"
"philosophical point which is that um"
"what i'm not arguing is that there is"
"one correct way to look at this and that"
"mine is the correct way and that"
"everybody else is wrong i'm not saying"
"that what i'm saying is that there are"
"multiple basically every any kind of a"
"model you know there's a famous saying i"
"forget who said it but there's a famous"
"saying that says all models are wrong"
"but some are useful right and i think"
"that's very true"
"uh this question of"
"when we when we look at"
"when we look for"
"a controller when we look for"
"information when we look for a hardware"
"software all of these things are formal"
"models that we come up with that we try"
"to impose on the world and"
"you know my point is you impose them you"
"see how well that does for you and then"
"you you just decide okay that model is"
"good for these set of scenarios it's"
"maybe not so great for this other set of"
"scenarios okay so so what i'm going to"
"propose is that"
"there are biological questions in which"
"it makes perfect sense to look at the"
"dna as the source of your information so"
"if you want to know"
where
"the proteins in your cell come from and"
"what determines the various hardware"
"components that the cell has for sure"
"the genome is your source of information"
"that that's a very good um it's a very"
"good metaphor that served us very well"
"for many decades that's great"
"if you want to know"
"uh where large scale pattern comes from"
"and how collections of cells make"
"decisions about uh various anatomical"
"outcomes i'm going to argue that uh the"
"genome is insufficient and the reason"
"it's insufficient is"
"for the same reason that um if i if i"
"gave you"
a
"a device a computer that played chess"
"you know it's one of those chess playing"
"games i gave you a device that plays"
"chess and you said to me you know this"
"thing is really just a collection of"
"silicon and copper and things like that"
"i'm going to study those and in the end"
"i'm going to know everything there is to"
"know about this and i would say"
"in a certain sense that might be true"
"and if you had the age of the universe"
"to sort of manipulate every atom and"
"whatever you you might have some insight"
"into what's going on uh and maybe you"
"could even make some predictions about"
"what it's going to do but none of that"
"is practical in our lifetime also you"
"would be completely missing the most"
"important thing which is you would never"
"recover the rules of the game of chess"
"from this you would have no idea you"
"might be able to predict it you know"
"laplace's demon kind of thing you might"
"be able to predict what it's going to do"
"just by tracking the electrical fields"
"and magnetic fields but you would miss"
"the most exciting thing about this which"
"is that it's a it's a device with goals"
"it has goals in a really weird and"
"interesting space it has goals like"
"protect the king dominate the center of"
"the board you know get whatever whatever"
"it is that that you know chess players"
do
"you would be missing out on all of that"
so
"so what the dna now the thing with dna"
"is we can read genomes now we know that"
"that there is no direct encoding for"
"size shape none of that is in there the"
"only thing that's in the genomes are"
"protein sequences right now"
"at one point we didn't know that now of"
"course we know that"
"um and it's very easy to to come up with"
"examples here's here's an example"
"um in my lab we are making something we"
"call a frogolottle so frogalottle is uh"
"an embryo that's uh some percentage frog"
"cell some percentage embryo um axolotl"
"cells okay no now i now now here's the"
"thing um"
"baby uh axolotls have legs"
"frog tadpoles don't have legs"
"so you have the genome of the frog you"
"have the genome of the axolotl can you"
"tell me if frogolodls are going to have"
"legs or not"
"uh there's no model that would let you"
"just answer that question"
"right right if i have a planarian"
"flatworm with a flathead and one with a"
"round head and i mix the stem cells from"
"one and the other in a single animal and"
"i cut the head off what shape are we"
"going to get we we have all these great"
"papers in in science and nature about"
"the molecular the the genetic components"
"that uh control stem cell"
"differentiation that that's great but"
"there's not a single model based on any"
"of that stuff that will tell you what"
"head shape they're going to make because"
"because that is a different level of"
"question and it's it's it's like trying"
"to reason in neuroscience it's the"
"equivalent of trying to resolve"
"psychological issues at the level of"
"synaptic proteins you know occasionally"
"that might work but generally speaking"
"that doesn't work and so"
"uh so so we have many examples where"
"the most efficient"
"representation of what the system is"
"going to do in terms of what shape it's"
"going to regenerate whatever is is very"
well
"controlled and read from the electrical"
"information but it's very poorly"
"controlled and read from genetic"
"information and that's to me the only"
um
"marker or definition of what it means to"
"have to have an answer to that question"
"of where does information come from but"
"you know"
"philosophical answers uh you know things"
"like well i always like everything i"
"like all my explanations at the level of"
"biochemistry you know i want to be a"
"reductionist that"
"you know those philosophical kinds of"
"pronouncements are um to me a very"
"limited value what you really want is"
"here's here's my metaphor here's what it"
"enables me to do here are the"
"experiments the biomedical applications"
"here's what enables me to do let's see"
"yours let's see what yours allows us to"
"do and then we will know which one is"
"more or less useful in different"
circumstances
"that's a great point just working with"
"different models and see which one's"
"useful so on the point of um you know if"
"you combine"
"two different heads or uh"
"have you done any of those experiments"
"and have you shown what ends up"
happening
"we're we're in the pro excuse me we're"
"in the process of doing those"
experiments
"but i i"
"i don't want to focus on"
"the answer because the answer isn't the"
"point right it's not it's not it's not"
"the point where the fog a lot will have"
"legs there's an infinite number of"
"combinations that you can make in fact"
"there's an even more point which is"
"never mind the combinations if i just"
"give you a genome can you tell what the"
"shape is going to be now"
"you can cheat and compare that to a"
"different genome where you already know"
"what the shape is okay that's fine"
"comparative genomics you can do that"
"let's cheating what you really want to"
"do is be able to look at the genome and"
"say can i can i tell you what the what"
"the symmetry type the size the shape"
"regenerative capacity what is this thing"
"going to be we have almost zero ability"
"to do that and and it's not about the"
"outcome of specific experiments it's"
"really the question of"
"what is it what is it really that that"
"you're asking and what we're asking is"
"uh not questions about uh specifically"
"the hardware like which proteins do you"
"have dna is great for that"
"it's how do you make decisions in novel"
"circumstances we have lots of situations"
"and i can i can tell you about some"
"where cells and tissues are confronted"
with
"uh novel situations that they've never"
"seen before either during their own"
"lifetime or during evolution in fact"
"evolution never prepared them for that"
"specific circumstance"
"they're able to do problem solving and"
"what we see is that evolution doesn't in"
"fact provide solutions for specific"
"environments what it provides are"
"machines that are able to solve problems"
"in a range of environments very"
"interesting that plasticity and that"
"generalization is super super"
interesting
"and uh"
"those are the kinds of questions that we"
"really want to understand which is how"
"do they make decisions how do they"
"generalize how do they learn how do they"
"solve problems"
"none of that is uh usefully addressed at"
"the level of the the dna"
"or the proteins for that matter"
"right it almost sounds like it's um it's"
"related to say the theory of knowledge"
"or epistemology but from more of a"
"biochemistry or biophysical perspective"
"it is it is it's uh it's it's"
"i think that"
"um a lot of work gets done in this area"
"where people think that they're avoiding"
"philosophy and and i think the"
"independence of this you know when you"
"think you're avoiding philosophy that"
"just means you're doing very bad"
"philosophy meaning that you're you're"
"neglecting you know some really"
"important uh questions that you should"
"be you should be keeping track of and um"
"yeah i think epistemology uh goes into"
"it i think ontology goes into it when we"
"ask you know do we really believe"
"in the existence of you know some people"
"will say"
"i only believe in chemistry i'm a"
"reductionist i don't believe in in goals"
"i don't believe in purpose i don't"
"believe in uh you know any of these"
"large-scale things that we think about"
"of course"
"you know if somebody is a real"
"reductionist then they would really like"
"to be talking about quantum foam not not"
"you know not chemical gradients and so"
"on but um but but it gets to that"
"question what does it mean to believe in"
"the existence of something like that"
right
"yeah amazing okay so before we go into"
"maybe some of the applications of your"
"research i guess one last point is that"
"you mentioned that you know the goal"
"ultimately should that should be that we"
"can create this"
"anatomical compiler any sort of"
"electrical signal you give it it should"
"be able to create whatever shape you"
"want well to be clear the the anatomical"
"compiler is not just about"
"bioelectricity that it's it's a bit of a"
"different claim right i mean i happen to"
"think that bioelectricity is very"
"important but the anatomical compiler is"
"a much more general type of concept"
"okay maybe you can talk a bit about it"
"what is it then"
"the idea is that uh if if you sort of"
"ask somebody i sometimes ask the people"
"in my lab this when they join and i say"
"what what is that what is the end game"
"here like when can we all go home and"
"give up you know and consider that we're"
"done right so so because you have to i"
"think i think it's important to look"
"forward and to try to identify what is"
"your actual goal for these things i i"
"think the actual goal is the complete"
"control of structure"
"and function and thus function so"
basically
"any shape that you want to make and you"
"should you should be able to make and so"
"and so what does that look like in"
"practical terms well"
"you should be able to sit down in front"
"of a computer and you should be able to"
"draw the way we draw car parts and"
"various other things in cad you know"
"computer aided design you should"
"withdraw what you want but you're"
"drawing anatomy you're not drawing"
"molecular biology you don't know"
"anything about pathways you don't need"
"to you"
"when this field is mature somebody"
"should be able to sit down and say"
"i want"
"uh an organ i want a heart but one that"
"looks like this or i want or i want a"
"perfectly normal human eye or i want you"
"know i want a frog and i'd like it to"
"have six legs and i you know and"
"tentacles or whatever i'm making that up"
"but do you understand you should be able"
"to draw absolutely anything and then if"
"we knew what we were doing the system"
"would compile that description into a"
"set of stimuli that would have to be"
"given to cells to make them build it"
"whatever you drew now partly i'm sure"
"partly will be bioelectrical but partly"
"it won't and there will be chemical cues"
"there will be um biophysical cues i mean"
"there's evidence for ultra ultra weak"
"photon uh communication in the body"
"there's all kinds of other modalities"
"but the point is"
"that's what it should look like if if"
"this field were solved that's what the"
"solution would look like you should be"
"able to draw anything you want and and"
"out would come a set of instructions for"
"stimuli for that to here's what you do"
"to the cells to get them to to do this"
"fascinating almost sounds like science"
"fiction to me"
"yeah well it's science fiction i mean"
"the job of science fiction is to"
"uh imagine what the science should look"
"like going forward right from that"
"perspective sure it's science fiction i"
"think yeah you know there's a difference"
between
"i i love science fiction i've heard a"
"lot of science fiction there's a"
"difference between"
"things that are"
"actually impossible"
"and then right and then and there are"
"many reasons why things might be"
"impossible and then there are things"
"that are purely uh limited by existing"
"resources existing uh concepts"
"imagination this is squarely in that"
"camp there is nothing impossible about"
"this we we know that uh"
"you know something something as with"
"with the limited foresight of of natural"
"evolution is able to produce these"
"amazing bodies can you imagine what we"
"could do rationally if we knew what we"
"were doing i mean that's yeah"
"that's definitely fiction so i i'm"
"curious then is this um"
"is this relatively new then have people"
"been working on it maybe for a long time"
"and they just didn't have breakthroughs"
"or was there a limit to imagination"
"specifically the the um"
"the uh the compiler are you talking"
about
"the compiler or just uh talking about"
"you know collective intelligence of"
"cells and how they process information"
yeah
"well um okay uh let's look at it this"
"way the question of how single cells"
become
adults
"has been around since the time of"
"aristotle and probably before that so so"
"the interest in that question is very"
"very old"
"developmental biology is probably can"
"probably be traced back to the 1700s"
"something like that"
"um and scientists have been trying to"
"study this process ever since so for"
"sure this is a very old question"
now
"what's what's new here is"
"this idea that"
uh
"the using using an interdisciplinary"
"approach where you take things from"
"physics from computer science from"
"cognitive science and you use them to"
"apply to developmental biology it's"
"it's new and it's not new it's it's new"
"because because the trend over the last"
"60 to 80 years"
"has been avoiding all of that stuff and"
"really developing something very focused"
"on molecular genetics biochemistry right"
"that's been the approach it's been"
"considered inappropriate to use tools"
"from other fields like cognitive science"
"you know you know you're not supposed to"
"be thinking about software because"
"because or or things like goal"
"directedness or learning in these"
"systems because"
"people you know so biologists are really"
"kind of terrified about this is a kind"
"of teleophobia that operates here where"
"as soon as you start thinking about"
"goals and software and things like that"
"the danger is that somebody's going to"
"slip into well if there's an algorithm"
"somebody must have written it and then"
"then you know and then there's some sort"
"of you know semi-religious you know"
"thing and biologists really hate that"
"and so and so you you know they try to"
"be uh intentionally mind blind you know"
"there's this there's this mind blindness"
"that exists where people can't"
"you can't have a theory of mind about"
"others and they you know they see"
"everything as a mechanism so scientists"
"are intentionally kind of mind-blowing"
"in that way it's"
"newish because it's been that way it's"
"just starting to crack that that"
"paradigm is just starting to crack now"
"on the other hand if you look back to"
"the classical workers in this field"
"all of this has been said before so uh"
"what you know the forefathers of"
"developmental biology uh i think it was"
"i think was um it was it was drish"
"probably who said that uh"
"you know"
"the question of the question of"
"cognition and the question of"
"development are the same question"
"anything that is profoundly important"
"and interesting and true and it's been"
"ignored for for many many decades so so"
"it's new and it's not new and uh"
"conceptually i think people have seen"
"this a long time ago though you know"
"really brilliant minds have seen this a"
"long time ago"
"uh however what's what's also really new"
"here is that now we know a lot more"
"about now there is a science of"
"collective behavior there is a science"
"of complexity there is uh you know there"
"is a computer science which didn't exist"
"before isn't it amazing that um you know"
"alan turing right who many people"
"consider the forefather of computer"
science
"he was interested in in intelligence and"
"he also"
"wrote some of the first papers on"
"mathematical modeling of morphogenesis"
"you know he was touring patterns right"
"he had this this incredible uh paper"
"about um how order arises in biology and"
"touring panels you ask yourself why"
"would someone why why would he be"
"interested in this why if you're into ai"
"and computers especially you know in the"
"30s and 40s where"
"there was no you know there wasn't"
"really any computational biology or"
"synthetic violence or anything like that"
"why would you be interested in both of"
"those things"
"because there is a profound symmetry"
"here and and i think uh i think if he"
"had lived we would have seen way this"
"field would be way further along"
"well i'm very glad you're okay on it"
"very interesting work"
"so i want to talk about some of the"
"applications so it's more concrete for"
"people um you talk about you know some"
"of the applications being in"
"regenerative medicine or potentially"
"seeing cancer as a morphogenetic code uh"
"maybe first the issue of regenerative"
"medicine um if you could perhaps you"
"know explain using some of your"
"experiments uh with flat worms or"
"tadpoles or whatever you think is"
"easiest to explain it"
"yeah so so there are three broad"
"areas of application of our work uh in"
"in medicine uh birth defects"
"regenerative repair and uh and cancer so"
"let's okay let's let's start with the"
regeneration
"the basic the basic issue is that uh all"
"of your body organs were created at one"
"point they were they were made by cells"
"that information is still there so if"
"somebody's injured and they lose an"
"organ for whatever reason"
"presumably the information on how to"
"build it is still there so the trick is"
"then to"
"uh convince the cells to do it again to"
"rebuild it and so how would you convince"
"them to rebuild it well you might start"
"thinking about well how did they know to"
"build it in the first place and if the"
"answer to that is uh there's a"
bioelectrical
"kind of pattern memory that helps them"
"understand what to build maybe you can"
"reactivate that again so we have a lot"
"of work for example in in planaria"
"what we've done is we've said okay uh"
"the amazing thing about planaria is that"
"you can you can chop them into pieces"
"and every piece knows exactly what's"
"missing and regrows exactly the right"
"parts right so if you chop a plenarian"
"into thirds that middle trunk fragment"
"will grow ahead at one end and a tail at"
"the other end so things like um you know"
"questions about um how many heads are"
"you supposed to have where does the head"
"go where does the tail go uh those those"
"questions are easily"
"easily resolved by by the pieces in fact"
"in fact the record is something like 275"
"pieces right do so so it can be it can"
"be actually very very tiny pieces"
"so uh so what we did was we simply"
"looked uh at the bioelectric we used the"
"voltage reporting fluorescent dye"
and
"we simply looked at those pieces to ask"
"what does the bioelectrics look like and"
"we saw an amazing thing that there's a"
"pattern that you can literally read out"
that
"looks like"
"what a normal worm should look like now"
"the thing the thing with regeneration"
"animals that can regenerate they they uh"
"the most amazing thing about"
"regeneration is is not that they rebuild"
"these organs the most amazing thing is"
"that they stop"
"that's really"
"because once you injure them or you cut"
"off let's say you cut off the the limb"
"of a salamander something like that it"
"will keep regenerating"
"until a correct salamander limb or a"
"correct planarian is formed and then"
"they stop well how do they know when to"
"stop so if they know when to stop there"
"has to be some sort of internal process"
"that says"
"the error or to the error hasn't been"
"reduced to the point where you are now"
"correct and you can you correct enough"
"and you can stop so there's basically"
"this like homeostatic process and i call"
"this anatomical homeostasis where"
"much like a thermostat that basically"
"will act to reduce the error from a"
"certain set point"
"the body will will act in terms of all"
"kinds of cell behaviors to"
"uh reduce the error"
"of of the anatomy now the thing about"
"those kind of processes those"
"homeostatic processes is that they have"
"to store a set point somewhere you have"
"to you have to record well what am i"
"trying to reach right what's the"
"information in this in the thermostat"
"it's very simple there are two numbers"
"it's your it's your temperature range in"
"regeneration it has to be more complex"
"you have to store some level of"
"this of of like a coarse grained"
"description of the anatomy that so that"
"you know when it's right and when it's"
wrong
so
"we have this idea that this is a"
"hypothesis that that that i made you"
"know many years ago which is that"
"and actually even that you know again it"
"was considered very very um you know"
"sort of very new and very crazy when"
"when we first started talking about it"
"originally it was originally"
"uh said by harold burr in 1936 who"
"basically had"
"nothing no no uh no technology to work"
"with except the volt voltmeter right he"
"made the first good volt meter they used"
"to go around measuring all kinds of"
"living things on the basis of that he"
"already pulled out this theory that what"
if
uh
"the tissue was storing a bioelectrical"
pattern
that
"reminded it what the shape should be in"
"case it gets injured okay and so and so"
"in planaria we saw that we could"
"actually see it it was amazing we could"
"actually read the set point because the"
"the the super important thing about all"
"of this is that"
"you know here's what's here's what's"
"cool about your thermostat what's cool"
"about your thermostat and all devices"
"like it"
"is that"
"if you want to control the temperature"
"of the room"
"you don't need to understand how your"
"thermostat works you don't need to"
"rewire your thermostat all you need to"
"know is a that it is a thermostat and b"
"that uh how to read and write the set"
"point once you understand that it will"
"obey the set point and you know how to"
"turn how to control the set point the"
"rest of it you don't care about it"
"doesn't matter you don't need to change"
"the wiring you don't need to do any of"
"that right because you because you"
"because it's a good thermostat"
"this is this is an incredibly important"
"path forward for regenerative medicine"
"because if it were true that there was"
"an encoded set point"
"then you could manipulate the setpoint"
"and you wouldn't have to rewire"
"the genetics underneath why is that"
"important because we don't have any clue"
"this is for the same reason i told you"
"before that genetics was not a good uh"
"tool for understanding large-scale"
"decision-making in terms of patterning"
because
"other than single gene diseases"
"we don't have any idea how to solve this"
"inverse problem of saying well i want"
"this particular"
"finger to have this particular shape or"
"i want the you know the heel of the of"
"the foot to have a different shape or"
"what genes am i going to edit right"
"crisper you have all the crisper"
"technology you want you don't know what"
"genes to edit to make that happen it's"
"very difficult"
"so so this a lot this means if if our"
"hypothesis is true it means that you"
"could control the set point and let the"
"cells do what they do best which is"
"build to the set point and then you"
"could go beyond the normal set points"
"and and and"
"code some other stuff that that that you"
"know they weren't going to build but"
"that they will once you've encoded it"
"right you can control it"
so
"as when planaria we found this we found"
"this electrical uh we found this"
"electrical pre-pattern and then we"
"figured out using ion channel drugs that"
"open and close ion channels to"
"manipulate the voltages we figured out"
"how to reset that pattern so what you"
"can do is you can take a plenary you can"
"look at the pattern the pattern says one"
"head one tail you can reset it to be"
"bipolar uh symmetrical meaning two heads"
"and then and then guess what the cells"
"do they will build a planarian with two"
"heads now you've shown this in labs or"
"you've been able to build plans"
"yeah sure sure we've published half a"
"dozen papers on this right"
"yeah there's videos of these two-headed"
"you know plenary and everything yeah"
"because because then this is very"
"important the question of how many heads"
"should you have"
"is not locked down by the dna what the"
"dna does lock down is the hardware that"
"by itself reliably produces a pattern"
"that makes one heads but that's not the"
"only thing it can make if you rewrite"
"that pattern the cells are just as happy"
"to build other patterns and um"
"that's uh that's that's that's where the"
"analogy of hardware and software comes"
"in it's not about who wrote the"
"algorithm there's no no human writing"
"this algorithm it's about a machine that"
separates
"the data from the execution component"
"the data is how many heads should we"
"have and it's separate independent of"
"the cells which will consult that data"
"and say it says two then we build two"
"and right and so so that's the important"
"piece here that it's not and none of"
"this would be reachable if you think"
"about it from the perspective of dna"
"then you would do what all of molecular"
"medicine does today which is drill down"
"on the hardware it's you know rewiring"
"genomic um see is you know rewiring"
"circuits and transcriptional circuits uh"
"genomic editing protein structures"
"none of this is apparent at that level"
"in fact if you were to sequence these"
"two-headed worms you could get you could"
"get the genomics you can get the"
"proteomics you could get anything you"
"want you would never know that they're"
"two-headed because their genomes are"
"wild-type we didn't edit the genome"
"there's nothing wrong with their genome"
"that's not where the information is"
"right so"
"so so we were able to so so we can make"
"two-headed worms we can make no headed"
worms
"then we show that actually in the"
"anatomical amorphous space well guess"
"what there are other shapes belonging to"
"other species of planaria"
"and we've shown that you can take a a"
"genetically normal"
"piece of a worm and cause it to find a"
"completely different to basically to"
"make a different head shape that belongs"
"to different species the brain shape the"
"head shape the distribution of stem"
"cells becomes just like another species"
"there's nothing genetically wrong with"
"them it's the same genome again if you"
"were to sequence them you would find you"
"would have zero clue that that they have"
"in fact had a completely different head"
"that belong to different species so"
"that's the kind of stuff you can do"
"right you can do in these systems um"
"that's in planaria uh in frog what we"
"did was uh to look at organ regeneration"
"and we said"
"okay already we can"
control
"whether you get a head or a tail without"
"having to control directly the"
"underneath molecular biology we didn't"
"the the signal that we provide is very"
"simple so so we don't need to"
um
"micromanage the process by trying to"
"guide all the thousands of"
"hundreds of thousands of gene expression"
"events that have to happen we don't"
"control any of that we don't need to the"
"system already does that we provide the"
"upper level uh decision making of how"
"many heads should you have right then"
"the system takes care of the rest"
"because it knows how to make heads so we"
"said okay could we go even upstream of"
"that what if what if i don't even tell"
"you what to build i just activate a"
"build whatever normally goes here signal"
"just know whatever normally goes at this"
"location presumably you already know"
"what goes there just build that"
"and so what we showed in in tap we"
"started with tadpole tails and this is"
"important because tails have spinal cord"
"and we were interested in getting muscle"
"and spinal cord and that kind of thing"
"and then"
um
"we did uh lay a frog legs so we did"
"adult frogs unlike salamanders do not"
"regenerate their legs and what we showed"
"is that after amputation you can provide"
"a very short trigger"
"that uh would convince the cells to just"
"start building whatever they normally"
"built they would build a leg or a tail"
"they would never build an eye or a tumor"
"or anything else they would build"
"exactly what happens so"
"in the case of the of the tail"
"one hour exposure of the stump to the"
"right bioelectric drugs"
"kickstarts a set of events including all"
"the downstream molecular biology"
"everything else that you would otherwise"
"have to micromanage and it gives you"
"nine days of tail growth"
one
"in the adult frog"
"one day so 24 hour application of this"
"cocktail gives you a year and a half of"
"leg growth during which time we don't"
"touch it at all it's it's all everything"
"we do is in the first few minutes it's"
"all about making them"
"making the decision uh but you know"
"pushing those cells to uh to a decision"
"point and then leaving it alone and"
"letting themselves do what they need to"
do
"so um yeah so we now and so so this is"
"probably a good time to do a disclaimer"
"there's a company called morphaceuticals"
"inc which david kaplan and i am"
"co-founded and uh we are now uh trying"
"to push that into mice so the idea is"
"can we push it to mammals"
"hopefully eventually human human"
patients
"so that's kind of the regeneration story"
"yeah we'd love to would love to hear how"
"the experiments go there um i'm curious"
"you said that you know"
"like frogs for example the tadpoles will"
build
"what normally goes there or planaria"
"already have the information to build"
"ahead but can you"
"build something which it doesn't already"
"have the information to do for example"
"can you build a tail in humans even"
"though humans don't have tails or can"
"you build"
"an extra limb in a platform even though"
"it doesn't have this information yeah"
"yeah um"
"yes we've made we've made a"
"planaria that have the wrong species"
"heads we've made tadpoles that have"
"tails that belong to zebrafish or faces"
"that belong to different kinds of frogs"
"that are not the frog we started with"
"you can do that"
"but the question of"
"information that it doesn't already have"
"is a tricky"
"is it's a tricky question"
"if you think from the point of view of"
"the genetics"
"then absolutely because we can"
"absolutely make a head shape of an"
"animal let's say a planarian from a"
"genome that you don't have that genome"
"you have a different genome so from that"
"perspective sure we can but i want to be"
"careful about that because because uh"
"that's not the right perspective"
"the the better perspective is"
"that of software and hardware it's it's"
"it's of a collective intelligence"
"navigating through this morphe space"
"and once you have that perspective it's"
"not so clear anymore because once you"
"have the ability to navigate more for"
"space there are many many things in this"
"morpho space that you might be able to"
"find in fact we've made we've made"
"planaria that look um like like"
"hedgehogs they're spiky they don't look"
"like a flatworm at all they're"
"three-dimensional tall tubes i mean all"
"kinds of crazy stuff"
and
"it's it's hard for me to say that they"
"don't have that information i think i"
"think they don't have it in the sense"
"that it's not internal but i think they"
"can reach that information by exploring"
"morphospace it's a little bit like"
"okay and it's again a computational"
"analogy once you've made"
"a circuit that can do computations let's"
"say you can do math then you say well is"
"the answer to 5 plus 5 in there well"
"it's not in there"
"but if you were to pose the question if"
"this thing knows the algorithm it can"
"certainly find it and then and then you"
"get to the interesting philosophical"
"question of where do the truths of"
"mathematics live that's you know that's"
"it sounds very philosophical but it's"
"actually quite practical here because"
"when when cells"
"cooperate in novel ways to form new"
"anatomies like for example xenobots"
"right there's never been xenobots um"
"ever there's never been this"
"evolutionary selection to make"
"xenoblades how come they know how to"
"make xenobots and and with all kinds of"
"new behaviors and everything else then"
"then the question is where does that"
exist
"and and uh it it gets i think in the end"
"it's the same question to where"
"where do the truths of mathematical"
"lives the fact that"
"if you're if you're evolution and you're"
"building a triangle and you nail down"
"the first two angles of that triangle"
"you don't need to evolve the third"
"one because you already know the third"
"right if you know two angles you know"
"the third but"
"where does that come from there's no"
"gene for the for that it comes it's a"
"free gift from"
"mathematics from geometry from where so"
"that's where this comes in right you can"
"make these devices evolution makes"
"devices that exploit physics once you"
"exploit physics"
"you have laws of computation you have"
"laws of mathematics that help you do"
"these kinds of things like in a very you"
"know it's kind of a stupidly simple um"
"example with this triangle but that's"
"the idea you don't need to evolve that"
"third angle it's there for you for free"
so
"that's you know so it's tricky this to"
"say whether they have that information"
"or they don't have it you don't need to"
"have it in the genome in order to you"
"know the genome is the"
"it's the contingent kind of those are"
"the contingent details but but"
"everything else you can actually find"
"you know"
"i see interesting okay okay it actually"
"reminds me um i was reading david"
"deutch's book last year and he talks"
"about you know how animals are actually"
"restricted um by the knowledge that's"
"contained in the genome"
"but i mean you know it's a lot of your"
"work might show otherwise now once we"
"once we go yeah i mean i mean look uh"
"there are restrictions if you have a"
"genome that does not let you make"
"voltage-sensitive ion channels"
"you are missing a very powerful"
"uh way to interface with"
"feedback loops with the logic uh you"
know
"logic gates uh things that transistors"
"are good for right so so our"
"voltage-gated ion channels are basically"
"transistors if you don't have that in"
"your genome there are things that are"
"very hard or maybe impossible for you to"
"do so from that perspective sure the"
"genome constrains what you can do and"
"the genome enables other things you can"
"do you know once you have adhesion"
"proteins you can take advantage of all"
"kinds of cool physics of adhesive you"
"know adhesion and sorting and all of"
that
"so so yes it's true that it that it"
"constrains but it does not"
determine
the
"all of the you know all of the"
"possibilities it's it's it's not a"
"controversial claim it's like hardware"
"and software right you know when you buy"
"when you buy a pc does it determine what"
"you can do with it yes and no right"
"some things you're not going to be able"
"to do with it based on the hardware but"
"there are so many things that you could"
"do with it that are not directly"
"described by that hardware"
"and now we're just expanding the"
"possibilities of the software learning"
"more about it"
"yeah that's that's that's right because"
"if you don't know your if you don't know"
"uh what subroutines are available to you"
"you have very limited capacities and"
"this is why"
"when i give a talk one of my first"
"slides is"
"what programming looked like in the 40s"
"and 50s right it was great it's this big"
"giant thing and this woman sitting there"
"and she's she's literally plugging wires"
"in and out because"
"programming had to be at the hardware"
"level and everybody laughs and i and i"
"say i say to people um would it be how"
"terrible would it be if on your laptop"
"you know if you wanted to switch from uh"
"microsoft excel to powerpoint you would"
"have to get out your soldering iron and"
"start rewiring and because that would be"
"terrible so how come you don't have to"
"do that isn't it amazing and why don't"
"why aren't we just as outraged when you"
"do that in in molecular medicine that's"
"all you have in molecular medicine is is"
"is is is direct control you know direct"
"attempts to control the hardware right"
"how come"
"we're not you know that i i truly think"
"that some number of years from now we're"
"going to look back and that picture is"
"you know we're going to have the same"
"picture of of somebody doing crispr on"
"um you know on the genetic circuit we're"
"going to say"
"look at that"
"they're having to program at the level"
"of hardware it's going to be the same"
"you know the same level of amusement"
"that's a great analogy"
"so another application you mentioned was"
cancer
"cancer is say just disorganization at"
"the morphogenetic code level um i have"
"two questions that one can you explain"
"this and then two do we have any sense"
of
"why this disorganization as the"
"information processing or morphogenetic"
"level starts to occur"
"yeah so let's let's go back um and ask"
"ourselves um"
"let's just think about what cancer is"
"and and and i want to be clear by saying"
"that uh you know cancer is a very"
"complex set of diseases there's all"
"kinds of clinical manifestations so i'm"
"once again not claiming that i have the"
"answer to all of this i'm providing what"
"i think is a useful way to think about"
it
"asking the question why do we have"
"cancer is the wrong question the re the"
"real question is"
"why is there ever anything but cancer"
"why are individual cells"
"able to work together to build complex"
"organs why do they not all act like"
"amoebas which is basically metastasis uh"
"we used to be amoebas all of us uh how"
"come uh and bacteria how come"
"how come there's anything else and so"
"whatever mechanism once you've realized"
"that yeah our native state was single"
"cell eventually we got together and"
"started working on cooperative projects"
"like hey build a kidney or build a you"
"know build an arm"
"whatever mechanisms we have for"
"coordinating that inevitably at some"
"point they're gonna there's gonna be"
"breakdowns of that mechanism now so so"
"that tells you that just you know the"
"cancer is the occasional price we pay"
"for being multi-cellular organisms we're"
"being made of parts"
"well when you say inevitably there'll be"
"any breakdowns i guess why do you think"
"that's inevitable well anytime anytime"
"you have a mechanism that does anything"
"there's a chance of it breaking down"
right
"anything that requires you know is is"
"there going to be a breakdown of gravity"
"no because gravity doesn't require a"
"machine to keep it going is there would"
"there be a breakdown of a bicycle"
"there's a good chance because there are"
"three particular things that have to"
"happen for this to be a workable bicycle"
"and at some point there's a chance that"
"it can go wrong i'm not saying but i'm"
"not putting any statistics on and i'm"
"not saying that"
"i'm not saying every human at some point"
"has to get cancer i'm saying that"
"anytime an active mechanism is required"
"there's some chance that it's going to"
"break down okay yeah well so let's think"
"about um"
"let's think about what actually happens"
"uh in in"
"in during that during that breakdown"
"when you have cells collected"
"cells uh connected to each other"
"specifically in electrical networks and"
"i don't have time to go into all the"
"details but but they're you know we've"
"described this in papers um"
"what's important about that is there's"
"important there's an important sense of"
individual
"there's a loss of individual identity in"
"the cells because when two cells are"
"connected to each other very tightly"
"then all the memories are shared all the"
"measurements that they take are shared"
"so so it's like a breakdown of"
"individual identity instead of a bunch"
"of little cells you have a collective"
"that has this emergent goal in that case"
"it might be building some sort of organ"
"but but the point is that it has uh it's"
"very it's impossible for the cells to"
"defect or the language of game theory"
"not cooperate with each other because"
"they are not unique individuals at that"
"point they are so tightly coupled that"
"the network is able to store goals that"
"individual cells don't have and we know"
"how this works in artificial neural"
"networks uh to some extent anyway um"
"and uh and that's what happens now now"
"think of what happens during the"
"breakdown so one way things break down"
"is there are specific kinds of oncogenes"
"like chaos mutations where one of the"
"first thing that happens during that"
"after that mutation is that cells become"
"electrically disconnected from their"
"neighbors as soon as the cell becomes"
"disconnected from its neighbor the"
"boundary uh"
"between it itself and the world starts"
"to shrink"
"for a collection of cells the boundary"
"is quite large it might be a whole"
"finger or a whole arm or the whole body"
"you know it's quite large for once the"
"cell becomes disconnected that boundary"
"between self and world shrinks as far as"
"that cell is concerned the rest of the"
"body is just external environment"
"right it's it's no longer plugged into"
"the goals of that network it's now well"
"i'm now an amiibo like i used to be you"
"know a billion years ago what are my"
"goals well my goals are to become two"
"amoebas and to go wherever life is good"
"that's my goals and that's metastasis so"
"with your hand and and so what you have"
"is is once you disconnect from the"
"network the purpose of the network"
"is to raise the iq of the collective so"
"that it can"
"work towards"
"the goals that are bigger than single"
"cell level goals single cells can have"
"metabolic goals they can have some some"
"local shape goals and things like that"
"but they can't have they can't"
"contemplate the goal of"
"making a finger or an arm or something"
"like only the collective can can do that"
"so so when they disconnect they don't"
"become more selfish than normal cells a"
"lot of times people talk about cancer"
"cells being more selfish they're not"
"more selfish they just have smaller"
cells
"everybody is all the cells are equally"
"selfish it's just that when they're"
"merged it's like a it's like a it's like"
"a mind meld when they're merged into one"
"group that selfishness goes towards you"
"know i'm making about this organ in the"
"body and by the way that's a very"
"selfish process because organs compete"
"for energy and information with each"
"other inside the same body organs"
compete
"and uh and and so"
"that self is kind of large but now when"
"the self shrinks well now it's a single"
"cell single cell doesn't care what"
"happens to the environment um"
"and so and so that's cancer so so what"
"we've been able to do basically we've"
"been able to do three things and most of"
"our work has been in uh in in frog"
"models now as in fact just this morning"
"we published a paper on this in human"
"glioblastoma so so we're slowly moving"
"to um to to to mammals and medicine"
"uh we've shown three things number one"
"that we can use voltage sensitive dye"
"technology to image and detect"
when
"uh when cells are about to"
"to defect from the electrical network so"
"they acquire we inject basically we"
"inject oncogenes into a tackle and when"
"the cells"
"get to um"
uh
"you know when when when they become uh"
isolated
"uh they it's it's uh we can that voltage"
"that aberrant voltage potential we can"
"image it so you can see where the tumor"
"is going to form and so that's the"
"object it's a basis of very obvious"
"diagnostic you know kinds of"
"applications that's the first thing the"
"second thing we found is that"
"there's this uh there's this standard"
"you know the standard story of cancer is"
"that it starts with mutations and that"
"there's a set of hydrogens that okay so"
"so what we were able to show is that you"
"don't need any of that what you can do"
"is you can disrupt the electrical"
"communication between cells"
"and you can trigger so we've shown that"
"you can trigger metastatic melanoma in a"
"frog model with no mutations whatsoever"
"no mutations no oncogenes no carcinogens"
"no disruption of the genetics at all the"
"hardware is perfectly fine and it's like"
"again it's new now in fact it was so"
"many people said it was outrageous when"
"we first you know our first pnaas paper"
"the reviewers like where's the what's"
"the genetic mutation here where's your"
"founder cell so that's exactly the point"
"there is no foundation there is no"
"genetic mutation is it well then it's"
"not a cancer well that's a very funny"
"you know a way to do to do this you're"
"defining it the way you'd like to define"
"it but look at the phenotype you know"
"the animal is is is packed with these"
"with these you know metastatic uh"
"transformed melanocytes"
so
uh
"you know you can and and in the early"
"stages there's nothing wrong with them"
"you couldn't tell that genetically you"
"would never find anything wrong with"
"them you know later on of course they"
"turned on all the response genes you"
"know slug and snail and all that stuff"
"but um yeah so so we showed that just by"
"disruption of electrical uh signaling"
"you can induce you can induce cancer"
and
"so so it doesn't have to it doesn't have"
"to start it's like"
"in fact again it's it's one of these"
"things that was it was considered new"
"and and strange and whatever but in the"
"60s um"
"this guy whose name i'm blanking on at"
"the moment had this quote that said that"
"you you will never find the cause of a"
"traffic jam by looking at the internal"
"combustion engine of the car right"
"that's not where the problem is there's"
"nothing wrong with these cars and that's"
"exactly the thing here you can sequence"
"these cells until you go blue"
"there's there's nothing wrong with them"
"there's no there's it's not a problem"
"with the with the hardwoods nothing"
"wrong with it nothing wrong with the"
"hardware okay the third thing we did"
"which which is okay you know kind of the"
"most exciting is we could go in the"
"opposite direction so we could take"
"um we could take embryos that were"
"injected with"
"uh oncogene oncogenes like nasty keras"
"mutations and things like that"
"and uh and we could artificially force"
"their voltage to stay normal so that"
"they stay in electrical connection with"
"their neighbors and if you do that you"
"can suppress the tumors so you can"
"suppress or even even normalize tumors"
"that already exist"
"so so we were you can do that with drugs"
"you can do that with optogenetics you"
"can do that with um with injected you"
"know channel rna um and we were able to"
"show that and so so those are the"
"stories on in in cancer you can you can"
"detect it you can induce it and you can"
"normalize it you don't kill the cells"
"the cells don't die so there's no so"
"it's a different um approach going"
"forward it's not some sort of"
"chemotherapy right where you're trying"
"to poison one set of cells it's it's not"
"that you're trying to reinflate the size"
"of the self again so that these cells"
"just get harnessed back to the histo"
"histo genesis programs not uh not"
cancer
"yeah that's very different so it's like"
"you're giving signals to these cells to"
"once again become part of the collective"
"machinery and the collective goal"
"instead of"
um
"whatever caused the disorganization to"
"occur and for them to go off on their"
"own path"
"okay amazing so um i'm curious like what"
"did you show in in in humans you said he"
"said publish something oh this is yeah"
"just came out this morning um this is uh"
"this is uh the the work of uh a staff"
"scientist in my group called juanita"
"matthews and she showed that uh"
"human glioblastoma cell lines in this is"
"this is in culture the next of course we"
"have to go in vivo um in culture we can"
"uh using uh already human approved ion"
"channel drugs so things these are things"
"people already take for other reasons"
"can uh can prevent those cells they can"
"stop them from proliferating and induce"
"a level of uh"
"normalization so basically a degree of"
"differentiation into like normal normal"
"neurons um things like that i mean"
"something it's a very long paper but"
"that's that's the idea the normalization"
"of these cells in in culture"
"okay amazing um a few last questions i"
"know you have to go uh at 12."
"on the topic of cancer i guess aging is"
"something that comes up as well and i"
"know david sinclair recently posted that"
"your team and his team sat together and"
"brainstormed how maybe some of your"
"research can have potential applications"
"for aging so i i don't know if you can"
"like if"
"if it's not if you can show it publicly"
"talk about how you're even thinking"
"about some of these applications"
"applying to aging"
"yeah uh i mean"
"they're clearly connected problems you"
"know planaria that are is so highly"
"regenerative do not age so there's no"
"such thing as an old plenary and they're"
"immortal uh that's no that's not an"
"accident uh so the question is what's"
"going on how are they able to"
"continuously regenerate their their any"
"any senescent tissues um and by the way"
"going back to your original question"
"about the dna you know because because"
"some species of planaria because they"
don't
"uh they because the way they divide they"
"just tear themselves in half and"
"regenerate so they don't necessarily go"
"through sperm and egg it means that any"
"cell that gets a mutation and doesn't"
"die repopulates the new worm that's you"
"know the second half of the worm then"
"after they split will come from these"
"cells so they're continuously"
"accumulating somatic mutations that"
"doesn't happen for other creatures right"
"because the somatic mutations we get in"
"our body don't get passed on to our"
offspring
"and plenary they do so planaria have an"
"incredibly messy genome in fact a single"
"worm all the cells are mixploid meaning"
"there are there are a different number"
"of chromosomes like a tumor if you were"
"to sequence that you said well this is a"
"mess that should definitely be a tumor"
"and they are"
"100 the best regenerators around there"
"the rock solid anatomical control the"
"genome is all over the place it's a"
"total mess so that that already tells"
"you how little we understand about what"
"the gene what genomes actually do and"
"what's actually controlling things it"
"should be it's not anything you see in"
"any textbooks but it's"
"it should be a scandal of you know why"
"why is the"
"why why is that why is can this happen"
"uh so so with david so so we don't know"
"exactly what model system we're going to"
"look at but but the bottom line is"
"they have they have some really amazing"
"examples of uh the control of aging in"
"their various"
"mammalian systems and mice and human"
"cells so on uh we are going to uh look"
"to see what the bioelectric component"
"that is how much of how much of that"
"control hum what happens to the"
"bioelectrics during aging can you use"
"the bioelectrics to try to reverse aging"
"uh you know those kinds of things we'll"
"see it's very early we're just starting"
"it's very early days yeah no very"
"exciting curious to see what happens um"
"last question on i guess this has"
"application synthetic biology as well"
"you know"
"more recently i think elon musk tweeted"
"about something and then synthetic"
"wounds became"
"a hot topic of debate so i guess your"
"research could also apply to creating"
"synthetic rooms or just artificial life"
right
"um yeah there's a lot there uh to talk"
"about i mean we don't really make"
"artificial life per se we make novel"
"organisms because we start with existing"
"cells in my group we don't we don't"
"address the origin of life issue really"
"we don't i mean there are other people"
"who do a very nice job of making these"
"minimal systems that are kind of like"
"living cells but not really and we don't"
"do that we start with existing cells and"
"then we make novel organisms to test the"
"ability of life to adapt to novel"
"configurations and try to understand"
"something about evolution by doing that"
"uh yeah so that's you know so that's i"
"mean the wombs in the sense of in the"
"sense of humans we don't"
"have anything to do with that you know"
"that issue but but but really to"
"understand the intelligence of cells and"
"their ability to adjust to novel"
perturbations
"got it okay"
"well anything else um last points you"
"want to talk about that i haven't asked"
"you or just what you're excited about in"
"the future yeah no i think uh thank you"
"for the conversation i think you asked"
"all the all the right questions we're"
"we're incredibly excited because"
"it's it's not often that uh you can make"
"progress i think on problems ranging"
"from like fundamental issues of of"
"philosophy of mind and personal identity"
"and uh in a way that makes uh an impact"
"on medicine so they're not just thinking"
"you know in the vacuum it actually has"
"practical applications so i'm very you"
"know i'm just super excited about this"
"this field i'm super excited to be"
"working with all the people in my group"
"everybody else in the community which is"
"very exciting time to be doing this"
"couldn't agree more with you it's"
"typically discussed in silos where"
"philosophers talk about talking about"
"the meaning of life or cognitive science"
"and you're combining all of this into"
"something a lot more practical so thank"
"you so much for your time today it's"
"been a pleasure thank you so much real"
"pleasure thank you"
"hey everyone i hope you enjoyed the"
