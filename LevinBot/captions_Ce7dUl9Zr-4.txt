"through so um"
"our thanks exactly for hitting record so"
"um welcome everyone to the the final bbi"
"seminar of the year um"
"this is uh we're really we're really"
"fortunate to have michael levin here"
"today um he's gonna be telling us a"
"little bit about his research but before"
"before i introduce him i just want to"
"quickly go through some of the"
"administrative type things so one of the"
"things is that we we"
"basically collate questions that you"
"might have for mike through um a slido"
"website so if you type into google slido"
"and you'll be taken to a"
"website where you can type in this"
"number which is in the chat so this is"
five
"one three three zero six and you'll be"
"able to then post questions or upload"
"other questions that you want to be"
"asked at the end of his talk um mike has"
"a lot of stuff to go through something"
"very very quick now so to introduce um"
"michael levin so he's a distinguished"
"professor in biology"
"at tufts and also an associate faculty"
"at the vice institute at harvard um he"
"has lots of awards and prizes but one of"
"the reasons i'm really excited that he's"
"here is he does some i think"
"super creative research around"
"basically trying to understand some of"
"the biophysical mechanisms that kind of"
"cells and biology in general uses to"
"make decisions around the shapes and"
"patterns that it forms"
"and he's been doing some really i think"
"wonderful work around thinking about how"
"cells as collectives think in some ways"
"and some of the approaches is to those"
"sorts of problems and and actually not"
"just looking at sales but actually"
"getting them to do things in different"
"ways so kind of manipulating those"
"systems so without any further ado i'm"
"going to hand over to michael to tell us"
"a little bit more about some of the"
"things he's been working on"
"thank you so much and uh thank you for"
"the chance to share some ideas uh with"
"you all um"
"uh i'm extremely uh excited to uh to be"
"here this morning can everybody see my"
slide
"yep that's great perfect okay so um just"
"two things uh if anybody wants to"
"contact me afterwards uh these are the"
"two websites that you can reach me at"
"all the primary papers uh the data the"
"controls everything is is on the site"
"and i have to start with two uh"
"disclosures which are um two spin-off"
companies
"uh fauna systems and morphoceuticals inc"
"which are uh part of uh part of this"
work
"so here are the main points that i'd"
"like to transmit today first of all uh"
"that for the biologists that uh"
"fundamental advances and new biomedical"
"approaches are going to require uh not"
"just understanding the molecular"
"mechanisms by which these things work"
"but actually understanding the"
"collective intelligence of cells and"
"tissues as problem-solving agents in"
"various types of spaces and i'm going to"
"try to convince you that a key medium"
"for those kind of computations is"
"something we call non-neural"
"bioelectricity it's basically a kind of"
"software layer of physiology that sits"
"between the genome and the functional"
anatomy
"and that i think that uh cracking the"
"bioelectric code the the the mapping of"
"this software layer is really going to"
"enable a whole category of so-called"
"electroceuticals for uh novel"
"applications and birth defects"
"regenerative medicine and cancer and"
"actually uh towards the end we're going"
"to get into some the material that's"
"more related to robotics and ai where i"
"think the plasticity of this biological"
"software especially as we investigated"
"through some through the medium of"
"synthetic organisms is going to really"
"shed some interesting light on bigger"
"questions the nature of cognition the"
"evolutionary origins of mind and"
"behavior and even some practical"
"implications for general ai so the"
"biology part of the talk boiled down to"
"two sentences is is basically this"
"that like the brain all of the tissues"
"in in bodies form electrical networks"
"that make decisions now these are"
"decisions about dynamic anatomy and they"
"solve problems and understanding this uh"
"non-neural collective intelligence has"
"huge impacts for um all these all these"
"other fields and i show you this"
"five-legged frog just to remind us that"
"i'm going to show you all kinds of"
"weird-looking animals today these are"
"not photoshopped these are real living"
"organisms in our lab that are the medium"
"by which we test our theories and our"
"models so the first thing"
"i'd like to do is to talk about some"
"fundamental knowledge gaps in biology"
"and then we'll get to the details of"
"bioelectricity and then talk about the"
future
so
"i think one way to to to uh"
"envision the endgame of this whole field"
"you know where where where is this all"
"going is this idea of the anatomical"
compiler
someday
"what you ought to be able to do is sit"
"down at a computer and draw the anatomy"
"of the plant or animal that you want"
"made so you wouldn't design it at the"
"level of proteins or genes or pathways"
"but you would simply draw anatomically"
"what you actually want the way that we"
"do with with auto parts and various"
"other things in computer aided drawing"
"and so uh if we knew what we were doing"
"and if the field was mature what we"
"would have is a piece of software that"
"would take that description and compile"
"it down to a set of stimuli that"
"individual cells would have to receive"
"in order for them to make whatever it is"
"that you're drawing in this case a three"
three-headed
flower
"now we don't have anything remotely like"
"this and it's in it's critical because"
"this problem the uh is is basically at"
"the root of almost every aspect of"
"biomedicine with the exception perhaps"
"of infectious disease so if we knew how"
"to tell cells what they should build we"
"would automatically have the solution to"
"birth defects to traumatic injury cancer"
"aging all of these things have this one"
"linchpin in common which is how do"
"collections of cells know what to make"
"and how can we influence that okay and"
"so this is what we're interested in and"
"and in terms of thinking about what are"
"the limitations you know why are we not"
"even close to having something like this"
"let's just look at some some some simple"
"knowledge gap so so here is the larva of"
"a salamander of an axolotl and it has"
"legs here is a tadpole of a frog and it"
"doesn't have legs and so we have"
"the genomes of both of these species so"
"we know we know what the genomes are and"
"now i might ask a simple question if we"
"combine these embryos early on to make a"
"chimeric embryo and we can do this we'll"
"make a frogolottle and i can simply ask"
um
"is a frogalol going to have legs or not"
"and we have absolutely no idea there's"
"there's no way for us right now from the"
"genetic information to predict something"
"as something very basic like this and in"
"fact this chimeric experiment is simply"
"highlighting something that uh is uh is"
"true even of each individual species"
"which is that we can't predict their"
"form from the genome either right you"
"can you can sort of cheat and compare it"
"to other genomes that you do know what"
"the what the anatomy is but"
"we really don't have very good control"
"over the over the system level"
"properties and so"
"we want to ask where does this pattern"
"actually come from so we all start life"
"as this sort of collective of of"
"blastomeres and then this is a"
"cross-section through a human torso look"
"at the incredible order the the the"
"stereotypical arrangement the position"
"the um the size the orientation"
"everything is exactly in the right place"
"where did this come from"
"we're tempted to say dna but of course"
"we can read genomes now and we know that"
"what's in the genome is actually"
"specifications of protein-level hardware"
"the individual proteins that every cell"
"gets to have there's nothing directly in"
"there that speaks to the size the shape"
"the symmetry type of the organism so we"
"really need to understand this middle"
"layer you know how do these cells know"
"what to make and when to stop as workers"
"in regenerative medicine if a piece of"
"this is missing we would like to know"
"what stimuli would get the cells to"
"build it again and as engineers we would"
"like to take one step further and ask"
"yeah but what's actually possible to"
"build uh that's beyond the standard kind"
"of default outcome right given the same"
"genome what else are these cells willing"
"to build"
"and this causes us to ask some important"
"questions about the capacities and"
"competencies of individual cells now"
"this thing here is a lacrimaria this is"
"a single cell organism there's no brain"
"there's no nervous system there's no"
"stem cells or cell to cell communication"
"it's all one cell this animal uh"
"you know if you're into soft robotics"
"and things like this you can uh you can"
"really be envious of this we don't have"
"anything remotely this this competent"
"in our engineering repertoire um this"
"animal handles its uh uh anatomical its"
"physiological and its behavioral needs"
"all in one cell okay but what's really"
"interesting is that that process can be"
"scaled up and when these cells join"
"together to make bodies they don't just"
"lose all this amazing capacity what they"
"do is they they scale it to pursue much"
"larger goals so instead of local single"
"cell goals they do things like this they"
"build uh these these incredibly complex"
"um three-dimensional morphologies"
"and so the story the the standard story"
"of this process is something like this"
"uh there are gene regulatory networks"
"some of that turned each other on and"
"off there are some of these proteins are"
"um are sticky or they exert force so"
"there's various kinds of physics that go"
"on and then in when when these local"
"interactions take place"
"in very large numbers in parallel"
"there's this project of the"
"process of emergence and outcomes"
"something wonderful like this salamander"
"and all of these steps are"
"are true they do occur but there's a"
"fundamental uh difficulty here and a"
"limitation that we'll explore here which"
"is that if you wanted to make changes at"
"this end and you think that uh our our"
"main uh functional targets are down here"
"we have a really difficult inverse"
"problem right for both for us as as as"
"workers in biology and medicine but also"
"for the system uh for the system itself"
"for evolution and for development"
"it's entirely unclear what to change"
"down here to make specific changes up"
"here and this is a limitation"
"of of technology such as genome editing"
"and so on four uh goals that we might"
"want to achieve with complex structure"
"now uh what i want to uh sort of"
"emphasize is the incredible plasticity"
"and uh and robustness of this process so"
here
"uh is is this salamander this is an"
"axolotl these animals regenerate"
"throughout their lifestyle"
"lifetime their eyes their jaws their"
"limbs their tails spinal cord"
"ovaries portions of the brain and heart"
"and if you amputate here for example"
"the limb will grow very rapidly and the"
"most amazing thing about this process is"
"that it knows when to stop when does it"
"stop it stops when a correct salamander"
"arm has been complete which raises the"
"obvious question of how does the system"
"know what what a correct salamander arm"
"looks like so that it can"
"monitor deviations from that from that"
"state and then do some sort of a"
"means-ends kind of analysis to get back"
"to where it is and when the error is"
"reduced it stops"
"so this is a vertebrate that does this"
"now the champions of this process are"
"planaria so these are flat worms you can"
"see one here these animals can be cut"
"into pieces uh the record is something"
"like uh 275 pieces"
"and uh every piece will grow exactly"
"what's needed to make a perfect little"
"worm no more no less in fact the the new"
"tissue grows the old tissue actually"
"shrinks down so that the whole thing can"
"be in a spatial proportion"
"and they are in fact uh so regenerative"
"that they are immortal there's no such"
"thing as an old planarian uh every every"
"um senescing cells drop off and then"
"they're regenerated and the animal just"
"continues and you can see the really"
"interesting problem solving here you"
"take a sin you make a single cut these"
"cells back here have to make a head"
"these cells back here have to make a"
"tail they were direct neighbors"
"when you came along and separated them"
"and then yet they have completely"
"different anatomical fates so it's not"
"enough to know the local position of"
"where you are you actually have to"
"communicate with the rest of the tissue"
"to know what else is here what's missing"
"what do you need to make and then so on"
"now in particular this error"
"minimization process is well"
"illustrated by this which we discovered"
"a few years ago"
"these are this is a tadpole of the frogs"
"and the slaves here's the brain here are"
"the eyes here the nostrils and the gut"
"and these tadpoles need to become frogs"
"and when they uh become frogs what has"
"to happen is their face has to rearrange"
"so the eyes have to move forward the"
"jaws have to come out the nostrils move"
"everything moves and it was thought that"
"somehow uh what the genetics did was"
"turn standard tadpoles into standard"
"frogs by having a"
"a hardwired set of movements right every"
"organ moves the right distance in the"
"right direction and then you get your"
"normal frog so we made what we call"
"picasso tadpoles basically everything is"
"mixed up the eye might be on the back of"
"the head the mouth is off to the side"
"the jaws are you know everything is"
moved
"and what we found out is that these"
"animals make pretty normal frogs because"
"all of these organs move around in novel"
"unnatural paths and they and they stop"
"when when they correct frog face is made"
"in fact sometimes they overshoot and"
"they have to come back and so"
"and so what what the genetics actually"
"gives us is not a set of hardwired"
"movements but a an error minimization"
"kind of process that uh has a set point"
"and is able to continue to remodel if"
"started off in the wrong region of that"
"amorphous space is able to solve this"
"problem and still get to where it's"
"going and this this theme of solving"
"specific problems despite perturbations"
"is going to be very important in this"
"talk and it'll come up several more"
"times so"
"so this this raises all kinds of"
"interesting questions not not just about"
"the molecular mechanisms of how this"
"works but actually about the information"
"processing and what's being measured"
"what's be you know um well how do they"
"remember their set points and so on and"
so
"where things stand is that"
"biology in general and biomedicine is"
"very good at getting this kind of"
"information right about the molecular"
"hardware what genes interact with which"
"other genes and so on protein networks"
"that kind of thing but we're a very long"
"way from understanding large scale"
"phenomena like this this is trophic"
"memory observed in deer uh first uh some"
"decades back where if you make a um"
"if you make them in an injury to a"
"particular uh space uh a particular"
"location at this branching structure"
"this whole thing falls off and next year"
"a new set of antlers comes up and it"
"will have an ectopic tine at the same"
"location where the damage was last year"
"so the cells at the scalp somehow"
"remember the three-dimensional location"
"of of the damage store it for months and"
"then affect the cell division planes of"
"the bone cells as they make these uh as"
"they make these antlers to do you know"
"what kind of just think what kind of"
"molecular pathway model could even begin"
"to explain something like this right we"
"don't even have the uh the proper uh"
"you know conceptual models to uh to turn"
"something like this into this kind of"
"thing so"
"um these are the questions you know"
"these are very computer sciencey"
"questions that i think are very"
"important to try to understand what's"
"going on in biology and i think it's a"
"deep analogy not not just not just a"
"shallow one because computer science has"
"a lot to teach us one of the most"
"interesting things that happened there"
"was that"
"this is what programming looked like in"
"the 40s and 50s so in order to get this"
"computer to do something different she's"
"reprogramming it by physically changing"
"the hardware okay now what the computer"
"scientists figured out is that if the"
"hardware is good enough and i'm going to"
"claim that biological hardware is"
"definitely good enough"
"this is not your only option what you"
"can do in fact is control the the"
"outcome via inputs or stimuli or"
"experiences and by taking advantage of"
"the native computational power of this"
"thing you can program it in uh"
"progressively more powerful ways that"
"don't rely on um"
"controlling the micro level uh um you"
"know the micro level uh details but"
"actually in the ways that you actually"
"uh can think about a problem and specify"
"the solution in a much more intuitive"
"way and you know to to computer"
"scientists and to all computer users"
"it's obvious that"
"when you want to switch from photoshop"
"to microsoft excel on your computer you"
"don't get out your soldering iron and"
"start rewiring right so we all take that"
"for granted but in biology note that in"
"molecular medicine everything is still"
"at this level so everything is still"
"about molecular pathways genomic editing"
"single molecule approaches we are"
"extremely excited about the hardware as"
"we should be it's wonderful wonderful"
hardware
"but we really need to move uh"
"move forward and add to this the"
"understanding of the software of what's"
"going on and so in my group we think"
"very hard about this feedback loop that"
"enables this uh this process to"
"not not just to to emergently create a"
"complex shape but actually to be able to"
"restore it"
"against perturbations now those might be"
"injury they might be uh teratogens they"
"might be"
"bacteria pathogens the mute in fact"
"mutations all kinds of things and so"
"there actually what what uh is added"
"here are feedback loops both at the"
"level of physics and genetics that will"
"continuously try to reduce error this is"
"in effect a homeostatic process now the"
"thing here that's familiar in biology is"
"of course feedback loops everyone knows"
"about feedback loops"
"but what's unique are two things first"
"of all the set point of this feedback"
"loop is not a scalar like ph or"
"metabolic level or something that that"
"we're used to or you know blood pressure"
"it's actually a a complex piece of"
"information that's a that's a coarse"
"grained description of the anatomy it's"
"some some sort of rough"
"rough description of the anatomical"
"layout so that the system can tell if"
"things are correct or not"
"and uh and the other um"
"the other thing about this is that in a"
"cybernetic sense not in a magical sense"
"it provides the whole process with a"
"kind of goal directedness the goal"
"directedness refers to the fact that"
"there is a particular target morphology"
"there's a there's a specific state that"
"towards which the system expends energy"
"to try to get to that state if it can"
"and once it gets to that state that's"
"when everything stops okay so that's the"
"functional definition of this target"
"morphology so this kind of weird way of"
"of looking at what's normally thought of"
"as a as a simply a feed-forward"
"emergence example of emergence has a"
"strong predictive consequence the"
"prediction is"
"that maybe we don't have to make our"
"changes back here if we understood the"
"encoding of that target morphology the"
"way that the the set point is encoded if"
"we find it and decode it and learn to"
"rewrite it"
"then we could change what it is that the"
"system builds and actually uh leave it"
"alone and in the sense of not having to"
"rewire the hardware at all and so that"
"only works of course for systems that"
"have this uh this kind of scheme"
"and so we've spent quite a bit of time"
"uh trying to identify those set points"
"and trying to rewrite them so at this"
"point i want to show you how how that"
"works and i think this is just one one"
"way and and so let's talk about"
"bioelectricity which is basically"
"neuroscience taken broader and a broader"
"conception of what a neuron might"
"actually be"
"so all cells in the body receive this"
"kind of information via a morphogenetic"
"field it's just this this"
"three-dimensional um"
"field of information and it comes in"
"many flavors chemical extracellular"
"matrix tension"
"so bioelectricity is not the only"
"important thing uh i have to make that"
"clear because we're going to spend the"
"rest of the hour talking about"
bioelectricity
"but i think i think it has some special"
"and unique features which is that it's"
"not just another mechanism it's not just"
"one more thing that you have to add to"
"biomechanics and gene regulation to"
"understand patterning it actually gives"
"some privileged access to the"
"computations that are going on in terms"
"of the control of complex structures"
"and so in the brain the way this shakes"
"out in the brain is is pretty pretty"
"familiar to everybody so the hardware"
"looks like this uh cells with ion"
"channel proteins that allow them to"
"flip uh charged ions in and out and thus"
"acquire a voltage state and that voltage"
state
"can be propagated to their neighbors in"
"the network through uh these little uh"
"electrical synapses known as gap"
junctions
"so that's so that's the hardware and"
"this hardware underlies a really uh"
"fantastic type of software and uh that"
"that normally as far as nervous system"
"is concerned is is about behavior it's"
"about moving the body through"
"three-dimensional space and here you can"
"see this isn't this isn't our movie this"
"is a beautiful um"
"visualization of the electrical activity"
"in the brain and the commitment of"
"neuroscience is to this idea that if we"
"understood the decoding we could infer"
"what the animal uh was thinking about we"
"could on we could decode memories goals"
"preferences all these things are"
"actually in the electrical activity that"
"people are reading out so this is neural"
"decoding lots of people are working on"
"this well it turns out that uh all cells"
"in your body basically do the same"
"they all cells have ion channels they"
"set voltage gradients they communicate"
"those with electric synapses through"
"networks and uh this system drives a"
"very similar kind of uh um"
"software although much much more much"
"more slowly that instead of moving your"
"uh your body in three-dimensional space"
"what this does is moves the"
"configuration of the body through"
"anatomical uh morphospace and that's not"
"an accident evolution basically pivoted"
"that ancient system into uh the control"
"of behavior when when muscles and"
"neurons develop and so we can do"
"something very similar and and bring to"
"bear all the concepts and tools of"
"neuroscience and and generalize them to"
"try to decode to do a kind of decoding"
"so that we learn to read and write this"
"electrical information and so"
"what we've developed was a set of tools"
"to do this so this is a"
"voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye in"
"time-lapse uh observing a frog embryo"
"and it allows us to get a uh basically a"
"map of a real-time map of all the"
"electrical states and all the"
"conversations that these cells are"
"having with each other as the embryo"
"figures out which"
"you know which end is which and then we"
"do a lot of computational modeling which"
"you can do to figure out why you're"
"getting particular voltage patterns"
"given the channels and pumps that are"
"expressed and so just to show you a"
"couple of examples of these native"
patterns
"this is a frog embryo putting its face"
"together um it's a grayscale instead of"
"pseudo color but what you're seeing is"
"uh you know of course in time lapse this"
"is one frame out of that movie and you"
"can see that even before all the genes"
"turn on that pattern the face"
"here the the tissue has already decided"
"where everything is going to go here's"
"where the mouth is going to go here's"
"the animal's right eye here are the"
"placards um the left eye will come in uh"
"shortly um shortly thereafter"
"so here's the one eye and then and then"
"shortly thereafter here's the other eye"
"is going to come in so"
"this is a native uh natural pattern that"
"is absolutely required for normal"
"craniofacial development if you if you"
"disturb this electrical pattern the gene"
"expression is altered and the anatomy"
"follows that's that's a normal pattern"
"here's a pathological pattern we've"
"injected these animals with human"
"oncogenes they will eventually form a"
"tumor the tumor will eventually"
"metastasize like this uh even before any"
"of that is anatomically apparent you can"
"already see with this voltage dye you"
"can already see the electrical state"
"changing these cells are depolarized"
"it's an early step after oncogene"
expression
"and they electrically disconnect from"
"their neighbors at which point they"
"basically just revert back to their"
"unicellular past as far as they're"
"concerned the rest of the animal is just"
"environment to them at this point so"
"that boundary between self and external"
"world shifts based on the extent of your"
"electrical network in your in your"
"communication when that closes down"
"these that's when you get metastasis and"
"over proliferation the cells are just at"
"that point amoeba is doing what amoebas"
"do so uh what we've developed are"
"some tools to actually manipulate these"
"electrical conversations and what we"
"don't do is is use any kind of applied"
"electric fields there are no electrodes"
"there is certainly no magnetics no"
"electromagnetic waves this is purely"
"molecular physiology targeting the"
"normal mechanisms by which electricity"
"is processed"
"so we basically get to control um uh two"
things
"one is the uh the topology of the"
"network so these gap junctions they can"
"be mutated they can be open and closed"
"with various drugs they can be targeted"
"in different ways to control which cells"
"talk to which other cells and then we"
"can of course directly control the ion"
"channels with drugs with mutation with"
"light in terms of optogenetics we can"
"put down light masks that will turn"
"impose uh specific patterns of voltage"
"onto tissue okay so this is these are"
"the molecular ways we have of perturbing"
"um perturbing the bioelectric"
"communication and so now what happens"
"when you actually do this let me show"
"you a few examples so here's one example"
"here's an early frog embryo and what"
"we've gone is it micro-injected into"
"some cells that are going to become gut"
"and so this this gut tissue"
"micro-injected some cells that uh"
"with with rna that encodes a particular"
"ion channel and what happens is that ion"
"channel works to set up a local voltage"
"state very much like what you saw in"
"that electric face that i showed you a"
"minute ago so that's that kind of eye"
specific
"spot when you do this those cells use"
"that uh bioelectric map as a reference"
"and sure enough they will make an eye"
"and these eyes can have all the same"
"layers that are normal"
"that a normal eye will have so"
"so lens retina optic nerve all of these"
"things and uh and there there are two uh"
"kind of really interesting parts to this"
"to this phenomenon one is the is note"
"the modularity we did not provide all of"
"the information that's needed to make an"
"eye eyes are very complex we have no"
"idea how to micromanage the creation of"
"an eye what we did find is a subroutine"
"call this is a particular bioelectrical"
"state not of a single cell of a field of"
"cells that tells that region you're"
"going to make an eye and everything"
"that's downstream of that all the gene"
"expression that has to and then the cell"
"movements and everything else that has"
"to happen to make an eye is all"
"downstream of that all we have to"
"provide is a particular trigger so"
"that's really good news for regenerative"
"medicine you don't have to micromanage"
"the outcomes let me show you many"
"examples of that the other interesting"
"thing is that there are two levels of"
"instruction here the first is us"
"instructing the cells what they should"
"be so the blue"
"is a lineage label it's a beta"
"galactosidase base co-injected with our"
"ion channel rna that marks the cells"
"that we have specifically modified so"
"these here the blue cells here are the"
"cells that actually got our new ion"
"channel now this whole thing is a lens"
"sitting out in the tail a fin of a"
tadpole
"and look what these cells have done the"
"second layer of instructions is that"
"these cells have said to their neighbors"
"which were not directly affected by us"
"in any way uh you're gonna work with us"
"and participate in making this nice nice"
"round lens so not only did we get the"
"neighbors to do something interesting"
"but we got them to communicate to their"
"neighbors and uh take on"
"a function that otherwise for example if"
"that didn't occur maybe we didn't inject"
"enough cells to make a lens right but"
"that's okay these cells recruit their"
"neighbors to get their job done so"
"that's interesting and in fact you can"
"you can induce many different kinds of"
"organs you can make fins although um"
"tactiles aren't supposed to have fins so"
"that's interesting"
"you can you can induce odor cysts uh"
"extra hearts uh extra forebrain new"
"limbs this is remember this is all by"
"manipulating the bioelectric pattern but"
"then there are many organs we don't know"
"how to make yet so we don't know how to"
"make liver kidneys um that sort of thing"
"that's you know inactive research"
"now i want to switch to a different"
"model system to try to"
"understand some more about how the"
"bioelectrics encodes this information so"
"here's a planarian if you cut off a head"
"in the tail this middle fragment 100 of"
"the time knows what to do and it makes a"
"head here and it makes a tail there now"
"part of that it turns out is because it"
"has this nice voltage gradient that"
"tells it uh where the head goes and"
"where the tail goes and we know this is"
"instructive because if you manipulate it"
"and you artificially depolarize this end"
"back here and cause cause duplicate that"
"pattern you can get two-headed worms um"
"perfectly viable uh or in fact you can"
"go the opposite direction and get no"
"headed worms okay now one can ask an"
"interesting question if you make this"
"kind of two-headed worm"
"and then uh"
"you you amputate the primary head and"
"you amputate this ectopic secondary head"
"and you let the thing regenerate in"
"plain old water right so no more no more"
"manipulations of any kind the genetics"
"are untouched we haven't we haven't"
"edited the genome there's no transgenes"
"uh the prediction would be the standard"
"model would predict that well surely"
"then you'd go back to being a normal"
"worm because this ectopic reprogrammed"
"tissue is gone that you know the"
"genetics are wild type so of course this"
"middle fragment should just make a"
"normal worm"
"but it turns out once we understood the"
"circuit a little better it turns out"
"that there is a"
"uh there's a stable attractor of this"
"electrical circuit that corresponds to a"
"single head state and then that's that's"
"you know those are your normal worms but"
"in fact there's also a stable attractor"
"down here at the double head state and"
"amazingly enough"
"that's exactly what happens if you cut"
"these two-headed animals in perpetuity"
"as far as we can tell forever they will"
"continue to remake two-headed animals"
"now we can also re we can force the"
"voltage back to normal so what you have"
"here is the basic properties of a memory"
"it's long term stable"
"it's rewritable by brief uh transient"
"changes to the to the"
"real-time electric state and it has"
"discrete outcomes and um"
"i'm going to show you in a minute it has"
"latency but think about what this really"
"means again no genetic change it means"
that
the
"information about how many heads a"
"planarian is supposed to have is not"
"strictly speaking hardwired in the"
genome
"what the genome does is gives you a"
"really interesting piece of hardware"
"that by default"
"will have the dynamics that cause one"
"head but it's actually reprogrammable"
"and once you've made the change it's it"
"it stays it stores the new pattern and"
"is perfectly happy to to reproduce it"
"until you go back and you change it okay"
"so and so and so the latency that i'm"
"talking about is is seeing here"
"this is an even more more interesting i"
"think example here is a one-headed"
"planarian with the correct gene"
"expression only on one end uh and here's"
"what the voltage pattern looks like and"
"it makes a one-headed worm now this"
"planarian again normal anatomy normal"
"gene expression this guy makes a"
"two-headed worm now why why would that"
"be because in the meantime what we had"
"done is change this voltage pattern to"
"be duplicated like this now you can see"
"it's kind of messy the technology is"
"still being worked out but what's"
"amazing is that this bioelectric pattern"
"is not the map of this animal this"
"bioelectric pattern is the map of this"
"animal meaning that a single normal"
"planarian body can store at least one of"
"two target morphology representations of"
"what a correct planarian should look"
"like remember how we got here we're"
"looking for the bioelectric encoding of"
the
"state to which the cells are going to"
"work upon damage and i've shown you that"
"that can be rewritten to one or two"
"to one head or two heads and so"
"what's what this means is that uh the"
"bioelectricity is certainly not just a"
"readout of what the heads are doing"
"which you might conclude from this"
"experiment you might just say that while"
"the bioelectricity is just showing you"
"where the head would normally be no"
"actually this is the beginnings of a"
"counterfactual memory if you're"
"interested in basal cognition where do"
"our cognitive capacities come from this"
"is a very simple example of holding on"
"to a description of events that are not"
"true now"
"but they will be true if you get injured"
"and if you get injured this is the"
"pattern you're going to make okay and so"
"we are"
"making all kinds of uh uh uh"
"you know sort of conceptual efforts and"
"computational models to try to unify the"
"uh the biophysics of what goes on in"
"these electrical circuits and the state"
"space with approaches that people take"
"in artificial neural networks and other"
"connectionist kinds of"
"fields to really try to understand what"
"does it mean for a network to store"
"memory what does it mean to be able to"
"recover from error to regain information"
"once you're damaged and all of that"
"there's there's really amazing"
"isomorphisms here with with fields in"
"in in ai and robotics"
"now i've shown you you can make multiple"
"heads but you can actually go further"
"than this and you can as it turns out"
"you can make heads that belong to other"
"species of animals so here are"
"planarians with a triangular head for"
"about 48 hours you per you you cut off"
"the head and then for for a couple of"
"days you prevent the cells from"
"electrically communicating with each"
"other then you withdraw"
"the the"
"the agent that that blocks the gap"
"junctions and the"
"the animals regenerate uh to sometimes"
"to in a stochastic way sometimes to the"
"normal correct triangular shape but"
"sometimes they make round heads like"
"this s mediterranean or they make"
"flatheads like the pifilina now um"
"it's not only the head shape it's"
"actually the shape of the brain and the"
"distribution of stem cells that's"
"exactly like these other species and uh"
"the distance between this this guy and"
"these is about 150 million years"
"the frequency of getting these other"
"head shapes is proportional to"
"in fact the evolutionary distance"
"between these these animals so you can"
"see here that what you can do by by"
"blocking the ability of that electric"
"circuit to occupy the correct region of"
"morphospace you can actually force it uh"
"into other regions that evolution is"
"already found and is using them you know"
"so so these other attractors belonging"
"to so so when you cut you sort of raise"
"the temperature and then dynamical"
"systems speak you raise the temperature"
"of the system it comes back down but it"
"doesn't always come back down to the"
"correct um to the correct attractor"
"okay and you can go you can go beyond"
"this and you can actually reach regions"
"of amorphous space that as far as we"
"know evolution doesn't use probably"
"because they're not ecologically"
"competitive you can make standard uh"
"genetically wild-type planaria into"
"these um spiky forms into the"
"cylindrical so so radically change the"
"um the body plane uh symmetry type of"
"this animal or you know kind of"
"combination forms okay"
"and uh these you know all all of these"
"uh the the the point of all of this is"
"is twofold one is to understand where"
"body plants come from and how uh"
"collections of cells decide uh and"
"implement very specific outcomes under"
"perturbations and of course there's the"
"biomedical angle so so what we would"
"like to do is to communicate with these"
"uh cellular collectives and force them"
"to um or encourage them to"
"take on uh outcomes that are"
"biomedically useful so"
"so here for example is a frog frogs"
"don't regenerate their limbs unlike"
"salamanders very well uh at all you cut"
"and 45 days later there's nothing we"
"came up with a bioelectrical cocktail"
"that triggers a grow a leg here state"
"and what you see here is that you know"
"all the pro-regenerative uh genes start"
"to come on and immediately you start to"
"get uh toes and the toenail and"
"eventually a pretty respectable frog leg"
"and you can see here it's both um touch"
"sensitive and uh motile so this is just"
"this is just the beginning uh of this uh"
"of this of this work and in fact"
"uh in the most in the most recent uh"
"work which is going to uh going to come"
"out in a couple of weeks we show that a"
"24-hour stimulation of this um"
"of of the wound with a specific cocktail"
"gives you over a year of leg growth you"
"know again it's it's it's a it's a"
"trigger it's not a micromanagement we"
"don't know"
"we don't micromanage the leg over that"
"year you just leave it alone now one"
"interesting thing here is that and this"
"this is going to come up again in a"
"couple minutes"
"is that it actually uh can reach the"
"same goal by very different means so"
"when it regenerates this leg what you"
"notice is that it is not following the"
"normal developmental trajectory this is"
"not just a"
"a another a repeat walk through the"
"morphospace that i walked when it was"
"developing because this is what a normal"
"xenopus leg um how it normally develops"
"it's a paddle and and so on but this"
"develops much more like a plant it's"
"basically growing this this middle"
"structure and then off of it start to"
"branch these things so there's more than"
"one a path of course through amorphous"
"space and the system will find some"
"other way to get there now"
"and we'll get back to this shortly now"
"how much of this applies to beyond frog"
"and worm of course i've shown you lots"
"of examples of these things in in"
"so-called lower animal models"
"all of this is extremely highly"
"conserved evolution discovered all the"
"stuff around the time of bacterial"
"biofilms there's some beautiful work"
"showing bioelectric signaling and"
bacteria
"and uh human channelopathies tell us"
"that uh this is exactly what's where"
"that's been conserved all the way"
"through evolution so um human mutations"
"and various ion channels give birth"
"defects of"
"of anatomy and so we've done work in"
"human mses and cardiomyocytes and"
"you can control the kinds of things that"
"you can expect to do in vitro but i"
"think the true power of this thing is uh"
"is actually to set large-scale"
"anatomical structure not individual cell"
"types so this is not about making"
"specific types of cells out of stem"
"cells this is about setting large-scale"
"anatomy and so what we're doing now and"
"this is in collaboration with david"
"kaplan's lab at bme and our spinoff"
"company morphoceuticals inc we're"
"working to take what we've learned in"
"the frog and now into mammals so the"
"idea is can we use david's wearable"
"bioreactor to deliver an ion channel"
"drug payload to shift the um"
"the the the state of of of the wound"
"cells towards rebuilding a limb instead"
"of the normal you know protective"
"scarring and all of that and so stay"
"tuned for that we're still in uh in"
"progress there"
"so um"
"one thing that's important to point out"
"is is"
"which a lot of people ask about is the"
"molecular mechanisms now we we know for"
"example we know how the voltage changes"
"talk to the nucleus in other words how"
"does voltage change turn genes on and"
"off there's about um half a dozen known"
"transduction uh mechanisms so we know"
"that on a single cell level"
"and we know tons about the genes that"
"are downstream of this so so there are"
"conserved through frog axolotl and human"
"there are conserved downstream targets"
"of bioelectrical change which are all"
"the pathways that that you're familiar"
"with so so hedgehog notch bmp wind"
"fgf all of these things are downstream"
"right so so we know those molecular"
"details but this is what's important to"
"point out is that this is ultimately"
"very unsatisfying because what it"
"doesn't explain uh it explains the"
"single cell properties and that's and"
"that's nice but but what's left is"
"actually the large-scale decision-making"
"uh that is important to understand what"
"it's growing why it's remodeling and why"
"does it choose to stop and then this is"
"critical for the control problem as well"
"and so this is really similar to the"
"multi-scale problem in neuroscience"
"where yes you can track the individual"
"events at a single synapse or or even"
"you know a single um"
"single receptor neurotransmitter"
"receptor but what you'd really like to"
"understand are the large scale"
"properties such as decision making uh"
"perception goal directed behavior and so"
"on and so what we're trying to do is to"
"build these sort of full stack models"
"that go all the way from the molecular"
"network that tells you"
"which ion channels are going to be"
expressed
"then through the tissue level model that"
"shows that under specific um"
"electrical states how they form and how"
"they change over time and then all the"
"way to large scale anatomical patterns"
"of the whole body that will in turn"
"allow us to infer algorithmic types of"
"models which are uh which make it much"
"easier to to make rational changes right"
"so all of this has to basically um"
"we have to walk this whole this whole"
"path and we have these i mean there's"
"this amazing simulator for example"
"created by our allen center"
"member alexis pytak which allows you to"
"in every single cell run a model of an"
"electric circuit and ask global"
"questions like if you were to cut it"
"into pieces why does it in fact"
"re-establish the correct electric um"
"gradient in every little piece right so"
"these these sorts of scaling models in"
"this and scaling there are essential to"
"understand what's going on and the other"
"thing that's essential is machine"
"learning because the discovery of these"
"models and the discovery of the"
"interventions you know how to what do i"
"need to tweak in this particular circuit"
"to get it to do something different are"
"probably beyond in the general case"
"almost certainly beyond the capabilities"
"of humans to just look at the circuit"
"and say oh yes if i tweak these three"
"things then it's going to do the right"
"thing so what we've done is"
"we've developed some uh some some"
"machine learning tools to first of all"
"infer uh models that match behavior and"
"it would use you know functional"
"behavior like regeneration like"
"remodeling and so on so so infer this"
"not from big data sets like genomics or"
"transcriptomics but from functional data"
"sets that are in the literature as in i"
"changed this and this was the outcome"
"right so to learn from this and actually"
"try to make a model of what's going on"
"basically what uh what we scientists are"
"trying to do all the time and then uh"
"actually to to use those models to infer"
"interventions right what what which"
"nodes would you tweak and how to get"
"specific events to identify really"
"potent high-level control nodes such as"
"we found in the bioelectrics and so all"
"of these the software is all available"
"for free and there's there's papers um"
"that describe how to use it and so on"
"and so just as an example of this here"
"is a uh because it's really important to"
"understand that that this this field has"
"moved way beyond where we started um"
"almost 20 years ago in mapping the shape"
"of possible deformations that you can"
"make so this is not about making making"
"monsters or weird-looking frauds this is"
"about uh getting rational control over"
"growth and form so here you have a"
"normal tadpole here's the forebrain"
"midbrain and hindbrain and if you expose"
"these embryos in an early stage to"
"alcohol nicotine various um"
"teratogens or in fact mutate things like"
"very important genes like notch right"
"this important neurogenesis gene you get"
"a really uh powerful brain defect so the"
"forebrain is gone the midbrain and"
"hindbrain are basically a bubble the"
"animal has no behavior a terrible brain"
"defect so what we were able to do um"
"again in in collaboration was to uh with"
"with alexis paitak and and others was to"
"build a computational model of the"
"bioelectric pre-pattern that determines"
"the correct size and shape of the brain"
"look at the way that pre that"
"bioelectric pre-pattern is altered by"
"mutations by um by drug exposure and so"
"on and then ask the model a simple"
"question given that your voltage is"
"wrong which channels could i open and"
"close to get back to the correct state"
"now that's not anything that"
"in the general case that we'll be able"
"to do just by inspection you need"
"computational modeling for this and the"
"model actually told us there's a really"
"interesting particular ion channel that"
"what it would do is it would it would"
"serve as almost a contrast enhancer it"
"would it would it would sharpen the"
"borders that are really um in the in"
"these in these cases that are really"
"sort of wiped out and once it told us"
"that we simply went and found a drug an"
"existing drug a known drug that opens"
"that channel and sure enough it uh"
"amazingly it it actually uh does exactly"
"what the model predicts and it rescues"
"not only brain structure so here's the"
"normal brain but brain gene expression"
"and function their iq they get their"
"learning rates back to individual to"
"levels um indistinguishable from from"
"from the wild type controls so this is"
"to me this is kind of a really a"
"striking example of of using machine"
"learning to"
"uh to infer very actionable"
"interventions that"
uh
"induce outcomes that we would have never"
"been able to micromanage right of the"
"brain is a very very complex thing so"
"this i think is is kind of the future of"
"this field is to use to to develop"
"software tools to design electroceutical"
"cocktails so that you start with a"
"disease state you you use the model to"
"ask what channels and pumps can be"
"targeted to uh to fix it and then uh you"
"use the the the massive toolkit of"
"available already human approved ion"
"channel drugs to uh to try to try to"
"help you to reverse it and so we we have"
"already this is in collaboration with"
"jack duczynski's lab"
"we already have um so the beginnings of"
"the software that you can go and and"
"play with that will help you take your"
"uh cell tissues of interest and look to"
"see what your various control knobs are"
"and which drugs actually uh can be used"
"to target them and uh and this is this"
"this computational part is is really"
"what needs the most effort now"
"so so that's that's where i think a lot"
"of the the the merger of of of"
"biophysics and uh and machine learning"
"is is where it's going so in the last uh"
"few minutes i just want to"
"and talk a little bit about what what i"
"think the future um holds beyond uh"
"regenerative medicine and here this is"
"this is the information that i think"
"might be of of interest to roboticists"
"and and computer science folks"
"um i want to show you a new model"
"organism so here it is it's it's aqueous"
"it's moving through a um a"
"volume of water with some particles in"
"it and so so there it is you can see"
"here they have different kinds of"
"motions they can go in circles they can"
"go back and forth uh and and sort of"
patrol
"certain lengths of areas here's some"
"tracking data"
"looking at them uh interacting with each"
"other right so this one's going on kind"
"of a long journey these are interacting"
"with each other so so they have all"
"kinds of movement um"
"through the water the way they move is"
"they have cilia they have these little"
"hairs that uh propel them through the"
"water here's an example of one doing a"
"maze so"
"it moves this is a still water maze"
"there's no water flow here so it moves"
"forward it takes the corner without"
"bumping into the opposite wall at this"
"point for whatever internal reason uh it"
"uh it decides that there's nothing here"
"and goes back where it came from so"
"again just one more time so there are no"
"gradients by the way this is just pure"
"water so it goes it goes forward and"
"there's some internal dynamics that at"
"some point cause it to uh turn around"
"and go back okay it also has the"
"capability of self-healing so here after"
"it's been cut basically almost in half"
"right it's it look at the force that it"
"generates through that hinge just to to"
"to come and fold itself back up into the"
"original shape and in fact um"
"what these what these flashes that"
"you've been seeing are this is this is"
"imaging calcium signaling so this is uh"
"exactly what you would look what you"
"would see if you were to look down with"
"calcium signaling on various types of"
"brains and nervous systems um this is"
"all the this is a uh kind of a readout"
"of the computations that the the cell"
"network is doing the interesting thing"
"here is that there is there are no"
"neurons here this is just skin these are"
"these are just um"
"uh epidermal cells and what i what i've"
"been showing you the in case you're"
"wondering what what this is what animal"
"this is this is a this is a proto"
"organism that's never existed on earth"
"before this is a this is a zenobot and"
"the way that xenobots are made they're"
"named this because xenopus lavis is the"
"name of the frog and then it's a kind of"
"biobot what happens is we take and we we"
"take an early um"
"frog animal uh frog embryo we take the"
"animal cap cells which are the skin uh"
"the faded to be skin up here we"
"dissociate them put them into a little"
"pile and whoops and uh"
"we basically give them the opportunity"
to
"re-boot their multicellularity so we ask"
"a simple question if i take standard"
"cells with no genomic editing no"
"transgenes i take standard cells"
"liberate them from the normal influence"
"of their neighbors that are telling them"
"to be skin and sit quietly on the"
"outside of the of the tadpole and keep"
"out the bacteria and i put them in a new"
"environment and and they get the chance"
"to to see what they will do now"
"they could have done many things they"
"could have formed a flat monolayer they"
"could have crawled off they could have"
died
"many things they could have done what"
"instead they do is they work together"
"they they call us and uh i'm going to"
"play this again they coalesce and they"
"actually over the period of about 48"
"hours they come together and they"
"actually form this this new kind of"
"creature this the xenobot that has"
"spontaneous motion um it has the ability"
"to uh to to to self-heal and to do"
"various things that i don't have time to"
"go into now the amazing thing is that"
"these xenobots have a completely normal"
"frog genome if you didn't know what they"
"were and you came across one you might"
"be tempted to sequence the genome to see"
"what animal you're dealing with and all"
"you would see is 100 normal frog"
"and one of the interesting things about"
"it is that these zeniba the the xenobot"
"bodies in their behavioral repertoires"
"have no straightforward evolutionary"
"backstory normally if you have an animal"
"and you ask well why does it jump and"
"why is it a certain color and why does"
"it have you know different sensory"
"capacities the answer is always the same"
"well because for millions of years its"
"ancestors were were honed and selected"
"for these particular properties xenobots"
"never existed before and uh within 48"
"hours they take they're able to take"
their
"their genomically specified hardware"
"things like their their cilia and"
"various other other uh capacities and to"
"use them in a completely novel way to be"
"a new kind of uh coherent organism in a"
"new environment and solve problems"
"morphological problems behavioral"
"problems that um"
"that that is completely new that they"
"were never uh directly selected for and"
"so i think"
"and their cognitive capacities we don't"
"know we we're still we're just starting"
"to understand you know do they have"
"memory do they have preferences what can"
"they actually do i mean their skin"
"we think they could probably do a lot"
"but we don't know yet um what i think"
"this is telling us much like the many"
"other examples i showed you such as the"
"tadpoles that still make a normal frog"
"even from a scrambled position"
"evolution maybe isn't just finding"
"solutions to specific environments and"
"specific fitness functions what it seems"
"to do is create hardware that exploits"
"the laws of physics and the laws of"
"computation to solve problems in new"
"ways so here for example is the the"
"developmental sequence so so here's the"
genome
"and it can go probably many different"
"ways but here are two ways that we know"
"these cells can go they can make a nice"
"embryo so here's a nice frog embryo at"
"the organogenesis nurula kind of stage"
"that makes a tadpole and then here are"
"the tackles running around and doing"
things
"or these same"
"some of these same cells can go here and"
"they make a xenobot that looks like this"
"if you let it grow and you feed it and"
"you sort of let it develop it it"
"acquires this this interesting new weeks"
"later it requires this interesting new"
"shape that doesn't look like anything in"
"the normal frog"
"sequence and then you and it makes"
"xenobots that have different behaviors"
"and one of the behaviors it has"
"is it can make more xenobots so um what"
"happens is uh this is this is uh the"
"latest paper that just came out on"
"kinematic self-replication what happens"
"is if you"
"put loose uh"
"loose cells of which the xenobots are"
"made in the environment what the"
"xenomorphs will do is actually go around"
"and collect them into piles okay so you"
"can see here it forms these little piles"
"and then as the piles get bigger it sort"
"of just uh it sort of keeps um working"
to
"to make them bigger and bigger um and uh"
"and and they can make multiple"
"generations and so so we've seen them"
"make several generations bots make bots"
"and the new bots that they make will"
"also go around and collect the remaining"
"cells and make new bots again in several"
"generations so what you can see here is"
that
"we take these skin cells we liberate"
"them from their normal environment but"
"we also make it impos so we don't add"
"anything but we take away some some"
"constraining influences with the rest of"
"the cells and in particular we take away"
"their ability to"
"uh to reproduce in the normal way"
and
"keeping on this theme of of of getting"
"to the same goal through completely"
"different means they've apparently found"
"a way to at least partially replicate"
"in in a very different way that that"
"neither they nor as far as we know no"
"animal does this make copies of itself"
"when the normal way of reproduction is"
"not available to them okay so this whole"
"this whole angle i think is is very new"
"and interesting"
"how does evolution give rise to machines"
"that solve novel novel problems that not"
"only they've never seen before but"
"neither has uh you know that"
"evolutionary lineage right where does"
"that novelty come from"
"so um this this is uh there are many"
"examples here in biology right we know"
"that if you amputate at different levels"
"it will grow only what it needs in this"
"case if this is a this is a kidney"
"tubule in a newt a cross section if you"
"make the cells gigantic they will still"
"make the same lumen if they're big they"
"would just use fewer cells if they're"
"very big a single cell will wrap around"
"itself and make the exact same large"
"scale structure so different lower level"
"molecular mechanisms in this case cell"
"to cell interactions in this case"
"cytoskeletal bending can be called up in"
"the service of a large scale anatomical"
"need so incredible uh robustness and"
"plasticity two changes in the parts"
"right we don't have any robotics where"
"you can just go in and make the parts"
"all different sizes and everything still"
"works because the parts come together in"
"different ways"
"and this by the way is one good"
"definition of intelligence by william"
"james which is the ability to reach the"
"same goal by different means so this is"
"what i mean when i say that these things"
"are solving problems as a collective"
"intelligence but it's not just about"
"behavior in three-dimensional space and"
"it's not just about uh the body"
"structure in in anatomical amorphous"
"space cells and tissues also solve"
"problems in transcriptional spaces right"
"and we have some very interesting"
"examples i haven't had time to talk"
about
"and of course in physiological spaces"
"which are all of these spaces are highly"
"high dimensional i'm just boiling it"
"down to two and in fact even even some"
"even really deterministic simple things"
"like gene regulatory networks in fact"
"have the ability to learn from their"
"from their experience um several"
"different kinds of learning including"
"associative learning and uh and you can"
"see some of that here and so"
"what's what i think is important is that"
um
"not only is biology multi-scale and"
"everybody knows this right the the the"
"the swarm is made of individuals which"
"is made of which are made of organs of"
"tissues of molecular networks not just"
"structurally are we a set of nested"
"dolls but functionally every layer is"
"its own local intelligence building"
"and solving problems in various spaces"
"whether they be behavioral space or"
"anatomical space or even the"
"transcriptional space and so on"
"every step uh every every every level of"
"organization contains its own"
"goal-directed ability to solve uh"
"various problems and it's the"
"interaction between those those agents"
and
"within the same level in a cross level"
"that gives a that gives biology this"
"incredible plasticity we call this a"
"multi-scale architecture and we think"
"that um you know this is the the fact"
"that our robotics doesn't have this is"
"first why robots don't get cancer right"
"so i i've given talks called why robots"
"don't get cancer this is why because our"
"our engineering tends to be single level"
"we the the robot is smart the individual"
"parts tend not to be that's not how"
"biology works and um"
"and the other the other implication of"
"all this is that uh it enables this kind"
"of problem-solving in novel"
"circumstances now and just two two more"
"two more quick things um"
"what's happening in the future is that"
"knowing that that biology is multi-scale"
"in this"
"it has this this multi-scale competency"
"what we can do in engineering is replace"
"any level of a biological system we can"
"replace the materials the individual"
"cells tissues"
"with other materials which are somewhere"
"on this plane of"
"evolved or designed right so they could"
"be natural they could be they could be"
"engineered and has some degree of uh of"
"of of a computational capacity it could"
"be a passive material or could be a"
"really complex"
"kind of thing and all of these different"
"things uh can be"
"our you know we're already seeing this"
"this kind of um hybridization so they're"
"already humans that uh drive wheelchairs"
"with their with their brain activity and"
"and are integrated with uh with various"
"pumps and things and um all of this"
basically
"suggests that the familiar"
"uh range of of of beautiful diversity in"
"the biosphere what darwin called endless"
"forms most beautiful really is just a"
"tiny corner of the option space of"
"what's actually possible hybrids and"
"cyborgs and every possible combination"
"of evolved materials designed materials"
"and software"
"is some kind of a coherent agent in this"
"in this enormous space of possible"
"bodies and minds and so this has this"
"has massive implications for"
"understanding uh understanding biology"
"beyond the sort of n equals one example"
"that we're given by um the path of life"
"on earth and it has implications for for"
"ethics and how we relate to organisms"
"that don't look anything like us and in"
"fact don't have the same kind of origin"
"story that we do so i just want to close"
here
"and and just sort of summarize what what"
"i've said uh but biology is is solving"
"problems in many different spaces and"
"that's intelligence and uh the the"
"intelligence being the competent"
"traversal of these spaces is much older"
"than brains and this kind of multi-scale"
"competency architecture is what provides"
"robustness plasticity and evolvability"
"there's this physiological layer of"
"software that sits between the genetics"
"and the anatomy it's the computational"
"medium of this conductive intelligence"
"it is how individual cells bind their"
"activities towards a larger purpose it's"
"through this this electrical network and"
"possibly chemical of course and"
"biomechanical that remains to be steady"
"and we now have the ability to rewrite"
"these pattern memories in vivo to"
"reprogram uh the the behaviors of this"
"collective agent in morphospace to make"
"heads and eyes and limbs and um new ai"
"tools are coming online to help us uh to"
"help us address all of this and we'll"
"have massive implications in"
"regenerative medicine but also as uh"
"inspirations for um for novel ai"
"platforms that are not based on brain"
"architectures and"
"new new regenerative medicine roadmaps"
"where we will work on incentivizing new"
"anatomical goal states to rewire the um"
"uh the the not not to rewire the actual"
"machinery but to simply uh uh to change"
"the goal states towards which uh these"
"cells work so i'll stop there i want to"
"thank the uh the postdocs and uh um and"
"students who have who have done all the"
"work our collaborators um always thank"
"the animals because they do all the"
"heavy lifting for the discoveries uh"
"that that come forward um the funding"
"support of the people that have"
"supported this work again um two"
"disclosures and um yeah i thank you for"
"listening um if anybody's interested in"
"the details um there are some papers"
"here that kind of go over the bigger"
"conceptual things and in case you're"
"wondering what two-headed planaria are"
"like and what they do in their spare"
"time this is this is a video for them"
"this is uh these some people have called"
"these impossible objects so here they"
"are so yeah thank you and i'll take any"
questions
"brilliant thank you so much michael that"
"was absolutely amazing talk it's"
"mind-blowing the range of things that"
"you've explored and some of the things"
"you've found and stuff like that i'm"
"joined now by uh professor steve mann"
"who's going to help man a couple"
"questions we've got time i think the two"
"or three questions so steve is there any"
"that you've particular favorites that"
"have come up or do you have any yourself"
"that you'd like to ask michael there"
"were a couple on on the slider which i"
should
"try and put to michael uh"
"i mean the first one which came up was"
"really about the picasso tadpole"
"and uh how did you construct that in the"
"first place"
"yeah the easiest way there are many ways"
"to do it but but the easiest way and"
"what we did was to simply uh change the"
"electrical pattern in that early"
"electric face that i showed you so so"
"that in fact is what happens if you you"
"can use"
"optogenetics you can use drugs you can"
"inject channels but if you disturb the"
"uh the electrical pattern uh the whole"
"face will be will be disrupted and so"
"you can put the eye anywhere you want"
"you put the jaws anywhere you want"
"that's that's how we did it okay yeah"
"there's another question here about"
"uh do you think you can extrapolate"
"these findings to more complex organisms"
"you know like plants or you know to"
"induce flowers for example"
"are we still a long way from that"
"um well i mean i don't know you know"
"more complex i i i think"
"it's not trivial to argue that plants"
"are in some way more complex than frogs"
"i mean that's that you know we can"
"discuss that but um i think the level of"
"complexity once you get beyond uh uh you"
"know early uh bilaterians uh the"
"complexity is all is all there and in"
"fact even even the human channelopathies"
"are telling us that you know all the way"
"across the tree of life this is this is"
"uh this is well conserved so yeah i"
"think um and and we're you know we're"
"betting that that our regenerative"
"therapies in the limb uh limb"
"regeneration space will show that yeah"
"we can we can we can do this in uh in"
"very complex"
"kinds of contexts whether this can be"
"done in plants probably there are people"
"who do work on bioelectricity and plants"
"and so um i i expect it to be possible"
yeah
"that's great and then just question"
"about evolution uh somebody asks uh how"
"does evolution fit"
"into this approach does it indirectly"
"interact with higher level software or"
"and how might it affect the quotation"
"marks language defining this"
"yeah yeah that's a super interesting"
"question so so we've studied the two two"
"aspects of this the first the first is"
"um how does evolution uh shape the"
"electrical networks that that have these"
"these interesting properties i think i"
"think one uh"
"important way to think about this whole"
"thing is is the hardware software"
"distinction in computer science and you"
"know you have to be careful with these"
"and i'm certainly not arguing that um"
"that biology is like the computers that"
"we use today but the the hardware"
"software analogy is important because i"
"think what evolution is doing is it's uh"
"is it's modifying the hardware so"
"evolution gives us novel ion channels"
"that have interesting properties for"
"example some ion channels are themselves"
"voltage sensitive they're voltage-gated"
"this means that it's a voltage gated ion"
"conductance which means it's basically a"
"transistor right so once you have that"
"once evolution discovers that you can"
"immediately make feedback loops you can"
"make memory you can make logic gates and"
"then you can make anything you want so"
"so i think what evolution does is it"
"shapes the hardware in a particular way"
"that once the the power is turned on so"
"to speak and the system is alive"
"it will reliably and robustly"
"achieve a particular set of dynamics and"
"that's the normal this is why you know"
"frog eggs normally make frogs and fish"
"eggs make fish is because what evolution"
"has done is uh is to hone the hardware"
"so that it reliably has a default"
"outcome now it turns out that what it's"
"also done is created a system that is"
"much more clever and is and is"
"rewritable and and how that evolves is"
"is a fantastic open question we're just"
"starting to investigate it but what we"
"do know is that it's very likely that"
"that kind of architecture and that kind"
"of plasticity"
"is actually really good for evolvability"
"itself so it makes it much easier to"
"evolve things i mean think about"
"uh the fact that the fact that these"
"things are not hardwired but in fact"
"can pursue anatomical goals despite"
"changes think about how how much that"
"impacts evolvability it means that if"
"you have a mutation that does something"
"nice but it also moves your eye you know"
"a little bit off"
"evolution can now reap all the benefits"
"the positive benefits of that mutation"
"because the eye will find its way back"
"to where it's supposed to be right so it"
"smooths the fitness landscape and it"
"makes it much easier to evolve so i"
"think it's this interplay um you know of"
"of evolution honing the hardware but"
"that architecture actually makes"
"evolution much more powerful"
"and when things go wrong there's a"
"question here about the role of"
"bioelectrics in cancer"
"solid tumor growth for example"
"and could such processes be be"
"electrically drugged"
"most certainly and so so we have we have"
"a lot of work on uh the electrical"
"control of cancer cancer can be"
"uh induced and suppressed in uh in in"
"vivo by bioelectric changes that do not"
"require any mutations any any"
"carcinogens any of that so we have we"
"have normalized uh tumors induced by by"
human
"oncogenes in uh in frogs so we've we've"
"shown how that works in frogs we are now"
"moving it to human cells so we have"
"projects ongoing in the lab i think it's"
"absolutely awesome yeah"
"and the question here which i find"
"fascinating as well is"
"the person asks is there temporal"
"rewiring for example acceleration"
"happening as well while keeping the"
"spatial morphologies you know can you"
"accelerate limb growth for example yeah"
"yeah it's a good question uh we don't"
"know um i think you know on a clinical"
"at a clinical level you can sort of"
"think that worst case scenario if the"
"limbs take as long as they normally do"
"someone who loses their limb in an"
"accident in their 20s will have uh you"
"know a seven-year-old's arm"
"you know within seven years and and and"
"you know children's arms are extremely"
"usable right you can do anything you"
"need and then eventually you know"
"eventually you'll have a normal normal"
"arm so um i think biomedically i think"
"uh it's it's fi it's okay but but but"
"it would be nice to know if time um time"
"is under these controls i we don't know"
"we don't know that yet"
"great tom do you have any questions"
"this is a question i had when i was when"
"i was listening to what you were talking"
"about so you kind of mentioned how"
"conserved a lot of these processes are"
"and that was something you highlighted"
"but i was i was wondering obviously the"
"starting point that you're beginning"
"from the actual the cells that you're"
"choosing to work with"
"i'm just wondering how much of an effect"
"they have on what capacity you have to"
"explore different functionalities these"
"things might happen whether you're doing"
"any work to look at what organisms you"
"might want to target based on something"
"about how they're actually"
"i don't know the niche that they live in"
"in the how evolution might have shaped"
"some of the actual hardware and software"
"in different ways yeah yeah no that's"
"that's a that's a very good point and we"
"have a zoo in the lab we have all kinds"
"of cells that we work with and i think"
"that i think that the fact that you can"
"make xenobots out of wild-type cells and"
"you can make worms with other head types"
"suggests that uh there's there's a huge"
"amount of plasticity in what you can do"
"with specific cells but there may be"
"advantages to using certain cells for"
"certain reasons and we are also i'm"
"really interested in chimerism and"
"building uh composite uh you know"
"building collective intelligences that"
"are made of very different subunits that"
"have never worked together before right"
"and so what happens when you you know"
"what happens when you have a set of"
"cells that that want to make a"
"particular anatomy and they're mixed up"
"with a bunch of cells that want to make"
"a completely different anatomy right"
"what is that collective agent going to"
"try to do and that has that has a lot of"
"implications so um we're we're"
"investigating it"
"you know it kind of it this is almost"
"like an idea that you could have i'm a"
"computer scientist so i'm thinking of"
"like you could have evolution could have"
"developed these separate programming"
"languages in a way that evolved but we"
"don't see them like that and whether"
"they actually exist and what might how"
"implications that might have for the"
"sorts of capable capabilities absolutely"
"absolutely yeah cool"
"um steve i don't know we've probably got"
"time for one more question i think"
because
"we're running over time and then steve"
"did you have anything yeah i'll ask one"
"of my own questions then yeah so michael"
"what about the set point what controls"
"that i mean as you emphasize it you know"
"finishing finishing the job is really"
"important making sure you know when"
"you've got the five uh five digits and"
"it's the cert and the and proportions"
"and so on and the scalar"
"proportions what what defines the set"
"point and and where is that where's the"
"feedback of that becoming coming at that"
"at that stage"
"yeah um"
"so so we we can see these set points uh"
"in the bioelectrical of distributions"
"and and the question is where where does"
"it come from in the first place so"
we
"we we see them arising all the way from"
"uh singles and at least in the frog you"
"can track them from the single cell and"
"one and i think this goes back to the"
"question about evolution so what"
"evolution does you can imagine a an"
"electric circuit where uh what happens"
"is the parts are selected such that when"
"the when the power is turned on it has a"
"default behavior it has a stable"
"stable pattern that it settles into"
"and uh that's what i think evolution has"
"done is it's given a bunch of ion"
"channels such that there's"
"self-organization there's symmetry"
"breaking and self-organization like"
"touring patterns you can sort of think"
"about it that that with with if under"
"normal conditions uh the electric"
"circuit will settle in a particular"
"pattern with you know depolarized over"
"here hyper-polarized over here and now"
"you get a head tail axis that kind of"
"thing and and i think that's that's part"
"of what evolution does is it is it helps"
"pick parts that uh under under normal"
"circumstances reliably uh settle into"
"the desired initial part so there's a"
"lot of there's a lot of symmetry"
"breaking and self-organizing principles"
"here but but is that big because you you"
"reach a point of sort of steady state is"
"it is it energy that really is defining"
"it the energy distribution across the"
"organism it's"
"in non-equilibrium states of course"
"yeah some some of the patterns i mean"
"you can think about it this way imagine"
"imagine two cells um"
"and there's uh they express a um a"
"voltage-gated ion channel right so let's"
"say let's say one of the cells is a"
"little bit depolarized well that opens"
"the channel so that makes it more"
"depolarized which opens the channel and"
"so that drives this positive feedback"
"loop and it gets really depolarized and"
"eventually uh it'll just settle to the"
"lowest you know the lowest"
"depolarization that it can and it will"
"sit here sit there until something new"
"comes along maybe this cell signals it"
"in a way that causes it to close the"
"channel again and now the thing gets"
"reset but if that doesn't happen it"
"reaches us it reaches a stable point"
"right so all of these bioelectric uh"
"circuits have have you know stable"
"attractors at stake"
"great thank you"
"brilliant so i think in the interest of"
"time i'd love to just sit and chat about"
"questions around this for all afternoon"
"but unfortunately we can't do that but i"
"just want to thank you again michael for"
"a really fascinating talk it's brilliant"
"to learn about some of your recent"
"discoveries and um thank everyone for"
"attending and thanks steve also for"
"helping to fill the field the questions"
"so with that i'll bring bring this"
"session to a close"
"thank you very much everybody i'll see"
"you soon"
thanks
"awesome thank"
