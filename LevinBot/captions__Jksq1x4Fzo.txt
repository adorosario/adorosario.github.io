"so welcome athena actropists and michael"
"levin to this episode of the science of"
"the noah's fear"
series
"this series is inspired by pierre"
"trejard chardonn and his concept of the"
"noah sphere which is like the thinking"
"the mental dimension"
"of humanity"
"which he said originated as tiny grains"
"of thought with small scale"
um
"society and then was enlarging to"
"ultimately encompass the entire"
"earth as some kind of global"
consciousness
"and the purpose of the series is to"
"actually place this concept on a solid"
"scientific foundation"
"and that maps on to a concept that you"
"know well major evolutionary transitions"
"in individuality"
"so you might or might not know much"
"about taihard but you know a lot about"
"major transitions and we'll be focusing"
on
"on the single cell and"
multicellularity
as
as
"those particular transitions well let's"
begin
"just by uh first of all having you"
"introduce yourself as people how you"
"wandered into this kind of work and"
"and how you"
"encountered the work of ti heart if at"
"all so athena why don't you begin"
"and then we'll pass to michael"
"well so for me i've been just fascinated"
"by the idea of major transitions really"
"from the time that i was in my late"
"teens so this notion that you know you"
"have levels of organization that where"
"you get sort of regulation of"
"cooperation and then that allows you to"
"build additional levels and additional"
"levels um has"
"has been really a foundation of my"
"thinking from the very beginning um so"
the
"the notion that you know there is this"
"sort of layer of um"
"sort of collective cognition that's"
"happening in humanity to me it's a"
"reflection of the fact that you know on"
"sort of all of these different levels"
"you have computation and information"
"processing happening in surprising"
"places and sometimes it's decentralized"
"sometimes it's more centralized"
"but you you do have this sort of"
unexpected
"um prevalence of information processing"
"happening everywhere"
"yeah totally michael how about you yeah"
"um well i guess uh all of my work uh"
"probably uh stems from two kind of"
"foundational um experiences that i had"
"as a kid and one of those was uh looking"
"inside the back of a tv set this is like"
"one of those giant old-school tv sets"
"with the vacuum tubes and uh thinking"
"about the process that led to somebody"
"knowing how to put all those things in"
"there at just the right you know in just"
"the right configuration to have"
"something interesting happen and"
"conversely uh playing with bugs and"
"insects outdoors and and asking the"
"basically the same question right is"
"that you know now you've got a different"
"type of uh of creature that probably has"
"some sort of internal perspective and"
"goals and preferences and so on and just"
"asking these uh really fundamental"
"questions about what it means to have"
"some sort of a body that is made up of"
"parts but nevertheless it has a kind of"
"a centralized um you know is is the"
"subject of of of collective memories and"
"preferences and and goals and so on um"
"yeah and so so my background is"
"originally computer science i got a"
"degree uh an undergrad degree in"
"computer science trying to uh work in in"
"artificial intelligence and then uh did"
"biology uh hoping to really understand"
"the decisions that cellular collectives"
"make as a kind of um you know"
"morphogenetic process if you're viewing"
"morphogenesis as the behavior of a"
"collective intelligence michael while"
"you were staring at the back of the tv"
"screen i was staring at the front of the"
"tv screen when i was like four i was"
absolutely
"like most people like most people"
"yeah well there were two things i was"
"obsessed with the first one was that"
"movie um annie because it was like just"
"the best musical amazing choreography"
"and the other was the nova special about"
"morphogenesis i would watch that over"
"and over and over again and i think like"
"that's really like where my fascination"
"with like emergence and multicellularity"
"really started was just like watching"
"that over and over and i was like asking"
"my parents like how"
does
"it do that and you know they sort of"
"like gave me like vague answers well"
"it's like chemical gradients and gene"
"expression and i was like but how how"
"does it know to do that so"
"so yeah"
"definitely spent many many hours when i"
"was four watching that over and over and"
"over so one memorable thing that tay"
"hard said was that although in some"
respects
"we're just another ape species little"
"different than other apes"
"in other respects were a new"
"evolutionary process cultural evolution"
"and that makes the origin of our species"
"is significant in its own way"
"as the origin of life and to take that"
seriously
"requires actually knowing a lot about"
"the origin of life and biological levels"
"of organization in order to compare"
"human levels of organization"
"and when we get to the single cell"
"many people have thought that that's"
"relatively simple that the history of"
"life has been one of increasing"
complexification
"and i think that"
"one of the"
"where your work stands out"
"is in demonstrating that no no i mean"
"the complexity of a single cell"
"and the first multicellular organisms is"
absolutely
"amazing so life itself in its"
"first forms"
"has an extraordinary form of"
"of of complexity including a form of"
mentality
"a form of mentality and even a form of"
"group level mentality so a lot that's"
"associated with the knowledge sphere in"
humans
"can be"
"understood at the very initial stages of"
"life and so i've stated this"
"um very crudely you guys are the experts"
"and michael why don't you begin just"
"kind of elaborating on"
"on that theme"
"the complexity of the single cell"
"and then athena uh uh"
"took over so michael yeah so so maybe"
"i'll just uh sketch a little bit how i"
"tend to think about these things so"
"one thing that i'm interested in is"
"uh trying to come up with a framework"
"that is able to handle in a um in a very"
"practical way in terms of empirically"
"driving research and so on truly diverse"
"intelligences and so so i'm interested"
"in what is the invariant between all"
"intelligent things no matter what their"
"embodiment is no matter what their"
"providence is evolved designed"
"exobiological artificial whatever and so"
"in doing that um and this is this is a"
"framework i've called tame t-a-m-e for"
"technological approach to mind"
"everywhere um what what i take to be"
"central about intelligence is problem"
"solving in some particular space and in"
particular
"uh this idea that that we recognize"
"agents ourselves or individuals and we"
"can compare them no matter what they're"
"made of or how they got here by the"
"scale of goals that they can pursue so"
"to me the fundamental uh building block"
"of all of this is some sort of goal"
"directedness and it can be as humble as"
"a homeostatic loop keeping a metabolic"
"state which you know even even bacteria"
"can do or it can be very large scale"
"things and so the spatio-temporal scale"
"of the goals that you are"
"capable of pursuing right and so maybe"
"very small in case of a microbe you know"
"local concentration of sugar or"
"something or could be very large in the"
"case of of humans and we could talk"
"about the transition to the very special"
"transition to humans"
"in terms of the goals that they can uh"
"pursue uh is is is what to me is is"
"central and so when you look at it that"
"way uh in fact we we see evolution as a"
"a process that can scale"
"uh that can scale cognitive selves from"
"from very humble local goals to large"
"scale goals first like making an organ"
"making a whole body and then of course"
"behavioral goals in in three-dimensional"
"space and uh we see a very smooth"
"process of um"
"of scaling these goals throughout um"
"throughout evolution and so i see bodies"
as
"these these overlapping nested"
"communities of cells with local goals in"
"various spaces so in physiological space"
"and transcriptional space and metabolic"
"space of course anatomical morphospace"
"so to me morphogenesis like"
"developmental morphogenesis regeneration"
"those kinds of things are the process of"
"the collective intelligence of cells"
"operating in morphospace in the"
"anatomical amorphous space so i think"
"yeah i think i think intelligence"
"defined operationally in that way it"
"goes all the way back to the beginning"
"and what we see is it's scaling uh"
"through through evolution michael i'm"
"curious you know just listening to you"
"talk about this idea of like the sort of"
"nested goals i can't help but think"
"about you know human groups and the the"
"challenges of sort of getting lots of"
"people on the same page with goals um or"
"even if people have the same goals"
"getting them all pointed in the right"
"direction at the same time almost like"
"you know thinking of like a organ trying"
"to develop right it's like it's not"
"enough for them to all have the same you"
"know dna everything everyone has to be"
"in the same expression state or in the"
"right expression state right in order to"
"accomplish a shared goal so so like when"
"you think about humans"
"having goals together do these same"
"principles apply or are there things"
"that sort of change when you go to the"
"level of thinking about humans"
"yeah they have a very interesting"
"question so so i think i think looking"
"for scale-free principles that might"
"carry over from from subcellular"
"networks through cells to human"
"societies um collectives you know ants"
"and and bees and these kinds of things"
"is is very important i think that i mean"
"i'm i'm in no way an expert on so you"
"know societies and and you know kind of"
"human activities um"
"but uh i think we can see something very"
"interesting happen in in the cellular"
"case and i think the cellular case is"
"very instructive for how this scaling"
"happens and i think i think actually i'm"
"really looking forward to talking to you"
"about the cancer aspects of this because"
"i think it's actually very foundational"
"there what will happen is and this is"
"this is what we've observed is that"
"you have individual cells which are"
"themselves competent in their local"
"spaces so they solve transcriptional"
"problems physiological problems"
"basically homeostatic units they're"
"trying to keep certain things in in"
parameter
"their evolution discovered a really"
"interesting uh thing fairly early on"
"which is which which we call a gap"
"junction this is a an electrical synapse"
"and the thing that's magical about these"
"gap junctions is that uh unlike if you"
"imagine traditional signaling"
"extracellular you know secreted i"
"secrete some sort of chemical and it"
"goes over and hits this other cell when"
"you have two cells one signaling to the"
"other because these signals come from"
"the outside the recipient cell knows"
"very clearly that these generated"
"that these originated from the outside"
"so it can ignore them it can do"
"something about them it can remember"
"them whatever"
"when two cells couple to each other with"
"these gap junctions what happens is that"
"the signals propagate to some extent"
"directly into the intercellular miliar"
"from one cell to another and what"
"happens then is because these signals"
"don't have any kind of metadata on them"
"that says where did they come from they"
"they the ownership information is wiped"
"so that when you have two cells that are"
"tightly coupled by gab junctions one"
"cell let's say gets injured or has some"
"new experience it generates a calcium"
"spike that uh appears in the other cell"
"that second cell cannot tell whether"
"this is its own memory or some other"
"memory of some other creature basically"
"this connection by by wiping ownership"
information
"that kind of connection creates an"
"almost mind meld where you can't tell"
"where your memories and and some other"
"memories begin and when this happens in"
"a large network you end up you end up"
"making these electrical networks that"
"can that have the computational capacity"
"to measure remember and uh and store"
"goal states that are huge ones that a"
"single cell couldn't possibly um you"
"know we're talking bacteria here just to"
"let everyone know so i mean you've uh"
"some of what i've written uh i've got of"
"yours uh michael"
"talks about biofilms basically bacterial"
"biofilms as"
"as superorganisms so among the"
"superorganisms we all know about the"
"eusocial insects but now we have these"
microbial
"biofilms which which really do qualify"
as
"superorganisms complete with the analog"
"of nervous systems so talk to us about"
"about um that just to nail down this"
"idea that that"
"of the complexity of before we even get"
"to nucleated cells"
"of uh bacterial"
"uh biothumbs tell us some stories about"
that
"there's some some beautiful work from"
"from um"
"ucsd looking at uh"
"electrical signaling in bacterial"
"biofilms as very brain-like and i think"
"that's been this isn't our work and this"
"is uh i think because evolution"
"discovered very early on that electrical"
"networks are a great way to uh to scale"
"and propagate and coordinate information"
"to store memories they're just very"
"convenient it's no accident that the"
"nervous system uses them that we use"
"them for"
"computer technology but but you know in"
"in in the body what happens is that"
"these these networks are now capable of"
"storing um much larger types of"
"gold state information"
"and and the individuality of the even"
"of the of the components is is wiped to"
"go and you know sort of erase to an"
"important extent because now these you"
"have memories you have goals and um"
"activities that are property of the"
"collective that individual the"
"individuals couldn't do and so just to"
"get back to athena's comment about the"
"the humanity i think one you know from"
"the perspective of uh coordinating"
"morphogenesis and avoiding cancer these"
"kinds of these kind of gap junctional"
"connections are really critical and one"
"might be tempted to say look the way to"
"scale goals and make sure that"
"everybody's on the same goal is to sort"
"of um mind meld us all into this into"
"this larger scale network where where"
"all of this can take place but i i think"
"we have to be very careful about that"
"because you know when was the last time"
"you were you were too concerned about"
"what happened to your individual skin"
"cells right we shed them all the time we"
"don't really worry about it you know you"
"might go rock climbing or something and"
"tear a bunch of skin off your hands and"
"you feel good because hey i went rock"
"climbing the individual cells may not be"
"happy about that at all and so there's"
"there's presumably there's some sort of"
"optimal uh linkage mechanisms to be"
"found that allow us to reap the benefits"
"of of a larger collective iq while at"
"the same time"
"holding on to uh the the the respect for"
"the for the goals and the needs of the"
"you know the individual pieces that go"
"in there"
"well we'll return to that later on but"
"uh athena back to you"
"oh yeah just you know hearing you talk"
"about the gap junctions it it just"
"sounds it sounds just like you know"
"you've got someone under your skin or"
"like you care you have a lot of empathy"
"and so you can't help but you know feel"
"the feelings when you see someone else"
"feeling them right and um it's"
"fascinating to then think about you know"
"well you we do have sort of different"
"problems that we have to solve as human"
"groups and different constraints right"
"you know we're not all genetically"
"homogeneous there's possibilities for"
"cheating that have to be regulated in a"
"much tighter way than you have in a"
"multicellular body so so anyway david"
"i'll i'll stop because i know you want"
"to you know"
"bring the conversation back around to"
"the stuff later but i think it's a"
"really it's a really rich"
"area to kind of explore some of the the"
"similarities at these different scales"
"yeah totally and and we don't have to"
"wait i mean large-scale society has a"
"lot of the same"
"characters especially the"
"the concept of the invisible hand is is"
"that individuals can kind of be"
"operating locally maximizing their local"
"utilities and somehow it works out for"
"the benefit of the common good and the"
"individual does not have to have the"
"common good"
"in mind what would that be but like a"
"liver cell operating according to with"
local
"environment but nevertheless the whole"
"thing coordinated so that the common"
good
"is is benefit"
"oh i think"
"the question is you know are the rules"
"that the individual is operating by"
"whether they're a human or a liver cell"
"you know have those kind of been"
"designed and calibrated for higher level"
"function or not right and so"
"for you know a liver cell yeah they kind"
"of have been designed and calibrated for"
"that higher level function but in the"
"case of humans there's a there's"
"conflicting goals you know there's some"
"that are for higher level function and"
"then there's others that are for more"
"individual level and so sort of"
"negotiating that i think is uh one of"
"the big challenges of you know applying"
"some of these principles from you know"
"multicellularity and regulation of"
"multicellular bodies to large-scale"
"human systems yeah totally just uh"
"go ahead michael well i was just gonna"
"say i think this is this is a really"
"interesting question about um being"
"calibrated to to specific goals because"
"uh one of the things that we've been"
"working on and of course other people"
"had as well in the past is um the the"
"the diversity of things that"
"that the of behaviors that can be"
"executed by cells with exactly the same"
"genome and so in in right and the"
"plasticity with which cells of any given"
"genome can solve problems in novel"
"environments that they haven't seen"
"before and so one of my favorite recent"
"examples is this um is this thing we've"
"been doing that we call xenobots which"
"is uh these are these are novel"
"protoorganisms that never existed on"
"earth before that basically what we do"
"is we take skin cells off of a frog"
"embryo and uh we"
"we don't add anything we don't edit the"
"genome we don't add any novel transgenes"
"or or"
"nano materials or anything like that but"
"we take away something we take away the"
"other cells that are normally uh"
"instructing and constraining these cells"
"to to have this boring sort of"
"two-dimensional life on the surface of"
"the earth the animal we we put them in"
"the new environment and we let them uh"
"reboot their multicellularity we let"
"them we ask them in effect what what in"
"the absence of these other cues what do"
"you know what do you want to do what is"
"your default behavior and we find out"
"that actually"
"they self-organize many things they"
"could have done but in fact they"
"self-organize into this novel shape with"
"novel behaviors novel"
"novel capabilities with uh with with uh"
"self-directed behavior in fact that um"
"raises some really interesting questions"
"about what did evolution actually do"
"when it developed the frog genome"
"because being an excellent frog is one"
"thing it did but that's not the only"
"thing it did in some way the the exact"
"same hardware in a novel environment is"
"able to now um"
"follow different different kinds of"
"goals including figure out a novel way"
"to reproduce itself they reproduce by"
"kinematic replication instead of the"
"normal sort of froggy reproduction which"
"we've made impossible um and so i think"
"there are some really profound gaps in"
"our understanding of what are things"
"actually you know sort of optimized for"
"right because there's a tremendous"
"amount of freedom and creativity when"
"you release some of these constraints"
"you find out that there's actually"
"you know this agential material that"
"evolution has to work with these cells"
"that if you do nothing they're going to"
"do things on their own you you know the"
"best you're going to do is is sort of um"
"guide them to to to various adaptive"
"outcomes and i think that's a very"
"interesting set of questions michael do"
"you ever feel like a mad scientist"
"sitting there you're like i wonder what"
"these cells will do if i take them out"
"of the frog and"
"put them"
"yeah that's my that's my preferred state"
"of mind yeah absolutely"
"well didn't you get an eye to develop"
"within the gut of a tadpole or something"
"like that i think that uh that's that's"
"exactly that's exactly right and and we"
"should talk about that yeah we've been"
"um we've been playing with uh"
"understanding the uh the the the sort of"
"cognitive medium that holds the that"
"holds the the"
"patterns to which this these collective"
"intelligence is built and not terribly"
"surprising it's bioelectrical it's like"
"a non-neural version of neuroscience"
"basically and in certain cases we've"
"learned to read and write that"
"electrical information and so we can we"
"can sort of overwrite the native pattern"
"memories that these things have and then"
"you can go to a different set group of"
"cells in the frog that are otherwise"
"going to make gut and you can say to"
them
"you should really be making an eye and"
"in fact that's what they do they'll"
"they'll make an eye and in fact what we"
"found is that when you place these eyes"
"even on the tails of tadpoles those"
"animals can see perfectly well so the"
"the the eye cells will form even though"
"they're sitting yeah yeah they'll form"
"even though they're sitting in the"
"middle of muscle instead of in their"
"normal place near the brain they they"
"form a nice eye they make an optic nerve"
"the optic nerve runs around and and"
"looks what to connect with doesn't find"
"the brain sometimes finds the spinal"
"cord so it'll connect to the spinal cord"
"those animals when they don't have any"
"primary eyes just one eye sitting on"
"their tail we can train them for visual"
"cues so we've got we built this machine"
"that trains them to you know stay away"
"from a certain kind of light they can"
"see perfectly well so"
"are they evolving like for some"
"evolvability in a way that like like"
"other organisms aren't is there like you"
"think there's big variation maybe in"
"this like some organisms just have like"
"the ability to"
"have like change up their plans or their"
"body plans you know when"
"things change"
"personally now obviously we haven't done"
"this in every organism but but i have"
"some examples in other models where i"
"don't think this is special i think this"
"is a fundamental feature of life and"
"i'll tell you i'll tell you why uh the"
"the amazing thing about that kind of um"
"and i call this whole this whole"
"business multi-scale competency because"
"what it means is that that evolution can"
"do as a process is rely on the various"
"sub-components to get their job done"
"even when circumstances change so what"
"it means is that"
"if if we're using an architecture where"
"it's not nothing is really hard well"
"except for you know metabolic things but"
"but things aren't really hardwired every"
"what you're doing is you're you've got"
"modules that are going to try to get"
"their goals done meaning homeostatically"
"they're going to try to achieve their um"
"their objectives their agendas uh as dan"
"dana calls it uh despite the fact that"
"their circumstances change this really"
"potentiates evolution it smooths the"
"fitness landscape because it means that"
"if you've got some mutation that moves"
"the eye to the wrong location but it"
"does something good somewhere else in"
"the embryo you don't have to wait until"
"you find that you know you you you you"
"find that second mutation without"
"disturbing the eye it's fine the eye"
"will do its job in the tadpole we show"
"that craniofacial organs if you start"
"them off in the wrong position we call"
"them picasso tadpoles they will still"
"move around in these novel paths and"
"give you a perfectly good frog during"
"metamorphosis it doesn't matter that"
"they're out of kilter early on and so"
"this means that the evolution can really"
explore
"all kinds of things without immediately"
"incurring the penalty of just wrecking"
"the whole thing the minute you move"
"something just everything is wrecked so"
"when you look at this in all kinds of"
"species right i mean human embryos you"
"can cut them in half and you get two"
"perfectly normal monozygotic twins"
"because it's incredibly plastic half the"
"embryo realizes that the other half is"
"missing regenerates what's right what's"
"what's needed and and you know you're"
"good to go there's tons of these"
"beautiful examples of plasticity and"
"problem solving of this kind of um"
"competency i think it's everywhere i"
"think it's what makes evolution"
"you know workable basically one of the"
"threads then that goes between your and"
"my work is this idea of beautiful"
monsters
so
"you know i i thought about it in terms"
"of like uh the crested cacti that you"
"know they have like this cancer-like"
"form they're like beautiful in the you"
"know patterning that results and um"
"i mean your version is maybe a little"
"more mad science-y but um"
"super interesting point because uh for"
"you know what"
"understanding what a monster is and"
"understanding what a birth defect is"
"right i mean chemistry doesn't make"
"mistakes but by but biology if you're"
"going to say it's a mistake it's or an"
"error or developmental defect in some"
"way it's with reference to an"
"expectation that was supposed to happen"
"and one of the interesting things that"
"we see now is that these these sort of"
"um uh attractors amorphous space these"
"different ways of forming um um uh"
"bodies you can you know we can take a"
"planarian flatworm and and you cut off"
"the head they of course regrow the head"
"normally 100 percent of the time they"
"regrow ahead of the correct species what"
"we can do is perturb the electrical"
"conversations between cells that help"
"them remember what head shape they're"
"supposed to make and as a result they"
"will stochastically make heads that"
"belong to other species of planaria so"
"there you have a complete mismatch"
"between the gene the genetics is"
"unaltered you've still got the same wild"
"type genome but the cells will land in a"
"different attractor amorphous space"
"they'll make a head with a brain shape"
"with a stem cell distribution"
"looking like um planaria that are 150"
"million years distant right and so from"
"the from the exact same genome and so"
"this idea of of of what a monster is and"
"we can make um tadpoles that have"
"zebrafish like tails and their faces"
"looking like other frogs and so on and"
"so this is yeah this is all you know"
"speciation versus versus developmental"
"defect i i think you're you're exactly"
"right it's very interesting"
"so basically you know the raw material"
"that evolution is working with is is"
"much more a gentle and most people"
"i think these lower level units are"
"organized into modules within other"
"modules and they're coordinated so that"
um
"so that um"
"and that results in this just tremendous"
"diversity that you could if you know the"
"mechanisms then you could create these"
"these monsters so this provides a good"
"way for us to introduce so there's that"
"that's kind of like on the variation"
"part of a variation selection"
replication
"uh process and we can all along we've"
"been talking about the importance of"
"levels of selection that this this"
"amazing diversity that arises"
"um has to pass the survival test"
basically
"the survival and reproduction test and"
"so the selection at the level of the"
"individual organism"
"is now winnowing these that's what"
"distinguishes a monsoon a monster from"
"anything else is whether it can survive"
or
"or reproduce and so higher level"
"selection is"
"is then"
"operating on this amazing diversity that"
"that arises in this like coordinated"
"fashion because of these agents"
"basically in these homeostatic units and"
"and all of that and right away we could"
"map that onto"
"back on to"
"humans and the idea that"
that
"individuals are you know like these"
"lower level units they're tremendously"
"generated they're doing all these things"
"but that's going to result in"
"the social manifestation which might"
"work well or poorly and unless you have"
"selection at that level"
"basically then you'll get monsters"
"you'll get as opposed to"
"social organizations that actually"
"function well in the context of their"
"environment so these are all"
"you know i mean real parallelisms"
between
"between this biological level of"
"organization and"
"and what takes place in humans david i"
"have to say i have a certain fondness"
"for monsters though monsters of all"
"kinds i think uh you know oftentimes"
"they do like hold these"
"keys to understanding what like what"
"mechanisms are sometimes they have new"
"solutions embedded within them even"
though
"at first they look like there's"
"something that's non-functional so"
um
"yeah even in human organizations i mean"
"sometimes yeah they're really messed up"
"and weird but sometimes you get really"
"interesting things coming out of"
"completely you know seemingly"
"dysfunctional ways that humans relate so"
"i um yeah so i i'm not gonna completely"
dismiss
"monsters because they do have a special"
"place in my heart and it's not just"
"because of the zombie thing david it's"
"not just the zombie thing"
"yeah well i mean"
"we're coming up this is like the second"
"or third time we've come up against"
"a problem with surfaces throughout this"
"series is that there's forms of"
"superorganisms not worth wanting there's"
"forms of superorganisms that are"
"downright scary we don't want societies"
"that treat us like skin cells thank you"
very
much
"we don't want societies that basically"
"make that kind of valuation so that if"
"you're not the right type then"
"then you're devalued which i think so if"
"you're a monster"
"then for some reason then"
"you're going to be discarded by"
"by that um"
"by that society we want we want"
"something as did tahar"
"that that respects individual freedom"
"and dignity and and"
"and um"
"and autonomy and so there's real kind of"
"moral tensions here when we talk about"
"group level organisms"
"as do the kinds which exist"
"and the kinds which we want for"
ourselves
"and among the dystopias that we could"
"consider first of all collapses so that"
"there's no functional organization at"
all
or
"things that work very well thank you"
"very much but but in a way which is just"
horrifying
"as far as"
"i respect for individuals are concerned"
"and not they all could happen that could"
"happen it's like threading the needle as"
"to the kind of superorganism we want"
is
"or we think is worth wanting"
"so this is very fraught with with"
tensions
"yeah a civilization that was based on"
"the principles of multicellularity would"
"be a absolutely terrifying authoritarian"
government
"so we don't want that"
"interesting to see how this maybe"
"translates back into"
"cellular interactions as we find our way"
"towards discussing multicellularity and"
"and um"
"and such things as uh"
"cancers is that there's a reason why"
"human society needs to be egalitarian"
"and the reason is most evident in small"
"groups because in the segments in the"
"episodes that focus on"
"human evolution"
"it's all about cooperation and"
"cooperation is all about"
preventing
"uh social control"
"uh preventing bullying"
"behaviors the one danger in in in human"
"social groups was the danger of being"
bullied
"of being pushed around and the only"
"reason that small human groups cooperate"
"is because they have the"
"wherewithal to collectively gang up"
against
bullies
"and unless individuals are capable of"
"standing up for themselves"
"then they will be bullied so so this"
"requires a kind of an egalitarianism"
"which exists in most"
small-scale
"uh societies and that egalitarianism"
"needs to be retained"
"as the scale of society increases if"
"it's not then we get despotism that's"
"what we get"
"so uh the optimistic"
"message as i like to see it"
"is that thanks to the fact that we're"
not
"genetically highly related to the other"
"people in our societies the only way for"
"us to operate as a unit"
"is with various forms of egalitarian"
uh
"forms of"
"social control like the rules of meiosis"
"for example as a biological"
"example every every gene has a fair"
"chance of making it to the next"
"generation and if it and if you don't"
"have that you have meiotic drive"
"and then the organism ceases to"
"to um"
"to function"
"even that is probably a result of"
"a huge"
um
"like multi-layer"
"regulation system that keeps meiotic"
"drive from getting out of control"
"because i mean that's such a weak point"
"in you know the the transmission so"
"so yeah i mean i think that there's you"
"know there are many there are many"
"phenomena in biology where it's kind of"
"just been assumed that like oh this"
"problem is solved but really underlying"
"that are all of these layers multiple"
"layers and"
"checks and balances of regulation that"
"that can break and that also if we don't"
"you know appreciate that it works"
"because we have those layers of"
"regulation then we kind of you know"
where
"we just assume that uh"
"you know the problem of cooperation is"
"solved just by virtue of like genetic"
"relatedness which i think is like a a"
"problem that is um or that assumption is"
is
"quite widespread in the evolution and"
"behavior community almost like oh you're"
"you're genetically identical so there's"
"not a problem it's like well"
"no there's still you know you could"
"still have all these issues of cheating"
"and exploitation unless there was"
"selection that acted to create these"
"regulatory mechanisms on this higher"
"level and the whole vocabulary of human"
"social control has been transported we"
"have parliaments of genes we have"
"policing we have sheriff genes we have"
"and so the whole vocabulary of human"
"uh collective action and social control"
"is now part of the parlance"
"of people who work on that so michael"
"you were about to say something"
"two quick things one one is that um yeah"
"the the the"
"solving this problem by genetic"
"relatedness is uh is is really"
"interesting because on the one hand we"
"have situations where even in the same"
"body during embryonic development all"
"kinds of competition takes place so and"
"in fact it's it's it's necessary for"
"coordination cells and tissues compete"
"for informational signals they compete"
"for metabolic resources it's actually"
"really critical to make sure that um"
"overall development goes goes correctly"
"and conversely you know we make hybrids"
"we can make um chimeras of cells a very"
"distant origin and they will cooperate"
"life is incredibly interoperable they"
"cells will cooperate with electronic"
"devices they will cooperate with other"
"cells that belong to a completely"
"different type of type of animal and"
"they will build something you know we we"
"make frog lottles that are 50 frog and"
"let's say 50 axolotl right and they make"
"something um these cells have no problem"
"cooperating with each other even though"
"they're uh quite quite you know distinct"
"genetics and i think with with um"
"this issue of uh of of what kind of"
"societies we want and everything uh of"
"that nature it's"
"it's important to realize how limited"
"our view is in our ability to detect"
"agency that uh that is impacting us and"
"what i mean by this is that you know"
"we are very good at as most animals are"
"detecting agency outside of us in the"
"three-dimensional world so all our"
"senses point outwards we look around and"
"we say okay that is a rock but that is"
"you know a tiger or or prey or whatever"
"it's going to be and we can recognize"
"that imagine if we had if we grew up"
"with a kind of uh sense that was"
"biofeedback if you knew at every given"
"point what your pancreas was doing i"
"think we would have no trouble"
"recognizing it as an intelligent agent"
"solving problems if we had access to the"
"space that it works in the actions that"
"it takes when things you know if we"
"could if we could see it working in"
"physiological space the way that we see"
"animals running around in"
"three-dimensional space we would have a"
"much better appreciation for what you"
"know that intelligent looks intelligence"
"looks like and so that's sort of going"
"downwards but also going upwards um i"
"think that uh it would be it would be a"
"you know kind of a lovecraftian scale of"
"of of horror if a single cell could"
"realize that my god i'm part of this"
"organism and everything you know the the"
"actions that i take in my space have"
"been completely bent by that space has"
"been just distorted you know in the in"
"the relativity sense that that space has"
"been distorted by the needs of this"
"larger system before the matrix michael"
"it's the matrix"
"right i mean it would be it would be"
"incredible and and of course of course"
"by by definition these parts don't have"
"the wherewithal to understand what the"
"goals are in"
"to which their space is distorted but"
"you know i often wonder are there any"
"tools of"
"information theory of something that"
"would allow you to at least you know"
"have some idea that you're part of this"
"larger scheme that that is just you know"
"is distorting your options and in some"
"way i think we're very bad at"
"recognizing that intrinsically i mean"
"michael isn't that what we're all living"
"in a a human society where you know we"
"are shaped by the goals of others and"
"the incentives that are around us and"
"like you know our whole reality"
"especially if you know we live in a city"
"and we you know go to a workplace where"
"we're you know around other people like"
"so much of our world is created by other"
"humans and that shapes what we can and"
"can't do and what the you know"
"um outcomes are for different courses of"
"action that we might take"
"yeah but but there's an even extra i"
"mean that's absolutely true but but"
"there's an even extra layer imagine"
"imagine for a moment that you were um"
"shrunk down to the size of a single cell"
"and you didn't know about embryonic"
"development you were placed inside of an"
"early embryo frog fish human doesn't"
"matter you and and you looked around"
"right and you saw this incredible"
"activity cells are dying cells are"
"randomly falling off other stuff is"
"happening there's lots of noise all this"
"you could easily tell that your"
"options were um impacted by what your"
"neighbors were doing that there were"
"signals so you would for sure know that"
"you're impacted in exactly the way that"
"you would say what i think you wouldn't"
"necessarily know if you didn't already"
"understand what embryonic development"
"was i don't think you'd have a clue that"
"all this giant uh rigmarole you know"
"this this process with its noise and"
"everything else is going to reliably"
"crank out a zebra fish every single time"
"i don't think you would catch that at"
"all and i think we take this for granted"
"when we say yeah you know the acorns"
"make oak trees yeah that's how it's"
"supposed to be but but but we know that"
"because we've seen it happen we have"
"zero capability right now to predict"
"that you know developmental biology if"
"you were if you were shrunk down to a"
"local perspective and seeing all the"
"stuff that was going on would you be"
"able to tell that this is all part of"
"making a zebra fish i don't think you"
"would and so so that that extra step"
"going from knowing that yes you are"
"constrained by these million things and"
"that you know no doubt"
"a lot of things are affecting what"
"you're going to be able to do to the"
"next step of saying my god i'm part of"
"something that actually has a goal state"
"it will reliably reach this and have"
"some ability to comprehend it to"
"whatever extent our intellect allows"
right
"this speaks to the unintended component"
"the blind component of human cultural"
"evolution where cultures work without"
"anyone knowing how they"
"work to some extent i mean and i it's"
"the intentional and the unintended the"
"blind and intentional components of"
"of cultural evolution human cultural"
"evolution is the"
"quintessential glass half full it's hard"
"to know what to be more impressed by"
"the blind component which leads to"
"design that nobody that nobody designed"
"well the intentional component where"
"people actually sit around set about"
"with their social arrangements and"
"succeeded to would agree"
"at accomplishing"
"what they intended to build i mean"
"there's there's excellent examples of"
"both but um"
"to focus on the blind component then it"
"results in exactly what you're saying"
"michael we're all participants in"
"something that actually does result in"
order
"to a degree"
"and we're completely unaware of it"
"because we didn't design it it's just"
"what survived and what what what hung"
"together compared to the many things"
"that fall apart"
"so and then it's up to us as scientists"
to
um
"to understand that just the way with any"
"other thing where instrumentation and"
"and and theorizing is required to to uh"
"to apprehend what we"
"what we had no idea of it had no way of"
"knowing couldn't possibly have known if"
"we didn't actually apprehend it"
"scientifically so"
so
"you know before we barrel on"
um
"i want to go back to the symbiotic cell"
"theory but which has been covered in"
other
"episodes but the idea that the the"
"nucleated cells eukaryotic cells evolved"
"as symbiotic communities"
"of bacterial cells"
"thus documented for mitochondria and"
"chloroplasts but there's also a question"
"as to whether any other aspects of"
of
"eukaryotic cell structure such as"
"flagelli or or other organelles also"
have
"separate origins and um uh"
"i don't know uh either one of you if"
"you're if you have opinions on that but"
"just dwell a little bit"
"on on the symbiotic cell theory"
"associated with lynn margulis"
"as we're talking at the cellular level"
"well i think that the evidence is quite"
"convincing and to me one of the really"
"fascinating pieces of it is this idea"
"that um almost you know because you"
"built a eukaryotic cell out of these two"
"elements that um where there was some"
"level of conflict you know i mean"
"there's kind of still is like you could"
"see in the way the genomes are you know"
"interact with each other that there's"
"some level of conflict that you actually"
"had a very efficient mechanism for cell"
"death um one that you could kind of turn"
"on a dime because i think it's hard to"
"build into"
um
"a cooperative system"
"this ability to self-destruct if things"
"are you know kind of getting out of hand"
"but by actually introducing um"
"you know genes where there was sort of"
"conflict um i think that might have"
"actually been a really important piece"
"of allowing for um this cell death"
"program you know the apoptosis program"
to
"um to be built in at this you know most"
"fundamental level um so then you could"
"actually build much larger bodies"
"because you kind of have um this like"
"quick switch like a kill switch for"
"cells that are um misbehaving um and i"
"think it might have otherwise actually"
been
"too sort of challenging to get into um"
"that kind of space evolutionarily where"
"you where you'd have a a really solid"
"sort of kill switch built into each cell"
"you had to like get something else in"
"there that you know previously evolved"
"to try to kill the cell"
"put it in there under regulatory control"
"and then um i think that might have"
"actually allowed for much larger and"
"more complex organization than was"
"possible before"
"i think one of the"
"upcoming um"
"fields that's going to have a lot of"
"interesting things to say about that is"
uh
"this is is bioengineering and chimerism"
"because we are now putting things into"
"cells that have never been there before"
"and so on and both at the cell and"
"tissue level people make"
"cyborgs and hybrids and all these"
"different kinds of mixes of of of"
"cellular material and subcellular"
"material and designed engineered"
"artifacts and so on and what you see is"
"this incredible uh"
"kind of ability to to um"
"adapt and work with whatever is there"
"and i think it it would surprise me not"
"at all that that that that early events"
"in evolution would would combine all"
"these different things because we see"
"cells making use of stuff that uh that"
"is just incredibly alien to them and no"
"problem they figure out how to get along"
"with all these weird materials and so on"
"and so there's this there's this huge uh"
"area of synthetic biology and"
"bioengineering where we're giving cells"
"novel metabolic capabilities novel"
"signaling capabilities novel"
"computational capabilities biomechanical"
"capabilities uh and uh and all of this"
"is is highly interoperable and so that"
"that plasticity of being able to work"
"with whatever you've encountered if you"
"can make some sort of use out of it i"
"think uh you know i wouldn't be"
"surprised at all"
"let's uh make cancer center stage here"
"um and"
"why is cancer a fundamental problem"
"with multicellular uh"
"organisms uh athena why don't you go"
"first and then uh"
"and then um and then michael sure yeah"
so
"cancer is a problem because"
"multicellularity is fundamentally a"
"cooperative system of cells so you know"
"in order to make this transition from"
"unicellular life or sort of you know"
"aggregates of cells that we're just sort"
"of operating together um to like a truly"
"multicellular structure and method of"
"reproducing there had to be some"
"mechanisms in there that kept"
"cells from"
"replicating and monopolizing the"
"resources in a way that would limit the"
"ability of that organism to function you"
"know just like a cooperative group can"
"be totally taken down by one exploiter"
"um same thing with a group of cells if"
"there's one cell in there that's"
"replicating out of control or"
"monopolizing all the resources and you"
"know creating waste products like that"
can
"make it not viable to have a cellular"
"group so the evolution of"
"multicellularity itself would not have"
"really been possible without"
"checks and balances um on you know these"
"potential ways that cells might cheat"
"you know i mentioned replicating too"
much
"monopolizing resources creating lots of"
"waste products um sort of not"
"participating in the"
"creation and maintenance of the ex the"
"extracellular environment that's"
"actually a really important piece as"
well
"um and uh apoptosis also so this"
"controlled cell death you know when the"
cell
"is um if it's infected or if it's"
"mutated or if just developmentally um it"
"makes sense for those cells to fall away"
"um if if there isn't a mechanism for"
"apoptosis that's reliable and that's"
"kind of you know going back to the"
"earlier part of the conversation about"
"like how important that that it is to"
"have a really really fail-proof"
"apoptosis mechanism um you know those"
"are those are just necessary pieces to"
"have um"
"multicellular function and so really"
"built into multicellularity is this"
"vulnerability to cancer but also all of"
"these regulatory mechanisms that help to"
"suppress it"
"yeah i just i wanted to emphasize one"
"thing you said on the one hand we have"
"cheating and on the other hand we have"
"just the coordination that's required to"
"build an organism even if everyone is"
"willing and you said you know need to"
"fall away i think is one of the things"
"that you said that just in the process"
"of building an organism it's a need for"
"there to be competition as michael has"
"stressed and for there to be cell death"
"even before we get to cheating"
"just uh just because that's the way the"
"the organism is is um is um"
"is molded so there's co-op there's"
"there's coordination"
"and then there's cheating and a lot of"
"what you were saying about such things"
"as cell death and so on"
"um would need to take place uh just for"
"the coordination"
"part of it that uh cells have to die"
"under some circumstances in order to"
"build uh build the organism so uh so uh"
"michael why don't you uh uh take your"
"turn on this yeah um uh so so i'll start"
"with the cheating portion and then tell"
"a little you know kind of our story of"
"cancer and and the lens through which i"
"see this this process um"
"let's go back to this this idea of of"
"cells being joined by these by these uh"
"gap junctions uh one of the things that"
"it does is it is it greatly increases"
"cooperation because when you are"
"internal environment is directly"
"connected to the internal environment of"
"your neighbor"
"there's no cheating possible because you"
"would be anything you do is immediately"
"anything your neighbor does is felt by"
"you anything you do is felt by your"
"neighbor it's like a it's like an"
"effective sort of karma system that that"
"there's no cheating because you are not"
"distinct anymore you are in many ways"
"you have ceased to be and now there's"
"this new greater you know greater um"
"kind of entity that you'd be cheating"
"yourself in effect if you if you you"
"know poisoned it or something like that"
"so so the thing is so i'll tell this"
"this kind of story um"
"of of how we see we see cancer i mean so"
"so so i completely agree with athena"
"it's it's a fundamental uh"
"aspect of being multicellular and having"
"this need for for cooperation so one"
"thing that happens when you've got cells"
"that particularly join into these"
"electrical networks is that these"
"electrical networks are just for free"
"from from physics are subject to"
"spontaneous symmetry breaking and the"
"organization of patterns that serve as"
"large-scale homeostatic states where now"
"your homeostatic state is a pattern it's"
"a spatial arrangement not a local"
"metabolic state so this this facilitates"
"certain kinds of morphogenesis because"
"downstream they control you know gene"
"expression and cell movement and all"
"that but um one of the one of the things"
"that happens is that"
"is that they start working on so so if"
"you if you in your in your mind and when"
"we've you know we sort of have some"
"tools for doing this if you visualize"
"the scale of the self that is formed you"
"start out with a single cell and you say"
"okay the scale in in terms of a"
"spatio-temporal um cognitive radius you"
"know this this this little kind of um"
"light cone that that limits what you can"
"work towards you know there's some"
"metabolic goals you have a little bit of"
"memory going back a little bit of"
"predictive capacity going forward once"
"you're this network and you have this"
"this much larger um kinds of these"
"larger goals that you can work on we're"
"going to make a liver we're going to"
"make a heart or or whatever because"
"that's what this this network is able to"
"is able to do"
"uh what happens is that that that the"
"that boundary of the self scales so that"
"what happens it goes up so that now"
"everybody's sort of cooperating onto on"
"this on this on this one one project"
"and when that process is screwed up and"
"of course one of the first"
"uh one of the first steps of conversion"
"you know when when you start to convert"
"to cancer one of the first things that"
"happens is gap junctions close right"
"your gap junctions close you lose"
"electrical connectivity as soon as"
"you've lost electrical connectivity your"
uh
"your that boundary between self and and"
"outside environment shrinks because now"
"that cell as far as it's concerned"
"everything it sees around itself that's"
"just the external environment as far as"
"it's concerned right it can go back to"
"being an amoeba because now it's now"
"it's it's now uh the boundary between me"
"and everybody else is very tiny so i"
"would say that these cells are not any"
"more selfish than anything else it's"
"just their selves have shrunk"
"everybody's selfish is just before"
"yourself was kind of huge and everybody"
"was working towards it now yourself is"
"tiny and now you're back to your goals"
"from from those ancient days where what"
"are my goals right each amoeba you know"
"wants to be two amoebas and you want to"
"go where life is good and sort of"
"you got conversion and metastasis and so"
"just uh just to say that we've we've"
"tested this and so"
"one thing you can do is you can kick"
"start uh basically full-on for example"
"full-on metastatic melanoma"
"in a tadpole no carcinogens no dna"
"damage no oncogenes just by disrupting"
"the electrical state of certain set of"
"cells and they just these these so the"
"melanocytes completely convert they go"
"crazy and take over um the animal you"
"can go in the opposite direction and you"
"can put in really nasty oncogenes like"
"human k-ras mutations that make tumors"
"in these animals and if you at the same"
"time very carefully manage the"
"electrical state using optogenetics or"
"injected channels right you will prevent"
"tumorogenesis despite the fact that the"
"the mutation is still there the oncogene"
"is blazingly expressed"
"there can be no tumor because you've you"
"forced those cells into their electrical"
"connection so that that that"
"informational boundary that"
"computational surface between between"
"you know the boundary of that self and"
"the rest of the world is what sort of"
"shrinks and grows both during"
"development and evolution and cancer"
"cannot help but notice the similarity"
"with social the fragmentation of social"
"identities in modern life"
"athena over to you yeah okay so i'm just"
"like super excited listening to you talk"
"about this michael because"
"it really implies that there's a whole"
"other level of health that people don't"
"think about you know they talk about"
"physical health and mental health and"
"emotional health but how about like"
"informational computational health"
"right like having your the cells of your"
"body um"
"having proper electrical signaling being"
"in the right expression state i i mean i"
"feel like that is it is mechanistically"
"a unique piece of health and it's"
"something that people aren't talking"
"about as a"
"piece of health in and of itself"
"what you just described michael is so"
"evocative of a situation where how"
"people behave depends on their social"
"identities and if they have a large"
"social identity then that that functions"
"well and if their social identity"
"shrinks then they just carry on what"
"they're doing it's just a different us"
"it's a different theme"
"and of course that could play havoc at"
larger
"at larger scale so do you see that"
"parallelism i mean it's so striking to"
"me i i see it i think that we have to be"
"careful exactly what you said earlier"
"which is that there are larger scale"
"structures that you can be part of that"
"are you know morally abhorrent and not"
"really what we're what we want to aim"
"for so so the real question is you know"
"being part of a larger structure"
"tends to raise your overall iq"
"uh the question is what are going to be"
"the goals of these large-scale"
"structures and in general this is one of"
"the one of the things that i talk about"
"when you know but but when we do this"
"synthetic biology we make xenobots and"
people
"want to know about you know when they're"
"going to be cleaning out your arteries"
"and cleaning up the ocean whatever"
"that's fine there will be like specific"
um
"applications but the bigger issue to me"
"the much bigger issue is to get started"
"working on a science which we don't yet"
"have of figuring out where the goals of"
"collective systems come from and how do"
"we manage them because we're not good at"
"seeing them"
"you know in advance we're going to be"
"surrounded by swarm robotics on the"
"internet of things and all these"
"structures and including current social"
"structures that have that literally have"
"their own goals that they're going to be"
"trying to implement we don't know what"
"those are we don't know how to envision"
"them we don't know how to predict them"
"and we don't know how to manage them and"
"um getting a handle on that i think is"
"is super critical because we these are"
"highly non-linear emergent surprising"
"processes we are not good at seeing them"
"coming yeah that resonates a lot i mean"
"i think you know we have a tendency as"
"humans to be like here's the thing like"
"thing this is the goal i'm gonna put my"
"finger on it it exists here or there but"
"when it comes to these emergent systems"
"you know the goal does not exist in one"
"place you can't localize it in in one"
"entity um and i think we are really bad"
"at reasoning about that and that leads"
"to some serious vulnerabilities for us"
"as a society especially as things get"
"more and more complex and there are more"
"and more opportunities for these"
"emergent kinds of goals to come about"
"yeah so i want to i want to"
"raise the issue of"
"evolutionary processes that give rise to"
"other evolutionary processes and"
"evolution as being something that could"
"be intra-generational in other words"
"taking place within an organizat a"
"single organism"
"in addition to inter-generational"
"we have some well-known examples so the"
"adaptive component of the immune system"
"is the best known"
"example the rapid evolution of"
antibodies
"i do a lot of work thinking of our"
"behavioral system"
"as a intergenerational"
"process what bf skinner calls selection"
"by consequences but there's more and i"
"think the more mechanistic you get than"
"the more darwinian processes"
"intragenerational darwinian processes"
exist
"and so i just wondered if you could add"
"to that list"
"of of basically"
"darwinian processes that take place"
"within the organism in addition to the"
"adaptive component of the immune system"
"and our behavioral flexibility cancer is"
"the one that comes to mind you know you"
"have cells that are"
"evolving you know within the body to um"
"you know they sort of develop their own"
"fitness function you could say that's"
"one that's unregulated so that's an"
"unregulated um"
"intergenerational yeah"
"yeah you know it's unregulated although"
"there are some really interesting um"
"ideas now so if you look at"
"you know there's certain kinds of"
"mutations like notch mutations where"
"you'll often see a an expanse um"
"that takes up uh"
"areas where there's sort of been injury"
"um and"
"me and and carl o'meal we have a"
"hypothesis that some of these like um"
"these clonal expansions in some places"
"might actually be almost like a plan b"
"for um"
"uh if you have a wound and um you need"
"to have a mutation um that will lead to"
"rapid expansion of a cell of you know a"
"cell clone that isn't likely to progress"
"to cancer so that it doesn't get taken"
"up by one that might be"
"um more out of control so"
"you know there are hypotheses out there"
"that you know some aspects of somatic"
"evolution might actually um be"
"sort of under some control in order to"
"sort of crowd out those processes that"
"are less under control um i think it's a"
"it's a really exciting"
"venue for you know for new work but"
"there's you know because there"
"definitely are um"
"some clonal expansions that are much"
"less likely to lead to cancer than"
"others so it could very well be that"
"there's um some level of you know"
"control there that uh you know flips um"
"some of those switches to to just get"
"the clonal expansion and migration"
"without um necessarily increasing"
"overall cancer risk that much"
"yeah i'm not sure i have any good um"
"examples of of a new phenomenon like"
"that although i have one that i can tell"
"you that's kind of fun that sounds like"
"that but i actually think isn't at all"
"and i think that's important what i what"
"i do like about um this this kind of uh"
"this this this um"
"idea of of looking for uh for evolution"
"within the organism is just more broadly"
"you know uh one one thing i'm really"
"interested in in this aspect of ontogeny"
"recapitulating phylogeny in the journey"
"across the cartesian cut right we all"
"start life as one cell and people like"
"to look at this one cell as um"
"a piece of it's a it's a piece of"
"physics and that you know it's kind of"
"um uh this this uh this this physical"
"analog system and then at some point it"
"becomes a at least in some cases let's"
"say let's say human or similar it"
"becomes this this can this this novel"
"creature that has cognition uh first"
"person perspective and all that"
"we all got there as a very smooth um in"
"a very smooth continuous way the same"
"the same way that evolution got us there"
"from single cells all the way you know"
"all the way to to more complex forms and"
"so i really like this this idea of"
"trying to understand what what are again"
"what are the invariants in this in this"
"journey right and there's in the fact"
"that there's no in both cases there is"
"no what i think is instructive in both"
"cases is there's no one place where"
"biology says draw a sharp line here"
"everything before that was just physics"
"after that ah now you have computation"
"representation uh you know true"
"preferences like true motivation all"
"that there's nowhere that you can draw a"
"sharp line right but neither in"
"evolution nor in in development"
"and so so i i i i'm interested in asking"
"you know what what aspects of uh that"
"kind of scaling and um"
"well just just what what what processes"
"uh operate at a very large scale and"
"then at the very small scale to allow"
"that kind of you know that kind of"
"journey to take to take place you know"
yeah
"yeah okay so uh i want to talk a little"
"bit more about"
cancer
defenses
"the mechanisms that evolve to prevent"
"cancer which is extensive and i guess"
"they just shade into the immune system"
"which also protects against external"
infectious
"agents and"
and
"so let's talk about"
"that defenses basically presumably they"
"evolved by individual level selection"
"organisms that had these defenses"
um
"survive and reproduce better than those"
"that didn't at least with the just"
"fascinating conjecture"
"athena that i just love is part of your"
"work that"
"it's in long-lived organisms that cancer"
"defect defensive mechanisms are needed"
"the most and so if we want to find"
"species where cancer"
"defense is exceptionally good we should"
"go to the whales and the elephants um"
"not the mice"
"and uh and so this kind this kind of"
"opens up a kind of a cross species"
"comparison of cancer which did not exist"
"for cancer research for the most part"
"but now does"
"so um so let's talk about um"
"the elaborate defenses against cancer"
"that have evolved and of course the need"
"to have something similar for a"
"large-scale human society so uh so speak"
"to us a little bit about that athena"
"yeah well one of the things to me that"
"is really awesome about cancer defense"
"mechanisms is that they exist on many"
"different levels so you you have"
"basically you know"
"cell intrinsic mechanisms so things that"
"are inside the cell you know encoded"
"into the dna of the cell that regulate"
"the cell's behavior so for example"
"um the gene uh tp53 which is essentially"
"like an information processing hub so so"
"michael to kind of connect to your work"
"a little bit i mean this isn't"
"electrical signaling electrical"
"information it's you know mostly gene"
"products but essentially what this you"
"know hub is doing is like listening in"
"on all of these activities that are"
"going on inside the cell"
"you know what's its metabolism like"
"what's um you know the cell what's going"
"on with the cell cycle um how is it uh"
"you know what other thing what other"
"proteins is it producing so it's like"
"listening in on everything"
"and then it is essentially deciding you"
"know is this cell um behaving as it"
"should for being a part of a"
"multicellular organism in this"
"particular spot um and"
"if the answer is no then it you know"
"basically um initiates this repair you"
"know dna repair process if that fails"
"then it initiates apoptosis you know"
"cellular self-destruction"
"so you have this you know internal"
"process um"
"cell intrinsic almost like the cellular"
"conscience you could think of it that"
way
"um and then you have the neighborhood"
"processes so all of the cells uh you"
"know as michael was talking about"
"earlier they're connected to the cells"
"nearby them sometimes you know directly"
"through these junctions where they're"
"sharing um you know proteins and gene"
"products and signaling you know"
"electrically um and sometimes just"
"because they're near enough by that the"
um
"you know uh factors that are being"
"produced are you know um in this sort of"
"milieu and they're they're all affecting"
"each other so"
"um basically cells are constantly"
"monitoring their neighbors i mean"
"they're like the nosiest neighbors"
"you've ever had i mean they're like in"
"your house that nosy you know um"
and
"and and cells cells will not"
"they they will not stay alive unless"
"their neighbors are saying stay alive um"
"so they not only do they you know"
require
"um like"
"not having apoptosis signals right like"
"it's not that their neighbors so if"
"their neighbors say die they die just"
"like that but they also they're also"
"listening like do my neighbors want me"
"alive and if their neighbors they're not"
"getting those signals from their"
"neighbors then they self-destruct so"
"they're like they're like you know super"
"super sensitive to their social"
"environment you could say and um"
"everybody you know all of the cells have"
"these nosy neighbors so so you have"
"intrinsic then you have these"
"neighborhood level um functions and then"
"you have the systemic level so the the"
"immune system and so the you know immune"
"cells are like monitoring the whole body"
"for like regions where it seems like"
"something is a little off like you know"
"are there does it seem like maybe"
"they're cells that are replicating that"
"shouldn't is there you know some sort of"
"you know chronic situation that's that"
"that just seems a little bit off and if"
"so then you know the immune cells will"
"go to that region and try to"
"you know probably michael a lot of what"
"they're doing is trying to re-regulate"
"the signaling i haven't really thought"
"about it that way but you know that"
"probably initially that's what they do"
"and then if that doesn't work that's"
"probably when they go into sort of the"
"apoptosis mode um"
"but yeah i wonder if people have looked"
"for that actually like looked at the"
"immune system as a you know information"
"electrical signal regulating system in"
"its first pass because that would be way"
"less costly than all the cellular"
"destruction that we usually associate"
"with what the immune system is doing"
"yeah there is there is some work on that"
"on macrophages and things uh things of"
"that nature um yeah this is this is"
"great i love i love the the story you"
"just told and uh uh"
"but the only thing i can add to that is"
"uh my my favorite cancer suppression uh"
"story which is that apparently one of"
"the best ways to"
"suppress cancer is to have a really"
"strong idea of what you should be doing"
"instead a really strong morphogenetic"
cascade
"and uh there there was"
"it's it's it's really interesting if you"
"have a view which is which was made"
"probably still is but but it's i think"
"it's kind of crumbling this this view of"
"cancer as um very sort of local uh you"
know
"checkpoint genes and and suppression"
"mechanisms and so on you would predict"
"that animals that have a very large that"
"have access to a very large pool of"
"undifferentiated plastic cells basically"
"regenerators that they should have very"
"um they should be very prone to cancer"
"and in fact it's been said that the"
"reason that let's say humans are poor"
"regenerators is in order to avoid the"
"kind of uh oncogenic risk that you would"
"get for having cells that are just happy"
"to proliferate and you know and migrate"
"and things like that so that would be"
"the prediction right and and uh on the"
"other hand if you had this idea that"
"cancer is an escape from a a strong"
"morphogenetic memory of the network you"
"would say that no actually um"
"you would you would predict that good"
"regenerator should have very low"
"incidences of cancer so that's nice"
"because it's a case where these two"
"theories make opposite predictions and"
"that's been checked and regenerators"
"good regenerators in fact have very very"
"low incidences of cancer having having"
"lots of plastic proliferative cells is"
"no problem if you have the information"
"structure that harnesses them towards an"
"adaptive outcome and so my favorite"
"example of that is planaria so these"
"planarian flatworms there's a couple of"
"things about them they are incredibly"
"regenerative so you can cut them into"
"pieces the record i think is like 275"
"pieces something like that and thomas"
"and morgan and you know 1903 or"
"something cut them into you know a"
"couple of hundred pieces and every piece"
"knows exactly what a correct word looks"
"like um they they regenerate with with"
"incredible fidelity they make the worm"
"okay they don't they don't get cancer"
"uh now"
"the the the other is so so they now know"
"a couple of things a they've solved the"
"aging problem so there's no such thing"
"as an old planarian they don't age and"
"so they are basically immortal and so"
"the worms that i have in my lab are in"
"direct physical continuity with worms"
"that were here almost half a billion"
"years ago like these are them now what"
"they do do in in order to proliferate"
"many of them can do sexual reproduction"
"but they usually don't what they do is"
"they tear themselves in half and then"
"each half regrows the other half and now"
"you've got two worms okay now think"
"about what this means from the"
"perspective of um"
"uh inheritance they they have uh they"
"they basically don't have a weissmann's"
"barrier because any mutation in the body"
"in the somatic they have somatic"
"inheritance any mutation that doesn't"
"kill a stem cell is inherited and"
"replicated throughout the body once they"
"divide and that cell has to make more"
"progeny to fill in the rest of the body"
"right so now for several hundred million"
"years they've been accumulating all"
"these mutations their genomes are an"
"incredible mess we don't even have a"
"proper assembly in in japonica because"
"the cells are mix-applied every cell has"
"a different number of chromosomes you"
"don't even know what you're sequencing"
"because because every cell is just mass"
"right yeah massive genomic diversity"
"they are champion regenerators their"
"anatomy is rock solid every single time"
"exactly correct now think about what"
"this means for our claim to understand"
"what what the relationship between"
"genomes and anatomy is we don't have a"
"clue here really because because the"
"genome is basically shot to hell it's"
"all over the place every cell has a"
"different genome if you were to say you"
"know how how genetically related they"
"are i mean i don't even know how you"
"estimate that because they have all"
"kinds of mosaicism within a single"
"animal and yet their anatomy is this is"
"the strongest of any other species"
"that's the best control so to me to me"
"you know this this tells us something"
"very important that that having genomic"
"uh differences genomic errors that's not"
"really primary if you really want to"
"defend against cancer you should have"
"the same type of large-scale um"
"constructive pattern memories in in you"
know
"stored biochemically by electrically"
"biomechanically whatever it's going to"
"be uh really uh strong so that any cell"
"that has uh ev even you know even an"
"inkling of trying to do something"
"different is overcome with this"
"connection with this functional"
"connection to a collective that's trying"
"to maintain organs tissues and and so on"
"so that's that's my favorite suppression"
"story michael this seems like it has"
"huge implications for thinking about"
"resilience broadly right i mean i think"
"that there's a sort of bias that many of"
"us have"
"thinking that well you know if you want"
"to have a system that is robust and can"
"you know be replicate order and all of"
"that that the system itself has to be"
"highly ordered and structured and that"
"like you have to be able to sort of see"
"you know how that that order gets"
"created like it's almost like you know a"
"sort of bureaucratic mindset about being"
"resilient but"
"um it seems like very often the systems"
"that are most resilient are the ones"
"that actually you know go through"
"challenges and then have to"
"you know change what they're doing or"
"add these layers or add this other"
"component um and you know often what you"
"end up with is something that's a total"
"clue um but that might be"
"much better at being resilient than"
"something that you know looks like it"
"has a structure that you could be like"
"oh i see how that would do this and this"
"and this and that would lead to you know"
"what the expected outcome is"
"yeah yeah for sure"
"yeah so um let me give some human"
"examples and we can segue to our final"
"segment about what all this means for um"
"for the um"
"future of humanity and the internet"
"internet age but when you were talking"
"about nosy neighbor"
"sells athena i was reminded of"
"jainism which is one of the strongest"
"and oldest religions"
"in india"
"and the jains have ascetics so basically"
they
"wander they don't"
"they wander from house to house and they"
"and they are fed by the households but"
"they operate in that capacity as the no"
"nosy neighbor uh their food restrictions"
"are so great that they can't accept food"
"unless it's unless it's pure"
"from their standpoints and so they'll"
"inspect the entire household before"
"they'll accept a morsel of food"
"and um and they also"
"sharply question the occupants of the"
"house and so on to see that they're good"
"upstanding jains and if they're not"
"and if they leave without food then the"
"whole community sees that and so so this"
"is actually a kind of a moral policing"
"seems a little"
"immune system-like almost very much so"
"and then uh also one of my favorite"
"episodes in this series is with uh ann"
"clin who is"
"a senior member of the volunteer"
"workforce of wikipedia and we have a"
"whole episode on how wikipedia works as"
well
"as it does and it's all of these checks"
"and balances and protections against"
"cheating coordination i mean it's so"
"reminiscent of our conversation"
"and um in my conversation with anne i"
"said and this this looks like the immune"
"system do you actually talk of it that"
"way do you actually use the metaphor the"
"immune system over there wikipedia and"
"she said oh yeah"
so
"i mean you know i mean it's needed"
"something like this is needed for any"
"form of higher level functional"
"organization be it a cell a"
"multicellular organism or a"
"well-functioning human"
"society such as wikipedia"
"and so with that"
"let's talk about what does all this mean"
"what um thinking have you done"
on
"modern human society it's electronically"
uh
connected
"and uh so"
electronic
"communication not only does it apply to"
"nervous systems but as we've seen in"
"this conversation web"
way
before
um
"so what what what are your thoughts on"
"on uh on"
"just the idea of"
"human cooperation which of course does"
"take place at"
"at uh"
"impressively large scales scales that"
"were unimaginable"
um
"even a few thousand years ago even a few"
"hundred years ago the the concept of"
"global cooperation was beyond the"
imagination
"i think"
"before several centuries"
"ago now it's something which not only"
"does it make sense but it's the only"
"thing that makes sense and we could many"
"people at least can appreciate"
that
"the need for a whole earth"
"epic that's the that's what needs to"
"work well and everything underneath it"
"needs to be coordinated"
"so what do you think of all this how do"
"you apply these ideas to to what tay"
"hard would have called"
"the omega point or there's some kind of"
"the prospects for some kind of global"
consciousness
"is it possible"
"um i think we can agree it's not"
inevitable
"uh so what are your thoughts on"
"on all of those things"
"yeah sure so"
"i mean i think that the big challenge is"
"a scaling issue so you know when we go"
"from small-scale societies to larger"
"scale societies if we look at how"
"small-scale societies you know regulate"
"cooperation and also how they sort of"
"have resilience built in to almost their"
"cultural dna you know we see these"
"systems that are basically"
"we call them need-based transfer systems"
"where people will help each other if"
"they have the resources to help um and"
"if someone is in need so you know many"
"of them still have like you know i this"
"this is mine and this is yours you know"
"these cows are mine and these are yours"
"but if um things get really bad and you"
"need something like i will help you and"
"i will give you a gift"
"that you know and i won't expect you to"
"pay me back and"
"those kinds of systems you know we see"
"across lots of small scale societies and"
"um you know from the messiah in"
"east africa they call it osotois to you"
"know fijians live you know and fish and"
"do horticulture um in you know the"
"fijian islands um they have a system"
"called kerry carey same thing it's this"
"need-based transfer system um now when"
"you start trying to scale up a"
"need-based transfer system though it can"
"can get more challenging so um i think"
"the best example we have from"
"small-scale societies is actually in"
"fiji where um often times a whole"
"village will get hit by a cyclone and um"
"what this means is that villages will"
"actually have relationships with each"
"other that are sort of dyadic village"
"village relationships of this um you"
"know uh this need-based transfer um norm"
"so they will help you know one village"
"will help a whole other village if"
"they're hit because within the village"
"people can't help each other athena i"
"want to nail down a point that you made"
"earlier there has to be a history of"
"this kind of thing happening for there"
"to be adaptations"
"to to um"
"uh to address it so a whole village"
"destruction like that that had to have"
"happened for this kind of arrangement to"
"have evolved in a constant environment"
"would that never happen why would you"
"expect a solution to it so so these are"
"all called for"
"by the uh so i just wanted to make that"
"point now continue please"
"yeah absolutely um and the you know the"
"scale of the"
"disasters and the challenges is super"
"important here it's like you know you"
"want to have systems where the risk is"
"um being shared at scales where there is"
"um variation in the likelihood of being"
"hit right so it's like you know because"
"cyclones are sort of often narrow things"
"um it's likely that one village um you"
"know well if one village is hit very"
"very hard a neighboring village probably"
"won't be hit as hard um but if you have"
"you know destructive events that are"
"much larger in scale um then you have to"
"think okay well what is the appropriate"
"scale then for these risk sharing"
"arrangements and you know i think as as"
"society has scaled up um there was never"
"any sort of conscious effort towards"
"taking these kinds of risk management"
"systems and scaling them up because"
"a lot of the economic growth"
"which fuels itself of course you know is"
"based on how you make the most efficient"
"transactions where you get the most"
"benefit for the least cost and you know"
"there are a lot of things that"
"capitalism works great for including"
"short-term efficiency but what it"
"doesn't do well is create systems where"
"risk is being effectively managed on"
"long temporal and and large spatial"
scales
so
"i see this as sort of the critical"
"issue for us um you know as a society"
"today how do we grapple with the risk"
"that we're facing"
"locally regionally"
"you know and you know on larger on"
"larger scales and then create the kinds"
of
"risk sharing systems that have served"
"our species so well for so long um and"
"translate that into something that makes"
"sense for our global society and i have"
"a feeling it'll probably be some hybrid"
"you know between"
"um need-based transfer type principles"
"and more account keeping base principles"
"just because the count keeping"
"principles are so pervasive and they"
"work for a lot of the things that you"
"know we need to happen in our society um"
"but i think we do need to"
"to think very"
"explicitly about how do we import"
"some of these um these these systems and"
"you know there's a lot of a lot of"
"things to draw from in terms of you know"
"like we already have a very"
"developed insurance industry um i think"
"insurance industries you know they're"
"also sort of grappling with how to deal"
"with increasing risk that um and the"
"increasing sort of um"
"entwinement of risk that you know"
"characterize our global society so"
"i i don't know i have hope that"
"that there's a realization that there"
"are many many problems here that maybe"
"we can solve with a with a solution that"
"incorporate some of these um these risk"
"sharing principles"
"that's great athena thank you michael"
"your turn and then i'll take my turn"
"well um two things i wanted to say one"
"one is um if we go back to this idea"
that
"uh one of the central"
"things that define a given"
agent
"whether it be human or something smaller"
"is that is the scale of their goals then"
"what we find is that uh humans are in a"
"very unique position if you are let's"
"say a goldfish and let's say you have a"
"a cognitive horizon of 30 minutes right"
"so all your goals you know you're not"
"you don't have any goals that are longer"
"than 30 minutes long let's say just for"
"the sake of argument then one of the"
"things that is true and i think it's"
"true for most organisms is that your"
"lifespan is actually longer than that"
"horizon meaning that all of your goals"
"are in fact achievable during your"
lifetime
"humans are perhaps uniquely in the"
"position where your goals temporally and"
"spatially could be enormous and and many"
"of them are absolutely not going to be"
"achievable during your lifetime because"
"because your goals are now bigger than"
"the whatever you know roughly hundred"
"years that that that we have and i have"
"a feeling that this gives rise to a lot"
"of unique um sort of uh issues in the"
"realm of psychology and psychiatry that"
"sit at the root of this of this"
"situation where for the first for the"
"first time you now have a set of"
"stressors and that's a whole other that"
"actually stresses a whole other thing we"
"could talk about you now have a set of"
"stressors about certain goals that are"
"guaranteed to not be achievable because"
"you know that you have this smaller"
"horizon of action so that i think puts a"
"lot of pressure on um"
"on on our activities uh the other the"
"other thing that i'll just mention is um"
"i i was once in a discussion with"
"someone um it was a podcast interview"
"and i got done talking about basically"
"trying to deconstruct a lot of these"
"binary categories because someone was"
"saying you know human this and human"
"that and i said look first"
"evolution-wise i don't you know it's"
"it's very smooth all the way back i'm"
"not even sure what exactly we're talking"
"about and then in terms of modern"
"hybridization so you could have a"
"creature that's you know 85 human brain"
"15 implanted technology and you can have"
"any percentage that you want right so"
"all of these are not binary categories"
"and and and so after all of this and"
"trying to explain all the varieties that"
"you would have a hard time saying if"
"this was a human or not he said okay"
"well then what is a human then what is"
"that anyway what what's a human anyway"
"right and i i think it's a really good"
"question and i think what we can't rely"
"on are"
"our um criteria based on what exactly"
"you're made of so what components are in"
"there or how you got here what"
"percentage no no yeah i don't think it's"
"three i think it's ridiculous to draw a"
"line and say if you've got at least you"
"know 92 percent of of things that were"
"evolved in the human lineage and the"
"rest are technology well then you're a"
"human i don't think that flies so if we"
"have to come up with a"
"more generic more useful"
"uh kind of a definition for what a human"
"is to begin with i think going back to"
"this you know my sort of"
"focus on on on on goals and air and"
"things you're concerned about you know"
"what are what are the things that you're"
"actually actively trying to achieve i"
"think that probably what a human needs"
"to be is the definition of a minimal"
"cognitive horizon that is uh has a has a"
"has a minimal radius of compassion"
"outwards so i think and this is this is"
"this is very compatible with the move"
"with ideas in in buddhist thought and"
"then other types of"
"other traditions where the point isn't"
"what you're made of the point is how"
"much care can you muster about the other"
"intelligences and the other sentient"
"beings around you so if if i had to"
"define what a human is i wouldn't talk"
"about um brain structure or or you know"
"time since uh speciation or any of that"
"stuff i would be looking at the set of"
"uh what what does your cognitive"
"structure allow you to have as goals"
"that are large enough that comprise"
"other sentient beings and if it's big"
"enough that you know if it's bigger than"
"a certain minimal level which i i'm not"
"going to be the one to set that level"
"obviously but but bigger than than a"
"particular radius then you are a fully"
"fledged human"
"no matter what you're made of or how you"
"got here and uh"
"then we can very comfortably"
"talk about things like uh diminished"
"capacity where okay something happened"
"and you're not in fact able to care"
"about the welfare of the standard number"
"of things that a human should be and so"
"in court certain things will happen and"
"it also lets us think about what i think"
"is inevitable which is the eventual"
"appearance of creatures that have"
"greater than human cognitive horizons"
"that may have in fact greater moral"
"responsibility because they actually can"
"they physically can care about more"
"things that a standard issue human can"
"care about and again there are"
"traditions that talk about that right"
"expansion of consciousness to the point"
"where you are actively able to care"
"about the well-being of a large number"
"of sentient creatures that a normal"
"person just can't you know you just"
"can't physically muster that in the"
"linear range of of what you can you can"
"um actively care about"
"and uh so so that's you know so those"
"are the kinds of things that i think"
"about is you know how do we define"
"humans in terms of in terms of both"
"moral responsibility and in fact"
"responsibility to these various"
"different kind of creatures based on"
"outward facing uh goals and what it is"
"that that they can care about with"
"respect to other sentient beings"
"wow okay well okay so i have a bit of"
"wrap up to do here uh i want to make a"
"connection with another episode with uh"
"jim cohen and gary sternberg"
"back to small-scale society and what jim"
"cohen calls social baseline theory which"
is
"or which takes note"
that
um
"humans never lived alone they always"
"lived in the context of uh"
"cooperative groups even when those"
"groups were warring with other groups"
"and as a result of that"
"genetic evolution"
has
"basically baked into our brains and"
bodies
"social resources in addition to personal"
"resources that when our brains and"
"bodies make their myriad trade-off"
decisions
"most of which are beneath consciousness"
"they're always factoring in social"
"resources in addition to"
"personal resources and in that sense we"
are
"members of colonies like an ant in a"
"colony much more so than"
"we have thought uh especially during the"
"age of individualism which is the last"
70
um
"70 years"
"so um"
"so there's a really interesting"
"connection there and then another point"
"i want to make a major point is that"
"there's two very"
"different mindsets for thinking about"
"being part of something larger than"
"oneself one has a very negative valence"
"like we're all in the matrix or we're"
"all going to be skin cells or we're all"
"memories of totalitarian regimes and"
"but then there's"
"a mindset with a highly positive"
"valence which is basically the religious"
"and spiritual"
mindset
"of being part of something larger than"
"ourselves and wanting to be part of"
"something larger than"
ourselves
and
"and it's at that point that you're more"
"joyful basically in becoming part"
"of this this describes so many people's"
"wartime experiences where you're so"
"bonded to your fighting unit that you'll"
"live and willingly die"
"for it where you can take a long-term"
goal
"that's longer than your lifetime we're"
"equipped to do that it happens all the"
time
so
"i think isn't it interesting and of"
"course it all boils down"
"to whether the individual perceives"
"this that being part of something larger"
"than themselves as benign or not for"
"themselves and"
"and when they when they think it's"
"benign then it's something that they"
"willingly do and it's"
"it's probably the optimal human"
"experiences to be is to be part of"
"something larger than yourself and at a"
"more mundane level"
"i think i'm speaking of it in high"
"spiritual terms back to my interview"
"with anne clin on on wikipedia why is"
"that so"
"engaging for the you know the hundreds"
"and thousands of people that that just"
"love working on a volunteer basis for"
"wikipedia well it's because it's a"
"pro-social cause wikipedia is doing"
"you know such wonderful work if you join"
it
and
"you get to interact with like-minded"
"people it's just so very"
"so very fulfilling they love becoming"
"part of something larger than themselves"
"and they'll spend all of their"
"discretionary time"
"doing it so there is this positive face"
"athena you want to"
"chip in on this yeah i want to just"
"emphasize that point you know i think"
"that we have a deep desire to"
"contribute um to be a part of something"
"and you know many um years ago right i"
"worked on this idea of the walk away"
"strategy like you know you're in a group"
"and you leave if there isn't sufficient"
"cooperation well i think there's another"
"piece that's very similar um in terms of"
"the mechanism but it's it's kind of the"
"opposite like"
"you will leave a group if you feel like"
"you don't have an opportunity to"
"contribute or if your"
"contribution isn't valued and i think"
"that is a really deep desire that we as"
"humans have is to be a part of something"
"where we are contributing to make it"
"better at least for most humans and um"
"that i think is kind of"
"you know often not really acknowledged"
"as a you know deep and legitimate human"
"drive but i i think it's there and"
"wikipedia is such a great"
"example of that"
"and i think that um"
"that when it comes to the the scale of"
our
social
"identities kind of the scale of our"
"compassion which michael you were"
"talking about there's such flexibility"
"there because so many of our groups are"
"socially constructed almost all of them"
then
"the identity is that flexible we could"
"regard ourselves as as citizens of our"
"nations or our religions or our small"
groups
"why not the whole earth in fact there's"
"no no more stretch of the imagination"
"to consider ourselves"
"first and foremost human beings"
"and citizens of the world then first and"
"foremost democrats are"
"or republicans they're all social"
"uh social constructions but then comes"
"of course to what actually"
"we do on that basis and how those things"
"compete with other"
"forms of behavior at the end of the day"
"it comes down to a form of cultural"
selection
"which needs to be"
"itself culturally"
um
culturally
"uh constructed so for that half full"
"glass with the blind component and the"
"intentional component of cultural"
evolution
"needs to become more intentional than"
"ever before"
"and it needs to be experimental because"
"we don't know"
"what the consequences of our actions are"
"really all we can do is make informed"
"guesses then we have to experiment"
"again and again and again and then we"
"have to be mindful about what we're"
"trying to accomplish and then selecting"
"the things that get us in that"
"direction so it ends up being"
a
"essentially an intentional form of"
"cultural evolution with the welfare of"
"the whole system"
"in mind and everything underneath that"
"being appropriately coordinated it's"
"basically a managed process of cultural"
"evolution at the global scale"
"is what is"
"needed and nothing less will do is the"
"way i frame it"
"so uh please share your thoughts you"
"know let's have a wrap-up session"
"and then this has been such a wonderful"
"addition to our"
"uh series on the science of the noaa"
"sphere uh athena you want to go first"
"and then michael well i think that you"
"know this whole question of how you know"
"what what do we need to do in terms of"
"sort of cultural infrastructure to help"
"us be more resilient is really the the"
question
"um and the problem of our generation and"
"you know if we kind of just assume well"
"you know the tech billionaires will"
"figure out how to solve it with uh you"
know
"technology and money and um you know"
"becoming interplanetary or whatever then"
"i think you know we kind of lost a lot"
"of our autonomy to create the kinds of"
"systems that we want that not only will"
"help us be more resilient on a really"
"large scale level but also will help to"
"sort of you know feed us as humans that"
"need to be embedded in social"
"environments where you know we do feel"
"like um we have a safety net and i think"
"that's a really it's a really"
"fundamental thing um that we"
"that we have"
"really built in to"
"our evolutionary heritage because you"
"know humans that were"
"not embedded in"
"social environments where they had"
"safety nets were"
"not as likely to make it you know than"
"as those who did let alone you know"
"societies that had cultural structures"
"that had those safety nets um you know"
"those were"
"much more likely to do well in the you"
"know sort of cultural evolution stage so"
"i think that"
"you know thinking about how can we"
"make that um transition and be"
"intentional about the structures that"
"we're we're you know introducing on um"
"you know these"
"regional global levels that you know and"
"think about sort of the scales and have"
a
"a structure where you have multiple your"
"you have multiple levels um that solve"
"the problems that are at those different"
"levels um you know using some principles"
"kind of like you know some of these"
"principles from ostrom and some of these"
"principles from small-scale societies"
"that use need-based transfers i think uh"
"could be really great and i'd love to"
"see a a more sort of purposeful"
"discussion about how do we implement or"
"at least test out you know some of these"
"strategies on a larger scale because you"
"don't necessarily want to say okay"
"here's the one solution now everybody"
"just needs to do this"
"right you want to like say okay here"
"well we could try this out at a higher"
"scale here um you know with these"
"partners and then see how it goes so"
"so that's what i would like to see"
"well um here's what i'd like to see as"
"well this is this is kind of my my wish"
"list um what what what i think uh we"
"need of to optimize that relationship"
"between our individual agency and the"
"benefits of of belonging to various"
"large-scale structures"
"is the ability to"
"have some inkling into what the goals of"
"the structure are so we can choose which"
"ones we join so i think i think a huge"
"limitation on our agency is that we join"
"things having absolutely no idea what"
"our contribution to them is going to"
"lead to what this what the group is"
"doing it used to be easy you could look"
"and you could say okay i could be part"
"of part of these folks doing what they"
"do or i could be part of these folks"
"doing what they do that that it is now"
"almost impossible to know all of the"
"choices that you make in terms of what"
"you consume online what kind of products"
"you interact with what groups you you"
"hang around with um extremely difficult"
"to know what the what the end result of"
"all of that is going to be so i look"
"forward to a future where we have"
"tools initially can conceptual apparatus"
"because this doesn't exist yet so this"
"needs to be developed and ultimately"
"some sort of tool whether that be some"
"some ai type of visualizer or something"
"that enables you to make better informed"
choices
"about which kinds of things you want to"
"be a part of and uh and this means not"
"just the kind of the obvious stuff i"
"mean all of us make choices about what"
"groups we join that that guy that's kind"
"of obvious but all of the um"
"really developing a science of"
predicting
"the goals and the"
"cognitive capacities of large-scale"
"kinds of systems that we are terrible at"
"recognizing as large agents we don't"
"understand ways in which they're going"
"to deform our action space um all of"
"these things that are that are very hard"
"to predict and completely not obvious so"
"that's what i look forward to i look"
"forward to all of us subunits uh having"
"having a choice about um what larger uh"
"thing we're going to be a part of so"
"this has been an amazing conversation a"
"wonderful addition to our science of the"
"no sphere"
"series and wonderful affirmation of the"
"fact that when we tell this story"
"we need to include the entire arc from"
really
"the origin of life all the way up to the"
"internet age and this uh this level that"
"we've been dwelling on of the single"
cell
"and multicellularity so informative who"
"would have known i think that i think"
"that almost everyone who listens to this"
"is just going to be amazed"
"at what we've been covering and its"
"relevance to"
"to um"
"our current"
"our current moment in human uh cultural"
"evolution so thank you so much"
and
"and uh i had a great time"
"thank you so much too yeah great great"
"conversation thank you"
you
