"um thank you so much for having me here"
i'm
"very much looking forward to uh sharing"
"with you some ideas at the intersection"
"of developmental biology cognitive"
"science and computer science and in"
"particular we're going to talk about uh"
"what biology can tell us about cognition"
"outside of the brain and in fact across"
"scales of organization that might be"
"really good inspiration for artificial"
intelligence
"and the main points for today are"
"basically these that biology exhibits"
"intelligence at every level"
"it operates as a kind of unconventional"
"agent in many different spaces besides"
"the typical three-dimensional world of"
"behavior that we think about"
"and indeed neuroscience is an"
"elaboration of a much more ancient"
"computational system which i will"
"describe today called developmental"
"bioelectricity and this guides the"
"trajectory of the body through"
morphospace
"and i'm going to show you how dynamic"
"robust anatomical control is basically"
"the output of a collective intelligence"
"of cellular swarms and i'm going to show"
"you how we can now both read and write"
"the cognitive medium of this agent"
"and finally the this idea that"
"multi-scale competency and other"
"strategies that we find in biology that"
"do not rely on neuromorphic"
"architectures meaning do not rely on"
"mimicking the structure and function of"
brains
"may represent a really uh important"
direction
"for engineering novel and and hybrid"
"intelligences so let's think first about"
"cognition outside the brain and to to"
"really talk about artificial"
"intelligence we need to look at what we"
"mean by natural intelligence and try to"
"provide some sort of definition for it"
"obviously there are many i'm going to"
"start by just widening our perspective a"
"little bit from the usual way that we"
"think about intelligence and brains and"
"how that relates to artificial"
intelligence
"so the first thing is that biology is"
"deeply multi-scale so we study"
"computation and cognition all the way"
"from genetic networks which in fact have"
"learning capacity to subcellular"
"components like cytoskeleton of course"
"neural networks which many people do"
"tissues and organs uh in fact whole"
"organisms and swarms such as such as ant"
"colonies and the first thing that i"
"would like to point out is that all"
"intelligences are collective"
"intelligences there's no such thing as"
"an intelligence that is a single"
"indivisible unit"
"everything uh is made of parts and in"
"particular all intelligences are made of"
"components and it's a major uh uh goal"
"to try to understand how large scale"
"intelligence arises from the"
"functionality of its individual"
"components so so we're all a kind of"
"collective intelligence and in fact"
"single cells are extremely competent so"
"here what you see is a single cell"
"creature known as a lacrimaria so"
"you know observe observe um"
"the the the incredible this is real time"
"so observe the incredible uh"
"morphological control as this animal"
"hunts in for for uh bacteria and other"
"things in its environment so we too are"
"a bag of cells such as these and so uh"
"this this many into one problem is"
"really fundamental to ask how do"
"individual life forms such as this work"
"together to provide a large-scale agent"
"that has some sort of a centralized"
"intelligence a centralized feeling of"
"self and so on and uh a key thing that"
"i'm going to talk about today is that"
"these the bioelectric mechanisms that"
normally
"provide for this in the human brain in"
"fact in all animal brains are"
"not just"
"restricted to brains but in fact are an"
"ancient evolutionary system that was"
"here long before brains and neurons"
"appeared uh neural architectures evolved"
"by specializing functions that were"
"happening in cells long before"
"evolution discovered brains and"
"basically speed optimized these kind of"
"electrical dynamics that"
"were here uh very early from about the"
"time of bacterial biofilms so all of the"
"components such as ion channels and"
"electrical synapses and so on now and in"
"neurotransmitter signaling that we"
"associate with with complex brains are"
"basically just elaborations of things"
"that even pre um pre-multicellular life"
"forms can do and there's a there's a"
"review here if you're interested in the"
details
"and so um"
"in order to uh to to start kind of"
"widening our our approach i want to"
"think about uh the intersection of"
"control of body morphology and memory"
"and learning and so first i need to"
"introduce you to this animal this is a"
"model system known as a planarian these"
"are flatworms you're seeing one here"
"they are not like an earthworm they are"
"much more complex they are similar to"
"our direct ancestor they have a true"
"brain as all the neurotransmitters that"
"you and i have centralized"
"kind of kind of architecture lots of"
"different organs inside and one one"
"other thing that's amazing about these"
"planaria is that you can cut them into"
"pieces and every piece will regenerate"
"exactly what's needed no more no less to"
"form a perfect little worm the record is"
"something like 275 pieces every piece"
"knows exactly what a correct worm looks"
"like and uh in fact the animal is so"
"highly regenerative that they are"
"immortal okay they have they don't age"
"at the level of the of the of the animal"
"and so uh so the reason i'm showing this"
"to you is that uh what's remarkable"
"about these animals that can regenerate"
"their brains is that if you train a"
"planarian onto some piece of information"
"such as that uh its home where it gets"
"fed is a particular area with these"
"little at least little rough bumps"
"then what you can do is amputate the"
"head the tail will sit there doing"
"nothing while the head regenerates when"
"the head and the brain regenerates you"
"can test the animal behaviorally and"
"discover that it still has the original"
information
"so in some way the memory that this"
"creature is formed"
"was not only stored outside of the head"
"but actually also imprinted on the"
"regenerating brain so as to provide for"
"for behavior that takes into account the"
"knowledge that it had so so as we start"
"to think about where uh memory learning"
"uh preferences and so on are located we"
"can start to think about"
"this these really important dynamics"
"that are not just focused on brains and"
"so this uh leads us to to the point of"
"uh trying to look at some unconventional"
intelligences
"from the perspective that um if memory"
"and uh these kinds of mechanisms can"
"exist without a brain could intelligence"
"do so as well and uh what might that"
"look like and so so here i'm going to"
"provide some examples of course there"
"are many definitions of intelligence um"
what
"i will try to uh generalize it as uh"
"solving problems in arbitrary spaces so"
"we all know about navigating"
"three-dimensional behavioral space so"
"there's all kinds of clever animals that"
"will do things to navigate"
"three-dimensional space and thus"
"demonstrate their intelligence by uh"
"by by solving various problems in the"
"space but in fact life long before it"
"started solving problems in behavioral"
"space it was solving problems in other"
"spaces for example transcriptional space"
"or the very high dimensional space of"
"all the different genes that could be"
"turned on and off at any given moment"
"it was solving problems in amorphous"
"space which is uh the space of all"
"possible anatomical configurations of"
"the body during development and"
"remodeling and it was solving problems"
"in physiological or metabolic space"
"and so"
"one can one can"
"generalize this idea of intelligence to"
"the functionality in these various other"
"kinds of spaces not just"
"three-dimensional behavior and one could"
"also say that the degree of intelligence"
"is proportional to the ability to not"
"get trapped by local optima so for"
"example uh you could imagine a scenario"
"like this where the shortest path to"
"your goal is right here here's the"
"straight line but if in fact you had a"
"particular degree of cognitive"
"sophistication that allowed you to have"
"patience and to move temporarily further"
"from your goal to eventually get closer"
"right to get around this local optimum"
"then then you might be said to have a"
"higher uh higher capacity so i'm going"
"to show you"
"three or four examples of the kinds of"
"problems that biology solves"
"now the first is an example of solving a"
"problem in transcriptional and"
"physiological space imagine here's our"
"planarian and what we showed a couple"
"years ago is that if you put this"
"planarian into a solution of barium uh"
"their heads explode now what is barium"
"barium is a non-specific blocker of all"
"potassium channels so the cells are very"
"unhappy the heads explode um that makes"
"sense but the most amazing thing is that"
"over the next couple of weeks they"
"regrow a new head and the new head is"
"completely barium and sensitive no"
"problem with bearing whatsoever and we"
"looked at the gene expression to ask why"
"is this what's different about this head"
"versus the normal head that explodes and"
"the answer is a very few genes were"
"upload and down regulated to enable"
"these cells to do their business in the"
"absence of this novel stressor and the"
"amazing thing here is that barium is"
"never encountered by planaria in the"
"wild it's just not something they ever"
"come across in in the world and so"
"there's no uh evolutionarily um"
"baked in a way for them to know how to"
"respond to it and i always think about"
"this as uh kind of this"
"this this problem feels to me like"
"you're in a a nuclear reactor control"
"room and the thing is melting down and"
"you have to know which of these buttons"
"are going to turn on and off right which"
"genes out of tens of thousands of genes"
"that the planarian has would you turn on"
"and off and in some way that we still"
"don't understand this animal very"
"rapidly navigates to that region of"
"transcriptional space choosing out of"
"all of those genes just a handful that"
"will allow it to solve this completely"
"novel stressor we have no idea how this"
"works but it's an it's an incredible"
"example of problem solving in a very"
"high dimensional space"
"another example is"
"functional tolerance to changes of"
"architecture so what you see here is a"
"tadpole here's the tadpole here are the"
"nostrils here's the brain here's the gut"
"and here's the tail now one thing you'll"
"notice is that there are no eyes where"
"the eyes are supposed to go but in fact"
"we've produced an eye on the tail"
"and it turns out that these animals"
"which have no eyes in the head but eyes"
"on the tail can see perfectly well we"
"built a machine to assay their their"
"learning rate in various visual visual"
"kinds of tasks"
"they can uh they can they can see"
"perfectly well and so this this"
"architecture which for for millions of"
"years um"
"expected visual input from a particular"
"region in the brain now has this weird"
"itchy patch of tissue on its tail that's"
"providing some sort of electrical"
"signals and the brain has no problem"
"interpreting that as visual data uh"
"taking the information up which often"
"synapses on the spinal cord actually"
"taking that information and folding it"
"into its behavioral repertoire so"
"incredible uh tolerance to an"
"architecture very rapid architecture"
"this is not uh you know this is not a"
"millennia of of evolution this is an"
"immediate change that we make over"
"several days in our lab and the brain"
"adapts to it very rapidly"
"another example that i want to show you"
"is that of robust memory encoding"
"so here's a caterpillar"
"this is a kind of soft bodied robot that"
"crawls around and choose plants"
"and it needs to turn into a hard bodied"
"robot which flies and drinks nectar so"
"you need a completely different"
"controller for these two kinds of bodies"
"and during the process of metamorphosis"
"the brain of the caterpillar is"
"basically liquefied most of the uh"
"neurons die all the neural um synaptic"
"connections are broken the whole thing"
"is is taken apart and rebuilt into a new"
"kind of brain for a moth or butterfly"
"and the remarkable thing here and you"
"can you can read more about this in this"
"review is that"
"during this process memories remain so"
"the moth or caterpillar or butterfly"
"shows uh evidence of recall of things"
"that the caterpillar learned so so of"
"course we would love to have memory"
"media like this that when you radically"
"uh change them and move all the parts"
"around and reconstruct them the"
"information still remains we don't have"
"any technology like that"
"but and it is not at all known how the"
"information is encoded except that it's"
"incredibly robust to these large scale"
changes
"and um the final example that i want to"
"uh to show you and this is one of the"
"most important that we'll study here is"
"the idea of goal directedness and here"
"i'm going to bring up a topic called"
"anatomical homeostasis so this animal"
"here is a salamander it happens to be"
"the axolotl"
"it is incredibly regenerative so it will"
"grow back"
"limbs eyes jaws"
"portions of the brain and heart spinal"
"cord ovaries and so on and so what that"
"looks like is this if it loses an arm it"
"will continue to to build very rapidly"
"and then eventually it gets to this"
"point but it's at this point where it"
"has a perfect duplicate of the original"
"and then it stops okay so one of the"
"most amazing questions about this is how"
"does it know when to stop because it"
"stops when a correct salamander arm has"
"been produced now if you if you amputate"
"at the shoulder you will start here and"
"grow all of these parts if you amputate"
"at the elbow you will start here and"
"only grow these parts they all end at"
"exactly the same time so this this is a"
"system that continues to to remodel"
"trying to keep this particular"
"anatomical configuration and it can get"
"there from diverse starting positions"
"whether you start here or you start here"
"you get to the same point"
"doing only exactly what it needs to do"
"now uh not only can this system handle"
"diverse starting positions but it can"
"handle radical perturbations along the"
"way so if you take an early uh in early"
"embryo of many kinds including human you"
"split it in half you don't get two half"
"embryos the way you would if you cut up"
"any of our current robotics or computer"
"architectures you get two perfectly"
"viable monozygotic twins okay so so the"
"system can can regulate for the fact"
"that half of it is missing regrow what's"
"needed and you're back to normal"
"in fact it is also tolerant to to really"
"uh powerful uh perturbations such as a"
"drastic change in the uh at the time at"
"the smallest level of its subunits so"
"for example here this is a cross-section"
"of a lumen of a kidney tubule from a"
"salamander and here you can see that it"
"has eight to ten cells that all talk to"
"each other and to communicate to form"
"this the structure if we artificially"
"make the cells gigantic basically by uh"
"by multiplying the amount of chromosomes"
"but not letting the cells divide at an"
"early point uh this"
"incredibly this produces a viable"
"salamander and what you'll see here is"
"that as the cells get bigger"
"fewer of them are working together to"
"build the exact same type of anatomical"
"structure and when the cells get really"
"gigantic just one cell bends around"
"itself to produce the same anatomical"
"unit so what you're seeing here is that"
"the system is uh is is tolerant to"
"massive changes in its uh components and"
"when the components change the system is"
"able to call up different molecular"
"pathways so here cell to cell"
"communication here cytoskeletal bending"
"to call call out um"
"diverse kinds of molecular pathways to"
"implement a large-scale goal okay and it"
"can do this despite this this massive"
"perturbation of radically changing its"
"its components and the final piece of"
"this is that it can get where it's going"
"via different paths so this is"
"uh part of our regenerative uh medicine"
"efforts uh on"
"on on trying to grow back limbs and so"
"this is a frog frog limbs normally do"
"not grow back after amputation so here"
"you can see after 45 days later you get"
"nothing we designed a cocktail which"
"i'll describe shortly that triggers leg"
"regeneration and you can see that"
"immediately you start getting some some"
"toes and a toenail up here and"
"eventually a pretty good frog leg but"
"one of the uh cool things about this is"
"that this is not how frog legs normally"
"develop this is the normal developmental"
"sequence of a frog leg you get you get a"
"paddle with um uh with with the fingers"
"and then and then the parts in between"
"die off by programmed cell death that is"
"not what happens here the this has a"
"central stalk and then a bunch of toes"
"come off from the sides almost like a"
"plant meristem but then eventually gets"
"to the same point of having a very nice"
"frog leg so we can get to the same goal"
"despite uh perturbations from diverse"
"starting positions and via lots of"
"different paths so"
"in order to start thinking about how"
"biology makes such robust uh"
"such robust systems that solve all these"
"problems in different spaces anatomical"
"space and physiological space and so on"
"let's start off by asking where is"
"anatomy specified in the first place so"
"this is a cross section of a human torso"
"and you can see here all the different"
"organs and structures right this is this"
"is incredible invariant order every"
"every normal human has all this in the"
"same uh in the same configuration all"
"the organs and tissues of the right"
"shape size position and so on where does"
"this come from because we all start life"
"uh here as of as a collection of"
"embryonic blastomeres that have to build"
this
"now if you're thinking dna uh the genome"
"is certainly important but we actually"
"know what's in the genome now because we"
"can read it and what's in the genome are"
"protein sequences they're descriptions"
"not even at the cellular level but of"
"the most uh of the smallest molecular"
"hardware that these cells get to deploy"
"and so there's nothing directly in the"
"genome about shape or size or anything"
"like that"
"so where does the anatomical"
"order come from how do the cells know"
"how to build this and uh in regenerative"
"medicine we worry about how we and we"
"influence those cells to let's say"
"restore something that's missing but as"
"engineers we also ask what else can"
"these same cells build given the exact"
"same hardware meaning the same genome"
"what else are they willing to build and"
"i'm going to show you that um shortly"
"so the nice thing about"
"these these cells is that individual"
"cells is that you can see that it's"
"handling its uh morphological"
"physiological and behavioral needs at"
"the level of a single cell"
"but when these cells got together during"
"multicellularity they actually started"
"to pursue much larger goals and the"
"goals that they pursue"
"are these these are these are the kinds"
"of morphologies that are that are made"
"in embryonic development and then"
"defended during regeneration and these"
"are lots of cells cooperating together"
"to form and and maintain very large"
"structures much bigger than than"
themselves
"and so uh"
"you know this process can go wrong in"
"many different ways for example this is"
"a tumor that has hair and teeth and bone"
"and muscle because the stem cell biology"
"went fine meaning the you got all the"
"different cell types that you needed but"
"the three-dimensional structure is"
"completely off this is not the same"
"thing as a viable animal so how does"
"this work how does"
"what is the relationship between the"
"genome and the anatomy and"
"what i'm going to describe in the rest"
"of the talk is that there's a very"
"important intermediate layer which has"
"to do with information processing"
"between the hardware of the genome and"
"the resulting behavior in amorphous"
"space and you can see an example of it"
here
"this is something we discovered a few"
"years ago this is uh if you think about"
"metamorphosis from a tadpole to a frog"
"this is a normal tadpole here are the"
"eyes here are the nostrils the brain"
"this face has to be rearranged in order"
"to make a frog okay the nostrils have to"
"move the jaws have to come out the"
"eyes have to move everything has to move"
"around and it was thought that somehow"
"what the genetics gives you is a system"
"that moves all these pieces in the right"
"direction the right amount uh every"
"single time because then you will get"
"from a standard temple to a standard"
"frog so what we did was we created"
"so-called picasso tadpoles everything is"
"in the wrong place the eyes are off on"
"the top of the head the the jaws are off"
"to the side the nostrils everything"
"everything is moved and what we found is"
"that remarkably these animals still give"
"rise to pretty normal frogs because all"
"of the different components will start"
"to move"
"in unnatural paths sometimes they go too"
"far and have to double back actually"
"until they get to a correct frog face"
"and then they settle down so what the"
"genetics actually gives us is a system"
"that's able to do this kind of error"
"minimization scheme it's able to uh the"
"cells and the tissues are able to work"
"together towards a specific anatomy and"
"when things are changed they uh flexibly"
"pursue other paths through amorphous"
"space to get to the correct"
"configuration and it's this kind of"
"problem solving that"
"i think has has many lessons to teach us"
"for synthetic systems now uh in contrast"
"to the things that single cells care"
"about which is metabolic uh metabolic"
"needs and and things like that"
"this system is trying to maintain a"
"large scale very large scale morphology"
"and the thing is that these uh this the"
"scale the scale of the goals that that"
"these systems are trying to pursue in"
"the sense in the cybernetic sense right"
"these are things they're trying to"
optimize
"can drastically change so going from"
"multicellularity from from single cells"
"to multicellularity the goals scale up"
"from single cell types of concerns to to"
"making this large structure but they can"
"also scale down during the lifetime of"
"the organism so what you see here are"
"cancer cells these are human"
"glioblastoma cells in culture and these"
"cells have abandoned these uh the goals"
"that um"
"that they used to contribute towards in"
"the body and have basically reverted to"
"a single cell lifestyle where they treat"
"the rest of the animal is just"
"environment and so it becomes really"
"interesting and important to ask how the"
"scaling happens how do individual cells"
"scale up to a system that is able to"
"exhibit intelligent problem-solving"
"behavior within morphospace right uh and"
"uh and and how does this and how does"
"the process fall apart so again this"
"many into one transition how do"
"competent pieces give rise to larger"
"holes with larger goals okay"
"and so for this uh what we're going to"
"talk about is bioelectricity as a"
"cognitive binder as a kind of medium in"
"which anatomical decisions are made so"
"that we can see how it is that uh that"
"the the the the intelligence and the"
"goal directedness of these cells scale"
"up in in this kind of system"
so
"let's let's just uh think about how this"
"works in the brain so in the brain the"
"hardware is a bunch of cells that are"
"expressing various ion channels this"
"enables them to have electrical activity"
"and this electrical activity can be"
"viewed as a sort of software uh which"
"guides the or controls the functionality"
"of muscles which moves the body in"
"three-dimensional space so this is"
"what's under the hood of typical"
"intelligences of biological intelligence"
"is that we try to mimic in in ai"
"and so uh this this system of course uh"
"it's it's a commitment of neuroscience"
"that if we learned to image this uh this"
"electrical activity and decoded this is"
"called neural decoding we should be able"
"to infer about the cognitive state of"
"the creature what is it thinking about"
"what are the memories what are the the"
"plans and so on right that's where the"
"information is and it turns out that all"
"cells do this so the system is extremely"
"isomorphic and so non-neural cells also"
"all drive these electrical dynamics"
"which are then instead of guiding"
"muscles to move you through"
"three-dimensional space what it does is"
"issues commands to cells like"
"proliferate migrate change shape and so"
"on that will move the body configuration"
"through morphospace so so what i think"
"evolution does is pivot the exact same"
"trick this this bioelectrical"
"architecture which i'll talk about more"
"in a minute"
"to solve problems in diverse spaces what"
"we're trying to do is to use the"
"techniques of neuroscience and also"
"develop some new ones to read these"
"electrical uh electrical properties so"
"here you see a voltage-sensitive"
"fluorescent dye showing the early cells"
"in a frog embryo here's all the"
"electrical conversations that they're"
"having with each other to sort out who's"
"going to be head tail and so on uh to to"
"to read and interpret this information"
"and thus try to basically"
"read the proto-cognitive"
"content of tissues and organs as they"
"make these decisions in"
"solving problems in amorphous space"
"so we developed"
"some of the first tools to"
"read and write this electrical"
"information so you saw the voltage die"
"which allows you to"
"peek under the hood and read the"
"electrical state of these tissues and"
"then we developed functional techniques"
"that will allow us to uh to write"
"information into that uh into that"
"medium and this is so there are no"
"electrodes there are no electric fields"
"there's no electromagnetism no external"
"um application of fields or currents or"
"anything like that what we do is we go"
"in using tools like optogenetics and and"
"and things like that to manipulate the"
"native machinery that uh that tissues"
"are using to uh process information"
"electrically so that means changing the"
"topology of the network by directly"
"altering these"
"cell to cell electrical synapses so"
"regulating which cell gets to talk to"
"each other cell electrically and how"
"and we can go in and actually directly"
"change the voltage state of any cell by"
"opening or closing these ion channels so"
"for example using drugs or light or"
"mutation of these channels"
"we can directly"
"influence the voltage pattern so we have"
"some sort of tissue here that's not"
"necessarily nervous and we can control"
"the topology and the electric state of"
"specific cells for example by putting"
"down light masks and so on and"
"when you start to read and write this"
"electric electric information something"
"very interesting happens the first thing"
"is that you at the level of single cells"
"you can begin to control whether cells"
"are connected to these large-scale"
"gold-directed structures so"
"we inject a human oncogene into this"
"tadpole eventually it makes a tumor but"
"even before you can visually see the"
"tumor you can already tell which cells"
"are going to defect by tracking their"
"bioelectric state and here here it is"
"using that voltage-sensitive dye this is"
"uh obviously uh could be the beginnings"
"of a diagnostic modality but the"
"interesting thing is that the first"
"thing that occu gene does"
"is cause the cells to acquire an"
"aberrant electrical potential and thus"
"disconnect from the rest of the network"
"and at that point it's just an amoeba in"
"an environment and that's how you get"
"metastasis and it will just go where"
"life is good and try to proliferate as"
"much as possible but if you artificially"
"uh control this this bioelectric change"
and
"force the cell to remain electrically"
"coupled to its neighbors then there is"
"no tumor here in red is where the"
"oncogene is it's blazingly strong in"
"fact it's all over the place here but"
"there is no tumor because we uh force"
"that cell to stay in electrical contact"
"with its neighbors and the network uh"
"the the electrical pattern at the level"
"of the network dominates individual cell"
"states and forces that cell to keep"
"working towards making a nice nice"
"organs and a nice epithelium and so on"
"so that's at the level of a single cell"
"now it also turns out that these"
"patterns uh are are critical to very"
"large scale morphogenesis in the body so"
"this is a time-lapse video of voltage as"
"the frog embryo puts its face together"
"and this was discovered by my colleague"
"danny adams it's a it's what we call the"
"electric face here's one frame out of"
"that movie what you see is that long"
"before the genes come on and the organs"
"are formed there is a pre pattern"
"already that you can read out here's the"
"eye here's the mouth here are the"
"placards it's already there's already a"
"pattern that you can read out from the"
"tissue about where all of the gene"
"expressions and the anatomical"
"structures are supposed to go and i'm"
"showing you this one because it's quite"
"obvious the electric face looks like a"
"face it's easily uh it's easily decoded"
"most patterns are not like this they"
"don't look like the actual thing that"
"they're going to be and there's a lot of"
"decoding that has to happen but this"
"obviously was one we cracked early on"
"because it's so simple it's a"
"it's a it's quite a quite a direct uh"
"quite a direct type of pattern and so uh"
"what you can do is you can you can"
"basically peek into the uh to the"
"computations that this tissue is doing"
"about where it's going to place its"
"different structures and even in humans"
"when this process goes awry for example"
"a mutated ion channel you get things"
"like anderson table syndrome which have"
"craniofacial dysmorphias and defects of"
"the limb and the brain and so on"
"and so uh so so so somatic electrical"
"activity is a kind of cognitive medium"
"by which uh the the collective of cells"
"makes anatomical decisions about what"
"it's going to build and we know this"
"because we can now manipulate it so for"
"example here's a tadpole here are the"
"eyes here's the brain up here what we"
"can do is we can inject some rna that's"
"going to become an ion channel that will"
"take these cells which are faded to be"
"gut so these are these cells that we can"
"make the digestive system and we can put"
"in uh an ion channel that brings it to a"
"voltage the a pattern that is"
"appropriate to an eye okay so we can"
"establish an eye pattern and when you do"
"this the cells obey and they make a"
"perfectly good eye with lens of retina"
"and so on out of cells that were"
"previously going to be gut so you can"
"induce ectopic eyes you can induce"
"ectopic limbs here's our five-legged"
"frog we can also make brain and heart"
"and things like that"
"the couple of interesting things here"
"one is that"
"this is incredibly modular so we don't"
"know how to micromanage the production"
"of an eye or a hand it's too difficult"
"what we have found is a subroutine in"
"the system which is basically triggered"
"by a particular bioelectrical pattern"
"and that subroutine says build an eye"
"here or build a leg here and we can"
"trigger these complex things this is of"
"course very nice for regenerative"
"medicine because we can um"
"we can we can trigger these things"
without
"without having to understand all of the"
"steps that go into into building that we"
"don't need to micromanage it and in fact"
"we can go further and uh not only not"
"only create new ectopic organs but"
"actually fix uh very complex organs such"
"as the brain here's what a normal brain"
"looks like here's a defective brain of a"
"tadpole that has a mutation in an"
"important neural gene or has been"
"exposed to nicotine or alcohol or"
"whatever we can now counteract this by"
"true by opening and closing channels as"
"directed by a very specific"
"computational model that told us how to"
"fix it and in fact uh the we tested"
"those predictions"
"and we got back normal brains with"
"correct shape correct gene expression"
"and in fact correct behavior so they get"
"their iqs back they can learn again"
"so so this this bioelectric layer is is"
"a really tractable system in which with"
"uh some some help from from"
"computational tools we can start to"
"understand what the collective"
"intelligence of the cells is trying to"
"do and guided towards normal novel"
"outcomes when when it's appropriate now"
"one of the things that i'm going to"
"claim is that this this bioelectrical"
system
"forms the memory medium of the"
"collective agent working in morphospace"
"and i'm going to show you an example of"
"this of how this works so here are here"
"are our planaria again"
"you see here that uh on the left there's"
"a perfectly normal one-headed worm and"
"um uh"
"it it has uh uh it has this this blue"
"here is a gene expression that is an"
"anterior gene it marks the head so you"
"can see it's present in the head not"
"present in the tail and when we uh when"
"we amputate this uh the head and the"
"tail the middle fragment regenerates"
"into a perfectly normal worm one had one"
"tail so that's the normal story and that"
"that happens with incredible fidelity"
"100 of the time now here on the right"
"you see a different scenario again a"
"one-headed normal anatomically normal"
"worm again the anterior genes are in the"
"head no anterior genes in the tail but"
"when we amputate"
"the head and the tail here the middle"
"fragment gives rise to a two-headed worm"
"has heads on both sides this is not"
"photoshopped these are these are real"
"worms um"
"and now why would now why would this"
"happen and it happens because what we've"
"done in the meantime is uh manipulate"
"the normal bioelectric pattern that"
"tells this this tissue how many heads"
"it's supposed to have so here is a"
"depolarization region that says one head"
"and one tail and what we've done is"
"establish the change this pattern"
"by by manipulating the ion channels to"
have
two
"bioelectric patterns indicative of two"
"heads of course it's kind of a mess that"
"the technology is still being worked out"
"it's a little messy but what this does"
"is tell the cells to make an extra head"
"now here's the most important part to"
"hear that uh this bioelectrical map is"
"not a map of this two-headed creature"
"this is a map of this one-headed"
"creature before we cut it so a single"
"normal body the same uh the same anatomy"
"can hold one of two different"
"memories of what a correct planarian"
"should look like until you injure it it"
"is a latent memory it doesn't do"
"anything it just it just is kept but"
"once you injure"
"the tissue consults the map and builds"
"whatever the map says and so this is the"
"beginnings of a kind of counter factual"
"memory that we see in the brain with the"
"advanced animals being able to uh"
"envision uh either either remember or or"
"plan forward for things that are not"
"happening right now right so counter"
"factual memories of things that either"
"happen before or might happen in the"
future
"here's the here's the most primitive"
"version of this this electrical system"
"is able to store at least in the same"
"hardware it's able to store two"
"electrical memories of what a correct"
"planarian is and i'm sure lots more but"
"we've discovered too and the reason i"
"keep calling it a memory is because if"
you
"take these two-headed animals and you"
"amputate them they will continue to make"
"two-headed worms with no further"
"manipulations forever so that that"
"electrical circuit is a is a permanent"
"uh storage of how many heads the thing"
"is supposed to have and we can change it"
"back and forth we can flip it back and"
"forth we can take these two headed"
"animals and put them back to one hit and"
"you can see here this is um"
"this is what they uh what they're doing"
"in their spare time these two headed"
"worms so this is this has all the"
"properties of memory it has long-term"
"stability it is labile meaning"
"rewritable it has conditional recall"
"and it has discrete possible outcomes"
"okay now here what we've shown you is"
"that with the exact same hardware with"
"no so so this is a great example of"
"reprogrammability this is one of these"
"things that"
"uh one of these concepts that we get"
"from from computer science which is very"
"important because even though the genome"
"has not changed no genomic editing no"
"genes are changed the exact same"
"hardware is able to work towards"
"different types of outcomes one-headed"
"animal or two-headed animal and stop"
"when that outcome has been achieved okay"
"so the goals are rewritable"
and
"here we've shown you how to rewrite the"
"goal state of this agent to now work"
"towards a two-headed form instead of a"
"one-headed form we can go further than"
"this and in fact we can ask it to form"
"heads belonging to other species so this"
"triangular headed worm again no genomic"
"editing of any kind we amputate the head"
"we prevent the cells from electrically"
"communicating with each other for 48"
"hours and when the network reforms they"
"sometimes land in the wrong attractor"
"and so sometimes you get the correct"
"triangular head but sometimes you get"
"round heads like this s mediterranean or"
"you get flatheads like this p felina so"
"the exact same genetically specified"
"hardware can in fact land in uh regions"
"of morphospace that are that belong to"
"other species and there are lots of"
"evolutionary implications of this okay"
"and these are not just head shapes but"
"they have shapes of the brain and shapes"
"of the um"
"distribution of the stem cells that uh"
"that are just like these other species"
"in fact you can go even further than"
"that and you can access regions of the"
"morphospace that evolution is not using"
"because they're not ecologically viable"
"or competitive you can make planaria"
"into these spiky forms like this you can"
"make three-dimensional cylinders you can"
"have combinational forms that are"
"flatworms with with a tube growing out"
"into the third dimension so you can"
"actually reach areas of amorphous space"
"by pushing that electrical circuit into"
"stable attractors that normally uh it's"
"not it's not using and of course this"
"has all kinds of biomedical implications"
"that we're currently working on"
"at this point i have to do a disclosure"
"um david kaplan and i are co-founders of"
"a company called morphaceuticalsync"
"which is now trying this induction"
"technology in uh in mammals hopefully to"
"eventually solve human limb regen and"
"organ regeneration you can see these"
"these induced legs are both touch"
"sensitive and motile and we do it by"
"applying to these cells uh a set of"
"drugs that open and close specific ion"
"channels to"
"to stimulate and to trigger the"
"electrical system to make the decision"
"to regrow a leg instead of a scar"
and
we
"we treat the animal for 24 hours and"
"then you get up to uh 13 or more months"
"of leg growth during which time we don't"
"touch it at all so in other words it's a"
"it's the idea is to change the earlier"
"the early decision making of the circuit"
"and let it control the downstream"
"genetics appropriately"
"so to summarize this this first part of"
"the talk what i've shown you is that"
"anatomical homeostasis the ability to"
"create and repair complex anatomies"
"despite perturbations from different"
"starting positions"
"is a kind of collective intelligence"
"functioning in morphospace and bodies"
are
"incredibly plastic they can harness all"
"kinds of lower level mechanisms towards"
"specific large scale outcomes and like"
"in the brain this is mediated by"
"electrical and neurotransmitter networks"
"that store pattern memories these"
"pattern memories can be rewritten in"
"software by stimuli and experiences uh"
"not rewiring meaning no not editing the"
"pathways or the genomic hardware and so"
"by taking advantage of these tools and"
"concepts from from cognitive"
"neuroscience we can now reach"
"regenerative medicine and developmental"
"kinds of outcomes that were not possible"
"before okay and so"
"the in at this point what i want to talk"
"about are some synthetic model systems"
"and the reason that's important for this"
"whole thing is that we have a"
"fundamental knowledge gap which is this"
"question of where do the goals of"
"complex uh"
"complex uh collective systems come from"
"remember again that that all"
"intelligences are collective"
"intelligences and that if if you as a"
"brainy centralized system have some sort"
"of goal we need to understand how those"
"goals emerge from the little tiny"
"homeostatic goals of your cells and"
"tissues and so on and this this is"
"important not only for biology but for"
"prediction of technology internet of"
"things robotic swarms uh"
"how do we predict and control the the"
"the goal of emergent"
"uh high-level systems and in biology how"
"this plays out is like this we have one"
"flat-headed planarian species with these"
"green cells that know how to build a"
"flathead and then they stop"
"and then"
"we have a round-headed species that has"
"red cells that know how to make a round"
"head and then they stop and we can just"
"do a thought experiment what happens if"
"i mix these cells in the same body and"
"then i amputate the head what will"
"happen and the thing to know about"
"biology is that despite all of the"
"progress in genetics and molecular"
"biology of stem cells and all of that"
"and then all the great papers on plenary"
"and science and nature we don't have a"
"single model of what would happen in"
"such an experiment okay none of the"
"molecular models make predictions on"
"this experiment because the the crux of"
"this experiment is the question of"
"what goal state are these individual"
"cells working towards and what happens"
"when they're mixed together okay what"
"how how do the resulting uh homeostatic"
"set points"
"relate to the"
"to the components that are that are in"
"the system and we really don't"
"understand this at all it's actually"
"true in normal uh animals as well uh"
"because we we don't know how to uh"
"predict anatomy from from genomes but uh"
"but it's easiest to see in these kind of"
"chimeras and so to to begin to try to"
"understand this process and to really uh"
"study plasticity in in the biological"
"context um"
"we did the following thing and so uh"
"this is largely the work of doug"
"blackiston in collaboration with our um"
"uh with our partners at the university"
"of vermont sam kriegman and um"
"josh bongard their roboticists and uh we"
"asked the following question if we take"
"cells and lim liberate them from their"
"normal boundary condition will they"
"reboot their multicellularity will they"
"build something else and and if so what"
"are they going to build and so uh doug"
"in my lab did the following experiment"
"he took an early frog embryo he isolated"
"a bunch of these cells up here which are"
"basically faded to become skin and then"
"he put them in a little in a separate"
"little environment overnight and asked"
"them what they're going to do in the"
"absence of all this other stuff that"
"normally instructs them so in the"
"absence of that of the rest of the"
"embryo all of these cells you can see"
"this is of course a time lapse you can"
"see that overnight they coalesce"
"together okay and um"
"this the the flashing is calcium"
"signaling you can see overnight that"
"eventually they start uh they start"
"communicating with each other and"
"what they do then after that is they"
"form a novel creature they form"
"something we call a zenobot"
"for xenopus levis that's the kind of"
"frog we're using and it's a kind of"
"biobot so you can see here they make"
"these round structures that swim along"
"the reason they can swim is because"
"they're covered with cilia these little"
"tiny hairs that row against against the"
"water so you can see one moving along"
"here is an example of two of two of them"
"they have very diverse moving regimes"
"this one is going in circles this one is"
"patrolling back and forth okay uh and"
"they have the ability to do both"
"straight motion and circular motion this"
"one this one here is going on a uh on a"
"much much longer journey uh these two"
"are are sitting quietly for a time being"
"so you can see diverse behaviors and"
"what i'm going to show you now is what"
"happens in a maze so this is a perfectly"
"still water maze there's no flow there"
"are no gradients completely still and so"
"you can see what what this zenobot is"
"doing it's able to traverse the path"
"it rounds the corners without bumping"
"into the wall so you can see here as it"
"goes forward it doesn't have to hit the"
"opposite wall to take this turn it takes"
"a turn and over here for some internal"
"dynamics reason that we don't understand"
"it decides to turn around and go back"
"where it came from okay so all sorts of"
"interesting behaviors"
"they are in fact regenerative so so if"
"you cut it in half here it uh you can"
"you can see here you you cut it in half"
"and look it look through that hinge the"
"amazing amount of force through that 180"
"degree hinge that has to be deployed to"
"sew this thing back up into its normal"
"xenobot shape and in fact um as i've"
"showed you they have all kinds of"
"interesting uh calcium spiking which"
"looks very much like what you would see"
"if you did calcium imaging of a living"
"brain you know it's a zebrafish brain or"
"something like that"
"and so remember there are no neurons"
"here all of the movement all of the"
"interactions the different motion types"
"uh the the ability to regenerate uh"
"these types of uh"
"electrical and calcium dynamics all of"
"this happens just in skin they have no"
"there's no neurons here okay and this is"
"a creature that doesn't look anything"
"like a tadpole or a frog embryo"
"it has all these novel capacities that"
"were developed by skin in the 48 hours"
"after we liberated them from from the"
"animal so"
"the amazing thing is that these xenobots"
"have a perfectly normal frog genome the"
"molecular hardware is exactly the same"
"we have not edited them we have not done"
"any synthetic biology on them if you"
"were to sequence them all you would ever"
"see is xenopus levis and if you're used"
"to using seeing something like this"
"associated with the frog genome this"
"would be your prediction of what you're"
"seeing and the interesting thing about"
"xenobots is that they have no"
"straightforward evolutionary origin in"
"other words for most normal creatures on"
earth
"in fact for all living creatures on"
"earth if you ask why they have the"
"properties that they have why do they"
"fly why do they see in a certain"
"wavelength why do they swim and so on"
"the answer is always the same because"
"for millions of years their ancestors"
"were selected for xyz"
"in here uh in this case"
"this is this isn't uh this isn't true so"
"so the individual cells have of course"
"an evolutionary history but they were"
"selected to sit quietly on the outside"
"of the tadpole and keep out the"
"pathogens they were not uh specifically"
"selected for doing any of the things"
"they're doing now and so uh we don't"
"know what their cognitive capacities are"
"yet we're trying to train them and see"
"their preferences and so on but what we"
"see is this remarkable plasticity where"
"cells from a standard genome can be"
"abstracted into a new environment and"
"within 48 hours they put together a"
"coherent organism with morphology with"
"behavior and so on"
"that is completely different from their"
"genomic default okay and so that"
"plasticity is uh is is is really really"
"remarkable and that's not something that"
"we could have predicted ahead of time"
"from anything we know about their about"
"their hardware and so we should uh we we"
"can use this now as as the beginnings of"
"a system to try to understand where"
"these goal states come from so"
um
"now to uh sort of uh come come back to"
"the to the big questions and and finish"
"up uh"
"there's a there's a spectrum from all"
"the way from natural intelligence to"
"artificial intelligence and in between"
"lie uh hybrid intelligences which are"
"already being made and which we are"
"increasingly going to encounter so at"
"every level of organization from the the"
"uh the materials to the cellular to the"
"organ and so on we can make changes now"
"we can put in organic components"
"inorganic components of smart materials"
"nanomaterials cells from different"
tissues
"all kinds of uh software controlled uh"
subsystems
"and we can mix them in any organization"
"at any level your whatever it is that"
"you're putting in can be anywhere on"
"this spectrum from uh from a very simple"
"machine to something that's quite quite"
"complex and it can be evolved or"
"designed so already we have humans with"
"intelligent appliances such as"
"neurotransmitter pumps and so on these"
"kind of cyborgs we have humans with"
"brain implants that allow them to"
"directly control devices such as"
"wheelchairs and prosthetics we have lots"
"of novel engineered animals um hybrids"
"where living brains are are"
"connected to robotic bodies and and to"
"drive them around"
"and so uh"
"what this what this now does is open up"
"an incredible uh option space of"
"different creatures so this uh you know"
"darwin had this this phrase endless"
"forms most beautiful because he was"
"impressed with the diversity and the"
"richness of of of a riverbank full of um"
"full of life and basically all of that"
"all of the life forms that exist in this"
"one uh planetary"
"evolutionary tree are all basically here"
"right and around us is this incredible"
"astronomical option space of"
"combinations every possible combination"
"of some sort of evolved material some"
"sort of designed uh engineered material"
"and some sort of um"
"software uh software agent all of these"
"can be mixed together into all of these"
"different uh these different things some"
"of which we're already seeing but in uh"
in
"increasingly in our lifetime and in the"
"next generation we're going to be living"
"amidst uh massive amounts of creatures"
"that we've never seen before that have"
"no place on the uh evolutionary tree"
"okay because because these novel biology"
"is incredibly interoperable these"
"chimeras are are largely viable and you"
"can make just uh just an incredible"
"set of combinations of all kinds of"
things
"okay so um"
"what the biology is telling us is a"
"couple of interesting things first of"
"all that uh these uh these kinds of"
"words that were that would be this"
"terminology that we've used for for many"
"decades uh evolve designed what's an"
"organism uh what is an animal what's a"
"machine what is a robot you know is a is"
"a zenobot a machine an animal or a robot"
"all of these all of these terms are now"
"not nearly as useful as they used to be"
"we need a significant reboot to the"
"terminology because they no longer pick"
"out any really crisp categories okay i"
"mean we need to figure out what it what"
"what if anything is actually essential"
"about these terms and and people who"
"talk a lot about and this is not a"
"popular uh not a popular claim in"
"biology but people who talk about i'm"
"living things not being machines"
"they generally have in mind a uh a"
"conception of machine which is just not"
"realistic anymore you know it's the last"
"centuries the machines so that that"
"boundary is is completely eroded"
"and um the other thing that biology is"
"telling us is that there is no sharp"
"line between so-called true cognition"
"and some sort of as-if mechanisms that"
"are faking it right and a lot of people"
"have this conception that"
"okay humans and maybe some great apes"
"and maybe some other mammals have real"
"cognition and then there's all this"
"other stuff which is only as if you know"
"it's just it's just physics people say"
"and there is no support in biology i"
"think this is important for uh workers"
"and ai and and machine learning to know"
"there is no support in biology to any"
"idea that"
"that there's any kind of a crisp line"
"that you can draw between creatures that"
"have some sort of true intelligence and"
"just physics if we take evolution"
"seriously it means that the journey from"
"physics to psychology is a true"
"continuum there are no uh there are no"
"kind of"
"binary divisions there but there are a"
"set of uh transitions of capacity which"
"weiner and rosenbluth outline here and"
"you can see all the different"
"ways to climb this to climb this ladder"
"and all of these unusual creatures that"
"are going to be made will be somewhere"
"along this type of this type of"
continuum
"and one way to uh and i don't have time"
"to go into it now but if anybody's"
"interested i've developed a framework"
"that is allows us to compare and uh"
"contrast these diverse intelligences on"
"the same scale and the way you do that"
"is by plotting this the spatio-temporal"
"scale of the goals that any given"
"intelligence can pursue and so in"
"biology every layer every uh every"
"scale of organization is rife with"
"multiple competing cooperating agents"
"that have"
"goals in their own local space and that"
"the competition and communication among"
"these agents within their own layer and"
"across are both both going up and going"
"down is what gives rise to this uh"
"incredible plasticity of life and that"
"is um that's that's what we've called a"
"multi-scale competency architecture and"
"it's based on a kind of uh"
"nested goal directedness"
"and so this is uh"
"this is this is what i think is is key"
"about natural intelligence that i think"
"we could we could really utilize"
"so um the summary of this last part was"
"simply that new bodies can be"
"constructed in a in a huge option space"
"of configurations of chimeraism with uh"
"within biology and with engineered"
"objects all of these new kinds of bodies"
"will have some kind of mind and we know"
"that because there's a smooth gradation"
"from a human with a neural implant that"
"lets them control a vacuum cleaner let's"
"say so you know 95 human 5 robotics all"
"the way down to a a vacuum cleaner with"
"a bunch of human cells cultured on it to"
"help it to navigate the room so that's 5"
"human 95 vacuum cleaner and every every"
"possible step in between can be created"
"can be bioengineered so now there is no"
"there's no there's no hard distinction"
"that you can make in these in these kind"
"of cases but bioengineering is is"
"completely smearing out all of these all"
"of these terms and so not only is"
"chimeric bioengineering uh showing us"
"how to observe minds and their"
"collective goals emerging from scratch"
"but it's also a really good model system"
"within which to understand the mapping"
"between the body and the mind"
"and how active intelligences act in"
"really diverse spaces so um so just to"
"close i'll remind you that morphogenesis"
"is an ancient proto-cognitive process"
"it's just one example of how biology can"
"teach us about intelligence and the"
"scaling of cognition and bioelectrical"
"networks underlie one type of"
"this scaling up of cognition and they"
"will really help us to understand"
"neuroscience and how this happens in the"
brain
"and synthetic morphology is a really"
"powerful tool not just for regenerative"
"medicine and robotics but also for"
"answering some really really big"
"questions about how larger intelligences"
"emerge from smaller intelligences and in"
"fact uh the the new era of uh synthetic"
"morphology and chimerism is going to"
"require i think a whole new ethics for"
"relating to these novel agents that"
"aren't based on what they look like"
"meaning what they're made of or its"
"origin story how they got there because"
"these things will increasingly be uh"
"unreliable guides to the degree of"
"cognition that uh that is something has"
"so if you um are interested in more"
"details um"
"lots of lots of papers on our on our"
"website about all these different uh"
"different topics and i want to thank uh"
"the people who have done all this work"
"um here are the the students and"
"postdocs who did all of this and uh of"
"course our collaborators are our funders"
"and uh i thank you very much for"
listening
"the room too late so you couldn't hear"
"the clapping i think"
"wow okay good so there was an enormous"
"amount of material"
"and i think inspiring"
"stuff in there so i think it was this"
"one talks that it"
"has an impact on a lot of people's minds"
"so there are plenty of questions and"
"there is no time but i"
"i just thought we can try to move the"
"upcoming talks a little bit down one of"
"the speakers just told me that i can"
"only move their talk by maximum of 10"
"minutes okay so i think we will do that"
"so start the next box 10 minutes past"
"the hour"
"and have a little"
"space for a couple of questions so"
"i'm going to ask"
[Music]
"the time of the"
"audience to ask questions i i think uh i"
"would give the chance to always to ask"
"i'm sure there will be many questions"
"okay so i i don't know who was first i"
"can see uh marcin"
"mike thank you very much for your great"
"talk i would like to ask you"
uh
"if i understood well"
"regeneration is some kind of process"
"which is natural and common"
"at lower level organs we have"
"regeneration if i cut my finger"
"then of course i can regenerate the"
"skin but"
for
"preservation of organisms regeneration"
lost
"its raw it is not very common"
"if someone cuts my head there is no"
"chance i could survive"
uh
"in this case how we from evolutionary"
"point of view"
"why did we lose this uh paradise of"
regeneration
"yeah so so so first of all let's just"
"notice that uh there are large adult"
"mammals that regenerate very well and"
"one example is the deer so the deer"
"every year regenerates uh you know a"
"meter of new bone and vasculature and"
"innervation up to a centimeter and a"
"half of new bone per day okay so so it's"
"not that mammals can't do it but there's"
"something important about this the the"
"antlers are a non-load-bearing structure"
"you don't put your weight on it and so"
"if you think about why evolution did"
"this think about uh our ancestor which"
"would have been something resembling a"
"mouse back in you know a long time ago"
"it's running around the forest somebody"
"bites its leg off"
"and now the problem of course is several"
"first of all you you're going to bleed"
"out you're going to get infected you're"
"going to be walking on it you're going"
"to be grinding it into the floor right"
"as the nude cells are trying to develop"
"and so i think what evolution did was to"
"say you're much better off scaring it"
"and hoping you survive you're not like a"
"salamander which can stay quietly in the"
"water for long periods of time so i"
"think it's an engineering choice made uh"
"but forced by our lifestyle it is not"
"anything fundamental and in fact our and"
"our biomedical uh you know"
"spin-off companies is as many others is"
"founded on this idea that we can"
"reactivate it if we can convince the"
"cells that uh they should go back to"
"their uh morphogenetic programs and not"
"worry about um having to scar so we"
"don't bleed out"
"okay thank you very much"
"yeah are you"
right
"yeah thank you for your fascinating talk"
"thank you so i was wondering for um for"
"quite a while to listening to your talk"
"it came up until the very end"
"i was wondering well if you're looking"
"at what you presented to us as uh um as"
"the scientific model of human of of"
"organisms all sorts of organisms um i"
"was wondering what would"
"those artificial intelligence guys and"
"philosophers do with that because it"
"would to me it would look like it's not"
"an observation"
"um to me would look like"
"all the stuff that embodied in an active"
"cognition guys and cyberneticists and"
morphogenesis
"and people into that would be looking"
for
"rather than more like traditionally"
minded
"ai researchers or philosophers"
"but then when it came to describing the"
"engineering paradigm that you are um"
"developing from from your investigations"
"here uh um as um i began to perceive"
"that there's that well that's hey i"
"might serve as some part of the"
"engineering paradigm that that um"
"you seem to be seeking to initiate"
"so this is not really a question but an"
"observation and i'm just trying to frame"
"this within the context of this conflict"
"yeah yeah definitely um so so in our"
"group we try to bounce back and forth so"
"we use both techniques and inspiration"
"from from machine learning from"
"connectionist types of ideas to help us"
"understand how cellular collectives are"
"solving these problems and at the same"
"time to take what we've learned from"
"them and uh transition them into new"
"strategies for new machine learning"
"architectures and i've i've argued for"
"for years now that one of the"
"reasons we're having trouble with with"
"the general intelligence artificial"
"intelligence is that we've immediately"
"focused on the brain which is a rather a"
"derived type type of thing where what"
"we're missing is the basic underlying"
"architecture that evolution has been"
"using all along and there's another"
"version of this talk i give sometimes"
"called why don't robots get cancer right"
"and the reasons robots don't get cancer"
"is because all of our architectures are"
"extremely flat the subcomponents"
"generally don't have the uh goal seeking"
"capacity to go off on their own and do"
"something else and so the good news is"
"that we don't the the positive of that"
"is that we don't have these um kind of"
"complex defections that you would that"
"you have to deal with in biology but the"
"downside is that we're missing precisely"
"this uh"
"flexibility and and this um"
"incredible robustness that you get by"
"having a true multi-scale architecture"
"where the outcome is a combination of"
"cooperation and competition across"
"levels where every level has goals not"
"just the larger you know not just the"
"larger scale"
"thank you"
"wow that was uh"
"absolutely fascinating and thank you"
"there's so much talk about it but i know"
"we don't have a lot of time thank you so"
"much for opening my eyes to to uh to"
"your research there now i do want to"
"challenge this idea of um"
"sort of smooth gradient of cognition"
"right this nobody cognition thing and uh"
"in this in a simple way i just want to"
"say i want to ask um"
"there seems like a difference between"
"animals which enjoy what would be in an"
"adolescent period whereas a radical"
"reconfiguration of the of the brain and"
"other other organs that seem to orient"
"that organism to goals which aren't"
"given by the enculturated environment"
"immediately right in the early childhood"
"like this so then the individual takes"
"up some goal or purpose in its own"
"individual life and that context however"
"it's raised"
"by way of this radical transformation in"
"the adolescent period so"
"is there is there a difference in kind"
between
"organisms which enjoy this sort of you"
"know embodied radical transformation"
"during adolescence and others that don't"
"yeah um well i want to say two things"
"about that uh i"
"for certainly i'm not saying that there"
"are no um great transitions on this"
"continuum there are there are clearly"
"you know language being the most obvious"
"one right there i mean there are clearly"
"transitions however uh the reality is"
"that any two animals that or any two"
"architectures that you bring me one of"
"which uh issue you know is is an"
"advanced one that that has some property"
"and one that doesn't we can make a"
"chimera out of them and we can right and"
"you can you can we can make one as"
"finely as you want right so so so it's"
"going to be smooth but of course there"
"are going to be you know these kinds of"
"these kind of gradations now"
"specifically to the goals in the"
"adolescence portion"
"uh one thing we see"
"again and again is that biological"
"systems are amazing at picking up novel"
"goals and we have no idea where these"
"goals come from so even in the case of"
"the zenobots for example uh they within"
"48 hours uh become become this very"
"coherent system with behavioral goals"
"with morphological goals i have no idea"
"where where that comes from and a lot of"
time
"what people lean on is evolution they"
"say oh look you know these artificial"
"constructs they're not they're not"
"really thinking they don't have a"
"history of develop you know of evolution"
"behind them i i don't think that's what"
"biology really but i'm not sure that"
"that's an you know um even even even uh"
"embryogenesis is a series of adolescent"
"steps where you where you have right"
"each step dramatically you know"
"transforms into another step so"
"i think uh yeah i think i think this is"
"a continuum with lots of fascinating you"
"know sort of humps on it"
"thank you"
"i'll throw in a very quick short"
"question so you you talked a lot about"
"sort of lower level as the word cells"
"and the past genetic stuff that happens"
"there i wonder whether you have any"
"views on if you go up from there so to"
"full organisms beyond full organisms so"
"so what do you think is the situation"
"there you seem to suggest that the"
"intelligence of a normal organism is"
"actually already a cooperative yeah"
[Music]
"but isn't that true on"
"higher levels too absolutely absolutely"
"and you can keep going and you can ask"
"very interesting questions about how uh"
"the the uh"
"the dynamics that merge cells and so on"
"into higher levels how that plays out in"
"swarms and colonies and societies and so"
"on one of the current projects in our"
"lab is to train ant colonies not the"
"ants but the colony right so there are"
"interesting ways that you can think"
"about interacting with a with a colony"
"mind that is distinct from how you would"
"interact with individual ants and uh it"
"becomes it becomes very important to ask"
"questions like how much and what kind of"
"cognitive capacity might a collective"
"intelligence be of a"
"of of an electrical grid of a political"
"system of a group of animals or or"
"humans or plants"
"all of this is up for grabs what's clear"
"is that the biology is telling us that"
"you cannot assume these things and that"
"it's an empirical question where on the"
"continuum any given system lands and you"
"have to do experiments to find out"
"i think that's a very important message"
"for the philosophers where the continued"
"system lands because we have a huge"
"preference for one particular spot"
traditionally
"we use that this is really fascinating"
"stuff i'm sorry i have to cut the"
"discussion because we do have other"
"people who have slots to speak so uh i"
"will stop here"
"and we'll stick to the section so thank"
"you michael that was excellent stuff"
"thank you so much you will get a lot of"
"philosophers on your tails for"
"discussions in due course thank you"
"excellent thank you"
"thank you"
"let's do two sections right so we have"
uh
"a continues here"
