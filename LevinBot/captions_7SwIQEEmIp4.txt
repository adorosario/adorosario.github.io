"okay hopefully everyone can see that um"
"thank you so much for the opportunity to"
"uh visit with you all virtually and"
"share some share some thoughts with you"
"um if anybody wants to get in touch with"
"me or download the software the primary"
"data any of those things everything is"
"here at this at this website so um today"
"what I want to talk about is this notion"
"of agential materials and how we are"
"going to engineer with such materials"
um
"these are the main points that I would"
"like to transmit to you today first that"
"most problems in biomedicine and also in"
"synthetic bioengineering boil down to"
"the control of morphogenesis and I'm"
"going to frame this problem as the"
"behavior of a collective intelligence of"
"a cellular swarm in a particular problem"
"space we call anatomical morphe space"
"I'm going to emphasize that biology uses"
"a kind of"
"multi-scale competency architecture"
"which consists of a hierarchical problem"
"solvers in various problem spaces and we"
"and evolution and various parasites and"
"and so on can exploit this kind of"
"architecture and the interface that"
"cells and tissues use to shape each"
"other's behavior I'm going to in"
"particular tell you that bioelectrical"
"networks are a large part of the uh the"
"medium through which this Collective"
"agent processes information and they're"
"basically the ancestor of the the"
"nervous system and brain function and"
"I'm going to tell you that tools now"
"exist that we have created to read and"
"write memories into this software layer"
"that sits between the genome on the one"
"hand and the anatomy and function on the"
"other hand and there are many many"
"applications here in birth defects"
"regeneration cancer and synthetic"
"bioengineering so I want to start I want"
"to start with this with this idea uh"
"most of the problems of biomedicine so"
"we're talking about birth defects"
"traumatic injury cancer aging"
"degenerative disease they all have one"
"fundamental thing in common which is"
"that if we understood how to convince a"
"collection of cells to build a"
"particular structure these problems"
"would be solved right so so I see the"
"end game of our field as something I"
"call the anatomical compiler right so"
"let's let's have a vision of what what"
"success for us would look like success"
"means that uh if we knew what we were"
"doing we could have a a system where you"
"sit down at a computer and you draw the"
"animal or plant that you want to have at"
"the level of anatomy and then what the"
"system would do is compile that"
"description down into a set of stimuli"
"that would have to be given to some kind"
"of source of cellular material to get it"
"to build exactly what you want so in"
"this case you might draw this"
"three-headed planarian and there and"
"there it would it would create that uh"
"so uh this this of course uh is is the"
"the Crux of our problem is how do we"
"control the emergence and scaling of"
"cellular activities towards your desired"
"complex three-dimensional outcome now of"
"course we don't have anything remotely"
"like this we have a very few examples"
"where we can actually control shape in"
"this way and a part of that is because"
"we are still largely thinking about"
"Engineering in this way now of course"
"we're we're moving but but we're moving"
"from this position where"
"um for for many many uh in fact"
"thousands of years we've engineered with"
"passive materials what's what's"
"important about this this kind of"
"spectrum is that uh the question of what"
"can you expect the material to do when"
"you are not around to micromanage it so"
"this traditional material uh the pretty"
"much the only thing it does is it"
"maintains its shape right that's the"
"autonomous feature that it has once"
"you've created it you put it in place"
"and it maintains now of course more"
"recently there's been a lot of exciting"
"work on active matter and computational"
materials
"and today we're going to talk about what"
"I call a gentle materials which is what"
"happens when you come to living living"
"cells and that's why this anatomical"
"compiler idea is not a 3D printer the"
"idea isn't to micromanage and place"
"every cell where you want it to go but"
"actually it's a Communications device"
"it's a way to transmit your desired"
"Target morphology to the computational"
"agent that is this Collective of sales"
"now that's a very weird way of thinking"
"about this problem so let me try to"
"explain how we got there"
"uh this this here is a single cell and"
"so this is a lacrum area"
"um and what you can see is that if"
"you're into Soft Robotics or active"
"matter you can see the incredible"
"control that this little guy has over"
"his body shape it manages to solve all"
"of its local goals so so metabolic needs"
"physiological needs and so on at the"
"level of a single cell with there's no"
"brain there's no nervous system"
"everything is done within this one cell"
"and so each of us has taken this"
"incredible journey from being some kind"
"of a an unfertilized oocyte so a little"
"collection of quiescent chemicals to"
"being something like this or perhaps"
"even something like this a a"
"metacognitive you know a metacognitive"
"human that's going to make statements"
"about how distinct humans are from from"
"Mere matter that that was here and of"
"course what developmental biology shows"
"us is that this process is extremely uh"
"continuous it's slow and gradual there's"
"no magical"
"um uh there's no magical a bright line"
"that you can draw at which you stop"
"being a physical physical dynamical"
"system when you start being a cognitive"
"system this is a slow process so that"
"means that certain capacities that we"
"recognize up here which are very common"
"we need to ask where did they come from"
"and what other unconventional systems"
"might have those properties and this is"
"the the feel of basal cognition seeks"
"don't understand that so cells do many"
"interesting things"
"this is this is a cell so cells have"
"these interesting morphological"
"capabilities this is also a cell this"
"thing can be up to 10 centimeters tall"
"this is an acetabularia it has a stock"
"it has some some Roots down here it has"
"a cap the whole thing is one cell it has"
"one nucleus the whole thing is one cell"
"so as you think about morphogenesis and"
"and this this idea of differentiation"
"and different cell types you can"
"actually do all of this quite large in"
"one cell this here also is one cell this"
"is a fisarin polycephalum slime mold the"
"whole thing is one cell and so this is"
"this is the work of niroshima murugan in"
"my group and what she's done is to place"
"one glass disc here three glass discs"
"here they're just glass they're"
"completely inner there's no um uh"
"chemicals there's no food gradient"
"nothing like that and what you'll see is"
"that for the first few hours it sort of"
"grows in all directions like this and"
"you think it might just keep growing but"
"what it's actually doing during this"
"time is using biomechanics to pull out"
"to to pull on the medium that it sits on"
"and receive back the the mechanical"
"signals that allow it to measure strain"
"angle and even though these glass discs"
"are extremely tiny and and light what it"
"will do is reliably realize that there's"
"more of them here than there is here and"
"this is a quite a reliable process and"
"so uh all of all of this time is spent"
"acquiring information from the outside"
"world making a decision"
"and at this point boom right here is"
"where you see that it's already decided"
"what it's going to do and you can play"
"all kinds of interesting games about"
"stacking these on top of each other and"
"tilting it and do various things so uh"
"even even very primitive single cell"
"organisms have these amazing"
"morphological and behavioral capacities"
"and in fact here your your behavior is"
"the change of morphology this animal the"
"sort of this this creature sort of"
"straddles those two problem spaces so so"
"here's what we're looking at in biology"
"we're looking at a multi-scale"
"competency architecture where every"
"layer is not just the nested doll of uh"
"structurally but it's actually a set of"
"nested problem solvers that are able to"
"have various capabilities so not passive"
"materials but various capabilities"
"including down to the level of protein"
"networks that solves problems in"
"anatomical space transcriptional space"
"physiological space and so on and this"
"enables some amazing capabilities I just"
"want to run through with you some of the"
"things that life is capable of that we"
"don't hear a lot about in our standard"
textbooks
"so this is a flatworm a planarian and"
"the amazing thing about planaria and"
"they have a true brain and and all the"
"neurotransmitters that you and I have"
"and so on and what you can do with these"
"plenaries you can cut them into pieces"
"and every piece will give rise to an"
"entire perfect worm so they regenerate"
"uh what McConnell learned in the 60s was"
"that if you train this animal to"
"recognize some some kind of specific"
"stimulus you cut off the head the tail"
"sits there doing nothing for about eight"
"to ten days eventually it grows a brand"
"new brain and then you find out that"
"this animal actually remembers the"
"original training"
"so what you have here is the ability to"
"store behavioral memories somewhere"
"outside the brain"
"and then to imprint that information"
"onto the new brain as it develops so the"
"movement of this uh of of information"
"throughout the body and a tight"
"integration of morphological information"
"in other words how do we create this"
"this new head with uh behavioral"
"information what what uh what was the"
"content of of the mind that that this"
"primitive animal had"
"um and this is this kind of plasticity"
"this amazing plasticity both of of"
"behavior and of morphology is not just"
"for invertebrates here's something that"
"uh Doug Blackiston in my group did years"
"ago he created this tadpole which has no"
"primary eye so this is the tadpole of"
"the Frog xenopus layers here's the mouth"
"uh the nostrils the brain the gut and so"
"you'll see there's no eyes but what he"
"did do was to put some eye cells on the"
"tail now these eye cells first of all"
"had no trouble becoming an eye even"
"though they were sitting next to muscle"
"instead of where they belong next to the"
"brain but then what we found out having"
"built a machine to test uh to to"
"automate the training and testing of"
"these animals they can see quite well"
"and uh this this eye confers vision it"
"doesn't connect to the brain actually in"
"some cases it connects up here to the"
"spinal cord and you can sort of trace"
"the the optic nerve it connects to the"
"spinal cord and just think this this uh"
"this animal which which had a very"
"particular sensory motor architecture"
"for um"
"evolutionary time periods uh all of a"
"sudden in one generation has a totally"
"different architecture so now now"
"there's this weird itchy patch of tissue"
"on its back that gives some kind of"
"electrical signals and this brain has no"
"trouble recognizing that this is visual"
"data and to behave accordingly so that"
"ability to adjust to novel scenarios on"
"the fly without needing eons of of"
"evolutionary selection for it has"
"massive implications it has massive"
"implications for evolution itself for"
"biomedicine and for our ability to use"
"cells and tissues in engineering because"
"they are not passive elements they are"
"actually problem problem solving a"
"little little problem-solving engines so"
"the thing is that that now that probably"
"sounds very strange to to many people in"
"the audience uh because we as many"
"animals are are very good at recognizing"
"intelligent behavior in the"
"three-dimensional world so uh our sense"
"organs are our cognitive apparatus is"
"really tuned to pick up a gentle"
"behavior from middle-sized objects"
"moving at medium speeds in"
"three-dimensional space so when when"
"birds and and you know mammals do clever"
"things it's very easy for us to know"
"that uh but there are other spaces"
"including transcriptional spaces"
"morphological spaces and physiological"
"spaces that uh where biological systems"
"execute very similar kinds of"
"intelligent behaviors and if we had"
"imagined for example if you had an"
"innate uh sense of your blood chemistry"
"the way that we do with vision and smell"
"and so on if you could if you could feel"
"the different components of your blood"
"chemistry you would have no trouble"
"recognizing your liver and your kidneys"
"and so on as intelligent agents that"
"were navigating that space with all"
"kinds of interesting competencies I'll"
"give you a simple example uh here are"
"again these planaria what we did and"
"this is uh this is the work of um Maya"
"Edmonds Bell and Angela Tung in our lab"
"and uh what what they did was to take uh"
"planaria and uh put them in a solution"
"of barium uh barium is a non-specific"
"potassium channel blocker what it does"
"is it makes it impossible for the uh"
"cells in the head to exchange potassium"
"that makes these cells extremely unhappy"
"of course especially the neurons and"
"their heads explode literally just"
"overnight boom their heads their heads"
"are gone"
"but the amazing thing is that if you"
"leave these planaria in barium in fact"
"refreshing the barium as needed they"
"will soon build a brand new head and the"
"new head is completely barium"
"insensitive now that seemed very strange"
"to us how could that be and so what we"
"did was we did a very simple experiment"
"which was to compare the gene expression"
"of barium adapted heads with normal"
"heads and we found that there's only a"
"small number of genes that are different"
"okay so so out of the whole genome you"
"know some tens of thousands of genes it"
"found exactly the right"
"um transcripts to up and down regulate"
"in order to make up for this really"
"drastic environmental stressor now"
"here's the here's the the most amazing"
"part which is that of course planaria"
"never encounter barium in the wild"
"there's no evolutionary pressure to be"
"good to to know what to do when you"
"encounter barium that just has never"
happened
"so what we're looking at here is an"
"amazing ability to navigate the very"
"large dimensional space of gene"
"expression to find exactly the ones you"
"need to solve your problem I I often"
"Envision this as sort of being being"
"stuck in this nuclear reactor control"
"room with the things melting down you"
"have you have you know 20 000 different"
"buttons how do you know what to do if"
"you've never seen the stressor before"
"and the key of course is that you don't"
"have time to Simply start turning genes"
"on and off to see what happens and"
"there's no there's no time for that and"
"of course most of that would make things"
"worse not better so so so they have this"
"this this really incredible ability"
"which we still really don't understand"
"although I have a hypothesis about"
"what's going on here uh that allows them"
"to navigate uh competently this kind of"
"space it's a problem this is a problem"
"solving example they they are able to uh"
"to to to to adapt to a new stressor that"
"they've never seen before now now this"
"is transcriptional and there are many"
"such examples that I could give you but"
"I want to in particular next uh focus on"
"morphogenetic Space problem solving in"
"anatomical morphe space"
"so we start life like this this is a"
"collection of embryonic blastomeres and"
"then eventually we get to something like"
"this this is a cross section through a"
"human torso look at the amazing order"
"look at all the the the organs the"
"structures everything is in the right"
"place the right shape and size relative"
"to each other so you might ask where is"
"this pattern encoded yeah it's got to be"
"it's got to be somewhere and of course"
"one is attempted immediately to say DNA"
"but we can read genomes now we know"
"what's in the DNA what's in the DNA is"
"the descriptions of the micro level"
"Hardware that every cell gets to have"
"the proteins the genome doesn't say"
"anything directly about what the layout"
"here is what kind of symmetry it has"
"whether it's regenerative how many"
"fingers does it have fingers the DNA"
"doesn't say anything like that any more"
"than the DNA directly specifies the"
"shape of a termite Colony nests or"
"spider webs these are all the results of"
"a physiological software layer that sits"
"between the genome and the anatomy and"
"so what we would like to understand is a"
"few things how do these cell groups know"
"what to make and when to stop how if"
"something is missing how do we repair it"
"and as engineers and this will be the"
"last part of the talk"
"um how far can we push this so what else"
"can you build given a default genome"
"does it have to be this or can you build"
"something else now now you might think"
"that well this problem really should"
"have been solved a long time ago we have"
"all kinds of genetic information"
"molecular biology and so on genomics"
"well here's a here's a very simple"
"example these are baby axolotls and baby"
"Axolotl stuff little tiny four legs this"
"is uh tadpoles of the frogs Oedipus"
"lavis they do not have legs at this"
"stage in our lab we make something known"
"as a frogalodel which is part frog part"
"Axolotl okay so now I ask a simple"
"question if I were to make this frog"
"lottle is it going to have legs after"
"all you have the Axolotl genome you have"
"the Frog genome can you tell me if a"
"frog a lot was going to have legs or not"
"and if it is going to have legs can you"
"tell me whether those legs will be made"
"only of Axolotl cells or whether the"
"Frog cells will somehow participate in"
"this process and by the way what will"
"the shape of those legs be will they be"
"like Axolotl legs or like frog legs or"
"what and of course we have no ability to"
"derive any of these things from from"
"genomic information so here's here's"
"where we stand today"
"biologies are very good at manipulating"
"cells and molecules and of course"
"information about those cells and"
"molecules and Pathways so so we have a"
"really good handle on stuff like this we"
"are a very long way away from uh control"
"of large-scale Form and Function if we"
"wanted to change you know if you wanted"
"to uh convert an axolotl to three-fold"
"symmetry instead of bilateral symmetry"
"what genes would you change you know we"
"we have absolutely no idea how to do"
"things like that and so I think that"
"both biomedicine and Engineering are"
"where computer science was in the 40s"
"and 50s what she's doing here in order"
"to program this computer is she's"
"physically rewiring it right she's"
"having to interact with the with with"
"the bare metal with the hardware and all"
"of the most exciting uh kinds of um uh"
"advances in molecular medicine is this"
"it's it's genome editing protein"
"engineering pathway rewiring it's mostly"
"focused at the hardware and I think that"
"we need to complement that with the"
"approaches that computer science took"
"which is to Now understand go go up and"
"understand and take advantage of the"
"software of the system and I'm going to"
"argue that biology is reprogrammable in"
"exactly the same way that uh Universal"
"kinds of computing devices are"
"reprogrammable and in particular uh what"
"we're missing and what we are trying to"
"uh to to work on is being able to"
"exploit higher level information"
"processing what we call agency memory"
"decision making problem solving goal"
"directed activity now I'm going to use"
"some terms uh so from time to time this"
"is things like like intelligence and"
"problem solving and what I mean is not"
"some sort of mystical"
"Magic Magical feature that only humans"
"have so so uh what I mean is a a a"
"definition like one used by William"
"James who said that intelligence is"
"simply the degree of ability to reach"
"the same goal by different means there's"
"also a quantitative cybernetic uh"
"version of this which is due to a a"
"wiener and and colleagues which"
"basically looks like this this is a"
"spectrum of competencies all the way"
"from passive matter all the way up"
"through to let's say human level"
"metacognition and things like that and"
"so the the point is to uh to to to to"
"benefit from ideas in Behavioral Science"
"and cybernetics and computer science to"
"understand how we deal with uh and how"
"we engineer with systems that are not"
"necessarily down here but might be"
"actually uh at higher levels on this"
"hierarchy and by the way we for many of"
"them we don't know where they are on the"
"hierarchy which means we need to find"
out
"so let's look at let's look at"
"anatomical uh kinds of behavior or"
"morphogenesis the first thing we know is"
"that development is very reliable so we"
"in the vast majority of cases an egg"
"will give rise to this particular Target"
"morphology so so far so good very"
"reliable but then we know that actually"
"it's it's reliable but it isn't"
"hardwired because if you come along and"
"you cut this animal in half right or"
"this embryo could take it apart into"
"quarters for example you will not get"
"two half embryos which you get are two"
"normal monozygotic twins which means"
"that we have something like this the"
"ability if this was morph a space if"
"this was you know boiled down to two"
"Dimensions the shape of all possible"
"anatomies you would be able to get to"
"the right Ensemble of Target States from"
"different starting positions and you"
"would avoid local Minima and various"
"other traps and you would get there and"
"we will talk more about this"
"so we're starting to understand that we"
"can get to the same outcome this is"
"again William James's definition we get"
"to the same outcome despite"
"perturbations from diverse starting"
"positions here is another example of"
"that in an adult organism so this is an"
"axolotl these guys regenerate their"
"limbs their eyes their jaws their spinal"
"cords their ovaries and so on and what"
"happens is that if you were to amputate"
"anywhere along this limb the cells will"
"very rapidly start to build they will"
"build exactly what's necessary no more"
"no less and then they stop"
"that's the most uh amazing part of this"
"whole process is that they stop when do"
"they stop well they stop when a correct"
"salamander arm has been completed so"
"that now starts to suggest the process"
"of anatomical homeostasis meaning that"
"this this walk in the space of possible"
"morphologies that it does uh the system"
"the system not only ends up where it"
"needs to go but then it actually can can"
"stop and and and and uh and and"
"stabilize where where it needs to go by"
"the way regeneration isn't just for uh"
"worms and amphibians"
"um humans have a highly regenerative"
"liver even the ancient Greeks seem to"
"have known that I have no idea how they"
"knew that uh the deer every year"
"regenerate uh huge amounts of bone and"
"vasculature and innervation so these"
"these um uh antlers grow at a rate of a"
"centimeter and a half per day of new"
"bone so remarkable regeneration of an"
"adult mammal and uh human children are"
"known to regenerate their fingertips up"
"until a certain age so if they have a"
"clean amputation and you don't close it"
"up you'll get a cosmetically a very nice"
"finger regenerate after that so um uh"
"the the other the other interesting"
"issue about this is that yes the systems"
"get to the same point in morphe space uh"
"even from different starting positions"
"but they don't all get there the same"
"way so this is uh this is work done by"
"Kelly Chang a postdoc in my group many"
"years ago"
"um showing uh uh uh how frog legs"
"regenerate and what you see here we even"
"do so so frog legs at this stage"
"normally don't regenerate we've induced"
"them to do so but using a method I'll"
"describe in a few minutes and what you"
"see is that while um while uh the uh the"
"the developmental path is to create a"
"flat paddle and then sort of kill off"
"some cells in between the fingers by"
"apoptosis that isn't how the regenerate"
"forms the regenerate and you can see"
"here with these little green arrowheads"
"you've got some uh this this middle"
"stock that creates uh the central axis"
"with a with a toenail at the end you've"
"got some"
"um some some Toes that come off the"
"sides it looks a lot more like the way a"
"plant grows than the way the limb"
"developed in the first place so"
"different path through the space but"
"reaching the same final shape and then"
"this is perhaps my my most uh sort of"
"favorite example ever of this of this"
"creative problem solving process"
"which is this this this is a"
"cross-section through a newt uh kidney"
"tubule so normally what you'll see is"
"that there's oh eight to ten cells that"
"cooperate together to build this this"
"kind of structure now one thing you can"
"do is you can make polyploid newts that"
"have multiple times the amount of"
"genetic material of a normal cell so the"
"first amazing thing is that if you do"
"that these nudes up to I think 6n or 8N"
"are still perfectly normal animals"
"having having multiple copies of your"
"genome doesn't apparently hurt anything"
"here so that that's kind of amazing"
"second amazing thing is that the cells"
"enlarge in proportion to the amount of"
"DNA they have so they could become"
"bigger the third thing is that when that"
"happens the the cells uh scale their"
"number to the right to the task meaning"
"that the bigger cells there's now fewer"
"of them that will come together to build"
"the same size structure and the most"
"amazing thing of all is that when you"
"make the cell so gigantic and I may"
"think I think these are the 6n newts"
"when you make the cell so gigantic that"
"they simply cannot fit with others to do"
"this what will happen is that one cell"
"will bend around itself and form the"
"exact same anatomical structure now"
"what's crazy about this is that this is"
"a different molecular mechanism this is"
"cell to cell communication and some sort"
"of tubulogenesis this is cytoskeletal"
"bending so what you have here is a is an"
"example of top-down causation in the"
"service of maintaining a specific"
"anatomical structure meaning in in order"
"to stay in that region of anatomical"
"amorphous space or to reach it rather"
"you can call up different low level"
"mechanisms this of course is something"
"we see in Neuroscience all the time when"
"an animal has a certain goal in"
"behavioral space it will often execute"
"different behave different specific"
"behaviors different low level modules"
"will be activated to get to get to the"
"to the final State and and development"
"is no different in in the morphogenesis"
"process so um the final kind of example"
"of this before we go on and look at the"
"mechanism is is this this is something"
"we discovered a few years ago that a"
"normal tadpole becomes a normal frog by"
"rearranging its face so the eyes have to"
"move the Jaws have to move the nostrils"
"and so on and so this used to be thought"
"of as a hardwired process every organ"
"just moves in the right direction the"
"right amount and there you have your"
"frog so we decided to test that and we"
"what we created was the so-called"
"Picasso tadpoles everything is in the"
"wrong position so the eye might be off"
"to the side the mouth might be on top of"
"the head Everything is Everything is"
"scrambled and what we find out is these"
"animals give rise to basically normal"
"frogs because each of these components"
"doesn't just move in the same position"
"that's default for development it"
"actually will move in new ways and if it"
"goes too far it'll actually move"
"backwards in order to give you the right"
"frog face and then they stop so what the"
"genetics does is not specify even if it"
"could specify some sort of uh specific"
"motion what instead it does is gives you"
"a error minimization machine it gives"
"you a system that can flexibly take"
"action to minimize some kind of error"
"parameter and in this case the error"
"parameters morphological distance from"
"this from this target so the way we"
"think about these things"
"is like this that uh this this is the"
"mainstream story of of morphogenesis"
"that you have some uh Gene regulatory"
"networks some of them make proteins that"
"do things they they diffuse or they're"
"sticky or they exert force or something"
"and then you have this process of"
"emergence and this is the dominant idea"
"in this field the idea is that uh when"
"individual components act according to"
"local Simple Rules out will come complex"
"outcomes and so so the idea is that this"
"notion of emergence plus complexity"
"science will be able to be able to"
"explain these kinds of things and and"
"this is true there are there are many"
"simple systems in which following local"
"uh rules uh even though the rules are"
"simple give you something quite complex"
"at the end okay so this this is this is"
"all true but there's a big but there's a"
"big problem here this is there's a"
"there's a huge component missing the the"
"thing that's missing here is that"
"um this this is a feed forward open loop"
"kind of process which means that if you"
"want to make changes down here let's say"
"convert this guy to three-fold symmetry"
"or or make some other kind of um change"
"it's uh this process is not reversible"
"it is in general impossible to know"
"which genes you're going to tweak to do"
"that so this this greatly limits uh the"
"the opportunities for let's say crispr"
"genomic editing because Beyond uh some"
"low-hanging fruit We're not gonna have"
"any idea of what genes to tweak right to"
"get to get a particular outcome this is"
"this is an inverse problem that is"
"generally not solvable and we think"
"biology doesn't doesn't work like this"
"either what what what is exists on top"
"of this emergent uh Dynamic is a set of"
"feedback loops which if this system is"
"deviated from the correct shape uh these"
"feedback loops and so that could be"
"through injury mutation uh teratogens"
"whatever these feedback loops kick in"
"both at the level of physics which is"
"what I'm going to show you next and uh"
"the level of transcription to try to get"
"back to the correct State now on the one"
"hand well biologists know all about"
"feedback loops right and there are many"
"examples of homeostatic Cycles um but on"
"the other hand there's something weird"
"here which is that in this case the set"
"point of the homeostatic process is not"
"a single number the way it would be for"
"pH or"
"um some some"
"metabolite level or something like that"
"uh the set point here is some kind of"
"anatomical descriptor it's a complex"
"data structure it's not a scalar it's"
"not a single number and so this this"
"scheme this way of thinking about it"
"makes a very strong prediction the"
"prediction is that if this is true then"
"your opportunity to make changes is not"
"limited to down here what you could do"
"is to is to take advantage of what's"
"great about this architecture which"
"think about your thermostat the amazing"
"thing about your thermostat is that you"
"can change the temperature if you"
"understand where the set point is"
"encoded and you don't need to rewire the"
"machine in fact you don't actually even"
"have to understand everything about how"
"your thermostat works the only thing you"
"have to do is recognize that it is in"
"fact a homeostat and you have to know"
"how to decode and encode the uh the set"
"points and then the system takes care of"
"it so if this if this is all true what"
"we ought to be able to do is to find"
"decode and rewrite set points anatomical"
"set points and let the same standard"
"wild type cells do what they do best we"
"don't need to rewire the hardware so so"
"is this possible and if so so we've we"
"spent you know the last a couple of"
"decades uh look at looking for this and"
uh
"how we started thinking about this was"
"okay so so if this is a goal kind of a"
"goal seeking error minimization system"
"what Inspirations for that do we have"
"and the obvious one of course is the"
"brain the brain or the the what what uh"
"in in the nervous system and the Brain"
"what we have is a collection of cells"
"which work together to allow flexible"
"problem solving towards specific goals"
"how do we do that well there's this"
"Hardware which is a network of these"
"neurons that has ion channels on its"
"surface they thus you have a voltage"
"State and that voltage state is"
"communicated to the neighboring cells"
"and that Hardware underlies the"
"cognitive software so this is a"
"zebrafish brain you're seeing um all the"
"electrical activity as this fish is uh"
"uh thinking about whatever fish think"
"about and"
"um the commitment of Neuroscience is"
"that if we understood how to decode this"
"these physiological events we could"
"literally know what the animal was"
"thinking what Memories it had what"
"preferences it has what behavioral"
"repertoires everything is actually"
"encoded in this electrical activity"
"that's a very that's a very profound and"
"bold claim well it turns out that every"
"cell has this every cell has ion"
"channels most cells have Gap Junction"
"these electrical synapses with their"
neighbors
"um and uh this this system is way older"
"than neurons and brains this was"
"actually invented around the time of"
"bacterial biofilms evolution discovered"
"this and so you might say could we Port"
"from uh Neuroscience all of the tools"
"and Concepts to basically do the neural"
"decoding that people do in the brain and"
"do it during morphogenesis to ask what"
"what is the collective intelli whereas"
"here what people are doing is asking how"
"does this electrophysiology help us"
"understand what the collective"
"intelligence of these cells is doing we"
"ask exactly the same question here how"
"is the electrophysiology of"
"morphogenesis helping us to understand"
"how that Collective behaves in morphe"
"space because there is a very strong I"
"saw um uh kind of uh uh invariant"
"between these two Fields whereas the"
"results of these electrical networks the"
"computations that go on in these"
"electrical networks control your muscles"
"to move the animal through"
"three-dimensional space exactly the same"
"system was the ancestral uh form and"
"what it used to do was make computations"
"to control cells to move your body"
"configuration through morphos space and"
"what evolution did was then simply pivot"
"pivot this thing from one space into the"
"other but all the mechanisms are the"
"same and many of the algorithms are the"
"same although it's much slower and and"
"so so you have to make a couple of"
"changes including including speed but"
"otherwise what we think is that is that"
"neurons and synapses basically just"
"speed optimized some things that"
"cellular networks were doing long before"
"uh Behavior showed up so we developed"
"some tools to try to read and write this"
"information into the collective"
"Collective computations of cells so"
"first voltage sensitive dies so this is"
"a voltage sensitive reporter die that"
"helps you image what all the electrical"
"states are in this early frog embryo"
"this is a time lapse here and then we do"
"a lot of um uh kind of uh biophysical"
"modeling to understand how these"
"gradients arise from different channels"
"and pumps that all of these cells have"
"so I want to show you two quick examples"
"and this is this is the work of Danny"
"Adams in our group and uh What uh what"
"she did was make this video of this um"
"uh this this frog embryo uh that is uh"
"putting its face together these are the"
"early steps of of craniofacial formation"
"and again we're using this voltage"
"sensitive dye the light colors are"
"depolarized the dark are hyper polarized"
"and what you see is that prior to the"
"gene expression that regionalizes the"
"face you already see here's where the"
"eye is going to go here's where the"
"mouth is going to go here the the"
"lateral structures"
"these cells uh this this this tissue"
"already has a pre-pattern a a an"
"energetic pre-pattern of where the"
"different organs are going to go and we"
"know this is instructive because if you"
"alter this pre-pattern then the shape of"
"the the the shape of the face is is"
"changed accordingly and I'll show you"
"that momentarily so this is a natural"
"pre-pattern that is required for normal"
"morphogenesis this is a pathological"
"pattern where we can inject human"
"oncogene into these tadpoles what the"
"oncogene does is cause them electrically"
"to disconnect from their neighbors and"
"to depolarize and at that point they"
"just become amoebas the the boundary"
"between self and World shifts they they"
"scale down to the kinds of things"
"individual cells know how to do as"
"opposed to large cellular networks and"
"they become a tumor and they've been"
"metastasized and they sort of treat the"
"rest of the animals just external"
"environment so okay so so this is this"
"is how we trace and track these these uh"
"these communications now the more"
"important thing which is the functional"
"tools basically what we do is we steal"
"everything from uh from Neuroscience we"
"we don't use any applied um"
"electromagnetic fields we don't use"
"electrodes what we do is we target using"
"molecular tools such as pharmacology and"
"optogenetics we use molecular tools to"
"Target the natural interface that these"
"cells offer to us and to each other that"
"interface is of course the Gap Junctions"
"that determine the connectivity of the"
"network and the ion channels that"
"determine their electric State at any"
"moment in time relaxation so we can open"
"and close these these things with drugs"
"we can we can use light in the case of"
"uh uh light gated ion channels we can"
"use a neurotransmitter signaling"
"directly all of the same tools that work"
"in Neuroscience work in every other"
"tissue of the body and here are some"
"some examples of um of interesting"
"things that can that you can get that"
way
"um I showed you I showed you a special"
"bioelectrical pattern that indicates"
"where the eye is going to go"
"so what we decided was to reproduce that"
"pattern somewhere else and this is the"
"work of graduate student at the time"
"Sherry out in my lab and of vibepop's"
"pie who's a staff scientist"
"um what what they did was to introduce a"
"an RNA encoding a particular potassium"
"channel into some cells that are going"
"to be the various other parts of the"
"embryo for example the gut and what you"
"find is that even in tissues that were"
"according to the textbook not competent"
"to become I uh you can still you can"
"still form an eye if you first establish"
"this particular bioelectrical pattern"
"that says build an eye here now notice a"
"couple of critical things first of all"
"these eyes have the same sort of"
"internal components that normalize are"
"supposed to have lens right and optic"
"nerve all that"
"but we didn't give them any enough"
"information to specify any of that"
"complexity all we did was specify"
"actually a very uh informationally poor"
"stimulus that didn't include all the"
"details this means it's a modular almost"
"subroutine call it's a it's a trigger"
"that uh that all the cleverness is in"
"the substrate it's the cleverness isn't"
"in what we put in that's just a simple"
"trigger all the intelligence is in the"
"rest of the tissue which can see that"
"simple signal and uh and interpret that"
"in in the at the scale of organs we're"
"not telling individual cells that this"
"stem cell should become a retinal cell"
"that that's not the information the"
"information is a an organ level modular"
"trigger the second amazing thing is is"
this
"look here this is this is a lens an"
"ectopic lens sitting out in the tail of"
"a tadpole somewhere uh these blue cells"
"which are labeled with a beta"
"galactosidase lineage label these are"
"the ones that we injected with uh the"
"potassium Channel but there's not enough"
"of them to make a proper lens so what do"
"they do they do exactly what another"
"familiar kind of collective intelligence"
"does which is ants they get their"
"neighbors they recruit their neighbors"
"to participate so while there's not"
"enough of these cells to build a proper"
"lens they take cells that are perfectly"
"wild type that were never directly"
"Modified by us and they recruit them"
"into this project to build a an exactly"
"a lens of the right size and shape so"
"not only the ability to specify organs"
"at a high level but the ability to take"
"care of all the morphogenesis and in"
"fact the recruitment the scaling of"
"um of of of agents to your task is done"
"uh in an automatic way that we do not"
"have to micromanage so this is great for"
"engineering for bioregender and person"
"this is great these things have all"
"kinds of interesting capacities that we"
"do not need to micromanage we can take"
"advantage of what else can you do this"
"way well we can build we can build"
"ectopic uh we can ask for a topic oh"
"odor assists or inner ear organs we can"
"make extra Hearts we can make extra"
"forebrains extra limbs here's our"
"six-legged frog or we can make fins now"
"that's kind of weird tadpoles aren't"
"supposed to have fins that's more of a"
"fish thing we'll get to that momentarily"
"and um of course this is all potentially"
"very useful for regenerative medicine so"
"this is our our project on on limb"
"regeneration adult frogs at this stage"
"do not regenerate their legs"
"we came up with a bioelectric cocktail"
"that uh triggers a build a leg here kind"
"of uh kind of cascade and so what"
"happens then is after 24 hours of"
"exposure to this bioelectric uh stimulus"
"immediately the msx1 blastema markers"
"are turned on so you've got this"
"blastema forming and it makes uh it"
"within within about 45 days you get this"
"nice you get this nice leg and"
"eventually eventually you get a pretty"
"respectable leg out of it so um at this"
"point I have to do a disclosure so Dave"
"Kaplan and I are co-founders of a"
"company called morpheutical zinc because"
"we're now taking the same thing into"
"mammals and so so the idea is using"
"David's bioreactor wearable bioreactor"
"technology to stimulate the wound and"
"try to get back some sort of"
"regenerative regeneration after injury"
"remember we are not micromanaging this"
"process we are not putting in stem cells"
"we are not directing uh differentiation"
"over that time period 24 hours of"
"stimulation gives a year and a half of"
"leg growth in the Frog it is not"
"controlling that process it is"
"convincing those cells right at the"
"beginning when they're trying to make a"
"decision between scarring and growth"
"which way they're going to go after that"
"we take our hands off and that's a"
"that's a that's a key uh strategy from"
"the perspective of engineering that you"
"want to uh you want to exploit the"
"autonomous capacities of your material"
"you do not want to try to try to have to"
"micromanage it"
"I want to um I want to shift gears to uh"
"to this to this organism and really"
"think again about this notion of of"
"memory and and goal directedness in in"
"morphogenesis so these planaria are"
"Immortal they do not age they're such"
"great regenerators that uh they they"
"regenerate everything continuously and"
"one thing you can do in these plenary is"
"this Amazing Experiment so here's one"
"head one tail"
"if I cut off the head on the tail this"
"middle fragment reliably 100 of the time"
"gives me a normal worm now"
"um what we discovered was that how does"
"how does this piece know how many heads"
"it's supposed to have so we discovered"
"that there's this is the work of Wendy"
"Bean in my group that there's actually a"
"um an electric circuit that tells that"
"tells these cells how many how many"
"heads they're supposed to be built and"
"so what we can do is here's the here's"
"the voltage pattern that that represents"
"their memory of of what a correct"
"planarian looks like and what we can do"
"is we can go ahead and edit that again"
"by targeting specific ion channels to"
"look like this so it's it's messy the"
"technology is still being worked out but"
"uh you have you have now clearly this"
"pattern says two heads instead of one"
"when you do this uh you you you do this"
"you get a two-headed worm this is not"
"Photoshop these are real real animals"
"but but here's the most amazing thing"
"not only is this electrical pattern"
"instructive for how many heads you're"
"supposed to have this pattern is the"
"readout of this animal not of this"
"animal so a single-headed body with"
"normal gene expression so anterior genes"
"in the head Noe anterior genes in the"
back
"can have two different representations"
"of what to do if it gets injured in"
"other words I I claim to you at the very"
"beginning that uh morphogenesis is a"
"homeostat because it stores an explicit"
"Target morphology it stores the"
"information on what the correct pattern"
"is going to be and so now this is one of"
"those cases where we've decoded it and I"
"can show you that this is that pattern"
"this is the pattern that determines it"
"and it's there long before the situation"
"actually comes up so in a way this is an"
"interesting example of a counter factual"
"memory this is not what's going on right"
"now this is a stored data structure"
"about what you're going to do if you get"
"injured in the future right so that's"
"that's a really primitive version of"
"something that brains do very well which"
"is this kind of mental time travel where"
"you'll remember what happened before you"
"can predict what happens next it doesn't"
"have to be happening right now now why"
"do I keep calling this a memory and this"
"is the work of nestoroviedo uh that uh"
"what what we did was uh we took these uh"
"we took these two-headed planaria and we"
"simply recut them again in plain water"
"no more manipulation of any kind and we"
"found that now you might think that well"
"the genomics are wild type we didn't do"
"any genetic editing here there's there's"
"nothing wrong with the genome so if we"
"get rid of this ectopic primary head and"
"we get rid of this uh the get rid of"
"this topic secondary how to get rid of"
"the primary head and this nice middle"
"gut fragment that has normal genetics"
"well surely it should go on to be a"
"normal worm and that's not what happens"
"what happens is if you keep cutting"
"these guys this middle fragment will"
"continue to generate two-headed worms"
"and you can see them here so this"
"fulfills the basic criteria of memory in"
"anatomical space it's long term stable"
"it's rewritable because we can set it"
"from here to here actually we can we now"
"also know how to take a two-headed worm"
"and get it back to a one-headed state"
"and it has latency conditional recall"
"what I just showed you a minute ago so"
"the question of what determines how many"
"heads this animal has and then that's a"
"that's an important question from the"
"engineering perspective if you want to"
"engineer life you need to know what the"
"what the determinants are it's really"
"interesting it's it's the genetics only"
"insofar as the genetics creates uh uh"
"the hardware where the default behavior"
"of that circuit is to specify an"
"electrical pattern that says one hit"
"that's the default pattern that happens"
"when you turn on the juice of this"
"electrical circuit but the cool thing"
"about this circuit is actually"
"reprogrammable experience not genetic"
"change but experience in physiological"
"space will convert it to store a new"
"piece of information and that new piece"
"of information is stable it will keep"
"until you reset it so what we're doing"
"now is is trying to refine these"
"computational models that merge the"
um
"State space of the electrical circuit"
"that maintains this information with"
"existing thought in connectionist"
"architectures where uh it's you know"
"people are now working on understanding"
"how electrical networks store and encode"
"information in a way that allows them to"
"regain that information when pieces of"
"the material are gone so there's lots of"
"lots of work being done on this in uh in"
"computer science and uh and machine"
"learning and things like that yeah it's"
"my it's it's more even now it gets even"
"more interesting than just head number"
"because that's what this this is all"
"about the number of heads it gets more"
"interesting than that it's also about"
"head shape so you can take this"
"triangular shaped planarian amputate The"
"Head and perturb the electrical"
"connectivity of the rest of the cells as"
"they are trying to figure out where they"
"where the electric circuit should settle"
"here's the here's the normal attractor"
"and it gets confused and sometimes you"
"get these flat-headed beefalinas and"
"sometimes you get round-headed S"
"Mediterranean it's not just the shape of"
"the head but it's also distribution of"
"the stem cells and the shape of the"
"brain that's the same as these other"
"species these other species are about"
"150 to 100 million years distant from"
"this so without genetic change what you"
"can do physiologically is to explore the"
"different attractors that are the"
"standard outcome for other species but"
"you can explore them with exactly the"
"same Hardware not only can you explore"
"those attractors there's a huge latent"
"space of possible shapes that you can"
"make so this this these are all wild"
"type planarian cells this is this is"
"because some kind of crazy spiky hair"
"spiky shaped form you can change the"
"Symmetry type you can make composite"
"forms like this and this is not some"
"weird feature of planaria this is"
"ubiquitous look at this look at this of"
"the example from the planned Kingdom"
"this is um these are Galls right and"
"this this bizarre looking thing is"
"formed out of the plant's own cells"
"because it's being hacked by signals"
"from a wasp embryo that's in there and"
"these these are not created from wasp"
"cells the the WASP is putting out"
"signals that hijack the normal"
"morphogenetic Machinery of these cells"
"that normally make a nice flat green"
"architecture and instead they make this"
"this round red spiky thing and that's"
"because morphogenesis from the beginning"
"is reprogrammable it is it is uh um it"
"is it is amenable to being hacked and"
"and and because the cells are normally"
"doing that to each other to get them to"
"undergo complex morphogenesis I'll show"
"you some examples of that in a minute"
"and so"
"um a couple a couple of quick kind of uh"
"medical things and then and then we'll"
"get to the um the xenobots"
"so I just want to say that the the key"
"to all of this is is getting a nice"
"multi-scale view kind of a full stack"
"model of what's going on from the"
"molecular networks that Express ion"
"channels so here's where your Hardware"
"is determined then to understand the"
"physiology that that gives you the"
"bioelectric gradients and we have a"
"simulator that allows us to do all this"
"written by Alexis pytack and then to"
"understand the logic and eventually get"
"it down into an algorithmic model of how"
"regions make decisions about what"
"they're going to be right so to scale up"
"the decision making progressively from"
"the hardware all the way to anatomical"
"level and decision making where the"
"regenerative discovery of regenerative"
"interventions is the easiest so this is"
"just a quick example of how how we did"
that
"just to show you that it's positive that"
"this whole thing is possible"
"here's a normal frog brain so here's a"
"forebrain midbrain and hindbrain"
"and uh when these guys are exposed to"
"various teratogens like nicotine alcohol"
"or even mutations the brain has all"
"kinds of defects and what we what we"
"wanted to do was to we would to to build"
"a model that would help us find uh"
"repair interventions so as Engineers we"
"want to know what's the what's the"
"easiest thing we can do to get this"
"thing back to normal so we make this"
"computational model that that"
"explains how the bioelectrics of the"
"early ectodermal cells dictate the shape"
"and size of your brain and then we do"
"this we ask the model in a scenario"
"where that bioelectric shape is wrong so"
"here for example this is the hardest"
"case this is a mutation in a gene called"
"Notch Notch is a really critical"
"neurogenesis Gene with me with a"
"dominant Notch mutation the forebrain is"
"gone the midbrain and hindbrain are a"
"big bubble these animals have no"
"behaviors it's just radical defect"
"we asked the model something very simple"
"uh which channel could we open and close"
"to get the bioelectric state back to"
"normal the model knows nothing about the"
"pathways that are Downstream of the"
"bioelectrics all the gene expression all"
"we asked was how do we get back to the"
"correct high level pattern that tells"
"these cells what a normal brain looks"
"like the model said that under those"
"conditions this is a good channel to"
"open I can tell you exactly why it's a"
"it's a whole story here this is the"
"hcn2i channel and we did something very"
"simple we either introduced extra hcn2"
"channels or we just used two drugs two"
"known drugs to open the existing hcn2"
"channels and lo and behold they get"
"their brains back they get brain"
"structure back they get gene expression"
"and they get their behaviors back they"
"get their IQs become indistinguishable"
"from controls even though they're still"
"bearing this really nasty Notch mutation"
"so this is an example and I'm not saying"
"this will work in every case but this is"
"an example of fixing a really drastic"
"Hardware defect in software if you"
"override despite the fact that you've"
"got some broken signaling Machinery if"
"you override it with a top level signal"
"that says this is what your brain should"
"look like you can you can rescue a very"
"a very drastic fundamental kind of"
"defect and so what we're working towards"
"is this kind of computational"
"environment for Designing"
"electroceticals you should you should"
"know what your desired electrical state"
"is you know what your disease state is"
"you use the simulator to say how do I"
"turn the disease State into the healthy"
"State and then you go to the um to drug"
"bank and you pick out an existing ION"
"channel drug many of them already"
"approved for human use to uh and then"
"and then you know you do some filtering"
"to make sure you don't hit the the"
"cardiac cardiac Rhythm circuit and all"
"of that so a couple of things uh just to"
"kind of end on a couple of quick things"
"what we what we see in evolution is this"
"amazing process of scaling up of goals"
"so these individual cells have very"
"local homeostatic set points that they"
"can pursue so metabolics and and various"
"other things what evolution did is allow"
"them to form electrical networks that"
"communicate to that that that merge"
"these little homeostats into something"
"that can pursue a much larger goal they"
"can pursue navigation policies and"
"anatomical morphis space something that"
"the individual cells cannot do but this"
"has a failure mode this is human"
"glioblastoma when when this process"
"breaks down the cells revert back to"
"their unicellular single cell goals"
"which is you know every cell wants to"
"become two cells and eat as much as it"
"can and go wherever life is good that's"
"metastasis so if you have this kind of"
"um unusual view of cancer as a problem"
"of uh a shrinking computational boundary"
"between self and world this idea that"
"when cells connect to each other they"
"have a bigger perceptual kind of a"
"cognitive light cone that allows them to"
"to to to hold on to bigger goals bigger"
"homeostatic set points you can think"
"about a engineering a therapeutic like"
"this so we put in the human oncogene"
"normally it makes a tumor but what we'll"
"do is we'll co-inject a specific ION"
"channel to keep these cells connected to"
"their neighbors and this is this is uh"
"this works for nasty k-ras mutants p53"
"and so on"
"you can um you can see the the oncogene"
"is labeled in red uh it's still still"
"blazingly strong Express but there's no"
"tumor this is the same animal there's no"
"tumor because what drives is not the"
"genetics what drives is the physiology"
"and in particular the scale at which"
"these cells make decisions in this case"
"in in this case they're making"
"individual cell decisions of what's good"
"for them they're not more selfish than"
"other cells it's just their selves"
"they're much smaller that's the embryos"
"just external environment to them but in"
"this case they're making Collective"
"decisions and the collective is looking"
"to make a nice muscle nice skin it's"
"navigating this this different space"
"that the individual cells can't"
so
"um when we start to think of it this way"
"we can ask well where do the goals of"
"these collectives come from uh"
"what and and furthermore what kind of"
"goals are they capable of pursuing and"
"where do the specific set points come"
"from and so that leads me to the last"
"Quick bit which is this um and this is"
"the work of uh Doug Blackiston did all"
"the biology Sam kriegman the computer"
"science and this is a project with um"
"Josh bongard at the University of"
"Vermont with whom we've started this uh"
"this this institute we asked the simple"
"question uh if we were to liberate cells"
"from the normal boundary condition"
"could they reboot their multicellularity"
"what do they like to cooperate"
"fundamentally and what would they build"
"if they were out of their normal"
"environment and so uh so what we did"
"here is this this is an early frog"
"embryo we take some cells up here that"
"are going to be epidermis so so skin we"
"dissociate these cells we put them in a"
"little in a little uh pile and they'll"
"get rid of everything else so just skin"
"now what could they do well they could"
"do a number of things they could crawl"
"away from each other if they could die"
"they could do nothing they could form a"
"two-dimensional monolayer many things"
"they could do instead here's what oops"
"uh here's what they do"
um
"they coalesce together"
"into this uh into this little little uh"
"little little fragment and they become"
"this compact little little round thing"
"uh the flashes you see are calcium"
"signaling and what it does is this it"
"becomes a xenobot um xenopus lavis is"
"the name of the frog biobot so we call"
"them xenobots"
"they're using the little hairs that they"
"normally have for"
"um pulling mucus down down their their"
"bodies they use them to swim so the ones"
"on this side row to the left the ones on"
"this side row to the right and this"
"little little patch of skin starts"
"moving around they can go in circles"
"they can go back and forth"
"that we we can we can track Collective"
"motion like this where they interact"
"with each other when they when they take"
"various long Journeys we can make them"
"into various shapes so Doug Doug does"
"all this uh he can under under the the"
"directions of this AI a program that"
"that Josh and Sam have written they can"
"make various shapes here here's a"
"xenobot doing a maze so"
"Still Water no water movement so it"
"takes the coroner without having to bump"
"into anything and at this point it"
"spontaneously turns around and goes back"
"where it came from all of this this is"
"skin there's no neurons here there's no"
"brain just skin so you're starting to"
"see this this this"
"um the the novel uh"
um
"behaviors and capabilities both"
"morphogenetic and uh and behavioral that"
"are in this this tissue it regenerates"
"so if you cut it in half just about here"
"look at this 180 degree hinge boom it"
"folds up like this"
"um they have some really interesting"
"calcium signaling that we are in the"
"process of analyzing to see if there's"
"evidence of mutual information and you"
"know who knows what how many of the"
"tools from a neuroscience will fit here"
"and then I'll just end with with this"
"this is the most amazing part of all uh"
"we have um"
"we have made it impossible for these"
"animals to uh for these for these"
"creatures to reproduce the normal froggy"
"fashion because they're just Skin So"
"turns out that if you provide them with"
"loose skin cells what they do is they"
"run around and they collect these skin"
"cells and they shape them into little"
"balls and because they are working"
"within a gentle material just like us we"
"were working with these skin cells and"
"so are they because of that these little"
"balls become xenobots in the next uh"
"overnight they mature to become the next"
"generation of xenobots and guess what"
"they do they run around and repeat the"
"cycle and they do exactly the same thing"
"this is kinematic self-replication this"
"is Von Neumann's dream of a robot that"
"goes around finds Parts in its"
"environment and makes a copy of itself"
"now this is extremely primitive there"
"are many things missing it's there's no"
"hard heredity uh meaning that The"
"Offspring don't particularly look like"
"their parents they all sort of look like"
"the same thing but it is kinematic"
"replication and then and so and so"
"here's the kind of most amazing piece of"
"this which is that what what did the"
"xenopus lavis genome actually learn"
"during Evolution well you might think"
"that while it learned to make this it"
"learned to uh to through eons of of"
"shaping through selection it makes this"
"developmental sequence then it makes"
"tadpoles uh but actually we find out"
"that well"
"um that's what the and and so and so"
"under this scenario the skin cells have"
"an invariant outcome they have this this"
"boring two-dimensional life being the"
"outer layer of the of the embryo but"
"that's not the only thing they know how"
"to do if you take away the all of the"
"other cells meaning we don't engineer by"
adding
"um the different transgenes or or things"
"like or circuits all we do is take away"
"the other instructive influences that"
"basically bully these cells into being"
"this boring two-dimensional layer what"
"you then find out is that in the absence"
"of that behavior shaping this is what"
"those cells actually know how to do and"
"this is what they do by default this is"
"what they want to do which is to form a"
"xenobot with its own bizarre"
"developmental sequence this is several"
"weeks of development uh what the heck"
"this is that nobody knows this never"
"existed before there's never been"
"evolutionary pressure to be a good"
"xenobot to do kinematic replication all"
"of this is completely uh uh emergent in"
"the latent space of behaviors from the"
"machine that this genome encodes so I"
"would argue that in some cases evolution"
"is not creating specific solutions to"
"specific problems it makes general"
"purpose problem-solving machines that"
"are able to navigate different kind of"
"spaces in new ways and as Engineers this"
"is what we need to learn to manipulate"
um
"and uh well I think because of this"
"biology is incredibly interoperable so"
"every combination of evolved material"
"meaning genetic sequences cells tissues"
"organs whatever and some kind of"
"designed matter and and some kind of"
"software every combination is going to"
"be some kind of viable creature on this"
"enormous option space so all of the"
"natural you know all of Darwin's endless"
"forms most beautiful they write the"
"natural forms on Earth are are here and"
"all of this hybrids cyborgs every kind"
"of um a kind of a combination of these"
"things is here somewhere and that has"
"huge implications for trying to develop"
"uh not only a science but an ethics of"
"relating to organisms that do not share"
"any path on The evolutionary tree with"
"us and have potentially radically"
"different embodiments and thus Minds so"
"I'll stop here and just to say that if"
"anybody's interested in this stuff here"
"are kind of a variety of of papers that"
"you can take a look at I want to thank"
"the the postdocs and the students who"
"did all the work that I showed you today"
"are our funders here all the"
"illustrations by Jeremy gay and uh the"
"two company disclosures and always most"
"of the credit goes to the model systems"
"because they do all the heavy lifting so"
"I'll stop here and thank you for"
