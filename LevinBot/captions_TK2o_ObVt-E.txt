"and audio recording as well"
yes
"so hello everyone welcome to our second"
"day of special speciality it's a real"
"pleasure uh to be here with"
"mike 11 and with my partners mandy and"
"alvaro we're gonna"
"proceed very shortly i just wanted to"
"remind you that we have our social space"
"gather town and discord to follow up to"
"follow up with discussions after these"
meetings
"so today mandy is going to be your host"
"and take it over to you"
"so our first session of today will"
"feature michael evan exploring our"
"conference themes of space shape and"
"distance but this time from the unique"
"perspectives of the biological"
"computational and cognitive michael is a"
"van of our bush professor and a"
"distinguished professor in the biology"
"department at tufts university and the"
"director of the allen discovery center"
"at tufts and the tough center for"
regenerative
"and developmental biology"
"michael's dual backgrounds in both"
"computer science and biology bring an"
"interesting perspective that has been"
"reshaping a lot of our previous"
"conversations of how organisms get their"
shape
"his research in biological communication"
"shaping organisms morphology has"
"collaboratory work with using computers"
"to design synthetic biological"
"functioning xenobots and overall his"
"theories of how spatial and temporal"
"information is communicated in the"
"process of biological self-assembly have"
"been groundbreaking"
"and especially that's fascinating to me"
"personally as someone with eat in both"
"biological and theory of computation"
"fields and with similar questions as the"
"lifeblood of my academic curiosity"
"i think his work has a lot to contribute"
"toward our topics of digging deep into"
"the transdisciplinary foundations of"
"space shape distance and personally i"
"think the underlying paradigms he"
"explores resonate greatly with the"
"spirit of sound i'm glad that he will"
"get the opportunity to share his"
"thoughts with you today thank you"
"michael evan the virtual floor is yours"
"well thank you so much and i'm delighted"
"to be here thank you for uh putting on"
"such an amazing symposium"
"and uh you're giving me the opportunity"
"to share some thoughts with you in in"
"long form"
"so uh what i'm going to talk about today"
"is uh basically uh"
"the fields of collective intelligence in"
"unconventional spaces and if anybody"
"would like to get in touch with me"
"afterwards all of the primary papers the"
"software everything else is is here so i"
"want to start by uh just showing one of"
"my one of my heroes alan turing"
"we all know that he was a forefather of"
"artificial intelligence he was very"
"interested in uh this idea of of"
"creating uh cognitive systems and"
"various kinds of intelligence um"
"and uh this is this is this is well"
"known what's maybe less well known is"
"that the same person was really"
"interested in morphogenesis he wrote one"
"of the very early uh papers on uh on"
"trying to understand self-organizing uh"
"chemical systems and you might wonder"
"why it is that the same person would be"
"interested in intelligence and"
"morphogenesis and i think that uh he saw"
"a very deep uh parallel between these"
"two these these two areas of study and i"
"think he was right on the money in the"
"sense that um i think these are actually"
"very much the same question"
now
"most of the time when we think of"
"intelligence we think of something like"
"this so here's a brain and we think of"
"okay here's a here's a what"
"quote-unquote centralized intelligence"
"of some some animal um and then we look"
"at things like this ant colonies and so"
"on and sometimes we talk about them as"
"uh distributed or collective"
"intelligence is swarm cognition and so"
"on you know ricardo lay calls them"
"liquid brains but actually it's it's"
"important to realize that this is just a"
"matter of scale because if one zooms in"
"you find out that we are all in fact"
"collective intelligences and we are all"
"made of something like this so this is a"
"single cell this is a lacrimarium"
"it has no brain it has no nervous system"
"it has no cell to cell uh communications"
"or stem cells or any of the things that"
"we're used to having in bodies and"
"what it what it does is it handles all"
"of its local needs so so morphological"
"uh behavioral metabolic and so on at the"
"single cell level very competently"
"and the amazing thing about this is that"
"we all"
"have taken the same"
"uh journey"
"from uh"
"that's on track from um what's what"
"might be called just physics which is an"
"oocyte right a set of uh"
"a set of chemical reactions that people"
"would look at and would think okay this"
"this has no cognitive capacity this is"
"just just some physics and chemistry and"
"yet uh slowly so over a matter of some"
"months and and maybe years this process"
"gives rise to these amazing morphologies"
"and in fact to high-level human"
"cognition that has second order you know"
"metacognition and self-awareness and so"
on
"and so this is a journey across the"
"cartesian cut that we all take if you"
"follow your own uh your own development"
"back far enough you will find this and"
"before that you will find just so is"
"quote-unquote just physics so it's"
"really interesting to to ask how this"
"transition works this smooth transition"
"and so the main points that i'm going to"
"try to transmit today are these first"
"that biology uses a kind of multi-scale"
"competency architecture of nested"
"problem solvers and that navigation is a"
"really central concept to try to"
"understand navigation of spaces in"
"particular is a central concept to try"
"to understand this"
"i'm going to claim that goal"
"directedness is a is a critical"
"invariant for recognizing building and"
"uh relating to various unconventional"
agents
"and i'll describe a kind of cognitive"
"boundary model for the scaling of goals"
"i'm going to spend about half the talk"
"showing you one specific example in"
"detail which is this idea that uh"
"pattern formation biological pattern"
"formation is literally the behavior of a"
"collective intelligence of cells in a"
"space known as morphospace"
"and i'm going to show you that"
"bioelectrical networks are the uh"
"protocognitive medium the ancestor of"
"brain function and this this idea"
"actually has some very practical impacts"
"on biomedicine this is not just a sort"
"of philosophy this has very specific"
"applications and in the end i'm going to"
"show you how synthetic bioengineering"
"provides a really astronomically large"
"option space for new bodies and new"
"minds that don't have standard"
"evolutionary backstories so we'll get to"
"that towards the end"
"so uh single cells have some really uh"
"interesting spatial competencies that we"
"can start off by thinking about so this"
"is a diatom this is a single cell in"
"that particular very particular"
"structure is something that it can"
"reliably acquire"
"this is a collection of uh several"
"acetabularia algae each one of these"
"things is in fact a single cell it has"
"one nucleus the whole thing is maybe"
"you know six or seven centimeters long"
"it has some roots it has a stock it has"
"a cap here the whole thing is just one"
"cell and so this is quite interesting to"
"ask how it is that a single cell can"
"have such such profound morphological"
"differentiation but these uh these"
"competencies are not only spatial they"
"are also uh behavioral and so what"
"you're seeing here is a sly mold this is"
"a physarum polycephalum it is uh the"
"whole thing is one cell it could be it"
"can grow to be very large but the whole"
"thing is one cell and so when you place"
"it in the middle of this this petri dish"
"the little white circles are glass disks"
"there's nothing there's no food there's"
"no chemicals they're completely inert"
"glass so what it will do as it grows"
"during the first few hours it sort of"
"grows evenly outward like this and what"
"it's doing during this time is"
"sending out vibrations into the medium"
"it pulses and sends vibrations into the"
"medium reading back the vibrations that"
"that return so it's almost a kind of"
"sonar it's sensing uh sensing the"
"properties of the medium and by doing"
"this it can actually build a map of its"
"environment and then reliably make its"
"way over to the heavier mass so it can"
"reliably detect three disks over one and"
"you get all sorts of fun experiments of"
"stacking them one on top of each other"
"and distributing them but it has an"
"amazing ability to sense the mass in its"
"vicinity and to make both morphogenetic"
"and behavioral decisions based on that"
"information okay so so you can you can"
"see this this cell navigating in this in"
"this space"
"according to the to the biomechanical"
"information that it has so i'm going to"
"show you four basic things today so so"
"first i'm going to um try to uh"
"uh introduce some some biology that you"
"may or may not have seen before"
"designed to really kind of stretch our"
"idea of what is an organism what is a"
"mind what does it mean to navigate space"
"and so on and then"
"then we'll get into this very specific"
"examples of bioelectricity and"
"morphogenesis and then"
"we'll talk about some of these novel"
"organisms so"
"uh the kind of the traditional view is"
"is of these um"
"discrete static natural kinds you have a"
"particular animal maybe you have a rat"
"that you're studying in a maze or a"
"human subject or whatever you have and"
"that's you know that's kind of that's"
"kind of your unit but i want to i want"
"to go beyond this this sort of garden of"
"eden view and really emphasize that"
"agents that do these intelligent things"
"are incredibly plastic so here's one"
"familiar example here we start with a"
"caterpillar this is a creature that"
"lives in a in a"
"largely two-dimensional world that"
"crawls around on flat surfaces it chews"
"leaves and it has a brain appropriate"
"for that purpose"
"it has to turn into a butterfly which is"
"going to live in a very much a"
"three-dimensional world it has to fly it"
"has to drink nectar"
and
"and it needs a completely different"
"brain this is a soft bodied robot this"
"is a hard body uh couldn't you know"
"needs a controller suitable for hard"
"kinds of bodies and so in between what"
"happens is during this process the brain"
"is largely uh largely"
"destroyed most of the connections are"
"broken down most of the cells die and"
"and the new brain is rebuilt"
"during the lifetime of the organism so"
"you know this this this kind of change"
"makes uh the confusion of puberty seem"
"like um"
"real child's play you know in the sense"
"that this is a single agent radically"
"changing it's it's its brain and its"
"body and the amazing thing about it is"
"that uh memories that the caterpillar"
"acquires are retained in the moth or"
"butterfly so this has been shown so"
"despite the despite the uh"
"disaggregation of the brain actually"
"some information is able to make it"
"across in fact this can be even more"
"radical these are these are planaria"
"these are flatworms and you'll see a lot"
"more about them in this talk the"
"planaria regenerate any part of their"
"body so you cut them into pieces the"
"record is something like 275 pieces each"
"piece regrows exactly what's missing"
"including the brain and you get perfect"
"little worms so um james mcconnell back"
"in the 60s made an observation and it"
"was um uh you know quite controversial"
"at the time but we repeated it and and"
"actually discovered he was he was"
"absolutely right uh what happens is that"
"if you if you train these planaria to"
"recognize a particular region of their"
"environment let's say one with these"
"little little bumps laser etched into it"
"as the place where they get fed you can"
"then amputate the head and the brain i"
"mean these animals have a true"
"centralized brain"
"amputate the head in the brain leave the"
"tail the tail sits there for eight or"
"nine days doing pretty much nothing"
"eventually it grows a new"
"fresh brain and somehow that information"
"is imprinted onto this new brain and"
"these animals show show retention of"
"that of that memory so the information"
"moving through the body"
"being imprinted from from one tissue"
"onto another is something that uh we we"
"really need to start to understand and"
"in fact uh beyond uh beyond those kind"
"of experiments you can do this in"
"vertebrates we did this in the tadpole"
"so this is a tadpole of the frogs"
"xenopus lavis um here's the brain here"
"are the nostrils here's the mouth the"
"gut and the tail one thing you'll notice"
"is that what we've done is we've"
"prevented the normal eyes from forming"
"we've put an ectopic eye on the tail so"
"this is a this is an eye that forms on"
"the tail and the amazing thing about"
"these animals is that with no"
"long in fact with no period of"
"evolutionary adaptation to this new"
"configuration they can see perfectly"
"well out of these eyes so we've made a"
"device that tests them on visual"
"training cues"
"and sort of automates the same thing we"
"use to test the planarian memory it's an"
"automated behavior testing device and"
"what we found is that this eye finds"
"itself in a completely novel environment"
"surrounding my muscle instead of near"
"the brain puts out an optic nerve that"
"optic nerve might connect to the spinal"
"cord it does not go up to the brain the"
"brain that evolved for tracking visual"
"data from these two locations suddenly"
"gets information from some weird itchy"
"patch of tissue on its tail no problem"
"it recognizes that as visual data and"
"these animals behave quite well in uh in"
"learning assays so so navigating"
"navigating your world with a radically"
different
"configuration of sensory and processing"
"organs so what we really see in biology"
"is that not only are we nested dolls"
"structurally i mean we all everyone"
"knows that groups consist of individuals"
"made of organs tissues cells and so on"
"but actually each one of these levels"
"has competency it solves problems in its"
"own space and there are lots of"
"different kinds of spaces and that"
"multi-scale architecture uh which is uh"
"which is kind of unique it's something"
"that um"
"in engineering we're still really not"
"not able to uh re recapitulate although"
"we're getting there uh"
"shows common and in many many different"
"spaces now now the one thing i'd like to"
"i'd like to do fundamentally is to"
"uh generalize this idea of being able to"
"perform intelligently in some space so"
typically
"typically we think about"
"three-dimensional spaces so"
"uh behavior moving the body in"
"three-dimensional space so"
"it's very easy for us to to recognize"
"intelligence in those spaces because all"
"of our sense organs point outward and"
"from the time you were very little you"
"were collecting data on object"
"medium-sized objects moving at medium"
"speeds around you in three-dimensional"
"space and and we know how to recognize"
"you know birds and and mammals and other"
"things to be behaving intelligent what"
"we don't have are senses that directly"
"show us for example"
"imagine that you had a you were born"
"with a sense that where you could"
"actually feel your blood chemistry all"
"the different things going on in your"
"blood physiology and all of the things"
"that your liver pancreas and other"
"organs were doing in that case we would"
"have a training set that would allow us"
"to understand intelligent navigation of"
"other spaces so that would be"
"physiological space so the space of"
"physiological parameters"
"it might be a transcriptional space so"
"the space of gene expression all the"
"different gene expression domains or in"
"fact amorphous space this is the space"
"of all possible anatomical"
"configurations we'll talk more about"
"that i want to show you um and and and"
"this this the the the fact that we're"
"not uh familiar with these other spaces"
"means that when we make uh claims about"
"the cognitive level or the intelligence"
"level of other systems we're really"
"taking an iq test ourselves what we're"
"really saying is this is what we've"
"recognized the system to be doing but we"
"can't really assume that that we're"
"smart enough to know exactly what it's"
"doing and what it's solving in all of"
"the different spaces i want to show you"
"a simple example"
"again these are pl these are the"
"planaria and what we found is that if we"
"put planaria into a a solution of barium"
"chloride so barium is a non-specific"
"potassium channel blocker it prevents"
"these cells from"
"exchanging potassium with the outside"
"world so when you do this literally"
"their heads explode okay their heads"
"just overnight they blow up but the"
"amazing thing is that if you keep the"
"rest of the worm in barium over the next"
"couple of weeks they regenerate they"
"grow a brand new head and the new head"
"does not care about barium whatsoever"
"the new head is barium adapted now"
"that's kind of amazing and so we asked"
"the simple question we just looked at"
"the transcriptomes of naive worms versus"
"barium adapted heads and we just asked"
"well what gene expression is different"
"okay what's different about these barium"
"adapted heads"
"and one thing we found is that"
"there's only a handful of genes there's"
"less than a dozen genes that are in fact"
"different and so this this system is"
"able to figure out which genes to up and"
"down regulate so that it can do its"
"business without being able to pass"
"potassium properly"
but
"the incredible thing about this is that"
"barium is not anything that planaria"
"ever see in the wild this is completely"
"a completely unnatural novel stressor so"
"so it's implausible to think that at"
"some point there was evolutionary"
"pressure to develop a response to barium"
"so what you're really talking about here"
"is you're in the you're in the space of"
"gene expression which is you know let's"
"say if they have 20 000 g's it's it's a"
"massively um you know a very high"
"dimensional space and you need to walk"
"in that space to find the exact uh genes"
"that are going to solve your"
"physiological stressor now you don't"
"have time to sort of randomly flip genes"
"on and off first of all because it'll"
"it'll most likely kill you before you"
"find the good concentric the good"
"combinations also also there's no"
"there's no time for that these cells"
"don't turn over that fast it's not like"
"a bacterial evolutionary system so it's"
"still very much an open question how how"
"do they navigate this this"
"transcriptional space to to solve these"
"kinds of solve these kinds of problems"
"so with this this this to me is is very"
"much an example of intelligence in the"
"sense of problem solving taking what you"
"already might know maybe there's"
"information about what to do in a case"
"of epileptic seizures or so on"
"and bringing it to a new a new scenario"
"and so so i've been working on this on"
"this framework"
"now it's called t-a-m-e tame for it"
"stands for technological approach to"
"mind everywhere and the goal of this"
"framework is to be able to uh recognize"
"uh create and relate to truly diverse"
"intelligences so we need to handle of"
"course the things we're familiar with"
"birds uh primates and so on but also"
"weird colonial organisms and swarms and"
"things like that"
"of course all the new things that are"
"being produced by synthetic morphology"
"and synthetic biology approaches and"
"possible exobiological agents because"
"studying uh just the natural um"
"systems that are that that are here on"
"earth and making conclusions about"
"biology from them is a little bit like"
"testing your your theory on the same"
"data set that that created it right it's"
"all just an n of one uh pass through um"
"through phylogenetic space so so i i"
"tend to think about all kinds of"
"unconventional uh different different"
"types of embodiments whether they be"
"evolved designed whatever and really"
"think about this kind of this is a scale"
"by uh rosenbluth weiner and bigelow"
"looking at all the different kinds of"
"behaviors that one might have in one"
"space notice that it says nothing about"
"what it's made of it doesn't doesn't say"
"anything about having brains or being a"
"specific kind of organism or scale"
"temporally or whatever it's it's all"
"it's all very functional so this is this"
"is this is how we think about things in"
"my group and the key to this framework"
"is that it has to uh move experimental"
"work forward it has to enable new"
"capabilities and um i'm going to show"
"you i'm going to show you how that"
"happens but first let's just think about"
"uh this this one particular kind of"
"intelligence which i think is super"
"interesting um anatomical uh control as"
"a as a collective intelligence first of"
"all um notice the basic thing that needs"
"explaining which is that we all start"
"life as a collection of embryonic"
"blastomeres and these this this is a"
"cross-section through a human torso so"
"this is"
"what uh what each of us has inside now"
"look at all the in the incredibly"
"complex invariant order all the all the"
"tissues and structures everything is in"
"the right place next to each other the"
"right orientation size and so on so the"
"first question is"
"where is the shape encoded how do how do"
"these cells know to make exactly this"
"and you might be tempted to say dna and"
"genomes but we can read genomes now and"
"what we see is that genomes directly"
"code for protein structure so the genome"
"specifies the micro level hardware"
"that's present in every cell but there's"
"nothing directly that you can read out"
"in the genome about the symmetry type of"
"the organism the size the shape how"
"regenerative it's going to be"
"this is very much an open problem of how"
"cells know what to what to make and when"
"to stop"
"as workers in regenerative medicine if"
"parts of this are missing we'd like to"
"know how to signal the cells to rebuild"
"to do it again and as engineers we'd"
"like to know well what else is possible"
"right given the exact same genome what"
"else can we ask these cells to do or is"
"this the only thing they could possibly"
"do and"
"you can you can sort of visualize"
"forward the endgame of this whole field"
"is something like this it would be an"
"anatomical compiler where you should be"
"able to sit down and draw at the level"
"of anatomy the animal or plant that you"
"want okay not not the not the pathways"
"not genes but the actual anatomy"
"and uh if we knew what we were doing we"
"would have a system that um deco that"
"compiled that description into a set of"
"stimuli that would have to be given to"
"cells to get them to build this"
"particular thing in this case a nice"
"three-headed planarian now we don't have"
"anything remotely like this is a very"
"long long-term goal and the reason that"
"it's really important is because if you"
"think about it"
"pretty much every problem of biomedicine"
"with the exception of infectious disease"
"so birth defects"
"traumatic injury cancer aging"
"degenerative disease all of these things"
"boil down to one problem how do you"
"convince cells to build the exact"
"structure that you want if we solve that"
"problem all of this goes away we'd be"
"able to fix birth defects regenerate"
"limbs reprogram tumors all of this would"
"would go away but it's a major major"
"problem why do we not have an anatomical"
"compiler yet so i want to be clear that"
"despite the incredible progress in"
"genetics and molecular biology we face"
"very fundamental questions that have to"
"do with not not with the molecular"
"mechanisms but with the decision making"
"so here's a simple example um here is"
"this is a baby axolotl so axolotls are"
"mexican salamander there's a baby"
"axolotl and um baby axolotls have legs"
"here's a tadpole"
"of the frog xenopus lavish tadpoles do"
"not have legs so now in my group we make"
"something called a frogalottle so this"
"is a half it is a it's a chimera half"
"axolotl half frog you can mix the the"
"cells they they cooperate with each"
"other just fine they make something a"
"frog a lottle now i ask a simple"
"question you've got the genome to the"
"axolotl you've got the genome to the"
"frog how come we don't have any models"
"that tell us whether frogolottles will"
"have legs we have no idea from from that"
"information whether frogolottles are"
"going to have legs or not if they do"
"have legs whether those legs will be"
"made of axolotl cells or also include"
"frog cells we have no idea even though"
"you've got the genetic information so"
"it's really important to start to"
"understand the algorithms because"
"where where biomedicine is right now is"
"that uh we're very good at manipulating"
"molecules and cells and getting"
"information like this which is which"
"gene and protein talk to which other"
"gene and protein we are a long way away"
"from actually controlling a large scale"
"form and function and in fact you can"
"think about the the kind of parallel"
"journey that uh the computer science"
"took this is what programming looked"
"like in the 40s and 50s where in order"
"to control the system you had to"
"physically rewire it right you were"
"pulling wires in and out you have to"
"rewire it nowadays"
"uh for a joke i say to all my students"
"you know you're on your laptop you're"
"going to go from from microsoft word to"
"photoshop i want you to get out your"
"soldering iron and start rewind you know"
"start rewiring and of course they all"
"laugh because because nowadays we don't"
"need to do that we understand that if"
"your hardware is good enough it's"
"reprogrammable with stimuli with inputs"
"with experiences not rewiring but of"
"course modern molecular medicine is all"
"about the hardware we're all"
"we're all very excited about genomic"
"editing and protein pathways and single"
"molecule approaches and so i think the"
"reason that we are still roughly where"
"computer science was in the in the 50s"
"is because we are we've been neglecting"
"one important aspect"
"and that is uh multi-scale intelligence"
"in biology now what do i mean by"
"intelligence i mean uh what william"
"james meant which is the ability to"
"reach the same goal by different means"
"and one when we talk about pattern and"
"anatomy when i talk about goals i mean"
"regions of amorphous space now what's"
"more for space morphospace uh is the"
"the space of all possible configurations"
"of some particular structure so if"
"you're looking at snail shells for"
"example there are three parameters that"
"you can define and uh every shell is"
"every every possible snail shell is some"
"point within this amorphous space okay"
"and this is this is an idea that's very"
"that's very old in fact darcy thompson"
"in the 40s had this interesting example"
"in his in his book on growth and form"
"where he noticed that if you just deform"
"certain animal shapes placed on the grid"
"you apply specific deformations to the"
"grid what you get are other other"
"species that do exist now at the time"
"there was no molecular"
"mechanism of course known there was not"
"nothing really"
"really known about this but i think i"
"think now we can we can we can do some"
"some very interesting things with this"
idea
"so uh navigating these spaces"
"changing your body shape to move from"
"one region to another is not uh trivial"
"because there may be local minima there"
"may be barriers there may be all kinds"
"of things so that that's the task that"
"we face as as as morphogenetic agents"
"now embryogenesis is is very good at"
"this they're they're it's extremely"
"reliable so you start off in uh as as"
this
"you know as this kind of pattern and"
"eventually you end up here and that's"
"that's generally very low very low error"
"um but we can already see actually that"
"that this process is not simply a kind"
"of pre-programmed hard-wired walk in"
"morphospace because we can deviate in"
"the in the middle so for example we can"
"take this nice uh human embryo divided"
"in half literally cut it in half and"
"what you get are not two half organisms"
"you get two perfectly normal monozygotic"
"twins that's this is where twins come"
"from and so this is a regenerative event"
"where each sa each half of this embryo"
"basically realizes that it's actually"
"not where it's supposed to be in morph"
space
"and uh and it needs to regenerate the"
"other half in order to make the correct"
"changes to get to its goal and where it"
"needs to go so this is not just"
"embryonic uh for example back to this"
"this the salamander this um this axolotl"
"um these guys regenerate their limbs"
"their eyes their jaws their spinal cords"
"portions of their heart and brain their"
"ovaries they're incredibly regenerative"
"as adults and what happens is that"
"you can amputate for example this limb"
"at different positions no matter where"
"you cut the cells will very quickly grow"
"they will grow exactly what's needed to"
"make a normal axolotl in and then they"
"stop so this is a kind of example of"
"anatomical homeostasis they will"
"continue working from wherever starting"
"position until they get to the until"
"they get to where they're going"
"parenthetically this is not just for for"
"um for frogs and uh for you know acid"
"levels and worms um the human liver of"
"course is regenerative even the ancient"
"greeks knew that i have no idea how they"
"knew that but it seems like they did um"
"deer every year we generate massive"
"amounts of bone up to a centimeter and a"
"half of new bone per day"
"bone vasculature innervation skin and"
"even human children below a certain age"
"can regenerate their fingertips if you"
"just leave it alone it will basically"
"regrow cosmetically a very very nice"
"outcome so we have we have some some"
"ability to uh to to improve our position"
"in amorphous space"
"one of the most amazing things about it"
"is that"
"as as a as a body as a as a living"
"creature you can't count on your"
"environment you"
"can't count on in other words you can't"
"count on the environment being the same"
"as it was before you can't count on not"
"being perturbed during the developmental"
"process maybe physiologically maybe"
"metabolically maybe"
"with a parasite or a teratogen so you"
"can't count on that and you still need"
"to get your job done in fact you can't"
"even count on your own parts being what"
"you expected them to be now"
"uh of course"
"we don't have any machines that can do"
"this that can they can repair themselves"
"after damage or put themselves together"
"with diverse parts here this is this is"
"one of my uh favorite examples of all"
"time this is uh a cross-section through"
"a newt um"
"kidney tubule so so here's the lumen of"
"the tubule and these these are the cells"
"that make up the tubule normally it's"
"let's say around eight cells that work"
"together to form this kind of tubule one"
"thing you can do is you can you can make"
"uh you can make these cells what's"
"called polyploid which means they have"
"extra genetic material"
"amazing thing number one with the excess"
"genetic material you still get a"
"perfectly normal newton no problem that"
"there are all kinds of extra um"
"information around and no no no problem"
"but what does happen is that the cells"
"get much bigger and as the cells get"
"physically bigger fewer of them are"
"needed to make the exact same shape"
"lumen now that's that that's amazing"
"thing number two is that these cells the"
"number of these cells will actually"
"scale to their correct size so that you"
"all you get the same final outcome with"
"different numbers of cells but the most"
"amazing thing is that when you make"
"these cells absolutely gigantic so that"
"only one cell is big enough to make the"
"whole lumen what it will do is it will"
"no longer cooperate with other cells one"
"cell will bend around itself making uh"
"the exact same lumen okay now the"
"incredible thing about that is this is a"
"different molecular mechanism this was"
"cell to cell communication this is"
"cytoskeletal bending"
"and so what happens is that this is a"
"kind of a kind of top-down kind of"
"top-down causation"
"where in service of a large-scale"
"anatomical spec meaning having the"
"correct lumen you can call up different"
"molecular mechanisms to get the job done"
"so this again sticking with this this"
"theme of intelligence is the ability to"
"handle novelty in terms of getting to"
"where you're going from diverse starting"
"positions uh with perturbations both"
"external and internal you know your own"
"parts are getting are changing can you"
"still do what you need to do"
"and all of this is described in in some"
"of these papers uh and then and then the"
"final thing is that your your walk"
"through amorphous space doesn't even"
"have to be the same path so here for"
"example here's here's a frog frogs"
"normally do not regenerate their legs as"
"i'll tell you momentarily we have"
"figured out a way to make them"
"regenerate their legs and when they do"
"so this is a pretty good uh frog leg"
"regeneration you can see here it's got"
"the it's got the toes the toenails the"
"webbing i mean everything's good but in"
"fact the way it got here is not at all"
"how frogs normally regenerate their"
"limbs they normally develop their limbs"
"so normal frog limb morphogenesis is"
"here you make these things and then you"
"sort of make that you you kill off the"
"cells in the middle to make the pad of"
"the paddle"
"this is this grows in a completely"
"different way you've got the you've got"
"the middle this kind of middle stalk"
"here with the toenail and then the toes"
"sort of come off to the side it looks"
"much more like a plant so it takes a"
"different path through amorphous space"
"but it ends up in the same place so all"
"of this all of this is is is back to"
"illustrating some of these amazing"
"uh abilities of of these cells to um"
"to to to navigate and so one very kind"
"of very very canonical example of this"
"that we discovered a few years ago is is"
"this so here's a tadpole here's the gut"
"the brain the nostrils and the eyes here"
"this tadpole needs to become a frog in"
"order to for a tadpole face to be a frog"
face
"things have to move so the jaws have to"
"move the eyes have to move forward"
"everything has to move and it used to be"
"thought that this process was hardwired"
"because if you're a standard tadpole and"
"you want to be a standard frog all you"
"have to remember is which direction and"
"by how much every piece of the face"
moves
"what we did"
"and and we suspected that there was more"
"intelligence to this process than that"
"and so we did an experiment"
"we we created so-called picasso frogs"
"and so these are tadpoles in which"
"everything is messed up the eyes on the"
"side of the head the jaws are off to the"
side
"and the nostrils are too far back i mean"
"everything is in the wrong position and"
"we found that these animals still"
"largely make pretty normal frogs because"
"all of these pieces will move in novel"
"paths in fact sometimes they go too far"
"and have to double back to"
"give you a normal frog face so what the"
"genetics gives you is not some hardwired"
"system that always moves in the same way"
"what it specifies is a really"
"interesting error minimization machine"
"that uh however you start it off with"
"obviously with some limits"
"will try to minimize the error and get"
"to the correct final shape if we had a"
"robotic swarm uh a collection of robots"
"that was able to do this we would we"
"would call this a prize-winning example"
"of collective intelligence we don't have"
"such a such a technology yet"
"so uh so so we started trying to"
"understand this process how how does all"
"this work and so to this standard"
"feed-forward kind of open-loop process"
"of developmental biology that that you"
"that you would read about in in in"
"class where there are genes they make"
"proteins there's"
"some the proteins interact via some"
"physics and chemistry and then there's"
"this emergent outcome we add to this"
"these feedback loops whereby"
"this is actually a homeostatic system if"
"that if that"
"anatomy is disrupted in some way by"
"injury by by um"
"by injury by mutations by uh teratogens"
"by parasites whatever then these"
"feedback loops will kick in to try to"
"minimize error the cells will do what"
"they can to try to get back to the"
"correct shape it's a think of the thing"
"about your thermostat it's a basic"
"homeostatic circuit"
"now on the one hand"
"this is uh pretty pretty expected"
"biologists know all about feedback loops"
"um and and so on"
"on the other hand there are there are"
"two kind of weird weird and unusual"
"things here the first is that"
"every homeostatic process has to have a"
"set point so if you're going to"
"try to get back to uh where you need to"
"be you have to remember where the right"
"the where the right position is you have"
"to store a set point we're used to"
"thinking about scalars single numbers as"
"set points so temperature ph things like"
"that uh but in this case the set point"
"is a some sort of a large scale"
"geometry it's a it's a descriptor of"
"some kind of coarse grained descriptor"
"of an anatomy so it's a complex data"
"structure and in general"
"you know biologists don't love to think"
"about uh goal-directed processes the"
"idea is they're supposed to be emergence"
"and and kind of emergent complexity"
"but this idea that things are working"
"towards a goal the way that any"
"navigational system fundamentally does"
"is really not something that is is very"
"comfortable certainly for for molecular"
"biology so how would something like this"
"how would something like this work how"
"could we have a navigating"
"system that that"
"can uh can have goals in anatomical"
space
"and so here's where we start to think"
"about bioelectricity because our best"
"example of a"
"a mechanism that allows us to navigate"
"space towards goals is"
"the brain and in the brain we know"
"roughly what the architecture looks like"
"there are cells that"
"communicate with other cells in networks"
"these cells have ion channels so these"
"are little proteins that help set a"
"voltage to the cell and that voltage may"
"or may not be communicated to its"
"neighbors through these little gap"
"junctions these are like um like"
"electrical synapses that allow"
"electrical information to pass back and"
"forth and so so that's the hardware of"
"the brain and what that hardware enables"
"is a kind of software that among other"
"things navigate spaces so here's a"
zebrafish
"this is a movie uh taken by uh by by"
"this group uh here that shows all the"
"electrical activity in the living"
"zebrafish brain and so the commitment of"
"neuroscience is that if we understood"
"how to decode"
"this information we would be able to"
"know what the cognitive content of this"
"of this brain was so so the memories the"
"preferences the goals whatever else the"
"system was going to do we should be able"
"to decode it so this is this is that"
"cycle that's called neural neural"
"decoding right we should be able to"
"understand what what all these patterns"
"mean well it turns out"
"that uh"
"this is not just for brains this is an"
"extremely ancient system"
"all the cells in your body have ion"
"channels most cells have gap junctions"
"with each other and what we might be"
"able to do is just like neuroscientists"
"we might be able to extend this whole"
"scheme to ask what are your tissues"
"thinking about at any point in time"
"specifically to read the electrical so"
"this is a this is a time lapse of an"
"early frog embryo the colors are a"
"fluorescent dye reporting voltage the"
"same way that we did here that"
"was done here with these with the"
"zebrafish uh and uh you we might be able"
"to decode this information to ask"
"what are the targets in anatomical"
"amorphous space what is this thing going"
"to build"
"and so there's this there's this amazing"
"uh isomorphism between the story of the"
"brain where you've got you've got the"
"the hardware and the software and"
"there's various experiences and various"
"other ways that this software gets"
"modified um the hardware basically only"
"just gets built by in development and"
"what what the brain does is it controls"
"muscles to move your body in"
"three-dimensional space now that's a"
"pretty cool trick where did it learn"
"this trick well evolutionarily this is"
"exactly the same as something that was"
"going on long before brains appeared"
"which is this exact same system but it"
"used to be for moving the body"
"configuration in morphospace before"
"there were nerves and muscles"
"um cells needed to talk to each other"
"and process information to get around in"
"amorphous space and so uh"
"we've argued in this in this paper that"
"basically uh neural neural electricity"
"is just an evolutionary pivot across"
"spaces from amorphous space to"
"three-dimensional space of a very uh"
"very ancient system for"
"processing information long before"
"brains arose so so in my group we then"
"we we were thinking about this and we"
"asked this question okay if that's if"
"that's if that's uh how it works could"
"we make some tools to read and write"
"this electrical information and to"
"really understand how it's navigating"
"that uh that that shape change space so"
"we developed the some of the first tools"
"to um uh read and write information into"
"non-brain tissues so of course these"
"dyes so these are voltage-sensitive"
"fluorescent dyes that"
"report all the electrical conversations"
"that these cells are having with each"
"other so here's a time lapse of these"
"cells figuring out who's going to be"
"left right dorsal ventral so so all of"
"this is is uh you're looking at these"
"cells having those conversations"
"we do a lot of computational modeling to"
"ask okay given where the ions are going"
"how can we predict these voltages i'm"
"going to show you two patterns"
"here's a here's a time lapse it happens"
"to be gray scale but it's the exact same"
idea
"here's a time lapse of a frog embryo"
"putting its face together"
"and what you will see and this is this"
"is one frame out of that video what you"
"will see is that this is uh this is"
"something we call the electric face"
"discovered by my colleague danny adams"
um
"when she was in my group doing this"
profiling
"she found that at uh here's here's a"
"particular frame from that uh from that"
"video where you can see the the animal's"
"right eye the mouth the uh the the"
"placards all of this is already"
"demarcated uh before the genes start to"
"come on and really pattern the face this"
"is a bioelectric pre-pattern of what the"
"future face is going to look like and"
"i'm showing you this one because it's so"
"simple it literally looks like a face"
"right there are other patterns that are"
"much more complex that you can't really"
"just you know sort of visually decode"
"but this one is very it's very clear"
"this is the memory of what a"
"tadpole face is going to look like and"
"if you move this uh if you if you"
"disrupt this electrical pattern the gene"
"expression will change and the"
"organogenesis will change um"
"and uh we'll i'll show you the"
"show you examples of that momentarily so"
"so this is a this is a uh an endogenous"
"pattern that is required for normal"
"development in fact human"
"channelopathies of the"
"human patients that have craniofacial"
"defects often have mutations in ion"
"channels that screw up this pattern now"
"that's so that's a normal pattern here's"
"a pathological pattern"
"we've put in a human oncogene uh these"
"cells will make a tumor but even before"
"the tumor becomes apparent you can"
"already see this bioelectrical aberrant"
"bioelectrical signature of these cells"
"basically disconnecting from the rest of"
"the tissue and going to their"
"unicellular ancient behavior mode where"
"the rest of the body is just environment"
"as far as they're concerned so so so one"
"one set of tools is to track these"
"bioelectrical changes now here's another"
"important set of tools"
"to actually start to be able to uh to"
"write new information into it and the"
"way we do that we don't use any applied"
"electric fields there are no waves there"
"are no magnets there's no"
"electromagnetic radiation what we do is"
"we do exactly what neuroscientists do"
"which is we"
"modify uh the endogenous mechanisms by"
"which cells establish electrical signals"
"so either ion channels we can open them"
"we can close them we can use light to"
"our drugs to do that"
"and in the gap junctions the the"
"electrical synapses so we can determine"
"which cells talk to each other cells by"
"opening and closing these little gap"
"junctions it's very telling that all of"
"the tools of neuroscience work in other"
"cell types basically the tools can't"
"tell the difference right this"
"distinction between neuroscience and and"
"other cells in your body is completely"
"artificial and it's you know it's a"
"consequence of humans trying to parse"
"the world it's not um nature doesn't"
"doesn't obey that distinction"
"so what can you do with this okay i've"
"been talking about these this electrical"
"information what what what does it"
"actually do well here's here's a here"
"are a few examples"
"one thing you can do is you can take"
"this this tadpole and i've shown you the"
"electric face and so we asked the"
"question okay if now that we know that"
"there's a particular voltage state that"
"kickstarts eye development could we"
"simply reproduce that somewhere else so"
"we took an ion channel rna that we knew"
"was gonna set the same voltage state we"
"injected it into precursor cells that"
"are going to give rise to the gut and"
"sure enough those cells can form a"
"complete eye they uh the eyes that are"
"formed will have all the right uh layers"
"uh retina nerve you know optic nerve all"
that
"lens and uh and and they can be formed"
"anywhere they can be formed anywhere"
"anywhere in the body as long as the"
"cells get the right pattern that tells"
"them what organ to make now notice two"
"very interesting things here one is that"
"this instruction is highly modular we"
"provided a very small piece of"
"information just a voltage pattern we"
"certainly did not give it all the"
"information needed to specify an eye"
"eyes have many cell types um they're"
"very complex there's no we have no idea"
"how to micromanage the creation of an"
"eye but what we provided was a"
"kind of a subroutine call us a signal"
"that says build an eye here and the"
"cells do that's the first thing the"
"second amazing thing is that"
"there are two levels of instruction here"
"one is us instructing the cells build an"
"eye but here what you can see is this is"
"a lens sitting out in the flank of a"
"of a"
"tadpole somewhere and the blue cells are"
"the ones that carry this ion channel"
"that we put in but there's not enough of"
"them to make a good lens so what they've"
"done is recruit their neighbors this is"
"why at the very beginning i pitched this"
"idea that frogolottles might have legs"
"that consist also of of of frog cells"
"why would frog cells build a leg when"
"when they normally don't it's because"
"cells have the ability to instruct each"
"other about what to build and so these"
"cells right here they've been told to"
"make an eye but there's not enough of"
"them and they know that and so they they"
"recruit a bunch of their neighbors these"
"brown cells that we never touched"
"they're not these cells are completely"
"wild type and yet"
"they're participating in making this"
"ectopic lens out in the tail of a tackle"
"so so there's this amazing ability to to"
"instruct and for the cells to then"
"instruct each other now what else can we"
"make well"
"we can make using the same methodology"
"by manipulating these ion channels we"
"can make otocysts which are balance"
"organs like inner ear type of organs"
"we can make complete beating hearts so"
"ectopic heart we can make extra"
"forebrain and then you can see you can"
"ask if these animals are any smarter"
"than the normal tadpoles we can make"
"ectopic limbs so you can see here all"
"kinds of extra extra legs that we can"
"form and we can even make fins now this"
"last one is kind of weird because"
"tadpoles of course aren't supposed to"
"have fins we'll get to that momentarily"
"but what you can see is that by changing"
"the bi-electrical pattern using using a"
"manipulation of ion channels you can"
"tell this collective"
"where to go in morphospace meaning what"
"types of organs they should be building"
"you're not micromanaging the specifics"
"each step that they take they figure"
"that out on their own in fact we have no"
"idea how to how to do that for any of"
"these complex organs but you can you can"
"indicate regions about where it is that"
"they should be going and this has has"
"biomedical implications so"
"frogs i told you unlike salamanders do"
"not regenerate their legs so if a leg is"
"amputated 45 days later there's nothing"
"what we've done is come up with a drug"
"cocktail that targets ion channels that"
"um induces leg regeneration and so you"
"can see here 45 days later there's"
"already a nice a nice leg forming the"
"leg is touch sensitive it's motile it's"
"it's functional it has a pretty good"
"eventually it has a pretty good uh final"
"a final pattern and so we're in the"
"process of uh"
"translating that to mammals hopefully"
"this will work i have to do a disclosure"
"here because this is a commercial"
"venture now morphoceuticals inc is a"
"spin-off between myself and dave kaplan"
"where uh"
"david's lab makes these bioreactors that"
"uh provide that have an aqueous"
"environment for the wound and then we"
"provide the ion channel and other types"
"of payload in there to hopefully get leg"
"regeneration in mammals so this is a"
"clinically kind you know clinically"
"relevant approach"
"so i want to switch from this now to"
"show you another kind of amazing example"
of
"what bioelectricity does"
"this is these are planarium so so i've"
"already told you they they have"
"incredible amounts of"
"regenerative ability because of that"
"they're actually immortal there's no"
"such thing as an old planarian they do"
"not age so"
"these animals pretty much go on forever"
"uh and uh and and that's because of this"
"incredible ability to continuously"
"replenish and regenerate to keep their"
"keep their pattern perfect so i want to"
"show you i want to show you an example"
"this is this is a planarian one head one"
"tail you cut off the head and the tail"
"you got this middle fragment uh"
"we check we check the the gene"
"expression yep anterior genes are in the"
"head no anterior genes in the tail"
"that's fine and 100 of the time it makes"
"this normal offspring so so one head one"
"tail okay this it regenerates now"
"here what i'm going to show you is that"
"uh here here's this here's a planarian"
"one head one tail"
"again anterior genes where they're"
"supposed to be but when i cut this guy"
"he makes a two-headed form i just told"
"you that this process was very reliable"
"why in the world would a one-headed"
"animal make a two-headed uh and this"
"isn't photoshop these are real you know"
"real live animals so here are heads at"
"both ends well it's because in the"
"meantime we found that there's an"
"electrical circuit that actually helps"
"this tissue remember how many heads"
"they're supposed to be and what you can"
"do in the meantime"
"is take this one-headed animal and you"
"can look at the electrical pattern ah"
"the electrical pattern says one one head"
"one tail and we can alter that"
"electrical pattern to say no you're"
"gonna be you a proper worm should have"
"two heads now you can see it's kind of a"
"mess the technology is still being"
"worked out but but but it's very clear"
"we can we can we can impose this pattern"
"that says two heads and when you cut"
"that animal boom that's what the cells"
"make now this is really critical to"
"understand this bioelectric pattern is"
"not a map of this two-headed guy this"
"bioelectrical pattern is a map of this"
"one-headed animal into which we incepted"
"a false memory of what planaria are"
"supposed to look like and they sit there"
"this memory sits there late in to do"
"doing nothing until you injure them once"
"you injure this animal that is when they"
"will the cells will pay attention to"
"this pattern and they will go ahead and"
"make a two-headed animal so if you're"
"wondering where counterfactual um where"
"the ability to consider counterfactuals"
"came from this kind of mental time"
"travel where you can"
"consider uh"
"things that have memories and have"
"predictions about things that are not"
"happening right now"
"this is perhaps the uh the sort of"
basal
"precursor of that ability in morphospace"
"this this animal has a representation in"
"morphospace of where it will go if it"
"gets injured at a future time not what's"
"happening right now that's not this is"
"not where i am right now this is where"
"i'm going to go if i get injured now why"
"do i keep calling this thing in memory i"
"keep calling it a memory because"
"if you take these two-headed animals and"
"simply re-cut them again in plain water"
"no more manipulations of any kind uh"
"they will continue to reason to rebuild"
"two-headed animals and forever as far as"
"we can tell the the the question of how"
"many heads a planarian has is not"
"strictly determined by the genome"
"because we didn't touch the genome the"
"genome is wild type there's nothing"
"there's no genomic editing here the the"
"that information is sitting in an"
"electric circuit the default the"
"genetically set default is one head but"
"it's easily changed and in fact we can"
"now well now as i say it's easy it took"
"us 10 years to you know to figure it out"
"but but in fact it's it's quite readily"
"done and in fact you can uh you can set"
"it back you can set it back to being"
"one-headed by again targeting the"
"information in that electrical circuit"
um
"the first time uh i showed i showed"
"these data somebody stood up at a"
"conference and said well that's"
"impossible those animals can't exist so"
"i always bring this video so everybody"
"can see what uh what the second and"
"third generation of these guys look like"
"uh so so this this has all the"
"properties of memory it's long-term"
"stable it's rewritable it's got a little"
"bit of lability so it's rewritable it's"
"got latency or conditional recall so you"
"can have a single body can have memories"
"of what a planarian is supposed to look"
"like that aren't true right now and it"
"has discrete possible outcomes so one of"
"the things that we're doing"
"now is is really trying to integrate"
"models of the physiological state space"
"of of this animal that where where the"
"circuit the electrical circuit has has a"
"state space where there are attractors"
"that correspond to one heads two heads"
"no heads and so on and merge that with"
"uh models of connectionist artificial"
"neural network type of"
"processes where where we already know"
"how to build networks that for example"
"do pattern completion and they have a"
"memory of what the pattern should be and"
"if part of that part of that pattern is"
"missing they can reproduce it and so on"
"this is all this is all part of one"
"problem and and the key is tying it all"
"together in uh with with these"
"quantitative models that show how this"
"electrical circuit navigates morph space"
"now what i've shown you is that you can"
"tweak that electrical circuit to find an"
"attractor that has two heads instead of"
"one heads but what else is there what"
"else does this space actually have let's"
"explore that a little bit"
"well the first thing you find is that"
"well it contains head shapes of other"
"species so what you can do is you can"
"take this planarian cut off the head"
"perturb the electrical circuit for about"
"48 hours then let them let it go"
"and when it finally settles down into"
"the correct attractor it doesn't always"
"find the right one so some percentage of"
"time it goes back to normal and makes"
"this nice triangular head from uh d"
"dorado dratocephala but sometimes it'll"
"make a round head like this s"
"mediterranean sometimes it'll make a"
"flathead like this p felina in fact this"
"is a stochastic process the frequency of"
"these uh is proportional to the"
"evolutionary distance between the real"
um
uh
"the real species that are being mimicked"
"here and again no changes to the genome"
"there's nothing genetically wrong with"
"these animals but you can you can find"
"these other attractors and it's not just"
"for head shape it's the shape of the"
brain
"the distribution of the stem cells"
"become just like these other species and"
"it's about they're about 100 to 150"
"million years distant okay so so you can"
"find those attractors with the exact"
"same genetics"
"in fact you can find shapes that uh"
"don't that that don't correspond to any"
"real planarian as far as we know"
"you can make these crazy uh spiky forms"
"you can make a different uh symmetry"
"type so this kind of cylindrical radial"
"symmetry instead of a flat bilateral"
"symmetry you can make combinations uh"
"where where there's a flat worm with a"
"big tube growing out into the third"
"dimension and again nothing wrong with"
"the hardware there's no no no mutations"
"another one with the genome"
"it's exploring the it's bioelectrically"
"exploring the space of where it can be"
"and so"
"the idea is what we're doing now is is"
"building these"
uh
"kind of full stack models that try to"
"integrate all the way from the molecular"
"information about what channels do you"
"have to work with so the hardware all"
"the way up through the physiology of"
"okay well what does this mean for the"
"voltage states across the tissue to well"
"what does that mean for the identity of"
"different organs along the primary axis"
"to what kind of algorithm is this whole"
thing
"is this whole thing"
"implementing such that we could actually"
"understand the algorithm and intervene"
"right so so make right make changes and"
"for this we have"
"we have all kinds of computational"
"platforms such as such as this which"
"allows you to load up electrical"
"circuits into cells and then"
"simulate to simulate tissue and organ"
"level dynamics to understand what the"
"large scale computations are"
"and so so just as a simple example again"
"of of why this is why this is useful and"
"what the what the practical implications"
"of this are we use this the strategy to"
"find a a technique for repairing birth"
"defects so here's a tadpole here's the"
"forebrain midbrain and hindbrain if it's"
"exposed to nicotine or various other"
"teratogens you can see there's massive"
"defects so the the brain is basically"
"gone um"
"the forebrain is basically gone the"
"midbrain and high brain are damaged and"
"so what we did is we built this this"
"bioelectrical model that tries to"
"explain how does the brain know what its"
"size and shape should be and in cases"
"where for example here this is even"
"worse than a teratogen we mutated a key"
"neurogenesis gene this is a gene called"
"notch so this gene is mutated you can"
"see the forebrain is just gone the"
"midbrain and hindbrain or a bubble these"
"animals have no behavior they just lay"
"there doing nothing it's a very strong"
"defect what we found what we did was we"
"asked that model"
"um which ion channels would we have to"
"open and close to get back to the"
"correct bioelectrical memory of what a"
"what a correct brain should be basically"
"how do i find my way back in morpha"
"space to what a correct brain should be"
"and the model made a prediction we"
"tested that prediction it happens to be"
"a an already human approved"
"set of drugs that can do this and sure"
"enough when we did it there there you go"
"uh they they their brain structure comes"
"back their brain um gene expression"
"comes back and their iq comes back so if"
"you actually test them for their"
"learning rates they're indistinguishable"
"from controls even though they've been"
"exposed to teradogins or they have this"
"really nasty genetic defect some"
"problems and not all problems but some"
"problems can be fixed at the level of"
"software sometimes when your hardware"
"isn't quite right you can make up for it"
"in in software by having a better"
"navigation policy through morph of space"
"so you're not dead and you're not"
"automatically dead in the water if your"
"hardware is a little wonky"
"so what that means is"
"uh we ought to be able to create these"
"pipelines to"
"uh to and we've already we've already"
started
"to help design electroceuticals that is"
"you have some particular problem and you"
"can ask the simulation what type of"
"channel meaning what drug can i use to"
"get back to my correct bioelectrical"
"pattern fundamentally this is really the"
"the the question of how do we exploit"
"this electrical interface that these"
"cells are"
"exposing to us right just like neurons"
"do and people using um electrodes and"
"optogenetics and everything else to"
"control brains using this electrical"
"interface we can do exactly the same"
"thing to help guide their navigation"
"through morphospace it's a it's a new"
"way of to think about getting making"
"drugs for uh various disorders of"
"development of injury and cancer and so"
"on okay so so i want to just just say a"
"couple of things uh before i wrap up"
"here i want to say a couple of things"
"about uh"
"the scaling of cognition in this whole"
"in this whole business and then show you"
"some some novel synthetic living"
"machines so the first thing i want to"
"point out is that we've been i i started"
"out by saying that"
"thinking about fixed uh standard animals"
"is is kind of limiting and that's"
because
the
"border between self and world is is is"
"flexible it can change so so again here"
"is a and and what what unifies all all"
"of these different kinds of weird"
"intelligences are solving problems in"
"morphospace and physiological space and"
"so on is their ability to pursue goals"
"meaning to pursue the right region of"
"that morphospace so this kind of"
"creature a single cell can have pretty"
"humble little tiny goals right so so on"
"the scale of some number of microns it"
"can it can pursue uh state physiological"
"states whole metabolic states and so on"
"but these cells can cooperate and when"
"they go up when they cooperate they can"
"pursue very large goals so building a"
"limb is a huge goal not no individual"
"cell knows what a limb is or can count"
"fingers or anything like that but the"
"collective sure can the collective will"
"absolutely pursue this particular region"
"of morphospace despite all kinds of"
"perturbations and when does it stop it"
"stops when it when it reaches that area"
"so when it gets to where it's going and"
"the limb is correct that's when it stops"
"so there's a scaling of goals here now"
"that happens during evolution"
"and as you enjoy you'll as you'll see in"
"a minute it also can can happen right in"
"front of your eyes but the reverse"
"process we're quite familiar with and"
"that's cancer so these here are"
"glioblastoma cells human glioblastoma"
"cells in culture"
"cells can defect from this uh kind of um"
"from this kind of situation once they"
"electrically isolate from their"
neighbors
"then as far as they're concerned they're"
"back to they're back to this scenario"
"the the rest of the body is just"
"external environment to them their their"
"goals are little tiny goals what are the"
"goals of single cell systems well for"
"every cell wants to become two cells and"
"it wants to go wherever life is good and"
"that's metastasis and so that process"
"that's shrinking and growing in fact uh"
"these cancer cells are not any more"
"selfish than your normal body cells it's"
"just that the self is smaller right a"
"lot of a lot of work in um game theory"
"of cancer talks about selfishness and"
"lack of cooperation they're not any more"
"selfish it's just that the the self"
"towards which they work is just little"
"little tiny itself is very small whereas"
"here the electrical network is able to"
"bind and if people want i have all sorts"
"of stories about what exactly happens"
"when they bind together but i'll"
"skip that for now for for reasons of"
"time um when when individual cells bind"
"into networks those networks have a"
"greater ability to uh to store memory to"
"have anticipation of future events to"
"perceive spatial uh spatial kinds of"
"signals in their environment and so the"
scale
grows
and
"the uh the biomedical implication of"
"this is that if this were if this were"
"true you should be able to reverse"
"cancer by"
"artificially reconnecting cells to their"
"neighbors in fact that's what we've"
"that's what we've done so so when you"
"have this this nasty oncogene you can"
"see that in red it's still here you can"
"prevent the tumor from happening by"
"putting in an ion channel that forces"
"these cells to remain in the right"
"bioelectrical state despite the fact"
"that the oncogene is trying to"
"disassociate them and if you do that the"
"physiology trumps the genetics that will"
"it will these cells will remain even"
"though the oncogene is strongly"
"expressed the cells will remain"
"uh making nice muscle and skin and"
"whatever else it's supposed to make so"
"so this this this idea of of looking at"
"the scaling of the self and the scaling"
"of these goals has real uh practical uh"
"implications and in in my in my model"
"one of the things that um it allows the"
"framework to do is to compare directly"
"very diverse intelligences so any"
"intelligence be it evolved designed uh"
"some sort of hybrid some sort of alien"
"thing and maybe soft pure software it"
"doesn't matter any agent has a set that"
"can pursue goals you can simply plot the"
"size of those goals so so how big are"
"they in space and time right you might"
have
"you might have a tick that only cares"
"about local butyrate concentration and"
"that's all that it's ever going to care"
"about and so it has a tiny little um"
"cognitive light cone that allows it to"
"pursue these tiny little goals anymore"
"you might have a dog which has a bigger"
"cognitive light cone and has some pretty"
"good memory going backwards has a little"
"bit of anticipation potential forwards"
"it's never going to care about what"
"happens two towns over three months from"
"now it's impossible that its goal space"
"is simply not that big right and then"
"you can have humans which"
"uniquely perhaps have uh have a"
"cognitive like cone that's bigger than"
"their own lifespan so the the human can"
"comprehend and pursue goals that are"
"that are guaranteed not achievable in"
"your lifetime and that for all i know"
"that may drive some interesting"
"psychological pressures that humans face"
but
"this idea that that we are all made of a"
"collective of agents each of these"
"agents is solving problems in its own"
"space and within that space there are"
"differently scaled goals some some very"
very
"very modest and some some some massive"
"you know some humans are working for"
"world peace and and you know these kinds"
"of very complex very large long-term"
"things so the idea is that in this"
"multi-scale system what happens is that"
"higher levels bend the option space for"
"their subunits so"
"so so in uh if if you've got a"
"morphogenetic space that that uh that"
"that has attractors for different head"
"shapes that's because those those"
"bioelectrical states"
"distort the the space of gene expression"
"for their cells such that all the cells"
"need to do is go down their"
"concentration gradients the way they"
"normally do they don't have to know"
"where they're going but in fact they end"
"up at a very particular morphological um"
"outcome because because the higher level"
"has already distorted that space and so"
"there are all kinds of interesting work"
"to be done looking at mathematical"
"formalisms from relativity theory and"
"and from some other"
"disciplines to look at how and how that"
"works and in fact all that's happening"
"here is the scaling up of goals so once"
"you have a single cell that can do this"
"cycle this this test measure act uh test"
"compare act kind of cycle let's say for"
"example for keeping ph once you start"
"connecting cells into electrical"
networks
"now everything scales up their goals are"
"bigger their memories are bigger the the"
"ability to act are bigger this is what"
"evolution is is doing it's constantly"
"scaling up these these homeostatic units"
"and it's actually uh pivoting them"
"through different spaces so very simple"
"kinds of organisms"
"uh all they could do is traverse"
"metabolic space to keep alive but"
"eventually that works up to"
"physiological spaces then gene"
"expression becomes a thing and so they"
"can work in transcriptional spaces then"
"multi uh the complex anatomy so it's"
"amorphous space and eventually when"
"brains and muscles show up you're in"
"behavioral space and who knows what"
"other spaces there are linguistically"
"and there may be many others so just to"
"close off in the last few minutes um"
"i want to i want to show you an example"
"of novelty uh so i've been i've been"
"talking about intelligence and the idea"
that
"um these uh all of these different uh"
"different systems are able to handle"
"novel conditions i wanna show you an"
"extreme example of that so"
"this is uh this is worked at uh joshua"
"bongard's lab and and we are doing in uh"
"in in this new institute and we wanted"
"to ask a simple question uh well a set"
"of questions one is"
"how much how much real-time plasticity"
"really is there i mean we've seen that"
"you can get you can get pretty far away"
"from the genomic default but what what"
"else can these cells do and in fact when"
"we look at development normal"
"development to what extent is it is it"
"fooling us what extent are we basically"
"lulled into thinking that because"
"acorns make oak trees and frog eggs make"
"make frogs to what extent are we really"
"fooled into thinking that that's"
"basically all that they can do and so we"
"started asking about you know what"
"what might the default competencies of"
"some of these cells and tissues be okay"
"and so so what we did was was was this"
"simple experiment i'm just going to uh"
"pause oops i'm going to pause this here"
"what we did was uh a simple experiment"
"where um"
"and this all the biology was done by"
"doug blackiston um in my group in the in"
"the computer science you're about to see"
"was done by"
"sam kriegman um what we did was we took"
"some skin cells off of a frog embryo and"
"we put those skin cells by themselves in"
"a dish so we didn't add anything there"
"are no nano materials there are no"
"genetic circuits being added there are"
"no weird transgenes or chemicals what we"
"do is subtract what do we subtract we"
"subtract all this other stuff we"
"subtract all their normal neighbors that"
"are normally uh instructing these cells"
"as to what to do we give them a chance"
"to reboot their multicellularity now"
"there's all sorts of things they could"
"do so so they could just go and die they"
"could spread out and get away from each"
"other they could form a flat two two"
"dimensional monolayer the way that cell"
"culture does there are many things that"
"that could happen and so so here's what"
"happens we um"
"we dissociate these cells we put them in"
"this little little depression well"
"overnight they sort of come together"
"like this and then they form this little"
"round ball this the the flashes you're"
"seeing is calcium signaling so it's a"
"calcium sensitive dye it um"
"you they they start to sort of signal to"
"each other and what they form is"
"something we call xenobots now why"
"xenobots because xenopus lavis is the"
"name of the frog and uh and it's a bio"
"robotics platform so the way it's the"
"way they're they're swimming is they"
"have little hairs on their surface these"
"hairs called cilia are normally used to"
"redistribute mucus on them across the"
"body of the frog"
"here what they've done is they've sort"
"of they've learned to row and so and so"
"the cells the the cilia are moving and"
"this thing is propelling itself they can"
"go in circles they can go straight back"
"and forth like this uh here you can see"
"a bunch of them in their various this is"
"just tracking data so so these two are"
"interacting these are sitting there"
"doing nothing this one's going on kind"
"of a longer journey"
"here here's one navigating a maze this"
"is still water there's no water movement"
"in here"
"so it moves along it takes the corner"
"without bumping into the opposite wall"
"and then at some point for reasons that"
"nobody nobody can predict yet it decides"
"to turn around and go back where it came"
"from so it again goes along does not"
"need to bump into anything to know that"
"it could take a corner here and then at"
"this point"
"turns around turns around and goes and"
"goes back okay"
now
"one of the things you can see with this"
"calcium signaling is that they're very"
"active this looks very brain-like this"
"looks very similar to that zebrafish"
"kind of signaling that i showed you"
"before except there's no neurons here"
"this is just skin everything that you"
"just saw was 100 skin cells there's no"
"there's no brain there's no nervous"
"system and so not only uh you know so so"
"who knows we're still experimenting with"
"like what what might they be saying to"
"each other when they're when they're"
"doing this but one thing you could you"
"can see they do a couple of interesting"
"things one thing they can do is"
"regenerate so here's here's one that was"
"basically cut in half and now think"
"about think about the force look at that"
"hinge as it as it folds up think about"
"the the force that it takes to to to"
"clamp something shut from 180 degree"
"position but it basically folds up right"
"to be um"
"back to its uh to its zenobot shape and"
"one of the things we started thinking"
"about is how can we how can we predict"
"what this kind of system is going to do"
"i mean nobody knew what what they were"
"going to do so so josh vanguard's lab"
started
"modeling their their behavior in this"
"kind of simulation the simulation can"
"actually tell you what the behavior of"
"different shaped bots is going to be and"
"then you can go ahead and micro sculpt"
"them or do various things you can see"
"the patterns that this is just a carmine"
"powder on the bottom of the dish and"
"these guys sweep it along as they go so"
"you can see all the cool patterns that"
"they make as they're"
navigating
"but but here's something here's"
"something interesting if you if you"
"simulate them in an environment with a"
"bunch of loose bricks what you see is"
"that they tend to they tend to collect"
"them into little piles and so what what"
"might be the significance of that well"
"it turns out the real bots do exactly"
that
"and if you provide them so these are"
"xenobots provided with a bunch of loose"
"skin cells so these white dots are just"
"loose skin cells hanging on and what"
"you'll see is that these the the"
"xenobots will run around they will"
"collect either together or individually"
"they'll make little piles"
"and because this is an a gentle material"
"right these cells are not passive they"
"once the cells are collected into a pile"
"what do they make they make xenobots so"
"this is kinematic self-replication these"
"pots make copies of themselves from the"
"loose material in the dish"
"we've made it impossible for them to"
"replicate the way that normally frogs"
"reproduce so they can't do that but"
"within 48 hours they show us that"
"there's another way to do this that as"
"far as we know no other animal uses"
"it's basically von neumann's dream which"
"is machines that will go out and build"
"copies of themselves from parts that"
"they find laying around that's what's"
"going on here these zenobots build the"
"next generation of zenobots out of these"
"loose cells when those mature guess what"
"they do they run around do exactly the"
"same thing you get the next generation"
"and then the next generation after that"
now
"there's no strong heredity here yet um"
"as far as we know but uh and the reason"
"it works is really critical the reason"
"it works is the exact same reason that"
"we were able to make xenobots in the"
"first place because these cells are not"
"passive legos they are in a gentle"
"material that once they get together in"
"a particular group they know what to do"
"they they have an innate preference to"
"to make bots that's that's why these"
"bots are able to make new bots"
"so uh"
"here's the uh here's kind of the amazing"
"thing about it is that um same genome so"
"if you were to sequence the xenobot all"
"you would ever see is the xenopus lavas"
"genome you'd have no idea that it was"
"any different that same genome can do at"
"least two different uh life histories it"
"can do this so is that so normal normal"
"xenopus um uh uh"
"stages and the normal tadpole behavior"
"or it can do this so here's an early"
"xenobot here's a zen about at about two"
"months it has a developmental sequence"
"it's turning into something what is that"
"i have no idea what that is there's"
"never been there's never been any"
"zenobots before so it's some kind of"
"novel uh novel a developmental stage and"
"eventually they they have these these"
"kinds of behaviors"
"so we're still working out we don't know"
"how much cognition they actually have"
"can they do can they learn can they uh"
"they have preferences what do they react"
"to we don't know we're still figuring"
"that out but the amazing thing about it"
"is that uh"
"for for most animals the way they"
"navigate both physical and anatomical"
"space when you ask you know why do they"
"have a certain number of legs a certain"
"color certain behaviors so the answer is"
"always well because for millions of"
"years the ancestors were selected for"
"this or that and everybody else died off"
"and now this is what you have well"
"there's never been any zenobots and"
"there's never been selection to be a"
"good xenobot all of this is created on"
"the fly this is this is what they do"
"they create a coherent"
"organism and by the way if you ask what"
"do skin cells normally want to do you"
"might think that what they normally want"
"to do is to be this like passive"
"two-dimensional layer on the outside of"
"an animal to keep out the bacteria that"
"isn't what they want to do what that's"
"what they're bullied into doing by the"
"instructive interactions with the rest"
"of the cells if you don't have those"
"cells this is what they're actually this"
"is their default this is actually their"
"default behavior so what evolution does"
"is what bioengineers can and will be"
"doing is behavior shaping it's figuring"
"out signals to get your agential"
"material not passive not a blank slate"
"but you're a general material to do"
"whatever you want to do so i'm just"
"going to um"
"close up here with with a couple of uh"
"thoughts this is uh this is just a a"
"kind of a an overview of this of this"
"framework that that we've been working"
"on this kind of um continuum of agency"
"across very diverse uh implementations"
"the idea of of scaling of the boundaries"
"of goals for any particular system as a"
"way to compare radically different types"
"of intelligences in different spaces uh"
"bioelectricity is a particular example"
"not the only one i'm sure there are"
"other ways to tell the story but"
"bioelectricity is a really great way to"
"look at"
"what is the what is the cognitive medium"
"of a collective intelligence and it"
"seems to be electricity in many cases um"
"and there are all kinds of implications"
"for for evolution including asking"
"questions about where do these goals"
"come from if it's not just selection"
"where in fact do they come from and so"
"just to finish up i want to point out"
that
"one of the consequences of the fact that"
"biology can solve problems on the fly"
"and that it's incredibly interoperable"
"is that pretty much any combination of"
"evolved material meaning cells or"
"tissues or genes"
"design materials so smart nano materials"
"all kinds of constructs and and software"
"any combination of these is some viable"
"creature and so when darwin said endless"
"forms most beautiful impressive being"
"impressed with a variety of biology that"
"he was seeing around that's just all of"
"that everything on earth is a tiny"
"corner of this incredibly huge option"
"space which we're already beginning to"
"explore so there are already cyborgs you"
"know humans with various implants both"
"sensory and um and effectors"
"people can run wheelchairs with their"
"minds and have all kinds of sensors"
"attached to them"
"hybrids which are brains"
"driving vehicles instead of biological"
bodies
"people started a long time ago making"
"making chimeras so so mules right horses"
"and donkeys make mules so so you can"
"start to mix genetic material after that"
"people would make grafts and plants and"
"may and mix at the cellular level"
"every combination we are going to be"
"living in a world where we are"
"surrounded by agents"
"that don't look like anything familiar"
"on the phylogenetic tree and this means"
"that we have massive implications for"
"systems of ethics because the old"
"traditional framework where you look at"
"something and you ask where did it come"
"from would you come from a factory or"
"was it was it natural and what does it"
"look like does it look like a fish an"
"ape or a human or you know or something"
else
"those kinds of touchstones are going to"
"be completely useless in uh deciding how"
"to relate to these beings that are going"
"to be around us in terms of what do we"
"owe them what do what what can we expect"
"of them all of these things we can we're"
"not going to be able to rely on familiar"
"categories of where did it come from and"
"how much like a like a human does it you"
"know does it look that's going to be"
"gone so those things will not survive"
"the next few decades so we are going to"
"need to develop novel frameworks because"
"life is so good at navigating these"
"spaces that all of these things are"
"going to be viable so i'll just close by"
"saying that"
"um all of this is discussed in great"
"detail in various papers anybody uh just"
"please email me and i'll send you"
everything
"i want to thank the the various uh"
"intelligent beings that contributed to"
"all the work i showed you so all of our"
"postdocs uh phd students um the model"
"systems that we work with they do all"
"the heavy lifting all the all the slime"
"molds and the plenary and the tackles"
"and everything else"
"and of course our funders and again uh"
"just two disclosures so morphaceuticals"
"is a company around limb regeneration"
"and fauna systems is a company for um"
"zenobots and that's it uh thank you so"
"much thank you for listening"
"thank you very much uh michael levin uh"
"this was incredibly fascinating and uh"
"very comprehensive uh talk"
"um so"
"if anybody wants to ask any questions uh"
"feel free to do the raised hand signal"
"or put them in the chat"
"but i guess in the meantime i'll ask one"
"of my own questions while we get uh some"
"questions from the audience here"
um
"so uh"
michael
"do you think there is any promise in"
"trying to come up with uh"
"a purely mathematically deductive"
"framework for biology like a logic or an"
"algebra to explain how an organism"
"develops and"
"you know perhaps ignore traditional"
"explanations like"
"evolutionary history and natural"
"selection as a cultural deciding force"
"so something like uh like the axiomatic"
"framework in euclid's geometry or maybe"
"the formal grammars behind"
"cellular automata or linden meyer"
systems
"because this this might uh set like the"
"logical foundations for a potential"
"anatomical compiler"
"yeah i i think the closest thing to that"
"that i know of is active inference so"
"and and i'm far from a mathematician so"
"this is this is something that uh my"
"colleague chris fields and carl fristen"
"work you know we've done some work"
"together on this and they they do all"
"the all the serious math on it but uh"
"this this issue of of active inference"
"and minimal systems that"
"where whose self-organization is built"
"around minimizing surprise and making"
"predictions of the outside world i think"
"that that to me is the best candidate"
"for a framework from which everything"
"else follows i think once you once you"
"have that you can kind of derive all"
"this other stuff and and we're working"
"on some papers where we show step by"
"step how everything finally ending in"
"metacognition and uh models of yourself"
"as having free will and all this high"
"level stuff we associate with humans"
"i think all of that fundamentally can be"
"derived from from that initial piece so"
"so if i had to place a bet now i'd say"
"that's that's where to put it but uh you"
"know of course that's just a guess at"
"this point"
"thank you um i think uh micah has a"
"question i'll be uh unmeeting you and"
"you can ask it"
"okay hi"
hi
"um uh so i my mind is blown and i missed"
"a good amount of the talk so i'm gonna"
"have to come back and watch it but um"
"i have a couple questions one"
uh
"i'm wondering like it seems intuitively"
that
"the kinds of like in particular with"
"respect to the bioelectrical stuff um"
"the the kinds of"
"the ways that the"
"the the information is organized um"
uh
would
would
"relate to the scale of the self that you"
"were talking about so i'm curious if you"
have
"a sense of like what frequencies um"
"or wavelengths uh"
"are important at different scales"
um
uh
"in terms of like"
"organizing towards goals for different"
"scales of organisms and is my intuition"
"uh correct like there's probably a"
"relationship between the"
"the the time scales or the spatial"
"scales of the"
"of the um the frequencies of of"
"of electromagnetic"
um
uh
"interactions with the with the size of"
"the of the of the self involved"
"um that's my first question"
"yeah yeah an interesting question the"
"thing the thing is that uh there are no"
"frequencies involved here because this"
"is not electromagnetic so there are no"
"waves here at least at least to at least"
"we don't study them it's possible that"
"they're there i'm not saying they don't"
"exist but everything that we study is uh"
"steady state purely very slow purely"
"electrical state so this is this is the"
"propagation of information through the"
"network in uh resting potentials so"
"there are no waves here there's there"
"are no frequencies really now now it's"
"i'm not saying it's impossible that"
"there's some sort of um time and coding"
"that we haven't found yet it's it's"
"possible but we haven't seen anything"
"like that everything that we've done so"
"far is not about frequency at all"
"okay fascinating all right and then um"
"my second question is i'm i'm really"
"interested in in um conformal"
"transformations and like um"
"well especially the inversions and the"
"ones that are less familiar than the the"
"the main conformal transformations are"
"scaling translation"
"um rotation and inversion"
"and um so i make art around especially"
"around conformal inversion and i'm going"
"to be sharing on thursday um some of my"
"art i'm wondering if um"
"if you've encountered any"
"um sort of like"
"fundamental relationship to like"
"geometry whether it's conformal"
"transformations or other kinds of"
"like fundamental group actions in terms"
"of how"
um
"you know different"
"different goals play out um"
"in in organization in space uh with"
"these different creatures"
"yeah great great uh great ideas uh i i'm"
"not enough of an expert in any of those"
"things to know it might for all i know"
"these things might be here and staring"
"me in the face and i haven't recognized"
"it i i do i do work with a couple people"
"that that understand topology very well"
"and and all that kind of stuff and so"
"we'll we'll be discussing all of that"
"but um at the moment i don't i have not"
"found anything like that but but it's"
"entirely possible that it's here and i"
"just haven't noticed it"
"cool well this is like super"
"mind-blowing and exciting stuff so i'm"
"glad i caught the animal definitely"
"watch the recap"
"thank you"
"so carlos uh you had a question yes"
"well um thank you very much for talking"
"michael i mean i have to say i have a a"
"lifetime worth of questions if i could"
"at this point uh um but let me begin"
"somewhere um so just to connect to one"
"of our recent events in semf we had a"
"central document about client cognition"
"and we had some ties with some people"
"working on plants and"
"we've seen incredible examples with"
"animals i have to say i'm also"
"mind-blown echoing mikas and it's it's"
"really amazing um so do you have"
"anything to say about plants what do"
"they contribute to you what is your"
"perspective with all this more for space"
"navigation and and so on"
"any comments about super interesting"
"yeah yeah no plant plants are a very"
"interesting uh model system i"
"you know i i i love the work on on plan"
"on plant intelligence and all that i'm"
"not at all freaked out about those ideas"
"i think i think if we're if if we're"
"uncomfortable about plant intelligence"
"and things like this we are not ready"
"for exobiology in any way shape or form"
"or and not even not even in synthetic"
"biology because we're going to see"
"things that we've never seen before so i"
"think i don't find it at all uh you know"
"surprising that the plants are solving"
"all these problems the cool thing about"
"plants is that"
"much like or or one cool thing about"
"plants much like faizarum their behavior"
"and their morphogenesis are basically"
"happening in the same space right so in"
"order for them to have behavior they're"
"going to deform their bodies in some way"
"so so so just like that five arms i"
"think i think they they face some"
"interesting problems that that animals"
"handle in a different way so that that"
"makes it very interesting um"
"i love that i love the fact that uh"
"plants which have an independent origin"
"of multicellularity from from animals"
"happen to make some compounds that are"
"really good at"
"making subtle manipulations to to to"
"higher mammalian consciousness i think"
"that's very interesting right and why"
"that might be uh you know why why we"
"might be using some of the same kinds of"
"neurotransmitter pathways to to mediate"
"those things uh yeah very you know very"
"very interesting we my lab doesn't work"
"implants at all but there's some"
"fantastic work um on that on that topic"
yeah
"so um the other the other question i"
"guess i'll pick because there are other"
"questions i want to give away is i am"
"personally very fascinated by this idea"
"of the anatomical compiler i think"
"that's uh it's a it's a very interesting"
"concept and i i am a mathematician by"
"training i guess so i have sort of more"
"of a theoretical angle"
"but something that i find extremely"
"necessary in all these discussions is"
"that when you have your this large-scale"
"networks of interaction and as you said"
"it's bio by electricity being one of the"
"main sort of supports for this sort of"
"interaction but obviously could be"
"others i'm thinking constantly about um"
"the notion of higher order interaction"
"because if you model your system with a"
"network a binary pairwise network"
obviously
"i mean you're going to get a lot of the"
"phenomenology but perhaps not all and i"
"was wondering if you've observed in all"
"your studies in all your experiments"
"you've observed some cases where it's"
"absolutely necessary that you'll be"
"thinking about higher order connectivity"
"that doesn't boil down to pairwise"
"interaction because it feels very"
"natural to me that it will occur in"
"these sort of situations where there's"
"such clamps of blobs of stuff"
interacting
"yeah um so so i'm not sure if i've got"
"exactly the examples you're looking for"
"but i have two two kinds of uh two kinds"
"of things to to tell you about"
"one one is the idea that"
"a lot of a lot of what's important about"
"the way these systems control themselves"
"and each other is via identifying new"
"sort of mesoscale causally potent"
"control knobs so for example voltage"
"right voltage is a really interesting"
"thing because"
"this the exact same voltage can be"
"achieved by any number of different ions"
"moving around right voltage and we've"
"shown this in our inner work that the"
"same voltage causes the same effect"
"doesn't matter whether you got there"
"through sodium or potassium or chloride"
"that that doesn't matter what matters is"
"what the voltage is so it's like this"
"this this and then and then that that"
"voltage kickstarts all kinds of other"
"things downstream you know gene"
"expression changes chromatin"
"modification changes cell behavior"
"changes so so it's like a bow tie you"
"know it's it's like a it's like a center"
"of of this bowtie network and what's"
"cool about it is that as that center is"
"that it is it is an optimal causal nexus"
"it's the if you want to make change that"
"efficiently that's the thing you"
"manipulate it's a great control knob"
"versus versus trying to for example"
"individually manipulate all the"
"downstream you know uh consequences so"
"so in many of these cases uh there are"
"these these kind of large-scale emergent"
"um you know virtual governors basically"
"in in weiner's uh terminology that that"
"are really important uh and really"
"efficient for making change and the"
"other thing just purely spatially one of"
"the key things that we find out is that"
"most of the interesting effects are not"
"local in other words if i want to change"
"the shape of the brain if i want to"
"normalize a tumor if i want to um"
"induce melanoma with no genetic change"
"all of these things i can do the same"
"thing from the opposite end of the body"
"basically it does not have to be right"
"where you're looking to to induce effect"
"because what these networks do very well"
"is propagate information so i can i can"
"kickstart an influence on the other side"
"of the animal and and have effects on"
"all of the things that i showed you"
"today so so i don't know if that"
"addresses your question but you know"
"yeah yeah that that that is i mean the"
"fact that topology can contain all that"
"information i mean it's certainly going"
"beyond the sort of piecewise element"
"anyway i'll give way to other toy"
"questions have more but"
"thank you carlos uh shigozi do you have"
"a question"
"yeah um hi there michael uh thanks so"
"much for the talk"
"um i was wondering um the xenobots you"
"found a structure um"
"which can do these this this collection"
algorithm
"um using an evolutionary approach"
"um in the computer and i'm wondering if"
you
"have done work on"
um
"on getting structures which can do"
"arbitrary computations"
um
and
"make make make"
"whatever structures you like"
um
"yeah yeah"
"ideally also in"
"a rationally designed way instead of"
"necessarily an evolutionary approach"
"right yeah that's that's uh sure that's"
"the next step so we're working on that"
"now um"
"we are just beginning that journey uh i"
"think that"
"there's a couple of reasons why the"
"first the the first three papers focused"
on
"really uh very light uh engineering it's"
"mostly showing off the capacity of these"
"cells right the cells do most of the"
"heavy lifting i mean we do some"
"sculpting and some other things but i i"
"we wanted to emphasize this early on"
"because the more we engineer them the"
"more people will look and say well"
"you've sort of you know uh"
"managed these cells into doing something"
"else what i want to show is the uh the"
"endogenous uh plasticity that's there"
"that what's already there before we sort"
"of have some heavy hand in putting in"
"synthetic biology circuits and all this"
"other stuff that we're gonna of course"
"do later on so"
"i think in general the whole thing is"
"going to be much like evolution for us"
"as engineers"
"i think this is something that evolution"
"you know we talk a lot about what"
"evolution and engineers do differently i"
"think this is fundamentally one thing"
"that evolution and engineers have to"
"face the exact same problem which is"
"when you are dealing with a complex"
"agent material you have to discover ways"
"to coax it to do what you want it's not"
"like building with passive materials not"
"even with not even like building with"
"active materials this is and so and so"
"searching that space whether it be in a"
"evolutionary way or ultimately in a you"
"know some sort of rational design way or"
"most likely a combination of the two"
"that's the future of of of these things"
"and we're just getting started now very"
"early days still"
"thank you for your question"
"uh max million would you like to go next"
"yes thank you very much"
so
"you have um"
"alluded to the you know sort of these"
"upper layers where you said linguistics"
"you know"
"um so you started with the kind of like"
"a very very small scale and then you"
"have you know transcriptomics and stuff"
"like all the other the whole ladder of"
"life basically"
"now yesterday we heard that"
"architects for example um sort of"
"outsource part of the"
"mission to paper by doing drawings and"
they
"can use that collectively"
"interesting things"
"when and where does culture emerge"
and
so
"if we boil this one to maybe even"
"pre-language one of the could ask is"
"is there a moment where such a"
"genterrial materials as you say sort of"
"shaped their environment and used the"
"environment as an additional kind of"
"passive agent and so there my question"
"would be if you have encountered in all"
"the experiments you've made"
"stuff like that where obviously the"
"environment is shaped by the agents"
basically
"yeah yeah um in in"
"in biology it's especially in"
"developmental biology this is this is"
"happening all the time so for example"
"there was a there's a beautiful recent"
"paper where they they show that cells"
"moving in a collective migration of"
"cells moving in the embryo to build"
"something at a distance the way they get"
"there is by"
"establishing a gradient on around"
"themselves in the environment for"
"themselves it's like it's like a train"
"that basically lays tracks in front of"
"itself so that it can follow the track"
"right so so that happens cells do it to"
"each other all the time so there's a"
"there's this notion of stigmergy and"
"using um"
"extracellular matrix you know dumping"
"dumping signals in the extracellular"
"matrix so that other cells will do"
"certain things cells this i kind of"
"alluded to this in that in that idea"
"where where each system bends the option"
"space for the other systems because by"
"putting these signals into the"
"environment whether they be mechanical"
"signals whether it be barriers whether"
"they be uh electrical signals or"
"whatever they are"
"you are you are deforming the uh the the"
"the space of um"
"possibilities for their neighbors and"
"the traditional way of looking that is"
"as the space of physical forces that are"
"going to force them to do various things"
"but i think the deeper kind of more"
"general way is to look at the space of"
"signals that you might give because when"
"your system you know if your system is a"
"bowling ball you're going to be"
"deforming the space by building you know"
"canals through which it's going to roll"
"and that's all that you have but when"
"you're when your system is a rat you can"
"do many interesting things that don't"
"involve physical barriers you can have"
"rewards and punishments and inducements"
"and if your system is a human you can do"
"all very complex things so"
"in biology this happens all the time and"
"and we're going to be we're making these"
"closed loop systems"
"shortly where for example the zenobots"
"by their own actions are going to be"
"able to manipulate their environment so"
"they will be able to have things change"
"in the environment and then there will"
"be this like closed loop between them"
"and the outs and their world um so i"
"yeah i i have little doubt that we're"
"going to see amazing things come from"
"that because cells do it to each other"
"constantly they're used to that kind of"
thing
"thank you"
"does anybody else have any questions um"
"feel free carlos"
"uh yes um you can hear me right i think"
"i have this this um yes um"
"so i was i was wondering about um"
"anatomical homeostasis so when when uh"
"i mean perhaps traditionally we think"
"this is a rare occurrence and we think"
"of like the rare instances of animals"
"that can do this"
"so do you think so that's a twofold"
"question is uh is it actually rare or is"
"it that we're not looking at the right"
"signals that you know our"
"eyes are not trained to see uh or the"
"organs are being regenerated in a way"
"that and and the twofold is um is it"
really
"rare and if it is"
"why is there is there a reason is there"
"some cost to this or you know any"
"comments in this"
"yeah uh great question a couple of"
"things um"
"on the one hand the ability to"
"regenerate in adulthood large structures"
"is not universal now"
"so that kind of regenerability is not"
"just for so-called simple systems"
"because there are lots of worms that"
"regenerate very well and then there's a"
"sister species that doesn't regenerate"
"anything so it's not about simplicity or"
"complexity but"
"uh of course we would all like to be in"
"like a planarian so we could regenerate"
"our organs and and and so on and so so"
"there is a question there to be asked"
"like why do we not do this and and i"
"have some thoughts about that but but i"
"i think the the more interesting thing"
"is that i actually don't think it's rare"
"at all because uh for for a couple of"
"reasons i think it's universal because"
"cells when when when cells come into"
"being in our and are first making an"
embryo
"uh they have to figure out"
"what they're going to do meaning meaning"
"where the every cell is some other"
"cell's external environment so the"
"ability to draw boundaries between"
"yourself and the environment to make"
"models of yourself as a causal agent"
"well i'm going to do this or i'm not"
"going to do that"
"all of these problems have to be solved"
"on the fly every time and there's an"
"interesting um the kind of uh"
"train of thought in in cognitive science"
"which is which goes by the name of uh"
"for example the mind is flat right it's"
"this idea that that there isn't this"
"like massive deep thing underlying their"
"cognition that basically a lot of what"
"we do is generated on the fly right but"
"you you know you can fabulate stories"
"about what you just did and it seems"
"like you there's a coherent central self"
"but actually a lot of this is just kind"
"of a user illusion for associating with"
"others and so on so there's this idea i"
"have my feeling is that development is"
"probably very much like that and the"
"reason that i that i think that we have"
these
"remember that even human embryos you can"
"divide them into four quarters for"
"example or probably more and they"
"regenerate just fine"
"you get you get quadruplets and so on"
"you can you know you can regenerate a"
"whole human body from one cell that's"
"what development really is it's a"
"regenerative event you you you you grow"
"a whole body from one cell so the"
"ability to do this i think is that that"
"plasticity and that ability to um"
"uh by the way here's another example of"
"plasticity if you've ever seen the"
"rubber handle illusion right so go on"
"youtube and check out the rubber hand"
"illusion basically what they do is they"
"sit they sit at somebody down and they"
"take a rubber hand and they put it next"
"to them and they sort of for for about"
"10 minutes it only takes a few minutes"
"to uh they sort of touch the hand and"
"they and they and you see them touching"
"the rubber hand at the same time and"
"then after a while they take they take a"
"hammer and you know and they go to hit"
"the rubber hand and the person the the"
"person jumps because"
"for millions of years they've been a"
"tetrapod and their brain certainly knows"
"how many limbs they have and yet 10"
"minutes of experience has now convinced"
"them that that hand is already belongs"
"to them not to mention all kinds of"
"disorders where people don't think their"
"leg belongs to them and so on so that"
"that plasticity right that that that"
"that um"
"the reason that plasticity is there is"
"because we all build ourselves basically"
"on the fly both physically and and uh"
"and cognitively and so i don't think"
"it's rare i think it's constant i think"
"that's what enables the development to"
"be robust uh to be consistent to be able"
"to handle you know when you give"
"somebody an um a prosthetic limb where"
"the wrist rotates all the way around"
"where which where which normal wrists"
"don't do yeah no problem when they go"
"reach for cups they'll rotate you know"
"the way that your normal wrist would"
"never would be you know people learn to"
"to to"
"operate all this stuff uh that that"
"plasticity i think tells me that we're"
"we're constructing ourselves all the"
"time so i don't so from that perspective"
"i don't think it's rare at all yeah so"
"would it be would it be right to say"
"that um for example when cells are"
"multiplying and dying constantly right"
"in a body that they still i mean the"
"invariant aspect is the shape most of"
"the time right function that's a good"
"example of that right absolutely"
"absolutely maintenance yeah"
"self-maintenance cancer suppression is"
"is and in fact even development"
imagine
"imagine um scaling yourself down to the"
"point where you were a size of a single"
"cell and you and if you you you're in"
"the embryo you're looking around the"
"amount of noise and the amount of"
"stochasticity and all the all the"
"craziness that's going on if you didn't"
"already know what embryonic development"
"was you would never in a million years"
"say that oh yes this will end up as a"
"perfect fish every single time you would"
"never you would never be able to predict"
"that it looks it looks completely"
chaotic
"that way and and that's because the"
"outcome with very few exceptions i mean"
"maybe like nematodes or something might"
"be an exception but but most creatures"
"the the micro details actually don't"
"matter all that much right the noise is"
"a part of the system this is it's in"
"fact it's probably necessary for the"
"system so um"
"i think maintaining that uh as your"
"cells come and go and you remain is is"
"is just fundamental right"
"amazing thanks"
um
"if anybody else uh has questions uh feel"
"free to raise your hand um i have a"
"question myself but uh i guess well i"
"can go back to micah"
"yeah i wanted to just take one more try"
"at my first question um"
"and reframe it a little bit um i'm just"
"curious about so you're looking at"
"um in terms of bio like bioelectric"
"effects um"
"like static voltages"
um
"i'm wondering you know"
"how quickly do those voltages switch"
"or change um at different scales"
"um and is there"
"can you can you infer like"
"you know oh this is a large scale goal"
"if there's a much slower change in"
"voltage like um like if it's more close"
"to dc can you infer that maybe there's"
"some sort of large scale thing going on"
"versus um a smaller interaction like"
"maybe inside of a cell like with some"
"little piece where there's something"
"changing more quickly i would expect"
"the changes to be more quick yeah"
"i i understand what you mean it's an"
"interesting idea um i will say that"
"we can only our ability to predict goals"
"from bioelectrical data is is very"
"meager right now we can only do that in"
"a few examples so i'm certainly not"
"going to commit to a definitive answer"
"to your question because we are all i"
"think i think this is this this whole"
"field is just uh kind of at a nascent"
"state where we're only beginning to be"
"able to crack the encoding so so"
"maybe i think i think yours is a good"
"hypothesis and maybe at some point we'll"
"have evidence for it at the moment we"
"don't see that at the moment the time"
scale
"at different uh at different speed the"
"time scale of voltage change at"
"different spatial scales"
"seems to be roughly similar which which"
"which is that it it you know it"
"generally changes on the order of"
"minutes to hours is kind of the the time"
"scale but like i said we do not have the"
"high resolution data that we would need"
"to definitively say one way or the other"
"so i think i think it remains a"
"perfectly reasonable hypothesis"
"cool well this is so exciting and"
"mind-blowing so thanks thanks"
"thank you micah um so i have a question"
"myself uh if anybody else has questions"
"feel free to raise your hand but uh"
"michael so"
"in the theory of uh formal grammars and"
"rewriting systems"
"there are there are these ideas called"
"uh confluence and normal forms"
"so they roughly describe which terms uh"
"in such a system can be rewritten or"
"transformed in more than one way"
"to yield the same result"
"um do you think there could potentially"
"be a way"
"to map the concepts of biological"
"convergence like certain forms that come"
"come up time and time again to the"
"concepts of confluence and normal forms"
"so i know this might hint at"
"like some sort of teleology and have"
"potential implications like what alien"
"life forms despite evolving from a"
"different environment uh be the same"
"and and do you think there are necessary"
"and i want to emphasize that we're"
necessary
"do you think there are necessary forms"
"or like platonic forms that organ"
"organisms time and time converge to that"
"purely result from maybe like an"
"underlying logic"
"or math at play"
[Music]
"i i i love that idea and uh and i'm glad"
"i'm glad you brought it up because uh"
"this is something that i think about a"
"lot and i don't i wouldn't normally talk"
"about it uh"
"in in the you know in these uh in these"
"talks but i"
"yeah i think i think there definitely is"
"something to that and and and i'll say"
"i'll say the following as we"
"try to figure out what the possible"
"goals are in a given space because we"
"don't we don't really have a science of"
"that very well yet it's certainly in"
"biology we see these new spaces we don't"
"know when when we build a a new um a"
"novel system of some sort let's say we"
"engineer it or we modified or chimeric"
"or something we have no idea how to"
"guess what the goals are it's actually"
"an existential problem because we're"
"making internet of things and swarm"
"robotics and all kinds of social"
"structures where we have absolutely no"
"clue what the what the um"
"what the collective intelligence is"
"going to want what its capabilities are"
"going to be we don't know how to predict"
"any of that stuff so so i think it's i"
"think it's uh super important to uh to"
"try to develop a science of that and as"
"i think about how to think about these"
"things it occurs to me that what happens"
is
"evolution uh"
"creates certain kinds of hardware"
that
"are able to basically dial in"
"all kinds of uh"
"free lunch uh types of um"
"affordances from what looked it looks to"
"me like a platonic space here's what i"
"mean by that if you're making a triangle"
"and you've evolved to know what two of"
"the angles are do you need to evolve the"
"third one no you already know what it"
"has to be now why is that why don't you"
"need to evolve the third one well"
"because we know what the what they add"
"up to where does that fact live right"
"it's not it's not anything that so so so"
"there's that there are things like if"
"you evolve a voltage-gated ion channel"
"you've basically made a transistor"
"you've made a voltage gate at current"
"conductance as soon as you've done that"
"you get access to all of the basic logic"
"circuits you can make ands ors and nands"
"and everything else so you got this nice"
"truth table well where does that truth"
"table live it's not in the protein"
"structure of the of the channel it's"
"it's so so visually right and i i i you"
"know it's it's um"
"i don't know i'm not saying i have a"
"mechanism for this i'm just this is how"
"i there's how i think about it there's"
"this there's this massive uh uh platonic"
"space of possible affordances of"
"different you know what what lives in"
"that space there is you know archimedean"
"simple machines that you can do if you"
"make bones of a certain you know"
"configuration there are uh laws of"
"computation so here's what you have"
"access to uh when you make transistors"
"and and and memory and things like that"
"here are uh biomechanically right if you"
make
"if if you have two two sets of balls one"
"of which is very sticky with each other"
"and one of which is less sticky with"
"each other and you put them in an urn"
"and you shake it up what do you get you"
"get a core of the sticky ones surrounded"
"by the non-sticky ones you don't have to"
"evolve that that's that's a free gift"
"from physics all you had to do was find"
"something that's differentially sticky"
"the three-dimensional structure of it is"
"is you get that for free where does that"
"come from so so it looks to me it seems"
that
"uh it's almost the thing that that when"
"mathematicians talk about you know do"
"they discover these truths of"
"mathematics that's very much how it"
"seems to me that there's this there's"
"this massive space of uh possible um"
"uh you know kind of uh i don't even know"
"what to call them but but some kind of"
"affordance that you don't have to"
"specifically evolve that you gain access"
"to if you've got the right hardware to"
"dial it in it's all you know you so so"
"it's it's sitting there and it's"
"inaccessible to you"
"until you've evolved the right hardware"
"to make use of it and what's cool is"
"that for the computational ones for"
example
"it kind of doesn't matter what the"
"hardware is made of you can make logic"
"gates out of flowing water out of beer"
"cans and string as stand then it says"
"out of anything it doesn't it doesn't"
"have to be biology it doesn't have to be"
"silicon so"
"that tells me that exactly as you said"
"there are going to be general principles"
where
"we can look at something that's made in"
"an entirely different way than what what"
"we thought and it's made by a different"
"process it might be evolved it might be"
"designed it might be different materials"
"but we're going to look and say ah that"
"belongs to that same region of that"
"space because here's what it's taking"
"advantage of it's taking advantage of"
"small world network dynamics or taking"
"advantage of you know some kind of truth"
"of of topology or some kind of"
"computational you know thing that you"
"know the fact that nand gates are"
"universal something something like that"
"that's so so i have great sympathy with"
"that view i think something like that"
"has got to be true but uh you know it's"
"it's still in the realm of you know kind"
"of conceptual"
"thinking it's not really testable per se"
"at the moment"
"and maybe to playfully speculate here do"
"you perhaps think there might be"
"an agential platonic space like very"
"very primitive uh type"
"minds that"
"always will rise"
"i i i think that's entirely reasonable"
"and i think that uh now now again we"
"have to be humble about the fact that"
"every type of mind we've ever seen so"
"far has come from one"
"um you know has come from one one place"
"which is which is the uh the"
"evolutionary uh the evolutionary stream"
"on earth so we don't know too much right"
"so we're drawing we're drawing"
"conclusions from an nf1 but that's"
"that's going to change rapidly because"
"we are not only with with with ai but"
"with with um synthetic morphology we're"
"going to make a bunch of creatures that"
"look nothing like what we've seen so"
"that that that that is going to be that"
"that's the data set's going to enlarge"
"very quickly uh i do think that for"
"example something like what i showed you"
"earlier um"
"which was the uh the latter from weiner"
"and rosenbluth that that talks about it"
"like i think those are"
generic
"uh milestones along the way of making"
"increasingly more sophisticated"
"intelligences they are like that that to"
"me is likely to be universal now it's"
"hard it's hard to talk about universals"
"from really an n of one but but but if i"
"have to guess i i do think that we're"
"going to see um"
"we're going to see you know sort of"
grant
"let's call them great transitions in"
"cognitive capacity that are going to be"
"mappable no matter where you came from"
"no matter what you look like uh they're"
"going to be mappable and uh there i if i"
"have to guess i would say they're all"
"going to be around ways to handle goals"
"right different different types of"
"different types and sizes of goals that"
"can be managed by any cognitive system"
"and that that to me is the best i've not"
"i've not seen anything that that i like"
"better as a way to um"
"a potential taxonomy of all possible"
"minds i mean that's that's really what i"
"think we're going for here right is is"
"invariant to origin story and variant of"
"material how do we compare possible"
"minds and i think it's that i think it's"
"a set of instead of a set of great"
"transitions and then what's beyond you"
"know so"
"what's what's also interesting is we"
"always think about going down and think"
"about well well you know do do these"
"simple creatures that have cognitive"
"capacities and so on"
"we should also be going upwards as well"
"right in the sense that uh we all know"
"what reduced capacity means you go to"
"court and somebody says well"
"you know that person has reduced"
"capacity that they they can't you know"
"they you can't hold them to the same"
"standards because whatever well what's"
"increased capacity what's it going to"
"look like when a hundred years from now"
"either we create or find or whatever we"
"we there there exists some sort of"
"enormous you know uh"
"cognitive systems that"
"that are so far ahead of us in terms of"
"all the consequences and and that they"
"can possibly consider and all the things"
"they can actually care about right we i"
"wrote with some colleagues we wrote a"
"paper recently on"
"uh the intersection of"
"of of of this kind of developmental"
"biology ai and buddhism and the"
"intersection is this concept of care"
"this idea of as a cognitive system what"
"are you actually capable of caring about"
"so humans of course have a large"
"capacity but there's a there's there's a"
"there's a linear range where you can"
"care about i can actively care about x"
"number of let's say other people and if"
"i find out that you know 10 times more"
"people something happened to them i'm"
"not 10 times more sad or whatever we"
"just can't we have there's only a linear"
"sort of capacity but that's just us"
"there's some possible being as as"
"discussed for example in the buddhist"
"tradition where"
"you could have a cognition uh complex"
"enough that you could actually"
"physically linearly care about you know"
"billions of people billions of living"
"things on the planet right that's"
"possible and we can't do it but it's"
"it's a theory possible"
"so um i do think that uh there are going"
"to be these great great transitions some"
"of which we can't even begin to you know"
"fathom but we should start developing"
"the taxonomy now"
"i absolutely love that answer thank you"
"um anybody else just just one quick just"
"one quick follow-up on the on that"
"taxonomy of mines because i i think it's"
"a very enticing idea so what do you"
"imagine the the texture of that of that"
"space to be i mean it's sort of space"
"for spaces of mines i mean but like um"
"what what kind of forum do you do you"
"think that taxonomy imagine i don't know"
"50 years from now or 40 years from now"
"the story is complete and we have a good"
"theory of this taxonomy what do you"
"think that would look like i mean do you"
"would you have like mostly theory would"
"you have sort of technology that"
"implements in a in a sort of proactive"
"way all this how does that look like"
"that end goal of that taxonomy i mean it"
"looks like a dream to me but it's very"
interesting
"well right so so i can't i think i think"
"predicting 50 years into the future is"
"is a guaranteed way to make a fool of"
"myself so i i will i will be you know"
"sort of"
"humble about that but but i think that"
uh
"we've started with us with a simple"
"taxonomy that we can we can get started"
"on now which is this this this this idea"
"of this cognitive light cone right this"
"this this uh the size of and and"
"complexity of the goals that you are"
"capable of pursuing i think that will"
"serve us well for a while anyway until"
"we get to something better and i think"
"in the future what we are going to have"
"to do the real challenge as a as a"
"species for us"
"is going to be developing ethics"
"frameworks that correctly that that"
"basically work within that space because"
"right now you know we are we are imagine"
"imagine the um"
"pre darwin"
uh
"what you could do to partition all of"
"life is you could draw uh you could draw"
"a line you could say here are the humans"
"here's everything else you partition it"
"with a single line and we had and you"
"can make and you can make a simple um"
"you know simple uh of ethical norms"
"based on without partitioning with one"
"line okay"
"after darwin who told us that actually"
"there's no good place to put a line this"
"is impossible to put a line and now what"
"i'm telling you now about chimeric and"
"hybrid technologies partitioning that"
"space if you're going to partition it in"
"any way it's not going to be a line it's"
"going to be some some ridiculously"
"byzantine surface where you're going to"
"try to say well human hybrids that are"
"at least 48 human cells but not more"
"than like it's just"
"i can't even begin to imagine right so"
"so you have to go back to i think you"
"have to go back to something like some"
"of these ancient traditions who uh were"
"very clear for example that your concern"
"should be proportional to uh to to to"
"the sentience of beings not what they're"
"made of not what they look like right so"
"so people have already tackled this a"
"really long time ago we haven't done"
"well with it as humans we just haven't"
"we've been ignoring it but but this is"
"going to this is going to be front and"
"center in the future where you're going"
"to be your your the neighbor you know to"
"your left is going to be"
"somebody that has uh uh you know uh 73"
"percent uh human brain cells and the"
"rest are our electronics that drive"
"various you know tractors and things and"
"and his wheelchair and whatnot and then"
"there's going to be another thing that"
"lives on the other side which is"
"actually mostly a set of machines but"
"it's got a bunch of human cells in there"
"to kind of help them recognize your"
"picture and so on and you we are all"
"going to have to figure out how we"
"relate to all these beings uh right and"
"that that's going to be the that's going"
"to be the huge challenge but i think"
"what we start with is"
"is is is a space of gold directedness"
"because that fundamentally if you just"
"if you just ask yourself what what"
"determines what kind of relationship you"
"can have with"
"with a novel creature whether that"
"whether they're sort of engineered or"
"whether there's a spaceship that lands"
"on your lawn and something comes out how"
"are you going to decide what kind of"
"relationship you can have with it it's"
"not going to be made it's not going to"
"be based on what they're made of or how"
"they how they got here it's going to be"
"some kind of function of"
"what do they care about what goals are"
"they capable of of of of of pursuing"
"that's going to be the determining"
"factor so we have to we have to figure"
"out something of that nature"
"absolutely okay"
"uh i think uh we are coming to the end"
"of this uh entire discussion but uh i"
"just wanted to give uh thanks to all the"
"audience members who uh"
"participated gave very thoughtful"
"questions and then of course i want to"
"thank uh michael levin for you know"
"taking his time uh giving a very very"
"comprehensive and excellent talk um and"
"uh great answers to all these questions"
um
"so yeah uh i'll leave it to carlos to"
"explain what else is on her schedule"
"today thank you michael thank you so"
"much everybody really great discussion"
"really appreciate your attention your"
"questions thank you thank you very much"
"michael yes so we we come to the end of"
"this session today um"
"next we're going to have uh the so the"
"next meeting is going to be in a 30"
"minutes same same meeting room uh before"
"that i would encourage you to follow the"
"gather town link so i think alvaro can"
"post it on the on the chat uh if anyone"
"wants to join and continue with"
"conversation in a much more informal way"
"uh head over there and i'll see you in"
"tabarika the virtual recreation of"
"tavarika this little island of the coast"
"of my of my hometown in in southern"
"spain in the mediterranean um and other"
"than that i'll see you in 30 minutes uh"
"in the same room so see you around"
"and feel free to continue this"
"discussion on discord we have a uh"
"channel specifically for this uh talk so"
"anybody here"
"yeah continue discussing great place to"
"discuss until you leave"
"any materials any links any references"
"things that are interesting everything"
"can be can be put there it statically"
"will be forever so it's it's a good sort"
"of record"
"yeah so see you everyone"
you
