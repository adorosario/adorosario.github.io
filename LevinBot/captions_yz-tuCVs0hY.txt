"okay thanks tom um"
"mike tom just introduced you there as a"
"developmental biologist it always has"
"seemed to me that you do developmental"
"biology like no one else does um"
"i suppose the the the general question"
"you seem to be uh trying to address is"
"how cells organize themselves"
"and each other in time and space to"
"form sp uh to to form two distinct"
"tissues and organs and organisms with"
"specific body shapes so really all the"
"stuff between molecules and life as we"
"observe it and it's in that in between"
space
"that something seems to happen that"
"distinguishes living matter from other"
"kinds of matter"
"um and i want to burrow down into that"
"in what we talk about but first of all i"
"wanted to ask you this my sense is that"
"you think there is something"
"quite fundamental still missing from"
"that picture of how we think about or at"
"least how we talk about life something"
"that we're not going to get at by just"
"filling in more of the details more of"
"the fine molecular details so i want to"
"ask am i writing that and briefly if i"
"am what do you think that missing"
"ingredient might be"
"yeah well"
"i think that uh to to start to answer"
"that let's let's go back to the first"
"part of the question which is what what"
"what do i think i'm really doing and i"
"should say that uh i think that um"
"developmental biology is uh which is a"
"uh an offshoot of what i think my"
"fundamental interest is which is that"
"i think what i'm actually studying is"
"mind or cognition in different"
"embodiments so so the reason that i'm so"
"interested in developmental biology"
"specifically is that it's an amazing"
"example where during the during uh"
"sometimes just a few days and sometimes"
"a few weeks you start off with something"
"that people would call just physics or"
"just chemistry so some sort of quiescent"
"oocyte it's a single cell it may not be"
"doing very much"
"and and after a very short time frame"
"you then have something like an organism"
"that has preferences ability to learn"
"maybe it's if it's human eventually it"
"will have the ability to use language to"
"expound on why it's not a machine and"
"all of these are things that that people"
"talk about and so that journey each one"
"of us takes that journey right from from"
"from from physics and chemistry to"
"complex mind and and and there's no"
"there's no hiding from from that right"
"to to whatever extent"
"we are cognitive creatures we have an"
"inner perspective we have various mental"
"capacities we were once just physics all"
"of us were not just in an evolutionary"
"sense but really in a developmental"
"sense and you can watch it happen in"
"front of your eyes so from that"
"perspective i think developmental"
"biology is is uh you know it's why i"
"switched from doing computation in in"
"sort of silicon medium to computation"
"and living media but i am fundamentally"
"interested not just in questions of"
"cells and why they do things but in"
"morphogenesis or or pattern formation as"
"an example of the appearance of mind"
"from matter that's really right to me"
"developmental biology is the most"
"magical process there is because it"
"literally in front of your eyes takes"
"you from from matter to mind you can see"
"it happen and that's what i'm interested"
in
and
"by that i understand i mean this is um"
"the the issue that uh tom mentioned of"
"you your notion that and dan dennis"
"notion that life is cognition all the"
"way down and it seems clear you don't"
"mean that as a metaphor do you you see a"
"complete continuity between what single"
"cells do and what large brained animals"
"like us do"
"so where does that continuity come from"
what
"what what is your what what do you mean"
"by cognition in this sense yeah so so so"
"the first the first point you know do i"
"think it's a metaphor um you know in a"
"strong sense i think everything"
"scientists do is a metaphor so so i"
"think we have to be really careful not"
"to believe that we have some things that"
"are sort of real pictures of the world"
"like pathways that we see in our"
"textbooks i mean these things are are as"
"metaphorical as anything else maybe more"
"so and then there are these metaphors"
"that you know we sort of we sort of"
"speak about that aren't really real or"
"just fuzzy ways of talking i don't"
"believe this i think that um in science"
"all we have are metaphors now some"
"metaphors are better than others and the"
"way that i like to judge metaphors is to"
"what extent do they facilitate progress"
"meaning meaning new capabilities further"
"experiments right a good metaphor is one"
"that it's not necessarily one that"
"doesn't break prior assumptions it's not"
"necessarily one that doesn't shock you"
"it what it has to do is it has to uh"
"move you towards new experiments and i"
"think that"
"from that perspective uh cognition all"
"the way down is is an absolutely"
"excellent metaphor for a couple of"
"reasons uh the first is that it's been"
"incredibly fruitful in generating new"
"new hypotheses new experiments new"
"capabilities um including some that are"
"reaching into biomedicine we can we"
"could talk about that but but the reason"
"that the reason that i think it's it's"
"inescapable is"
"let's uh is is basically back to"
"developmental biology instead of a lot"
"of people start off right"
"you know they'll start off with with a"
"paramecium or or you know some kind of"
"simple life form and they'll say look"
"surely that's not cognitive surely"
"that's just physics right and and i i"
"like to do it uh in reverse i like to"
"say okay what whatever humans have"
"uncontroversially as high level"
"cognition right so so if cognition means"
"anything it it's we have it right"
"otherwise it would just there's just no"
um
"nothing to talk about so whatever it is"
"that we have you can start with an adult"
"human with all of this and just walk"
"slowly backwards and when you walk"
"slowly backwards you can do it"
"evolutionarily too but let's just do it"
"developmentally you walk slowly"
"backwards and eventually you walk into a"
"a small child that's that's babbling and"
"trying to understand the reference of"
"language and before that you've got an"
"embryo and before that you've got a"
"single cell and before that you've got"
"some chemical reactions and so the"
"important thing is that biology offers"
"absolutely no bright line there is no"
"process at which you can say that's"
"where the lightning flash happened"
"before that it was just chemistry and"
"physics ah now we've got some cognition"
"there is there is no no point like that"
"that that anybody i mean people have"
"tried to draw lines like that i've never"
"heard of a convincing one and so i think"
"i think uh the way i would i would sort"
"of flip that question around is to say"
"if somebody if somebody doesn't think"
"there's a continuity it's on them to"
"specify what the discontinuity is right"
"it's not it's not it's it's not that you"
"have to defend the continuity i mean"
"darwin knew"
"he spoke about this very clearly um the"
"continuity is staring us in the face"
"it's the it's the discontinuity that"
"needs defending if somebody in fact"
"thinks that there is there is a sharp"
"break here somewhere"
"you just said something interesting you"
"said you could look at that process"
"either in evolutionary terms or in"
"developmental terms um but i wonder"
"to what extent those are"
"sort of equivalent ways of looking at it"
"because developmentally"
"there's um"
"we can argue about whether the notion of"
"a program makes sense developmentally"
"but certainly there seems to be a target"
"of sorts there is something that you're"
"going to end up with"
"in evolutionary terms"
"it's not at all obvious that that is the"
"case and i mean it's normally said that"
"it's not the case at all there's nothing"
"you know purposeful or directional"
"perhaps about evolution"
"but i wonder if that's something if"
"that's a distinction that actually you"
"want to challenge"
"how did how should we think about that"
"process as being distinct or similar in"
"evolutionary or developmental terms yeah"
"um well i actually i actually have have"
"written uh one one paper with chris"
"fields on uh target morphology in"
"evolution and we can we can talk about"
"that specifically if people like but but"
"i want to go back to kind of um the the"
"the really important thing that you just"
"mentioned which is having a target of"
"some sort one thing that uh"
"is really important i i think one one"
"one thing that we have to do is we have"
"to ask what do we mean by a cognitive"
"system of some sort okay so when i say"
"it's cognition all the way down what am"
"i really saying so this has been this"
"has been people people have addressed"
"this for for a really long time and i"
"think we need to do two uh two"
"interesting things one is that we have"
"to abandon a binary view of things"
"binary views get us in trouble in this"
"in this case if we if if you try to say"
"there are conscious systems and"
"unconscious systems there are cognitive"
"systems and then there are"
"just machines there are you know"
"purposeful things and then there are"
"artifacts those kind of um distinctions"
"are completely arbitrary they are a"
"result of of past limitations of"
"technology and imagination on our part"
"they i don't believe they exist and they"
"get us into all kinds of pseudo problems"
"where people have to make these"
"byzantine partitions and"
"of things and try to figure out you know"
"where things land what i think we have"
"is a continuum where one has to ask not"
"whether something is cognitive but how"
"much and what kind so there's a"
"continuum so so i've"
"lots of people ever since um cybernetics"
"in the 40s where where norbert weiner"
"and colleagues have put out a an example"
"of a spectrum like this i've got my own"
"version which is called the uh the"
"spectrum of persuadability that we can"
"talk about but the idea is that it's a"
"continuum and along this continuum there"
"are diverse capacities for goal-directed"
"behavior the things on the left of the"
"continuum have extremely small capacity"
"for goal directed behavior so meaning"
"that all they do is pursue energy"
"gradients down and that's all they can"
"do these are balls rolling down a hill"
"water flowing down and and things like"
"this all the way on the right are very"
"very clever things like humans which can"
"pursue very complex goals using planning"
"using extensive memory using all sorts"
"of neat tricks that they have"
"in between this we have we have a"
"variety of other agents that may be uh"
"that may have limited limited ability to"
"pursue various goals and i've"
"the way i formalized it is as being able"
"to for any for any creature whether it"
"be biological synthetic a software"
"engineered alien you name it for any"
"creature you can draw something called a"
"cognitive light cone you can simply ask"
"what is the size of the biggest goal"
"that that creature is able to pursue and"
"when i mean biggest goal i mean distance"
"in both space and time so for just to"
"give you a simple example if you're a"
"tick you've got a little bit of memory"
"going backwards maybe a little bit of"
"predictive capacity going forwards i"
"mean even yeast have that but really all"
"you care about is your local"
"concentration of butyrate then you're"
"following the gradient and that's pretty"
"much all you're ever going to do"
"if you're a dog you have a much bigger"
"horizon of memory going backwards you"
"have more predictive capacity going"
"forwards but you're never going to care"
"about what happens in the next town over"
"three weeks from now just can't be done"
"with that as far as we know with that"
"cognitive system and if you're a human"
"you might actually be depressed that in"
"some billions of years the sun will burn"
"out because you literally can care about"
"these enormous things very complex large"
"scale things like global you know world"
"peace and the status of the markets and"
"all this so so what you can what the the"
"thing about that kind of scale is that"
"it takes all of this away from"
"philosophical uh sort of arguments and"
"down into experiments basically we can"
"actually find out we can do experiments"
"what does that system"
"what is it able to exert work towards"
"what kind of states does it prefer and"
"how much"
"how much competency does it exhibit for"
"example and you know i forget who's um"
"somebody had a great analogy and i"
"forget who it was but this the"
"difference between two magnets trying to"
"get together and romeo and julia trying"
"to get together right the difference is"
"how what what degree of of of ability to"
"avoid local obstacles does the system"
"have in doing it right it could be very"
"simple it could be very very complex and"
"then and then we can we can stop having"
"philosophical debates about this we can"
"simply do experiments and that means"
"that if if i show you some kind of a"
"system maybe it's synthetic maybe it's a"
"real animal who knows uh we can make"
"hypotheses you can say"
"i think the system lives at this level"
"of cognitive complexity and that's all"
"and and somebody else might say oh"
"you've missed the boat entirely in this"
"other problem space it's way clever than"
"you give a credit for here's my data"
"here's my experiment and so then then we"
"can we can do experiments and so now we"
"can talk about goals so uh goals in"
"development um"
"are uh what i've been what i've been"
"working on for years is to try to show"
"how the developmental"
"system and this this includes"
"development regeneration cancer"
"suppression all of these things is very"
"very uh is has has large capacity for"
"navigating that space of possible"
"configuration we call it more for space"
"it's the space if you're going to make a"
"head there are many different shapes of"
"a head and there's this space of all"
"possible configurations of the head so"
"what we've been what we've been finding"
"and people have been describing this for"
"hundreds of years but i think not paying"
"attention enough to this is that these"
"systems are incredibly capable of"
"getting to the correct region of that"
"space meaning making the correct shape"
"despite all sorts of perturbations novel"
"scenarios that they've never seen before"
"evolutionary no evolutionary novelty i"
"mean i can give you many examples"
"and so they have this amazing ability to"
"navigate that space and so and so this"
"is why i think of uh collections of"
"cells as a meaning tissues during"
"development or regeneration as"
"collective intelligence is navigating a"
"space literally again no no no excess"
"metaphors here literally"
"we can port all of the math and the"
"insights that we use to study collective"
"swarm behavior and collective cognition"
"to understand how cells work together on"
"these massive goals no individual cell"
"knows what a finger is or how many"
"fingers you're supposed to have but the"
"collective absolutely does and the"
"reason we know it does is because if"
"you're a salamander and some of your"
"fingers are cut off what will it do it"
"will regrow exactly the right number of"
"fingers and then the most magical thing"
"of all is it stops when it's done in"
"order to stop when it's done it has to"
"know what the correct shape is it has to"
"know that the delta now is zero the"
"error is very low now we can stop so so"
"in development there are absolutely"
"goals like this uh in evolution i'm not"
"sure but i'm not willing to say it"
"doesn't exist and i think we need to do"
"experiments i think it's unclear"
"actually whether that's true or not"
"i i should say by the way for everyone"
"listening please do post your questions"
"which i hope you will have and i'm sure"
"you will have at any point in the chat"
"so that we're ready to go on to them um"
"at any moment so don't you know don't"
"wait for us before you you pose them and"
"then i'll i'll turn to you to ask them"
"in turn um"
"so mike it sounds as though there's um"
"that there's a kind of a tension here"
"between the notion in development that"
"there are these target morphologies and"
"you talk about that in terms of your"
"work on you know planaria for example"
"where they find their way as you say"
"reliably and reproducibly to these"
"target morphologies"
"attention between that and the"
"plasticity that we see in living form"
"that there are alternatives and we can"
"reprogram whole organisms and we can"
"reprogram cells"
"how how does that balance play out you"
"know to what extent do we have or does"
"nature have the ability to take a"
"different path and to what extent are"
"those destinations predetermined yeah"
"yeah yeah great question um i i think"
"it's not so much a tension as much as"
"these are these two things are uh"
"exactly um uh uh"
"interdependent and and so and so uh the"
"thing the thing is that"
"evolution is"
"is not playing with a passive medium"
"where it has to micromanage all of the"
"details and and sort of figure out where"
"everything needs to go evolution is"
"working with cells which themselves used"
"to be independent organisms they have"
"their own agendas they have um various"
"computations that they can do they have"
"preferences and so what evolution does"
"is a kind of behavior shaping really"
"what evolution is really doing is pro is"
"is providing uh various signals that get"
"these complex creatures to meaning cells"
"to do what it wants them to do evolution"
"is hacking them the exact same way that"
"bioengineers try to hack them in the"
"exact same way that cells hack each"
"other in the exact same way that"
"parasites hack other organisms this is"
"all about figuring out um what is a"
"level of control over the system that"
"gets you the most bang for your buck and"
"what we've seen both as as workers in"
"regenerative medicine and bioengineers"
"uh and and uh just watching natural"
evolution
"the the most efficient way to control"
"something as complex as a collection of"
"of of competent uh subunits like cells"
"is not to try to micromanage it is"
"actually to take advantage of the"
"large-scale uh cognitive capacities that"
"these things have as a very simple"
"example you know what i what i usually"
"did say this to my students is look if"
"you've got a rat and you want the rat to"
do
"a circus trick you've got two basic"
"choices you can micromanage it meaning"
"get in there and control every neuron"
"like a play play it like a puppet and"
"that will take you i don't know how many"
"years if that's even possible to to do"
"that or you can just train the rack and"
"this is why human beings have been able"
"to train animals for thousands of years"
"before knowing anything about"
"neuroscience it's because because"
complex
"systems expose interfaces including uh"
"sensory systems including"
"bioelectrics which is what we study that"
"allow high-level controls it allow you"
"to operate not the way that we used to"
"program in the 50s where you physically"
"had to rewire things but and and the way"
"that molecular medicine is current is"
"certainly uh done today uh but actually"
"uh at a much higher level by taking"
"advantage of the intelligence of the"
"system to operate at a higher level and"
so
"what i think is going on here is that"
"all of these system cells organs tissues"
"and so on are navigating this more"
"they're navigating these spaces now"
"there are multiple spaces so there's"
"anatomical space there's gene expression"
"space there's physiological space"
"they're navigating all these things and"
"uh they have certain policies for"
"navigating them which include various"
"preferences about what they want to do"
"and various competencies things they"
"know how to do and then things that"
"stump and flummox them completely and so"
"absolutely there are multiple outcomes"
"that can happen"
"but all of that is uh by virtue of the"
"way to understand that"
"is not to try to uh try to build it up"
"at the very micro level but rather try"
"to understand what what are the policies"
"that are guiding these decisions and"
"then how has evolution an engineer a"
"parasite or again whatever it is of uh"
"affected that landscape that now uh it"
"controls the way that that the system"
"moves through that space so so just you"
"know as a simple example is our our"
"zenobots right so so what we do is we"
"you know you ask um what does the frog"
"genome know how to do well the frog"
"genome reliably uh"
"makes a a tadpole that lives in a froggy"
"environment and it's very fit for that"
"environment and things are great well it"
"turns out that that actually is so and"
"so the skin cells of those animals are"
"a kind of a passive boring"
"two-dimensional layer that sit on the"
"outside and keep out the bacteria and"
"you might think well that's what skin"
"cells know how to do and that's that"
"well it turns out that if you actually"
"liberate those skin cells from the rest"
"of the animal and put them on their own"
"and give them a chance to re sort of"
"reboot their multicellularity what you"
"find out is that their normal"
"two-dimensional passive life is just uh"
"the result of instructive interactions"
"or or or re really a kind of uh behavior"
"shaping or or bullying by the other"
"cells that's what they do when the other"
"cells are making them do this on their"
"own they do something completely"
"different they form a little creature"
"known as a zenobot it has autonomous"
"motion it has lots of other behaviors"
"including the ability to make new"
"zenobots by running around and"
"collecting loose cells which it then"
"packs into the new generation of"
"zinabots and it's amazing and that kind"
"of thing has never existed uh in nature"
"to our knowledge before it's certainly"
"never been part of the frog life cycle"
"it's it's a different way of being it's"
"a different um"
"uh set of attractors in the space of"
"possible morphologies and behaviors and"
"those cells are able to find that that's"
"that's that's massive plasticity and yet"
"in their normal environment they will"
"make a very good tadpole and a very good"
"frog and in fact if you scramble the"
"craniofacial organs of that frog of that"
"tadpole they'll you'll still get a good"
"frog because all the organs will move"
"around relative to each other and land"
"in the correct orientation and then stop"
"right so so i think this this ability to"
"um that that's the mark of a of a"
"sophisticated navigational system is"
"that is that you you can get around this"
"space but it and and you'll get to where"
"you're where you're going despite"
"perturbations but at some point you"
"might need to go somewhere else and"
"that's and these systems can absolutely"
"do it i think i think that kind of thing"
"potentiates evolution greatly evolution"
"has the speed that it does exactly"
"because of that"
fantastic
