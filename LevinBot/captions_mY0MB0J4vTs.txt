"his research into bioelectricity"
"the discussion ranges from cures to"
"cancer and regrowing limbs to potential"
"risks of Designing and building"

[Music]
"Michael Levin welcome back on the"
"podcast thanks so much thanks for having"
"me back so today I realize you've given"
"a million uh interviews recently you've"
"somehow really touched a cultural nerve"
"and so I want to give you the chance to"
"do something a little bit different to"
"the other interviews that you've been on"
"uh and so the goal today is not to focus"
"necessarily directly on your research"
"but it's more the downstream"
implications
"and so this in particular I want to ask"
"you about on on the one hand medical"
"applications so a potential cancer"
"um cures and maybe regrowing limbs along"
"these lines and then on the social side"
"I want to ask what your research means"
"you know what does it tell us about uh"
"where we are in the universe and where"
"we fit into the Tree of Life"
"okay so those are the sort of the two uh"
"main goals uh today and I thought I'd"
"start off with a question that I think"
"you'll have something interesting to say"
"on and which I have sort of been curious"
"about for a while"
"and that is um"
"so Hugh Hefner"
"he had his youngest child his last child"
"when he was something like 65 years old"
and
"as far as I know his child was"
"completely healthy and there was nothing"
"wrong perfectly normal uh boy"
"and so what I want to understand is the"
"question is"
"if aging has to do with genetic"
"deterioration you know if DNA damage if"
"that's the case"
"then how is it that old people can have"
"young children"
yeah
"um I'll I'll give you some thoughts uh"
"have it in preface this by saying that"
"I'm not actually an aging expert you"
"know my lab doesn't really work on Aging"
"so so I'll you know having said that"
"I'll I'll tell you what I think I mean"
"um one of the things to keep in mind is"
that
"to to uh development is um is really"
"robust to a lot of things and certainly"
"it's the case that there there can be"
"significant mutations that completely"
"screw up the process but there can be"
"many other changes both epigenetically"
"and genetically that don't really do"
"much of anything and I think that uh"
"apparently what what this is telling us"
"is that it's possible to maintain uh"
"germ cells in particular male germ cells"
"long periods of time without"
"accumulating enough damage that they"
"would not be fixable during"
"embryogenesis that that apparently is"
"what we're seeing I mean uh the whole"
"the whole issue of of aging and how you"
"produce young cells I mean you know"
"planaria are a great example of that"
"right because you've got these flat"
"words that as far as we can tell forever"
"produce healthy normal planarian cells"
"there's no sign of Aging that I know of"
"um so so we know in theory it's possible"
"and so I think I think that's what we're"
"seeing here in this in this case"
"on the topic of planaria so these are"
"these flatworms where you when you cut"
"them they they separate and they grow"
"new heads you can completely new organs"
"and they're Immortal is is there is"
"there a link between Immortal so what"
"what is the more precise link between"
"immortality and regeneration are they"
"separate or or can you really say that"
"they're Linked In this this sort of a"
"way yeah"
"um I it's it's it's not really known I"
"mean there are there are some very"
"regenerative organisms that do have a"
"lifespan limit so for example um"
"axolotls so axolotls are highly"
"regenerative but they they do have a"
"lifespan limit I mean in theory region"
"in order in order to regenerate properly"
"you need two things you need the"
"information of what is it that were that"
"the cells are going to build and then"
"you need healthy cells to to be able to"
"do it so I I don't know uh you know that"
"the thing with planaria for sure is that"
"they are absolute Masters at maintaining"
"the information needed to specify a new"
"worm from a pile of cells so that that"
"part they've got down and we can talk"
about
"um some some ideas for for why that is"
"uh but then they also have the ability"
"to produce these new healthy cells in"
"perpetuity I mean this is like I said"
"there's no real sign of Aging so"
"um they see you know they seem to have"
"both and I think in principle if we were"
"to solve the the if we were to really"
"solve the Regeneration problem I think"
"we would have many of the answers to"
"degenerative disease aging and so on but"
"there are you know there are these two"
"kind of issues to think about is is"
"where do the new cells come from and"
"then how does the cellular Collective"
"know what these cells should be building"
"with the planaria does do they also have"
"sort of the regular telomeres that we"
"other organisms have that get shorter or"
"do they not have that process yeah I"
"don't actually know"
"um I I don't think terribly much has"
"been done about that but I do I do think"
"that I've seen a couple papers on uh on"
"on planarian telomeres I'm not I'm not"
"up on you know on the latest there but I"
"think I think some some information"
"exists but we obviously need a lot more"
"you would think that if it were that"
"simple there would be a lot of organisms"
"making use of that right that that seems"
"like a like a fairly simple fix so uh I"
"I have to think that uh I think there's"
"more to it than that than simply"
"preventing the shortening but uh but I'm"
"not sure it's known"
"is it the case so for example if you"
"were to clone a human from say a skin"
cell
"um presumably the telomeres in the DNA"
"in that cell have you know if you take"
"yourself from an adult human presumably"
"they're shorter and so the question"
"would be you know do you also expect to"
"see a shorter life expectancy for the"
"child uh the Clone in this case or is"
"that known whether uh clones have a"
"reduced lifespan uh as a result of that"
"sort of a process I mean I think the"
"traditional way of cloning where you"
"pass it through uh in egg cell right you"
"pass the the nucleus of the somatic cell"
"through an Excel my memory is and again"
"I'm not an expert in this but my memory"
"is that that resets uh the clock uh"
"whether that would be true using the"
"kind of the newer techniques let's say"
"the yamanaga factors or things like this"
"I have no idea that might be that might"
"be a good question for somebody like"
"David Sinclair I don't know"
"hmm But so do you do you have"
"um you know you mentioned last time we"
"spoke that there were uh possible"
"um therapies for longevity that might"
"come out of your research do you have"
"any is it do you have any ideas in this"
"direction that you're able to share at"
"this point or is it too too well yeah I"
"mean the the general I can give you the"
"general the general idea the general"
"idea is that one of the things you see"
"uh during during aging is uh kind of a"
"degradation of morphogenetic information"
"that is uh cells are just not as good"
"anymore at repairing wounds at uh you"
"know that the information that is"
"necessary to for for a cellular"
"Collective to know what it's supposed to"
"be building tends to degrade"
"um some of that is likely due to a"
"degradation of the material so so"
"genetic errors and things like that and"
"some of it may be informational"
"degradation and so I suspect that once"
"we figure out uh regeneration in other"
"words we are able to communicate okay"
"with these cellular collectives and"
"program them for specific anatomical"
"outcomes by by reinforcing that"
"information I think we're going to be"
"able to"
"overcome a large chunk of what happens"
"during aging whether that will be the"
"whole story or whether something else"
"will be needed some more conventional"
"thing will be needed like the the"
"telomere the telomere business I don't"
"know most likely it'll be a combination"
"of the two approaches"
"do you suspect okay so there's a"
"combination of two approaches but do you"
"suspect you know if you were to look at"
"the difference between a young organism"
"and an old organism is that is the"
"difference primarily at the cell level"
"do you think or do you think there is a"
"large component that's really at the"
"level of organs and the creature itself"
"Isis I strongly suspect that there is a"
"larger component but I can't prove that"
"and we haven't really done work on this"
"yet so so I don't know but I'm certainly"
"hoping to to get into that in the future"
"and start to start looking at for"
"example one of the things that hasn't"
"been done is to look at uh the"
"bioelectric properties of tissues during"
"aging so we know what happens in in some"
"model species during regen during"
"development as you go from a from a"
"single egg to uh to an organism there's"
"a lot of changes in the bioelectrical"
"pre-pattern and then they sort of settle"
"down during during maturity what happens"
"after that we don't know so we actually"
"know nobody's actually done I mean"
"nobody's done a lot of this uh physiomic"
"profiling and never mind uh kind of the"
"bioelectric profiling in aging but this"
"this has to be done and it's something"
"that that we're going to do in the"
"future and then I'm sure others will do"
"too so is there uh is there a"
"possibility that you could for example"
"read out the biometric pattern of your"
"body at a young age and somehow use some"
"sort of uh therapeuticals to"
"you know overwrite at a later date and"
"reset is that the idea or I suspect yeah"
"yeah I suspect so I suspect that uh"
"reinforcing the correct bioelectrical"
"pattern uh is is something that's going"
"to be an important part of of of a kind"
"of uh aging um uh you know the strategy"
"that addresses agent yeah I think I"
"think that'll be an important part of it"
"but again this is just these are very"
"early days the real work just hasn't"
"been done on this yet"
"on so on other sort of medical"
"directions and I'm interested in so one"
"of one of the most interesting outcomes"
"of your work or at least what I find"
"most interesting is that you were able"
"to regrow uh legs of frogs"
"um and that you're working now on"
"bioreactors for mice"
"um and so I'm sort of curious how far"
"you can push this so aside from just"
"regrowing limbs or maybe organs"
"is there any possibility"
"uh in an adult in a grown animal that"
"you could for example"
"um uh here's an example so so someone"
"who's transgender if they wanted to do a"
"sex change is is there a chance that uh"
"someone like this could go through a"
"non-surgical operation uh to change"
"their sex or"
"um you know could you even go beyond"
"sort of um and look for non-human"
"augmentation so for example antlers or"
"tails or gills or something along these"
lines
"yeah I mean I I believe that down the"
"line and and so someday when we really"
"have cracked the morph of genetic code"
"when we're actually able to specify what"
"structures cellular collectives need to"
"build I think at that point you're going"
"to be able to have whatever you want if"
"you wanted antlers or a tail or whatever"
"it is I that you know that that'll be"
"someday that'll be possible now in the"
"short term what I think will be possible"
"before that is to is to trigger the re"
"um the repair and the growth of standard"
"body organs that uh that that are easy"
"to to re-specify with with uh sort of"
"sort of default or wild type patterns"
"that that's that's going to come first"
"and uh what's not known yet is whether"
"injury is an injury context is an"
"important part of that so whether"
"whether if you wanted a new structure"
"whether you would have to first create"
"some sort of injury and then once those"
"cells are in a receptive State uh give"
"them that information or whether you"
"could do it uh straight right up in in"
"the normal in a normal state is unclear"
"we we've done some examples some"
"experiments on this um one example was"
"uh well a while back when we were"
"studying um implanting eyes on the Tails"
"of tackles and this is Doug blackiston's"
"work in my group was showing that if you"
"put tails on the eyes of temples they"
"can see quite well out of those eyes"
"it's an amazing sort of thing but one of"
"the things that we worked on was"
"improving that Vision by uh increasing"
"the amount of optic nerve that comes out"
"of those eyes and so we found a drug"
"that was able to do that and we soaked"
"the whole animal in this drug and this"
"this the single optic nerve that"
"normally comes out of that eye just"
"there's like an explosion of nerve it"
"just goes everywhere and so then then we"
"looked at the normal native nerves in"
"the head because we were worried that"
"wow we're just causing massive um"
"overgrowth of all the neurons and we"
"found no differences whatsoever the only"
"neurons that responded to this were the"
"ones that were in the wrong location"
"there were the ones coming out of this"
"ectopic eye and so one possibility is"
"that in an area with no damage no injury"
"when the cells are perfect really happy"
"as far as where they are and all their"
"all their needs are met and all their um"
"their their local error estimates are"
"low and and everything's cool they may"
"completely ignore these signals and so"
"only only cells that are in the wrong"
"place or they've been injured or so some"
"in some other way stressed that they"
"start obeying these kinds of patterning"
"signals in in adulthood anyway so so it"
"may be that uh the first step towards"
"some kind of body modification or body"
"augmentation is going to be the creation"
"of a of an injury state or at least"
"faking it I'm sure I'm sure there will"
"be some way of stressing those local"
"cells uh in the in a way that in a you"
"know less invasive way that causes them"
"to perk up and pay attention and maybe"
"become more plastic and and take up new"
"information about what they should be"
doing
"I guess if if you did have to injure and"
"make an injury prior to you know growing"
"whatever organ it was that you wanted to"
"grow I mean a key thing that you'd have"
"to do is prevent scarring over to start"
"with and so there's a question that I'm"
"quite curious about which is um"
"you know human livers are really"
regenerative
"has have people looking looked into so"
"if you if you had an injury and you you"
"take liver cells and you place them over"
"the injury do you know if that promotes"
"growth and prevents scarring if people"
"looked at this sort of thing yeah it's"
"an interesting question I'm I'm not"
"aware of it"
"um maybe I I've not seen anything like"
"that we we had a little bit of a a pilot"
"project a while back trying to uh inject"
"in um implant uh actual brain tissue now"
"this was in the tadpole model trying to"
"implement brain tissue next to wounds on"
"the theory that uh it may it may make it"
"easier and we had some we had some"
"encouraging early preliminary data we"
"haven't we haven't published anything"
"yet but um that's that that type of"
"approach might might well be it'd be"
"interesting down the line we'll be able"
"to uh to mimic it with with either smart"
"implants of some sort or biodome or some"
"kind of optogenetic stimulation or"
"something like that but yeah maybe"
"one of the things that I'm quite curious"
"about is on the theory side what it was"
"that told you"
"to use this or that chemical so for"
"example you know I think from memory um"
"from last time we spoke uh you said that"
when
"um when you're looking at regenerating"
"frog legs I think it was progesterone"
"that you used to start with or something"
"along those lines and so I what I'm"
"curious about is you know what was the"
"idea what was that kernel that key thing"
"that you had that people before you"
"didn't have that pointed out that you"
"should be doing or maybe this is"
"something that might work you know what"
"what was that um key idea that was"
"missing uh before yeah the the"
"progesterone is a little bit of a of us"
"the red herring here in the sense that"
"uh it's it's it's something that we try"
"for other reasons it's not specifically"
"bioelectric and and it's not something"
"that came out of our predictive platform"
"the the way the way that we do this and"
"the way that we choose these drugs is"
"that we have a simulator and this is a"
"this is a piece of software written by"
"um Allen Center member Alexis pytek she"
"made this amazing uh simulator in which"
"in which you can you can set up a bunch"
"of virtual cells and you can say these"
"cells have these different ion channels"
"and then uh what it does is it it"
"simulates the physics to tell you what"
"the future bioelectric states are going"
"to be so if you have a simulator like"
"this you can you can sort of work it"
"backwards and ask okay that's what the"
"states are going to be but but those are"
"disease States I would like to change"
"that to uh to a different state and now"
"the question is which channels would I"
"need to open and close to change the"
"state in the way that I like so so once"
"you do that once you know which channels"
"you want to open and close and it's not"
"obvious you can't do it by just you you"
"know sort of looking at it because"
"everything is highly non-linear right"
"these chain these channels every time"
"they open and close they change the"
"voltage which changes the way the other"
"channels work I mean it's a mess so you"
"have to do the simulation"
"um once you know which channel is the"
"target then you can simply go to the"
"shelves and say okay well here's here's"
"a an hcn2 Channel what do I have that's"
"an opener of that channel and there's"
"some drugs and then in fact one of the"
"cool things about it is that something"
"like 20 of all human uh you in all drugs"
"and human use are ION channel drugs so"
"there's this massive Library already of"
"human approved electroceuticals"
"potentially that you can use for these"
"various indications what you need is the"
"computational platform and that's"
"something we're working on very hard now"
"is to improve that and to uh incorporate"
"a bunch of machine learning kinds of"
"tools so that you can actually say okay"
"this is this is the pattern that that's"
"there now and it's incorrect here's the"
"correct pattern I would like now which"
"channels do I open and close to make"
"that happen and then from there it's"
"pretty easy to pick to pick drugs so so"
"in the past that's what that's what we"
"were doing and so so just to give you a"
"simple example and this I think is uh"
"this is uh Pi's work in our group"
"um this is some I think one of our most"
"successful applications was just just"
"amazing when I saw this basically uh we"
"had embryos that uh you could treat them"
"with alcohol or nicotine or you could"
"mutate certain genes like Notch which is"
"an important neurogenesis Gene so you do"
"all these things and any of them cause"
"really severe brain defects and we"
"looked at the bioelectric pattern and"
"the bioelectric pattern which just was"
"just completely wiped out there's a"
"normal there's a normal pre-pattern that"
"tells the early brain how big it should"
"be where it should be where the edges of"
"it should be and stuff like that and"
"this was this was totally screwed up by"
"these teratogens and so and so pi and"
"Alexis made this model this"
"computational model and we said okay"
"here's here's the wrong pattern what"
"would we have to do to it to uh to make"
"it right again and the the software came"
"up with a really clever"
"um uh strategy which is that there's one"
"particular Channel called hcn2 which"
"just act it's like a contrast enhancer"
"it's basically like like a sharpen"
"filter on your Photoshop it's just it"
"just any voltage that's low stays low"
"but any voltage is a little bit High it"
"it shoots it up higher so basically any"
"compartment boundary let's say between"
"the brain and the part that's not"
"supposed to be rain if it's kind of too"
"similar it'll it'll magnify that"
"difference and it just sharpens all the"
"gradients and so so okay so hcn2 Channel"
"and so the first thing we did was to uh"
"just inject a bunch of wild type hcn2"
"channels and I'll never forget this uh"
"uh this so probably did all this work"
"and then and then he was away for a"
"while and and I was the one who scored I"
"had to score the embryos to see what the"
"outcome was and I took him out of the"
"incubator and I'm looking at these at"
"these incubate and at these channels you"
"know these embryos injected with the"
"channel and of course there has to be a"
"control the control is you have to uh"
"you have to inject the Channel with no"
"with no strategy right just to make sure"
"that that alone doesn't screw something"
"up so so of course we have that control"
"and so I'm looking at these look at"
"these embryos there's no defects but"
"there's something funny about them and"
"I'm and I'm staring I'm sitting there"
"staring at this dish trying to figure"
"out what what what what there's"
"something something's wrong and I'm very"
"used to looking at defects I mean this"
"is you know I've looked at millions and"
"millions of embryos by now so I can I"
"can recognize when something's wrong and"
"and then I and then I realize what it is"
"these embryos are too too perfect"
"they're like um normally when you look"
"at a collection of embryos uh you know"
"there's there's one or two percent"
"defects all the time just from from"
"developmental noise so so it'll be a"
"little some of them would be a little"
"wonky some of them will their face will"
"be a little too narrow somebody's a"
"little longer a little short there's a"
"range of of of malformations just just"
"you know just normally and they're all"
"they're all slightly different these"
"guys look like they came off an assembly"
"line like they look like plastic toys"
"like if you went and bought a bag of you"
"know tadpoles that were all like Stamped"
"Out of a you know out of a machine"
"that's what they look like they were all"
"perfect they were all identical it was"
"there was just no sign of anything wrong"
"and he said that is that that I I that's"
"amazing and then I and then I went in"
"the fourth scored the dishes that had"
"been uh treated with teratogen and then"
"I saw that they were far improved and uh"
"so not only does this strategy improve"
"the ones that got nailed with a with a"
"teratogen but they also help normal"
"embryos overcome the physiological noise"
"of development they're like it's like a"
"tune-up it's like a sharpening of all"
"the you know just just just just"
"sharpens all the all the uh borders"
"between all the all the um all the"
"organs and so and so it's really"
"important I like that and then and then"
"so so that was that and then and then"
"subsequently there was a series of"
"papers one just came out last week where"
"we basically used existing"
"um uh drugs that open hcn2 and this is"
"so for example Gabapentin Lamotrigine"
"these are things that people already"
"take they're anti-epileptics and so on"
"and so people already take these drugs"
"and so so we use those drugs to show"
"that you can fix brain defects you can"
"affects heart defects you can fix gut"
"defects eye and craniofacial defects"
"it's all the same just by sharpening"
"these uh these gradients and so I think"
"this is really important because 20"
"years ago when I started doing this work"
"in bioelectrics we we were doing screens"
"which means that you test the various"
"ion channels and you see what happens"
"that's how you start right just by sort"
"of poking at the at the at the edges of"
"the space to see what's possible but now"
"we're to the point where we're not just"
"screen we're not screening anymore we"
"have a we have a predictive"
"computational platform that actually"
"tells you which drugs to use I mean this"
"this computer platform actually told it"
"told us hcn2 is what you want and then"
"and then you you know you can from that"
"you immediately go to these drugs and so"
"and I have to do a disclaimer here"
"because because I have a commercial"
"interest in all of this this is um Dave"
"Kaplan and I have a company called"
"morpheuticals Inc that we that we found"
"it that's uh based on using these kind"
"of strategies to regenerate limbs to"
"repair birth defects and so on so I you"
"know I need to I need to put that out"
"there but um uh but but that's but"
"that's the strategy that's where these"
"drugs come from they come from the"
"computational platform"
"when you say the embryos look like they"
"came off a production line I wonder what"
"impact that would have say you're doing"
"this with human embryos I wonder what"
"impact that would have on personality"
"you know would you end up with um"
"uh humans that were more similar if you"
"took if you put them all through the"
"same process"
"um do you have any idea where that it's"
"it's hard to say I mean anything I say"
"here would be pure speculation but but"
"my yeah well but but my my guess is that"
"uh it wouldn't matter all that much"
"because because even once you've reduced"
"all the quote unquote defects and that's"
"a whole other thing is what exactly is a"
"defect uh you are still left with a"
"brain that's exquisitely tuned to modify"
"itself based on experience and just the"
"fact that no two humans can ever have"
"exactly the same environment growing up"
"simply by even by virtue of just having"
"different physically different"
"perspectives on the world because they"
"can't be located in the same space at"
"the same time uh I think those those"
"differences would add up and I think you"
"would have you would have you'd have a"
"lot of variability still I think yeah"
"yeah that's my guess but but we actually"
"we actually don't know it's a good"
question
"I'm curious about things like fetal"
"alcohol syndrome you know I wonder if"
"you could uh take a child who was"
"exposed in the womb to you said you use"
"nicotine and alcohol"
"um as Inhibitors uh in these tests I"
"wonder if you know after birth you could"
"you know go back in and somehow help"
"children who have been exposed in the"
"womb to you know various toxins"
"yeah I don't know I don't know what is"
"the latest uh I I think at that point"
"you're really getting into regenerative"
"therapy and especially for the brain you"
"know we've not yet gotten to the point"
"where we can get a mature brain to"
"regenerate itself so I'm not sure I"
"think at this point I think that's"
"that's farther off"
"um but but preventing those defects I"
"think is is is Within Reach and so so"
"we're doing experiments in mice now and"
"trying to make sure that this works in"
"mammals and so on"
"it prevention does that mean the mother"
"would have to take a drug or you'd"
"actually have to go in and inject the"
"embryo itself with some I don't think no"
"I don't think he would have to inject"
"the embryo I think the mother would take"
"the drug"
"okay and that wouldn't have any effect"
"on her because she's already grown and"
"this specifically uh targets the"
"channels that are active in the embryo"
"that's that that would be the idea but"
"there's a lot of work to do of course so"
"you have to get the dosage right you"
"have to get the timing right I mean"
"there's a lot of work to do here but"
"again to be clear these are drugs that"
"humans already take so there's already"
"people taking Lamotrigine and and the"
"Gabapentin for for various disorders so"
"it's already there's already a thing"
"you have a paper from last year in May"
"sometime looking at um uh it was some"
"cancer research where you'll have to"
"correct me if I'm wrong so I didn't I"
"just sort of skimmed through it but um"
"the idea was that you could take uh an"
"animal and without exposing it to any"
"carcinogens and without doing any DNA"
"damage you could disrupt the"
"communication between the cells and"
"generate cancers in the animal and"
"conversely if there was an animal that"
"already had a tumor you could sort of"
"maybe re-establish the communication"
"between cells and sort of normalize the"
"tumor is it am I understanding that"
"correctly that's pretty wild if that's"
"uh what you're able to do is yeah yeah"
"this is no this is true this is a series"
"of papers that started in 2008 our first"
"paper on this was in 2008 and the last"
"one was just a few years ago there's a"
"whole series of them and yeah it's"
"absolutely true we found out that you"
"can kick start for example uh metastatic"
"melanoma in a perfectly normal normal"
"Temple that's never been exposed to any"
"kind of DNA damage or carcinogens or"
"oncogenes or anything like that uh yeah"
"absolutely and um and then we showed"
"that uh you can you can predict all this"
"with a with a computation with a machine"
"learning model so we can we understand"
"why why that happens and then better"
"better yet we found out that when you"
"uh when you inject these tadpoles with a"
"human oncogene so nasty things like KRS"
"mutations and things like that that"
"normally cause tumors you can you can"
"you can rescue that tumor by managing"
"the bioelectrics appropriately so even"
"though the onco protein is very strongly"
"expressed you can see it"
"um you can see the oncoprotein levels uh"
"there doesn't have to be a tumor if you"
"manage to buy Electrics so that that"
"tells you that tells you a few"
"interesting things it tells you much"
"like much like with the uh with the"
"brain repair it tells you that some"
"Hardware errors are fixable in software"
"not all of them but but some of them"
"like like the notch mutation like the"
"KRS mutation I mean these are these are"
"pretty serious like I said it's not all"
"of them you know if you're missing some"
"enzyme bioelectrics isn't going to help"
"you but uh but but for a lot of these"
"things that look that that should be an"
extremely
"um powerful genetic defect they're"
"fixable in software because by providing"
"the right bioelectrical signaling you"
"can basically override the the"
"deficiency on at the biochemical level"
"so yeah so so our latest paper we are"
"now trying this in human glioblastoma"
"cells so this isn't vitro and we just"
"had a"
"um uh Juanita Matthews is a staff"
"scientist in our group just a couple of"
"weeks ago had a nice paper out showing"
using
um
"drugs that uh that humans already take"
"including some for example some acid"
"reflux drugs and things like that that"
"that uh in the right combinations they"
"uh they get the glioblastoma human"
"glioblastoma cells to stop proliferating"
"to partially differentiate to to really"
"change their phenotype yeah so and and"
"just in general it it um kind of uh"
"hammers away at this distinction between"
"the genetic information and the"
"physiological information right that you"
"you don't get everything you need to"
"know from just reading the genetics you"
"know because if you see if you if you"
"sequence that tadpole you would see the"
"chaos mutation you would say oh yeah"
"this thing's definitely going to have a"
"tumor you'd be wrong and same thing for"
"the brain defect and same thing for the"
"two-headed flatworms this is these are"
"all examples where the reality and the"
"genetic information diverge strongly"
"what percentage of cancers do you think"
"might be treatable through this process"
"is it all or is it only ones that are"
"have genetic damage or other cancers in"
"general which are at the software level"
"um there there are and there are there"
"are lots of people this is a very"
"interesting and controversial area"
"because uh if the standard story about"
"what causes cancer is a set of mutations"
"right that's the standard stories and"
"accumulated accumulated set of clonal"
mutations
"um that story has been under attack for"
"for many decades and and I don't think"
"in the end it's it's true but uh and and"
"so there are certainly ways stressors in"
"the environment that can that can cause"
"cancer that are not primarily uh"
"starting with a mutation the mutations"
"come later after the cells are are"
"stressed uh but um what percentage you"
"know and and in particular what"
"percentage are fixable and but with but"
"in the software I I don't know that's I"
"couldn't I couldn't give you a good"
"answer because we haven't done large"
"numbers we've only done a few so we've"
"looked at I don't know four or five"
"different types of oncogenes that cause"
"different types of cancer and they are"
"all fixable we haven't come across one"
"that isn't but that doesn't I'm in no"
"way claiming that every type of cancer"
"is going to be solvable this way we just"
"don't know yet"
"how these ideas sort of being received"
"by people researching cancer is people"
"sort of receptive to this sort of new"
"way of looking at things or or people"
"sort of fixing their own sort of bunkers"
"and unable to how have you found that"
"sort of interaction with researchers"
yeah
"um I mean I don't have a statistically"
"valid sample I don't take polls I don't"
"speak to you know thousands of"
"researchers I think that uh as a whole"
"the community is is kind of split is"
"split along some lines so so there are a"
"lot of people that are in that that have"
"very uh heavy"
"um incentives to stick with the current"
"Paradigm so there's a lot of there's a"
"lot of money there's a lot of"
"intellectual Capital there's a lot of"
"careers and funding uh histories and so"
"on that are really invested in this idea"
"that we are going to find some genes and"
"uh we're going to Target those genes and"
"then and then you know everything will"
"be solved uh there is a growing"
"collection of people including many"
"clinicians who are just unsatisfied with"
"where Decades of that approach has"
"gotten us clinically and that uh that"
"that that really think that"
"um there needs to be a different"
"approach but I I found that I found that"
"it's really difficult to shake uh kind"
"of molecular cell biologists out of"
"these ideas but uh people who are either"
"clinicians or they work in physiology"
"they are much more they're much more"
"receptive to it so I think all of this"
"all of this is going to uh the the"
"answer as always is in the Practical"
"applications as soon as there is a good"
"treatment that's based on these things"
"that's when the tide is really going to"
"turn and and that's fair enough"
"um and and how far away I know you said"
"this has been going on since 2008 but if"
"you have you done clinical trials in"
"human uh is it just in mice or what"
"stage are you in development yeah we've"
"um so so from 2008 to 21 it has all been"
"fraud work so this has all been doing"
"very basic science in in France I mean I"
"I've done some things in collaboration"
"with Madeleine Udan and some other"
"people in mammalian cells but and um uh"
"but but all of that was focused on for"
"our first our first humans in vitro work"
"was just published um this this year a"
"couple of couple of weeks ago and so uh"
"for now basically I the clock starts now"
"in terms of trying to uh put this out"
"into some sort of clinical application"
"so we are yeah we're we're talking to"
"people about setting up um uh in Vivo"
"trials and mice and then uh in the"
"clinical trials in humans that's that's"
"you know that's coming up um yeah is"
"Abby I'm not a clinician that this is"
"not this is not my bread and butter and"
"so you know I'm working with people like"
"Ken pienta and others to uh who really"
"know how to do the clinical work"
"but this would be absolutely amazing I"
"mean if if you could have a qf even a"
"small subset of cancers this just"
"changed lives of so many people so I'm"
"really hoping it does go uh thank you"
"yeah I do I do too this is uh you know"
"I'm I'm sort of um uh schizophrenic on"
"these things because uh you know Mondays"
"Wednesdays and Fridays I I wake up and I"
"and I think I'm a basic scientist and I"
"kind of do very basic fundamental"
"questions about life and cognition and"
"things like that and then on Alternate"
"days all I think about is how do we get"
"this into patients so that humans"
"actually benefit and it's uh it's it's"
"not always it's it's hard to um you know"
"these are these are often uh these paths"
"require different uh different uh uh"
"prioritizations you know but yeah I'm"
"very motivated to try and improve uh"
"People's Health this way"
"it's sort of as a researcher it's almost"
the
"um the perfect sort of direction to be"
"doing researching because you have the"
"the interest of the fundamental side"
"where you can ask deep questions about"
"you know what are you know what is an"
"animal what is life but then on the"
"other side you can really have genuine"
"impact I I'm sort of jealous about uh"
"how how well your research spans these"
"sort of two uh different directions that"
"really should be together yeah yeah I"
"mean I'm trying I"
"for example just look at it from the"
"funders perspective you know there are"
"there are a few the the vast majority of"
"the funders out there in the ecosystem"
"don't want to hear anything about what"
"life is what what selves are what"
"animals are you know what the basic of"
"the basis of evolution is they don't"
"hear that they want they want an uh a"
"simple clean essay that an 18-month gets"
"you to a molecule that's going to get to"
"get somewhere that you can actually do"
"uh safety you know and then an efficacy"
"trial and let's get it into patients and"
"all that that's that's where right then"
"I mean fair enough that's that's where"
"the emphasis is and then and then you"
"have a few other funders like"
"foundations who who want who are"
"interested in really big questions of uh"
"of of of life and and philosophy and"
"Science and things like that and uh yeah"
"it's it's it's really hard to balance"
"both it's it's not easy in the in the"
"setup that we have today it's not easy"
"shh I had a sort of you know knocks me"
"into a different uh topic I had a um"
"after our last interview there was a"
"comment in under the video that someone"
"left uh which was critical so they they"
"said that what you're doing is uh you"
"know they said we're not machines"
"um it's anti-life oh my God and yeah so"
"I I I wanted to I didn't respond to them"
"I also just left the coming up but I I"
"wanted to get sort of your idea on"
"you know first of all so there's a few"
"different questions that sort of come"
"out of here so first of all is you know"
"is the first point we're not machines is"
"is there a difference between is there a"
"genuine difference between plants"
"animals and machine you know is there"
"something special about biological life"
and
"um you know"
"are these categories sensible and and"
"why do we fight over them is there is"
"there a um"
"you know why why are these sort of top"
"you on the one hand you're trying to"
"help people who have cancer and you're"
"trying to help people who have lost a"
"limb and uh maybe you can one day help"
"children who have had fetal alcohol"
"poisoning you know there's all these"
"amazing applications that may come out"
where
"I can only see that you know there are"
"positive outcomes here you know what why"
"do you think that people uh get fired up"
"in this direction and do you think the"
"categories are meaningful and useful at"
"this point or are they breaking down"
"yeah I I I'll say a couple of things"
"about that um the first thing is that uh"
"look I I would bet you any amount of"
"money that that whoever this is leaving"
"that comment is a young healthy"
"individual okay I have never gotten an"
"email like that from uh from from from"
"people who are who are sick in fact I"
"get I get heartbreaking emails uh"
"basically every day uh talking about the"
"most the most unbelievable medical"
"suffering that people are living under"
"right so so children with birth defects"
"and adults with spinal cord breaks and"
"and various deformities and and and you"
"know uh somebody lost their limbs and"
"and just I mean you name it people are"
"emailing me with the most unbelievable"
"stuff uh I I I couldn't even imagine a"
"conversation between that that community"
"and the occasional people that email me"
"saying that what do you know and this is"
"you know this is too much uh this you"
"know you shouldn't right the people who"
"write this are they they would not be"
"putting these kind of ridiculous"
"comments if they had a child who had a"
"who had any kind of a disorder the first"
"thing they would do is hightail it to"
"their local uh hospital where they would"
"just pray that some somebody uh had"
"figured out what to do about it right"
"Everything Changes once you know it's"
"it's a it's a kind of an image it's an"
"immature way of thinking and Until you"
"realize how much suffering there is out"
"there that needs to be addressed with"
"these that's that's that's the first"
thing
um
"the second thing is that uh you know"
"this this issue of this issue of"
"machines uh one one thing that that"
"people never do because because if they"
"were to think about it this way with the"
"these issues evaporate immediately is"
"try to give a proper account of what"
"they mean by a machine because and if"
"you do sort of back somebody into a horn"
"and say would you why don't you explain"
"me what a machine is what they what they"
"talk about is and biologists do this too"
"there are there are papers every every"
"couple of months somebody publishes a"
"paper saying living things are not"
"machines the the description of the"
"machine that they're talking about are"
"machines from the 1950s okay these are"
"the machines are not but machines are"
"not fundamentally what these people have"
"in mind and the concept of a machine has"
"moved on whereas our limited low"
"imagination low technology version of"
"what a machine is uh has uh has in many"
"has cemented itself in many people's"
"minds so nowadays"
"uh we we Now understand that the class"
"of machines includes things that are"
"made not by humans things that are made"
"for example by other machines things"
"that are not predictable because they"
"have uh both both stochastic and noise"
"driven and also history driven Behavior"
"Uh but the machines that change their"
"own structure that make other machines I"
"mean this is but you know the the"
"machines are not what what what what"
"what we thought they were anymore and in"
"fact some people I mean touring to What"
"machines or a lot lots of people knew"
"what machines were long before"
"um long before now but but these these"
"folks have a very outdated view of what"
"of what machines are and in fact if you"
"ask molecular biologists in no molecular"
"biologist wrestles with this issue"
"because when you look down into the into"
"the uh lowest level of of cells what you"
"see are very Advanced very robust"
"versions of machines we only wish we"
"could build right and and uh with the"
"now the interesting question becomes is"
"there anything it does life do anything"
"that's unique that cannot in principle"
"be engineered I I would think the answer"
"is no I don't I've not seen any Goods I"
"mean everything that I've ever heard"
"from from people who say living things"
"are not machines are either descriptions"
"of past machines that are just"
"completely irrelevant or things that are"
"going to be obviously overcome by"
"engineering these are things that may"
"not be doable now but are certainly"
"going to be doable in the future so uh I"
"think where that leads us to is the"
"question of what kind of machine are"
"living things and I do think that living"
"things are a very special kind of"
"machine none of this is designed to uh"
"reduce the the magnificence of life or"
"or of uh or or or any of those kind of"
"things that's what people are worried"
"about I think that's what people white"
"people are stuck on this stuff is that"
"is that they think that by quote unquote"
"reducing uh life to machines we're"
"somehow going to lose the majesty and"
"the respect and and various other things"
"I I don't think there's any need for"
"that at all we did didn't what what"
"science has taught us is not that life"
"isn't a machine what science has taught"
"us is that some machines are magnificent"
"and and there's a class of mesh machines"
"that are just wondrous and worthy of a"
"moral consideration and all kinds of"
"other interesting things that's that's"
"what we're that's what science has"
"taught us that machines are a very wide"
"class and uh of of objects and some of"
"them are just amazing and those have"
"happened right now they happen to be the"
"living ones ultimately there will be"
"ones that are not living that do it as"
"well I'll I will I will also point out"
"one other thing that's kind of my"
"favorite um reply when people email me"
"about um uh with with this stuff all you"
"know well that's too far you know I mean"
"that that pacemaker I got that's okay"
"but this but this regenerative thing"
"you're doing now that's too far uh I"
"basically I send them a link to there's"
"a there's a uh there's a website that"
"describes what happened the first time"
"uh the the first time this guy went out"
"onto the Streets of London with an"
"umbrella okay that's what he had an"
"umbrella the first umbrella well there"
"was a mob right there was a all because"
"people say first of all this is"
"unnatural second of all there's an"
"inequity here how come you're the only"
"one that is going to get wet we're all"
"getting soaked and look at this guy with"
"this umbrella and they basically mobbed"
"him uh yeah that's that's that's the"
"human reaction to a lot of new um uh you"
"know to a lot of new inventions and so I"
"think we just have to be reasonable"
"about things and and acknowledge the"
"massive uh human suffering that needs to"
"be dealt with"
"I didn't think uh in this conversation"
"you'd relate your your work to the"
"development of the umbrella I think"
they're
"you didn't"
"um you know it I really like the idea"
"that um you know if you go back"
"you know hundreds of years thousands of"
"years we had this sort of idea that the"
"Earth was the center of the universe and"
"as as we developed we we sort of left"
"the geocentric picture and then we had"
"this new view the way to sort of Speck"
"in this vast sea of different"
"um you know galaxies and stars you know"
"that we're not we don't have any special"
"place in the universe and sort of in a"
"similar way it seems like"
"so when it comes to life we're sort of"
"doing a similar sort of thing where"
"we're leaving this uh maybe biocentrism"
"uh let's say and you know"
"medically the moment of death is being"
"pushed back and back and back with"
"different technology right and with Josh"
"bongard you have these xenobots so"
"robots made of living cells and I guess"
"there's artificial intelligences and"
"there's all these different interactions"
"that we're pushing out the boundary"
"how far do you think it's sensible to"
"take this you know should the definition"
"of Life depend at all on the parameter"
"space in which it exists so for example"
"um to take sort of an extreme example if"
"I built a simulation and I had entities"
"in the simulation that obeyed all the"
"properties that you say life"
"a base does that count is is that life"
"or or is that are we just being silly at"
"that point uh yeah in a serious way I'm"
"asking the question yeah yeah no it's uh"
"so so so there's there's a lot there"
"what you just said there there are seven"
"different ways to to to go there um uh"
"one thing is that I spend exactly zero"
"time trying to understand the definition"
"of life I think that to me and I and I"
"know there are people who do it and I'm"
"glad they they work on this and then"
"that's fine"
"um I'm not very interested in figuring"
"out uh what the category of Life entails"
"I'm I'm very interested in uh"
"understanding cognition and what"
"different different rungs on the ladder"
"of cognition are all from from particles"
"and rocks to all the way up through"
"humans and whatever is whatever is past"
"that uh but but I don't think that life"
"is a particularly interesting category"
"in that respect because I think there"
"are many things"
"um that are non-living that are going to"
"be somewhere on that on that axis I mean"
"life is good at uh scaling up with"
"cognition and that's and that's cool but"
"I I don't focus on on life at all"
"um with respect to you know how how far"
"we want to take it I I want to say this"
"there are many people who worry about"
"these things and they come even even if"
"they don't verbalize it this way what"
"they're what they're really coming from"
"this perspective"
"um everything's great right now and I"
"want to make sure that you scientists"
"don't screw it up okay you you know"
"don't do anything that's quote unquote"
"unnatural that's going to make the life"
"worse and whatever that was okay back in"
"the day when people used to think that"
"well the world was created uh by a"
"benevolent intelligence and so therefore"
"of course it's it's it's wonderful and"
"let's not screw it up okay we don't live"
"in that world we live in a world with"
"massive challenges incredible suffering"
"both human and and non-human animal uh"
"huge environmental challenges Evolution"
"we got here by Evolution Evolution does"
"not optimize for any of the things we"
"value Evolution does not care for for"
"your happiness it doesn't care for IQ it"
"doesn't optimize any of those things it"
"optimizes for biomass that's it just"
"different ways of staying alive long"
"enough to make the next one whether"
"you're happy or not happy during during"
"that moment nobody cares and so and so"
"that tells us that there is no such"
"thing like we have to grow up as a"
"species we have to grow up and get past"
"this idea that we are somehow in a"
"natural slash ideal State uh we are not"
"we are in a state identified by this"
"Meandering random process of evolution"
"that sort of figured out that that uh"
"this is one way to have a large biomass"
"and now as rational agents we have a"
"moral responsibility to do better than"
"the product of a random search okay that"
"that is that is that is that that is a"
"critical thing for people to internalize"
"that I think many people are not able to"
"internalize that that we are not here"
"because a benevolent Force set things up"
"nicely that we should sort of make sure"
"it doesn't get screwed up no we got we"
"got we we got dumped into a situation"
"that was the result of very complex"
"surge Dynamics and now that we know what"
"we're doing it is or at least starting"
"to it is on us to improve things and I I"
"for one find it impossible possible to"
"believe that as rational agents we can't"
"do better than Iran than a hill climate"
"search we have to be able to do better"
"than that and so uh it's it's on us to"
"figure out how how to do better and"
"that's you know that's that's kind of uh"
"that's what guides that's what guides me"
"I just I just think we have to improve"
"we have to make life better than the way"
"we found it"
"so which direction do you think we will"
"go in along these lines and I mean so to"
be
"to flesh out the question"
"you know usually as a technology"
"advances our ethics and morals change so"
"for example"
"um with industrialization automation"
"people argue that we got rid of slavery"
"um you could also argue that um women's"
"rights is tied to sanitation and the"
"development of the pill I guess and"
"maybe when we have I don't know um"
"artificial meat maybe we'll get rid of"
"factory farming and this sort of thing"
"what do you think the"
"moral shift will be that comes along"
"with you know if we're able to engineer"
"beings engineer new humans engineer you"
"know what Consciousness is and what life"
is
"do you have any picture of"
"this this might be too General so if"
"it's too General I can I can drill in"
"deeper but do you have an image of how"
"our morals and ethics will ship shift"
"with these developments yeah"
"um I I I I have some things to say about"
"that uh well you know the the one of the"
"biggest technological changes and again"
"I'm not a futurist I don't know anything"
"about what exactly is going to happen"
"these are just sort of my thoughts on it"
"um I I think I think one of the one of"
"the biggest shifts that's that's going"
"to come at some point is the development"
"of a quote-unquote free energy so so at"
"some point when energy is no longer an"
"issue and when we have the ability you"
"know with with if if you have unlimited"
"energy you can make almost anything"
"right it's it's just an energy intensive"
"but you can make almost anything at that"
"point that will be a a radical shift uh"
"in in in in human uh Human Society"
"because because that will basically do"
"away with all the scarcity uh Dynamics"
"so all the things where we come now now"
"there will still be there will"
"regardless of anything else that will"
"still be the rare individuals that are"
"psychopaths or whatever who their needs"
"can only be met by inflicting whatever"
"on on other people but the vast majority"
"of issues we have has to do with"
"scarcity of various types and a lot of"
"it a lot of it which would shift or go"
"away if that just wasn't an issue"
"anymore now whether we're going to"
"survive as a species to that point or"
"we're gonna you know meet some sort of"
"um uh untimely demise before that I have"
"no idea but I think I think that is"
"going to trigger a massive change that's"
"just you know everything up until now"
"all of the things that you've talked"
"about all the limitations you know"
"whether everything was about uh limited"
"limited resources and various struggles"
"for those resources right I think that"
"at some point that's going to go away"
"and what happens after that I'm I'm not"
"sure but but the the other the other"
"shift in in uh in in in ethics um that I"
"think is coming is that we are"
"uh and I think this this has already"
"started and I think we're going to see a"
"lot of it in our lifetime uh"
"we are going to be surrounded by beings"
"um you can call them agents most"
"generally agents that um"
"are nowhere on the Tree of Life as we"
"know it in other words they will have"
"none of the familiar touchstones that we"
"use to recognize where morally something"
"is something sits right so so in the"
"past if if you encountered a new a new"
"uh system and you wanted to know what do"
"you owe it morally you could come over"
"and you could tap on it you could just"
"sort of sort of tap on it and if you"
"heard a metallic clanging sound you"
"would you would make conclusions you"
"would say ah this came out of a factory"
"it uh has it's it's a simple machine it"
"um and and I'm morally um uh uh fine"
"with taking it apart and using it for"
"spare parts and or seeing what what"
"makes it tick or whatever right whereas"
"if you do this and you get this sort of"
"like soft like like like"
"um you know sound like like and you feel"
"it's kind of furry and warm you say ah"
"this is an evolved system uh I need to"
"be nice to it uh uh maybe I can eat it"
"but if it's only slightly different I'm"
"going to jail if I mess with it so we're"
"a little weird you know Society is is a"
"little weird about those things but but"
"in general you realize that that a note"
"you would say that in those cases okay I"
"need to be nice to this to this thing"
"now though those um those criteria what"
"is it made of and how did it get here"
"being evolved or designed those are not"
"going to survive the next decade or two"
"because because that's out the window at"
"this point with with biorobotics with"
"with human cyborgs with um uh hybrids"
"and uh and all kinds of biotechnology"
"never mind aliens that's a whole other"
"thing if there is an exobiology to be"
"studied that that's a whole other thing"
"although instructive even though it's"
"not real yet"
"um with all of these Technologies uh any"
"combination of evolved material meaning"
"DNA cells tissues designed material"
"meaning meaning"
"um smart materials um various engineered"
"artifacts and software any combination"
"of those is some possible agent and so"
"we are going to be surrounded by these"
"things and uh knowing how to relate to"
"them is going to be impossible by just"
"looking at what are they made of and how"
"they got here now science fiction"
"authors of course have this Peg 100"
"years ago where they said you know they"
"put us in these situations where you"
"know you're sitting around one day and"
"the spaceship lands on your front lawn"
"and this thing sort of trundles out and"
"it kind of hands you a um a poem about"
"how happy it is to meet you and all that"
"and and then what do you do because it"
"kind of looks metallic but you already"
"knew that if it came from another planet"
"you wouldn't expect it to have a human"
"style brain or human cells or maybe even"
"carbon you know you wouldn't expect that"
"anyway and so and so here it is and so"
"now what what are your what are your"
"criteria for figuring out how to relate"
"to this thing are you can you put it to"
"work in your house can you take it apart"
"can you can you be friends with it could"
"you marry it could you maybe like what"
"can you do with it"
"um you know what is your relationship"
"and I think that's really uh important"
"we don't have a good handle on it you"
"see you've seen recently all these um uh"
"debates about whether whether modern AI"
"is is sentient or things like this I"
"mean people don't find their terms"
"properly anyway but but the key thing"
"from all these debates is that everybody"
"has really strong feelings about it but"
"nobody States their criteria so"
"everybody says that's not it's you know"
"it is or it isn't but nobody says here"
"here are the five criteria you have to"
"meet in order to for me to uh to to to"
"feel like I have to be kind to it and"
"because nobody knows what those criteria"
"are everybody you know at this point"
"everybody says well uh the touring test"
"is not enough just because these large"
"language models write beautiful pros and"
"answer questions and do all these things"
"that's not enough okay well that's not"
"enough what else Anatomy doesn't do it"
"because looking for the human brain is"
"silly because we you know that that"
"can't be the only way to do to do"
"intelligence in the whole universe so"
"that's not right so so what is it how"
"are we going to decide these things so"
"so that is going to be a massive shift"
"once we once we start and you know um I"
"think uh I think the uh again just just"
"going back to sci-fi I think that um the"
"popular kind of vehicle that got this is"
"the closest is something like that that"
"iconic Cantina scene in the first Star"
"Wars where it's just like everywhere you"
"look there's some crazy kind of thing"
"inside half of them are on Wheels and"
"you know and and doing various things"
"and there's C-3PO and there's uh you"
"know weird looking aliens like that"
"that's the world we're going to be"
"living in every combination of of"
"technology and biology is going to be"
"around and we are going to have to"
"figure out how to relate to things that"
"are not on this uh Tree of Life remember"
"remember the tree of life is an N of one"
"here on this earth right we've got"
"literally one way that life has has"
"shaped itself how much you know how how"
"what do we tell our students we tell our"
"students that you can make you can draw"
"a lot of conclusions from an end of one"
"or that you can test your theories about"
"biology from the same set that generated"
"those theories that's all we had that's"
"all we've had up till now these natural"
"um these natural"
"um uh beings so so we really until until"
"the synthetic sort of Revolution comes"
"up we've been fooling ourselves in"
"thinking talking that uh you know and it"
"was bad enough with Darwin right Darwin"
"Darwin gave us a single Continuum he"
"said he said look we are not different"
"from the animals there's a single"
"Continuum and that was like whoa you"
"know massive societal upheaval that'll"
"be that'll be Child's Play compared to"
"what's actually coming it's not a single"
"Dimension it's a huge multi-dimensional"
"option space of beings that we are going"
"to have to figure out how we're going to"
"relate to them that that's that's the"
"major um ethical upheaval that's that's"
coming
"I sort of worry that we're not so we're"
"not evolved at all to deal with this"
"sort of the thing right there's where we"
"empathize with things that have faces"
"that look you know human or that are"
"furry but there's no way that we're"
"prepared to empathize with something"
"that's completely alien to us and so I"
"sort of worry that um we're naturally"
"going to be causing a lot of suffering"
"going on down the line I'm gonna I'm"
"gonna um you're right we are we are"
"definitely not involved to recognize"
"intelligence in other spaces so for"
"example bacterial metabolic space"
"um morphogenetic space yeah we're not"
"good at recognizing intelligence in"
"these spaces but but one thing I want to"
"I want to push back on is that um in my"
"experience while while adults who have"
"all kinds of theories about what should"
"and shouldn't be in in our um you know"
"sort of uh insulted by by thinking that"
"they might be machines and all this kind"
"of stuff adults have issues with this"
"children take off take up uh and young"
"young students in fact you know young"
"adults who are in robotics who are in"
"bioengineering they don't have any"
"problem with this you know kids kids"
"will kids will uh take up take up a"
"friendship with a with a some kind of a"
"robot no problem they don't they don't"
"have any of these preconceptions because"
"because fundamentally our our cognitive"
"system is is primed to try to estimate"
"agency in the outside world right where"
"we have to know if you're going to"
"survive you have to know the difference"
"between a mouse and a in a rock in terms"
"of what are they going to do later on"
"and uh I think I think children will"
"have zero problem with with any of this"
"uh raised raised another environment"
"they're going to find our uh questions"
"and our battles over this completely"
"quaint and uh someday I I think some"
"someday it will be it will be ridiculous"
"it will be um you know I don't know I'm"
"blanking on a good on a good analogy but"
"you know when you when you think back to"
"some of the things that that uh that"
"that people argued about in the past you"
"know in the Middle Ages and you're like"
"oh my God that's that's you know that's"
"just ridiculous that that's how that's"
"how they're gonna uh that that's how"
"future Generations are gonna about us do"
"you think the question I was going to"
"ask is you know when when is turning off"
"the machine murder but following what"
"you just said it might be a completely"
"different question you know there might"
"be something that's you know"
"I know there might be something else"
"that machines don't like us doing to"
them
"um you know that's equivalent to what we"
"see you know the question"
"yeah the questions that we're asking now"
"might just be as you say Child's Play or"
or
"um quaint sorry"
"um do you have a picture though uh"
"you know if I was to ask that you know"
"when when is switching off the machine"
"murder like where Where is the"
"that boundary well I I want to re I want"
"to remind us of a couple of things first"
"of all um murder is it is an extremely"
"high bar we don't we don't start with"
"murder we you know when you when you"
"when you find your when you find your"
"kid um uh uh you know pulling the Wings"
"off of a fly it's a problem and you talk"
"to them about it but it's not murder"
"right and so we already know that that"
"there's a collection of you know don't"
"don't don't don't don't pet the cat like"
"that he doesn't like it or versus uh you"
"know that that's already we already have"
"those conversations long before uh long"
"before murder and so uh that's so that's"
"that's one thing we gotta we gotta get"
"straight another thing is that"
"uh you know people are people are really"
"um worried about um creating these new"
"intelligences oh my God what happens if"
"we create a"
"um you know a a sentient being look we"
"create new very high level intelligences"
"all the time it's called having children"
"we do it all the time we do it we do it"
"constantly we do it without as as"
"Dennett would say competence without"
"comprehension we have no idea how we do"
"it we don't have a good theory of that"
"anybody agrees on on how to raise these"
"children many of them don't get the care"
"uh that you would think is required to"
"make a to make a a being that's going to"
"be a productive member of society uh we"
"do this all the time and without really"
"a good understanding of and so so just"
"think about it every every moment of of"
"every day there are incredibly"
"intelligent uh beings being produced let"
"loose into the world with some sort of"
"training I mean they talk about oh you"
"know you train the kid on the you train"
"an AI on the internet and it soaks up"
"all kinds of crazy stuff what do you"
"think what do you think a lot of the"
"kids worldwide are being trained on you"
"know they're being raised in these"
"abominable environments that and then"
"and then they and then they're let loose"
"into the world with human level"
"intelligence and who knows what the and"
"you see some of them do incredible"
"beneficial things some of them do"
"horrible you know so horrible things and"
"war crimes and whatnot uh that that has"
"already been with us forever right the"
"making making high level intelligence is"
"that you do not control that you don't"
"know how to train for positive uh"
"outcomes necessarily that's been with us"
"forever so so so this is this is exactly"
"the same uh and any parent knows I mean"
"I I think I think parenting is um a"
"really uh really valuable uh uh training"
"for anything related to to Ai and things"
"like that because you know right away"
"when you get as little you try to you"
"try to encode some rules and you say hey"
"uh lying is bad and then they"
"immediately you know tell the truth in"
"some some horrible embarrassing context"
"that make somebody feel bad and you say"
"nah you should have lied I said well"
"what's the you say all right well look"
"and then and then you sort of try to"
"make a rule then you realize that the"
"rule that you can't make a rule and then"
"you sort of just try to give them meta"
"rules and and then you you you you"
"calibrate them on some cases and then"
"you hope in the future that that they"
"figure out how to do things that make"
"you proud that's it that's that that's"
"right that's that that's we we know that"
"it's very hard to to control this even"
"uh even in the most basic case and so uh"
"you know what's the right way to do this"
"I don't know I'm certainly not uh going"
"to claim that I've come up with any"
"solution to this or that I have the"
"solution to an ethical system of the"
"future I don't but I think but but I'll"
"just sort of just for fun I'll sort of"
"take a stab at it uh I think the the"
"Golden Rule and it's sometime in the"
"future the golden rule is going to be"
"something like be nice to goal seeking"
"systems it's going to be something like"
"that it's going to be figure out what"
"degree of Competency you're dealing with"
"and to that level of competency"
"be be kind and uh and um uh you know"
"sort of show compassion to systems in"
"proportion to their to their level of"
"gold directiveness that is some"
"something like that but but this is you"
"know this is amateur outright I mean I'm"
"hardly uh in a position to be able to"
"formulate something like that but but"
"that's that's where I think this is"
"going it's okay to bat above your pay"
"grade I I was uh I would say uh one of"
"the key things that um you know if"
"you're trying to come up with a rule I"
suppose
"what you're really trying to do is help"
"the child empathize with other people"
"that's sort of what you're saying I"
"suppose and"
"one of the things I find quite curious"
"is um"
"you know when it comes to empathy humans"
"are really good at empathizing with one"
"person or a small group of people"
"um you know we see on the news some"
"person was murdered or we see something"
"horrible happen to people and we really"
"feel it sort of viscerally"
"um but then at the same time if you hear"
"that you know in some battle 5000 people"
"were killed or a million people were"
"killed it's just a number and we don't"
"we don't have this there's no"
"proportionality to the way we empathize"
"with groups of people who are suffering"
"and and so I I guess the question I want"
"to ask is um"
"you know if you wanted to define a super"
intelligence
"or or you know if you wanted to define"
"something that was like superhuman let's"
"say uh or or human does it have to do"
"with its ability to uh empathize with"
"other humans is is that is that the key"
"yeah that's you know I'm glad you you"
"asked that that's somebody asked me that"
"uh on on another interview a few months"
"ago and I I thought it was very"
"interesting question about what what is"
"exactly a human right because uh I mean"
"okay if you're an anatomy class there's"
"one answer but I don't think that's an"
"interesting answer is it is it the"
"genome no I think that uh you can you"
"can change out the genome and it doesn't"
"really matter is that the anatomy no"
"someday we'll be living underwater or on"
"you know on on some other planet and"
"we'll all be look different what's a"
"human to me to me a useful definition of"
"human is a a level of uh compassion"
"exactly it's a moral term it's a moral"
"uh capacity it's a level of compassion"
"exactly as as what you just said it's"
"it's it's where is your linear range for"
"being uh exhibiting care for others this"
"is for for other sentient beings and so"
"so let's let's think about it this way"
"we know that um when you go to court"
"there's a notion of diminished capacity"
"right there's there's some there's some"
"some model of what level of things can a"
"typical human care about and if you"
"don't have the wherewithal to exert that"
"level of care maybe you were on maybe"
"you were uh had you know some kind of"
"brain damage or whatever but but you"
"just you just don't have the wherewithal"
"to to to exert that level of compassion"
"then then we know that uh you're not"
"responsible in the same way that your"
"standard issue human might be"
responsible
"just like there's a diminished capacity"
"there's also enhanced capacity so"
"someday there will be creatures who and"
"they will be superhuman in an important"
"sense not because they can lift things"
"or or you know be more resistant to"
"germs but they will be superhuman in an"
"important sense they will be kind of"
"like what's described in some for"
"example in the Buddhist literature where"
"you might have a being that is literally"
"capable in the linear range of caring"
"about millions of other beings or maybe"
"all of them right in the same way that"
"you and I managed to exert care over the"
"two or three or five people in our"
"families like like literally like that"
"they will have this massive linear range"
"where where when when something happens"
"to to a thousand people that's here and"
"then when it happens to a million people"
"that's literally a thousand times more"
"more worse for them which which we"
"cannot we cannot Muster that right we're"
"not a humans aren't able to Muster that"
"so so so I think we have to be we have"
"to realize that there's this um"
"uh there's this uh Spectrum or or"
"Continuum of of moral concern and uh we"
"are occupying some sort of narrow band"
"on it and and we've seen many times how"
"we fail and and for various reasons but"
"we can also do better than what we're"
"doing now and someday there will be"
"creatures that do way better they just"
"have the capacity both both the IQ and"
"and other aspects of of cognition where"
"they can literally care about uh many"
"more things and and beings that we can"
"so that's that's you know we can only"
"aspire to that"
"um but uh but that's that's we we you"
"know we need to be looking upwards and"
"that's that's what's what's there"
"it makes me think you know clever people"
"say that um"
"you know we if if there was a super"
"intelligence you know you shouldn't"
"worry that it's going to be evil the"
"real problem is that it might be"
"ambivalent you know it'll think of us"
"like maybe ants or something but after"
"what you said just then I wonder if the"
"real danger is that we create something"
"that has some moral prerogative that we"
"don't understand or can't possibly"
"understand and that it does something"
"that we don't want it to do because"
"we're not you know at that moral level"
"let's say yeah it's a real problem but"
"but let's not pretend this is a new"
"problem where a picker picker pick a"
"horrible Tyrant throughout history right"
"that's done terrible things and"
"significant things you know somebody"
"really impactful and ask yourself"
"whether their parents have this in mind"
"when they when they give birth or"
"probably not right maybe maybe sometimes"
"but but generally probably not so so we"
"already have have lots of experience"
"with it throughout history of creating a"
"very high level intelligence that's"
"really good at just wrecking things off"
"or horribly right we're very we're we've"
"already had examples of this so so so"
"yes I think it's a it's a definitely a"
"problem I think that um"
"there's no guarantee that an advanced"
"intelligence by itself I don't think"
"intelligence by itself is a guarantee of"
"benevolence it's not a guarantee of"
"empathy by itself although I think there"
"is a relationship there"
"um I think it's very hard to to become a"
"really good intelligence without being"
"able to take on others perspective but"
"but but but as with humans there are"
"failure modes that lead to the"
"sociopaths and things like that so so"
"for sure I think it's possible to create"
"high IQ uh um uh beings that that are"
"just terrible to have around but that"
"that problem has always been with us I I"
"don't know what the answer is I'm just"
"pointing out that this is not the first"
"time we're running into this this has"
"always been the case maybe a better"
"example is I guess the internet in some"
"way is like a super intelligence right"
"and you have outrage mobs that do all"
"sorts of crazy stuff that so maybe"
"that's a better example I I I'm"
"wondering um"
"you know I asked this question to my"
"last guest as well"
"um it might be appropriate here"
um
"you know"
"where you it's sort of normalized that"
"um we have children and some someday"
"you'll die and your children will will"
"take over and and"
"I mean it's sad that you'll die but this"
"is sort of normal we don't grieve the"
"fact that there's going to be a new"
"generation that just takes the world in"
"a completely different direction do you"
"think let's say for example we did"
"create Life 2.0 or whatever it is"
"whatever you want to call it we expand"
"the you know we no longer have this"
"one-dimensional thing we've got a"
"two-dimensional space or whatever the"
"dimensions of the space are"
"do you think we should view you know if"
"there are no longer humans a thousand"
"years from now but there's whatever"
"follows us should we think of that"
"should we we be sad about that or is"
"that just the next should we view it the"
"same way that we view our children"
"taking over"
"yeah it's an interesting question I mean"
"I guess I guess the first thing I would"
"say is uh much like with telling people"
"to calm down you know that's never"
"worked ever right and I think telling"
"people what they should and shouldn't be"
"sad about um probably doesn't doesn't"
"work either so so I think people will be"
"sad about whatever they're going to be"
"sad about I'm not sure if there's any"
"any way to to change that but uh"
"for myself I mean I I think I think what"
"you have to do is you have to sort of"
um
"divide up the the the categories and ask"
"yourself okay let's see if uh the people"
"of the future have different DNA do I"
"care well some people are super into DNA"
"these are the people that are all about"
"like like a paternity and you know and"
"you know does this person have exactly"
"my DNA and based on that I'm going to"
"decide how I'm going to treat them I"
"mean I find it hard to Fathom but okay"
"so some people are super into DNA um but"
"most people not you say I don't care"
"what DNA they have that's not really and"
"then and then you say well uh will you"
"care what you know will you be sad if"
"they are you know much more resistant to"
"disease and some of them have gills and"
"and they can do all kinds of cool stuff"
"that you can do no I'm not really sad"
"about that I I want my kids to be able"
"to do things I never could do right so"
"that's okay uh and then you might say"
"all right well what if what if they're"
"um what if they're super intelligent"
"yeah great I always wanted my kids to be"
"smart and you say well what if what if"
"they're so intelligent that they think"
"everything you've ever done is stupid"
"and I'm gonna say okay that doesn't"
"exactly make me happy but I'm probably"
"not going to be sad about it because"
"yeah that's progress right right that's"
"that's that's just how it is we you know"
"we hope the next Generation does better"
"so you sort of run down each of these"
"things and you ask well what exactly you"
"know if they don't look like us at all"
"is that and I don't I'm not really tied"
"to this particular primate you know sort"
"of form is that you know what will and"
"and so what does make you sad so so"
probably
"uh if they were to lose if they if they"
"were to lose uh uh the The Compassion"
"aspects of what it means to be human"
"that that would make me sad that would"
"just you know personally but I think"
"everybody can sort of the best you can"
"do is is divide it up and figure out"
"which of these things do you really feel"
"sad about right what what is really the"
"thing that you hope continues I mean I"
"don't really care you know we're a"
"particular kind of um you know primate"
"uh do I care that that's what goes on no"
"but but I would like them you know"
"whoever follows this I would like them"
"to to have the at minimum the same"
"hopefully more level of compassion and I"
"would like them to be doing interesting"
"things in in understanding their world"
"better they want once they've checked"
"those two boxes I I lose the ability to"
"be sad for it"
"um these sort of questions really mess"
"with your sense of self actually if you"
"follow because I mean as you said at the"
"beginning Evolution doesn't care about"
"intelligence or your happiness or"
"anything like this so it could be that"
"you know I give you a time machine you"
"go without you know millions of years in"
"the future and your director Senate is"
"like a fish or something yeah yeah um"
"and then the question is would you eat"
"that fish if you were hungry but um I"
"I'm I realize you have to go pretty soon"
"so I'm I'm gonna wrap up"
"um with two very sort of like questions"
"um and then there's a third one if you"
"if if we've got time but um"
"so I'm just curious just in terms of"
"getting grasp on more of your"
"personality really it's not it's not"
"really anything you need to stress about"
"in terms of the science side"
so
"one of the things I like about what"
"you're doing is is it's sort of like um"
"you know you're you're looking sort of"
"like behind the magician's trick somehow"
"like you're sort of uncovering why it is"
"that uh Evolution works right you need"
"these agential materials which is true"
"anyway yeah you're trying to is it was"
"so you're looking at uh why it is that"
"evolution is not so fragile you know if"
"we didn't didn't have agential materials"
"maybe Evolution wouldn't work at all"
"um and and you're so the question that"
"I'm curious about is"
"for you"
"when you uncover the way the magician"
"does it so to speak do does it become"
"less exciting for you or or you know"
"where does the joy uh do you have the"
"same level of Joy"
"um once you've discovered something does"
"it become more vibrant to you I'm just"
"curious about uh you know just yeah"
"uh well two things first just uh just in"
"terms of uh practicalities I have never"
"come across a case both in my own work"
"and other people's you know when I read"
"science books about the things other"
"people have done uh I have I've never"
"come across a case where after you see"
"how something works it it seems less"
"wondrous than before it's always more"
"amazing it's always more amazing right"
"you see you see something wow that's"
"amazing that it happens and by the time"
"you learn all the things that are that"
"that are here in our universe that makes"
"that work you're you're 10 times more"
"amazing oh my God now here here are now"
"20 other things that need explaining"
"because because it's just incredible"
"that this that this works in certain"
"ways so I've never I've never found"
"anything that where the answer is oh"
"well now that I say now I realize that"
"some people have had this experience"
"I've had this I've had this said to me"
"um I gave a talk once uh at a at a top"
"institution where somebody said to me"
"afterwards um well uh I I really like"
"the first part of your talk about"
"bioelectricity and it's seemed amazing"
"but then in the second half of the talk"
"you showed how it works you showed the"
"mechanism and now and now I don't care"
"anymore and I you know that that because"
"now that I see where how it's done it's"
"just more chemistry and physics I said"
"what did you think was going to be"
"underneath you didn't think it was going"
"to be chemistry and physics underneath"
"like what what else would it possibly be"
"I I that that view is on a different"
"planet than I am as far as I'm concerned"
"but but but to me uh I once you"
"understand all the things that come"
"together to make something possible"
"that's I I've never seen that be less"
"less wonderous I just might I'm I'm just"
"I'm I'm unbelievably odd every time I"
"come into the lab I see I see things and"
"people you know my folks here show me"
"things on a weekly basis that blow my"
"mind in a way that makes me much happier"
"than it was before I knew how it worked"
"so so no I think I think the Wonder just"
"just goes up as as you go along"
"with my own research I never actually"
"get to the end of the question you know"
"I whenever I work something out there's"
"always as you say 10 more questions yeah"
"but you know and by the way that's"
"that's not a universally"
"um uh kind of a desired trade either"
"I've had I had a paper once where uh the"
"negative comment one of the reviewers"
"hated it and the comment was well this"
"paper this paper brings up 10 new"
"questions then then it answered and I I"
"you know you have to laugh and cry at"
"the same time you go I mean yes fair but"
"I kind of thought that's what we were"
"doing here"
"did was it rejected uh uh you know if it"
"eventually it eventually made it but but"
"that person was very clear that he he or"
"she wasn't looking for for new questions"
"they wanted one one thing neatly sort of"
"wrapped up and hopefully that would be"
"the end of that and you know and then so"
"on again I don't I don't get that view"
"but but some people have that"
"so then what makes you excited about the"
"future so so when you when you look at"
"your research and where it's going and"
"and you know what the dream is moving"
"forward what gets you excited"
"uh with two two basic things I mean I I"
"believe I I hope and believe that we are"
"going to make an impact on patient"
"Health this is this is just something"
"that uh I've wanted you know I I've"
"wanted to do since uh since I was very"
"young this this idea that there are"
"people around who are not able to reach"
"their full potential that are living"
"with suffering of all kinds and just"
"because of ignorance because of our"
"ignorance because we don't know how to"
"fix stuff and when you look when you"
"look back and you're like oh my God"
"throughout history how many people had"
"to go through horrible things and if"
"they just had some penicillin or if they"
"just knew that to wash their dang hands"
"or whatever whatever it was these things"
"seem so stupid now it's so much needless"
"you know or or or or you know splinting"
"bone you know bone breaks and things"
"like that it's just ridiculous how much"
"um suffering there was because of"
"ignorance because we just had no clue"
"what we were doing and so I feel like"
"that's where we're at now uh of course"
"and uh the thing that makes me"
"incredibly excited is a vision and and"
"who knows if I'm able to contribute to"
"it or not but but someday I firmly"
"believe we will be able to fix pretty"
"much any medical issue because of this"
"once we understand how it is how what"
"what communicating with cells and"
"tissues really entails not not trying to"
"micromanage them with with symptom"
"relief but but literally communicating"
"to to reset the health State um and take"
"advantage of the intelligence of the of"
"the of the collective of cells uh we"
"would be able to fix almost anything and"
"that that is just and and then and then"
"you can really be a proper human when"
"you're not spending your day figuring"
"out what do I do because I can't do this"
"and that because I feel old or something"
"hurts or whatever those are all"
"distractions you know we should all have"
"a a a health span that enables us to"
"reach our full creative potential and"
"I'm very excited about that the other"
"thing is I'm also so that's getting them"
"on a practical level uh the other thing"
"is I'm really excited about uh growing"
"up as a species so so we can we can"
"really dump these old categories that"
"were kind of consequences of limitations"
"of imagination of Technology things like"
"evolve versus design Machine versus"
"organism you know intelligent versus"
"just physics it's stuff like that we are"
"close to being able to dump all that"
"stuff and that's just it's painful it's"
"going to be painful like like you know"
"like finding out there's no Santa you"
"have to sort of re-re um you know"
"readjust your uh your view of of how"
"things work and that wow Someday I'm"
"gonna have to buy somebody presents whoa"
"like like right it's like it readjusts"
"your your world view a little bit but"
"that's okay uh and and we'll be in a"
"better place for it when we really"
"understand how much sentience there is"
"uh around around us I think we just have"
"to grow up and and uh and do that I'm"
"you know I'm excited about that in the"
future
"well Michael Levin it's been a pleasure"
"having you back on the podcast thanks"
"for coming on so much yeah thanks for"
"the conversation it's been fun"
