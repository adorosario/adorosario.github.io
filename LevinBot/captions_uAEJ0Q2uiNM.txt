"so good morning everybody today what I'd"
"like to talk to you about is our efforts"
"on cracking the morphogen edit code and"
"to think about why this March for"
"genetic code is important we need to"
"think about how remarkable bodies are in"
"terms of editing their own shape and all"
"of these problems birth defects which"
"are errors of initial patterning"
"traumatic injury cancer or the defection"
"of cells from the anatomical plan and"
"even aging have one fundamental thing in"
"common what they have in common"
"is a failure of the ongoing control of"
"complex anatomical structure and so in"
"in embryonic development all of us start"
"life as a collection of early"
"blastomeres and then through embryonic"
"development we acquire this tremendous"
"shape so here here you see this"
"cross-section through a normal human"
"torso and what you notice is an amazing"
"increase in the amount of anatomical"
"complexity to go from here to here now"
"these processes can sometimes go awry in"
"which case you may have a tumor that"
"still contains individual tissues hair"
"teeth skin and so on so cell"
"differentiation is crucial but not"
"sufficient for obtaining this kind of"
"pattern and so we really need to"
"understand where the information is that"
"drives complex patterning past embryonic"
"development we have a number of"
"organisms that are telling us a proof of"
"principle that full regeneration as"
"adults is possible here are planaria"
"which are flat worms that have this"
"amazing property you can cut these guys"
"actually in any direction that you want"
"they will regenerate every piece of"
"these orbs will regenerate exactly"
"what's missing no more no less and they"
"stop when they're done not only that we"
"showed recently some work that these"
"these planaria actually keep their"
"memories through complete brain"
"regeneration they know - they are able"
"to resolve their tumors when"
"regeneration is activated and there's"
"actually no sign of aging at the level"
"of the organism so individual cells"
"senescent die but the animal continues"
"to regenerate itself and so it's"
"practically immortal so this is the"
"result all of these amazing features of"
"the result of this animal having"
"incredible pattern control over every"
"piece of the organism"
"now regeneration is not only for"
"so-called lower organisms we have"
"vertebrates such as these salamanders"
"that can regenerate their limbs their"
"eyes their ovaries their jaws their"
hearts
"so on and of course even deer which are"
"adult large mammals can regenerate a"
"tremendous amount of bone up to a"
"centimeter and a half of new bone growth"
"per day when the antlers are being"
"regenerated and of course the human"
"liver is known to be regenerative so"
"fundamentally this kind of process where"
"a complex structure is amputated and"
"then regenerate is asking asking us to"
"solve several several problems first the"
"relationship of pattern to the genome"
"that is where is the information stored"
"and processed such that we are able to"
"restore from damage and then as"
"engineers we ask the question how far"
"can we push shape change that is what"
"patterns are possible to obtain given a"
"particular genome so these kinds of"
"these kinds of processes both the"
"standard embryonic development where"
"everybody starts at the same starting"
"state and then reliably reaches one of"
"these complex morphologies or in fact"
"very plastic events such as this where"
"for example you can take a tale of a"
"salamander attach it surgically to where"
"the limb goes and over time this"
"structure will remodel itself into a"
"completely new structure that's more"
"appropriate to the large-scale anatomy"
"so this of course is a process that"
"starts in a very aberrant state and yet"
"manages to reach the correct final goal"
"so how much of this is locked in or"
"fully determined by the DNA and what are"
"the evolutionary implications of this"
"kind of plasticity so we think of we"
"think of this as a closed loop pattern"
"homeostatic process whereby a set of"
"gene regulatory networks create proteins"
"these interact then through emergent"
"processes you have complex shapes but"
"there's a feedback loop where both at"
"the level of gene gene expression and at"
"the level of physics there is correction"
"going on that continuously tries to get"
"back to this anatomical state despite"
"unpredictable perturbations and there's"
"a fundamental theorem in cybernetics and"
"control theory which says that every"
"good controller of a system and this is"
"an extremely good controller of this"
"system because for example every"
"regenerating limb is exactly the same as"
"the original limit every good control"
"over system must be a model of that"
"system and so if that's true then"
"there's a counter paradigm idea that we"
"could follow which is that bodies might"
"be able to store this model of the"
"pattern and thus be able to represent"
"an anatomical set point that is every"
"kind of homeostatic process has to"
"fundamentally store a set point towards"
"which it fixes and so and we call this"
"set point the target morphology and if"
"that's true then we could do several"
"things we could target this control"
"system we could rewrite the set point"
"and then we could let the cells build"
"towards that plant and in our in our"
"Alana discovery Center at Tufts this is"
"what we've been working on I want to"
"show you why this is important this is"
"to just to briefly mention two very"
"fundamental problems that are still with"
"us even in the age of genomics so here"
"here Aplin area and the thing about"
"planaria are that they've largely"
"reproduced by fission and regeneration"
"so each worm tears itself in half the"
"head and regrows a telltale regrows a"
"head and now you've got two planaria"
"what this means is that in this process"
"they escape Weissman's barrier that is"
"if they acquire somatic mutations"
"mutations somewhere in the body of the"
"organism that doesn't kill the organism"
"and happens in one of these Nia blasts"
"or stem cells that mutation is"
"propagated to the next generation now"
"this is not true for us if you have a"
"mutation in your arm the offspring don't"
"automatically get it"
"but with planaria they accumulate"
"mutations over time and so despite"
"hundreds of millions of years of the"
"somatic inheritance where they"
"accumulate mutations in fact the genomes"
"are very messy these worms are mixed"
"deployed that where the cells don't even"
"have the same number of chromosomes so"
"they accumulate all of this stuff and"
"despite that after after many millions"
"of years they still regenerate with 100%"
"anatomical fidelity so here we have an"
"interesting distinction between what's"
"going on with a genome versus what's"
"going on with the anatomy and in fact"
"unlike mutant lines which you can find"
"in other species for safa less yell"
"against Mouse you can get lines of"
"species with with with various"
"patterning problems there's no such"
"thing except our two-headed worms which"
"I'll show you in a minute"
"there are no patterning mutants in"
"planaria these guys are incredible at"
"keeping their shape despite this this"
"destabilizing process it is not well"
"understood at all the other issue that"
"isn't understood is if we try to make a"
"prediction of what happens when we take"
"stem cells from a flat-headed worm and"
"mix them in the same body with stem"
"cells from a round headed worm we let"
"them sit there then we amputate the head"
"what kind of head shape will result the"
"interesting thing about this thought"
experiment
"is that despite all of the work on"
"molecular genetics of stem cell"
"differentiation we don't have even the"
"beginnings of a guess of what to predict"
"here because none of the existing models"
"address a fundamental question how do"
"the cells know when to stop and what"
"pattern causes regeneration to cease"
"okay and this is this is simply simply"
"unknown and so these these are the kind"
"of issues that are required for us to"
"understand and so we really need to get"
"up the algorithms how do cells make"
"these decisions what are they measuring"
"in in understanding what shape to make"
"and when to stop so in in in a computer"
"science way of looking at things it's"
"it's it's clear that there's an extra"
"revolution in biology coming and so we"
"thought about what key insights allowed"
"computer science to drive a revolution"
"what was it about early early computer"
"science that really impacted every"
"aspect of our lives and I think to to"
"arguments can be made that the first"
"really important thing is the"
"distinction between hardware and"
"software and a focus on the control of"
"information not just the materials and"
"so this is how people used to program"
"computers you really have to be down in"
"the hardware you were literally moving"
"wires around and and then of then"
"eventually through price through such"
"little progress in the field we got a"
"machine code which was still pretty"
"close to the hardware but certainly"
"better than this and so now we have"
"these these these top-level"
"object-oriented languages that allow you"
"to think about the information flow in"
"the computation of the problem and not"
"really worry about the hardware as much"
"and I think that in biology we are still"
"very much at the machine code level"
"everything we do is is is largely"
"focused on understanding how to"
"manipulate individual molecules where I"
"think what we really need to also"
"understand is the algorithms and the"
"decision making among among cells and to"
"gain control of the computation that"
"living matter performs in making"
"decisions such as when and how to"
"regenerate or restore or repattern large"
"anatomical regions so if we really"
"understood what was how these things"
"work we could not only defeat these"
"major biomedical problems but we could"
"also of course create new biological"
"constructs and and also make important"
"additions to robust robust robot"
"technology so what I want to do now is"
"give you two updates on our work at the"
"epicenter that"
"arrest some of these some of these"
"issues and these are the members of our"
"NewsCenter two of my colleagues Kelly"
"McLaughlin and Dave Kaplan are here with"
"us and two stories I'd like to update"
"you on first has to do with our efforts"
"to identify novel inputs into patterning"
"that is what are the sources of"
"information for patterning and this this"
"involves a story recently that came out"
"of our Center on the brain as the first"
"functional organ in development what we"
"basically found is that here you're"
"looking at a very early frog embryo this"
"is this is about two and two or"
"two-and-a-half days of development so"
"very very early on what we found is that"
"the the very early brain in this animal"
"long before there's any behavior or"
"anything like that it is absolutely"
"required for patterning events"
"throughout the animals so for example"
"you can see what happens here where's"
"basically what we did is amputate the"
"early of the early brain and in the"
"absence of the early brain the animal"
"continues to develop what we see really"
"characteristic defects in innervation in"
"muscle patterning and and several other"
"systems this this brain is is having an"
"important padding role at considerable"
"distance and then what we found was that"
"we could actually largely restore not"
"entirely but largely restore both the"
"muscle and the peripheral innervation"
"patterning by judicious Mis expression"
"of appropriate ion channels and certain"
"neurotransmitters so there's this"
"influence of the brain that's required"
"for patterning to proceed and to some"
"extent that can be compensated by"
"interventions that that we apply and so"
"this this was really remarkable for a"
"number of reasons first of all the brain"
"is appears to be the first functional"
"organ this and this occurs even before"
"the heart starts beating it instructs"
"pattern at long distance so every part"
"of the embryo is actually receiving this"
"influence the brain does this while it"
"itself is being constructed we showed a"
"couple years ago that in determining how"
"big the brain should be it's receiving"
"input from the rest of the animals so"
"the rest of the animal is is its"
"electrical properties are influencing"
"growth and patterning of the brain while"
"this this device is being put together"
"it is already functional - in fact in"
"this sort of complex lu2 pattern the"
"other organs and the other interesting"
"thing that we found is that the brain"
"protects the body from teratogenic"
"influences and what I mean by that is"
"that drugs"
"that normally do not cause any sort of"
"teratogenic problem they don't affect"
"development in embryos without a brain"
"they cause terrible problems so so the"
"the presence of the brain is able to"
"protect the the rest of embryogenesis"
"from specific teratogen and so this the"
"the next steps for this process is of"
"course to try to use this asset in a"
"gain-of-function way to see if brain"
"implants can improve regeneration and"
"repair in various contexts to see if we"
"can mimic brain activity with targeted"
"interventions and design better screens"
"for understanding to rival genesis"
"because it it appears to not be true"
"that you can simply sort compounds into"
"the classes of being a teratogen or not"
"being a teratogen because whether or not"
"that occurs has is is really determined"
"by what's going on physiologically in"
"the in the embryo the other thing I"
"wanted to talk to you about is our"
"efforts in non neural bioelectricity so"
"the the brain uses ion channels and"
"electrical synapse is known as gap"
"junctions to drive the electrical"
"activity that is the substrate of the"
"software of the brain the activity and"
"so here what you're seeing is an act of"
"zebrafish brain as as the fish is going"
"through its its cognitive programs and"
"there there are these these efforts in"
"neuroscience on neural decoding so the"
"idea that you should be able to read out"
"these electrical patterns and then from"
"that using some sort of computational"
"pipeline extract the information content"
"in this case you know what what what"
"images this is this person thinking of"
"so it turns out that in the rest of the"
"body we have something very very similar"
"that is all cells not just nerve and"
"muscle have ion channels they"
"communicate with each other through"
"through these electrical synapses and"
"what you're seeing here this is an early"
"frog embryo this is a movie originally"
"made by Danny Adams in our group and"
"what you're seeing here are all the"
"electrical conversations that these"
"cells are having with each other as they"
"determine which ones are going to make"
"which organs and we think that the"
"information encoded in these electrical"
"states represent pattern pattern"
"organizational influences that are going"
"to be required both to make the animal"
"in the first place and then to repair it"
after
"damage so it turns out that"
"bioelectricity is not something that"
"showed up when brains evolved lots of"
"cells use electrical signaling this is"
"an ancient well conserved signal here"
"you can see one one single cell"
"undergoing some very complex behaviors"
"as it hunts for for its food and"
"basically it's it's the case that brains"
"co-opted many of their tricks from far"
"more ancient usage of electrical"
"circuits throughout the body so what did"
"tissues think about before they became"
"brains using this strategy and what"
"tissues thought about was their own"
"shape they thought about the shape of"
"the host in which they located they"
"processed information and there's a"
"tremendous amount of parallelism between"
"the way that electrical circuits are"
"used to process information in the brain"
"and in the rest of the body"
"now we developed molecular tools to be"
"able to direct and characterize these"
"states and so here you see a normal pre"
"pattern in this early early embryo where"
"each one of these little circles is one"
"cell that cell drives its voltage"
"potential using channels in the membrane"
"and so you can see this complex pattern"
"across the anatomical scale or you can"
"also detect pathological States this is"
"some of our work detecting tumors as and"
"their aberrant signature of by"
"electrical signaling before the tumors"
"actually appear so the way we"
"functionally manipulate these in these"
"networks we do not apply electrical"
"fields what we do and here's a typical"
"cell network this might be an epithelium"
"or a set of um as n Comeau cells"
"whatever we have to two basic options we"
"can control the electrical synapses so"
"we can either open or close the"
"electrical communication among the cells"
"using either genetic or pharmacological"
"means so we can control the topology of"
"this network so this is basically"
"analogous to synaptic plasticity or we"
"can go in and directly using either"
"either optogenetics or other two other"
"tools directly control the voltage"
"states of individual nodes in this"
"network and so our strategy to rewire"
"these circuits is first to"
"computationally model the whole of the"
"whole circuit I'll show you how we do"
"that and then to try to decode their"
"pattern semantics and then to try to"
"alter these patterns in vivo using"
"either target channel targeting drugs or"
"light and then"
"to try to actually alter the outcomes of"
"this patterning process that's driven by"
"these electrical circuits and in the"
"past we've had applications and birth"
"defects regeneration and tumor"
"reprogramming I'll give you one simple"
"example this is a attempting to induce"
"regeneration in an animal that normally"
"does not regenerate its limbs so here's"
"a frog normally you cut off the leg 45"
"days later you either get a spike or"
"nothing and so we came up with a"
"cocktail that basically resets the"
"electrical properties of the stump to"
"that of a developing early frog and so"
"what that does is it kick-starts the"
"whole process so you've got some toes"
"you've got a toenail the leg actually"
"ends up looking quite quite quite"
"respectable here with the respective"
"width in terms of its patterning and you"
"can see here that it's both touch"
"sensitive and motile so a complex"
"physiological state can kick-start all"
"of the downstream patterning modules"
"that it requires to build this leg note"
"that we did not have to do"
"micromanagement of every piece of this"
"we didn't have to say here's where the"
"nerve goes here though whether the blood"
"vessels go here's where the bone goes"
"and so on there's a very modular process"
"the same thing actually can be seen here"
"this is an early example of turning a"
"portion of the gut into a complete eye"
"and this again is a very modular event"
"once you induce an eye eye specific"
"state here the system does the rest the"
"cells basically build this eye without"
"us without us having to understand"
"exactly how to micro assemble a leg or"
"an eye and so one way that we're"
"thinking about this is just different"
"from the from the sort of current"
"assumption which is that the DNA is is"
"often thought to be the software and"
"then the cell is kind of the hardware"
"that reads it I propose a different view"
"which is that what the DNA does is it"
"specifies the hardware the DNA tells you"
"which ion channels each of your cells"
"get to have but once you have those ion"
"channels there are complex electrical"
"dynamics that go on that are somewhat"
"akin to information flow in things like"
"flip-flops where the where the physical"
"structure is set but the information is"
"stored in the pattern of energy movement"
"through the system and that is how"
"computer memory stores information that"
"these these events here are up for grabs"
"in an important sense that we can go in"
"and intervene at this level alter the"
"physiology and and and and reach"
"outcomes that are not"
"trained by the underlying hardware so"
"one example of this from from our birth"
"plan area showed that we can we can cut"
"off the head we can we can alter the"
"network topology of the resulting"
"fragment and as a result cause this"
"thing to grow heads that are either flat"
"like this P Felina or round like this s"
"Mediterranea and literally get it to"
"build heads that are appropriate to"
"other species now this is not only in"
"terms of head shape this they also get"
"the the shape of the brain and the stem"
"cell distribution appropriate to these"
"other species about 150 million years of"
"difference between them and this is"
"despite the fact that the genomic"
"sequence is untouched there's nothing to"
"know it is there's no genomic"
"reprogramming that goes on here this is"
"a purely physiological effect and you"
"can see that from the same genome you"
"can actually derive shapes of quite"
"different quite different species and in"
"fact you can go further and you can you"
"can make flatworms don't even have to be"
"flat you can make flat worms that look"
"like little little spiky hedgehogs or"
"little cylinders or in fact leave the"
"plane of the sort of more or less"
"two-dimensional a body plane of this"
"worm and produce these these tube"
"structures on top so what's what's"
"important from these examples is that"
"the bioelectric Network and redefine"
"Anatomy without having to alter the"
"genomic sequence and we then ask the"
"question of well how about basic body"
"plan at least at least this surely the"
"number of heads an animal has is set by"
"the genome and so the the the mainstream"
"way of thinking about this predicts that"
"if you if you if you made a two-headed"
"flat worm which we can make by altering"
"the the by electric signaling between"
"this between the two wounds then if you"
"leave it alone for a couple of weeks and"
"you amputate this AK topic tissue and"
"also the primary head and you just take"
"this normal gut and you culture that in"
"plain old water given the normal the"
"wild-type genomic sequence what you're"
"going to get surely is a single headed"
"worm and if I'm here telling you about"
"this because that's not at all what"
"happens what happens is that in"
"perpetuity if you keep doing this once"
"you've shifted the the stable attractor"
"of this electrical circuit to a 2-headed"
"state this thing will continue to"
"regenerate in water with no further"
"manipulations despite a normal genomic"
"sequence so we"
"here that a target morphology of the"
"species or the shape to which it repairs"
"upon damage can be permanently re"
"specified by altering the information in"
"this electrical pattern memory now why"
"do I call it a pattern memory this is a"
"very recent story that just came out"
"from our group which shows that what you"
"can do is you can take worms that are"
"perfectly normal in their Anatomy so so"
"head and tail"
"they're also normal in their molecular"
"histology so the head marker is here the"
"head marker is not in the tail and so on"
"so there's nothing molecular ly wrong"
"that we can detect in this worm and yet"
"this worm is going to give rise to a"
"double head and this worm is going to"
"give rise to a single head now why is"
"that it what what what could be"
"different about it and it turns out that"
"what we can do is rewrite the electrical"
"pattern in this mature adult animal such"
"that you can see here this is this is a"
"1:1 head of oldish pattern this is a"
"two-headed voltage pattern we can we can"
"change the the electrical APRI pattern"
"but notice that this is not reflective"
"of what's currently happening in the"
"animal this is a perfectly good one"
"headed anatomically normal planarian"
"what this is is a latent memory this is"
"a an electrical pattern that will become"
"active if the animal is cut later on"
"until that happens they stay one-headed"
"and everything is fine if they get cut"
"they consult this this electric circuit"
"and they end up making two heads so the"
"same physical body can representations"
"of distinct outcome future states that"
"arts going to acquire once once it is"
"cut so so so so we think that there are"
"significant parallels here between the"
"way that electrical networks store"
"memories and make decisions in"
"neuroscience and and that we may we're"
"making some connectionist models towards"
"that end but the other very important"
"thing is to make really clear"
"computational models of how this works"
"and so we're in the process of now we're"
"in the process of doing that this is a"
"new new paper that just came out with"
"the next version of our modeling tool"
"our modeling tool allows us to take"
"realistic electric circuits from data"
"that we know are from proteins that are"
"operating in the worm in our"
"physiological data it makes it makes a"
"fully specified computational models of"
"regenerators process and from those"
"models we're trying to"
"derive state-space models like this that"
"explain why any given circuit has"
"particular attractors that drive it to"
"stable to head one head or in fact no"
"head states so this is an important"
"effort for us to synthesize from"
"molecular for molecular information to"
"physiological tissue wide information to"
"full scale full full Anatomy wide"
"understanding of where these large-scale"
"features come from and so the second"
"story I want to talk to you about is how"
"we drive these kinds of these kinds of"
"advances towards hopefully some sort of"
"practical biomedical application and the"
"the arc that we try to follow here is to"
"identify the endogenous bioelectrical"
"pattern that is involved with some sort"
"of oregon that we care about to build a"
"computational model of it to test and"
"refine the model and then use that model"
"to extract predictions and when we can"
"extract predictions we can also identify"
"candidate treatments or interventions"
"that drive the system to a particular"
"state and then of course we want to"
"demonstrate efficacy in some model"
"system so the application I want to show"
"you has to do with the Frog brain and so"
"so here's the early frog brain being"
"developed and what was discovered is"
"that the early frog brain has this very"
"characteristic voltage pattern here and"
"in fact and and and here it is if you if"
"you move across from left to right here"
"it's got these these sort of depolarize"
"and edges and then this hyperpolarized"
"bit in the middle and when you expose"
"this animal to various teratogen what"
"will happen is that you collapse this"
"interesting gradient so that everybody"
"is up here when that happens the brain"
"is is terribly malformed you get these"
"these really bad malformations but if"
"you try to hyperpolarize this thing"
"naively let's say let's say two here"
"every cell goes to here this is just as"
"bad ok and it makes perfect sense"
"because it's not simply that every cell"
"is that sum this is at the same voltage"
"you actually need this this pattern for"
"correct brain morphogenesis to occur and"
"so what we were able to do was to use"
"this computational model to understand"
"where the electrical differences between"
"this middle portion and the edges are"
"coming from and then come up with a"
"specific set of existing ion channel"
"drugs and these are drugs already"
"approved for human use in various"
various
"occations but what the model does is it"
"tells you exactly what you have to do to"
"drive the voltage to a particular"
"pattern that you want to see and so when"
"you do that here's a normal front brain"
"you see forebrain midbrain hind brain"
"here's in the case of the teratogen the"
"forebrain is very very shortened the"
"eyes are touching the brain there's"
"significant malformations here and in"
"fact on top of this you can apply a"
"couple of the drugs actually one at a"
"time that was that was identified by"
"this by this model and you basically"
"rescue not only the anatomy of the brain"
"but also the gene expression and the IQ"
"of these tadpoles on the temples do have"
"an IQ you can measure their their"
"learning speed and so on and they"
"actually get their get their behavior"
"back the other really interesting thing"
"is that this is not only for chemical"
"tirado genesis these are animals that"
"are that that are miss expressing a"
"dominant mutation and knotch"
"so notches are really important or a"
"genesis gene and when they when they"
"have this mutation you can see compared"
"to a normal brain you can see here that"
"that their brain is really really quite"
"quite screwed up and so even on top of"
"this really debilitating mutant"
"phenotype you can by putting in"
"appropriate ion channels you can rescue"
"again the entire anatomy of the brain"
"molecular molecular markers and also and"
"also their behavior so this is an"
"example of using and targeting these by"
"electrical states to overcome either"
"chemical tirado Genesis or in fact a"
"really really dominant genetic mutation"
"so what we're doing now is trying to put"
"together a predictive simulator that"
"would allow us to take existing ion"
"channel expression data from from from"
"other workers where where we now pretty"
"much know what ion channel is every"
"tissue in the body has from our work on"
"cracking the bioelectric code we try to"
"understand what vmm pattern is desired"
"so let's say for brain patterning for"
"limb patterning for all kinds of other"
"anatomical features and then what we"
"would do is is is use the simulator as a"
"way to predict and design cocktails of"
"existing ion channel drugs that could be"
"applied leveraging the differential"
"expression of ion channels throughout"
"the body to try to rescue appropriate"
"pre pattern such as this early face"
"pattern where you get to see where the"
"eye is going to go"
"mouths and so on so the idea is that"
"we're working on this kind of predictive"
"platform for suggesting ion channel drug"
"interventions for specific uses and so"
"one of the nice things about these"
"models and we also have some some"
"interesting machine learning approaches"
"to make it easier to do that once once"
"these kinds of networks are developed"
"they can be interrogated to find this"
"kind of needle in the haystack this is"
"our our work showing that in the"
"transition from normal pigment cell to"
"melanoma there are very very specific"
"choice points that can be that can be"
"identified that can be targeted to drive"
"body wide outcomes and this is this is"
"this is an example of using both machine"
"learning and our by electrical a"
"modeling platform to identify specific"
"interventions that will let us let us"
"have the really rare rare outcomes and"
"so to finish up in summary what I want"
"to tell you is that in Dodge's by"
"electric circuits control gene"
"expression and anatomy and that the"
"activity of these circuits can be"
"targeted there their function can be"
"rewritten to alter species default"
"outcomes either so patterning or through"
"gene mutations and so on that new"
"computational and biophysical approaches"
"are now coming online that will allow us"
"to rationally target decision-making on"
"the tissue and whole body level and I"
"think this opens many opportunities for"
"addressing birth defects degenerative"
"disease aging injury cancer and so on"
"and I also think that the major"
"transformative advances in this field"
"require us not only to understand the"
"mechanisms the molecular mechanisms by"
"which these things work but also the"
"computations that cells an important"
"more importantly tissues perform to make"
"decisions about what they should be"
"doing so that we can alter these"
"decisions so I would like to thank the"
"people who contributed to this work and"
"of course the Paul Allen frontiers group"
"for funding and I leave you with a"
"picture of our two-headed planaria which"
"have been called impossible objects"
"because these guys arise from a a"
"genomically wild-type animal cut in"
"plain spring water so thank you I'll"
"take questions"
"Michael in your model of bio electrical"
"fields being the software on the nucleic"
"acid encoded hardware are you looking at"
"what presumably is small gradient field"
"effects on the actual cellular machinery"
"to be a symmetric or polarized or make"
"micro decisions to set up these larger"
"morphogenic kinds of changes how are you"
"going about that if at all yes yeah"
"absolutely I don't have just for reasons"
"of time I didn't bring all that stuff"
"here but we can talk about this after"
"it's basically what happens is that in"
"the model it small local changes"
"percolate up okay and so you do start"
"with with with localized cell level"
"changes that Pirkle up into large-scale"
"decisions where the cells coordinate"
"with each other"
"one of the things the by electric layer"
"is very good at it is for coordinating"
"cell activity across large areas and so"
"both in the case of brain development"
"cancer some of these other examples what"
"happens electrically in one part of the"
"body has a massive influence on another"
"part and so our goal is to understand in"
"both directions we need to know what's"
"happening at the cell level drill down"
"which we've done we understand the"
"transduction machinery to some extent"
"what genes at downstream but also to go"
"upwards and understand the large-scale"
"decision-making that this enables"
"because the things that we're talking"
"about often cannot be decided on a"
"single cell level these are these are"
"these these these networks are making"
"decisions about things that are that are"
"large right and so and so propagating"
"that information up is crucial so I'm"
"like I love you so most of what you"
"showed us could be explained by the I"
"mean I couldn't agree with more that the"
"DNA is basically the the set of tools"
"and not a code for how to make it animal"
"and it's but the so most of what you"
"showed us could be explained by the fact"
"that you could rewire the circuitry of a"
"cell into a sort of a stem cell state"
"starting with the sort of softer"
"bioelectric aspects which then feed to"
"the nucleus or change gene expression"
and
"cells then reprogram themselves into"
"stem cells are in a regenerative"
"capacity to recreate the the"
"pre-existing pattern and then you"
"basically have sort of tissue wide"
"morphogens and so on it's you know"
"classic developmental things"
"the only challenge to that idea would be"
"the fact that you create this"
"double-headed worm and it completely so"
"what do you think I mean is this really"
"the Jeff's question what do you think is"
"happening there because the issue is"
"that you you know you sort of you have"
"to create cells that are in a stem like"
"state in order to generate other cells"
"and give rise to different types of"
"types of these cells but at the same"
"time they've got to sort of follow a"
"different plan so to speak and it's not"
"clear to me where that type of"
"information where that type of plan"
"would be would be and maybe you just"
"didn't touch upon sure yeah right I I"
"simply didn't go into detail I can I can"
"you know we could we can talk about this"
"offline there there's two two important"
"things in what you said the first is the"
"issue of stem cells I'll just talk"
"briefly about that it is true that let's"
"say in culture with human stem cells"
"that same exact you know stem cells you"
"can use by electrical properties to"
"control specific stem cell"
"differentiation this is true in our"
"particular example in the case of the"
"Frog there really are no that's that's"
"not the case the Frog does its tissue"
"renewal so every cell makes more of"
"itself we don't there's no reversion"
"back to a stem like state in the Frog in"
"the plenary it's sort of the opposite"
"planaria have these adult and neoblasts"
"stem cells that are like thirty percent"
"of the animals they're always there and"
"again we have no evidence that we're"
"making new stem cells it's it's it's"
"literally the stem cells are doing the"
"thing it's as you said it's the plan"
"that the stem cell progeny have to"
"follow and this is actually an issue for"
"all of our processes because simply"
"having specified what cell types you"
"have right you it's not sufficient"
"there's a next step which is how do you"
"organize all this stuff so the worm is"
"the model where we we best understand it"
"and basically what we have now is a"
"model in which the information at least"
"let's say a very simple example head or"
"tail priority is literally stored in the"
"electrical circuit I'll draw it for you"
"afterwards that you could literally draw"
"the electric circuit in a way that you"
"stable such that the cells on one end"
"and the other are getting different"
"information and that when you alter that"
"it will it will keep you can think of it"
"as a flip flop the easiest the easiest"
"way to imagine it is a flip flop because"
"it has two stable states and the other"
"stable state is such that it will"
"propagate to the other end such that"
"both ends are head like so okay okay can"
"I quickly follow up on that so you"
"mentioned at the beginning the idea of"
"these bizarre genomes that these animals"
"have and you said despite those genomes"
"you can make a wild type animal my"
"question is are the incredible"
"regenerative capacities and sort of you"
"know new plans that these animals can"
"store not so much happening despite a"
"bizarre genome but because of the"
"bizarre genome is zero is there a way to"
"go about testing that is it to what"
"extent does genomic instability and"
"somatic mutation propagation actually"
"contribute to the regenerative cats a"
"great question I show that problem"
"precisely because I think it's a"
"fundamental interesting problem and"
"nobody has an answer to we no one knows"
"I mean we're making models now of"
"basically interacting cells in the same"
"body that have different genomic"
"information it's it's a wide open field"
"it's it's not discussed at all never"
"mind solved so I really love the idea of"
"the the self-propagating organ organ"
"genesis and beautiful elegant studies"
"with the planaria i one thing though I"
"wonder about though is when you jump to"
"say mammalian systems or other other"
"systems why you focused specifically on"
"the ion channels person per se because"
"you could imagine the same"
"self-propagating system occurring with"
"epigenetic changes with transcription"
"factors with with other sorts of other"
"sorts of events which are self"
"propagating in the same way and perhaps"
"you know fit into the mold but not ion"
"channels and in fact most of the"
"literature on on at least human"
"morphogenesis would would point towards"
"some of those other other things and if"
"but it just to challenge you a bit I"
"guess is is if the electrical signaling"
is
"so important in a mammalian system I"
"mean one might see this in you know"
"chronic electrical stimulation which was"
"going on all the time with pacemakers"
"with it with it so there's there"
"actually are kind of lots of"
"interventions that are already being"
"used and one could predict that that"
"they would cause long-term changes and"
"and at least to my knowledge it may be"
"that maybe it hasn't been tested but"
"it's it's it's it's unclear if that"
"occurs sure okay two to two great"
"questions there the one question has to"
"do with I'll take the second one first"
"about what what is what is the evidence"
"for for the importance of this in humans"
"and and what about the electrical"
"stimulation so the kinds of electrical"
"stimulation that occur in the most"
"common medical use so let's say"
"electrical stimulation for you know"
"muscles and wound healing and things"
"like this are generally not the kind of"
"stimulation that will interact with this"
"system rapid rapid spiking whether it be"
"through through a magnetic system or"
"through controls of a peripheral nervous"
"system that kind of rapid spiking is"
"generally not anything that's going to"
"directly affect the system there is"
"however a whole body of data on a"
"different type of exposure to human"
"beings have which which supports these"
"these kinds of ideas and that is the"
"tirado genesis by channel modifying"
"drugs so a lot of the drugs have"
"actually modified these kinds of these"
"kinds of events are in fact origins and"
"are in a pretty dangerous both in in"
"let's say immuno rat or mouse models and"
"humans so you would not expect to see"
"this with a kind of stimulation you know"
"magnetic field exposure none of those"
"things really alter long-term"
"steady-state electrical properties of"
"cells but you do get this from from"
"certain kinds of drugs that interfere"
"with this with this system the other"
"interesting question is why focus on"
"bioelectricity as opposed to chemical"
"gradients so I certainly don't mean to"
"say that chemical signaling systems are"
"not important absolutely they're"
"important and all of these things that I"
"talked about are no doubt the result of"
"cooperation between electrical chemical"
"and physical forces pressure stress"
"strains tensed tensions and so on all of"
"these things are important the reason we"
"focus on bioelectricity is because"
"electricity is"
"have remarkably well-suited for things"
"like memory and decision-making and the"
"reason is more so than diffusion I mean"
"I've seen I've seen people create"
"specific circuits out of diffusing"
"molecules and it usually ends up a very"
"you know very very fancy paper in nature"
"and so on precisely because it's"
"extremely difficult to do this"
"electricity is I think evolution"
"discovered very early on that for the"
"same reason that we we make computers"
"and so on electrically as opposed to"
"through chemical diffusion is that it's"
"much easier to process information that"
"way and specifically what I mean is a"
"voltage-gated channel or a voltage gated"
"gap Junction is a voltage gated current"
"conductor this is this is in effect a"
"transistor it means that using using"
"circuits made of those things you can"
"easily build up to almost any kind of"
"computational process that you want and"
"could could somebody make models of all"
"this stuff that that that purely were"
"with diffusing morphogens possibly I'm"
"not going to say it's impossible but I"
"have to see it first you know to judge"
"that whereas I think this is a really"
"attractive all control system I think a"
"lot of the decision making do you think"
"about artificial neural networks right"
"the the really show you how Marie and"
"decision-making can be implemented by"
"electrical networks and then of course"
"they work together with with all of the"
"with all the chemical grades last"
"question in the situation where you took"
"the plain area and change the head shape"
"or structure does that propagate and"
"that is either by cutting or from the"
"progeny right yeah that one does not"
"propagate so what happened so unlike the"
"two head state which is permanent that"
"one does not propagate and what happens"
"with that is they regenerate the head"
"appropriate to some other species they"
"sit there for about 30 days and at the"
"end of 30 days they suddenly something"
"suddenly kicks in where they they just"
"say women this isn't right and they will"
"remodel and go back to their original"
"state so that one that effect does not"
"propagate do you have any sense of why"
"that memory comes back or why you can't"
"cause it to persist have you guys yeah I"
"we don't are our best models are for the"
"head tail this is a nod for the head"
"shape we don't have a great model yet"
"for the head"
"but we do know one thing that's a little"
"bit similar to that which may give a"
"clue if you take a in the in there was a"
"classical data that people would take a"
"tale blastema from a salamander and they"
"would want to know whether that thing"
"becomes a tail because it's locally"
"determined or not and they would attach"
"it to the to the flank of that"
"salamander and the data were that in the"
"short term that thing makes a tail and"
"so you would say okay it's locally"
"determined but then over the coming"
"months it would eventually remodel to"
"the more correct pattern so that so it"
"seems like so maybe and this is pure"
"conjecture maybe what we have here is a"
"two-phase process where there's almost a"
"short-term and a long-term memory that"
"are distinct right but we really don't"
"understand that mechanistically at all"
"and so after after we get through really"
"analyzing the 1head 2head thing we're"
"gonna we're gonna turn our attention"
"today thank you very much"
[Applause]
you
