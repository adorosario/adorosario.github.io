"front that i'm not a clinician i'm a"
"basic scientist in fact originally a"
"computer scientist and uh more recently"
"a biologist and so what i'm going to say"
"today are things that are one"
"perspective on the cancer problem not"
"claiming this is the only perspective uh"
"the many other things are important but"
"this is this is one thing i think we"
"should be paying attention to"
"and if you want to contact me or want"
"any of the primary data that goes with"
"all of the the things that i'm going to"
"go over today you can reach me at these"
"two at these two websites and everything"
"is there so the summary of today's talk"
"are basically the following points this"
"is what i would like to get across"
"the first is that i'd like to focus on"
"the question of um why is there anything"
"ever other than cancer okay why why is"
"there an alternative because i think"
"that's actually a deep question and i'm"
"going to argue that uh"
"there that one important way to look at"
"cancer is as a disruption of networks of"
"cells cooperating towards large-scale"
"goals and what are these goals these are"
"goals of organogenesis of histogenesis"
"of keeping up anatomical structure and"
"that when these processes which are"
"central to multicellularity are"
"disrupted then we see the kinds of"
"things that that we call cancer and i'm"
"going to uh show you that that much of"
"the cellular communication that's"
"required to do this is in fact"
"electrical much like in the brain but"
"i'm going to say that it's in all of the"
"tissues of the body"
"and that now we're basically uh entering"
"an era where we can actually we can"
"actually target this system for control"
"of this kind of collective decision"
"making which has many applications in"
"regenerative medicine cancer medicine"
"and bioengineering okay"
"so uh in in two sentences the whole talk"
"boils down to this that as it turns out"
"like the brain somatic tissues form"
"electrical networks that make decisions"
"and these are decisions about growth and"
"form and that computational modeling of"
"these network dynamics"
"enables us to design ion channel"
"modulation strategies which we call"
"electroceuticals to reinforce"
"morphogenesis and reprogram cancer"
"that's the claim so here we go"
"so the first question is what is the"
"alternative to cancer now this is what"
"you're seeing here is a single uh celled"
"organism known as a lacrimarium so this"
"is one cell and you can see it's very"
"competent in handling the goals of a one"
"cell organism it hit it morphologically"
"behaviorally physiologically it does"
"everything it needs and here it is"
"hunting in its in its environment this"
"is one cell there is no brain there is"
"no nervous system there are no cell to"
"cell communications um everything"
"everything is here and it does"
"everything it needs and so the amazing"
"thing then is that creatures like this"
"can actually get together and pursue"
"very much larger scale goals because we"
"know that we start life as a single cell"
"and then through an amazing process of"
"self-assembly many of these really"
"complex anatomies appear okay"
"and we know that this is not just a stem"
"cell differentiation problem because the"
"key is not simply to get the right"
"collection of tissues as you might have"
"in the teratoma you know skin and"
"nerve and hair and bone and whatever i"
"don't need to tell you guys uh that what"
"what's different here is that the"
"three-dimensional uh structure is"
"missing so simply getting your cell"
"types isn't enough you have to know"
"where the cell types go and this is the"
"beginnings of we're starting to see the"
"many many decisions that the"
"the cellular collectives have to make"
"and so in particular then we can take a"
"cross-section through a human torso here"
"it is this incredibly"
"complex arrangement of organs and"
"tissues everything most of the time in"
"the right place right size shape"
"orientation position relative to each"
other
"and so we can ask the question where"
"does this pattern come from because we"
"all start as a set of embryonic"
"blastomeres and then something like"
"something this incredibly complex shows"
"up so where does this pattern come from"
"well often people are tempted to say dna"
"but we can read genomes now and we know"
"that nothing like this is in the genome"
"what's in the genome are protein"
"sequences so descriptions of the very"
"smallest pieces of hardware that the"
"cells can deploy to do signaling and"
"various other things but then the"
"cellular collective has to operate a"
"kind of software using these um these"
"pieces of hardware these protein and"
"other types of signaling pathways to"
"arrange themselves in this invariant"
"pattern so we would like to know how do"
"these collectives know what to make and"
"when to stop growing um as in"
"regenerative medicine we'd like to know"
"well if a piece is missing how do we"
"repair it how do we cause these cells to"
"rebuild what they once built"
"and of course uh for for this audience"
"what happens when this process breaks"
"down okay"
"and so uh of course um"
"pattern control in this in this large uh"
"sort of global vision of of how how do"
"we control what it is that cells build"
"is is huge it's a central problem if we"
"had control over this um we would"
"basically be able to deal with birth"
"defects traumatic injury cancer"
"degenerative disease synthetic by"
"engineering all of these things would be"
"solved if we could answer one question"
"which is how do groups of cells know"
"what they should be building okay and"
"really there are very fundamental uh"
"areas of ignorance still in the field"
"this is just as an example"
"this is a creature known as a planarian"
"you'll see lots more of this momentarily"
"the interesting thing about these"
"flatworms is that they reproduce by"
"fission and regeneration so they tear"
"themselves in half the front half makes"
"a new tail the back end makes a new head"
"now you got two worms that's how they"
"regenerate so what that means is that"
"they're they don't have weissman's"
"barrier really it means that"
"any mutation that doesn't kill the stem"
"cell that it hits basically is"
"propagated into the next generation so"
"for several hundred million years"
"these things have been accumulating"
"mutations now you can see this in their"
"genome their genomes are an incredible"
"mess in fact each animal is mix a ploy"
"you don't even we don't even have a"
"proper assembly because you don't know"
"what you're sequencing every gene has"
every
"cell rather has a different number of"
"chromosomes so the genome is an"
"incredible mess and yet when you cut"
"these animals they regenerate to a"
"perfectly correct planarian anatomy 100"
"of the time incredible anatomical"
"fidelity lots of noise down at the"
"genetic level how is that possible how"
"do these things"
"maintain such incredibly tight"
"anatomical constraints when the genome"
"can can vary widely so we really don't"
"understand these kinds of algorithms"
"and in general the issue of regeneration"
"is um is is is really important because"
"so here you have this is a an axolotl"
"it's a mexican salamander"
"these uh creatures um regenerate their"
"eyes their jaws their limbs their spinal"
"cords portions of the brain and the"
heart
"and what what happens is let's see let's"
"say if a limb is amputated whether it's"
"amputated up here at the shoulder or"
"here at the elbow they will grow exactly"
"what's needed no more no less and then"
"the process stops this is the most"
"profound mystery here i mean lots of"
"people are working on sort of"
"kick-starting regeneration"
"but the most uh the most profound"
"mystery is how does it stop because when"
"does it stop it stops when a correct"
"salamander arm has been completed how"
"does the system know what a correct"
"salamander arm looks like uh this is"
"this is this is still a very much an"
"open question so what we're good at in"
"regenerative and molecular medicine"
"today is identifying pathways like this"
"so at the sort of at the hardware level"
"what we would like to understand is the"
"system level anatomical outcomes why"
"does your hand not look like your foot"
"they have the same cell types"
"what what would we need to tweak in a"
"big network like this to get a"
"particular structure to reform let's say"
"a part of the ear or some some organ we"
"still don't know"
"so this is this is that that gap is what"
"is what we're trying to uh to to uh to"
"fit and with respect to um with respect"
"to cancer these are i'm sure you've seen"
"these before these are a couple of um a"
"couple of quotes pointing out that um"
"cancer is not so much uh"
"necessarily a disorder of the molecular"
"hardware it certainly can be caused that"
"way but it's it's fundamentally a large"
scale
"problem in uh the scope of the uh the"
"the geometric goals that are trying to"
"be uh uh implemented by the biological"
"system single cell optimization versus"
"uh versus large-scale um cooperation"
"towards morphogenesis and so one way to"
"look at this is that it's a"
"developmental disease which is a"
"disorder of the interaction of cells"
"with a field of information that"
"normally keeps them bound together"
"towards the anatomical needs of the"
"larger host body and this kind of"
"thinking is not just sort of philosophy"
"it has very practical implications i"
"mean let's look at just one uh"
"prediction here if if we ask the"
"question why do human bodies have"
"reduced regenerative potential why are"
"we not like salamanders right well if"
"you have a perspective focused on sort"
"of specific a very specific pathway"
"single cell level control cell cycle"
"things like this you would say that and"
"in fact people say this all the time"
that
"organisms with high regenerative"
potential
"in thus easy access to proliferation"
"pathways and then undifferentiated"
"plastic cells and so on should have a"
"high cancer incidence meaning that"
"cancer and regenerative capacity should"
"go together okay the idea that mammals"
"couldn't keep regenerative ability"
"without an oncogenic cost but in fact"
"and the opposite version of this would"
"say that um"
"actually if you have a perspective"
"focused on the morphogenetic control"
"system you would say that no organisms"
"that can exist exert robust patterning"
"control meaning have high regenerative"
"capacity should have a lower cancer"
"incidence because they're better at"
"harnessing cells towards these large"
"scale goals and that in fact you would"
"then predict that regeneration and"
"cancer are opposite ends of the"
"morphostatic spectrum and in fact this"
"is this is correct"
"organisms that are that are highly"
"regenerative tend to be very resistant"
"to cancer and in fact if you do manage"
"to and this is this very old data if you"
"do manage to uh induce a tumor on um on"
"on one of these organisms you amputate"
"through the tumor they will basically"
"regenerate the limb they will uh hijack"
"the remaining cancer cells bring them"
"under control and now you have a healthy"
"tissue and planaria planaria do this as"
"well so there are lots of interesting"
"scenarios like this that illustrate this"
"the importance of large-scale patterning"
"control uh with respect to cancer"
so
"what we want to do is uh pursue"
"normalization strategies that reboot the"
"ability of of cells to participate in"
"patterning and this this as an"
"alternative to trying to kill them so"
"basically we'd like to avoid"
"compensatory proliferation uh and and"
"and the evolution of tumor cell"
"resistance and so on we're not trying to"
"kill off the susceptible ones we're"
"trying to get everybody back uh into a"
"network that works towards normal um"
"tissue structure level and so"
"um this is this is how we think about"
"this as the"
"the the change of the scaling of the of"
"of the homeostatic activity where"
"basically we start off as individual"
"cells that can scale up towards a large"
"scale goal such as making limbs but then"
"it can also scale back down this is this"
"is human glioblastoma this is um"
"one of my postdocs uh juanita matthews"
"who works on this and this is a video of"
"human glioblastoma cells so you can see"
"that uh this this this inflation of the"
"the gold space of these uh of these"
"systems is not permanent it can during"
"the lifetime of the body it can also"
"revert back to a kind of unicellular"
"defection where in effect these cells"
"will simply treat the rest of the body"
"as external environment they're just"
"they don't consider themselves part of"
"the part of the hole anymore"
"so okay so so in order to to make any"
"practical use of this we ask so what are"
"these uh"
"information signals that allow cells to"
"join into networks to make limbs and"
"eyes and livers and so on"
"there are lots of different components"
"of this"
"morphogenetic field"
"i'm going to focus on my favorite which"
"is bioelectricity that's not to say that"
"bioelectricity does everything of course"
"the matrix is important and chemical"
"gradients and the oxygen gradients and"
extracellular
"tensions and stresses and all of this"
"all of these things are are valuable but"
"i'm going to talk about one particular"
"layer okay the the bioelectric layer and"
"to start to warm up to start thinking"
"about this let's think about how it"
"works in the brain because that's the"
"most familiar system"
"so in the brain uh we have a certain"
"kind of hardware which is that we have a"
"connection a collection of cells"
"each cell has ion channels so in their"
"membrane so these ion channels pass"
"things like chloride and sodium and"
"potassium and protons"
"which go in and out and the combined uh"
"disbalance between positive and negative"
"charges on either side of the membrane"
"give the cell a resting potential and"
"this resting potential can be can change"
"as a function of time and it can"
"propagate to the neighbors through these"
"electrical synapses known as gap"
"junctions we're not going to worry about"
"chemical synapses for now but these are"
"electrical synapses known as gap"
"junctions that can pass a current from"
"one cell to the other so there's there"
"is a large network the electrical"
"activity propagates uh through these"
things
"uh both both the channels and the gap"
"junctions are themselves voltage"
"sensitive which means that they are"
"basically a voltage-gated current"
"conductance which is in effect a"
"transistor that's another way to"
"describe a transistor so all of these"
"electrical propagation dynamics can be"
"actually pretty complex you can't sort"
"of just estimate them in your head you"
"have to do modeling and so all of this"
"is an amazing system for running a"
"certain kind of software now the in the"
"brain this plays out as behavior and so"
"this is um imaging that was done by by"
"this group here on living zebrafish"
"brain as the zebrafish is thinking about"
"whatever it is that zebrafish think"
about
"and there's this idea of neural decoding"
"which is if we knew how to interpret"
"these electrical signals we should be"
"able to take a reading of the living"
"brain and extract from it using various"
"information processing tools a uh the"
"the cognitive content we should know"
"what is the animal planning remembering"
"thinking what is it going to do next and"
"so on because we believe that that that"
the
"dynamic activity of the system the"
"information flow is encoded in these"
"electrical signals okay and so that's"
"that's that's this is the commitment of"
neuroscience
"turns out um all cells in your body do"
"exactly the same thing so every cell has"
"ion channels most cells have gap"
"junctions and uh what we are trying to"
"do is to uh"
"use these"
"electrical voltage imaging so here you"
"see this is this is not a model or a"
"simulation this is a real frog embryo"
"using a voltage-sensitive dye to reveal"
"much like here in the brain this reveals"
"the dynamic uh electrical communication"
"that exists between these cells and i'm"
"going to argue in a minute that this is"
"not just a pretty readout of what the"
"cells happen to be doing it's actually"
the
"information processing that"
"enables these cells to go from being a"
"ball of of blastomeres to a tadpole to"
"an incredibly complex apple"
"one thing"
"i want to show you and i always debate"
"about whether or not i should i should"
"show the slide but i figured i'll put it"
"in one thing that's been known for a"
"really long time is if you track"
"individual cell voltage"
"you'll see this really interesting"
"relationship where um"
"very active proliferating cells like"
"embryonic cells stem cells uh cancer"
"cells and uh and and things like this"
"tend to be very depolarized they have a"
"very low resting potential whereas you"
"are terminally differentiated adult"
"mature cells tend to be up here"
"hyperpolarized and in fact this is not"
"just again not just a a readout you can"
"drag cells from this state to to this"
"state for example take mature neurons"
"and get them to re-enter the cell cycle"
"by depolarizing them for several days"
"and conversely you can take cells from"
"this state and get them to lose their"
"plasticity um and then and then you have"
"interesting outliers like liver which"
"sort of hangs out in between which is"
"interesting because it's an adult issue"
"with lots of regenerative potential so"
"the reason that um i i kind of go back"
"and forth on showing the slide is"
"because people tend to really like this"
"and then they focus on voltage as a"
"single cell parameter they say oh if we"
"just address the the voltage level of"
"individual cells we could we could"
"target cancer and and that's part of the"
"story but i think a much more important"
"part of the story is that the key"
"decisions are not made at the individual"
"cell level they are network or tissue"
"level decisions um what happens in the"
"uh in the in the normal embryo for"
"example and this is this is gray scale"
"it's just just a different way of"
"visualizing it the color values are the"
"voltage what you see this is this is the"
"embryo uh putting its face together and"
"what you will see and this is this is"
"something that um my colleague danny"
"adams identified"
"when we were we were doing this uh some"
"years back looking at the bioelectrics"
"of face patterning and here's one frame"
"out of that image and what you see is"
"that uh here's where the eye is going to"
"be here's where the mouth is going to be"
"here where the placodes are going to be"
"the layout of the future face and in"
"particular the gene expressions that are"
"going to be required frizzleds and winds"
"and all these things that are going to"
"be required to do this"
are
"are shown in advance by the bioelectric"
"pre pattern that tells all of these"
"domains where they're supposed to go and"
"it's not just an image in the sense that"
"if we artificially move this i'm going"
"to show you some of this in a minute if"
"we wipe off this voltage spot and"
"reintroduce it somewhere else guess"
"where the eye is going to be so this is"
"instructive it is absolutely instructive"
"for face in fact human channelopathies"
"uh which have um craniofacial birth"
"defects often have these kind of ion"
"channel mutations that um that alter"
"this electrical face pattern so this is"
"a native endogenous pattern that is"
"required for normal face morphogenesis"
"but here's the pathological pattern that"
"theo was just asking about so"
"if we introduce an oncogene into this"
"tadpole it will eventually make tumors"
"here it is it's starting to spread"
"but even before that tumor is"
"histologically or"
"anatomically apparent you can already"
"see from the voltage map where it's"
"going to be here's the kind of the"
"epicenter of it and then here's some"
"other stuff around it that you may not"
"um catch later on and so this this has"
"uh sort of straightforward implications"
"for cancer diagnostics and i have some"
"some ideas for a kind of um"
"a kind of goggle system that you can use"
"either at home to screen your skin or"
"during surgery to see tumor margins you"
"should you should be able to use these"
"these voltage reporter dies to identify"
"these aberrant cells now there needs to"
"be some interpretation because the other"
"thing you're going to catch is some stem"
"cells so there needs to be some work"
"done to kind of be able to distinguish"
"the distinguish those two but but for"
"sure you can find things like this that"
"are that are"
"nascent tumors okay"
"and uh so so so here are the techniques"
"we've developed because because it's"
"it's uh it's important to know how we do"
"this so of course voltage sensitive"
"fluorescent dyes um there are a variety"
"although we still need some development"
"of these and lots of computational"
"modeling so lots of taking what"
"expression uh levels of different"
"channels and pumps and gap junctions and"
"putting them together in a quantitative"
"model that explains why the pattern is"
"this as opposed to some other pattern"
"and the most important part of the"
"functional tools so this is really"
"critical in in perturbing these"
"electrical networks we do not use"
"external electric fields there is no"
"magnetic component we don't use waves we"
don't
"use electrodes we don't apply fields or"
currents
"we manipulate the endogenous so this is"
"all molecular physiology we manipulate"
"the endogenous"
uh
"channels and and gap junctions that give"
"rise to these electrical computations so"
"what we might do is go in and uh control"
"which cells talk to each other cells via"
"gap junctions so so we have we change"
"the topology of the network this is"
"equivalent to synaptic plasticity if we"
"were neuroscientist so you go in and you"
"you can mutate the give the gap junction"
"to another form or you can block it with"
"drugs or something like this and with"
"ion channels we can manipulate the"
"voltage of individual cells and so again"
"you can mutate the ion channels a huge"
"pharmacological library of compounds to"
"open them or close them you can use"
"optogenetics you can use light to open"
"and close certain channels and this"
"would be the equivalence of intrinsic"
plasticity
"so so why why is this all this"
"interesting why would you want to do"
"something like this well i'll say that"
"that when we first started the standard"
"uh assumption was that"
"voltage was just a housekeeping property"
"of the cell and if you mess with it"
"you're going to get uninterpretable cell"
"death and then that was going to be it"
"and and i'm going to show you that that"
"is not the case so one of the things you"
"can do is you can trigger organ level"
"morphogenesis so what i can do is i can"
"take some cells in this tadpole here"
"that normally are faded to be gut so"
"endoderm and i can inject one ion"
"channel let's say kv 1.5 rna and what"
"what happens when i inject that ion"
"channel is gonna is that um"
"it it re it sets the voltage potential"
"to a particular state in particular it"
"creates a spot that's a pattern that"
"looks like that eye spot in the electric"
"face that i just showed you a minute ago"
"and when you do this what you're saying"
"to the cells by by putting down that"
"pattern is make an eye here it's a"
"trigger it's a that bioelectric pattern"
"serves as a kind of subroutine call to"
"the rest of the cells that say you are"
"now pressed into the following"
"anatomical goal you're going to express"
"a bunch of eye related genes and then"
"you're going to make an eye and sure"
"enough they do yeah in the on on the gut"
"now um your developmental biology"
"textbook might say that gut cells are"
"not competent to be eyes that all of"
"that only happens in the anterior"
"directed term that's true if you're"
"sticking with molecular biology master"
"regulators like pac-6 but it is not true"
"if you go up"
"the causal chain and address the"
"bioelectric states that tell every"
"tissue what it should and shouldn't be"
"so we can induce these eyes on the tail"
"and the gut in the flank wherever in"
"fact it has a very interesting"
"uh non-local property which we're going"
"to get to in the case of cancer"
"momentarily which what you see over here"
"is this is a uh this is a lens sitting"
"out in the flank of a tadpole induced"
"this way the blue cells marked with beta"
"gal are the ones that got the channel"
"they are the ones that have been"
"directly modified but all these other"
"cells down here have been induced by"
"them to participate together in this"
"nice uh round making this this this"
"perfectly round lens v cells down here"
"were never"
"directly modified by us so what you see"
"is that"
"you're not micromanaging the spatial"
"structure once you get enough cells"
"committed to the fact that we're making"
"an eye you trigger all sorts of"
interesting
"instructive interactions whereby you"
"don't have to micromanage these details"
"you don't have to tell them how many"
"cells make up a lens they figure that"
"out on their own your goal is to"
"identify as a worker in regenerative"
"medicine your goal is to identify the"
"trigger that convinces the whole region"
"that that's what they should be doing"
"and you can do this with only partial"
"cell coverage and when they make you"
"call this an emergent"
"i'm sorry say again would you call this"
"an emergent event i i would call it an"
"emergent event yeah in the sense that"
"you're providing the information you're"
"providing is very very low information"
"content relative to what comes out so we"
"don't have any clue uh about how to make"
"a a a a whole eye you know you'd have to"
"there's all kinds of different cell"
types
"tons of genes that would have to be"
"turned on and off if we try to do this"
"manually meaning at the lowest level"
"just program directly with some sort of"
"stem cell strategy or something uh to"
"program directly the creation of an eye"
"we that that's not going to happen in"
"you know in our lifetime from"
"it is absolutely yep it is absolutely"
"emerging because what we've identified"
"by treating the rest of the tissue as a"
"uh in not as a clockwork machine of of"
"the simplest type but actually as a"
"programmable information processing"
"agent that has subroutines we can now"
"ask the question well what subroutines"
"exist and what are the triggers what"
"right and and here's one here's a"
"trigger that the embryo natively uses in"
"fact it's it's not one that we created"
"we're just hijacking what's already"
"there it already uses this voltage"
"trigger to make eyes in the first place"
"and the cells are happy enough to do it"
"again and again and here you can see"
"they have all the right you know they"
"have all the lens and retina and optic"
"nerve and all that all the stuff they're"
"supposed to have"
and
"yeah thanks and for the um you know for"
"further regenerative medicine we're"
"moving forward into for example limb"
"regeneration so so here is um"
"a frog frogs unlike salamanders normally"
"do not regenerate their legs and so uh"
"45 days later there's nothing after"
"amputation but we have a cocktail that"
"triggers a bi-electric state that then"
"um kick-starts this uh it kick-starts"
"this this whole cascade it turns on"
"pro-regenerative genes such as msx1 it"
"um it it starts to grow the leg with the"
"with the toes and the toenail and"
"eventually the leg is quite um quite"
"respectable and you can see here that"
"it's both touch sensitive and motile so"
"the animal can the animal can feel that"
"and and use the leg to um to get away so"
"it's pretty good like now we are moving"
"this of course into uh into mammals"
"we're trying this in mice right now um"
"this is where i have to do a disclosure"
"we have a spin-off company called"
"morphaceuticals inc on the david kaplan"
"and i have found it"
"to use this technology for limb"
"regeneration so that's a that's a that's"
"an industry disclosure there so so let's"
"okay so so what i've shown you so far is"
"that these bioelectrical signals are are"
"important uh determinants of large-scale"
"anatomical structures so what do they"
"have to do with cancer so we can make we"
"can make five"
"predictions if if we are correct we can"
"make five predictions uh the first is"
"that the physiology data should"
"implicate electrical parameters in"
cancer
"the molecular data should implicate uh"
"ion channel and pump proteins in cancer"
"and then"
"the bioelectric signature could be a"
"tool a diagnostic tool for tumorogenesis"
"and that here are the two most important"
"functional ones i'm going to spend um"
"the next 20 minutes talking about that"
"which is this this interesting a"
"suggestion that cancer could be"
"inducible by modulation of voltage"
"gradients in the absence of genetic"
"damage or carcinogens or anything like"
"that and better yet this is the one"
"we're all hoping for that"
"cancer could be suppressable by"
"modulation of these vmem gradients so so"
"let's just run down these and see what"
"what's true"
"this is now uh uh quite old i'm now"
"realizing 2016 god"
"but if you just look at the number of"
"publications that deal with cancer and"
"ion channels uh it's it's it's it"
"started shooting up um already in the"
"last um 20 years and it's now now"
"they're they're way more i need to"
"update this"
"and in fact already there's about a"
"dozen channel and pump genes that are"
"known as either oncogenes or tumor"
"suppressors so that's interesting and"
"you can mine all sorts of databases such"
as
"such as this one where you can see"
"during the during the progression there"
"are important changes in the expression"
"of specific um specific channels but"
"this is really critical the genes are"
"not the key here okay the all this is is"
"a rough guide of where to look but this"
"is not the driver the driver is not the"
"gene expression the driver is the"
"physiological state and and the reason"
"that's really important is because these"
"channels because they are information"
processing
"hardware they open and close"
post-translationally
"you cannot using any kind of profiling"
"not not transcriptomic not proteomic you"
"cannot tell"
"what the electric state of a cell is by"
"looking at what's expressed because you"
"don't know if the channels are open or"
"closed because that's driven by the"
"physiological history of the cell so"
"this kind of profiling"
"can give you a hint of what might the"
"important players be in terms of control"
"knobs that you can use right what are"
"the channels that might be useful to you"
"but but you cannot extract a bioelectric"
"state from profiling dead cells all of"
"the important bioelectric parameters"
"disappear as soon as you fix the cell"
"and then if you take you know you"
"fractionate it into protein and rna and"
"all of that goes away so physiological"
"profiling is really key"
"and there's a there's a whole um you"
"know there's a whole uh effort in"
"treating um looking for ion channel"
"drugs as cancer drugs and what holds"
"back that whole subfield is this idea"
"that what people p what people do is"
"they treat um ion channels as oncogenes"
"and they see it upregulated in some"
"tuber and they go bingo we need to we"
"need to we need to block it and then you"
"know then life will be good and that"
"is maybe how you would do it if it were"
"a transcription factor or some"
"biochemical thing"
"but bioelectricity does not work like"
"that and it's it's really important to"
"keep track that it's the it's the"
"physiological state that's critical and"
"this is largely the work of my phd"
"student brooke chernan"
"from a few years back so so the first is"
"the diagnostics which which you've"
"already asked about and and it's simply"
"the idea that uh what we can do is"
"inject uh various oncogenes from human"
"patients into uh into embryos now notice"
"this is not a claim that oncogenes are"
"always what star tumors i'm not making"
"that claim i'm just using these as a"
"tool because they do in fact happen to"
"trigger tumor genesis to some extent in"
"tadpoles and we can use that and we can"
"sort of gauge um the false positives and"
"false negative negatives against other"
"tests and ultimately the signature is"
"going to be a combination of dyes and"
"then some some interesting formula uh of"
"uh you know how much you put aberrant"
"potassium flow versus voltage versus you"
"know other other things so so so we've"
"done a bunch of work on this as a"
"diagnostic and you can tell exactly"
"where the um where the the the tumor is"
"going to form"
"now the other the other thing and this"
"was uh this was quite we had we had a"
"heck of a time uh in initially with"
"reviewers on this because what we show"
"here is that you can do something very"
"interesting and here here are two of the"
"main um the main papers on this and this"
"is was driven by by these folks in my"
group
"we we said okay if we artificially"
"disrupt this electrical communication"
"could we trigger cancer without any"
"damage to the to the genome without any"
"oncogenes no carcinogens we just trigger"
"this because that's a strong prediction"
"of our of our model"
"and and the way uh the way we did it was"
"we identified an interesting and sparse"
"cell population here um that you can see"
"them here the marker for this is the"
"gliar channel the glycine-gated chloride"
"channel and the reason we like this is"
"because chloride chloride is cool it it"
"enables you to once you so so here's one"
"of these cells it has a chloride channel"
"in the membrane if you use a drug like"
"ivermectin to open to lock this channel"
"in an open position then what you can do"
"is add various amounts of chloride"
"externally and use that to dial the cell"
"voltage up or down because it because"
"the inside at least in a tadpole the"
"inside is about 40 millimolar if there's"
"more outside it'll go in and now you've"
"hyperpolarized the cell because you"
"drive a bunch of negative charges into"
"the cell if on the other hand you're in"
"a medium where there's less chloride"
"this this this chloride will tend to"
"come out"
"and and then so you can use it as a just"
"as a convenient control knob on on the"
"voltage so we said okay here's this rare"
"cell population nobody had described it"
"before what happens when you mess with"
"it with its voltage well what happens is"
"the embryos end up with basically what"
"ends up being metastatic melanoma so"
"these are uh normal melanocytes these"
"are pigment cells you could see what"
"there's usually a variety of them up"
"here in the neural tube this is a by the"
"way a tadpole here are some nostrils"
"these are the eyes these black things of"
"the eyes here's the brain and here's the"
"gut back here so normally it's this so"
"so you throw them into some ivermectin"
"and uh with with low chloride uh"
"externally and the animals start to just"
"turn black all these melanocytes go"
"completely crazy they over proliferate"
they
"cover these areas that are normally kept"
"pretty clear"
"one area they never cover is this little"
"moon roof on top of the pineal gland"
"that's completely unknown why they"
"refuse to cover that up but but they"
"sort of respect this boundary it's"
"really really really wild"
"and they do this in an mmp dependent"
"fashion if you block mmps then they"
"can't get out here but they still"
"obviously over proliferate like like"
"crazy and here's what it looks like"
"internally so these are cross sections"
"through that"
"cross sections through through that that"
"tadpole normally these black spots these"
"are the melanocytes nt stands for neural"
"tube so here's the neural tube and so"
"you should see you know one two three"
"four five these small numbers of these"
"nice round pigment cells here it is up"
"at the anterior of the animal and here's"
"the tail so it's a little a little"
"squished but here's here's where it is"
"the ones that are transformed by our"
"iron channel drug are this is what they"
"look like the melanocytes have gone"
"completely crazy look at these"
"projections instead of being these"
"little round things they form these long"
"ridiculous projections uh they go the"
"projections are all over the place and"
"then they start to invade they invade"
"the the neural tube the brain here they"
"dive into the spinal cord"
"into the lumen of the neural tube and"
"they just they just completely start to"
"take over here they are filling up the"
"blood vessels so here these are the two"
"major major blood vessels which should"
"be nice and clear normally and here they"
"are they're just they're just completely"
"going crazy um and the longer you let"
"these and they live for a very long time"
"these animals actually uh but they get"
"completely filled with these with these"
"melanocytes that just just go you go"
"nuts and they change um everything about"
"them changes and uh also not just the"
"melanocytes but actually the vasculature"
"changes so you start you start to induce"
"these abnormal"
"abnormal vascular"
"vascular paths and so um"
"what's uh one thing that's really"
"interesting about this is that"
the
"cells that just to keep in mind the"
"cells that transform"
"are not the cells that we depolarize we"
"depaul and so you can see that in this"
"experiment the blue region is where we"
"put a depolarizing channel this is now"
"with a drug you can't really do spatial"
"you know spatially specific experiments"
"so so we use the polarizing channel here"
"so the blue cells are the ones that we"
"depolarized the melanocytes that went"
"crazy are up here um"
"at a considerable distance and this is"
"going to become important momentarily"
"that this is a not a cell autonomous"
"phenotype it's the voltage change in the"
"environment you know in the micro and i"
"don't even know if it's micro"
"environment because it's actually a huge"
"distance in the environment is the"
"physiological switch towards metastatic"
"behavior um"
"and uh and and so and so i you know i"
"won't take the time here unless uh"
"somebody asks afterwards but but we kind"
"of took apart the whole process it's"
"it's serotonergically mediated there's a"
"the way that the way that those cells"
"communicate to the melanocytes is via"
"via serotonin and we've done all kinds"
of
"you know profiling of the"
"transcriptional responses and so on but"
"in the last um"
"in the last seven minutes what i'd like"
"to do is uh"
"to uh go through uh go through the what"
"i think is even more exciting which is"
"uh which is back to brook's work which"
"is um can we suppress this now that we"
"know we can induce this phenotype well"
"can we can we suppress this and he did a"
"very simple experiment um inject your"
"various oncogenes and and the oncogene"
"itself is labeled with a red fluorescent"
"protein so you can see it here it is it"
"makes a tumor and all the tissue that"
"got injected is is bright red and here"
"there's some escapees that are like"
"leaving and colonizing and whatever"
"and what he found is that if you"
"co-inject into these uh into these uh"
"cells you co-inject an ion channel that"
"uh will"
"prevent that cell from depolarizing and"
"closing its"
"electrical connections to their"
"neighbors one of the first things that"
"gap junctions do is they cause cells to"
"depolarize and lose gap junctional"
"connections and that's actually been"
"known since the the 80s and uh when you"
"do this when you put in this rna for"
"this this ion channel even though the"
"oncogene is blazingly strongly expressed"
"in fact it's all over the place here"
"there's no tumor and there's no tumor"
"here because the channel"
"the oncogene says depolarize and leave"
"and go off and start migrating and do"
"your amoeba like life and the ion"
"channel says nope you're part of a"
"network you're going to undergo normal"
"histogenesis like the rest of your"
"neighbors and that tends to be dominant"
and
"you know you have to tighter these"
"things and so on and so the effect is"
"not absolute but you can see we can even"
"you can even do this with light so so in"
"this paper uh in anka target we did it"
"with optogenetics so you can use light"
"to turn on ion channels that will"
"prevent oncogenes from from inducing"
"tumors and"
"one of the big i i've forgotten to say"
"one of the big uh issues that um"
"reviewers had with the with the previous"
"story where we induced the phenotype is"
"everybody said well where's the primary"
"tumor in other words show me that"
"original broken cell and we said well"
"there is no primary tumor every"
"melanocyte is uh is is converting at"
"once and there's no primary site and in"
"fact none of the cells are broken"
"because because that's not what this is"
"this is a and he said well if there's no"
"primary tumor then you know then then we"
"don't know what what you're looking at"
"and so"
"part of this is uh is is a conceptual"
"thing if you assume right up front that"
"has to be a clonal relationship and a"
"primary tumor site and all this"
"then this is all something else right"
"and one of the you know sort of in that"
"continuous battle to say that it's not"
"necessarily a a problem with your"
"genetics we developed some of this data"
"which is"
"here we inject a sodium channel"
"and depending on the level of sodium"
"outside of the animal it will either"
"make a tumor that then starts to like"
"crawl off and and invade or it will make"
"an ectopic eye and you get to decide eye"
"or tumor from exactly the same molecular"
"state just based on how much sodium is"
"in the medium and so you can see that"
"these decisions are you know it's it's"
"physiological control it's it's"
"environment it's micro environment it's"
"it's larger environment it is not just"
"oh look there's i've sequenced the"
"mutation and now i can tell you exactly"
"what's going to happen in fact you can't"
"tell what's going to happen because in a"
"case like this"
"if you were to profile this using uh"
"let's say sql any kind of sequencing you"
"would see this mutation and you would"
"know that oh yeah that causes a tumor in"
"the you know eighty percent of the tacos"
"and you would be and you would be wrong"
"because you cannot catch the bioelectric"
"state that way and you don't know that"
"it would have actually suppressed it so"
"in all of these physiological cases"
"the the the reality of of the"
"bioelectrics can can give you a"
"completely different result than"
"anything you can predict from the from"
"the molecular measurements so"
"um to now now to uh just to sort of uh"
"emphasize this long range thing so i"
"showed you before that i can induce this"
"this metastatic behavior from a distance"
okay
and
"uh the same thing is true with these"
"channels so so what brooke did was he"
"injected the tumor rna on one side of"
"the animal he injected the channel all"
"the way on the opposite side so not"
"together with the with with uh with the"
"oncogene but on the other side of the"
"animal and we use different color"
"tracers so you can see here what you"
"know exactly where where the concrete"
"went and where the where the iron chin"
"went and the magnitude of of rescue is"
"quite similar you can do this from a"
distance
"as as well as as in the same cell so"
"again not cell autonomous now this"
"ability to signal across the body to"
"make um"
"to make a different of difference"
electrically
"it's not just for cancer this is this is"
"a study we had uh a couple years ago"
"showing that here's here's a froglet we"
"amputate the leg and when you amputate"
"the leg there's a bioelectrical uh state"
"that that comes up okay the opposite leg"
"that we never touched never never got"
"injured lights up within 30 seconds in"
"exactly the same location and in fact by"
"tracking this signal i can tell whether"
"this was an amputation or or a puncture"
"wound so the electrical information"
"about uh the physiology of what's going"
"on you know damage and various other"
"various other things"
"is uh apparent at a long range because"
"that's what electrical signals are"
"really good at they're good at"
"propagating information and by the way"
"this is not neural because we can take"
"out this whole spinal cord you just take"
"it out and it works exactly the same way"
"it doesn't propagate through the through"
"the neurons and this this actually"
"harkens all the way back to harold burr"
"in 1938 or so who said who claimed that"
"uh with with early um uh uh volt meter"
"measurements that he could tell which of"
"the rabbits uh that he was working with"
"had tumors by taking voltage"
"measurements all over the body that he"
"he argued for a non-local uh presence of"
"this information and i think he was"
"probably right because we we we see this"
"quite quite clearly"
"so um"
"uh just to summarize uh and then and"
"then a couple of final final slides"
"we can look at cancer as a disorder of"
"pattern regulation of signals that bind"
"cellular activity towards tissue and"
"organ level goals so it's not i think"
"the long term story is not simply that"
"voltage tells cells whether they should"
"be cancer or not the bigger picture is"
"that the voltage is a medium in which"
"the decisions of cellular collectives"
"are made in terms of where they're going"
"to go in health and disease and um now"
"the specific the actionable uh"
"discoveries are that bioelectric"
"properties can be used to detect induce"
"and reprogram this kind of cell behavior"
"now we know we have tools now where"
"these electrical circuit dynamics"
"instruct the outcomes without targeting"
"the genome now not terribly surprising"
"for anybody who's in neuroscience we do"
"this all the time through through"
"experiences through rewards and"
"punishments through drugs you can affect"
"outcomes and you don't need to uh rewire"
"pathways or change gene expression"
"directly and so what we're now trying to"
"do is to derive some strategies if we"
"obviously move this into mammalian"
systems
"and to derive some strategies for using"
"this stuff as electroceuticals now how"
"would you do that so the general"
"flow workflow looks something like this"
you
"we already have uh from other people's"
"expression profiling so rna-seq and"
"things like this a list of channels that"
"are present in your tissue of interest"
"so let's say you you're working in the"
"liver and you want to know what are my"
"control knobs what are the channels that"
"i could turn on and off in the liver to"
"make electrical changes and so there are"
"these um there are profilings and you"
"get then you get that data and then you"
"have to know what is the correct"
"bioelectrical pattern what is the what"
"what does healthy tissue do and then you"
"have a question to answer which of these"
"channels do i open or close to get to"
"the correct pattern and it's not obvious"
"at all and you need a computational"
"platform which was built by our"
"collaborator alexis pytak"
"which is this incredible computational"
"modeling of bioelectrical networks"
"and uh and then you can once you've"
"built that model you can invert it and"
"interrogate it to say okay here's the"
"electrical pattern i have now here's the"
"electrical pattern i would like to have"
"what channels and pumps do i open or"
"close and it will tell you and then you"
"simply go and you say fine what drugs"
"exist to open or to do this to target"
"these channels and something like 20"
"percent of all drugs are ion channel"
"drugs many of them already human tested"
"people already take this stuff for um"
"epilepsy and cardiac disease and and so"
"on so"
"a huge huge pool of electroceuticals for"
"addressing this problem once the"
"computational platform is in place and"
"once we actually know what is the"
"correct state for the various tissues of"
"the human body because we actually don't"
"know there's been very little profiling"
"done for most of these that that single"
"slide i showed you with five or six"
"tissues on it that's about it nobody"
"else actually knows um what the correct"
"electrical states are so lots of"
"opportunities here and then machine"
"learning i'm not going to take the time"
"to go through this but we've used"
"machine learning to sort of look to to"
"both make and interrogate these these"
"models that link by electrical"
"serotonergic and molecular components"
"and sort of find that needle and a"
"haystack intervention that will uh do"
"what what you want them to do so just to"
"close here's where we are"
"we need to refine that physiological"
"signature to get to a non-invasive"
"optical diagnostic whether it be on"
"excise tissue or in during surgery or at"
"home or whatever"
"we need to refine these control methods"
"for mammalian systems"
"and bigger picture like long term we"
"need to crack this electrical code we"
"need to understand how to induce"
"normalization not micromanage cell"
"states but to really just trigger"
"normalization the way that we trigger"
"eye and leg and brain and other kinds of"
"development and so of course we would"
"love to love to work with you to do any"
"of this"
"and uh just to thank uh the people who"
"did all the work that i showed you today"
um
"there's a review uh well there's many"
"reviews but here's one if you would like"
"to take a look and we"
