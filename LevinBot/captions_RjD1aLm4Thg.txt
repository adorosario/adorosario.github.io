"good afternoon everyone I'm Kristin"
"Grauman I'm a researcher at Facebook AI"
"research and a professor at UT Austin"
"and is one of the program chairs for"
"nerps this year I have the pleasure to"
"introduce our next invited speaker"
"professor Michael Levin Michael is a"
"professor biology at Tufts University"
"and he holds a Vannevar Bush endowed"
"chair he's also a director of the Allen"
"Discovery Center at Tufts which examines"
"computation in the medium of living"
"systems his academic background is both"
"computer science and biology he received"
"his PhD from Harvard Medical School in"
"1996 Michaels group does work at the"
"intersection of developmental biology"
"cognition and computational neuroscience"
"they are especially interested in"
"applications in regenerative medicine"
"and as we'll see in his talk today these"
"things can offer inspiration for new"
"machine learning and robotics approaches"
"professor Levin's research has been"
"recognized with a number of different"
"awards I'll mention just a few"
"one is recognition as having made a"
"milestone in developmental biology in"
"the last century from the journal Nature"
"and that was for his work on molecular"
"basis of left-right asymmetry he's also"
"received the established investigator"
"award from the American Heart"
"Association and the scientist of vision"
"award from the International functional"
"electrical stimulation society so we're"
"very excited to hear about his work"
"today so please join me in welcoming"
"professor Michael Levin"
[Applause]
"thank you so much and I'm really excited"
"to be able to present this work to a new"
"audience and I'm gonna give you the main"
"message of my talk right up front what I"
"would like to tell you about is that"
"biology has been computing at many"
"scales long before brains came on the"
"scene and then actually decision-making"
"and all body tissues are mediated by an"
"ancient pre neural electrical network"
"that is made up of all cells not just"
"neurons and so I think that exploiting"
"this kind of non neural cognition is an"
"exciting untapped frontier for the"
"development of new robust AI"
"technologies and I'm very interested in"
"talking to people about these"
"possibilities we're looking for experts"
"in machine learning to collaborate with"
"us to take dielectrics beyond"
"regenerative medicine and towards many"
"new exciting applications so the first"
"thing I would like to do is talk to you"
"a little bit about brain body plasticity"
"- and then to bring to you some examples"
"of somatic cognition in the body"
"decision-making during the self editing"
"of complex anatomies and then we'll talk"
"about by electric mechanisms that"
"underlie the ability of cells and"
"tissues to remodel towards large-scale"
"goals and then I'll talk about that what"
"I think is the future of regenerative"
"medicine and Nai and related issues so"
"let's talk about plasticity caterpillar"
"start out life as a soft body robot that"
"crawls and choose plants during"
"metamorphosis its nervous system and"
"including its brain is basically"
"liquefied it's taken apart and then"
"reassembled into a completely different"
"brain that is able to run a hard robot"
"which flies and drinks nectar during"
"this process of complete nervous system"
"take up being taken apart and putting"
"back together the memories in fact"
"remain so things that the butter that"
"the caterpillar has learned the"
"butterfly will still remember and this"
"has been this has been as well"
"established and so it's very interesting"
"to be to start to think about how it is"
"that information can be stored in the"
"medium that is undergoing radical"
"deformation in work that we've done a"
"few years ago we showed that planaria"
"these are the flatworms that you see"
"here they have this amazing property"
"that if you cut off their head or in"
"fact any part of their body they will"
"regenerate it they regrow their brain"
"and all the other organs so if you train"
"a flatworm to wreck"
"a particular location as being its home"
"environment and then you amputate the"
"brain you leave the tail and let it"
"regenerate a new head here what you"
"discover is that again these these"
"memories are intact so the memory of"
"this in this animal is in some way"
"imprinted on the new brain that develops"
"after regeneration and it challenges us"
"to try to understand how encoding and"
"decoding of complex complex memories and"
"learned behaviors for is able to be"
"propagated across this kind of radical"
"reconstruction of the of the memory"
"medium and in fact when we publish this"
"a few years ago actually we weren't the"
"ones to discover this this was first"
"discovered by a guy named McConnell in"
"the 60s but we people hadn't really"
"looked at this for years and people got"
"pretty excited as you can see here on"
"the internet when we've when we first"
"showed that this that this was possible"
"and going beyond the sort of brain body"
"interface and the question of how the"
"programs of the of though the behavioral"
"programs of the brain interact with the"
"structures of the body I want to talk to"
"you about this kind of self editing of"
"anatomy there are many different types"
"of cognition from from very simple ones"
"to all the way through the kinds of"
"complex things that we hope to mimic"
"with machine learning and artificial"
"intelligence and there are all sorts of"
"living creatures that are able to"
"perform functions that are at various"
"places on this ladder of cognition so"
"one example for is here shown by this"
"unicellular creature called the lac"
"rom√°rio if you're interested in soft"
"body robotics take a look at this this"
"is a single cell okay and this organism"
"handles its physiology its patterning"
"look at the incredible control it has"
"this is real-time by the way this is not"
"sped up so look at the amazing control"
"that this has over its structure as it"
"collects bacteria and as it's basically"
"hunting and eating at the different"
"other microorganisms in this environment"
"but behavior structural control and"
"physiology all in one cell there is no"
"brain here as such and so unicellular"
"organisms and single cells can be"
"incredibly competent at all sorts of"
"interesting goals now when cells joined"
"to become"
"multicellular bodies complex anatomical"
"structures they did not lose this"
"ability to make decisions and to have"
"complex behaviors what you're seeing"
"here on the left is a frog embryo"
"developing and so these cells cooperate"
"to build a very complex structure on the"
"right you're seeing the development of a"
"nervous system in zebrafish and so all"
"of these cells are now working together"
"to build a structure that's much larger"
"than the single cell boundary of their"
"immediate surface and we need to"
"understand how this works"
"all of us started life as a single cell"
"a single fertilized egg and through this"
"process of embryonic development these"
"complex forms are able to be reliably"
"generated so all of these remarkable"
"complex anatomies and it's very"
"important that we understand that this"
"is not just a process that's going to be"
"solved by stem cell biology because stem"
"cells are able to generate all of the"
"individual tissues that are needed"
"foreign organisms of what you see here"
"is something called a teratoma this is a"
"tumor that has hair and teeth and skin"
"and muscle and so all of this stem cell"
"differentiation has gone okay but what's"
"missing is the large scale 3-dimensional"
"structure so one of the important things"
"we need to understand is how do cells"
"decide what they're going to build and"
"how do they implement that construction"
"and so the sort of standard story that"
"people are taught in developmental"
"biology is that there's this kind of"
"open-loop feed-forward system where gene"
"regulatory networks give rise to"
"proteins and then through some physics"
"when these proteins interact with each"
"other in the cells perform various"
"functions there's this emergent process"
"that give rise to complex anatomy but"
"it's actually much more interesting than"
"that first of all all kinds of embryonic"
"species are highly have highly regulated"
"development in the sense that if there"
"is a massive perturbation they can make"
"up for it so for example here is an"
"early mammalian embryo you can cut it in"
"half and each half will rebuild the"
"other missing half this is how you get"
"perfectly normal monozygotic twins the"
"opposite is possible too you can take"
"two or mammalian embryos mush them"
"together like a snowball here these"
"mouse embryos and what you get is a"
"perfectly normal Mouse we would love to"
"have technology obviously that has this"
"degree of plasticity"
"that can make up for such radical"
"deformations now this is not only an"
"embryonic phenomenon the process of"
"regeneration such as the salamanders"
"have is able to rebuild complex large"
"structures during adulthood"
"so here's an axolotl a salamander that"
"can regenerate its eyes its jaws its"
"limbs its spinal cord its ovaries and"
"portions of the brain so as an adult"
"this thing can rebuild very complex"
"structures throughout its life the most"
"amazing thing about regeneration is not"
"that it's able to start it's that it"
"knows when to stop all of these"
"structures after the correct anatomical"
"component has been rebuilt than further"
"growth and remodeling ceases and this is"
"very poorly understood how it knows when"
"to stop I want to introduce you to"
"another animal that you'll see more of"
"later in the talk this is a planarian"
"that same flatworm i mentioned a minute"
ago
"these can be cut into pieces the record"
"is 275 and each piece they're they're"
"about a 2 centimeters long by the way"
"and each of these pieces will regrow"
"exactly what's needed no more no less"
"to make a perfect worm every piece of"
"this animal knows exactly what the"
"correct worm looks like and in fact the"
"regenerative properties are so"
"remarkable that they've conquered aging"
"these worms are literally immortal the"
"individual cells will senescent die but"
"the animal as a whole continues to"
"regenerate them and there is no such"
"thing as an old planarian so now"
"regeneration is not just for so-called"
"lower animals the human liver is highly"
"regenerative deer will regrow their"
"antlers or bone highly innervated bone"
"up to a rate of a centimeter and a half"
"per day of new bone growth every year"
"and you may or may not know that human"
"children below the age of approximately"
"7 to 11 are able to regenerate their"
"fingertips and this was discovered in"
"the 70s but then this ability ceases"
"with age so most of you shouldn't"
"shouldn't try this so what we what we"
"see here is that actually the control"
"structure of this process is not an"
"open-loop system but actually is a"
"closed loop that has some very important"
"error detection and control functions"
"here where deviations from this target"
"morphology lead to changes both at the"
"transcriptional level but also at the in"
"the physicals in the physical"
"processes that allow sales to rebuild"
"and so there's this constant homeostatic"
"loop and one of the goals of my Center"
"is to target the setpoint the anatomical"
"set point of this homeostatic process to"
"be able to recess off' I what the cells"
"should build this is what we're working"
"towards we discovered several years ago"
"that really the capabilities of"
"biological things to build towards a"
"spec are really amazing so in in the"
"journey of from from a tadpole to a frog"
"that all kinds of remodeling has to"
"happen so the eyes have to move together"
"and forward the nostrils have to move"
"the whole face remodels and when we made"
"these sort of Picasso like tadpoles"
"where everything was in the wrong place"
"the I was in the back and the jaws were"
"off to the side the starting positions"
"were all off they largely still"
"remodeled into a perfectly normal frog"
"all of the organs moved in unnatural"
"configurations until they reached this"
"normal frog morphology even though their"
"starting positions were not the same and"
"so we know that what the genome encodes"
"is not a rote set of movements that"
"every organ can simply undergo and give"
"rise to whatever it give rise to but"
"they can actually tell when they're in"
"the wrong configuration and it will keep"
"moving until the correct pattern is"
"constructed and tanning this process of"
"taking advantage of it is extremely"
"important over over 50 years ago people"
"realize that if you take a salamander"
"tail and graft it onto the edge of a"
"limb amputation so you put a tail where"
"the limb ought to be over the coming"
"months this this structure is actually"
"going to be remodeled from a tail into a"
"limb as this whole system seeks to"
"restore its large-scale global order so"
"understand what this means this is not"
"an individual cell deciding it's going"
"to be muscle or skin or anything else"
"this is large-scale decision making at"
"the level of the entire organism and so"
"fundamentally this is a computational"
"problem and we would like to use this as"
"inspiration for technology that can"
"implement this kind of highly robust"
"plastic behavior in the face of radical"
"deformation very new kinds of"
"environmental perturbations these"
"systems are able to regain their"
"structure and function now what"
"determines patterning we start life as"
"as an egg and than a collection of"
"embryonic stem cells and eventually this"
"is a cross-section taken through a"
"normal human torso you can see the"
"amazing invariant locations of all the"
"organs and the and the geometry of all"
"the structures where does this come from"
"DNA after all the genome specifies"
"proteins it does not say directly"
"anything about this this shape or how"
"it's edited how do cell groups know what"
"to make and when to stop and then as"
"engineers of course we'd like to know"
"how far can we push this process what's"
"possible to build what are the edges of"
"biological possibility and so you might"
"be surprised to know that as"
"developmental biologists we basically"
"don't know the answer to any of these"
"questions we have this significant"
"knowledge gap that while we're very good"
"at constructing these kinds of networks"
"we're in the we're we find out which"
"gene products interact with which other"
"gene products we can't yet read a genome"
"and find out what shape the resulting"
"organ M is going to be we can compare it"
"to other genomes where we already know"
"what it looks like but we can't read a"
"genome and figure out what the what"
"geometry had specifies what's what's"
"even worse in terms of medicine is that"
"if we wanted to fix an anatomical"
"structure here what we have our"
"molecular information of this kind we"
"have these networks that make it very"
"difficult to solve the inverse problem"
"that that will allow us to know what to"
"change at this level to make to have"
"outcomes desirable outcomes at the"
"system level and so we have here huge"
"opportunities for machine learning to"
"impact regenerative medicine beyond drug"
"discovery to help us be able to take"
"this kind of information and understand"
"how it maps to specific anatomy in"
"biology we're becoming very good at"
"manipulating molecules and cells the"
"very the very lowest level hardware that"
"is that is necessary for the control of"
"complex pattern what we don't really"
"understand yet are the algorithms that"
"are sufficient for the kind of pattern"
"editing examples that I just showed you"
"and so can we move biology beyond this"
"kind of machine code and I visualize it"
"like this where computer sciences have"
"this wonderful journey from from having"
"to alter the hardware when you were"
"programming all the way up to now"
"considerable platform independence where"
"you can really just focus on the control"
"algorithms and the computations biology"
"is still here everything we do"
"in our experiments is is rewiring the"
"actual hardware of the organism we have"
"not yet gotten to the point where we can"
"we can focus on the control algorithms"
"and really take advantage of the"
"hardware software distinction which I do"
"believe also exists in biology and this"
"is what my group has been trying to do"
"so pattern homeostasis has a number of"
"properties that are in a certain sense"
"cognitive they show goal directed"
"behavior towards specific outcomes they"
"show flexibility and robustness under"
"variable conditions and they allow"
"integration of self and low-level"
"functions into complex large-scale"
"outcomes and so what I want to talk to"
"you about now"
"are some of the progress that we've made"
"about understanding how electrical"
"mechanisms that is electrical"
"communication among cells allow this"
"kind of control and basically what I'm"
"going to show you everything in the next"
"section can be boiled down to one main"
"message that very much like the brain"
"somatic tissues form electrical networks"
"that make decisions the decisions they"
"make are not about behavior they're"
"about anatomy and we now can target the"
"system for some control of large-scale"
"pattern editing and so I show you this a"
"five legged frog here to point out that"
"this is not Photoshop I'm gonna show you"
"a bunch of really strange-looking"
"animals in a minute and this is these"
"are all real live creatures that are"
"that live in our lab because the way"
"that we test our various models of"
"whether we've understood how this works"
"is to try to make rational perturbations"
"we try to control anatomical"
"decision-making so it's important to"
"realize that brains did not invent their"
"tricks from scratch basically neurons"
"evolved from very ancient cells that"
"were around and performing computations"
"and doing somatic decision-making long"
"before neurons and brains showed up and"
"in fact our unicellular ancestors before"
"even the origin of multicellularity"
"already had synaptic machinery ion"
"channels neurotransmitters this by the"
"way if you've ever wondered why it is"
"that fungi which are very very distant"
"organism from ours from ourselves why"
"fungi have compounds in them like these"
"hallucinogenic mushrooms that are able"
"to affect human cognition it's because"
"the basic mechanisms are extremely"
"ancient there"
"very old and that basically in becoming"
"brains nervous systems speed optimized"
"functions that were already here long"
"before that and so we all know that in"
"the brain you have hardware that's"
"produced by these these ion channels"
"that enable cells in the brain to"
"communicate electrically with each other"
"so they mediated mediate electrical"
"state change or they can be propagated"
"through a network and this kind of"
"hardware gives rise to some very"
"interesting software that we would all"
"like to understand and take advantage of"
"so the cognitive and behavioral"
"processing that goes on in the"
"electrical network that is encoded and"
"enabled by this hardware well it turns"
"out that the rest of the body is not"
"very much different all cells not just"
"neurons have the exact same types of ion"
"channels they make electrical synapses"
"to their neighbors and they produce"
"electrical paths the electrical patterns"
"such as here what you're seeing here is"
"an early frog embryo this is this is"
"sped up this is about eight hours of an"
"early frog embryo and much like here you"
"can see the electrical activity of the"
"zebrafish brain as the zebrafish"
"processes visual information what you"
"can see here with pseudo color are all"
"the electrical conversations that these"
"cells are having with each other as they"
"figure out who's going to be front who's"
"going to be back left-right dorsal"
"ventral and so on so as people try to"
"understand how this to decode how the"
"electrical states of the brain stand for"
"different of memories behaviors and so"
"on we have to understand and we have to"
"crack this by electrical code how it is"
"that the changing electrical properties"
"of the tissues implement different"
"future anatomical States and so here's"
"an example this is just a snapshot of an"
"early frog tadpole like this this is the"
"mid flank the different colors are a"
"fluorescent voltage reporter that shows"
"us in living tissue what all the"
"electrical states are in each one of"
"these little circles is a single cell"
"and this cell has a variety of ion"
"channels just like neurons do that"
"enable them to maintain this particular"
"structure so this is what we call a V"
"mem or a membrane voltage pattern and"
"these patterns we're able to see them"
"using a variety of technologies such as"
"voltage sensitive fluorescent dyes"
"and we do a lot of quantitative"
"simulations to try and understand how"
"the different ion channel and pump"
"proteins give rise to specific patterns"
"in multicellular tissues these patterns"
"come in two flavors there are normal or"
"endogenous patterns so this is again a"
"frog embryo this time in greyscale and"
"you can see here that as it's putting"
"its face together here's basically a pre"
"pattern or a little map of what the gene"
"expression and the anatomy of the face"
"is going to look like so here's where"
"the eye is gonna form here's where the"
"mouth is going to be and so on so these"
"are patterns that are critical for"
"normal development if you move or"
"perturb these patterns the the anatomy"
"will be will be altered these patterns"
"can also be pathological here you see"
"the earliest signs of cancer we induced"
"a tumor in this temple but before the"
"tumor shows up these cells right here"
"you can already see their abnormal"
"electrical state as they stop"
"communicating with their neighbors and"
"sort of revert back to an almost"
"unicellular like existence and and"
"become become cancer cells so"
"functionally we've developed some tools"
"to control this type of signaling in"
"this non neural cell network basically"
"we do not apply electrical fields that"
"is that's not how this is done there's"
"no no electrical electrodes being used"
"here what we do is we manipulate the"
"endogenous ion channels that allow cells"
"to produce electrical States or we"
"perturb the connectivity so we can"
"either control the topology of the"
"network or actually the electrical state"
"and we use a variety of genetic"
"pharmacological optogenetic and those"
"kinds of techniques so I want to show"
"you some examples of why this is"
"important what you can do when you when"
"you alter the electrical circuits so one"
"thing you can do is you can convince"
"cell groups to become different organs"
"and I don't mean to control individual"
"cell types this is not about stem cell"
"differentiation but for example we can"
"take a region of this gut so this whole"
"thing is the gut of the temple we can"
"take this region we can change its"
"electrical properties by by opening a"
"particular kind of channel this"
"voltage-gated potassium channel and what"
"will happen is this whole once we"
"establish a particular electrical state"
"this whole region becomes an eye and if"
"you section this is a m-- interior"
"interior components that you would find"
"in a normal eye so retina optic nerve"
"lens all of these things are in there so"
"this is a modular control that"
"right here you're going to form an eye"
"the same thing can happen in planaria"
"where if we cut off the head in the tail"
"and we take this middle fragment which"
"has this very interesting head tail"
"electrical pre pattern what we can do is"
"take these cells and convince them that"
"they should make a head instead of a"
"tail and you see that here this is a"
"two-headed worm in fact you could go in"
"the other direction you can make a note"
"headed room and in all cases this is"
"very important this isn't this is"
"modular because what we're not doing is"
"going in and micromanaging the process"
"we are not trying to layout cell by cell"
"as you might if you are doing"
"bioengineering we're not trying to"
"layout cell by cell what the structure"
"is we're providing actually a fairly"
"small amount of information that tells"
"this region what it should be it's it's"
"basically a subroutine trigger at that"
"point and so you could use that using"
"this process some of the other things"
"you can do we can take this flat worm"
"that has a triangular head and when we"
"cut off the head we can treat the"
"remaining fragment in a way that"
"convinces the new cells to build heads"
"that belong to other species of flat"
"worms so here's a nice flat head like"
"this pea Felina or you can make a round"
"head like an S Mediterranean or a"
"triangular head like the original should"
"be notice that first of all it's about"
"150 million years of evolution that"
"separate these animals so you're making"
"heads with brain structures and stem"
"cell distributions that belong to these"
"other species across about 150 million"
"years of evolution also note that the"
"genome is here is normal we have not"
"done any genomic editing this is not"
"about changing the genome this is this"
"is purely a physiological change this is"
"interacting with the real-time software"
"as it were of the physiological system"
"not rewiring the genes or the or the the"
"protein networks that are existing in"
"this animal so all of these animals with"
"heads belonging to other species have a"
"perfectly normal wild-type genomic"
"sequence that belongs to Dez adhirata"
"safale so you can go further than this"
"and you can reach regions of the"
"planarian morphus space that evolution"
"isn't using so from a normal flat worm"
"you can make things like this that are"
"sort of spiky you can make these that"
"look like hats they're three-dimensional"
"they have an interior compartment or you"
"can make ones that look like this with"
"tubes coming out of their backs so we're"
"just now beginning to really understand"
"the way that different anatomical"
"structures are encoded in the electrical"
"properties of an F of the network but"
"it's very clear that there's a very"
"tractable a profoundly important level"
"of software control that can be"
"implemented beyond the genome all of"
"these animals have the same genomic"
"sequence and so this is really really"
"important to begin to learn how to"
"target this for our various applications"
"we've done lots of computational"
"modeling to try to understand these"
"electrical circuits and how the"
"dynamical systems properties of these"
"circuits map onto specific anatomical"
"outcomes and so one of the predictions"
"of this kind of unusual view that these"
"are all that these pattern memories are"
"states of physiological electrical"
"network is that we ought to be able to"
"rewrite this pattern memory and I want"
"to show you one example that we just"
"published last year which is that if we"
"take these normal-looking planaria so"
"one head one tail and in fact"
"molecularly if we look at the markers so"
"the head markers are in the head there"
"are no head markers in the tail and so"
"on these will give rise to a one-headed"
"worm if we chop off the head in the tail"
"these will give rise to a two-headed"
"worm why would an animal that has a"
"perfectly normal one headed anatomy and"
"apparently normal molecular molecular"
"expression pattern why would they give"
"rise to two-headed worms and the reason"
"and again this is not anything to do"
"with genomic editing and the reason is"
"because what we did was we went in and"
"we altered the electrical pre pattern"
"that dictates what this at what this"
"tissue is going to do if it is injured"
"in the future so this one had an animal"
"has an is bearing an electrical memory"
"that says that if I get injured in the"
"future what I'm going to do is build two"
"heads instead of one so the electrical"
"pattern is not a readout of what the"
"anatomy is now it is a piece of encoded"
"information a patterning Engram that is"
"used if if the animal is injured and it"
"is used to cut to to to guide"
"morphogenesis in the future so what we"
"see is that this body a single body like"
this
"can store at least one of two different"
"pattern memories it can store one headed"
"or a two-headed pattern memory no doubt"
"probably more we've only found been able"
"to access to so far now this this is"
"this is really a very important example"
"because it is not just"
"about changing the way that regeneration"
"progresses after the injury this is a"
"long-term phenomenon and by that what I"
"mean is that if we take this two-headed"
"worm and so so so we start with a"
"one-headed worm we amputate the head in"
"the tail we perturb the electrical"
"network you get a two-headed worm and"
"now we take this two-headed worm and we"
"leave him alone for a couple of weeks in"
"plain old water so normal or"
"manipulation of any kind we amputate the"
"original head we amputate this weird"
"ectopic posterior head and we ask what's"
"going to happen and when we first did"
"this experiment of course the standard"
"paradigm said that well the genomics of"
"the worm are normal and you're going to"
"cut off the CICC topic head so of course"
"the rest of it is just going to go back"
"to normal and you're gonna get this"
"normal one headed worm right and of"
"course I'm showing it to you because"
"that's not at all what happens what"
"happens is that in perpetuity once"
"you've shifted that electrical Network"
"that pattern memory has now been shifted"
"to a 2-headed state it is now"
"permanently two-headed so if you keep"
"cutting this animal again and again and"
"with no further manipulations it will"
"continue to regenerate to that new"
"specification of what a worm"
"should look like and and you can by the"
"way we have now ways to I take it back"
"and take a two-headed worm and remodel"
"it back to one head so this is very"
"interesting this has this has a number"
"of key properties of memory it's its"
"long-term stable its rewritable or"
"labile it has latency or conditional"
"recall as I just showed you we can do it"
"so that nothing happens until the animal"
"needs to recall it by from injury and it"
"has discrete possible outcomes one"
"headed or two headed so what we've been"
"doing is trying to develop techniques to"
"basically extend certain connectionist"
"models to this to this to help us guide"
"these experiments where stable"
"attractors in the state space of these"
"electrical circuits correspond to"
"specific downstream downstream anatomies"
"of course mediated by all the different"
"genes that they turn on and off so this"
"is really critical for us as now is to"
"understand the large-scale properties of"
"this bioelectric code and how these"
"pattern memories are literally encoded"
"in the stable states of tissues it's"
"important not only for the basic science"
"of it but for applications in"
"regenerative medicine"
"so unlike salamanders frogs do not"
"normally regenerate their legs so the"
"they grow nothing or a very thin card"
"latch in a spike when you amputate the"
"leg and what we've been able to do is to"
"come up with a cocktail that alters the"
"bioelectric state of the cells at the"
"wound to convince them to regenerate a"
"new leg so here you can see in 45 days"
"it's starting to make some toes here's a"
"toenail and then eventually it's a"
"pretty good leg that can feel touch and"
"it's both sensitive and motile so the"
"animal can use these legs and then"
"eventually you get some you get some"
"really nice you get some really nice"
"patterning and then you have to wait for"
"it to grow so the idea is that this is"
"the first steps towards a program for"
"regenerative medicine where we will be"
"able to induce cells and tissues to"
"regrow various complex organs this does"
"not require implantation of stem cells"
"it does not require genomic editing this"
"is purely about triggering the kinds of"
"cascades the kinds of patterning"
"subroutines that these animals already"
"have embedded in their electrical"
"software and of course next after this"
"frog is mammalian application so we're"
"trying to trying to work up to human"
"medicine at some point okay so one of"
"the other things we've been able to show"
"is to use some of our priyad predictive"
"with simulations of the by electrical"
"signaling to reverse a birth defects of"
"different types so here's what a tadpole"
"brain a normal tadpole brain should look"
"like you see here the the forebrain the"
"midbrain and hindbrain and under the"
"exposure to various teratogen sand we're"
"talking about things like alcohol"
"nicotine various other nasty chemicals"
"or even mutations in really important"
"genes such as knotch what you get are"
"severe brain defects so the forebrain is"
"basically missing the midbrain as a"
"bubble the hind brains all messed up"
"what we've been able to do is to produce"
"by electrical simulations that tell us"
"what electrical state we would have to"
"restore in order to get back a normal"
"brain and in fact from these simulations"
"we can extract information for candidate"
"drugs that will open and close various"
"ion channels and you can see here a"
"successful applications of this this"
"animal has a mutation it's expressing a"
"mutation in a gene called notch which"
"normally causes this terrible"
"malformation of the brain but the"
"structure the gene expression and even"
"the function of the brain so we gave"
"them IQ tests believe it or not you can"
"do that in that in tadpoles you can test"
"them for learning and memory and they"
"get there they get"
"memories back despite this this really"
"terrible genetic mutation so we really"
"think that this is this by electrical"
"network is an incredibly tractable layer"
"that allows us to intervene in the"
"default state that is encoded by the"
"genome and so in the future what we"
"would like to do this is kind of the"
"endgame for this field which is of a"
"very long way away but the idea is to"
"have a kind of biological compiler where"
"we would be able to design our creatures"
"the way people now design things in CAD"
"or for 3d printing where you can design"
"at the level of anatomy and then we"
"would understand well enough what you"
"would have to do to make this to make"
"this structure actually grow and"
"evolution learned very early on to"
"exploit the computational properties of"
"electrical circuits electrical circuits"
"as some very convenient properties in"
"terms of information processing and"
"evolution caught on to this very early"
"and so under cracking this by electrical"
"code will have impacts not only on"
"regenerative medicine but also in"
"synthetic by engineering morphological"
"computation and so on this is really I"
"think a very important emerging field"
"and so what I want to are close now with"
"is to talk a little bit about the future"
"and this idea that perhaps we could make"
"a highly robust machine learning"
"platform technology that is based on non"
"neural architectures and we really are"
"interested in collaborators for this is"
"it possible that some of the limitations"
"of current machine learning is because"
"people have really been focusing on"
"imitating brains and especially human"
"brain architectures and what would"
"happen if we stepped way back and based"
"our attempts at this on send on cells"
"and tissues that are doing much more"
"much more fundamental information"
"processing than than than what we see in"
"brains so in fact some people have"
"started looking at this in other"
"structures so so bone heart pancreatic"
"cells all of these cells have been shown"
"to exhibit aspects of learning and in"
"particular robust adjustment to novel"
"conditions one of the most amazing"
"things about living things is how good"
"they are at adapting to novel"
"circumstances that they've never seen"
"before and cracking this problem will be"
"very important for robust robotics and"
"artificial intelligence but it's"
"to note that this is already present in"
"cells long before they Accord the"
"animals acquired brains so one of the"
"things that we're doing is to try to"
"extend the basic results of"
"connectionism neural networks and all of"
"those kinds of things to beyond the"
"brain try to try to develop a kind of"
"mathematics and and training algorithms"
"that can be used on non neural networks"
"and the other thing that we're doing is"
"we've we've had a little bit of success"
"coming up with contributions to what's"
"called the robot scientist field which"
"is basically which is basically"
"platforms that use machine learning to"
"help us actually understand what's going"
"on and to discover not just not just to"
"do number crunching but actually"
"discover a models of the kinds of"
"systems that were working with and so"
"what I would like to do now is to thank"
"the all the people that have done some"
"of the work that I've shown you today I"
"want to thank my funders in particularly"
"the Paul G Allen frontiers group and"
"DARPA and if you wanted to see what"
"two-headed worms actually look like and"
"behave like this is what it is here you"
"see them and we now we actually have"
"openings both for postdoctoral work and"
"for visiting scientists so if anybody is"
"interested in making robotic bodies for"
"various biological systems new AI"
"platforms based on non neural"
"architectures machine learning and all"
"kinds of computer science applications"
"we would love to collaborate and you can"
"get in touch with me here and I will"
"take questions thank you"
"hey how do you determine which"
"electrical activity is just due to like"
"functional movement and things like this"
"in the organisms day to day life and"
"which aspects are going to be used for"
"something like regeneration and then how"
"do you actually edit it yeah so okay so"
"so the the convenient thing is that the"
"kinds of electrical states that are"
"important for decision making at the"
"anatomical level have a very different"
"time scale than the kinds of things that"
"guide behavior so anything that has to"
"do with muscle motion with neural"
"activity the time scale you're talking"
"about is milliseconds okay the"
"electrical activity that we deal with"
"these patterns are stable and they"
"change over a scale of minutes hours in"
"some cases days so it's an entirely"
"different set of if you will frequencies"
"that you deal with and the way we I"
"think your second question was how do we"
"edit it yeah so so there's there's a"
"couple of different approaches that we"
"take in our model systems that we use at"
"the bench the best way to edit it is to"
"knock in controllable ion channels so we"
"will put in novel maybe light gated"
"maybe drug gate at different ion"
"channels that allow us to have very fine"
"control over all the electrical"
"properties in biomedical applications"
"you this kind of gene therapy is"
"probably best avoided so what we do"
"there is to develop cocktails of drugs"
"that will open and close specific iron"
"channels that are already in the patient"
"so we have a variety of computational"
"tools that let us look at what channels"
"and pumps are expressed in the tissue of"
"interest and then try to come up with a"
"strategy that's going to get us to the"
"electrical signaling that we want does"
"that interfere with the like short-term"
"electrical signaling it really doesn't"
"one of the one of the really remarkable"
"things that we found so I should I"
"should point out that back in about 2000"
"when we first suggested this kind of"
"idea this was considered completely"
"crazy people said that electrical"
"properties of cells are housekeeping"
"parameters and that if we mess with it"
"everything's gonna die that you're gonna"
"get uninterpretable you know toxicity"
"none of that is true it turns out that"
"cells are very very good at"
"distinguishing the different types of"
"electrical signals and things that we do"
"at the long-term scale do not affect"
"behavior they can of course you can"
"overdo it I mean part of what we've been"
"doing for the last 15 years is coming up"
"with protocols"
"that have the least amount of side"
"effects possible right so you certainly"
"can overwhelm the system but these these"
"are designed to work in parallel and in"
"fact in all of these organisms the"
"regenerating planarian or the"
"regenerating salamander this is running"
"around eating behaving doing all that"
stuff
"while all the cells are figuring out"
"what to do so there's a multi scale set"
"of problem solving that does not"
"interfere with each other"
"phenomenal talk thank you okay thank you"
"very much for your a very interesting"
"talk actually you know I was very"
"excited about your biological inspired"
"work and then I think you know there's a"
"research area called synthetic biology"
"and then people are trying to create"
"actually you know people can create"
"artificial cell from scratch and also"
"you know now if you attach electrode to"
"the small insects you can you know"
"control the insects by sending a signal"
"to them and also you know people are"
"trying to create truly intelligent"
"robots by from robotics perspective and"
"also in an algorithmic perspective so"
"I'd like to know you're in a personal"
"opinion about what is the correct"
"direction of true and creating truly"
"intelligent agent or creatures or"
"whatever I mean yeah all right well I"
"can say a couple things we do have a"
"section of my group it works on"
"synthetic morphology so we have some"
"really promising it's not published yet"
"so I didn't bring it up here but there's"
"the way we have some pretty amazing new"
"data on the ability of cells to learn to"
"cooperate in completely different"
"configurations so you can make"
"artificial living machines that are"
"nothing like the animal that from which"
"they came and they're able to learn to"
"cooperate and through some sort of a"
"combination of emergence and guided"
"self-assembly we can make some some"
"machines that are just you know just"
"amazing I think that's a very exciting"
"exciting field of course the other thing"
"that is really interesting is to try to"
"extract some of the policies that cells"
"and tissues use and try to implement"
"them either directly in the hardware or"
"to bio interface so so we've done a"
"little bit of that to is try to"
"interface some you know the UM one of"
"the one of the things I didn't bring up"
"here for for lack of time is we found"
"out that if you if you make a tadpole"
"where the eyes are on the tail instead"
"of in the head those tadpoles can see"
"out of that are those eyes perfectly"
"well if"
"the brain has you know for millions of"
"years its benefit it's evolved to expect"
"visual input from this region up in the"
"head and all of a sudden now there's"
"this weird itchy patch of tissue in the"
"back that sort of sending you some"
"signals the brain has no trouble"
"figuring out that that's visual data and"
"being able to learn so those plasticity"
"ziz is incredible and we need to we need"
"to understand how this works and then I"
"think I think the artifacts that we make"
"are going to be just transformative"
"thank you"
"great talk yes do we know something"
"about plants in terms of electrical"
"signaling and also there is mechanical"
"signaling which is very slow relatively"
"slow so do you know anything about"
"interactions between these different"
"modes yeah"
"great questions so plants yes my group"
"doesn't work on plants but there's a"
"couple of other labs that do and it's"
"it's very interesting plants do very"
"similar things with electrical signaling"
"as a lot of what I showed you here is"
"true in plants as well which is"
"remarkable because plants and animals"
"shared different origins of"
"multicellularity right so they both"
"discovered this independently and that's"
"because they're the ancestors even from"
"bacteria so even bacterial biofilms"
"propagate potassium waves that are brain"
"like and there's been some interesting"
"work on that so the decision-making for"
"example and plant roots as they as they"
"go through the soil and figure out where"
"they're gonna go all the way through"
"morphogenesis of the plant itself a lot"
"of what I've said here it holds holds"
"for plants as well mechanical forces"
"yeah mechanical forces are absolutely"
"also important in all of this and"
"mechanics interacts tightly with bio"
"electrics there are stretch and"
"pressure-sensitive ion channels so they"
"will convert mechanical forces into"
"electrical forces and there are proteins"
"that do the reverse that basically under"
"electrical gradients across the membrane"
"they will exert stress and strain so so"
"those systems interact also of course"
"both of them interact with more familiar"
"genetic and biochemical signaling and so"
"these are three pieces of the puzzle and"
"the whole system is kind of this this"
"dynamical system where all of these"
"things constantly interact the one"
"question that we always ask ourselves is"
"at what point in that control structure"
"is it most efficient to intervene so"
"right now the majority of my colleagues"
are
"are working on biochemistry and genetics"
"oh so they're intervening at the"
"molecular level so they're looking for"
"growth factors and diffusible signals"
"what we have seen is that intervening"
"and the electrical level gives extremely"
"efficient control so if you want an eye"
"you can try to assemble it cell by cell"
"but it's really much more efficient to"
"trigger the whole the whole subroutine"
"as it were and so I think that a lot of"
"the important decisions are made at the"
"electrical level but it's absolutely"
"true that mechanical forces and did you"
"know transcriptional and chemical"
"networks are downstream as part of how"
"this stuff gets executed in the actual"
"tissue hi thank you for your talk it was"
"very fascinating so you talked a lot"
"about how on-like cells that regenerate"
"limbs are making some sort of decision"
"and you said that plant roots they make"
"decisions as they navigate through the"
"ground and somewhere on a higher level"
"we also make decisions in our brain so"
"somewhere between there this thing"
"called consciousness arises is there any"
"sort of real definition of consciousness"
"and if so is it a gradient is it a line"
"dude can you speak to that at all yeah"
"III get into enough trouble talking"
"about decision making at the level of"
"cells so I don't think I'm gonna void"
"opinion on cautiousness per se because"
"there's a lot of people that work on"
"this and argue about that stuff but I"
"will say that there is there is an"
"emerging field of basal cognition and"
"these are groups of people that talk"
"that talk about memory learning sensing"
"creativity all the kinds of things all"
"the way from bacteria plants animals"
"cells and and in fact even group"
"colonial organisms like ant hills you"
"know there are things that an anthill"
"knows that the individual ants don't"
"know and so on so there's lots of people"
"that worry about that kind of stuff and"
"we discuss all these things at meetings"
"so I don't think I'm I haven't eating"
"profound to say specifically about"
"consciousness but I do feel very"
"strongly that all of this is a continuum"
"that there is nothing radically special"
"about it there's a lot of people that"
"feel that some of these terms should be"
"left sort of exclusively in the realm of"
"human psychology and I think that's a"
"profound mistake I think that's a that's"
"a mistake both on evolutionary grounds"
"and you know just in there is no"
"principled distinction there are only"
"shades of the shades of quantitative"
difference
"and so you can see things like"
"anticipation yeast can anticipate you"
"know yeast can learn simple patterns and"
"they'll anticipate to them there these"
"things go all the way down to the to the"
"very base of the Tree of Life and so"
"what you're gonna call us consciousness"
"I mean I have I have a very good"
"colleague who thinks that cautious a"
"consciousness appears when something she"
"calls you al unlimited associative"
"learning takes place and there are only"
"some organisms that are able to carry"
"out a kind of generic associative"
"learning and and some organisms cannot"
"and that's where she puts the line I'm"
"not sure I think it's as reasonable as"
"anything else but for sure it's a"
"continuum and whether it's consciousness"
"or just functional cognitive abilities"
"they go all the way to the beginning"
"thanks very much"
"I was amazed by your talk when you apply"
"these frequencies or this electronical"
"signal how do you do that do you put in"
"just like an electrode into something or"
"are you poking it with something and"
"what is the time frame that these"
"signals need to be applied right time"
"frame that's an important question"
"so under and we never apply any"
"electrical fields we have no electrodes"
"we apply no electrical fields and we"
"don't do anything with frequencies what"
"we try to do is to alter the endogenous"
"state of resting potential across cells"
"and the way we do that is we target the"
"ion channel proteins that are"
"endogenously expressed in these cells we"
"either close them we open them and we"
"thus affect the electrical state so this"
"is done either genetically or"
"pharmacologically in the case of our"
"regenerative medicine applications is"
"with drugs small molecule drugs but we"
"can in let's say in tadpoles with you"
"know a really nice way to do it as"
"optogenetics you put in something like"
"channelrhodopsin and then you shine a"
"light and and the pattern of the light"
"can tell it can real you can you can"
"really have pretty fine control over"
"where the electrical states go the time"
"scale is really critical because a lot"
"of the types of effects that I've shown"
"you are literally triggers to these what"
"we call these subroutine calls right of"
"patterning the time that you have to do"
"it is incredibly short so in the Frog"
"leg we treat the wound we treat the"
"amputation wound for 24 hours that gives"
"you nine months of leg growth so after"
"the first 24 hours you walk"
"you never touch it again and the whole"
"thing goes for 24 hours you could"
"intervene at different steps of the wave"
"instead of a frog leg you wanted"
"something else you could go in and try"
"to make it do something else and we're"
"certainly working on that as a way to"
"understand what's happening but the"
"treatments are often incredibly brief"
"because these one of the properties of"
"these electrical circuits is they have"
"these stable attractors that once you"
"knock them into that sort of"
"neighborhood of the state space you"
"don't need to hold them there they're"
"gonna they're gonna maintain state and"
"so our goal is to map out all of these"
"things to understand what is the minimum"
"we can do to get the maximum outcome"
"thank you hi could you talk more about"
"these new architectures these non neural"
"architectures and what would that get us"
"would we have more compositional systems"
"more flexible ones things that don't"
"just think but also feel or even look at"
"testbed for designing new organisms or"
"new like use that to design biology yeah"
"I think I think what it's going to get"
"us I don't know if it's going to get us"
"systems that feel and and how we would"
"know if they did that's a whole other"
"sort of kettle of fish but I what I"
"think it's going to get us is much more"
"robust adaptive systems one of the"
"things that biological systems are"
"really good at is adaptively adjusting"
"to very novel environments and so I"
"think one of the problems that we have"
"in this field and you guys can correct"
"me if I'm wrong but I think that one of"
"the problems we have is that systems"
"that are very good at one particular"
"task often are not that great when you"
"shift it to it to a different task"
"biology isn't like that these these"
"these cells are and these tissues are"
"incredibly good at dealing with with"
"very novel scenarios in an adaptive way"
"and well one of the differences between"
"biological structures and and the kinds"
"of artifacts that I've seen people make"
"is that biology as competency at every"
"level so the individual molecular"
"networks have memory and flexibility the"
"cells do the tissues do the organs do"
"every level has its own competency so"
"you're building things out of very"
"intelligent components and their various"
"other things that we can talk about it"
"you know at length but I think what it's"
"going to get us is systems that are"
"fundamentally good at pursuing goals in"
"the light of an unfriendly and"
"that's what that's what all of life is"
"right these biological systems have very"
"specific goals the environment throws"
"all kinds of crazy scenarios at them and"
"they are really good at navigating all"
"of that and I think we don't really know"
"how to do that so that's what we'll get"
"and one more do you have any sketch of"
"how we would build such a thing I have I"
"have many ideas on how we should try and"
"so I'm happy to talk to you afterwards"
"and talk details thank you hi I found"
"this is an absolutely incredible talk"
"and one thing that that came to mind"
"when I was thinking about this talk was"
"ethical concerns it seems like when"
"you're working with like small animals"
"doesn't really matter but when you start"
"getting into humans and start doing"
"things that could potentially have"
"really systemic effects in them that"
"they're that people may start objecting"
"to that and I'm wondering if you have"
"thoughts about how to head off those"
"ethical concerns sure yeah good question"
"I I can say a couple of things I think"
"that on the one hand I'll point out that"
"in terms of in terms of F Milk ethical"
"concerns the kinds of things that I've"
"been talking about here are way low on"
"the list of compared to competing"
"technologies that are already out there"
"so people that are doing genomic editing"
"people that are doing infectious disease"
"research you know creating novel viruses"
"and I mean the stuff that's that's being"
"done is like you know way beyond"
"anything we're talking about here and in"
"fact on that scale this is actually"
"fairly subtle because what I'm"
"specifically saying is I think we can"
"develop a strategy for regenerative"
"medicine that does not require"
"manipulating the genome it does not"
"require any kind of viral delivery"
"vectors are all this so so I think I"
"think I think there are way bigger"
"problems in in the field and then what"
"and what you know then what we're doing"
"in terms of in terms of ethics all right"
"well thanks very much hi so ml community"
"has done some work in mimicking signal"
"transduction networks particularly in"
"t-cells or immune cells in general and"
"so I'm curious if you can help me"
"understand what the relationship between"
"some of these ion channel based networks"
"and signal transduction networks are"
"and how that kind of ties into the AI"
"theme and secondly so the assistant the"
"computational assistants biology"
"community has kind of developed a lot of"
"computational models of this type of"
"thing so weight ranging from Eau de"
"based networks to partial differential"
"equations to like boolean networks time"
"to scale those up to a whole mob"
"wholesale models does that relate to"
"what you're talking about here in terms"
"this AI platform for non zero"
"architectures and relationships are you"
"doing any of that in your lab it's yeah"
"it's real a that that's actually a very"
"kind of lengthy question it sounds like"
"we should take that up okay yeah I think"
"we can talk about that at length that"
"that's that that'll take a pretty"
"lengthy a pretty lengthy answer but I'm"
"very happy to talk to you about it it's"
"high rated question it's there is a"
"longer story of reaction diffusion"
"models for patterning and so I was"
"wondering if it's a mechanism you and to"
"some extent it has been confirmed with"
"BMP signaling in name bands so I was"
"wondering what is your view of the"
"interaction of this electrical system"
"with a reaction diffusion system is it"
"upstream is it interfering with it is it"
"the reaction diffusion system itself"
"yeah so so two things we as far as we"
"can tell right now in the cases that"
"we've looked at it is upstream so it"
"helps control the downstream are the"
"systems for chemical morphogens and as"
"far as what was the other sorry what was"
"the second question"
"I was wondering if it could be the"
