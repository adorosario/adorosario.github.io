"the view in our cognitive scientists"
"today is that we construct our"
"perceptions of reality in real time"
"the questions was could we be"
"misinterpreting the content of our"
"perceptual experiences"
"and what is our current understanding in"
"a biology of science according to"
"Evolution what we perceive with our"
"brain and our senses does not reflect"
"the true natives of the reality why"
"should you care the implications of such"
"radical finding Rock the foundations of"
"our belief system that space-time it's"
"fundamental in this Theory we are"
"delighted to have professor emeritus or"
"cognitive signs Donald Hoffman and"
"professor of Developmental and synthetic"
"biology Michael Levin joining us today"
"to discuss the idea and we are going to"
"look at what is a conscious agency"
"welcome to Professor Levin welcome from"
"Professor Hoffman"
"thank you thank you thanks for having us"
absolutely
"how's the new year treating both"
"professors so far did you go have a good"
holiday
"yeah sure yes healthy and uneventful"
"which is good yeah nothing to complain"
"about any"
"I think they complain about"
"any new project for 2023"
"um many many things so so in our lab we"
"have a variety of uh kind of uh"
"conceptual and computational projects"
"and also a bunch of bench work stuff so"
"we have we have lots of things going on"
"in the in the areas of well the"
"practicalities come out as Cancer birth"
"defects regenerative medicine those"
"kinds of things"
"it is our desire to understand"
"collective intelligence which I think is"
"all intelligence and and how it is that"
"uh minds are sort of um emerge in the in"
"the physical world and so so we we are"
"finding new ways to try to communicate"
"with with cellular uh swarms in the body"
"as a kind of collective intelligence and"
"we've got some some interesting things"
"on looking at the different uh"
"competencies of things like Gene"
"regulatory networks um in addition to"
"other other models like slime molds and"
"things so yeah lots of lots of new stuff"
"on that along along those lines"
"busy it's going to keep you busy and"
"don't you that's that's quite a lesson I"
"think that's the impressive list"
"um well we're focused on a number of"
"projects but most interesting to me is"
"the physicists"
um
"tell us that space time is doomed and"
"they're they're not just saying that"
"they're finding new structures Beyond"
"space-time right they're they're"
"actually finding these structures like"
"the amplitohedron and the deepest"
"structure or something called decorated"
"permutations and"
"but but these are just like static"
"structures Beyond SpaceTime we've been"
"looking for a Dynamics Beyond space-time"
"um dynamical system that would actually"
"give rise to these structures like the"
"the deepest structure is the decorated"
"permutation and so we just published a"
"paper last week"
"in which we did that so we we prove that"
"uh it's apparently a new mathematical"
"result that you can canonically map"
"Markov chains uh any Markov chain to"
"decorated permutations"
"and so that that gives us a window now"
"to start to interpret"
"these these structures Beyond space-time"
"in terms of markovian Dynamics and so"
"that's what we're doing now so we have"
"uh the the project I'm working on now is"
"to show we have a markovian dynamics of"
"conscious agents that's what made us"
"look after you know these Markov chain"
"ideas and see if we could you know turn"
"them into decorator permutations that"
"was the motivation because we already"
"have a markovian dynamics of"
"Consciousness and so that's what we're"
"up to now is okay now that we have this"
"map of our conscious agent Dynamics so"
"it's a model of conscious agents beyond"
"space time into decorated permutations"
"that now should instruct us exactly how"
"to Port"
"specific properties of the conscious"
"agent Dynamics to specific physical"
"properties like Mass momentum Spin and"
"energy and so forth so that's that's"
"what I'm excited to do because that link"
"has told us where exactly to look in our"
"conscious agent Dynamics and so we're"
"looking there and we're finding some"
"beautiful mathematical structures and"
"getting hints about how they project to"
"properties in space-time so so we're"
"trying to so that's my project"
"um to map that out and then make"
"explicit proposals for how kind could be"
"tested with the data on"
"the infrastructure of protons so the"
scattering
"experiments that have been done since"
"the 1960s at Stanford linear accelerator"
"and then"
"much more powerful ones later on they've"
"given us tremendous amount of detail"
"about the inner structure the Quark glue"
"on and so forth the structure the"
"part-time structure of and their"
"momentum distributions inside protons so"
"that's my goal this year is to try to"
"actually predict those distributions"
"from a theory of conscious agents that's"
"beyond space-time that would be that"
"would be a good year"
"um on the 20th of December Professor 11"
"tweeted when I was five I asked my dad"
"where a certain toy was that I couldn't"
"find he said you know how today's click"
"server into tomorrow while you sleep on"
"at night well the toy didn't make it I"
"wouldn't say that's responsible for my"
"old weird thinking actions but I spent a"
"long time thinking about how frame of"
"time and days works"
"how some object passed from yesterday to"
"today and how that apparently can fail"
"and how we as mine say in yesterday or"
"successfully Make It Forward try to say"
"a whole night to catch the transaction"
"transitions very disturbing at the time"
"Professor Levin could you speak on the"
"toy that missing"
"yeah I I remember it quite clearly"
"um it was a it was a it was some sort of"
"plastic gun or something like this and"
"uh and I remember my I I couldn't find"
"it anywhere and I'm sure I'm sure"
"probably somebody threw it away and my"
"dad without skipping a beat he said he"
"said oh yeah you know like at night when"
"things you know go over from today or"
"more yeah it didn't make it so you know"
"that's it you can give up it just didn't"
"make it and I walked away thinking oh my"
"God that's that there's a thought like"
"like what well what determines whether"
"things make it and and what if I don't"
"make it and and what happens and then I"
"try to stay up of course all night"
"wanting to catch that um you know"
"wanting to catch that moment uh whenever"
"I wasn't I wasn't able to I would just"
"fall asleep somewhere around midnight"
"and like damn I missed it again"
"um but you know uh so I don't know how"
"much how much that was responsible for"
"some of the strange things I think about"
but
"um I do I do think that uh one one of"
"the things that I've been thinking about"
"recently is this uh which I think it"
"relates that is this notion of a lot of"
"what we do relates to this notion of"
"selfhood or being a self you know what"
"does it mean to be a permanent or or not"
"not a permanent but a stable cognitive"
"structure because much like with bodies"
"which are a kind of ship of Theseus sort"
"of thing right molecules come and go all"
"the time cells come and go all the time"
"but something stays the same so what is"
"that and what are the policies that the"
"other cells and molecules are"
"implementing that allows some sort of"
"stable large-scale Collective to remain"
"while the low-level parts are swapped"
"out at will and it's not always a policy"
"to maintain status quo it might be more"
"metamorphosis it might be all kinds of"
"changes that you know regeneration and"
"development but but in any case you need"
"to maintain some sort of large-scale"
"coherence even though the parts are are"
"changing out all the time so I was"
"thinking about this with respect to the"
"uh to cognition as well if you're going"
"to be a stable mind of some sort you"
"need to allow ID"
"and go and uh you need to be in"
"different states but it it can't be"
"something that just completely erases"
"you you know every time you have a new"
"thought well that's it now you're you"
"know now you're gone so so so that that"
"balanced with the opposite idea which"
"comes from many places but among them"
"from Buddhist ideas of of an impermanent"
"self or perhaps an illusory even even"
"maybe an illusory self"
"so I've been I've been thinking about"
"that a lot and trying to play with these"
"ideas of stability but but changeability"
"and the robustness and yet plasticity"
and
"one way I now think about this is that"
"the self"
"is it's not so much that it's completely"
"illusory but it but it has to be"
"recreated at every moment in time and"
"what I mean by that is just that at any"
"given moment right now"
"everything you know about or you think"
"you know about yourself your past"
"everything else you have to reconstruct"
"from the memory traces in your brain you"
"don't actually have access to anything"
"that really happened before"
"whether they be molecules or"
"physiological structures we actually"
"don't know what it is really but"
"whatever it is that you've got hold of"
"right now you have this narrow uh slice"
"of now which is I don't know a couple of"
"hundred milliseconds maybe and that's"
"your self and then you you sort of have"
"to reconstruct everything you think you"
"know from whatever memory molecules or"
"you know engrams that you find laying"
"around in your in your brain that's your"
"only and of course people have played"
"with this uh you know for these sort of"
"um I think I think maybe humor somebody"
"it's a you know or or boltzmann brains"
"you know this idea that all your"
"memories could have been created and"
"really hadn't and I don't mean I don't"
"mean this this sort of bizarre um"
"skeptico thing that can't be disproven I"
"just mean literally that at every moment"
"as a cognitive agent you have to be"
"constructing a model of yourself from"
"the evidence that you have which and"
"where does it come from well whatever"
"engrams happen to be in your in your you"
"know in your brain and so this uh you"
"know you can imagine yourself as these"
"like slices in this in this uh you know"
"and I'm sure I'm sure this is you know"
"as Don was saying there's probably an"
"outdated view already but I sort of"
"imagined it as these slices of this of"
"this giant space-time loaf so to speak"
"and each and each one you're basically"
"you have to recreate yourself from"
"scratch and uh and and then and if and"
"and that way what happens is that you"
"can think of everything you've done in"
"the past and all the memories that were"
"formed in the past"
"patience from a past self to a future"
"self and everything you're doing now are"
"messages that you are in fact leaving"
"for your future self in a way right"
"because so the memories that you're"
"forming now and the things you're doing"
"now are things that some future version"
"of you is going to be using those to"
"base their model of what the heck is"
"going on and when and who am I and and"
"of course there are medical versions of"
"this so people with anterior grade"
"Amnesia who can't form new memories what"
"do they do they they leave right so so"
"you wake up in the morning even that is"
"notepad and on the notepad first thing"
"it says is hey by the way you've got"
"anterior grade Amnesia this is who you"
"are and this is what's going on and the"
"last thing is don't forget to don't"
"forget to write"
"and so we all do this all the time it's"
"just that typically our pads are"
"internal so that right so that's all it"
"is exactly the same problem because you"
"must reconstruct yourself it's just on a"
"smaller scale and and it's somehow"
"internal so anyway that's that's my my"
"ramblings on that that that's how I've"
"been thinking about this"
"thank you"
"what did you think time is then is it uh"
"is it a you know space and time is it"
"more like a data structure"
"could just freak on that please"
"great question I'll just say one thing"
"along the lines of what Mike was saying"
"I agree with what you're saying Mike and"
"and it and it's"
"quite interesting because every time you"
"access those memories"
"um you destroy them you have to do"
"memory reconcile you have to actually"
"rebuild the memories all the time as"
"well so so you're rebuilding yourself"
"all the time it's not like the memory is"
"there and it's always there you know"
"every time you access it you have to"
"rebuild it so that's"
"yeah the framework in which you're"
"talking about you know the space-time"
"loaf is has been the standard you know"
"physicalist framework you know since"
"since Einstein um for so for over a"
"century now"
"um and but it's interesting how the"
"physicists realize that that space-time"
"itself isn't is not fundamental and so"
"so it doesn't mean that those ideas are"
"wrong it it means that that way of"
"thinking about them will have to be"
"understood at a deeper level right we'll"
"have to have a deeper representation"
"Beyond space-time and that uh you know"
"of physics or whatever Beyond space-time"
"that projects down to the space-time low"
"and projects down to the processes we"
"see like memory reconsolidation and so"
"forth the neural processes so those so"
so
"the space and time are not fundamental"
"you know then and the physicists are the"
"physicists are the ones who are"
"not me it's the physicists that are"
"saying space-time is doomed it it"
"um their own theories so Quantum field"
"Theory and general relativity together"
"are are very clear that it's a data"
"structure that works down to 10 to the"
"minus 33 centimeters and then falls"
apart
"so it's actually a a really shallow data"
"structure it's 10 to the minus 33 not 10"
"to the minus 33 trillion just 10 to the"
"minus 33 centimeters the thing falls"
"apart and so so that means that by the"
"way time also falls apart that 10 to the"
"minus 43 seconds"
so
"so I"
"take the physicists that they were"
"space-time is doomed and that that means"
"that time is doomed"
"right so your question is about time so"
"so we we and and that also by the way"
means
"ultimately the strategy and science of"
that
"if you go to smaller and smaller scales"
"of space-time you find more and more"
"fundamental objects and more and more"
"fundamental laws that's the that's the"
"reductionism that's precisely the"
"reductionism I mean that reductionism is"
"false it it it it it it it it just does"
"work Beyond 10 to the minus 33"
"centimeters and in fact it falls apart"
"well before then well you get these uvir"
"correspondences that blow things up well"
"before that so"
"so I think that"
"time is and space are merely interface"
"Concepts they're they're what we use to"
"get by"
"um in but they're not the reality and"
"the and the reality is something"
"entirely outside space and time and and"
"I'll just mention that our work and"
"evolution of a natural selection agrees"
"with with the physicists Evolution also"
"entails that space and time and objects"
"in space and time are not fundamental so"
"so that means that neurons don't exist"
"when they're not perceived but but but"
"that is not to put down neurobiology in"
"fact what I say is we need more money"
"for neurobiology because we realize it's"
"a lot harder than we ever thought we"
"thought you know there's 86 billion"
"neurons in the brain and you know that's"
"a hard problem but but that's just the"
"interface representation that that's"
"that's the the dumbed down version the"
"the real complex version is being hidden"
"from us and we have to really reverse"
"engineer neurobiology and space time to"
"something deeper it's going to be far"
"more complicated and we'll have to see"
"how it projects down to space time so so"
"I think that that time is is not"
"fundamental and in our markovian"
"dynamics of of conscious agents"
"um there is no entropic Arrow of time"
"necessary in the Dynamics so we can have"
"a Dynamics in which there is a sequence"
"parameter but there is the entropy does"
"not increase"
um
"but it turns out it's a theorem that if"
"you take a um"
"projection of the Dynamics"
"um on by say conditional probability"
"that any projected view of the Dynamics"
"you'll get a new Dynamics that's a you"
"know a projection of the bigger Dynamics"
"the the fundamental damage that new"
"Dynamics will have an era of time"
"just because of the loss of information"
"that happened in the projection process"
"so so that makes sense space time is"
"just our virtual reality headset it's a"
"projection it loses information"
"we have the narrow of time because of"
"that loss of information in other words"
"time is not an insight into the nature"
"of reality it's just an artifact of the"
"projection process purely an artifact"
"and not a not an insight"
"there's more to say but I'll stop there"
"because I don't want to donate"
"Mike you agree oh"
"you have anything to add to that Mike"
"yeah I said well I think I think it's a"
"it's a it's a very profound idea and uh"
"and I think that uh I I wonder if we can"
"generalize it to say that uh it's almost"
"it's almost guaranteed that uh agents uh"
"will will build models of their world"
"that uh may or may not uh agree with"
"other agents models of their world"
"because as Don has very nicely shown um"
"rigorously uh Evolution isn't looking"
"for that it's just looking for uh"
"expedient representations and so uh it's"
"entirely possible that there are I mean"
"so so Chris fields and I work on this"
"kind of stuff a lot from the perspective"
"of observers and this idea that"
"everything is some observers Vantage"
"Point description and so"
"um I think it makes complete sense to me"
"that from certain Vantage points uh"
"things look like there's there's space"
"and time but you know it's like it's"
"like we we have mathematical tools you"
"know neural Nets and things like that"
"that will take exp that take their"
"experience and project it into some"
"crazy space where you can't make heads"
"or tails of what the principal"
"components are and and and because and"
"this is what happens to to us all we"
"make we make some kind of representation"
"that seems to be good enough for for"
"survival and various other things but"
"but none of that should be taken as as"
"as fundamental and the other the other"
"thing that um this is maybe stepping"
"away a little bit but but I think it"
"Bears on this on this topic as far as"
"you know space space and time have"
"served uh well they've in physics right"
"they've done a nice job and everything"
"but I think I think we have to uh"
"somebody somebody once said I remember"
"who it was that um uh if you show me uh"
"the fishing net that you're using I'll"
"show you the fish You're Gonna Catch"
"which is that we have to think about"
"what are these tools good for and what"
"are they not good for and one of the"
"things that I've been increa"
"increasingly sort of focusing on is this"
"idea that"
"the world looks like a mechanical"
"mechanistic place when you use tools"
"that are low agency tools so when you"
"use voltmeters and rulers and things"
"like this all you're ever going to see"
"is low agency stuff you're going to see"
"things that look like mechanism of"
"course it's going to look like mechanism"
"because that's the that's the lens"
"you're using and uh and so we can't then"
"assume that well that must be right and"
"and just assume that okay it's all got"
"to be bottom up because those are the"
"tools that we use and what if what if uh"
"the things you're going to find have to"
"be in some impedance match almost"
"the tools that you're using and and now"
"now and so we suppose you're you're"
"looking for things like agents or you're"
"looking for virtual Governors or top you"
"know top-down controllers you're not"
"going to find that with with low agency"
"tools what can you find that with well"
"you find it with brains and you find it"
"with with you know Minds that are primed"
"to look for agency these things that"
"that are uh you know we we don't have a"
"voltmeter that measures um uh you know a"
"things from causal information the"
"theory and whatnot you know these these"
"these the things that you know Eric Hall"
"and other folks uh study these high"
level
"um integrated information and all that"
"we don't you don't have a voltmeter of"
"that of course you don't but but and so"
"you don't find any of that when you use"
"those tools all you ever see is"
"mechanism but when you look at the world"
"using a tool for example our own uh mind"
"and our observational system"
"then we're very good at detecting agency"
"of course we make mistakes in both"
"directions right we have false positive"
"and false negatives but but minds are"
"really good tools to find other minds"
"voltmeters are not and so right so so"
"maybe that so maybe there's something"
"there maybe it's it's this idea that yes"
"of course these things have been with us"
"and they do a nice job on the kinds of"
"things that they're good at which is"
"describing mechanical mechanistic"
"interactions and I think what what Don"
"has highlighted very very effectively is"
"that we cannot assume that well that's"
"the you know that's our fishing net and"
"that's all there is to find that's"
"clearly right there they're letting us"
"find certain kinds of things and they're"
"also obscuring lots of other important"
things
"thank you so let me summarize it down so"
"are you saying no physical objects"
"including my body is conscious strictly"
"speaking right so my brain isn't"
"conscious because my brain in fact"
"doesn't even exist and then space time"
"is not fundamental so this standard rule"
"that we all took for granted objective"
"reality we see with our eyes is not"
"surviving bonkers"
"so having this view with the evolution"
"theory has it affected your perceptions"
"and your behavior when it comes to"
"interacting with the world"
"well yes and I think the way you put it"
"is is"
"well put and what Mike has been saying"
"is is I completely agree and it's it's"
"brilliant and and the fishing net"
"example is a really good example that uh"
"you know we don't see the world as it is"
"we see it through the lens of our own"
"Concepts and the way we you know what we"
"do and"
"and there's no escaping that and and so"
"in in effect as well as we talked about"
"you have to recreate yourself all the"
"time right that was Mike Mike was saying"
"you're always recreating yourself all"
"the time"
"um well"
"you're also recreating the world all the"
time
"so so I have a body when I look and I"
"have neurons when I look and when I"
"don't look they're not there so"
"every time I look so so this is really"
quite
"if you're in a virtual reality game your"
"avatar um is there only when you see it"
"and or or and and the Avatar that"
"someone else sees of you is there when"
"they see it and as soon as they turn"
"their headset somewhere else that Avatar"
"is gone and they're looking at something"
"else and and so yeah we're recreating"
"um all the objects inside of space and"
"time on the fly as needed and that"
"includes all of my neurons and my body"
"so these things uh you know it's"
"and we have the illusion that they're"
"there all the time because every time I"
"look I see it but but you can get the"
"same illusion in virtual reality right"
"you know if you're playing a good game"
"you can get immersed in the game every"
"time I look over to the right I see the"
"mountain yep so it must be in the"
"mountains there all the time no no"
"you're only rendering the mountain when"
"you look the fact is you rent you always"
"render the mountain every time you look"
"that direction but that doesn't mean the"
"mountain was there you still have to"
"create it all the time there is"
"something there is a reality but so so"
"we we got confused we go well there must"
"be some reality yeah absolutely there is"
"a reality it's just not inside space and"
"time because it's not inside the virtual"
"reality because there you have to render"
"everything for it to exist in the you"
"know only exist in the rendering process"
"so so yes this this has a personal"
"impact right I mean first it"
"um when I first realized"
"I do just sit down and to to absorb it"
"and that was"
"35 years ago and I'm still absorbing it"
"and and it's a shock to me and I think"
"it's a shock to almost everybody except"
"maybe you know Advanced meditators and"
"so forth who you know maybe for them"
"it's not as much of a shock but it's"
"it's still a shock to the system and I"
think
"um Piaget gave us the the very famous um"
"child psychologist Piaget yeah"
"gave us some insight as to why it's so"
"shocking and he he pointed out that"
um
"we're programmed"
"to believe in what he called object"
permanence
"he thought we got object permanence by"
"um 18 months later studies showed that"
"um it was it's probably more like a"
"three or four months"
"so so this is before we're rational"
"right we're not reasoning and logically"
"thinking about things we're just"
"programmed to believe that that doll"
"exists and will continue to exist even"
"if it's behind a pillow and I can't see"
"it but"
"Jay was doing something he was looking"
"at you know babies with dolls when do"
"they think when are they going to go"
"looking for the doll that they can't see"
"you know when do they believe the doll"
"still exists and and so so we're"
"programmed to so our belief that the sun"
"exists even when we don't look"
"it is not we didn't come to that belief"
"um based on a rational logical cold"
"logic we came to it at three months of"
"age because we're programmed to believe"
that
"and so so that's why"
um
"my merely intellectual understanding"
"that it's false has not yet"
"um penetrated my emotional"
"it's still quite quite a shock"
"emotionally absolutely"
"that has it changed your perceptions of"
"the world"
"yeah um well I guess what I I want to uh"
"say to to two things uh what one about"
"the things that don't change and one"
"about things that do"
"um I once uh I once I once had lunch"
"with with a philosopher who's a a very"
"strong skeptic on Free Will and uh when"
"the waiters came over and said uh so uh"
"Professor X what kind of soup will you"
"have and she said well let me think I"
"said hey what what are you doing why"
"don't you sit back and see what soup"
"gets ordered what what do you do what"
"are you doing choosing a suit here and"
"and so that's just to say that I mean I"
"understand of course the the argument"
"and everything but but the point is it"
"though that's one of those things that"
"you can be you can be a skeptic about"
"free will but I don't think you can live"
"your life I think it's it's one of those"
"views that is is just impossible to"
"connect with on a practical level"
"um first for a strong reason that we can"
"talk about I think I think it actually"
"that and object permanence goes back to"
"the bacterial you know microbial level"
"and so we can we can talk about that but"
"but so I think I think it is impossible"
"for for a coherent mind that that"
"evolved in you know under realistic"
"constraints to not believe in in being"
"an agent that does things I think right"
"I just don't think you can no matter how"
"no matter what you write about if you"
"will I don't think you can live"
"the thing that I think does change some"
"of these things"
"is uh is this and this is just a"
"question I'll post to all of you and and"
"whoever's listening I think it's an"
"interesting question I've done a poll of"
"all my friends with this imagine and I"
"think people split uh into two types of"
"people along this this question"
"uh imagine some pleasant experience that"
"you would be willing to pay a hundred"
dollars
"it's a nice massage or something but"
"whatever whatever it is it's a nice it's"
"a nice discreet experience that you"
"could have and so I'm going to give you"
"two choices you can have that experience"
"right now but you're gonna have no"
"memory of it later none it's wiped it"
"wipes your memory so so let's say you"
"know you've always wanted to go"
skydiving
"it's free but afterwards you will have"
"no memory of having done it okay so"
"that's that's option one option two is"
"the exact opposite we're not going to do"
"it but you're gonna have a memory of"
"having done it"
"but you're not actually going to get to"
"do it now"
"so so which do you prefer and right and"
"because and what and what I find is that"
"people people uh have very strong"
"feelings about this"
"um but about about half of the people I"
"talk and it's really about half and half"
"I think people that I talk to half of"
"them say well uh the the now moment is"
"going to be gone anyway all I really"
"have are memories of anything you know I"
"don't care what happens now look at me"
"give me the memory of this beautiful you"
"know Skydive or whatever and somebody"
"else will say well who wants to go"
"around collecting memories I like"
"experiences I want to I want to have the"
"experience everything else is fake I"
"live in the now let's do it and so and I"
"don't care if I don't remember it"
"afterwards and so and so this this is a"
"really interesting I think division"
"point of how you see yourself do you see"
"yourself as this like uh evanescent"
"agent and then and then you know three"
"hours from now that's not really going"
"to be me anyway so who cares what that"
"I'm have I want the experience now"
"that's all that exists and then you've"
"got the people who are like no no all I"
"am is a is this uh you know collection"
"of memories so let's add to that and"
"there is no now it'll be gone shortly so"
"so I think pondering that one and"
"thinking about which type you are I"
"think I think that's kind of instructive"
"and um and how and how different people"
"can can really differ on that"
yeah
"yeah it's a really interesting uh thing"
"so I my memories my memory is not that"
good
"um I really it just like when when I"
"first read uh when I when I was young I"
"first read about this this idea that"
"your memories could be fossil I had I"
"was like yeah yeah of course I could"
"barely I mean my memory I don't know"
"what you know I don't really trust it"
"that much anyway it seems seemed to make"
"perfect sense and so I'm one of these"
"guys who takes lots of pictures and and"
"you know records everything because uh"
"that's I find it hard to kind of replay"
"it later so and so from from from that"
"perspective uh I can I can sort of see"
"see both views I I think that uh"
"uh my memories aren't worth the raw"
"memories aren't worth all that much so I"
"would I would take the immediate"
"experience but but in real life I I sort"
"of augment that with with all kinds of"
"stuff right so I you know tons of"
"photographs of videos and whatnot so"
"yeah I don't know I think it's a it's a"
"profound set of questions yeah great"
"yeah I have a I have a silly question"
"though so dinosaurs not real"
"both of you so are you saying that"
"dinosaurs is not real then it's just a"
"perceptions of us then with the Via has"
said
"yeah so I'll go after that so it's quite"
"good I mean so you know dinosaurs"
"disappeared I don't know 65 million"
"years ago or something like that right"
"and and and that's that's our space-time"
"story and it's I think it's it's a good"
story
"um but but I would say yes there there"
"is some reality"
"but it's not as is not in space and time"
"and it's if you do you get the right"
"answer if you think about virtual"
"reality most of the time so if you I"
"just always think about virtual reality"
"and so is is that car that you're seeing"
"in virtual reality is it really there we"
"well no it's not it's there when you"
"look is there some reality that is"
"causing you to see the car yeah but it's"
"not a car it's it's maybe some super"
"computer or something outside of your"
"virtual reality so so so yeah we will"
"find dinosaur bones and we will date"
"them with 65 million years and and"
"that's our virtual reality"
"um perception of it there is there is"
"some deeper reality that that uh you"
"know that's real but but this is as Mike"
"is saying we have to recreate this stuff"
"all the time on the fly yeah and and and"
"so so so yeah that dinosaur"
"experience that you're having when you"
"dig up that bone right now"
um
"that experience only exists in the"
moment
"and that bone didn't exist and as a bone"
"until you perceived it"
"um there is some other reality that is"
"somebody else who wants to go and dig in"
"that area to see the bone right so"
"you'll all agree"
"but you also agree in virtual reality"
"say that you know if you're playing"
"Grand Theft Auto the air everybody would"
"go oh yeah you're racing a a green"
"Porsche everybody agrees that you're"
"racing a dream Porsche that doesn't mean"
"that there really is a green Porsche it"
"just means everybody agrees and so we"
"all agree that we see dinosaurs we all"
"agree that in our headset they look like"
"they're 65 million years old or older"
"um but agreement doesn't mean that it"
"has a pre-existing reality so are you"
saying
"he was um no no who's who who's talking"
"right now"
"it's one of the audience"
"um can we move on quickly Don sorry"
"about that"
"to briefly talk about your model and"
"touch on on the conscious agency so that"
"you and Mike could compare the two"
"models so you talk on your conscious"
"agency and the mathematical sites of it"
"and then Mike could unpack it from his"
"perspective on the biology side of it"
"shall we go on that sure sure back to"
"the max Gilbert thing later on in the Q"
"a absolutely so I didn't want to rudely"
"stop anybody I just didn't know who who"
"was talking"
"um so so the the conscious agent model"
"is a precise model of of Consciousness"
"um I'm not saying it's the right model"
"but it's it's at least mathematically"
"precise in which we have agents that"
"have experiences and based on those"
"experiences they take actions that"
"affect the experiences of other"
"conscious agents"
"of interacting conscious agents and the"
"mathematics is basically markovian it's"
"a Markov chain that you get on on on on"
"this collection that this network of"
"conscious agents"
and
"one of the things that we're we're doing"
"right now in the model which is for our"
"next paper which is really fun is"
"looking at the role of observation so"
"the only thing to observe is other"
"consciousnesses right there's the"
"consciousnesses are observing"
"consciousnesses and it's a theorem of"
"this theory that any collection of"
"Consciousness agents is itself a bigger"
agent
"so ultimately the the math says there's"
"one agent but but it also tells us that"
"we can never write down the one agent"
"because you'd have to it would be"
"infinitely long so you you can't write"
"it down so so it's interesting that the"
"theory says there is one conscious agent"
"but it will transcend any precise"
"mathematical description but we can"
"build as big an agent as we want and so"
"that's what we have to do we can get so"
"we have to be modest and build big"
"agents but we can't build the one agent"
"so and when we the only thing there is"
"to observe is consciousness and it's"
"only conscious agents that are there to"
"observe it"
"so what we can do is we can take a huge"
"agent which has a huge number of of"
"experiences a huge number of states that"
"it perceives so maybe you know a billion"
"by it's a billion States so a billion"
"experiences that it can have"
"and we can then take any subset of"
"States plummet maybe just a hundred"
"thousand over or two million"
"and that will also correspond to a"
"sub-agent so this will be a sub-agent of"
"this bigger agent"
"and then we can take the markovian"
"Dynamics of the big agent and do what's"
"called a trace chain we can look at the"
"more coping Dynamics that's induced on"
"the little agent"
"um as a consequence of the big Dynamics"
"so that's called a trace chain so every"
"time most of the time the state of the"
"big agent is is not in the state of one"
"of the states of little agent but when"
"it does then we will you know that"
"little agent will get activated and we"
"can then build its Markov kernel you"
"know we can actually describe over time"
"what is markovian Kernel is so there's"
"some big markovian kernel but we can"
induce
"um little more moving kernels on all the"
"sub-agents so if you have a big agent"
"with n"
"States and experiences that it can"
perceive
"then there are two to the n"
"sub-agents including the original agent"
"two to the end sub-agents so and so you"
"have two to the n"
"different markovian kernels or Trace"
"chains that you can look at and so"
"you're now going to get a very"
"interesting group structure so how do"
"the different agents see the deeper"
"reality so you will I I bet we'll see in"
"some cases we can get a lorentz"
"transformation relating them or"
"euclidean transformation so we will"
"start to see how the different agents"
um
"perspective perceptions differ"
"systematically as you change the agent"
"but the other thing that is interesting"
"is that not only the"
"we might call the spatial window which"
"particular subset of states are using"
"but how many steps of the of the chain"
"do you want to look at do you want to"
"look at only 50 steps or 100 or a"
"billion or a trillion I mean ultimately"
"Markov chains are supposed to go off to"
"Infinity now you know but but but"
"imagining finite temporal windows and it"
"turns out when you do that what what"
"each sub-agent will see depends"
"almost entirely on this temporal window"
"as well as the spatial window so when"
"when you have a very small temporal"
"window you will"
"um and I can go into the mathematics of"
"this but what you will see with small"
"temporal Windows is is what what we"
"believe will turn out to be"
"um bosons in physics these are massless"
"particles so Don and you'll see tons of"
"poses so don't the mathematical sites of"
"it right the the W represents the world"
"and then you've got the perceived the p"
"and then you've got the a the ah"
"you've got the measurable space between"
"the experience the ax and then the"
"action the G so what is that measurable"
"experience that you're measuring though"
"so so what are those measurable spaces"
"um yeah so so those spaces are"
"probability spaces"
"so anytime that you have some kind of"
"probabilistic uh Dynamics you you need"
"to have a a probability space in which"
"the Dynamics can take place and so"
"that's the case with these markovian"
"Dynamics and what's interesting is I"
"didn't think about that for the longest"
"time we you know it was just"
"derragore that if you're going to write"
"down a you know probability uh then you"
"have to write down a probability space"
"and and I didn't even think about what"
"the probabilities so years later but I"
"realized that I was only focused on the"
"experiences but what about the"
"probability of space in which they occur"
"in it seems to me that a natural"
"interpretation of the probability space"
"itself is uh to be interpreted as pure"
"awareness without any particular content"
"something that spiritual Traditions have"
"talked about for a long time so here is"
"the potential"
"I'm sorry"
"is it the verdict you're talking about"
"the the the Indian uh philosophy about"
"the The Observer position that the Atman"
"go backward to uh the Brahman is that"
"the one that you're talking about"
"that that would be um I think that's one"
"example of it I think all the different"
"spiritual Traditions point with their"
"own words to the same kind of thing and"
"what was interesting to me was I mean I"
"wasn't trying to model that I I I just"
"was trying to do the math and I had to"
"write down a probability space and I"
"didn't even think about it and it was"
"only years"
"that probability space and the only"
"interpretation that makes sense is"
"something along the lines of this this"
"unbounded potential for experience"
"namely awareness of pure awareness"
"without any particular content"
"um and and then many spiritual"
"Traditions will then say that is what"
"you are you are not the particular"
"content this particular body or this"
"particular color that you're seeing or"
"this particular headache that you're"
"feeling that's not what you are those"
"are those are just experiences that are"
arising
"in this fundamental awareness and and"
"you are that fundamental awareness not"
"just the things that arise so"
"so don't the end represent our our"
"selfhood The Observer position that's"
"where the End come in and that triangle"
"mathematic graph oh the well in the the"
"so the position the perception decision"
"action Loop and there's also a a an"
"integer n that we have there that was"
"simply just to um a counter for the"
"number of steps uh of the of the"
"markovic so you need a counter in some"
"sense to say what what step of the chain"
"you're in"
"um so that that was just a technical"
"thing is"
"um it's not time it's just the the"
"temporary it's just the sequence counter"
"of the Markov chain"
"thank you Mike yeah um so so I I end up"
"basically at the same point uh as John"
"and let me let me walk it backwards"
"towards the biology of where I think it"
"comes from"
"um if if you didn't already know what it"
"was to communicate with a human and"
"somebody showed you a three pound uh you"
"know three and a half pound brain and"
"they say so how many um how many selves"
"do you think you think are in there well"
"we'd have absolutely no idea because"
"because I priori you don't really know"
"what the dense you know the the agential"
"density of this material is you have no"
"idea and and the thing is that and and"
"then of course in you know you you get"
"to split brain patients in dissociative"
"States so we still actually it's still"
"not super clear you know how to count"
"these things but but"
"um it's interesting that in biology"
"every every cell is some other cell's"
"neighbor in fact every cell every"
"cellular neighbor is some other cell's"
"external environment and so this"
"question of you know what Don was saying"
"of uh different uh different selves uh"
"sort of being uh within a kind of a"
"larger structure this is almost"
"guaranteed because because it there is"
"no obvious and unambiguous way to to say"
"where anyone self ends and any other"
"self begins and biology is always"
"multi-scale and at every everything is"
"made up you know so so like Descartes"
"was looking he liked the pineal gland"
"because there was just one of them but"
"one of what if you look inside it's full"
"of cell the thing's full of cells"
"there's not one of anything and if you"
"look inside the cells guess what you"
"find you find a bunch of molecules I"
"mean there really is no one of anything"
"everything is made of sort of components"
"and and you really start to see this"
"when you look at basic embryogenesis"
"which I think is super important here"
"it's this this journey that each of us"
"took from being a an unfertilized oocyt"
"you know this blob of chemicals into"
"whatever it is that we are now let's"
"just look at the early time points of"
"this right so so so what happens is you"
"have you have this embryonic blastoderm"
"so it's a flat in in in mammals and"
"birds it's like this flat disc and okay"
"50 000 cells or something so you look at"
"this thing and we say oh look there's"
"that's an embryo now what did you just"
"count as and embryo there's one of what"
"well there's 50 000 cells what is there"
"one of well there's one of if you put a"
"particular lens on this thing and you"
"say I'm going to count the"
"system that attempts to that that is"
"going to use energy and attempt to build"
"a particular structure basically what"
"I'm going to count is gold directed"
"systems I'm going to say"
"um how many different goal directed"
"systems are there and what you will find"
"is that all of these cells will work"
"together towards a particular anatomical"
"goal you can the other way to think"
"about if you don't like gold talk is"
"that it's trying to reach a particular"
"region of anatomical morphe space where"
"you've got a couple eyes you've got the"
"right number of toes all that stuff so"
"so a bunch of these cells get together"
"and they're all going to work on this"
"one construction project everybody"
"agrees every step this is what they're"
"this is what they're working on"
"okay so so now you've counted one you"
"say well there you go that's it that's a"
"separate self it's a separate"
"Consciousness it's going to be a human"
"embryo let's say we know what that looks"
"like accept that"
"if you were to come along uh at that"
"early stage and and I've done this in"
"avian with with chicken uh eggs and"
"things like this when I was a grad"
"student you take a little needle and you"
"make a couple of scratches in that"
"blastoderm eventually it's going to heal"
"up but they're going to heal but before"
"they heal what happens is that every"
"group of cells that cannot feel the"
"other cells because you put a scratch"
"between them decides that well it's just"
"me then and so they form an embryo and"
"every island forms an embryo and then"
"when they heal you have conjoined twins"
"and or triplets or whatever so the"
"question of so so you look at an embryo"
"uh and you say well how many are in"
there
"quickly determined it could be anywhere"
"from zero to some small number of them"
"because that question is decided on the"
"fly it is not pre-programmed it is"
"decided on the Fly by the physiology of"
"of a bunch of cells making a decision of"
"how they're going to uh um coalesce"
"towards one uh uh machine that's going"
"to take this morphogenetic journey this"
"this movement through anatomical"
"amorphous space so what then what"
"happens then is that you you you realize"
"that what you've got is you've got this"
"almost like um almost like this Freudian"
"ocean of possibility these 50 000 cells"
"and out of them might come some number"
"of intelligences and once you realize"
"that that's the case and that uh within"
"this one thing there could be three"
"different uh conjoined twins and this of"
"course happens in humans as well as"
"other animals then you realize that fine"
"the adult human body or any animal body"
"also has within it various collection"
"collectives such as organs and various"
"other things that uh for the exact same"
"and so so I I'll say I'll just back up"
"and say that I don't have a theory of"
"Consciousness that I'm sort of"
"propagating right like many other people"
"do I don't have my own maybe I will at"
"some point I don't know so I don't have"
"too much to say about Consciousness"
"except this all as far as I can tell all"
"of the theories of Consciousness that"
"try to explain why brains are so"
"associated with Consciousness in some"
"way for the exact same reason that all"
"of those theories pick the brain to be"
"able to do it pretty much every tissue"
"in your body should be judged as"
"conscious because all of these things"
"that these theories talk about and and"
"you know the let's say the Neuroscience"
"theories you lean on things like well"
"they're these integrated electrical"
"networks and we've got some"
"neurotransmitters and some ion Channel"
"all of this stuff exists all over your"
"body I have yet to come across a a"
"theory of Consciousness that uh it tells"
"you why the brain is different from"
"anything else and and when you sort of"
"start to poke at it you say you know"
"they say well then it's it's the"
"magnetic field of it they say okay how"
"about the magnetic field of the liver"
"why is that different well I guess it"
"probably isn't I mean this right that's"
"where you end up there's just no one has"
"drawn that line for a very good reason"
"because neurons evolved from uh systems"
"that were other cell types that were"
"using these electrical Communications"
"long before brain showed up so for the"
"same reason that you might uh"
"Consciousness it's not going to be"
"verbal Consciousness you're not going to"
"talk to it um uh using uh uh you can use"
"a language and you're probably not aware"
"of it any more than you are aware of"
"your your other non-verbal Hemisphere"
"and the opinions that it has that that"
"you don't even know about because you're"
"not aware of it but but it's entirely"
"plausible given the developmental"
"biology that we are these these nested"
"hierarchies of diverse conscious agents"
"that are all having experiences and"
"solving problems in different spaces all"
"kinds of weird spaces so so"
"transcriptionals or gene expression"
spaces
"um metabolic spaces physiological spaces"
"anatomical spaces we love the"
"three-dimensional you know sort of space"
"of the where it's easy for us to"
"recognize intelligence but but that's"
"just that's just our own our own"
limitation
"um if you had a you know just imagine"
"imagine that that you had a a primary"
"sense of your own blood chemistry"
"instead of you know in addition to your"
"to your retinol it looks outwards for"
"medium-sized objects moving at medium"
"speeds you would also have an internal"
"sensor of your blood chemistry and you"
"could feel it you would have no problem"
"recognizing your liver as extremely"
"intelligent because it would be solving"
"all these problems on a daily basis and"
"you would know you would feel it I mean"
"at the same way that we see oh look that"
"Crow and that uh you know octopus look"
"at the amazing things they're doing you"
"would see your liver doing that stuff"
"every day if you had if you had the"
"perception of this other space and so"
"and and we can build things right so so"
"at some point we'll talk about synthetic"
"beings and and we can build things that"
"will have Consciousness in those spaces"
"but so so I end up exactly where where"
"Don ends up I think that we we are"
"um these nested hierarchies of uh of"
"Consciousness is only some of them are"
"verbal uh only some of them do we have"
"any direct connection to but they're all"
"over the place and we're bad at"
"recognizing them and and and that's why"
"we need to you know we need to think"
"about these things more"
gone
"brilliant uh that's that's brilliant"
"Mike and I I agree I'll I'm definitely"
"not the biologist that Mike as well just"
"throw in another simple biology example"
"to support what he's saying and that is"
"with split brain patients right we"
"um so so people who um have intractable"
"epilepsy uh that can't be treated with"
"normal drugs were"
"in extreme cases where they were their"
"lives were on the line"
um
"submit it to a surgery called the Carlos"
"sodomy surgery where they would Joe"
"Bogan who was a friend of mine would"
"actually take a scalpel and go in there"
"and cut the Corpus close them which was"
"a band of about 220 million fibers to"
"connect the right and left hemispheres"
"of the brain and um it was a success if"
"if the epileptic Focus was on the right"
"hemisphere you would spare the left"
"hemisphere from getting bothered by an"
"epileptic seizure and so it was a"
"clinical success but but then some other"
"friends of mine and other researchers um"
"started to study you know what's"
"different about these people that have"
"their their brains cut in half and the"
"micasanica and many others but you know"
"did this a friend of mine ramacondra vs"
"ramachandran at uh at UC San Diego"
"friends call them Rama so I'll just what"
"Rama did was he found some one patient"
"in which the right hemisphere I believe"
"um was an atheist in the left hemisphere"
"believed in God"
"right so so here and another case was"
"found in which the right hemisphere"
"wanted to be a race car driver in the"
"left hemisphere wanted to have a desk"
job
"so so you have uh you know those are as"
"different a personality as you could as"
"you could possibly want"
"stuck inside one Cranium and and so that"
"raises the question here I am with my"
"corpus callosum intact and why is it"
"that on Friday night"
"the battle going on about what I want"
"you know maybe one part of me says let's"
"go out and have fun the other part says"
"no I've got a book I want to read well"
"well maybe there are two people in there"
"and they really want to do two different"
"things on Friday night and uh I do have"
"to negotiate among them and so who who"
"is the I now that is doing the"
"negotiation among those two people so"
"the whole notion of a self then becomes"
"really interesting and very problematic"
"and so I agree completely with Mike uh"
"on that one and again"
"a big issue here is we're only seeing"
"things through a space-time interface"
"right and so"
"um it's not like for example the"
"distinction we make between living and"
"non-living or conscious and unconscious"
"is a principal distinction"
"right so so for just to get it when I'm"
"talking about here I'm looking at it at"
"all of you on a zoom screen"
"so I'm looking at Mike right now on the"
"zoom screen and some of the pixels are"
"pixels for Mike's face and when I look"
"at those pixels I'm getting a a portal"
"into Mike's Consciousness I can tell if"
"he's interested I can tell if he's bored"
"I can tell like I can I get some insight"
"into his Consciousness but there are"
"other pixels of a floor for example in"
"the back of this chair and those pixels"
"are not giving me any insight about"
"Consciousness now should I say that some"
"pixels are conscious"
"and other pixels on my zoom screen are"
"not conscious well that's stupid pixels"
"are pixels they're not conscious or"
"unconscious some of them are giving me a"
"portal into Mike's Consciousness and"
"others are not so this it's not so the"
"same thing is true of space and time and"
"what we call physical objects there's"
"the distinction we make between oh"
"that's alive and that's dead or that's"
"conscious and that's not conscious is"
"the same mistake as saying oh those are"
"those are conscious pixels and those are"
"unconscious pixels on my zoom screen"
"it's exactly the same mistake an"
"interface is just an interface it's not"
"the truth so so it's not a principle"
"distinction between living and"
"non-living it's an artifact of the"
"limitations of our interface that we're"
"mistaking for an insight into the nature"
"of reality it's a rookie mistake so we"
"have to get past the rookie mistake of"
"saying that distinctions that we see in"
"our interface are therefore necessarily"
"true in reality"
"I don't know if it's funny but but a"
"story of a kind of a troubling uh story"
"that that goes with with Dawn's point"
"about having two different opinions uh"
"in in your in your brain and uh so so I"
"read this uh this was a um a description"
"of a uh a therapist a psychiatrist to"
"have this experience so so this guy this"
"patient comes in and he says I've got"
"some sort of uh dissociative disorder"
"where I've got there's a personality in"
"there that uh he's a real partier and"
"and I like to work and and he destroy"
"you know I can't I can't work anymore"
"because sometimes he comes out and"
"screws up you know he acts the you know"
"acts like a fool at work and whatever we"
"need to take care of this and so you"
"know they start doing some sort of I"
"don't even know how they do it but some"
"sort of Integrative therapy and they're"
"gonna so so he one day one day the"
"patient walks in and it's the other guy"
"and he says hey what's this I hear about"
"integrating integrate what what are you"
"guys doing and the dog and the doctor"
"says well you know we're gonna"
"um integrate you and he says excuse me"
"you're gonna integrate me and who who's"
"going to be left he says well you know"
"you'll be well you'll do well at work"
"and when I was wait a minute wait a"
"minute where am I going to be and he's"
"and the dog's like well you're kind of"
"going to be gone I hope if you know if"
"we do it are you kidding what what"
"happened to the hippocraticals what do"
"you think I'm going to be gone I don't"
"want to be gone you're like I should be"
"gone you know he's a boring you know"
"he's boring I I've got the fun life to"
"make him gone"
"for so and right so so just put yourself"
"in that in that place right I mean"
"presumably the other you know the other"
"personality signs the checks and"
"everything but but but but you're faced"
"with a coherent this isn't some weird"
"tick or reflex this is a coherent being"
"that is making an argument that knows"
"what what a Hippocratic Oath isn't is"
"making an argument that whatever that"
"whatever you're doing is gonna erase"
"them from the World by sort of somehow"
"jamming you down into this into this"
"integrated personality that can spend"
"you know 12 hours at work and and not"
"have any fun so that's I mean that's a"
"super you know it's a it's a super"
"disturbing sort of kind of you know way"
"way to think about this because yeah we"
"there are no as far as I know there are"
"no indivisible beings We Are All Made of"
"parts that that's just how it has to be"
"and therefore there is the possibility"
"of that that magical which I think if"
"anything is magical this is it it's this"
this
"um uh process by which by which uh"
"merge into a larger scale Collective you"
"know self or individual that that"
"process is going to have failure modes"
"some of them temporary some of them"
"permanent and and it's these failure"
"modes that really give us something to"
"think about in terms of what are we and"
"who are we and and how we relate to each"
other
"fabulous fabulous yeah we recently have"
"McGill Chris yeah McGill Chris came to"
"our club um last Monday yeah he has book"
"um the matter with things yeah he talked"
"about the the laugh and right hemisphere"
"hypothesis a lot in his book on his the"
"volume one yeah we're gonna quickly move"
"on before because Mike got to go"
"um pretty soon probably about 30 minutes"
"time but but Don you can stay with us"
"for another hours right so that I'm"
"going to go straight to the the last"
"question so these conscious agents the"
"common factor Don so all these"
"multiplicity and diversity or pointers"
"agents so how many of them so they're"
"all going to what one field of"
"Consciousness is that what it is"
"and then you speak on that right so so"
"there's um"
"it's quite interesting suppose I start"
"off with a countable Infinity of"
"conscious agents so there's agent one"
"two three four all the way up to"
"accountable Infinity"
"then any combination of any subset of"
"them so agent one and two agent one two"
"and three whatever that that also is a"
"conscious agent it's a theorem of the"
"math that any collection of conscious"
"agents is also a conscious agent so that"
"means that I started off with"
"accountable Infinity of conscious agents"
"I I can take the power set with what the"
"mathematician mathematicians call the"
"power set that's the number of new"
"conscious agents that come from"
"combination well that's a higher level"
"of infinity"
"that's um you know alf1"
"and now with that new set of Agents I"
"can take their power set"
"yeah as well now I'm at alif too"
"consciously so now I'm marching my way"
"up cantor's hierarchy of Infinities and"
"there's no end to that hierarchy of"
"Infinities so so it's a it's a theorem"
"that there is just one and it's also a"
"fact that I'll never be able to get"
"there which is I guess again again also"
"in line with the spiritual Traditions"
"right that that they they say that"
"anything that we can say about it like"
"the Buddhists will say a finger pointing"
"to the Moon"
"um is not the moon it's just a finger"
"pointing and so that will be true of our"
"scientific descriptions as well we we"
"have to recognize that"
"the scientific distractions are"
scientific
"um theories are merely"
"um pointers and they're not the reality"
"and in this case what's what's nice"
"about the scientific pointers"
"is that they tell you that they're not"
"the reality they tell you that they are"
"limited and that's what's beautiful"
"about the scientific pointers like the"
"Einstein series space-time and with"
"Quantum field Theory tells us that that"
"pointer that space-time idea"
"um fails at 10 to the minus 33"
"centimeters that's where the pointer"
"stops and the moon begins right with"
"whatever is beyond begins and so so the"
"conscensation theory has the same nice"
"property it says basically there is one"
"conscious agent and I can't describe it"
"I can I can go to alef0 I can go maybe"
"to go to alif one uh of course even then"
"I'll fail because I don't have a super"
"computer that can do it so and I don't"
"have enough paper to do it so already"
"you can see that that um is telling you"
"this is a pointer and the reality is"
"going to transcend the pointer"
"completely absolutely"
"Mike did you agree in that mate"
"um yeah I'll point it to one or you're"
"still keen on your pet psychism"
"I I think I think both I think they're"
"not uh uh mutually exclusive I think"
that
"there are I mean to to me"
"recognizing agency and Consciousness in"
"the world around you is a lens that you"
"bring to the process like any other and"
"so if you if you have a way of"
"recognizing uh intelligence in"
"components of something that's great and"
"then you may have uh you may also"
"observe that the whole thing is so so so"
"just to give an example we recently um"
"uh there's this there's this"
"mathematical notion of a gene regulatory"
"Network it's very simple it's a"
"collection of nodes let's say a dozen of"
"these nodes and you're just going to"
"write down how each one uh up or down"
"regulates some other so it's this like"
"little Network and you can you know"
"people have been to like stuke Kaufman"
"has been studying this for a long time"
"and you can run you can view them as as"
"um uh uh dynamical systems and and see"
"what they do and so on so you look at"
"this thing and you say well okay it's"
"very simple I can see all the parts"
"there's nowhere to hide here this is"
"like the rock bottom of deterministic uh"
"you know zero agency mechanical system"
"there's just nothing there so we took"
"the hypothesis so my view always is that"
"you can't just make these pronouncements"
"from a from an armchair you have to do"
"experiments so we said okay what if we"
"just what if what if we test the"
"hypothesis that this thing has some"
"degree of of of of cognitive cognitive"
"ability so what we what we ended up"
"doing was testing their learning"
"capacity in the following in the"
"following way we we assign some one of"
"the nodes as a conditioned stimulus"
"another note is an unconditioned"
"stimulus and pick some other note as the"
"re as the response and then we do things"
"like pavlovian conditioning we you know"
"we twiddle two of them simultaneously"
"and we look at what happens anyway you"
"get the idea so so we now have a couple"
"of papers on this that biological"
"networks and not so much random networks"
"so I think Evolution likes this because"
"so biological networks do this more than"
"random ones do biological networks show"
"six different kinds of learning"
"including associative conditioning in"
"this in this dirt simple system and"
"that's with no with no changing of the"
"network structure so we're not changing"
"the synaptic weights we're not"
"rearranging the network none of that"
"this is purely purely dynamical system"
"stuff but but but there is a lens so"
"there are two diff two competing lenses"
"on the same phenomenon one is the"
"standard molecular biology lens this"
"thing is dumb as a rock and what you if"
"you're going to change the way it works"
"let's say for biomedical purposes your"
"only hope is bottom-up rewiring you need"
"to add nodes subtract nodes you know"
"genomic editing to change the the way"
"that these nodes interact with each"
"other that's your only hope there's"
"another lens which makes a completely"
"different uh a prediction and if you"
"which is that which is that actually if"
"you treat if you don't rewire anything"
"but you treat this thing as a minimally"
"cognitive agent that that can be"
"manipulated by experiences by stimuli by"
"training then you can do some more stuff"
"and then you can look at these two"
"lessons say gee this one tells us a lot"
"that we can use in biomedicine that"
"we're actually not getting out of here"
"right so so you can have multiple"
"perspectives they have different powers"
"in terms of what they let you do in the"
"real world maybe someday somebody else"
"will come along and say yeah you're both"
"wrong here's a much better lens you know"
"fine that's how it goes so so then so"
"then that that allows you to have it all"
"all you can you look at a human body and"
"you say I'm looking really deep and I"
"see some components that clearly have"
"their own thing going on but of course"
"so does the organ that they sit in and"
"because because that has certain certain"
"interesting capabilities in"
"physiological space and then the whole"
"thing that we're going to call a human"
"well that's a bigger intelligence that"
"can do other things in behavioral space"
"Maybe linguistic space so I I see it"
"both ways I think I think the merging is"
"is is correct I think Don's totally"
"right about all of that but I also think"
"that there are useful lenses that allow"
"you to exploit a pan psychist View and"
"just to be clear you know the the"
"there's a couple of different versions"
"of pancakeism the one where the one"
"where you take a perfectly good physics"
"and then paint some hopes and dreams on"
"all the electrons that's not that's not"
"the one right so people correctly make"
"fun of that one because that's just not"
"gonna give you anything there's a"
"different however research program which"
"which Dawn and people like Chris fields"
"and Carl Frost and other people are"
"doing which is is to reformulate physics"
"from the the cognitive perspective so"
"it's not that we have a perfectly good"
"physics and now we're going to paint"
"some extra junk on it no it's that"
"actually what we have been taking as"
"physics is a"
"um I don't know what the right uh word"
"for but but it's a it's a it's an"
"oversimplification and a not a really"
"good not not the best lens I mean it's"
"done well in many areas but it's not the"
"best lens and you can formulate a"
"different lens where things like active"
"inference and and some of these other"
"extremely General things and I don't"
"pretend to be any kind of expert on on"
"active inference but but but what I"
"understand the research program it helps"
"you understand inanimate things and"
"interactions between living things and"
"non-living things from the same with the"
"same lens and I think that's super"
"powerful and and so I think you can have"
"a useful version of hand psychism where"
"you scale down your cognitive"
"expectations it's not that the rocks"
"have hopes and dreams like humans that's"
"not the point the point is that you can"
"use the same tools including um you know"
"active in for instance and and"
"trainability and some other things to"
"understand both physical processes and"
"then eventually"
"um uh you know Advanced cognitive"
"properties maybe social phenomena who"
knows
"um yeah anyway so that's a long answer"
"to to your question"
"thank you so how many conversations then"
"to make a photon down that's a question"
"from the audience"
"ah so"
"that's what we're going to be working on"
"on our very next paper we're calling it"
"tangibly titled traces of Consciousness"
"on paper and and the idea is that I was"
"talking about these Trace chains right"
"you have a big dynamical system of"
"conscious agent a big agent but I can"
"look at the two to the n sub-agents and"
"and do a trace chain in each one of"
"those and I can change the temporal"
"window and"
"so I I should say just a little bit of"
"background about what what motivates"
"what I'm about to tell you so"
"so in the paper that we just published"
"last week we proved that the Markov"
"chains map on to decorative permutations"
"like I mentioned that earlier"
"permutations and the decorated"
"permutations the physicists have shown"
"are the deepest structure they found"
"behind space time and with decorated"
"permutations you can then"
"um create things like the amplitohedron"
"and compute scattering amplitudes like"
"two gluons now smashing into each other"
"and four gluons go spraying out so you"
"actually you can compute all of the"
"scattering amplitudes"
"truly if you just have these decorated"
"permutations and maybe momentum spin"
"data as well"
and
"so when we made this mapping from our"
"Markov Dynamics onto decorated"
"permutations and decorated permutations"
"into space-time that gave us the clue"
"there's a particular aspect of our"
"dynamics of conscious agents that's"
critical
"for the physics and the mapping into"
"physics and it's called the"
"communicating classes so that's that's"
"the key thing these are their so-called"
"so if you look at Markov chains on"
"online you can see what the"
"communicating classes are it's a"
"standard part of Markov chains"
"so our"
"our hypothesis the one that I'm working"
"on right now is that the so-called"
"entropy rate"
"this is a technical term in Markov chain"
"so if you you can look it up online as"
"well entropy rate of a communicating"
class
"is what corresponds to Mass"
"in space-time"
"okay so particles in space time are"
"projections of communicating classes but"
"most communicating classes project to"
"things far more interesting than"
"particles but particles are projections"
"of communicating classes and for those"
"communicating classes that project"
"particles it's the entropy rate"
"that is their Mass"
"so when you look at what I technically"
"what I just said it means that if the"
"markovian Dynamics if the Markov kernel"
"has only zeros and ones in in The Matrix"
"then it will project to a massless"
"particle like a photon so now I'm"
"getting into your question about photons"
"you can see why I had to spend some time"
right
"the the zero entropy rate communicating"
"classes project to massless particles"
"or I should say Mass lift particle the"
"better way to say this massless"
"particles are the projection of zero"
"communicating uh Zero Entry rate"
"communicating classes because"
"communicating classes don't necessarily"
"project the particles they can project"
"to more interesting things than"
"particles particles are the simplest so"
"so that means so so now we want to find"
"out exactly what specific"
"um there are lots of different kinds of"
"markovian kernels that are that have"
"zero entropy rate"
"um some of them for example are um"
"derangements so their their permutation"
"is called derangements and there are"
"other kinds they'll have combinations of"
"derangements as well as absorbing"
"States so we want to look at those and"
"and then figure out okay which"
"correspond to like photons but photons"
"are not the only kind of bosons there is"
"also gluons there are W particles and Z"
"particles and then there's the Higgs so"
"there's a a number of massless particles"
"and so so we'll we'll want to get this"
dictionary
"um for between the particular kinds of"
"um permutation matrices that and and"
"which ones mapped to which which"
"massless particles so so that that you"
"can see that there's a lot of fun work"
"ahead um but it's a deep technical"
question
"looking forward to it Don so we're going"
"to open up the floor for Q a we have"
"on the stage waiting to ask both of you"
"some questions so we're going to open it"
"up now we have prakash"
"yes greetings"
um
"fantastic talk to a conversation I was"
"just curious"
"um you know look at looking at living"
"systems I always wonder where would you"
"put plants in this picture you know"
"plans are living agents"
"they don't seem to have neurons but they"
"have the same cellular space I was just"
"wondering what you would have to share"
"about what you think about plants"
"um yeah"
"okay is it to to both"
"mic makes sense yeah we can yeah"
"thank you"
"thank you"
"Yes mine would you want to go first Mike"
"sure sure um well I can the two things"
"one is uh so so there certainly are"
"people who study this question of plant"
"intelligence uh there have been some"
"some nice papers on that um people like"
"uh Francisco and and some other folks um"
"uh really really talk about uh plant uh"
"plant cognition and plant intelligence"
"um from my perspective"
"plants are not nearly weird enough as a"
"challenging example for all of this kind"
"of stuff I mean I"
"and other people of course spent time"
"thinking about really minimal models"
"compared to which plants are a"
"no-brainer to Pardon upon for uh for for"
"having uh for having cognitive um"
"capacities including and anticipation"
"and memory and learning and and you know"
"creative problem solving and various"
"things plants do all of that uh so so"
"yeah I have I have zero the fact that"
"they don't have neurons means almost"
"nothing to me I think I think"
"um yes as we think about the wide"
"universe I find it impossible to believe"
"that the only things that have uh"
"cognition are things with actual neurons"
"like we have I mean that seems like just"
"an incredibly implausible view to me uh"
"and uh we came from uh you know a lot of"
"electrophysiology was done in bacteria"
"anyway I mean neurons you know they do"
"some interesting things but but this is"
"this is way wider than that so so yeah"
"no problem with with plants"
"I agree with Mike and I I think you said"
"it well so yeah absolutely"
"thank you and we're going to move on to"
Andy
"hey thank you both for being here this"
"is fascinating thank you Ivy and John"
"for making this happen"
um
"it's hard to decide what to drill into I"
"I would like to drill into this idea of"
"um the uh the simulations so this is for"
"for Don"
"um the simulations that that you claim"
"prove that perception of Truth leads to"
Extinction
"um so I want to drill this idea of Truth"
"a little bit like"
"what do you mean by Truth Versus Fitness"
"it seems like Fitness is a sort of Truth"
"um for a biological system and can you"
"give an example of the perception like"
"like a true perception of a thing"
"leading to less Fitness than a false"
"perception and or a false perception of"
"a thing leading to more Fitness than a"
"true perception of a thing"
"um and you know and finally uh isn't"
"results say more about the simulation"
"and how it's built and the built-in"
"approximations and assumptions and"
biases
"um that are built into it then then it"
"then it's then then it says about"
"reality thank you that's a great"
"question so so I'll first just give you"
"you asked for a an intuitive example"
"that we might help understand why not"
"knowing the truth could help you out"
"I'll just give an intuitive example in"
"virtual reality say again Grand Theft"
"Auto you're you're trying to race"
"against a bunch of friends you know"
"you've got your car and you're racing a"
portion
"and the Maserati and so forth and what"
"are you really doing in reality in in"
"this metaphor what you're really doing"
"to win the game is you're toggling"
"millions of voltages per second in a"
"precise order that's what you're doing"
"to try to win the game"
"and that's that in this metaphor that's"
"the reality what you're doing what what"
"you know about what you're doing is"
"you're turning the steering wheel and"
"you're pushing on a gas pedal a lot a"
"lot simpler than toggling a million"
"voltages per second in a precise order"
"so now if you said well I want to know"
"the truth I'm going to try to play the"
"game knowing the truth I'm going to"
"actually toggle the million voltages per"
second
"um to try to win so that I can guarantee"
"you the person who's trying to toggle"
"those voltages as fast they can would"
"lose against someone who is just turning"
"a steering wheel and pushing on the gas"
"and that's that's the top level"
"intuition why Evolution hid the truth"
"from our eyes is because uh if you had"
"to actually toggle all of reality uh you"
"would die in the process better to give"
"you just a user interface that hides"
"most of that from you so that's the"
"intuition but but the now for the math"
"we we did simulations to begin with just"
"to check to see what would happen and"
"and once we found that the organisms"
"that saw reality were were going extinct"
"we then let go of the simulations we"
"went to the math so I went to a"
"mathematician so we now have theorem so"
"it's not we're not relying on"
"simulations at all we have theorems and"
"the theorems are using the tools of"
"evolutionary Game Theory"
"and in evolutionary Game Theory the key"
"technical notion are Fitness payoff"
functions
"the domain of their function includes"
"whatever objective reality might be"
"evolutionary game through it doesn't"
"tell you what objective reality is it"
"just says there is some objective"
reality
"um include you could include organisms"
"their states their actions and and so"
"forth um"
"and then so there's this Fitness payoff"
"that includes whatever objective reality"
"is in the domain of the function and the"
"range of the function are the possible"
"payoff values say from zero to a hundred"
"zero means very very bad 100 means"
"wonderful wonderful payoff save"
"and you can ask a clean technical"
question
"what is the probability"
"that a generically chosen payoff"
function
"will be a homomorphism"
"of some structure in the objective"
"reality like a total order an objective"
"reality or or you know unmeasurable"
"structure or a topology or whatever it"
"might be what in other words what is the"
"probability that a fitness payoff"
"function will actually have information"
"about structures in objective reality"
"right because if it doesn't have"
"information about the structures"
"how can it tune you to the structures in"
"objective reality so so we asked the"
"technical question do"
"Fitness payout functions generically"
"contain information about structures and"
"objective reality"
"and we if you want to see the math"
"um you can Google our papers called fact"
"fiction and fitness so that's the paper"
"where we go through the math and what"
"the chaitan is the mathematician not Don"
"Hoffman caitan is the mathematician but"
"of course we collaborate on it and what"
"what we proved is that for several"
"different structures but you when you"
"see the trend you realize is true"
"basically for all structures the"
"probability is zero"
"precisely zero that a generically chosen"
"payoff function will have any"
"information about objective reality"
"about any structure and objective"
reality
"so there's there's nothing in the"
"fitness payoff functions to tune you to"
"objective reality now I'll I'll just"
"mention a couple quick objections that"
"people say"
"one objection that um"
"um made yeah"
"some takes recently um is look"
"um you're using evolutionary Game Theory"
"so either you believe that Evolution the"
"math of evolutionary Game Theory"
um
models
"biological evolution correctly or you"
"don't believe it does"
"and if you do believe in models"
"biological evolution correctly well"
"biological evolution assumes that there"
"are physical objects like organisms and"
"space and time and resources so"
"and if you don't believe that so so if"
"you're going to use evolutionary Game"
"Theory to say that there are no such"
"thing as physical objects in space-time"
"is fundamental reality then that would"
"be contradicted you'd be contradicting"
"yourself because the math you're"
"claiming the math Faithfully model is"
"the physical"
"biology and if you don't think the math"
"of evolutionary Game Theory models the"
"physical biology then you shouldn't use"
"it anyway because you didn't think it"
"models so so either way you're stuck in"
"a logical contradiction that what that's"
"sort of his argument"
"and what that argument misses is how"
"science works"
"so so take"
"um Einstein's theory of space-time"
"Quantum and Quantum filter so these"
"these theories assume their mathematical"
"theories are built on the assumption"
"that space-time is fundamental right so"
"Einstein's special relativity and"
"Quantum field Theory those mathematical"
"those assume that space-time is"
"fundamental so you could use the same"
"argument so but but notice what the"
"physicists do is they say our theories"
"tell us that space time is doomed"
"space-time is not fundamental okay well"
"okay so I'll use the same uh got you"
"logical argument well so either"
"Einstein's math modeled his intuitions"
"in which case it could not possibly show"
"that space-time is doomed or it didn't"
"model his intuition so which case you"
"couldn't use it you shouldn't use it to"
"show that space time is doomed well no"
"physicist would take that seriously"
"that's a that's a silly argument"
"here's what really goes on in science"
"every scientific theory makes"
"assumptions and there is no Theory of"
Everything
"there is no such thing as a scientific"
"theory of everything so a good"
"scientific theory starts with uh"
"assumptions and basic concepts but a"
"good scientific theory will tell you the"
"limits of those Concepts"
"Einstein's theory with Quantum filtering"
"tells us the limits of his basic"
"concepts namely 10 to the minus 33"
"centimeters and 10 to the minus 43"
"seconds you fall apart so what we're"
"doing is exactly the same thing but with"
"evolutionary theory the assumptions"
"about sure Darwin thought about physical"
"objects in space and time absolutely"
"what are the limits of those Concepts"
"well evolutionary game theory is the"
"mathematics and that mathematics is"
"precise enough to tell us the limits of"
"the basic concepts just like Einstein's"
"theory of relativity is is good enough"
"to tell us the the limitations of"
"Einstein's Notions of space and time or"
"space time so this is the way science"
"works it's not a self-refutation"
"to think that is actually to"
"misunderstand fundamentally the nature"
"of scientific progress"
"now what you can't do is to use the old"
"Theory to tell you what's next right so"
"Einstein's theory tells us space time is"
"doomed but it can't tell you"
"where is The Next Step Beyond Space time"
"you can't do that and similarly the"
"theory of evolution by natural selection"
"with the mathematics of evolutionary"
"Game Theory tells you aha the Notions of"
"organisms in space and time is not"
fundamental
"but does it tell you okay what is more"
"fundamental no it doesn't tell you"
"what's more fundamental so that's where"
"then scientists have to make a creative"
"leap and that when physicists have done"
"this just in the last 10 years they just"
"they went outside space time they found"
"the amplitudehedron they found decorated"
"permutations they that's a creative leap"
"but then what you do is you show how"
"they project back into space-time right"
"you have to go back and get your your"
"previous theories as a special case of"
"the more General framework and so we"
"have to do the same thing our theory of"
"conscious agents is a leap Beyond"
"evolutionary theory"
"but we have to show how it projects back"
"into space and time and gives us back"
"evolutionary theory as a special case so"
so
"so I'm answering your question but I"
"also want to answer another question"
"that has just been published in cintase"
"you know the philosophy Journal recently"
"in this and I just want to point out"
"that that argument it just Falls"
"flat very easily"
stop
"thank you can we move on uh we have"
"um did you want to ask questions"
"yeah yes um"
"uh hi Donald we've corresponded before I"
"think I'm probably your your biggest uh"
"fans on clubhouse here I was wondering"
"if you had had"
"um any uh correspondence with Nema"
"arkani Hamad because I know that um"
"you're following what they're doing in"
"high energy physics really closely and a"
"lot of people have been you know begging"
"Nema to you know uh write a book that's"
"you know more understandable for the"
"general public because I'm fascinated"
"with the uh you know decorated"
"permutations and the amplitude hedron"
"but it's so far over my head uh could"
"you provide any resources on how to"
"really get a grasp on on what that means"
"right so I would love to talk with Neil"
"I I haven't yet and um I'm hoping to"
"actually get to a place where um I'll be"
"worth this time so I'm I'm trying to you"
"know the work I'm doing on these Trace"
"chains and so forth the decorate"
"permutations stuff in the Markov chains"
"onto it I think already might be of"
"interest to him but I want to push this"
"a little bit further he's this time is"
"very valuable when I talk to him I'd"
"like if I get the chance to talk to him"
"I'd like to really have something"
"that'll be of interest to him but if you"
"want to see"
"um more details a little bit more"
"accessible about the amplitudehedron and"
"the decorated permutations"
"course at Harvard that he gave in the"
"fall of 2019 so if you Google uh Nema"
"arkani Hamed Harvard lecture one"
"you will find on YouTube they they"
"posted all 20 something 25 20 whatever"
"it is lectures so uh Neymar Cunningham"
"Harvard lecture one you'll see that he"
"has an introductory lecture and he"
"really lays it out in the introductory"
"lecture he tries to be fairly"
non-technical
"um it's for graduate class at Harvard so"
"you know non-technical for them might be"
"technical for for the rest of us but"
"it's it's fairly accessible and that's"
"probably I would say his class and all"
"the lectures are online that's maybe the"
"most accessible Source you're going to"
"find right now is his Harvard lectures"
"um and I've I've studied I just I've"
"been studying these lectures I've"
"actually transcribed"
"um 15 of them all these first 15"
"lectures I've transcribed myself"
personally
"equation by equation figure by figure I"
"did that until covet stopped me I I"
"covered took me out uh you know so but I"
"plan to get back to it now I'm starting"
"to recover from covet and"
"um go back to it but so but yeah I'm"
"really trying to study Nema stuff and"
"um you know I'm not a physicist I work"
"with physicists and at some point we"
"would love to talk with them"
foreign
"wonderful thank you Ivy and thank you to"
"have this great minds in the same room"
"and watching your conversions at some"
"point and I have two questions for each"
"of you one question and it's definitely"
"fascinating what you are doing uh Donald"
"and I say the first thing the great"
"jumps in signs are often company of a"
"big flock of people who don't understand"
"what the New Perspective is so I'm also"
"confused sometimes by the combination of"
"metaphors and mathematical apparatus and"
"all this and it's in the making"
"definitely and I will taking for granted"
"that you imply kind of anti-realism with"
"your stance"
"um and I don't want to discuss it"
"what I want to see if I get it right is"
"that you are letting go a reality and"
"space time in a way yeah and starting"
"with the fundamental of the conscious a"
"and we had a reading room here and with"
"these wonderful people uh from the 2014"
"articular audition of time in conscious"
"agents and we found that it's a bit hard"
"to define or to go with you what you"
"mean and um it reminded me of the vloggy"
"stone story which is famous from Thomas"
"schoon about the structure of Revolution"
"and occupies and so on and we found out"
"that we don't need floggy Stone to"
"understand that"
"um heat is Flowing from a hot point to a"
"code point and so we let go flog a stone"
"and I wonder how it can be in the same"
"way let go reality and space time uh"
"does it really make sense what are the"
"practical and theoretical consequences"
"in science and in life and closing here"
"for you question"
"and the old leibniz introduce monets in"
"the same way as atomism chess cannot"
"deliver the mantle yeah this was his"
"basic intuition it cannot deliver"
"emergence degrees a theories of"
"emergence or a combination or"
"composition just a desk with surface to"
"make us understand how this should ever"
"work so understand to go back to the"
"Primacy of the Mind definitely yeah but"
"what are the predictions is it"
"detectable are you working on a kind of"
"uh operationable and kind of a detector"
"so to speak that you can say now we can"
"hear really see that he is a conscious"
"agent uh sorry it's in space-time"
"somehow but we can detect it and then we"
"can count it's just as an example and"
"then we can even see how they emerge"
"together or cooperate together and let"
"time emerge something like this would be"
"very ambitious of course"
"and I should I go to Michael or should I"
"just wait for you because yeah we'll"
"really go to Michael first because"
"Michael got to live in about yeah"
"yeah to succinctly ask your questions"
"so for me also you uh contrary to what"
"the card was doing the cards tortured"
"cats saying this are not uh essentient"
"beings they are just machines don't"
"don't worry and now we have inflation of"
"Consciousness and inflation of conscious"
"ancients contrary for instance to even"
"Thompson who is preferring biopsychicism"
"psychism to plant psychism only"
"biological stuff like maybe even plants"
"might have Consciousness and another"
"question is"
"um because you are also coming from a"
"theories of process structure like"
"autoproiesis in a way but I guess you're"
"going in a different direction you're"
"going into this bioelectricity pattern"
"here's my question are you looking for a"
"substrate where the self then is"
emergent
"because you're using the term immersion"
"and have a different as a you have a"
"different ontology at the contrary to to"
"Don because you are starting uh quite"
"with common sense that you're observing"
"nature like Aristotle Newton Galilee and"
"so on and then from this on you you are"
"constructing theories and um yeah you"
"say I start with reality in a way or do"
"I get you wrong and the last thing and"
"this is again to both of you are you"
"actually waiting for a new physics which"
"might be even"
"produced by Donald yeah this is very"
"exciting because maybe uh this this"
"comes together so thank you for both of"
"you for your answer"
"um yeah thank you so much I'm not sure"
"um I I will be able to hit all of that"
"but uh but I'll try I'll try to get to"
"some of it"
"um the first thing I should say is that"
"I'm I'm in an enjoyable position here"
"where uh I'm of on this on this panel uh"
"I am not I'm not the most uh sort of uh"
"uh avant-garde person here with so so so"
"Don has gone sort of further my stuff is"
"a little more um a little more mundane I"
"don't I have not really said anything"
"about Consciousness"
"um I don't know anything about any new"
"physics I I'm you know that's I haven't"
"I haven't really gone there although I'm"
"I'm in complete agreement with with"
"Don's view of it and where he's going"
"with it I have a somewhat less less"
"ambitious thing which is that I'm"
"interested in cognition cognition is not"
"the same as Consciousness uh cognition"
"is uh and and I uh they have to you know"
"I sort of get into this in in"
"excruciating detail in this last"
"detained paper uh what what what exactly"
"I mean mean by by cognition but to"
"address your your first point uh I do I"
"do think that uh there's way more of it"
"not less of it than uh than than for"
"example Descartes might have thought I"
"think it's actually uh extremely"
"prevalent in the in the in the universe"
"I don't think it uh is limited to things"
"that we would call alive I'm actually"
"not sure what we mean by alive"
"necessarily and I don't spend any time"
"trying to figure out what this category"
"is other people do and that's great I"
"spend all of my time thinking about"
"cognition not life because I think there"
"are many things that uh uh are um"
"importantly cognitive that we would may"
"or may not call life"
"and uh with that so so that's a and and"
"I have this uh and and B is that I have"
"this um functional framework it's called"
"t-a-m-e which is technological approach"
"to mind everywhere uh that basically"
"it's a very engineering uh kind of uh"
"approach that seeks to show you what"
"exactly are the practical benefits of"
"odd cognitive lens so it's very"
"important to me that this is not just"
"philosophy that this is these these all"
"of these views are supposed to drive new"
"discoveries new research programs new so"
"so so half of my lab takes this stuff"
"and turns it into interventions for"
"biomedicine for cancer for whatever"
"because this is not just supposed to be"
"well you can look at it this way or you"
"can Occam's razor it and you know just"
"sort of do the science no that's"
"actually not true these this way of"
"thinking about this gives rise to new"
"experiments and new capabilities that we"
"didn't have before so"
"um and and maybe at some point"
"Consciousness will be folded into that I"
"haven't done that yet and so I make no"
"no claims whatsoever about Consciousness"
yet
"um but uh but but but I do think that uh"
"that uh"
"this this this this view of um"
"basically basically dropping our"
"teleophobia we've got this we got this"
"we've developed uh through through uh"
"the early stages of science this really"
"weird fear of talking about goals and"
"and and the systems that pursue goals"
"and I think we need to dump that I think"
"that leaves us so much on the table when"
"we pretend that doesn't exist uh since"
"this is the the 40s and cybernetics"
"we've had good theories of of how you"
"can have non-magical goal pursuing um"
"systems so I think it's time to kind of"
"give up our fear of that and and and"
"once you do that uh really interesting"
"examples of uh novel research programs"
"come come to light and bioelectricity"
"you know I think you mentioned by"
"electricity so so bioelectricity happens"
"to be my favorite kind of cognitive glue"
"for um cells into larger systems but it"
"is not the only one I don't think it's"
"magic I don't think it's the only game"
"in town I'm sure there are other"
"mechanisms that uh play the same"
"functional roles and who knows other"
"places in the universe what substrates"
"um uh play that role but here on Earth"
"what evolution has done is really"
"exploited by electricity and shown us"
"how you can use uh certain features of"
"physics and and computation to scale up"
"cognition from very primitive goals of"
"homeostatic little you know tiny systems"
"all the way up through human level"
"massive cognitive light cones so so I"
"love bioelectricity but it is certainly"
"not the only game in town for that"
"cool thank you Michael can we give a"
"massive thank you to Professor Levin"
"because Pastor Levin would have to leave"
"now so um"
"a massive thank you to Professor Lavin"
everybody
"thank you so much uh thank you for"
"having us uh great to see you Don um"
"awesome to be able to discuss this and"
"thanks everybody thank you for your"
"questions great to see you Mike thank"
"you see you soon thanks right see you"
"soon thank you thank you bye so I'll"
"respond to the question is as well so"
"um first the notion of reality I would"
"distinguish two"
"kinds of reality"
um
"you might say something is real if it"
"exists even if no one perceives it"
"that would be what you might call"
"objective reality"
"um but"
"that wouldn't apply to my headache so"
"suppose I have a headache well that"
headache
"um sure seems real to me but it would"
"would not exist without someone"
"perceiving it right so so the notion of"
"objective reality doesn't seem to catch"
"my headache and if you told me my"
"headache wasn't real I'd be very crossed"
"with you I mean it's it's real to me so"
"I'll distinguish between objective"
"objective reality versus subjective"
"reality in that sense and and then what"
"I'm saying is that um we thought that"
"space-time and physical objects like the"
"sun and the moon are objective reality"
"and all I'm saying is no they're a"
"different kind of reality they're"
"subjective reality there we thought that"
"they were objective reality but no"
"they're subject to reality and I think"
"quantum theory"
"the the Nobel Prize in physics last"
"month was awarded to three researchers"
"who have done empirical work showing"
that
"um local realism is false and basically"
"I'm saying what I'm saying is local"
"realism is false these things are all"
"subjectively real they're they're there"
"when you observe those properties are"
"there when you observe and they're not"
"there when you don't observe so they're"
"they're subjectively real but not"
"objectively real"
"so now in terms of lightness yeah"
"liveness brilliant work in the"
"monodology and um you know he had the"
"the analogy of the mill where he"
"understood the hard problem of"
"Consciousness and dismissed it in one"
"paragraph he he knew that you couldn't"
"boot up Consciousness from physical"
"systems and it was so obvious to him he"
"didn't think it was worth more than one"
"paragraph of his time to to spend on it"
and
"I agree and so he then proposes the"
"Theology and the monads and his his big"
"he he basically says we need to start"
"with um two things"
um
"experiences and probabilistic"
"relationships among experiences"
"and uh I agree with leibniz again"
"um that's what we've done in our model"
"of conscious agents we basically model"
"experiences and probabilistic"
"relationships among experiences so so"
"liveness was there 300 years before me"
"um you know"
"and his notion of pre-established"
Harmony
"um that I think we're going to be able"
"to model that in the way I was talking"
"about earlier where I have like a big"
"markovian kernel for a big conscious"
"agent and when I take it's Trace chain"
"there's two to the N Trace chains those"
"are two to the n"
"conscious agents that are all"
"interacting it'll look like a"
"pre-established Harmony because they're"
"all part from this one big now I can't"
"do the trace channel on the one big"
"concentration the ultimate one I can't"
"do that just because well Apple hasn't"
"built a big enough laptop for me yet but"
"um so"
"you could you know go to all of Canter's"
"hierarchy of infinity so so apple has a"
"little bit of work to do ahead um for"
"that so so we can't do that but but but"
"I sort of can see the notion of"
"pre-established Harmony coming out of"
"this but it's also very useful for me to"
"talk about conscious agents interacting"
"in non-trivial ways as independent"
"agents looking at their interactions so"
"so I mean ultimately I think"
um
"leibnizance is right but I think this"
"other perspective is is useful given"
"that we can't actually model the one"
"itself and and finally in terms of what"
"kinds of you know testable predictions"
"that's what I'm working on this year I I"
"want to"
"I'll be writing a paper and and"
"experiments where we try to show that we"
"can predict precise part-time"
distributions
"four protons"
"coming through conscious agents so the"
"proton as everyone knows is one of the"
"fundamental parts of the nucleus protons"
"and neutrons the nucleus of atoms the"
"proton itself"
"he is one of the most complicated things"
"humankind has ever studied it's not a"
"trivial little ball and it's not just"
"three quarks you see three quarks two up"
"quarks and a down Quark at at sort of"
"low spatial resolution Bjork and x and"
"low temporal resolution Q squared but as"
"you increase your spatial and temporal"
"resolution you find that the highest"
"resolution you see a a what they call a"
"gluon c an ocean of gluons that are"
"appearing and disappearing and then as"
"you back off on your you know you sort"
"of have larger temporal"
"larger temporal scales less temporal"
"resolution then you start seeing Quark"
"antiquark appear or disappear so you get"
"this Quark C and and then finally at the"
"the crew to scale you see"
"um the three quarks and and then some"
"other quarks that are appearing and"
"disappearing so they have momentum"
distributions
"for all Bjork and x and all q squareds"
"and and I want to show that we can get"
"all of those"
"as artifacts of the spatial and temporal"
"Windows of our Trace chain in other"
words
"these particles and their properties"
"that we're seeing at the colliders are"
"not an insight into a fundamental"
"reality all of the particles and all of"
"their properties are artifacts of the"
"spatial and temporal resolution of of"
"trick by conscious agents in their"
"observations so so again I could be"
"wrong but but but you're asking for a"
"you know a prediction so"
"the thing about predictions is you can"
"be wrong so this is the prediction that"
"we're going to try to make"
"um and we'll we'll see where it goes"
"great thank you"
"uh thank you very much uh good to see"
"you Professor Hoffman"
"um I have a question about uh the"
"problem of perception"
"so under the free energy principle uh"
"perception has been defined as"
"finding the most likely explanation or"
"the most likely value for a hidden"
"variable given the current observations"
"that say we have let's say we have five"
"sensory inputs and at time T we are"
"receiving five different uh"
"sensory inputs through those five"
"channels and given that I'd like to"
"predict the most likely explanation"
"for a given hit or a hidden variable"
"that has probably caused those sensory"
inputs
"um especially in artificial intelligence"
"uh when we want to create smart AI"
"models particularly deep learning models"
"we are talking about a hierarchical"
"structure of layered neurons"
"um and one of the reasons that we do"
that
"which is also similar to what they do in"
"predictive coding networks is that we"
"are having a hierarchical structure of"
"neurons so that we might be able to"
"infer the hierarchical"
"uh sequence of you know Links of"
"causality behind"
"what is it like in in the world out"
"there that might have caused these"
"sensory inputs sort of model the"
"hierarchical structure of God knows how"
"many hidden variables and the way"
"they're connected to one another now my"
"if first of all I'd like to know whether"
"you agree with this uh like like would"
"this be the right"
"um at least approach try to understand"
"in trying to understand the complicated"
"hierarchical structure of hidden"
"variables and second of all"
"um because"
"uh I mean let me put this way it seems"
"intractable to me to to try and sort of"
"you know model uh you know potentially"
"many many many"
"such hierarchical relationships to so"
"that we could model the world around us"
"because just too complicated so these"
"are my two questions thank you very much"
"yeah great great question so the the"
"idea of perception as Bayesian inference"
"is uh you know has a long history in the"
"field uh um I've I've done some papers"
"on that myself um there's a book called"
"perception is Bayesian inference so if"
"you there is actually a book called"
"perception is basing Difference by"
"edited by um David Nill and Whitman"
"Richards and Whitman Richards was my PhD"
"advisor and I have a paper in that book"
"so I'm very interested and I that's a"
"1996 book so it's just quite old now but"
"um it's I've been interested a long time"
"in Bayesian inference models of"
"perception and and I think that they're"
"quite powerful most of my colleagues who"
"are doing that are are assuming that um"
"space and time is fundamental reality"
"and that we're we're the Bayesian"
"inference was we're actually finding the"
"true physical uh substrate behind our"
"our perceptions and I think that that"
"whole thing is that that interpretation"
"of Bayesian inference is mistaken and if"
"you go to the you know predictive"
"processing a pretty good coding kind of"
"thing and uh"
"the work on Bayes nets for example in"
"the implications there what you see is"
um
"the nodes inside"
"a Marco blanket appear to be doing this"
"kind of um you know amazing estimation"
"whenever I say something it sounds like"
"Siri Siri on my phone starts you know"
"anyway so so but but but here's the key"
"thing that that we know about Bayes Nets"
"the even though it looks like the nodes"
"on the inside are doing some kind of"
"Bayesian inference about the world"
"States we know that the states of the"
"nodes on the inside"
"and the states of the nodes on the"
"outside of the Marco blanket are"
"conditionally independent"
"given the state of the Markel blanket"
"that means"
"the only thing that the nodes on the"
"inside can never can ever know about the"
"external world"
"is the information on the Markel blanket"
"so that whole framework tells you"
"that you're only seeing an interface the"
"Markov blanket is your interface and"
"you're not when you're doing this"
"predictive processing you're not predict"
"you're not estimating the true state of"
"the world you're doing something on an"
"interface and you're using only"
"interface variables so you never see the"
"truth and you're not estimating the"
truth
"and it's just right there in the actual"
"you know the fact that a Markov blanket"
"is the set of nodes that makes the"
"internal nodes and external nodes"
"conditionally independent that means you"
"can't know anything more about the"
"external nodes except what you see on"
"your markup blanket so so it it just"
"really highlights what I've said from"
"evolution of natural selection and what"
"the physicists are telling us"
"not fundamental Evolution tells us it's"
"just an interface and so does the markup"
"blanket that tells you is just an"
"interface so they all agree"
"thank you very much"
"thank you Don John did you have any"
"questions for Don"
"uh thank you Ivy yeah I I the one thing"
"I guess I"
"as a physicist I confess I"
"um the one part I like to I love your uh"
"Windows interface analogy you know and I"
"and I think that's really powerful"
"oh I'm I'm sorry yeah sorry not doing"
"um but I feel like I feel like I can't"
"quite make the leap to you know my"
"experience in the world and so for"
"instance the things that I have trouble"
"with is kind of extending that to the"
"idea that I can both see things and feel"
"things and I can travel to those things"
"that I see and touch them and other"
"people can too and they have the same"
"experience and I don't know maybe I'm I"
"just feel like I'm missing something"
"there and I wonder if you have anything"
"to help me over that"
"sure sure I think"
"I think the virtual reality metaphor is"
"a big big help here so for people who"
"are playing multiplayer so in"
"multiplayer VR games so I'm I'm playing"
"with somebody in China and you know in"
"Germany and in Argentina we're all"
"playing Grand Theft Auto together and we"
"can all agree that oh yeah I you know"
"Hoffman is racing against a red Porsche"
"and the red Porsche is you know is 20"
"meters ahead of Hoffman and we all agree"
"so we have consensus and and and they"
"might be giving me advice you say you"
"know how can you do a hard left there is"
"a shortcut you can beat them something"
"like that"
"so we have consensus and it looks like"
"there's a subjective reality but we know"
"that there is no red Porsche anywhere"
"there's just some super computer and"
"we're toggling bits so so when the"
"physicists like Nema or Connie Hamed"
"tell us that space time is doomed right"
"that that it's not fundamental reality"
"they're but they're going Beyond they're"
"saying okay there is a reality beyond"
"space and time and by the way Beyond"
"quantum theory right and but but they're"
"saying that quantum theory itself is not"
"fundamental so so the new structures"
"that they're finding like the"
"amplitohedrum there are no helper spaces"
there
"but the apple iihedron is this High"
"dimensional geometric object with"
"um facets and faces and edges and"
"vertices and it turns out that the"
"properties of space-time and quantum"
"theory locality and unitarity are coded"
"in the face structure of these geometric"
"objects beyond space time"
"so so so this so the physicists"
"themselves and this is only in the last"
"10 years so most by the way I was at a"
"conference on Consciousness just a"
"couple months ago where a number of"
"physicists who are quantum theorists so"
"they're they're phds in quantum theory"
"and they're looking at Consciousness at"
"the end of their talks every one of them"
"I ask now are you aware of these"
"structures beyond space on the"
"amplitudehedron and the decorative"
"permutations and to a person they had"
"never heard of it now now the reason is"
"is this is high energy physics right"
"only people who are in high particle"
"physics right know about this stuff and"
"you know so why does a cognitive"
"scientist know about it well because I I"
"knew I needed to look for something"
"Beyond space-time so I've been looking"
"for physics beyond space time and when I"
"found Nema arcanian Network I realized"
"okay okay"
"are the ones that would be doing it"
"they're the ones that are pushing the"
"envelope with the highest energies right"
"they're the ones that that are going"
"there so so it's and and it's Nema who's"
"saying quantum theory is doomed not just"
"space time but quantum theory that both"
"of those are going to arise together"
"because if you think about it the you"
"know the particles"
"right some people are trying to boot up"
"space-time from like entanglement of of"
"particles right but what are particles"
"particles are irreducible"
"representations the point Craig group of"
"the symmetries of space-time So you"
"you're you're not getting outside of"
"space-time you're just staying in so so"
"quantum theory does not get you behind"
"space time in fact all the weirdness of"
"quantum theory the fact you need"
"superpositions and collapse and all this"
"stuff is a symptom of an interface"
"is the fact that you've lost information"
"in projection that's why we get the"
"weirdness of quantum theory and the no"
"cloning theorem and all that stuff is"
"all an artifact of space-time not being"
"fundamental and there's this deeper"
"reality so now where physics is right"
"now is so the amplitohedron that is so"
"here's something for a physicist"
"if you do"
"the scattering amplitude computation say"
"for two gluons smashing into each other"
"four gluons sprang out you do it in"
"space time using Quantum field Theory"
"it's hundreds of pages of algebra nasty"
"nasty math"
"if you do it with the amplitohedron"
"three or four terms you can compute it"
"by hand"
"the math becomes trivial well relatively"
trivial
"is all relative"
"um but trivial compared to"
"um what you have to do with with diamond"
"diagrams and and the other kicker is you"
"see new symmetries there's something"
"called the infinite yangian symmetry"
"that's true of the scattering but you"
"cannot see it in space time you can only"
"see it when you go beyond space time so"
"when the physics when the physicists"
"find that the math is getting simpler"
"and you're seeing new symmetries bye bye"
"space time"
remember
"well I'll be sorry to see it go but"
"well it's a wonderful headset it's been"
"a useful headset"
"thank you move on to the note"
"yeah very quickly Donald you didn't talk"
"about the hard problems Consciousness it"
"seems to me in fact that that problem"
"Still Remains as a problem because you"
"essentially created a mathematical model"
"of uh you know the effects of"
"Consciousness not the Consciousness but"
"the effects of Consciousness whereas the"
"sentient the sentience is coming into"
"play in probably all the all the the way"
"you're kind of portraying the reality"
"can you just very quickly tell us"
"something about this because I feel that"
"experience is something that you cannot"
"you cannot convert it into any kind of"
"model that is my uh"
"right right so the hard problem is that"
"it comes up if you if you assume the"
"space and time are fundamental and"
"you're trying to figure out how for"
"example something like neural activity"
"could cause conscious experiences and"
"and and there um I've got many friends"
"and colleagues who are working in that"
"direction and they're brilliant but it's"
"impossible to solve that problem"
"um and and the failure is clear there's"
"you know there's for example integrated"
"information Theory what is the"
"integrated information that must be the"
"taste of chocolate or the smell of"
"garlic there's not a single one that"
"they can do same thing with the"
"orchestrated collapse of microtubules"
"there's not a single specific conscious"
"experience that they can explain it I"
"predict I bet good money that they'll"
"never be able to do it because it's it's"
"just impossible liveness was right"
"um it's impossible so so for me I I I"
"don't have the hard problem of"
"Consciousness because I'm not trying to"
"boot up Consciousness from non"
"non-conscious ingredients I'm saying"
"that that whole approach is wrong so"
"I've got the reverse hard problem I have"
"to I have to show if I start with"
"Consciousness so I'm assuming"
"Consciousness I have to show you how I"
"give you physics 6 in all detail"
"so I'm doing the reverse hard problem"
"and that's why I said my goal this year"
"is to predict the Parton distributions"
"for all the quarks and gluons and so"
"forth inside the proton in other words"
"that's my reverse heart problem so I"
"agree that we need to solve it but I"
"have to go in the other direction that"
"one I think is is feasible and my by the"
"way my current simulations are already"
"very very um"
"they're they're encouraging at small"
"temporal scales I get a a gluon c like a"
"a massless particle C appearing and as I"
"increase the temporal scales I get a c"
"of a small"
"increase the temporal skill even more I"
"start getting bigger particles with"
"greater math so I I get the I've already"
"in my simulations got the big picture"
"now but my goal is not just the big"
"picture I want to get the exact momentum"
"distributions but already my current"
"simulations tell me"
"um you know"
"this is you know very profitable"
Direction
"thank you Don can we move on to Ethan"
"prilock yeah straight to your question"
"please yeah well I had asked it about"
"delbrook earlier and I'm just curious"
"about comments as to how you have"
"additions or subtractions or how similar"
"it is thinking well so just briefly I"
"mean Delbert did a lot of things so what"
"specific idea about Dell bricks did you"
"want me to comment on I mean"
"yeah I mean he talked about Evolution"
"not really providing for something that"
"we should expect to understand uh you"
"know uh the fitness function as modeling"
"underlying reality"
"so so I'm not familiar with that so he"
"he actually said that that the notion of"
"a fitness function the fitness payout"
"function is not a useful tool you're"
"saying yeah he said it wouldn't really"
"we shouldn't expect it because of evil"
"the way Evolution works that to"
"represent the underlying reality"
"but he didn't you know he didn't talk"
"about it in terms of you know operating"
"systems course"
"well I see so you're saying that he was"
"sort of agreeing with me that he was"
"saying that that we shouldn't expect"
"evolutionary grounds that we don't see"
"reality as it is oh oh yeah yeah"
"absolutely and he was the student also"
"of some of the great modern Hebrew"
"doctoral students one or two of the"
"great modern physicists before he became"
"a biologist"
"right so so yeah and I think it was not"
"a reductionist and I'm not a"
"reductionist either so so I I so I'll"
"just say yes I agree with Del Brook on"
"that and of course Kiki is absolutely my"
"Superior in terms of his knowledge of uh"
"molecular biology"
"and then my other one quick question too"
"is in terms of the stuff that you were"
"talking about these formalisms is there"
"anything that would if we stay on the"
"side of the Planck limits that would"
"make a demarcation about describing"
"features of the universe in you know a"
"Prebiotic situation or a proto-ecology"
"and is there anything that would show"
"something like that"
"years well"
"what what I think is going to happen"
"from the simulations I'm doing is that"
"as I"
"increase the windows the spatial and"
"temporal Windows of the trace chains"
"that I that I do I will get more and"
"more complicated behaviors and and so"
"I'm doing particles because that's the"
"the most trivial thing I mean I'm doing"
"the physics is is it's going to be the"
"easiest thing it's also where we have"
"the most data right the physicists have"
"been doing these scattering experiments"
"for decades and so we have tons of data"
"and so I I'm not going after the physics"
"because I think that that's the final"
"thing or the the most important thing is"
"it's the thing that you can do first and"
"and you can get but I eventually want to"
"show how as we go to larger scales of"
"these Trace chains we will then be able"
"to see like the emergence of cells and"
"and organisms and greater organization"
"but but that's more complicated if I"
"went after that first I I wouldn't have"
"anything to report I need to do the"
"physics where we actually have a shot at"
"getting a concrete result thank you Don"
"can we move on to Tony please quickly"
"yeah it's going to be Don's last"
question
"okay let me try to add something useful"
"how you relate physics"
"or fundamental physics particle physics"
"and Consciousness this part is still not"
"clear to me"
"okay so so the we just published a paper"
"last week that you can take a look at"
"it's called fusions of Consciousness so"
"if you just Google my name Donald"
"Hoffman and fusions of Consciousness"
"it's it's available free online and"
"you'll you'll read how we make the"
"connection but what I'll say it top"
"level is what we show in that paper"
"is that"
"communication or communicating classes"
"of conscious agents"
um
"correspond are what are being cataloged"
"by decorated permutation so the"
"physicists found these decorated"
"permutations Beyond space-time these"
"decorative permutations account for most"
"of the data about scattering in"
"space-time so we said okay if decorated"
"permutations are the deepest thing the"
"physicists have found Beyond space-time"
"let's take our Theory Of Consciousness"
"and project it onto decorative"
"permutations and we did so that so we"
"introduce new mathematics the"
"mathematics that takes Markov chains and"
"Maps them to decorated permutations is"
"brand new in our paper so that's a new"
"contribution as far as I can tell to"
"mathematics and that tells us now that"
"particles in space-time correspond to"
"communicating classes of conscious"
"agents so that's so that paper"
"establishes that part and we we're clear"
"in the paper we're proposing that"
"particles in space-time are projections"
"of communicating classes of of conscious"
agents
"so in the next paper that we're working"
"on I'm going to we're planning to now"
"make specific"
"mapping so for example what properties"
"of communicating classes correspond to"
"the mass of a particle and there as I"
"mentioned earlier so my proposal and"
"this is not published so I'm telling you"
"what we're working on and and and if you"
"can beat me to it go ahead and publish"
"it you know that it'll be fine I I I"
"don't care who publishes it I just want"
"to read the papers I just want to know"
"this stuff so so I'm putting my ideas"
"out there and someone who's a lot of"
"people are smarter than me in this area"
"so you can run with it and I'll be happy"
"to read your paper what we're proposing"
"is that the entropy rate of a"
"communicating class"
"corresponds to the Mass"
"and the number of states in the"
"communicating class will will lead"
"almost immediately or or momentum on"
"wavelengths so so those are the things"
"that we're looking at right now but"
"we're going to write we're writing a"
paper
"um tentatively called traces of traces"
"of Consciousness where we use these"
"Trace chains and show how particles"
"arise as artifacts of the trace process"
"and all of their properties arise like"
"the the they'll then be artifacts like"
"the entropy rate of the markovian kernel"
"that happened to arise as an artifact of"
"the trace chain process that will be the"
"mass that you see so so that's how I'm"
"proposing to get physics all of the"
"particles and all the properties are not"
"fundamental reality they are artifacts"
"of the way we observe"
"statistical artifacts and we're going to"
"so and it's not just a hand wave we're"
"going to say now exactly what the"
"statistics are and exactly how those"
"properties are emerge as the artifacts"
"and why you get"
"like bosons first and then only later"
"does it condense and deferments and so"
"forth that that's all going to fall out"
"of this so"
"if I make"
"I will cry otherwise on stage"
"I'm sorry my day we have to stop the"
"interview now"
"um don't have to go so can we all give a"
"massive thank you to Don for today for"
"his time please"
"Don thank you so much it's been amazing"
"thank you very much"
"thank you"
"so much we'll see you later bye-bye"
bye-bye
