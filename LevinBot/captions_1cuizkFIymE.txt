"I'm pleased to be joined today by Dr"
"Michael Levin he's a distinguished"
"professor of biology at Tufts University"
"where he researches a wide array of"
"topics ranging from learning and memory"
"to regrowing limbs in animals Mike"
"welcome to the nature nurture podcast"
"thank you so much pleasure to be here"
"thank you so what is the central theme"
"that connects all of your research"
"because at first glance these things"
"these cognitive things and then looking"
"at like limb regeneration and"
"biomechanics are very different"
"yeah um so so we do a lot of things in"
"our lab including some work in Ai and"
"cancer and synthetic uh living organisms"
"even more breadth than I alluded to yeah"
"yeah many many things uh but but there"
"is a central theme that ties it all"
"together so so these are all facets of"
"one question really so what I'm"
"interested in is embodied mind I'm"
"interested in how uh various diverse and"
"I'm talking about highly diverse uh"
"substrates can put forth some degree of"
"intelligence competency cognition and so"
"on so we're interested in mind"
"um embodied in in in very uh very"
different
"um architectures so we work in slime"
"molds and cells and tissues and organs"
"and uh whole whole colonies for example"
"and colonies and things like that yeah"
"these are all things you might not"
"ordinarily consider having Minds at"
"least the average person who's not doing"
"this type of research"
"yeah um and so and so if if one takes"
"the position that some things have minds"
"and other things don't have Minds then"
"one has to uh really specify what the"
"what the what the binary criteria are so"
"so I don't I don't believe in a binary"
"Criterion I have been working on a"
"system of um and certainly I'm not the"
"first uh a system of a Continuum of of"
"uh of of agency and the idea is to be"
"able to specify uh what kind of problem"
"spaces different systems work in and"
"what competencies they have to solve"
"problems in those problem spaces and"
"this once you think of it that way it it"
"does a couple of things it um"
"uh sort of dissolves a bunch of pseudo"
"problems that people get hung up on all"
"the time but also it provides very"
"specific research agendas so so for"
"example in thinking about morphogenesis"
"as a as a collective intelligence of"
"cells trying to navigate amorphous space"
"so the space of possible anatomical"
configurations
"and what morphogenesis let's say during"
"embryonic development or during"
"regeneration what it does is it tries to"
"navigate from from one spot where it"
"begins to a Target morphology a region"
"of morphos space that is appropriate to"
"the whatever shape it's trying to build"
"so so looking at that as a as a um"
"as a kind of collective intelligence"
"that has goals and various competencies"
"to get there opens up a whole new"
"research program because then you're not"
"limited to trying to manage"
"morphogenesis bottom up by by"
"manipulating the hardware of the system"
"but you're you you start to get you"
"start to ask computational questions"
"what does it know what does it measure"
"uh how does it know where it's going"
"could we train it could we use the"
"various tools of Neuroscience to uh to"
"manipulate uh its competencies"
"um are there are there stress"
"minimization is there active inference"
"all of these things and these so these"
"become research research programs so"
"morphogenesis that is the process by"
"which cells decide what to become like"
"become a limb or a head or whatever"
"well to be specific uh it's it's first"
"of all it's not just individual cells"
"it's collectives so so no individual"
"cell knows how many fingers you have or"
"what a finger is but the but the"
"collective certainly does and it's uh"
"it's not only it's not only the the"
"initial step which is making decisions"
"of how to become specific shapes you"
"know for different organs the whole body"
plan
"but actually the decisions it makes"
"after that to uh to to defend that shape"
"against uh injuries accidents uh aging"
"cancer and so on so there are many"
"people say even if there aren't any"
"binaries here I imagine there's a"
"massive switch when you go from like a"
"single-celled organism to multicellular"
"in in terms of complexity and what"
"happens there so what is that what does"
"that shift look like yeah I what one"
"there are many ways to think about that"
"shift and so some people think about it"
"as as a shift of evolutionary"
"individuality and various other things"
"uh one lens that I find useful is"
"um to look at uh shifts in terms of uh"
"the the intelligence and what I mean by"
"intelligence is a kind of uh William"
"James's definition which is"
"the ability to reach the same goal by"
"different means so basically comp"
"problem solving competencies and so what"
"happens uh with in in going from"
"Individual cells to multicellular"
"structures is is 2 things one is a"
"change in in the problem space in which"
"it works so single cells solve problems"
"in metabolic spaces in transcriptional"
"spaces and so on but collectives of"
"cells can solve problems in anatomical"
"amorphous space meaning that they can"
"make they can work together towards a"
"goal that's uh making an organ or making"
"a body structure I mean of course there"
"are other spaces after that so there's"
"the three-dimensional space of"
"conventional Behavior there are"
"linguistic spaces and so on and so one"
"thing that happens is that that the"
"system becomes incapable of of of of"
"having goals in other problem spaces but"
"also it enlarges what I call the"
"cognitive light cone so the cognitive"
"light cone is basically a kind of"
"diagram that uh tries to uh"
"semi-quantitatively map out the size of"
"goals that it can work towards so so if"
"you think about so so all creatures"
"including evolved um"
"I have a natural synthetic beings all"
"kinds of creatures one of the things"
"that ties them all together is having a"
"particular shape of a cognitive light"
"cone which is how what what is the size"
"of literally the spatio temporal size of"
"the goals that it can work towards and"
"so so the thing that happens during"
"multicellularity and then and then"
"collapses during disorders such as"
"cancer is the size is the this inflation"
"of the cognitive light cone the goals"
"that it can produce become much bigger"
"and more complex"
"when people talk about the goals of an"
"organism especially from an evolutionary"
"perspective some take it very literally"
"like the organism always has its own"
"drive to survive and reproduce and"
"others treat it as this sort of passive"
"process like goal is just a metaphor for"
"the process that Evolution naturally"
unfolds
"how much intentionality do you attribute"
"to to animals across this complexity"
"Spectrum yeah well I I let's let's let's"
"uh dissect that in a couple of ways so"
"so first of all I take not only"
"individual animals as having goals but"
"lots of their components do so so your"
"various organs have goals your your"
"individual cells have goals the"
"molecular networks inside those cells"
"have specific goals in different in"
"various spaces we we as humans are"
"terrible at recognizing intelligent"
"goal-directed behavior in unconventional"
"spaces we're very good at noticing uh"
"you know medium-sized objects moving at"
"medium speeds and achieving um goals in"
"in three-dimensional behavioral space"
"but if you for example had um an inborn"
"uh kind of an innate a sense of your"
"your blood chemistry you would be very"
"quick to be able to recognize your liver"
"and your kidneys and so and as solving"
"really interesting problems in"
"physiological space and and so so we"
"need to be really humble about uh about"
"being able to detect these things I take"
"um you know how seriously do we take"
"these metaphors I mean the first thing I"
"want to say is that all all science is"
"the construction of metaphor we have"
"nothing so people will say wow that's"
"just a metaphor that's all we have"
"there's nothing else everything is a"
"metaphor and so if you want to talk"
"about human goals of course there will"
"there are people who will say that well"
"humans don't have goals either they just"
"have you know they they're they're a"
complex
"kinds of uh kinds of systems that"
"respond to specific stimuli and then"
"whatever happens happens so so I take I"
"take a goal talk very seriously uh I"
"think that um goals goal directedness is"
"an incredibly powerful uh metaphor"
"because it helps you make predictions it"
"helps you do new science and it helps"
"you reach new capabilities which means"
"that uh in order to make claims about"
"goals you can't just sort of sit back in"
"your armchair and say thermostats don't"
"have goals I I have goals you know these"
"are you you can't make these"
"philosophical pronouncements you have to"
"do experiments so what that means is you"
"have to specify a problem space you have"
"to specify what you think the goal is"
"and then you have to make a hypothesis"
"about how much competency does the"
"system have to reach that goal and then"
"you do an experiment and then we find"
"out if your set of hypotheses was useful"
"or not and so these are all empirical"
"questions and I uh you know for us in"
"making uh goal centered models of"
"regeneration of development of various"
"things like that we've reached lots of"
"new capabilities that no one had done"
"before and that uh you know new new new"
"new discoveries new research programs so"
"I take I take that to be uh exactly what"
"metaphors and science are supposed to do"
"so I take it very seriously when you're"
"developing a plan of research how do you"
"decide what animal to use ranging from"
"like a very small planarian up to a frog"
"or whatever other level of complexity"
"yeah I mean we go way broader than that"
"in that uh we not only go down well past"
"plenary into cells and bacteria but we"
"also think about synthetic forms uh in"
"silico forms"
"um you know there's a very wide range of"
"possible model systems in which to study"
"this stuff I mean and the criteria are"
"you want to balance you you want an"
"example that you want you want something"
"that really illustrates very well the"
"phenomenon you want to study but you"
"also need it to be tractable so it needs"
"to be something that um occurred or or"
"adjacent possible tools will allow you"
"to uh to really to really make a make a"
"dent in the understanding thereof so"
"that's how that's you know so all these"
"different model systems are good for"
"different things"
"um in Silicon models are really good"
"because you control exactly which"
"aspects you want to include and which"
"aspects you want to ignore so that's"
"that's very useful and also they're very"
"fast and so you can do you know millions"
"of generations uh in a simulation that"
"you couldn't do in real life planaria"
"are very good to understand natural"
"mechanisms of regeneration for example"
"but one thing you can't do in planaria"
"is practice new regenerative therapies"
"because they're already so good at it"
"there's nothing to improve they just I"
"mean they're they're perfect"
"regenerators so for that we usually"
"start with something like frog which has"
"a limited regenerative capacity it has"
"tissue renewal the way that humans do"
"but as an adult it has very limited"
"regenerative capacity so we try to"
"improve that and then for human"
"relevance you might go to human cells"
"and culture or you might go to organoids"
"or mouse or or something like that so"
"you know you want you want a tractable"
"model of whatever you're studying where"
"did your research start and how did it"
evolve
"wow uh yeah I guess that depends how far"
"back you want to go so if we can go back"
"as far as you like"
"well I guess I guess I mean I I've been"
"interested in this stuff since I was a"
"kid so so so very young uh I was really"
"interested in uh engineering and the"
"understanding of electronic artifacts"
"like televisions and and how it was that"
"I mean we're talking I don't know five"
"six seven years old I would I would look"
"into the back of a television set and"
"just be just amazed that somebody knew"
"how to put all those parts together to"
"make it work the correct way but at the"
"same time"
"um you know you I would go outside and"
"look at look at Beetles and and um"
"caterpillars and and various insects and"
"think about what the commonalities and"
"differences were so these things also"
"made of Parts uh how did they get here"
"um how is it that they seem to have"
"preferences and uh and behavioral"
"repertoires that our Machinery doesn't"
"have it doesn't have and what's the you"
"know what's the commonality there you"
"think there's something about relative"
"Simplicity like talk I'm assuming you're"
"talking about like an old school boxy"
"television which you could actually take"
"apart and maybe get a sense at how it's"
"working and nowadays like you just have"
"a very compact screen you can't take"
"apart at all and I imagine in biology"
"it's it's somewhat similar right like"
"you might think that uh the smaller the"
"animal the simpler it is but then also"
"it's like once as you can you can look"
"at a human and then"
"kind of just at a more macro scale look"
"at the limbs and what they're thinking"
"and saying and kind of get a broad idea"
"of what's going on even if you know"
"nothing about the cellular biology but"
"then the smaller you go it seems like"
"the more you need that cellular biology"
"knowledge and in order to get a sense of"
"what's going on do you see a parallel"
"there yeah I mean I think I think it's"
"all in the eye of the Observer and what"
"kind of questions you're asking I mean I"
"don't think there really is any"
"Simplicity in biology anywhere I think"
"we impose certain kinds of Simplicity"
"when we as scientists make decisions"
"about what we're going to ignore and"
"what we're going to try to focus on"
"which is essential right the kind of the"
"whole point of science is to be able to"
"say something without having to say"
"everything and uh"
"you know when people say simple"
"organisms I mean you know look you're"
"you know yes you're not going to study"
"um complex psychological drives and then"
"social uh Behavior you know Societies in"
"in planaria but uh so so of course of"
"course there are ways in which they're"
"simpler but"
"um all of the real uh mysteries of what"
"it means to build a body to repair a"
"body to have a a self that's more than"
"the sum of its individual cells all of"
"that is was solved long before planaria"
"came on the scene so so so for the for"
"the wide range of problems that we're"
"really interested in planaria are no"
"less complex than than any other"
"organism I mean they're they're"
"incredibly complex if we understood"
"planaria we would be done with a lot of"
"uh science certainly a lot of the"
"biomedicine that that we need"
"um I don't consider them simple"
"um we should introduce to our audience"
"um what planaria are and then we can"
"return to your to your story no sure um"
"yeah planaria are a kind of a free"
"living flower"
"um they uh have a brain they have"
"various organs they are similar to our"
"ancestors so they have true bilateral"
"symmetry uh they are amazing in many"
"different ways one of them being that"
"they um"
"uh they can be cut into pieces uh I"
"think the record is something like 275"
"pieces every piece will regenerate a"
"perfect little worm so every piece knows"
"exactly what a worm looks like and we'll"
"rebuild all the missing instructors they"
"seem to be immortal there doesn't appear"
"to be anything like an old planarian"
"they sort of don't age at the individual"
"level wow um they uh they're smart so"
"you can train them and if you do train"
"them for specific memories and then cut"
"off their brain they cut off their heads"
"including their brain the tail will sit"
"there for eight or nine days doing"
"nothing they will regrow a new brain and"
"then show evidence that they still"
"remember the original information so"
"they have this kind of distributed"
"memory storage and the ability to um uh"
"uh imprint those memories back onto the"
"newly developing brain"
"um they have um they have very other"
"very various other uh interesting"
"features they they're very cancer"
"resistant but if if you do induce induce"
"a tumor and then you trigger generation"
"elsewhere in the body the tumor tends to"
"get cleared up so they they have this"
"this amazing sort of remodeling uh kind"
"of um kind of capacity planaria that are"
"starved will simply shrink Elementary so"
"they they shrink in perfect proportion"
"and then you feed them and then they"
"grow in perfect proportion"
"um and then and then the final thing"
"which which Bears um bears in"
"interesting ways on this whole question"
"of genomes and what genomes do they they"
"have an incredibly messy genome uh"
"because they tend to reproduce by"
"cutting themselves by by splitting in"
"half and then regenerating so this means"
"that they they they they they accumulate"
"somatic mutations and they can be mixed"
"deployed so every cell could have a"
"different number of chromosomes they're"
"they're a total mess genetically and yet"
"uh they're they're they're Champion"
"regenerators you know with with really"
"excellent is solid anatomical control so"
"that that's that's kind of an"
"interesting puzzle that we can we can"
"talk about is there more variety in"
"their genome compared to an organism of"
"similar size what what do you mean by"
variety
"um in in terms of the mess you were just"
"talking about oh yeah yeah yeah I mean"
"they could you're right uh yeah they"
"could like I said they can be mixed"
"deployed so cells can have different"
"numbers of chromosomes all in the same"
"all in the same animal and that's not"
typical
"no no that's well it's typical of tumors"
"uh but it's definitely not typical for"
"uh for for normal you know normal cells"
"in your organism they all have the same"
"uh almost all of them have the same"
"genetic complement"
"interesting okay we should return to"
"this topic but I I want to let you"
"finish your your starting in your"
"childhood and then talking about how you"
"first became interested in these topics"
"yeah so so I was interested in this"
"issue of of life and engineering and I"
"thought that I was primarily I was"
"interested in mind and these questions"
"of where do things like I mean clearly"
"we're all made of some kind of Parts but"
"somehow we acquire uh we acquire"
"preferences and goals and uh and and"
"um uh memories and and the various uh"
"cognitive capacities in the first person"
"in our perspective and things like that"
"so I thought that uh I was I was a coder"
"from an early age AI program and I"
"thought that uh really the way to"
"understand these things is to try to is"
"to try to build new ones from scratch so"
"artificial life artificial intelligence"
"and so I went uh I went to as an"
"undergrad I went for a computer science"
"degree uh I then sort of halfway through"
"realized that uh we just didn't know"
"enough to do this without the biology"
"and so I also got a biology undergrad"
"degree and then from there"
"um went to I went to grad school and at"
"that point I was uh I was studying Left"
"Right asymmetry during embryogenesis how"
"the different organs figure out which"
"side is left and which side is right and"
"that's that's that's a very interesting"
"problem because it gets to this kind of"
"collective decision making so so to"
"figure out uh which which whether you're"
"on the right or the left side of a"
"midline is a collective decision problem"
"that requires uh some kind of um"
"emergent hole to exist so there's got to"
"be a midline and there's got to be this"
"this large scale uh geometric kind of"
"kind of information that that cells need"
"to make decisions based on and so I"
"worked on that and then as a postdoc uh"
"I sort of push that backwards from the"
"genetics of it to the biophysics of it"
"because of course genes can't tell left"
"from right so there's a there's a"
"physical there's a there's a biophysical"
"uh phenomenon at the root of it so I"
"studied that and then and then in"
"2000 I started my own lab so this was at"
"the Forsyth Institute at the on the"
"Harvard Medical School campus and um"
"at that point we started uh I we had"
"made some of the first"
"uh for the some of the first"
"um molecular tools to read and write the"
"electrical information that the groups"
"of cells are using to store pattern"
"memories and so this is bioelectric this"
"is developmental bioelectricity which of"
"course people have been working on for"
"for a really long time but we had made"
"some of the first molecular tools and so"
"for at that point my lab began uh"
"studying and developing these um uh"
"these methods to uh literally read and"
"write the cognitive medium of cells to"
"to look at a set of tissues and say okay"
"what is the information that they're"
"processing very parallel to what"
"neuroscientists are doing in the brain"
"but this actually happens in every every"
"tissue in your body so we studied and so"
"we started applying that to different"
"different scenarios so regeneration"
"birth defects uh cancer"
"um and so then I moved to Tufts in 2009"
"uh moved to hold the whole group over to"
"Tufts in 2009 and then we continue all"
"of that work and then added a bunch of"
"stuff uh using computational using"
"computational models synthetic biology"
"so so create a synthetic morphology so"
"creating novel"
"um novel living organisms um and that's"
"kind of that's kind of the evolution of"
"it but basically working up from the"
"molecular and biophysical mechanisms of"
"of of cell communication to really try"
"and understand first the computations"
"and then the cognitive aspects of those"
"computations to understand decision"
"making in these other spaces"
"was it uh gradually working your way"
"down in in realizing let's say the"
"complexity of intelligence that first"
"first maybe starting an artificial"
"intelligence if you have this computer"
"science background and then realizing we"
"need to understand the biology to"
"understand intelligence and then perhaps"
"going towards animals and realizing we"
"need to understand cells to understand"
"animals and then we need to understand"
"the molecular biology to understand the"
"cells is that what happened no it's it's"
"actually it's actually the other way"
"around it's uh this this it can continue"
"working upwards actually because I mean"
"it's it's uh you know it's it's very"
"obvious to to everyone that the"
"understanding molecular networks and"
"cells and tissues is important but the"
"vast majority of people I think to this"
"day see it in a very bottom-up fashion"
"in other words that if we you know that"
"that the best way to interact with these"
"things is is a is a in a kind of um a"
"reductionist approach where where we"
"focus on the hardware so look at all of"
"molecular medicine right it's all"
"focused on on the hardware it's a single"
"molecule kinds of approaches genome"
"editing crispr this is this is all"
"hardware and with you know for my"
"computer science background I always"
"thought that you know the hardware is"
"great but look at how much uh Power you"
"get if you're able to understand the"
"software and program uh and take"
"advantage of the reprogrammability of"
"these things at the software level and"
"so so working up from the molecular"
"mechanisms of what's going underneath to"
"then ask bigger questions as yeah but"
"what are the computations what's the"
"system what what's the information"
"processing that the system is doing and"
"then working up from that and saying"
"Beyond computation there are there are"
"cognitive aspects here so what does the"
"system know what does it expect what"
"does it remember what does it measure"
"um and how do we communicate with it and"
"how do we relate to it so sort of"
"working upwards from the from the"
"uh from the physical details of the"
"machine to the computations to finally"
"the sort of aspects of of intelligence"
"and cognition that I'm really interested"
"in could you describe what the"
"computational research that you're doing"
"is and how that complements the biology"
"yeah so so so we have a a variety of"
"computational approaches um"
"one set is uh to make to to construct"
"relatively a bio-realistic models of"
"cellular signaling to to really look at"
"mechanisms by which for example a whole"
"tissue can decide whether the pattern is"
"correct right so so a planarian or a"
"salamander is able to regenerate"
"missing structures and so for that you"
"need to understand how do cells know"
"whether they've hit the correct pattern"
"or not when do they stop what should"
"they build so making computational"
"models of the bioelectric communication"
"in cellular networks using some tools of"
"of a connection is to machine learning"
"and other um other kinds of paradigms to"
"try to understand how do collectives"
"make decisions in morphe space how do"
"they navigate and so so these are"
"computational models of of morphogenesis"
"and those model cancer comes in where if"
"the the signal that you're done doesn't"
"kick in properly then the cells just go"
"out of control and keep multiplying"
"um no cancer is well it's related to"
"that but cancer is a slightly different"
"story so so so I think that uh what"
"happens in cancer is a is a is a SK a"
"reduction of a cognitive light cone so"
"basically what that means is when you"
"have a collection of cells and they're"
"all in very particular electrical"
"communication with each other as a"
"network that Network can store"
"large-scale pattern memories and and"
"work towards implementing a heart or an"
"eye or a liver or whatever it's it's"
"it's making individual cells that become"
"disconnected from that electrical"
"Network they're not any more selfish"
"than the other cells it's just that"
"their selves are smaller they're tiny"
"they they they are no longer connected"
"electrically to this other network and"
"so all the goals that they're able to"
"pursue are single cell scale goals and"
"what do individual cells want every cell"
"wants to become two cells and they want"
"to go where life is good and that's what"
"metastasis and over proliferation of"
"cancer so in cancer that that large"
"cognitively cone"
"um shrinks down because of the of the"
"breakdown of the electrical"
communication
"and then the cells basically revert back"
"to their ancient unicellular lifestyle"
"they that that border between self and"
"external environment the individual"
"cancer cells basically see the rest of"
"the body as just external environment"
"they're just amoebas living in a in a"
"wide world at that point and so so of"
"course they're behaving in ways that are"
"maladaptive for um the rest of the"
"organism yeah what what is the incentive"
"for the organism to like narrow and"
"specialize the cells as opposed to"
"throughout the entire lifespan having"
"everything be a stem cell that has that"
"flexibility to become whatever it needs"
"um well the so so there's a couple of"
"things I mean becoming everything it"
"needs let's remember what in what stem"
"cells are able to do so so individual"
"stem cells can become other cell types"
"but that's not really enough so your"
"hand on your foot have exactly the same"
"cell types but you know so they have"
"Bone and Skin and muscle and then you"
"know whatever the other tissues are but"
"they're but they're different so so"
"having stem cells become individual cell"
"types is not sufficient it's necessary"
"but it's not sufficient so that's like a"
"hardware software question the hardware"
"is the same but they're operating on"
"different software uh basically I mean"
"in general what happens is that the"
"genome provides the cellular Hardware so"
"the genome tells every cell what tiny uh"
"components it gets to have so all the"
"proteins but then after that cells need"
"to interact and form networks in ways"
"that make decisions at the physiological"
"level so those decisions uh right from"
"the beginning when when when the of a"
"bunch of embryonic blastomers get"
"together and become an embryo you know"
"what's what's an embryo right it was you"
"so it's a it's a it's a set of cells"
"that are pursuing specific paths through"
"anatomical amorphous space and uh"
"together as a as a collective and so"
um
"specializing uh and again this is this"
"isn't exactly my field but but but"
"people who study um Evolution the"
"evolution of specialization uh we have"
"been many many stories about why why it"
"paste app cells with specific functions"
"in your body right it's a"
um
"yeah it's it's a highly adaptive"
"architecture you mentioned embryonic"
"development that's another topic that"
"typically gets this sort of binary maybe"
"false binary placed on it like at what"
"point does the embryo become human or"
"become whatever organism it's becoming"
"uh I'm guessing you see it as more of a"
"natural Continuum could you shed some"
"light on that yeah yeah I mean these"
"these issues of when does something"
"become our universally uh pernicious"
"meaning that"
"they provide no value other than no"
"value at all and and they generate all"
"kinds of pseudo problems because trying"
"to find a bright line and at which on on"
"day x of development you are now"
"conscious or you are now a human or you"
"are now a cognitive whatever there's"
"never been a good story about that ever"
"right so people make it up people people"
"will make arbitrary lines and I you know"
"and if for specific"
"um reasons of medical ethics and"
"whatever sometimes you you pick a line"
"just you know the way that it's a little"
"bit like uh when I when I talk my to my"
"students it's it has the same status as"
"the word adult right so so in society we"
"we have this notion of an adult because"
"and at 18 you become an adult and then"
"various other things will happen in"
"court and and so on but we all know"
"nothing special happens on your 18th"
"birthday it's a total Fiction it's a"
"it's a it's a it's a complete fiction"
"that's designed to lubricate the"
"practicalities of social life the the"
"same thing here you can you can draw"
"lines for for various regulatory issues"
"if you want but they don't exist there's"
"no there's never been any convincing uh"
"sharp mechanism where boom you go from"
"from here to there I mean just think"
about
"uh what a what an incredibly slow and"
"gradual process development is there's"
"stuff happening all the time it's it's"
"impossible to pick any one special time"
"frame where something discreet happens"
"and the same thing with Evolution you"
"know when people say the human the I"
"guess they typically mean a modern adult"
"human but if you sort of walk it back"
"right a generation by generation you get"
"to our various hominid ancestors and"
"then very slowly to various other things"
"that are kind of lower primates and and"
"so on and"
"there's there's just no sharp line you"
"know if you wanted to say well well you"
"know humans have have um you know uh I"
"don't know picked something uh true true"
"responsibility for their actions and"
"then and animals don't I mean that"
"binary category completely dissolves"
"when you try when when you take"
"Evolution seriously you sort of walk it"
"back and you say well you're telling me"
"that at some point there were some"
"hominid and there were some some mammals"
"that didn't have it and then these"
"parents boom they had an offspring and"
"now it has it I mean that that that's"
"you know it's just completely"
"implausible so here's something that"
"might have a sharper line at what point"
"do you call something living"
yeah
"um that may have a sharper line I there"
"are people who study that question so so"
"people like Lee Cronin and Sarah Walker"
"and folks like that um I I don't know I"
"I don't work on that and frankly"
um
"I I don't find the category living I"
"don't find that a particularly"
"interesting I mean this is crazy for a"
"biologists to say I know that but but"
"but I don't I don't find that a pretty"
"that a particularly"
"um important uh distinction so I don't"
"mean just uh across development but I"
"mean like at a at an organism level like"
"at what level of complexity or"
"I mean well it's so so so you know the"
"the certainly certainly every part of"
"development is living so eggs are living"
"uh yeah the Single Cell egg is living uh"
"the way the way people do think about"
"this is at the in terms of the origin of"
"life so at one point you had an abiotic"
"Earth with with what they call just"
"chemistry and then eventually you have"
"life so okay there are there are like"
"the folks I mentioned who work on"
"specific criteria for"
"what it means for a planet to have life"
"on it uh and that's and that's and"
"that's fine um I don't work in that"
"field I'm I'm much more interested I'm"
"less interested in the Venn diagram of"
"the things of living and non-living and"
"much more interested in cognitive so I"
"think that there are many systems that"
"are cognitive but non-living they're uh"
"at this point there are probably no"
"systems that are living in non-cognitive"
but
"um maybe there were uh at the beginning"
"of Life"
"um but yeah I'm much more interested in"
"this in the spectrum of uh of uh of"
"cognition I'm not sure what to say about"
"um whether where the life is is"
"continuous or not"
"what is"
um
"cognitive but non-living look like"
"so so let's let's uh take a step back"
"and uh"
"just think about uh what what I mean by"
"cognitive so"
"when I say cognitive I mean"
"the spectrum of diverse competencies"
"including extremely primitive ones I"
"mean at some point anything has to have"
"kind of a basement but lower lower end"
"uh all all of these competencies to"
"solve specific problems so uh it has"
"there's a couple of ways to think about"
"it one way to think about and this is a"
great
"um line that I wish I could remember who"
"said this but some someone once said"
"it's the difference between two magnets"
"trying to get together and Romeo and"
"Julia trying to get together what the"
"different so what's the difference the"
"difference is in what degree of"
"Competency do you expect in that in that"
"process so the two magnets are basically"
"just minimizing their distance if"
"there's a barrier that you know they're"
"going to stand there you know pressed up"
"against the barrier that's the end"
"you're not you're not going to get an"
"awful lot of it's It's not zero"
"competency they can do something but but"
"it's awfully low whereas from Romeo and"
"Juliet you can expect very sophisticated"
"uh kinds of Behavioral actions in their"
"problem space to try and get their goals"
"accomplished and then everything in"
"between right we have all kinds of"
"systems systems in between"
"so it's the same as that light cone"
"metaphor it's related to that right so"
"so the light cone measures the size of"
"goals you can achieve so so let's just"
"let's just talk about that for a second"
um
"if if the large if if you tell me what"
"the largest goal that you care about is"
"I can basically guess your your"
"intellectual sophistication so if you"
"tell me that all you care about is the"
"local sugar concentration you're"
"probably a bacterium right if you tell"
"me that you're capable of"
"um uh caring about uh what happens uh in"
"the next uh you know a couple of days"
"but you really can't uh you really don't"
"have the cognitive wear with all to care"
"about what happens three months from now"
"in the next town over you might be a dog"
"you might be something at that level"
"right where where you have a degree of"
"concern over a spatiotemporal area that"
"that has a particular radius but let's"
"face it you're never going to care about"
"what's going to happen next year it's"
"just not possible for you to care about"
"what happens next year let's say if you"
"tell me that uh you you your goal is a"
"world peace or something that or the"
"stability of the stock markets across"
"the Earth over the next hundred years"
"I'm going to say you're at least a human"
"and if you tell me that uh you are"
"capable of caring in the linear range"
"about thousands millions or trillions of"
"living beings across the planet I'm"
"gonna say you are something that's"
"beyond current humans because current"
"humans can't do that they don't have the"
"cognitive capacity to care in a linear"
"range about about that many other beings"
"when you say non-linear does that mean"
"it's like one line life is a tragedy a"
"thousand is a statistic like we start to"
"just Clump things together yeah"
"basically right so so human beings"
"simply do the standard modern human"
"beings simply do not have uh the the"
"cognitive capacity to exert to multiply"
"the amount of care that they would uh be"
"able to muster for for one person or a"
"small number of people over to a large"
"uh yeah just as a just as just as an"
example
"um so so the cognitively cone uh"
"measures uh the size of your goals the"
"um what I call the spectrum of"
"persuadability measures the"
"sophistication with which you are able"
"to pursue those goals so you can imagine"
"the Spectrum where on the left are"
"extremely simple things like mechanical"
"clocks in order to change what they do"
"so so in order to change what that does"
"you have to rewire the hardware you're"
"not going to train it you're not going"
"to convince it there's nothing to do"
"except rewire the hardware so you have"
"things like that then you have slightly"
"more interesting things like thermostats"
"so thermostats are cool because they"
"have a set point and they try to"
"maintain that set point and in order to"
"change what they do you don't actually"
"need to rewire the hardware you can"
"leave the hardware in place but you can"
"change the set point and then you may"
"have slightly more sophisticated beings"
"that yeah they have a set point but they"
"also resist it when you mess with their"
"set point so they have this kind of like"
"very weak metacognitive capacity where"
"they know when somebody's trying to"
"change the set point and they fight you"
"on it and so then then of course this is"
"so this is a very dense Spectrum but"
"there are many you know another"
"interesting position is uh creatures"
"that can be trained with rewards and"
"punishments so you can't do that to a"
"thermostat but there are lots of other"
"um kind of reinforcement learning types"
"of agents and living things that you can"
"you can uh train into new behaviors with"
"rewards and punishments and then further"
"to the right on that Spectrum are other"
"beings whose Behavior you can change"
"with uh communication with messages with"
"rational reasons as opposed to causes"
"and so and so this this whole this whole"
"this whole spectrum and so you need to"
"uh you know different different beings"
"land in different places on this on the"
"Spectrum and so to go back to your"
"original question what this cognitive"
"with non-living look like I can I can"
"easily imagine in fact who we already"
"have uh engineered creatures that you"
"wouldn't say are living with this and"
"this is why I'm not particularly"
"interested in living as a distinction uh"
"there are lots of creatures that you"
"probably wouldn't say are living which"
"are somewhere on this is occupy some"
"interesting place on this continue so"
"they can either learn they have goal"
"directed activity maybe they have some"
"of some open-ended ability to set their"
"own goals I mean we're still sort of"
"working up to that in in AI but"
"um yeah there's nothing I don't believe"
"there's anything magical about the"
"protoplasm there's nothing magical about"
"the stuff that we're made of and no"
"doubt in the wide universe there are"
"other cognitive beings that don't look"
"anything like us"
"whether you want to call them living or"
"not I don't know but uh cognition is I"
"think what we ought to be Tracking not"
"not the stuff that we're made of or how"
"we got here"
"this ability to learn is a great bridge"
"back to planaria perhaps we could start"
"talking about some of the history of how"
"how learning and memory has been studied"
"and then and then and then move up to"
"your more recent work"
"yeah um well people have been studying"
"behavior in planaria for well over 100"
"years uh a particular Milestone was in"
um
"uh in the 1960s the late 60s when uh"
"this guy James McConnell uh discovered"
"that you can you can train planaria and"
"then cut off their heads and uh they"
"will regenerate new heads and then show"
"that they now remember the information"
"so so McConnell did some amazing work on"
"on this um he caught a lot of he caught"
"a lot of flack over it lots of people"
"wouldn't believe that that's true we"
"reproduced in 2013 we made an automated"
"device my lab made an automated device"
"that uh took all the human element and"
"the guessing out of it and proved that"
"he was absolutely correct that that they"
"do in fact do that and uh"
"there's a tremendous research program uh"
"going forward that can be done to"
"understand where is the memory how is it"
"stored how"
"is it imprinted onto the newly"
"developing brain you know it's a"
"fascinating there now now it's related"
"to work"
"um that uh was done in the 70s by a"
"bunch of Russian scientists and then"
"more later more work was done later"
"um by uh Douglas Blackiston who actually"
"is a staff scientist here in my in my"
"Center who discovered that through the"
"caterpillar to butterfly or moth"
"transition when the brain is basically"
"taken apart and reassembled in in a new"
"way again information persists so so"
"trained you know the training um"
"persists and so that's just you know"
"amazingly interesting it also raises all"
"kinds of interesting uh sort of"
"cognitive philosophical implications"
"where we often in philosophy one and one"
"they all often tell you to you know"
"imagine what's it like to be a butterfly"
"or what's it like to be a caterpillar"
"well that's a basic question but the"
"more interesting question is yeah what's"
"it like to be a caterpillar changing"
"into a butterfly in real time right so"
"you are actually so it's not just an"
"evolutionary thing it's not just a"
"developmental thing but you are actually"
"an animal whose brain and whose"
"cognitive capacity is told rewired"
"and and changes radically right you you"
"used to really care about leaves and"
"eating leaves and what kind of leaf and"
"and now you don't care about leaves at"
"all you want nectar and now you live in"
"a three-dimensional World instead of the"
"two-dimensional world of a caterpillar"
"it's an amazing journey you know and"
"that seems like a radically more extreme"
"version of the question like how what"
"what makes you the same person over time"
"all of your cells die in a reborn yep"
"yeah that's that's exactly right and so"
"and so some people are interested in uh"
"uh memory as a as a marker of continuity"
"so if you share the same memories then"
"you are the same person right and I mean"
"there's a more basic version of it that"
"all of us went through so so we were all"
"children at one point and then you sort"
"of go through puberty and lots of things"
"change right your body changes your"
"brain changes there are new hormones the"
"things you care about change radically"
"uh and your capacity to have goals and"
"and uh and and various other"
"psychological drives change radically in"
"what way are you the same person so I"
"think the closest that anybody can can"
"and formulate that is as well you have"
"memories right there's a memory identity"
"but that's actually"
"um tricky because one thing you can do"
"in planaria is you can cut them into"
"pieces and a single trained worm with a"
"certain memories can can give rise to 10"
"other worms that all have exactly the"
"same memories and so now where is the"
"individual identity and so so I think"
"much like with everything else this"
"binary question of are you or are you"
"not the same uh the same individual I"
"think that question leads us astray I"
"don't I don't think that's the right I"
"think that's the right question so at"
"some point you lose that ability or or"
"maybe planarians are unique in in having"
"this ability to regenerate"
"um but that that seems like it would be"
"the most adaptive thing you could have"
"to be basically Immortal and able to"
"regenerate yourself so is"
"is it too simple a question to ask why"
"can't other organisms do that"
"um no it's it's a very good question uh"
"some some organisms do it to an extent"
"so salamanders regenerate their limbs"
"their eyes their jaws their spinal cords"
"uh portions of their heart and their"
brain
"um they're not quite like planaria but"
"but very very um regenerative and uh"
"mammals regenerate a little bit so we"
"regenerate our liver deer regenerate"
"their antlers so it really is a very"
"good question as to why"
um
"why why why does why don't doesn't"
"everything have this amazing"
"regenerability why are we not like"
"planaria so I don't know the answer to"
"that I don't think anybody knows the"
"answer to that but"
um
"I could tell I could try to tell a story"
"that that may or may not um"
"be true so imagine that you are a an"
"early mammal you know you're you're kind"
"of a mouse like creature you're running"
"around the forest"
"um something bites your leg off now"
"unlike a salamander a couple of things"
"are different number one is you don't"
"have buoyancy so you're going to try to"
"put your weight on it which means that"
"whatever delicate cells are trying to"
"regenerate at the wound you're going to"
"immediately grind them into the into the"
"forest floor so they're going to get"
"dirty they're going to get infected"
"um you"
"um uh are much better off uh sealing"
"that wound scarring and hoping you"
"survive rather than leaving it open and"
"trying to regenerate another issue is"
"that because you're not aquatic so so"
"with with only one exception that I know"
"of all good regenerators are aquatic and"
"so without that without the the water on"
"the outside on the other side of the"
"wound you really can't run injury"
"currents very well so look at all the"
"bioelectrical signals that are normally"
"important to regenerate you can't run"
"them in dry air and so so that's another"
"reason why that that might be very hard"
"so I think what uh what's happened in"
"mammals in particular is that uh"
"the evolution has sort of uh gone in"
"favor of let's scar let's seal the wound"
"and and do our best that way but then of"
"course there are also species of"
"planaria that don't regenerate very well"
"and they're it's there's a wide variety"
"of different animals that can and can't"
"regenerate it's um yeah it's on it's"
unclear
"why do you think this doesn't apply to"
"brains I mean we we have neuroplasticity"
"uh but in in terms of like if you get a"
"brain lesion you probably won't grow it"
"regrow it that area or regain the"
"function well I don't know if it's"
"anything special about brains the same"
"thing is true of your finger if you lose"
"your finger you're not going to regrow"
"your finger but planaria regrow their"
"brains right yeah with limbs we have"
"this this thing you just talked about"
"where it it can get damaged or infected"
"so maybe it never could fully regrow but"
"you would think that your brain is"
"protected within the confines of your"
"skull so maybe that's like a safe haven"
"to regrow yeah yeah it's a good it's a"
"good question I I don't know it's"
"possible that that this shift to"
"scarring is a an away from regeneration"
"is just Global it's you mean I told a"
"story about limbs but maybe it's hard to"
"do that in specific regions and not"
"others and so maybe you have just"
"everything is like that now in the human"
"body but like I said uh salamanders and"
"planaria regrow"
"plenary regrow their whole brain"
"salamanders can regrow portions of their"
"brain you know I think there's anything"
"specific about the brain that forbids"
"regrowth but there may also be"
"trade-offs evolutionary trade-offs that"
"we don't know also it may be that this"
"is good enough remember that Evolution"
"doesn't optimize for you know your"
"happiness or or for the you know a high"
"quality of life or anything like that it"
"optimizes for biomass so it's good"
"enough if you can survive this way then"
"that's a that's a that's a valid"
solution
"um I I I apologize give me 30 seconds"
"I'll be right back and hopefully um"
"somebody's reading my doorbell hopefully"
"you can"
"and we're back so Mike with our with our"
"last 10 to 15 minutes"
"um let's talk about the future of your"
"research and where you see the field of"
"regenerative medicine and synthetic"
"biology going yeah"
"um so so there's a few things uh one of"
"the things we hope to contribute to is"
"regenerative medicine broadly so the"
"idea is so so we work on some specific"
"things like limb regeneration and birth"
"defect repair and a cancer reprogramming"
"um I think the future of the field"
"is really uh going to parallel what"
"happened in in computer science so so so"
"when I give talks I often show this"
"picture of what programming looked like"
"in the 40s and 50s which is you know you"
"see this person sitting in front of this"
"giant uh kind of uh electronic thing and"
"she's plugging the wires in and out"
"right so so you were programming at the"
"hardware level but"
"um one of the most amazing uh aspects of"
"of computer science that led to this uh"
"Information Technology Revolution is"
"this idea that if your Hardware is good"
"enough and I think biological Hardware"
"is definitely good enough you gain this"
"aspect of reprogrammability meaning that"
"you can you can you can communicate with"
"the device via inputs via stimuli not"
"physical rewiring but and I think I"
"think this is the future of regenerative"
"medicine so so the future of medicine"
"the future medical treatments are going"
"to look more like and and um"
"uh We've we've we've used this phrase in"
"some of our our writing it's going to be"
"look like it's going to look like"
"somatic Psychiatry so the idea is not"
"going to be trying to rewire the"
"hardware at the molecular level it's"
"going to be what stimuli and experiences"
"can you give this collection of cells to"
"convince it to do a or b so so whether"
"in morphological disorders whether in"
"physiological disorders it's going to be"
"more about communicating with the"
"collective intelligence of the cells and"
"try to nudge it into particular uh"
"regions of of the of the um space in"
"which it works and uh as much as"
"possible taking advantage of its native"
"competencies so you don't want"
"micromanagement you want to be resetting"
"goals and taking advantage of its innate"
"intelligence so I I think that's going"
"to be so so tissue training regimes and"
"things like that I think are the future"
"of regenerative medicine so is Gene"
"editing analogous to the hardware"
"editing and then this is something more"
like
"manipulating epigenetics"
"um I'll agree with the first part which"
"is that yeah genome editing changes the"
"hardware so what the genome does is it"
"tells every cell what molecular Hardware"
"it gets to have so it's sort of the"
"equivalent equivalent of saying"
"um this particular type of uh Junction"
"between the elements we're going to"
"change its properties so you can imagine"
"how hard it is to program that way right"
"and so to to to control a complex"
"computational device that way so I think"
"I think uh certain low-hanging fruits"
"single Gene diseases and some things"
"like that will be solved by genome"
"editing but that's it after that it's"
"it's going to very quickly run into a"
"brick wall when uh it's completely"
"unclear how to which genes need to be"
"edited and how to make large scale"
"uh large-scale anatomical changes the"
epigenetics
"I think I think"
"people people have a lot uh people put a"
"lot on epigenetics than I think is"
"warranted so so traditional"
"the modern understanding of epigenetics"
"is things like chromatin modification so"
"functionally all that is is another way"
"to turn genes on and off so there's no"
"more magic to it than that so in the end"
"it's it's still that that aspect of it"
"chromatin modification is still single"
"cell level"
"um kinds of phenotypes by turning genes"
"on and off so I think that's very"
"limited you know there's certain great"
"things you can do with that but but it's"
"not a it's not a"
"um a broad answer"
"um to these things on the other hand"
"the original meaning of epigenetics was"
"anything that's not genetic and so from"
"that perspective yeah there are types of"
"epigenetics for example bioelectrical uh"
"kinds of circuits that are not genetic"
"but they're not what people typically"
"mean when they say epigenetics typically"
"they mean you know sort of Chromatin"
"Remodeling and things like that and that"
"that I don't think is radically"
"different than than the standard genetic"
approaches
"so is this going to be a bottom-up"
"approach where by"
"seeing how like let's say some sort of"
"bioelectric stimulus changes a single"
"type of cell in one organism then you"
"can kind of move up the complexity"
"ladder and hope that it generalizes and"
"then maybe up to humans eventually"
"no I think I think it's I think it's"
"exactly the opposite direction which is"
"that the bioelectric code is not these"
"are not single cell properties so the"
"idea is that uh it's very much like the"
"way electricity is used in let's say"
"neural networks whether artificial or or"
"biological to store memories to"
"implement behavioral repertoires into"
"Implement intelligence and so the idea"
"is going to be to understand how all"
"cells at whatever whether humid or not"
"that doesn't matter these things are"
"extremely highly conserved so and to"
"understand how all cells"
"Implement intelligent uh some degree of"
"Competency in in goal directed behavior"
"in their electrical signaling and learn"
"to read and write those patterns to take"
"advantage of it to to hack into the"
"native uh competencies of the tissue to"
"get uh either either restoration of"
"native patterns or anatomical repair or"
"in fact make new patterns so you know"
"biorobotics synthetic living machines"
"those kinds of things and it's not going"
"to be done bottom up I don't believe"
"it's going to be done bottom up I think"
that
"um the much more interesting and"
"Powerful way to do it his top down is to"
"ask how does the system natively"
"represent information how does it uh"
"store its goals how does it pursue those"
"goals and now what kind of stimuli could"
"we how do we communicate with it"
"literally communicate with it to re"
"um re-re-specify those goals and take"
"advantage of its native competencies"
"so modern neural Nets are can do amazing"
"things but they're kind of a black box"
"like we don't know exactly how they"
"program themselves to get to the outcome"
"do you see the future of synthetic"
"biology kind of similar to that where"
"maybe we can create very complex"
"cognitive machines but we don't know"
"exactly how they're working"
"yeah it's an interesting point uh one of"
"the I forget which one but one of the um"
"maybe it was boar or somebody one of the"
"uh sort of fathers of modern physics had"
"said that everything is understandable"
"but we can't make any assumptions on"
"what understanding actually means"
"meaning that for certain systems"
"understand it might be not not the same"
"as uh which which makes perfect sense to"
"me that I'm not sure why we necessarily"
"expect that the same cognitive tools"
"that we use to understand simple uh"
"simple systems in an everyday World"
"which is where how our cognitive systems"
"evolve right"
"um why those same uh kind of conceptual"
"tools would be suitable to understand"
"every phenomenon in the universe"
"including for example intelligent"
"behavior of networks doesn't seem like"
"that's a requirement at all and so"
"um it may well be that we have to have"
"different uh Notions of what it means to"
"understand certain certain phenomena"
"especially highly emergent phenomena the"
"whole point of strong emergence is that"
"you can understand the behavior of"
"individual subunits in a way that uh"
"there's a there's a discrete uh kind of"
"um uh transition to a new kind of"
"behavior and when you say you understand"
"it all you all what you really mean is"
"that you understand the parts and you"
"can specify what's going to happen and"
"when but that's it and so"
"um I think it's I think it's entirely"
"possible that that's where we end with"
"that there is no understanding to be"
"gained of these of these neural networks"
"in the same way that we understand much"
"much simpler phenomena but but I'm not"
"but I don't know that I don't know that"
"that's true I just think it's a it's a"
"perfectly good possibility that it may"
"not be because of our ignorance it may"
"be fundamentally that they require a"
"different notion of understanding the"
"same thing I mean that that to some"
"extent is true of biological networks"
"too meaning that"
"we we do not uh we we do not have a"
"mature uh science of reading and writing"
"information in and out of the brain so"
"if I were to look at your brain I would"
"have very very limited uh information on"
"what you know and what your goals are"
"and all of that but you know a lot of it"
"you don't know all of it so so internal"
"access privileged access is not perfect"
"by any means we are often uh very much"
"misled about our own abilities and and"
"goals and so on but nevertheless uh you"
"know a lot about what you know and and"
"internally right so there's some kind of"
"there's some kind of interesting magic"
"about uh this kind of system having"
"internal metacognitive access that uh"
"looking at it from the outside we still"
"are not able to do so I you know I I"
"think I think this question of what can"
"we really understand as Outsiders"
"without being the system itself right"
"and so so so so maybe the only way to"
"gain perfect understanding of the"
"cognitive capacities of a network is to"
"be that agent it is this would be that"
"Network it may not be possible to do it"
"from the outside"
"this has been incredibly stimulating"
"Mike thank you so much yeah thank you"
"very much for your time yeah much"
"appreciated thank you"
