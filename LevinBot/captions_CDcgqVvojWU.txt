"good morning okay so moving on to"
"michael levin"
"michael levin is the vanivar bush"
professor
"at the biology department at tufts"
"university and also the director"
"at the allen discovery center at tufts"
"and today he's going to be"
"asking the question can organismal"
"pattern homeostasis"
"suppress cancer welcome michael"
"thank you so much and i want to thank"
"the organizers for having me at this"
"amazing symposium this has been great"
"so um if anybody wants to get in touch"
"with me there are"
"the urls you can do that and so um what"
"i'd like to do first of all"
"is just to thank the people who did most"
"of the work that i'll be talking about"
today
"especially two of my phd students brooke"
"chernet and maria lubikin"
"so the summary of today goes something"
"like this"
"i would like to talk about cancer as a"
"disorder of the computational mechanisms"
"that coordinate cell behaviors into"
"large scale anatomical structures"
"and so then we need to ask well what"
"mechanisms do enable"
"the scale up of single cell activity"
"into large scale order"
"and i'm going to tell you that all cells"
"not only the nervous system communicates"
"as electric networks and these electric"
"networks process information"
"that uh coordinate and enable cellular"
collectives
"to work towards specific organogenesis"
"and away from cancer"
"and so over the last years we've been"
"testing predictions of this view and i'm"
"going to show you data to suggest that"
"cancer can be detected it can be induced"
"and it can be normalized"
"by specific molecular manipulation of"
"electrical signaling"
"that normally enables the cellular"
"cooperation and so most of the work i'm"
"going to show you today"
"is in the frog model although we are now"
"moving towards mammals"
"and all of the publications with the"
"numbers and all of the the details can"
"be seen at this url at the bottom"
"so uh what what we found is that"
"basically like the brain"
"somatic tissues form electrical networks"
"that make decisions"
"what are these decisions these are"
"decisions about anatomy so"
"in our lab we've learned to control this"
"decision making and modulate"
"large-scale growth and form so we can"
"make frogs with extra limbs coming out"
"of their face"
"we can make planaria that regenerate"
"heads belonging to different species of"
planaria
"all without genomic change so you can"
"see immediately the relevance to"
"to evolution here and in fact we can"
"make animals such as these planaria here"
"on the right"
"that have body plants that are not"
"similar to any"
"of the current uh planaria that exist"
"and so we can now target this system of"
"bioelectric control"
"to understand how multicellularity"
"breaks down and how it can be rebooted"
"and i think this has many implications"
for
"cancer medicine so we start off by"
"looking at"
"the fact that cells are extremely"
"competent so this is a single cell"
"creature this is called the lacrimaria"
"and it handles all of its um"
"physiological its behavioral and its"
"morphological needs"
"all at with one cell there's no brain"
"there's no nervous system this one cell"
"does it all and notice that uh all of"
"its activity is purely local"
"it goes where it wants it eats what it"
"wants it is"
"entirely selfish and the self is very"
"small it is a single scale"
"a single cell scale itself so the"
"amazing thing is that"
"these cells have learned over"
"evolutionary time to form collectives"
"that pursue much larger anatomical goals"
"on the scale of a whole"
"large-scale organism these are equally"
"selfish but the self now is much"
"larger and what i mean by that is the"
"fact that"
"cells whether they're they're embryonic"
"or regenerative"
"work together to form very specific"
"anatomical structures look at this"
"cross section through a human torso this"
"is remarkable order"
"and these initial stem cell blastomeres"
"work together to create this"
"now also for some creatures they can do"
"this during adulthood so this salamander"
"that can regenerate its eyes it's"
"its heart its spinal cord its brain and"
"so on"
"when you amputate the limb uh the the"
"cells work together they proliferate"
"very rapidly they don't make tumors they"
"make a perfect salamander limb"
"and then they stop and this is the most"
"amazing part of the whole story is how"
"do they know when to stop"
"and so dna we know specifies proteins"
"where does the actual anatomical spec"
"come from that allows cells to know what"
"to make"
"and when to stop and what happens when"
"this process breaks down and i'm going"
"to argue that's cancer"
"and the question is is it reversible and"
"so uh"
"it's known that there is an inverse"
"relationship between susceptibility to"
cancer
"and regenerative ability and this is"
"kind of kind of odd"
"if you think about cell cycle"
"checkpoints and things like this"
"where animals with already access to"
very
"highly proliferative plastic cells"
"should in fact have more cancer"
"they don't and it's been known for a"
"while that both regenerative"
"and embryonic environments can tame and"
reprogram
"cancer cells that are implanted therein"
"so what we're interested in is"
understanding
"the uh the patterning signals that"
"normally harness"
"cells towards uh some sort of anatomical"
order
"and uh to try to reboot this program"
"and so then we have to ask what are the"
"signals that normally allow this"
"and so there are many of course chemical"
"biomechanical and other signals"
"i'm going to talk specifically about"
bioelectricity
"so people are in the community are now"
waiting
"uh waking up to the fact that ion"
"transporters the channels and pumps"
"are really important in cancer and there"
"are all kinds of"
"data that can be fished out through um"
"bioinformatics but the important thing"
"is that the genes are not the drivers"
"what's important is the computation"
"within cellular networks"
"in these bioelectric states which can"
"occur really on many kinds of protein"
"hardware not"
"tied to any one particular set of genes"
"is what binds cells"
"into a cooperative swarm that underlies"
"healthy morphostasis"
"and so this is a familiar story to"
"neuroscientists we have this in the"
brain
"where uh electrical activity of cells is"
"propagated through a network that's the"
hardware
"and this uh this network underlies a"
"remarkable kind of software which is the"
"information content"
"and goal-directed activity of cognition"
"and so what we found is that actually"
"not just"
"the nervous system but all cells do this"
"so all cells have ion channels"
"most cells have electrical synapses or"
"gap junctions that allow them to"
"communicate with their neighbors and"
"just as you see up here"
"the electrical activity of the zebrafish"
"brain that underlies the"
"the cognition of of that animal what"
"you're seeing in the lower right hand"
corner
"is a a frog embryo reporting all of its"
voltage
"maps as the cells sort out who's going"
"to be left who's going to be right who's"
"going to be head who's going to be tail"
"and so on"
"and so what we do is we use a variety of"
"techniques we use"
"a voltage mapping using these"
"fluorescent reporter dies"
"we do a lot of computational modeling"
"once you know what channels and pumps"
"are expressed you can make a"
"quantitative model about"
"what the voltage dynamics should be like"
"and then we use functional techniques"
"so no applied electrical fields but"
"turning on and off"
"uh specific ion channels in the tissue"
"and manipulating the gap junctional"
paths
"to control what cells talk to what other"
"cells and what the distribution of"
voltage
"is and so it's it's been known for for"
"decades actually that"
"individual cells can be distinguished uh"
"embryonic tumor and highly proliferative"
cells
"have a depolarized resting potential"
"whereas quiescent cells tend to have a"
"high uh"
"a quite a hyperpolarized resting"
"potential but the magic is not in the"
"single cell"
"state the the reason this is important"
"is because of a first step of"
transformation
"is depolarization and the resultant"
"closure of these electrical connections"
"to the surrounding cells"
"making cells def to the global control"
"signals and letting them"
"revert to ancient unicellular cell"
behaviors
"and so um these these bioelectric"
"pre-patterns you can see them here"
"this is one we call the electric face"
"this is what drives"
"the uh the the expression of genes that"
"are required to form the the frog face"
"here's just one map and you can see"
"there's this spot that's where the eye"
"genes are going to come on where the eye"
"is going to form"
"and if we move this electrical state"
"somewhere else for example to"
"the cells that are faded to become gut"
"then as you might expect"
"these gut cells will do exactly what the"
"map says they build an eye they build an"
"eye out of gut cells and you can see"
"that here"
"this is the same technology we are using"
"for our limb regeneration products"
"projects to try to trigger repair of"
"whole amputated limbs"
"so uh so so the first thing we did was"
"to look at um can we detect"
"this early defection from the body plan"
"via the"
"uh the aberrant bioelectrical state of"
"the cells and here are"
"tadpoles that have been injected with"
human
"um human oncogenes of various types of"
"mutations uh k-ras and so on"
"and you can see that even before the"
"tumor becomes morphologically apparent"
"you can see the aberrant bioelectrical"
"state you can see where the tumor is"
"going to be you can see the tumor"
margins
"and we think this is a a great start to"
"a non-invasive"
"uh diagnostic modality for looking at"
for
"pre-cancer and also for looking at tumor"
"margins during surgery"
"now one of the critical things is that"
"this is not just a marker this is a"
driver
"so we can take perfectly normal tadpoles"
"that have not been exposed to any"
"carcinogens there are no oncogenes"
"there's nothing wrong with these"
"and simply by depolarizing a rare"
"population of cells we call them"
"instructor cells"
"what happens is that the melanocytes go"
"completely crazy you can see what's"
"happening here the animal becomes"
"covered in these black melanocytes"
"there are way too many of them they"
"start to crawl this is what it looks"
"like you can see"
"normal melanocytes are small and round"
"and there should be very few of them"
"but they become transformed into these"
"long stringy horrible things that"
"dig into the neural tube they"
"metastasize they they"
"go inside all of the blood vessels this"
"is basically metastatic melanoma"
"but the amazing thing about it is two"
"things number one is that again there is"
"nothing genetically wrong with these"
"tackles this is"
"this is activated purely uh purely"
physiologically
"and the other thing is that this effect"
"is not cell autonomous"
"down here you can see the blue cells are"
"the ones that we depolarized here but"
"the ones that went crazy"
"are these over here at a distance so"
"voltage change"
"in the environment is a physiological"
"switch toward metastatic behavior in the"
"absence of genetic damage"
"and this works at a huge distance all"
"the way across the animal and it"
"actually requires very few cells"
"better yet we can do the opposite and we"
"can suppress this"
"tumorogenesis so these are tadpoles that"
"have been injected with"
"oncogenes that normally cause tumors"
"they're labeled with red fluorescent"
"protein you can see it here"
"the protein is very strongly expressed"
"but there doesn't have to be a tumor"
"if you manage the voltage appropriately"
"because you just force the connection of"
"those cells with their neighbors and"
"they normalize"
"and even though they strongly express"
"their oncogene they will not form tumors"
"this also works at a distance it is not"
"cell autonomous because of the spread of"
"bioelectrical signals through tissues"
"and so finally this is a simple example"
"as we talk about the origin of cancers"
"this is uh you you again in this temple"
"model you can choose between having a"
"tumor or an ectopic eye"
"and the only difference is the amount of"
"sodium so this is this is a"
"physiological switch"
"that uh depending on what what ion"
"channel you use on the level of sodium"
"you can get tumors"
"or you can get eyes and that is because"
"these photoelectric signals"
"are controlling cell cooperation towards"
specific
"structures so i'd like to just end by"
"pointing out that um"
"the genome encodes the hardware but the"
"cellular cooperation towards healthy"
tissue
"is a kind of physiological software that"
"can be controlled by signals provided to"
"the tissue and this does not require"
"genomic rewiring"
"and uh the shift to cancer does not"
"require dna damage"
"and this is i think this is an important"
"metaphor that that what the genome does"
"is encodes"
"the cellular hardware that every cell"
"gets to have these ion channels"
"but then the uh the the tissue forms an"
"excitable medium"
"that can drive all sorts of interesting"
"computational and symmetry breaking"
"behaviors in completely proteomically"
"identical cells you cannot read out this"
"information in dead tissue"
"you cannot read this out from"
"transcriptomics or proteomics"
"it is the physiological software that"
"runs on this"
"on this hardware and that is what is key"
"for cell cooperation we're developing"
"some software tools to help the design"
"of what we call electroceuticals"
"so these are basically ion channel drug"
blends
"designed to affect the bioelectric"
"network in very specific ways"
"and uh and we'll be releasing this for"
"uh for for everybody to to use"
"and anybody who's interested in in the"
"evolutionary aspects of this can look up"
"some of these uh papers that i don't"
"have time to go into the story but"
"basically we have some some thoughts"
"about how uh"
"how the the borders of the shell of the"
"self the agent"
"can grow and shrink during the lifetime"
"of the individual so from single cell"
behavior
"to large-scale organs and there's not"
"simply be a selection in differential"
reproduction
"it can happen in c2 as well and so in"
summary
"i think that cancer could be addressed"
"as a disorder of anatomical homeostasis"
"by a collective agent"
"not of single cell problems"
"bioelectric properties can be used to"
"detect induce and reprogram neoplastic"
"cell behavior there is no one-to-one"
"relationship with any specific"
"genetic information and we think that"
"computation in bioelectric circuits"
"instructs cell behavior and can be"
modified
"with experience with stimuli much like"
"in the brain"
"and now we're producing these"
"pharmacological and optical strategies"
"to try to do this"
"and basically we're seeking"
"collaborations with cancer researchers"
"working in clinically relevant mammalian"
"systems and not only for"
"the kind of biomedical approaches but"
"also just to understand the relationship"
"between the genomic hardware"
"and the plasticity of the biophysical"
"dynamics that"
"set the boundaries of the self and i"
"thank you all for listening"
"michael this is extraordinary um"
"boy i hope everybody watches this one"
"again there was a lot"
"there um we there's some great questions"
"in the question box"
"time uh"
"uh tamara do we have time to take"
"questions right now"
"okay good okay i gotta cut a bunch of"
"uh good ones here right so dennis noble"
"says depolarization as a metastatic"
"medici medicine sorry matastic trigger"
"is amazing do we know which ion channels"
"do this"
"so so we know which ion channels do this"
"in specific cases"
"however the important thing is that it"
"doesn't have to be"
"any one specific channel you can"
"depolarize cells in a wide variety of"
"ways and this is what"
"uh why this phenomenon is not driven by"
"specific genes you cannot you know"
"people people do try to"
"associate uh changes in in ion channel"
"gene expression and in some cases that"
"can give important information"
"but almost any ion channel if you pick"
"the ones that are responsible for"
"setting resting potential you could"
"achieve the same way and we've done it"
"with sodium potassium chloride"
"uh protons even you you name it it"
"doesn't matter it's not the identity of"
the
"channel or even of the ion that causes"
this
"um and barker michael it's been a long"
"time coming but finally the electronic"
"networks by electricity may ultimately"
"be the most important signaling"
mechanism
"has evolution reserved this mechanism"
"for the information"
"that drives the creation of selected"
"functions or"
"for highly complex functions so"
"so i want to be clear about one thing"
"that uh all of this does not happen"
"through bioelectricity alone"
"so i think of course all of the"
"biochemical and biomechanical signals"
"that other people study"
"are really important but i think what"
"evolution did do was discover very early"
"on that bioelectric networks"
"are really good at processing"
"information so"
"so memory distributed decision making"
"representation all of these things are"
"really convenient to do in bioelectric"
"networks and i think harder to do"
"in chemical and biomechanical networks"
"so what we see"
"is that both in development and"
"regeneration and in cancer"
"we see the decisions being made at the"
"bioelectrical level"
"and then propagating downwards and then"
"the implementation machinery is things"
like
"redistribution of morphogens turning on"
"specific genes that are required to"
"build eyes and and various other organs"
"you know"
"emt and so on but we see that that the"
bioelectric
"uh states are a really high level"
"decision making"
"um mechanism which we can exploit for"
"for you know large scale changes to"
anatomy
"uh dennis noble says what michael is"
"saying is comparable"
"to what we have found in heart"
"pacemaking doesn't need genes once the"
"protein complement"
"has been made uh got a question from"
"christian lenhart"
"how does this finding relate to"
"alternative medicine methods that work"
"with complex electrical signals"
"and electromagnetic waves and claim to"
"be able to diagnose and heal"
"cancer and other diseases in their"
preforms
"uh that's i i don't know i think those"
"have to be taken on a case-by-case basis"
"um i you know i'm not going to try to"
"give a blanket sort of ruling on all of"
"that but"
"i will say that this system is not"
"specifically electromagnetic"
"everything that i've told you today is"
"dc static patterns of purely electrical"
potential
"so um things like external you know elf"
"electromagnetic exposure"
"all of that those things do affect"
"living systems"
"but probably not through this system so"
"so by the standing by electrical states"
"are very difficult to manage"
"magnetically uh there are no"
"or in fact with electrodes that's why we"
"use optogenetics and molecular"
pharmacology
"um i think those things you know i'm"
"sure there's a lot of value to some of"
those
"things they probably are not uh in"
"interfacing with this exact system but"
"who knows i think that has to be taken"
"on a case by case basis"
"uh henry hing us are you saying that the"
"software functions"
"as a choice from one of many coded"
"phenotype potential are you saying that"
"uh yeah that's the question that that's"
"that's exactly right so i didn't have"
"time to go into this but basically"
"what we can do is we can the the"
"electric circuits that guide"
morphogenesis
"have a number of stable attractors if"
"you map the state space"
"these attractors correspond to large"
"scale anatomical changes like how many"
"heads you're going to have what do your"
"you know eyes look like things like this"
"we are able to move that system into"
different
"attractors which literally means from"
"the same set of genetically"
"wild type cells with no genomic editing"
"we can cause those same cells"
"to make very different body plans and in"
"fact we have a whole set of"
"um a series of work on synthetic"
"basically synthetic organisms"
"where we can take completely normal"
"cells and get them to build something"
"that looks absolutely nothing like"
"what the standard animal looks like and"
"again there's nothing genetically"
"different about them so yes yes cells"
"can build many many different things"
"this has been fabulous thank you michael"
"i applied to my"
"tamara uh is going to dismiss everyone"
"for the break"
