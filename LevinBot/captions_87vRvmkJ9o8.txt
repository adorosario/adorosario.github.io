"uh welcome everyone uh welcome mike"
"um thank you very much for uh joining us"
"uh just to introduce myself uh my name"
"is uh jan verrezzo i'm a research"
"scientist at"
"a research lab"
"based in prague in the czech republic"
"focusing on"
"building artificial general intelligence"
systems
"and it was founded by marek rosa who"
"also founded a games company"
"that built a game called space engineers"
"whose kind of mantra is the need to"
create
"and together with our friends and"
"colleagues from google research we are"
"organizing a workshop at iclear this"
"year called"
"collective learning across scales from"
"source to societies"
and
"this whole kind of discussion"
"was to get"
"people interested in the workshop in the"
"speakers that will be participating in"
"the workshop and"
"let the audience and let the potential"
"participants and anyone else interested"
"in those topics to kind of learn a"
"little bit more about the topics and"
"about the works of the invited speakers"
and
"one of them is with me here today"
"professor mike levin so welcome"
"thank you so much happy to be here"
"thank you"
"and uh"
um
"i think let's let's start"
so
"in some sense i"
"view your work and apologies if i is"
"represented you can correct me if i'm"
"wrong but in some sense i view it as"
"looking at some"
"form of fundamentals of how"
"elementary elementary biological units"
"communicate among each other"
"in order to give rise to some form of"
"collective or group wise learning and"
behavior
and
"you're doing it at the level that is"
"really exciting to look at because it"
allows
"um essentially to communicate with the"
"biological systems"
"in a kind of high level language that"
"allows you to do things that"
"traditionally in biology were not"
"possible because"
"instead of micromanaging you can"
essentially
"focus on um pinpointing high-level"
"structures or subroutines that would do"
"the work for you"
and
"the way that i understand it it relates"
"to bioelectricity"
"um in some sense or in other words the"
"way that any cells communicate among"
"each other"
so
"my first question relates to this"
bioelectricity
"and essentially"
"would you say that there is some kind of"
"a fundamental process in terms of this"
"bioelectric communication"
"that is shared across all cells in in a"
"living organism"
"and maybe from which neural"
"communication that in machine learning"
"we really focus on"
"maybe too much"
"um that"
"essentially originated in your"
communication
"yeah um i let's let's take one uh small"
"step back and uh you know i just want to"
"point out that um you're absolutely"
"right in terms of our empirical work"
"that's what we do we study uh how how"
"cells uh communicate with each other to"
"scale up into larger larger kinds of uh"
"systems but more broadly uh what i'm"
"interested in is diverse embodiments of"
"mind and intelligence i want to"
"understand how different configurations"
"of physical objects can give rise to"
"things that we recognize as intelligence"
"cognition memory learning preferences"
"and so on and so uh i think that what"
"evolution has done is discovered long"
"before we did that electricity and"
"electrical networks are a really"
"convenient way of doing that but um and"
"i'll talk about the details of that but"
"but i think it's important to say that"
"i don't believe uh in any kind of a"
"privileged substrate for intelligence so"
"i don't think that that bioelectrics is"
"somehow magical in the sense that that's"
"the only way you can get electricity i"
"don't think that neurons brains synapses"
"these kinds of things are uh uniquely in"
"some way"
"required for intelligence i think that"
"intelligence and cognition can be made"
"with with many different substrates now"
"here on earth we have a few good"
"examples most of them do in fact involve"
"bioelectricity but uh you know that's"
"not because i don't think that's because"
"it has to be this way i think uh there"
"are it's a very wide"
uh
"space of of possibilities for how to um"
"how to embody intelligence and uh i"
"think you're you're absolutely right in"
"that uh the what's important about the"
"way that cellular collectives get"
"together to have goals preferences um"
"all of these things that we recognize as"
"high as"
"as cognition above the level of single"
"cells there's nothing really uh"
"specifically neural about it so most of"
the
uh
of
"of of let's say connectionist types of"
"ideas in machine learning and so on"
"they're not really about neurons i mean"
"every cell does the kinds of things that"
"uh the the network models are um are"
"doing so there's nothing actually very"
"very neural specific about it and that's"
"good because it's not even easy to say"
"what a neuron is you know neurons"
"evolved from much more primitive cell"
types
"cells have been using electrical"
"communication to form networks since the"
"time of bacteria and bacterial biofilms"
"it's that old"
"and uh yeah it's it's uh every cell does"
"many of the things that in fact most of"
"the things that neurons do"
"thank you so"
"um would you then if you would then"
"take it even a little bit"
"further down or further away from from"
biology
"do you believe that there is"
"some kind of indication that potentially"
"there is some universal rule or"
mechanism
"that could describe cognition"
"intelligence across"
"many more scales than just the"
"biological ones going from"
"physics all the way to societies and and"
"the universe as a whole"
"yeah well i can say i can say this uh we"
"we've been thinking pretty hard about a"
"way to"
"come up with some invariants you know"
"something that's going to be the same in"
"all cognitive intelligence systems"
"regardless of their implementation right"
"so regardless of what they're made of"
"and regardless of their origin story"
"whether they're evolved engineered or"
"some combination of the two i think this"
"is really important because"
"in the past"
"uh due to the limitations of technology"
"and frankly our imagination in the past"
"it was easy to distinguish in people"
"between between"
"machines and then intelligent living"
"organisms right and people people to"
"this day are writing writing papers how"
"you know living things are not machines"
"and so on and the the thing is that this"
"was this was because in decades and"
"decades past you could look at something"
"and you could sort of you could sort of"
"knock on and if you hear a metallic"
"sound you could conclude that okay this"
"is a machine it came out of a factory"
"it's going to be pretty boring it's not"
"going to you know have any any um"
"the features we associate with living"
"things whereas if you touch it and it's"
"soft and squishy you say okay this is"
"probably evolved we owe it some some"
"ethical um you know consideration and it"
"will do interesting things and so on"
"that that distinction is completely"
"artificial it's not going to survive the"
"next decades now because of evolutionary"
"techniques used in engineering and"
"because of uh chimeric technologies and"
"bioengineering technologies there is"
"absolutely no"
"firm line to be drawn between these"
"things so that means that going forward"
"into the future we really have to"
"establish categories that are deep and"
"and and not not just uh you know because"
"of the limitations of how what what"
"happens to have come out of evolution or"
"we could engineer at the time but really"
"deep and so"
"and so and to to me the most"
"profound uh invariant for all cognitive"
"systems is the ability to pursue goals"
so
"what you can imagine is and this is uh"
"this is something i i i of course i'm"
"not the first person to say this so so"
"weiner and rosenbluth had this nice"
"paper in the late 40s talking about uh"
"the the spectrum of gold directed"
"activity as a marker for cognition so"
"this is an old idea but i've sort of"
"formalized it more biologically in"
"recent recent papers"
"talking about uh this this kind of goal"
"space as"
"for for any system whether it be evolved"
"design natural artificial alien whatever"
"it's going to be you can imagine the"
"spatiotemporal scale of the largest goal"
"it can possibly pursue"
"so this is this this is a kind of it"
"demarcates a kind of um"
"cognitive horizon beyond which the"
"system cannot cannot think so if you're"
"a bacterium the only the only goals you"
"can really pursue they're very small in"
"space and time right they're local let's"
"say local sugar concentration maybe you"
"have a few minutes memory going back"
"maybe a little predictive power going"
"forward but that cone that light cone is"
"really quite small whereas um you know"
"if you're let's say a dog then"
"you might have uh some pretty good"
"memory extending backwards you have"
"pretty good capacity going forwards but"
"your cognitive system isn't is is simply"
"not going to be able to represent and"
"care about states that are going to"
"happen three months from now you know 20"
"miles over it's just not going to happen"
"and when if you're a human you have"
"perhaps enormous scale goals maybe even"
"longer than the human lifespan which"
"leads to interesting psychological"
"issues right we're the first creature"
"that can actually conceive of goals that"
"are guaranteed to be unachievable you"
"know things that take longer than the"
"human lifespan"
"so i think that"
"that kind of uh that kind of strategy of"
"of trying to map out"
"what the shape of the possible the most"
"the biggest goal that a system is able"
"to pursue that's able to be stressed by"
"if that goal isn't met that gives you um"
"shapes in this virtual space of this"
"this virtual goal space that allows us"
"to compare across really diverse systems"
"that uh it doesn't matter what they're"
"made of right so so at that point you"
"are now free to consider all kinds of"
"unusual embodiments for agents you can"
"think of ai's you can think of very"
"small things like molecular networks you"
"can think of societies you can think of"
"um you know a gravitational synapses you"
"can come up with all sorts of"
"interesting things and all of them can"
"be placed somewhere on this kind of"
"diagram next to each other no matter"
"what they're made of"
"okay so that's very interesting and"
"so so you're saying that the goals"
"really and the representation of goals"
"and the space of all the possible goals"
"related to that particular"
"cognitive system that particular"
"intelligence is the one that was the"
"thing that we kind of could focus on in"
"order to describe"
"um intelligent system across scales so"
maybe
"maybe the the next related question to"
"that is"
"kind of related to where do goals come"
"from right so i think just like um"
"in in in"
"machine learning or in ai if you want to"
build
"uh agents that"
"in some sense are open-ended and they're"
"able to"
"develop themselves or"
"in some sense evolve for"
"a very long time ahead"
"how do we actually"
"create such systems that are able to"
"invent their own goals and continue to"
"actually do something useful"
"so um any suggestions on where to"
"look at the for the origins of goals"
"yeah um yeah this is a very profound"
"question and i think we have to be"
"humble about the fact that we can only"
"begin to sketch uh the the answer so i'm"
"certainly not going to claim i have all"
"the answers but"
"but i can i can say a few things uh how"
"how we think of thought about it"
"in in biology the common um the common"
"story is that uh goals like everything"
"else are"
"if if they exist at all according to the"
"standard paradigm are"
"shaped by evolution by selection so"
"there were some particular environments"
"that shaped your ancestors goals and"
"thus they shape your goals right and"
"some of those goals are emergent in the"
"sense that you know we have to"
"understand that the genetics doesn't"
"specify the organism and it doesn't"
"specify uh the behavior of the organism"
"it specifies the micro level hardware"
"that that is available right and then"
"the behavior of that the hardware in"
"terms of physiology and and behavior and"
"learning and so on is what gets selected"
"upon but but so that's the standard"
"story is that they come from selection"
"but i think um in many ways this is this"
"is this story is is highly incomplete"
"and uh lots of people have said this"
"before me but one of the um one of those"
"i'll just give you a recent example of"
"this in our group"
"we uh have been working on this thing"
"called we which we call zenobots and"
"what they are are"
"you taking you take a an early frog"
"embryo and without adding anything to it"
"so no new genes no nano materials"
"nothing like that you simply remove you"
"take off some of the skin cells and you"
"put them in a in a separate environment"
"and what you've done is you've taken"
"away some of the constraints that"
"normally tell those skin cells to have"
"this very boring two-dimensional life on"
"the outside of the embryo keeping out"
"the bacteria and you allow them to sort"
"of reboot their multicellularity and you"
"say okay well what do you want to be re"
"actually without without the constraint"
"of all these other cells what do you"
"want to be"
"and it turns out that these cells"
"they could there's many things they"
"could have done they could have"
"separated and crawled away they could"
"have made a flat monolayer like a tissue"
"like a cell culture they could have died"
"many things they could have done instead"
"what they do is they get together and"
"they make this um this little little"
"creature that is motile so it swims"
"along it has it's completely self"
"self-powered self-motivated it swims"
"along it has all kinds of behaviors it"
"can regenerate"
"uh and um"
"one of the things that it also can do is"
"work uh work if you provide it with"
"loose cells in the medium it basically"
"does what we call kinematic"
"self-replication it's a kind of von"
"neumann style replication where they"
"will go around collect these cells into"
"little piles and those cells become the"
"next generation of xenobots and then"
"they go and do the same thing okay now"
"what's important about that is you say"
"okay where do the goals of the of the"
"frog embryo come from well for millions"
"of years they were selected by the need"
"to be a good frog in a very in a froggy"
"environment and then have high fitness"
"and all of that"
"but now there's never been selection to"
"be a good zenobot there have never been"
"any zenobots and so what this means is"
"that you take you take these cells and"
"within 48 hours"
"they learn to solve this this problem of"
"being a creature with with a new set of"
"new set of components right they don't"
"have the typical things they would"
"normally have in particular they don't"
"have any way of reproducing the way that"
"frogs normally reproduce we've made that"
"impossible in 48 hours they figure out a"
"completely new way to get the job done"
"that as far as i know no other animal on"
"earth does and so"
"what did evolution actually learn when"
"making the frog genome it wasn't just to"
"make a good frog that's clear"
"we don't know what exactly it learned"
"but what i think is clear is that"
"evolution doesn't produce specific"
"solutions to specific environmental"
"problems it produces problem-solving"
"machines that have i mean and i have"
"some thoughts about what what powers"
"that that ability"
"but it produces machines that can solve"
"problems in other spaces which leads to"
"the to the very profound question that"
"you asked which where do the goals of a"
"zenerbot come from um"
"i don't know uh i think that it's clear"
"that that selection is not uh this is"
"not the entire story maybe not even the"
"main story"
"and i can i can sort of speculate on on"
"some things but i think uh the most"
"important things to say is that it's a"
"very profound question that is not"
"explained by advances in genomics um and"
"then things like that"
"okay that's that's"
"it's good to hear that that we have we"
"have a lot of uh a lot of uh potential"
"exploration and interesting research to"
"be done in this in this area and"
"something to that"
"personally interests me and"
"kind of relates to the work that we do"
"at the"
"eye and many other researchers"
and
"in relation to"
"machine learning and artificial"
"intelligence i think the"
"really interesting question there is"
"related to"
"the ability of"
"biological systems to essentially have"
"somehow solved"
"the issues of generalization and"
extrapolation
"we actually try to"
"build collective systems um in"
"our simulations in our agents"
"and exactly as you said rather than"
"evolution or in our case our"
"learning algorithm trying to find"
"particular particular solutions to"
"specific problems or tasks we focused on"
"building or searching for"
"problem-solving machines or learning our"
"algorithms themselves"
but
"many times what happened was that those"
systems
were
"too specific they always in some sense"
"end up converging or ended up"
"getting stuck or being too biased"
"towards what they're trained on"
"so do you have any"
"any indication or understanding about"
"how evolution was able to achieve"
"the discovery of problem-solving"
"machines that"
"allow you to"
"essentially take"
"something like skin cells"
"create a collective"
"out of them that works in completely"
"different configurations uh any in"
"probably relatively"
"different environments than what they"
"were kind of evolved for"
"yeah so uh to i guess i can say two"
"things uh and of course this is very"
"much an open question but the first"
"thing is that uh"
"it's important to realize that"
"uh the only"
um
"the only key deliverable of evolution is"
"is uh making sure that uh its products"
"are observable by by some observer like"
"us in other words evolution doesn't"
"necessarily make more intelligent things"
"or more complex things all we can all we"
"can uh"
"assume that that's going to be the"
"result of of the process of biological"
"evolution is biomass it's going to"
"produce something that sticks around"
"long enough for us to see it whether"
"that be through survival or through a"
"long time or reproduction"
"or um"
"whatever whatever it is that that's"
"really all and so"
"what so so evolution uh"
"is is is interesting because if that's"
"your only constraint is to be propagated"
"long enough for somebody to observe you"
"it means that you're not tied to solving"
"any one particular problem you can pick"
"what problem you're going to to uh to"
"solve so if you're a bacterium"
"and you are"
"in a this is this is a point that chris"
"chris fields made a while back where if"
"you're a bacterium and you're in a um in"
"a concentration of sugar and you'd like"
"to go up the you know you'd like to get"
"more sugar you have a couple of"
"different options you can you can learn"
"to swim and solve this two-dimensional"
"or three-dimensional movement problem or"
"you can change your metabolism and start"
"to metabolize a completely different"
"sugar it doesn't matter right and so so"
"whereas we look at this and we say ah"
"how do you evolve to to you know to to"
"solve a motion problem or whatever life"
"can can simply switch to a different"
"problem space and and right and there's"
"no requirement so so that's so that's"
"one one thing to keep in mind is that by"
"specifying uh"
"individual problem spaces we we"
"constrain in a way that evolution is is"
"not is you know is not constrained by"
"now specifically how i think it what i"
"think allows this is something called"
"something that i call a multi-scale"
"competency architecture it's the fact"
that
"when when we build when we engineer"
"whether it be through software or"
"hardware when we engineer new new agents"
"we typically have one at best two levels"
"of agency because we're working with"
"dumb parts so you're working with with"
"with passive uh parts that you hope to"
"will come together to form something"
"something um you know something"
"intelligent and that requires us as the"
"engineer to to build everything because"
"we you know the we we have to know how"
"to assemble the parts in a particular"
"way to get the outcome that we want this"
"is extremely constraining by in biology"
"biology is always working with active or"
"agential material so at every level the"
"molecular networks the cells the tissues"
"the organs the organisms of swarms every"
"level has its own goals has its own"
"agendas and they're all solving problems"
"in various spaces"
"and the final outcome that you see is"
"the result of coordination and"
"competition within levels and between"
"levels okay so so each level has its own"
goals
"and so i think that that the flexibility"
"the plasticity the robustness that we"
see
"comes from the fact that"
uh
"every every level has uh has has its own"
"goals that on the one hand is always"
"i'll i'll give you a simple i'll give"
"you a simple example from from evolution"
"how that works um if you take a if you"
"take a tadpole"
"and uh you uh you produce you produce a"
"tadpole which we can do where instead of"
"the primary eyes in the head there's an"
"eye on the tail and if you make a tapo"
"like that they can see perfectly well"
"out of those eyes because even though"
"the primordial eye cells are sitting in"
"a weird environment next to muscle"
"instead of next to the brain they'll"
"make us they'll form a perfectly good"
"eye they make us optic nerve the optic"
"nerve might connect to the spinal cord"
"the whole thing the brain for millions"
"of years expected visual data from a"
"particular point in the head but now"
"there's there's information coming onto"
"the spinal cord from some weird patch of"
"tissue on its tail no problem it can it"
"can learn to use that and so that means"
"that the whole thing is incredibly"
"plastic if you can count on your modules"
"on your subroutines to get their jobs"
"done even when you make changes that's"
"very powerful and and why do they work"
"because they can rely on their parts to"
"get their job done when things have"
"changed for them everybody is a"
"every piece of this every module is a"
"goal seeking module and what that means"
"is it tries to get to a certain state"
"despite perturbations and this is true"
"at every level so evolution"
"always has to work with this kind of"
"agential material when you when when"
"evolution makes a change it's not"
"usually micromanaging what happens it's"
"usually having to"
"uh control what the underlying agents"
"are going to do the individual cells are"
"going to do things so"
"you know if you're if you're an embryo"
"it's not just telling cells to make skin"
"it's actually suppressing them from"
"doing other things they would otherwise"
"want to do on their own it's very much"
"you know it's instructive that you"
"you're you are working in a reward space"
"not in a micromanagement space evolution"
"has to work this way too because all the"
"parts always want to do things right"
"it's not if you don't coordinate them"
"they'll go off and do other other stuff"
"and so"
"much like with the xenobots you know"
"when we make these zenobots"
"we do all the cells do all the heavy"
"lifting they make the bots we don't make"
"the bots we all we've done is put them"
"in a new environment but what's amazing"
"is when they reproduce the cells"
"themselves are doing exactly the same"
"thing all they're doing is collecting"
"the other cells into a pile they're not"
"micromanaging what happens next they're"
"taking advantage of the fact that these"
"cells are also agents and that they will"
"do their part and and you know and do"
"what they need to do so that so that"
"that that working with agential"
"materials the fact that um every level"
"of this thing has its own agendas is"
"what provides the robustness and"
"flexibility but also the open-endedness"
"because because uh you know when your"
"parts have their own um you know their"
"own goals uh in many ways it becomes"
"easier but in other ways it becomes"
"harder to control what's going to happen"
next
"yeah that's so so that to me makes um"
"perfect sense because one of the things"
"that we try to investigate for some time"
"is is"
"um essentially compared to the way that"
current
"machine learning models are built rather"
"than having some kind of end-to-end"
"large monolithic system focusing really"
on
"modular and collective systems"
"and what you're saying that if i"
"understood correctly is that"
"one thing is modularity"
"the collective nature and the fact that"
"each of those modules in the system"
"is has some some agency or has some some"
"goal on their own"
"that essentially would be doing"
"something no matter what and"
that
"it would essentially be able to achieve"
"particular states or particular goals"
"despite some some small perturbations so"
"there's some level of robustness and"
"when you put those things together"
"uh you are able to"
"actually make the system um much more"
"much more interesting much more robust"
"and much more open and generative in"
"some sense compared to"
"a single unit with a single goal"
"exactly yeah the high the high levels"
"the higher levels distort the option"
"space for the lower levels and the lower"
"levels are good at navigating those"
"spaces if they avoid local minima a low"
"local maximum things like that but um"
"but but the idea is that all the higher"
"levels can do they never micromanage"
"they they all they can do is is uh"
"motivate reward or"
"or or influence the lower levels towards"
"specific goals but that's all right and"
"then the lower levels get their own"
"thing done or not sometimes you know you"
"get success and sometimes not but um the"
"whole the the whole point of all this is"
"to be able to scale goals and i think"
"also scale stresses so"
um
"individuals so think about you know"
"individual cells have very local cell"
"scale goals metabolic needs uh ph you"
"know things like that very very local"
"things but"
"once you have this modular tote loop"
"right where you test operate and exit"
"you have this you have this this"
"homeostatic loop if it's modular you can"
"plug in different things as what do you"
"measure what do you compare against and"
"what do you do you know think of a"
"simple like the thermostat or simple"
"simple the homeostatic loop you can if"
"things are modular you can plug in all"
"kinds of things into that loop and you"
"can merge when cells are merged when two"
"cells are merged you know you know when"
"they're connected electrically one of"
"the things that means they do is is is"
"uh when they take a measurement of"
"what's going on they take a bigger"
"measurement right instead of a single"
"cell scale now there's a two cell so if"
"you have 100 cells now they're taking a"
"bigger measurement so what that means is"
"along with the iq raise a rise of having"
"multiple cells in the network what that"
"means is that you can now pursue much"
"larger goals whereas individual cells"
"pursue very very humble sort of scalar"
"local goals once you have a large"
network
"that whole loop the gold scale and so"
"now we can pursue things like let's make"
"a finger instead of a single hand you"
"know no no no individual cell knows what"
"a finger is but but the network can know"
and
"the same thing about stress individual"
"cells are motivated in their activity by"
"the stress"
"that results from not being in your"
"correct homeostatic state right so if"
"you're hungry you've got some stress"
"that metabolics are going down you've"
"got to eat and so you know this is a"
"single cell stress"
"but once you're in a network and you can"
"export that stress to other cells you"
"can share that information"
"then the other cells are motivated to"
"act to reduce your stress because you're"
"sharing your stress with them so you're"
"stressing them out even though they"
"don't have a local problem but you have"
"a global problem because your neighbor"
"is now upset and he's stressing you out"
"so so by stress is is part of that glue"
"that binds these collective agents"
together
"because by by scaling the stress"
"you enlarge the cognitive space of the"
"things that you are trying to implement"
"so think about if for any system that"
"you look at"
"tell me what it's stressed by and i"
"could tell you what the cognitive level"
"is if you're stressed about local"
"glucose concentrations and that's it"
"well you're probably a bacterium if"
"you're stressed about the global"
"financial markets and what's going to"
"happen 100 years from now to humanity"
"you're probably a human and if you're"
"stressed by you know how many other"
"creatures have entered a space of you"
"know some 100 meters then you're some"
"kind of mammal that's territorial and"
"what so what are you or or and if you're"
"stressed by the fact that your eye is in"
"the wrong location you're probably a"
"body trying to uh an embryo trying to"
"put its you know body together so this"
"the the scale of the things that you"
"could possibly be stressed by is a great"
"indicator of your in overall"
"intelligence and that that uh that"
"scales you know these electrical"
"networks help you scale your your"
"stresses and thus they scale your goals"
"it's a really interesting viewpoint on"
"that so if you would imagine"
um
"that you would like to"
"essentially give some hints to engineers"
"or machine learning"
researchers
"people who want to essentially engineer"
"either artificial life or some"
"intelligent agents"
"first question is"
"regarding what would you suggest for"
"them to focus on and second"
"related to this notion of stress"
"how would you suggest stress to be"
"essentially encoded in such artificial"
"systems would it be through some"
"air minimization or through some other"
"metric or um thing that you would"
"suggest to people to focus on"
"yeah um and this is you know i i'll give"
"some thoughts obviously i don't have a"
"final answer this is something that"
"we're we're working on in my group too"
"i think the most important piece of all"
"of this is the multi-scale competency"
"idea the fact that every piece i mean"
"you have to bottom out somewhere but"
basically
"every scale in your in your uh every"
"every level in your system has to be a"
"goal-directed agent and it has to have a"
"sense of um"
"this this kind of homeostatic loop of"
"what it is that it's trying to uh"
"minimize and maximize and then the"
"problem boils down to how do we couple"
"the goal states the stresses"
"and the measurements that each"
"individual unit uh takes with the others"
"in its uh in its lateral level right and"
"so so all the way down uh you have to"
"have this and so the bottom level um"
"units have to compete for if we take a"
"cue from biology i don't know if this is"
"essential if this is just how biology"
"happens to happens to do it but but but"
"the example from biology is the lowest"
"level units have to compete for"
"metabolic survival so so in your system"
"you have to have the ability of lower"
"level subunits if they're not doing the"
"right things they're not going to be"
"rewarded by the next higher level"
"they're going to literally die they're"
"going to disappear so so they have to"
"have skin in the game of uh they have"
"their own local goals but because their"
"space is being bent by the system above"
"though they have to be able to uh"
"cooperate towards fulfilling some of the"
"goals of the higher level and of course"
"the higher level has the same problem"
"with its higher level and so on and so"
"so this this is this is how i envision"
"this this multi-scale architecture uh"
"we were working and and i think uh that"
"that's that's the first step whether"
"whether whether something else is going"
"to be essential i'm not sure but i think"
"this will be extremely powerful"
"so in some sense not focusing on"
"potentially one particular metric but"
"looking at"
"the multiple scales all somehow jointly"
"or at the relationship between them"
"with all of the little details that you"
"that you just talked about"
"yeah that's what that's what we're doing"
"at this at this point is we're we're"
"making some of these multi-scale um"
"kinds of simulations"
"looking at"
"different ways to uh to to reward the"
"different ways that each level can"
"reward and punish and incentivize uh and"
"and and uh manipulate the levels uh"
below
to
"uh propagate uh yeah you know in many"
"ways and i mean i i love i love the the"
"field of machine learning because it has"
"really nice um there's a lot of concepts"
"here that even though i think it's it's"
"a very nascent uh stage it's a lot of"
"concepts that are very useful for"
"biology so this idea of um"
"of a credit assignment is really key"
"right because biology is amazing at"
"credit assignment at every level it it"
"seems to pick out exactly what was i"
"doing when the good things happen right"
"it seems to know and so this idea of of"
"of connecting subunits in ways where"
"they are that where the lower levels are"
"rewarded for doing the things that the"
"higher level wants"
"but they're not micromanaged to do it"
"they're rewarded for it so that that"
"that's where that's where all of the"
"interesting search takes place is what"
"are the what are the policies for"
"sharing that"
"for credit assignment first for scaling"
"up the stresses um for connecting the"
"subunits that's that's where where all"
"the exciting progress is going to be i"
think
"this is this is again something that's"
"very much close to our heart because um"
"currently we're essentially struggling"
"with the credit assignment problem in"
"our collective system so we're able to"
"do to to let it do something interesting"
"but when you actually somehow connect it"
"to some external world and uh having it"
"actually interact with the world in in a"
"way where it makes sense and where the"
"right parts of the collective"
"um actually get sufficient feedback"
"that's actually really tricky so so any"
"kind of inspiration or ideas"
"from biology especially if it does"
"uh well"
"that's that's always useful and helpful"
great
um
"and then um another another"
"kind of interesting question or topic is"
"related to"
whether
"we're focusing"
"essentially on the right substrate of"
"building our intelligent agents um"
"whether we should be focusing a little"
"bit more um on"
"not only on the ideas and algorithms"
"that the biology employs to do uh this"
amazing
"uh those amazing things that it does but"
also
"as you kind of repeatedly mentioned"
we
"essentially have this wonderful"
machinery
"and systems available to us and if we"
"look at them and communicate with them"
"in the right way they can do a lot of"
"work for us"
"so whether"
"we should maybe focus a little bit more"
"on actually interacting with the"
"uh or interfacing with the biological"
"systems and use their machinery and"
"their ability to build things in order"
"to actually create our artificial agents"
"yeah i think i think certainly there's a"
"lot of opportunity for really"
"interesting engineering by"
"instrumentizing biology so so um"
"all of the technologies that are coming"
"online uh hybridization technologies"
"brain computer interfaces which does"
"don't have to be brains hybrids um"
"cyborg the types of uh you know"
"biological robotics all of these things"
"that really tightly uh integrate"
"designed components software components"
"and living things at different scales"
"whether they be molecular computing or"
"cellular computing yeah i think i think"
"lots and lots of great engineering is"
"going to come from that and i think it"
"will be very interesting and i mean"
"we're certainly uh involved in in some"
"of those things"
"i think long term the important thing to"
"keep our eye on is and i think engineers"
"do fine with this i think biologists are"
"tend to go astray with it a little more"
"which is that when you do this it isn't"
"because the biology brings you some"
"magic that is unattainable to engineers"
"it's just a temporary uh you know it's"
"it's it's a it's a it's a temporary um"
"expediency that that we use i think"
"that's important because because again"
"by you know there's a lot of biologists"
"who have written things about how living"
"things are fundamentally different from"
"machines and so they build up these"
"binary categories which i think is"
"completely unsupportable given the"
"chimerization i can you know we can make"
"now any combination of living things in"
"quote-unquote machines and it's"
"impossible to to put these things in any"
"kind of a binary category so i think we"
"have to realize there is nothing magical"
"about living things we are ultimately"
"going to be able to someday uh reproduce"
"in our engineered constructs whatever it"
"is that we see living things doing"
"because they are the process of the"
"result of natural processes not not"
"magic but in the meantime but that's"
"going to take a long time and i think"
"and in the meantime i think there's lots"
"to be learned by including existing"
"biological components with our"
"engineering and actually one interesting"
"thing is why is that even possible right"
"why why is it even possible to take"
"living cells"
"and uh"
"and make them live on a uh on on some"
"sort of uh microelectrode array and make"
"the whole thing play pong or play you"
"know or fly a flight simulator why is"
"that even possible biology is incredibly"
"interoperable these cells have to"
"survive in many different environments"
"they can we can make chimeras where"
"human cells live next to drosophila"
"cells and they do fine and we can make"
"we can instrument we can instrumentize"
"them make them live next to um"
"nanomaterials and electrodes and in"
"virtual worlds biology solves this kind"
"of problem all the time there's nothing"
"new for these cells to live in some sort"
"of weird bioreactor than it is to live"
"inside an organism where they solve"
"exactly the same problem who are my"
"neighbors how do i make them do good"
"things for me what are they making me do"
"do i want to do these things or am i"
"better off being you know a cancerous uh"
"selling going trying to go off on my own"
"these are these are uh trade-offs that"
"cells make all the time and they're not"
"at all surprised when we confront them"
"with with weird materials and whatever"
"so i think from that perspective there's"
"tons of good"
"uh biology and engineering to be learned"
"by making these kinds of hybrid"
"constructs we shouldn't pretend that"
"there's some sort of magic that that"
"we're going to be forever barred from if"
"we don't use biology"
"makes sense makes sense"
"okay um"
"then um"
"one one more question which is a little"
bit
maybe
"a little bit more distant from your work"
"but i was wondering uh your thoughts on"
"this as well and that relates to"
"um essentially if we talk about uh the"
"different scales of cognition and"
intelligence
"one of the things that um that we also"
"find fascinating is"
"cultural evolution and kind of its"
"cumulative nature"
"and in one of your work you"
"i think mentioned"
"the focus or the importance of"
"gradualism of the weighted systems"
"gradually kind of"
"build up on each other"
and
"whether you have any views on"
"whether those things are connected"
"whether essentially again it's"
fundamentally
"due to the fact that there is there's"
"some underlying"
[Music]
"whether it's this multi-scale"
"competency idea that essentially"
"translates even the level of uh culture"
and
"the way that essentially we teach our"
"children and"
"the environment around us and so on"
"so any any views yeah"
"yeah well um yeah i think i think the"
"multi-scale competency thing is is"
"really fundamental in that the first"
"thing we need to do is realize that we"
"are very bad at detecting agency to be"
"to be clear we are we are great at"
"detecting a very specific type of agency"
"so so all of our and this is most most"
"um living living things all of our"
"senses point outwards and they measure"
"things in the three-dimensional world so"
"from the time that we're"
"very small babies we see objects moving"
"around and we learn to assign we learn"
"the theory of mind we learn to assign"
"some agency okay this is a bowling ball"
"and all it's going to do is roll down"
"the hill subject to you know laws of"
"physics this thing is a mouse and it's"
"going to do some very very different"
"things that i can't you know predict in"
"the same way i'm better off using"
"rewards and and motivations and other"
"things if i want to manipulate what the"
"animal does"
"all of that is it makes us good at"
"detecting agency in the"
"three-dimensional world but imagine for"
"example if we had"
"senses that looked inwards let's say a"
"biofeedback sense that told you what"
"your pancreas was doing at any point in"
"the day so if you had direct perception"
"of all the things that were happening to"
"your inner organs and what they did as a"
"consequence we would have no problem"
"recognizing intelligence and navigating"
"physiological space you would say wow i"
"see this thing learning the last you"
"know for the last two weeks every day at"
"lunch i you know i ate this particular"
"thing and now it's anticipating it's"
"able to crank up certain enzymes because"
"it knows it's you know that that same"
"thing is coming uh here's how it dealt"
"with a novel poison you know that that"
"was introduced into my system so"
"if we had if we had these other training"
"sets we would be better at recognizing"
"intelligence in weird spaces you know"
"these these other physiological space"
"anatomical space um all these other"
"kinds of spaces"
"so uh what i think we need to do is"
"realize that because because of that i"
"think we need to realize that we are"
"only good with recognizing goal-directed"
"systems in a very narrow range roughly"
"medium size like us roughly the same"
"time scale like us"
"then we are good in the same spaces we"
"are uh very bad at thinking about we"
"don't really practice thinking about um"
"goal directed systems the scale of the"
"whole evolutionary process for example"
"you know a whole lineage"
"do lineages have goals in the sense of"
"not in the magical you know um this and"
"the religious sense but but but but um"
"in the sense of um attractors in this in"
"the space where where"
"even though it's it's noisy it's"
"there are certain regions of the"
"possibility space that it's going to try"
"to get into right or uh if we could zoom"
into
"individual cell activity in during"
"embryogenesis and you see all the noise"
"all the cells running around we would"
"never in a million years be able to"
"predict that oh yeah this is always"
"going to make a fish embryo you know"
"every single time we if you didn't"
"already know what development was you"
"could never tell from from looking at"
"individual cell behaviors so"
"so that means that both above us meaning"
"social levels of you know these kind of"
"structures and below us are meaning your"
"body organs and cells and other things"
"are tons of systems with diverse levels"
"of agency different goal directed"
"activities different uh levels of iq"
"we're blind to most of that and and so"
"so from this the lessons that i take"
"away from this is that"
"number one you cannot tell what the"
"agency uh or intelligence level of a"
"particular system is by philosophy you"
"can't sit there in your armchair and say"
"that can't be you know it doesn't have a"
"brain and thermostats don't have"
"preferences and you you can make these"
"these you know philosophical"
"pronouncements but they mean but they"
"mean nothing but what's important is"
"experiment and asking whether those kind"
"of models are actually"
"what what kind of model along that"
"spectrum is is the most uh effective at"
"predicting and uh controlling what's"
"going to happen so the structures of"
"which we are part so let's say social"
"you know social structures internet of"
"things who knows what else"
"may well have"
"certain degrees of gold directedness"
"that we don't appreciate any more than"
"our cells appreciate the goals that you"
"and i have as as emergent you know"
"humans that come out of these cells so"
"these larger structures may be very"
"primitive and their goals may be almost"
"non-existent or very very minor or they"
"may be quite significant we don't we we"
"can't assume anything we have to be open"
"to the idea of experiments and i'm sure"
"there's some sort of"
"uh you know gerdelian limitation on what"
"we can tell as far as what the systems"
"of which you know i'm sure just like"
"cells can't really conceive of our goals"
"i'm sure there are larger systems that"
"we could be part of where we can even"
"begin to conceive what the goals are but"
"we have to be uh we have to be open to"
"the fact that they may be there and"
"there may be mathematical tools to be"
"developed to say"
"what type of system am i part of and can"
"we say anything statistical about"
"what kinds of goals it might have and"
"then and then and then you know maybe we"
"will have some degree of agency to say i"
"want to be part of that or actually i i"
"defect i don't want to be part of this"
"you know and of course the higher system"
"will see that in the same way that we"
"see cancer right yeah that's great for"
"you but i don't want you to do that i'd"
"much rather you to be sit there sit"
"there as a nice piece of skin and when"
"it's your time to fall off and die"
"whatever i'm on the higher level i don't"
"care so so there will be this right"
"there will be this tension between um"
"the desires and the needs of of us at"
"one level and"
"the levels above us but we have to"
"start developing tools to to at least uh"
"be able to imagine what these structures"
"might be"
"interesting yeah"
"so um"
"related to this um in some sense and"
"maybe a little bit more uh specific"
"question and i hope we still have a"
"little bit more time so if"
"if not then please let me know but um"
"one thing that uh also is interesting to"
"us and it kind of relates to"
"bioelectricity but at the high level uh"
"if you can tell us um"
"about your viewpoint on on um"
"how essentially groups are formed in a"
"collective in such a way that they are"
"beneficial to the"
"collective as a whole"
"and somewhat related there is this um"
um
"in in your work and the way that i"
"understand it um you have this"
"bioelectric code which i view in some"
"sense as some software or some some"
"actual program code that runs"
"um on the hardware"
"uh of the body or the biological system"
"um that um for example encodes a"
"particular morphology right so"
"um where does that particular code come"
from
"yeah um"
"let's let's uh let's talk about the uh"
"let's talk about the code uh"
"for a minute um"
"i one one thing one thing that i i agree"
"with you that and i i speak of this of"
"it this way all the time that that the"
"bioelectric dynamics are a kind of"
"software and i think that uh they share"
"some important properties with what we"
"think of as software people get uh"
"but biologists get get very very upset"
"often about um that kind of terminology"
"because they say look uh there's no"
"step-by-step linear algorithm nobody sat"
"down and wrote an algorithm the cells"
"aren't taking formal instructions off of"
"a stack somewhere to execute this is a"
"terrible young people say this is a"
"terrible analogy but i think i think"
"that uh"
"it's important to first of all"
"generalize the idea that beyond the"
"computers that we're familiar with of"
"course living things aren't the kind of"
"linear computers that we're used to"
"there are there are deeper there are"
"deeper aspects of of uh"
"reprogrammability and so on that are"
"important but the other thing about"
"about um"
"following an algorithm or being a code i"
"think is that it's entirely in the eye"
"of the beholder in other words i don't"
"i'm not sure there's any fact objective"
"fact of the matter about whether"
"something is a code whether something is"
"following an algorithm right versus just"
"being a a dynamical system you know some"
"sort of um uh"
"analog computer all of that is in the"
"eye of the beholder we get we get fooled"
"because we have examples that we made"
"ourselves and so if somebody says hey i"
"wrote the algorithm for this thing and"
"therefore this is a real uh digital"
"computer following uh you know following"
"an algorithm and this thing over here it"
"just looks like physics to me i don't"
"see any algorithm you know i got it from"
"it's evolved or whatever and i think the"
"problem there is that we are we are"
"fooled into thinking that there's an"
"objective answer to this because we're"
"thinking of the very small class of"
"things we made ourselves where we think"
"that we think we know it's an algorithm"
"imagine that"
"we were given some sort of alien"
"artifact right and let's say it's kind"
"of squishy and it's sort of uh you know"
"sort of biological but it's putting out"
"some some some signals and so one person"
"says okay all i see is is physics and"
"chemistry it looks like a like a like a"
"living thing i don't think there's any"
"algorithm here at all and somebody else"
"says no no you don't understand this is"
"a this is a this plays alien chess it's"
"a it's absolutely following an algorithm"
"what if if i interpret the outputs"
"correctly this is a lovely chess game"
"that we can have and"
"th the thing is now now the question is"
"who's who's right because you don't have"
"access to uh whoever whoever made it if"
"you don't know where it comes from and"
uh
"whether or not something is is a kind of"
"software is something we paint onto it"
"as a as a metaphor that helps us"
"understand it so so i'm going to make a"
"simple you know i don't think there's"
"any answer to whether living things"
"really are"
"codes or machines or anything else as an"
"observer in regenerative medicine as an"
"observer trying to understand evolution"
"i think that some of these computational"
"metaphors are extremely useful in"
"pushing this forward i think that's the"
"best we're ever going to be able to say"
"in science that that these metaphors are"
"helpful and if you have a better"
"metaphor by all means bring it out and"
"then we can abandon the older one that's"
"fine but for now these are these are"
"great metaphors so"
"so i think there is there is a code"
"where does it come from so in part it"
"comes from"
"you know in in in every relationship"
"like this of scientist to object there"
"are two players involved right there's"
"the system itself but then there's us so"
"part of this code comes from the"
"observer it comes from us with a"
"particular um"
"the particular"
"understanding of what a mapping is what"
"a code is you know that so so we we"
"bring that to that we bring that"
"ourselves part of it is comes from from"
"evolution and the fact that evolution"
"figured out around the time of bacterial"
"biofilms that"
"voltage-gated current conductances"
"meaning ion channels that are"
"voltage-gated they're transistors and"
"once you have that you can have anything"
"right you can make anything you know but"
"bacteria already you have that and so"
"you can make these amazing um brain-like"
"electrical dynamics in bacterial"
"biofilms that help them coordinate so so"
"part of it comes from that part of it"
"comes from"
"the laws of physics and computation they"
"come from the fact that when you make a"
"machine with a particular"
uh
"set of uh properties you sort of it's a"
"it's i guess it's a it's a you know it's"
"a weird um platonic kind of pythagorean"
"view where i think you you sort of"
"manifest some laws that i don't know"
"where these things hang you know these"
"things live wherever mathematical truths"
"live i don't know where that is but but"
"but you know you get to you get to make"
"logic gates and things that function"
"like like truth tables and so on if you"
"can make a particular kind of machine"
"and it doesn't matter what you know as a"
"basic functionalist idea it doesn't"
"matter what the machine is made of it"
"doesn't have to be biological but"
"evolution certainly discovered that type"
"of dynamic and then you get to use these"
"things so the law"
"the the code rather has things like well"
"if i make a particular electrical"
"circuit then i get to have memory"
"meaning that once the voltages change"
"temporarily i'm just going to keep that"
"new voltage you can make a flip-flop out"
"of that you know very easily or maybe"
"the other way around no i'm extremely"
"stable you know you try to change my"
"voltage i'm going to snap right back as"
"soon as you're done or something else"
"that amplifies small differences or"
"something else that"
"is that solves problems like"
"how many cells are we you know it's a"
"big problem in cellular automata right"
"to figure out like how do you make a"
"rule that counts cells yeah cells solve"
"this all the time they have electrical"
"networks that can count and can say okay"
"we are the right size now stop you know"
"stop whatever you're doing"
"so where do you know where do those laws"
"come from i i don't know the same place"
"that that mathematics comes from i guess"
"but it's very clear that evolution"
"exploits all this stuff by making"
"machines that take advantage of all that"
"yeah i find this really fascinating"
"because um exactly you the way that i"
"view it is or the way that i understand"
"how you describe it in your research is"
that
"yes evolution"
"gives you those those those parts the"
"journeys the hardware and on the"
hardware
"you can"
"or there is some some software or some"
"some essentially code that"
"exists or emerges during the lifetime of"
"the biological system and it has some"
"memory you can somehow augment the"
"change it and you are able to"
"essentially drive the hardware that"
"seemed to have been"
"uh most of the time or during evolution"
"used for a particular software you're"
"able to actually change the software and"
"within bounce you're able to do a lot of"
"different stuff so that's that's"
"uh yeah super interesting to us and um"
"yeah i was wondering uh"
"how is it possible kind of and where"
"where does the actual original code come"
"from and i think you talked a lot about"
"why is it robust in terms of all the"
"multiscale competency and many of the"
"other things so it's super super"
interesting
"okay thank you very much um"
"i have a few lightning questions if you"
"don't mind and those uh"
"are essentially specifically targeted to"
"um to maybe getting people that are"
"maybe a little bit less versed in those"
"in those topics and how um"
"we could kind of interest them coming"
"over and joining the workshop"
"so uh the first question is um"
"if you"
"maybe if you can give some uh example of"
"something that truly uh surprised you in"
"your research"
"boy uh it's hard to pick one we've had"
"we've had many i you know that's why i"
"love this this field i see surprising"
"things all day long but um you know the"
"most recent one is is the xenobot uh"
"replication you know the ability the the"
"the the fact that these uh skin cells"
"liberated from the rest of the animal"
"within 48 hours get together to make a"
"motile creature that figures out how to"
"use uh these agential materials these"
"these other cells as a way to reproduce"
"themselves the same way that we made the"
"actual xenobots just just seeing that"
"knowing that it's never happened uh to"
"our knowledge in the history of"
"of life on earth no other lineage does"
"that and and here to see this appearing"
"in 48 hours in front of our eyes was"
"just uh you know just absolutely"
"stunning to me"
"thank you um and then the next question"
"um what do you think"
"researchers in in machine learning and"
"ai should really"
"focus on when building"
building
"intelligent systems or ultimately maybe"
"trying to get to something"
"like artificial general intelligence"
"and i think you mentioned the"
"multi-scale components idea"
"and and so on so if you would like to"
"pick one"
"and suggest what to right now start"
"focusing on or where to go where to"
"investigate what would you say"
"yeah i think i think uh"
"really a rich source of inspiration is"
"life before brains so so look at all the"
"field of basal cognition uh spend some"
"time looking at uh protozoa there's some"
"there's some great channels on uh on"
"youtube and various live streams that"
"are just a microscope set up over a you"
"know a petri dish of pond water and when"
"you when you see those individual cells"
"doing all the things that they do"
"there's no there's no brain there's no"
"nervous system uh and you just realize"
"how competent each one of them is and"
"ask yourself what would it take to get a"
"few of them to cooperate together on a"
"much larger goal like building a body"
"and we're all we're all bags of of of um"
"coupled amoebas basically and so uh that"
"to me is is the is is the key to the"
"whole thing you know"
thanks
"and then i guess last question um how"
"important and relevant is machine"
"learning for the outcomes of your work"
"in some sense maybe if you would like to"
"attract people to come and talk to you"
"to someone collaborate with you"
"what would you say in terms of how does"
"the field of machine learning ai"
"how does it relate to your work and your"
interests
"um yeah it's it's hugely important we"
"have a few machine learning experts that"
"work in my group we need a lot more um"
"both as a tool to use machine learning"
"to analyze some data that we have but"
"also as an inspiration i mean"
"we are all machines that learn right so"
"we are examples of machine learning what"
"other kinds of machines can learn what"
"are they learning uh what are the um"
"what are the concepts that we even need"
"to uh to begin to uh to to talk about"
"these things beyond the beyond the"
"material uh that they're made of so um"
"yeah absolutely experts in machine"
"learning are extremely important to us"
"so yeah we're open to open to"
"conversations for sure"
"okay thank you so much mike it was uh"
"really really interesting thank you i've"
"learned a lot of interesting things in"
"concept despite reading a lot about your"
work
"uh there were many many points that i"
"kind of learned from so i'm really"
"grateful and happy for that thank you so"
"much yeah thank you so much too and um"
"uh i guess we'll see each other at the"
"workshop and i'm um"
"really looking forward to that and"
"hoping that a lot of interesting people"
"come and join and many more interesting"
"outcomes will"
"come out of it"
