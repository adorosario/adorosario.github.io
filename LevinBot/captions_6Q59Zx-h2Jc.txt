"on this episode of the podcast i discuss"
"a particularly beautiful idea with"
"professor of regenerative biology"
"michael levin from tufts university"
"the idea goes something like this"
"imagine if the blueprint for your body"
"its size its shape the arrangement of"
"all the cells wasn't stored anywhere in"
"your dna"
"in fact imagine there is no blueprint"
"blueprints are necessary when building"
"with passive materials like stone and"
"iron in which case you have to specify"
"where each element goes"
"if instead your building material acts"
"more like cellular automata"
"elements that have their own local"
"agency then you can get fantastic"
"emergent phenomena for free without ever"
"having to lay down any schematic"
"so the idea is that our dna doesn't"
"encode the large scale structure of our"
"bodies but instead the complex behavior"
"of ourselves"
"we emerge from the collective behavior"
"of millions of tiny biological machines"
"ourselves each acting their own"
"individual interests"
"the depth of this idea is that in"
"application it has the potential of"
"curing every known medical condition"
"with the exception of infectious disease"
"michael and his colleagues are learning"
"how to read and overwrite the"
"bioelectric signals used by our cells to"
"communicate with their neighbors and"
"their environment"
"by hijacking this electrical signaling"
"they've been able to create two-headed"
"worms regrow the legs of frogs as well"
"as the eyes and other organs"
"they're now setting their sights towards"
"the possibility of arresting cancers"
"reversing aging and limb regeneration in"
humans
"this is a conversation that ranges from"
"key advances in regenerative medicine to"
"questions about the boundaries of what"
"we call life"
"i hope you enjoy"
"escape sapiens"
"so your work has"
"many different interesting access points"
"that we could start off with in this"
conversation
"i mean we could talk about cancer"
"research we could talk about designing"
"biosynthetic organisms we could talk"
"about regenerating limbs"
"but i decided to start with a question"
"which i think will give sort of a nice"
"general overview of some of what you're"
"doing before we sort of dive into more"
"specific topics"
and
"so the question is one that i've had for"
"a while"
"and and it is if you look at a human"
"brain right there's something like 10 to"
"the 15 different connections"
"whereas if you look at the human genome"
"is something like three billion base"
"pairs so just off off the bat it seems"
"like there's not enough space in the"
"genome to encode all the information you"
"need to encode about the human"
"connectome all right all the different"
"connections between the various cells"
"and then not only that but as you go"
"through your life your brain actually"
"changes you you form your connections"
"and so on"
and
"so the question uh sort of in just"
"general view is you know what is it that"
"sets the structure uh in a human brain"
"if this information isn't encoded in the"
genome
"where is this information encoded and"
"sort of how is it uh encoded"
"yeah um so let's let's take a step back"
and
"just uh"
"talk about the fact of uh what what"
"exactly is in the genome so so the the"
"important thing is that now we can read"
"genomes so we know what's in there and"
"of course genomes don't directly say"
"anything about the structure of your"
"body the shape the symmetry type the"
size
"never mind the the precise structure of"
"your brain what's in the genome is"
"information about proteins it's"
"information about proteins that every"
"cell gets to have so the the lowest"
"level molecular hardware of each cell"
so
"be long before you get to the question"
"of where are the specific"
"connectomes specified we have to realize"
"that looking at a genome we can't even"
"tell what kind of organism we're looking"
"at now you can cheat and compare it to"
"other genomes where you do know what the"
"organism is but but you know it's"
"important because people all the time"
"people say"
"you know i you know it's one thing for"
"the genome you know to encode the body"
"plane but bioelectricity how does"
"bioelectricity encode and i say take a"
"step back the genome does not encode"
"directly of course it does not encode"
"the body plane"
"so uh let me give you what i think is a"
"useful way to think about this right um"
"the way that the way that i think about"
this
is
that
"when you when you make certain kinds of"
machines
"those machines can harness various"
"interesting laws of physics and laws of"
"computation and once you"
"do that you get a lot of things for free"
"just as a really stupid example if you"
"you have a triangle and if you evolve"
"two angles of that triangle you don't"
"need to evolve the third one you know"
"what it is right that's so that's that's"
"a that's a free gift from physics you"
"don't have to evolve all three angles so"
"so here's a better here's a better uh"
"gift from physics if you evolve"
"something that acts like a transistor"
"you can make logic gates and you can"
"make feedback loops and you can make"
"things that reason"
"and we know how awesome transistors are"
"if you evolve something that's sticky"
"you can harness all the laws of of"
"adhesion such as you know when you have"
"balls of differential adhesion and you"
"sort of shake them together the core"
"will end up being the sticky ones"
"outside you will have you know it's kind"
"of a bullseye you'll get kind of like"
"this bullseye effect you don't have to"
"evolve that all you have to evolve is"
"the stickiness the rest you get for free"
"so so what i'm going to say is what the"
"genome does is it encodes and we can"
"talk you know we should talk about this"
"the genome encodes a machine that has"
"amazing properties"
"but that's all the genome encodes it"
"encodes the the initial structure of"
"that machine which is a cell"
"that machine when it uh"
"proliferates and joins with other such"
"machines so you get a multicellular"
"creature of some sort"
"it can harness some really important"
"aspects of physics and computation and"
"we can talk about what those are but it"
"isn't because it was in the genome it's"
"because the genome creates machines that"
"solve problems and they do various they"
"do all kinds of interesting things and i"
"say this um there's a couple of good um"
"illustrations that you can think about"
"here for example there's two that i like"
"that i talk about with my students one"
"is do you know you ever seen what a um"
"what a what a galton board is"
"no oh wait is this these ones where the"
"balls float yeah yeah exactly exactly"
"it's a it's a piece of wood vertical"
"like this you knock a bunch of nails"
"into it and you take a bucket of of of"
"metal marbles and you and you toss them"
"into the top and they bounce around they"
"bounce around and sauce the cat stick"
"and then you get this beautiful bell"
"curve and now somebody could come along"
"and say where is the shape of that bell"
"curve encoded this is an amazing example"
"of morphogenesis where is that you know"
"they say i think it's i think it's in"
"the wood i'm going to study the wood and"
"somebody else says you know what i think"
"it's in the distribution of the nails or"
"the material of the nails of course it's"
"it's not in any of those things what"
"you've done is you've created a"
"machine which is a boundary condition on"
"the laws of of the universe and"
"something amazing comes out which is"
"this particular shape the same thing if"
"you make a um"
"if we make an and gate out of a few"
"transistors you make an and gate and i"
"show you the law of the truth table of"
"the sand gate you say oh man that is"
"amazing wait wait wait where's the"
"encoding of this truth table where is it"
"written down well it's not written down"
"anywhere it's got to be in one of these"
"transistors and so"
"we have to wrap our minds around that"
"that the question of where does it come"
from
"the answer to that question is usually"
"not because it's explicitly you know"
"sort of written down somewhere we have"
"to be comfortable with these machines"
"pulling these"
"these things down from"
"wherever it is that truths of"
"mathematics come from i have no idea"
"where these things with you know some"
"sort of platonic space somewhere but but"
"that's where yeah anyway that's that's"
"what i think"
"so sort of like um"
"so the image i i sort of form in my mind"
"is sort of like a flock of birds where"
"you have you know each individual bird"
"has a very simple set of rules about how"
"far it stays away from its nearest"
"neighbor and then if you look at the"
"dynamics of the full flock you get this"
"amazing dynamic emergent flocking"
"behavior and so the idea is if i"
"understand you correctly"
"that in the body uh we also have this"
"emergent behavior but the mediating sort"
"of the emergence is mediated by sort of"
"voltages between cells rather than"
"distances between wing tips and if i"
"understand correctly"
"what's amazing about what you're doing"
"is not just that you can read those"
"voltages but that you can feed those"
"new voltages back into the system and"
"change the the morphology or the or the"
"behavior of the"
"the emergent large scale uh animal"
"is that is that a good way of looking at"
"things it's it's not bad uh absolutely"
"yeah we can and we can talk about the"
"specifics of it as far as the"
"bioelectricity i'm sort of at the up"
"until now i've been talking in pretty"
"general terms just about the idea that"
"if if you see if if cells were passive"
"materials like legos their cells were"
"like legos then the genome would"
"literally have to have a description of"
"the final product because you would have"
"to say where every lego goes and the"
"genome doesn't have that and it doesn't"
"need to have that because cells are not"
"passive materials now"
"they're not even just active materials"
"and they're not even just computational"
"materials they go one step further"
"they're what i call agential materials"
"meaning they're themselves they have"
"agendas they have various things that"
"they try to do in terms of optimizing"
"and so on and so when you have a"
"material like this you don't manage the"
"you don't micromanage the position of"
"the material you control the stimuli the"
"fat the the various signals that these"
"things are going to give to each other"
"and some other boundary conditions and"
"then you sort of let them do their thing"
"it's guided self-assembly and that's how"
we
"who work in and some other people who"
"work in synthetic morphology that's how"
"we do it and that's how evolution"
"actually does it as well"
"so is is the"
"behavior and the abilities of our cells"
"is that sort of coming from the fact"
"that we had we came"
"way down the line from single cell"
"organisms and so we've retained this"
"ability on individual cells and that"
"sort of"
those
"those are the rules that uh govern the"
"large scale structure that's that's"
"exactly right i mean we are we are"
"walking uh"
"uh collections of of uh loose"
"confederacies where where these cells"
"are you know they still have have very"
"much um ability to do their own"
"autonomous thing as we see during cancer"
"as we see during uh various kinds of"
other
"chimeric experiments we have to uh"
"everything that evolution does to a"
"multicellular organism is done in the"
"context of having to manage"
"these competencies in in these cells"
"it's the difference between building a"
"tower out of bricks and building a tower"
"out of cats if you want to make a tower"
"out of cats you're going to have to be"
"uh researching a completely different"
"space you're going to be searching a"
"space of rewards of of incentives uh"
"right of of things that they that that"
"your sub units actually care about if"
"you're working with bricks"
"there's good news and bad news the good"
"news is you don't have to worry about"
"what the bricks want you can rely on"
"them they're pretty much all they're"
"going to do is obey the laws of gravity"
"and you can rely on them to pretty much"
"stay bricks and that's it and right and"
"so but then you have to micromanage then"
"you have to know where every brick goes"
"if you want to build something out of"
"out of agential materials"
"you have lots of other possibilities but"
"you're also going to get surprises and"
"you're also going to be"
"subject occasionally to defections so"
"that's cancer that's basically there's"
"going to be a breakdown of this kind of"
"order and something's going to go off on"
"its own and i've given another talk"
"somewhere called um why robots don't get"
"cancer and this and this is this is why"
"because when you only have one level of"
"of of of building going on then you have"
"no no no concern of with with defections"
"from that plan"
so
"i wasn't planning on speaking about"
"cancer this early in the in the uh"
"discussion but"
"since you brought it up"
why
"why is there anything other than cancer"
"i mean if we originally came from"
"single-celled organisms they would"
"prefer they would like to themselves to"
"survive not their neighbors so so why"
"how did we get to a point where we had"
"any sort of organization at all"
"yeah yeah i think i think i think that's"
"that's exactly the right uh the right"
"question is is not why we have cancers"
"why is there anything other than cancer"
"that's exactly right"
"and uh you know there are many stories"
"about multicellularity and why cells"
"learn to cooperate i'll give you i'll"
"give you my favorite story but it's not"
"the only and by the way"
"you know multicellularity has been"
"evolution discovered it multiple times i"
"forget the exact number but it's it's"
"you know something like 40 or more times"
so
"so there is probably isn't just one"
"story about why this works but i'll tell"
"you what i think is an interesting one"
"and this was developed by um chris"
"fields and i"
"uh a few a few years ago and it's called"
"the the imperial theory of"
"multicellularity and it works like this"
"imagine that uh"
"every every agent in this in this case"
"every cell we're starting off with cells"
"every cell has a fundamental drive the"
"fundamental drive is to minimize error"
"prediction error so this is like the"
"fristonian sort of active inference kind"
"of paradigm where you are receiving some"
"sort of inputs you have internal"
"expectations about what should happen"
"next and your goal is to drive that"
"error as low as you can so that you're"
"rarely surprised it makes sense because"
"if you're surprised all the time by"
"things that go on you're probably not"
"going to survive very long right"
"so so now you're in this environment"
"there's all kinds of things happening in"
"this environment some of them more"
"predictable than others but what's the"
"what's the most predictable thing around"
"well it's you so you you yourself are"
"the most predictable thing for you so it"
"would be nice if you could surround"
"yourself with copies of yourself so that"
"you right you see where this is going so"
"that you wouldn't be surprised so much"
"so if you're a single cell a winning"
"strategy is you know i'm going to um"
"divide and when i divide instead of"
"letting my daughter sell sort of float"
"off and and and we all take uh take our"
"our you know take our chances in the"
"weird wide world what we're going to do"
"is i'm going to let's say addict that"
"cell by some"
"goodies that i make let's say"
"neurotransmitters or something and let's"
"keep that cell nearby and let's i'm"
"going to surround myself so that inside"
"uh my environment is quite predictable"
"because i'm basically surrounded by"
"copies of myself now the cells on the"
"outside of course are front line"
"infantry they're they're they have to uh"
"they have to deal with the outside world"
"and so now you get this this interesting"
"idea where there's the stem cell and the"
"stem cell inside has a niche and the"
"niche is protecting it and what the stem"
"cell is going to try to do is prevent"
"all of those from reproducing because it"
"wants to be the stem cell and the rest"
"will be the soma of the body and they're"
"disposable and they have to face the"
"world and do their best but it's sort of"
"hid and so and so that is kind of the"
"start of"
"multicellularity already right that that"
"that drive for predictability and that"
"that that drive for error minimization"
"is one one thing you can you can see"
"that would that would certainly uh uh"
"facilitate the the the um"
"ability of multicellularity to arise"
"but then so how does differentiation"
"like cell differentiation happen because"
you
"now you want something in order to have"
"complex behavior i suppose you want"
"different types of cells you want skin"
"cells and muscle cells and so on so how"
"does that emerge in your picture"
um
"following this pathway i mean the and"
"that that that particular aspect of it"
"isn't something that i've spent a ton of"
"time uh you know studying actually but"
um
"i think it's pretty"
uh
"reasonable to think that"
"you know inside of every cell is a set"
"of biochemical and biophysical processes"
"that are"
"fundamentally equivalent to to like like"
"a neural network right um this is this"
"idea that there's a controller inside"
"and the controller can have all kinds of"
"complexities it even single cells can"
"have some some memory they have some"
"prediction power going forward there's"
"some some complex controllers and you"
"can easily imagine that you can that"
"controller can have rules like with a"
"certain history of inputs"
"i'm going to take actions x y z but if"
"my inputs are different i'm going to"
"take actions abc and those actions can"
"be specializations and so now you can"
"say okay if i've received such and such"
"a stimulus i'm going to become skin if i"
"haven't i'm going to become you know"
"muscle or whatever you know whatever"
"it's going to be so i think i think"
"that's what that that's that's what"
happens
"i suppose and the bottom line is though"
"that you if you look at"
"sort of a cell culture you'll see these"
"cells interacting with each other and"
"they'll be voltages between the cells"
"and between the inside of the cells and"
"the outside and that's so"
"in your work you're able to somehow read"
"uh this voltage pattern and that's what"
"you're looking at in your research so"
"right so so okay so let's get to let's"
"get to the voltage stuff so"
"if you ask the question you have a"
"collection of cells and"
"what what the the the evolutionary"
"pressure is for that collection of cells"
"to be able to do a few things it has to"
"uh you want it to have memory right and"
"because that helps you get around in the"
world
"he wanted to be able to measure"
"large things in other words uh you"
"wanted to um let's let's let's start off"
"with the idea that that every every cell"
"is a homeostatic unit yeah and so so the"
"homeostatic loop has three components"
"you take a measurement of something"
"let's say it's hunger level or ph or"
"metabolics or something you take a"
"measurement you compare it with a memory"
"of you of a set point meaning what"
"should it be and then depending on that"
"delta you take an action so those are"
"the three points right there's there's"
"there's the measurement the memory and"
"the action and and so you as a single"
"cell you sort of whirl around in those"
"um cybernetic little little circles"
"managing your your your internal of"
"your various aspects of the chemistry of"
"your body right well if you want to be"
"more complex and and do more interesting"
"things one architecture that would let"
"you do that is if you could scale that"
"goal directed activity and so this is"
"the there's a paper"
"that i wrote where i argued that the way"
"to think about all intelligences no"
"matter what they're made of biological"
"exobiological artificial synthetic"
"robotic with the matter in order to"
"think about all of these intelligences"
"on the same playing field the one thing"
"they have in common no matter what"
"they're made of no matter where they"
"came from evolved designed whatever the"
"one thing they all have in common is the"
"ability to pursue goals and the way you"
"can classify them is by the scale of"
"their goals so if you're if the biggest"
"spatial temporally if the and actually i"
"you know when you draw this it looks"
"like it looks like a minkowski cone"
"actually when you when you draw these"
"things out because you can collapse the"
"space and you have to worry about like"
"how big are these goals if you're if the"
"biggest goal you can work towards is"
"maximizing your glucose level you're"
"probably a bacteria"
"if the biggest goal you can you can work"
"towards is the creation of a limb"
"then you're probably a collection of"
"cells not a single cell single cells"
"can't count fingers they don't know how"
"big a hand is i don't know what a hand"
"is but a collection of cells absolutely"
"does and we can talk about morphogenesis"
"as a homeostatic process and then if"
"you're really an advanced creature you"
"your goals might be something like world"
"peace or it might be something like"
"getting off the planet in 100 years or"
"whatever it's going to be so you're"
"literally by the by the scale of your"
"goals you can tell what the cognitive"
"sophistication of the of the subunit is"
"so what i think drives the increase of"
"complexity in life"
"is this idea that"
"when you have those homeostatic loops"
"you can scale up the cognitive capacity"
"of that creature by scaling those three"
"things it's i see you first you want to"
"scale what do i measure i don't really"
"want to just measure my local"
"concentration of anything at a"
"particular point i want to be able to"
"measure large things like i want to be"
"able to think about whether my arm is"
"the right size and so you want to you"
"want to share information with your"
"neighbors so you can measure really big"
"things then you want memory i don't just"
"want to remember what my what the local"
"gradient was 20 minutes ago the way"
"bacteria do i want to remember patterns"
"like i want to remember what a proper"
"hand looks like what a proper eye looks"
"like so then you need more computational"
"capacity you need a network of cells"
"instead of one cell"
"i want to take action i don't just want"
"to act locally in one cell i want to be"
"able to act large large scale like for"
"example bend the whole tissue into a"
"sheet or have traction forces that make"
"tubes or whatever"
so
"now so now what we're saying is that"
"evolution is basically looking for a"
"system that can scale all that up"
"and if it's not sounding like the brain"
"yet it should be because these are right"
"this is exactly the kind of stuff that"
"neural networks do in the brain"
"they integrate information so that you"
"can store large memories that belong to"
"the system not to any individual cell"
"you can you can integrate measurements"
"across large distances so so not just"
"local but you can integrate different"
"senses and everything else and you can"
"you in and all of this allows you to"
"have goals that are fairly grandiose"
"they don't belong to any individual cell"
"where did the brain learn this trick"
"right the brain learned this from"
"evolution discovered this kind of thing"
"around the time of bacterial biofilms"
"it's incredibly ancient around the time"
"of bacteria it already figured out that"
that
"electrical networks are a great way to"
"store memories to to process information"
"and to make larger"
"uh cybernetic constructs that whose"
"goals scale higher and higher so that's"
"why we're interested in bioelectrics not"
"not not because it's it's it's magical"
"um in in some way just because it is an"
"amazing system for scaling cognition"
"that's why i'm interested in it and"
"not to say that some at some point we"
"won't discover some other creature out"
"in the you know in a cosmic cloud"
"somewhere that you know that operates in"
"a completely different way but here on"
"earth bioelectricity is what evolution"
"uses to scale intelligence"
"i like the the image because i guess you"
"can also scale that up and talk about"
"societies and does it go back in does"
"the continuum go how far does it go back"
"in the other direction"
"to atoms"
"that's a great that's a great question"
"uh but bioelectricity itself"
"may not go too far down although even"
"organelles inside of cells have their"
"own electrical potential so you know the"
"nucleus the the golgi the er all those"
"things have electrical potentials"
"certainly the mitochondria but but aside"
"from that the the kind of the deeper"
"question is"
"if if we think that cognition scales"
"is there a zero how far down does it go"
"and we just had in fact just an hour ago"
"i was part of a a live stream with with"
um
"some folks including uh chris chris"
"fields and"
"uh um"
"and uh and and and other people that uh"
"we were we were really really talking"
"carl fursten and some others and we were"
"really talking about this issue of that"
"we have a model bo carl has the model"
"and chris has a model in there and"
"they're compatible about basically all"
"the way and and i'm not gonna i'm gonna"
"butcher the physics i'm not even gonna"
"try but i do encourage you to have carl"
"and and chris on to talk about this but"
"but the bottom line is that there's a"
"way to look at all this stuff to um"
"basically turn the whole thing on its"
"head and to say that"
"physical objects that that don't have"
"any cognition are extremely rare that"
"basically the the the the common"
"situation is not zero it's very it's a"
"low level it's very basal and but what"
"biology does is scale the hell out of it"
"and into familiar things that we see but"
"but i'm not sure yeah i don't believe"
"that there's in in this world anyway i"
"don't believe that there's much of a"
"zero i think um and you and you can and"
"you can tell because even"
"even uh if you ask yourself okay"
"what does"
"well you have to do two things first of"
"all you have to assume that all these"
"things we're talking about cognition"
"intelligence sentience whatever we're"
"talking about it's not binary right i"
"think the biggest problems come and all"
"kinds of unsolvable pseudo problems come"
"when people say it's binary it's either"
"you know you're either just physics i"
"mean i hate that phrase but people say"
"it's just physics and then some people"
"say and then they say well this thing is"
"of course truly you know cognitive and"
"they mean themselves and maybe some some"
"apes and maybe some dolphins and so"
"then that that is and we can talk about"
"that if you want that that's a"
"completely uh dead-end way to think"
"about it uh for for reasons of biology"
"but um"
"if once you once you under once you"
"accept that that it's a that it's a"
"continuum uh then you can ask yourself"
"what is the most basic"
"uh what is the absolute most basic"
"version of some kind of cognition like"
"what is the what is the very end of that"
"spectrum should look like and and"
"one of the things that that has to be"
"there is some degree of goal"
"directedness and again not to not to you"
"know dive into the to the physics too"
"much which you get you know i don't"
"fully uh"
"i don't fully own anyway but the one can"
"easily look at least action principles"
"as a way to"
"say that this is the most basic form of"
"cognition and of course people are going"
"to say well look you know it's a rock it"
"falls down the gravity well that's not"
"advanced cognition right it's not"
"advanced cognition you have to be clear"
"nobody's claiming that that rocks have"
"hopes and dreams like we do about"
"getting down to the bottom of an energy"
"well but you have to ask yourself what"
"does the most basic version of my"
"goal directed activity and also"
"my goldfish's electric activity"
"goal-directed activity and also a"
"thermostat's goal directed activity"
"what's the most basic version of that"
"look like and i think if you have to"
"formulate what the simplest you know"
"sort of sort of a minimal version of"
"that it would look exactly like least"
"action laws"
"so so what's the minimizing principle"
"then that takes you from you know what"
"is it that drives towards intelligence"
"and more complex uh what what is that um"
"mechanism i think i think it's i think"
"it's surprise minimization i think it's"
"all about prediction error i think in"
"the fristonian sense uh i think i think"
"it's about uh systems that and this is"
"what life does life couples metabolism"
"with information processing it makes"
"sense because you information processing"
"is costly you have to pay for it and"
"what you end up with are systems that"
persist
"meaning that they can continue to"
"operate as coherent systems to the"
"extent that they can make uh uh better"
"than than average guesses about what's"
"going to happen next and i think i think"
"it's all about uh it's all about uh"
"prediction and as soon as you have say i"
"don't have a story about the origin of"
"life right so i don't work on that lots"
"of other people do um i don't have i"
"don't have a story about that but my"
"story begins the minute you have the"
"most minimal basic system that is able"
"to do homeostasis it's not a full cell"
"it's a you know it's going to be an"
"extremely simple thing but it's able to"
"do homeostasis it survives because when"
"environment changes it takes actions to"
"get back into the goldilocks zone of"
"whatever whatever it's doing right"
"probably some simple chemical reaction"
"and as soon as you have that the race is"
"on after that because now"
"the more complexities you pile onto that"
"so how far back can i remember how far"
"forward can i anticipate how complex of"
"a pattern can i can i hold on to what is"
um
"what's my ability to avoid local maxima"
"and navigate that space a little more"
"competently than just roll down you know"
"roll down the local of the local hill uh"
"as soon as all of those things become"
"become drives that that propel"
intelligence
"so so once you've"
"once you understand this sort of"
"emergence these emergent properties"
"what does that allow you to do so so"
"what are you able to do now in the lab"
that
"you know if i just had the idea that"
"everything is dna"
"and that's just how i view things"
"what can you do"
"experimentally in in terms of"
"applications that someone who has sort"
"of just the dna"
"old view can't do yeah yeah that's"
"that's a that's a great question i i"
"spent uh lots of time on this issue"
"because my um my view on this and the"
"the paper actually just came out this"
"morning um this this giant uh thing uh i"
"call it tame t-a-m-e technological"
"approach to mind everywhere and the"
"reason that i emphasize the first word"
"is technological because i don't want"
"these things to be philosophy these"
"things to the whatever extent they're"
"useful they have to drive new research"
"they have to suggest experiments that"
"you wouldn't have otherwise done and and"
"this has been this has paid off great"
"for us i mean we've done tons of things"
"that have never been done before"
"precisely because we have this weird"
"weird outlook on things i'll i'll run"
"some of these things down for you but"
"the the fundamental like one fundamental"
"class of all these things has to do with"
"level of control"
so
"if you think about it and neuroscience"
"is really good about this because"
"neuroscience every people who work in"
"neuroscience most of them anyway"
"have an understanding that there are"
"multiple valid levels so you might be"
"working on"
"the shape of a neurotransmitter receptor"
"or you might be working on plasticity in"
"a in a neural circuit or you might be"
"working on pattern memory and you know"
"edge detection in the retina or you"
"might be working as a psychiatrist and"
"you might be uh dealing with people's"
"anxieties about you know how they view"
"themselves in society right so so there"
"are there are levels of attack and"
"certain problems are better handled by"
"fixing a certain receptor in their you"
"know innocent in synapse"
"those are those those kind of approaches"
"are unlikely to"
"uh to help someone who for example has a"
"existential doubts about the meaning of"
"of life and you know doesn't know what"
"to do with themselves"
"it it could be a chemical imbalance but"
"it often is a rational problem not a"
"chemical problem right and so the same"
"exact thing is true in molecular biology"
"many people"
"in in the field and in fact the main um"
"paradigm nowadays in molecular medicine"
"is considered to be reductionist it's"
"not really reductionist because if you"
"say to people well then you probably"
"want to talk about quantum foam they"
"don't they want to talk about"
"biochemistry so so so it's not really"
"reductions but they found a level that"
"that they appreciate that's the chemical"
"level and the idea is that everything"
"should be cashed out in these in these"
"chemical terms"
"the the limitation of that is this it's"
"the same limitation of uh taking the"
"lowest level view"
"in fields like neuroscience like uh"
"computer science"
"uh like like other other fields you know"
"when we when we work with a computer"
"we don't"
"ma try to manage it by by seeing by"
"controlling where the electrons go and"
"shaping the uh the the the copper right"
"you you you operate you write code at a"
"higher level you you treat this thing as"
"a completely different type of device"
"and that allows you to do incredible"
"things that in theory if you were you"
"know laplace's demon maybe you could pro"
"maybe you could get everything done by"
"pushing electrons around but that's of"
"course you're losing the you know you're"
"losing the whole point of this thing"
"right and similarly um"
"if uh you know if there was a if there"
"was a chess game going on sure you could"
"take the approach that i'm just going to"
"track where all the the atoms are and"
"i'm going to i'm going to right that's"
"the level at which i'm going to look at"
"this you could do that but you would"
"miss everything there is about what the"
"game of chess actually is you would know"
"nothing about"
"these various goals that go on you know"
"protect the king dominate the center all"
"the stuff that goes on you would you"
"would be none the wiser about it and and"
"by the way you'd be here until the sun"
"burns out trying to try to um you know"
"make predictions about what's actually"
"going to happen next"
"the same thing happens in molecular"
"biology if you"
"think that all of uh all of life"
"basically has the agency of a wind-up"
"clock meaning that the body the cells"
"the tissues they don't have their their"
"age i mean people will say it zero but"
"but on my scheme it would be something"
"like like you know minimal let's say you"
"know some sort of simple machine"
"then you've only got one way to make"
"changes that is you're going to be uh"
"down at the level of the hardware the"
"way we used to program in the 40s and"
"50s where you you know if you sat in"
"front of a computer you would have to be"
"literally plugging wires in and out"
"right to get it to do something you all"
"of molecular medicine is about uh the"
"hardware so genome editing crispr right"
"uh protein uh design um pathways"
"rewiring pathways"
"the problem is that for"
"because because uh there's such a"
"complex uh piece of physiological"
"software that sits between the genome"
"and the anatomy it's incredibly"
"difficult to know what to do at this"
"lower level to fix system level problems"
"it's an inverse problem it's a horrible"
"inverse problem it's a little bit like"
"if you had um you know if you've ever"
"seen uh fractals right these really"
"complex pictures they come from a simple"
"formula right you know z cubed minus"
"seven z plus i makes this incredible"
"like thing and you look at that you go"
"wow that's got three giant curlicues you"
"know what i want i want four curlicues"
"what should my formula be good luck with"
"that because because that inverse"
"problem is uh is incredibly hard"
"the same thing here so if you know"
"beyond kind of some low hanging fruit of"
"single gene diseases and things like"
"that if you want a different hand or you"
"want to repair a hand or you want to"
"make an eye or something like this"
"what genes are you going to manipulate"
"how are you going to control all of the"
"different um"
"all the different cells that have to"
"that have to be involved it's it's"
"incredibly um"
"difficult uh to do all of this from the"
"bottom up wouldn't it be nice if you"
"could do the same thing that we do in"
"neuroscience here's what here's how we"
"do this in neuroscience um ten thousand"
"years ago if you were uh if you had a"
"dog or some sort of farm animal and you"
"wanted it to do something"
"we didn't know any neuroscience you"
"didn't have a prayer in hell of going in"
"and manipulating all the ion you know"
"all the neurons to get the thing to walk"
"along and pull the plow and do"
"everything you know everything it's"
"supposed to do and it's possible in"
"theory it's possible but but you didn't"
"have to do that you trained it"
"right and that's it and it would do what"
"you want now why why was that possible"
"that shortcut that's an amazing shortcut"
"why is that possible it's possible"
"because you recognize that what you're"
"dealing with is not a wind-up clock it's"
"got a certain level of agency where it"
"actually has is actually um"
"has preferences which means you can use"
"rewards and punishments and that it has"
"memory and it has certain goals that"
"it's trying to meet and now you"
"manipulate that which is a much easier"
"space to deal with and you don't need to"
"know what's between its ears really to"
"do that i mean it helps in some cases"
"but you don't really need to so"
"so here's so here's what we do in in in"
"in by in biology and biomedicine"
we
"say we we start with the assumption that"
"you cannot just by sitting in your arm"
"chair you cannot assume that all of"
"these things these these embryos organs"
"tissues you can't sit there and assume"
"that they are like the wind-up clocks"
"you can't make that assumption you need"
"to do experiments you do experiments"
"which means trying different engineering"
"strategies that target higher levels"
"some of those will fail and then you"
"might conclude that well maybe those"
"levels aren't there okay and some of"
"them will succeed and you'll say ah i've"
"discovered that actually there is a"
"perspective on the system that uh takes"
"advantage of the agency so i'll just"
"give you some some simple simple"
examples
"here's one example um"
"you have a flatware you have a flatworm"
"a planarian and flatworms typically have"
"one head and one tail and when you the"
"the amazing thing about one of many"
"amazing things about these flatworms is"
that
"they regenerate and so if you cut them"
"into pieces every piece"
"regrows exactly what's missing and you"
"get lots of perfect little worms in fact"
"they're immortal they because of that"
"they don't they don't age they don't"
"have a lifespan limit so"
"um yeah amazing so okay so you got this"
"flatworm you you cut off the head and"
"the tail you've got this middle fragment"
"and then you ask the question okay how"
"does the system know"
"what to what to grow and and more and"
"more importantly how does it know when"
"to stop because the amazing thing about"
"it is the cells grow really rapidly at"
"the wound site they start to grow they"
"grow they they move around they change"
"you know they change uh the gene"
"expression they do all this stuff"
"and then they make a perfect little head"
"and tail and then they stop then the"
"whole thing stops and so now why does it"
"stop well nobody no no you know the in"
"the original um kind of paradigm we"
"actually had no idea how they stop and"
"if you're a computer scientist you say"
"well there's a representation it's it's"
"a it's a um a means"
"analysis it basically it's got a target"
"pattern that it's trying to hit and then"
"it measures the error and when it's when"
"the error is acceptably low then it"
"stops right"
"now that's that's something that uh"
"biologists hate that kind of model"
because
"that that kind of model sounds like uh"
"that goal directedness sounds scary it"
"sounds like somebody is positing some"
"sort of high level cognition here"
and
"when and and which of course isn't true"
"you don't need to it's ever since the"
"40s we've had cybernetics has given us a"
"science of"
"simple machines that have goals we don't"
"you don't need magic anymore you don't"
"have to be like a like an advanced"
"metacognitive uh you know kind of uh"
"self-reflective human to to have goals"
"your thermostat has goals right that you"
"know it's no longer magical but um"
"what biology likes in general is feed"
"forward emergence so what it likes is to"
discover
"simple rules and when every all the"
"agents in parallel it's kind of like a"
"bird example when they when they execute"
"those rules out comes something amazing"
"so an embryonic development what they"
"would say is the dna dry"
"it's basically a cellular automaton"
"system the the dna determines the local"
"rules all the cells execute the rules"
"and the rules are such that eventually"
"you turn that crank long enough by"
"emergence you get this frog or fish or"
"whatever whatever you get that's that's"
"fine but that doesn't work very well uh"
"and we can go through some examples"
"which which i always you know sort of"
"show off in my talks there are some"
"amazing examples that show that it isn't"
"just a feed forward process if you try"
"to intervene and there's some amazing"
"things you can do to intervene that the"
"system basically takes care of"
"you start to realize that uh you can't"
"get there with a with a simple feed"
"forward scheme there's got to be these"
"goal feedbacks it's very clear that that"
"there are these homeostatic laws now"
"what's interesting is the homeostasis"
"isn't for simple scalars like like"
"pressure or ph or metabolic or whatever"
"the homeos the set point for that"
"homeostatic process is some sort of"
"shape it's a coarse grained description"
"of like you're supposed to have five"
"fingers and then we're going to keep"
"regrowing them if you don't have five"
"we're going to keep regrowing like that"
"kind of thing so"
"so so that's a pretty that's a pretty"
"ski that's a pretty uh un uh unwelcome"
"model for the standard by uh you know"
"it's kind of biological perspective uh"
"but it but the prediction the standard"
"view makes is that the changes you"
"should be able to make are changes that"
"you have to be able to figure out how"
"the mapping from the genes to the"
"anatomy works and you have to make"
"changes to the genome and then the"
"anatomy will follow that's that's that's"
"the only thing open to you on the basis"
"of this the standard way of looking at"
"it so we said okay let's take seriously"
"this idea that it actually is a"
"homeostatic process which means it"
represents
"its target state and and you might you"
"know and then and then the natural"
"question is you're telling me this thing"
"remembers what it's supposed to look"
"like that's you know that's too advanced"
"i'm saying it doesn't know that it"
"remembers it's not a human level of"
"cognition but like your thermostat it"
"has a biophysical encoding of the"
"correct state and then the thing is well"
"once you've said something like that"
"we've got to find it so now so now here"
"we go if you believe that something is a"
thermostat
"you have to do a couple things you have"
"to be able to"
"figure out where and how the"
"representation is stored you have to"
"learn to decode it so what physical"
"properties of the representation map"
"onto whatever you're trying to control"
"so size and shape and then you have to"
"learn to rewrite it so what we basically"
"and and so and so to look at all of"
"these things we we said okay how are"
"these things going to be stored and"
"there might be many different systems we"
"just we just deal with the one uh we"
"said well let's take some i mean this"
"was my my kind of idea for for for a"
"long really long time"
"if you the one"
"positive uh control that we have the one"
"example where this definitely works"
"uncontroversially is in the brain we"
"know we have goals we know we can"
"minimize error you know we"
"we all we all have that experience so"
"brains can do this how do brains do it"
"well they do it via electrical networks"
and
"did brains invent electrical networks no"
"they've been around forever so what if"
"what if uh the ancient system was tissue"
storing
"uh pattern memories of what they're"
"supposed to be"
"and what the brain did was simply pivot"
"that whole system from solving problems"
"in amorphous space right in anatomical"
"configuration space into behavioral"
"space so when when muscles and brains"
"showed up it turned out that you know"
"what we can take all those same tricks"
"that the collective intelligence of the"
"body used to solve patterning problems"
"and we can just use them to move the"
"body through three-dimensional space and"
"we can run around and you know chase"
"each other and then so on"
"so uh so that's that's what we said we"
"and and we started we developed the"
"first tools to"
"read and write the basically what what"
"what neuroscientists do in neural"
"decoding to start to read the electrical"
"signals now"
"by electrical signals outside the brain"
"a little bit different they're not"
"spiking they're slow and they're more"
"spatially distributed than they are"
"temporally you know it's not a spike"
"coating as far as we know"
"so we developed these voltage-sensitive"
"fluorescent dyes that allowed us to look"
"at these voltage patterns"
and
"we were able to see that wow uh before"
"all the genes turn on to do things like"
"determine uh downstream uh size and"
"shape and how many heads and where do"
"your eyes go where your limbs go before"
"all that genetic activity there was an"
"electric circuit that made those"
decisions
"and uh and stored the electrical pattern"
"corresponding to what's going to happen"
next
"could i stop you just for a second"
"you're talking about looking at an"
"embryo right so you're looking you've"
"dyed an embryo and then you're looking"
"at patterns emerging before the"
"development of the animals correct this"
"is circumstance correct although it"
"doesn't have to be an embryo it could be"
"an adult you know the flatworms are"
"adults when you cut them um you could"
"look in adult regeneration context so"
"you take a you take a frog and uh you"
"know and amputate one of the legs and"
"you can look at the electrical signals"
"that are going to be guiding what"
"happens next so it doesn't have to be an"
"embryo but it's a whole animal we"
"develop those tools where you don't have"
"to electrophysiologically impale every"
"cell you can just look at the whole"
"thing and we have videos you know time"
"lapse videos are very beautiful of all"
"this of all this electrical activity"
"but so um"
"you can you can go in and you can hijack"
"these signals right and then you so you"
"can get for example two-headed flat"
"worms and all sorts of different weird"
"and wonderful uh creatures so in"
practice
"how do you do that hijacking so you have"
"dies to see what this electrical"
patterning
"inside an embryo or some other creature"
"look like but"
"how do you in practice make that change"
"do you"
"do you put a voltage across the animal"
"or do you immerse it in some chemical or"
"what's what do you do yeah um so so the"
"first step is to know what are you"
"trying to do because you have to decode"
"the pattern a little bit because you"
"have to decide what do i want so if i"
"look at where there's this pattern"
"that's called the electric face and it"
"basically shows you where the eyes the"
"jaws where everything is going to go the"
"mouth where everything is going to go"
"right and you say okay you know what i'd"
"like to do i'd like to have an eye on"
"the gut instead of in the or in addition"
"to the one in the face and so you see"
"this electrical pattern that's"
"responsible for starting an eye and you"
"say i would like to"
"reproduce that somewhere else let's say"
"on the back of the animal and you can't"
"do it by applying electrical fields"
"although for hundreds of years actually"
"now people have done certain things with"
"applied electrical fields but nothing"
"like like what we've done because"
"electrodes are just not a great way to"
"make complex standing resting potential"
"gradients this is not a great tool for"
"that so you can't use there are no waves"
"there are no magnetics there's no"
"applied electrical fields it's nothing"
"like that what you do is exactly what"
"you do is you steal all of the tools"
"from neuroscience and the cool thing is"
"which tells you something interesting"
"that the tools of neuroscience do not"
"distinguish at all between neural and"
"non-neural cells without any distinction"
"we make is all in our heads we come up"
"with that the tools the tools can't tell"
"the difference so we do all the things"
"that neurosciences do so which which"
means
"we can in order to change that"
"bioelectrical pattern you can uh open"
"and close channels and you can do that"
"with drugs so pharmacology you can do it"
"with light if you have optogenetic"
"channels you can do it with light masks"
"so you can express channel rhodopsin in"
your
"in your cells and then lay down a light"
"mask to turn some of them on and off"
"right we can control"
"the topology of the network by"
"controlling the the gap junctions the"
"electrical synapses between cells so we"
"can open them we can close them same"
"deal we can do it with drugs we can"
"mutate the connection proteins we can"
"put in new channels new proteins new"
"connexin proteins it's all about"
"targeting the native system that the"
"cells are using to establish whatever"
pattern
"they have and you and what we do is we"
"develop computational models that try to"
"tell us what to what bioelectric"
"stimulus to provide meaning which"
"channels to open or close to get a"
"particular outcome so we've made okay so"
"so you know we can control the number of"
"heads on the flatworm we've shown that"
"actually that uh without touching all of"
"this without touching the genomes we"
"never edit the genome so there's a stock"
"hardware absolutely wild-type stock"
"hardware and we and by manipulating the"
"electrical software what you can do is"
"you can get it to permanently for"
"example become two-headed meaning in the"
"future if you keep cutting it they'll"
"still be two-headed and so the question"
"of what determines the number of heads"
"in the planarian is really tricky"
"people will say dna not quite what the"
"dna makes is a machine that by default"
"defaults to an electrical pattern that"
"says one head but doesn't have to you"
"can change that and you can do other"
things
"we've um we've we've induced eyes you"
"know in other places of the animal we've"
"caused uh animals that don't regenerate"
"their limbs to regenerate their limbs"
"we've normalized tumors we've corrected"
"very complex"
"birth defects of the brain and all of"
"this can be done not because we know how"
"to micromanage the construction of all"
"these organs we don't it's because we"
"found a high level"
"set of a set of hooks into the native"
"physiological software literally"
"subroutine calls where we can say the"
"bioelectric pattern we put in by miss"
"expressing some ion channel in the tail"
"says build a tail here"
"downstream of that signal everything"
"else will turn on all the genes that"
"everybody knows you know the master i"
"genes that will build a tail all that"
"stuff everything will get turned on but"
"the decision is made by an electrical"
"circuit that says well where do we put"
"the eye and you can say well here this"
"is where you put the eye"
"but then so what's the difference"
"between what's the difference between"
"the two-headed and the three and four"
"and so on what what is the change that"
"you make there if it's subtle the change"
"the changes uh there's a there's a"
"bioelectric pattern"
"that you can see that encodes"
"what the outcome is going to be it's a"
"little bit like think about what happens"
"in the brain in the brain when you do"
"neural decoding you take a reading of"
"the brain activity and you run it"
"through some sort of deconvolution"
"software and you say ah that person is"
"thinking about a picture of a gorilla"
"not a picture of a you know a chair"
"right you there's a mapping between the"
"electrical now the mapping is really"
"complicated it's not straightforward you"
"don't you don't open up the person's"
"head and actually see"
"pictures of of chairs and things"
"although in terms of navigating mazes"
"you can find you know sort of sort of"
"place cells and things like that but um"
"there's a mapping and we call this"
"cracking the bioelectric code exactly"
"the way the neuroscientists are tracking"
"to trying to crack the the neural um uh"
encoding
"there's a mapping between what the"
"pattern is and what's going to happen"
"and we we now know what that is in"
"four or five cases so we certainly"
"haven't cracked it in general that's you"
"know the biggest area of research right"
"now but we know in a few cases what to"
"look for and how to make specific"
"changes if you want to move the eyes the"
"mouth the heart the limbs the brain uh"
"we can we know how to do that now"
"okay so it's not that you have sort of"
"like an equation and you know all the"
"stable solutions of that equation it's"
"just through trial and error you have"
"been able to create certain stable"
"configurations of these flatworms can i"
"ask sorry it was just well just uh just"
"to to comment on that it's not trial and"
"error so when we started know this was"
"20 years ago when we started it was very"
"much um a screening process where we"
"would have to map that whole we didn't"
"have the equation so we had to map the"
"whole space so we would just do we would"
"we would put tissue in different"
"bioelectrical pattern states and see"
"what happens we started to map out the"
space
now
"for a number of these cases we actually"
"have the equations so we know so for"
"example when we fix brain defects in"
"tadpoles that's because we have an"
"actual equation that describes the"
electric
"the electrical distribution in the brain"
"and we can ask that model questions like"
"hey if it's if if there's a birth defect"
"incipient meaning that if it's if the"
"system has been exposed to alcohol"
"nicotine you know some sort of mutated"
"like notch mutations whatever and the"
"pattern's wrong you can actually you can"
"actually say to the model what would it"
"take to knock us back into the correct"
"attractor and and right so so so it's"
"it's it's important to understand that"
"this is no longer i mean in new systems"
"that we haven't done this for it it is a"
"little bit of poking around but but this"
"is not a random search by any means we"
"we have a simulator right we have a"
"bioelectric simulator that will tell you"
"what the stable points are and uh for at"
"least for some you know for for some"
"model systems"
"so when you talk about stable points one"
"thing i was curious about is okay so"
"when i was looking at some of the work"
"you're doing you take what you call"
"these picasso tadpoles so you you edit"
"these tadpoles so that the eyes are all"
"over the place and the mouth and all the"
different
"features of the face"
"in places where they shouldn't be and as"
"the tadpole develops those eyes and and"
"those features go back to where they"
"should be"
"whereas you have this other"
"case of the planetarium where so you"
"have these two-headed worms you can uh"
"you know"
"alter the"
"bioelectric um let's say mapping or"
"blueprint so that when you cut them in"
"half they form two-headed worms and"
"that's stable through the generations"
"you'll get generation after generation"
"after generation um"
"you know the two-headed worms my"
"question is"
"why was it the case with the picasso"
"tadpole that you went back to what you"
"expect you know"
"what you should have whereas the"
"changes you make to the planarian worm"
"uh are stable do you understand the"
"difference between you know"
"why one solution is a stable attractor"
"and why the others are not yeah"
"there are lots of open questions there"
"so we don't understand everything about"
"it but i can tell you what we do"
understand
"the thing the thing about the tadpole is"
"that when it fixes itself it's"
"undergoing metamorphosis it's going from"
"a tadpole to a frog and so i think what"
"happens there is that the pattern"
"the the target morphology basically gets"
"reset at a by the creature at a certain"
"because because if it didn't get reset"
"you would never become a frog you would"
"stay you would achieve error zero of a"
"tadpole and you would just sit there"
"which actually we can do i mean we can"
"do that too but but but if you but if"
"you don't do that and you get these"
"monstrous tadpoles that are that are"
"just huge and they never become frogs"
"but um but if you don't do that i think"
"what happens is and this is the part we"
"don't understand all the way uh"
"at a certain point in development the"
"target morphology gets rewritten by a"
"new one that basically it's a"
"regenerative process it basically turns"
"on the remodeling that says"
"you're completely wrong that you're not"
"what a frog looks like and oh man now i"
"gotta now i gotta reduce error again and"
"everything starts moving around and and"
"the the cool thing about that is once"
"you've reset"
"the set point it doesn't matter where"
"you're starting from right when you when"
"when your thermostat needs to go to 70"
"doesn't matter if it's going up or going"
"down it knows how to get to the set"
"point from wherever and it'll keep doing"
"it right that's the beauty of this"
"system so that's what happens when you"
"can scramble it but when when the the"
"the new target morphology comes along it"
"says well i don't care what you were"
"before in fact"
"the interesting thing is that compared"
"to that new target morphology"
"the tadpole the normal tadpole is just"
"as wrong no nobody cares right"
"you know if your eye was this far back"
"or that far back the point is it's not"
"right for a frog so everything has to"
"start everything starts to try to"
"minimize that error so so that all gets"
"reshuffled the planarian works on a"
"slightly different principle which is"
that
"uh if the anatomy matches what the"
"bioelectric uh pattern is then life is"
"good there's nothing to change into it's"
"all good and and then just it's got this"
"amazing property of it's"
"not well actually there's another twist"
"to this so so it's got this amazing"
"ability to you change the pattern it"
"keeps it just it just holds on to it and"
"that's it now now here's another thing"
"you can do with planaria you know"
"talking about these stable points"
"i can i can take and this was actually"
"an undergrad in my lab who discovered"
"this you actually take a planarian with"
"a um uh with a particular shape head"
"let's say a triangular head you cut off"
"the head you cut off the tail you take"
"that middle fragment"
"and you"
"put it in"
"a solution of a gap junction blocker so"
"you basically"
"uh you basically decouple all the cells"
"from each other and you do that for"
"about 48 hours so all the so the"
"bioelectric pattern goes you know goes"
"all the heck it gets all balconized"
"where where like there's no big um uh"
"regions of anything anymore because all"
"the cells are are disconnected from each"
"other right"
"so um"
"so you do that and then you pull it then"
"you pull them out of the drug and you"
"let them go back to normal and and the"
"electric circuit finds it's it's it"
"states again"
and
"the amazing thing is that"
"it it doesn't always find the correct"
"one in fact about eight percent of the"
"time it finds the correct one and it"
"makes the right triangular head guess"
"what it does the other percent of the"
"time it makes it grows heads belonging"
"to other species of worms same genome"
"nothing wrong with the hardware"
"you know the genome is completely normal"
"except that the electric circuit got"
"knocked into a completely different"
"stable point"
uh
"and then they make the head shapes the"
"brain shapes the distribution of stem"
"cells become like other species between"
"100 and 150 million years evolutionary"
"distance with the same genome"
"so that tells you many things it tells"
"you that actually the hardware is"
"capable of uh"
"you know by default it always finds that"
"it's very very reliable it always finds"
"the right attractor but we've learned to"
"perturb it and then it finds other"
"attractors in the state space of that"
"circuit that evolution happens to be"
"using for other species at the moment"
"now one interesting thing about this"
"which we do not understand yet at all is"
that
"you make one of these planarians in"
"about eight"
"days it makes ahead of the wrong species"
"and then it finishes growth and then it"
"sits there"
"sits there for about three to four weeks"
"being this other species then three to"
"four weeks something bizarre kicks in"
"that we do not understand and it goes"
"back to normal and then remodels back to"
"back to a triangular shape so in that"
"respect it is a little bit like the frog"
"but but but the difference is in"
"planaria we don't know you know in the"
"frogs we know what it is metamorphosis"
"turns on in the planarian we don't know"
"what that is we don't know why what"
"process takes three weeks you know it's"
"gotta have a clock right it's gotta have"
"some clock that's something is measuring"
"these three weeks i have no idea what"
"can measure three weeks in the tissue"
"so so for some reason it sits there"
"perfectly happy we know it's it's the"
"tissue's happy because because they stop"
"remodeling when they make these other"
"heads and everything stops but but for"
"some reason three weeks later it"
"suddenly realizes that oh man this is"
"the wrong attractor and it goes back to"
"and it goes back to normal we don't"
"understand why that happens"
"how many times have you done this like"
"is it always exactly is it always within"
"a day or"
"how precise are you there um no no it's"
"it's not within a day it's uh you know"
"when you do it to a cohort of animals"
"they sort of"
"it it's hard to say exactly because all"
"the changes are smooth so you just know"
"that it's been sitting at this perfect"
"head and all of a sudden you know 30"
"days later like wait a minute wait a"
"minute that's that's rounding out again"
"and uh it's you know but but no they're"
"not precise they all they all kind of"
"start doing it plus or minus i don't"
"know within a few days of each other or"
"something like that"
"it makes me wonder how far you can push"
"this so for example imagine"
"you could read the um the blueprint for"
"say a rat"
"and then you superimpose that over a"
"human embryo"
"could you could you get a"
"a rat completely made of human cells i i"
"don't see why not i see no reason why"
"not if we knew what we were doing i see"
"zero reason why not people will say you"
"know all these developmental constraints"
"and i mean i can think of a few things"
"so for example"
"if if you know if the rat has some sort"
"of weird protein uh you know in its"
"whiskers that's structural for something"
"and that humans just don't have that"
"okay the no amount of bioelectrics is"
"gonna help you if you don't have or"
"maybe some enzyme i mean i have no idea"
"but if rats have some sort of weird"
"enzyme that humans don't have um if"
"that's not going to appear from this"
"process but morphologically i i'm a firm"
"believer and and this is you know people"
"say this is this is science fiction but"
"i don't see why this is not possible i"
"think uh"
"the the end game of this whole business"
"some days uh some some you know future"
"version of us is going to be able to uh"
"have a an anatomical compiler we're"
"going to be able to sit down in front of"
"a computer draw whatever living thing"
"you want i don't care if it looks like"
"something you've seen before or you've"
"never seen before or you know a"
"six-legged frog with a with a you know a"
"propeller on its back you can draw"
"whatever whatever's biologically you"
"know even possible you should draw it"
"and then if we knew what we were doing"
"the the the anatomical compiler would uh"
"give you a set of stimuli that you would"
"have to give to some kind of cells"
"and they can be probably a wide range of"
"cells to build whatever it is that you"
"just drew so that kind of complete"
"control i i think it should i think it's"
"possible yeah i think i think it's i"
"think it should be possible"
"i mean there'll be constraints there'll"
"be some things that you know like like"
"like special proteins and enzymes and"
"things but overall it should be it"
"should be possible"
"so i guess the big important question to"
"ask following that is uh"
"the sensible question is if you killed"
"that rat would it be murder"
"well let's talk about okay so so that"
"that that gets into into an interesting"
"uh uh area which is uh something that um"
uh
"something that i've been i've been"
"actually working on which is this idea"
of
"just trying to break down a lot of these"
"uh barriers you know we was that that"
"surround various definitions so so we we"
"we throw around a lot of words organism"
"machine um uh you know human whatever we"
"throw around these words and obviously"
"in the purpose for the purposes of the"
"legal system you have to pretend that"
"they're firm the way we do with the word"
"adult right we have this we have this"
"definition of an adult"
"there's no such thing as an adult"
"nothing happens on your 18th birthday"
"that makes you a different creature than"
"you were the day before it's all"
"nonsense but but but for the but for the"
"purposes of getting you know moving on"
"with with life we have we kind of"
"pretend that that's real"
"uh but realistically what we have to"
"think about the biology is telling us"
"that all of these categories are"
"extremely soft so whatever you are as a"
"human and people say say all the time"
"the human brain is unique it does this"
"and just start walking backwards okay"
"human brain what is what is that how"
"about a hundred thousand years ago five"
"hundred thousand years ago how about"
"before that where where are you gonna"
"you know are you gonna say you're gonna"
"be able to draw some a line a sharp line"
"where you say i saw some parents those"
"parents were not you know cognitive"
"self-responsible whatever you and they"
"have an offspring family that that"
"offspring now has it the parents didn't"
"have it the offspring has it i've got a"
"line there's no such that's completely"
"impossible right that that never"
"happened and the same thing that you"
"can't the same thing in embryonic"
"development if you say i am a cognitive"
"being a single cell that's just a"
"biochemical system well guess what you"
"used to be a single cell we all took"
"that journey across the cartesian cut we"
"all started life as one cell smoothly"
"slowly you know step by step you became"
"the system that now makes claims about"
"how special you are where you know where"
"do you think that happened it's"
"completely implausible to think that"
"there's something sharp and amazing that"
"happens to you you know"
"so having said all that uh"
"that means"
"that we really need to understand when"
"we use these terms what's essential"
"right what's when somebody says uh a"
"human what what it what is really a"
"human is it is it the cells they're made"
"of i don't think so you could go out and"
"this is you know science fiction has"
"done this to death this idea you could"
"go often"
"and you could you could have a bunch of"
"your organs replaced and you could have"
"you have all kinds of things replaced"
"you could have no trace of initial human"
"dna in your body as long as you know"
"does is that what makes you stop being"
"human for the purposes of what's murder"
"and what's not i don't think so so so"
"going back to right so we have to start"
"thinking about all of the you know and i"
"call this um"
"the space of possible beings right every"
"combination of"
"of designed evolved and software"
"components is some sort of creature we"
"have we have people now that have"
"implants that drive wheelchairs right"
"and so uh you know with their mind they"
"control the wheelchair right so that's"
"you know you're 99 human one percent"
"you've got some smart chip that does"
"something embedded in your brain"
"we also have hybrids which are brain"
"cells driving little robots so you might"
"have a vacuum cleaner that's got some"
"human cells embedded on it that helps it"
"drive around that's 99 uh robot one"
"percent um"
"you know one percent human you can make"
"every combination in between every"
"combination and there's no magic enough"
"for the there's no magical percent well"
"at 72 percent now you got a human"
"completely impossible so so that means"
"that we are going to be surrounded by"
"cyborgs hybrids uh synthetic you know"
"augmented humans trans humans you know"
"you have all this stuff uh you know the"
"transhumanist movement you know you're"
"gonna have senses that the rest of us"
"don't have you're gonna be plugged into"
"you know you'll have a you'll have an"
"implant that that gives you somebody"
"will have a direct sensory input to the"
"stock market somebody else it will be to"
"the you know the solar winds because"
"they want to feel how the solar corona"
"is doing yeah we're going to all live in"
"these you know novel worlds"
"and for the purposes of what's murder"
"and what's not we're going to have to"
"have a definition of"
"what do we really mean when we say human"
"that has nothing to do with what you're"
"made of or how you got here evolve"
"designed you know wherever what your"
"parts are we got we got to do better"
"than that and so and i mean if we could"
"talk about that what what i think that"
"is but"
"uh it isn't going to be based on what"
"your genetics are what your cells are"
"all of that is swappable you know and it"
"is being swapped you know rapidly"
"i think people are going to fight about"
"this though it's going to be another"
"spectrum that people are not so happy"
"about oh i mean compared to listen"
"compared to uh you know darwin darwin uh"
"gave us this uh this amazing idea that"
"uh there is a continuum a smooth"
"continuum where you cannot distinguish"
"humans from animals that's what darwin"
"claimed right because before that you"
"had the garden of eden and i in my talk"
"i have a pic i have a painting of adam"
"naming the animals in the garden of eden"
"it's it's very convenient because you"
"have firm categories you have a human"
"and you have some sheep and some other"
stuff
"and you can say by looking at them and"
"by knowing where where you know what"
"kind of animal they are you can say"
"exactly what it's capable of you can say"
"what you can make claims about what our"
"ethical obligation to it is all that"
"kind of stuff"
"darwin said no no there there isn't"
"there isn't that sharp distinction"
"there's a smooth gradient right"
"what's coming is going to make that and"
"and we know and you know and we know"
"what what an upheaval that was at the"
"time you know people people that maybe"
"people still are going crazy over uh"
"what's actually coming is going to make"
"all of that seem like just"
"a walk in the park because it's not one"
"dimension that you can say you know have"
"you gotten up to human level from"
"whatever oh no it's going to be a"
"massive multi-dimensional space where"
"every animal and and um"
"you've ever seen is a tiny corner of"
"that space and you're gonna find you're"
"gonna we're gonna have to figure out"
"ways to relate to things that haven't"
"looked nothing like what what you've"
"ever seen"
"and and and yeah and and we're not we're"
"not good at even being nice to you know"
"within group uh you you know con"
"specifics that are like you so so"
"figuring out how to how to relate to"
"that is going to be a real challenge for"
society
"on the other hand this might force us to"
"become good at this you know just to"
"survive hopefully the one thing that uh"
"one thing that i just um my voice just"
went
"one thing that i um"
"you made me think of is uh convergent"
"evolution so it might be the case that"
"there are only so many configurations i"
"mean you paint this picture where"
"there's this um you know infinite uh"
"plane of configurations but maybe"
uh
"if you have things that look like cells"
"they make things that look like dogs and"
"cats and crabs and birds and maybe maybe"
"your work somehow explains why we do get"
"uh convergent evolution for completely"
"uh separate species"
"i mean that's true there are there are"
"attractors and many ways to get there"
"but um"
"i don't think that that"
"that you can enumerate that way the"
"space of possibilities because"
"the space itself is"
"uncountably large and and and has"
"dimensions we can't even imagine i mean"
"here's um"
"i'm going to i'm going to sketch a"
"possible being for you okay"
"let's just we have a we have a schema"
"the schema is you have a brain you have"
"a body and you have environment we're"
"going to stick with that we're going to"
"stay i'm not even going to break that"
"we're going to let's just stick with"
"that right so you have some sort of"
"brain controller it controls a body and"
"there's an environment that gives inputs"
"to the brain through some senses and uh"
"and then and then it acts in the"
"environment okay so we're going to"
"that's a familiar that's a nice familiar"
"schema for creatures let's let's twist"
"all the knobs here let's let's look at"
"the symmetries of this thing for a brain"
"i'm gonna say"
"uh here's what we're gonna build we're"
"gonna have uh we're gonna have a human"
"brain but i'd like but i'm gonna have"
"three hemispheres"
"and in fact i'm going to attach a whole"
"bunch of uh insect cells to it like like"
"a massive amount you know a huge a huge"
"amount of insect cells and and this has"
"been done so human so insect brain cells"
"live perfectly well with with human"
"brain cells we will you know somebody's"
"in fact has done it with human um"
"patients epilepsy patients input implant"
"why doesn't the body attack those cells"
"as being foreign uh is it something"
"special about the brain as far as i as"
"far as i understand that's why the brain"
"has some some immune privilege but but"
"let's say in the system that we're"
"building there's not going to be an"
"immune system we'll just make it nice"
"and simple where there's no immune"
"system so so we got so so you've got"
"your brain i've got you know i've got"
"three hemispheres of of human tissue"
"i've got a bunch of um i've got a bunch"
"of insect cells that's that's the input"
"uh that's the that's the brain rather"
now
"um it and this whole thing is sort of"
"floating in a vat uh you know and and"
"what's the body well here's here's the"
"body imagine an arena"
"uh in the arena there are a bunch of"
"robots there's not one robot they're a"
"bunch it's a swarm they're a bunch of"
"robots all these robots have have the"
"ability to move around they're getting"
"where are they getting their signals"
"from they're getting their signals from"
"a transmitter that re that gets"
"electrical readings from this crazy"
"brain i just described too so so the"
"output instead of controlling muscles"
"the brain sends electrical signals and"
"on the other end instead of a muscle"
"like you would have in a normal animal"
"you have a little transmitter and the"
"transmitter transmits signals to the"
"robotic swarm so now instead of moving"
"uh thousands up i have no idea how many"
"there are you know millions of muscle"
"fibers in your body you're moving a"
"robotic swarm"
"now that's your body now right so so"
"you're a brain in a vat and you're"
"moving a body as in all the electric as"
"in all of the um kind of sci-fi stories"
"but your body is now"
"a a robotic swarm"
"now to the extent that uh to the extent"
"that the robots uh are doing something"
"uh something useful they they're what"
"what happens is uh let's let's think"
"about the um the sensory input what's"
"the sensory input to this brain to get"
"it to to get it to to do something"
"useful with these with these robots the"
"sensory input is this there's a there's"
"a crowd of people sitting around uh this"
"arena and they're watching the robots"
"and they're tweeting about it and"
"they're on social media and the the more"
"amused they are by these robots they uh"
"they they hit they hit the you know they"
"hit the thumbs up button and and and the"
"more thumbs up buttons you get there's"
"some glucose that gets dumped into the"
"into the tank for the brain and sort of"
"feeds it and maybe maybe there's some"
"endorphins and happy mo you know happy"
"molecules and whatever right that's"
"that's the but so now"
"there is there's zero reason to think"
"that in short order that that construct"
"wouldn't learn to do interesting things"
"with its body to get more reward every"
"living thing can be trained in that way"
"and so now you've got this agent that is"
"about as alien as you can imagine"
"but you can tweak all of these"
"components right and we will have things"
"like this"
"uh and you can ask yourself how do i"
"relate to this because if the body's"
"complex enough and the brain is complex"
"enough it might have very high level of"
"intelligence there's no reason to think"
"that humans are the top of the food"
"chain at some point you know we all know"
"what a um"
"diminished capacity human is right you"
"go to court and they say well he's got"
"diminished capacity you know he can't"
"blame him for because you know it"
"doesn't have this the the iq to know"
"what he's doing how about how about"
"expanded capacity what happens when you"
"start getting the first people that have"
"uh twice the moral capacity of a normal"
"human like wow you should have really"
"you know you have the capacity to have"
"really uh watch out for all of this"
"stuff and you know and not have the"
"consequences of whatever you did a"
"normal human couldn't be expected to do"
"that but you could have you could have"
"seen that coming because you've got way"
"more iq than the rest of us what's your"
"moral responsibility so all of this this"
"this space of"
"massively different intelligences"
"different brains different bodies living"
"in different worlds with different"
"capacities all of this is coming and and"
"i sure hope that that what we're going"
"to learn from all this is that"
you
"can't establish your"
"your ethical responsibilities based on"
"what something looks like or how it got"
here
"i suppose"
"there you're describing a creature which"
wasn't
"you didn't arrive at it through some"
"evolutionary process right"
"so it might be the case that you're it"
"might be the case that your um solution"
"space you know the minima you're able to"
"access through evolution may be very"
"different to the and that's actually"
"very exciting i'd like to see this crazy"
"creature at some point that you've uh"
"described but um"
"can i ask if we if we backtrack a little"
"bit to"
"the planaria"
um
"can i ask"
"so you said that one of the amazing"
"things that you've noticed is that these"
"you know these creatures they they heal"
"they they develop and then at some point"
"they stop"
"are you able to stop that are you able"
"to grow like enormous planaria or are"
"you able to like uh"
"you know"
"hijack that process and stop it yeah"
"good question uh size control is not one"
"of the"
"things that is easy that that we have"
"found easy to control so"
"we've we've gotten things to grow that"
"normally don't grow so for example we've"
"made frogs regenerate their legs frogs"
"normally don't reject unlike salamanders"
"frogs don't regenerate their legs so you"
"amputate the leg that's you know that's"
"it we've we've been able to induce frogs"
"to regenerate their legs so in one sense"
"that's an example of size control"
"because you're getting something to grow"
"that normally wouldn't we have not made"
"gigantic planaria uh"
"yeah no the size control seems to be uh"
"tougher to crack and we haven't we"
"haven't generally cracked it you know"
"the eyes we can make extra eyes on a"
"tadpole those eyes are never bigger than"
"normal eyes"
"they you know at best they're the size"
"of a normal eye and so yeah uh no we"
"haven't we haven't made giant worms yet"
"i guess there's a hint right people who"
"have a problem with their pituitary"
"gland i suppose they"
"you end up with people who have"
ginormous
"gigantism sorry and uh you have all"
"sorts of"
"i suppose the the class of chemicals"
"that you can use are already"
"uh sort of"
"laid out because we see people with"
"these different uh"
"anomalies let's say uh people with"
sicknesses
"um yeah so so"
"uh you know you can"
"we can we can jump downstream and i i"
"feel like that's kind of um we can we"
"can certainly do that that's a little"
"bit that's a little bit cheating i mean"
"we could certainly do that we could"
"certainly provide some sort of a growth"
"hormone you know have a have a circuit"
"that just provides more growth hormone"
"causes them to grow i think that's a"
"little bit of cheating i'm not so"
"interested in that per se i want to go"
"i would like to go upstream and say how"
"do you decide what the size of a"
"flatworm should be anyway like what's"
"the primary what's the what's the way"
"that the algae that the the tissue"
"decides what a correct size is i'd like"
"to know what that's about and and and"
"you know to be honest we have not we've"
"not found that we haven't cracked it yet"
"so so how precise can you be then are"
"you able to you said you you can get an"
"extra um leg on a frog for example can"
"you differentiate i suppose do frogs"
"have a difference between their four"
"legs and hind legs are you able to"
"differentiate there"
"there are there are three types of uh"
"bioelectrical uh triggers there there is"
"the bioelectrical pattern that"
"describes exactly what the tissue is"
"going to look like this is for example"
"the electric face it has it looks like a"
"face you can move around the components"
"and it'll be whatever it is right so"
"it's a very it's almost like a paint by"
"numbers mode there's another mode which"
"is controls the organ so i can say build"
"an eye here build a brain build up you"
"know whatever right and there's another"
"mode which says even a higher level mode"
"which just says build whatever normally"
"goes here"
"whatever whatever it is i'm going to"
"tell you what it is you build whatever"
"normally goes here"
"we don't yet have a great understanding"
"of how to trigger those three different"
"options whenever we want them okay we're"
"still this is part of cracking that"
"bioelectric code we're still working"
"that out why it is that this that the"
"bioelectrics works in these three"
"different ways in three contexts so in"
"the case of the frog leg the the bad"
"news is that"
"all we know how to do is that third"
"option where we just say whatever"
"normally grows here that's what you grow"
"and and it makes it like it doesn't make"
"it you know so that's the bad news we"
"don't know how to how to you know grow a"
"heart there or or you know or a hind leg"
"or something else if it's supposed to be"
"a four like the good news is for"
"regenerative medicine it never it never"
"makes a mistake it never makes something"
"else it never makes a tumor it you know"
"it makes exactly what goes there which"
"means that once you've found that high"
"level control"
"you don't need you can you can reach"
"biomedically relevant um"
"outcomes without"
"having to"
"know everything there is to know about"
"how to micromanage it so that's the good"
"news so so we're working to exploit that"
"for for medical purposes but we don't"
"always know why you get that effect"
versus
"being able to to make specific organs"
"elsewhere there's there's there's"
"something about the code well there's"
"many things about the code that we"
"haven't cracked yet"
"is there something special about frogs"
"uh then in your you know do you suspect"
"that everything you're doing in frogs"
"should be possible with mammals is there"
"any reason why that wouldn't be the case"
"no there's no reason why that wouldn't"
"be the case we use the frog because it's"
"convenient but but we've done uh"
"we've done things in in in mammalian"
"cells already we're doing of mouse limb"
"regeneration now so we're in the process"
"of of of trying to get that to happen"
"human the reason you know that these"
"things are well conserved is because of"
"human channelopathies so there are"
"humans that have mutations in these ion"
"channels that we work with and the"
"outcomes are exactly what we see in the"
"in the other model systems they have"
"craniofacial defects they have um uh"
"heart uh"
"limb brain they have the same kinds of"
"defects that so so you know these same"
"systems are operating in these in these"
"organs in in humans"
"when you get conjoined twins is it ever"
"the case that something along these"
"lines has happened or is it always too"
"different you know"
"does this ever happen where someone"
"grows an art like complete arm and it's"
"just this sort of a process at play"
"it's a good poi it's a good question uh"
"in in"
"the problem is that it's rare that you"
"know what exactly happened so sometimes"
"you know sometimes you'll have an embryo"
"and some pieces that don't belong and"
"then you usually say well there used to"
"be another twin and it resorbed or"
"something like you you never quite know"
"what actually happened there is there is"
"a really interesting mutation in mice"
"although we don't know what"
"nobody knows what's what's actually"
"involved it could be an ion channel that"
"would be fantastic but i don't know if"
"that's the case it's called ds"
"disorganization and these mice are"
"really weird uh"
"it looks like a it looks like every"
"mouse takes a roll of the dice as far as"
"what's going to happen they're all"
"different and sometimes you just have a"
"random leg sticking out of somewhere"
"you'll have random great various random"
"organs in the wrong places it just it"
"just looks like somebody scrambled it"
"and and i would love nothing more than"
"to to know that that that was some sort"
"of a bioelectric perturbation but it's"
"not known actually what what the issue"
"there is do you suspect it do you"
"suspect it's in the dna or is there a"
"good chance that that's well it is it is"
"in the dna because it's a it's a it's a"
"it's a line with uh with what i think"
"still a bunch of deletions if i recall"
"correctly so so it is a mutant line of"
"mice but what's entirely possible is"
"that part of what's mutated is um"
"uh is is a bunch of ion channels that"
"are one or more ion channels that are"
"required for the organs to know where"
"they're supposed to go"
"so that would be a pretty that would be"
"a pretty cool story"
"on the topic of plenary and sorry i keep"
"jumping back to this there's something"
"that i i notice i i want to know so"
"you know you said that if you can"
"you can get two-headed planaria and if"
"you cut them in half then you'll get two"
"head of planaria again"
"can what happens if they have uh sexual"
"reproduction do"
"do they pass along because"
"from what i understand this is sort of"
"like a collective phenomena and when you"
"have sexual reproduction you have sort"
"of a sperm and an egg and so it doesn't"
"seem like there's enough cells there to"
"pass on this sort of information but"
"have you tried this yeah yeah great"
"great question uh well so so here's the"
"deal um"
"we don't i don't have any first of all"
"we have not tried it because we haven't"
"really been successful in getting the"
"two heads to lay eggs they just they"
"just don't seem to want to do it um i"
"that's probably it's at some point we'll"
"probably crack it but but but for now we"
"haven't been able to do it uh"
"on the one hand i have no reason to"
"believe that they should that it should"
"pass through the single cell"
"kind of bottleneck right of sexual"
"reproduction so it may not be i wouldn't"
"be surprised at all if it just didn't"
"work that way however"
"uh just as a as a as a um"
"kind of"
"bioengineering fantasy exercise i can"
"come up with a way that it would work"
"even even through that in other words if"
"it does work i think i i would have a"
"hypothesis of how and here's how"
"when you in the olden days"
"and actually not so old uh when you"
"would uh take a"
"uh electrophysiological electrode and"
"you would ask"
"what's the voltage of this cell you"
"would get one number well the reason you"
"get one number is because you poked it"
"with one electrode and you got one"
"number but with the voltage dies what"
"you can see is when you stain these"
"cells individual cells don't have one"
"voltage they actually have a bunch of"
"different voltages all around their"
"membrane so every cell is like a soccer"
"ball of different domains right of"
"different different colored patches on"
"the surface that has to do with uh micro"
"domains of ion channel rafts and some"
"other things that that there are a bunch"
"of different different voltages on the"
"cell surface so imagine so again this is"
"total fantasy there's no evidence that"
"anything like this is happening but it's"
"a story that that we can sort of think"
"about how it might work"
"imagine that when the body of the frog"
"of the mother frog is preparing the"
oocyte
"it signals to that or or let's say let's"
"say we were talking about a"
"plenary so let's say a two header"
"planarian two head planarian is"
"preparing the oocyte"
"uh what it might do is impose signals on"
"one side and the other"
"that provide a little pattern within the"
"surface of one cell not across cells the"
"way that the the adult has but on top of"
"one cell so basically project the whole"
"bioelectric pattern just scale it down"
"so that it projects to the surface of"
"one cell we already know that single"
"cells their surface is already an"
"excitable medium that can hold more than"
"one voltage we already know that in fact"
"in fact the in in mammalian cells which"
"are small like planarian cells"
"the the individual domains can be as"
"small as two microns so that's the"
"resolution the resolution of it can be"
"it can be a little patch that's two"
"microns so that's actually a lot you can"
"you can you can put a lot of information"
there
so
"anyway again uh this is we don't have"
"any evidence for this but if if if it"
"turns out that this thing does pass"
"through sexual reproduction i'm going to"
"guess that's what's happening that it's"
"basically imprinting the pattern on the"
egg
"as it's made i think i think it's it"
"could be done"
"and i suppose egg cells are generally"
"quite large as well so that would help"
"yeah yeah yeah and again the pat you"
"know the pattern that we've seen so far"
"at least for the head number you know"
"head shape is a different story but for"
"hidden number you really only need to"
"store one bit of influence okay two bits"
"of information so you don't need a very"
"complex pattern to be able to say how"
"many heads"
"another thing that sort of caught my"
"attention is uh i was watching one of uh"
"your talks that you haven't you're"
"talking about um"
"how these planaria if you cut them in"
"half and then they"
"they i suppose they split in joint form"
"two uh full planaria"
um
i
"you were talking about how you can sort"
"of train them to do something beforehand"
"you cut off their head"
"then they grow a new head and they"
"restore they have the memory so how"
"complex are these tasks that they can"
"remember yeah yeah um so so this is and"
"i have to say we weren't the ones who"
"first discovered this there was a guy"
"named james mcconnell in the 60s who"
"first discovered this he wrote a bunch"
"of papers on this doing these"
"experiments manually everybody you know"
"he caught a lot of um a lot of flack"
"over it because uh people said i can't"
"be right and then some people you know"
"didn't have the patience to uh to"
"reproduce it with with planaria it was a"
"real pain these experiments so we did it"
"in an automated way when i what i wanted"
"to do and this was we started this in"
"like 2013 i want to say uh we created a"
"device that's all fully automated the"
"tests and trains planaria in a fully"
"automated way i wanted to be able to say"
"look this is all objective you you you"
"don't think it works look at the movies"
"you tell me what you think they're doing"
"so so in a way that would basically take"
"the observer take the human out of the"
"out of the loop and and and you know"
"just do it automatically so so it works"
"mcconnell was right it is true uh"
however
"um the tasks are not particularly"
"complex and"
"i don't know that that's because they're"
"not smart enough i think it's because we"
"haven't found"
"things they care about enough so we're"
"using you know mcconnell used light"
"flashes and electric shock you know"
"that's that's not something that"
"planaria are probably pretty good at"
"knowing what to do with it's kind of a"
"weird uh thing for them uh what we did"
"was we took um we took plastic"
"petri dishes and we used the laser"
"etcher to kind of make a certain pattern"
"and one one place in the dish right kind"
"of make it make it make it bumpy"
"and then and that's where we would put"
"the food so basically what the planarian"
"knew is that hey when i come into this"
"bumpy area that's where the food shows"
"up right so it's kind of place"
"conditioning and so then we cut their"
"heads off and we showed that yeah on the"
"way out uh you know when their heads"
"regrow they're"
"they're more likely to uh to be able to"
"find the food because they they already"
"know the bumpy location is where they're"
"supposed to go"
"so you know not not a super um not a"
"super complicated memory but"
"still uh but you know but still it shows"
"the principle that that you can imprint"
"new information from the somatic tissue"
"onto a brand new brain which should be"
"uh i always thought that we should uh"
"you know we should be getting money from"
"like alcor or somebody who's who's you"
"know interested in making sure that that"
"memories that human memories uh you know"
"can be uh can be put back you know when"
"when brains are rejuvenated"
"do you think you can extrapolate"
"to humans like"
"should we really think of the brain as"
"being this you know there's a barrier"
"between the brain where everything"
"happens and then the outside body or is"
"does this"
"show that this barrier sort of breaks"
"down and really there's a continuum from"
"your brain to the rest of your body or"
"what what do you learn from this yeah i"
"i look i don't know we certainly can't"
"claim that"
"humans are going to have the same type"
"of ability to pass information from"
"their body onto a new brain"
uh
"i also don't see any reason to assume"
"that you couldn't i mean the planaria"
"have a true centralized brain they have"
"all the same neurotransmitters that you"
"and i do they have you know i don't see"
"any reason to think that's impossible"
"for humans to do that but i also but we"
"certainly haven't shown that they can it"
"this is this is going to be"
"this is going to be this is going to"
"come up um"
"in a serious way because in the next i"
"don't know 10 years"
"people will solve this stem cell biology"
"problem of degenerative disease where"
"they will repopulate"
"regions of adult humans with you know"
"five six decades of memories with novels"
"than the stem cell progeny right to cure"
"degenerative disease and then and then"
"we're gonna find out what happens do you"
"wipe it does that you end up with a"
"blank you know blank baby basically or"
"do you end up with a with a human says"
"ah i feel i feel fantastic and i still"
"remember everything i had in my life so"
"right i don't know uh we're gonna we're"
"gonna find out um but i see no reason at"
"this point to to be able to decide one"
"way or the other"
"the future is going to be very weird"
"one of the um other things i'm sort of"
"curious about that maybe you have some"
"idea of is um"
"you know you hear about on the topic of"
"consciousness so you hear about um"
"people who take psychedelics and perhaps"
"too much and they have a bad trip and"
"have sort of"
"permanent changes uh made to their"
"personality or you also hear about um"
"electroshock therapy being used to"
"cure various ailments"
"do you have an idea of what's going on"
"there in the brain uh to"
"give rise to these sort of permanent"
"changes to personality and"
"no i'm not i'm not the right person to"
"ask that question there are plenty of"
"people that know more more about that"
"than i so so i won't i don't have"
"anything useful to say on that however"
"um i will i will uh"
"get to tell you a related story that i"
"think is pretty interesting um"
"most general anesthetics so it's"
"interesting local anesthetics tend to be"
"ion channel blockers general anesthetics"
"tend to be gab junction on couplers so"
"here is here is uh an interesting uh"
"thing where"
"somebody goes into the into the hospital"
"for some surgery they why they walk in"
"they're a coherent"
"centralized intelligence right at least"
"that's how they feel with you know with"
"with goals and memories and everything"
"else and they say boy i hope you know i"
"hope the surgery goes well incomes the"
"halothane gas all of the gap junctions"
"in their brain start to get decoupled"
"now what happens the cells are still"
"there nobody's damaged nobody's injured"
"nobody's poisoned"
"but they've disconnected from each other"
"and now the human is gone the person is"
"gone right for the next however many"
"hours they're gone uh even though the"
"cells are all there but but what's gone"
"is that is that that that's that that"
"electrochemical um"
"uh uh uh"
"that complex electrochemical uh state is"
"is missing"
"now here's the amazing part uh and by"
"the way people have done um anesthetics"
"with uh you know uh with with plants"
"with that that kind of anesthetic is"
"exactly how we we can induce the two"
"head phenotype it's it's all the same"
"stuff the brain really did just borrow"
"all this from from from you know"
"non-neural cells but but here's the"
"here's the amazing part if some if i"
"didn't know that general anesthetic"
"worked and somebody said to me you know"
"we're gonna do we're gonna decouple all"
"the cells then we're gonna let them"
recouple
"and we're gonna hope that you're back to"
"the same uh individual that you were"
"when you started i always said wow not"
"in a million years right you are gonna"
"walk out of there you know either either"
"completely you know babbling"
"incoherently or you're going to be you"
"can have some other you know changes to"
"your changes to your cognition that have"
"nothing to no resemblance to what"
"happened when you walked in but that's"
"not what happens when when your cells"
regain
"most of the time eventually people come"
"back to their original state it's"
"incredible that the brain actually finds"
"the right state after after being"
"uncoupled and recoupled however"
"some people don't so there is this thing"
"called um"
"uh a post uh post anesthetic psychotic"
"uh something where they actually don't"
"come back to normal"
"and there's a great there's a great set"
"of videos on youtube that shows people"
"coming out of general anesthesia and you"
"know they think they're pirates and"
"gangsters and they're talking all this"
"crazy stuff because the their brain is"
"still trying to find the right you know"
"the right set of patterns but but most"
"people eventually come back to normal i"
"think that's amazing and i don't think"
"we understand that very well does that"
"say that sort of the self who you are is"
"sort of more in the hardware than the"
"software then or or does it"
"say that you're actually a different"
"person after you come back around if you"
"believe it's helping this what does it"
"tell you about your sense of self"
"i mean the question of what's what makes"
"for a different person of course as"
"philosophers have dealt with for for a"
"really long time i'm not sure how useful"
"of a question that is i mean i don't"
"even know that i'm the same person that"
"i was you know some years back uh that i"
"don't even know i don't know what that"
"does for us answering be trying to try"
"to answer that question i'm not sure"
"what that does for us um"
"so i don't know about that but uh as far"
"as the software hardware i think what"
"that does say"
"is that there is something in those"
cells
"that can be rebooted to"
"restart the same bioelectric state that"
"it had a while back"
"and we kind of already knew there had to"
"be that because you can ask the question"
"well where does the bioelectric"
"pre-pattern come from in early"
"development we know what happens once"
"you have the pattern all the cells obey"
"and build whatever where the pattern"
"come from well it all has to come from"
"one cell it has to emerge from something"
"that that egg that one cell egg is doing"
"so i'm gonna i'm gonna give you a guess"
"and it's just a guess although some"
"people um some other people like it um"
"you know stu hammer off and folks like"
"that like it um i think that um"
uh
"the cytoskeleton and and maybe other"
"components of of uh inside cells"
"keep a long-term"
"memory of which the bioelectric stuff is"
"the uh you know they basically it's"
"basically the um i don't know what you"
"would call it you could you could say"
"it's the firmware that basically like"
"kickstarts the electrical process again"
"right and gets you get you back where"
"you need to be we know the egg does that"
"because we can see the ion channels"
"shuttling based on um cytoskeletal"
"tracks and things like that at the end"
"early in early development so that's my"
"guess but i'm not going to pretend to"
"really have the answer to this like we"
"we don't know there's so much about this"
"we don't know it's crazy"
"a question that might eventually be"
"answerable is um do you think"
"we're ever going to have the precision"
"to read memories"
"is this"
"something you uh"
yeah
"that's a that's a great that's a great"
"question um"
"i think that i think to some extent"
"just to some extent yes in the sense"
"that we've already had some"
uh
"success with it"
"in terms of neural decoding in both"
"animals and and and i think this has"
"been done in some human patients um to"
"some success is to some extent yes but i"
"don't think you're going to have"
a
one-size-fits-all
"sort of solution that anybody can just"
"walk in you scan them and you go oh man"
"you're thinking of uh you know of this"
"and that i don't think that's going to"
"work i think that what you might be able"
"to do is take each individual person"
"read all kinds of uh brain states and"
"construct a personalized machine"
"learning model that will allow you to"
"say some things about that person's"
"mental state later i think that's doable"
"like longitudinally i think that might"
"be doable i do not think that um you're"
"going to be able to do it across across"
people
"i realize you have to go so i'm just"
"going to wrap up with uh a very brief"
question
"actually a"
"very brief question and then a very very"
"brief follow-up question which should be"
"a yes or no but um"
"so what's your dream for this what if if"
everything
"turns out as you expect what how far do"
"you think we can take this technology"
"what's the dream scenario what what can"
"we do in the future uh coming out of"
"your research"
"i i have a you know kind of a practical"
"uh capability dream and then more of a"
"philosophical dream the the practical"
"dream is i want"
a
"i want an anatomical compiler someday"
"that will be able to"
"make will be able to tell cells what to"
