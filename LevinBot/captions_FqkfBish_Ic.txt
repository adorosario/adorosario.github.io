"vermont i'm really happy to welcome you"
"all on behalf of uvm and our partners"
"tufts university and harvard university"
"and a really big thank you to the folks"
"at the vis institute for biologically"
"inspired engineering at harvard for"
"organizing and hosting this conversation"
"really excited about it"
"um so we're here to talk together about"
"zenobots some people refer to them as"
"xenobots we can have a separate"
"conversation about that sometime"
"these are the world's first living"
"robots and they are in fact i would"
"argue something new under the sun"
"they tap into"
"help us understand"
"ancient forces"
"as old as life itself"
"these are hybrids biological machines"
"that represent an amazing synthesis"
"between computer design"
"human insight laboratory expertise"
"artificial intelligence"
"and the innate capabilities and"
"mechanisms of cells"
"reported last year xenobots are computer"
"designed they're hand-built biological"
"machines they're assembled from frog"
"cells that have been shown to be able to"
"move on their own find targets retain"
information
"and now as you may know in a new study"
"published this week in pns the"
"proceedings of the national academy of"
sciences
"the science team the folks gathered here"
"today report that xenobots are able to"
self-replicate
"it's a form of biological reproduction"
"never seen before"
"so let me introduce you to the team"
"josh bongard"
"is the vinod professor of computer"
"science here at the university of"
"vermont and director of the morphology"
"evolution and cognition laboratory"
"within uvm's college of engineering and"
"mathematical sciences"
"mike levin"
"is the van of our professor"
"within the department of biology at"
"tufts university"
"and the director of the allen discovery"
"center at tufts"
and
"the center for regenerative and"
"developmental biology at tufts"
"mike is also a distinguished professor"
"and associate faculty in harvard's visa"
institute
"sam kriegman is a computer scientist who"
"completed his doctoral work with josh"
"baumgardt here at uvm and now holds a"
"joint post-doctoral appointment at the"
"visa institute and at the allen"
"discovery center at tufts"
"and douglas blackiston doug is the"
"senior scientist"
"at the allen discovery center at tufts"
university
and
"at the visa institute at harvard as well"
"so it's now my pleasure to turn this"
"over to my colleague professor kurt"
"dambrowski kirk is the vice president"
"for research here at uvm"
"and a distinguished anthropologist and"
"scientist in his own right"
"and a key leader and driving force"
"behind the work that you're going to"
"learn about during this webinar"
"so kirk over to you"
"thank you josh i'm i'm delighted to"
"welcome you to this webinar and to this"
"conversation about a remarkable"
"discovery and a remarkable new chapter"
"in science"
"um like many of you on the webinar today"
"i'm amazed at this discovery or should i"
"call it invention of living robots and"
"now this new result they can replicate"
"it's a new form of biological"
reproduction
"the scientists who made this discovery"
"who invented zenobots are here and i'm"
"going to turn this over to them shortly"
"but i want to take a minute and give you"
"a sense of the partnership and larger"
"landscape that's led us here"
"this ongoing research endeavor is built"
"on partnership a partnership that's"
"allowed a team of researchers to create"
"and understand these zenobots and which"
"combines computer science and biology in"
"truly novel ways"
"the partnership began as a collaboration"
"between the university of vermont and"
"tufts university and led to the creation"
"in late 2000 of the institute for"
"computationally designed organisms the"
"icd-0 i'd urge you to take a look at the"
"icdo website to learn more"
"the icdo spans two locations the allen"
"discovery center at tufts university led"
"by michael levin and the morphology"
"evolution and cognition laboratory at"
"the university of vermont led by josh"
bongard
"and i'm delighted that this partnership"
"is growing and deepening and is now"
"expanded to include our wonderful host"
"today at the visa institute for"
"biologically inspired engineering at"
"harvard university please consider this"
"a special thank you to our new partners"
"the most recent news and reason for"
"being here today"
"is the newest capacity of xenobots"
"self-replication the discovery that the"
"world's first living computer-designed"
"organisms can perform novel forms of"
replication
"a challenging and potentially"
"game-changing discovery that the"
"researchers will discuss more more fully"
"as importantly though the larger goal of"
"the research and the institute is a"
"deeper understanding of life itself"
"xenobots the science team has said are"
"tools for learning"
"and in this time of rapid change and"
"multiplying global challenges from"
"climate change to burgeoning pollution"
"we have much to learn"
"the intersection and interaction of life"
"machines and intelligence bends our"
"categories and opens important"
"opportunities from regenerative medicine"
"to environmental cleanup to new insights"
"about how life works"
"and xenobots themselves present new"
"challenges and new questions"
"this partnership the team's approach and"
"the deep quest for expanding life"
"science will help researchers around the"
"world to advance innovation at the"
"frontier of science and technology and"
"to address the vitally important ethical"
"and philosophical questions inherent in"
"this new work"
"i look forward to learning more in the"
"conversation that follows and i'm happy"
"to introduce lindsey brownell a science"
"writer and communicator at the vis"
"institute who will serve as the"
"moderator for this afternoon's"
"conversation lindsey"
"thanks so much kirk for those wonderful"
"opening remarks and again welcome to all"
"of our attendees"
"if you would like to see a transcript of"
"this event today you can go to the"
"bottom of your zoom screen and click"
"more and then click show subtitle"
"we want to make sure that everybody can"
"access this information in a way that is"
"best for them"
"so we are going to be having a really"
"fun discussion today with um all of our"
"scientists who are the authors of the"
"xenobots 3.0 as we're calling them paper"
"um and it has created quite a stir on"
"social media over the last few days so"
"i'm really excited that we can sort of"
"respond to some of these questions and"
"comments that people have been making"
"about them because as josh brown said"
"earlier they really are something new"
"under the sun"
"so i'm going to start by asking my first"
"question to mike levin"
"so for anybody in the audience who may"
"not have been following the trajectory"
"of xenobots could you just explain"
"what xenobots are what are these little"
"blobs that we've seen toodling aren't in"
"a dish"
"sure um xenobots are a"
"a new entry in a long tradition of"
"experiments designed to understand a"
"number of questions in different fields"
so
"we we are still as a scientist groping"
"for a proper understanding of what"
"robots are what does it mean to be a"
"robot what does it mean to be an"
"individual what does it mean to be an"
"organism or a machine and uh this is"
"this is part of our effort to understand"
"biological plasticity as well you know"
"what are collections of cells able to do"
"under various circumstances and so what"
"zenobots are are an extremely convenient"
"model system to ask questions like this"
"basically they consist of"
"skin cells taken off of an early frog"
"embryo in one uh in one version there's"
"also a bit of a muscle put in as well"
"but um they are basically uh taken off"
"or or liberated from the normal"
"instructive interactions that tell them"
"what to do as skin you know to sit on"
"the outside of a tadpole and"
"keep out the bacteria and so on and uh"
"in this new environment right they're"
"placed in a new environment they're"
"stimulated or sculpted in accordance"
"with the instructions of a machine"
"learning algorithm about which you'll"
"hear more today and then they're given"
"the opportunity to basically uh reboot"
"their multicellularity you know they're"
"they're as a collection of skin cells"
"they could have done many things they"
"could have made a monolayer or crawled"
"off or you know but what they in fact do"
"is form a very coherent little"
"proto-organism that uh has some some"
"surprising capacity so it's motile it's"
"self-actuated it can move it can heal"
"damage as we found out and reported this"
"week it can actually replicate and make"
"under very specific conditions make"
"copies of itself uh and many other"
"things which we're only now beginning to"
"sort of scratch the surface of what they"
"can do but it's a it's an example of"
"amazing biological plasticity"
"awesome thank you so uh my next question"
"is for doug whom i know"
"was in the lab doing a lot of the"
"hands-on work to create these xenobots"
"and as i mentioned"
"a lot of people since the paper came out"
"have been very concerned about what"
"these things could or could not do now"
"that they are"
"living robots that can replicate and a"
"lot of people have been referring to"
"living robots in sci-fi movies and tv"
"shows like the cylons from battlestar"
"galactica which famously are robots but"
"they are biological they look like"
"humans and they end up"
"terrorizing the human race and basically"
"committing genocide which obviously"
"nobody nobody wants to to see happen so"
"as the person who was you know most"
"closely involved with with building the"
"xenobots and seeing um what they can and"
"cannot do can you just let us know"
"what the process was for actually you"
"know coaxing these skin cells to do this"
"other stuff that they can now do um as"
"mike said liberated from their normal"
"environment of being you know part of"
"part of an embryo um and then he let us"
"know what what they can and cannot do"
"how much should we actually be concerned"
about
"sure thanks so much uh maybe i'll walk"
"you through the design process for just"
"one or two minutes very briefly and then"
"we can get into the ethics"
"so in general you can think of these"
"like small microscopic self-motile"
"cellular forms or designs that are all"
"built from amphibian cells"
"and we started here with amphibians"
"because there's a lot of advantages"
"although we could easily port this to"
"other cell types as well so amphibians"
"live in in water so that's convenient"
"for us you can keep them on your bench"
"top and in fresh water at room"
"temperatures and these cells survive"
"these forms survive for over 10 to 14"
"days without any external food source"
"because they're loaded with energy from"
"the egg"
"also there's a rich history of using"
"these cells in developmental biology so"
"for over a hundred years this has been a"
"laboratory species it was established by"
"a rather eccentric scientist named"
"lancelot hogman who was a british"
"zoologist from south africa and brought"
"the species back"
"since then the field has flourished and"
"this model's been used so we have a nice"
"atlas of where different cell types and"
"stem cells can be collected from"
"throughout development and there's been"
"a lot of modern work looking at the"
"molecular biology of cell sulfate"
"specification and we can play with the"
"molecular genetics to get different cell"
"types so what i do is i have a different"
"couple different design methods and one"
"i harvest individual cells or tissues"
"from different parts of the embryo to"
"build something new from the ground up"
"so we did this in our original work"
"where we placed and layered cardiac"
"cells to produce a specific type of"
"walking motion but we can also take"
"whole regions like a sphere of tissue of"
"the skin that people studied for many"
"decades that developed cilia and these"
"cellular beading little hairs create"
"motion we did that in a manuscript as"
"well and for both we can shape these and"
"push them into different geometries and"
"anatomies using a series of tools and"
"then finally some of the other team"
"members will talk about the fact that we"
"can also simulate these designs so we"
"can use a computer simulation in a"
"virtual world to explore"
"uh the types of behaviors or interesting"
"phenomena that we might want to generate"
"so regardless of the design i often"
"think of all of these as just different"
"living materials with which we build you"
"can think of them as actuators for"
"movement scaffolds and sensors"
"so after the design aspect there's"
"certainly ethics i just want to"
"specifically say that this is something"
"we're very sensitive to as scientists"
"and this falls under multiple levels of"
"oversight so there's institutional"
"regulations that are well established"
"for anything involving living or animal"
"material as well as state and federal"
"regulations which have been worked out"
"for many microbial systems that are"
"genetically modified in laboratories"
"also i want to say at the university"
"level we have a committee that oversees"
"any of our animal work and this contains"
"not only veterinarians and scientists"
"but also upstanding members of the"
"community which include clergy lawyers"
"and ethicists i have to make sure that"
"this passed uh the general ethics"
"guidelines and last uh as as you hinted"
"too earlier"
"this system is is extremely contrived"
"and what we see with the"
"self-replication that some of the other"
"members will talk about it really only"
"exists under a very specific set of"
"conditions in a petri dish right now so"
"without supplying a rich source of frog"
"stem cells to the system that are added"
"externally by an investigator the system"
"falls apart and essentially the cells"
"disintegrate after 10 to 14 days so this"
"is not capable of propagating without"
"outside help"
"so if the xenobots were to you know"
"escape the lab and end up in a pond"
"somewhere eventually"
"within about two weeks there just"
"wouldn't be any more of them sure so"
"frogs shed their skin all the time when"
"they shed their skin there's often"
"healthy cells of which it's the same"
"cell types we're using to build"
"these constructs and those cells go on"
"to just decompose in the waterway and"
"are harmless"
"excellent that's that's very reassuring"
actually
"um so my next question is going to be"
"for josh uh because"
"this uh collaboration as we've just been"
"talking about is a lot of developmental"
"biology um has informed this but there's"
also
"a computational and computer science"
"aspect to it and so josh my question for"
"you is about the fact that we we call"
"these things living robots but the"
"xenobots don't really have brains or any"
"neural tissue to speak of they're just"
"skin cells and maybe occasionally some"
"some muscle cells in there but they do"
"seem to have some kind of"
"some kind of basal cognition because"
"watching the videos they've been posted"
"online you can see that they're able to"
"kind of navigate the environment they're"
"able to collect these loose cells and"
"form them into"
"sort of what we call the baby xenobots"
"that eventually become the offspring um"
"so even though there's no there's no"
"brain involved there's still some kind"
"of cognitive function so what can"
"building things like xenobots tell us"
"about what"
"intelligence and and thinking actually"
are
"yeah that's a great question lindsay"
"thank you so i'll start with brains you"
"mentioned brains the xenobots don't have"
"uh brains"
"looking at the xenobots through the lens"
"of ai and robotics"
"if you look at how ai has developed"
"we've sort of said to ourselves well"
"humans we have big brains and we're"
"smart at least some of the time so it"
"seems obvious that brains must equal"
"intelligence and this is one of the"
"reasons why ai researchers are building"
"ever larger electronic brains called"
"neural networks or deep learners we're"
"dropping them into phones and"
"self-driving cars"
"but all of us i think are starting to"
"see the limitations of this ai approach"
"from funny auto correct fails to the"
"unintentional killing of pedestrians by"
"self-driving cars"
"it's not that ai does this on purpose"
"all current ai are solipsists ai simply"
"doesn't know that anyone or anything"
"else exists"
"on the flip side organisms including"
"those without brains like xenobots use"
"their bodies to push against the world"
"and against other creatures literally"
"and figuratively and they learn how"
"those things push back"
"this allows them to figure out how to"
"get what they need by working with"
"others rather than ignoring them"
"and so this suggests what we're learning"
"from xenobots and other synthetic"
"biology attempts is that it suggests"
"that intelligence is not something"
"stored somewhere in the brain"
"whatever is going on is a much more"
"complex dance between body brain"
"environment and other sentient beings"
"wow that's that's actually very profound"
"for us as humans too because we like to"
"think that we are you know"
"individual thinking um self-aware beings"
"but yeah we are part of our environment"
"as well and we our brain does send"
"inputs out but it also takes lots of"
"things in when trying to figure out"
"what is up and what is down"
"thank you"
"my next question is for sam um who is"
"also a little bit more on the"
"computational side of things and i want"
"to focus on"
"the replication that aspect of the"
"xenobots which is you know that's the"
"new big thing that they can do they can"
"replicate but the type of replication"
"that they are doing is something that"
"has never really been seen in"
"biological creatures before and as i'm"
"sure most of us know"
"animals plants"
"amoebas fungi usually produce in one of"
"a few ways there's sexual or asexual"
"reproduction a lot of"
"things reproduce by just butting the"
"parts of themselves off that then"
"you know become new offspring but in all"
"of these existing types of biological"
reproduction
"there is a component of the parent that"
"ends up going into the child just"
"physically whether it's just dna or"
"whether it's you know there's part of"
"part of parts of the mother and the"
"father that make the baby but in this"
case
"the xenobots were collecting"
"all these loose stem cells that were"
"separate from themselves and were kind"
"of aggregating them together and then"
"that became a new xenobot which is"
"sort of a replication"
"by assembly almost kind of like building"
"things out of lego blocks"
so
"what are the implications of"
"seeing this kind of replication"
"in living organisms for the first time"
"well the xenobots tend to raise more"
"questions than they answer"
"so i'm not sure exactly what the"
"implications are at this point"
"if we zoom in"
"on a xenobot to the level of a single"
cell
"it's not new"
"it's a part of a frog"
"but then we zoom back out"
"and xenobot doesn't look like or"
"replicate like anything we've ever seen"
"before in nature"
"they look more like robots building"
"other robots as you mentioned"
"more like robots than an organism"
reproducing
"and uh in fact around the same time that"
"the very first autonomous robots were"
"being built in the late 1940s"
"scientists were thinking about whether"
"or not it would be possible for a"
"machine to build a copy of itself"
"and it wasn't at all obvious that this"
"would be possible"
"many thought that it would result in a"
"logical contradiction"
"because it wasn't really clear whether"
"or not an infinite regress of blueprints"
"inside of blueprints for the entire"
"possibly infinite family tree would need"
"to be somehow stored inside of each"
"self-reproducing machine"
"but in 1948 john von neumann proved that"
"it was indeed theoretically possible to"
"create machines that reproduce"
"themselves mechanically"
"and inspired by this engineers have"
"since hand designed wooden blocks with"
"complementary hooks and levers robotic"
"trains on tracks as well as robot arms"
"that can be set up to yield copies of"
themselves
"and the xenobots now demonstrate"
"something pretty cool in my opinion that"
"so-called von neumann machines can be"
"built out of biological cells instead of"
"synthetic materials like wood or plastic"
"or metal and that they can be"
"automatically designed and optimized"
well
"i think that that's a that's a really"
"big shift in"
"that we are seeing in people's"
"conceptions of robots and at the"
"beginning mike mentioned that"
"people have been trying to figure out"
"what do we consider a robot to be and i"
"think for a long time a robot was"
"something that was mechanical that was"
"built out of gears and sprockets and"
"that was you know totally separate from"
"from things that are created but i would"
"say naturally or biologically but now"
"we're seeing oh"
"biological things that can also be"
"materials and we can learn how to"
"manipulate them and take advantage of a"
"lot of their abilities that they have"
"that you know other non-living materials"
"don't have"
"and that actually kind of segues nicely"
"to my next question which is going back"
"to doug"
um
"one thing that i want to call out about"
"these xenobots is that"
"their genes were not altered at all"
"and that these behaviors that we saw"
"them doing that were not what we would"
"expect from a normal skin cell being"
"part of a frog"
"all happened without touching their"
"genomes and i think a lot of people when"
"we talk about biological things being"
"modified or having different behaviors a"
"lot of people think about things like"
"crispr and gene engineering um but this"
"kind of implies that similar to what"
"josh was saying about how intelligence"
"doesn't just live in the brain"
"we're seeing that behavior also isn't"
"something that lives in in the genes it"
"seems to arise from other places"
so
"if these behaviors weren't coded into"
"this into the frog cells dna what"
"where did they come from um what caused"
"them to to manifest like that"
"yeah so i think there's there's a lot of"
"developmental biology that goes into"
"this with the way that the cells will"
"communicate and self-assemble"
"and decision make as they're placed into"
"these different contexts and so there"
"are some unexpected interactions that"
"can happen there and then what's"
"interesting is also on the flip side"
"there are some of these behaviors that"
"are predictable so"
"when a cilia beats you can generate flow"
"which may generate motility and muscle"
"contracts you can deform tissue in a way"
"that might generate a walking behavior"
"so if you think about these things like"
"spring springs and scaffolds and sensors"
"in addition to cells"
"i think the the question then is is how"
"do you order the parts or put them"
"together or allow them to assemble in a"
"way to learn about or to perform or to"
"enhance any specific behavior that"
"you're interested in"
"so part a lot of this falls in the"
"developmental biology but a lot of this"
"also comes back to the simulator"
"so the simulator can survey this"
"incredibly wide design space to allow us"
"to hone in on interesting shapes"
"morphologies and forms that can generate"
"really interesting hypotheses about the"
"types of behaviors that we may be able"
"to generate or interrogate with the"
system
"awesome cool thank you and you mentioned"
"the the simulator which is the which is"
"the topic of my next question which is"
"going back to sam um i think that when a"
"lot of people saw in the information"
"about xenobots"
"that it was ai designed i think a lot of"
"people sort of assumed that the ai was"
"built into the xenobots and the xenobots"
"were somehow using some kind of"
"artificial intelligence to do what they"
"were doing um but the ai part is"
"actually it was instrumental in helping"
"to create the xenobots but it wasn't"
"it's not part of the the organisms"
"themselves so could you just explain how"
"that simulator was used to help you"
"design the xenobots"
"sure so here in this project ai is a"
"means to an end which is a xenobot that"
"does what we want it to do"
"in more generally the utility of ai as a"
"design tool is that it speeds the design"
"process and it can come up with a"
"diversity of unique designs that a human"
"engineer might not think of"
"so in this project we discovered"
"something interesting"
"a unique form of replication"
"but there was a problem this phenomenon"
"was somewhat ephemeral self-replication"
"only lasted for one or two generations"
"so we created a computer program that"
"was rather simple"
"and all it did was predict how different"
"xenobot designs could prolong this"
"behavior of self-replication that we"
observed
"we know that"
"body shape affects behavior"
"so we tried out billions of different"
"xenobot shapes in the simulation"
and
"one of the best shapes was funny enough"
"reminiscent of pac-man a circular shape"
"with a mouth"
"and at first glance this was rather"
"surprising but in hindsight after"
"watching the behaviors in simulation and"
"in the real living xenobots we have a"
"much better intuition about why this"
"computer design is so powerful"
"the mouth is used by the xenobots to"
"capture collect"
"and essentially shovel loose cells into"
"much larger piles than other designs"
"could achieve and because larger piles"
"in this case equals bigger and stronger"
"offspring which are more likely to"
"replicate themselves"
"it produced it amplified"
self-replication
"gotcha thank you it's so cool that we"
"have we have the ability to try out"
"billions of shapes"
"without having to do billions of"
"experiments i'm sure that doug was very"
"happy about that"
"okay my next question my next two"
"questions are going to be zooming back"
"out a little bit we've been talking a"
"lot about the uh the individual xenobots"
"themselves and now we're going to be"
"taking xenobox in kind of a larger"
context
"um mike i'm going to put this one to you"
"in a in an earlier conversation that we"
"had about xenobots before"
"the um the webinar today mike you said"
"that they forced us to acknowledge the"
"non-binary nature of science"
"as in xenobots are not fully what we"
"would consider a normal living organism"
"as josh pointed out they don't have"
brains
"they can replicate only for a few"
"generations and then they die out"
"but they're also certainly alive in that"
"they're composed of living frog cells"
"that are complete intact living cells"
"that match our definition of what a cell"
"needs to be to be alive and i thought"
"that was a very interesting statement"
because
"your background is in computer science"
"which is kind of which is based on"
"binaries um on code and things being and"
"and and or and not and things being very"
"clearly defined one way or the other"
"and you have also previously talked"
"about how you view"
"dna as akin to computer hardware and the"
"physiology of living cells more as the"
"software if we're mapping organisms onto"
"computers for this analogy so"
"how do you reconcile"
"the inherent messiness of nature"
"with what you've often described as the"
"idea that nature is programmable because"
"we have this hardware and software that"
"we are now learning how to play with"
"yeah well i think i think there are a"
"number of important ideas there uh"
"one one really important aspect of"
"zenobots and technologies like the"
"zenobots meaning uh chimeric types of"
"technologies um various things that"
"others are doing as well are really"
"asking us to take a deeper look at"
"terminology that we've taken for granted"
"so it used to be that things terms like"
"robot machine and so on it was very easy"
"to tell that apart from living things"
"because living things arose via an"
"evolutionary process robots come off a"
"factory robots are metallic they're"
"boring they are predictable and so on uh"
"these technologies uh are reminding us"
"that that those were never really good"
"categories to begin with they are they"
"were they were okay when we were dealing"
"with the limitations of of robotics and"
"the materials that we had and in the"
"biological case the sort of n equals one"
"example of the way that life progressed"
"through the tree of phylogeny on earth"
"and uh being able to make these kind of"
"novels so so all of the bioengineering"
"the synthetic morphology all of this"
"kind of work"
"reminds us that these categories uh are"
"much much softer than uh than we thought"
"they were and um"
"it's uh we are going to have to look for"
"for a deeper understanding of what it is"
"to be a robot or a machine that doesn't"
"uh rely on these uh very contingent"
"facts of what's it made of and how did"
"it get here right and so for the the way"
"where the hardware and software comes in"
"is in the amazing uh fact that uh"
"the the xenobots like like other"
"examples in biology what they're telling"
"us is that evolution seem more than just"
"generating specific solutions to"
"specific environmental problems what"
"what the genome"
"of any organism really encodes is a a"
"kind of a kind of process that can"
identify
"novel ways to be uh to be a a coherent"
"organism in novel circumstances they can"
"solve problems which they may never have"
"seen during the evolutionary process you"
"know these these zenobots are not a"
"normal part of of life of the frog or"
"its ancestors as far as we know and so"
"while the genome nails down the hardware"
"that every cell gets to have right so"
"the genome specifies the proteins that"
"every cell is going to have the actual"
"outcome of what collectives made of"
"those cells are going to do in specific"
"environments and manipulated in specific"
"ways as as directed for example by this"
"machine learning algorithm the outcome"
"of that is the result of all kinds of"
"cell to cell communications competition"
"cooperation um all of these interesting"
"aspects of a collective intelligence"
"that uh that solves problems"
"as as other people have been studying in"
"ant colonies and in swarm robotics and a"
"lot lots of other contexts so so that's"
"that's i think that's the important"
"distinction here it's it's not that"
"these things are like the kind of"
"computer with which most of us are"
"familiar that's that's not the point the"
"point is it's reprogrammable in the"
"sense that the the hardware spec that's"
"produced by the dna does not once and"
"for all nail down everything that a cell"
"is capable of so cells with a perfectly"
"normal frog genome yes by default they"
"make tapos and frogs but actually"
"they're capable of doing all kinds of"
"other interesting things and that's part"
"of understanding the software of life is"
"to get a better handle using this you"
"know very tractable very very"
"self-contained safe platform is to use"
"it to understand what are these active"
"subunits like cells like swarm robotics"
"like the internet of things what are"
"these things capable of in in"
"collections because we are all"
"confronting them in our life in other"
"aspects of life"
"yeah awesome that's that's great i love"
"what how you talked about um"
"the fact that the"
"the the hardware in the software and how"
"those terms actually do really map very"
"well to what we're trying to talk about"
"here without trying to understand"
"these living organisms and sort of"
"some of the advantages i think of"
"sort of existing what what you call"
"traditional robots or things like"
"hardware and software is that we know"
"how they work we made them um people"
"talk about code being a black box um"
"when it comes to artificial neural"
"networks but i think in general you know"
"that we kind of have a system for for"
"how how code is written and and how"
"these systems are built but when we're"
"trying to understand how nature works"
"there wasn't really a blueprint um it"
"was a lot of trial and error and as we"
"just as mike pointed out you might have"
"one set of of genes but you can build so"
"many different things and so many"
"different ways with those genes and how"
"does that happen and how is that"
"modulated um and so my next question is"
"for josh kind of bringing us back to"
"the the computational side of things um"
"i would say that the fact that we have"
"been able to build things like robots"
"and hardware and software"
"have allowed us to has given us kind of"
"a vocabulary and a way of understanding"
"life to the point where a lot of people"
"are trying to build"
"simulations of the human brain"
"out of computers and sort of thinking"
"about the brain as a collection of"
"circuits i think has really been a big"
"revolution in how people are now trying"
"to tackle that problem but i'm curious"
"to hear from your perspective the"
inverse
"how can using things like xenobots to"
"understand biology help to inform our"
"design of future"
"systems and robots and maybe even"
"computational platforms in ai"
"yeah that's a great question um the way"
"to sort of uh"
"draw inspiration from xenobots in"
"particular and biology in in general is"
"again to compare and contrast so if we"
"view the xenobots as robots and then"
"look at our current state-of-the-art"
"robots we can ask how do they act"
"differently um someone on the panel"
"mentioned that robots are not what"
"they're made from but what they do"
"xenobots act very differently from"
"traditional robots"
"one very clear difference is current"
"state-of-the-art robots and ai is very"
"easily fooled there was a great recent"
"example from a few weeks back in which"
"somebody wrote the word ipod on a piece"
"of fruit and presented that piece of"
"fruit to an ai and the ai was convinced"
"beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was"
"looking at an ipod rather than a piece"
"of fruit"
"it's kind of a humorous example but it"
"sort of points out one of the potential"
"limitations the potential danger of our"
"current ai technology i think um evil ai"
"like skynet"
"may be scary but what's even scarier is"
"an increasingly intelligent entity that"
"makes mistakes under certain conditions"
"and doesn't know that it's made mistakes"
"in contrast if you look at the the"
"xenobots they can't be fooled so easily"
um
"doug did a great experiment in one of"
"our earlier papers where even if"
"something surprising happens to the"
"xenobot like being cut almost in half"
"the injury is not surprising to the"
"cells that make up the xenobot"
"the cells somehow talk to one another"
"and figure out how to stitch uh the bot"
"back together again"
"so that tells us that in a.i and"
"robotics we need to try and make"
"machines built of machines built of"
"machines individual cells are themselves"
"more sophisticated sensor motor"
"machine sensor motor coordinated"
"machines or robots that are beyond the"
"capability of any existing robots"
"so if you build machines of machines of"
"machines then it's very unlikely that"
"the world is going to be able to"
"surprise all levels of this multi-level"
"machine at the same time"
"that's something that i've learned as a"
"roboticist from working with doug and"
"mike on the xenobots and i think it"
suggests
"how xenobots might blaze a new trail for"
"us towards trying to achieve both useful"
"and safe or not easily fooled"
ai
"next piece of this is"
"at the moment we've been sort of using"
"the ai to design xenobots from an"
"engineering point of view get the"
"xenobots to walk get the xenobots to"
"swim get the xenobots to replicate"
"one thing we're looking at doing in"
"future is trying to tell the ai to"
"design a xenobot for us that's"
"conceptually transparent that as the"
"xenobot goes about and does whatever it"
"does that it advertises to us its form"
"its internal function"
"and its adaptive behavior and if we can"
"see all of those three things form"
"internal dynamics and behavior happening"
"at the same time we might be able to"
"pull out increasingly subtle"
"mechanisms from biology and figure out"
"how to build those into useful and safe"
"ai and robots"
"that would be so cool"
"just to watch it"
"yeah just watching as you know about"
"doing things and have it tell you now"
"i'm doing this because i found this"
"thing or"
"i hit this i hit what i think is the"
"edge of the dish so now i'm turning"
"around that would be so cool um so i"
"have one more question for the panel and"
"then we will get to the questions that"
"our audience has been asking for the"
"last 36 minutes they are great um some"
"of them are very specific some of them"
"are very general so i'm excited to get"
"to those but my last question is going"
"to be"
"the same question that i'm going to ask"
"um all four of you and i'm going to let"
"you each answer um individually"
"this is the third paper that your team"
"has published about the xenobots"
"as josh hinted at the first paper was"
"published in 2020 only a year ago it's"
"hard to believe what is time um you"
"created the xenobots um and then in the"
"second paper you showed that they could"
"self-assemble from individual cells and"
"that they lived longer and that they"
"could record information"
"now they can replicate um so my question"
"for everybody is"
"what is next"
"for this team and for this project"
and
"what what aspect are you most excited"
"about and that can either be"
"in the immediate you know what what"
"insights are you hopeful the xenobots"
"will reveal to us or it can be down the"
line
"what could these things possibly be used"
"for um other than just really cool"
"delving into the the roots of of biology"
"so i'm going to just"
"go through the alphabet by last name so"
"doug we'll start with you"
"there there's there's two things i'm"
"interested in one is is very basic which"
is
"we're really sort of working with a very"
"small set of of a lego set right if you"
"think of all cells as different legos"
"we have a number of frog cells right now"
"but the the possibility of the different"
"types of cells that we could use to"
"examine the system like this"
"is is huge that space is quite big and"
"so i would love to see this move to"
"other types of organisms other cell"
"types and other environments and sort of"
"see the way that we could design"
"and learn about how these systems would"
behave
"and then on the more practical side i"
"really like this idea"
"of sort of understanding how to generate"
"or modulate goal-driven behavior so what"
"we see now is is a lot of sort of"
"spontaneous motion and emergent"
"behaviors and so if we could start to"
"program or dictate the way that these"
"move and sense stimuli and respond to"
"stimuli but you can start to get some"
"really interesting programmable"
"behaviors or guidable behaviors and we"
"can maybe talk down the line as a group"
"about how that would certainly be really"
"useful for biomedical and environmental"
"applications as we move forward"
"great thanks josh you're next"
"yeah i sort of answered your question"
"already i guess um as an ai researcher"
"i'm most interested in figuring out how"
"we can whisper in the ear of the ai"
"to get it to design new kinds of living"
systems
"we've seen recently ai design proteins"
"ai design drugs our group is tackling ai"
"designed biology and organisms how do we"
"get creative idea a creative ai to make"
"useful living systems that do what we"
"want and don't do what we don't want"
"them to do i think this is an open"
"challenge that's going to"
"involve many more"
"researchers on the ai and biology side"
"you're muted lindsay"
"wow sorry i got my alphabet mixed up and"
"thought it was mike but it's it's sam k"
"comes before l go ahead sam"
okay
"um so there are several motivations for"
"this work as we mentioned spanning"
"robotics and biology and there's several"
"uh different directions this work could"
"go um we can only uh maybe go down a few"
"of them but there are scientific"
"trajectories of interest like josh"
"mentioned learning more about"
"using ai to make the xenobots advertise"
"their underlying mechanisms so we can"
"learn more about developmental biology"
"there are philosophical"
"lines of inquiry that we can follow"
"what what is it like to be a xenobot"
"probably nothing right now it's like a"
"skin biopsy probably nothing more"
"if we start adding more sensory organs"
"that affect their actions as doug was"
mentioning
"at what point"
"does this become"
"intelligent as a tadpole"
"i don't know"
"those are interesting philosophical"
questions
"as a roboticist i really would like to"
"somehow create useful technologies with"
"with this xenobot platform"
and
"in robotics we've been very good"
"at making robots inside of highly"
"controlled factories where everything is"
"exactly where it needs to be"
"temperature humidity lighting is always"
"very very highly controlled and machines"
"are made to be super precise and we're"
"very good at making those machines and"
"they've revolutionized"
"those industries such as car manufacture"
"robots build our cars but they don't"
"build our skyscrapers and there's a key"
"difference there because skyscrapers are"
"built in the outside where there's all"
"kinds of unpredictable conditions in the"
"outside world and it's been a major"
"challenge in robotics to try to create"
"robots that are useful in the wild where"
"you can't predict what's going to happen"
"where there's surprising conditions as"
"josh mentioned"
"i don't know what the xenobots are going"
"to be able to do in the future right now"
"they're exceedingly simple"
"but they have a lot of properties that"
are
"inspiring and one of them is natural it"
"is not inspiring they're made of cells"
"there's not surprising they're made of"
"cells so they can bio degrade so if you"
"if we can control"
"the this system to do something useful"
"then that suggests that it would be able"
"to do something useful in the"
"environment without adding more"
"pollution it would just biodegrade"
"gracefully disappear and that's"
"something that's very exciting and i"
"hope that we can find a useful"
"application uh in environmental cleanup"
"jobs for example in the in the"
"near or mid future"
"sometime within my career"
"awesome things and we're going to end"
"with mike"
"i want to i want to uh shine a light a"
"little bit on uh the implications of"
"these kinds of technologies for a really"
"pressing need in uh in the human medical"
"and and veterinary world which is which"
"is the the incredible amount of"
"biomedical suffering that's out there"
"and it's it's it's kind of interesting"
"to think that uh with the exception of"
"uh infectious disease most medical"
"problems and we're talking about birth"
"defects traumatic injury aging cancer"
"degenerative disease all of these things"
"could be addressed in a really radical"
"way much much much more definitively"
"than is being addressed now if we have"
"the answer to one simple question which"
"is how do you get collective of cells to"
"build a specific thing that you want"
"them to build right and the real uh"
"ability to do this the ability to to"
control
"the outcomes of anatomy of structure and"
"function in cellular collectives is not"
"going to be solved alone by stem cell"
"biology or biogenomics it's going to"
"require not only understanding the"
"molecular mechanisms that are required"
"for interesting things to happen but"
"also the algorithms that are sufficient"
"for them to happen in other words the uh"
"the the kinds of information processing"
"that are required for this collective"
"intelligence of cells to build a complex"
"structure to build a different structure"
"under perturbations or in a new"
"environment to repair that structure we"
"really need to understand the um the the"
"kind of uh"
"intelligence of this process in the"
"sense of collective intelligence right"
"not not in a magical sense but in the"
"way that that it's being studied by by a"
"lot lots of people in uh in that field"
"and what the zenobots to me represent"
"are a really uh powerful platform to"
"begin to ask that question and to crack"
"that code that code leading from the"
"stimuli that you give to particular"
"cells to the final outcome what is it"
"that they make so that we can learn to"
"make all kinds of things and the end"
"result of this i think you know down the"
"line years years later the end result is"
"going to be a completely different sort"
"of regenerative medicine where we can"
"really address the need for complex"
"organs that we are not able to"
"micromanage from the ground up we're not"
"we're not going to be able to uh uh"
"anytime soon to be able to to build a"
"hand or you know"
"or something like that from from"
"individual uh individual cells directly"
"but we may be able to uh motivate or"
"convince a set of cells to build it the"
"way that it did once during"
"embryogenesis so that to me is is really"
"the the critical aspect of this"
"technology it's that the the"
"understanding of how it is that you"
"control the anatomical and the"
"structural outcomes of cellular"
collectives
"cool thank you so i'm going to now move"
"us into questions that the from the"
"audience um a lot of them"
"have been sort of addressed as we've"
"gone through the conversation um but one"
"of them that is"
"kind of building off mike what you were"
"just talking about for generative"
"medicine um sam talked about how it"
"might be possible to use the xenobots um"
"in kind of a or sort of a future"
"iteration of them um as a collective to"
"achieve things like going on in the"
"environment and and remediating sort of"
"performing tasks but when we're talking"
"about things that would be happening in"
"medicine in the human body"
"i'm imagining and just want to clarify"
"if you can clarify this if this is true"
"that the xenobots themselves would not"
"be sort of used for that but they would"
"they would generate the insights that we"
"need to then be able to go to a patient"
"and deliver the right messages to their"
"own cells so that the patient's body"
would
"do the thing that we want it to do but"
"the xenobots themselves we wouldn't"
"basically use them like"
"the proverbial nanobots that you inject"
"into someone's body and they build stuff"
"is that correct"
"well i i actually think both of those"
"are viable paths for future progress so"
"i think uh we can we can certainly"
"imagine once we get a better handle on"
um
"causing very specific creating very"
"specific kinds of bots with specific"
"functions you can certainly imagine them"
"uh either either micro sculpting some"
"sort of tissue in vitro for then"
"transplantation into patients or"
"possibly used uh in directly in patients"
"at some point to uh chase down tumor"
"cells or interact with bacteria in the"
"gut or to uh clean out arthritic knee"
"joints or to put down some sort of"
"pro-regenerative molecules uh i i think"
"it's definitely a possibility that these"
"are that these things are used directly"
"in medicine but i think the longer term"
"future is is the other thing that you"
"said which is to use them to understand"
"how it is that we get uh cells of the"
"body to execute repair uh you know"
"directly well i'm sure that a lot of"
"people would like to be able to you know"
just
"grow a new spleen grow a new kidney"
"that would certainly solve the organ"
"transplant problem we currently have"
"um another question from the audience"
"i'm going to give this one to doug"
"because it's about"
"the cells that the xenobots are built"
"from one person in the audience pointed"
"out that stem cells do differentiate"
"they usually don't stay stem cells"
"forever they become eyeballs or lungs or"
whatever
so
"do the stem cells that make up the"
"xenobots eventually differentiate into"
something
"and if not then i think you mentioned 10"
"to 14 days is when the cells kind of"
"fall apart but is that because the stem"
"cells are developing and getting out of"
"sync or do the stem cells not"
"differentiate in the xenobots"
"yes so so there's two separate answers"
"to this the stem cells that we use as"
"the feedstock so if you place loose stem"
"cells in the dish"
"those go through some small level of"
"differentiation and then die off they're"
"missing a lot of the signals that are"
"necessary from their immediate"
"environment and their neighbors to form"
"some sort of complex structure"
"differentiate effectively"
"the ones that make up the xenobots it"
"depends on"
"how the construction method you're"
"talking about so some of these have"
"uh muscle tissue"
"some of them have uh skin cells those"
"are pretty well characterized so it's"
"known that the developmental trajectory"
"this is work that's been done now for 20"
"years that leads you from being an"
"undifferentiated cell that has a fate to"
"become something on the outside of the"
"body into becoming one of the four or"
"five known cell types that make up frog"
"skin or tadpole skin"
"and so that process happens"
"automatically that's a built-in feature"
"of the system that as long as you keep"
"the physiological conditions correct and"
"keep the water correct this is an"
"emergent property that happens over"
"about three or four days of development"
"now that can be"
"pushed and pooled pretty effectively we"
"have molecular reagents pharmacological"
"reagents you can even use mechanical"
"strain to physically push and pull on"
"the cells and that can alter the"
"decisions that are made along this"
"trajectory and those are the types of"
"tools that we could use if we wanted a"
"more top-down approach to dictate"
"specific types of interactions between"
"the cells"
"great thank you next question from the"
"audience is for sam"
um
"can the xenobots replic self-replicate"
"without human intervention um the videos"
"indicate that they"
"um had to be first altered by cutting"
"out a small piece physically to make the"
"little pac-man mouth shape um so if the"
"xeno if the replication that we saw with"
"the pac-man shape is not possible"
"without the human interaction of of"
"cutting the xenobots into that shape can"
"we really call it self-replication"
"yeah that's a good question so no"
"there's there's still human intervention"
"here um if doug doesn't feed each"
"generation with more loose stem cells"
"from which to make piles"
"that become offspring then the system"
"stops replication terminates"
"that could be done by a machine"
"ostensibly but here it's doug so that's"
"human intervention"
"i think that"
"it might be a mistake to think"
"that self-replication is not self-driven"
"if it relies on the environment"
"and all replication relies on materials"
"and the environment is just which"
"materials they are and how small they"
"are and what they are in this case the"
"materials are cells we don't go down any"
"further than that and they happen to be"
"supplied by doug each generation but i"
"believe that could be automated"
but
"there is another part where the human"
"comes in uh i designed the ai program"
"that that was a human intervention but"
"these human interventions are minimal"
and
"and uh much of the process is automated"
"which is very interesting um from a"
"scientific perspective"
"in some ways again that is reassuring"
"that you still need to have a human"
"involved we're not going to have runaway"
xenobots
"anytime soon"
"next audience question is for josh"
"what level of complexity will xenobots"
"achieve at what point do you think you"
"will need a nervous system"
"and do you have plans of connecting the"
"xenobots to brain organoids or other"
"neuronal tissue so kind of combining"
"the biology and the computation there"
"yep that's a great question"
"you can probably guess that's on our"
"to-do list somewhere a list that grows"
"ever longer and um i think this again"
"relates back to"
"trying to get the ai to design xenobots"
"that uh that clarify the the biological"
"uh dark matter the things we don't"
"understand very well"
"what are the kinds of things that we"
"what kinds of tasks could we set for our"
"xenobots in which they're eventually"
"going to need brains"
"so we could obviously"
"put neurons in and see what happens but"
"alternatively we could pose a number of"
"challenges to them and see which ones"
"are tacklable by a neural xenobots those"
"lacking brains and which tasks are"
"tacklable by neural xenobots and if we"
"were to do those hypothetical"
"experiments that would give us unique"
insight
"on into the evolutionary pressures that"
favor
"nervous tissue the centralization of"
"sensation and action we have ideas we"
"have hypotheses but again these are"
"things we sort of dreamed up in a vacuum"
"would be great great to see if we could"
"design xenobots that tell us the"
"conditions where that actual where"
"brains are actually required and bodies"
"alone are no longer sufficient"
"well thanks my next question is for mike"
"this person says that they have been"
"following your work on"
"non-neural bioelectricity and they're"
"wondering if it's possible to"
bio-electrically
"manipulate the xenobots to get them to"
"assume a certain shape"
"in the in the current study all of them"
"were hand sculpted basically by doug but"
"could you use bioelectricity to inform"
"how they how they are shaped"
"yeah this is a great question that is"
"absolutely on our list uh we in the"
"future are going to be testing all sorts"
"of uh ways to manipulate the"
"conversations that these cells are"
"having with each other to uh that result"
"in specific structures and functions and"
"as you say many of those conversations"
"are electrical in nature and so i think"
"absolutely there's going to be"
"a really important place in tracking and"
"modifying the electrical information"
"processing in these cells to to achieve"
"specific programmable outcomes yeah"
cool
"next question um i'm going to make it a"
"popcorn question because i'm not sure"
"who is the most equipped to answer it"
"one person is wondering um are there any"
"specific biological design principles"
"that you all have identified through"
"your work with xenobots"
"i mean i guess i'll i'll take a go ahead"
"there okay i was just gonna say uh i"
"think what's what's interesting and and"
"for me so i have no robotics background"
"and i think"
"what's interesting for me is is i was"
"completely ignorant of this field just"
"with my own training and there are such"
"interesting design principles from these"
"other fields from artificial"
"intelligence from robotics that have not"
"effectively been integrated into biology"
"yet and so we think typically think"
"about biological design from the point"
"of view of what we see every day which"
"is organoids so you start with a cell or"
"an x plant and you regrow an organ but"
"this idea of rather than a single cell"
"that's synthetic"
"what if you could build from the ground"
"up could from from any possible shape"
"any possible design what would you build"
"how would that behave i think this is a"
"different way to think about assembling"
"multi-cellular agents and that"
"developmental techniques have not been"
"brought to bear on this question in any"
"meaningful way and so what we're seeing"
"is that these these fields it's really"
"nice to start to have a blender of these"
"techniques and and it's not really about"
"what is this what is that what is this"
"called how is this used it's really"
"these different tools for the jobs and"
"different ways to interrogate a"
"particular question"
"and so it's been really fun for me to"
"learn about design principles from these"
"other fields and sort of bring them into"
"the realm of biology and start applying"
"them to these questions"
"great thank you"
"i would say just to"
"build on doug's question from there from"
"the opposite side being somewhat naive"
"about biology"
"um i realize now in retrospect you know"
"we're building robots out of parts that"
"have been around for 3.5 billion years"
"and they've been attending the school of"
"hard knocks for all of that time"
"so you can rearrange them you can do all"
"sorts of things to them and they somehow"
"manage to find a way to form into some"
"stable higher level structure"
"that is completely missing from all of"
"our technology robotics ai computers"
"vehicles you rearrange the parts in your"
"car your phone and you have an"
"inoperative machine i think that is sort"
"of the one meta biological uh"
"uh organizational principle that i've"
"taken away from this work so far"
"yeah yeah and and building on building"
"on both of those concepts is this this"
"idea that what we have in biology is"
"this kind of uh multi-scale competency"
"where every level of organization is you"
"know everything is not simply made of"
"parts but each of those parts is"
"competent in solving"
"important problems in various spaces and"
"it it remains to be understood how taken"
"together that kind of architecture gives"
"this uh amazing plasticity where you"
"know these these cells that have evolved"
"for for for eons to to have a very"
"particular reliable behavior and turn"
"into a tadpole and so on uh under novel"
"circumstances they will figure out a way"
"to for example uh replica you know"
"self-replicate in an entirely novel way"
"that that they never had to do before so"
"this ability to solve new problems in"
"new environments in new ways is somehow"
"uh an an outcome of this of the"
"evolution tinkering with this"
"multi-scale architecture and that that i"
"think is is very powerful on both ends"
"we have to understand it both in biology"
"and on the computer science side"
"well thank you everybody and one thing"
"that i love about this team is"
"the different expertises that you all"
"have and how"
"as you've mentioned different you've"
"kind of come together to bring the"
"biological and the robotics and the"
"computational backgrounds together to"
"make these things that"
"i'm sure that anyone on any one field"
"anyone disciplined probably could never"
"have come up with but but here they are"
"we've seen them they're tooling around"
"dishes and now they're replicating and"
"i'm excited to see what they're going to"
"do in the future"
"so i'm going to invite josh brown"
"back on to close out the session"
"and we had so many great questions that"
"we unfortunately weren't able to answer"
"live on air um we will try to answer"
"them um in the days and weeks to come if"
"you want to put your questions on the"
"visa institute's youtube channel we are"
"going to be posting a copy not a copy a"
"recording of this video so if you have"
"specific questions you can leave them as"
"comments on our youtube page and we will"
"do our best to get answers to them um so"
"let's go ahead and turn it over to josh"
"other josh there are two josh's on the"
panel
"i like to think of myself as josh the"
"lesser um anyways thank you all so much"
"for this magnificent and insightful"
"conversation um especially thank you to"
"lindsay and the whole team there at the"
"visa institute at harvard for this um"
"terrific work and there's so many people"
"behind the scene that that pull science"
"together and pull events like this"
"together so thank you"
"to to you folks and thank you to this"
"science team it's a remarkable um"
"a line of work you're involved in a"
"remarkable team at the university of"
"vermont at tufts university at harvard"
"university working together to"
"to make this"
this
"set of insights and this path into a"
"really remarkable um"
"future so thank you all for this you've"
"been um you've been listening to"
"conversation about zenobots and the"
"study appears in the proceedings the"
"national academy of sciences"
"it's called kinematic"
"self-replication in reconfigurable"
organisms
"thanks all for listening in and as"
"lindsay said in the weeks and days ahead"
"we'll attempt to answer the various"
"questions that are coming in from around"
"the world so thanks all"
"for your thank you so much"
"thank you everybody thank you everyone"
you
