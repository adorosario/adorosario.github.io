"Michael Levin and Professor Arena Rish"
"enjoy Michael it's an absolute honor to"
"meet you"
"um you've got a very interesting"
"background now I discovered your work"
"when we did a show on emergence and I"
"was looking into graph cellular automata"
"actually and I was looking into that um"
"uh the the CNN version which did this"
"concept called morphogenetic engineering"
"which is this idea that you can almost"
"transgress ladders you know like levels"
"of the emergence ladder by um describing"
"something at the microscopic scale and"
"then getting this kind of emergent"
"Global coherence and in that particular"
"case it kind of emerged as as the shape"
"of a gecko I'm not sure if you're"
"familiar with that particular thing but"
"um so emergence is fascinating but"
"coming at it from from your angle in in"
"biology how do you see the interplay"
"between what you do in artificial"
intelligence
"well thanks very much I'm very happy to"
"be here and have the chance to talk to"
"you about these things uh a couple of"
things
"um I think that uh intelligence is uh"
"baked in basically at the very bottom of"
"uh the multi-scale architecture that we"
"have in living organisms and so what I"
"think is very powerful is this interplay"
"where we can of course use Ai and"
"machine learning to try to understand"
"the biology better and at the same time"
"we can take all these unconventional"
"examples of intelligence and cognition"
"that we find all the way down to"
"molecular networks and use them as"
"Inspirations for things that that we"
"build right either hybrid systems or or"
"fully engineered"
"systems and I think one of the key"
"things to say from my perspective is"
"that emergence is not the whole story so"
"I think emergence is very powerful and"
"emergence certainly happens and we have"
"many uh many many um scenarios in which"
"uh highly uh parallel active um"
"implementation of local Simple Rules"
"gives you some kind of complex emergent"
"outcome so we certainly see that but I"
"think the magic of biology isn't just"
"that I think uh the real magic of"
"biology is that at every level these are"
"not sort of feed forward emergent"
"processes where you follow the rules"
"something comes out and you know there"
"you go whatever comes out comes out I"
"think that um the key to understanding"
"the power of biology is that all of"
"these things at all scales are closed"
"loop goal directed in the cybernetic"
"sense not in a magical sort of"
"Supernatural sense but in the in the"
"cybernetic sense uh goal-directed agents"
"that are able to detect error from"
"specific set points and are doing their"
"best in terms of using energy and"
"sometimes actually very clever okay"
"their policies to achieve specific goals"
"and specific problem spaces and I think"
"scaling that up gets us to gets us much"
"farther than emergence alone"
"interesting excited I read a book by"
"Douglas hofstata called The Strange Loop"
"and he has this idea of all sorts of"
"interesting causal relations between the"
"scales and this is something that I find"
"it a bit difficult to get my head around"
"so you know the mind for example is an"
"emergent phenomenon and we have this"
"thing called agency and I I direct my"
"hand and I tell my hand to move but if"
"everything does emerge from the lower"
"level domain how does that work how do"
"you get these feedback mechanisms yeah"
"well a couple of things uh first of all"
"uh you know this this notion of um"
"uh reducibility to the lower to the"
"lower level so so from for a really long"
"time for centuries this was a"
"philosophical debate in that people"
"could argue uh there were there were"
"reductionists and they would say well"
"ultimately everything's reducible and"
"people would say not out there's strong"
"emergence and things happen at the top"
"um the amazing thing to me is that this"
"debate has been actually moved from the"
"area of philosophy to the area of"
"mathematics and rigorous science by"
"people like Julio tanoni and Eric Hull"
"who have actually uh produced uh new"
"advances in information Theory where you"
"can actually calculate which level of"
"your system does the most work it is no"
"longer up for philosophical debate you"
"can actually do the calculation so there"
"are literally"
"um there's a software toolkit that you"
"can use and for a given and sometimes"
"you will find out that yes indeed it is"
"reducible to the lower level and if for"
"other systems you find out that actually"
"know the higher levels do more work more"
"causal work than the lower levels and"
"this has been this has been obvious in"
"in biology I think for for a really long"
"time because we as a we as scientists"
"and Engineers other organisms and in"
"fact The evolutionary process itself uh"
"uses higher level"
"um control knobs exploits them uh very"
"very significantly the kind of things"
"that we we for example study is membrane"
"voltage so resting potential is a kind"
"of aggregate coarse graining of of the"
"positions of the individual ions but you"
"get much further in terms of"
"regenerative medicine and other"
"applications if you track the voltage"
"not the molecular details of the ions it"
"actually it actually helps you do new"
"experiments produce Therapeutics uh by"
"tracking this this high level thing that"
"that that a reductionist might say well"
"it doesn't even exist in the first place"
"so I think so I think these higher"
"levels absolutely have have causal power"
"and the way that I would put this"
"strange Loop idea and I think I think"
"you know hofstetter has many kind of"
"ingenious Concepts in his various books"
"um the way the way I would put the"
"strange Loop ideas like this"
"many of the things we are interested in"
"so so memory cognition"
"um uh all all these kinds of things in"
"in my framework I have a particular"
"framework for thinking about these"
"things and my framework are Observer"
"dependent so when you have a particular"
"system the claim that it occupies some"
"level along this this Continuum of"
"agency and I do think it's a Continuum"
"it's not binary uh the claim that it"
"occupies some particular"
"um place along that Continuum is an"
"observer relevant relative claim in"
"other words it's not an objective fact"
"about it it's it's here's an observer"
"that Observer can formulate some some"
"particular model of this thing um uh as"
"a as a as a cognitive agent at some"
"level of sophistication there's a"
"different Observer that has a different"
"model and each of them can interact with"
"that system well or poorly to the extent"
"that their model allows and so where you"
"get the uh where you get the Strange"
"Loop is that the Observer which is"
"necessary to Define all you know things"
"like problem spaces and the goals these"
"are all Observer dependent The Observer"
"might be the system itself so so when"
"you get the real the real boot up of"
"agency comes when the system becomes its"
"own Observer and starts to make internal"
"models of its own parts and and models"
"that help it uh control itself in its"
"own in its own lower levels where the"
"higher levels start to control the lower"
levels
"yes and that's somewhat reminiscent of"
"Carl Frist and he has his free energy"
"principle in the concept of a Markov"
"blanket and being able to predict"
"external States probabilistically but"
"yeah there's two things you said there"
"so first of all"
"um this notion of things at different"
"levels of the emergence ladder doing"
"different amounts of work and that"
"suggests to me a kind of form of strong"
"emergence which is an affront on"
"physicalism so um I wondered if you"
"could pick up on on that and the other"
"thing you said in terms of this Observer"
"relative thing that gets rather to this"
"kind of ultra relativistic or even you"
"know like in the wiccanstinian sense of"
"or the Putnam sense that you can take"
"any computation represent it in any"
"physical system and the kind of the"
"meaning of that computation is in its"
"use so it doesn't really have any agency"
"or valence in of itself"
"uh yeah yeah so"
"um I think that uh well the so so the"
"first question first I guess"
"um it's only an affront on physicalism"
"if you assume from the beginning that"
"physicalism has to be ultimately"
"reductive so I I I don't believe that to"
"be the case and so I'm I'm okay with"
"with a certain kind of physicalism that"
does
"um that does real Justice to the fact"
"that uh and they think you know Ian"
"mcgilkray says this he says uh you know"
"a lot of physicalists under uh really"
"really underestimate matter matter is"
"amazing and it does some amazing things"
"and when you say wow that can't be you"
"know matter the you know that that can't"
"just be matter you're not understanding"
"what what matter is actually capable of"
"and I think if we uh take seriously the"
"fact that yeah it can be matter and also"
"higher levels of organization can do"
"work that is not Apparent at lower"
"levels I think that's totally compatible"
"um and I'm sorry I forgot what was the"
"second part"
yeah
"yeah I think I think that I think that's"
"that's pretty necessary I think that"
"gets you very far actually because uh a"
"lot of times we get stuck in these"
"pseudo problems when you try to make"
"objective claims"
"um about this area you get into real"
"problems where that that resolve once"
"you specify from whose Vantage Point are"
"these things true or false and so you"
"get into this Observer relativity but I"
"think it's really really critical to say"
"that the system itself is also a valid"
"Observer so it's not just that well you"
"have no meaning of your own it's up to"
"us to interpret you I mean we can"
"interpret you but you can also interpret"
"yourself and you you're not dependent on"
"you're not dependent on external"
"observers to Define these things for you"
"you are also a bona fide Observer but I"
"do think and this is work that we've"
"done with Chris Fields"
"um the role of an observer in all of"
"these things I think in the end is is"
"really critical"
"wonderful um Arena thank you so much for"
"joining us today"
"thank you and uh yeah really good to see"
"both of you and I'm also looking forward"
"to uh seeing Michael's talk at their"
"workshop that we're running next week at"
"the triple a conference"
"so uh yeah I enjoyed a bit late uh so"
"where is there the questions you were"
"kind of discussing well I just caught"
"the last one"
"uh anything"
"well um so we just did um I'm really"
"interested in the um the rungs of the"
"emergence ladder and how different rungs"
"do different amounts of work they have"
"complex cause or relationships between"
"them is it in a fun and a front on"
"physicalism and reductionism and we're"
"also talking about this very slippery"
"notion of agency and where do you draw"
"the boundary and if if you can draw a"
boundary
"yeah I mean yeah I was I was saying that"
"I I I don't even think that it's"
"primarily an emergence uh Continuum I"
"think that it's uh well like I call it a"
"persuadability Continuum but it's"
"basically it really is a Continuum of"
"agency and I don't think there are any"
"sharp boundaries I think sharp"
"categories are what we as observers"
"bring to an underlying continuous"
"phenomenon and we can we can try to"
"impose categorical boundaries on things"
"that make it easier for us to do"
"specific things but the underlying"
"phenomena I think are are completely"
continuous
"I I do agree with that and yet"
um
"there is a notion of transitions in"
"certain metrics of behavior I'm talking"
"purely from kind of practical examples"
"saying behavior of large-scale"
"um say AI systems neural networks so we"
"know and that's been observed recently"
"so that was say scaling the amount of"
"data or model you might for a while"
"still not be able to do certain tasks"
"well and then at some particular kind of"
"critical size something happens and"
"model suddenly like grogs it so this"
"grocking Behavior have been observed"
"over and over in the past like year and"
"so in large scale machine learning"
"models which is essentially kind of"
"emergence of certain ability"
"and well I mean it is still continuous"
"but there is a change in the slope and"
"the change can be quite dramatic yeah"
"yeah so yeah so in a sense it also"
"resonates with other examples where"
"transitions were happening uh in AI but"
"not necessarily in machine learning"
"going all the way back to good old like"
"uh satisfability problems or constraint"
"satisfaction problems uh in general even"
"other it'd be hard problems like"
"discrete problems where you might have a"
"network of variables or nodes that can"
"take different values and you're trying"
"to basically increase their density in"
"terms of number of constraints and see"
"what happens and the property of being"
"satisfiable problem to unsatisfiable"
"changes continually but that probability"
"experiences sharp drop at certain"
"critical value of say number of"
"constraints and the system divided by"
"the number of variables so this"
"constrainedness plays a role of critical"
"parameters similar to critical"
"parameters such as temperature or"
"pressure in physical systems which"
"undergo like uh"
"state of matter transitions with our"
"water to solid and vice versa and"
"similar like thermagnetics when the"
"temperature increases and the"
"ferromagnetic basically stops being"
"magnetic and the analogy was made in"
"some cases quite clearly with those AI"
"problems at their properties and those"
"transitions in them it's also kind of"
"relates closely to like random graph"
"Theory there is a famous old ethereum by"
"fried good kalai that if you consider"
"random graph and say p is probability"
"that there is an edge in that graph and"
"that probability keeps increasing when"
"it's zero the graph is fully"
"disconnected no Links at all if it's one"
"everything is connected it's complete"
"graph in the middle"
"say if you look at connectedness of a"
"graph as a property what's the"
"probability that from any point you can"
"get to any other point and there is a"
"pass that's what means graph is"
"connected that property is probability"
"again sharply goes from zero to one"
"around certain critical value of that"
"parameter and then any other property"
"what was the duty of that result any"
"property doesn't have to be connectivity"
"that's monotonic in age addition welfare"
"phase transition so though it's"
"continuous change"
"the shape of it is highly non-linear"
"yeah yeah so that's super interesting"
"and of course of course there are many"
"phenomena in in physics and and in math"
"that that show this kind of non-linear"
"change and that's fine"
"um I'm interested in how sharp it really"
"is and and in particular in the cases"
"that you talked about because what"
"happens in biology is that uh people"
"will sort of they look at the adult and"
"or let's say a human and they say okay"
"this human has true cognition and you"
"know real real you know hopes and dreams"
"and whatnot then they look at the at the"
"one cell and you know one cell AG at"
"fertilization they say wow that's just a"
"chemical system and so the theory is"
"that at some point right so people"
"assume that at some point there's some"
"sort of phase transition and a lot of"
"people will talk about this phase"
"transition but if you really uh dig into"
"this and ask them to specify so so what"
"is that phase transition right so so in"
"biology at least in that and the same"
"thing happens in evolution on The"
"evolutionary time scale I have never"
"heard a plausible story of where is it"
"so so at this moment boom so it's so"
"that that that thing moved from here to"
"there ah now we have this like crazy you"
"know large transition and it's it's"
"actually quite smooth even though people"
"tend to assume there must be some kind"
"of face transition and so I wonder just"
"out of curiosity because I'm not super"
"familiar with the examples that you're"
"talking about if you were to zoom in"
"right so let's just magnify it so so"
"clearly you have some sort of sigmoid so"
"now we're sort of zooming in"
"how sharp is it actually is there an"
"atomic operation where I add one Edge to"
"this graph and Bam now now I'm somewhere"
"else like how sharp is it really uh yeah"
"so just like phase Transitions and"
"statistical physics uh the sharpness"
"increases with the size of the system"
"say you have any finite size graph"
"transition is value or sigmoid when you"
"grow the size of this graph say you grow"
"that satisfability problem or whatever"
"uh the transition becomes sharper and"
"sharper so in the limit when the system"
"is infinite that basically the exponent"
"diverges hmm yeah so it is getting"
"sharper so yeah in in empirical results"
"people were kind of doing in constraint"
"distraction problems satisfability"
"problems while ago and random graphs"
"that was happening indeed so as"
"essentially in similar physical system"
"sharpness depends on their"
"size of the model and or the number of"
"I don't know units particles variables"
"nodes while the critical parameter is"
"another thing uh and uh at the same"
"value of the critical parameter like for"
"example ratio between constraints and"
"variables uh the transition happens and"
"then all the pictures indeed were that"
"you see sharper and sharper and sharper"
"for increasing number of variables in"
"that problem so in a sense"
"yeah it behaved pretty much just like it"
"was supposed to behave with certain"
"physical phenomena uh like uh yeah"
"phases of"
"states of matter for example or"
"paramagnetics like icing models yeah so"
"yeah it's not always like that I'm not"
"saying uh well of course people try to"
"exercise caution when they see rapid"
"Improvement in uh performance of machine"
"learning models for example gpt3 or one"
"particular tasks like arithmetic it was"
"observed that while on"
"other tasks and just on measuring how"
"the loss function during training"
"behaves it's used to be like quite"
"common to observe power loss and that"
"was a famous Chariot couplings and his"
"colleagues from openai paper around them"
"basically the scaling laws behavior in"
"the language models and then they found"
"in other modalities anyway so it's a"
"whole field uh Power laws kind of ruled"
"for a year or so and then people started"
"digging into more complex behaviors"
"because for certain tasks like as I said"
"arithmetic or any"
"discrete operation that can be described"
"as a table uh people discovered that"
"cgpt3 may not do that task well until"
"certain size and after certain"
"size of the model it rapidly improves"
"its performance another example was that"
"so-called grocking paper also it was in"
"the IC guy clear workshop and paper I"
"think was from open AI where they by"
"mistake just left model running and"
"training on the data multiple books so"
"they were not really scaling model or"
"data but just let it run so compute was"
"growing and it wasn't doing well the"
"accuracy was kind of low and at some"
"point it suddenly later on they saw when"
"they looked at their uh process they"
"forgot to kill they looked at it kind of"
"grogged the problem and at some point it"
"suddenly improved uh first training loss"
"and then test loss now there are"
"multiple groups very actively kind of"
"studying this phenomenon we got very"
"interested back in there I guess"
"September 2021 and submitted the paper"
"just now"
"um max tag Mark's group worked on that"
"and they have some papers now"
"um Jacob steinhardt from Berkeley they"
"just had accepted paper at the clear so"
"anyway people very much got interested"
"in groking Behavior not necessarily this"
"specific example but in general when"
"parameter of Interest which might be"
critical
"increases on the x-axis it could be a"
"compute data size model size perhaps"
"something else and then you have"
"whatever performance metric on y-axis it"
"could be accuracy could be loss could be"
"something else and trying to understand"
"when those sharp changes may happen and"
"how sharp they are so so we recently"
actually
"got this paper at like clear of his my"
"collaborators with the first author is"
"Ethan kabalera in the shitish Gupta is"
"uh second order and uh anyway that"
"basically trying to fit all these"
"Strange Behaviors with one functional"
"form it's so-called broken neural"
"scaling gloss paper because it's much"
"richer Behavior than previously assumed"
"just power loss and those sharp"
"transitions or not so sharp transitions"
"are but transitions may happen anyway so"
"it's a bit maybe of tangent it's about"
"is there a one functional form to"
"capture them all but what I'm trying to"
"say those behaviors keep happening there"
"is a paper I guess from Stanford like"
"emerging behaviors and language models"
"and they show many many empirical"
"examples of when this type of Behavioral"
"change happens"
"needless to say people are very"
"interested in well you don't have to"
"call that emergent Behavior but people"
"interested in"
"um unexpected changes in performance or"
"other metrics which may relate to like"
"AI safety alignment like truthfulness of"
"this system robustness of the system or"
"any other property of Interest so it"
"would be really interesting to"
"understand better"
"when and why Behavior may change so this"
"broken neural Skilling gloss was just"
"trying to do it as a black box looking"
"at the system from outside and trying to"
"statistically predict where it happens"
"but many people also look inside trying"
"to understand what dynamics of solutions"
"can possibly lead to and can allow you"
"to predict what's about to happen so"
"actually our studies it seems to be"
"related to certain oscillation"
"frequencies in the training laws but you"
"might be able to tell from the beginning"
"of the run for given initialization of"
"system if it's going to grow or not"
"which is good to know yeah I know I"
"think I think it's I think it's super"
"interesting and and of course uh the the"
"I mean I'm not doubting that these"
"things exist I what I don't know is to"
"what extent these are good models for"
"what goes on in the biology because the"
"biology seems to be quite continuous"
"right so these may be two different two"
"different ways to to look at this and"
"um and also my sort of big the the"
"reason I emphasize that the continuity"
"is not that I want to minimize the"
"importance of um great transitions"
"because I do think of course there are"
"great transitions uh in behavior"
"um I what I want to do is emphasize the"
"continuity of substrate because because"
"a lot of uh do the discourse you know"
"the the the the the human does this and"
"the human does that and they say okay so"
"so which which kind of human like how"
"far back and you can do this in in"
"evolutionary scale you can do it in"
"developmental scale right but eventually"
"you you follow the human back and you"
"end up with a single cell and we just"
"have to deal with the fact that there is"
"no magic bright line that somebody can"
"draw okay Boom at this at this point in"
"embryonic development like that's it now"
"and is and so and so what we have to"
"understand of course there can be there"
"can be um uh uh uh non-monatonic uh you"
"know non-linear changes and all that but"
"but it but but but it's a transformation"
"of the exact same substrate it isn't it"
"isn't something magical that gets added"
"at some particular point that and then"
"everything so so I'm you know I'm sort"
"of all about that aspect of continuity"
"it doesn't have to be linear per se but"
"but we have to come to grips people who"
"think that that it's crazy to attribute"
"you know they say it's anthropomorphic"
"to attribute"
"um certain kinds of uh cognitive uh"
"claims to a single cell they owe a story"
"a very specific story of how you get"
"from a single cell to a human you can't"
"simply say that well you know uh there's"
"some magic that happens in the middle"
"you actually have to lay out uh what is"
"it what what's the you know what's the"
"face transition actually and people sort"
"of assume there is one but I've never"
"heard of one I've never heard of a good"
"one and so so it's quite interesting to"
"me that these that these do come up in"
"the in the um in the machine learning"
"world that's interesting that needs to"
"come up but there is still"
"country because yeah I mean you"
"essentially well to some extent that the"
"x-axis is well not exactly maybe"
"absolutely continually growing the size"
"but for all practical purposes so the"
"curves are usually always continuous"
"there is no discontinuous jumps but"
"continuity with kind of different indeed"
"uh speed of development dosing change"
"and uh yeah but I I basically agree with"
"your point completely that there is no"
"magic Source or ingredient well unless"
"you believe in divine intervention or"
"something like that but yeah if you kind"
"of keep this hypothesis as more"
"complicated and prefer simpler based on"
"just Things You observe then indeed"
"there is"
"there is Continuum of intelligence"
"from human and back to the cell but then"
"of course a good question is like if you"
"start decomposing cell and go deep dive"
"inside yeah then what so so yeah so so"
"we and other people have have looked at"
"this and in fact if you look at"
"something as as"
"ostensibly uh mechanical as a gene"
"regulatory Network right so you just"
"look at a model of genes into turning"
"each other on and off uh we and and"
"others have shown that that kind of"
"thing is capable of six different kinds"
"of learning including associative"
"conditioning just just from the"
"dynamical systems properties of the"
"Eugene regular regulation nothing else"
"so there are and now I was just looking"
"today there is apparently a literature"
"on um"
"chemotaxis in individual molecules and"
"right I I mean I mean uh some of these"
"things but I think the individual"
"molecules right and so and and then you"
"can go below that and the kind of stuff"
"that we've we've done with Carl friston"
"and Chris fields and really start"
"looking at very fundamental particle"
"interactions as having the sort of"
"extremely kind of primitive levels of uh"
"non-zero competencies so so that's it's"
"a really good question right if you have"
"a Continuum so the question is there a"
"zero right is there is there anything"
"right and you know and and Chris and I"
"are talking is not intelligent yeah yeah"
"no it's a that's a great question so so"
"Chris and I have talked about this and"
"um because because my claim is is this"
"if you think about what would the"
"absolute minimum of intelligence look"
"like right like what's the what's what's"
"the absolute minimum and so to me I I"
"would if I had to come up with the"
"absolute minimum I would I would lean on"
"two things I would say I would say the"
"first thing is uh some level of uh of"
"goal directedness some ability to pursue"
"a particular outcome out of a set of"
"other outcomes and we have this in least"
"action principles in in even in"
"particles and then and then some level"
"of indeterminacy such that local"
"conditions don't fully determine what"
"this thing is going to do and we have"
"that in particles and so I would claim"
"that it doesn't actually bottom out at"
"zero even at the atomic scale and so I"
"said to Chris one day um could we have a"
"world with no leased action laws that"
"where where it literally would be zero"
"and he his he what he said was uh yes"
"but it would have to be a universe in"
"which nothing ever happened so it would"
"have to be a completely static universe"
"that one one the in which things happen"
"you're going to be able to to derive"
"some sort of"
"um least action kind of thing which"
"looks like the basement of cognition to"
me
"yeah very interesting"
so
"it was always kind of an open question"
"how to"
"link this to what people are say doing"
"right now developing uh like artificial"
"neural networks and those systems uh"
"basically how that would translate in AI"
"domain what would it mean for this"
"modeling like can we indeed well I mean"
"I think people did try to Define"
"intelligence and its units although"
"it's not something that people commonly"
"use like I I wouldn't claim that there"
"were no such attempts but nevertheless"
"I mean we still not"
"really doing that uh and uh here and"
"there people say well probably should be"
"measuring uh more formally what we want"
"from our model in terms of intelligence"
"and what how those things compare and"
"can you say that it's as intelligent as"
"like that type of the organism or this"
"or yeah so some"
"basically making this whole engineering"
"field a bit more of a"
"science like well physics or even"
"biology in terms of"
"in order to make claim that something is"
"intelligent would be at least good to"
"Define it more formally"
"again going back to physics and have"
some
"notion of units or something so you can"
"say that in that units you can say this"
"is larger than that yeah yeah yeah so so"
"something like predictive accuracy of"
"models can be a proxy for that"
"yeah um so Chris and I tackled this in a"
"in a recent paper is starting off with"
"the idea that making claims about"
"something the intelligence of something"
"is really taking an IQ test ourselves"
"because you have to be smart enough to"
"to to to to to to pick a problem space"
"and identify the the uh the degree of"
"cleverness of the policy that the system"
"is following in that space and and and"
"you may not see it right it's not"
"obvious that we can always detect it and"
"so in biology we are very used to seeing"
"mid-sized objects moving at medium"
"speeds in three-dimensional space and"
"saying oh look you know look at what"
"that Crow is doing that's intelligent"
"but there are other spaces right so"
"physiological space metabolic space is a"
"transcriptional space um anatomical"
"amorphous space which my lab studies uh"
"cells and tissues do amazing things in"
"those spaces that are absolutely if if"
"that if they they navigate those spaces"
"in a way that if we had a robot or an"
"autonomous vehicle doing that this would"
"be off the charts uh performance and and"
"and and it's not in the fee it's not in"
"the domain of classical"
"three-dimensional Behavior it's it's"
"behavior in these other spaces and"
"learning to recognize that is very hard"
"for us because as humans all of our"
"sense organs sort of tend to point"
"outwards if you had a if you had an"
"innate feeling of your blood chemistry"
"you would know without a doubt that your"
"liver and your kidneys were intelligent"
"because you could you would see how they"
"navigate that space you would directly"
"feel it the way that we currently see"
"each other in Africa and say Ah that's"
"pretty clever you know so so so the"
"right so so so what we try to do is to"
"lay out"
"um and this was this was it goes back to"
"like the 40s you know Weiner and"
"rosenbluth had this the scale right of"
"of from all the way from passive"
"materials all the way up to second order"
"like um you know metacognition and"
"whatnot and everything in between the"
"kinds of competencies that different"
"systems have in navigating these spaces"
"and one way to do it is uh and I I"
"repeat this quote a lot and I wish I"
"could remember who said it but somebody"
"said this it's it's the Continuum"
"between the way the two magnets try to"
"get together and how Romeo and Julia try"
"to get together right what's the"
"difference the difference is in the"
"degree of ability to overcome obstacles"
"along the way so so you can be extremely"
"simple and all you know how to do is go"
"down an energy gradient and magnets can"
"can do that or you can be extremely"
"complex and be able to but in the middle"
"there's all this there's all this stuff"
"right and so you can kind of start and"
"and we this is what we do experimentally"
"we put these systems in ways where we"
"start to challenge their normal behavior"
"and we find very surprising thing things"
"that we that people always thought were"
"like hardwired and and just sort of uh"
"you know this is well of course this is"
"you know it's it's all it knows how to"
"do is things rolling downhill and that's"
"it once you start to challenge it with"
"various perturbations then you get to"
"find out what it actually knows how to"
"do and then you can form specific"
"hypotheses does it you know how far"
"ahead can it plan does it see does it"
"have a memory does it you know you can"
"but the way you find out is by"
"challenging all these things and you"
"know like um like the frog face example"
"and and and many other things you find"
"you you you find out that these things"
"are actually way more clever than than"
"they seem at first you know"
"yeah I definitely remember"
"how you gave the talk in December 2013"
"that in Europe's World bodies think"
"about and the message to people studying"
"neural networks that"
"yeah intelligence was there way before"
"the first neuron appeared so"
"maybe we should look but still the"
"common part was networks they doesn't"
"have to be neural they don't have to be"
"neural but like essentially I I do"
"remember all these experiments were"
"essentially about changing the network"
"communication so that their organism as"
"a whole or the part of it"
"changes its form to whatever you kind of"
"wanted it to be but I think even if we"
"scratch neurals from that"
"the key essence of"
"kind of phenomenon will be always"
Network
"I mean I would I would yes but I would"
"extend that to say that it can't be a"
"single level of of um of organization"
"right so so in biology the trick is that"
"every network is a network of networks"
"and each one is as goal directedness so"
"every every level is trying to"
"accomplish specific things in specific"
"spaces and they all cooperate or compete"
"with each other so uh you know this this"
"is another talk that I give sometimes"
"why it's called why robots don't get"
"cancer right why why don't why don't our"
"robotics get cancer and and and and it's"
"it's because they're not made of parts"
"that have the capacity to go off on"
"their own and do their own thing in"
"biology every single part is basically"
"being held against its will by the level"
"above so everything if you were to just"
"like release the top levels goal"
"directedness the parts would go off and"
"do other things and sometimes they do"
"and then we get phenotypes like cancer I"
"I remember really well though I've had"
"this uh five hour discussion in the IBM"
"research cafeteria in Yorktown a few"
"years ago and yeah really it's a very"
"insightful making analogy between kind"
"of their cell going cancers or coming"
"back to its senses and essentially the"
"notion of at what scale the objective of"
"the cell to survive and thrive is"
"applied because yeah if you single cell"
"in the environment you treat it as a"
"source of food it's environment right"
"yeah but if you become part of the"
"organism yeah you're under pressure to"
"behave in the best interest of organism"
"if you forget about that due to changes"
"in your communication with other members"
"of organism Society then you start"
"acting uh selfishly and too bad that's"
cancer
"could I could I put a quick question to"
"you Michael because you've I'm very"
"interested in the definition of"
"intelligence and you're saying words"
"like uh goal directedness"
"um agents planning and these terms are a"
"little bit anthropomorphic but you could"
"argue that they are Universal Primitives"
"and you're also talking along the lines"
"of Intelligence being almost like uh I"
"mean some people describe it as as"
"capability or with an underlying"
principle
"but it's almost like it's a Continuum"
"and there are people who believe that"
"humans are special we think you know the"
"behaviorists thought that it was just a"
"very simple stimulus response the"
"monkeys don't have a flash of"
"inspiration they don't plan how to get"
"the banana we have something different"
"what do you think"
"well uh I I I'm I'm I'm I'm certainly"
"not saying that we don't think or that"
"there is no material difference between"
"us and and let's say a paramecium so the"
"the differences are of course real I I I"
"insist on one thing and then and then I"
"have hypotheses about our other stuff"
"the thing that I insist on is that uh"
"when we make a"
"um a claim about the level of cognition"
"of some system real artificial you know"
"it evolved artificial whatever"
"you cannot make those claims from an"
"armchair you have to do experiments and"
"so you cannot have feelings about these"
"things people say to me all the time oh"
"well you know with xenobots well it's"
"frogsky and that can't XYZ you know you"
"name it whatever it can and say well how"
"did you arrive at this conclusion you"
"cannot just have feelings about this"
"stuff you have to do experiments and"
"when you do experiments as we found and"
"and other people have found you get"
"surprised because it is not obvious uh"
"what the capabilities of something is"
"until you start to perturb it and see"
"what happens and the thing and and to to"
"to find out so so in order to make an"
"intelligence claim you need a couple"
"things you need to pick a space within"
"which you think it's solving problems"
"right so so you as the Observer have to"
"make have to say I think this is the"
"space in which it works then you have to"
"say here is the goal I think this thing"
"is pursuing in a cybernetic sense and"
"then you have to say and now I have a"
"hypothesis about how clever this is what"
"can it do can it go around obstacles is"
"it Trap by local Minima does it have"
"path history does it have this that you"
"make some sort of some sort of claim"
"having made those three claims we can"
"then empirically see how well does that"
"work out for you what does that enable"
"you to do and so then then multiple"
"observers so so someone can come along"
"and say you're crazy this thing doesn't"
"have any of that somebody else can say"
"oh no it's actually much more clever"
"than that and then we all interact with"
"the system and we see who wins it's in a"
"it's a it's it's an empirical question"
"that has to be put so the only thing"
"that that I insist on is that uh this"
"charge of anthropomorphism"
"um it has to be quite specific we have"
"to make a specific claim what do we"
"think this thing is able to do and then"
"we get to find out is is that a useful"
"lens onto the system or not"
"okay but just a quick follow-up I mean"
"what what is it because a goal feels"
"like it's a wicked form of reductionism"
"along the lines of we what we were"
"talking about before and even it because"
"you know Shane Legg has this idea that"
"the definition of intelligence is an"
"agent being able to solve a variety of"
"tasks in different environments and so"
"on and and even if there were such a"
"goal why would it be intelligible to us"
"uh I I don't believe that there is an"
"objective goal that is intelligible in"
"the sense that we get to discover it"
"once and for all and then we're done I"
"think that when when somebody says uh"
"that this system has a particular goal"
"what they're saying is they have"
"discovered a a lens a perspective on the"
"behavior such that"
"um positing that it has a goal and some"
"set of competencies to reach that goal"
"gives you increased ability to predict"
"and control that system so so so so here"
"so so we come across the thermostat and"
"um you look at this thing and uh you"
"know you're you're a reductionist then"
"you say well okay uh I can sort of"
"calculate uh what what all the particles"
"are doing and that's great and I look at"
"it and say hmm I see this and this and I"
"think this is the set point and you say"
"there's no such thing as a set point"
"there's just atoms in the thing and I"
"say well well here's the thing though I"
"I will exert much less energy and effort"
"in changing the temperature of the room"
"while you're running around pushing on"
"all the individual you know atoms that"
"of this thing I'm just going to change"
"the set point and let the thing take"
"care of itself so so the level of what"
"what it affords you is a a more powerful"
"level of relationship to the system for"
"simple systems that's prediction and"
"control for complex systems that may be"
"uh everything from from training to"
"Friendship to who knows you're right for"
"complex system what we're looking at is"
"um what level of agency gives me the"
"best interaction with the system and I"
"can I can guess too high right if I'm"
"standing there arguing you know pleading"
"with my thermostats you know here are"
"all the reasons you should change like"
"that's not going to work and at the same"
"time if if I have a a system that's a"
"that's a learning agent like you know a"
"horse or a dog uh humans thousands of"
"years ago figured out that you don't"
"need to know the Neuroscience of what's"
"between their ears you can train the"
"thing and right so so you found an"
"interface that that that allows you to"
"do amazing things because you understood"
"that this is not the same as as a"
"complex as you know set of bowling balls"
"that you would have to engineer bottom"
"up so so that that's all these things"
"are just meant to be I don't I I don't"
"believe there's anything that I don't"
"believe there's any such thing as"
"anthropomorphism anthropomorphism sounds"
"to me like we're still working with a"
"Garden of Eden story that that you've"
"got a human the human has this magic"
"glow about them and trying to uh uh sort"
"of sort of shade that into other things"
"is is a you know is a major"
"transgression I don't buy it I think"
"that what you have to do is you have to"
"make very specific claims this human or"
"this robot or this cell can do XYZ and"
"then we find out it can or it can't and"
"and then we you know we sort of"
"empirically we know did we guess"
"correctly did we overdo it did we under"
"under appreciate it in in my experience"
"we tend to under appreciate intelligence"
"way more than we over appreciate it"
"that's just that's just what I see in in"
"the biosciences"
"yeah I I do agree with the point that uh"
"is perhaps uh humans ego would like to"
"think that there is something absolutely"
"special in humans and that's on but"
"indeed I mean the Continuum is there"
"so and humans developed"
"from something much simpler and they"
"inherited properties of that"
"and uh yeah so basically I think I think"
"it's much better probably even for the"
"field of artificial intelligence it"
"would be much better to look at the"
"intelligence from this perspective"
"rather than from there well as you said"
"Garden of Eden type of"
"and uniqueness of human abilities I mean"
"Intelligence being just really bound to"
"Being Human"
"yeah yeah I mean I'm certainly not"
"arguing that that the humans have some"
"interesting capacities that are that are"
"hard or impossible to find elsewhere"
"right now but this this way of thinking"
"about them as natural kinds as sharp"
"natural kinds I think is is"
"philosophically really problematic"
"because biology is so so I have this"
"diagram that I sort of beat people over"
"the head with and and it's got It's got"
"like a standard human in the center"
"right and then up above is a is a very"
"high resolution uh evolutionary Series"
"going all the way back to you know you"
"name it some sort of some sort of"
"microbe right and so whatever you think"
"this human has you have to tell me where"
"it Peters out like where what where did"
"you have these two parents that were not"
"whatever right the gentle and then bam"
"they had a child and now the child has"
"you know true whatever like where is"
"that line that's impossible then down"
"below it's got the same sort of thing"
"developmentally so again I could take"
"you all the way back to the Single Cell"
"oocyte a little pile of chemicals and"
"you have to tell me where things Peter"
"out if they do and then laterally it"
"gets even worse because uh in One"
"Direction what you can do is you by"
"biology is so interoperable you can"
"start to make um chimeras and hybrids"
"between biological tissues and uh and"
"machines so we can make you I can have"
"over here somebody that's uh you know 99"
"human and a little bit of you know chips"
"in the brain right uh with some AI over"
"here it's the Opposites 99 Roomba with"
"some human brain cells living in it that"
"sort of are instrumented to it and we"
"can fill in every single point in the"
"middle every point in the middle is is"
"is occupied by a possible being 50 50"
"you know 63 64. you you name it right"
"and and if you're saying this is a"
"machine and this is a human and these"
"are binary categories then you got a"
"real problem telling me where we're"
"going to shift over right where are we"
"going to click over and the same thing"
"with the on the biological the"
"bioengineering and so so so here's a"
"human at some point we're going to want"
"some gills and somebody's gonna want to"
"tail and somebody's going to want a"
"third brain hemisphere all of this is"
"completely doable completely doable and"
"we could we could do we could do much of"
"this to you know tomorrow and so uh then"
"again you have to tell me what's where"
"are they when are they not human anymore"
"I feel like you know these these"
"categories are"
"um treating them as As Natural kinds is"
"is limiting more than it is facilitating"
"for for ideas in this field well we very"
"kind of clearly going into transhumanism"
"yeah which is indeed quite a natural"
progression
"because you yeah you keep extending your"
"capabilities with any kind of automation"
"or tools starting from glasses or"
"whatever and yeah you keep extending"
"yourself you keep morphing with it and"
"indeed it's a good question like okay so"
"yeah what is a what is the line there"
"are of course many interesting"
"controversial questions about that we"
"probably should not go into that because"
"it's kind of worms"
"of all the things that we discussed I"
"can only imagine questions coming from"
"that side"
"I I one of my favorite stories I came"
"across is the first guy to use an"
"umbrella in London right I mean this was"
"considered scandalous he was pelted with"
"garbage because it was he was upsetting"
"the natural order of things that wow who"
"is he not to get wet this is unnatural"
"we're all walking around under the rain"
"getting wet and look at this guy there"
"was an umbrella and right and so I you"
"know I didn't know this story yeah yeah"
"yeah yeah well it's I mean look I got it"
"off the internet so so maybe it's I"
"assume okay who knows definitely use"
"this story in some of my arguments thank"
"you people I I I get I get this from"
"people all the time oh my God it's you"
"know it's it's on you know it's"
"unnatural look natural is getting is"
"getting scratched in the forest getting"
"an infection and dying because you don't"
"you know because you got scratched or"
"because you we don't know how to brush"
"our teeth like natural is terrible"
"natural is absolutely terrible and and"
"we can do better we can do better than"
"this and and I think that um you know"
"all of these all of these things are"
"going to be people are gonna people are"
"gonna laugh at us in the future I think"
"thinking about the things that we were"
"concerned with here the same way that we"
"think of you know back in the day the"
"first person to come up with some"
"crutches or or some you know glasses I"
"mean uh you know this kind of stuff it's"
"just it's just yeah I don't know I don't"
"know yeah that's that's flash of"
inspiration
yeah
"another argument could be well what is"
"really a natural blog if we are natural"
"and naturally our brains are coming up"
"with those extensions they are natural"
"therefore as well sure sure I think all"
"of this stuff is you know all of this"
"stuff I think even even in in in very"
"modern you know sort of scientific"
"thinkers a lot of the stuff goes back to"
"a Garden of Eden view of if it was the"
"case that somebody has prepped all of"
"this for us in the best possible way"
"then of course the answer is hey you"
"scientists don't screw it up it's"
"already as good as it's going to be all"
"you're going to do is make it worse that"
"made sense when people thought that this"
"was all created for us in the best"
"possible way that picture that that"
"story as as has crumbled long ago"
"there's no way I think rationally to"
"look around at"
"um the the health disparities worldwide"
"the um the the incredible suffering due"
"to disease and aging and everything else"
"and to say that well natural is"
"fantastic let's just make sure that okay"
"natural is horrible and and and up until"
"now there's there's been no way to get"
"around it now finally we have you know"
"we're the adults in the room now we we"
"have some of it and of course we're"
"going to mess things up too of course"
"but but we have now some ability to do"
"better than natural and let's just"
"remember that natural is not someone has"
"prepped this for us uh you know in"
"accordance to our values of happiness"
"and fulfillment all that nobody's done"
"that Evolution Evolution uh optimizes"
"for biomass basically like that's it"
"that's it it doesn't optimize for"
"intelligence really it doesn't optimize"
"for happiness for any of those things"
"Evolution just make sure that the next"
"Observer is going to observe a bunch of"
"um stuff you know running around in"
"interesting things that's it that's it"
"all right so I I really vividly remember"
"when you first shown the videos with"
"those flat worms that preventable flat"
"worms by now and essentially once you"
"get the two-headed of three credit and"
"those kind of uh tractors in the space"
"of the dynamic assist something at this"
"table right they replicate and they are"
"still two-headed and essentially say"
"well one head at one was a solution some"
"local minimum found by evolutionary"
"stochastic gradient descent or you name"
"it and it could have been another"
"solution and another solution and some"
"of them maybe have lower loss or higher"
"reward or whatever right so why won't we"
"just look for them yeah yeah"
"yeah so that was quite an eye-opener yet"
yet
"uh it's very strong"
"bias against transhumanism quite often"
"and um right it's understandable because"
"the chances of kind of screwing things"
"up are definitely non-zero sure but they"
"are also not 100 yeah I think the"
"difference between people is in their"
"kind of estimation whether the glass is"
"half full or half empty it's also it's"
"that and it's also so so I get a lot of"
"phone calls every week and I get two"
"kinds of phone calls uh the young"
"healthy people are calling me saying"
"knock this off it's like it's it's scary"
"it's dangerous whatever the people with"
"various medical problems or with"
"children with medical problems call me"
"yelling uh what's taking you so long"
"like hurry up we have problems like we"
"need and so you know and I just always"
"want to like try to connect these people"
"to each other because because you know"
"of of yeah of everything's all well and"
"good until until you need to go to the"
"doctor and then you hope they figured"
"some of this out uh it's it's you know"
"it's all scary until until you need"
"something and yeah something new and"
"much scarier happens to you yeah yeah"
"yeah yeah and that's just stop being"
"scared of imaginary things yeah that's"
"that's that's yeah that's that's exactly"
right
"yeah and and change you know change is"
"scary too and and I and the interesting"
"thing about about change the fundamental"
"changes that your values can change I re"
"I distinctly remember being being a"
"young kid looking at some of the older"
"kids and thinking wow uh you know and"
"they you know they were they you know"
"they're dating and all this stuff I'm"
"like oh my God I'm gonna I'm gonna have"
"to um it looks it will be based on what"
"I see here I'm gonna end up like one of"
"them and then I'm just gonna be"
"interested in all this kind of crazy"
"stuff that I have zero this is this is"
"unbelievable what is there a way to like"
"like not do that and and of course but"
"then of course once you make that"
"transition you think well that was dumb"
"because now I like all this stuff and"
"and so you can you know it's it's scary"
"because when you change the things that"
"are important to you will change"
"yeah well the good thing is once you"
change
"you will not care anymore about the"
"videos you had before you change exactly"
"at least it will go along with that"
"because yeah I remember like before I"
"had first child like everybody would say"
"oh now you're gonna be crazy busy you"
