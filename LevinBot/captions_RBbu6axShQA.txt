"today we're talking to a person who is"
"probably the most important guest we've"
"had to date"
"in terms of practical scientific"
implications
"before we get to the actual interview"
"i'd like to make two introductory"
comments
"if you'd like to skip to the actual"
exchange
"see the timeline in the video"
description
"first you'll see that levin and i make"
"reference to the physical foundations of"
"his work"
"i'd like to elaborate on this so on the"
"screen i've inserted the formula for the"
"so-called hamiltonian of an open-ended"
"relativistic string from string theory"
"in its lagrangian form"
"this is the ultimate theoretical"
"foundation for what levin and i talk"
"about as the principle of least action"
"note that the energy of the string is"
"quantized as m squared or mass squared"
"which gives rise to a certain symmetry"
"between physics at the most fundamental"
"quantum level"
"and the well-established classical"
"physics that powers the bioelectrical"
"engineering that levin and his team are"
"using to regenerate frog limbs"
"it's important to understand that this"
"is not simply abstract math or"
philosophy
"and the proof is in the pudding"
"along the same lines and following a"
"line of reasoning that levin refers to"
"as the multi-scale competency"
architecture
"here is the algorithm that we propose to"
"apply these same physical and"
"mathematical symmetries to social and"
"economic systems"
"and voting theory in particular"
"note the quadratic math and the symmetry"
"present at each 11's so-called scales of"
"intelligence from fundamental physics to"
bioelectricity
"to a branch of economics known as social"
"choice theory"
"at each one of these levels the same"
"framework delivers practical real-world"
"solutions to outstanding problems"
"for more information i encourage you to"
"go back to the channel's inaugural"
"lecture for a first principles"
"conceptual approach to the physical"
"framework being proposed"
"that's one introductory comment"
"the second point i'd like to make is to"
"ask you to pay special attention to"
"levin's goal-oriented approach to"
science
"despite the resistance of many to the"
"idea that nature has purpose and goals"
"note levin's extremely compelling"
response
"he says"
look
"this is a framework that we find useful"
"and the language we use to describe it"
"if you have something better"
"bring it"
"for the moment my team and i are"
"regenerating frog limbs and are looking"
"to regenerate human limbs and organs as"
"well as possibly cure cancer"
"how is your framework and your"
"teleophobia working out for you"
"this is such a great response and"
"listeners may or may not recognize in it"
"an echo of this channel's preference for"
"yakir aharnav's two-time interpretation"
"of quantum mechanics"
"where in the future is posited to have a"
"causal impact on the present"
"the point here is that in biology as in"
"physics and in society"
"the proof is and should always be in the"
pudding
"just as levin and his team"
"are doing in"
"bioelectricity using aharonov's two-time"
"approach many teams in many parts of the"
"world have been able to respond in an"
"intuitive and empirical way to several"
"of the most perplexing open questions in"
"science and philosophy"
"i'm happy to count asym among those"
teams
"if any other framework can do better"
"i say what levin and aharnav say"
"bring it and let's all learn together"
"anyway thank you for listening and here"
"alas is my exchange with professor"
"michael levin"
"it is a privilege to share it with you"
"hello and welcome to a theory of"
"everything i'm luis rosso the director"
"of the european institute of science and"
management
"and today i have the privilege of"
"talking to professor michael levin"
"whose work i think you're going to find"
especially
"fascinating professor levin has dual"
"degrees in biology and computer science"
"from tuts university and a phd from"
harvard
"he's currently a distinguished professor"
"of biology at tufts where he's also the"
"director of the allen discovery center"
"and the center for regenerative and"
"developmental biology"
"despite his impressive academic pedigree"
"it's genuinely difficult to pin his work"
"down to one or two disciplines"
"i would argue that he's doing important"
"work at the cutting"
"conceptual edge of things related to"
physics
biology
medicine
"cellular robotics computer science"
"artificial intelligence"
psychology
management
"politics and philosophy"
"that's a lot of ground to cover"
"of course"
"but all of these disciplines are of"
"special interest to this channel"
"beginning with physics and going all the"
"way up"
"through the social sciences"
"which is why the channel is called a"
"theory of everything and which is why"
i'm
"very much looking forward to today's"
discussion
"i'm guessing that professor levin is"
"surprised by me including things like"
"physics psychology politics and"
management
"among the list of disciplines"
"impacted by his work but i prepared to"
"defend this position and that's one of"
my
"primary goals uh in this exchange"
"in the interest of brevity and to make"
"the most of our time together"
"i'm going to assume that listeners are"
"already basically familiar with"
"professor levin's work"
"he's given a wonderful ted talk in which"
"he summarizes some of his work in about"
"18 minutes"
"i'll leave a link to that talk"
"and other discussions and relevant"
"papers in the video description"
"i highly recommend listeners to spend"
"some time with these materials to get a"
"better feel for the far reaching"
"implications of today's discussion"
"professor 11 welcome and thanks so much"
"for taking the time to talk today"
"thank you so much yeah very happy to be"
here
"professor one recurring idea in your"
"work is a non-traditional conception of"
intelligence
"and in fact you cite the american"
"philosopher and psychologist william"
james
"his definition of intelligence"
"i had the privilege of studying"
"intelligence under richard hernstein at"
harvard
"who had an office in fact in william"
"james hall"
"i grew"
"quite fond of professor hernstein and"
"his willingness to help me and i think"
"his work is super important and relevant"
"even today 30 years after his passing"
"but at the same time i was always left"
"with a feeling that"
"his conception of intelligence was"
"limited and there was a higher form of"
intelligence
and
"that higher form of intelligence is is"
"something that i think your work is"
"tapping into"
um
[Music]
"you say that when a person makes a"
"judgment this is very interesting you"
"say that when a person makes a judgment"
"about intelligence it's a measure of"
"their own iq"
"i think you're absolutely right can you"
"elaborate on this conception of"
"intelligence and connect it to your work"
"sure um well let's let's take a step"
"back so so i want to be clear that"
"intelligence is a really as you well"
"know is a very complex issue uh i'm not"
"going to claim that i have the only"
"appropriate definition or the best"
"answer i'm just going to give you my"
"thoughts on it and the framework that i"
"found useful in my work and i think"
"we've you know can fully um accept that"
"there are other people with other useful"
"definitions and so on"
"so for me uh some some something that's"
"uh that has"
"some work that has to be done by any"
"theory of intelligence is that it has to"
"be able to help us"
"directly compare and interact with what"
"we now call diverse intelligences so i'm"
"not interested in theories that apply"
"just to mammals or to mammals and birds"
"or that break down when we have to think"
"about octopus or insects or other things"
"i want a"
"a framework for intelligence that is"
"going to handle all possible"
"agents this means not only the things we"
"see in the phylogenetic tree here on"
"earth but novel synthetic synthetic"
"biology constructs"
"artificial intelligences that we may"
"build either in hardware or software"
"potential exobiological agents weird"
"beings at other scales including"
"individual cells subcellular molecular"
"networks uh enormous things like um"
"social structures and you know um"
"basically and perhaps the evolutionary"
"process itself so i want a definition of"
"intelligence that captures what is"
"central about uh intelligence that it"
"does not uh depend on or get hung up on"
"implementation materials or origin"
"evolve designed you know natural on"
"earth exoplanetary i don't care i think"
"that that right if we're going to have"
"intelligence it's got to uh it's got to"
"do that much work for us"
"so uh what that means is that um we are"
"guaranteed to uh by coming developments"
"let's say in synthetic biology and ai"
"and so on we're guaranteed to encounter"
"creatures that don't fit anywhere"
"comfortably on the familiar scale of"
"intelligence on earth that we're used to"
"and so"
"we don't know yet what are the"
"appropriate uh signatures of different"
"kinds of intelligence and more"
"fundamentally i don't believe that there"
"is some kind of objective privileged um"
"once and for all correct answer to how"
"intelligent something is because all of"
"these things intelligence cognition many"
"other important concepts are basically"
"observer dependent it's on it's on the"
"observer to make a claim about"
"intelligence and then to specify what"
"space what problem space that"
"intelligence is being deployed in what"
"are the goals of that intelligence how"
"much competency it has and when you make"
"those goals you put yourself out there"
"as uh for you for to be evaluated"
"yourself as in how well did you do did"
"you did you uh figure out what this"
"being is capable of in a in an optimal"
"way or maybe later someone else will"
"come along and say oh you missed the"
"boat entirely look at look at what it's"
"doing in this other space it's way more"
"intelligent than that so"
"i see all of these things as empirical"
"claims and in fact"
"uh as as all empirical claims they're"
"provisional they're subject to um you"
"know rev uh uh updating by other people"
"who are sharper than we may be in"
"noticing what it is that a certain"
"system is doing so that's what i mean"
"when you when you make an iq test you're"
"making a claim of this is the way i've"
"discovered to interact and to interpret"
"the system show me if there's a better"
"one or not but that's you know that's"
"that's the current that's my current"
"estimate that's what i meant"
okay
"i really really like this this um"
"common response of yours is this is my"
"proposal if you have something better"
"show it to me and let's talk about it"
"and it's the fact that you are so"
"focused on"
"empirical results"
"i think is you know just it just wins"
"the day right it wins the day"
"so so what is your definition of"
intelligence
"so so my definition of intelligence is"
"is uh"
"basically basically what william james"
"said maybe a little bit generalized i i"
"view intelligence as competency in"
"navigating various spaces these spaces"
"can be all kinds of unconventional"
"things so not just the three-dimensional"
"space that we're used to but also things"
"like transcriptional spaces meaning the"
"space of all possible gene expression"
"levels anatomical amorphous spaces so"
"basically the space of uh"
"shape deformations and shapes and"
"biological shapes um physiological"
"spaces it doesn't matter it can be many"
"and there may be other spaces that i"
"don't even know how to deal with"
"linguistic spaces and other things"
uh
"it's competency navigating those spaces"
"now what does that mean let's unpack"
"that it means two things i think"
"fundamental the one thing that is"
"fundamental to all agents to in order to"
"call somebody something an agent to be"
"somewhere on this continuum of agency i"
"think what we're really talking about is"
"different degrees of competency to"
"pursue goals there is some region of"
"that space that you prefer to other"
"regions of that space there are certain"
"states that you like better than other"
"states and you have some amount of"
"capacity to get there now when from from"
"other portions of the space now that may"
"be extremely primitive meaning that you"
"might be a bacteria and all you're doing"
"is run and tumble and you really you"
"know that's all you know about your"
"space or you might be very sophisticated"
"like a like a mammal or a bird that has"
"a um"
"a memory of the space and can sort of"
"navigate it with planning and forward uh"
"you know forward planning and things"
"like that uh but but in between lie"
"huge uh that lie a huge diversity of"
"different navigation uh policies for"
"navigating that space for example how"
"good are you at avoiding local minima do"
"you have patience to back away from a a"
"sort of direct line to your goal if you"
"know that if i go around temporarily"
"i'll go further but but in the end i'll"
"do a better job you know do you have"
"some do you have patience are you able"
"to uh remember where you've been and to"
"and to represent where you're going"
"there's a huge diversity so william"
james
"i think had it right on the money as he"
"did with most things which is that he"
"said that it's the ability to"
"get to the same goal by different means"
"so do you have the and what kind of"
"capacity do you have to achieve your"
"same goal with the uh you're being"
"perturbed you've been pushed to a"
"different region of the space you have"
"been altered in some way your"
"environment has been altered all kinds"
"of things are happening can you still"
"get to your goal or are you basically"
"just a sort of hardwired automaton that"
"all it can do is is follow the exact"
"same steps every single time so i like"
"that definition it's a it's a functional"
"definition it's empirically tractable it"
"uh helps us do new work in and it"
"prevents endless armchair um arguments"
"philosophical arguments we you know we"
"make it an empirical question"
"okay fantastic well in your in your"
"speaking you talk about intelligence and"
"you connect it to goals now goals are"
inextricably
"embedded in time"
so
"as a biologist"
"you face from what i gather quite a bit"
"of resistance"
"in talking about goals and time"
"why do you think uh"
"where do you think this resistance comes"
"from and can you"
"can you elaborate on this in your"
opinion
"sure um yeah i call it uh i call it"
"teleophobia uh there is this uh"
"incredible resistance to to any kind of"
"models or frameworks that that have to"
"do with goals and i think the reason is"
"this uh"
"in in the olden days it we where where"
"we basically only had two go there were"
"only two kinds of objects in the world"
"as far as we knew there was dumb matter"
"which just sort of does what it does and"
"then there were humans that had goals"
"right and that's that's the sort of"
"that's it that was the dichotomy and"
"that's what we thought about now"
"if you live in that world"
"absolutely when you do science if those"
"are your only two choices when you do"
"science you want to er on the side of uh"
"no goals because otherwise you end up"
"with you know completely um"
"scientifically intractable uh kinds of"
"pseudo problems where um"
"where you know attributing human level"
"goals to to most of what we see is just"
"is just useless so people are on the"
"side of no goals at all now the the nice"
"thing and a lot of people seemingly"
"haven't caught up to this is that ever"
"since the 1940s and probably well before"
"that we've had a perfectly good science"
"of goals that is not magical okay the"
"the the age of having either no goals or"
"or human level cognition those are your"
"only options that age is gone since the"
"40s we've we've had we've had"
"cybernetics we've had control theory"
"we've had computer science"
"we now know perfectly well that you can"
"have mechanical non-magical naturalistic"
"systems that have goals and uh and it's"
"not scary there's no problem with it"
"it's not religious it's uh you know your"
"thermostat actually has goals that's"
"that's we just have to bite the bullet"
"and and go with the engineers on this"
"one because it's been uh an incredibly"
"uh useful framework for understanding"
"the world so so at this point i i think"
"i think the resistance is still when"
"people hear goals"
"they think um second order human level"
"goals where i know what my goals are"
"that's not that's not just a goal that's"
"an incredibly complex piece of cognition"
"that no one is attributing that to the"
"wide variety of objects that we deal"
"with in biology but that's it but that's"
"not what goals have to be goals don't"
"have to be this incredibly complicated"
"modern human thing there are very simple"
"tiny little goals and there are sort of"
"slightly more complex goals and it's"
"everywhere nothing in biola in this the"
"sort of paraphrase is a famous old"
"saying by"
"uh that's a i i think nothing in biology"
"really makes sense in the absence of"
"goal directedness if you really want to"
"understand biology you have to make your"
"peace with the fact that there are goals"
"there are in fact a wide diversity of"
"goals and it doesn't have to be this"
"this binary choice between human level"
"goals and no goals at all that that's"
"what screws everybody up"
"fantastic and i always come back or i"
"like to come back to your position that"
"listen this is my framework if you have"
something
"better or"
"more explanatory"
"uh or empirical evidence that that"
"surpasses what we're able to produce"
"then you know bring it"
"so how would you characterize the"
current
um
climate
regarding
"uh teleology in biology today is it is"
"this does it remain the the primary"
"framework under which biologists work"
"the idea that there is no goals"
"yeah i mean look i want to sort of be"
"clear i'm not the first person to try to"
"rehabilitate uh you know teleology in"
"biology there have been many very deep"
"thinkers who have made these uh this"
"this effort from time to time however"
"i think that uh"
"the field as a whole really"
"by by by a very large amount falls into"
"two camps there are people looking sort"
"of downwards towards molecular biology"
and
"assuming that uh the micro details of"
"chemistry are going to do all the work"
"that we need and that there should be no"
"goal talk whatsoever that that that's a"
"that's a massive uh you know sort of"
"slice of the of the pie then then there"
"are the people who look at it uh in"
"reverse and they and these tend to be uh"
"maybe not not the developmental"
"biologists but or molecular biologists"
"but maybe um"
"people more interested in in psychology"
"and behavioral science and maybe social"
"issues who worry that that kind of uh"
"approach is going to drain"
"um is going to drain uh humans of of of"
"moral status that basically everything"
"will then go out the window that that"
"wants you once once other things besides"
"humans have goals then then we will have"
"trouble with ethics frameworks and we"
"will be devalued in some sense and they"
"you know they're worried about the"
"coming ais and extending personhood to"
"to things that they don't think are"
"persons and so on um and then there's a"
"there's a kind of a razor thin community"
"in between which are people who work on"
"basal cognition and again i'm not the"
"only one there there are a number of"
"really excellent folks working in this"
"area that work on basal cognition and uh"
"and and try to um try to try to do it"
"you know to to to expand uh this this"
"this impasse the the biggest uh the"
"biggest problem with all of this is this"
"that that"
"most of these discussions have been"
"taking place in a philosophical vacuum"
"so a lot of the people who critique this"
"topic have never read a single thing on"
"teleology they just know that that the"
"goal they just feel that goals are bad"
"um often the people who are into this"
"topic debate endlessly in philosophy and"
"it it it never sort of impacts the other"
"side of the community because what they"
"want to see is all right uh what does"
"this do for me why do i need to pay"
"attention to this what what's the you"
"know what's the payoff going to be and"
"so what we've done uh"
"is is work very very hard at trying to"
"be extremely clear"
"as to the idea that these these concepts"
"are not philosophy they're they cannot"
"be decided from an armchair they"
"literally make a difference in how you"
"do experiments and what experiments you"
"do so to me the the final arbiter of all"
"of this is simply"
"uh well what what has it like yeah it's"
"experiment it's what has this led you to"
"do how you know how how is the research"
"program going what is this right that's"
"that's to me the the trick and so so we"
"tried very hard to make that connection"
"that's great so so you're saying"
"essentially you're saying listen i'm"
"generating or regenerating fraud"
"problems so what are you doing with your"
"framework no i think that's"
"yeah i mean to some extent"
"to some extent right the idea is simply"
"and i've had people say to me you know"
"i'll give a talk and somebody will say"
"um you know i really like your data i"
"like what you show i wish you'd stop"
"talking about this goal directed stuff"
"and and this basal cognition i mean just"
"ditch that and just do the experiments"
"and and i always say it doesn't work"
"like that we wouldn't have done these"
"experiments and the reason that we did"
"them and that nobody else had done them"
"is precisely because we have a framework"
"that leads us to ask these questions"
"that other people either assume are"
"solved or just you know won't touch at"
"all and uh i i think uh there there's"
"lots of there's lots of work that really"
"should be looked at isn't not not just"
"me there's lots of work that should be"
"looked at um from from that perspective"
"excellent i had the opportunity"
"uh of"
"giving a talk"
"this morning to a group of"
"doctors here in barcelona"
"and your work figured prominently in"
"that and one of the arguments that i put"
"forward was"
this
goal-directed
"orientation in biology actually had"
a
"a parallel"
"or a symmetry in physics"
"where things such as the principle of"
"least action yes"
"yes also"
"um talks about"
"the end"
"or a final condition a boundary"
"condition the initial and the final"
"boundary condition have you given a lot"
"of thought to this uh to this idea and"
"does it impact your work"
"yes yes absolutely um that uh least"
"action principles are a"
"massively important inspiration for me"
"because it"
it
"and i'm no i'm no physicist and and for"
"you know for a much better story about"
"physics you can talk to um carl fristen"
"and christopher fields and then people i"
"work with they're they're sort of much"
"much sharper on this but uh for for me"
"it bears on the following question you"
"know as i have as i have"
"rolled out this framework of of a"
"continuum of cognition"
"uh the question then arises is there a"
"zero on this so are there things that"
"have exactly zero cognition so none"
"whatsoever not just minimal cognition"
"not just simple cognition but actually"
zero
"and uh because of these kind of leased"
"action uh uh principles i i think no i"
"think i'm i'm not 100 convinced but if"
"but if i had to put money down right now"
"i would say i think in our in our"
"universe i don't believe there's a zero"
because
"if you if you start so so let's ask"
"ourselves what are"
"the absolutely minimal requirements for"
"having some some something that you"
"would call being an agent right what are"
"the absolutely minimal requirements well"
"the minimal requirements to me are first"
"of all that you are able to do some sort"
"of goal-directed activity as"
"simple as it may be but you're able to"
"do some sort of goal-directed activity"
"and two there should be some degree of"
"uh indeterminacy in your actions that"
"are not precisely explained by all the"
"local forces immediately acting on you"
"now okay and if you think about it that"
"way well single particles already have"
"it we we already have we already have"
"the least action stuff we have the"
"quantum indeterminacy i think it goes"
"all the way down to the bottom and so"
"this is this is a weird kind of pan"
"psychism in the sense that i'm certainly"
"not saying that"
"rocks have hopes and dreams like you and"
"i do what i'm saying and i'm not"
"painting some sort of extra mystical um"
"uh you know cognitive shine on on"
"physics i think and this is what carl"
"and chris are both doing i think that"
"what we thought of as basic physics"
"actually can and probably should be"
"reformulated from this perspective so"
"that it's not something weird and extra"
"you sort of posit that's on top of on"
"top of normal physics that works"
"perfectly well that i think is is not"
"useful i think actually what what basic"
"physics is telling us an active"
"inference and then those kinds of things"
"is that this stuff goes all the way to"
"the bottom and what life is really great"
"at doing is scaling it right so and and"
"so and so i don't work on really the"
"physics and i i kind of all my work"
"starts up once once you have a"
"reasonably um"
"sophisticated homeostatic"
"creature so even before bacteria but"
"something like that um"
"then uh"
"then i talk about how it scales up so i"
"i have lots of ideas about how that"
"scales into higher and higher forms of"
"cognition but i think that's what life"
"it's doing it's not it's not um uh"
"generating it from scratch i think it's"
"scaling up something that is already in"
"the bedrock of our universe"
"i would say that you're you're probably"
"right because the principle of least"
"action as far as we know goes down to"
"the down to the cork level and even in"
"even in string theory it's still uh"
"something that that"
"a framework that that governs the the"
"thinking and the math so interesting i"
"would say so"
um
"and what you talked about scaling up of"
"this um"
"of these lower order"
"principles and ideas can you elaborate"
"on on that how this scaling up from from"
"physics to biology to perhaps"
"other areas of uh of human activity"
"yeah uh this question of of scaling and"
"and how you get emergent cognitive"
"individuals or selves from a collection"
"of pieces where the pieces themselves"
"have some level of competency uh is"
"maybe the most important and the most"
"intere to me anyway the most interesting"
"question in all of science this is this"
"is why my lab is hard to pin down why we"
"do so many different weird things in"
"computer science and biology because"
"ultimately we work on this very general"
"question that transcends individual"
"disciplines this idea of how do"
"composite minds come into being in the"
"world because we are all collective"
"intelligences right if you zoom in"
"enough there's no such thing as a"
"unified singular intelligence everything"
"is made of parts so at some point you"
"always have to understand how do the"
"parts come together to form some sort of"
"um centralized intelligence so uh you"
know
"the best stories that i can tell because"
"these are empirically uh uh backed up"
"story stories that are backed up by not"
"only experiment but actually"
"applications towards regenerative"
"medicine cancer biology and so on"
"the best story i can tell is what"
"happens uh once you have"
individual
"homeostatic agents that are single cells"
"we you know let's say let's say let's"
"say a very simple bacterial cell or even"
"even before that"
"the key thing about a homeostatic cycle"
"is that it has three parts to it you you"
"take a measurement of something you care"
"about let's say the let's say the ph the"
"local ph level or something like that"
"you compare that measurement with your"
"set point"
"meaning the optimal uh the optimal"
"measurement where it ought to be and we"
"can talk in a minute about where those"
"optimalities come from and then"
"depending on what you find you you are"
"not a passive observer like a piece of"
"film you're an active observer meaning"
"that you will do something based on that"
"information if it's too high or too low"
"you will take some sort of action to try"
"to get back to it so those are the three"
"pieces of of a homeostatic circuit so"
now
"once once you are a cell like that what"
"you can imagine doing is and and we've"
"we've studied this i don't study"
"bacteria but i study um single you know"
"cells and tissues"
"what you can do is you can imagine the"
"following scenario imagine that two"
"cells uh have now connected with each"
"other and they've connected in a very"
"special way not they don't just send"
"chemical signals to each other that's"
"that's easy and that doesn't really do"
"do the trick"
"uh what they've done is they've"
"connected to each other with a special"
"kind of connection like a gap junction"
"or an electrical synapse that"
"partially connects their internal"
"milieus their internal worlds right so"
"they're like like two submarine hatches"
"connected to each other that some"
"something magical happens when you do"
"that what happens is this uh let's say"
"that's let's say there's two cells a and"
"b and let's say that cell a uh something"
"happened to it let's say it got poked by"
"something in the environment and it"
"generated a calcium flux or something"
"that is a it's an engram a memory trace"
"of the experience that it's had well if"
"it's connected to other cells let's say"
"cell b that calcium spike or or whatever"
"small molecule signal of that of that"
"memory is going to propagate into cell b"
"and now"
"what's important is that that there's no"
"metadata on these signals that say where"
"they came from cell b senses this uh"
"this signal and so for cell b it becomes"
"a false memory because cell b never"
"experienced that event however for the"
"composite of a and b together it's"
"absolutely a vertical memory it's it's a"
"true memory and because these memory"
"traces can propagate between a and b it"
"becomes hard for the cells to keep their"
"individual identities it's hard to keep"
"an individual identity it's kind of hard"
"to keep a difference between me and you"
"if we share all our memories if i can't"
"say which memories are mine and which"
"memories are yours we become in an"
"important functional sense entangled"
"that means that we cannot"
"easily defect from each other in the"
"game theory sense of failure to"
cooperate
"we because we're connected if i do"
"anything it immediately if i do anything"
"to you it immediately comes back to me"
"through the gap junctions so"
"it makes it hard to defect it it makes"
"our memories shared and it does three"
"things to this homeostatic cycle"
"whatever it is that we measure we now"
"measure a bigger space because now we're"
"a whole sheet of cells we're not a"
"single cell so when we take measurements"
"we take large scale measurements so the"
"thing we measure is bigger"
"we our memory is bigger because now we"
"have lots more computational capacity so"
"we can remember bigger things as set"
"points they're not just you know sort of"
small
"set points and the actions that we take"
"are much bigger actions whereas before"
"you were a single cell and you could do"
"single cell things now we're a"
"collective and when you do things you"
"can do massive things like bend as a"
"sheet and generate three-dimensional"
"forms so what happens is that that scale"
"that ability to scale up the goal"
"directedness is"
"the key to me the the the key driver of"
"the scaling of intelligence because"
"here's my theory of how you comp how you"
um
"uh compare diverse intelligences so how"
"how could you and this was this was"
"something that i was at a templeton"
"meeting i think in uh"
"uh 2018 i believe it was where they"
"challenged to come up with a single"
"framework on which you could directly"
"compare diverse intelligences and so"
"what i thought of was this this idea"
"that i call the cognitive light cone"
"model the idea is that every agent i"
"don't care where it comes from i don't"
"care how it got here evolve design"
"combination whatever whatever it's made"
"of the fundamental thing to being an"
"agent is that it has gold so what we can"
"do is we can plot on a on a on a sheet"
"that looks it looks kind of like a"
"minkowski diagram where all of space is"
"sort of one axis and time is the other"
"axis you can plot on this"
"uh on this uh sp on this on this diagram"
"the size of the goals that that system"
"is capable of representing not how far"
"it sees not how far it can act but but"
"the goals this the shape and size of the"
"goals that it can pursue so for example"
"you might have something like a uh like"
"a bacterium and the bacterium you know"
"it has a little bit of memory going"
"backwards a little bit of predictive"
"capacity going forward but fundamentally"
"all that it cares about that it's going"
"to measure and control is things right"
"around that bacteria like uh you know"
"glucose concentrations and things like"
"that so there's a very very tiny"
"cognitive light cone and it just doesn't"
"it's impo it doesn't care about anything"
"like that if you have a more advanced"
"creature let's say you have a dog much"
"bigger cognitive like cone it has the"
"ability to to to remember and plan and"
"pursue goals uh in a bigger area but"
"you're never going to get your dog to"
"functionally care about something that"
"will happen then the next town over"
"three weeks from now it's impossible to"
"go that right that as far as we know"
"that those animals just simply don't"
"have that size of a glycol now you come"
"to to humans humans have a massive like"
"cone and in fact uh uniquely perhaps"
"they have a cone that is why that is"
"bigger than their own lifespan limit so"
"they can conceive of goals that are"
"guaranteed not to be achievable in their"
"lifetime then that maybe that generates"
"some special psychological pressures i"
"don't know but but the idea you know"
"there's people that are literally"
"working towards world peace and they're"
"you know concerned with what happens"
"when the sun burns out and these these"
"kinds of things so humans can have"
"enormous um uh cognitive like cones and"
"so so what happens during the scaling"
"from from the most humble bacteria up"
"what really happens is the enlargement"
"of that cognitive light cone what is"
"what are the uh what are the things that"
"i can care about and a very closely"
"related concept is the concept of stress"
"the stress being a"
"variant of that delta that error between"
"where we are now and where we'd like to"
"be what is our goal state and how far"
"away are we from that and generally"
"speaking if you tell me what you're"
"stressed about i can tell you what your"
"cognitive level of sophistication is so"
"if you tell me that you're stressed that"
"your your level of um uh you know sugar"
"isn't high enough i'll say well you're"
"probably a bacterium if you tell me that"
"you're stressed because uh you're you"
"don't have the right number of fingers"
"i'll say well you're probably a uh an"
"actively regenerating limb if you're"
"stressed about the global financial"
"markets and what happens in the next 200"
"years to humanity i'm going to say"
"you're at least a human level of of of"
cognitive
"capacity so so the kinds of things that"
"are capable of stressing you right are"
"are the things that deter really"
"determine what your cognitive"
"goal level is and i think that's what"
"gets scaled what gets scaled is the"
"ability to be stressed by bigger and"
"bigger states of affairs"
"interesting very interesting point well"
"for whatever it's worth one of the"
central
um
"mission uh"
"objectives of the channel and our work"
"at aesa"
"is to talk about some of the dangers"
"that we're facing"
"as a species and that's one of our one"
"of our main concerns you talked"
"previously about this optimality"
"and it reminded me"
"of another framework that uh comes from"
"theoretical physics and that's the the"
"two-time interpretation of"
"yakir haranov"
"and what what he does is"
"posit a different interpretation of"
physics
"especially the measurement problem in in"
physics
"and how he resolves it in a very"
"extremely rigorous and also in period"
"with empirical fruit"
"um is by positing that the future has an"
"impact on the present so that was i"
"think that's a very relevant point and i"
"would like to just remind listeners that"
"this is something that is"
"very well founded not mainstream but"
"very well founded very solid from one of"
"the most well respected physicists alive"
"at the moment"
"so going back to this optimality"
"it would take that interpretation"
"is it possible that up that that"
"optimality that you referred to"
"that seeks to reduce the stress between"
"where something is at the moment"
"and where"
"that optimal set point is"
"can we understand that optimal set point"
"to be in the future anything other than"
"in the future"
"um yeah interesting question so so so i"
"don't know the the physics work that"
"you're talking about so i'll have to you"
"know reuse study up on that so i won't"
"comment on that in particular but um"
"i think that uh there's there's the the"
"deep the deep question that we're now"
"asking is where do these goals come from"
"right where do these set points come"
"from so traditionally there have been"
"there have been two answers so so one"
"answer is when you are a human designer"
"and you are creating some sort of"
"structure you as the designer set the"
"goals for this thing right if you're"
"making a thermostat at some point you're"
"going to have to set the value of"
"whatever physical object that's using to"
"store the set point"
"sorry that's common sense all right to"
"think of it this way yep yep so so so"
"that's been that's been around for a"
"long time more recently with with uh you"
"know with darwin and all we've realized"
"that okay evolution sets some of these"
"set points so your set point on a number"
"of items is set to a certain level"
"because in the past that's the set point"
"that uh has allowed uh"
"your ancestors to prosper so that's the"
"that's the that's the evolutionary"
"definition now what we're seeing what we"
"so so now what we're seeing though is is"
"something very interesting in terms of"
um
"in terms of evolution"
uh
"evolution apparently does not make"
"solutions to specific problems meaning"
"something that's fit for a specific"
environment
"evolution makes problem-solving machines"
and
"certainly people along for a long time"
"have been talking about plasticity and"
"epigenetics and things like that but i"
"think i think the reality is is way more"
"than uh than what's been proposed"
"up until now i think that uh and i could"
"give some some examples of what of what"
"we've seen uh but one of the interesting"
"things there is that when you make novel"
"creations whether by chimeric technology"
"so bring together different types of"
"materials by biological cells and then"
"genomes and other things that have never"
"been together before when you confront"
"life with materials and and uh active"
"matter and smart uh electrodes and all"
"these things that have never been around"
"life is incredibly interoperable always"
"you get something coherent and something"
"interesting will happen and then the"
"question is well where do those goals"
"come from because they are not the"
"product of lengthy uh periods of"
"selection because this object has never"
"existed before so there's not been"
"selection for this and at the same time"
"it is not the product of human design"
"because it's self-assembling you didn't"
"nobody designed it it's sort of"
"self-assembled so that raises an"
"interesting question aside from a"
"rational design and evolution and all"
"the different mixes thereof because"
"these things now are being mixed by"
"engineers all the time but where else"
"can goals come from and that's that's"
"that's an incredibly interesting"
"question um"
"uh if you want i can i can throw out"
"some some some kind of wild ideas but"
"but fundamentally i think that's one of"
"the most exciting open questions in the"
"future is how how do and and by the way"
"then to address your other point this"
"this this um uh"
"human human thriving and and and"
"existential risks and things like this"
"depend on the on us getting better at"
"answering this question because right"
"now we do not have a good science of"
"predicting the goals the cognitive"
"capacities and uh those kind of"
"properties of emergent minds from their"
"pieces we have no idea how to how do we"
"anticipate this none and but but we're"
"creating these things all the time so"
"we're creating internet of things and"
"swarm robotics and social structures and"
"financial structures we make these"
"things all the time we haven't a clue as"
"to what their uh"
"cognitive capacities are going to be and"
"what their goals are going to be never"
"mind to begin to actually manipulate"
"them in a life positive way so"
"that's that question of where where do"
"the goals of novel living novel um"
"cognitive agents come from is is a"
"massively important thing for us to get"
"a handle on"
"very good thank you i would i would"
"argue or i would"
"ask listeners"
"to consider the possibility"
"uh that aharnov"
"puts forth"
"that the future has a causal impact on"
"the present it seems like an intuitive"
"possible response and his"
"his framework is rigorous"
"it's experimental and it's very very"
"interesting and i think i would argue"
"that it has important"
um
"implications for"
"artificial intelligence"
and
"for how we organize ourselves"
"politically and socially as a species"
"with that i'd like to ask about your"
"work on artificial intelligence"
and
"its impact on your ideas and your"
"thinking your experiments"
"can you um"
"talk to us about that please"
"yeah um i i'll maybe i'll start by by"
"giving some uh fundamental um"
"basics of how i think about these things"
"and we can talk specifics"
"i i don't like the distinction i don't"
"like the term artificial intelligence"
"and the reason i don't like it is"
"because much like many other things in"
"this field that i think we have to go"
"and will not survive the next few"
"decades uh it it gives you the idea that"
"there are two discrete kinds of"
"intelligence there's real actual"
"intelligence whatever that is and then"
"there's this artificial intelligence"
"that in some sense is is faking it or or"
"something like that"
"and and what i don't like about it is"
"that uh these these binary categories"
"don't cannot hold and the reason that"
"they cannot hold is is for a couple of"
"uh for a couple of reasons one is that"
uh
"we can make we we can make any sort of"
"chimera that you want so so people say"
"all the time machines can't do this and"
"and you know uh ai's can't do that and"
"and but you know but the humans can they"
"have the real whatever okay we can make"
"any kind of a compositional uh agent"
"that you want so we can in fact we"
"already have humans with various kinds"
"of implants and they're driving"
"wheelchairs with their mind and then"
"soon you know they'll have access to"
"information and other things uh you can"
"make any sort of combination that you"
"want that's some percentage human some"
"percentage uh desi you know designed um"
"electronics and software and whatever"
and
"if you then are if you're still"
"maintaining that there's some sort of"
"sharp line to be drawn you're going to"
"have these incredibly unsolvable"
"arguments about exactly what kind of"
"agent is in or out in your in your uh"
"you know sort of bubble of real real"
"humans when the human when it when an"
"incred when a massive variety of humans"
"starts to show up with all kinds of"
"different mixes between technology so"
"i don't think i don't think it's it's"
"reasonable to try to paint some sort of"
"a sharp line that that's first second i"
"find that a lot of people have this"
"belief that uh humans are somehow or or"
"you know other animals are somehow real"
"and these things that we are making are"
"less likely to be cognitive and i find"
"that very very puzzling because if"
"somebody said to me ahead of time"
"on the one hand i have a project of"
"evolution which is this basically random"
"hill climbing search that's just as"
"likely to increase complexity as to"
"decrease it at any given moment and it's"
"sort of like this this this uh"
"meandering search through fitness space"
"there's that and then there's and then"
"there's rational design where a bunch of"
"really smart um engineers try actually"
"try to build something that's"
"intelligent which of those things is"
"more likely to produce an intelligent"
"agent i mean i i don't see any reason to"
"say that evolutionary search is uh is is"
"producing some kind of um"
"especially blessed or stamped uh uh"
"intelligent agent it seems to me that"
"in the past that's where agents came"
"from but that's i i see no reason to"
"think that that's the best way to make"
"agents um"
"i think that it's a holdover really from"
"a from a kind of pre-scientific"
"religious view where where"
"people thought that humans were created"
"by god and therefore they're special and"
"then humans aren't going to be able to"
"duplicate that"
"that part is gone now so we know that"
"this is there's a naturalistic origin to"
"to love to life and it seems to be"
"inevitable that if if the if the process"
"of evolution can generate intelligence"
"so can engineers why because engineers"
"can do both they can use evolutionary"
"techniques when they want to so"
"evolutionary algorithms and they have"
"the benefit of much more rational design"
so
"so i don't see any a priori reason why"
"artificial intelligence should be of a"
"you know kind of a lesser kind in in"
"principle now at the moment i think the"
"current what what passes for current ai"
"is is not capturing some of the uh"
"really critical aspects that it takes to"
"be a true um"
"a true cognitive agent"
"however uh so but but we'll get there i"
"have no reason to think that we're not"
"going to get there i don't see why we"
"wouldn't i don't think there's anything"
"that evolution can do that that human"
"engineers could not uh could not imitate"
"in time so so we'll we'll get there for"
sure
"okay point taken about artificial"
"intelligence i suppose i was referring"
"to the the current state of the art in"
"computer science where"
"or machine learning maybe is the better"
"the better term to use where"
"a machine learning model is is prepared"
"it takes inputs gives results those"
"results are then"
"fed back in and weighted and differently"
"uh with the idea of getting an optimal"
"uh result no"
"that's the idea that i was referring to"
"so so this this idea about the future"
"um and optimizing results"
through
"weighted input"
or
"yeah input with different weights"
"attached to it"
"can we apply this idea to"
"your work"
"especially your ideas about the future"
"and where we're going"
"because obviously humans are not going"
"to going to agree about it right"
technology
"already enables us to do things that"
"some people don't agree with"
so
"we have to decide somehow we have to"
"figure out a way of deciding"
"how we're going to evolve"
"right have you given much thought to"
"this and what are the implications of"
"your work"
for
"that conflict between"
"different conceptions of"
"what people want"
"from the future or what objectives"
"people have and this brings"
"in my view brings your"
work
"ties your work directly to"
"things like social science and politics"
"and voting theory have you given much"
"thought to this"
"i i have with the caveat that i'm"
"certainly not an expert in politics or"
"social theory or voting or any of that"
"but but i've certainly thought about it"
"from from the perspective of our work uh"
"i i am i am uh not a great fan of uh"
"collectivist ideas about what what we"
"should be without without minimizing the"
"risks because i do i do think there are"
"significant risks but without minimizing"
"significant risk the the the importance"
"of these risks i think that we have to"
"keep uh perspective you know the first"
"guy i remember this i read this story"
"about the first guy to i believe it's in"
"london to uh come outside with an"
"umbrella right and so he was basically"
"he was he was mobbed by and you know and"
"people threw rocks and and so on because"
"this was an invention at the time that"
"was considered unacceptable how is it"
"that he was the only one that wasn't"
"going to get wet and it looks ridiculous"
"and this and that and and and people"
"were very much against it so uh i i"
"think that a healthy society uh in in"
"many ways and i think this resonates"
"with with current trends in in in"
"the world uh we we"
"we have to be very careful with putting"
"limitations on people i think that"
"everybody should have the opportunity to"
"rise to their full potential if that"
"involves uh swapping out your sensor"
"senses and putting in implants and"
"whatever it's going to be it may not it"
"may or may not match somebody else's"
"idea of what is what a typical human"
"should look like i'm i i'm not"
"into this idea of we also somehow have"
"to agree on what's acceptable and what's"
"not acceptable we are um the in the re"
"and the reason is again in"
"pre-scientific times"
"there you could you could maintain this"
"view that that god created what's"
"natural what we see this is natural god"
"made it and therefore this is the right"
"way and if you deviate from this you're"
"likely to cause a lot of problems that's"
"that's that's a view"
"we no longer live in that world what we"
"see is that"
"there are massive problems the current"
"natural quote-unquote natural state is"
"not an ideal state by any means"
"evolution does not optimize for"
"happiness it doesn't optimize for"
"intelligence it doesn't optimize for any"
"of the values that uh that we care about"
"it optimizes for biomass that's really"
"all that evolution is optimizing for and"
"i i think we can absolutely do better"
"and i think it's a moral"
"responsibility for us now that we have"
"the capacity to guide what before was"
"basically a meandering kind of a random"
"search process we now have the ability"
"the ability to actually guide it towards"
"life positive ends so i think uh the"
"emphasis needs to be on uh the"
"protection of uh the welfare of all"
"kinds of sentient beings and on the"
"freedom of those beings to express"
"themselves to their full potential"
"whatever whatever that may be so so i'm"
"not i'm not really uh i'm not really"
"supportive of guarding some sort of a"
"centralized um you know kind of agreed"
"upon notion of of what a human is i"
"think i think"
"a human is basically a moral category"
"it's not physical it's not based on"
"physical uh properties it's not based on"
"genetics it's it's a it's a it's a level"
"of care and and concern about other"
"beings and uh and we are all going to be"
"changing ourselves in many ways as we"
"already have the umbrella glasses uh"
"wheelchairs crutches uh setting bones"
"you know the first the first caveman to"
uh
"you know to pick up a stick and do"
"something with it that the others didn't"
"know how to do that's it the race was on"
"after that so i i i don't i think it's a"
"losing proposition to try to limit"
"people in how they're going to express"
"their life in this world"
"yeah good point i think i would i would"
"have to agree with that especially on"
"the freedom aspect on the other hand"
"if you allow people to be free which we"
"should definitely do"
"does it stand to reason that some of"
"some actions will lead to"
"greater well-being for those individuals"
"choosing that freedom and some may in"
"fact prosper while others will"
"or may uh cease to exist"
"is that a possibility"
"well i i'm not going to claim that i"
"have the solution to the oldest uh sort"
"of problem of mankind which is how to uh"
"how to arrange a happy life for"
"absolutely everybody right so so the"
"last thing i would do is claim a"
"solution to that i don't have a solution"
"to that um however for my admittedly"
"amateur uh observations of history when"
"one looks at policies aimed to uh"
"to to to to suppress uh uh freedom and"
"advancement in the in the hopes of um"
"uh uh keeping uh sort of the bottom of"
"the scale propped up uh to to me those"
"those attempts have gone have ended very"
"poorly and you know i i was born in in"
"the ussr um i lived i've lived there uh"
"not a great fan of of those kind of"
"approaches and so i i think that i i"
"don't have an answer for any for for"
"inequality i i've never heard of a"
"scheme that is uh reasonably uh expected"
"to do away with inequality i don't think"
"that that that may be impossible uh at"
"some point"
"but uh but i think the only thing to do"
"is to help is to is to let everyone do"
"the best they can and establish policies"
"for helping everybody to do what they"
"can are they're going to be are there"
"going to be individuals that make uh"
"harmful choices for themselves"
"undoubtedly and i don't have a great"
"solution that preserves our our freedom"
"while making sure that nobody makes bad"
"choices i'm not sure that's even"
possible
"yeah good points you raise um as a"
"as a final"
"stretch of the conversation i'd like to"
"turn to a concept that you raise"
"it's tied to what we've just talked"
"about i think"
"uh you talk about how"
cells
"uh cooperate"
"it's also related to the to your"
"conception of intelligence and scaling"
"of intelligence"
"you talk about how cells"
"cooperate but also how they compete"
"so this competitive cooperation"
"and the math that's behind it"
because
"a lot a lot of your work is focused on"
bioelectricity
and
"at the most fundamental level what"
"governs bioelectricity"
"is coulomb's law no and the inverse"
"square law so this math that's that's at"
"the core of your of your work and your"
research
"so let me think again of what my what my"
"point my question is"
"the math that you're working on with"
"bioelectricity and competitive"
cooperation
"so we've just said that we don't we"
"can't think of a way of"
balancing
freedom
"equality etc"
"do you think it's promising to look at"
"the math"
"of the work that you're doing and"
"especially this competitive cooperation"
"and the mathematics of bioelectricity"
"you think that might be"
"promising to to research"
"i'm not sure there's a direct link from"
"the from the math itself maybe i'm not"
"sure what i do think is the case is that"
"we can learn a lot about how large scale"
"structures deform the action space for"
"their parts so uh we've done some work"
"and this is not published so you"
"wouldn't have seen it yet but we've done"
"some work on how evolutionary uh forces"
"uh impose artificial competition and"
"scarcity on even the parts of one body"
"but you know the competition between"
"cells in the same body and so"
"to the extent that we learn which kinds"
"of larger scale structures"
"uh achieve their goals by pitting their"
"parts against each other in various ways"
"we may get a little bit wiser in making"
"choices about what larger scale social"
"structures we set up for ourselves and"
"you know and and for the community i"
"think that drawing direct comparisons is"
"very dangerous uh as we know from from"
"people who have tried to draw those"
"comparisons from evolutionary theory"
"right to try to base some kind of social"
"policy on a misunderstanding of"
"uh of what evolutionary dynamics are"
"doing um"
"so so you know my story and and people"
"have asked me this question okay i i"
"tell this story of cellular uh"
"cooperation and the wiping of identity"
"and so they sort of go uh scale up and"
"are able to achieve these of tremendous"
"larger scale goals that single cells"
"can't do and so people say okay so"
"should does that then mean that we"
"should all be connected to each other"
"and our identities partially wiped the"
"way that cells do i i don't think that's"
"the case either because there's no"
"guarantee that the higher level system"
"has your uh your welfare in mind so when"
"you go let's say"
"when you go rock climbing and you sort"
"of rub all the skin off of your fingers"
"you have you as a larger scale system"
"have a great time and you've achieved"
"some goals and you're very happy about"
it
"you've spent exactly zero time bemoaning"
"the loss of these individual cells that"
"were part of your organism and so i"
"think we need to keep in mind that these"
"higher these higher levels don't"
"necessarily preserve the welfare of of"
"the of the parts so it's very dangerous"
"to just say okay we're going to sort of"
"collectivize ourselves into this"
"massive uh central intelligence and then"
"life will be good"
"what it what it does suggest is that we"
"need a better understanding of the"
"scaling policies so that maybe somewhere"
"in there is a policy that optimizes some"
"sort of uh"
"uh a trade-off that that we would like"
"that we would enjoy"
"between the the benefits of being a"
"collective intelligence and the um"
"kind of a focus on on the welfare of the"
"individuals so so maybe there's a good"
"policy there it's certainly uh not i you"
"know not something that we've already"
"claimed to to establish but it should be"
"sought for"
"excellent excellent thank you well a"
"very quick personal plug i've written a"
"book called competitive cooperation"
"where i where i make this argument where"
"i think we can get the benefits of"
um
both
"uh individualism and capitalism"
"and the benefits of cooperation and"
"collectivism while protecting us"
"simultaneously from from either one"
"and i use the the the physics and the"
"math that you're working with the"
"coulomb's draw and the inverse square"
law
"so um just a very a very quick plug-in"
"for for listeners um excellent um"
"professor i want to be respectful of"
"your time can you tell us uh what we can"
"expect from from you what you're working"
"on and and what you'd like to do some of"
"your company how are your companies"
"doing do you have do you plan to bring"
"uh this technology to europe anytime"
"soon etc"
"uh yeah um well let's see uh there are"
"there are two companies right now"
"there's a company called more"
"phaceuticals inc which is uh"
"all about the use of"
"manipulating bioelectrical information"
"processing for regeneration in"
"particular for limb regeneration and"
"other organ repair there's another"
"company called fauna systems which is"
"all about"
"biorobotics and creating uh synthetic"
"living machines out of skin cells that"
"will do various useful things and teach"
"us about uh morphogenesis"
"and so uh those companies are are doing"
"fine but they're it's extremely early"
"days we're basically just starting at"
"this point uh so i'm i certainly hope"
"they will be active in europe as well"
"right now they're based in the in the us"
"again just just starting days and yeah"
"my group is doing all sorts of things uh"
"from the"
"sort of conceptual trying to develop"
"these conceptual frameworks of how to"
"understand um"
"uh all the questions that we were"
"dealing with today and how to drive"
"those conceptual frameworks into uh"
"predictive algorithms that would help us"
"to design better better bots"
"achieve regenerative medicine fix birth"
"defects all these kinds of things so you"
"know we have applications in the areas"
"of cancer and and uh regenerative repair"
"and and and those kinds of things so"
"yeah stay tuned there's hopefully lots"
"more lots more coming this year and"
"after that"
"can you stick quickly the your your"
"website and and your information where"
"you where you gather it"
"yeah you can find all of this stuff is"
"on my website it's uh"
drmik11.org
"one word"
"drmichael11.org and i also have a"
"twitter presence at uh at drmik11"
fantastic
"well uh professor thank you so much for"
"this conversation like i said i think"
"your work is just uh absolutely"
"fascinating and important thank you for"
"sharing some of that with us today and"
"best of luck in your"
"in your continued work"
"thank you so much yeah this was a great"
"great conversation really appreciate it"
"thank you"
[Music]
you
