"well thank you so much um and uh thank"
"you especially to the organizers for"
"allowing me to share some thoughts with"
"you all this has been an amazing"
"Symposium for lots of interesting ideas"
"and in particular we've heard a lot"
"about the intersection of artificial"
"intelligence and Neuroscience and so"
"what I'd like to do is"
"talk about some ideas of that borrowed"
"from neuroscience and deployed outside"
"the brain and in particular this idea"
"that biology offers if if we want to use"
"biology as an inspiration for AI biology"
"offers many many uh interesting contexts"
"that are not brains and so I'd like to"
"sort of pull us away from the"
"Neuroscience of the brain and and think"
"of some other things and if anybody"
"wants to reach me later um all of the"
"primary data the papers every software"
"everything else is is here so um many"
"many discussions still to this day take"
"place in the context of this very old"
"idea that this is of course Adam naming"
"the animals in the Garden of Eden this"
"idea that that there's a specific"
"natural kind called the human brain and"
"it does various things and we would like"
"to of course uh you remind that for"
"insights as to how we can create"
intelligence
"but one of the things that is is really"
"critical to note is that if we take"
"developmental biology and evolution"
"seriously all of us uh began life as"
"single cells and uh whether on the on"
"evolutionary time scale or a"
"developmental time scale there's a"
"Continuum here and these Pro and these"
"this these Transformations are very slow"
"and continuous of course we can try to"
"pick out what we call Great Transitions"
"and try to impose some sort of phase"
"transition on these but the underlying"
"biology is very smooth and continuous"
"and then of course now we have this"
"additional axis of manipulations we can"
"make where where we can step away from"
"the standard human architecture and both"
"with technological hybrids and with with"
"biological modifications make any sort"
"of combination that you want and so uh"
"in our lab we think very uh very very"
"hard about these kinds of issues where"
"does intelligence come from and how does"
"it scale up through these kinds of"
"Transformations so the the important"
"thing about us is that we and I I think"
"all intelligences really are collective"
intelligences
"so what you're seeing here this is a"
"single cell this is what we're made of"
"although this of course is a unicellular"
"organism uh they're called a lacrum area"
"there's no brain there's no nervous"
"system uh but it's it's handling all of"
"its local needs uh in in one cell so you"
"see you know if you're into Soft"
"Robotics or things like this the level"
"of control and and morphological"
"computation here is is remarkable and"
"all of us uh made this journey across"
"the Cartesian cut we all started life as"
"quote unquote just physics so a little"
"pile of chemicals is a quiescent oocyte"
"and then there's this slow and"
"remarkable process of embryonic"
"development that produces something like"
"this or perhaps even something like this"
"and so at some point uh you know we we"
"have we have folks who will say that uh"
"well we we are are certainly uh"
"conscious uh and and we have a certain"
"level of cognition and of course"
"um an oocyte many people will say is not"
"and so then they they owe a story of how"
"you get from here to here given how slow"
"and continuous this process actually is"
"and so what I want to do uh for the for"
"the next couple of minutes is just talk"
"about some interesting biology that"
"isn't the standard thing that uh that"
"we're all used to these are examples"
"that aren't usually covered in in"
"typical Neuroscience um AI kind of"
"crossovers so um one thing that uh"
"should be looked at is this kind of"
"example where you have a caterpillar"
"this is a soft bodied robot it lives in"
"a two-dimensional world of uh crawling"
"on and eating leaves and then it needs"
"to become this which is a hard-bodied"
"robot Which flies in three-dimensional"
"space and has a completely different"
"brain what happens in between is that"
"the brain is basically taken apart most"
"of the cells are killed off all the"
"connections are broken everything is"
"basically liquefied rebuilt from scratch"
"and the amazing thing is that uh"
"actually there's there's data showing"
"that moths and butterflies retain the"
"memories of the original caterpillar and"
"so despite the fact that the medium is"
"uh radically uh"
"radically altered the memories actually"
"remain so that's an interesting fact"
"about this biological architecture that"
"we have to keep in mind if we're going"
"to try to make something similar that"
"also raises interesting questions you"
"know never mind what's it like to be a"
"butterfly right for people who are into"
"Consciousness what's it like to be a"
"caterpillar turning into a butterfly"
"during your lifetime not just the"
"evolutionary time scale but actually"
"during your lifetime a radical"
"reconstruction of your cognitive medium"
"this is uh goes even further with"
"planaria so these are flatworms I'll"
"talk about them more in a few minutes"
"but the Salient fact about planaria is"
"that this this system can be cut into"
"many pieces the record is something like"
"I think 275 or something like that"
"um and every piece will will rebuild"
"regenerate and give rise to a perfect"
"little worm so what McConnell discovered"
"and we validated using modern techniques"
"recently is that if you train a"
"planarian a planaria have a centralized"
"brain they have the same"
"neurotransmitters that you and I do"
"if you train the plenary on a specific"
"task you amputate the head the tail sits"
"there doing nothing for about 10 days"
"regrows a brand new brain at which point"
"Behavior resumes and then you can show"
"that it still has the original"
"information so not only is the"
"information stored uh somewhere else in"
"the body possibly in some sort of"
"distributed holographic form we don't"
know
"but it can also be imprinted onto the"
"new brain as the brain develops so you"
"see this this tight interaction between"
"between morphogenesis the shaping of uh"
"of the cognitive organs and the"
"information the the behavioral uh"
"knowledge that is spread and and moves"
throughout
"um throughout tissues and this kind of"
"plasticity is not just for invertebrates"
"uh vertebrates have it too this is a"
"tapple of the Frog xenopus labus here's"
"the mouth here the nostrils here's the"
"brain the gut and what you'll notice is"
"that it's missing the primary eyes so"
"we've we've made this particular embryo"
"to not have any primary eyes but we did"
"put some eye cells on the tail not only"
"do they go on to make a perfectly nice"
"eye even though it's surrounded by"
"muscle instead of next to the brain"
"where it belongs but actually these"
"animals can see quite well so we've made"
"we've made a device that trains them on"
"visual tasks and automates the whole"
"process and uh and we can see that even"
"though this this eye does not connect to"
"the brain it makes an optic nerve that"
"sometimes synapses on the spinal cord"
"sometimes goes up here to the gut but"
"these animals can see so this this does"
"not take uh long periods of evolutionary"
"adaptation in in one generation this"
"animal finds itself with a radically"
"altered uh sensory motor architecture no"
"problem it's getting"
"and the brain is getting this weird uh"
"these weird signals from some itchy"
"patch of tissue on its tail and it can"
"treat that as visual data and learn in"
"visual acids so so so remarkable and"
"we'll get to the we'll get to this uh"
"this this notion that what evolution is"
"giving us here is a kind of um a"
"problem-solving machine it's not"
"something that's just just knows how to"
"do one thing it can it very rapidly"
"adapt to novel configurations in"
"morphological space and so the the way"
"that biology does this is that"
"not only uh structurally but actually"
"functionally we are all nested dolls at"
"every level of organization from the"
"Swarm to the organ tissue cell and"
"molecular Network level all of these"
"layers are uh problem solving types of"
"processes so so we so I call this a"
"multi-scale competency architecture"
"with the idea that uh some of the same"
"navigation policies are being used to"
"solve problems in different spaces"
"metabolic spaces transcriptional spaces"
"morphological spaces and then of course"
"the familiar 3D behavioral space of"
"running mazes and doing things like that"
"so so uh each each of these layers is"
"its own uh kind of kind of"
"problem-solving system and this is this"
"is why there's another talk that I give"
"to students sometimes called why robots"
"don't get cancer and that's because we"
"we don't have very many architectures"
"yet where the individual Parts have"
"their own agendas and thus there's this"
"failure mode whereby they can be"
"decoupled from the from the collective"
"top-down agenda and sort of go off on"
"their own and make a tumor and do other"
"things so um so that that's that's the"
"risk of this architecture that's the"
"failure mode but but what you gain is is"
"incredible plasticity and robustness"
"and so what I'm interested in as far as"
"understanding how these things help us"
"to to recognize and to build"
"intelligences is uh something like like"
"this to develop a framework where we can"
"abstract the notion of intelligence and"
"for this audience I think I think that's"
"very easy for for other audiences um"
"this is this is a hard leap to make uh"
"step away from the idea that"
"intelligence is something that large"
"large brains do and have a more kind of"
"cybernetic approach where and I'm"
"certainly not the first person to"
"suggest this you know here's here's uh"
"Rose and Lutheran and Bigelow trying for"
"a kind of hierarchy of of of cognitive"
"capacities all the way from passive"
"Behavior up to human level metacognition"
"and so on so uh in in our group"
"intelligence we understand intelligence"
"in the way that William James said which"
"is roughly the ability to reach the same"
"goal by different means and the degree"
"of sophistication of those means and the"
"degree to which uh you can handle"
"various perturbations along the way is"
"is how you gauge the type and the amount"
"of intelligence and as somebody said"
"once um it sort of it describes the"
"Continuum between two magnets trying to"
"get together and Romeo and Juliet trying"
"to get together right what what What"
"mechanisms exist um on all the different"
"systems on that Continuum to help them"
"do what they need to do so"
"um of course we're all very good at as"
"many animals are at recognizing"
"intelligence in uh the three-dimensional"
"world right so so medium-sized objects"
"moving at medium speeds doing things we"
"we very easily recognize as having"
"agency and and having intelligence but"
"actually there are many other spaces in"
"which biology has been solving problems"
"long before brains showed up and so"
"imagine if if we had an innate sense of"
"our blood chemistry or uh if we had an"
"innate sense of various gene expression"
"profiles we would have no trouble at all"
"uh um intuitively recognizing our"
"various organs our various cells as"
"navigating those spaces with very"
"significant competency and then right"
"now we you know we're just not we're"
"just not primed for that so I'm going to"
"um spend most of my time talking about"
"this morphospace the the behavior of a"
"collective intelligence of cells in this"
"morphological space but um one one idea"
"that we've been playing with is that"
"what basically has happened is that"
"Evolution has basically pivoted some of"
"the same strategies across all kinds of"
"different problem spaces all the way"
"from metabolic and physiological spaces"
"up through anatomical space classic"
"behavioral space and then maybe"
"linguistic linguistic space as well and"
"so I just want to show you a few"
"examples of of what I mean by these"
"unconventional intelligences so this is"
"a Sly mold uh this is uh this is called"
"fisaram polycephalum and uh what we've"
"done is we've placed the slime mold here"
"in the middle of the by the way the"
"slime mold is unicellular it's one cell"
"it can get very large but it's it's just"
"one cell and what we've done is we've"
"placed one disc one glass disc over here"
"three glass discs over here and this is"
"just one example out of a out of a paper"
"um where where we did this many many"
"times and it has a very interesting"
"Behavior Uh by the way these glass discs"
"are completely inert there's no food"
"there are no gradients um they're just"
"they're just glass and so so what"
"happens is that uh for the first for the"
"first few hours it's sort of the slime"
"mold sort of grows like this and at this"
"point there's no obvious indication that"
"it's going to do anything other than"
"continue symmetrically growing but"
"during this time it turns out that what"
"it's been doing is gathering information"
"about its environment the way it does"
"that is by gently squeezing it"
"continuously pulses uh the the medium"
"that it's on and reads back the strain"
"angle of the signals that it gets and"
"what it does after that is it grows"
"towards the larger Mass and you can do"
"all kinds of interesting tricks about"
"stacking the the uh the the glass discs"
"one on top of the other you can you can"
"you can get the thing tilted and do"
"various things to confuse it but this is"
"what it does here it gathers information"
"and uh Boom at that point right right"
"right right here is where you can now"
"tell that it's decided what it's going"
"to do so this is this is kind of"
"interesting the spaces that we talk"
"about are"
"um they're our abstraction right because"
"behavior for this system is"
"morphological change so this is kind of"
"a transitional form in which behavior"
"and control of morphology are the same"
"but that's the sort of thing the single"
"single celled organism can do here's"
"another here's another type of"
intelligence
"um these we discovered something"
"interesting in these planaria where if"
"you put planaria in a solution of barium"
"barium chloride what the barium does is"
"it's a non-specific ION channel blocker"
"a potassium channel blocker to be to be"
"more precise and so what that means is"
"that all the cells especially the cells"
"in the head which have to exchange"
"potassium so all the neurons are"
"extremely unhappy they literally their"
"heads literally explode in this barium"
"so overnight it's going deep progression"
"boom their heads explode"
"but if you leave them in the barium"
"something amazing happens and a couple"
"weeks later they will grow a new head"
"and the new head is completely barium"
"adapted doesn't care about barium at all"
"no problem so we asked a simple question"
"we took these barium adapted heads we"
"took the primary original heads and we"
"simply asked what what Gene expressions"
"are different what what does this what"
"does this new head do in terms of gene"
"expression that's different from this"
"head and there's only there's only a"
"handful of genes that are actually"
"different and what they allow these"
"cells to do is to do their physiological"
"business despite not being able to pass"
"potassium that's a pretty significant"
"change but there's only a handful of"
"genes now the the kicker to all this is"
"that uh planarian never experienced"
"barium in the wild that's that it's just"
"not ecologically um realistic that"
"there's never been an evolutionary"
"history of of pressure for knowing what"
"to do when you're hit with barium and so"
"I always think about this problem as"
"kind of like being trapped in this in"
"this uh nuclear reactor control room the"
"things melting down there if you know"
"what 20 000 or however many genes"
"they're our buttons and you're faced"
"with this novel stressor how do you know"
"which thing is going to improve your"
"physiological situation you certainly"
"don't have the cells don't turn over"
"very fast so you don't have time to for"
"to for random search you don't really"
"have time for gradient descent uh we we"
"don't know we don't know how this works"
"maybe there's some sort of"
"generalization from other types of"
"things like epileptic excitotoxicity"
"that that maybe they do have but um it's"
"it's an amazing ability to walk through"
"that transcriptional space in a way that"
"efficiently allows you to solve for a"
"completely novel"
"um physiological stressor so I've shown"
"you a couple of examples of of problem"
"solving in in these in these unusual"
"spaces but what I want to spend the most"
"of my time doing is talking about"
"morphospace morphogenesis and it's and"
"it's interesting this this idea of"
"morphogenesis as being relevant to uh"
"the problem of intelligence is not new"
"so um obviously uh the the Alan Turing"
"needs no introduction he was interested"
"in problem solving machines intelligence"
"through plasticity reprogrammability and"
"so on but you may or may not know that"
"he also wrote this he wrote a paper on"
"the chemical basis of morphogenesis now"
"why would somebody who is interested in"
"intelligence and machines"
"be interested in the chemistry of"
"spontaneous self-organization and"
"morphogenesis he didn't say much about"
"this but I think I think he was on to"
"something very deep I think he"
"understood and I think it's this is this"
"is true that these are fundamentally the"
"same problem there's a there's a very"
"strong kind of invariance between these"
"two problems and we should um we should"
"investigate those so so let's talk about"
this
"so uh"
"we all we all begin as this this sort of"
"collection of blastomeres that uh arises"
"from from the fertilized egg and then"
"eventually we become something like this"
"so this is a cross-section through a"
"human torso so look at this amazing"
"order right everything all the organs"
"the structures everything is in the"
"right place next to you know the right"
"thing and uh incredibly robust this this"
"works correctly most of the time so"
"um uh the the the the amazing thing is"
"that is that uh and so and so we can we"
"can ask okay where does the information"
"come from where people I'll say this all"
"the time where is the information"
"encoded for this particular layout well"
"of course you might want to say DNA but"
"of course we can read genomes now DNA"
"doesn't say anything about this directly"
"any more than it directly says anything"
"about the shape of a spider web or the"
"shape of a um of a termite Colony"
"um uh it uh it provides the micro level"
"Hardware what the DNA gives you are the"
"protein sequences that every single cell"
"gets to have once you have those protein"
"sequences now comes physiology which"
"happens which which I like to think of"
"as a as a as a layer of software that um"
"is is executed by this machine which"
"does some really interesting things and"
"uh the key is that even though this"
"process is very reliable it is not"
"hardwired so if you take an early"
"mammalian embryo for example human"
"and you cut it in half you don't get two"
"half embryos what you get are two"
"perfectly normal monozygotic twins each"
"half recognizes the other half is"
"missing and produces exactly what it"
"needs in fact you can cut it into more"
"pieces than that so we have this notion"
"that regulative development in in"
"animals which can do it which are most"
"of them"
"um is a kind of navigation of morphe"
"space if I boil down uh the shape or the"
"the space of all possible anatomical"
"configurations which is a kind of"
"quantitative morphe space what we want"
"is we want to be able to reach a"
"particular Ensemble of goal state so the"
"target morphology of this particular"
"species from different starting"
"positions despite various local Maxima"
"and different different uh barriers and"
"things like that right so so we can"
"think about morphogenesis as a"
"navigation of this virtual space now"
"here's an example it's not just for for"
"development regeneration does this too"
"so here's a here's a salamander known as"
"an axolotl these guys regenerate their"
"eyes their jaws their tails including"
"spinal cord their limbs their ovaries"
"and you can see what happens in the limb"
"if if they lose a portion of the limit"
"it doesn't matter where along the axis"
"it's lost the cells will very rapidly"
"grow exactly what's needed and then they"
"stop this is the most amazing part is"
"that they start up when do they stop"
"they stop when the correct salamander"
"arm has been completed so this means"
"that what you really have here is a kind"
"of homeostatic"
"homeostatic process whereby"
"this this this group of cells uh is able"
"to navigate that morphos space from"
"different positions to the right region"
"recognize that they got where they're"
"going and then they can stop and so"
"here's another here's another example"
"this is something that we discovered"
"some years back where here's a tadpole"
"so the tadpole has the eyes the nostrils"
"the mouth and so on uh tadpoles need to"
"become frogs in order to do that all the"
"pieces have to move around they have to"
"rearrange and so you might think and and"
"people used to think that this was"
"somehow hardwired that every part of the"
"face moves in a particular direction a"
"particular amount and then you get from"
"being a normal tadpole to a normal face"
"so we wanted to test this idea that this"
"is some kind of hardwired process and so"
"what we did was we created these"
"so-called Picasso tadpoles so everything"
"is is scrambled basically the eyes might"
"be on top of the head the mouth is off"
"to the side Everything is Everything is"
"is messed up and largely these type of"
"animals result in pretty normal frogs"
"because all of these different organs"
"will keep moving in novel paths in fact"
"sometimes having to double back if they"
"go too far and eventually they stop when"
"they reach the correct frog face so what"
"the genetics actually gives you is a"
"kind of error minimization scheme and we"
"thought really hard about how is this"
"possible how is a collection of cells"
"supposed to recognize this kind of stop"
"condition right how does it how does it"
"take measurements of what's going on now"
"you know how how what's the how does the"
"attractor here work what what's going on"
"and we started thinking about how"
"goal-seeking Behavior because"
"fundamentally that's what this is right"
"in the cybernetic sense this is a goal"
"seeking system there's a particular set"
"of states that will expend energy to"
"attain even if you try to deviate it and"
"to push it off of that state so how does"
"this work well"
"um kind of the obvious"
"example is what happens in the brain and"
"so and so in the brain we know what the"
"hardware looks like we know some of the"
"behaviors of the of the software layer"
"and there's this there's this idea which"
"several people have talked about today"
"of neural decoding the idea idea that if"
"we understood how to decode the"
"electrical activity so this is a"
"zebrafish movie um as a movie of a"
"zebrafish brain in the living State as"
"it's uh doing whatever whatever"
"computations that it's doing if we"
"understood how to decode this the"
"commitment of Neuroscience is that"
"that's where the cognition is we would"
"know the memories the preferences the"
"behavioral repertoire we could we could"
"somehow somehow decode that but the"
"interesting thing is that this this kind"
"of this kind of Architecture is"
"extremely ancient and long before brains"
"and neurons appeared you had exactly the"
"same thing in the rest of the body"
"whereas let's go back to uh to this for"
"a second whereas the way this works is"
"that the electric circuits make various"
"decisions that are then used to control"
"muscles to move your body in"
"three-dimensional space where this comes"
"from is a much more ancient system where"
"the same electrical circuits control"
"various cell behaviors not just muscles"
"but all cell behaviors cell movements"
"cell division cell differentiation shape"
"change and so on to move the"
"configuration of the body in morphe"
"space I think that what evolution did in"
"uh in creating"
"um uh creating nervous systems is that"
"it repurposed the system uh and and of"
"course sped optimized it because because"
"the original system works at the scale"
"of hours not milliseconds and also made"
"some trade-offs of space for time in"
"terms of what um what it what it"
"measures but what you can do then is you"
"can think of the exact same kind of"
"research program that comes from"
"neuroscience and say okay could we use"
"actually this all the same techniques to"
"track the uh the the physiological"
"activity of this process and try to"
"decode it what is what are the"
"electrical networks of the body thinking"
"about what Memories do they have what"
"behavioral repertoires do they have and"
"so the fact is that every cell in your"
"body has ion channels most cells have"
"electrical synapses to their neighbors"
"that so effectively propagate electrical"
"States and uh and so you can you can see"
"here this whole this whole story of how"
"we got to neurons from other cell types"
"but uh the interesting thing is that um"
"uh most of the techniques of"
"Neuroscience in fact do not distinguish"
"I mean everything works we've we've"
"carried over many things uh from"
"Neuroscience into other contexts and so"
"uh the kinds of things that serve as"
"neural Inspirations for AI and for for"
"intelligence for um Consciousness a few"
"people talked about Consciousness the"
"mechanisms of all this are in fact"
"ubiquitous in the body they're"
"everywhere there are very few"
"um of of the kinds of things that"
"certain theories of Consciousness uh for"
"example um uh talk about in the brain"
"most of these underlying processes are"
"actually ubiquitous and so so that that"
"may have implications for for where we"
"think Consciousness could be could be"
"found so I want to show you just one one"
"example uh this is a uh time lapse video"
"of an early frog embryo putting its face"
together
"um so here this is a this is uh the way"
"we do the Imaging is with a voltage"
"sensitive fluorescent dye very similar"
"to how you might look at electrical"
"activity in the brain uh and one frame"
"out of that video looks like this this"
"is a snapshot of an early uh of an early"
"pre-pattern that tells these cells where"
"all the organs of the face are going to"
"go um here's where the first eye is"
"going to go here's where the mouth is"
"going to go the placards uh this is this"
"is a glimpse of a deco and the reason"
"I'm showing you this is because this is"
"one of the easiest to decode in fact it"
"almost looks like a face we call this"
"the electric face"
"um this is a snapshot of what the tissue"
"is thinking as It prepares to turn on"
"the various gene expression domains that"
"are actually going to build these"
"various organs and we know it's"
"functional we it's instructive because"
"if you move any of this if you change"
"these states the anatomy follows and"
"I'll show you in a few examples of that"
"so so so tracking this is all well and"
"good but we want to make changes we want"
"to make fun we want to be able to do"
"functional experiments and for that we"
"don't use electric fields we don't use"
"electrodes really we don't but no no"
"magnetics no EM waves we basically"
"appropriate all the tools of"
"Neuroscience so for these electrical"
"synapses these Gap Junctions we can"
"change the topology or the connectivity"
"of the network by opening and closing"
"these things or introducing new ones"
"for the actual and this this is similar"
"to controlling the synaptic plasticity"
"this is uh the intrinsic plasticity"
"where we can go in and directly change"
"the voltage of individual cells either"
"pharmacologically by opening and closing"
"channels or quite specifically with"
"optogenetics so we can use light to uh"
"to trigger a specific voltage changes"
"and of course we can we can do this at"
"the neurotransmitter level as well and"
"so we have the ability to basically to"
"do what people like tanagawa do when"
"they try to incept false memories into"
"the brains of mice we can incept false"
"pattern memories into non-neural tissues"
"and so all of the tool the these kind of"
"benchtop techniques including the the um"
"kind of the conceptual stuff you know"
"perceptual control theory active"
"influence uh all these kinds of things"
"we we use them routinely to address"
"things going on in the in navigating"
"more for space so here's an example I"
"showed you that electric face we showed"
"you there's a there's a particular"
"pattern that that controls where the eye"
"goes so we simply said okay could we the"
"artificially established that same"
"bioelectric pattern somewhere else in"
"the body what would happen and so here's"
"what happens the way we do it was it"
"puts in this particular case we injected"
"RNA encoding an ion Channel a potassium"
"channel that uh established a little a"
"little spatial domain and The Code by"
"the way is is multicellular it's not"
"single it's not a single cell code so we"
"established a multicellular domain of"
"the right voltage and sure enough these"
"cells build a complete eye they can make"
"this eye anywhere in the gut on the tail"
"anywhere now notice a few interesting"
"things about this first of all it's"
"extremely modular what we are not doing"
"here is telling individual stem cells"
"what to be we are not providing enough"
"information to actually build an eye if"
"we have no idea how to build an eye it"
"eyes have all of these complex"
"structures inside what we're doing is"
"providing a very high level subroutine"
"call it's a trigger that says build an"
"eye here Downstream of that are all the"
"gene Expressions the cell movements"
"everything else that is the"
"implementation Machinery but the trigger"
"that that goal directed behavior that"
"that movement in morphe space that"
"causes these these cells to move from"
"from what um their uh their old kind of"
"morphology was to uh to an eye shape all"
"of that is triggered by a fairly simple"
"bioelectrical State it's almost a"
"stimulus that causes a you know trigger"
"that causes a complex Behavior now the"
"other amazing thing is this"
"um this this right here is a cross"
"section through an ectopic lens like"
"this that's sitting out in the tail of a"
"tadpole somewhere that we induced the"
"blue cells here are the ones that bear"
"the ectopic ION channel this potassium"
"Channel and they're blue because of beta"
"galactosidase label so we can tell which"
"cells we actually injected all the rest"
"of these cells that are participating"
"and making this nice lens are not"
"labeled now what happened here is that"
"when we injected this we didn't get"
"enough cells to make a proper lens and"
"so the first instructive interaction was"
"when we told these cells you should make"
"an eye with our with our voltage signal"
"but then what they have the competency"
"to do is to recruit their neighbors they"
"uh the system can tell that there's not"
"enough of these guys to make an eye and"
"so they recruit as many of their"
"neighbors as needed to actually make"
"this would make this a complete organ we"
"didn't do any of that that's that's"
"built in that's a built-in competency to"
"the system the plasticity of this of the"
"system is ready to receive large organ"
"level uh information to rearrange that"
"large-scale structure and have new"
"behaviors and by the way trigger"
"Downstream uh Cascades such as"
"recruiting other other cell types and"
"and this of course is found in other"
"types of collective intelligences so so"
"ants uh and and termites will um you"
"know recruit their their buddies when"
"when there's a task to be done that's uh"
"that's uh you know kind of requires more"
"of them so there's this there's this"
"these amazing uh interesting"
competencies
"now I want to show you I want to want to"
"show you uh another way to uh to"
"interact with these pattern memories so"
"so here here here are our planaria so"
"one head one tail this is a normal"
"normal worm if you look at where the"
"gene expression is well the anterior"
"marker of course is at the head telling"
"you one head uh one tail and um what"
"what this what this guy will do if we if"
"we chop off the head and the tail that"
"middle fragment will give you a nice"
"one-headed worm 100 of the time they're"
"extremely uh robust with this but what"
"we notice now now you might ask so so"
"there's this fragment how does it know"
"how many heads it's supposed to have"
"right and how does it know uh you know"
"the these cells up here will make a tail"
"these cells here will make a head but"
"they're right next to each other when"
"you cut them apart how do they know what"
"they're supposed to make so we looked"
"and we found this this voltage gradient"
"that basically this is a map of this of"
"this animal telling us oh yeah one head"
"one tail and that in fact is what they"
"built so what we did was we worked out a"
"pharmacological way and by the way uh"
"some of these things uh are exactly uh"
"mirroring so so so"
"um so uh General anesthetics right if"
"you want a bunch of cells to forget what"
"they're supposed to be doing general"
"anesthetic is a really good way to do"
"that um so there's some nice uh there's"
"some nice um analogies to to to to the"
"coherence of of minds and so on so so"
"what you can do is you can uh produce a"
"different pattern that says two heads"
"and this is this is quite messy the"
"technology still is still quite young"
"but you can produce this pattern and if"
"you do that in this animal when you cut"
"him he will produce a two-headed animal"
"this is not Photoshop these are real"
"real life worms even though the genetics"
"are untouched the hardware is exactly"
"the same there's nothing wrong with the"
"with the genetics here we didn't edit"
"the genome and and the other critical"
"thing is that this map is not a map of"
"this two-headed body this is a map of"
"this one-headed animal so it's basically"
"you can think about this as a primitive"
"form of counter factual memory the a"
"kind of very simple simple form in"
"morphe space of what we like about"
"brains which is this ability to time"
"travel to to have memories and predict"
"and make predictions about things that"
"are not true right now so even though"
"anatomically this animal has one head"
"and one tail if you were to look to see"
"what is what is your idea of what the"
"correct planarian looks like that's very"
"clear it's two heads so if you get"
"injured that's what you'll do if you"
"don't get injured nothing happens it's a"
"latent memory that doesn't get activated"
"so when I talk about uh the collective"
"of cells being a real a collective"
"intelligence this is what I mean the the"
"it we can literally read the memories"
"that it has at least in in some cases"
"such as this and we know now very much"
"like in the brain that the same Hardware"
"the same Hardware is capable of having"
"one of two different ideas of what a"
"correct planarian looks like it's it's a"
"representation of a future morphological"
"State the goal of its movement through"
"morphe space if it's called upon to move"
"through morphe space now I keep calling"
"it a memory because"
"uh if you cut these animals so so here's"
"our two-headed worm you cut off the"
"primary head you cut off this crazy"
"ectopic secondary head you take this"
"middle fragment and you might think well"
"the genetics are untouched in plain"
"water it should just go back to normal"
"and make one head one tail that's not"
"what it does the circuit the electrical"
"circuit that keeps this information uh"
"has has memory in fact it has all the"
"properties of memory it's long-term"
"stable it's rewritable by experience not"
"by not by Hardware manipulation but by"
"experience it has latency which I just"
"showed you or conditional recall and it"
"has two possible behaviors so what"
"happens is as far as we can tell in"
"perpetuity once you make these"
"two-headed animals they stay two-headed"
"even though they're genome as wild type"
"and and we now know how to make them go"
"back we can actually reset the circuit"
"so it's kind of like a almost a"
"flip-flop where we can kind of go back"
"and forth between that circuit encoding"
"one state one head or two head kinds of"
"states and here you can see this is a"
"video you can see these these two-headed"
"animals uh"
"um hanging out so um not only can you"
"can you take this this kind of machine"
"and tell it how many heads it's supposed"
"to have you can actually tell it what"
"kind of head to have so here's uh here's"
"a planarian with normally a triangular"
"head shape like this what we can do is"
"amputate the head and then treat the"
"rest of the tissue in a way that"
"basically using a general anesthetic"
"that just all it does so General"
"anesthetics among other things uncouple"
"Gap Junction so they uncouple these"
"electrical synapses and when you"
"uncouple them what happens is the"
"individual cells are still alive but"
"things like uh Global uh kind of kind of"
"global computations go away and then"
"when you pull them out of the the the"
"um when you put up out of the compound"
"they settle down but they don't always"
"settle into the same state actually this"
"is true in in for example humans as well"
"there are there are the reason that they"
"don't like giving general anesthesia to"
"people is that some people have"
"psychotic breaks because the brain does"
"not come back to the same state it's"
"actually to me kind of miraculous that"
"it ever comes back to the same state if"
"you sort of uncouple all the activity"
"but what you can do here with these guys"
"is uh when when they come back they"
"sometimes come back flat-headed like"
"this pflena sometimes they come back"
"round headed like this s Mediterranean"
"and uh the The evolutionary distance"
"here is between between these guys and"
"the actual species it's about 150"
"million years so without genetic change"
"you can explore different attractors in"
"morphospace that other species live in"
"naturally yeah and and maybe this this"
"may be how the speciation happened we we"
"don't know it's not just the shape of"
"the head it's also um on the shape of"
"the brain and the distribution of stem"
"cells are exactly the same as these"
"other species so you get you get the"
"idea of this this incredible"
"reprogrammability and plasticity that"
"goes beyond the default uh kinds of"
"robust behaviors that um that that the"
"standard machine does after uh after"
"development and um not only that but you"
"can explore regions of the latent space"
"uh that are very far from normal"
"planaria so here's your normal planarian"
"we can make these crazy spiky forms we"
"can make something that's cylindrical"
"has a different um uh kind of symmetry"
"body plant symmetry you can make these"
"these kind of hybrid forms and the thing"
"is that a lot of biological uh kinds of"
"um Hardware is extremely reprogrammable"
"so this is these these kinds of things"
"if you've ever seen them in the wild"
"these are called Galls and there's a"
"there's a wasp embryo that's that's in"
"there but these are not made of the WASP"
"cells these are made of the leaf cells"
"of the plant so normally the these cells"
"what they normally do is they make this"
"nice flat leaf and people who are"
"focused on on genetics and molecular"
"biology will say well that's what the"
"genome in codes is is the ability to"
"make these flat leaves but in fact it's"
"very easily hacked by uh by this"
"parasite that gives them signals uh to"
"form something completely different"
"right so the morphology so these Leaf"
"cells are in fact able to form something"
"like this it's just that they normally"
"don't so um I want to uh now uh start to"
"start to pull back and try to really"
"really talk about uh what we mean by a"
"collective intelligence in whatever"
"space it's acting in so this is what"
"happens during evolution is that the"
"components like this which are very"
"competent at very local tiny little"
"goals so metabolicals things that little"
"the things that individual cells do"
"using bioelectricity and other types of"
"modalities including chemical signaling"
"of course by mechanical signaling they"
"scale up to systems that have much"
"bigger goals so this system has has the"
"ability to try to reach this goal"
"something like organogenesis despite all"
"kinds of perturbations that I've shown"
"you and so on so there's there's this"
"scale up of there's a there's a flip in"
"space so so this now is in morphe space"
"and there's a scale up of the kinds of"
"goals that it can achieve but that"
"process of course has failure modes and"
"that failure mode is cancer so this is"
"this is human glioblastoma in a dish"
"what happens is that individual cells"
"when they electrically disconnect from"
"their neighbors and that can be caused"
"by a variety of factors at that point"
"they basically just revert back to their"
"unicellular past they are no longer"
"interested or capable of understanding"
"um the the behavioral cues that bind all"
"of them towards these kind of larger"
"scale construction projects and they go"
"back on their own at that point the rest"
"of the animals just amoeba is just an"
"environment to these to these amoebas"
"and that's metastasis and so"
"um there's a there's a the the utility"
"of of these kinds of uh this kind of"
"thinking where you think about"
"um these these cancer cells they're not"
"more selfish it's just that their selves"
"are smaller the computational boundary"
"has shrunk to the level of a single cell"
"and that leads you naturally to some new"
"Therapeutics so for example here you can"
"see when you induce a human oncogene"
"into these tadpoles and they're going to"
"make a tumor even before the tumor forms"
"you can already see these these"
"bioelectrical disconnections of these"
"cells from the network you know exactly"
"where the tumor is going to be and if"
"you co-inject an ion channel that forces"
"the cells uh to remain in electrical"
"communication doesn't kill the cells"
"doesn't fix the the genetic mutation and"
"you can see that here the oncogene is"
"blazingly expressed this is and it can"
"be a nasty KRS mutation or a p53 or"
"whatever in fact it's all over the place"
"there's no tumor because what drives the"
"whole Collective outcome is uh is is the"
"the behavior of the of the network the"
"the individual cells are are actually"
"much less important here and so you can"
"try to re-expand that sort of cognitive"
"uh boundary uh to uh to to try to get"
"the cells connected with each other and"
"to to pursue organogenesis and so on so"
"this this issue of these these cognitive"
"boundaries between right the the"
"boundary between self and outside world"
"in a standard human you would think it's"
"very simple right it's it's well there's"
"our human there's there's where the body"
"ends although uh you know this this idea"
"of um the extended on the extended mind"
"right um Andy Clarkson and and those"
"kind of ideas are are already stretching"
"that but it's really it's really more"
fundamental
um
"if if you didn't already know what a"
"human was and somebody uh somebody"
"showed you a a brain you know this this"
"you know this uh three and a half or"
"whatever uh pound Mass um how many"
"individual selves would you say are in"
"there you really don't know because we"
"don't have a way of saying you know per"
"per pound this is how many this this is"
"how much real estate it takes to make a"
"self and the same thing is true of"
"embryogenesis when you so this is this"
"is a deep problem of of uh an individual"
"an individual emergent system arising"
"from a sea of uh components"
"this is this is an embryonic blastoderm"
"right it's it's an early let's say 50"
"000 cells and you look at it and you say"
"well that's an embryo and when you look"
"at it given that there's 50 000 cells"
"you can ask yourself"
"um well first of all what are we"
"counting uh what what is an embryo as"
"distinct from the individual cells we're"
"looking at and can we guess how many"
"embryos are present in any particular"
"blasted room I mean usually the answer"
"is one and so you might just like"
"usually there's there's seemingly one"
"individual in a brain but it doesn't"
"have to be one and what can happen is"
"this and I used to do these experiments"
"myself as a grad student you can take an"
"avian or or a mammalian blasted room you"
"take a little needle and you make a"
"little uh you make some scratches in it"
"and what happens is when you make these"
"scratches each domain that can't"
"temporarily because the scratches will"
"heal will temporarily uh will"
"self-organize into a new embryo and when"
"the scratches do heal you end up with"
"conjoint twins and so you will have"
"these regions each of them is a separate"
"embryo then there's some muted zones"
"which is kind of interesting these cells"
"that don't quite know who they belong to"
"but a particular blastoderm can give"
"rise to 0 1 or several individuals now"
"in the in the case of morphogenesis what"
"are individuals well they are"
"collections of cells that are bound to a"
"common purpose they're going to make a"
"specific thing meaning they're going to"
"move to the right region of morphos"
"space they're going to have two eyes and"
"then you know four Limbs and then"
"various other things"
"I mean and that's what we're counting"
"we're counting independent goal"
"following systems and in in this sort of"
"uh um uh excitable medium there can be"
"multiple depending on the Dynamics"
"multiple numbers of them it's not"
"genetically determined I mean usually"
"it's one but it doesn't have to be one"
"and this is this is true in brains as"
"well where we see split brain patients"
"and various dissociative disorders"
"there's no guarantee that in that Medium"
"there's one individual and so"
"um what what we're interested in is is"
"kind of merging these ideas of"
"understanding the the bioelectric"
"circuitry and this in the"
"attractors and the other the other kind"
"of features of that of that state space"
"and merging them with with ideas about"
"uh how memories are stored in electrical"
"networks uh what it means when we can"
"recover a portion of that information"
"after damage and and of course the"
"dynamical systems approaches to this and"
"so on and so what we really need and"
"this is this is very active kind of work"
"in our lab now is to understand the"
"scaling where we start with individual"
"tiny little competent subunits which can"
"do homeostatic things like keep pH and"
"hunger level and so on so so individual"
"cells and then you bind them together"
"into networks that have particular"
"policies for spreading signals back and"
"forth and we can talk about what some of"
"those important policies are and as a"
"result of this what you get is a an"
"increase in what we call the cognitive"
"light cone the the size of the the"
"maximal spatial temporal size of the"
"biggest goal that it can hang on to or"
"they can that it can pursue so"
"individual cells pursue little tiny"
"goals collections of cells pursue bigger"
"goals and so on now now when we talk"
"about these these kind of the size of"
"these goals typically if we ask where do"
"they come from and this the standard"
"answer is well evolutionary selection of"
"course you get them you get them from"
Evolution
"um but what about novelty and we have"
"examples like this uh and I can show you"
"much more on this but but I don't have"
"too much time left uh these are um what"
"we call xenobots xenopus lavis is the"
"name of the frog and we can use frog"
"skin cells to make something to make a"
"biological a robot or a biobot called"
"the xenobot these little these little"
"things running around are just skin"
"they're just frog skin that was"
"liberated from the rest of the animal"
"rebooted into a new kind of Critter with"
"a new Behavior this is a very"
"interesting they have many new behaviors"
"but here's one if you provide them with"
"a bunch of loose cells what they will do"
"is they will run around and collect"
"these cells into little balls and sort"
"of Polish them like this and because the"
"little balls are not passive they're um"
"they're a gentle they're in a gentle"
"material just like the the original they"
"will mature into the next generation of"
"xenobots and continue to do the same"
"thing so this is a kinematic"
"self-replicating system this is kind of"
"Von Neumann's dream you know a robot"
"that goes around and finds um materials"
"in the environment and builds copies of"
"itself but the the the the interesting"
"thing here is that there's never been"
"evolutionary selection to do this no"
"other animal does kinematic"
self-replication
"when you look at these skin cells in"
"Vivo you might think well the only thing"
"they could possibly know how to do is to"
"be this boring two-dimensional layer"
"that keeps the bacteria out you know on"
"the on the outer side of uh of these"
"embryos but in fact liberated from those"
"instructive cues you get to find out"
"that actually they can do all kinds of"
"things by themselves and they have uh"
"within about 48 hours they uh they they"
"exhibit reproductive Behavior that's"
"completely different to how frogs"
"normally reproduce because we've made it"
"impossible for them to reproduce their"
"normal weight this is just skin it can't"
"do any of that other stuff so so this is"
"the the ability of all the parts to have"
"coherent uh novel behaviors and to solve"
"new problems that were not actually"
"anywhere in the training set is is"
"really interesting here and"
"um for that reason"
"uh this incredibly large option space"
"you know all of all of the natural model"
"systems of of biology are here including"
"brains that that we like to get"
"inspiration from but all this other"
"stuff so high brats and cyborgs and"
"hybrids of area kinds you know every"
"combination of of cellular material uh"
"designed engineered material and"
"software is some kind of viable agent so"
"there's this huge kind of uh option"
"space of of Novel um intelligences that"
"I think we really need to mine uh as in"
"in addition to whatever uh insights we"
"can get from from standard brains and so"
"um in the end I'm just gonna close here"
"with a couple of thoughts uh this idea"
"that non-neural bioelectricity is a kind"
"of cognitive glue from for for"
"collective intelligence in morphogenetic"
"space exactly as it serves as the"
"cognitive blue to neurons in the brain"
"and in traditional behavioral space"
"um I I think it has some some"
"interesting things uh to say to"
"neuroscience lines in terms of the"
"origins of the amazing things that"
"neuroscientists study and vice versa and"
"we you know we certainly benefit from"
"from all of the uh from all the insights"
"of the field and the same thing with"
"with AI you know I think that uh there"
"are some just this idea of diverse"
"intelligence in unconventional"
"embodiments is a really powerful set of"
"Inspirations for"
"um creating creating novel robotics"
"novel AI systems that are not"
"specifically not neuromorphic that are"
"looking at more basic fundamental"
"principles and all of this kind of stuff"
"so so you know we we kind of appropriate"
"a lot of ideas I could show you data on"
"on perceptual by stability in"
"morphospace planaria that can't decide"
"if they want one head or two and so they"
"sort of shift back and forth and so on"
"um many many uh deep areas of uh"
"intersection here among these three"
"fields and so from all this this this"
"kind of these ideas about"
"these ideas about uh how individual"
"Pieces come to to be a single coherent"
"thing give us some suggestions for what"
"might you want from a from a real agent"
"you know this idea that when we make"
"these things everything has to be"
"determined on the Fly we can't"
"pre-define uh what you know a built-in"
"model of what they are where their"
"boundaries are they have to emerge"
"spontaneously through autopoiesis they"
"have to figure out where the world"
"starts where do they end what do they"
"have what effectors as you saw from from"
"all of these examples you know the the"
"tadpoles with the eyes on their tails"
"and everything they make biological"
"systems make very few assumptions really"
"about what happened before the whole the"
"the product of The evolutionary process"
"is a problem-solving machine that starts"
"from scratch kind of I call it play the"
"hand you're dealt you know they sort of"
"they do not make too many assumptions"
"about how the world is I can show you"
"many examples of uh beings that have too"
"many cells too few cells the wrong kinds"
"of cells and they will always try to"
"figure out something useful to do with"
"that so that process I think that"
"process of self-construction is really"
"going to be critical for for proper"
"intelligence so anybody who's interested"
"can kind of dive into some of the"
"details here so I just want to thank all"
"of the the students and the postdocs who"
"have done the work thank our funders do"
"a disclosure here fauna systems because"
"Josh Bond guard and I have a"
"a startup company around computer"
"designed biorobotics and um yeah and and"
"just just you know my my final message"
"is that I think that this multi-scale"
"competency architecture which is made up"
"of these agential materials that"
"basically Behavior shape each other uh"
"to accomplish uh specific uh outcomes in"
"in morphe space uh can really teach us a"
"lot about how collective intelligence"
"works and how we can engineer it so I'll"
"stop here and thank you all for"
listening
"yeah thank you Michael uh my head"
"exploded several times through there"
"thank you thank you so one question"
"one question the the warm and the head"
"you said that the memory is distributed"
"so it builds the same head with this"
"same functionality and same memory so if"
"the memory is in the body why does it do"
"that so what's the functionality of that"
"is it like the executive is the memory"
"is multiple places that gets replicated"
"yes yeah"
"well thank you so much thank you um yeah"
"so so the thing with planaria is that"
"the brain is actually required for"
"Behavior so when you cut off the head"
"the the remaining body parts really"
"don't do anything they just sit there uh"
"they they don't so so you wouldn't know"
"whether it had memory or it didn't have"
"memory because it doesn't do anything"
"and so in order to uh to to observe"
"evidence of of the of the memory you"
"have to let it regrow the head so that"
"it can actually start to behave"
"so I think that um the rest of the body"
"and we don't know exactly where the"
"memory is we don't know if it's in the"
"neurons we don't know if it's in every"
"you know it's in all the tissues we"
"really don't know uh but I think that"
"the memory outside of the brain is kind"
"of like um passive it it doesn't it it's"
"stored all right but it doesn't have the"
"ability to act or to be read out I think"
"I I personally think that and of course"
"this is extremely controversial but but"
"I'm not the only person uh thinking"
"about this way this idea that to what"
"extent are our specific memories"
"actually stored in the neurons versus"
"the neurons being a um a kind of"
"decoding Machinery from from other"
"cellular substrates and there's there's"
"some nice work on that so so I think I"
"think there's something to that and uh"
"but but you definitely need the brain to"
"be able to read out the memories and act"
"in the in the three-dimensional world"
"this was absolutely spectacular thank"
"you of localization in the sense that"
"comes out of your view but I want to"
"push that a lot so we will often be in"
"this situation where there's something"
"that could happen that is good for me"
"like if if I think about myself as being"
"small and what I'm gonna do is I I I"
"want some somewhere there which isn't my"
"direct neighbor to do something for me"
"and at some level what we want is"
"something that's almost like radiant"
"descent then or like what I tell my"
"neighbor hey can you move out of the way"
"and that's how they leave I hate can you"
"remember the way and so this chaining"
"that we have in gradiently sent in AI"
"should be the case for biology at all"
"levels if I like hear you loudly yep yep"
"so I"
"say the greatest decent should be"
"ubiquitous property in biology so so"
"this is this is really interesting and"
"uh um I I have a slide I didn't bring it"
"here just for lack of time but I have a"
"slide that shows almost exactly what you"
"just said so so think about think about"
"um the role of stress right so imagine"
"imagine I'm going to try to describe"
"this this this slide in in words here"
"imagine that you have a bunch of cells"
"and there's one cell at the bottom"
"that's not at the right location it"
"wants to get up here to the top now the"
"problem is that all of these other cells"
"are perfectly happy where they are"
"they're not getting out of the way for"
"this and so this cell is very stressed"
"because because it's not in the right"
"location what you can do is you can"
"export your stress you can start to leak"
"your stress to the neighbors the"
"neighbors also start to feel stressed"
"they don't know that it's not their"
"stress because all the stress molecules"
"are exactly identical and so the"
"temperature of the whole system Rises"
"they get so they start to get a little"
"plastic and everybody's kind of willing"
"to move around a little bit and then you"
"end up you know then then you can get to"
"where you can go and then the global you"
"reach some kind of global maximum"
"everybody's happy and it's a way to um"
"it's a way to to to have this kind of"
"cooperativity Without Really any"
"altruism because all the other cells"
"want to do is minimize their own stress"
"and and you're stressing them out and"
"the way for them to have lower stress is"
"to have you have lower stress and so"
"it's it's like this Collective again"
"it's I think it's one of these things"
"that helps the collectivism so if if you"
"want to call that gradient descent I'd"
"love to talk more because uh you know"
"I'm not an expert in gradient descent so"
"I'm not sure but if that's what it is"
"I'd love to know about it"
"that would be great that would be great"
yeah
"thank you"
"also for me to follow up on"
"um so I come from a multi-agion RL"
"background multi-agent systems and"
"something that"
"um I guess the goal of multi-agent"
"systems is to is to model the collection"
"of Agents working together"
"to solve tasks something like that so"
"like a larger collective intelligence"
"in multi-agent RL the way we do this is"
"Agents share rewards and so"
"and so if this could be sharing stress"
"this could be uh sharing food or or"
"whatever like uh so this model is the"
"group of Agents as a as a larger self"
"although like there's also"
"work like racing work in the last few"
"years they're like"
"if the group of the agents grows too big"
"uh then performance might degrade or"
"if these agents fully share their"
"rewards performance might degrade so is"
"there anything like this where"
"um between cells they might not fully"
"share their stress or fully share their"
"rewards but"
"there's kind of like a a degree there"
"where where maybe I don't want to"
"offload all of my reward but just part"
"part of my reward yeah to kind of help"
"cooperation yeah yeah yeah yeah that's"
"great and uh Sarah Marson who who's an"
"RL expert I'm I'm not um we're writing a"
"paper on on this on this topic there are"
"two I can think of two examples that are"
"similar to what to what you're saying"
"one is uh Chris Chris fields and I had"
"this this idea a while back for for one"
"of the re one of the um uh drivers of"
"multicellularity might be that if if you"
"you as a as a single cell want to be"
"able to do some kind of active inference"
"and predict your environment the most"
"predictable thing out there in a very"
"uncertain environment would be a copy of"
"yourself so the nice thing to do would"
"be to surround yourself with copies of"
"yourself so that you have some prayer of"
"you know having a stable environment and"
"knowing what's coming next at which"
"point what you might want to do is"
"addict your neighbors to hang out with"
"you so you might have these kind of Auto"
"crying and paracrine Loops where you're"
"secreting some sort of goodies maybe"
"opioid you know natural opioids maybe"
"maybe nutrients who knows but but you"
"you know you might you might try to"
"share some of this to keep the other"
"cells around and kind of um maintain"
"this the other the other aspect of of"
"what you just said is seen in gap"
"Junctions the the magical thing about"
"Gap Junctions which are these"
"connections that allow molecules to pass"
"directly from the inside of one cell to"
"the other is this under traditional uh"
"signaling modes one cell will secrete"
"some kind of chemical it sort of floats"
"over the other cell has receptors and it"
"feels it the thing with that is that the"
"other the receiving cell is very clear"
"that this is a signal that came from"
"outside and then you might ignore it you"
"might learn from it you know whatever"
"but it came from outside Gap Junctions"
"are different because if something"
"happens so cell A and B are connected"
"with gap Junction something happens to"
"cell a it triggers some sort of a memory"
"Trace let's say a calcium Spike or"
"something like that that immediately"
"propagates into cell b what these Gap"
"Junctions do do is they kind of erase"
"the ownership on that data there's no"
"metadata on the calcium about where it"
"came from calcium is calcium and so"
"whatever else comes across as a signal"
"of that information or a reward or"
"whatever it is is shared equally by the"
"two cells or or not equally because the"
"Gap Junctions can be regulated right so"
"they're tunable and so what happened"
"what that tends to do is um I think what"
"goes on here is that it erases the"
"individual identities because if if"
"you're if a and b cannot cleanly"
"maintain their individual memories if"
"they share memories it's kind of like"
"this this this mind meld because now"
"it's not that I have my own memories and"
"you have your own memories now they're"
"just we because it's the same pool of"
"molecules right and it also makes it"
"impossible to defect in a game theory"
"sense because because if you're"
"connected and I do something nasty to"
"you well guess what it comes back to me"
"immediately so so it forces this"
"cooperativity it forces a kind of um"
"sharing of of uh you know of of of of of"
"of our past that that binds us together"
"and I think in that sense"
[Music]
"to my knowledge nobody's actually"
"studied this in in detail but I bet"
"exactly what you're saying that that if"
"we were able to track the reward"
"molecules going through these things we"
"would find some dynamics that are"
"um kind of uh understandable under these"
"various Frameworks like RL and other"
"things that you guys study"
"cool thanks thanks"
"um thank you I have a question uh so I"
"would like to challenge you a bit on the"
"notion of ubiquitous intelligence so"
"from what I see I really like the idea"
"that it goes through transcriptomic"
"networks the cell to cell interaction"
"networks but it sounds to me like you"
"you ascribe every complex system that's"
"that's interconnected and that this"
"interaction between this individual"
"agent that if there's an Adaptive"
"behavior that is somehow intelligent"
"right like but my question basically is"
"like where is about let's assume a block"
"of metal is not internet because it is"
not
"in your framework I mean the weather"
"might be right because you have"
"interacting things and your interactions"
"and it's a compact system and and I I"
"just wonder so in your framework do you"
"think that from cell to cell interaction"
"Gene to Gene interaction to neuron to"
"neural interaction is it just a slow"
"continuous scale"
"uh basically it's just a time scale"
"that's different because we have like"
"these learning rules in the brain which"
"we'd like to understand do you think the"
"same things hold true for the cells it's"
"just it's a different time scale it"
"would eventually get there and I think"
"uh like let's say IBM organizers"
"Workshop to get to develop a brain model"
"that's I don't know is able to solve"
"some problems with intelligence right so"
"so uh in a sense like GPT can solve"
"problems or AI has"
"improved or become more intelligent"
"because it is able actually to solve"
"certain problems so my question is"
"in your framework then you would say if"
"you just wire up a bunch of neurons"
artificially
"they are doing something and create some"
"kind of dynamic and that's not"
"intelligent we're interested in right so"
"do you think there's a qualitative"
difference
"in how the brain is"
"surgeons and how cells are doing the"
"charges okay great yeah great great"
"question so so here's here's what I"
"would say first of all"
"um I I do not believe in intelligence as"
"a binary notion so I don't think we can"
"say yes it is no it isn't I think the"
"real question is how much and what kind"
"so I think there's a Continuum and we"
"can talk in a minute about whether"
"there's really there are these kind of"
"great transitions or it's really a"
"smooth Continuum and the other thing is"
"that I absolutely agree with you in that"
"intelligence cannot be be attributed"
"simply on the basis of complexity or"
"dynamicals you know some kind of"
"dynamical system the whole point of some"
"degree of intelligence and and this is"
"uh so I don't know if you can see the"
"slide I put up but but this is this is"
"what Weiner and at all we're trying for"
"is they were giving uh"
"functional criteria for assigning"
"certain kinds of intelligence which by"
"the way you can only assess in"
"experiment so if you bring me some kind"
"of extremely complex system you have to"
"and and we want to make intelligence"
"claims about it we have to on my"
"framework we have to do a couple of"
"things we have to first of all uh pick a"
"problem space okay then we have to pick"
"uh some kind of um uh uh some kind of"
"goal or problem-solving behavior that we"
"think it's doing and then we have to do"
"experiments to see how much uh what"
"kinds of uh uh competencies if some of"
"them are on this chart here it can"
"muster to and and then and then we have"
"an empirical answer to you know if if"
"two people have a model one person says"
"Nah I think it's just um you know it's"
"just a hardwired thing that does the"
"same thing somebody else is well I think"
"it's a bradenberg vehicle of type two"
"somebody else is no I think it has"
"metacognition and it knows what it knows"
"these are all empirical uh questions we"
"have to do the experiment now you a very"
"simple example if you look at a gene"
"regulatory Network right so these are"
"just it's a it's a mathematical model"
"that literally just says it has you know"
"maybe let's say a dozen genes and each"
"one turns another one on and off so it's"
"a set of coupled ordinary differential"
"equations for example so you look at"
"this thing you say okay this this the"
"traditional view was that look this is"
"clearly it's a it's a complex dynamical"
"system but there's no magic here it's we"
"can see where all the part you know what"
"what it's doing it's this there's no way"
"this thing's intelligent and what we"
"said what we said was let's do the"
"experiment and what we found out was"
"that it can actually it can actually do"
"six different kinds of learning"
"including associative conditioning so is"
"it is it highly intelligent no can it do"
"associative learning and is associative"
"learning a kind of intelligence"
"somewhere on the spectrum of the kinds"
"of things we mean I I would say so but"
"we didn't know that until we did the"
"experiment we tried to train it and we"
"observed what it can do so when you"
"brought up the weather I think that's"
"actually really interesting and I've"
"made this this that claim about the"
"weather at the moment we have no idea"
"why because nobody's tried training the"
"weather it is I do not think we know"
"right whether or not if you tried uh"
"certain kinds of Behavioral kinds of"
"paradigms things that come from"
"Behavioral Science we we would then find"
"out no actually the weather doesn't have"
"any kind of learning capacity so it's"
"it's zero or extremely low or we would"
"find out oh whoa it actually uh much"
"like this genetic Network that people"
"these these biological transcriptional"
"networks that people thought we hadn't"
"had none of this Edge in fact have some"
"so I I you know I kind of I just insist"
"on two things one is that uh we that"
"this is a matter for experiment not for"
"armchair kind of um you know I don't"
"think we can have feelings about systems"
"as to whether they should be intelligent"
"or not we have to do experiments which"
"means you make a claim about what type"
"of like like this is one I have a"
"different actually um a different scale"
"that I came up with but this is this is"
"wieners is fine too you you pick where"
"you think it is on this and then you see"
"whether your model gives you better"
"prediction and control versus somebody"
"else who picks a different spot on the"
"Spectrum so you know as long as we stick"
"to to empirical experiments then we can"
"find out what kind of intelligence"
"anything has"
"thanks thank you"
