"hello and welcome to ieee's soft"
"robotics podcaster"
"in this broadcast we're going to"
"interview researchers from"
"pulse academia and industry about the"
work
"thoughts spectrum and more beyond that"
"this is marvel eduni"
"and i hope you will find this podcast"
useful
"if you would like to connect with us"
"simply send us and we will be happy to"
"hear from you"
"and here is my interview thanks"
"hello and welcome to i try to believe"
"the robotics podcast hello person"
"mike and josh for the podcasts that"
"you're have both of you"
"so i would like to ask you first uh how"
"we'd like to define yourself"
"briefly for the audience maybe first"
"time listening to both of you"
"sure mike did you want to go first um"
"sure well good morning uh"
"happy to be here um so i'm mike levin"
"i'm a professor"
"at tufts university i run the allen"
"discovery center"
"and my group works at the intersection"
"of biology computer science and"
"cognitive science"
"good morning marwah i'm josh baumgardt"
"i'm a professor of computer science here"
"at the university of vermont and my area"
"of research is evolutionary robotics"
"and the connection with mike is we"
"evolve uh virtual creatures in"
simulation
"and mike's group tries to build uh what"
"we come up with out of cells"
"wonderful so first of all"
"congratulations for all the success you"
"have been doing so far"
"thank you so the first question i would"
"like to ask you about you"
"i think we have already serious about"
"what is actually"
"involved intelligence and we ask all the"
"time in soft robotics"
"should we invest more in the brain or"
"the body side"
"and i'm curious to ask you first a"
"question about embodied intelligence or"
"embodied cognition"
"from biology perspective and also from"
"robotics or computer science"
"so if we can go first from biology"
"perspective what is embodied"
"intelligence or recognition is it in the"
"brain or the body and maybe something"
beyond
"that yeah just maybe the first question"
though
"yeah well i guess the first part of that"
"is to uh ask what what we think"
"intelligence is in the first place right"
"so just the intelligence part of that"
"so obviously lots of people have uh"
"thought about this in the past and so"
"um what i'll do is just offer our"
"working definition and how we think"
"about things"
"so to me intelligence is the ability to"
"solve problems in some sort of space"
"now this might be three-dimensional"
"behavioral space as in you know typical"
"when you think of animals running around"
"and solving problems"
"but biology solves problems in all sorts"
"of other spaces these virtual spaces so"
there's
"metabolic space and transcriptional"
"space and even amorphous space which is"
"the space of all possible body"
configurations
"and there are many other spaces so in"
"all of these spaces a biological system"
"needs to navigate that space and get to"
"a region that"
"that that it's trying to get to a goal"
"state of some sort that is"
"adaptive and whatever so uh"
"so the question becomes how do living"
"things at multiple scales navigate these"
"various spaces simultaneously"
"and the for us the question of whether"
"it's in the body or in the brain"
"becomes a slightly different question"
"because there is no"
"uh i mean anatomically of course the"
"brain is a separate organ but but but"
"um fundamentally uh all"
"cells and tissues can do some of the"
"things that brains do"
"and so if it for us it's a it's a"
continuum
"so so it's not that there's a brain and"
"body on this side and you know a brain"
"on the side and the body on that side"
"but it's actually this this continuum of"
"of different architectures"
"both on inside of cells and cell groups"
"and in fact whole tissues and organs"
"that solve these various problems and so"
"the question is always"
"what is the optimal level at which to"
"catch a particular system solving these"
"problems and to be able to interact with"
it
"so i'd like to if they have something to"
"agree or disagree about that because i"
"think in soft robotics we sometimes"
"manifest intelligence through the bodies"
"itself so if i ask you for the job do"
"you think that when it comes to robotics"
"to blowing this concept do you think we"
"have to give more attention to both of"
"them or maybe sometimes"
"how we can use the intrinsic feature of"
"the material is that for example the"
"fish is swimming upstream"
"how the fish can have that fish can have"
"this all for free"
"yeah uh those being did i don't know"
"what what what something talk"
"sure right you mentioned materials and"
"soft robotics and and i"
"you know if we're talking about robots"
"presumably we're making these machines"
"to be useful in some ways"
"and they need to solve problems on their"
"own so this comes back to what mike was"
"saying is that organisms"
"and robots alike have to be solving a"
problem
"the the interesting issue is often you"
"know what is the problem that they're"
"trying to solve"
"um one aspect of that problem or that"
"challenge is to stay alive and"
"and propagate into the future there's an"
"interesting definition of"
"intelligence in the ai literature which"
"is to keep your options open in the"
future
"so if you think about that that way of"
"thinking about"
"intelligence you know it implies action"
"you need to act"
"in the world to perform useful work if"
"you're a robot or"
"metabolize or homeostat if you're"
"if you're an organism so if you think"
"about it at a deep level there is some"
"connection between"
"action and intelligence and action the"
"actions you can"
"or can't perform or the actions that are"
"easy or difficult"
"those are all a function of your body so"
"em embodied intelligence to me is almost"
"a tautology"
"it's it's hard to think about"
"intelligence in a non-embodied way"
"but the field of ai has had a good crack"
"at that um"
"you know there's the philosophical side"
"to embodied intelligence as well"
"my phd advisor role pfeiffer and i wrote"
"a book on this a few years back called"
"how the body shapes the way we think"
"philosophers have been wrestling with"
"this for hundreds and arguably thousands"
"of years"
"and you know it's often easy to think"
"about body and brain"
"separately and if you look at the fields"
"of robotics and ai"
"since the second world war they have"
"also developed somewhat independently"
"into robotics which focuses on the"
"physical aspects of adaptive behavior"
"and ai which is increasingly you know"
"non-embodied problem solving and pattern"
recognition
"how do we bring these two branches of"
"you know making smart machines back"
"together again i think that's one of the"
"big open challenges for the 21st century"
"great so i guess this cube was a few"
"about discussion with for example"
designing
"about open-ended environment and that's"
"something i think in biology how this"
these
"creatures already figure out to do that"
"to be adaptable to"
"uncertain situation so when it comes to"
"the discussion between both of you i'm"
"curious how"
"for you as a computer science and"
"computer science how how we can design"
"system living system that can work at"
"open ended environment"
"scenario like that what are the"
"challenge what are the questions do"
"both of you share and consider maybe"
"yeah i think that that's a great"
"question how to reconcile the"
"open-ended um"
"so just for you for your listeners maybe"
"it's helpful to set up the"
"the xenobots project where we use an"
"evolutionary algorithm and run it in a"
"supercomputer to design"
"artificial biobots in a simulated"
environment
"and then mike's group tries to"
"instantiate it in"
"biological tissues so the immediate"
"question we have to ask on the"
"simulation side is what"
"do we put in to the physics engine what"
"aspects of"
"biology and physics are is living"
systems
"exploiting how do they exploit it and"
"how might biobots exploit it to do what"
"we want it to do"
"so turn over the floor to mike and uh"
"yeah things about that"
"yeah i mean one of the important aspects"
"for us"
"is to understand the natural plasticity"
"of the system itself"
"so the one of the amazing things about"
"the xenobots is that we take cells with"
"a completely normal wild-type genome"
"meaning no genomic editing we don't"
"change the cells in any way"
"and we're finding that they as a"
"collective are capable of doing"
"uh some really novel things that they"
"otherwise normally don't do"
"and so for me part of this this whole"
"this whole adventure is to figure out"
"ways to computationally explore and"
predict
"the the space of possible outcomes that"
"we're normally"
"not used to so in in biology and in"
"particular in developmental biology"
"we are uh often um"
"this plasticity is masked by the"
"reliability of development right the"
"fact that"
"a frog a frog egg if you don't do"
"anything else to it very reliably makes"
"a tadpole"
"and so we you sort of so certainly"
"students or to get this feeling that"
"okay this is this is this is what this"
"machine is able to do"
"but what we're seeing now and of course"
"people have seen the aspects of this"
"before with"
"in terms of epigenetics and other other"
"types of experiments"
"that actually no these these cells have"
"uh very"
"much um greater capacities for doing"
"things both"
"collectively and singularly singly than"
"what they normally do and so how do we"
"how do we learn to predict that how do"
"we learn to to anticipate the kinds of"
"plasticity that these cells will have"
"and so so here i think is is the grand"
"challenge is to use the computational"
"tools to do that"
"and i think you know one of the one of"
"the interesting"
"one of the interesting things about"
"mike's work that we find so fascinating"
"on the computational side is viewing the"
organism
"at the cellular level that in a way the"
"organism is made up of intelligent"
"machines at the tissue level the"
"cellular level the subcellular level"
"so in many ways for different parts of"
"the xenobot for different parts of the"
"organism the open-ended environment"
"is the the cellular environment itself"
"is the neighboring cells and the signals"
"that are coming in and being sent"
"out so when we when the evolutionary"
algorithm
"attempts to rearrange simulated"
"biological tissue"
"then one hunk of biological tissue now"
"has a new environment it's up against a"
"new piece of tissue that may be in the"
"adult frog the wild type frog"
"it hasn't been in contact before what do"
"we know about that novel rearrangement"
"how do we simulate it do we put"
"noise into the simulator how do we"
"ensure that that novel rearrangement"
"will succeed if we try and build it in"
"reality um that's that's really kind of"
"an open"
"open-ended question for us at the moment"
"that's very interesting uh we handle the"
"podcast also alex from google he"
"speak about growing neurosurgeon and i"
"mentioned both of you with that"
"inspiration for that"
"but maybe the quick question here do you"
"think when it comes to robotics what"
"does it take to"
"deploy this intelligent individual cells"
"in the design do you think it's it's"
"challenging what kind of question we"
"have we have to ask ourselves"
"in that case to deploy this concept in"
"soft robotics"
"yeah in soft robotics um yeah absolutely"
"i mean i guess if we're viewing the"
"xenobot as"
"a soft robot it's clearly a very"
"different soft robot from what we"
"normally deal with"
"and in our first xenobot paper mike mike"
"and i and our other two"
"uh co-authors talked about this quite a"
"bit you know sort of the pros and cons"
"of working with biological materials"
"versus artificial materials so steel"
"is extremely strong electronics are"
"extremely fast at"
"relaying information but artificial"
"materials are also quite brittle"
"in that if you look at any one component"
"it's a dumb component"
"the intelligence is not at the the level"
"of uh you know"
"the the joint or the motor the sensor"
"um it's a if if you're lucky it's at the"
"level of the entire robot but that is"
"not true in biological systems there is"
"intelligence at every spatial"
"scale and so that that raises obviously"
"exciting opportunities because when"
"we're working with biological tissues to"
"build soft robots those tissues"
themselves
"are bots they are intelligent they have"
"their own goals they're trying to do"
"things we're trying to wrench them into"
"new forms and functions"
"if we do it in the right way we get a"
"lot of the inherent plasticity and"
"adaptivity of"
"life for free we demonstrated in the"
"last two xenobot papers"
"that you can cut a xenobot almost in"
"half and it will automatically"
"stitch itself back up again that's not"
"something that the evolutionary"
"algorithm discovered it's something that"
"came for free"
"because we were working with biological"
tissues
"great so i'm curious to ask you uh"
"about the intelligence of learning when"
"you combine for example artificial"
"cell or materials with living cells for"
"example how they can"
"continually learning and have this kind"
"of generic and continual learning"
"so maybe from biology perspective first"
"how these cells can have this kind of"
"control learning and if we go to"
"computer science and"
"having this hybrid design how both of"
"them can adapt"
"to continually learning and be adaptable"
"yeah so on the biology side you know the"
"question of learning uh is"
"is fairly contentious because uh some"
"people uh take"
"take learning to be a very narrow sort"
"of thing that advanced animals with"
"brains do"
"and then there's the field of basal"
"cognition which sort of stretches it out"
"into into a more"
"i would say evolutionarily uh um"
"a realistic view where learning shows up"
"very early on"
"in in the in the web of life and so um"
"the the thing about the the interesting"
"thing about learning is that"
"you have to have a subject that learns"
"something right"
"and uh you have to when when you have"
memories
"and uh and learning it has to belong to"
"some agent that you have to be able to"
describe
"and this is very non-obvious because all"
"all cognitive agents are made of parts"
"so when you have something that learned"
"you have a bunch of it so so if i you"
"know if a rat has learned"
"has learned something um what you really"
"have is a collection of cells"
"and and so let's say let's say the rat"
"has learned that when it presses on a"
"particular level a lever"
"with its foot it gets some you know some"
"apple juice or something as a reward"
"this the cells that interact with the"
"lever are not at all the cells that get"
"the reward"
"and so the trick then is and so when you"
"say the rat has learned something well"
"what's the wrath the rat is some"
collective
"of all of these cells that have figured"
"out how to do credit assignment properly"
"and this of course is very familiar to"
to
"to machine learning and robotics folks"
"is that uh we"
"the trick here is to is to understand"
"how all of the individual cells"
"have bound together into us into a"
"larger agent that is the subject of"
"rewards and punishments and things like"
this
"very non-obvious this this also works in"
"in individual cells so single cells can"
learn
"and and plants can learn and things"
"without brain so it's not just a story"
"about brains and neurons"
"it's a story about how competent"
subunits
"can work together in a way that gives"
"rise to a larger scale self"
"that it can be the owner of memories the"
"the the the center of preferences the"
"subject of past experiences and so on"
"that are not um individually true of any"
"of the"
"components so that that is one of the"
"grand mysteries in biology and so we're"
just
"you know just starting to really"
"understand how that works in the global"
"um in the global sense yeah"
"i just want to do sure if you can read"
"more about how we can do that in"
"artificial intelligence for example"
"we're machine learning how we can have"
"scheduled learning yeah"
"yeah i think you know there's a lot of"
"brand new questions i think for the ai"
"community now that"
"sort of bio hybrid technologies are"
"becoming possible"
"so um you know intelligent prosthetics"
"bio hybrids if you put artificial"
"you put technology together with living"
systems
"the living system usually learns right"
"it will learn to send the right signals"
"to the prosthetic and"
"and receive the signals appropriately"
"again because living systems are so good"
"at learning and"
"as mike said have solved the credit"
"assignment problem they're they're more"
"or less willing to work alongside"
"technology and share the credit for"
"collective action"
"but it's the the prosthetic itself the"
"artificial side that still"
"grapples with learning how to interpret"
"the signals that are being"
"sent from the living side of the of the"
"bio hybrid"
"so i think you know there's some brand"
"new kind of machine learning problems"
you
"can ask at that that level the there's"
"another way to connect technology with"
"living systems which is what mike and i"
"have been doing recently where"
"the learning is the evolutionary"
"algorithm that's learning how to"
rearrange
"biological tissues into new forms and"
functions
"and that's you know sort of that's quite"
"different from biohybrids where you're"
marrying
"hardware and robotics with you know with"
"part of an organism"
"so what are the questions there if you"
"want an evolutionary algorithm"
"to learn what rearrangements work"
"and what rearrangements don't work that"
"again is sort of a brand new way of"
formulating
"you know a question in ai and uh yeah a"
"lot lots to do"
"yeah but of course the skew uh maybe"
"again that's question about"
"i think in this field about how we can"
"design robots regenerate either after"
"damage or"
"healing because i think yeah it's still"
it's
"very fascinating what mike was"
"presenting i think in europe 2018 about"
"regeneration and and i think that's"
"something also"
"uh alex uh highlighted in the podcast"
"earlier but"
"if you can tell us more in detail about"
"how do you see"
"fitnesses for example for each creature"
"so that they can regrow"
"or regenerate the lamp yeah for the"
"audience maybe just curious to know"
"about that more in detail"
"yeah so there are a number of uh"
organisms
"that are able to repair themselves after"
damage
"and so so axolotls the the mexican"
"salamander is one"
"example where they will re-reach their"
legs
"their their eyes their jaws portions of"
"the brain the heart"
"their spinal cord um there are other"
"models like the planarian flatworms that"
"we work with where"
"pretty much every piece of the planarian"
"can regrow the entire thing"
"so this this ability to um and to"
"regenerate is"
"a uh is a is a special case of a broader"
"capacity which is something we call"
"anatomical homeostasis"
"so this is not just for adult"
"regeneration embryonic development does"
"the same thing"
"and so does remodeling for example in"
"metamorphosis from a tadpole to a frog"
"the the idea is is pretty simple you"
"have this homeostatic loop"
"that uh continuously deforms and"
remodels
"the tissue so the cells are moving"
"around they're migrating they're"
"differentiating they're doing various"
things
"until the the shape becomes roughly uh"
"equal to a target morphology the thing"
"that it's trying to the shape that it's"
"trying to achieve"
"and so it's basically an error"
"minimization scheme that it's able to in"
some
"uh a coarse grained way sense deviations"
"from the correct pattern and those"
"deviations could be injury they could be"
"teratogens they could be"
"mutations it could be all sorts of"
"things and so and"
"until that that uh that error is reduced"
"below an acceptable threshold"
"things will keep changing so for for us"
"the real"
"trick is uh to understand not only how"
"regeneration happens and"
"lots of people study the the cellular"
"mechanisms of turning this cell type"
"into that cell type and so on"
"but actually the algorithms of how it"
"fulfills the three steps of that"
"homeostatic cycle"
"because it needs to do three things it"
"needs to uh measure the current shape"
"so that it can tell whether it's correct"
"or not so it has to so the collective"
"and this is something very large so no"
"individual cell can measure something so"
"big it has to be a collective"
"uh computation so so the collective has"
"to be able to measure"
"the current shape then it has to be able"
to
"uh remember what the correct shape is so"
"there's a kind of pattern memory here"
"that where you can tell is it right or"
"is it wrong and we've made some"
"uh some some progress in seeing how it"
"stores those memories"
"and then it has to uh issue the the"
"collective has to issue commands to the"
"lower level subunits meaning the cells"
"to rearrange in a way that that gets"
"them closer to this final"
"so so to us this is this is very much"
"this kind of problem-solving cycle"
"really critical to find out how does it"
"know when to stop"
"you know very few people actually work"
"on regeneration and asking how does it"
"know when to suck"
"so when the salamander makes a correct"
"arm and then everything stops"
"how does it know that's what a correct"
"salamander arm looks like i mean that's"
"a critical question"
"and so so all of the three sort of all"
"of the aspects of that standard sort of"
"test operate exit loop has to be"
"identified in biology and we've just"
"really just begun to do that"
[Music]
"what mentioned do you think in robotics"
"we have to go for this question in"
"yeah just answer them necessarily to go"
"to this level"
"i don't know about this level but"
"absolutely a lot of what mike just said"
"has to be incorporated into robotics"
where
"we're moving in robotics into soft"
"robotic spaces into biohybrid robots"
"you know there's been this assumption"
"throughout the history of robotics that"
"the body of the machine"
"is fixed and that that assumption"
"you know has to be rolled back you you"
cannot
"in my opinion you cannot make an"
"adaptive machine"
"that has a a completely fixed body plan"
"it just it just doesn't work"
"you're just too limited um but again"
"if we're building you know depending on"
"what soft robots we're building out of"
"what materials we can't just borrow"
"directly from biology right we couldn't"
"make a huge flapping bird and get it off"
"the ground we had to borrow the"
principles
"of heavier than air flight and adapt it"
"to the materials"
"from which it's built so i think as"
"usual in bio-inspired ai and artificial"
life
"you know we're looking carefully at what"
"mike's group is is discovering and"
"figuring out how to distill"
"out of that the basic principles of"
homeostasis
"adaptation intelligent action and then"
"build that into"
"whatever materials we're building our"
"soft robots out and"
"and how to do that well or in a"
"principled manner is again"
"you know a completely open question i"
"mean the funny thing is"
"it's interesting that you say that uh"
"about you know giving up that assumption"
"of a constant body uh biological"
evolution
"gave this up long ago because because"
"the interesting thing about"
"many probably not all but but most"
creatures
"is that uh they are incredibly tolerant"
"to large-scale changes of architecture"
"so for example"
"um you can make well we've made tadpoles"
"where the eyes are on the tail"
"and those instead of in the head and"
"those animals can see perfectly well"
"they they learn in visual assays no"
"problem so"
"so the brain can can immediately um well"
"first of all at the cellular scale if"
"you are a"
"if you're a bunch of cells that are"
"trying to make an eye the fact that"
"you're sitting next to a spinal cord and"
"muscle as opposed to"
"the brain and various other things no"
"problem you'll still make an eye and"
"you'll still make an optic nerve that"
"connects to something the spinal cord"
"nearby perhaps"
"and and so so that that plasticity is"
"there and then the plasticity of"
behavior
"so the brain has no trouble interpreting"
"this this this weird"
"you know sort of electrical signals from"
"from a new patch of itchy tissue on your"
tail
"as visual data and behaving"
"appropriately yeah it handles that right"
off
"and so what that what that is probably"
"signifying is that evolution discovered"
"really early on"
"that in order to be adaptively"
"successful and"
"um and evolvable you have to have"
"uh that kind of plasticity that that you"
"have to assume that your body can change"
"and that things don't necessarily go"
"where you can't"
"assume that everything is where it needs"
"to be and that you can still"
"um all the different parts compete and"
"cooperate within the body"
"to uh to result in some sort of adaptive"
"function so that plasticity i think"
"biology sort of assumes right off the"
"bat that"
"you don't know where anything is and and"
"that you still have to"
"you know you still have to get your"
"business done even if even if things are"
"surprising and not where you thought"
"they were"
"that's very interesting i'm just asking"
"they think when we maybe in designing or"
"maybe pushing the limit what we have"
already
"uh from evolution do you think the"
"designing of the morphology"
"we can advance more beyond what we have"
already
"and i don't know for robotics for"
"example and biology do you think that's"
something
"you think about how we can design"
"something beyond what we already have"
"when it comes to yeah just morphology of"
"the body itself"
"or the structure i mean i i my answer"
"would be"
"absolutely yes i mean humans invented"
"the wheel"
"um you know there's certain things that"
"humans have invented that as far as i"
"know might correct me if i'm wrong they"
"have no real analog in biology"
"maybe at the micro scale but not you"
"know not at the macro scale"
"so i think you know maybe it seems"
"obvious but you know when we start to"
"marry biological and robotic"
technologies
"we have to figure out how to do this so"
"that we bring together the best of both"
"worlds and we might be able to achieve"
"you know machines that that have"
"capabilities beyond purely biological or"
purely
"artificial yeah and even in biology"
"it's uh it's it's not really obvious"
"what the um what the possibilities are"
"what the limitations are"
"you know people talk about developmental"
"constraints and so on but but no one"
"really knows what those constraints are"
"and whether or not if we really knew"
"what we were doing we could convince"
"cellular collectives to build"
"almost anything right and so what what"
"are the spaces"
"what's the morph what's what's the"
"option space for morphologies for any"
"particular genotype"
"we have no idea and and this is"
"something that uh i think the robotics"
"is really going to help us understand"
"yeah so i'm curious about the designing"
"between what we have already for"
"example xenobot the designing from ai"
"to to biology so you mentioned a"
"bespoke robotic uh josh i think that"
"that's something you mentioned in your"
talk
"if you can to learn more about what do"
"you mean mean about that when it comes"
"to designing from"
"simulation to real living robot the best"
"book property"
"yeah bespoke robotics this was something"
"we kind of snuck into one of"
"our papers it's a little tongue-in-cheek"
"the the idea here"
"is you know if we're using evolutionary"
"algorithm to rearrange biological"
"tissues in simulation"
"and then realize that in reality an"
"evolutionary algorithm unlike"
"you know back propagation of air or"
"other gradient based methods it doesn't"
"converge on just one"
"optimal solution it gives you back a"
"population of diverse"
"solutions and if we're applying an"
"evolutionary algorithm to xenobots or"
"biobots or biological tissue in general"
"it's giving you back a series of"
"biological machines"
"that do whatever it is you ask them to"
"do but each machine has a different"
"shape or a different form"
"and it and it instantiates the solution"
"to that problem or that task"
"in a different way so it has a unique"
function
"so in theory if we could if we could"
"manufacture xenobots or biobots at the"
"same rate that the evolutionary"
"algorithm can spit out"
"unique forms and functions you could"
"realize what we you know sort of were"
"kind of"
"jokingly calling bespoke robotics you"
"would manufacture"
"a whole bunch of machines no two of"
"which are alike"
"and in the long term i think actually"
"this is a very important problem"
"um because if you if you are dealing"
with
"a monoculture a monoculture regardless"
"of whether it's biological"
"or technological it's vulnerable"
"um you know we're you're increasingly"
"concerned about you know cyber security"
"you know cyber attacks"
"you know if you think about all the"
"machines all the computers they're all"
"running exactly the same operating"
"system the same version all of our"
"all of our industrial robotics"
"everything is built from the same"
blueprint
"but biology doesn't work like that for a"
"very good reason if you're all"
"relying on the same way of solving the"
"problem you are extremely vulnerable"
"so i think even just from a purely"
"technological point of view it's"
"interesting to think about you know what"
"how do biobots make you think"
"differently about for example cyber"
"security which is not my area of"
"expertise but"
"what are the things that become possible"
"when you think about automatically"
designing
"uh form and function for biological"
"machines this"
"you know this question of of of bespoke"
architectures
"uh in biology is is very important too"
because
"we this issue of control of the anatomy"
is
"is the key to all regenerative medicine"
"right so birth defects"
"cancer traumatic injury um aging"
"all of this boils down to the same"
"question how do we convince cells to"
"build whatever we want them to build it"
"might be an eye it might be a better"
"hand it might be a normal hand"
"whatever it's going to be how do we"
"control them and"
"uh how much plasticity is there so how"
"much capacity do we have and how do we"
"how do we do this how do we specify so"
"you can sort of imagine so so in my head"
"i have this"
"this idea that of a kind of anatomical"
"compiler right that at some point"
"what you should be able to do is specify"
"the end point of what you want you"
"should be able to draw a creature"
"sort of like like cad you know right you"
"should be able to draw this this"
creature
"and if we knew what we were doing the"
"system would would"
"would decompose that into a set of"
"stimuli to be given to cells that in the"
"end would give you that that creature"
"so uh it's really the same problem what"
"we're looking for is the ability to make"
"targeted machines targeted living"
"machines to a particular functional and"
"structural specification"
"right but i'm still curious about the"
"transition from what you what might say"
"to already in robotics for example the"
"growing or"
"how they have the memory to remember"
"that if there's scenario you have like"
"that like the two-headed for example"
"uh example you mentioned how we can do"
"that robotic what kind of question we"
"have to push for"
"or what kind of direction we can find"
"that answer for"
"designing this robot that can regrow and"
"if there is damage happening"
"autonomously do you think we can reach"
that
"absolutely and i think again my work"
"that mike's involved in the work on"
"neural cellular automata you know"
"automata have been around since the"
"beginning of computer science"
"it's a you know very compelling concept"
"but it hasn't really been combined with"
"robotics very much"
"there's been a few examples here and"
"there but but this idea"
"of you know looking to your neighbors"
"you know drawing in information you know"
extremely
"distributed uh coordination and action"
"that hasn't really penetrated robotics"
"yet i think that's"
"that's the key especially as we move"
"into soft robotics and regeneration and"
recovering
"from damage i think that'll be extremely"
"useful um"
"another aspect for regeneration in in"
"soft robotics that's important is again"
"this idea of embodied intelligence"
"that we just we relax this assumption"
"that it is a fixed body um"
"mike and i and and rebecca kramer"
"botiglio who runs"
"a robotics lab at yale we had a paper at"
"robotics science and systems"
"uh back in 2019 we had some simulated"
"and physical soft robots and we were"
"cutting off legs and"
"and the evolutionary algorithm was"
"searching for solutions once they'd been"
"injured and"
"we assumed that we would get"
"regeneration that the four-legged robot"
"once it was now a three-legged robot"
"that would re-grow the fourth leg"
"but actually that was the minority"
solution
"often the evolutionary algorithm would"
"push the morphology into a completely"
different
"form where it would recover the ability"
"to start moving again it would actually"
retract
"the three intact legs and move by"
"peristaltic crawling"
"so you know again in soft robotics maybe"
"maybe we could go beyond the concept of"
"a static"
"as a static or target morphology there"
"may be different target morphologies"
"depending on"
"what's going on and that's a very"
"different way of thinking i think in in"
robotics
"it shows again how what we're learning"
"about biology is inspiring us to think"
"differently about"
"about adaptive action in machines"
"so i'm curious about what could be and"
"after your cooperation i don't know if"
"there's something"
"you thought about maybe many times then"
"you didn't expect something um"
"yeah to come up in certain results you"
"have maybe in"
"kind of thoughts or modeling i don't"
"know but when you try to deploy it was"
"surprising i was still you don't"
"understand how it's happening do you"
"have any kind of question like"
"how it happened or why it happened like"
"that or counter-intuitive to what you"
"already thought about"
"maybe from biology and from the the"
"important simulation for example yeah"
"yeah boy uh so you know uh every day"
"right so so i would say i would say"
"95 of the things we see on a daily basis"
are
"uh surprising and probably in some way"
"counter-intuitive which is telling us"
"that our"
"intuitions aren't very good um on a lot"
"of these questions"
"uh i'm i'm most struck"
"by this this is the cellular plasticity"
"and the ability to"
"uh of these cells to cooperate in to"
"to to create these larger scale"
"collectives that have the ability to do"
these
"amazingly flexible things and to behave"
"in new ways"
"and i think the future of a lot of"
"important uh applications in this field"
"are in actually in many fields"
"ride on our ability to start to learn to"
"understand this kind of collective"
"intelligence to to understand the goals"
"of these uh collectives and where their"
"goals come from"
"and what what is it that it you know"
"when you put these these um"
"active agents together in a group and"
"they they compete and they cooperate and"
"they do all these dynamics"
"what is the end result of this going to"
"do you know it's completely not obvious"
"and uh and this this new sort of science"
of
"of um synthetic uh morphology and and"
"this this marriage of"
"modeling and robotics and uh and"
"chimeric various kind of chemical"
"organisms that are"
"part biological and and new ways to"
"organize them and apart technological"
"is really the beginnings of this is to"
"understand goal directedness"
"and that scale up of of of cognition"
"from parts to holes"
"that's that though that we see examples"
"of this every day that just blow our"
"minds that's that's"
"what i'm most surprised about yeah"
"95 is a low low estimate"
"from a robotics and ai point of view"
"this entire xenobots project has been"
"completely surprising from"
"beginning to end um just"
"on the on the robotic side one of the"
"things that's been really interesting"
"is the sim to real aspect of this work"
"is that again we're trying to we're"
"trying to simulate"
"you know frog skin cells frog heart"
"muscle cells we take what"
"what biology knows about those cell"
"types and build it into the simulation"
"but we know there's thousands or"
"millions of details that are not known"
"or that we have yet to build into the"
simulation
"so we're giving you know we're giving"
"the evolutionary algorithm we're giving"
"the ai"
"very little information about these lego"
"bricks the building blocks that it has"
"to use"
"to come up with something that has"
"useful form and function"
"and specifically in the xenobots project"
what
"was so surprising to me is that a lot of"
"the designs were"
"transferable from simulation to reality"
"this is a topic that's you know very"
"popular at the moment in robotics"
"there's a lot of effort going into"
making
"you know incredibly high resolution"
gpu-based
"you know simulations you know down to"
"the micrometer of the of the robot and"
"hoping that we can transfer from"
"simulation to reality"
"but i think again if we're doing"
"cinderella with biology"
"often you know biology is a great error"
"corrector right it will it'll sort of"
"paper over"
"things that we didn't get quite right"
"and will adapt"
"so i think the biology has been helping"
"us a lot on some of the technological"
"challenges like sim to real and in"
"retrospect that is not something that"
"that i had thought of when we started"
"out on this and it suggests to me again"
"there may be"
"other you know really recalcitrant"
"problems in ai and robotics like"
"catastrophic forgetting"
"um learning to learn you know all the"
"you know the state-of-the-art problems"
"that ai is currently"
"grappling with how can biology help us"
"with those they may"
"be extremely difficult because we're"
"dealing with purely artificial machines"
"non-embodied machines we're focusing on"
"synaptic plasticity and maybe not paying"
"enough attention"
"to other adaptive mechanisms from"
biology
"so that again has been surprising to me"
"is how surprisingly easy"
"certain quote unquote hard problems in"
"a.i become"
"when we think about biology or we're"
"inspired by biology in the right way"
"and do you think for learning um i don't"
"know if learning to learn do you think"
this
"other possibility do you think we have"
"to push beyond what we have already um"
"machine learning or artificial"
"intelligence do you think any kind of"
"crazy ideas i don't know or something we"
"need to push more in that direction"
"i don't know if we have any sort like"
"that yeah absolutely we do"
"we mike and i haven't really done that"
"yet but again"
"bio-inspired ai is a large field i think"
"there's lots of opportunity there"
"if you have a machine that's made up of"
"machines which are made up of machines"
"then by definition you're always going"
"to have learning to learn because your"
"neighbors and what's going on"
"you know at spatial organizations above"
"you and below you and within you"
"everything is in flux you can't if"
you're
"you know you're a cell or a tissue"
"embedded within an organism you can't"
"just sit there and not learn"
"and do the same thing over and over"
"again because as mike was mentioning"
"there's this"
"constant homeostatic process going on"
"so you have to learn how to learn the"
"learning rates or the adaptive rates of"
things
"above you and below you those the time"
"scales of learning or adaptation are"
different
"everything is changing and that's"
"we've only just started to scratch the"
"surface of in"
"in ai right yeah"
"i mean i think i think you know one of"
"the questions that we"
"think about all the time is what aspects"
"of what we see in biology"
"is really the important thing to carry"
"over into the"
"into the robotics and the machine"
"learning so"
"so it isn't going to be any of the"
"details right which gene does what that"
"that's not going to be the that's not"
"going to be the key thing the key thing"
"is going to be these large-scale"
"dynamics that are sort of"
"almost the software of the system in a"
"certain sense and so"
"one one example of this is what we see"
"in these architectures that i think"
"by in biology that is really powerful is"
"this idea of multi-scale competency"
"so this is the idea that there are lots"
"of levels so there are there are"
subcellular
"molecular networks and then cells and"
"then tissues and organs and so on"
"but it's not just that there's a"
"hierarchical organization but the"
"the important part of that is that at"
"each point"
"the components at that level have their"
"own local goals"
"so they are all goal-directed systems"
"whether it be very"
"very humble types of goals like um"
"metabolic homeostatic"
"kinds of things all the way up through"
"very sort of long-term"
"goals that require planning and so on"
"which might be executed by advanced"
"kind of creatures and so on and"
"everything in between"
"so the fact that that that all of these"
"things are"
"cooperating and competing with each"
"other to continue to"
"implement their local goals despite"
"changes in their environment"
"is what gives rise to evolvability and i"
"think is what gives rise to this"
"incredible plasticity that we see a"
"robustness that we see in the biological"
world
"that i think we've got to pour it over"
"that's one of the many things we have to"
"port over"
"is this is this idea that that um there"
"isn't one level at which"
"okay the robot is smart but the parts of"
"it are"
"are passive we need to have some sort of"
"goal directedness at every at every"
"level and then you get these multi-scale"
"um systems that are incredibly robust"
"that's a that's a claim that you know"
"remains to be to be"
"tested and shown i would say"
"there's some of that advanced there"
"there's some of that change of thinking"
"in robotics already but i think it's"
"actually unintentional so far if you"
take
"uh autonomous driving for example you"
"look at the history of you know trying"
"to make self-driving cars"
"the focus at the beginning was on the"
"car itself right how do you make the car"
"autonomous as that technology has"
"started to mature the thinking has"
"become much more about"
"in the us at least you know the national"
"transportation infrastructure as a whole"
"you know highways roadways pedestrians"
"fuel stops cargo people"
"that's the right level of thinking and"
"then you have to think about the cars"
"that are part of that system"
"even the you know even the political"
"system and"
"the regulatory network around"
"transportation you know the"
"the way in which regulation is adapting"
"in lockstep with advances in autonomous"
"driving people talk"
"more the narrative is much more about"
"sort of this co-evolutionary"
"you know dynamic between regulation and"
"autonomous driving"
"you hear relatively little about it is"
"in the car itself"
"anymore and i think that you know that"
"systems level thinking that's that's"
"what happens in biology we need to do"
"that in a conscious way"
"much more in robotics"
"so i've guessed those q since you're"
"already co most of you kind of founded"
"an institute for computationally"
"designed organisms"
"i don't know if the kind of feature do"
"you think you wanted to then what do you"
think
"we need this feature or we aspire to"
"have that this functionality in xenobots"
"i don't know there's something from i"
"don't know if you have this kind of"
"question that something was missing"
"or a way this this feature already"
exists
"i don't know if that's a question do you"
"have or something like that i mean we've"
"only worked with two cell types to begin"
"with skin"
"and muscle tissue and clearly there are"
"many many more cell types and"
"sensory systems uh that we could build"
"into into xenobots"
"mike i don't know if you have any"
"thoughts on that yeah yeah i mean we"
"have a very long"
"uh kind of uh road map of all sorts of"
"capabilities that that we're going to um"
"try to achieve"
"it to to me one of the important things"
"about these zenobot so so i kind of see"
"this as"
"three phases right so so phase one is"
"uh a useful synthetic living machines so"
"so can we program them"
"both structurally and behaviorally to do"
"something useful and there's a million"
"useful applications that you can think"
of
"um then then sort of in the medium term"
"i think of this as a"
"as a as a discovery platform to better"
"understand the rules of morphogenesis"
"so to really understand how it is that"
"uh we can we can convince cellular"
"collectives to build"
"specific things on demand so to really"
"understand the rules of this"
"of and and that and and those"
"applications are in regenerative"
"medicine so not specifically"
"having to do with bots but but using"
"those same strategies on cells in the"
"body to induce regeneration repair and"
"so on"
"and then sort of the third phase i see"
"this as"
"teaching us something profound about"
"collective intelligence and purpose"
"in general so it's a little bit more"
"philosophical in a sense is to help us"
"to refine"
"our terminology everything from from"
"goal directedness to self-assembly to"
"emergence to"
"robot machine living organism and all of"
"these these things are not"
"as um they're they're not they're not"
"simple to define and and those"
"the the reality i think now is the the"
"science has gotten beyond"
"um it's gotten ahead of where the"
"philosophy has been so we need"
"we need to catch up with some of the"
"conceptual issues all the way through to"
"to ethics into various other things"
"so so i i see you know the the novel"
"capabilities are really important for"
"that for that first part but there's"
"lots of"
"other you know lots of other things that"
"are not specifically"
"aimed at um a single functionality as"
"much as in learning how the whole system"
works
"right yeah i'm curious for both of you"
"about the aspiration behind that"
"institute what kind of maybe"
"i don't know the follow-up project or"
"i don't know what about the vision"
"behind this institute that both of you"
"found it uh"
"so what aspiration do you have"
"well we we were kind of joking or i was"
"kind of joking that the mission"
"statement for the institute is task"
"ai organism that's that's it"
"right so as a roboticist again it's this"
"idea of trying to not make any"
assumptions
"about what the machine is that will"
"perform the task or"
"or solve the problem that you have is is"
"i think"
"for me one of the things i hope the"
"institute can do is really roll back our"
"assumptions about what the appropriate"
technology
"is the constellation of technologies for"
"a given"
"a given problem and again biology has"
"much to teach us"
"to teach us there we'd like to start"
"with what is the problem we'd like to"
solve
"and make as few assumptions about the"
"solution as possible and see what we can"
"evolve or create or"
"hybridize to solve it"
"yeah i mean for for me i i agree with"
"this with this idea of rolling back"
"assumptions because if you think about"
it
"all of biology is really working on an"
"example of n equals one right we have we"
"have this one biosphere"
"that has generated of some some standard"
"model systems and and"
"you know some of them are are more"
"unusual than others but nevertheless"
"they all come from one place they're all"
"part of the same evolutionary stream"
"and what oftentimes happens is that"
"people get"
"um it's hyper focused on a specific"
"a model speed you know model animal or"
"whatever and"
"to me this is much more of an artificial"
"life kind of"
"flavor to it in the sense that i'm not"
"interested in the zoology of how one"
"particular species happened to evolve to"
"do x y z"
"i want to understand basic principles of"
"life as it can be and in particular of"
"mind as it can be"
"so so we don't yet have exobiological"
"you know examples but we may at some"
point
"and so i i think we need to get on to"
the
"uh the task of creating novel examples"
now
"so that so that we can really understand"
"you know as feynman said right you don't"
"really understand something until you"
"can make one yourself"
"we need to start doing this and not only"
"from the perspective of origin of life"
"research but actually of uh novel"
"examples of these collectives that scale"
"up from"
"from from one level of intelligence to"
"the next level"
"and i think that uh you know one one"
"like josh pointed out that that um these"
"these creatures you know their"
"evolutionary history took place on his"
computer
"right the the individual cells of course"
evolved
"on earth but their selection pressures"
"were to make"
"nice skin that sits on the outside of an"
"embryo and keeps out the bacteria"
"the the right this was this what what"
"the xenobots are able to do"
"is is not a product of direct selection"
"forces rewarding for zenobot-like"
behavior
"and so um understanding the the"
"the the power of evolution and the basic"
"principles of"
"of life by creating these completely"
"novel examples i think is is really"
powerful
"and and also i think you know we're"
"going to be surrounded"
"soon i think in our lifetime we're going"
"to be surrounded by all kinds of"
"very novel agents in the sense that"
"hybrids of you know humans with implants"
and
"and and are you know various kinds of"
"robotics with living cells in them and"
"um hybrid animals and every possible"
"combination of life and machine"
"is going to be out there somewhere and"
"we're going to be living with all of"
"these things"
"and what i would like our institute to"
be
"is uh is a foundational um"
"center of gravity for starting to uh"
"really come to grips with with life and"
"mind as it can be so that we can develop"
"everything from from applications to um"
"to to to frameworks of how do we relate"
"to creatures that"
"are completely different than us that"
"don't look like us they know they didn't"
"come their origin story is different"
"than ours is"
"uh and yet and yet they may have you"
"know high intelligence and high"
"cognitive capacities in various ways how"
"do we relate to all of these you know"
"both practically and"
"and and sort of you know ethically and"
"all of that so so i i would like us to"
be
"a center of gravity for that kind of"
"thing i wanted to come back to"
"to applications for a moment as mike"
"mentioned a real focus of the institute"
is
"very basic science but i think there you"
"know there are so many"
"pressing social issues at the moment you"
"know global challenges"
"that are not going to be solved by"
"existing technology we can deploy you"
"know as many solar panels as we want"
"we can eat as much plant-based meat as"
"we want these are these are very good"
things
"but i think a lot of us would agree that"
"if we're really going to tackle some of"
"the big big challenges"
"we need to we need to develop"
"technologies that you can't even imagine"
"right now and that that's a daunting"
challenge
"and some of those technologies that we"
"can't imagine"
"may literally be technologies we can't"
imagine
"and that's part of the reason why i like"
"to work with evolutionary algorithms is"
"they can often design"
"things for us that we would not have"
"imagined until we saw it in action"
"and so i think you know hopefully one of"
"the things that the institute will do"
"will be to automate out-of-the-box"
"thinking or"
"out-of-the-box design right it'll create"
"new kinds of creatures"
"useful machines they're going to be"
"crazy ad mixtures of metals and"
"biological tissues that you know the"
macro
"meso micro nano scale many things that"
"are completely different from anything"
"that exists"
"at the moment and aside from that you"
"know the intellectual fun"
"of creating those sorts of things"
"hopefully they can be pressed into"
service
"to tackle some of these really big"
"challenges that we face"
"wonderful thank you for sharing that so"
"i think someone goes to the end and have"
"a few questions the first one what could"
"be technological roblox based on what"
"you mentioned about the challenges that"
"we have"
"beneficial uh solution or application"
"and i know it's very challenging as you"
"say it but what could be technology"
"roblox do you think"
"maybe from biology maybe understanding"
"and i"
"it's very hard and maybe and also what"
"you mentioned from your site so"
"what could be technological roblox too"
"do you think guys you have"
"um from our end uh the biggest"
technological
"roadblock is uh novel instrumentation"
"um and i don't i don't think it's a"
"roadblock as much as it's just the next"
step
"of this field is that uh there are lots"
of
"important novel instrumentation that we"
"have to build"
"to uh both create and really explore the"
capabilities
"of these uh hybrid and synthetic living"
machines
"so um it's the next step of you know we"
"we made"
"uh one of the first um automated um"
training
"uh and testing stations to look at"
"memory and regenerating brains and"
"plenary and all that was ten years ago"
"and that was just that was just the"
"first step of this you know we need"
"automation and we need"
"um ways to uh to create these things"
"in in uh in in high throughput and then"
uh
"and then characterize them in high"
"throughput the way that we can now do"
"with genetics"
"and really to to take bioinformatics to"
"the next level beyond"
"uh dealing with with protein and and you"
"know and and nucleic acid"
"types of information up to structural"
"and behavioral information so really"
"sort of crank up bioinformatics to the"
"next level"
"so i would say the the technological"
"roblox at the moment"
"is um scaling up physical technology"
"so if you look at ai you know we can"
"once you've trained a neural network you"
"can make a million copies of it it's"
"easy to deploy it at large scale"
"but if you're going to try and design"
"you know a million machines either"
"xenobots or traditional robots you need"
"you know factories you need"
"you need deployment systems and"
"typically it incurs a high carbon"
"footprint you know even the"
"multi-billion parameter neural networks"
"in order to train them now there's a"
considerable
"cost in carbon to train them so if we"
"are going to tackle some big challenges"
"you know at the national or the global"
scale
"how do we create technologies and scale"
"them up to"
"large enough numbers that they can have"
"a positive impact"
"without causing more problems along the"
way
"and again i think we can look to biology"
"biology is scaled up"
"covered covered the planet change the"
"planet but also"
"you know maybe there are ways to do this"
"in a more carbon friendly or you know"
"a smaller way you know can we leverage"
"some of the self-replicab"
"self-replicative abilities of biology"
"that make copies of themselves and"
"exponential growth"
"again doing this in a careful manner but"
"i think we again"
"learn a lot from biology about scaling"
"up physical technologies"
"in a lightweight way i think that's at"
"the moment a huge technological"
roadblock
"for every single ai and robotic"
"technology that exists"
"autonomous cars drones even you know"
"neural networks"
"that we have yet to solve and again i"
"think we can look to biology for some"
"potential solutions"
"so maybe the very quick question is i"
think
"uh what could be something you learned"
"most of you i think a way of thinking uh"
"how to choose a problem because i think"
"that's something very interesting how it"
"is a problem and"
"how we can ask the right question what"
"kind of maybe something change"
"impossible the kind of way of thinking"
"about the problems"
"or approaches or qualities of thinking"
"uh i don't know"
"if there's something you change it after"
"that what do you have balls of you"
"doing here"
"yeah it's a really good question i i"
"again this is just anecdotal but"
"most of my favorite collaborations"
"including the one with mike is i knew"
"about mike's work from reading his"
"papers from"
"years back but when i first came across"
"his work i had no idea how it would"
"connect with what"
"what i do or what we do in robotics same"
"thing with rebecca kramer bottiglio at"
yale
"so i would say you know especially for"
"your postdocs or students or"
"you know junior members of the academy"
"that are listening to your podcast"
"we all have those papers where it just"
"blows your mind and it's amazing and"
"it kind of resonates with the things you"
"do but you don't see any obvious"
connection
"you know is to just let those things"
"marinate in your mind and"
"you know just let let them sit there and"
"think and you know"
"it takes a while but sometimes you"
"actually do make that"
"connection you know email the author of"
"the paper see if you can get something"
going
"i think that's you know finding people"
"that are pretty far from what you do"
"but you know intuitively there's"
"something there if you can make that"
connection
"to me that's often the most fertile soil"
for
"for long-term and fruitful"
collaborations
"yeah to to to me um i i often focus on"
"the supposed boundaries between"
"disciplines and to ask myself"
"why is there a boundary and what does it"
"mean in the way that"
"people in each side think about things"
"right so when you think about a"
"biologist and a computer scientist"
"talking to each other and you think of"
"all the gaps that happen in that"
"conversation why is that right so why is"
"one side focused on one particular area"
"of and why is the other side"
"um focused on a different area what is"
"there that can be ported"
"and and what kind of symmetries are"
"there you know what can you what can you"
"what kind of"
"knob can you turn to turn this"
"conversation into that conversation"
"right and what"
"you know can we can we think of what"
"what aspects of biology can we think of"
"as really a problem in computer science"
"just using a different"
"substrate right it's a medium it's not"
"you know transistors whatever it's it's"
"it's cellular"
"types of um substrate so what what what"
"are the invariants that"
"that should look the same in the"
"different disciplines and what are not"
"and that's often very hard but it often"
"leads you to think about things in a new"
way
"you have ever read i don't know if you"
"would like to share with the audience"
"that's a tough one i don't i don't know"
"if you can see mike screen but he's got"
"lots to choose from behind him there"
"i would say there's one book that i"
"recommend most to my students which is"
"vehicles by valentino bradenburg it was"
"written in the 1980s"
"a lot of roboticists will already know"
"this book um braedenberg was a"
"neurophysiologist studied fruit flies"
"um it's a beautiful book it's written"
"almost like a series of fairy story uh"
"fairy tales"
"um he talks about vehicles which you"
"could interpret as robots or organisms"
"or something else"
"it's a very simple book but it's it's"
"pregnant with so many ideas and so many"
"questions that we still haven't answered"
"uh in robotics it would definitely be be"
"up there on my list"
"yeah i i would find it very hard to pick"
"uh just one thing but"
"but i'll just mention that the first"
"thing that came came to my mind"
"are several books uh by this guy jc bose"
"and it's now easy it was well over 100"
"years ago now"
"he worked in india uh was one of the"
"first electrophysiologists"
"and what was really cool is that he took"
"his electrophysiology"
"equipment and he started applying it"
"more broadly so he would he would"
"measure plants of course but also"
"it but also things like metals and then"
"he would he would um"
"do things that you can do in traditional"
"electrophysiology so let's say"
"anesthetics right and sort of knock down"
"the electrical activity"
"and and work and show that you can"
"actually do the same thing in plants and"
"in fact the same thing"
"you saw some of the same phenomena in in"
"organic materials like like metal"
"and so to me that the details don't"
"matter at all what matters is this this"
"idea of"
"of of this um symmetry knob where you"
"take stuff from one field you say okay"
"but what are the the central um"
"the central concepts here and can i"
"pivot them to apply them to other fields"
"and it really sort of"
"opens up your mind to think about that"
"you know traditionally you would never"
"think of that because you're locked into"
the
"well you know neuroscience has these"
"synapses and neurons and there's"
something
"but but what if that's not the magic"
"isn't in the in the in the actual"
"material what if the magic is in"
"uh some other aspect of the organization"
"and how can i port some of those tools"
"just something that came to my mind"
"thank you thank you for changing the"
"world so i will respect your time and be"
"close here"
"i don't know if you have any final words"
"we'd like to say those of you before"
"we're closing"
"any final words you'd like to say just"
again
"i'd like to inspire motivate and"
encourage
"students working in ai and robotics to"
"think broadly"
"to look at biology physics chemistry"
"you know if they're budding soft"
"roboticists you know"
"everyone talks about interdisciplinary"
"work but it really is"
"you know the the next frontier there is"
"so many unanswered questions or"
"questions that haven't even been asked"
"at the intersection between these fields"
"read the literature you know think about"
"these problems"
"and uh yeah try try and think across"
boundaries
"yeah yeah i agree with all that and and"
"i would i would add"
"the flip side to it so what i would say"
"to the students in biology is that"
"there is an amazing world of uh model"
"systems waiting for you"
"in robotics and in in computer science"
"um both both software and hardware and"
both
"and that these are going to teach us"
"lots of important things that are"
"that are hard to do in standard living"
"model systems"
"so yeah thank you once again for"
"suggestion mike for your time i really"
"appreciate your time it was enjoyable"
"listening to you"
"thank you thank you so much thanks for"
"having us thank you thank you"
