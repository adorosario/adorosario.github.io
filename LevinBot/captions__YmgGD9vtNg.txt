"started maybe just two quick"
"housekeeping notes if I may before we"
"begin we'd ask you that you please"

[Applause]
"well thank you Lauren and Peter for that"
"warm introduction and welcome to all of"
"you for this wonderful weekend where"
"you'll have the chance to experience"
"what life is like on campus as your"
"children do I hope yesterday you had the"
"chance to meet some of our leaders our"
"new Provost Nadine Aubrey who joins us"
"from Northeastern University as well as"
"some of the deans Glazer Q Bauer and"
"Solomon of our various schools and"
"hopefully they shared some of their"
"vision for Tufts"
"I'm also you had a chance to meet some"
"of our advising or Residential Life"
"staff and learning career staff as the"
"act outlines and explored some of the"
"many resources that are available to"
"your students here at Tufts today we"
"really want you to spend some time"
"learning like your students do from some"
"of our amazing faculty one of the best"
"parts of Tufts is that these individuals"
"are at the cutting edge of their field"
"and they really do bring the excitement"
"of that into the classroom challenge our"
"students and ask them to join them on"
"their teams in their scholarship to also"
"contribute to these fields some of the"
"notable faculty you'll hear from is"
"Laura ghee associate professor from the"
"Department of Economics discussing"
"behavioral economics understanding"
"irrational behavior and using it to make"
"better decisions"
"Frank Lehman associate professor from"
"the department of music sharing his work"
"in film scoring with a class titled must"
"go faster music in the contempt"
"contemporary action scene he'll ensue"
"professor from the Department of Civil"
"and environmental engineering discussing"
"her research into how air pollution"
"impacts aging and health outcomes"
"Keith Maddox an associate professor and"
"Sam summers professor of psychology"
"discussing the science of stereotyping"
"and implicit bias and Flor van de Velde"
"professor of the practice of the school"
"of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts who"
"will share a class on why art is"
"essential for 21st century learning but"
"as many of you know when you contact"
"your students they're not spending all"
"of their time in the classroom many of"
"them will be enjoying all the"
"opportunities available through clubs"
"athletics music performances dance and"
"other activities and this weekend we'll"
"have a lot of that on display I hope"
"you'll enjoy some of our athletic games"
"including football men and women's"
"soccer field hockey and also the Avenue"
"of the Arts performance where we'll see"
"such amazing talents from our students"
"let me share you with you some brief"
"highlights of this year matriculation"
"started with a great ceremony where we"
"could welcome the class of 2023 what an"
"accomplished group and we're so proud"
"that our engineering school is now 51%"
"women we also had a little bit of a ray"
"rain cloud burst during that"
"matriculation for those of you who were"
"here I hope you were impressed on how"
"quickly we could get the Poncho's out it"
"was quite a sight to see from the stage"
"we've also had some outstanding speakers"
"and I think this is truly one of the"
"opportunities that our students get"
"because of the closeness to the Fletcher"
"School and also the activities in the"
"Tisch College around voting"
"participation and democracy we have some"
"incredible speakers many in the"
"political arena who come through and"
"share their insights and their differing"
"views with your students"
"we had Supreme Court Justice Sonia"
"Sotomayor politicians Bader a wark"
"we had anti-semitism expert Deborah"
"Lipstadt and other of folks like Karl"
"Rove and Ed Markey one of the best"
"celebrations we had this year was the"
"Africana Center's fiftieth anniversary"
"of their Center here on campus we had"
"more than 200 alumni come back from"
"various decades going right back to the"
"60s it was quite a celebration as many"
"of you know Tufts mission is at us as a"
"student-centered research university we"
"put the students at the heart of what we"
"do but of course we have so much"
"scholarship in research that has such an"
"impact on society this morning sessions"
"will give you a sense of faculty"
"research but we also do a lot of work"
"here to support student life one very"
"important issue which is increasingly"
"and almost alarmingly"
"overtaking much of the support we give"
"is around mental health it's an"
"important topic here at Tufts as well as"
"elsewhere in higher education we're"
"fortunate to have excellent on-site"
"resources in place particularly here on"
"the Medford campus and for our s MFA"
"students not only our mental health"
"counseling service but we have a network"
"of surveillance and support from our"
"Dean of Student Affairs and residential"
"life I think they are very good at"
"breathing in chaos and breathing out"
"calm but they face challenges none this"
"nonetheless the utilization of resources"
"is now at a very high level twenty-eight"
"percent of our students both at the"
"undergraduate level and also pro rata"
"into our graduate and professional"
"students are availing themselves of"
"these services over the last 15 years"
"that's a 1 percent per year increase so"
"you can imagine that a lot of the alarm"
"at the moment is because we're creaking"
"at the seams on how we're dealing with"
"such volume if that wasn't the only"
"problem we're also seeing an increase in"
"the number of acute cases students who"
"present with distressing symptoms and"
"panic attacks many of them are also"
"seeing this as the first episode and"
"this reminds you this is the age group"
"where major depression and bipolar"
"disorder and other major mood disorders"
"have their onset because of these"
"factors two and a half years ago I"
"decided to co-chair with Paul summer"
"grad the chair of psychiatry at Tufts"
"Medical Center a task force focused on"
"this mental health crisis we took a very"
"deep dive into services and resources"
"how we could think about prevention as"
"well as increased support for those that"
"were experiencing problems we took a"
"hard look at our policies particularly"
"how we had a surveillance network to"
"pick up students who were failing in"
"academics which of course is one of the"
"first signs that someone may be having"
"trouble when we do surveys 75% of our"
"students say that their academic success"
"is impeded because of mental health or"
"issues so we think it's something we"
"need to take seriously we've had a very"
"positive response from putting our"
"report out I urge you to read it with as"
"many recommendations that we were"
"already able to implement because of"
"wonderful collaboration with our faculty"
"and staff including many that are"
"involved in this surveillance network"
"now that the task force has completed"
"its work I will be happy to co-chair or"
"chair a steering committee which will"
"advance the implementation and the"
"looking at outcomes based on our work we"
"are also joining forces with other"
"colleges and universities nationwide to"
"tackle this problem we have joined a"
"closely with the JED Foundation which is"
"known nationwide as a leader in mental"
"health prevalence and treatment we also"
"recently opened up an office and support"
"at 200 Boston Ave just down the street"
"with the Haven which is a private"
"organization that was very successful on"
"the west coast around substance abuse"
"which is very much related to some of"
"the mental health issues that our"
"students are currently experiencing the"
"Haven provides treatment support and a"
"lot of activities for students who are"
"coming back or seeking support for"
"substance abuse and related mental"
"health issues I know that these are"
"issues that many of you have experienced"
"in your own homes or through relations I"
"know that it's something that we're all"
"struggling with I will have a session at"
"11:15 in the Granoff Music Center with"
"in the Fisher of performance room to"
"discuss and take your questions about"
"these issues I'll be joined by Julie"
"Ross the director of our counseling and"
"mental health service L as well as"
"Kirsten Belling our associate dean of"
"student accessibility and academic"
"resources as many of you know it's not"
"just getting help and treatment and"
"support from the counseling service but"
"it's also understanding how to navigate"
"all the educational accommodations that"
"many of our students need to help them"
"with these issues I really look forward"
"to talking to you as parents about these"
"issues and taking your quest"
"we've also invested a lot in other"
"aspects of student life and that is the"
"built environment in which they live and"
"do their work we've completed a major"
"renovation of Miller Houston I hope"
"you'll have a chance to see how we've"
"opened up those dorms made them disabled"
"like accessible as well as offered new"
"opportunities for juniors and seniors in"
"residences in wood frame houses in"
"Medford in which we're calling community"
"housing Barnum Dana the building right"
"on the quad that used to house biology"
"is now the home of Tisch College film"
"and Media Studies studio arts and Tufts"
"Institute for the environment so I hope"
"you'll have a chance to look at that"
"renovation if you go down to College in"
"Boston Ave you'll see that we've started"
"work on the joists coming Center a"
"building which will house our"
"ever-growing programs in computer"
"science data science economics and"
"mathematics as well as a range of new"
"teaching spaces we hope that will open"
"up in 2021 at the same time as the Green"
"Line extension coming from Lechmere four"
"stops up to directly to our campus we"
"also are adding a squash facility at the"
"back of gancho we hope to open this up"
"in the spring so our squash team will be"
"able to practice on-site but of course"
"like all of our fitness facilities it'll"
"be open up to students faculty and staff"
"as many of you know we're constantly"
"trying to raise funds to support our"
"mission and we have a brighter world"
"campaign which we are in the last couple"
"years of quite a ambitious goal of 1.5"
"billion dollars but supporting"
"transformational experiences for our"
"students supporting faculty research"
"helping to retain the best faculty here"
"at Tufts for their teaching for their"
"innovation and for the spaces they need"
"to carry out their work at the standards"
"that we hope that they will achieve but"
"we also think about how we affect our"
"local communities our global communities"
"what impact does having students come"
"through here one of the best things I"
"get to see as president is how over four"
"years they develop not only"
"intellectually but also personally and"
developmentally
"so when they leave this place they"
"really do understand their position as"
"global citizens wherever they may end up"
"they will take that spirit and invest"
"not only in their careers and in their"
"work but also in their local communities"
"and in their democracies we've done very"
"well raising money we're on target for"
"this goal and thank you to all the"
"parents that have shown their support"
"we've raised 200 million just for"
"financial aid to support making Tufts as"
"diverse as we can but now it's my"
"pleasure to introduce to you one of the"
"most exciting faculty that I've gotten"
"to know during my nine years here at"
"Taif Tufts that's Michael Levin a"
"professor in our biology department who"
"holds the van Avira Bush endowed chair"
"he also currently serves as director of"
"tough Center for regenerative and"
"developmental biology as well as the"
"Alan Discovery Center Mike is a jumbo"
"himself one of the best of our"
"undergraduate alumni where he got his"
"degrees Bachelor of Science in biology"
"as well as computer science so a"
"visionary even at a young age when he"
"saw how these two disciplines were gonna"
"come together to really understand some"
"of the complex issues facing biology he"
"got his PhD from Harvard University for"
"the first characterization of the"
"molecular genetic mechanism undergoing"
"how we our bodies form left-right"
"asymmetric patterns how does the heart"
"motor be on one side and not the other"
"how does the liver know to be on one"
"side and not the other that's thanks to"
"a lot of the work that Mike did as a PhD"
"student this work is on nature's list of"
"the hundred milestones of developmental"
"biology of the century he's recently"
"received honors as scientist of vision"
"award and a distinguished scholar award"
"he mic in 2016 was one of the first two"
"scholars to receive a grant from"
"Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen to"
"create the Alan Discovery Center at"
"Tufts this is a 10 million dollar grant"
"and it's intended to fund research on"
"the frontier of life sciences and I"
"believe you'll see from Mike's"
"presentation just how exciting his work"
"for the future of biology thank you very"
"much and I hope you enjoy the weekend"
"good morning it's a great pleasure to"
"share with you today some of the"
"profound mysteries that keep our group"
"up at night and if anyone is interested"
"in getting in touch with us or you have"
"more questions afterwards please feel"
"free to contact me through these through"
"these websites we can start off by"
"thinking about the fact that if we could"
"control anatomy that is have complete"
"and full control of the complex"
"three-dimensional structure of living"
"form basically almost every issue with"
"potentially the the exception of"
"infectious disease every other issue of"
"biomedicine would be solved if you could"
"control 3-dimensional structure of"
"living things we could repair birth"
"defects we could cause the regeneration"
"of organs after traumatic injury we"
"could reprogram cancer we could reverse"
"aging and degenerative disease and in"
"fact if we understood how cells compute"
"make decisions to get together to build"
"complex organs and structures we could"
"also make synthetic living machines and"
"in fact this would spill over from"
"biology into making robust to novel"
"computing devices and even new"
"artificial intelligence platforms so the"
"understanding of shape and of biological"
"structure is really fundamental for"
"unlocking the promises of regenerative"
"medicine in this post genomic era we all"
"know now that we can sequence genomes"
"and I'm here to talk to you about some"
"of the next steps you know once once we"
"have these genomes what happens next and"
"in particular I want to talk about some"
"of the fundamental problems and then"
"through the eyes of the students the"
"undergraduates that in our group I have"
"made really important advances in these"
"areas tell you some of the things that"
"we're thinking about and so this is this"
"is a view this is sort of a front front"
"entrance to our to our lab this is our"
"Alan Discovery Center is housed in this"
"new science and engineering complex and"
"my group works at the intersection of"
"three three areas so biophysics computer"
"science and cognitive science and this"
"all comes together through the hard work"
"of not only the PhD students staff"
"scientists and so on"
"but but really the undergrads and the"
"undergraduate students have made an"
"amazing set of advances here that I"
"would like to share with you so let's"
"warm up by thinking about plasticity now"
"this is a this is a caterpillar which is"
"a soft bodied creature that has to crawl"
"around and chew leaves and this has to"
"turn into a stiff bodied creature that"
"flies and drinks nectar have completely"
"different behavioral repertoire so"
"during this process of metamorphosis not"
"only is the body completely reshaped but"
"in fact the brain is basically liquefied"
"taken apart and reassembled back into a"
"new kind of architecture that is more"
"appropriate to drive this sort of this"
"sort of creature but the most amazing"
"part so that's that's amazing already"
"but the most incredible part of this is"
"that memories that are formed in this"
"caterpillar brain are retained in the"
"butterfly even though the brain has"
"taken apart and basically recreated from"
"scratch so this this nexus of the"
"plasticity of the information in the"
"brain but also the three-dimensional"
"structure of both the brain and the body"
"really you know brings to the forefront"
"some profound questions of that wood"
"that we don't know the answers to and in"
"fact and this is some work from our lab"
"in in these planaria these flatworms"
"which I'll tell you more about in a"
"minute and one of the amazing things"
"about them is that they regenerate every"
"part of the body so if you were to cut"
"off their head this tail piece right"
"here would regrow a brand new brain from"
"scratch basically and what we found is"
"that memories that this animal generates"
"during its life span if you cut off the"
"brain and let the tail regenerate a"
"brand new head this now keeps the"
"original information and so really this"
"this really raises some profound"
"questions about what is a memory what"
"does it mean to store a learned piece of"
"information in biological tissue in fact"
"when that tissue can be either"
"rearranged or restored from scratch and"
"not only is this important for deep"
"questions of philosophy of mind but"
"really also for the biomedicine of brain"
"disorders because very soon we're going"
"to have adult patients with let's say"
"five decades six decades of experience"
"having stem cells introduced into their"
"into their brain to treat degenerative"
"brain disease what happens to the"
"memories the personalities of these"
"patients and how can information persist"
"through this kind of remodeling so"
"what's really important also is that"
"this kind of plasticity is not only for"
"the brain it in fact also exists in the"
"body and so we all start life here as"
"one cell the fertilized egg and this"
"thing reliably self assembles into one"
"of these many remarkable morphologies"
"and so we need to understand where this"
"pattern comes from and in fact this is"
"this is similar to to a talk I give to"
"to to middle school kids where I start"
"off showing an egg and saying well out"
"of this a could come lots of different"
"types of morphologies what actually"
"determines what comes out and even even"
"you know seventh and eighth graders"
"immediately will say well it's the DNA"
"it's the genome but what does that"
"actually mean this is this is not a"
"simple question and let's talk about"
"this for a second individual cells are"
"highly competent this is a single-cell"
"creature called al Akram area and you"
"see there's no brain here there's no"
"nervous system there's really only one"
"cell in fact and you see what it's doing"
"it has remarkable control over its"
"anatomy it's going around and picking"
"off bacteria that are in its environment"
"it's feeding and it has incredible"
"real-time control over its shape its"
"physiology and its behavior and so if"
"single set and we all used to be single"
"cell so yeah so so so millions and"
"millions of years ago before"
"multicellular creatures evolved this is"
"what was around and the question is if"
"these individual cells are very"
"dynamically competent to handle their"
"own needs how and and why did larger"
"creatures evolve and here you can see"
"that embodies in in embryo so this is a"
"frog embryo this is a zebrafish embryo"
"all of these cells cooperate with each"
"other to build very large structures"
"such as whole entire bodies and so the"
"fact is that when cells transitioned"
"from being free living life forms to"
"making up a body they didn't lose all"
"these intelligent capacities that they"
"had but they harnessed them in a"
"different purpose so instead of just"
"handling the business of a single cell"
"they now cooperate to make much larger"
"structures and the the the boundary or"
"the surface of the self you know the"
"edge of the coherent organism has has"
"grown drastically through through"
"evolution and so we need to understand"
"we start off life as a collection of"
"embryonic blastomeres and we sort of"
"expect that that reliably this is a"
"cross-section through a human"
"or so you can see the amazing complexity"
"all the different tissues that are that"
"are arranged in precisely the right way"
"and all normal all normal babies"
"eventually end up like this so we need"
"to understand where does this anatomical"
"arrangement comes from because if you"
"look at the genome if you actually read"
"what's in the genome this is nowhere to"
"be found what's in the genome are"
"sequences of specific proteins that are"
"inside every cell but we cannot really"
"look at a genome and read out the"
"three-dimensional structure of what's"
"going to come out so it's not directly"
"in there so the question is where does"
"this shape come from how do the"
"individual cells know what to build and"
"when to stop and how far can we push"
"this as engineers or bio engineers we"
"want to understand how would we convince"
"these cells to build something different"
"something new and of course how to"
"repair it if there's if there's damage"
"so all of these are profound questions"
"that are still with us now the important"
"thing about embryonic development is"
"that even though it's highly reliable it"
"is not hardwired so for example if an"
"early mammalian embryo is split in half"
"you don't get to half embryos which is"
"what you would get if you split any of"
"our artifacts you know a computer or you"
"know anything else like this you split"
"it in half but what but it but an embryo"
"is incredibly dynamic in that each half"
"will notice what's missing recreate the"
"missing part and then you get two"
"perfectly normal monozygotic twins you"
"can do the opposite which is to take two"
"mouse embryos mush them together sort of"
"like a snowball without any regard for"
"where the different cells are going and"
"you will get one perfectly normal animal"
"out the other end so that already tells"
"you that this process has a kind of"
"intelligence to it it is not a hardwired"
"set of steps it makes up for these kind"
"of radical deformations and in fact this"
"is not only embryonic so some animals"
"such as this salamander known as the"
axolotl
"this this guy regenerates its limbs its"
"jaws its eyes its ovaries its spinal"
"cord portions of the heart and portions"
"of the brain during adulthood so if you"
"were to amputate and in fact they they"
"do this naturally they sort of bite off"
"each other's legs all the time in the"
"wild and and so it's not it's not just"
"an experimental thing huh so if this"
"happens they they will rapidly regrow a"
"new leg and the new leg is"
"indistinguishable from the original okay"
"and the most amazing part lots of people"
"are working on the the regenerative"
medicine
"question of how do we kickstart this in"
"humans okay that's that's obvious but"
"one of the most remarkable aspects of"
"this is that it knows when to stop think"
"about this this is this is incredibly"
"rapid cell growth but instead of"
"continuing to grow out of control as you"
"might in a tumor it knows exactly when a"
"correct axolotl limb has formed and then"
"it stops how does it know what a correct"
"axolotl limb looks like how does it know"
"when to stop so these are these are the"
"kinds of things that that we work on and"
"in particular this this this animal"
"these planaria they are champions of"
"regeneration they're complex they are"
"our direct ancestors they have a true"
"brain they have bilateral symmetry"
"they're not like an earthworm or"
"something like that they have a most of"
"the same neurotransmitters that you and"
"I have and they have some amazing"
"properties first of all you can cut them"
"in as many pieces as you want the record"
"that's 275 and every piece will grow"
"exactly what's needed no more no less so"
"every piece knows what's missing and"
"will regrow what's what's needed in fact"
"what what this what this has has led to"
"is that these creatures are effectively"
"immortal there is no such thing as an"
"old planaria the individual cells Sen s"
"and die and fall off but the animal"
"regenerates them constantly and so the"
"animals that we have here in our in our"
"lab are in direct physical continuity"
"with animals that were here almost half"
"a billion years ago these are the same"
"animals so if you know the theories of"
"aging that's is that a complex animal"
"like this has to die you know it has to"
"have a limiting limited life span"
"because thermodynamics you you"
"accumulate errors things like this"
"I think these animals are telling us"
"that's wrong immortality with a complex"
"body plan and learning and in fact"
"learning capacity and memory is possible"
"these animals they're doing it so I'm"
"very interested to understand how how"
"how this works but I should say that"
"regenerative abilities not only for"
"these so-called lower animals so the"
"human liver of course is highly"
"regenerative and this was known as far"
"back as the as the classic Greeks I"
"don't know how they knew this but they"
"did deer will regenerate up to about a"
"meter of new bone every year so the"
"antlers fall off and then about at a"
"rate of about a centimeter and a half"
"per day of new bone growth while this is"
"growing back here's an adult mammal a"
"large adult mammal that's growing but"
"new bone at the rate of centimeter and a"
"half and in fact even kid"
"somewhere build Rijn below the age of"
"somewhere between seven and eleven are"
"able to regenerate their fingertips lots"
"of people don't don't notice that that"
"actually if a small child loses a"
"fingertip if you don't so it over it"
"will actually regenerate and then we"
"lose this ability with with h so so it's"
"it's it's some degree of regenerative"
"capacity is still exist and"
"understanding this process is not only"
"vital for medicine and for regenerative"
"medicine but also for robotics and and a"
"robust engineered system so for example"
"we make these highly highly complex very"
"expensive very expensive sorts of"
"autonomous systems you might send them"
"to Mars or somewhere else and if there's"
"some sort of damage whereas this this"
"this biological system will heal itself"
"nicely this is pretty much it and so for"
"the photo for the robot and so we need"
"to understand there are lots of lots of"
"our collaborators are in working in soft"
"body robotics and autonomous systems to"
"try and learn from the biological case"
"to see what would we have to do what"
"what what would we have to do to enable"
"these things to repair themselves ok so"
"I want to give you really a good example"
"of this this this goal-directed behavior"
"that living systems are able to do so"
"this is something we discovered a few"
"years ago we it was it's it's known that"
"that at Apple in order to become a frog"
"has to rearrange its face so during the"
"process of morphogenesis the"
"metamorphosis rather the eyes have to"
"move forward the nostrils have to move"
"out the jaws have everything sort of"
"rearranges and it was thought that this"
"was a rote process meaning that every"
"tadpole looks the same every normal frog"
"looks the same so if every organ always"
"moved the same amount in the same"
"directions everything would be okay"
"so what we did was we looked at what"
"happens to what we call Picasso frogs"
"and these are these are frogs where the"
"the tadpoles start off in very very"
"abnormal position so the eyes are back"
"here the jaws are over here everything's"
"sort of mixed up and what happens"
"remarkably is that during this process"
"they basically turn into pretty normal"
"frogs so what the frog genome does not"
"encode is a set of moves specific"
"movements for the different organs what"
"it does encode is a flexible system that"
"keeps moving and keeps rearranging the"
"different organs until they get to the"
"correct state so this is a kind of"
"back loop it's a homeostatic cycle where"
"it knows what the correct set point is"
"and it will continue to move to minimize"
"that error it will it tries to minimize"
"the difference between where we are now"
"and where we need to be and so this this"
"raises a number of important questions"
"which is how do the cells make group"
"decisions and how do they recognize what"
"pattern is correct or incorrect but it"
"highlights this really remarkable"
"ability of cells when they get together"
"they can work towards specific end"
"points they they they represent a"
"specific stop state and they work to"
"reduce error and they and they they"
"cooperate as striving to achieve this"
"particular say despite various"
"deformations that you might that you"
"might make and so what happened then"
"during evolution is that by getting"
"together by forming networks"
"communicating networks of cells they"
"went from very tiny cells that basically"
"just managed the conditions right around"
"a single cell surface into managing a"
"much bigger thing they now the the the"
"the cell the self has now expanded so"
"that they can now pursue very large"
"goals compared to themselves so the goal"
"of maintaining a whole limb or a whole"
"body or a whole face and so we study"
"these computational processes whereby"
"individual cells merge into networks"
"into tissues organs organisms and"
"perhaps even colonies you can think"
"about ant colonies as a kind of organism"
"as well maybe even human societies as a"
"kind of organism but with each new step"
"in organization the the goals both in"
"duration of time and the the scale of"
"how far they they they propagate from"
"the creature get bigger and bigger so"
"that so that they're now able to work"
"towards these very large kinds of kinds"
"of goals and in fact this is very"
"important by medically because one of"
"the things that was learned and this was"
"not our work this was discovered decades"
"ago that you could actually take cancer"
"cells and introduce them either into a"
"regenerative or into an embryonic"
"environment and they become normalized"
"the cues from the surrounding"
"environment that tells every cell what"
"to do in this case to rebuild the arm of"
"the salamander those cues can take a"
"cancer cell which is basically sort of"
"defected from the from the body planets"
"gone off on its own kind of reverted to"
"this amoeba like ancient existence"
"this can be overridden and so if we all"
"if we had a better understanding of how"
"these cues control cell direction in"
"terms of the purpose that they're trying"
"to they're trying to implement we could"
"have a much better way to address to"
"address cancer than let's say toxic"
"chemotherapy so this kind of"
"reprogramming is up is a profound thing"
"to to try to understand so um it's"
"important to think about what is needed"
"for this kind of transformative"
"revolution and in biology and one"
"revolution that we can think about is"
"what happened in computer science"
"computer science gave us this amazing"
"information technology revolution"
"because the field understood that what's"
"really critical is to control"
"information not just the energy or"
"matter and they focus on the algorithms"
"not only the hardware and what I mean by"
"this is this is this is what computer"
"programming looked like in the 40s so if"
"you wanted to program a computer you"
"literally have to interact with a"
"hardware you have to go in and rewire"
"the thing manually so you have to work"
"at this level you can imagine that doing"
"anything complex at this level is is"
"really hard but over time we've"
"developed things like assembly language"
"and then really high-level languages and"
"we don't touch the hardware so when you"
"on your computer when you switch from"
"from Microsoft Word to Adobe Photoshop"
"you don't have to get out your soldering"
"iron and start that start rewiring write"
"it and it's and the reason is because"
"you've got really good hardware it's"
"because the hardware is able to change"
"what it does based on inputs signals"
"experiences that you give it with your"
"keyboard not by rewiring the hardware so"
"biology currently is very much focused"
"at the level of hardware some of the"
"most exciting advances in in the"
"Biosciences are single molecule advances"
"genome editing single you know single"
"molecule precision techniques and this"
"is these are extremely important but"
"they're just the tip of the iceberg"
"because this is still at the level of"
"hardware we're still rewiring what we"
"really need to understand is to move"
"beyond this machine code and to figure"
"out how to control the software that"
"orchestrates the cells towards specific"
"end points such as rebuilding complex"
"structures so I'm in order to do this so"
"this is what this is what my group tries"
"to do and in order to do this we have of"
"course the the various scientists at all"
"at all levels from from from senior"
"staff scientists to to undergraduates"
"and the model system so we of course use"
"use these planaria we"
"frogs which make tadpoles and eggs and"
"frog embryos and then we even use B"
"slime mold so this is kind of an amazing"
"a neural mechanism an oral organism"
"that's able to make decisions about"
"what's what's around in its environment"
"and explore you know it likes to explore"
"larger objects versus smaller ones so"
"these are all things these are all"
"things that we do and what we've"
"basically found over the last let's say"
"two decades is that just like in the"
"brain so in the brain you have this as"
"well understood you have some hardware"
"which are basically electrical cells"
"electrically active neurons and they"
"talk to each other through these little"
"little connections known as electrical"
"synapses and this Hardware underlies the"
"software of the brain the cognition the"
"behavior and so this is what you're"
"seeing here and this is again not our"
"word what you're seeing here is imaging"
"of the activity of a zebrafish brain as"
"the zebrafish is thinking about whatever"
"it is a zebrafish think about but you"
"can see you can see this this activity"
"and there's this there's this hope"
"called above the field called neural"
"decoding the idea is that if we"
"understood how to decode this you could"
"look at the electrical activity and"
"figure out what is that animal or in"
"fact human patient thinking about what"
"are the memories the planning the the"
"cognitive structure that is encoded by"
"this so it turns out we what we've been"
"able to find is that actually not only"
"brains but all cells in the body do this"
"so all cells have the same kinds of ion"
"channels they have the ability to pass"
"this on to two neighboring cells and"
"they form networks and what you're"
"seeing here is for the first time and"
"this is this is a time-lapse video made"
"by a colleague of mine Danny Adams who"
"we we use these voltage sensitive dyes"
"that basically show up as different"
"different colors based on the electrical"
"activity of the cells and so you're"
"seeing the the early few hours of a frog"
"embryo and all of these cells are"
"communicating with each other to decide"
"who's going to be head who's going to be"
"tail left-right and belly and back and"
"so on and so very much like in the brain"
"all of the cells in your body from the"
"very first divisions after the egg is"
"fertilized start these electrical"
"signals to figure out what they're going"
"to do and what the and while these kinds"
"of networks think about behavior they"
"think about controlling the body these"
"networks think about shape they think"
"about how to format and"
"and and then repair you the the body and"
"so all of this works sort of like this"
"with very slow slowly changing voltage"
"gradients not spiking like you have in"
"the nervous system and nothing to do"
"with this is not at all having to do"
"with like electromagnetic waves or have"
"you know holding your cell phone up to"
"your head for too long so these kind of"
"one of the first things we can do is we"
"can we can detect these patterns we can"
"basically read the the the electrical"
"memories of these cells as they're"
"deciding what to do and this is an"
"embryo putting its face together and you"
"can see here that that that there's"
"already in the electrical if you just"
"look at the electrical state of these"
"cells you can already see that it's"
"planning to put a turn on the genes that"
"will cause eye development to do that"
"here and here's the mouth and here's"
"that's already laying out it's it's like"
"a subtle scaffold for the gene"
"expression and the anatomy that's going"
"to follow but these are natural patterns"
"and you want to be able to to track them"
"and to repair them for for birth defects"
"and things like this but they're also"
"pathological ones this for example is a"
"tumor seen in an early temple and you"
"can see that already"
"even before the tumor shows up you can"
"see electrically that these cells have"
"already severed their electrical"
"connections to their neighbors they're"
"going to basically they're about to"
"decide that they are amoebas once again"
"they're going to treat the rest of the"
"body as environment they're going to"
"move other places that's metastases over"
"proliferate and so on so this kind of"
"thing is is sort of an obvious"
"diagnostic has diagnostic potential can"
"we see can we see this early and can we"
"intervene before the cells have really"
"left the the body plan so in in planaria"
"what we've been able to do is to show"
"that that some of these patterns are in"
"fact determinative of what happens so so"
"when the head and the tail are removed"
"and you take this in the middle fragment"
"that's going to regenerate a complete"
"worm there's this electrical pattern"
"that tells you where the head and the"
"tail ERG or it's going to be and so if"
"we reproduce this this head electrical"
"State back here what you end up with is"
"a two-headed worm and this is not"
"photoshopped these are real live animals"
"that are that are in our lab so you can"
"make two-headed worms you can make no"
"headed worms and so on and in fact this"
"this body can can contain a"
"a number of electrically encoded pattern"
"memories for what it's going to produce"
"if it is injured and this was this was"
"recently just on the cover of the"
"biophysical Journal does some of this is"
"some of this work and it was done by by"
"a graduate student Fallon Durant but one"
"of the remarkable things about this"
"pattern memories that like a good like"
"any good memory once you've changed it"
"it keeps so once we take a normal worm"
"and we've made a two-headed worm out of"
"it by changing the electrifly 48 hours"
"that's all it takes to control the"
"electrical signaling it makes this"
"two-headed animal from that on forever"
"as many times as you want to remove the"
"head the two heads in plain water no"
"more manipulation of any kind this will"
"now continue to regenerate as a"
"two-headed animal what we've done is"
"permanently alter the the electrical"
"representation of what these cells think"
"a normal planarian is supposed to look"
"like so once that pattern has changed"
"and it's stable and it's a kind of"
"memory just like electrical memory in"
"the brain"
"once you change this the cells will"
"continue to build to this pattern"
"although we can now wipe it back and go"
"back and make them make them this way so"
"so so remember that this was all done"
"without changing the genome there's no"
"genomic editing here so so the genome"
"here is completely wild-type so if you"
"were to sequence the genome of this guy"
"it would be identical to this I mean"
"there's no there's no difference that is"
"not where this information is so think"
"about how much there is left for us to"
"do beyond just simply having having a"
"genomic sequence for these things now I"
"I want to tell you a couple of stories"
"for some of the undergrads that have"
"made amazing process of progress in in"
"this field so the first the first one is"
"is is Maya Emmons bell she was a Beckman"
"scholar in my group she's currently"
"doing a PhD in Berkeley and she asked"
"the following question well this is nice"
"and it makes two heads but these heads"
"are awful normal what can we do to"
"change this electrical activity could"
"might it be also involved in changing"
"head shape"
"and what she discovered was there's a"
"different way to perturb this electrical"
"circuit to change the head shape to be"
"like that of other species of worms so"
"here's a here's a particular species of"
"worm you can see it's got a triangular"
"head with a little little oracles here"
"and when you cut off that head and let"
"it regenerate while manipulating that"
"electrical circuit what it will do is it"
"can make flat heads like a peaceful"
"it can make round heads like an S"
"Mediterranea or it could make its own"
"normal triangular head these species oh"
"and by the way it's not just the head"
"shape it's the the shape of the brain"
"and also the distribution of the stem"
"cells are exactly like these other"
"species they basically get heads"
"belonging to another species of animal"
"these guys are about 150 million years"
"of evolutionary distance between this"
"and this and yet the genome is untouched"
"and so you can see here how important"
"this this bioelectrical a sort of"
"physiological layer of software is lying"
"in between the hardware that's specified"
"by the genome and the actual outcome and"
"and of course it's more than by"
"electricity so there are chemical"
"gradients there are physical forces"
"stresses and tensions and all of that"
"all of that is important but it's it's"
"simply amazing to what extent we can"
"reprogram some of this some of the"
"software without having to change the"
"genomic hardware so so she discovered"
"this and then after that she found so so"
"that was a that was a nice a nice paper"
"in sciences but then she she also"
"discovered that in fact planaria don't"
"even have to be flat so so we were able"
"to make worms that have this really"
"strange spiky morphology or this sort of"
"cylindrical it looks like a like a ski"
"cap kind of thing or even tubes coming"
"out the back so there are regions of the"
"space of all possible planarian shapes"
"that evolution either has not explored"
"or has explored and decided was not you"
"know Fitness was not was not good so you"
"don't see them in the wild but but"
"really the the range of anatomies that"
"you can you can induce out of a"
"genetically normal planarian cells is"
"really extremely extremely large and so"
"another student in the lab and this is"
"Jen Hamilton who is currently doing a"
"PhD at MIT she was she was a she studied"
"what both computer science and biology"
"and what she was able to do was to make"
"models brain like models of cellular"
"decision-making so she had a couple of"
"nice nice papers as first author as did"
"as it Maya showing that we can we can"
"come up with with representations very"
"similar to what computer scientists use"
"they're called artificial neural"
"networks and they're sort of a basic"
"paradigm by which people understand"
"to understand how information is stored"
"and processed in in computers and"
"machine learning so she was able to make"
"these kind of closed-loop systems where"
"the network would assess and modify its"
"own morphology it would think about its"
"own shape and this is a pretty important"
"advance and one of the things that this"
"this kind of brain like model suggested"
"was well what what one thing but that"
"brains do is they represent the rest of"
"the body so in your brain in your ears"
"for example in your sensory cortex you"
"have cells that map on to all the"
"different parts of your body so your"
"hands your fingers you know the"
"proportions of your face and so on are"
"represented inside a region of your"
"brain and so another student in another"
"undergraduate in the lab Sarah who's"
"currently in training as she's an"
"Olympic quality rower she's currently uh"
"well she graduated she's role practicing"
"for the 2024 Olympics she found the"
"following remarkable thing that it's not"
"only the brain that represents distal"
"tissues but actually the rest of the"
"body does too so here's a froglet it"
"looks like this it still has a tail so"
"it hasn't shed its tail yet if this limb"
"gets injured so it gets amputated and"
"what the color here represents are these"
"this is a this is a bio electric readout"
"we're able to see in the living animal"
"the electric state just like I showed"
"you in the embryo when this at when this"
"limb gets amputated right here the"
"opposite limb that was not touched in"
"any way it's uninjured lights up in very"
"much the same position and so by"
"watching the electrical activity of this"
"limb within 30 seconds it takes about 30"
"seconds for the information to get"
"across you can tell where the damage was"
"and what kind of damage it was as well"
"so it's possible that lots of different"
"body areas represent what's going on in"
"other regions of the body which is"
"interesting not only from the basic"
"perspective of how does information get"
"around in the body but you can think"
"about some of the things like surrogate"
"site Diagnostics if can we look at a"
"convenient portion of the patient to see"
"what's going on somewhere else that"
"might be difficult too difficult to"
"image and so so she had a very nice"
"first author paper in in development so"
"this work is is being pushed forward"
"towards regenerative medicine so here"
frogs
"unlike salamanders do not regenerate"
"their legs so if you amputate a frog leg"
"you will either get a hypo morphic spike"
"or nothing like that"
"and so what why"
"our team has done and this is a postdoc"
"Celia and then her two undergraduate"
"students that worked with her Cristina"
"and Hailey and this Provost this this"
"work is going towards developing"
"cocktails of drugs which affect if the"
"electrical properties of cells to"
"kick-start limb regeneration so you see"
"here we're starting to get toes there's"
"a toenail eventually a pretty good leg"
"and you can see here when you touch it"
"the leg is both sensitive and motile so"
"it's actually it's actually functional"
"and so now in collaboration with Dave"
"and David Kaplan's lab they're making"
"these wearable bio reactors that are put"
"on to the next model which is a rodent"
"model and the idea is to really develop"
"a supportive aqueous almost almost"
"embryonic like environment with"
"electrical but with with with what we"
"call Iona suitable drugs which basically"
"control the electrical activity of the"
"cells to convince them to rebuild the"
"limb the same way they did during"
"embryonic development so this is an"
"example of a regenerative medicine"
"application as well as well we have we"
"have another project which is worked on"
"by other undergraduates where we have"
"these these human cancer cells and we"
"are attempting to transfer basically"
"reprogram them back to normal with a"
"variety of electrical and light"
"stimulation so all of these things are"
"really really complex and we are"
"developing ways to try to infer novel"
"intervention so so what kind of stimulus"
"would give us a particular system and"
"push it push it over to a to a healthy"
"state from a disease state and and we're"
"using techniques from from machine"
"learning and AI and this was some"
"advances made by another student Taylor"
"Malone who he worked with one of our"
"postdocs Daniel Lobo who and their work"
"actually ended up discovering a a model"
"of planarian regeneration which was the"
"first model in this field discovered by"
"a nonhuman intelligence so what what"
"they did was to create a an artificial a"
"simple artificial cognitive system that"
"was able to think about all of the"
"different experiments that have been"
"done in planaria and come up with an"
"understanding of what's going on in it"
"and to my knowledge that's the first"
"such that came from a nonhuman scientist"
and
"around Taylor was was involved in that"
"so to close up I just want to say there"
"are lots of this is just a small sample"
"there are many many other undergraduates"
"we have probably on the order of ten"
"undergraduate students every semester"
"working with us and and they do really"
"remarkable work that that pushes forward"
"the frontiers of this interdisciplinary"
"science they they they most of them end"
"up as good as co-authors on papers many"
"of them are first authors on the papers"
"they really do incredible work here and"
"in fact some of them start even earlier"
"so some students contact me even even"
"before they get to college so this for"
"example is Nina Frank who got in touch"
"as a beginning high school student and"
"she did work basically in her home and"
"in her in her high school with with me"
"on the phone and as a result she got"
"real data and she ended up with a paper"
"in macro molecular bioscience so really"
"it's it's the it's the it's the drive"
"and the energy of these students who"
"want to tackle these difficult problems"
"and and really put an incredible effort"
"that that pays off and and and I think"
"Tufts is a pretty ideal environment in"
"which they can do that so I want to"
"finish by thanking the various postdocs"
"who have done some of the work that I've"
"I've showed you our collaborators of"
"course the animals that we work with our"
"funding support do you have to thank the"
"animals our funding support from from"
"the Allen frontiers group and several"
"other foundations and and a special"
"shout out from from Susan our for Susan"
"Ernst who's a member of the biology"
"department with whom I worked when I was"
"switching over from from from computer"
"science to biology as a student here and"
"and so this is this is 1992 that's my"
"graduation from from Tufts and there she"
"is and she just retired very recently"
"but we work together and and working at"
"her lab made me think that it was"
"possible to bring my skills in from from"
"computers and engineering into biology"
"and really really do something something"
"relevant so I will I will close there"
"and just to show you that if you're"
"wondering what what 2-headed planaria"
"look like when they're when they're"
"moving around this is it so thank you"
"and I'll be there for questions I'll be"
"in the back"
[Applause]
"so as everybody is fascinated by that as"
"I was it never I never stopped learning"
"something new every time so thank you so"
"much professor Levin that was"
"fascinating we we have a full day for"
"you plan to have planned we have a"
"number of sessions going on next in this"
"room will be Laura G talking about"
"economics and check your brochures and"
"there should be a slide coming up that"
"will direct you in a moment to the next"
"locations have a wonderful rest of the"
"day and thank you for coming"
[Applause]
