"they're going to be surprises for sure i"
"mean the the the the most certain"
"hallmark of collective intelligence is"
"that they surprise you that's you know"
"that's that's the most obvious thing but"
"you hope that you discover the key"
"surprises during testing that that's"
"what all the testing is for"
"uh called the endless forms most"
"beautiful 2.0 right it's darwin and"
"darwin had this phrase and he was like"
"really impressed with the variety of"
"living things that he saw in the natural"
"world this is an n of one you know this"
"this this phylogenetic tree on earth is"
"an n of one basically we we are going to"
"be it's a tiny if you if you plot out"
"the space of of all possible uh bodies"
"and minds that go with them everything"
"we know about on earth is like a tiny"
"little corner of that and there are just"
"massively different creatures that we"
"are going to have to deal with never"
"never mind what happens if we find life"
"you know exobiological context outside"
"the planet never might not we're going"
"to be making aliens like you can't"
"believe that's that's just that's just"
"there's no there's no getting around"
"that so"
"so hello and welcome to the cheeky"
"science show where in this video i had"
"great fun speaking with dr michael levin"
"principal investigator at tufts"
"university whose lab studies anatomical"
"and behavioral decision making at"
"multiple scales of biological artificial"
"and hybrid systems in the following"
"discussion we talk about regeneration"
intelligence
"and synthetic living machines"
"so i hope you enjoyed the conversation"
"as much as i did"
"so hi mike thank you very much for"
"joining me today and welcome to the"
"cheeky science show"
"thank you yeah it's good to be here well"
"i'm like super fascinated and excited to"
"have you on today um because your"
"research is just fascinating and"
"i have so many questions possibly more"
"questions for you than i have had for"
"any of my other guests previously so i'm"
"sure we'll cover like a a broad specs"
"from a very interesting topic today"
"great yeah let's let's do it so i guess"
"yeah we'll just jump straight into it"
and
"the first topic i just kind of want to"
"explore is this idea of regeneration and"
"how i guess"
"you know if we lose a limb or we lose a"
"finger like from an evolutionary"
"perspective that might be seen as being"
um
"kind of an unfit thing to not be able to"
"regenerate or regrow"
"different limbs and obviously"
"um we have like wound repair systems and"
"different approaches to dealing with i"
"guess such stressful events such as loss"
"of a limb"
"but i guess my first question is"
"what exactly is regeneration and how"
"does regeneration fit onto like the tree"
"of life and"
"which organisms do you possess"
disability
"yeah so so i i i'll tell you what i know"
"about regeneration in general and then"
"maybe i can i can float an idea for what"
"i think it really is because i think"
"it's a little different than um than how"
"a lot of people think about it"
"so regeneration is uh sprinkled uh"
"pretty uh pretty capriciously acro"
"across the tree of life"
"uh there are you know oftentimes people"
"think that some like"
"so-called simple systems regenerated and"
"more advanced ones don't it's really not"
"like that there are there are very"
"similar species where some of them"
"regenerate and others don't regenerate"
"anything so it's kind of it's it's quite"
"unclear actually why it comes and goes"
"some species like planaria regenerate"
"everything um even small pieces will"
"regenerate an entire worm"
"some species like um"
"salamanders they will regenerate uh"
"appendages eyes uh limbs uh heart uh"
"portions of the brain um spinal cord"
ovaries
"uh some mammals do interesting things so"
"so for example deer regenerate their"
"antlers so deer will regenerate a"
"centimeter and a half of new bone per"
"day when they're growing their antlers"
"which is like this amazing amount of"
"bone and vasculature and innervation and"
skin
"and you know humans of course regenerate"
"their liver and things like that so"
"uh yeah regeneration is uh"
"it's it's it's really unclear uh"
"why some species regenerate and some"
"don't i i can i can tell a couple of"
"interesting stories about it"
"one thing that people sometimes think is"
"that the reason that long-lived species"
"like us don't regenerate is because it"
"carries a cancer risk right so the idea"
"would be that uh if your body has access"
"to some sort of highly plastic"
"proliferative cell types then you that"
"you can you know that can that can"
"increase the odds of cancer during a"
"long lifetime so that that view when you"
"think about it from the bottom up in"
"terms of cell cycle checkpoints and and"
"genetic damage and things like that"
"would predict that animals with the best"
"regenerative ability would have the"
"highest levels of cancer and in fact the"
"the reality is the exact opposite"
"animals that are good regenerators have"
"very low cancer and there are all kinds"
"of uh uh examples of normalization where"
"for a salamander or a planarian that"
"does get cancer"
"you induce regeneration and that process"
"basically clears it up and normalizes"
"the cells and and you know you're back"
"to normal so"
"i think the better way to look at it is"
"if if if you don't if you if if the body"
"does not have very strong anatomical"
"control so the ability for cellular"
"collectives to know what it is that they"
"should be building and and to build it"
"then you are going to be both not very"
"regenerative and prone to cellular"
"defections like cancer so i think"
"and i think what we're really looking at"
"when we talk about regeneration i don't"
"think it is"
"some special capacity that sort of"
"evolved as an add-on to to help you"
"survive injury and stuff like that i"
"think it's it's the consequence of an"
"incredibly basic fundamental thing of of"
um
"multicellular life and in fact even"
"unicellular animals can regenerate which"
"is uh uh anatomical homeostasis the idea"
"that you that that you solve problems in"
"anatomical speemorphic space meaning"
that
"you start out at one type of"
"configuration and you're trying to get"
"to a particular region of anatomical"
"orpha space which is that that target"
"morphology for your species whatever"
"that might be"
"and living things to being very good"
"homeostats have all kinds of tricks to"
"get to where they're going despite"
"perturbations like mutation like injury"
like
"uh teradata you know teratogens all of"
that
"so i think that um regeneration is"
"actually the basal state and i think"
"that for example embryonic development"
"is a kind of regeneration"
"in that in that what happens from the"
"perspective of every developmental stage"
"the prior stage is really a birth defect"
"and it needs to be fixed so from the"
"from the perspective of being a gastrula"
"the blastula is all wrong and so what"
"will happen is the blast there's a"
"remodeling event that takes a blastula"
"and so i have this i have this model"
where
uh
"there's a there's a there's a stress"
driven
um
"set of uh set of homeostatic uh"
"processes which are basically trying to"
"reduce the delta between what you think"
"you should what what what the what the"
"pattern should be which is encoded in a"
"particular bioelectrical state which we"
"can talk about by electricity too"
"and and and that delta you know as soon"
"as you've you've remodeled yourself and"
"you've reduced that delta and now you're"
"a particular stage that bioelectric"
"pattern has meanwhile moved on so now"
"you're wrong again and now you have to"
"remodel again and it sort of basically"
"pulls you stage by stage through a set"
"of regenerative events"
"that uh eventually and eventually every"
"you know everything sort of"
"flattens out in in adult and adult"
"patterning at least for most animals"
"and so"
"yeah that's where i think i think"
"regeneration is very fundamental it's a"
"it's a basic homeostatic control loop"
"well yeah that's a really interesting"
"viewpoint and to kind of just i guess go"
"a bit further with the idea about how um"
"there isn't maybe an increased cancer"
"risk having this regenerative potential"
"then why is it you know with humans and"
"other i guess a large organisms do we"
"see less of a regenerative potential"
"like it seems like a kind of"
"look a bad decision but a bad"
"evolutionary offense to have done"
"something like that"
"no so no one knows for sure but i can"
"tell a story that may or may not make"
"sense um"
"of course there are going to be"
"trade-offs all kinds of trade-offs and"
"so so think about our ancestors so let's"
"say you're some sort of a primitive"
"mouse-like creature running around the"
"forest right back in the day and"
"somebody uh bites your leg off"
now
"unlike a salamander there's a couple of"
"major differences different the first"
"difference is that you're in dry air"
"instead of water so that means that you"
"are uh not able to drive the ion"
"currents out of your wound epithelium"
"that you would when you were if you were"
"aquatic most good regenerators are"
"aquatic right and and being in water is"
"and this is this is one of the reasons"
"one of our uh regenerative applications"
"that we work on has has is these"
"wearable bioreactors that provide an an"
"aqueous you know david kaplan's group"
"works with us to make these aqueous"
"bio um micro environments for the for"
"the wound because that's very important"
"the other very important thing is that"
"um you're gonna try to put weight on it"
"unlike a salamander which can sort of"
"hang out buoyantly you somebody bites"
"your leg off and you develop some some"
"delicate blastema cells at the wound"
"you're immediately gonna be crushing"
"them into the forest floor and putting"
"weight on it and so i can easily see"
"between that and the fact that you might"
"you're going to you might get infected"
"and you're going to bleed out and and"
"you know your whole life cycle life"
"style is much faster than for for"
amphibians
um
"i can easily see why evolution would"
"take the trade off and say let's just"
"scar but we won't get infected we're not"
"going to spend all that all that energy"
"trying to re-regenerate something that's"
"just going to get wrecked and infected"
"let's just scar and get inflamed scar"
"hope we don't we don't you know catch a"
"terrible infection and see if we can you"
know
"live through this so that's that's"
"that's the story that i think makes"
"sense and of course no one knows for"
sure
"yeah i mean that does kind of make sense"
"to me as well but you've already brought"
"up kind of like where i was heading um"
"in my thought process with the questions"
"which is this idea about these wearable"
um
"biosensors these biodomes i believe you"
"call them um and you've done uh"
"experiments in particular with frogs"
"called cynipus where you've amputated"
"their limbs and you've got them to wear"
"these biodomes and you can see"
"regeneration of their limbs"
"and not only that but also potentially"
"functional as well"
"and this paper i believe came out"
"earlier this year um and i was just"
"wondering if maybe you could elaborate a"
"bit more about what these these biodomes"
"actually are and how they're functioning"
"yeah yeah um we actually had a couple of"
"papers on this there was one in in well"
"there was a there was a an earlier one"
"uh in 2018 and then and then there was"
"this one that just came out the idea is"
"this we we are we are very interested in"
uh
"morphogenesis as a collective"
"intelligence so we're interested in not"
"micromanaging the process and let's say"
"3d printing a bunch of stem cells into a"
"very particular structure we're"
"interested in understanding how the"
"collective of the cells normally makes"
"decisions about what it's going to grow"
"when it's going to grow and so on and so"
"our strategy"
"what we think should be possible is if"
"if these hypotheses are correct what"
"should be possible is to find high-level"
"triggers that don't"
"sort of babysit the process and try to"
"control everything that needs to happen"
"to make an organ but actually just shift"
"the the the the set point for these"
"cells and then let them do what they do"
"best which is to reduce error and to"
"build to the set point so activate that"
"homeostatic process"
"so we start so we started looking for"
"these for these level"
"uh control control structures and i"
"could tell you about others that we"
"found by studying by electricity so we"
"make eyes and repairing brain defects"
"and reprogram tumors so we can talk"
"about that separately but for the leg"
"thing we basically found uh and this was"
"this was uh back in 2010 we did we did"
"uh we published some work showing that"
"you can induce tail regeneration now"
"tails are cool because they have spinal"
"cord and muscle and so on so we showed"
"that we can induce tail regeneration uh"
"just by one hour of application of this"
"specific ionophore so setting setting"
"the bioelectric state of the wound uh"
"using a sodium ionophore but just for"
"one hour triggers all the downstream"
"cascades all the gene expressions cell"
"movement the all that stuff so we looked"
"for the same we used the um"
"uh the same uh kind of uh we used the"
"same kind of cocktail and some different"
"ones and the idea was in order to"
"trigger it you need really two things"
"you need an environment to convince"
"those cells that it's safe to regenerate"
"right so you need some sort of a very"
"controlled closed environment that's"
"almost like amniotic almost like a limb"
"bud you know um"
"and that they would be able to signal to"
"each other and not get washed out in the"
"in the bath and so on and then and then"
"you need the payload which is the signal"
"the drugs that that cause the signal"
"right the the so the biodome is the"
"delivery method and it's the environment"
"but now you need to have some kind of a"
"drug in there that will activate them"
"and so we're working on a variety of uh"
"but by the way i have to i have to do a"
"disclosure so david kaplan and i are"
"um co-founders of a company called"
"morphaceuticals inc so so"
"morphaceuticals is all about taking what"
"we've learned in the frog and moving it"
"into into mammals so we're doing"
"experiments in mice now and then"
"hopefully clint you know clinical work"
"at some point so so every you know i"
"have to have to do that that disclosure"
"and there's a commercial interest here"
"so the idea so so the idea is that um"
"we david's group created the biodome the"
"biodome is filled with an aqueous gel"
"that's made of silk and that gel has"
"various other drugs that that we put in"
"there it's put on the amputation wound"
"for 24 hours just just one day that's it"
"24 hours"
"and then you take it off and you don't"
"touch the animals again and the leg"
"grows over a year and a half so you get"
"a year and a half of light right so"
"there's a few amazing things i think"
"about about this number one animals that"
"normally do not regenerate their legs as"
"adults in fact can be made to regenerate"
"their legs as adults right that's even"
"possible it wasn't known before that"
"that's possible so it's possible number"
"two uh it's a very modular effect in"
"other words we didn't intervene with"
"finely shaped gradients for a year and a"
"half we did nothing after the first 24"
"hours the animal did everything okay so"
"so it's a very it's a trigger it's not"
"um it's not it's not a micro management"
"type of situation number three um in"
"that trigger"
"uh we didn't even have to"
"specify what organ we wanted the the the"
"trigger cocktail is very generic in fact"
"we've done the exact same thing to make"
"tails as it was to make i had to make"
legs
"it's literally a make whatever belongs"
"here signal it's not make a leg so so"
"you never get in on a leg amputation you"
"never get an eye or a tumor or a tail or"
"you know anything else you always get"
"what belongs like"
"so it's a very context sensitive process"
"we're not forcing the cells we're"
"communicating to them that they should"
"make whatever it is that they already"
"know goes there the last and then the"
"last kind of amazing thing about it is"
that
"this cocktail that was the first one we"
"tried it wasn't cocktail 78 out of like"
"300 cocktails that we tried we didn't"
"have i mean originally one of the"
"limitations of this work is originally i"
"i foolishly thought that this was going"
"to be a rapid screening process that we"
"could use before you know and it's it's"
"it's it's not rapid by any means and so"
"we only got to try one cocktail but the"
"one cocktail we tried was amazing and so"
"i you know i i don't believe in luck and"
"so to me that's that that suggests that"
"it's not that we just happen to have"
"somehow lucked out onto the best"
"cocktail in the world"
"once we optimize this thing we're really"
"going to see"
"remarkable outcomes this is just this is"
"our first guess at it you know this is"
"just our first step"
"yeah no that really is quite incredible"
"and you've just raised a couple of"
"questions on my head firstly it's like"
"how soon do you have to intervene after"
"you've like induced the damage and like"
"is there like because i guess you have"
to
"quickly maybe induce the pattern before"
"you suppress like the the more like"
"scarring of the tissue"
"and then secondly what was the rationale"
"behind the decision of the drugs that"
"you use"
"yeah so"
uh
"i i don't know when is the latest that"
"you can do it we don't know in older"
"work in the tale we did investigate this"
"and we find out that we find out that"
"even after the tail of wound forms"
"what in for the frog is the equivalent"
"of us of a wound of a scar so it's"
"basically like this thick non-permissive"
epithelium
"even after that it still works i have a"
"feeling that in mammals what you would"
"have to do is you would have to recut so"
"if somebody had if somebody had a limb"
"loss 10 years ago and everything's"
"healed over i think you're gonna have to"
"reopen the wound then put on"
"the biodome and then go from there"
"that's my guess we don't know but that's"
"that's that's what i think"
um
"the uh the choice of the choice of drugs"
so
"in previous work we had done a few"
"things we had we had uh tested a couple"
"of bioelectric interventions which are"
"kind of the thing my lab focuses on"
"we've also done progesterone the 2018"
"paper was about progesterone and that"
"was because the postdoc at the time"
"celia herrera rincon wanted to"
"go upstream and try to find something"
"that triggers"
"not only the right bioelectrical signal"
"but various other changes in the animal"
"that that might be pro-regenerative so"
"she went with progesterone and it was"
"and that was shockingly effective right"
"the new the new cocktail which is even"
"better has a number of ingredients which"
"again not specifically by electric this"
"time now we're doing a bunch of"
"bioelectric stuff next but this"
"particular one had things like"
"you know it had a it had it had uh"
"neurotrophic factors in it and it had"
"growth hormone and it had retinoic acid"
"which is a positional information"
"molecule for for it for the limb and it"
"had um"
"a uh uh kind of a a resolve in the you"
"know so so so pro pro wound resolution"
"kind of kind of molecule and so on"
"so it was kind of a it was kind of mix a"
"mix of things that we thought would"
"would convince the cells that it's time"
"to regenerate as opposed to you know as"
"opposed to scar and yeah it worked"
"really well and i mean i can't wait to"
"to to get to try all the different"
"improvements that you can imagine right"
"after the first trial"
"yeah for sure and i think you already"
"sort of mentioned it but as you say you"
"have the bioreactor on for 24 hours and"
"then it takes like a year for it to"
"regrade the limb and so in terms of"
"scalability it's quite hard to maybe i"
"guess scale up and try different"
"interventions but i guess given the"
"remarkable result from your first"
"approach then that i guess gives a lot"
"of promise for identifying um"
"better and better combinations as well"
"yeah yeah i mean at this point at this"
"point uh we're in mice now we're doing"
"it in mice now but i think there's"
probably
not
"well if i mean if resources were"
"unlimited there's still frog things to"
"be done but but but given given how long"
"that takes and and limited resources"
"we're just going for mice at this point"
"um which which also you know which also"
"take a little bit of time i mean i you"
"know in the end in terms of clinical"
"clinical um"
"uh kind of import look uh a a a"
"as a five-year-old's arm is very usable"
"right you can write you can shave you"
"can you can eat you can do whatever"
"you're gonna do so if somebody if"
"somebody in their 20s"
"loses an arm in an accident somewhere"
"and you think that okay five to seven"
"years later you have an arm that you can"
"you can type and you can do everything"
"with that's pretty good that's a good"
"deal even if even if it you know even"
"even if even if it grows no faster than"
"a typical arm you know a kid's a kid's"
"arm is very usable so i think i think in"
"the end even worse case scenario i think"
"it'll be fine"
"yeah for sure and like in terms of i"
"guess as you mentioned translating it to"
"humans what kind of like criteria or"
"like tick list of achievements do we"
"need to see before we actually start"
"giving it as a human therapy serve"
"well there's a lot there's a long road i"
"mean lots of lots lots and lots of basic"
"research needs to happen right so i i"
"don't want to give the idea that we're"
"sort of ready to start testing it on"
"humans because we're absolutely not um"
"fundamentally there's a number of things"
"i mean a just to show in mammals that we"
"can deal with all of the things that are"
"different you know the blood pressure"
"the the infection risk the more complex"
"uh you know um inflammatory response the"
"bigger uh the bigger diameter of the of"
"the of the of the limb itself you know"
"all of these things"
"have to be have to be dealt with um some"
"things will be easier you know humans"
"won't be chewing off the the biodome the"
"way the mice try to do so so"
"certain you know certain things will be"
"will be easier but but there's there's a"
"lot there's a lot that remains still but"
"you know we're on the way"
"yeah for sure and one thing that i"
"think's kind of intriguing about this"
"approach is as you sort of mentioned"
"it's the idea that we don't necessarily"
"need to fully understand the downstream"
"molecular details of exactly how it's"
"coordinating it we just have to like"
"intervene i guess at a higher level and"
"the reason that i think that's"
"interesting is because there's a lot of"
"i guess interest at the moment in terms"
"of like personalized genomic approaches"
"to healthcare and"
"i guess"
"um this approach at least at first"
"glance appears to be something that"
"might be more universal and maybe the"
"same set of treatments could be applied"
"more broadly and i guess do you think"
"that's the case or do you think there"
"would still be an element of like"
"personalization uh"
"to what like the drug combination could"
be
"there there is there is going to be an"
"element of personalization only because"
uh
"in particular with the bioelectric"
"treatments you're going to want to know"
"in your particular patient which"
"channels are expressed in the wound and"
"that may differ somewhat person to"
"person we'll find out but but you're"
"right fundamentally in that this is a"
"much more generic approach for the"
"following reason in any control"
"structure the further up you go"
"the less you have to worry about the"
"details because"
"the whole point of a hierarchical"
"control structure is that the details"
"are delegated so"
"if if you know if you tell seven"
"different people um you know uh go get"
"me a coffee they may do it completely"
"differently but and you don't but the"
"point is you don't need to"
"uh specify well you're gonna move your"
"right foot three inches this way then"
"you're gonna you don't need to do any of"
"that because you're dealing with"
"competent agents that know how to do"
"certain things and you don't have to"
"worry about your message is exactly the"
same
"even though in each person the molecular"
"details right of what they hear how they"
"carry it out what what chemicals go"
"where in their brain when they hear it"
"those are all different but but you're"
"up at a higher level and so"
"it's uh"
"addressing addressing these kinds of"
"things at higher levels has lots of"
advantages
um
"and one one of the advantages is that"
"by by by"
"taking advantage of the fact that you're"
"working with a competent material that"
"already knows how to do things"
"you can leave a lot of the details"
"uh up to the implementation so so you're"
"not going to"
"have to worry about which which channels"
"are open when you're going to set a set"
"of bioelectric states and"
"let let the system go from there that"
"that i think you know that that part is"
"going to be the same for everybody and"
"and then and then different very very"
"different things what will happen"
downstream
"yeah that makes sense um"
"and just one kind of last aspect whilst"
"we're talking about regeneration still"
"is um i'm contrasting that to the the"
"more wound healing and scarring approach"
"is that one of my interests is in i"
"guess the circadian rhythm and how there"
"seems to be some differences and i guess"
"like the downstream processes at"
"different times of the day and in"
"particular with wound healing i know"
"that there is like an emerging area of"
"research showing that depending on the"
"time of the day when the wound occurs"
"like the healing process can occur at"
"different speeds"
"and i was just wondering if you've"
"looked at all into any of the time of"
"day links with these regenerative"
approaches
"it's a fascinating question uh you're"
"right and and even for example now"
"they're finding that for chemotherapy it"
"uh it really depends when you get it"
"because because the cycling of the stem"
"cells and also the cancer cells is"
"related to uh the the time of day and so"
"on uh we don't we don't know very much"
"about it we're studying it there's a"
"there's a there's a postdoc in the group"
"who's studying time time keeping in the"
"context of a darpa project on on slowing"
"biological time for injury and stuff"
"like that and so so she's working on"
"this but we we don't know much about it"
"yet still early days okay cool well i"
"guess i'll look forward to seeing some"
"of that research imagine uh so i thought"
"next week should probably talk about"
"something that we've actually mentioned"
"a few times already which is this idea"
"about bioelectricity and so i was just"
"wondering if you could actually just"
"explain more generally what is meant by"
"this concept and how it differs to guess"
"what i initially studied which is like"
biochemistry
"yeah um"
"let's let's think of it this way i i"
"like to start like this one of the most"
"amazing parts of the most amazing aspect"
"of multicellularity is the ability of"
"cells to work together towards large"
"scale goals so what i mean by that is uh"
"if you have a salamander and you cut off"
"the arm the cells will work together to"
"rebuild the arm and then they stop how"
"do they know when to stop when do they"
"stop they stop when a correct salamander"
"arm is finished so what you can say is"
"not not because of magic but because of"
"cybernetics and and this this idea that"
"you know we understand now thermostats"
"and other things it's it's uh there are"
"certain devices are are able to minimize"
"error to some specification so what the"
"cells will do is they will continue to"
"to remodel and grow and do whatever"
"until the error the delta between the"
"current state and the target state is is"
"as small as possible right and that's"
"the same thing for regulative"
"development and the same thing for"
"metamorphosis and other types of"
"remodeling and so on"
"so if you're going to have a system"
where
"lots of subunits are working together on"
"a common goal that's much larger than"
"themselves so no individual cell knows"
"what a finger is or can measure the"
"length of the arm right individual"
"that's too big for an individual cell to"
"deal with but the collective absolutely"
"minimizes delta from having the right"
"number of fingers having an arm of the"
"right size of the right shape and so on"
"so if you're going to do that you need"
"two things uh you need a some mechanism"
"for coordinating the cells so binding"
"them together towards common purpose in"
"some fact some informational structure"
"and b you need to be able to store the"
"set point right so the reason your"
"thermostat works is because somewhere"
"there's a it stores what the right range"
"is and when the temperature gets too low"
"or too high it'll kick it but it'll"
"it'll take action to try and get back"
"into that range so the key those kind of"
"homeostatic processes only work when you"
"can store a set point now this is"
"already we've already left the realm of"
typical
"molecular biology you know sort of"
"paradigm because normally what you hear"
"is that well the genes get expressed"
"they sort of roll forward under rules of"
"chemistry and and and maybe some"
"biomechanics and and whatever you get"
"that's what you get it's emergence right"
"it's this idea of local simple rules and"
"then something wondrous emerges out at"
"the end but it's actually it's actually"
"not i mean and that's true that does"
"exist but in addition to that you have"
"these very interesting feedback loops"
"that are not just forward emergence they"
"they solve problems for example"
"if you have an animal that has too many"
"cells or too few cells or you intervene"
"in various ways much of the time it'll"
"still find some way to make the right"
"thing and i can tell you with some"
"amazing examples of this that are that"
"are just incredibly impressive"
"so um so so so what is the computational"
"medium that underlies all this and one"
"of the things that immediately strikes"
"people is weird about this way of"
"thinking about it is how how is a"
"collection of cells going to bind itself"
"to have a memory of what it's supposed"
"to do and cooperate as a kind of"
"collective intelligence right that just"
"sounds sounds implausible until you"
"remember that well we are all collected"
"you and i are collective intelligences"
"right we are a bag of neurons and in"
"some way those neurons work together to"
"produce a centralized being that has"
"memories goals preferences and these"
"kinds of things that don't belong to any"
"of the individual cells they belong to"
"the collective so so we already know"
"that does exist that that whole process"
"happens between your ears all the time"
"so now one might ask okay how does that"
"happen well"
"it seems that electrical networks seem"
"to make that possible right that's not"
"controversial that's what neuroscience"
studies
"so one can ask the next question which"
"is okay where did that come from did"
"brains did brain suddenly like evolved"
"this trick and it turns out that"
"all of the"
"mechanisms but also the algorithms for"
"doing that are way older than brains"
"they exist in our unicellular ancestors"
"they were evolved around the time of"
"bacterial biofilms and so evolution"
"noticed very long time ago that"
"electricity was a great way to store"
"information to make decisions to"
"coordinate information across spatial"
"distances to make computational networks"
"right bacteria already know this"
"so uh what we study in my group"
"is exactly that uh there's this basic"
"question of what did bodies think about"
before
"before they had brains they could think"
"about three-dimensional space so brains"
"are really good at thinking about clever"
"behavior in 3d space so controlling your"
"muscles to move you around in 3d space"
"and hopefully have some sort of"
"intelligence you know in the in the"
"behavior right before that that that's"
"an evolutionary pivot before that that"
"whole that exact same system electrical"
"networks of cells"
"were used to store information and"
"navigate through a space but it wasn't"
"three-dimensional space it was more for"
"space it was the space of anatomical"
"configurations so whereas now the"
"collective intelligence of your neurons"
"in your brain moves you through 3d space"
"before that same trick was used to move"
"the collective intelligence of embryonic"
"cells through morphospace through"
"anatomical space and before that it was"
"used to move individual cells through um"
"physiological space and before that"
"probably metabolic space that's most"
"likely how it went and so so evolution's"
"just reusing the same amazing trick and"
"bioelectricity is really great at this"
"so so basically"
"almost everything that we know about"
"neuroscience holds outside of the"
"nervous system it's not in in fact in"
"fact none of the one of the reasons why"
"we've made progress is that the tools of"
"neuroscience don't distinguish neurons"
"from non-neural cells they can't tell"
"the difference they work in every cell"
"and so that that tells us something very"
"important about this this distinction we"
"have between neuroscience and and and"
"other fields it's it's a man-made"
"distinction nature doesn't doesn't"
"support that so"
"all these other cells what they're doing"
"is they use the same tricks they have"
"ion channels so they form a voltage"
"gradient across the membrane"
"uh they have gap junctions which are"
"electrical synapses these are precursors"
"of modern um"
"chemical synapses they have"
"neurotransmitter neurotransmitter"
"machinery and neurotransmitters move"
"under the this electromotive force and"
"so on um"
"and so uh yeah and so this so this uh uh"
"what we've been studying is we we"
"developed tools basically appropriated"
"tools from from from neuroscience and"
"applied those tools and concepts"
to
"ask to read and write this electrical"
"information in morphogenesis to ask what"
"does the collective intelligence uh what"
"does it measure what does it remember"
"how does it bind together and can we"
"rewrite it and the answer is yes we can"
"we actually rewrite this information now"
"yeah i was extremely interesting and"
like
"i think you're right i mean you can"
"really look back and look at bacteria"
"and i was gonna mention like"
"mitochondria as well and healthy the"
"what i learned from teaching the"
"students is how we have the proton"
"pumping that drives i guess atp"
synthesis
"and so i know as well like neural"
"signaling which is kind of like the"
"canonical introduction to"
"electrochemical signaling or electrical"
"signaling but then um the body and how"
"you have potassium and sodium moving as"
"well as calcium i guess and so what are"
"like the major"
um
"like i guess components that have this"
"charge that are moving across the"
channels
"yeah it depends it depends on the cells"
"and the tissues and the species but"
"basically all of the ions chloride"
"you know"
"protons uh potassium and sodium all of"
"these things move across the across the"
"membrane and they establish a voltage"
"gradient and it's the it's the spatial"
"pattern of voltage gradients that is"
"interpreted by the cells as as"
"information and it and it almost doesn't"
"matter in fact most of the cases that we"
"look at it doesn't matter what ions were"
"used to get there right and that's"
"something we do in in all of our papers"
"is we show you can get the exact same"
"effect by altering potassium sodium"
"chloride protons as long as you get the"
"moving in the right direction so that"
"you get the voltage change that you"
"wanted right you have to calculate that"
"out which how do i what are the"
"different ways i can get the voltage"
"change and again it gets back to this"
"idea that we just talked about about a"
"high level control so voltage"
"is a voltage is a macrostate right it's"
"like it's it's it's you you get to a"
"certain voltage by many different"
"combinations of sodium potassium"
"concentrations so it's not it's not that"
"oh this particular ion channel gene and"
"this particular level of sodium is what"
"caused my morphogenetic event it's the"
"voltage state that caused your event and"
"many different microstates are"
"compatible with that it's like"
"temperature right it's like you know"
"boyle's law you're talking about a"
"boiler you've got you've got this notion"
"of temperature or pressure and there's"
"many many different microstates"
"underneath that but you don't care"
"because because of to control that that"
"that you know that that um uh that that"
"device you"
"the the operant variable is is"
"temperature or pressure"
"i see so okay see so in terms of like"
"how you would study this in the lab like"
"what kind of like approaches can you"
"used to identify"
"the different voltages and do you feel"
"like um the tools have improved over the"
"last decade or so and it's making it"
"easier to do these kind of experiments"
now
"yeah yeah the tools uh the tools are"
"getting better um what we use so so so"
"here are here are the things we use uh"
"to read the voltages we use"
"voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes there"
"are there are also genetically encoded"
"reporters which are improving all the"
"time people are making these um you know"
"variants of gfp and other things that"
"that fluoresce differentially based on"
"the voltage"
um
"and then and then of course you have the"
"dies they're getting better there's"
"there's tons of room for improvement"
"though so one of my one of my real goals"
"is to work with chemists to make better"
"better dies so that we have better maps"
"of voltage"
"one of the reasons that bioelectricity"
"has lagged for years behind biochemistry"
"and genetics is that you can you can"
"kill a cell fix it with alcohol or"
"formaldehyde take out the the the gene"
"the genetic take out the genetic"
"material take out the proteins the rna"
"and isolate them and study them and"
"that's great the all the bioelectrics"
"disappear the moment the cell is dead"
"right you can't you can't do any of that"
"you have to study it in a living state"
"which means that all of this this this"
"molecular bioelectricity um which which"
"of course rests on many decades of work"
"by by uh you know sort of the"
"forefathers of this field which used"
"electrodes and other things but but the"
"molecular bioelectricity um"
"it it's only possible now that we have"
"these in vivo these amazing uh you know"
"fluorescent and other techniques where"
"you can do this stuff in vivo so so the"
"key techniques are of course tracking"
"the voltage but then the other the other"
"thing you really want is the functional"
"experiment you want to rewrite the"
"voltage so the way you do that is so so"
"really important no electrodes no fields"
"no waves no magnets no electromagnetic"
"radiation none of that"
"what we're doing is"
"molecular physiology so specifically"
"opening and closing ion channels and gap"
"junctions now that might be with"
"pharmacology it might be by mutating"
"them it might be by introducing new"
"channels or knocking down channels or um"
"using optogenetics for example we could"
"we we've we've shown that you can use"
"light gated channels to to control quite"
"precisely um that's yeah those are those"
"kind of tools"
"i see yeah and um you really sort of"
"mentioned what i was going to ask you"
"next which is about how"
"a lot of the iron movement is regulated"
"by different channel proteins and at"
"least from what i remember from"
"undergrads things like i guess gpcr's"
"although i'm not entirely sure how many"
"of them are like iron uh channel"
"regulators but a lot of the membrane"
"proteins are quite druggable like"
"they're on the surface they're easier to"
"target it's free i guess a variety of"
"different means so i guess that's yeah i"
"guess that's a good thing for developing"
"yeah therapeutics"
"yeah yeah absolutely i mean you can"
"think of these these ion channels on the"
"surface of tissues are the interface"
"that this hardware is exposing to you as"
"a as a bioengineer or a regenerative"
"medicine worker to control the system"
"and luckily yeah some something like i"
"think i think i read like 20 of all"
"drugs are ion channel drugs and so it's"
"a very uh you know a very good way to uh"
"with with great specificity the thing is"
"of course that"
"like with any interface"
the
"downstream effects of specific"
"perturbations are complex so you don't"
"know exactly what's going to happen"
"until you've understood the electric"
"circuit and modeled it so you might for"
"example shut down a particular potassium"
"channel well there may be seven other"
"potassium channels that will open and"
"close in in to compensate for that"
"because the cell is fighting you on on"
"on in your attempts to change the"
"voltage so it's a it's a much different"
"it isn't like um you know i'm gonna"
"knock down this transcription factor and"
"that's it now now it's now it's gone and"
"now whatever genes it was supposed to"
"turn on now now they're off it's it"
"isn't like that it's a it's very much"
"you know it's interacting with a complex"
"computational device and giving it"
"inputs and and the key is which we've"
"tried to develop is to have"
a
"a computational model that predicts"
"what's going to happen and that you can"
"invert so that you can say okay but i"
"want this to happen so now which"
"channels do i open and close"
"yeah i guess yeah that is really is a"
"challenge and in terms of like thinking"
about
"applying it in fevo in terms of the"
"different cell types and how you have"
"like stem cells you have cancerous cells"
"and i guess what i study is semester"
"cells like i mean i guess i can look at"
"the gene expression changes and i can"
"see that there are differences in the"
"internal expression"
"and so can you therefore use"
"like the voltage of a cell to be able to"
"identify like"
"for example a senescent cell was that"
"potentially possible"
"yeah yeah so so"
"so what what you what you uh"
"what you can get and and by the way"
"tons of physiomic still needs to be done"
"okay so so we don't so for example"
"senescent cells i have no idea if"
"senescent cells have a different profile"
"than normal cells however what you can"
"definitely tell"
is
"uh stem cells embryonic cells and tumor"
"cells tend to be quite depolarized"
"terminally differentiated adult normal"
"you know somatic cells tend to be"
"hyperpolarized now"
"that's fine and that can be useful for"
"example we have a cancer diagnostics"
"kind of application where you can use"
"that to look for a signature of"
"pre-cancer right look for depolarized"
"cells but i want to be i want to be very"
"clear in fact in fact so so i have this"
"beautiful diagram which shows voltage"
"from you know minus 80 all the way to"
"zero and it shows all the cancer cells"
"cluster down here and the stem cells are"
"down here and the you know normal cells"
"up here people people love to see that"
"diagram i've stopped showing it in talks"
"because because people focus on that and"
"it sounds like a neat story and it is"
"but the problem is that's a single cell"
"story and this is not fun none of this"
"is fundamentally a single cell"
"phenomenon so i don't want people to be"
"thinking about ah"
"this cell has a particular voltage"
"therefore it's this type of cell"
"therefore problem solved all of the big"
"problems in this field are not about"
"single cells"
"having their own voltage it's about"
"large groups of cells reading the"
"voltage of themselves and other groups"
"of cells it's a network phenomenon so"
"zooming into individual cells i mean"
"there's certainly applications for that"
"but i don't think that's fundamentally"
"what the bioelectric system is about it"
"isn't about single cell states it's"
"about anatomical decisions"
"yeah i see and i guess as kind of on"
"from that"
"at least with like neuronal signaling i"
"guess if you looked at the photoshop"
"ferries right it gets hyper polarized"
"and it depolarizes and so it's not just"
"necessarily about looking at the i guess"
"the average um voltage but i guess there"
"might be fluctuations in the the"
"frequency in which they change or like"
"like the i don't know the dynamics of"
"the voltage"
"yeah i think i think the nervous system"
"uses uh temporal encoding more than than"
"other cells do we don't know quite"
"frankly we haven't really dug deeply"
"enough into"
"the temporal uh properties of other"
"cells but i if from what we know right"
"now if i had to guess i would say that"
"the majority of your body tissues use"
"spatial encoding so spatial differences"
"in resting potential whereas the brain"
"really likes uh that kind of spiking"
"temporal encoding but i'm sure the it"
"bleeds over in both directions you know"
"okay that's cool i said kind of keeping"
"with i guess bioelectricity still um"
"there was a really cool study that came"
"from out from your lab that"
"was with planarians and he put them in"
"barium solution which i believe is like"
"a non-specific inhibitor of some iron"
"channel and what that did was it"
"prevented them forming their heads or"
"something and so you left them in the"
"solution and then over time they"
"got this ability to actually make their"
"heads again and i don't know if i"
"completely bluffed your article but i"
"was wondering if you could explain that"
"in a bit more detail"
"sure sure so okay so so the basic"
"observation was this you take you you're"
"absolutely right barium is a"
"non-specific potassium channel blocker"
"so you take your worms you put them in a"
"barium solution and uh overnight their"
"heads explode i mean their heads"
"literally it's called head t progression"
"that has"
"just because because there are all these"
"neurons in there and they can't handle"
"not being able to exchange potassium so"
"there's massive cytotoxicity the cells"
die
"so you got this you got this back half"
"of the worm and"
"you leave it in the barium"
"and what you find out is that after a"
"couple of weeks"
"they regenerate a new head"
"perfectly and the new head doesn't care"
"at all about the barium no problem and"
"so you ask yourself well how is this"
"possible how are these heads of now"
"surviving barium right so we did we did"
"a very simple-minded experiment and it"
"was sort of"
"it it it's clearly not the only thing to"
"do because no one said that the"
"difference has to be transcriptional but"
"the we the tool was there so we did it"
"we basically just did um next-gen"
"sequencing and did a transcriptomic"
"analysis of what makes and just"
"subtracted like what makes the barium"
"adapted heads different from normal"
heads
yeah
"just transcriptionally what makes them"
"different yeah and uh and what we found"
"is that there's only a handful of"
"there's only a handful of genes that"
"that that enable them to be barium"
"adapted so now the important thing about"
"all of this is is is this think think"
"about this"
"planaria never see barium in the wild"
"there's never been evolutionary pressure"
"to deal with barium so it's complete"
"because because i don't see barium in"
"the wild so so it's unlikely"
that
"they have a an evolved response of"
"here's what we do when when we're hit"
"with barium instead think of the problem"
"that these cells have to solve you have"
"tens of thousands of genes it's a little"
"like i always imagined it being in the"
"middle of a nuclear reactor control room"
"and the things melting down and you"
"don't know"
"what you know you what you don't have"
"time to do because planarian cells don't"
"turn over the way bacteria might you"
"don't have cells you don't have time to"
"just try combinations you don't have"
"time for gradient descent or just"
"randomly flipping with you know genes up"
"and down"
"you don't have time for that uh somehow"
"you have to figure out which of my"
"transcriptional uh effectors of my my"
"transcriptional actions that i can take"
"are going to resolve this completely"
"novel physiological stressor"
"that's a really interesting problem"
"anywhere in any other space we would be"
"calling it intelligence right if you if"
"you had a device that was uh"
"that was designed to to solve certain"
"kinds of problems and you gave it a"
"novel problem and then figure out how to"
"solve it using the tools that it had you"
"would say well that's a that's a cool"
"example of intelli i mean that's what"
"intelligence is right it's using what"
"you know to solve new problems"
um
"it's yeah it's an amazing thing and and"
"we don't really know how it works i mean"
"i have a i have an idea but but we don't"
"really know how it works and i think"
"this is just the tip of the iceberg i"
"think cells are incredibly good at"
"dealing with cells and cellular"
"collectives because of that multi-scale"
"competency architecture they have a"
"really um remarkable ability to to deal"
"with novelty"
"thank you yeah thank you for explaining"
"that in a bit more detail and i think as"
"well in that study um you then put them"
"back into water"
"and then back into barium and then they"
"had lost the ability and so um what does"
"that tell us about the memory of the"
"system is the memory expensive and so"
"maybe as you say they're not used to"
"bury them then they were like well"
"i don't know how to explain it but they"
"were like it's not adaptive to waste"
"this energy storing some memory of this"
"offense if it's unlikely to happen again"
"that's yeah that's entirely possible"
"that's one way to think about it another"
"way to think about it is imagine"
"transcriptional space which is obvious"
"hi it's it's a very high dimensional"
"space so it's impossible for us to"
"visualize it but but imagine"
"transcriptional space in that space"
"there's going to be an attractor that is"
"the standard"
"um normal planarian way to have your"
"genes expressed and then there's going"
"to be another attractor a small one"
"that's works really well when you've"
"been challenged by barium so i think"
"that uh staying in that in that other"
"attractor is probably you know when"
"you're challenged you sort of wander"
"around and find that space and then you"
"can regrow your head and life is good"
"but it may be that either it's expensive"
"as you say energetically expensive or"
"it's just that dynamically that"
"attractor is kind of shallow and it's"
"really easy to sort of fall out of it"
"and if you fall out of it you probably"
"go back to the big one right so you can"
"imagine like this big you know this big"
"bowl and next to it there's like a"
"little bowl and you're sitting in the"
"little bowl and then you know everything"
"is a little bit shaking and and so"
"chances are eventually you're gonna"
"unless there's pressure for you to stay"
"there you're probably gonna eventually"
"end up in the big standard tractor so"
"that's that's another way to think about"
"that to really understand this is going"
"to have to wait until um"
"we're going to we're going to do a"
"single cell rna-seq and"
"just track the path of each animal in"
"through that space to actually find out"
"how they how you know how they find the"
"right region of of transcriptional space"
"okay that's super cool and i think it"
"was also speaking of memory and"
"planarians um there was a study you did"
"as well where you again perhaps the"
"electrical network and you basically"
"made the plumerians have two heads and"
"this time every time they kind of like"
"i'm not entirely sure how they replicate"
"actually but um they capped the person"
"of two heads and stuff like they had"
"somehow created this memory and do you"
"have any idea like"
"you know where is this memory being"
"stored because the the dna is exactly"
"the same"
"yeah yeah we can we can see it it's uh"
"it's stored it's stored there's an"
"electrical circuit that um is uh"
"my it's you can think about it as um as"
"a piece of uh as a piece of uh ram it's"
"basically a piece of electrically active"
"memory you can we can see that we can"
"literally see the memory with this"
"voltage die you can see where it says"
"one head and you can see how to change"
"it to make it say two heads and when you"
"do that the cells when they are injured"
"the cells will consult the memory they"
"say ah"
"i guess a good planarian has two heads"
"and i'll build two heads and that the"
"the amazing thing about that circuit is"
that
"it uh it keeps the memory and it also"
"there's a there's another there's"
"another tricky part of this which is"
"which is uh this kind of uh planar"
"polarity of the cell so there's a"
"there's a"
"there's a a feedback between the"
"bioelectrics which is kind of like the"
"short-term memory and then cytoskeleton"
"organization in the cells which which"
"maybe you can think about as kind of a"
"longer-term memory so both of those are"
"affected and uh yeah and and"
"and as a result"
"you have these uh you have these tissues"
"that just persist in this in this"
"pattern you can set it back we can take"
"a two headed warm and make you set it"
"back to one headed but in the meantime"
"the the memory the memory holds"
"basically and you can do you can you can"
"do another interesting trick with it"
"which is you cut you cut off their heads"
"and then you um prevent the cells from"
"communicating electrically so you block"
"the gap junctions basically with general"
"anaesthetic it's the same thing that"
"general anesthesia does"
and
"when you do that when you then so 48"
"hours of that you pull them out"
"and they will regain that electrolyte"
"electrical network will regain an"
attractor
but
"it doesn't always find the right one and"
"so when that happens it lands in a"
"different one that belongs to a"
"different species so you will get"
"planaria with heads that belong to"
"different species so so instead of the"
"nice triangular head you'll get flat"
"ones round ones"
"ones that belong to other species"
"including the shape of the brain the"
"distribution of stem cells everything"
"becomes like these other species"
"and uh yeah even though as you say even"
"though the the genetics is not edited"
"yeah that's incredible and and so what"
"does this electrical memory then tell us"
"about like how"
"in our brains we record memories does"
"that provide any insight at all"
"yeah i think i think i think you're on"
"to something very important um i do"
"think that um"
"understanding how this works is going to"
"do a lot of good for neuroscience"
"because in neuroscience there's a"
"problem you know most people study"
"memory let's say in synaptic um you know"
"synaptic structures and synaptic"
"plasticity that whole story of memories"
"being stored in synaptic specific"
"synaptic structures is kind of"
"unraveling there's a lot of reasons why"
"that's probably wrong at this point and"
um
"i think that i think that trying to"
"understand uh"
how
"other kinds of memories are stored such"
"as morphological memories and so on"
"might actually put us on to the right"
"thing and i actually suspect and this is"
"a total um conjecture at this point from"
"for me but uh i suspect that actually"
"cytoskeleton is going to be a really key"
"part of this and my guess is this is"
"just again"
"my my own guess is that neural networks"
"are not there to store memories they're"
"there to interpret um engrams that are"
"probably cytoskeletal in in in nature so"
"i actually think that the the real"
"medium of storing them is going to be"
"some some biochemical structure probably"
"cytoskeleton maybe something else and"
"what the neural nets do is is interpret"
"it and reconstruct reconstruct memories"
"on the fly by reading these these"
"chemical cues as opposed to trying to"
"store them"
"well yeah but that's super fascinating"
"in fact like i think i maybe did come"
"across a review article like a euro"
"sergey that had a similar kind of like"
"idea so this is definitely something"
"that i'm like interested in just reading"
"about them myself anyway so that's super"
cool
"um i guess like yeah speaking more about"
um
"memory and just like intelligence in"
"general um and how like intelligence can"
"be seen i guess like at different levels"
"um and how you don't have to have like a"
"brain and a"
"multicellularity to have intelligence"
"because you had an interesting study"
"that came out a couple of years ago"
"maybe uh where you have something called"
"sunnybots but you just took some"
"some cells and you uh"
"i mean you're probably going to explain"
"it better than i can but you were able"
to
"sort of get it to do different behaviors"
"and show forms of intelligence and i was"
"wondering if you could explain a bit"
"better than i have about that"
"yeah so so there's two there's two"
"interesting pieces there um"
"one one piece it has to do with"
"intelligence and then and then uh more"
"broadly and then i'll talk about the"
"xenobots um i wanna i wanna start with"
"the intelligence part because i i"
"haven't specifically made any claims"
about
"what kind of intelligence the zenobots"
"have that's still very much under"
"investigation but i want to i want to"
"say something about intelligence first"
um
"to me here's here's a proposed and there"
"are many but here's a proposed"
"definition of intelligence and i i"
"intelligence i think is uh i like"
"william james's intelligence definition"
"of intelligence which is the ability to"
"get to the same goal by different means"
"so i think that's very powerful and well"
"i would put two twists on that i would"
"say one is yes and that goal can be"
"stated in many different problem spaces"
"it's not just physical space but it"
"might be morphospace it might be"
"transcriptional space it might be um you"
"know linguistic space in the case of of"
"advanced humans and whatnot uh"
"transcript transcriptional space"
"physiological space and your degree of"
"intelligence is"
"the competency with which you pursue the"
"goals that you pursue and your"
"sort of cognitive sophistication is the"
"size of the goals you're able to pursue"
"literally this the size in that space so"
"if you can only if if what stresses you"
"out is being far from your goal of"
"having the right local sugar"
"concentration you're probably a"
bacterium
if
"what if if on the other hand you're able"
"to pursue a goal about the size of a"
"human arm you're probably a collection"
"of cells making an arm if your goal is"
um
"you know a particular quality of the"
"earth's financial markets and and you"
"know peace among men you're probably a"
"human that you can con you can even work"
"towards you can represent a goal of that"
"size right maybe maybe one that's not"
"going to be done in your lifetime and"
"that's an amazing thing that humans can"
"do so so so i have a very uh functional"
"generic view of intelligence"
"i don't think it matters what you're"
"made of how you got here being involved"
"design i don't think any of that matters"
"what matters is are you a system that"
"uh can pursue different types of"
"different scales of goals and how how"
"competently do you pursue them to get"
"caught in local"
"minima do you have um any kind of uh"
"delayed gratification so you can go"
"around boundaries to get where you need"
"to be that kind of stuff"
"so the reason that the reason that i"
"think it's important to do that is"
"people people often have these binary"
"categories which i think are completely"
"false and and really hold back progress"
"people will say things like"
"i and maybe some apes and maybe my dog"
"and maybe an octopus and people fight"
"about that uh"
"we are true intelligences this other"
"stuff well that's just physics that's"
"just a metaphor i mean i can see the"
"mechanisms you know the eplysia has this"
"and that mechanism for you know"
"habituation and that's just chemistry"
"and physics i have real intelligence"
"this is of course uh impossible now that"
"we we know about evolution and"
"developmental biology we know that each"
"of us took a very smooth journey from"
"being a pile of chemical reactions in an"
"oocyte in an unfertilized oocyte all the"
"way up to being a human that's going to"
"make claims about second order cognition"
"and your true intelligence whatever else"
"you've got every step along the way was"
"nice and smooth it was very slow there"
"was never a lightning bolt that said"
"boom today you're you're a cognitive"
"being yesterday you were you were a pi"
"you were just physics much like in in"
"evolution that never happened you can"
"all you can also start to roll back and"
"ask yourself whatever it is that you"
"think you have you know moral"
"culpability and whatever well how about"
"your ancestors of two hundred thousand"
"years ago did they have it how about"
"four thousand a hundred thousand years"
"ago right well how about like there's"
"never a set of parents that were just"
"you know sort of whatever and then their"
"offspring bang the offspring is now"
"cognitive right that never happened so"
"we have to we have to have this gradual"
"view of of intelligence and we have to"
"be able to"
"recognize intelligence and"
"unconventional embodiments we're"
"terrible at that we're we're only good"
"because all our sense organs point out"
"we're we're only good at recognizing"
"intelligence in medium-sized objects"
"moving at medium speeds in"
"three-dimensional space then we're good"
"we can see you know the the monkeys"
"hiding the you know the thing of waters"
"and ah that's that's pretty smart and so"
"okay but but if you had access to your"
"blood like like if you had in in"
"if you had conscious awareness of the"
"the blood chemistry of your body at any"
"given point and you knew what your what"
"your liver was doing at any point in"
"time you would be able to recognize that"
"that organ as being very intelligent in"
"physiological space you would just be"
"able to that would be natural to you if"
"we had senses like that which we don't"
"so um"
"so so so i'm always interested in in"
"problem solving and intelligence in"
"weird unfamiliar spaces so now let's get"
"to the to the xenobot business um much"
like
uh
"let's just warm up for a second with it"
"with this with this example um"
"imagine uh newts newts have uh these"
"these little kidney tubules that lead"
"that lead to their kidneys they are"
"normally made from eight to ten cells in"
"a if you take a cross section through"
"the through the tubule eight to ten"
"cells make this circle and inside"
"there's a lumen and that's your two bill"
"right what you can do is you can you can"
"make polyploid newts that have more and"
"more ends you know it's four n six and"
"eight and and as you do that the cell"
"size gets bigger and bigger"
"so the first thing that's already"
"amazing is wait a minute with with with"
"extra copies of all the genetic material"
"and you still make a normal newt that's"
"wild but okay that's one thing that the"
"the you know uh"
"the the software can make up for like"
"additional copies of every of every"
"piece of information that's amazing gets"
"better than that"
"uh the newts are the same size so that"
"means that fewer and fewer cells have to"
"be used to make the same tubule because"
"the cells are bigger right so if you"
"have something that's made of you know"
"10 legos and the legos are now bigger"
"you have to use fewer of them to get the"
"same thing so that's kind of amazing"
"we're now this isn't just response to"
"injury or response to environment"
"your own parts are changing and you can"
"make up for that that's amazing the most"
"amazing part is that if you make the"
"cells truly gigantic such that only one"
"cell fits what happens is one cell wraps"
"around itself"
"leaving a lumen in the middle"
"and you get your you get your your"
"normal sized lumen with a completely"
"different molecular mechanism so instead"
"of cell to cell communication that"
"builds a normal tubule now you have some"
"sort of i don't know cytoskeletal"
"bending that that drags a single cell"
"around in a loop like that so what that"
"tells you is"
"incredible problem solving on the part"
"of this collective intelligence despite"
"the changes in your very own parts"
"you can call up different molecular"
components
to
"serve the same large-scale anatomical"
"need it's a nice example of top-down"
"causation actually because it's the it's"
"the anatomy that drives the molecular"
"biology in this case"
"so um so that's just an example of of of"
"cells you know it's kind of like uh i"
"often in my in my own head i call it"
"play the hand you're dealt like whatever"
"you've got you're going to figure out"
"some way of making the best of it right"
"it's an amazing capacity so we wanted to"
"ask a simple question uh about cells in"
"terms of their plasticity and in terms"
"of their um"
"ability to handle novelty and we said"
"this imag imagine this you look at an"
"embryo and you look at the skin and you"
"say what do these skin cells naturally"
"want to do what do they naturally do and"
"you might say well they naturally want"
"to be this two dimensional layer on the"
"outside of the animal and keep out the"
"bacteria it's pretty boring but that's"
"probably what they naturally want to do"
"well that's not what they naturally want"
"to do because"
"if you take those cells out of that"
context
"and leave them on their own in a little"
"pile uh"
"liberate them from the instructive"
"interactions with the from the rest of"
"the of the cells"
"then you get to find out what they"
"actually want to do when nobody's"
"bullying them into being the skin layer"
"when what they actually want to do is"
"well they could have done many things"
"they could have crawled apart from each"
"other they could have died as some cells"
"do when they're alone they could have um"
"made a flat monolayer like a cell"
"culture instead what they do is they"
"come together they form this little this"
"little ball"
"and this by the way was all was all"
"joint work with um josh bongard's lab uh"
"they formed this little ball uh the"
"little the the cilia these these these"
"moving hairs that they have on their"
"surface that you normally they're used"
"to spread the um the mucus down the the"
"body of the frog they use those cells to"
"row the the cilia they use them to row"
"against the water and that thing starts"
"moving around on its own so what what"
"can they do they can do mazes they can"
"um they can navigate all kinds of all"
"kinds of shapes they can uh regenerate"
damage
"they can"
"the most amazing thing they can do is um"
"if you if you if you sprinkle a bunch of"
"loose cells in their environment they"
"will go around and they will collect"
"those cells into little piles like like"
"bulldozers they'll sort of bulldoze them"
"into little piles guess what those piles"
"do those piles become the next"
"generation of xenobots they start"
"zipping around doing the exact same"
"thing and on and on it goes that's"
"kinematic self-replication right um it's"
"kind of von neumann's dream of a machine"
"that that builds itself out of loose"
"parts that it finds in the environment"
"so the amazing so so again so here's"
"what i think is amazing about and"
"there's all kinds of practical"
"applications of this that we can talk"
"about but but more interesting than that"
"i think"
"is this"
"there's never been selection to be a"
"good xenobot"
"where does the zenobot"
"body plan and behavior come from because"
"normally when you look at a creature and"
"you ask why is it a certain shape a"
"certain color why does it have behaviors"
"it's easy you say oh a selection because"
"it had a certain environment and"
"everything that didn't fit that"
"environment is dead so that's why it has"
it
"there's never been the xenobots there's"
"never been selection to be a good"
"xenobot why do these cells know how to"
"do this where does that come from"
"so it's it's uh you know one of the one"
"of the things that we've pushed is this"
"idea that this is a new"
"robotics and engineering platform not"
"only does it tell us something"
"interesting about the problem solving of"
"these cells like okay now you're in a"
"different environment you're missing all"
"the other cells that you're supposed to"
"have you can't reproduce in the normal"
"froggy fashion how are you going to do"
"it they figure out a new way to do it"
"so there's all that plasticity basal"
"cognition is all that but it's also a"
"new way of bioengineering because unlike"
"normal engineering where you're working"
"with passive materials where you have to"
"micromanage everything you have wood and"
"and copper and whatever else you have to"
"make sure that that whatever you want to"
"happen is going to happen"
"this isn't like that this is a an"
"agential material the the cells have"
"agendas they know how to do things and"
"they want to do things and the only way"
"you're going to get this material to do"
"something different is by providing"
"appropriate inputs stimuli rewards and"
"punishments incentives you know"
"attractors attraction molecules whatever"
"you're going to give them you're not"
"micromanaging it you're it's like it's"
"like um"
"you know it's like building a tower out"
"of out of cats instead of bricks it's a"
"completely different strategy right"
"instead of instead of putting them where"
"you want that doesn't work with cats you"
"have to do rewards and punishments so"
"that you can you know sort of train them"
"to do these circus tricks"
so
uh
"that's you know we we"
"we create the the first generation of"
"zenobots by manipulating the signals the"
"environment that that the cells get they"
"do the exact same thing to the next"
"generation the only reason this this"
"reproduction works is because they're"
"dealing with an agent material right"
"this wouldn't work with passive cells"
"nothing would happen it works because"
"the cells they're working with already"
"all want to do this too"
"and i think the other powerful thing"
"about this is i think evolution does"
"exactly the same thing i think evolution"
"is is was mainly works by providing"
"because because because the material"
"that evolution works with is is is"
"already an agential material it's not"
"starting from scratch every single time"
"so so what evolution does is it searches"
"the space of the signals the rewards the"
"whatever you have to give these cells to"
"get them to do certain things like hey"
"you're going to be in a two-dimensional"
"layer on the outside of the okay tackle"
"so i think i think it's in it these"
"these um these zenobots"
"aside from all the practical stuff they"
"provide a new window on on problem"
"solving and origin of body plans on"
evolution
"on uh on engineering on the idea that"
"you know evolution"
"maybe doesn't build solution doesn't"
"discover solutions to specific problems"
"like here's a frog"
"what does the frog genome actually know"
"well it knows how to survive as a frog"
"but apparently it also knows how to be a"
"zenobot who knows what else it can do so"
"right so so evolution makes"
"problem-solving machines it doesn't find"
"specific solutions"
"and that"
"is interesting because it doesn't sit"
"really well with this traditional"
"picture of evolution as blind and"
"short-sighted the idea is normally right"
"evolution is supposed to always take the"
"short-term payoff"
"and it's supposed to be blind and"
"whatever works now that's what it takes"
"that's were true if that were true"
"why do we have these things that are so"
"good at solving scenarios that never"
"came up before it's almost you know it i"
"mean engineers do this because they have"
"foresight right because you try to make"
"it a a"
"you know an autonomous vehicle or a"
"robot or something that's going to"
"handle multiple things in the future"
"evolution's not really supposed to do"
"that so i think there are many you know"
"many deep questions here"
"no for sure like i i"
"yeah i feel like we can talk all night"
"about this and it's like fascinating"
"stuff and so like"
"yeah i guess um i mean i had some"
"questions about the intelligence which"
"you mentioned uh prior to this but i"
"guess we can stay with the center box"
"for now and like"
"yeah i mean i guess in theory then could"
"you do the same thing with human skin"
"cells and all different um potential"
uh
"yeah tissue cells and then"
"um what are the kind of potential"
"applications i guess in therapeutics but"
"beyond that as well with using this new"
"way of thinking"
"yeah yeah we're"
"you know i can't give any details"
"because it's not peer-reviewed yet and"
"everything but but i can we we're"
"definitely doing it with other cell"
"types it's not anything to do with with"
"amphibians it's not anything to do with"
"being an embryo it's a much more it's a"
"much more generic much more generic"
"phenomenon um the applications"
"come in a couple of different flavors"
"one set of applications is"
"useful synthetic living machines so"
"once we get better control and and"
"people people have already said well why"
"aren't you you know engineering them and"
"you can put synthetic biology circuits"
"in and out of course we can and we're"
"going to but the first three and there's"
"a couple more coming the first few"
"papers about this are all native because"
"because i don't want to this to be well"
"well look he put some kind of circuit in"
"it and now it does xyz and the point the"
"point is look at what these cells"
"already know how to do with a wild-type"
"genome right that's that's the point and"
"but but then of course after that you"
"program them so once you start once you"
"can once you can program them with"
various
"signals and stimuli and and maybe we put"
"in some some some circuits and whatnot"
"by electrics of course um"
"then you can imagine useful machines you"
"could imagine them uh you know they're"
"cleaning up the you know oceans they're"
um
"uh searching for for rare maybe toxic"
"molecules they're doing sensing rescue"
"exploration uh micro sculpting organs"
"for transplantation you know hydroponics"
"you can imagine a million different a"
"million different applications then you"
"can imagine applications in the body"
"right so so cleaning up arthritic knee"
"joints chasing down cancer cells or"
"bacteria in the in the gut uh you know"
"fusing retinas back to you know where"
"they belong all that kind of stuff"
"down you know someday someday in the"
"future but i think that that's only the"
"first level the second level is"
"can we use these"
"bots as a discovery platform to learn"
"the rules of morphogenesis you see one"
"of the things we're not very good at in"
"fact we're really bad at is"
"understanding the scaling of goals so"
"when you make a collective intelligence"
"system be it"
"swarm robotics or a group of cells or"
"some kind of social or financial"
"structure whatever it is what is the"
"collective going to want"
"what are the goals of a collective"
"they're not linear functions of the"
"goals of the pieces that's for sure and"
"so we're not very good at predicting"
"those we're not getting good at"
"recognizing them we're not very good at"
"predicting them and we're not no good at"
"controlling them"
"so can we use these zenobots and those"
"kind of platforms"
"as an agential material in which we can"
"practice this new science of"
"understanding the scaling of goals and"
"then and if you can do that"
"then for example in biomedicine you"
"could if you could"
"if we get good at telling the zen about"
"cells what to do in terms of make a you"
"know make a you know make a little make"
"a shape that looks like a little house"
"or something right just"
"just generic control over growth and"
"form then we'll be able to do that in"
"vivo for birth defects traumatic injury"
"um aging degenerative disease cancer"
"having nothing to do with the bots"
"themselves we'll be able to control what"
"other cells build that that i think is"
"is kind of the next level of"
"applications and and then of course the"
"third level which is sort of you know"
"the most the most kind of philosophical"
"of all is"
"is is to use them as a platform to"
"really dissolve a lot of our um"
"you know a lot a lot of our binary"
"categories that don't really exist but"
"but we always thought they did because"
"of of kind of failure of technology and"
"imagination we thought that there was a"
"difference between machine and organism"
"right people say that every every year"
"somebody publishes a paper saying living"
"things are not machines and and and and"
"you know and so they have these binary"
"categories that are that just did you"
"just set up a bunch of pseudo problems"
that
"are not compatible with the modern uh"
"capabilities of of biology"
"yeah there's honestly"
"super fascinating and i think just to go"
"on from the applications of like the"
"sunny box or i guess like other"
"potential uh tissue type equivalence"
"um if they are as you say like we don't"
"fully understand this morphological"
"space and so if you're putting them in"
"like for therapeutic cues going into the"
body
"and then inside the body there's like"
"different environments and different"
"places and like"
"how like would it not older than"
"like what that sunnybot is doing like i"
"mean it's maybe going to be adapting to"
"different in"
"norfolk environments"
"like i guess how would you fix it but"
"which once you've told it to do this how"
"would you ensure it stays like that and"
"not start doing something else"
"well yeah i mean so so that's part of"
"the testing of course right so so you"
"have to test it in the environments in"
"which you hope to deploy it so you would"
"have to test it and you know let's say"
"let's say if you do have some sort of in"
"the body application you would have to"
"test it in an in vivo model where they"
"encounter that kind of environment and"
"make sure that it's doing what you know"
"what you think it's going to do they're"
"going to be surprises for sure i mean"
"the the the the most certain hallmark of"
"collective intelligence is that they"
"surprise you that's you know that's"
"that's the most obvious thing but you"
"hope that you discover the key surprises"
"during testing that's what all the"
"testing is for yeah for sure um and i"
"guess yeah speaking more about this"
"collective intelligence like what does"
"that that mean in terms of the earth"
"like if"
"there's intelligence at different levels"
"and how"
"you know the i do a lot of infantry"
"cell culture work and i'm like"
"technically you know they have"
"intelligence i mean i can see it when i"
"passage them they're growing they're"
"responding to what i"
"drugs i give them"
"what is yeah what are the ethical"
"implications of all of this"
"there are massive ethical implications"
"but but they're not quite i think what"
"people think they are"
"one thing we can note for sure already"
"with the majority of us i mean certainly"
"there are vegans and jains and things"
"like this but the majority of us in this"
society
"are perfectly okay"
"eating highly intelligent animals right"
"so pigs are very smart we eat pigs cows"
"you know whatever"
"so so we already it is already the case"
"that we don't really"
"set uh set our rules based on"
"intelligence a little bit right so so"
"you can get into more trouble doing"
"things to mammals than you can to fish"
but
"we you know the factory farming"
"worldwide tells us that we're not really"
"that as as as societies we're not really"
"very careful about about uh how we make"
"that judgment so from from that"
"perspective i think i think there's"
"there's nothing"
"there's nothing to be said about frog"
"skin that you should we should be"
"talking about"
"about pigs long before we talk about"
"frog skin so that that i think that and"
"people people do get very excited about"
"the xenobots oh you know you're using"
"these things and what okay but but start"
"with the start with the factory farming"
"first and then we could talk about frog"
"skin however however they raise a much"
"bigger point which i think we absolutely"
"should be thinking about"
"because because life is so interoperable"
"meaning that you can make chimeras of"
"different cells from different species"
"and cells will live on inorganic"
"substrates and electrodes and and"
"everything else"
"we are inevitably heading"
"excuse me heading for a future where"
"every possible combination of"
"evolved biological materials some sort"
"of synthetic electronic or some other"
"kind of"
"you know engineered thing and software"
"every possible combination is going to"
"be explored we already have cyborgs we"
"already have people that control"
"wheelchairs and other devices with their"
"mind people with weird prosthetics those"
"prosthetics thing get weirder and"
"weirder somebody's going to you know"
"decide that instead of controlling their"
"wheelchair they'd like to control their"
"vacuum cleaner and maybe they're maybe"
"their neighbors vacuum cleaner and maybe"
"some sort of maybe some sort of lunar"
"you know lander and maybe you want"
"senses that yeah sure you see light but"
"maybe you'd also like a sense that"
"directly gives you a feeling of where"
"the where the you know this the stock"
"market is today"
"we are going to be surrounded by"
"uh modified organisms so so so hybrids"
"and cyborgs and and bioengineered"
"animals and plants"
"that uh it's gonna you know the the"
"space of possible beings is incredibly"
"vast and i i just we"
"my postdoc and i just wrote a paper i'm"
"on them"
"called endless forms most beautiful 2.0"
"right it's darwin darwin had this phrase"
"and he was like really impressed with a"
"variety of living things that he saw in"
"the natural world this is an n of one"
"you know this this phylogenetic tree on"
"earth is an n of one basically we we are"
"going to be it's a tiny if you if you"
"plot out the space of of all possible uh"
"bodies and minds that go with them"
"everything we know about on earth is"
"like a tiny little corner of that and"
"there are just massively different"
"creatures that we are going to have to"
"deal with never never mind what happens"
"if we find life you know exobiological"
"context outside the planet never mind"
"that we're going to be making aliens"
"like you can't believe that's that's"
"just that's just there's no there's no"
"getting around that so"
"that means that um for the first time"
"uh when you encounter some sort of being"
"you are not going to be able to use"
"familiar touchstones to figure out how"
"to relate to it meaning what did we used"
"to do right you you you came across"
"something but you could you could you"
"could tap it like this and if you heard"
"a metallic clangy sound you could"
"conclude many things ah it came off a"
"factory it's probably pretty boring and"
"dumb and i'm perfectly within my right"
"to take this thing apart and remake it"
"into a toaster on the other hand if you"
"do this and it's sort of soft and furry"
"you would say right it was evolved it's"
"probably you know somewhat clever and"
"i'm going to get in trouble if i'm not"
"nice to it and things like that"
"that's all going to be gone that that"
"stuff is not going to survive the next"
"couple of decades in the sense that you"
"where you"
"so so where we're going is a place where"
"what somebody's made of what literally"
"what materials they're made of whether"
"it's electronics or or some combination"
"of you know it's it's 70 human brain"
"cells 30"
"uh electronics or or maybe you know they"
"got 20 electronics 10 some other kind of"
"weird you know octopus cells or whatever"
"what somebody's somebody's made of and"
"how they got here meaning evolved"
"designed or some combination of the two"
"is not going to be a good guide to their"
"cognitive capacity"
"we will not be able to say well it kind"
"of looks like a fish we know what we can"
"do with fish right it's we're going to"
"be we're going to be surrounded by"
"things that we have absolutely no clue"
"based on what they look like now darwin"
"kind of already started us off on that"
"and and and that was a major upheaval"
"people got upset about that but that he"
"was saying that look there's a smooth"
"continuum between where we are as humans"
"and other life forms that are simpler"
"but there's no we're not in the garden"
"of eden anymore where you've got a bunch"
"of animals and you've got a bunch of"
"humans and they're completely different"
"and we can make different rules so he he"
"pointed out a one-dimensional continuum"
"and people went completely nuts over and"
"still you know kind of kind of crazy"
"about it that's going to be nothing"
"compared to what's coming because"
"instead of a single dimensional"
"continuum we are going to have a huge"
"dimensional space of novel beings"
"and that means that we have to develop"
"an ethics that is basically more grown"
"up than what we have now which is how"
"did you get here and what are you made"
"of right and you know what when you say"
"that when you drag that stuff into the"
"light you can sort of see how childish"
"that is right and how how sort of"
"not deep and sort of you know uh how"
"conceptually and by the way science"
"fiction has been dealing with us for"
"hundreds of years right people that that"
"story is as old as the hills that you"
"know this the spaceship lands on your"
"lawn and this thing trundles out and"
"sort of hands you a you know a poem"
"about how happy it is to meet you and"
"then you're like well it's kind of it's"
"kind of aluminum looking what do i uh"
"you know what how do i relate to this"
"thing and and and and what what can i"
"really do with it so they've been"
"dealing with that for a long time but"
"the engineering and the biology have"
"gone far ahead actually of most of those"
"stories i mean this is all reality now"
"so yeah so i think i think there are"
"massive ethical challenges but they're"
"not what people think they are it's not"
"really about frog skin it's about"
recognizing
"sentience and figuring out a framework"
"for which i've taken a stab at by the"
"way i've um you know obviously i don't"
"know the answers to this but i've taken"
"a stab at a part part of it uh a"
"framework for truly diverse"
"intelligences that that where you can"
actually
"think about how to relate to beings"
"regardless of what they look like or how"
"they got here"
"yeah for sure i don't i mean you've"
"already sort of touched on it but like"
"so why do you see the the future of the"
"human species um like i know next 50"
"hundred years and"
"i guess as well to kind of wrap up a lot"
"of things we've spoken about how would"
"you also foresee the future of like"
"health care and treatment"
"yeah um a couple things with respect to"
"to humans i i somebody asked me once"
"during during an interview like this"
"somebody asked me well given that you"
"think everything is up for for change"
"you know it's organs and and sensory and"
"whatever what's a human at that point"
"right like what really is a human i"
"think that's an excellent question"
"because if you ask yourself what is it"
"really that i value about another human"
being
"is it their genetics"
"no they're not really is it how they got"
"here or well i'm really into the fact"
"that you're a long process of ev through"
"you know you came by a long process of"
"evolution not really is it is it what"
"your internal organs are made of you"
"know if your spouse went off and came"
"back and said oh man i just shed a bunch"
"of internal organs replaced by machine"
"learning whatever fine who cares uh"
"you start asking yourself what is it"
"really that's essential and i think"
"i think that uh"
"my answer would be and and this is this"
"is based on the um"
"uh kind of framework that i that i've"
"developed for for comparing diverse"
"intelligences it's it's your it's the"
"scope of the goals that you're capable"
"of of holding on to so specifically"
"i would say that a human is a it's a"
"category what you mean when you say"
"human you don't mean anything about"
"genetics or or anatomy or anything like"
"that what you're really saying is"
"capacity for a certain degree of moral"
"concern you are capable fundamentally"
"capable of being morally concerned about"
"some number of other beings that's what"
"it means to be minimally human we all"
"know we all know what diminished"
"capacity is right you go to court and"
"and and somebody did something horrible"
"and then the and the"
"the lawyer argues he didn't he's got"
"diminished capacity he didn't he wasn't"
"able to kind of care about what's"
"happening he didn't understand all right"
"we know what diminished capacity is we"
"should have an idea of what enhanced"
"capacity is someday"
"we will have creatures that are so"
"cognitively large that they will"
"literally be able to"
"care about"
"massive numbers of individuals the way"
"we can't right we don't have if you know"
"we don't have our linear range so if"
"somebody says"
"uh something happened to uh to some"
"something terrible happened to to a"
"thousand people and then and then they"
"say no actually it was it was you know"
"it was 50 000 people you don't feel 50"
"times worse right about it you feel bad"
"but you don't feel 50 times worse we"
"don't have the linear range to"
"literally care about you know we're"
"limited in that way someday we may have"
"some sort of uh you know buddha-like uh"
"uh cognitive beings that actually can"
"they have a capacity to care and to them"
"we are as limited as uh some of the"
"creatures we know for example you know"
"dogs and whatnot that you know sure they"
"care about stuff but like a dog is never"
"gonna care about what happens in the"
"next town over three weeks from now they"
"just can't their their cognitive like"
"cone is too small for that right so"
"i think uh that's that's if i had to"
"define a human that's what i would say"
"human is a minimal level of of care and"
"concern for other sentient beings and"
"and and you know it's it's a you know"
"it's a minimal it's a minimal bar"
"uh so what's going to happen i think"
"that bodies as we know it are going to"
"go out the window i think humanity in"
"the future is going to be massively"
"diverse right depending on where you"
"live probably off planet in many cases"
"um and how you live and you you will"
"choose you know when you get old enough"
"you sort of say well you know i'd like a"
"senses that plug me into this and that"
"and and and you know your your brother"
"will choose something completely"
"different and we will all"
"physically structurally we will be"
"incredibly diverse the genetics will"
"become more or less irrelevant"
"but what still makes us human is that"
"minimal level of of concern and if that"
"goes away due to certain changes then"
"you've become something else and you"
"know that may be good or bad but it'll"
"be something else"
"for healthcare i would say this the"
"biggest change in healthcare is going to"
be
"right now"
"all of"
"molecular medicine is"
"about the the hardware it's all about"
"genomic change protein engineering"
"pathways right all that kind of stuff"
"that's where computer science was in the"
"50s in order to reprogram a computer you"
"had to physically pull wires right you"
"had to physically rewire it and then"
"what what happened well you know why do"
"we have this"
"information technology revolution"
because
"we figured out that you're much better"
"off programming at the software level if"
"you're if your hardware is good enough"
"you can't you can't do that to a you"
"know mechanical clock but but if your"
"hardware is good enough"
"you can do this that's what we're going"
"to discover in in biology we're in in"
"biomedicine we're going to be"
"we're going to be addressing the higher"
"control levels and instead of"
"trying to i might my gut feeling is that"
"that's the reason trying to micromanage"
"all of this stuff and we could talk for"
"a long time about why i think that uh"
"instead of trying to micromanage this"
"stuff which is what results in side"
"effects and you know you tweak one thing"
"and something else you know every every"
"drug has a long list of horrible side"
"effects um i think the way to beat all"
"of that is to stop focusing on"
"suppressing the symptoms"
"and try to try to"
"motivate the system to go to a health"
"state and that means understanding how"
"that system traverses its space what"
"does it want what can it remember how"
"intelligent is it what are the kinds of"
"problems it can solve what are the"
"things it cares about can you train can"
"we train organs can we train pathways we"
"we published a paper recently and other"
"people have too"
"to show that"
"gene regulatory networks can have six"
"different kinds of learning"
"so instead of instead of rewiring these"
"things through"
"through um"
"uh gene gene editing and gene therapy"
"we should have we should have ways of"
"training them and and training them for"
"health states and it's all the"
"advantages of trading over"
"micromanagement that you have when you"
"you know when you train a rat to do a"
"trick instead of having to go in there"
"and run every neuron like like a like a"
"puppet to get it to do what it wants to"
"do right much easier to train the thing"
"so i think i think where where"
"medicine is is going to go i hope is"
towards
"understanding the high level control"
"structures and actually resolving"
"whatever the problem is as opposed to"
"trying to"
"address individual"
"individual symptoms which is kind of"
"what we have right most most drugs"
"except for antibiotics and things like"
"that most drugs that we have you stop"
"taking it back where you get they don't"
"fix anything they do right do you stop"
"taking you're back where you came from"
"they don't actually change the system at"
"all so so i think i think we're going to"
"get past that"
"yeah and i think as we've spoken about"
"we've seen yeah multiple examples now"
"where it seems like having this high"
"level um interfering and different"
"interfering at the high level seems to"
"and not worrying about the micro"
"management seems to be like a more"
"effective um way forward and i think"
"just kind of one from that obviously i"
"trained us by chemists looking at the"
"very lower levels and the molecular"
"details what kind of advice would you"
"give for"
"i guess my viewers who are probably also"
"fascinated by your your research in"
"terms of"
uh
"like having a career in science now what"
"is the best way to kind of understand"
"have a broad knowledge in different"
"disciplines which like inevitably seems"
"to be required to understand"
"whatever this higher level is and the"
the
"the downstream manifestations"
"and i guess just more generally advice"
"and having an amazing scientific career"
"as you've you've definitely demonstrated"
"um yeah i can i can i can say a couple"
"things i i mean really i"
"uh i'm kind of amazed every day that"
"that i'm here doing these things i i"
"dreamed about it from the time i was a"
"kid but i pretty much always i pretty"
"much always thought that it would"
"like all through grad school for example"
"i thought today's the day i get kicked"
"out like that like i pretty much thought"
"this is this this was it and i'll go"
"back to programming and whatever um so"
"so it's not like i had you know it's not"
"like i knew uh how to do this from from"
"the beginnings it was a lot of events"
"that uh that took place but um i will i"
"will say this uh"
"what's really key to remember is that"
"every that the disciplines are not real"
"and that and what i mean by that is that"
"every discipline is pretty sure of"
"various assumptions and the right ways"
"to look at things"
and
"what you have to do is really nail"
"home the idea that that's just one lens"
"every department every set of people"
"with their own journal and their own"
"funding body and their own conferences"
"they're all using one lens to look at"
"things and they love that lens and if"
"you go there and try to do it in a"
"different way they'll tell you that"
"you're nuts and there may be somebody"
"next door"
"who's using a different lens to whom"
"everything you're saying is obvious i"
"see that that happens to me all the time"
"i give a talk and different parts of the"
"talk make people mad depending on what"
"uh what department i'm in there are"
"things that i can say in one department"
"they're like yes so of course and then"
"in another department were you crazy so"
"right so so you just have to realize"
"that you should you you if you really"
"want to"
uh
"do new things and i think we're getting"
"to the point as a society where all the"
"stuff that could have been done with a"
"single lens is pretty much done right"
"we've kind of all the easy things that"
"could have been solved from a single"
"perspective i think they're mostly"
"solved everything that's which is a my"
"which is a far minority of the things"
"that need to be solved everything else"
"needs needs needs needs you to crack out"
"of that lens and use multiple approaches"
"that are informed by different ways of"
"looking at the world so computer"
scientists
physicists
"uh biologists cognitive scientists at"
"all levels right uh they all they all"
"look at the world in a completely"
"different way and"
"we just need to i think we need to"
"commit to all of those may or may not be"
"useful so just be ready to try them out"
"and discard them as you will"
"and get really comfortable with those"
"with those kinds of lenses so so take"
"some not not computational biology or"
"bioinformatics but real honest to god"
"computer science classes right take an"
"engineering class where"
"the most magical class by the way of all"
"is is is electrical engineering 101"
"because you start with you start with"
"ohm's law and like this stupid you know"
"electrons running through a wire and by"
"the end of the class you've built a"
"decision-making device that can follow"
"an algorithm you make a little computer"
"that takes instructions off a stack it"
"does logic it's following an algorithm"
"you started with physics you ended up"
"with with logic and and you know in a"
"thing that that that reads information"
"and follows instructions and you did it"
"with your own hand so you know there"
"wasn't any magic"
"it's like incredible right"
"so so those kinds of ways to to think"
"about things you know or or physicists"
"you know um"
"and the way that the way that they like"
"to have explanations you know"
"f equals m a right that kind of"
"explanation would never fly in a"
"molecular biology class they they hate"
"that kind of stuff but but for a"
"physicist that's a great that's a great"
"explanation so uh"
"computer science especially right and"
"and their emphasis on um"
"um multiple realizability and the fact"
"that that that the algorithm is the key"
"and it doesn't matter if you're made of"
"you know of of silicon and and you know"
"electron flows or like dandenon says"
"beer cans and string it doesn't matter"
"so so all of those perspectives so so"
"that's what that's what i that's what i"
"think i think it's really important to"
just
"realize that everything you've been"
"taught by a certain set of people is is"
"all from one perspective and that things"
"that they believe"
are
"are are you know sort of sacred like all"
"your explanations should be at the level"
"of chemistry right that's i mean what is"
"what is that's not even that's not even"
"reductionism or if you're a real"
"reductionist you'd want to do it in"
"terms of quantum foam but you don't want"
"to do that you want chemistry so so"
"right so so every field has these these"
"things that they hold on to"
"and i think i think uh we're we're"
"rapidly getting to the place where"
"progress means you gotta you gotta try"
"on some new some new lenses"
"yeah sure though that's incredible"
"advice and obviously having read a lot"
"of your research it really has like"
"introduced me to a lot of concepts that"
"i've never heard of before and like it"
"now as you say it makes me think about"
"things differently because i've been"
"like say trained i mean i don't want to"
"say anything bad about my education but"
"like you do doesn't"
um
"you do put these lenses on how you think"
"about a certain subject and i think it"
"is important to"
"yeah have that sort of diverse"
"understanding so um we've had an"
"absolutely incredible conversation and"
"so um where can my viewers go to find"
"out more about your lab research or to"
"um yeah find out about yeah more what"
"you're doing"
"yeah um everything is at"
"this is at a website drmik11.org"
"so there there's links to the various"
"institutes so like the icdo our"
"institute for computer designed"
"organisms which is all the zen about"
"stuff all the papers all the primary"
"papers a bunch of talks that i've given"
um
"everything is there it's pretty it's"
"pretty up to date all the papers all the"
"you know everything is there lots of"
"material so oh and i also have a twitter"
"feed a twitter feed at drmik11"
"i just what i have to say is excellent"
"to follow um yeah as i can see in the"
"background an amazing uh"
"you have collection of books which as"
"well i would love to be able to read"
"them all at some point but yeah um me"
"too me too it's time to read it's time"
"to re it's time to re-read i mean many"
"of these i read 30 40 years ago and i"
"you know you you look at them you say"
"wow i wonder if i would squeeze"
"something completely different out of it"
"now so"
"and if i for sure i mean i was actually"
"just reading a paper um this one that's"
"relevant to my phd work"
"for the first time in like two years and"
"even just two years i've now thought"
"something very different from it than i"
"did the first time so yeah like"
"anyway i gotta start said thank you so"
"much for uh yeah taking the time to"
"speak with me today and i was the best"
"best of luck for your research and i"
"look forward to seeing your latest"
"discoveries likewise yeah thanks so much"
"good luck with everything keep in touch"
"yeah be in touch"
you
