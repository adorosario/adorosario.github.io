"uh hey everyone i'm paris chopra and"
"today i'm with dr michael levin"
"who's a distinguished professor in the"
"biology department at"
"tufts and serves as director of the"
"allen discovery center"
"he holds a phd in biology from the"
"harvard university"
"at tufts his research group is"
"interested in figuring out how our"
"bodies know what to become"
"we all start as a collection of"
"undifferentiated cells in an embryo"
"how does that ball of cells ultimately"
"gives rise to"
"the precise shape that our bodies have"
"surely the answer is not"
"entirely dna because all cells in our"
embryo
"share the same dna something else must"
"be telling ourselves"
"what shape to adapt uh and when to stop"
multiplying
"uh dr levin believes that what guides"
"our body plans"
"is by electrical communication between"
"different units"
"our bodies take shape the way they have"
"because each of our subunits"
"cells tissues organs collectively"
decides
"uh it to be that way dr eleven is"
"doing biology on the cutting edge as"
you'll
"see quite literally sometimes i'm"
"excited to learn from him what all are"
"we missing"
"uh in the mainstream account of biology"
"uh welcome dr levin"
"thank you so much i'm happy to be here i"
"i i was reading your biography and uh"
"your sort of uh history career history"
"and it seems uh"
"you were in a software engineer before"
"you became interested in biology"
"so how did that happen"
"well i mean i was interested in biology"
"from a very early age in that i used to"
"uh play with insects and and you know"
"watch plants and things like this"
"but uh i was always interested primarily"
"in the information processing you know i"
"wanted to know"
"how do these bodies get to be here and"
how
"do their minds work and how is it"
"possible that some"
"arrangements of matter meaning living"
"things are able to have"
"memories and preferences and goals and"
"the ability to process information"
"towards some sort of future activity and"
"so on"
"so my first um my first uh real"
"uh love was was biology but i was always"
"interested in computer science as a way"
"to develop these things from scratch"
"right so the idea is that if you can"
"program that means you are"
"manipulating information from the bottom"
"up you're defining the ways in which"
"it is processed and therefore you can"
"you can test various ways"
"that it might work so i always was into"
"artificial intelligence you know"
"building autonomous things from scratch"
"and so"
"i learned to program uh i was doing some"
"software engineering i briefly had a"
"software company"
"um i got a degree in computer science"
"but um"
"it became pretty clear at that point"
"that uh it was really important to"
"understand the biology a lot better"
"to uh to create better better devices"
"and so then then i went for a"
"you know for biology degrees right so"
it's
"it's fantastic to sort of listen to this"
"uh as you migrated from being interested"
in
"information processing to biology and"
"and traditionally information processing"
"in biology has been associated with"
brain
"but you chose a different sort of path"
"which is"
"entire bodies how did you stumble upon"
"that specific path"
"and not like studying the brain and of"
"course there are parallels but"
"your research is uh much more aligned to"
"the entire bodies and morphogenesis than"
"the just"
"neurochemistry or our brains"
"yeah well i was i was thinking about i"
"mean certainly neuroscience is"
"fascinating and of course brains are"
"very interesting and lots of people work"
"on understanding brains"
"but um two kinds of uh types of"
"two types of thinking led me to this to"
"this direction one is that"
"if you ask where brains come from right"
"so clearly brains didn't just appear"
"from nowhere evolutionarily basically"
"neural cells are a an elaboration"
"of cells that were here long before"
"brains appeared and in fact even"
"bacterial biofilms and certainly"
"many of the cells in your body do do"
"most of the same things that neurons do"
"they have most of the same machinery but"
"at a slower time scale they do some of"
"the same things"
"so if you think about through evolution"
"how brains got here"
"and what might be the uh more primitive"
"older versions of the amazing uh"
"capabilities that our brains and other"
"animals brains have"
"you're inevitably pushed into thinking"
"uh about what these kinds of"
"capabilities look like before their"
"brains what do other cells do when they"
"use the same mechanisms that brains use"
"in the same kinds of"
"uh signaling and computation and so on"
um
"uh so so that was that was kind of going"
"at it from the neuroscience path"
backwards
"on the other hand if you think about"
"embryogenesis and in particular"
"not simply the fact that uh a particular"
"egg can go through the exact same steps"
"and give rise to the same organism every"
"single time not just that"
"sort of feed forward emergent process"
"but actually"
"regulative development where you can you"
"can divide an embryo in half for example"
"in each house"
"if you do it early enough will give rise"
"to a complete embryo or regeneration"
"where these things adapt to novel"
"circumstances and remodel their body"
structure
"right if you think about that that is a"
"very um computational process that's a"
very
"uh kind of um plastic"
"type of activity that really forces you"
"to ask"
"you know what what types of computations"
"might there be for the system"
"to really detect that it's been damaged"
"to remember what"
"shape it's supposed to be to stop"
"remodeling when that shape is fixed"
"and so then immediately one starts to"
"think about what might be the analogies"
"to behavior where the"
"exact same things are done in the brain"
"right in terms of"
"making observations comparing to"
"preferences active purposeful activity"
"and so on"
"so all of these things converge on this"
"kind of"
"idea that we can take from neurosciences"
"deep concepts"
"and apply them far wider than just the"
neurons
"right so what you're suggesting is our"
"bodies are"
"at a uh at a crude level doing a lot"
"what our brains are doing"
"our brains have just doing it in a much"
"more specialized manner"
"which is you know information processing"
"but all the primitives of what brain"
does
"somewhere exist in non-neuronal"
"cells and within our bodies as well yeah"
"i think i think that's very fair i mean"
"i think"
"brains were uh adapted for a number of"
"uh specific functions including speed to"
"uh to help in the behavioral arms race"
"against the predators and"
"and so on but but most of the"
"fundamental things"
"that that neural networks and brains do"
"i think have their roots"
"way older i think evolution discovered"
"right around the time of"
"bacterial biofilms that electrical"
"networks are a great way to process"
"information it's ancient ancient"
"kinds of things so just to clarify when"
"you say bacterial biofilms"
"uh compute or they're intelligent in"
"some sort what exactly do you mean"
"by that well then what what sense are"
"they intelligent"
"well so we i mean with that indeed"
"intelligence is this is a is a separate"
"issue that we can get into momentarily"
"if you'd like but"
"uh bacterial biofilms have very"
"brain-like and in fact individual"
"bacteria have"
"very brain-like uh electrical uh types"
"of activity that caught that enables"
"them to cooperate with each other to"
"adapt to environmental changes"
"and so on there's some beautiful there's"
"some older work by koshland there's some"
"uh beautiful work from girl soel"
"who um is is really tracking this kind"
"of uh"
"the propagation of electrical"
"information in bacterial colonies"
"and it looks very brainlike you know"
"these are the same principles of"
distributed
"uh information sharing that that somatic"
"cells are doing this is already being"
"done in biosolvene so"
"this is very nice and work on that okay"
"so coming to morphogenesis"
"dr levin can you describe what's the"
"traditional view of how"
"organisms take shape and what particular"
"we miss in that and by traditional view"
"i mean"
"the bottoms of view where dna is uh"
"seen as the soul uh soul sort of"
"representation of what an organism will"
become
"that's what everyone talks about dna as"
"a source code of life so"
"what is that and why that cannot"
"possibly be the entire story"
"sure um i mean i think this the standard"
view
"of molecular and developmental biology"
"is that"
"uh there are there that every cell has a"
genome
"these uh genes gene products interact"
"with each other meaning genes turn each"
"other on and off so you have these gene"
"regulatory networks that have some kind"
"of dynamics"
"some of these gene products are um"
"they're they're functional meaning"
"they're either sticky or they diffuse or"
"there's some sort of"
"uh you know they're able to exert force"
"they they do various things"
"and so in parallel uh according to the"
"laws of physics"
"all of these things interact and then"
"there's this emergent process"
"whereby many many cells simultaneously"
"are doing this and in the end you have"
"this complex"
"outcome it's the sort of idea this"
"emergence is the idea that"
"you know if you have lots of ants"
"following very simple rules eventually"
"you get an ant which is quite complex"
"and which does things that no individual"
"aunt does"
"so yeah i must say that that there is"
"nothing specifically wrong with this"
"story this is all"
"true all of these things are happening"
"and that's exactly what uh"
"is going on if one looks at it bottom up"
"at the molecular level"
"uh i think the limitation of this view"
"and why"
"i um and others of course i'm not the"
"only one who's saying this but but i"
"am proposing a complimentary not not a"
"replacement for a complementary view"
"to this is is the following in all of"
"these feed forward"
"kinds of processes where you have lots"
"of very complex rules and then"
"out comes something sorry the rules are"
"simple the outcomes are complex"
"one of the limitations of this is that"
"if you wanted to make a change"
"in the system level outcome so let's say"
"in the case of the ants you want an"
"angle that has two chimneys instead of"
one
"then if if your focus is on at the very"
"beginning on the low level rules that"
"each element is following"
"the question is well which rule do you"
"change and how"
"to get this complex outcome right so"
"ants have rules about picking up"
"pheromones and putting down pheromones"
"and things like this"
"they don't have any rules that"
"specifically talk about the shape of"
"chimneys of the uh of the anthem"
"so what would you change so this is"
"known as an inverse problem"
"and it's in general terms it's it's it's"
"fairly intractable it's an extremely"
"difficult problem"
"and it leads to limitations in"
"regenerative medicine because"
"if you know what we're actually"
"interested in is complex structure"
"so you can think forward that if if all"
"of the"
"problems of stem cell biology were"
"solved so let's say you could make any"
"kind of cell out of a stem cell"
"and uh the the technique of genomic"
"editing were solved which i think it"
"will be"
"you know fairly soon such that you could"
"make very precise edits to dna"
"besides the kinds of uh sort of single"
gene
"diseases which admittedly are very"
"important um then"
"if somebody is missing an arm or they"
"need a new eye or"
"so you know some complex outcome or the"
"craniofacial pattern is wrong"
"um what what genes would you edit you"
"know this no no"
"this is an extremely difficult problem"
"and so"
"uh what what would be nice is if there"
was
"some way of asking uh the the question"
"of how"
"cellular collectives because that's what"
"we have during the regeneration and"
"embryogenesis you have this kind of"
swarm
"this kind of swarm collective activity"
"how these collectives may be"
"motivated to uh desirable large-scale"
"outcomes and the thing the thing is"
"that uh it i what i want to be clear"
"about this i'm certainly not suggesting"
"that there's any sort of"
"magic extra ingredient that somehow"
"comes in from outside and guides"
"you know gene expression okay i'm not"
"saying anything like that uh"
"for sure at the lowest level what you"
"have is physics and and biochemistry"
that's
"no no doubt about that however uh i"
think
"the right way to think about this is"
"similar to what computer scientists"
"think about"
"when they talk about software and"
"hardware so what the genetics does"
"is it gives you a specification of the"
hardware
"right and i think people often talk"
"about the dna as being the software of"
"the cell and i think"
"that's incomplete i think the better way"
"to think about it actually is that"
"uh what what the dna does is it nails"
"down the hardware that every cell gets"
"to have"
"so the dna is a specification of low"
"level parts you know"
"like electrical components that you"
"might have with all the ion channels all"
"the signaling proteins everything else"
"that's the that's the hard way"
"and so this hardware of course uh has"
"some uh some very robust"
"default behavior meaning in the absence"
"of any manipulations"
"it always ends up having some particular"
"behavior and evolution has shaped that"
hardware
"so that that default behavior is"
"adaptive and good and so that's how you"
"get this you get these bodies"
"but the amazing thing about this"
"hardware is as we've learned in computer"
science
"you can make hardware that's"
"reprogrammable so"
"what what evolution has also done is"
"given us hardware that's actually able"
"to do"
"many different types of modes of"
"activity uh"
"on the same hardware without rewiring"
"and so the question then is what what"
"you know think about what the journey"
"that computer science took were in the"
50s
"and 40s in order to reprogram a computer"
"right you had to move the wires around"
"you had to physically rewire and the"
"reason that nowadays when you want to"
"you know switch from photoshop to"
"microsoft word you don't get out your"
"soldering iron and start rewiring"
"is because we've learned that there are"
"architectures that"
"can be uh manipulated by inputs by"
stimuli
"and right and so and so my argument is"
"that biology does exactly this"
"that evolution found this strategy i'm"
"certainly not saying that"
"uh living things are like today's"
"standard computers okay of course"
"they're not they're the many differences"
"but what's similar"
"is the fact that there's this really"
"interesting separation between machine"
"and data"
"which means that you can you can alter"
"the goal towards which"
"these cellular collectives are working"
"without having to rewire them and"
"without having to"
"solve the inverse problem and do this at"
"a genetic level yes"
"this was very surprising to me when i"
"came across your work the"
"reprogrammability of biology because"
"i always assumed that given a particular"
dna
"you'll end up generating a particular"
"phenotype or the organism but clearly"
"your research suggests a lot of uh what"
"we end up with"
"is reprogrammable so before we dive into"
"this i just want to make sure i"
"understand uh what you're saying"
"saying as correctly so we start"
"as a bunch of cells which is an embryo"
and
"due to physics say for example some"
"chemicals accumulating at one end but"
"not the other end there is some sort of"
a
"natural structure that emerges which"
"lets these"
"similar undifferentiated cells into more"
"differentiated cells"
"and given if you don't disturb the sort"
"of trajectory of"
"this differentiation these collection of"
"cells will"
"end up becoming a particular organism"
"but what you're saying is we can"
intervene
"at some level to enable these cells to"
"become something else"
"entirely even though they started as a"
"very similar"
"uh dna structure initially"
"well that that is true that what you"
"said is correct and we can talk about um"
"our particular example of that where we"
make
"uh novel organisms out of perfectly"
"standard wild type frog cells we can"
"talk about that but"
"but um i want to point out one thing"
"this is not simply"
"about external manipulations that cause"
"cells to do other things this is really"
"a very deep inherent property of of all"
"uh living things and i want to give you"
"one example"
"um that i think illustrates what what"
"i'm talking about this is something we"
"discovered in the frog"
"a few years ago but other people have"
"seen have been talking about examples of"
"this for you know"
"even at the dawn of developmental"
"biology this was well understood but"
"this happens imagine um imagine that"
tackle
"so a tadpole is a is a is a larval frog"
"it has very"
"a particular structure of the face and"
"head and in order to become a frog"
"during morphogenesis"
"it has to move all those organs around"
"so the eyes have to"
"move forward the mouth has to come out"
"you know the nostrils have to move all"
"these things have to move and during"
"metamorphosis it rearranges its face"
basically
"and so one could and and people did have"
"this view of"
"metamorphosis is that it's somehow"
"genetically programmed and"
"that's a weird you know claim uh but"
"but people used to think that um it was"
"it was somehow a hard-wired set of"
movements
"basically every tadpole looks the same"
"every frog looks the same so if you"
"simply move all if every if every piece"
"of the face knows which direction and"
"how far to move then you get from a"
"tackle to a frog and everything as well"
"so what we did was we studied"
"metamorphosis in so-called picasso frogs"
"these are frogs where"
"everything that tackles where everything"
"starts out in the wrong position"
"so the eyes are off to the side of the"
"head the nostrils are up here you know"
"the mouth is bad like"
"everything is just is just in the wrong"
"place the amazing thing is that those"
"tadpoles still largely become normal"
frauds
"and the reason is because all these"
"different things move around"
"in abnormal meaning unnatural paths"
"until they get to the correct path and"
"actually sometimes they overshoot a"
"little bit and come back and have to"
"come back"
"but they they move around and when do"
"they stop they stop when they hit the"
correct
"uh frog face configuration so what"
"you're seeing here is that this hardware"
"is amazing it doesn't just do the same"
"thing because"
"because it hasn't been perturbed it"
"actually can start for many different"
configurations
"and get to the same final outcome and"
"this is a very"
"uh this already sounds a little bit like"
"behavior right lots of animals can start"
from
"different configurations and get to"
"where they're going because there's"
"flexible there's a kind of this goes"
"back to your point about intelligence"
"you know this problem-solving ability"
right
"fundamentally intelligence is"
"problem-solving in some space"
"so we're talking about morpheus morphe"
"space here the shape of all possible"
faces
"um and and uh this the system is"
"basically an error reduction mechanism"
"that what it's able to do it's a"
"homeostatic process it it can just"
"determine that there's an error there's"
"a delta between where it's supposed to"
"be and where it is"
"and it will keep remodeling until until"
"that error is as small as it could"
"possibly get"
"and of course it's not perfect and so"
"you can overwhelm it and so on but"
"um that that tells you right there that"
"what you're dealing with"
"is a system that in some way stores or"
represents
"the path that it wants to get to and"
"it's able to take novel"
"um novel conte novel novel uh paths to"
"that final configuration"
"you know if they can of course um in"
"order to do that so that i think is very"
"profound this ability"
"of these collectives to flexibly pursue"
"goals that don't belong to any"
"individual cell they belong to the"
collective
"that i think yes so i'm going to use a"
"crude analogy which"
"i think captures what you're trying to"
"say um"
"i mean the traditional view is probably"
organisms
"are like the top down soviet economy"
"where everything is"
"orchestrated and uh not top down in the"
"sense of having some force but through"
"the dna"
"precise movements of where different"
"parts need to go"
"but uh probably what you what you're"
"suggesting it's more like an economy"
"where different units are trying to sort"
"of self-organize"
"and go to uh places where they make"
sense
"where they're supposed to be so when you"
"put i mean a it's amazing you're able to"
"make picasso frogs"
"uh love to know how you do that but b"
"it's also amazing if you put an eye"
"somewhere else entirely in in very early"
"stages it's"
"able to migrate to a place where it's"
"supposed to be"
"which wouldn't be obvious if you believe"
"that uh organisms only sort of develop"
"in a certain way"
"so is is this characterization roughly"
right
"of an economy versus like a top-down"
"planning there's a part of that that"
"i think is is absolutely right and"
"there's a part of that that i would say"
"differently um"
"the let's let's do the top-down part"
"first so i think"
"actually um quite the opposite in the"
"sense that"
"uh the standard story of developmental"
biology
"really does not like top down control"
"the idea that"
"there is some represented goal towards"
"which the cells are working"
"so particularly that the system in some"
"way knows what a correct"
"frog face looks like or anything like"
"that that that is not a popular idea"
today
"in in developmental biology it used to"
"be a long time ago but it isn't now"
"even though we have many many examples"
"and all developmental biologists know"
"about these examples"
"of systems that can get to the same"
"outcome despite different circumstances"
"and then they stop and the question is"
"well why do they stop i mean of course"
"they have to have some kind of"
"stop condition but but people usually"
"think about this in a very bottom-up way"
"in the sense that we hope and and there"
"are some models of this but but still"
not
"all that many but we hope that in the"
"future we will have some understanding"
"of why"
"uh tracking the the really the low-level"
"rules meaning the cellular interaction"
"rules the biochemistry the biophysics"
"you know molecular level rules"
"will somehow um explain all of this and"
"in a purely feed-forward fashion people"
"are uh still it is"
"not a popular idea that that the system"
"in some way represents this goal towards"
"which it's it's going"
"you know this this kind of um dis"
"distaste for these types of models"
"uh in biology stems from from you know"
"sort of pre-scientific"
"ideas about uh teleology and things like"
"this and people would like to get away"
"from that"
"of course the reality is in in"
"engineering and cybernetics"
"we've in control theory we've had for"
"many decades now mature"
"signs of systems with goals right so"
"it's not scary anymore it's not magical"
"i think we can"
"i think it's okay but but but but"
"actually that's that's not you know"
"these kind of top-down ideas are really"
"not very um"
"very mainstream yet in developmental"
biology
"the other thing you said though is is"
"absolutely correct which is that"
"um i think it's a it's a it's a useful"
"and and"
"uh empirically a sort of fruitful way to"
"look at all of these patterning systems"
"as collections of subsystems with"
"uh with with individual goals so"
"at each level so you've got organs"
"tissue cells"
"even subcellular organelles all of these"
"things are competing"
"even within the same embryo within the"
"same body they compete with each other"
"for metabolic resources for information"
"and they cooperate and they're trying to"
"do various things"
"uh local um you know things that are uh"
"uh achieve states that are that are"
"defined at their own level so individual"
"cells have metabolic states that they're"
"trying to achieve"
"and by biochemical states organs have"
morphogenetic
"types of states the cells crawl around"
"to to meet certain goals"
"and and the final outcome is this"
"the result of all of these multi-scale"
uh
"kinds of activities trying to uh trying"
"to fulfill"
"homeostatic uh goals that are defined at"
"their own level"
"so from that perspective it is very much"
"a patchwork of sub agents"
"for what that together give rise to this"
"amazing robustness that we see"
"right so uh by homeostasis you mean"
"preferring a certain kind of environment"
"or a structure"
"for example a bacteria prefers a certain"
"range of temperature or chemical"
"gradient and so on and it would sort of"
"move towards an environment where"
evolutionary
"it seems you know best suited so each of"
"the subunits we have"
"right from cells organs they have these"
"so called goals"
"which are a result of evolution right"
"but but the question is where are where"
"where is this top down really stored and"
"i know"
"this might not be even the correct word"
"to use because typically we use storage"
"in the sense of"
"uh dna and so on and so forth but these"
"are clearly some high level emerging"
phenomena
"sure but still like you said how does"
"the body know when to stop multiplying"
"yeah yeah um so so i think two two two"
"interesting things"
"um you you brought up there um"
"the the the let's let's just uh you know"
"we can talk about where it's stored and"
"we found we found uh uh one really"
"interesting example of"
"a structure that can store this"
"information and that's bioelectricity"
"there are other structures so there are"
"cytoskeletal structures"
"you know for example um people what one"
"special thing about dna is that it's an"
"unbroken lineage going all the way back"
"to our last common ancestor right"
"because each dna is patterned or"
"templated onto the previous dna"
"actually there are other molecules that"
"do this too so the cytoskeleton"
"is exactly the same way uh lipid"
"structures in the membrane are that way"
too
"and so uh there are there are other"
"structures but but"
"the one that we study uh is is"
bioelectricity
"and we study uh bioelectric circuits"
that
"uh that store you know that store these"
"kind of patterns and we can talk about"
"some of the"
"um some of the examples that we found"
"but um the kind of the"
"the the the the first thing that uh that"
"you mentioned uh"
"ask can you ask that again the first"
"thing uh there was something very"
"interesting that uh that you just said"
"that i wanted to i was talking about"
homeostasis
"where yeah that's right it's because"
"maybe evolution i mean it's an outcome"
"evolution that's what i was sort of just"

"upon so yeah so this is actually a"
"really important point and i just wanted"
to
"to talk about that for a second so um"
preferences
"are tricky because uh the understanding"
of
"uh how to define a preference you know"
"we can homeostasis"
"homeostasis is easier to define because"
"it's functional and i'll define that"
"momentarily preference is a little"
harder
"because it has this this connotation of"
"asset or"
"um you know kind of uh valence you know"
"what what do you actually prefer"
"and this is this is easier to visualize"
"for more complex"
"systems that we're used to like animals"
"and so on versus similar ones"
"simple ones but uh but but homeostasis"
"is is easier to deal with so homeostasis"
"is basically a cycle in which a system"
"exerts energy and effort to"
"uh achieve a particular state of affairs"
"some some some measurable that it like"
"that that"
"it will it will exert actively exert"
"energy to get back to that state of"
repair
"so so the thermostat in everybody's home"
"is an example of this right you set a"
"set point"
"and uh and this thing will exert energy"
"it will measure the current temperature"
"it will"
"determine which direction has to go in"
"and then it will act"
"and then it will stop acting when you"
"land in that in that"
"zone so that's actually a pretty good"
"analogy for a lot of"
"what we're talking about because the"
"nice thing about thermostats"
"is that you can see right away they have"
"a set point they have to remember the"
"set point"
"now whether thermostats have a"
"preference or not that's"
"you know that's a deeper uh question but"
um
"uh but but what you can see with the the"
"the neat thing about these kind of"
"homeostatic loops"
"is that it's it's a very simple example"
"of having a goal state you know"
extremely
"primitive type of uh goal seeking system"
and
"what's what's really special about it is"
"that the goal state"
"is encoded separately from the machine"
"itself in other words"
"if your thermostat is set to you know 65"
degrees
"and you now want to set it to 80 degrees"
"you don't have to change the structure"
"of the whole thing"
"all you have to change is the"
"information that's stored in that set"
point
"leave the rest of it be because what it"
"knows how to do is look at that"
"information and act on it"
"so that separation of of information"
"from machine is really critical and i"
think
"uh you know we're not so clever that we"
"found it you know evolution found it"
"long ago"
"and uh these set points and we can talk"
"about where these set points are stored"
"and i think bioelectricity is an"
"important place where they're stored"
"much like in the brain um but but that's"
"really the cool part about this is that"
"it shows you a very simple way how you"
can
"you don't have to rewire your hardware"
"in order to get the"
"the system to follow a different uh a"
"different uh different goal"
"and and when we get to talking about the"
"zenobots we can also talk about you know"
"you had mentioned that these goals are"
"set by evolution and"
"all most of the time they are but it"
"doesn't have to be that way and i think"
"that's actually very"
"right on this on this topic of"
"programmability um"
"i think it's it's a really interesting"
"insight that for thermostats"
"you could set it to any temperature and"
"it will sort of try to"
"get to that temperature but of course"
"it's by design we've designed it that"
"way i can imagine a machine"
"that's hardwired to only seek one"
"temperature so in your view why did"
"evolution come up with the separation"
"uh between uh i mean between the"
software
"and hardware why not just have"
"everything in hardware"
"yeah that's a that's a great point um"
"and and i don't you know"
"i'm certainly not claiming that every"
"every biological system is that way"
"i'm sure i'm sure there are many"
"biological systems that are not"
"reprogrammable that are much more"
clockwork
"and and so on um and i'm sure some of"
the
"earlier attempts at synthetic with you"
"know synthetic life when people create"
"these kind of primitive cells and not"
"the stuff that we do because we already"
"start with cells but you know really"
"really primitive origin of life um kind"
of
"kinds of things um at that point we will"
see
"things that are not reprogrammable and"
"at least to start with and i'm sure"
"evolution started that way too"
"uh i think i think the reason that this"
"is so uh"
"prevalent in biology is for a couple of"
"reasons one is"
"um i think that this architecture is uh"
"incredibly uh suitable for challenging"
"environments it builds robustness"
"first of all for the let's let's just"
"think about the time scale of the"
individual
"creature right so you can make creatures"
"that are sort of one-off"
"organisms meaning they don't they don't"
"heal they don't remodel if anything's"
"wrong with it it just dies"
"and that works that's an okay strategy"
"for organisms that have"
"thousands upon thousands of offspring if"
"somebody survives that's good enough"
right
"and so you know c c elegans nematodes or"
"drosophila kind of"
"those kind of organisms tend to be way"
"more like that"
"but but but evolution already also found"
"this other strategy where where things"
"very plastic"
"and it can actually adapt to lots of new"
"environments and"
"not only is that good for the life for"
"the lifetime of the of the organism but"
"think about evolvability"
"so just the the the control of the of"
"the of the system itself never mind um"
"the environment or us trying to control"
"it one of the one of the things we found"
"um some some years back is that if you"
"take a tadpole and you make an eye"
"form on its tail okay those eyes"
"those animals can see perfectly well out"
"of those eyes the brain has no trouble"
"interpreting data that"
"those eyes amazingly those eyes can"
"synapse on the spinal cord they don't go"
"to the brain the the optic"
"the spinal cord yeah and the data"
"somehow ends up on the spinal cord"
"presumably eventually"
"gets to the brain uh and those animals"
"can can see we we've"
"you know we can train them on visual uh"
"visual tasks"
"so uh think about how amazing that is"
"for evolution because"
"if you you have this creature and you"
"know things things are going okay"
"and there's a mutation and uh imagine"
"that this mutation"
"has a really good uh really beneficial"
"outcome somewhere"
"but it also makes the eyes uh it also"
"happens to make the eyes"
"form slightly in the wrong position well"
if
"if you were a a sort of paint by numbers"
"organism had no plasticity"
"no good right because nothing would work"
"all your behavioral programs would be"
"would be useless"
"your vision would be useless that thing"
"would die out whereas"
"if if each piece of that organism is"
"it's uh is"
"it has plasticity and goal directed"
"activity to the point where"
"it can actually you know that eye still"
"even though it's in a weird location it"
"still knows how to put out an optic"
"nerve it gets somewhere where it can"
"pass its data to the brain"
"that means that you're that much more uh"
"able to accommodate new mutations"
"and that also means that you take you"
"know most mutations and any kind"
"any engineer knows if you have a complex"
"system and it works pretty well if you"
"start making random changes"
"usually things get worse they don't get"
"better yeah and so and so this means"
that
"that in in an organism with no"
"plasticity it would be very slow to"
evolve
"because uh most changes would be would"
be
"uh would be harmful you know things"
"wouldn't work as well but if you have an"
"organism where"
"yeah you know if if the environment of"
each
"organ primordium changes a little bit"
"the cells can adapt they can still kind"
"of do their job and get where they need"
"to go they have that flexibility"
"then you're suddenly tolerant of many"
"many more mutations they can either be"
neutral
"if the other things around you make up"
"for it or"
"um or they can even be beneficial but"
"you can accumulate all of these"
"mutations and still make an adaptive"
"uh body right and so so i think"
"evolvability uh"
"is is massively uh potentiated by this"
"multi-scale competency you know that's"
"kind of the name that we've given in"
"this multi-scale competence the fact"
that
"at every level cells organs and so on"
"all of these different subunits are"
"trying to get their"
"trying to get to specific homeostatic"
"points and when things"
"in their neighborhood or or or other"
"things uh that impinge on them"
"uh change they can still get it done and"
"that's very important for evolution"
"yeah i i love this example so much of an"
eye
"on a tadpole's tail that's able to see"
"whether it sounds like it shouldn't be"
"possible but it's possible it uh"
"almost sounds like an economy again when"
"uh if you remove a factory from one"
"place the"
"everything else adjusts to accommodate"
"uh lack of that factory at that place"
"and it could come somewhere else and"
"the city still functions i think i think"
"that's that's very fair"
"because what you have here there's a"
"couple of uh related concepts"
"that would work you know in your example"
one
"one is modularity the fact that a lot of"
"these things function as"
"self-contained modules right uh they and"
"they can do their job in many different"
"circumstances at many different"
"locations at a control"
"level these are basically subroutines so"
"one of the reasons we can make eyes and"
"you know we don't know how to"
"micromanage the formation of an eye from"
"all the different cell types"
"but or a hand or anything else but one"
"of the uh"
"advantages of this for regenerative"
"medicine is that because these things"
"are actual subroutines"
"in the in the software of development"
"you can kickstart these things with very"
"simple triggers so very simple"
"low information content triggers will"
"kickstart very complex"
"outcomes because these are modular and"
"modulus can be recombined and they can"
"be moved around and they can be"
"connected up in different ways right so"
"i think i think i think that's that's"
"really important"
"um and and the fact that all this stuff"
"is is interoperable"
"so they all they all use the same"
"currency of of communication medium so"
"there are"
"conserved chemical and electrical and"
"biomechanical signals that all of these"
"things can"
"be used so they can all talk to each"
"other even in in"
"in you know different configurations and"
"uh yeah and that and that gives it"
"incredible plasticity so our bodies"
"in one sense is simply perhaps the"
"highest level of"
"homeostatic goal uh and there is lots of"
"homeostatic goals"
"at different levels in the body so again"
"coming back to the example of say"
"thermostat i mean thermostat homeostatic"
"goal is simple i mean it's one"
dimensional
"the temperature but we have just so much"
"of complexity in what"
"our bodies and different subunits"
"want to sort of achieve i mean again i"
"don't want to get into that preference"
"like you were saying but"
"uh it seems a very complex and"
"multi-dimensional so where is this"
"goal state really stored i mean in"
"thermo stat"
"example uh you could imagine one"
"dimensional state can be easily stored"
"but this seems almost too much"
"information yeah"
"yeah yeah um right so so so that's a"
"great question and"
"and i should by the way i should start"
"by saying i'm not sure even that the"
"body is the high that that the border of"
"a single body is the highest level of"
"of of organization because you know we"
"have swarms and colonies and uh"
"societies and so on who knows i'm not"
"even sure that that's the highest level"
"but uh but but but you asked a great"
"question which is that okay biologists"
"everybody knows about feedback loops and"
"homeostasis for scalars for single"
"numbers like like"
"temperature and ph and so on uh how do"
"you store the set point of a complex"
"organism so we only this so clearly we"
"only have the very beginnings"
"of any answer but i could tell you about"
"a simple um"
"uh a a simple kind of a set of"
"experiments that we did"
"to try to try to identify some of this"
"and so"
"one of the things for example uh that we"
"found and this was"
"was first seen by a colleague of mine"
"danny adams was in my lab at the time"
"and she"
"she uh took a uh bioelectric"
"map which means just using a chemical"
"that reveals voltage gradients it's a"
"it's a fluorescent dye that you put on"
"um you put on embryos or anything else"
"in it"
"the the the fluorescence pattern tells"
"you where all the different voltages are"
"so so she was observing craniofacial"
"development and"
"she found that um there was this thing"
"we call the electric face it's basically"
"long before the actual face is made and"
"before the genes come on that pattern"
"the face"
"that sort of blank uh skin that ectoderm"
"that that's going to become the face is"
"actually has a pattern there that if you"
"look at this pattern"
"you can sort of already decode it it's"
"easy to i'm talking about that one"
"because it's the easiest to decode"
"it it's almost directly it it almost"
"looks like a face"
"i mean you can see where the eyes are"
"going to be you can see where the mouth"
"is going to be there's a few other"
"things in there"
"so what we did was we tested the idea"
"that this was that this pattern was"
instructive
"meaning that it actually controlled the"
"development of the case it wasn't simply"
"a shadow or an epiphenomenon of other"
"things that were happening"
"and so we we very specifically altered"
"this bioelectric pattern and i want to"
"be clear we don't apply electric fields"
"so this is not about electrodes or"
"putting currents on things this is"
molecular
"physiology so we would open and close"
"the ion channels which are the"
"the electrical tiny little batteries"
"that the cells are actually using to"
"communicate with each other right"
"so we manipulated those and what you can"
"do is you can you can wipe out the"
normal
"uh bioelectric pattern that where the"
"eye is going to go and you can recreate"
"that pattern somewhere else"
"for example on the gut of the tablet and"
"if you recreate that pattern somewhere"
else
"we found out that the cells are using"
"that pattern to know what to build"
"and the cells will will look at that"
"pattern or detect that pattern"
"and that pattern apparently says make an"
"eye here and it calls the subroutine of"
"eye development and it triggers all of"
"the downstream"
"stuff that is needed to make an eye so"
"all the traditional eye genes you know"
pac-6
"rexlon all these things that are needed"
"to make an eye"
"they all turn on and you make an eye you"
"know and so"
"and so you start to see that that"
"electrical distribution"
"of um of of different"
"resting potentials in that in that"
"pattern was"
"was storing the pattern uh that that was"
"going to lead to"
"to to create the face and later on"
"we i think one of our best examples of"
"this where we actually can rewrite that"
"pattern memory is in planaria"
"so in these flat worms uh they have a"
"head and a tail and the amazing thing"
"about these flatworms is that you can"
"chop them into pieces and every piece"
"knows exactly what's missing and"
"restores exactly the missing tissue"
"at the back it'll make the tail at the"
"front it'll make the head they're all"
"scaled correctly all the right organs"
"and then it stops"
"okay so it has a very very you know"
"basically 100"
"uh fidelity of being able to re"
"regenerate a complete"
"worm and then it stops when the complete"
"worm is done so"
"studying that we noticed that and we"
"asked a very simple question"
"first we simply asked the question how"
"does it know how many heads to have"
"how does the piece know that it needs to"
"have one head rather than two or more"
"and so what we found is that there's"
"actually a very specific bioelectrical"
"pattern that is uh maintained that"
"uh determines where there's going to be"
"a head and where it's going to be a tail"
"and we were able to alter this pattern"
"and thus get two head worms or no"
"headworms and"
"various kinds of weird anatomical"
constructions
"but the amazing thing we found is that"
"this is a true memory in the sense that"
"if you alter that electrical pattern the"
"circuit that produces that pattern"
"keeps it it keeps the new pattern so"
"this is a little bit like"
"non-volatile ram in your computer and"
"and you know i"
"a lot of people hate the computer"
"analogies because of course living"
"things are not exactly like computers"
and
"sure enough but i think conceptually i"
"think this actually helps to understand"
it
"uh in a piece of ram in your computer"
"you can store multiple different"
"uh information values so zeros and ones"
"and so on"
"in the same piece of hardware right so"
"you don't need to rip out that memory or"
"rewire it you can you apply an"
"electrical current it shifts to a"
"particular value and it keeps as long as"
"the system is alive"
"it keeps that value until you come along"
"and rewrite it so this apparently these"
"worms apparently work the same way"
"there's this circuit that has reliably"
"by default it forms a pattern this is"
"one head one tail"
"but you can rewrite it and if you"
"rewrite it into a pattern that says two"
"heads one at each end"
"it will the cells will will obey that"
"that set point and they'll make a worm"
"with two heads"
"but they'll keep doing it so if you cut"
"pieces from that worm"
"you will again get two-headed planaria"
"even though the genetics are undisturbed"
"so every cell is completely wild type"
"the hardware is exactly the same but"
"what that hardware knows how to do"
"is it knows how to run an electric"
"circuit and use the information contents"
"of that"
"electric circuit to control morphology"
"and that circuit is amazing because it"
"actually stores the pattern long term"
"so we can now shift it we can shift it"
"from one header to two hands we can"
"shift it from two to one"
"and we've done other work on head shape"
"and other things but that's that i think"
"is our best example of"
"uh how information can be stored"
"that's that's not in the genome and i"
"should say"
"you know i should say that's not the"
only
"uh that's not the only example"
"originally the the you know people often"
"talk about epigenetics"
"and nowadays they mostly mean chromatin"
"modification right so these are"
"these are uh things that control gene"
"expression and so on"
"but with the original example of uh"
"epigenetics from"
"from you know probably 60 or or more"
"years ago now was a cytoskeleton"
"it was and it was found in single cells"
"like paramecium and sodium cells like"
this
"but if you cut with a little glass"
"needle and you imagine this you know"
"you're taking a single cell on somebody"
"with a glass needle cutting a little"
"square in the"
"you take that you take that little"
"square and you turn it around 180"
degrees
"and you can tell that you've done it"
"because because they have that whole"
"surface as these little hairs that are"
"pointed in one direction when you turn"
"it around the hairs are pointed in the"
"wrong way"
"so they found that all the offspring of"
the
"the the the fission offspring of that"
"of that creature they all had the little"
"square pointing the wrong way and so"
"and it wasn't in the genome there's"
"nothing wrong with the genome it was the"
"fact that"
"it was templating off of that"
"cytoskeleton to build the new"
"daughter cells each time and once you"
"make a change that process remembers"
"it's a kind of physical memory"
"so there are certainly other memories"
"than dna this has been known for you"
"know for a long time"
"um but this i think i think this by"
"electrical pattern is is particularly"
"interesting so clearly i mean we've been"
uh
"missing a lot if we just focus on dna as"
"the sole"
"storage and determiner of what organisms"
"have to become so um"
"so i'm sorry i just i just want to be"
"you know i just want to be clear"
"i'm in no way down on on dna okay the"
"science of"
"you know the signs of dna and molecular"
"biology and all that is really important"
"because we have to understand the"
"hardware and right if you actually the"
"the the thing about dna is that if you"
"actually read the genome"
"what you see is protein sequence you"
"don't directly see anything about"
"the length of your you know your body"
"and the symmetry type or any of that you"
"don't see any of that in there so so we"
"all know developmental biologists know"
that
"there's a lot more to being to to being"
"able to"
"understand where anatomy comes from"
"right but but"
"you know dna is critical because you"
"have to understand your hardware if you"
"don't understand your hardware"
"the rest of this is also going to be"
"incomplete i just want to be on the"
"record that"
"you know i'm not suggesting we replace"
"in any way uh you know the dna"
"paradigm but i think we need to add to"
"it in a significant way exactly"
"yeah so it's not obviously dna or"
"something else it's dna"
"or something else is it fair to say um"
"that as far as reprogramming bodies are"
concerned
"we have to find like a particular level"
"of intervention"
"i mean when when we naively think about"
"biology we think"
"everything has to be done at the dna"
level
"to affect the biology but what you're"
"suggesting is this different level of"
subroutines
"in biology and we just have to find the"
"right level and trigger it to get"
"what we ultimately want uh to happen"
"yeah yeah i think i think that is"
"absolutely essential i think i think"
"you know in our lifetimes we are not"
"going to"
"uh have the kinds of uh regenerative"
technologies
"based on molecular intervention that get"
"you what you"
"want you know the resolution to"
"traumatic injury birth defects"
"cancer aging in our lifetime that's not"
"going to be done bottom up"
"we have to find the most efficient level"
"at which to control the outcome"
"and there are some very nice i mean this"
"has been argued in philosophy for a long"
"time but there's actually some nice new"
"math available"
"where people are actually doing new"
"information theory to show that in many"
systems
"the most efficient level of of"
"interaction is not the lowest level so"
"you know"
"you know see think about um"
"sorry by efficient what did you mean"
"well by efficient"
"it means uh the the the ability to reach"
"a desired outcome with"
"the least effort so so you know so so we"
"could in"
"in theory right you could make any type"
"of body structure you want by placing"
"every atom or every cell exactly where"
"it needs to go"
"and maybe someday but that's in our"
"lifetime that's not going to happen the"
"the much"
"much better strategy for us is to learn"
"to exploit"
"the software the modularity the"
"intelligence of this uh collective"
"so we can motivate cell groups to to"
"build whatever we want them to build and"
"push offload that computational"
"complexity onto them"
"right not try to micromanage it i think"
"certainly in in the in the near term"
"that's the only way we're going to get"
"to good regenerative medicine"
"when i when i talk about the these the"
"idea of levels to my students"
"i i often give them this example so"
"um we're here trying to reverse engineer"
"these animals"
"and plants and so on figure out how they"
"work so you're you're an engineer and"
"somebody hands you"
"a device that's uh it's one of these uh"
"chess playing computers right it's just"
"place chess that's what it does"
"but you don't know that you have no idea"
"what it is so"
"you could of course uh spend all your"
"time focused on"
"the silicon and the electromagnetic"
"fields that you measure inside of this"
"thing and the molecules of copper"
"and in theory if you you know if you"
"if you um had unlimited time by the time"
"you know sort of the universe"
"uh comes to a crashing hall uh you might"
"be able to predict what it's going to do"
next
"by following maxwell's equations from"
"the magnetic you know like"
"electromagnetic states and following"
"every every uh every every electron as"
it
"travels down the copper and and maybe"
"from that low level perspective at some"
"point you'll make some"
"some predictions about what it's going"
"to do okay but a"
"that would take forever we don't have"
"that any we don't have time like that"
"and b"
"um you would be none the wiser about uh"
"about what it was actually doing which"
"is playing chess and the reason that's"
"important i mean some people is you know"
"people who are real reductionists and"
"i'm not sure how many"
"people have real reductions but but a"
"real reductionist might say"
"well it doesn't matter there's no such"
"thing as chess all there is is electrons"
"you know moving according to the laws of"
uh
"physics and and i think that's deeply"
"wrong because if you don't know"
"if you miss that level then the next"
"time somebody shows you a wooden"
chessboard
"which has nothing physical in common"
"with that device"
"you will you will completely miss the"
"fact that hey actually there's something"
"very very deep"
"there's a symmetry here they have"
"something very deeply in common but not"
"at the level of physics at the level of"
"physics they have nothing in common"
"and the process of two people playing"
"chess by mail where they you know they"
"take turns scribbling things on paper"
"and sending each other's letters right"
"there's something very very profoundly"
um
"similar between that and this computer"
"that plays chess but at the level of"
"physics you will never find it yeah it's"
"not at the lowest level"
"so so right and so so so what else what"
"other choice do you have well"
"you might be able to if you actually"
"understood what this thing was doing at"
"a higher level"
"then you would have these weird concepts"
"like it wants to dominate the"
"middle of the board and it wants to"
"protect the king and it wants to get"
"your king and"
"whatever else you try to do in chess"
"these are concepts that don't exist at"
"lower levels and so if you're"
"if you're traditional materials you say"
"there is no such thing but i think we"
"can't afford to do that for regenerative"
"medicine i think we have to"
"figure out what are the goal states that"
"the the system that we're given that our"
bodies
"uh are able to represent and we need to"
"uh learn to manipulate those"
"at higher levels right so on the topic"
"of regenerative medicine i mean first"
"regenerative medicine just as a"
definition
"uh am i correct in saying that it's uh"
"sort of like if"
"we cut a finger or injure our body how"
"do we get"
"to our default uh state uh"
"all by itself i mean that's that's"
"certainly a part of it a part of it is"
about
"uh healing from injuries and inducing"
"you know uh in in inducing the"
"the cells and tissues to to natively"
"rebuild whatever was there"
"and we have some great examples right so"
"salamanders you know the axolotl the"
"mexican axolotl"
"um that that that animal regenerates its"
"limbs its eyes its jaws"
"portions of the brain it heals spinal"
"cord injuries it"
"you know it's incredible right it"
"regenerates all these throughout its"
"lifespan it will"
"you know uh if you have the salamanders"
"in um if you have these axolotls in the"
"tank they'll routinely bite each other's"
"legs off"
"and in a couple months the leg is back"
"and it's perfect and it works and"
"everything's fine"
"uh they they're highly regenerated so"
"that's what we want to get to right"
"that's part of regenerative medicine but"
"it's actually much deeper than that"
because
"if we had the ability to"
"induce cells cellular collectives to"
"build whatever we wanted them to build"
"we actually would have the solution to"
"to to very many biological problems"
"pretty much everything except"
"infectious disease hangs on the idea of"
"uh being able to tell cells what they're"
"going to build so"
"birth defects it's not just injury but"
"birth defects meaning from mutations and"
"then we've shown some examples of that"
"in our lab"
"teratogens uh cancer so we can talk"
"about cancer as disorders of"
"morphogenesis actually"
"uh aging uh degenerative disease all of"
"these kinds of things would be overcome"
"if we had a reliable ability to tell"
"cells what to build"
"and that requires us to know how do they"
"decide what to build in the first place"
"and to focus on the software and then"
"the decision making of these agents not"
"just the mechanism by which they do it"
"right it sounds like the holy grail"
where
"you're able to program bodies just like"
"you program computers"
"to do anything uh how far have we come"
"along there"
"obviously uh we've not come to"
"uh we're not nowhere near the similar"
state
"as we are in computers but is that like"
"a fantasy or"
"do you see it actually become becoming a"
reality
"yeah um i i the the the"
"the bad news is that uh living things"
are
"are so much more complex than our"
"hardware that they're harder to program"
"the good news is that they've had to"
"evolve to be able to program themselves"
"and so they already have uh some very"
"nice structures that make them easy to"
program
"so there's kind of this balance and so"
"so if we can if we can discover that"
"i don't think it's a fantasy at all i"
"think i think it's absolutely real"
"how much of it we're going to see in our"
"lifetime i think we will we will"
"we've already seen some important"
"advances i think there will be"
"real um you know killer apps in this"
"space things like"
"limb regeneration tumor reprogramming"
"and so on i i think we will"
"we will see that you know i think that"
"will be in the next couple of decades i"
"think we're going to see those things"
but
"i don't have a crystal ball so i can't i"
"can't tell you how the research is going"
"to go but"
"um i don't think it's a fantasy and i"
"think long term"
"you know when when i give talks one of"
"the first slides is i say what are we"
"trying to do here what's the end game"
"you know"
"when can we all go home and say we're"
"done and the first thing that i show"
"is what i call an anatomical compiler so"
"i think we need to get to the point"
"where you can sit down and you can draw"
"using a cad like tool right like like we"
"draw you know car parts and things you"
"should be able to sit down and you"
"should be able to draw"
"the kind of animal plant that you want"
"at the anatomical level"
"and much like with computers where you"
"where you draw these things and you"
"don't worry about"
"uh where the atoms of each thing are"
"going to go and what they you know"
"you you you specify at the large scale"
"and then the compiler"
"can give you the low level right events"
"that need to happen for this to take"
place
"the same thing so you should be able to"
"say okay i want something that's kind of"
"like a frog but i wanted to have six"
"legs and i'd like it to have a you know"
a
"head that looks like this and the tail"
"and whatever else and"
"once we know what we're doing the system"
"should be able to"
"go from that description to a set of"
"stimuli that it would give"
"to cells to cause them to undergo"
"morphogenesis for that that's our"
"that's our agreement you know and are"
"are we going to get to to see the full"
"sort of general version of that uh"
"probably not"
"but but specific examples of that i"
"think are absolutely coming"
"yeah right and this programmer"
"or a compiler will not just give us"
"ability to heal"
"but it will also give us the ability to"
"create living machines"
"and we've been working uh on things"
"called xenobots which are"
"v point zero one of uh what you are"
"describing so can you tell more about"
"what are they"
"and how do you see them sort of evolving"
"from here"
"sure sure yeah um the xenobots and the"
"reason they're called zenobots is"
"because the initial"
"uh ones that we made were were made from"
"cells from the frog"
"called xenopus lavis and so and they're"
"biobots so we call them zenobots"
"uh it was really an effort and this is"
"this is done uh"
"in collaboration um with our our"
"colleagues at the university of vermont"
"josh bongard"
"um in his lab and uh"
"the the important thing about about"
"these zenobots is that they're a first"
"example of a"
"of a much bigger emerging field uh that"
"are basically uh synthetic organisms"
"and the idea is this is this is"
"different from synthetic biology where"
"you're moving dna between different"
"bacteria and things like this"
"this is this is really uh designing new"
"new bodies along with new cognitive"
"capacities that these different bodies"
"are going to have and"
"the idea is sure we'll make some useful"
"synthetic living machines and they'll do"
"things like you know"
"clean up the environment and chase down"
"cancer cells in your body and you know"
"scrape plaque off your arteries and"
"things like this"
"but but the deeper issue is that if we"
"understood morphogenesis well enough"
"to make bespoke organisms designed to a"
"particular anatomical and"
"behavioral spec then all the problems of"
"regenerative medicine would be solved"
"and you could you know you could build"
"and improve"
"um biological structures at will and so"
"for the zenobots now now one simple"
"question there"
"was even is is there even any plasticity"
"i mean people talk"
"often about developmental constraints"
"meaning that look you're a you're a"
"zebrafish cell"
"what could you make by the zebrafish"
"right that's the kind of the standard"
assumption
"and so um uh and and we before even"
"before the zenobots we've had some some"
interesting
"uh data on on making uh"
"you know planarians with head shapes"
"that belong to different species of"
"plenary without touching the genome and"
basically
"accessing different regions of that"
"amorphous space bioelectrically but"
"um we we just asked the simple questions"
"okay if we take some cells in particular"
"some skin cells from"
"a frog an early you know an early slog"
"frog larva we take some some of those"
"skin cells and we"
"let them re reboot their"
"multicellularity we can we"
"let them sort of get together in a"
"different environment away from the rest"
"we liberate them from the rest of the"
animal
"uh we say okay you're on your own"
"there's a group of you what do you want"
"to do"
"and there's a bunch of possibilities"
"right so one possibility is that they"
"just died because they're single cells"
"and they don't go on"
"there's a there's a there's a scenario"
"where well maybe they just make a flat"
"monolayer where they were live in cell"
"culture every cell for itself"
"is you know reproducing as fast as they"
"can maybe it would might make a tumor"
"you know there's all kinds of"
possibility
"um what they actually do is something"
"much more interesting than that"
"than that they they they really do uh"
undergo
"multicellularity in the sense that they"
"um they call us they combine"
"they come together they signal to each"
"other and they form a new creature"
"and this new creature uh why do i call"
"it a creature it"
"it has a very defined anatomy it has"
"behavior so it has the ability to move"
"around it has various behavioral"
"repertoires it can do certain things"
"um and the cool thing about this"
"creature is that it doesn't look like a"
"tackle doesn't look like a frog"
"it doesn't you know it doesn't look like"
"like like anything you"
"really would have would have predicted"
"um it has a standard frog genome"
"so one way i i often give talks about"
"about these things is i see"
"i show you know 10 or 20 slides of"
"videos of these things running around"
"and doing various things and changing"
"their shape and healing from damage and"
"you know interacting with each other and"
"interacting with things in their"
"environment and they say"
"what do you think this is and and people"
"say well it's you found it in a pond"
"somewhere it's some sort of"
"you know some sort of underwater"
"creature and i said well we have the"
genome
"no there's a genome that's that's great"
"let's sequence the genome and we'll see"
"you know we'll see what we learned well"
"the genome is 100 fraud it's 100"
"so this tells you right away a couple of"
"interesting things it tells you that"
"cells have incredible plasticity"
"that they like working together to to"
"build things but it doesn't necessarily"
"have to be the default thing that they"
"normally build"
"so in novel environments they can build"
"other things that are"
"coherent um adaptive structures so these"
"things that"
"these these xenobots uh they don't look"
"like a mess they they"
"they look like a creature that might"
"exist they it's just a completely"
"different body plane but it's it's"
"perfectly serviceable for what they do"
"which is getting around and so on"
"um so that's that's one thing the the"
"other interesting thing to think about"
"is that usually"
"when when you're looking at some sort of"
"organism and somebody asks the question"
"okay why does this thing see green light"
"or why does it have wings or why does it"
"jump or whatever it says"
"the answer is always the same well"
"because for millions of years its"
"ancestors were rewarded for this or that"
"and so it has this long selection"
"history towards a very specific outcome"
okay
"the cool thing about these zenobots and"
"these i should say these intervals are"
just
"the first steps of a field of of this"
"new field of computer"
"designed organisms that are going to be"
"uh new model systems beyond the standard"
"you know zebrafish"
"frog mouse you know whatever that people"
"have been working with there's an"
"incredible option space for new types of"
bodies
"and the thing about these these zenobots"
"is that"
"they don't have a selection an"
"evolutionary uh selection history on"
"earth back on earth"
"they were they were created they they"
"create themselves in 48 hours in front"
"of your eyes"
"and now the individual cells of course"
"do have a selection history as being"
"part of frogs"
"but they were selected for the property"
"of sitting quietly on the outside of a"
"frog and keeping out the bacteria and"
fungus
"they were not selected to have this"
"amazing property of running around and"
"doing various things"
"so that shows you this incredible"
"plasticity and it shows you that"
"uh we need a better way of understanding"
"and predicting"
"goals and capabilities when there isn't"
"a neat evolutionary backstory about"
"where everything comes from"
"because it can it can arise de novo from"
"scratch and so so that leaves us with a"
"very interesting question"
"where do they actually come from so the"
"body plan information"
"uh certainly you i mean it's it's"
"people are often uh you know kind of"
"surprised by this about the fact that"
"you can't read this out of the genome"
"right when you read the genome"
"there's just frog you can't read this"
"new information however"
"what's often not talked about is that"
"you actually can't read out"
"the original frog shape from the genome"
"either we have no idea how to do that"
"what we can do is compare that genome to"
"other animals that we"
"do know what they look like but that's"
"cheating what we really want to want to"
"do is be able to look at something"
"um at the mechanistic level and say okay"
"i can i can figure out what shape this"
"is going to be and we don't have that"
"ability yet"
"so uh you know i think i think this this"
"these these zenobots"
"in addition to potentially being useful"
"of living machines"
"they give us the the ability to really"
"uh they force us in fact to"
"to really reconsider uh our uh i mean"
some
"deep questions about where body planes"
"come from and you know how physics"
"information and uh and genetics all"
"interact to determine what's possible"
"for a living organism"
"right so could you change what these you"
"know bots uh"
"shapes end up becoming or do they just"
"self-assemble into"
"specific shapes yeah we're working on"
"that now so the two papers that that"
"have come out one last year and one just"
"came out"
"this tuesday i think uh in in those"
"papers we're just characterizing what"
"these things do naturally"
"because because i think it's really"
"important so so it's funny um when"
[Music]
"we made the choice to focus initially on"
"what they do completely naturally with"
"very little"
"manipulation from the outside you know"
"we could throw in new genes and we can"
"throw in nano materials and and do all"
"kinds of stimulation and then we will"
"and we are"
"we're doing all that um but the but but"
"you know when you do that people say"
"people will say that's a fine example of"
bioengineering
"and you've made them do something very"
"unnatural and"
"and okay that's great that's synthetic"
"living machines but people say but it"
"has nothing that that doesn't mimic in"
"vivo and that doesn't have anything to"
"do with evolution whatever"
"okay so we wanted to start with a much"
"with with a really a much more"
"foundational point you know there's lots"
"of there's there's been other biobots"
"not of this type of there have been"
"other biobots in the field as examples"
"of bioengineering you know kind of"
"precisely bottom-up control um"
"uh what i wanted to do here was say"
"this is native this is endogenous"
"plasticity look at all the things these"
"these guys are already doing before we"
"even really"
"did much to them at all and especially"
"the second paper the first one had a"
"little bit of sculpting in it guided by"
the
"um by the by the uh computer evolution"
"which is cool because"
"in that case their evolutionary history"
"didn't happen on earth it happened in a"
"virtual world in the bond guard labs um"
"you know"
"uh virtual environment right all the"
"evolution took place there they"
literally
"evolved uh these things uh and then we"
"made them you know physically real in"
"the second paper that just came out"
"there wasn't even uh that degree of"
"manipulation is completely emerging"
"and i think it was very important to me"
"to to nail that down first"
"so that people can see this as"
"spontaneous uh meaning"
"natural plasticity not just you know a"
"weird trick of bioengineering"
"but the next step of course is"
"programming them so the next step is"
"going to be"
"what kind of stimuli can we give these"
"cells you know maybe they'll need"
"um new uh synthetic biology circuits in"
"in dna maybe they won't"
"um we don't know you know we need to"
"figure out what preferences they have we"
"need to figure out um"
"what learning they can do you know"
"simple or complex or what"
"um and then and then we're absolutely"
"going to start programming the shape"
"right i mean it just seems like you said"
"it's early stages but you could"
"very well imagine a couple of decades or"
"maybe more"
"ahead where you are programming a much"
"more complex"
"organism and you say i want this and"
"there is"
"some automated machine that ends up"
"recreating that organism and"
"particularly your comment on"
"if evolution on computer is is just"
"mind-blowing because they just don't"
share
"the natural history and we can make them"
"do whatever we want to"
"yeah yeah yeah absolutely and we're"
"already working on that we're working on"
uh
"automating this process so that it's"
"both high throughput and"
"directly linked to the digital evolution"
"that that happens"
"um you know in in silico um and"
"my interest is to open up this"
"incredible option space of new bodies"
"that are combination i mean already"
"right so some of this already exists we"
"have people with all kinds of"
"smart implants and people who drive"
"wheelchairs and other things with"
"with you know they're directly with"
"their mind so they're directly hooked"
into
"physical devices and we have other"
"robots that are that are"
"instrumentized with living cells on them"
"and things like this so so this merger"
"of biology and technology"
"is kind of starting but i think we"
"really need to"
"uh expand the model systems that we have"
"beyond standard"
"you know zebrafish frog and you know um"
"axolotl and"
"drosophila whatever there's this"
"incredible option space of new animals"
"and plants that no one has ever seen"
before
"and we need theories that can handle"
"that they're not just tied to specific"
"model systems"
"right i think we want something of an"
"equivalent of like a fortran pascal or"
basic
"to start like programming these systems"
"the anatomical compiler that you're"
suggesting
"yeah that's true and i think it'll go in"
"both directions in the sense that once"
"we understand how"
"the uh how the biological uh software"
works
"i think one of the coolest things we'll"
"be able to do is actually uh"
"copy that or or adapt it to uh for"
"machine learning for robotics for swarm"
"robotics for"
"uh you know various kind of engineered"
"artifacts because i think"
"uh there are there's lots here that that"
"it's not it's not just from the computer"
"science to the regenerative medicine"
"which is a lot of what we've been"
"talking about here it also goes the"
"other way around"
"so i you know i've given a talk called"
"why robots don't get cancer"
"and the idea is to really think about"
"this uh multi-scale competency"
"as a new architecture for for robots and"
"for machine learning that that really"
"builds on how biology does things"
"okay so dr levin i wanted to ask"
"something that must be sort of"
"asked you uh multiple times but i'm"
"going to ask anyway"
"it's about ethics uh how do you handle"
"ethical dilemmas you know which"
"inevitably crop up when you're working"
with
"uh intelligent and maybe likely"
"conscious multicellular organisms"
"how do you make that trade off yeah um"
"yeah that's that's that's a very"
"important question"
"and i think uh the thing to uh to really"
"uh keep in mind"
"is that uh it is completely"
"unconscionable to uh to to not do"
research
"that uh ends up uh helping uh in in"
"medical uh medical outcomes"
"so i get phone calls every week from"
"people with kids with birth defects with"
"accidents spinal cord"
"damage uh you know amputated limbs"
"whatever you name it you know i get"
"these phone calls people are absolutely"
"desperate for help"
"and their question to me is always"
"number one hurry up"
"they're you know they say what what's"
"taking you so long i you know i'm"
"reading papers about frogs and worms"
"yeah that's fine when when can i come in"
"and and you know and get my kids uh"
"whatever um"
"healed and so what you really have to"
"think about is the opportunity cost of"
"not doing this kind of work"
"or slowing down this kind of work you"
"know i've heard it i've heard it before"
"that oh man uh you know"
"what this is this is scary me you know"
"maybe you shouldn't do it okay"
"that that all comes from from healthy"
"young people who who don't know what"
"children's hospitals are for and you"
"know and"
"and why uh why medicine exists it's um"
"i think i think it's it's it's a morally"
"untenable view"
"to uh to slow down experiments with with"
"frog skin and things like this"
"if it's going to slow down um"
"the relief of suffering to i don't have"
"these stats but but you can imagine how"
"many people if you add up cancer and"
"birth defects and"
"you know degenerative disease and"
"everything else we we need to be working"
"on this as fast as we possibly can"
"not not to mention so that's that's the"
"biomedical side"
"the other side of this is that uh"
"i actually think it's an existential"
"risk for society as a whole"
"to uh fail to understand"
"how um goals and preferences arise"
"because we for sure in our lifetime we"
"are going to be uh"
"we kind of already are but even more so"
"we are going to be um"
"inundated with swarms of all kinds"
"you know software swarms like the"
"internet um internet of things"
"you know swarm robotics this stuff this"
"stuff is not going anywhere there's no"
"avoiding it it's going to be here"
"we do not have a mature science of"
"tracking where"
"goals come from in swarm agents we have"
"no idea"
"so you put something together maybe you"
"understand the individual pieces"
"but the collective what is it going to"
"want what are going to be the"
"homeostatic states that it's going to"
"exert energy to"
"to uh to achieve you don't have any"
"ideas and if we don't know how to um how"
"to control it and predict it"
"we are in big trouble and i think"
"these kinds of these kinds of"
"experiments are a sandbox"
"in which to take very sophisticated"
"agents these cells"
"and ask fine can we learn how to predict"
"and then control"
"what the collective is going to try to"
"do so i think human flourishing"
"absolutely requires science i think"
"there's no way around that we don't have"
"any other way"
"of of improving um uh the welfare of"
everybody
"and uh if you want regenerative medicine"
"and you want to uh survive"
"uh the coming technology as a society to"
uh
"survive the technological changes that"
"are coming we the this this kind of work"
"i don't just mean my work i mean all"
this
"you know the feel the community the"
"things that everybody's doing are"
essential
"it is simply unconscionable um to uh to"
"slow this down"
"i agree i mean yeah i mean whenever we"
"talk about ethics"
"i think we always look at the one side"
"but there's always the other side"
"in the sense of what who is it going to"
benefit
"but we always look at the scary parts"
"and media doesn't help"
"when it just focuses on the isolated"
incidents
"and never mentions all the benefits that"
"come out of such research"
"absolutely and i mean of course of"
"course there's oversight and everything"
"we do"
"uh even with with frogs you know there's"
"a million um"
"permits that we need to get as far as"
"ethics boards and and whatever so"
"there's there's already an existing"
"structure that oversees all of this kind"
"of stuff"
"including experiments that other people"
"do with mice and"
"uh you know and and and so on uh"
"but the thing is uh people often"
"the the calculation that that people"
"often do in their heads is this"
"um well everything's great now and then"
"if we do something"
"you know bad and scary it'll make things"
"worse so let's not do that but but"
"that's a completely false dichotomy"
because
"things are not great now we have we have"
"massive unmet needs and"
"uh not not taking efforts to make things"
better
"is uh is is is as bad as making things"
worse
"you know we don't live in this paradise"
"where we just need to make sure we don't"
"screw it up that's not"
"where that's not the world we live in we"
"have massive disparities"
"in in healthcare both both economically"
"and in terms of"
"quality of life and this this needs to"
"be addressed we can't afford to just sit"
"there and hope we don't mess things up"
"we're not in that good"
"shape right so uh dr levin i wanted to"
"spend last bit"
"of a conversation around scientific"
"creativity and as a meta topic"
"you have your lab and your group and"
"your research is just amazing source of"
"so many"
"great insights it's almost seem like you"
"know it's a bedrock of"
"how biology will evolve from here on"
"how do you i mean i know it's very broad"
"but how do you get or enable"
"this sort of creativity within yourself"
and
"amongst the students that you work with"
"and is it a teachable skill"
"yeah um interesting question uh well i"
"think i think it is a teachable skill"
"i think that like any other skill people"
come
"to it with different baseline levels of"
"talent and then from there you can sort"
"of improve"
"uh i think it is teachable for myself"
"i use a variety of techniques"
"one one thing that uh that i do is i"
"i sort of read pretty widely so um"
"you know i i try to make sure that i'm"
"looking at problems from multiple"
"perspectives i mean i think that's"
"uh you know lots of people know about"
"that uh"
"where i ask how do you know how does"
"this certain problem look like from the"
"perspective of a physicist a computer"
"scientist uh"
"you know a biologist i try not to stick"
"and and it's funny"
"when when i give a talk about these"
"things you know so so i have an"
hour-long
"talk that i give to to professional"
"audiences um"
"i always know what kind of department"
"i'm in based on which part of the talk"
"makes people angry"
"and it's a different part of the talk"
"every time because"
"certain things you can say in one"
"department are completely obvious"
"and if you say those things in another"
"department people throw tomatoes because"
"it sounds ridiculous"
"and these are new these are departments"
"that might might work on the same floor"
"of a research institution and so it's"
"clear that"
"uh we're very siloed still in the sense"
of
"uh in the sense of um conceptually right"
"which which things"
"are ways to think about problems and and"
"things that are"
"considered weird versus versus obvious"
"so uh so so what do i do i try to i try"
"to read widely so that um i have"
"different perspectives"
"on on the problem um another thing i try"
"to do is i really try to"
"have a cyclical process of"
"alternating sort of unconstrained"
"creativity and"
"uh logic and heart influence so that you"
"have periods where where you're working"
"or thinking about a problem"
"where you say okay during this time i'm"
"going to really get wild"
"and kind of think it's you know as far"
"outside the box i'm going to question"
"all my assumptions i'm going to take"
"things that uh that we pretty much"
"assume and i'm going to say okay if"
"that's wrong"
"what then what are the implications"
"right if we assume assume assuming that"
"that's actually completely wrong what"
"does it mean and so so you do these"
"these kind of"
"creativity exercises and then you get"
"some ideas now it's time"
"for the for the rigor and then you test"
"them very you know sort of very"
"rigorously and"
"it's okay is there any value to this"
"actually or was it nonsense"
"and uh and and so you go through a"
"period of that and then you get some"
"some results and you learn"
"some things you fail a lot maybe you get"
"a maybe you have a success somewhere"
"and uh then you go back then you go back"
"around and you say fine now now knowing"
"what i know now"
"let's do the creative phase again and"
"let's just brainstorm about different"
"ways to look at this"
"and how can i take things that i've"
"heard uh in other"
"um in in other fields and i can where"
"like one one very important um tool that"
"i use is i look for symmetries"
"and i look for um you know my early work"
"was in left right asymmetry i love"
"i love symmetry i always look for"
"symmetries and things isomorphisms so"
"can i take things that exist in one"
field
"and map them on to my field and some"
"things will map and some things won't"
"and then i take things and then i look"
"at the things that don't map and i say"
"what might be there that we just haven't"
"found yet right with the gaps"
"if if now the symmetry might be bad and"
"then you throw it away eventually but if"
"it's good"
"the places where it doesn't map that's a"
"that's a pointer to things you haven't"
"found yet because maybe there is"
"something there"
"um i'll give you a very simple example"
"it's an exercise that i've done with"
"some of my students"
"i say take a paper uh in the"
"neuroscience field"
"i have paper on the brain and"
"neuroscience uh put it into"
"uh import it into microsoft word and do"
"a find and replace function"
"and you take every every time it says"
"neuron you replace that with cell"
"and every time it says milliseconds you"
"replace that with hour"
"and and then you read the paper and see"
"if you can learn anything about"
"developmental bioelectricity from that"
"and so then you then then what happens"
"is you read these things you say"
"oh my god of course we have this in in"
development
"and we we have that too we have this"
"this other thing that's going on here"
"yeah of course we have that"
"and so these kind of you know these kind"
"of symmetries right making that making"
"that pivot"
"um that that's a that's that's a"
"favorite technique is just"
"is to take see and and many and"
"sometimes it doesn't work if the analogy"
"is bad it just"
"you know then it's bad nothing comes"
"with it but but we've had really good"
"luck with that kind of thing and that's"
"what i try to teach my students that's"
"what um"
"that's the kind of so you're importing"
"uh these"
"patterns of thoughts and mental models"
"from various fields"
"from neuroscience from physics from"
"computer science from machine learning"
"but i think people i mean people who"
"specialize in one field and"
"they sometimes argue that it's hard to"
"read so widely"
"so uh because there's just infinite"
"complexity in"
"any field that you may want to read"
"about so is there sort of like a"
"tactic or a strategy or a thumb rule you"
"use that"
"this is enough for because computer"
"science in itself could be infinite uh"
"infinitely large"
"the literature yeah yeah every i mean"
"everything is an infinite literature and"
"i have a massive stack of papers i"
"haven't gotten to yet of course so"
there's
"there's never yeah i don't have any"
"magic i don't have any way of of making"
"that manageable"
"inevitably the the challenge is is uh"
"is bigger than any of us can practically"
"muster however"
"um just because you can't do everything"
"doesn't mean you can't do something so"
"you can make"
"you can still make progress and one"
other
"sort of tool that i um i teach my"
students
"is uh to really hone your intuition and"
"this is just it takes practice"
"uh about what's essential and what's not"
"so so if you get a and this this um"
"we very clearly see these examples so i"
"have a lot of computation in"
"my group we have all kinds of people we"
"have biologists we have computational"
"you know programs whatever"
"and uh and and you can see this right"
"away when"
"when you hand a biology paper to the"
"computer scientists see computer"
"scientists actually very good at this"
"they're very good at um"
"uh uh compartmentalizing and coarse"
"graining things in a logical way and"
"trying to figure out okay what are the"
"details here that matter and don't"
matter
"and so my job i'm sort of the uh the the"
"kind of transformer that sits between"
"all these different disciplines in the"
"group and i try to"
"make sure that they're all talking to"
"each other when i give someone a paper"
"i will i will help them i will say look"
"this is a 25-page paper"
"you don't need 90 of the information"
"that's in here you don't need that"
"here's what you here's what this paper"
"is saying that you need to dig into and"
"you need to understand so to the extent"
"that and of course sometimes i'm wrong"
"and i miss things i mean that's just you"
"know this is never"
"going to be perfect but um the goal is"
"to go through all this and not get"
"bogged down into the details"
"and to really that makes the literature"
"a lot more manageable because you're"
"asking yourself"
"for any given thing you're trying to"
"read what what what actually is the core"
"here that's important what am i going to"
"import from this"
"that i can use somewhere else and what"
"are just uh irrelevant details that are"
"never going to matter"
"and and if you can get good at doing"
"that um"
"then then it makes things a lot more"
"manageable but i'm not going to pretend"
"there's some magic that where you can"
use
"all of the inside of any of these fields"
"you just you bite off as much as you can"
"that's all right right uh this this is"
"great uh dr levin and it's been"
"great chatting with you uh i i hope that"
"uh you know you and your group are able"
"to accelerate uh"
"towards this universal and and living"
"creature compiler so that"
"uh we heal all sorts of diseases it just"
"seems talking to you"
"and understanding all the resource that"
"this seems a very pivotal moment in"
history
"and um i i wish you know we are able to"
realize
"all the vision you have uh in reality"
"well thank you very much i appreciate"
"that i think you're right i think this"
"is an incredibly interesting time i i'm"
"super pleased to be part of it to be"
"able to work with"
"uh the many many people i mean you know"
"you and i have talked to"
"you know for an hour but this is the"
"stuff that we've been talking about is"
"the the product of the hard work of lots"
"of people not"
"of course outside but also in my group"
"you know post-docs and students and"
"uh and everybody else uh it's it's a"
"huge uh"
"you know kind of group effort in society"
"and i'm"
"super pleased to be part of it i think i"
"think we're going to see amazing things"
"in the next couple of decades"
"indeed uh thank you once again for your"
"time and all the best"
"for your research very good thank you so"
much
"have a great day bye"
you
