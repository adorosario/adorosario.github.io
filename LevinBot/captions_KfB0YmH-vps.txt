"thank you both for being here I did an"
"extensive introduction to both of you on"
"the previous conversation so I'm going"
"to put that in the show notes and we can"
"save that time today for a conversation"
um
"in our last talk together at the end uh"
"Dr Psalms mentioned that he was going to"
"talk about his new project of artificial"
"Consciousness and I know that was"
"something that that Dr Levin was very"
"interested in and from now on I'm going"
"to call you Mark and Mike so that I"
"don't get myself confused"
"um so um a couple of things"
"um Mark I noticed that you had mentioned"
"in uh in the previous episode that"
"affect is what you see as the"
"fundamental aspect of consciousness"
"and you also mentioned in your book that"
"unless it is possible to make a"
"conscious machine we will not have"
"solved the hard problem of consciousness"
"so I know that's part of what you're"
"working on and then Mike you had"
"mentioned that that"
"um you're looking at this new"
"um recasting of physics to to perhaps"
"see cognitive systems as a specific kind"
"of predictive interaction with the"
"outside world"
"so I thought we might kind of explore"
"that in the context of what Mark is"
"going to tell us about artificial"
"Consciousness does that sound okay"
"sure sounds great okay let's go with it"
"then Mark why don't you start"
"thanks well thanks very much car and"
"I'll start with the the things that you"
"just said"
"um that uh that I said uh namely that"
um
"well well in fact I what I had in mind"
"was Richard feynman's uh famous"
"statement which was found on the"
"Blackboard uh after he died so it's not"
"exactly his last words but something"
"close to that he said if I can't create"
"it I don't understand it"
"um and I agree with that I think that if"
"you're going to claim to understand the"
"causal mechanism whereby sentient"
"whereby Consciousness arises then you"
"should be able to engineer that"
mechanism
"um that I think is the ultimate test"
"of a mechanistic account of"
consciousness
"so it's uh for that reason uh that we"
"have I unders and the small team of"
"colleagues I better quickly mention uh"
"them so as to be fair it's not me alone"
"um the the team is headed by me and"
"Jonathan shock"
"um who's a physicist"
"and um and computer scientists and then"
"the other senior members of the team are"
"Bruce Bassett a physicist and computer"
"scientist Benjamin Rossman a roboticist"
"um Ryan Smith a neuroscientist and and"
computational
"um uh is sort of I don't know what to"
"call him computational mental scientist"
"um and um"
"uh who's a roboticist and and and we've"
"had a student Rowan Hodson who's been"
"sort of at the at the coal face doing"
"doing this work"
"so the other thing that you mentioned"
"was that I believe that that affect um"
"is the fundamental or Elemental uh"
"foundational form of consciousness"
"and so so I I have to start there in"
"order to explain uh the project that we"
"are working on"
"um you know the the quest to identify a"
"neural correlate of Consciousness"
"um famously associated with Francis"
"Quick's work in the 90s with the quest"
"of it focused mainly on visual"
consciousness
"and and and and therefore on visual"
"cortex this was the sort of model"
"example if we can identify the neural"
"correlative visual Consciousness"
"um then we will have uh a basis for"
"generalizing from there to other forms"
"of Consciousness that that's that's"
"pretty much been this the kind of"
"mainstream approach I don't mean that"
"all of the work has been uh on Vision"
but
"um it has all been on cortical processes"
"um and and and for the most part"
"perceptual processes and I and I thought"
"that's the wrong place to start and I"
"don't have time to go into all of the"
"details as to why I believe it's the"
"wrong place to start so I'll just say"
"um two things the one is that cortical"
"visual processing carries on perfectly"
"well I don't mean perfectly but"
"perfectly well"
"um in other words adequately uh in"
"without Consciousness uh there's there's"
"lots of evidence"
"um for uh unconscious cortical visual"
"processing in other words you don't have"
"to be conscious in order to see and and"
"uh the evidence for this is is to"
"histoscopic experiments where you flash"
"for a few milliseconds visual"
"information the person is not aware of"
"having seen anything at all and yet you"
"can demonstrate that what they've seen"
"Alters their behavior"
"um blindsight is another example uh you"
"know but for me the most uh telling"
"example the most telling reason to"
"believe that cortex is the wrong place"
"to look is that if you study children"
"who are born without a cerebral cortex a"
"condition known as hydran encephaly they"
"are conscious without any cortex at all"
"without ever having had any cortex at"
all
um
"by which I mean they wake up in the"
"morning and they go to sleep at night"
"and they are responsive and reactive"
"um and and and in particular they are"
"emotionally reactive in other words"
"affectively reactive in other words they"
"they have they show that they"
"demonstrate they act as if they have"
feelings
"so that suggests um that Consciousness"
"doesn't require a cerebral cortex uh the"
"Consciousness must be generated in the"
"brain stem which is all these children"
have
"um and it's not possible that they could"
"have visual Consciousness because they"
"don't have visual cortex or any form of"
"perceptual Consciousness or any form of"
"higher cognitive Consciousness at all"
"um the evidence suggests all they have"
"is raw feelings"
"um now um"
"that's uh as as good as good a starting"
"point as any for uh why I think that raw"
"feeling is the most basic form of"
"Consciousness there are all kinds of"
"evolutionary stories you can tell as to"
"why that also makes just common sense"
"you know that the dawn of Consciousness"
"wouldn't be some complicated cognitive"
"reflective self-awareness it would just"
"be some sort of qualitative feeling"
"state with with the survival"
"consequences like pain or hunger uh or"
"you know or the like so"
"um so that's that's where I started uh"
"the the you could even say logically uh"
"you can't you can have visual processing"
"without visual Consciousness but you"
"can't have feeling without feeling the"
"the the the the the notion of an"
"unconscious feeling is an oxymoron the"
"the very meaning of the word is that"
"that you feel it so if we're wanting to"
understand
"what Consciousness does you know we"
"should be looking at this most basic"
"form uh this this type of uh mental"
"process which seems to be for"
"Consciousness it seems to require"
"Consciousness whatever this function is"
"whatever it's doing"
"um it has to be felt uh and so these are"
"had I more time there's a lot more I"
"could say but you know these are the"
"reasons why I focused on the brain stem"
"and and on Raw affects raw feeling so as"
"as as my so now going back to feynman's"
"um remark"
"what we're wanting to do is to say well"
"what then is the mechanism the causal"
"mechanism uh whereby feelings are"
"generated in the brain stem uh if we can"
"identify that mechanism we should be"
"able to engineer it that's the basis of"
"the project that we're that that team"
"that I named uh that That's the basis of"
"the project that we are working on"
"so what is the mechanism of feeling"
"um it seems to be homeostatic"
"uh it seems to be an extended form of"
"homeostasis when I said earlier the dawn"
"of Consciousness probably involved the"
"organism feeling something about how"
"well or badly it's doing in relation to"
"its survival imperatives"
"um I'm speaking about a an extended form"
"of homeostasis when I say well or badly"
"in relation to survival imperatives"
"that's that mechanism is homeostasis"
"um and incidentally there's lots of"
"evidence that the brain stem nuclei that"
"we're talking about do in fact function"
"on the aesthetically so these are not"
"just I'm not speaking from first"
"principles I'm speaking about what we"
"know about these structures"
"um you stimulate these brain stem"
"structures you generate intense effects"
"nothing of the kind happens in cortex"
"you image people who are in intense"
"aspect of States you see that the the"
"arousal is in those brain stem"
structures
"um and uh the the in particular I want"
"to focus on the periaqueductal gray"
"which seems to be this great assembly"
"point for all of these uh homeostatic"
"systems all of the error signals in"
"other words things going badly all of"
"the error signals converge on"
"periacreductal grade so we're using the"
"the Orchid functional architecture of"
"this part of the brain as the basis for"
"the the the artificial Consciousness"
"that that we are trying to develop I I"
"must emphasize I don't say that we are"
"developing because who knows whether"
"we'll succeed or not you know so we're"
"trying it's a kind of a test of whether"
"the whether or not we're we're anywhere"
"like on the right track in terms of the"
"sorts of things I've just said"
"so um you I I I won't reference all the"
"time our last conversation because"
"presumably some of our listeners will"
"not have heard our last conversation so"
"but but I know I did mention this last"
time
"um not all homeostatic mechanisms are"
"conscious there's a hell of a lot of"
"homeostatic regulation that goes on"
"autonomically of which we have no"
"awareness blood pressure regulation is a"
"clinically notorious example you don't"
"know about the undershoots and"
"overshoots in your blood pressure until"
"it's too late"
um
"but the the example that I gave last"
"time was uh in response to a comment"
"Mike made"
"um it was that a blood gas balance"
"normally uh it's regulated autonomically"
"but under certain circumstances we do"
"become aware of how well we're doing in"
"terms of maintaining our bad gas balance"
"and that is uh under conditions of uh"
"uncertainty when we find ourselves in an"
"unpredicted situation like for example"
"in a carbon dioxide-filled room"
"um at this point when you suffer"
"air hunger or Suffocation distress your"
"need for oxygen comes very forcibly into"
consciousness
"so that transition from an autonomic"
"regulation of your blood gases to a"
"conscious awareness of of of of how well"
"you're doing in terms of your need to"
"balance carbon dioxide and oxygen that"
"that transition occurs then because now"
"the autonomic reflex is not enough you"
"have to do something allostatically in"
"the outside world and my hypothesis is"
"that the coming into consciousness of"
"your blood gas balance tells you how"
"well you're doing in your choice making"
"as you navigate this uncertain"
"environment if if you if you move"
somewhere
"you can't predict where the oxygen is"
"you've never been in a burning building"
"before let alone this particular one if"
"you happen to move by trial and error to"
"where the oxygen is you feel relief and"
"if you move uh where less oxygen is you"
"feel more uh respiratory distress and so"
"that feeling tells you how you're doing"
"so the basic mechanism uh is that"
"feeling uh of of increasing homeostatic"
"error or decreasing homeostatic error uh"
"this this the the the the the organism"
"being able to register Here and Now how"
"well it's doing enables it to make"
"choices choices uh have to be rooted in"
"a value system good and bad feelings"
"tell the organism those are our value"
"system and and it's on this basis that"
"we make our choices is on this basis"
"that the whole of voluntary uh action is"
"is is founded"
"um so uh let's let me stop there and now"
"summarize what the basic"
"requirements for what are the basic"
"ingredients for a for a conscious agent"
"given everything I've said because this"
"was our strategy he said let's let us"
"let us try to engineer the minimal"
"conditions for a conscious agent based"
"on the principles that I've just"
"outlined let's try and make one"
"um so the the basic conditions are you"
"need we're not obviously creating an"
"organism uh we're creating uh so what"
"are what are the minimal what what do we"
"look what what is the artificial"
"equivalent it's a self-organizing system"
"it's a system that is bounded there's a"
"there's a boundary between the system"
"and and its environment uh and it"
"registers its own State uh you can't"
"have you can't speak of a um of of the"
"the system having a point of view unless"
"you have those those kind of basic"
"conditions that I've just described we"
"we call it a Markov blanket uh the the"
"the the the barrier the boundary that"
"distinguishes between the system and the"
"not system and the system registers its"
"own State and registers the state of its"
"environment via the via the blankets via"
"the bouncer it registers its own blanket"
"States and that tells it something of a"
"so there's a point of view now you have"
"the sort of necessary preconditions for"
"a self I don't mean you have a self I"
"mean you have the necessary"
"preconditions for this justifies you to"
"speak of the system's point of view it"
"just it enables it becomes reasonable"
"just to to put yourself in the in in the"
"observational uh position uh to uh of"
"the system"
"how how are things going from the"
"systems point of view"
"um how well or badly it's doing in terms"
"of its survival imperatives"
"um matters to such a system because if"
"it's doing badly it's going to cease to"
exist
"um if it's doing well uh it will"
"continue to exist so this is the next"
"thing that we engineer into our system"
"it's a self-organizing Markov blanketed"
"system which has needs survival needs"
"um in the version of the system that"
"we're working on now"
"um it has three needs uh the one is it"
"has energy it needs it needs to"
"replenish its energy resources"
"uh secondly in doing so it bangs into"
things
"um and It suffers damage in the process"
"and it it it it's it's there's a there's"
"a limit to how much damage uh is is"
"tolerable to the system uh before it"
"becomes before it's it's it's uh"
"structural Integrity is is undermined"
"and thirdly it needs rest"
"um and uh while at rests uh it also"
"um it also"
"um there is a repair of the of the"
"structural uh damage that has occurred"
"um so these are the three needs uh in"
"order for this system to to continue to"
"exist it it has to meet those three"
"needs and that's all that it that's all"
"that it's there for that doesn't have"
"any other purpose other than to keep"
going
"um it's in and this is by the way I must"
"emphasize at this stage in our work this"
"is a simulated agent in other words it's"
"not a robot uh it's a it's a an agent"
"that moves around in an artificial"
"environment we're developing the"
"algorithms uh at this point for for such"
"a system"
"um can I just clarify there for a second"
"he said it's not a robot it's a system"
"that moves around in an artificial"
"environment are you talking about"
"something similar to uh"
"uh more advanced cellular automaton"
"that's just moving around in a software"
"environment or"
"so it's a virtual environment it's a"
"large space it's a grid you're located"
"in that space are all it's are its"
"resources in other words in other words"
"places where it can rest and places"
"where it can obtain its energy supplies"
"and places where it bangs into things it"
"knows nothing about that environment"
"it's just it just has these three means"
"and it wonders about this environment"
"discovering uh inferring where it is in"
"relation to what it needs on the basis"
"of the consequences for these"
"homeostatic need detectors that I"
"mentioned earlier"
"so so we will embody this but at the but"
"we've gone through many many many"
generations
"um as you can imagine in the process of"
"developing this uh it's just impractical"
"uh to do it otherwise than the way we're"
"doing it so far"
"um but they're they're very interesting"
"things that arise at the stage when"
"we're going to embody it and I'll I'll"
"come to that uh in a moment I want to"
"again sorry this is a mouthful how long"
"have I been speaking for much too long"
"well maybe before you go on to to The"
"Next Step Mike did you have any"
"questions in in here before he goes on"
"or are you content to just hear the"
"whole well I'm content I I have plenty"
"of questions and thoughts but I'd love"
"to hear the rest of this okay"
"so Mike will be familiar with with some"
"of these Concepts which sadly I don't"
"have time to unpack all together but the"
"the system the basic it's an active"
"inference uh agent uh it is inferring"
"its own State and it's inferring the"
"state of its environment uh in other"
"words it's making predictions about if I"
"do this that will that's what will"
"follow but to the extent that what it"
"predicted will follow does not follow to"
"that extent there's an error signal and"
"it updates its predictive model uh"
"accordingly and so it's it's it's"
constantly
"um improving its model of itself in its"
"world uh based entirely on its own"
experience
"with these three imperatives that it has"
"to meet those are its three homeostats"
um
"and the it has increasing or decreasing"
"confidence in its policies uh on the"
"basis of how well it goes about"
"satisfying its needs I say confidence"
"I'm using the word I know it's an"
"ambiguous word I'm using the word in the"
"statistical sense uh in other words it"
"has it attaches great or greater or less"
"Precision uh to its to its current"
policies
"um this is a confidence in the"
"statistical sense of the word but I"
"rather like the ambiguity of the term"
"like the ambiguity of the term beliefs"
"the system has beliefs that the system"
"makes decisions uh the system has needs"
"all of these words are ambiguous but I"
"but I I think"
"appropriately so"
"um now the uh"
"so that so that's the basic thing that"
"it's doing"
"um but there are various uh"
"complications the the one is that"
"um it's not expedient uh to only"
"um to to to to only function by trial"
"and error uh error is dangerous banging"
"into things is bad"
"um making this bad judgment pulls is bad"
"for for a system like this because"
"remember that basic effectivity the"
"valence the goodness and Badness is"
"rooted in these needs uh which determine"
"whether or not it's going to survive and"
"so there's there's an additional layer"
"of functionality uh which it which has"
"to do not just with measuring its free"
"energy sorry I should pause here to say"
"free energy uh Karen it very simply"
"speaking is its average error so it's"
"it's that the extent to which its model"
"does not adequately predict"
"um it does not efficiently predict what"
"it actually encounters"
"um the free energy is is a measure of"
"that so it's got to minimize its free"
"energy it's got to maximize the"
"efficiency of its predictive model"
"um but that so that's where the goodness"
"and Badness of it all"
"um it's rooted in the fact that"
"increasing free energy just is bad from"
"the point of view of the system or the"
system
"um but that free energy is factorized"
"across these three categories"
"um and what's important about that is"
"these are qualitatively distinctive"
"categories it's not just one continuous"
"variable called free energy so these"
needs
"um are qualitatively distinctive from"
"each other and must be treated so uh by"
"by the agent by by this artificial"
"system that I'm speaking of so it's"
"registering how well it's doing across"
"three different qualitative categories"
"with all of which have existential"
"consequences for it now the thing I was"
"going to come to next is that over and"
"above this trial and error"
um
"uh way of of going about meeting its"
"needs it also has the capacity to"
"calculate its expected free energy in"
"other words to look ahead if I were to"
"do this what will happen to my free"
"energy if I were to do that what would"
"happen and so this is something like"
"working memory it has something of the"
"same functional capabilities as work in"
"memory or thinking if you will and"
"thinking ahead"
"um thinking takes time it's it's it"
"doesn't have an all the time of course"
"it's working against the clock because"
"it's right it's losing it's it's losing"
"its energy supplies uh it's increasing"
"its risk it needs uh so thinking takes"
"time so it also has to think about"
"thinking as it were in other words it"
"has to make decisions about uh what how"
"many time steps must I think ahead"
"um you know at what point does it become"
"inexpedient to do so so it's got all of"
"this functionality once it's learned uh"
"how to survive in in the in in the"
environment
"uh then what we do is we change the"
environment
"um so that it now what used to apply"
"doesn't apply anymore so it's it's it's"
it's
"returned to a state of uncertainty"
"um and and I I again remember the the"
"uncertainty it's a crucial part of what"
"I'm talking about and the the confidence"
"is determined by the affects in other"
"words by how well or badly it's doing in"
"relation to its needs its confidence in"
"its current policy is modulated uh it's"
"Tethered to the affects uh but it's a"
"matter of confidence in the policies uh"
"that it's executing in the service of"
"meeting the demands of these uh"
"homeostatic need systems"
"um so we change the environment but then"
"it's now back in a state of uncertainty"
"it has to learn once more"
"um how to survive in this environment"
"and then we change it back again and"
"then the system gradually learns these"
"are like Seasons it's not random changes"
"they're regularities"
"um and then lastly we have a hill"
"um which which enables the system"
"to disambiguate which which season it's"
"in uh it's it's it's so so there's the"
"the the"
"um uh we spoke I said I'm not going to"
"talk about our last discussion but I"
"will once more"
"um we spoke about opponent processes"
"this is this explore exploit dichotomy"
"um sometimes going up onto the hill"
"which is an explore strategy"
"um is better in for its survival than"
"exploiting in other words just just"
"going for going for uh where the"
"resources are so it has these so it's"
"got choices that it's making across do I"
"act do I think"
"um do I explore do I exploit"
"um never knowing whether it's in season"
"a or it's in season B uh you know not"
"never knowing but using the attack these"
"are these are factors that it's got to"
"that it's got to take into account"
"um in its in its ongoing uh"
"what I would bet to call in its ongoing"
"voluntary behavior in other words in its"
"ongoing navigating an uncertain"
"environment and making choices based in"
"the value system ultimately rooted in"
"its its its its own survival needs"
"um so that's that's where we are that's"
"what we've done"
"um The Next Step uh in in talking in"
"this conversation now I'm in a pause I'm"
"just going to say where I would go next"
"if I didn't pause was it is to be the"
"crucial questions about how do we know"
"um when such a system in fact does have"
"feelings this is the single biggest"
"problem that we face"
"um and I've got various thoughts about"
"that none of them definitive none of"
them
"um entirely satisfactory but I think"
"that's this is the function this is the"
"the the"
"engineering of the of the minimal"
"functionality that that we have inferred"
"underlies uh raw feelings remember we're"
"talking here about artificial forms of"
feelings
"um for an artificial agent but I think"
"that it's reasonable to speak about the"
"point of view of this agent and it's"
"reasonable to start speculating about"
"what is it like to be this agent"
"um and that leads us to the problems"
"that that uh that I say I'm pausing"
"before we get to"
well
"um I mean uh so so I must say um you've"
"you've checked off almost all of my"
"boxes as far as the the the kinds of"
"things that I think are necessary to"
"create such a thing right so so I think"
"we're in complete agreement on the"
"origin of all of this in homeostasis the"
"the critical nature of choices and"
"preferences the need to self-organize"
"and construct a boundary between"
"yourself and the outside world right"
"that's not given to you by somebody else"
"but you have to construct this this"
"boundary right active inference the kind"
of
"um the basic metacognition of asking how"
"are you doing right your own ad checking"
"your own State and being um being needy"
"and vulnerable to damage and all of"
"these things I mean this is like I'm 100"
"um agree with with all of that"
"um I guess uh the two two things I was"
"thinking is"
"um first of all you know this this"
"question of uh what what you said for"
"example about blood chemistry or other"
"aspects of the body that go on you know"
"some non-consciously right so I think I"
"think that's interesting and I think it"
"impacts the second thing which is of"
"course the critical part of how do we"
"know about these systems which is that"
"that view of these things being"
"non-conscious are from a very particular"
"perspective that is from the perspective"
"of you and me and the two sort of verbal"
"consciousnesses that are having this"
"this discussion right from from that"
"perspective of course these things are I"
"have no idea what my liver is doing I'm"
"not conscious of it at all but what I'm"
"not at all sure of in fact I suspect"
"this is that that there is such a thing"
"is that these uh processes go on with"
"some level of consciousness"
"in in a different self that exists"
"within my organism that I as as you know"
"the one doing the talking now have no"
"access to but that doesn't mean it isn't"
"conscious right it's not conscious to me"
"it's not in my field of Consciousness"
"but I think actually that uh quite a"
"number of the things that are going on"
"in a body such as ours probably come"
"with their own basic non-verbal kind of"
"Consciousness we can't ask them for for"
"very reasons with obvious reasons but we"
"can gather some evidence that are"
"similar to the evidence that we use to"
"gauge each other's Consciousness in"
"terms of this you know problem of other"
"minds and things like that"
"um and so I think it's you know I I I"
"think that uh yeah we are naughty I mean"
"so so so this this whole sort of"
"construct has has a uh some number maybe"
"a large number of different selves in it"
"uh which all in which I think all enjoy"
"some type of Consciousness that we would"
"find very difficult to um to imagine or"
"or or speak about and I think uh that"
"relates to this to this question which"
"you would just sort of started on which"
"is okay so you've created this thing it"
"has all of the um uh all of the kind of"
"basic requirements and so now the"
"question is okay so what criteria do we"
"use now to know if the project has"
"succeeded or not right I think this is"
"this is really critical and for me I've"
"come to the to the conclusion that as as"
"we think about"
"competencies and spaces other than"
"three-dimensional space right so we're"
"very used to gauging you know how do we"
"solve the problem of other Minds well"
"you look around and you and I see you or"
"I see a some you know some some very"
"clever animal or something like this"
"behaving in three-dimensional space and"
"I say okay that's good enough for me to"
"infer all kinds of attribute all kinds"
"of things on a practical level attribute"
"feelings and preferences and and some"
"you know they have a theory of mind"
"about it"
"and I I I think I've come to a position"
"where looking at competencies in other"
"spaces that are not three-dimensional"
"space so for example physiological State"
"space right anatomical State space"
"transcriptional State space other other"
"problem spaces I see no reason even"
"though we are very bad at uh at having a"
"theory of Mind in those spaces we're"
"good with three-dimensional medium"
"objects medium-sized objects moving at"
"medium speeds and sort of 3D space we're"
"very good at that for evolutionary"
"reasons really not very good I think at"
"recognizing this in other other spaces"
"and I don't see any reason why all of"
"these systems that have various"
"competencies in those spaces might not"
"have equally equally valid Consciousness"
"in those spaces and so I guess I guess"
"I'll just I'll just end here and ask you"
"because I think here's where the two"
"things kind of come together is in your"
"system before you make the physical"
"system right so so in your virtual"
"simulated world where your system"
"matches all of these criteria at that"
"point do you think that whatever level"
"of Consciousness it has is uh sort of as"
"real whatever that is right but but as"
"valid as the kind of Consciousness that"
"other CR that physical creatures exist"
"the exhibit in in um in in"
"three-dimensional space right so so"
"people I mean this is this is something"
"that you know science fiction authors"
"and and computer scientists have been"
"discussing for for a really long time"
"right if you if you live in a virtual"
"world and you're a virtual creature is"
"your is your can you have a"
"Consciousness that has the same"
"philosophical status as as our"
"Consciousness so what what is your take"
"on that do you think this is as real as"
"it gets or no"
"uh the short answer is yes and now let"
"me unpack a bit of it"
"um I uh absolutely accept your earlier"
statement
"um about component systems uh within the"
system
"um and you spoke of selves you know a"
"sort of component salts I I absolutely"
"accept that"
"um as you know because you are familiar"
"with with this whole way of thinking uh"
"there isn't one mark of blankets"
"um you know there are there are blankets"
"within blankets within blankets uh the"
"the nervous system sort of provides a"
"meta blanket"
"um but but it's regulating all these"
"other component systems"
"um and my answer to uh that is to the"
"extent you remember where I S what my"
"starting point was in terms of the"
"transition from autonomic uh uh"
"regulation of blood gases to uh to"
"feeling Suffocation along"
"um the the the the"
"principle there uh for me is to do with"
"choice choice the requirement for choice"
"in other words the uncertainty uh that"
"the system has to uh compute in relation"
"to its policies uh what as and this is"
"something which I imagine in the most"
"autonomically regulated systems they"
"will be minimal uncertainty it doesn't"
"mean there's none there will be times"
"when there's none there might be moments"
"of perturbation where uncertainty uh"
"reappears so I don't see it as a black"
"and white dividing line I think wherever"
"that wherever that fun the functionality"
"I'm talking about where the system or"
"subsystem uh has to Now navigate"
"uncertainty and make choices uh I I'm"
"saying that's what the mechanism of"
"affect is for so wherever we see that"
"functionality I'm I'm willing to to to"
"infer uh affect"
"um the word affect"
"um speaks to your next question in one"
"way that there are two ways in which I'd"
"like to address your main question about"
three-dimensionality
"um the the monitoring of blood gases is"
"not a three-dimensional special business"
"um and the same applies with our"
"artificial agent it's monitoring how am"
"I doing it for example in relation to my"
"energy needs this is not about space"
"it's navigating a space in order to it's"
"it's having to exist within a"
"three-dimensional uh a spatial uh World"
"um but but what it's doing there is"
"fundamentally driven by its monitoring"
"of its own State uh it's a measurement"
"of its own state in a in a qualitative"
Dimension
"um so for me uh this goes to what I said"
"at the beginning about our starting with"
"visual Consciousness as our model"
"example I think that's starting with"
"this kind of representational cognitive"
"of Consciousness I think we should have"
"started with something that has to do"
"with the measurement of a state"
"something much more basic but I think"
"that the other way in which you're"
"asking the question about virtual versus"
"Real uh agents that that's a terribly"
"important question and uh and I'm afraid"
"I I suspect I or dare I say we will lose"
"the sympathy of many of our viewers and"
"listeners when I say what I'm going to"
"say now which is that I think it doesn't"
"make one jot of difference whether it's"
"a embodied agent or it's a virtual agent"
"because this is the whole this is what"
"functionalism is all about it's not"
"about the substrate it's about the"
"mechanism it's about what so the"
"computations that this agent is"
"performing or every bit is real but if"
"it's embodied as if it's not in body and"
"I and and so the mechanism I'm talking"
"about the mechanism that that positively"
"generates you know a feeling like"
"something I think is perfectly uh"
"possible in in a not in in a in an"
"entirely virtual agent"
"um so when I said at the beginning we're"
"doing it this way first later we will"
"embody it I have to confess I mean we I"
"am interested in embodiment you know I'm"
"interested in what new problems arise"
"for the agent I think that we need to"
"take an empirical approach to that"
"um but but in principle"
"uh I I I I that the real reason why I"
"feel we need to do that is because of"
"prejudice because uh the people you're"
"going to have to uh uh judge uh whether"
"we have succeeded in our project or not"
"uh you know we're going to have three"
"Strokes against us if it's not a"
"physically embodied about embodied agent"
"and that's the main reason uh what"
"Frankly Speaking uh that that I want to"
"embody it"
"um and so you know exactly I need to ask"
"a question here"
"um because when you when you are talking"
about
um
"the the blood gases getting to a place"
"where it rises up into the Consciousness"
"and you when you talk about that that"
"need that arises that we become"
"conscious we become conscious of the"
"need right that need is being instigated"
"by the anomaly of the the environment in"
"which our blood gases get out of balance"
"and when Mike talks about"
um
"Picasso tadpoles"
"he's created an anomaly that the the"
"tadpole moving into the Frog State then"
"has to adapt to that anomaly somehow"
"and it's in that adaptation I think"
"maybe when I'm hearing you might talk"
"about these different levels where you"
"can go down and find this aspect of"
"Consciousness there has to be some"
foreign
"some way in which those tadpoles the"
"cells within the tadpoles are navigating"
"that problem that they're facing that"
"anomaly that you have injected into the"
system
"when I if I move into a a gas-filled"
"room or something like that that gas in"
"that room is an unusual environment and"
"you talk Mark about"
"creating unusual environments for your"
"your entity whatever that is to navigate"
"because that's part of the learning"
"process so to speak that's part of the"
development
so
um
"how is it possible for this entity to"
"face anomaly"
"if it is not embodied unless it's just"
"anomaly that you're creating for it"
"you're artificially producing anomalies"
"for it to interact with but if it's not"
"embodied how is it going to"
"face anomalies that aren't being"
"artificially injected into the system"
"does that make sense yeah I mean in the"
"case of in the in the in the case of"
"morphogenesis as you're talking about"
"now we have a system that lives in"
"multiple worlds it it is embodied in"
"that you can go and put your put your"
"finger on the cells and where the eyes"
"are and so on but but I think in a much"
"more important sense what it's doing is"
"it's navigating more for space which is"
"this this virtual space of possible"
"configurations of the face and what"
"we've done in that space in the case of"
"the Frog what we've done is we've we've"
"moved the physical configuration but we"
"have not touched the encoding of the"
"correct State the set point which is how"
"the system knows that it's in the wrong"
"State and I mean I think Mark laid out"
"all the right uh steps that um that"
"exactly is what it does it's constantly"
"monitoring itself against the set point"
"and and in fact we are so that we have a"
"we have a project where we literally"
"look at the stress that goes up when the"
"Delta is is too high so the so the"
"current state doesn't match the desired"
"State the stress of the system goes up"
"and so it absolutely knows where it is"
"in morphe space and if it's in the right"
"place or the wrong place we have other"
"systems where where we've done the"
"opposite where we don't touch the cells"
"what we do is we change the set point"
"and then the cells sure enough will go"
"and reconfigure themselves in a com"
"something you would you know an observer"
"might call a defect but actually the"
"cells are doing exactly what they're"
"supposed to they're building a"
"completely different thing because we've"
"Rewritten the set point that they're"
"using to gauge where they're supposed to"
"go so I I'm I'm I sorry I'm in full"
"agreement with Mark I think that that"
"space is as good that that that that"
"Morpher space is as good as virtual"
"space in terms of once you have an agent"
"in there that's sophisticated enough to"
"not only uh homeostatically solve the"
"problem but have a second order"
"monitoring mechanism where it's actually"
"um that has a degree of metacognition"
"about how well it's doing and what"
"should we do and all of that uh I think"
"that's as good I mean to me again and I"
"know what you mean I think yeah we'll"
"we'll lose some people here but I think"
"but I think absolutely uh that's that's"
"as good that's absolutely is good the"
"one way of trying to re win regain those"
"people that we might to have lost is to"
"remind us all that we have the reality"
"that we are interacting with is our own"
"representation of that reality"
"um so you know this physical space that"
"we're speaking about is our own"
"um generative models representation of"
"that space and likewise of our own"
"internal bodily States"
"um we these are nerve impulses which are"
"representing uh those steps to us so you"
"know what actually lies behind the"
"blanket is completely it doesn't really"
"it doesn't really register for the"
"system it's the system is only"
"registering its representation of a"
"reality that it has faith if I may say"
"that it has faith that there is some"
"real reality Beyond its representation"
"of it that it's not just Living in a"
"Dream but ironically a phenomenal"
"reality the phenomenological reality for"
"the system"
"the most real thing uh as it were"
"um is the stress that Mike was just"
"speaking about what the system is"
"registering is stress"
"um about these other things which it's"
"representing which order which is"
"inferring are the causes of this"
"affective state that it's in the"
"affective state is the is the the you"
"know it's a kind of Turn up for the"
"books that the affect of State the thing"
"that the behaviorists told us was a"
"fiction uh the affect of state is I"
"think uh as it were empirically from the"
"Viewpoint of the system the most real"
"thing uh it is it is the it is the the"
"lived or at least experienced reality of"
"the system yeah"
um
"now please please go ahead"
"well I just I was going to uh bounce uh"
"bounce an idea off off of you and see we"
"see what you thought of was um I've been"
"thinking about exactly these same issues"
"you know these kind of basic uh basic"
"elements that have to be there and one"
"one thing that I recently started"
"thinking about is this notion that okay"
"so so we start off with basic"
"homeostasis so you have this thermostat"
"that resists changes in the environment"
"right and it uh does what it can to keep"
"the environment constant via the cooling"
"and the heating but one thing it doesn't"
"do is resist your attempts to change the"
"set point so in other words at that"
"level of existence whatever the set"
"point is it's just going to do it it"
"offers no resistance to that but in"
"biology organisms like that don't"
"survive long because they will be"
"exploited by cheaters and parasites and"
"everything else and so so that means"
"that uh Evolution should be favoring the"
"emergence of agents that not only uh"
"have a have a set point and work towards"
"it but actually are monitoring that set"
"point to see whether it's being altered"
"or not now that leads to an interesting"
"thing and it's the distinction that"
"can't recall if we talked about this"
"last time or not but it's the"
"distinction between learning and being"
"trained the question is can you tell"
"who's on the on the other side of this"
"of of whatever is happening to you at"
"the moment right so so so if if you're a"
"cell and you're um a bioelectric state"
"has been has been changed can you in"
"fact determine whether yes it's been"
"changed because you're the one who"
"changed it because you want to be in"
"another state for whatever reason or was"
"it changed because a parasite or a back"
"propagation training process or some"
"engineer or somebody or a neighboring"
"cell or that's trying to make you be"
"part of a different tissue or or cancer"
"cell or whatever somebody else changed"
"it for you so that seems to be"
"evolutionarily it seems that there"
"should be a lot of pressure to get good"
"at determining that sort of thing which"
"requires then a lot of metacognitive"
"monitoring and a clear boundary and a"
"clear definition of which are the things"
"that I'm going to consider okay because"
"they come from inside whatever that is"
"defined as versus which of the things"
"that I consider an attack some sort of"
"hack of you know so some something that"
"may or may not have my best interests in"
"our at heart because because there's"
"another agent on the other side of it"
"they have a different agenda maybe right"
"so I think so I think that that simple"
"Dynamic it seems to me that that simple"
"dynamic sets up a real pressure to get"
"very good at establishing that boundary"
"that you talked about between the self"
"and the outside world and in particular"
"monitoring all of this all of the events"
"that go on to try to determine their"
"origin or or you know which so so that"
"in turn taking it one step further that"
"is the basis of trying to identify the"
"agency of various things that happened"
"is it is it the dumb Mechanical Universe"
"that's causing this or is there a level"
"of agency out there that's messing with"
"me that I need to resist or overcome or"
"something so that if that's present all"
"the way at the beginning one can easily"
"sort of see how that would scale up in"
"complexity and give rise to all of these"
"kind of complex things that that we"
"enjoy where we where we we like to tell"
"stories of responsibility and"
"individuals doing things themselves"
"having perduring properties uh and and"
"ownership of goals and memories and"
"everything else it seems to me that all"
"of this boils down to this very simple"
"uh uh survival need of resisting changes"
"to your set point right in a kind of"
"competitive in a competitive world is"
"that any of this sound sound reasonable"
"yes it all sounds reasonable it's the to"
"start at the"
"the most basic level which is not quite"
"uh what where where you're taking this"
"but I think it needs to be said first"
um
"of course learning uh doesn't have to"
"take place onto genetically there is"
"also a learning a bilateral selection"
"um and so uh that's probably how it"
"starts and for a very long time it's"
"probably the only way that such learning"
"of in terms of the you know what is the"
"ideal set point"
"um and uh that's probably how it happens"
"for eon's time but of course as soon as"
"the agent has its it has the capacity to"
"make choices distinctions inferences"
"about this during its own lifetime uh"
"then you have an A massively increased"
"adaptive Advantage so I I'm quite happy"
"uh to agree with you that you know it"
"probably goes a very long way down that"
capacity
"um I think that"
"um what you're also touching on is a"
very
"um a crucial aspect missing from the"
"system that we currently are working on"
"and that is that it's uh it's it's a"
"Hermit you know there's only one of them"
"um and uh so one of the things that we"
"know we need to do in Fairly short order"
"uh is introduced at uh introduce other"
"agents uh con specifics"
"um and and others"
"um into the same environment so that it"
"starts having to"
"um uh infer other other agents"
"um and modeling the models"
"um of other agents in order to make the"
"kinds of inferences that you're talking"
"about with all of their with all of"
"their adaptive advantages and I think"
"that that's uh it's biologically a"
"highly implausible situation the one we"
"have at the moment uh an agent that's"
"that's that that is the only uh the only"
"the only game in town"
"um it's it's so it's not it's not really"
"having to infer learn how to infer"
"um the the"
"um the sorts of things that you're"
"talking about"
"um so that that is that is that is one"
"of the places we're going I think that"
"before we run out of time let's spend a"
"little bit of time talking about this"
"problem of other Minds"
"um you know the how do you judge how do"
"you know when you've when you've"
"succeeded uh in engineering an"
"artificial consciousness"
"um the how do we normally how do we"
"normally deal with the problem of other"
"minds and the only way we can deal with"
"it is uh inferential you know we I can"
"never observe Mike Levin's Consciousness"
"so I can't know uh that he that that it"
"feels like anything to be him"
"um but I'm I I'm pretty confident in my"
"inference that it that he feels pretty"
"much the same as I feel to myself"
"um and so that's we have to remember"
"that's our starting point there's no way"
"uh that you can uh directly observe the"
"conscious states of any other agent"
"including other human beings you know"
"let alone uh uh uh non-human uh"
"creatures and organisms and uh a let"
"alone artificial systems so this is why"
"I start with the the precise definition"
"of what I think the functional mechanism"
"is you know that wherever I see evidence"
"of that functional mechanism operating"
"that's one reason for me to be confident"
"that it feels like something to be the"
"system you know and I think that we're"
"up against an enormous amount of"
"prejudice when it comes to that sort of"
"thing so one of the ways in which um I"
"mean the the only the only sort of truly"
"empirical when I say empirical I mean"
"that's not the right word truly"
objective
"um is something like the Turing test you"
"know that we have to have judges uh who"
"see this thing behaving and have to make"
"they have to do what I've just said all"
"that we can do is you know I'm a judge"
"who's currently judging that Mike Levin"
"is conscious so we need to that that's a"
"Turing test uh you know and and we need"
"to minimize the Prejudice which is why"
"Turing developed the test in the way"
"that he did that you don't get to see"
"um who the agent is that you're"
"interacting with"
so
"um the the the the virtual agent that we"
"currently have one of the advantages of"
"using a virtual agent is we can come up"
"with all sorts of Graphics uh where we"
"can embody this agent in all sorts of"
"bodies which may be more or less"
"um you know"
"persuasive it would be interesting to"
"see to what extent does the judge"
"attribute Consciousness to the agent"
"just on the basis of what it looks like"
"if it looks human if it looks biological"
"if it looks non-biological but"
"robot-like as opposed to if it looks"
"like just a cipher you know um how much"
"of our of our willingness to attribute"
"feelings to the agent uh is is"
"determined simply by that the most you"
"know when I speak to my my colleagues my"
"neuroscientific colleagues"
"um about this problem of other minds and"
"how we get around it you know I'm"
"constantly astonished by the how many of"
"them uh hang their hat on reportability"
"they say you know I I'm if you can't"
"report that you're conscious uh there's"
"no empirical Criterion and therefore"
"even those children I spoke of there's"
"hadren encephalic children who are so"
"emotionally responsive they say I don't"
"know if they're conscious because why"
"because they can't tell me they are you"
"know and and so just to show how how"
"flimsy a Criterion reportability is"
"um imagine if what we did with our agent"
"is all that it has to do you know is is"
"have a little have a little ticker tape"
"which says I am I am running out of"
"energy supplies I feel bad about that I"
"am getting tired you know it's"
"meaningless it would be the least"
"persuasive a piece of evidence uh as to"
"what's going on I would be much more"
"persuaded by what it does you know what"
"kinds of problems it's able to solve and"
"and and and"
"centrally you know to what extent it's"
"able to navigate uncertainty able to"
"make uh decisions which save its bacon"
"um in situations that it's never been in"
before
so
"um ultimately we are going to rely on"
"that but there's some interesting"
"um things which I would just like to"
"throw it throughout I'll just mention"
"one of them there are many that we don't"
"have time uh but I'll just mention one"
"of them to see what you think of this"
"one you know the the experiment with"
zebrafish
"um I said I guess you call them"
zebrafish
"um the the with the hedonic uh condition"
"Place preference behavior that the the"
"fish hang out on this side of the tank"
"because that's where the food is until"
"you put cocaine or nicotine uh or"
amphetamine
"um or morphine on that side of the tank"
"uh then they hang out there uh so it's"
"it's a hedonic condition Place"
"preference Behavior there why would the"
"fish go there it's not good for the fish"
"it it feels good but it's not"
"nutritional in fact it's it's actually"
"harmful those substances so we're trying"
"to come up with something like that for"
"our agent where we can where we can show"
"something like hedonic place something"
"that suggests that what's motivating the"
"agent now is only a feeling it is it is"
"it in fact in fact it's something like"
"something like neurotic behavior in"
"other words it's doing something that's"
"not in its own best interest on the"
"basis of feeling States alone what do"
"you think of that would that be a a"
"convincing uh Criterion for you I mean I"
"I think it's very interesting for for me"
"that works in fact we've done similar"
"things in development where we've"
"exposed developing and regenerating"
"animals to things like ssris other"
"anxiolytics and and sure enough I mean"
"the the the"
"morphogenetic agent is uh quite capable"
"of either hallucinating in morphe space"
"or hanging out in regions of morphospace"
"that it normally would never go to"
"because we've short-circuited this"
"reward Machinery either either the"
"motivation is gone or the stress is so"
"low that it doesn't care anymore and so"
"the the anatomy just basically go goes"
"It goes all to heck I mean that that"
"absolutely works and I you know I think"
"that's a that's a very reasonable I mean"
"I think much like much like many things"
"of interest in this area if somebody"
"wanted to be a sort of micro"
"reductionist about these things I think"
"somebody could say well what we've done"
"in both of these cases is hijack the the"
"metacognitive Machinery such that you"
"know what the drug basically does is it"
"fools it into thinking that the things"
"are good because it hijacks this like"
"self-monitoring thing right so I mean"
"that's I I'm not worried about it that's"
"one can take that view of you know kind"
"of that that reductionist view of of"
"anything but I think fundamentally yeah"
"fundamentally it is about the"
"motivations of the agent and what are"
"the different"
"what are the different ways to"
"manipulate it and that tell you"
"something about the the you know to"
"improve your theory of Mind basically"
"yeah yeah I think I think it's very"
reasonable
"well I know that you both have a hard"
"stop at 10 so I'm just going to throw"
"out one last question for you both to"
"think about and then if you think it"
"would be an interesting thing to talk"
"about you can let me know later"
"and that is"
"um Mark you said that you're creating an"
"agent that has no other purpose except"
"to continue existing"
"so my biggest question about the the"
"beginning of Life or the beginning of"
"Consciousness is where does that desire"
"to exist come from"
"so I'll just throw that out in the air"
"and yeah that's a small that's that's a"
"small question I'm sure I'm sure we"
"could we could uh get that answered in"
"the last 30 seconds yeah"
"no thank you so much thank you so much"
"for joining me it was an interesting"
