"my group works on a number of different"
"things in particular um how evolution"
"uses a sort of multi-scale competency"
"architecture to evolve not just bodies"
"that solve specific environments but but"
"machines that solve a wide class of"
"problems in including novel and novel"
ones
"and in particular we work on"
"understanding how"
"while dna specifies the cellular"
"hardware that every cell has to deploy"
"what actually can be done both by us as"
"engineers and by evolution by working at"
"the software level and this"
"involves this concept of agential"
"materials where biology uses material"
"with agendas in various spaces all the"
"way down what i will uh focus on since"
"we don't have that much time what i'll"
"focus on are two things"
"i'll try to show you that um dynamic"
"robust anatomical homeostasis not just"
"emergent morphogenesis but actually uh"
"the dynamic control of form is a kind of"
"intelligent behavior of a cellular"
"collective that's solving problems in"
"anatomical morphospace so that will be"
"the kind of the example that we'll work"
"on today there are many others"
"and i'm going to argue that"
"one important cognitive glue that"
"harnesses cells towards these kind of"
"large scale anatomical outcomes is"
"developmental bioelectricity and we've"
"actually now"
"developed tools to and more importantly"
"starting to develop computational"
"methods to read and write the pattern"
"memories of uh this organ level"
"collective intelligence so let's just"
"start by uh envisioning what what the"
"end game of let's say regenerative"
"medicine might look like what you'd like"
"to do is someday to be able to uh sit"
"down in front of a computer and draw the"
"large-scale anatomy of the animal that"
"you want so in this case it's a it's a"
"three-headed flatworm it looks like this"
"let me show you more flatworms"
"momentarily if we knew what we were"
"doing we would have a piece of software"
"that could compile this description into"
"a set of stimuli that would have to be"
"given to cells to make them build"
"exactly this now why would we need such"
"a thing because all of the problems of"
"medicine perhaps with the exception of"
"infectious disease we're talking about"
"birth defects traumatic injury cancer"
"aging degenerative disease all of these"
"things would be solved if we knew one"
"simple thing which is how do we control"
"what it is that groups of cells are"
"going to build okay this is a so this is"
"a very practical um a very practical"
"problem not just the basic science or"
"philosophy it's very very practical now"
"why don't we have such a thing we are"
"very very far away from this"
"because uh despite all the um"
"progress in molecular genetics and"
"things like that we have really some"
"fundamental knowledge gaps so simple one"
"can be uh can be illustrated this way uh"
"axolotls baby axolotls have legs um frog"
"larvae or tadpoles do not have legs if i"
"were to make a chimeric embryo let's say"
"half axolotl cells have frog cells which"
"which we've done which is possible and"
"i would say well we have both of the"
"genomes we have the axolotl genome we"
"have the frog genome will the frogalols"
"have legs and if they do have legs will"
"those legs be made entirely of axolotl"
"cells or will they in fact have some"
"frog cells making up those legs we don't"
"have any models that allow you to make a"
"prediction on this okay only empirically"
"can we can we start to answer this so"
"even though we have we have perfect"
"access to the uh to the to the genomes"
"and in fact it's even worse because even"
"from a single species genome we cannot"
"tell what the anatomy is going to be"
"unless we sort of cheat by comparing it"
"to another genome whose anatomy we do"
"know so the state of the art here is"
this
"and we're very good at manipulating"
"cells and molecules um we are really"
"quite a long way from understanding how"
"to control large scale form and function"
"and biomedicine has been largely at the"
"uh at the level of hardware although all"
"the focus has been on genomic editing"
"and pathways and and things like this"
"but i'm going to argue that we really to"
"move this forward we really need to"
"understand not just the mechanisms by"
"which cells do things but actually how"
"do they know what to do right especially"
"in novel circumstances which is which is"
"where the intelligence comes in so what"
"i'm going to do today is show you"
"progressively more unusual examples of"
"what i think cellular collective"
"intelligence is doing and some of our"
"attempts to understand and exploit that"
so
"let's take a look let's just remind"
"ourselves how all of us made our journey"
"across the cartesian cut here we all"
"started life as a single cell which"
"became a collection of cells these"
"embryonic blastomeres and then over some"
"amount of time they uh without any"
"instructions from from outside they"
"spontaneously self-assemble the creature"
that
"uh has uh sophisticated cognition and"
"first-person perspective and all these"
things
"and this is a cross-section through a"
"human torso look at the remarkable order"
"here right the um the just just just"
"amazing uh invariant structure where all"
"the tissues organs everything is in the"
"right place next to the right thing"
"where does that anatomical pattern come"
"from i mean we can read genomes now when"
"we know it's not in the dna dna"
"specifies proteins it does not directly"
"specify anatomy so we have these"
"difficult questions of how do these"
"collections of cells know what to make"
"when to stop how do we"
"convince them to rebuild after um after"
"damage and as engineers and this is"
"going to lead into josh's talk next um"
"we'd like to know how far can we push"
"this actually could we get these same"
"cells to build something completely"
"different and so now this emergent feed"
"forward patterning process which people"
"often think about with with complexity"
"theory and emergence you know lots of"
"local rules and then outcomes something"
"something amazing there's actually even"
"much more i mean that's amazing enough"
"but it's actually much more interesting"
"than that so so the first thing we got"
"to remember is that cells are extremely"
"competent this is a single cell creature"
"this is a lacrimarium there's no brain"
"there's no nervous system um"
"there uh this this this this creature"
"handles all of its physiological"
"metabolic and morphological goals at the"
"single cell scale if you're into soft"
"robotics you're probably really jealous"
"of this we don't have anything that um"
"begins to uh compare with this with this"
"degree of control again one single cell"
"and so uh we can start by um"
"by thinking about uh this and so we"
"start with this definition of"
"intelligence that i quite like from"
"william james which is the ability to"
"reach the same end by different means"
"let's look at a few examples uh"
"embryogenesis is robust and reliable but"
"it is not hardwired so if you take an"
"early embryo and you cut it in half you"
"don't get two half embryos you get two"
"perfectly normal monozygotic twins so"
"again we don't really have any any"
"machines that that can do that each half"
"recognizes what's missing rebuilds no"
"problem it even gets more amazing than"
"that because they can adapt to not only"
"injury and changes of environment they"
"can on the fly adapt to changes of"
"internal components so this is a"
"cross-section through a newt uh kidney"
"tubule and it looks like this and"
"there's eight to ten cells that work"
"together to build this thing"
"if you modify the initial egg in a way"
"that produces very gigantic cells fewer"
"and fewer cells will work together to"
"make exactly the same diameter lumens"
"until the cells get so big that just one"
"cell will wrap around itself to produce"
"exactly the same anatomical outcome and"
"this is a completely different molecular"
"mechanism this is cytoskeletal bending"
"this is cell to cell communication so"
"the system harnesses diverse underlying"
"molecular uh component molecular"
pathways
"to make up for a radical change in its"
"component parts to get the same outcome"
"right so remember james's definition"
"now um this is another phenomenon called"
"regeneration so you can take a this is"
"an axolotl they regenerate many parts of"
"their body"
"you can amputate the leg at different"
"portions the leg will begin to grow it"
"will grow exactly as much as needed from"
"wherever it is that you cut it and it"
"will stop"
"when a correct salamander leg has been"
"produced right so we need to understand"
"this process of anatomical homeostasis"
"you keep keep growing and keep"
"remodeling until you get to the correct"
"shape and then you can stop some sort of"
"means ends analysis something like that"
"so here we have the ability in in these"
"examples that i'm showing you to get to"
"the same outcome despite perturbations"
"despite diverse starting positions"
"here's a radical example of that"
"a few years ago we discovered that well"
"in the normal journey from tadpole to"
"frog of course the faces are different"
"they have to rearrange their face so the"
"eyes have to move forward the jaws have"
"to come out and it was thought that"
"because all tadpoles look the same and"
"all frogs look the same all you have to"
"do is is somehow code in what direction"
"and how far they move so we made these"
"so-called picasso tackles everything is"
"in the wrong place the eyes are on the"
"side of the head the jaws are off filter"
"everything is wrong"
"these animals make largely perfectly"
"good frogs because all of this stuff"
"will continue to move in novel uh paths"
"in fact sometimes they go too far and"
"have to double back until a correct frog"
"phase is produced and then they stop so"
"what the genetics actually gives us is a"
"system that can make up for all kinds of"
"um errors and deviations and uh in in"
"it's in its uh in its um"
"uh uh attempts to get to uh the correct"
"uh set point the correct target"
"morphology if we had a robotic swarm"
"that could do this we would call this an"
"amazing example of of collective"
"intelligence so now the thing with the"
"setpoints is that"
"the the"
the
"they can they can grow in terms of very"
"very simple homeostatic loops like this"
"at the single cell level can grow and"
"become very large set points like a like"
"the layout of a of a correct limb okay"
"so when cells join together into"
"networks these these uh"
"homeostatic loops"
"instead of tracking local scalars and"
"things like ph and hunger level and so"
"on are actually now able to track very"
"large things like how many fingers do i"
"have what is the length of the limb but"
"it can actually shrink down as well this"
"is this is um uh"
"glioblastoma so this is a cancer and"
"what happens is the cells from a normal"
"organism can"
"detach from the network of cues that"
"keeps them harnessed towards these large"
"scale goals and shrink back down to"
"these very ancient very humble single"
"cell goals like proliferate as much as i"
"can move wherever life is good that's"
"metastasis and cancer so that boundary"
"of of the goals that these systems are"
"able to to work towards can grow and can"
"shrink now how does this happen how do"
"cells scale up into larger into networks"
"that can maintain larger"
"set points well"
"very much like in the brain uh they do"
"this through bioelectricity long before"
"brains and nervous systems evolved"
"evolution discovered that electrical"
"networks are great for processing"
"information storing memories and so on"
"uh every cell in your body has what"
"neurons has have which is ion channels"
"in their membrane that allow them to"
store
"set voltage"
"potentials across the membrane and these"
"electrical synapses that allow them to"
"communicate these states to their"
"neighbors with a with with lots of"
"sophistication both of these things are"
"actually transistors right they're"
"voltage-gated themselves making for all"
"kinds of interesting feedback loops and"
"so on so um what's going on is that"
"while this this much newer system is"
"able to uh use uh these electrical"
"circuits to control muscle movement to"
"move you around through"
"three-dimensional space and"
"neuroscientists try to decode this"
"electrical activity to try to infer"
"the the mental content of what's going"
"on here"
"long before that"
"this the same exact system was being"
"used to control all of the cells of the"
"embryo to move the configuration of the"
"body in anatomical morphospace and we"
"are doing exactly the same thing as this"
"program of neural decoding to try to"
"extract and this is what you're seeing"
"here is a um"
"a video of a voltage sensitive"
"fluorescent dye"
"this is a frog embryo it's not a"
"simulation this is this is a real a real"
"embryo you can see all the cells uh"
"processing these um electrical signals"
"that uh that communicate with to each"
"other who's going to be head tail left"
"right all that all that kind of thing so"
"what we developed um uh were some tools"
"to not only track it but actually to"
"manipulate this now this is uh not we"
"don't use any um electromagnetic fields"
"there are no electrodes we don't apply"
"currents nothing like that what we do is"
"we basically do what neuroscientists do"
"which is"
"and to manipulate the gap junctions or"
"the topology of the network so we get to"
"control which cell controls with"
"communicates with which other cell"
"and we can control individual ion"
"channels using optogenetics with light"
"with people with drugs with mutation uh"
"to set voltages and in fact uh patterns"
"of voltage distributions"
"so at the single cell level the"
"importance of it looks kind of like this"
"when we um inject a an oncogene a"
"powerful oncogene let's say a k-ras"
"mutation from from a human tumor into"
"these temples they will eventually"
"develop a tumor but long before that you"
"can actually watch with these"
"non-invasive voltage dice you can"
"actually watch the cells disconnect"
"electrically from their neighbors they"
"acquire a unique different resting"
"potential and now they're rolling back"
"to this amoeba-like state where they're"
"just going to treat the rest of the"
"animal as external environment they go"
"where they want they"
"the what they want and so on so we"
"actually watch this more importantly we"
"can prevent this process by co-injecting"
"with this rna we co-inject rna encoding"
"a particular ion channel which we've"
"chosen to set a voltage state that will"
"force them to remain in the electrical"
"connection with their neighbors no"
"matter what the oncogene says so if you"
"do this then even though that that"
"oncoprotein is really strongly expressed"
"you can see it's blazing this is just a"
"fluorescent um marker that's attached to"
"it it's all over the place in fact there"
"doesn't have to be any tumor because the"
"actual outcome is not in the genetics of"
"uh what's happening uh to the to the to"
"the the genome of the cell it's actually"
"in the physiology of what that cell is"
"going to be connected to as far and and"
"what that network is trying to do in"
"this case maintain proper his"
"histogenesis and so on so that's at the"
"single cell level at the multicellular"
"level you have uh pre patterns that like"
"the electric face we call this the"
"electric face"
"here's a frog embryo putting its uh face"
"together in fact here's one frame out of"
"that video and what you can see here is"
"that long before the genes come on to"
"pattern the face you've all you can"
"already extract from this and i'm"
"showing you this example because it's"
"the most obvious others are really"
"complicated to decode this one is the"
"most obvious you can basically see"
"what's gonna what's going to happen"
"here's where the right eye is going to"
"happen the left eye comes in later"
"here's where the mouth is going to form"
"here with the placards already these"
"this network has this kind of internal"
"memory of what a correct um"
"tadpole phase is supposed to look like"
"and that is what guides gene expression"
"and anatomy if you mess with this with"
"optogenetics with with various drugs"
"that open and close these channels"
"you can induce a severe mispatterning of"
"the um"
"of the gene expression and the anatomy"
"and in fact lots of human uh"
"channelopathies uh have this explanation"
"behind them they're basically mutations"
"and ion channels that mess up the"
"ability of these networks to remember"
"what they're supposed to form"
"now once you start to control this you"
"can see that some very interesting"
"things are possible so for example here"
"we've taken some ion channels now that"
"we know what an eye specific pattern"
"looks like a pattern that says build an"
"eye here we can we can now write that"
"pattern into the electrical network of"
"other cells so we can go in and take"
"that ion channel rna inject it into some"
"cells that are going to otherwise form"
"gut and the cells sure enough they"
"follow the they follow the pattern and"
"they make up they make a nice eye these"
"eyes will have all the same layers right"
"now optic nerve all the same stuff that"
"eyes are supposed to have"
"and a couple interesting things we can"
"make eyes we can make ectopic legs as"
"you see here um two interesting things"
"to notice one is that this is a very"
"modular phenomenon it's basically a"
"subroutine call we in no way provided"
"enough information to know how to make"
"an eye all we provided was a fairly"
"simple signal that said you already know"
"how to build an eye"
"do it here right it's it's a trigger"
"it's not micromanaging the cells we"
"certainly didn't specify all the cell"
"identities and so on right so the whole"
"thing is quite modular we're finding"
"these um these these hooks into the"
"morphogenetic modules that it knows how"
"to do and and then what you can see here"
"there's two level of instruction the"
"blue is this is a lens sitting out in"
"the tail of a tadpole somewhere that"
"we've induced"
"the the blue cells are the ones we"
"actually injected with an ion channel"
"let's just build an eye here these cells"
"back here we didn't touch them at all"
"they were recruited by these cells that"
"in some way basically organize the right"
"number of cells to build a proper lens"
"because we didn't inject enough so we"
"instruct these cells they're going to"
"make an eye these cells instruct some of"
"their neighbors that hey you need to"
"participate in this we're going to make"
"this we're going to make this eye so"
"there's several levels of instruction"
"here when we induce these organs now"
"one of the most um sort of high"
"resolution uh work that we've been able"
"to do is concerns fixing brain defects"
"so this is the bioelectric pattern that"
"is responsible for setting the shape and"
"the size of the early brain and it has a"
"very i don't have time to go into all"
"the details has a very particular"
"bioelectric profile if you measure it in"
"a particular place"
"and what we did was and this is in"
"collaboration with alexis pytak in our"
"center what we did was we made a"
"computational model using a bioelectric"
"simulator that she produced"
"that took uh the the situation of being"
"exposed to teratogens for example"
"nicotine alcohol lots of different"
tyrannogens
"and we built a model and we asked okay"
"if the bioelectric pre-pattern"
"is is"
"is is messed up by these by these"
"stratogens what would we have to do to"
"get it back okay which channels could"
"you open and close to get the correct"
"bioelectric pattern back one of the"
"things that the model allowed us to do"
"is to focus on the need for a contrast"
"enhancer basically what happens in these"
"disorders is that this this very nice"
"bell curve"
"gets flattened either either up here or"
"down here it doesn't matter which"
"direction once it gets flattened"
"like this then then the brain the the"
"cells have no idea where the edges of"
"the brain should be and the whole thing"
"becomes a mess so what we need is a"
"contrast enhancer we need something that"
"is is a context sensitive like almost"
"like a sharpened filter that's going to"
"keep this part down but raise up this"
"part and our computational model"
"basically told us there is such a thing"
"it's called the hcn2"
"ion channel and and remarkably when we"
"try this and you can try two different"
"things you can either inject new hcn2"
"channels into the animal or you can use"
"drugs to open the native hcn2 channels"
"then you see something like this this is"
"a normal frog brain you can see"
"forebrain midbrain hindbrain this is an"
"animal that was"
"that that is expressing a mutant of a"
"very important neurogenesis gene called"
"notch so you can see the forebrain is"
"basically gone the midbrain and"
"hindbrain are a bubble this is a severe"
"brain defect they have no behavior no"
"learning nothing"
"what you can do on top of that mutation"
"you can"
"introduce these uh these ion channels"
"these hcn2 channels or in fact drugs"
"that open these channels"
and
"you can you can basically rescue this uh"
"rescue this this phenotype they have a"
"normal brain they have normal gene"
"expression and their iqs are"
"indistinguishable from controls meaning"
"they their learning rates are are"
"absolutely back to normal so we're"
"seeing here is the ability to use uh"
"our our predictive understanding of what"
"the bioelectrical circuits are doing to"
"uh to in to induce large scale changes"
"in growth and form uh on a background of"
"genetics that might have carcinogenic"
"mutations it might have uh mutations"
"that normally call birth defects cause"
"birth defects the the the bioelectric"
"software the the dynamics of these"
"circuits is what actually calls the"
"shots in the end and i want to show you"
"um one of the one of the most amazing"
"examples which has to do with these"
"planaria these are flatworms they"
"regenerate every part of their body if"
"you cut them into pieces the record is"
"something like 275 pieces what you can"
"do is you can amputate the head and the"
"tail and you can convince yourself that"
"the anterior always has this head head"
"marker expressed the posterior does not"
fine
and
"what they will do with with basically"
"100 reliability is they will regenerate"
"and so this middle trunk fragment will"
"give rise to a normal head one head one"
"tail now you can do the same thing here"
"um one head one tail gene expression"
"normal this one gives rise to a"
"two-headed animal this is not photoshop"
"these are real now why would that be if"
"i just told you that this is a 100 um"
"consistent that's because in the"
"meantime prior to cutting what we did"
"was we altered the bioelectric pattern"
"that is stably stored by the by this"
"tissue to remember how many heads a"
"planarian is supposed to have so this is"
"the normal wild type pattern this and"
"it's of course it's it's pretty messy"
"still we're still working out the"
"technology but you can see here that"
"what we've done is we've actually"
"basically incepted a pattern here that"
"says no a normal planarian has two heads"
"now this is a really critical part"
"this map this voltage map is not a map"
"of this two-headed creature this voltage"
"map is a map of this guy meaning that"
"the the bioelectrics doesn't reflect"
"what the anatomy is doing the biolecture"
"is a completely separate layer any"
"single-headed normal anatomically normal"
"worm can have one of two possible uh"
"representations internally stored in"
"this electrical circuit of what a"
"correct planarian looks like in case it"
"gets injured what is it going to do okay"
"so this is um this is basically a"
primitive
"evolutionary version of a counter"
"factual memory this animal"
"stores information for what it's going"
"to do if a particular uh scenario comes"
"up and we can rewrite that so this is a"
"neuroscience this would be equivalent to"
"um incepting false memories into mouse"
"brains without the genetics and so on so"
"so no doubt we no doubt there are more"
"than two states that can be put in this"
"is just two that we've we've nailed down"
"so far"
"so what we're doing now is trying to"
"really understand"
"how we can take the state space of these"
"electrical circuits that make one heads"
"two heads no heads and unify them with"
"formalisms that exist let's say in in"
"connectionist architectures other other"
"types of um"
"other types of formalisms to really"
"understand uh how it is that that"
"electrical circuit stores memories in"
"this in this sense okay memories that"
"can do pattern completion such that when"
"part of it is gone and memories that can"
"be re-written and why do i keep calling"
"this thing a memory i mean"
"let's just think about this if you had"
"this this two-headed worm what would"
"happen if we cut them again in plain"
"water no more drugs of any kind just"
"plain plain old water"
"uh well the standard paradigm says after"
"you've cut off the primary head in this"
"crazy ectopic secondary head the"
"genetics are untouched we haven't done"
"any genomic editing the genome is still"
"wild type in plain old water then this"
"should go back to normal now"
"liberated from from from this uh ectopic"
"tissue and the genetics are normal it"
"should just go back to uh back to a"
"single-headed worm but one interesting"
"thing is that this kind of this kind of"
"circuit that dictates this actually has"
"two stable points one at the single head"
"one at the double head state"
"and in fact when you do cut them and by"
"the way we did this experiment years"
"before we understood anything about this"
"so this was you know we we saw this we"
"saw this first um"
"something amazing happens uh they are"
"permanently two-headed so you can keep"
"cutting them and with no further"
"manipulation these middle fragments"
"continue to give rise to two-headed"
"animals now we also know how to set it"
"back so there's a different ion channel"
"modulator that will that we now know can"
"can set them back to one headed here are"
"here of videos the first time i i showed"
"this at a meeting um and somebody stood"
"up and said that's impossible those"
"animals can't exist so i bring this"
"movie so you guys can see what um"
"two-headed worms do in their in their"
"free time um"
but
"so this is this has all the basic"
"properties of memory right it's"
"long-term stable it's rewritable it has"
"conditional recall as i've shown you a"
"minute ago if you don't cut it it's"
"basically ignored it's like a latent"
"memory has discrete possible behaviors"
"and the answer to the question of how"
"many heads should a planarian have which"
"is very important because when the cells"
"are building that's the answer to when"
"are they going to stop and what are they"
"going to do is not entirely determined"
"by the genetics it's information that is"
"the genetics certainly gives you a"
"machine that has a default"
"uh electrical pattern but but it's"
"rewritable okay and it and then and we"
"can we can alter it on the fly"
"now what's what the challenge of course"
"is now is to build models of these"
"things and this is what we're doing that"
"are uh that that show the scaling so we"
"start with a"
"gene regulatory network that tells us"
"which channels are expressed in every"
"cell then you build a t from that you"
"assemble a tissue model in the simulator"
"where every cell runs this electrical"
"circuit and then you say well why is it"
"that it has certain properties over the"
"tissue scale and then eventually you"
"want to get to large scale uh models"
"that are algorithmic in"
"in their in their nature meaning that"
"they are basically you build up from the"
"from the physics and from the behavior"
"of these electrical circuits you can"
"build up basically counting and logic"
"circuits where you can see it's a human"
"understandable way of saying here's why"
"they make the decisions they make more"
"importantly what would we do if we"
"wanted them to make different decisions"
"so we've just started i don't have time"
"to go into it all but we've just started"
"using machine learning tools and here"
"are some some software"
"that are available to everybody we've"
"started making uh these machine learning"
"tools to infer the circuits that are"
"responsible for behaviors that we see"
"and then once you've done that infer"
"interventions the rare"
"interventions that can be used to to"
"push those circuits to complex outcomes"
"now what i've shown you a minute ago is"
"that we can for example convince these"
"planaria to make um"
"multiple heads but it's actually even"
"better than that what you can do"
"is cause them to make headphones that"
"belong to other species of one area"
"hundred and 100 million years distant so"
"if you amputate the head of this"
"triangular animal"
"you can um it will and you and you"
"prevent the the cells from talking to"
"each other electrically for about 48"
"hours they will make flatheads like this"
"p fellina or uh round heads like this s"
"mediterranean and not only do they make"
"uh heads shapes but brain shapes exactly"
"like these other species and"
"distributions of stem cells so there are"
"in this amorphous space there are other"
"attractors that normally are occupied by"
"other species but"
"but but individuals"
"like this with a with a with a wild type"
"genome can be pushed into that region of"
"of of amorphous space"
"uh in fact so so they land there when"
"they can't get there get their network"
"to function properly in fact you can do"
"this with um you can you can get them to"
"to to occupy regions of that amorphous"
"space that they're not used for planaria"
"at all so these weird spiky forms are"
"these three-dimensional things you know"
"flatworms don't even need to be flat so"
"we are of course using all this in"
"regenerative medicine applications so"
"here's one of our projects to induce"
"limb regeneration frogs unlike"
"salamanders don't regenerate their limbs"
"so you amputate the leg um 48 hours 45"
"days later nothing happens"
"24 hours of of manipulation of the ion"
"channels and then you can get a year and"
"a half of leg growth basically where you"
"can see there's a very early time point"
"you can see a toenail you can see some"
"toes and the leg is touch sensitive and"
"motile so so we're really trying to"
"understand what are the subroutines that"
"are there what do they measure how do"
"they make decisions and how do we uh"
"shift these these circuits"
"but the but the idea is that we're"
"trying to understand the collective"
"intelligence not how individual cells uh"
"decide to be skin or muscle or something"
"else but how does the collective decide"
"we're going to make a scar or a leg or a"
"tumor or an eye or or what so i'm just"
"going to um close up here with uh with"
"with two more slides um introducing the"
"the next talk which is this"
"you know we've talked about this"
"definition of intelligence right but"
"actually one can go beyond this and say"
"okay um the same ends but by different"
"means but what other ends can cells"
"pursue what other problem spaces can"
"they solve and actually where do these"
"uh set points come from where does the"
"target morphology actually come from and"
"i'll just show you one direction that"
"we've gone in which is to ask can cells"
"that are taken away from their normal"
"instructive micro environments"
"specifically skin cells reboot their"
"multicellularity what would they do what"
"what is the baseline of what these skin"
"cells want to do if you didn't have a"
"bunch of other cells telling them to be"
"this to have this very boring"
"two-dimensional life on the surface of"
"the animal keeping out bacteria what"
"would this new swarm agent um decide to"
do
"and so for this um we've made uh"
"this uh this new platform which we call"
"xenobots for xenopus lavish that's the"
"name of the frog um it's a it's a kind"
"of proto-novel proto-organism where and"
"josh will will tell you all about it but"
"basically with the exact same genome"
"which has normally this developmental"
"sequence and then some some tadpole"
"behaviors you can take those skin cells"
"they make something that looks like this"
"here here it is exhibiting some some"
"other kinds of behaviors they run around"
"they do various things it has a very"
"different developmental sequence it"
"doesn't look anything like a tadpole um"
"and it didn't have eons of selection to"
"be a great xenobot okay and then these"
"have the exact same frag genome so this"
"raises all kinds of questions about what"
"what um"
"uh what what what"
"kinds of kinds of things can collective"
"collective cellular intelligences do"
"when placed in a novel environment"
"within 48 hours this thing organizes"
"itself into a new creature that's never"
"existed to our knowledge never existed"
"on earth before so i'll stop there um i"
"want to thank uh the postdocs and"
"students who did all the work our"
collaborators
"um of course our our funders and the two"
"company disclosures that i have to do"
"one on uh regeneration which is"
"morphaceuticals and one about the"
"zenobots and um thank you very much i'll"
"take questions"
