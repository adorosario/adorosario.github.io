"excellent okay so uh so again thank you"
"so much for being here um"
"if uh if you want to see any of the"
"details of some of the"
"biology that i'm going to show you"
"please don't hesitate get in touch with"
me
"um there are lots of protocols papers"
"that have all the details and"
"and kind of all the nitty-gritty but"
"what i'd like to do is uh share what i"
"think are some"
"of the key messages from the work that"
"we've been doing and you can you can"
"find me at these two"
sites
"so uh the main points for today i want"
"to tell you a few things um i want to"
"tell you that"
"biological systems have remarkable"
"structural and functional plasticity"
"that goes really way beyond"
"the default outcomes that we associate"
"with any particular species"
"and i want to introduce you to the"
"concepts of anatomical homeostasis"
"and the idea that there is some top-down"
"control of collective outcomes and that"
"it's not all"
"of the emergence from the bottom up and"
"i want to tell you that bioelectric"
networks
"is how evolution expanded the boundaries"
"of cells into organisms"
"allowing their goals to get bigger and"
"this has"
"really important implications for"
"understanding the reprogrammability of"
life
"and the hardware software distinction"
"that i'll try to make about living"
things
"and the hypothesis that i want to put"
"out there is that there's"
"in biology there's this multi-scale"
"autonomy of goal seeking subunits"
"which brings the risk of cancer and it"
"brings the uh"
"potential for some of these sub units to"
"defect from the global plan"
"but actually overall is the key to"
"adaptive robustness"
"and what it's what allows biology to be"
"extremely reliable at large scale"
"despite the fact that it's working with"
"uh huge amounts of noise and"
"unreliability at the micro scale and"
"we'll talk at the end about how i think"
"this really facilitates evolvability in"
"general and why why life is so highly"
evolvable
"so uh in in a single sentence what i'm"
"going to show you is that like the brain"
"somatic tissues form electrical networks"
"that make decisions"
"and these are decisions about anatomy"
"and this is a proto-cognitive"
"system that can be exploited to"
"understand how we can program"
"sell swarms top down towards large scale"
"outcomes and i'm showing you this"
"five-legged frog to warn you in advance"
"you're gonna see all kinds of really"
"weird creatures in this talk"
"none of this is photoshop these are"
"actual living things that are in our lab"
"and we create them to test our theories"
"of of how"
"uh cell collectives are guided towards"
"specific anatomies"
"so uh this is at the center of a really"
"interesting emerging field"
"that intersects developmental biology"
"basal cognition"
"and computer science what we see is that"
"there is complex decision making at all"
"levels and scales all the way from"
"molecular networks up through groups of"
"organisms and everything in between"
"and these parts are unreliable but very"
"smart and"
"the the magic of biology appears through"
"the combination of bottom-up emergence"
"and top-down representation and"
"reprogrammability and i'm going to show"
you
"some examples of this so let's start"
"with let's start with this this is"
"a simple example of the robustness of"
"function in altered body plans"
"what you're seeing here is a tadpole and"
"what you'll notice is that this tadpole"
"of a frog"
"it is missing its primary eyes in the"
"head so there are no eyes in the head"
"but we've induced an eye to form in the"
"tail and i'll tell you later how we do"
this
"but here's an eye in the tail and the"
"amazing thing is that this animal"
"in this brain which evolved for millions"
"of years to expect"
"visual input from a particular location"
"in the head"
"these animals can actually see out of"
"their eye perfectly well"
"and the reason they can see is because"
"this eye finding itself in the tail"
"uh puts out a spinal puts out a um an"
"optic nerve"
"the optic nerve looks around it finds"
"the spinal cord and synapses on the"
"spinal cord and then that in that"
"information gets passed up towards the"
"brain and so look at the"
"incredible plasticity of this of this"
"system all of the behavioral repertoires"
"the visual learning and everything else"
"are remapped onto this novel"
architecture
"where the sense organs are are in the"
wrong
"location and so what this is showing you"
"is that uh the brain can dynamically"
"adjust its behavioral programs"
"to accommodate different body"
"architectures but why would this"
"why would this be i mean most most"
"tadpoles are are perfectly normal"
"the the vast majority of them have the"
"eyes in the correct spot why would this"
"plasticity exist"
"and this is going to be a theme"
"throughout the throughout the talk"
"so um let's think about now the the"
"relationship of the mind brain and the"
body
"here on the left you see a caterpillar"
"this is a soft bodied robot"
"it crawls and it chews plants this thing"
"has to become"
"something very different it has to"
"become a butterfly which is a"
"hard-bodied robot that flies"
"and drinks nectar the amazing thing is"
"that uh"
"the memories that caterpillars make"
survive
"into butterflies and what's amazing"
"about it is because during this process"
"as the during metamorphosis the"
"caterpillar becomes the butterfly"
"its brain is basically liquefied so so"
"most of the synapses are taken apart"
"many of the cells die"
"and it basically reassembles a brand new"
"brain and yet the memories remain"
"so what is this uh what are the"
"implications of this for models of"
"learning for example in in"
"artificial neural networks where all of"
"the information"
"during learning is stored as these very"
"finely tuned synaptic weights i mean"
"this in in biology all of this uh can be"
"can be drastically remodeled and"
"and altered and the information still"
"remains so we really need to understand"
"how this works and how the biology"
"uh manages to to to um uh"
"do this kind of uh transfer learning in"
"effect of taking information that made"
"sense to a caterpillar"
"and and converting it into information"
"that's suitable for a completely"
different
"body architecture okay now in planaria"
"these are flatworms that you'll hear a"
"lot about today this is even"
"uh this is even more profound where we"
"can take a single worm"
"we can teach them something simple like"
"to associate a certain pattern of"
"roughness on the floor of the dish with"
"with their food we then chop off the"
"head and the brain"
"we take the tail fragment the tails"
"regenerate that's one of the remarkable"
"things about plenary is that they"
"regenerate entire"
"bodies they will regenerate their brain"
"and as soon as that brain is complete"
"the rest of the body has imprinted that"
"information onto it because now"
"the new the the resulting animal still"
remembers
"okay so the memory is is stored"
"somewhere else we're not exactly sure"
where
"but it's imprinted onto a brand new"
brain
"so these kind of models show you that in"
"biology we don't just deal with a"
"a static or a fixed type of organism and"
"we ask how it has behavior and memory"
"and iq and things like this"
"but really the body is incredibly"
"plastic and these types of models"
"raise questions about what really is a"
"memory you know how is it stored how is"
"it encoded how is it decoded and"
transferred
"from one set of tissues onto another and"
"this has not only major biomedical"
"implications because"
"of course pretty soon we'll all be"
"receiving transplants of naive stem"
"cells for various degenerative diseases"
"of the brain"
"but also it has major implications for"
"philosophy of mind and asking what"
"exactly is a memory"
"that that it can be housed in a in a"
"substrate like this that can be altered"
"okay so we really need to understand"
"what controls the pattern of the body in"
"the first place and this"
"uh it may seem to a lot of people that"
"that biology kind of has this handle but"
"i want to show you that there are"
"still deep puzzles in this in this area"
"so we all start life as a single cell a"
"fertilized egg"
"and this divides a few times and we have"
"these embryonic blastomeres a bunch of"
"cells sitting together"
"and then they reliably self-assemble"
"into an incredibly complex machine"
"what you're seeing here is a"
"cross-section through a human torso"
"so you see that all of these organs and"
"tissues have to end up in exactly the"
right
"location they're exactly the right"
"topological relationship to each other"
"and so one question is where does this"
"pattern come from and of course"
"immediately people think of dna but if"
"you actually read a genome what you see"
"is protein sequences"
"you don't see anything in the genome"
"directly about uh the"
"the type of symmetry that this animal is"
"going to have size the shape the kinds"
"of organs and none of that is directly"
"in the genome all the genome tells you"
"about is proteins"
"so so the question is how do cell groups"
"actually know what to make"
"how do they know when to stop what can"
"we do to"
"convince them to repair this kind of"
"structure if it's been injured"
"and of course as engineers and"
"especially in synthetic biology and"
"artificial life"
"we would like to know how far can we"
"push this process so if we wanted these"
"cells to build something completely"
different
"okay would that be possible or can they"
"only make one thing and i'm going to"
"show you that the answer is"
"they can build lots of different things"
so
"uh the current paradigm for all of this"
"is something like this that"
"the genes interact in networks some of"
"these networks make proteins the"
proteins
"interact via physics so maybe they're"
"sticky or they exert force or they do"
"they diffuse they do various things and"
"then of course there's this wonderful"
"process of emergence"
"and outcome something amazing like the"
"salamander this axolotl"
"but this has a fundamental difficulty"
"and the difficulty is a kind of inverse"
problem
"what molecules would you tweak at the"
"lowest level of description"
"to give you desired system level"
"outcomes and this"
"and it's a very hard problem it's a"
"problem both for uh biomedicine"
"but also for evolution and for the"
"animal itself"
"and the amazing thing of course is that"
"embryogenesis is reliable"
"it's extremely reliable but it is not"
hardwired
"and so for example if you take an early"
"early embryo"
"and you split it in half you don't get"
"two half embryos the way you would with"
"most of our human artifacts"
"but you actually get two perfectly"
"normal monozygotic twins you can do the"
"opposite experiment you can take two"
"mouse embryos for example mush them"
"together like a snowball"
"and out comes a perfectly normal mouse"
"so what you're seeing here already is"
"that while the process is reliable"
"it has the ability to regulate to a"
"specific outcome following really"
"drastic perturbations"
"okay so it's not it's not hardwired in"
"the sense of having the same set of"
"steps each time"
"in adulthood some animals like this"
axolotl
"are able to perform this trick and they"
regenerate
"large portions of their body so these"
"axolotls can regrow their limbs"
"their eyes their jaws parts of the brain"
"their heart"
"tail of ovaries and various other organs"
"and if you amputate the limb"
"what happens is it will undergo a set of"
"deformations a bunch of cells will grow"
"and then it makes a perfect replica of"
"the original and then it stops"
"and this is the most profound mystery of"
"all of this is how does it know when to"
stop
"because it stops exactly when a correct"
"salamander limb"
"has been formed so we really need to"
"understand that process and"
"this is uh this is an old experiment"
"that was done that illustrates the kind"
of
"um the the kind of analysis that the"
"system is able to do"
"where what they what they've done is"
"they took a a tail from a salamander"
"and they surgically grafted it onto the"
"flank where"
"the where where a leg is supposed to go"
"and what happens is within some amount"
"of time this tail"
"remodels it becomes a leg even the cells"
"at the tip of that tail start to become"
fingers
"so what you're seeing here is that the"
"individual cells"
"are given cues that are counteracting"
"what their local situation is locally"
"the cells at the tip of that tail"
"are fine they're at the you know they're"
"at the end of a tail so they're doing"
fine
"but globally this is not correct with"
"respect to the overall structure"
"so there's this large-scale body plan"
"and there's information that's"
constantly
"uh making sure that that the individual"
"cells are doing the right thing"
"to be a correct structure so this"
"this theme of of of an anatomical set"
"point comes back again and again"
"and in planaria it's even more"
"impressive where so here are these flat"
worms
"they have a brain they have a nervous"
"system most of the same"
"neurotransmitters that you and i have"
"and they have this amazing ability that"
"you can cut them into pieces"
"uh in fact any any plane that you want"
"i've only shown one kind of cut here but"
"you can cut them in any direction"
"the record is something like 275 pieces"
"and uh every piece will regrow exactly"
"what's missing no more no less until you"
"get a perfect little worm"
"so this is an amazing system that has"
"this kind of holographic type of"
"uh knowledge of what a correct worm"
"looks like because every"
"piece of this can do it and in fact"
"they're so good at it they're basically"
"immortal there's no such thing as"
"an old planarian the individual cells"
"will sense and die but it continuously"
"regenerates them"
"okay so the animals that we have in our"
"lab are basically in direct physical"
"continuity with animals that were here"
"almost half a billion years ago"
"so you can see you can see the power of"
"this of this ability to restore"
"to a particular shape and this is not um"
"just for the so-called lower animals"
"human liver of course regenerates um"
"children's fingertips regenerate"
"uh from from certain types of uh"
"amputation wounds"
"and deer a large adult mammal also"
regenerates
"a huge amount of bone and and"
"innervation and vasculature and skin"
"every year as they shed and regrow their"
antlers
"now one of the cool things about"
"regeneration and development really is"
that
"here you can see how large scale"
"patterning information"
"overrides individual cell states so if"
"you have"
"a tumor on the on a limb and you"
"amputate through the middle of that"
tumor
"or you take aggressive carcinoma cells"
"and you stick them into the"
"um the into a mouse embryo you will get"
"a perfectly normal"
"mouse and you will get a perfectly"
"normal salamander limb these cells"
"are being normalized by the information"
"that's coming down towards them from the"
"rest of the body telling them what they"
"should be doing"
"and this is really key these large-scale"
"global patterning plans are really"
important
"so what i've told you so far is that"
"living the"
"anatomy is incredibly plastic and it has"
"the ability to repair"
"toward specific anatomical states from"
"different starting conditions"
"and this is this is i think the right"
"way to think about this"
"is as collective decision making in cell"
swarms
"now most of biology is currently focused"
"on thinking about"
"uh stem cells the role of stem cells in"
"this process and genomic editing"
"and working at the level of the of the"
"genome and i'm going to show you"
"at least two of the major puzzles that"
"we have and this is why i think"
"fields like artificial life have"
"potentially a huge amount of impact that"
"they can make"
"in uh regenerative medicine and and bio"
"uh biomedicine as a whole"
"so one question would be this so"
"planaria unlike"
"the rest of us you know most of us if we"
"have a mutation in our body"
"and during our lifetime our children do"
"not inherit that mutation"
"but planaria because some species"
"reproduce by fission"
"meaning they just divide they tear"
"themselves in half and then each half"
"regrows and now you got two worms"
"so that means that they have what's"
"called somatic inheritance"
"every mutation that doesn't kill the"
"stem cell ends up propagating and"
"amplifying in the next generation so"
"their genomes are an incredible mess"
"hundreds of millions millions of years"
"of accumulating all these mutations in"
"fact we don't even have a proper"
"assembly for the species that we work"
with
"the cells are mixoploid meaning they"
"have different numbers of chromosomes"
"so the the genome is all over the place"
"but they are rock solid regenerators 100"
"perfect every single time and so it's"
"quite clear that we don't really"
"understand very well the relationship"
"between the genome and the anatomy"
"when you can you can make such a mess of"
"the genome and still have complete"
"uh total anatomical fidelity and in fact"
"there's a thought experiment you can do"
"which is that if you take two planaria"
"with different head shapes so you have a"
"let's say a flat head and a round head"
planaria
"and you take some stem cells from uh"
"from the flat head and you you inject"
them
"into the round head and this is a"
"procedure that people do"
"and then you let them sort of mix around"
"and get comfortable and then you"
"amputate the head"
"off of the resulting animal what head"
"shape will you get and"
"the important thing isn't the answer the"
"important thing is that none of the"
"models that we currently have"
"all the all the molecular information"
"about how stem cells turn into different"
"cell types and all of that"
"we don't have any models to make a"
"prediction about this experiment"
"and that's because we we understand the"
"mechanisms of cell specification uh"
"pretty well but we really don't"
"understand the algorithms here at all we"
"don't understand how the collective"
"makes decisions"
"about what head shape will be uh enough"
"to make the cells stop rebuilding"
"okay and how how the cells decide that a"
"correct head shape has been formed we"
"really don't understand this at all"
"and so this kind of collective"
"intelligence is is something that"
"uh is i think artificial life can really"
"contribute so"
"individual cells are extremely competent"
"so here what you see is"
"a single cell this thing is called the"
"lacrimaria it has no brain"
"no nervous system no stem cells just one"
"cell and"
"um you see that it's basically handling"
"all of its morphological"
"um behavioral and physiological needs at"
"the level of a single cell it's quite"
"quite competent in what it does"
"we would love to have soft body robots"
"that have this this degree of uh"
"of dynamic control it's it's it's"
"hunting for bacteria in its environment"
"right here"
"and so the the cool thing is that um"
"these cells did not"
"give up their intelligence when they"
"joined into bodies but"
"what they did have to do is learn how to"
"cooperate towards much larger goals"
"so this this animal has all kinds of"
"homeostatic little little tiny"
"cell level homeostatic states that it's"
"trying to maintain but when they get"
together
"they maintain large ones and what i mean"
"by that is"
"illustrated in this experiment so in"
"order to become"
"a frog tadpoles have to rearrange their"
face
"because tadpole faces look quite"
"different from frog faces so they have"
"to move their eyes their nostrils their"
"brains their jaws things have to kind of"
"move around and deform to go from"
"tadpole to frog"
"and the what we found was that well it"
"used to be thought that what the genome"
"somehow encoded was a set of"
"hardwired movements that basically since"
"all tadpoles look the same and all frogs"
"look the same"
"if you just move everything the same"
"amount every single time you'll get from"
"a tadpole to a frog"
"so what we made was these uh what we"
"call um picasso tadpoles these are"
"basically tadpoles where everything is"
"in the wrong place"
"the eyes are on the back of the head the"
"jaws are off to the side the nostrils"
"are up on top"
"everything is just all over the place"
"and the amazing thing is that these"
tadpoles
"largely become perfectly normal frogs"
"all of these organs"
"move around in really unnatural"
configurations
"such that they will still end up"
"eventually in a correct frog face and"
"then they stop"
"so what the genetics does not specify is"
"a set of specific movements"
"it gives you a piece of hardware that"
"executes a highly flexible program"
"that does error reduction what it does"
"is continue to deform"
"and from from from unexpected starting"
conditions
"until uh the error towards a specific"
"final outcome is minimized"
"and so this raises an obvious question"
"which is that how are these"
"collective goals set how does the system"
"know what a correct"
"frog looks like and so what we do in our"
"group is"
"we study we've added to this kind of"
"feed forward system we've added these"
"feedback loops"
"that allow both at the genetic and at"
"the physical level and this is the one"
"the physics is what i'm going to tell"
"you about today um they allow a"
"progressive reduction of error"
"so this is basically a homeostatic loop"
"uh anybody who"
"has worked with a thermostat or does"
"control theory or anything else will"
"recognize this immediately"
"this is pat this is a a simple"
"homeostatic loop"
"but what's new about this is that the"
"set point of this is not"
"a single number or something simple like"
"metabolic state or ph or something like"
that
"the set point here is a complex"
anatomical
"state and if the animal is or plant is"
"deviated from that"
"anatomical state and this could be an"
"injury but it could also be a mutation"
"or teratogens or anything else that"
"deviates the animal from the correct"
"large scale plan then a bunch of"
"mechanisms kick in that will try to make"
changes
"to reduce that error and so this"
"and this is this is a very"
"non-mainstream kind of view of of"
"of how this this part of biology is"
"supposed to work"
"suggests a novel a novel strategy"
"instead of"
"targeting the individual genes and and"
"trying to intervene at the lowest level"
"of genes and proteins which is where a"
"majority of the work today is focused"
"could we simply rewrite the goal state"
"could we reset"
"the set point if in fact there is a set"
"point if the tissues are storing"
"some kind of a representation of what"
"they're supposed to be building and"
repairing
"could we simply alter that leave the"
"cells alone and let them do what they do"
best
"which is which is built to that spec and"
"the reason this is an important strategy"
"is because currently biology is very"
"good at this it's very good at"
"figuring out what genes interact with"
"other genes what we'd really like to"
"understand is anatomy we'd really like"
"to understand what makes a hand"
"different from a foot"
"and we'd like to even more so understand"
the
"uh dynamical goal directedness of of"
"this process how it is that you can get"
"from different starting positions"
"to the same outcome even with these uh"
"perturbations along the way"
"and so the end game of all this what we"
"would like to have at the end of all our"
work
"and and we're nowhere near this by the"
"way but but this is it's good to have an"
"idea of what the"
"what the goal is the uh the the end the"
"end game for all of this is a kind of"
"anatomical compiler"
"that what we would like to be able to do"
"is to sit down in front of a system that"
"is almost like a cad"
"system and we would like to draw our"
"animal at the level of anatomy so here"
"it is i'd like this worm i'd like it to"
"have three heads in the shape of this"
tea
"um i want uh you know six eyes and the"
"and the nervous system should be shaped"
"like this you want to be able to design"
"living form at the level of anatomy and"
"have the system compile down into a set"
of
"low-level uh instructions that you would"
"have to give to the collective to make"
"it do this"
"and what we would like to do is which is"
"which is i think different from"
"from from mainstream is to really"
"exploit this"
"pattern homeostasis we want to offload"
"all that complexity onto the cells"
"and control this whole thing with inputs"
"or experiences or stimuli"
"not rewiring the cellular hardware and"
"the reason that's important"
"is because look what's happened in in"
"computer science back in the day in"
"order to program"
"you had to rewire the you have to you"
"had to you had to rewire the machine you"
"had to interact with it at the level of"
hardware
"and of course i don't need to tell this"
"audience what the what the incredible"
"progress has been made by realizing that"
"if the hardware is good"
"enough then you don't need to rewire it"
"to run different kinds of software and"
"have different kinds of outcomes"
"you can work at a higher level tracking"
"the algorithm"
"and you can program the thing with"
"inputs or experiences or stimuli"
"not by physical rewiring so then the"
"question becomes"
"how reprogrammable is the biological"
"hardware is it really reprogrammable i'm"
"going to try to"
"convince you that the answer is yes so"
"how would we go about"
"rewriting these anatomical goal states"
"the states that collectives try to"
"implement how"
"how would we go about rewriting them so"
"we had"
"one example of the one obvious example"
"of this and that's the brain and in the"
brain
"the way things work is that the hardware"
"is a set of"
"cells that are connected by electrical"
"uh synapses"
"and each cell has these little ion"
"channels which are these these proteins"
"that allow ions to go in and out"
"they set an electrical state and that"
"state might propagate to the neighbor so"
"you've got this electrical network where"
"every cell"
"tries to occupy some particular resting"
"potential or electrical gradient"
"and then those gradients can propagate"
"through the network and that's the"
hardware
"and it is thought that this hardware"
underlies
"the software that we that we see as"
"behavior and and and cognition so here"
"what you're seeing here is is some"
"some voltage and calcium imaging of a"
"zebrafish brain"
"a live fish as it's thinking about uh"
"you know various things in that assay"
"and there's this idea of neural decoding"
"the idea is that if we only knew how to"
"interpret these electrical signals we"
"would know what the animal was thinking"
"about and there's been some"
"some progress on this trying to infer uh"
"semantic cognitive states from"
"maps of of real-time electrical activity"
"well it turns out the amazing thing is"
"that it turns out that all cells do this"
"so all cells have ion channels most"
"cells have electrical synapses to their"
neighbors
"and what you're seeing here in the"
"bottom right"
"is a an early frog embryo and the"
"different colors are"
"uh the the output of a voltage sensitive"
"fluorescent dye"
"very much like what you see in the fish"
"above and it's showing you all the"
"electrical conversations that cells are"
"having with each other"
"now what these cells are trying to"
"figure out is who's going to be"
"anterior who's going to be posterior"
"left and right dorsal ventral"
"they're trying to sort out all of the"
"anatomical decisions that"
"have to be made to build an embryo but"
"we have"
"the same task in our group which is"
"cracking the bioelectric code"
"we want to be able to read these"
"electrical patterns and understand"
"what the cells are saying to each other"
"in terms of uh"
"getting closer and closer to that"
"anatomical set point"
"now the tools that we've developed for"
"this so so i've shown you the voltage"
die
"we also do a lot of uh computational"
"simulation to try to understand"
"from the expression of various channel"
"genes how do you get to the voltage"
"patterns that we see here so we try to"
"understand these voltage patterns"
"and i'm going to show you two quick"
"examples of real patterns the one above"
"here and this is a a"
"time lapse movie of a frog embryo"
"putting its face together and you can"
"see there's all sorts of complex"
"electrical activity and this is this is"
"time lapse uh over over about uh 12 or"
"18 hours"
"and the uh this is one frame on the"
"right is one frame taken out of that"
"movie and you see something amazing what"
"you see here is that"
"um the bright is where the depolarized"
"cells sit and"
"what you see is that the future pattern"
"of gene expression and"
"and of the anatomy of the face is"
"already partially laid out"
"in this electrical pre pattern these"
"electrical traces are"
"a a pre pre-pattern a scaffold"
"an early memory of what the face is"
"supposed to look like and then these"
"electrical properties guide the genes"
"that turn on and off"
"to then build so you can see here off to"
"the side the placards you can see the"
eye
"here the the the animal's right eye the"
"left one comes back comes in later"
"you can see the mouth all of these"
"things are here and this is"
"a critical aspect of building the face"
"and now if we were to artificially"
"change this electrical pattern if i uh"
"take these eye"
"cells here and i and i hyper polarize"
"them and then put a depolarized eye spot"
"somewhere else"
"guess where the eye will form it will"
"form somewhere else and so that is how"
"we made those picasso tadpoles i told"
"you about it was by messing with this"
"native pre pattern so this is a an"
endogenous
"pre-pattern of of of um"
"guiding how the face is developing now"
"there are also pathological patterns"
"we're going to talk about cancer in a"
"few minutes"
"but basically what you can see here's a"
"here's a tumor in a tadpole that's"
"induced by putting in an oncogene from a"
"from a nasty human mutation"
"and it makes these tumors but even"
"before the tumors are"
"uh anatomically apparent you can already"
"see from the voltage map that these"
"cells are aberrant they're not like"
"their neighbors what they've done is"
"shut off"
"their electrical communication and"
"they've basically started to go"
"unicellular they've they're starting to"
"treat the rest of the animal as just"
"environment they're not in electrical"
"connection with a hole and this will"
"become really important towards the end"
"so so this this has obvious diagnostic"
potential
"but aside from from being able to track"
"and model those patterns"
"of course what we really need to do is"
"to be able to edit them on the fly we"
"really need to be able to read and write"
"these electrical states and so the way"
"we do that we don't apply"
"any electrical fields okay this is"
"important to know there's no electrodes"
"there's no batteries we're not"
"ever we never apply electric fields what"
"we do"
"is we go in and guided by our computer"
"models we"
"open and close the native ion channels"
"and electrical synapses or gap junctions"
that
"control these networks so here's a"
"here's a non-neural um"
"tissue in the body and what we will do"
"is we can either open or close"
"these different synapses and that means"
"we control the topology"
"of the network and we can set directly"
"using either drugs or optogenetics or"
"mis-expression of various channel genes"
"we can set the electrical potential of"
"whatever cells we like"
"so now we have the the control of cell"
state
"and the propagation of those states to"
"other neighbors okay so we have some"
"some degree of control over these"
"electrical states"
"okay so so what um why why why is any of"
"this interesting well"
"it's interesting because when you do"
"this you can make radical"
"uh coherent changes to anatomy so here's"
"one example on the left"
"what you're seeing here is a frog embryo"
"some of the cells that are going to"
"become gut were injected"
"with one particular ion channel rna to"
"set them to"
"set the voltage to an i like state and"
"these gut cells"
"make an eye now several things are"
"interesting first of all"
"it was prior to this it was thought that"
"only anterior neural cells up here are"
"even competent to become i"
"that's not true you can make i out of"
"almost any any cell group in the body"
"that's the first the second thing is"
"that this eye is really complex if you"
"section it you find retina"
"optic nerve all the kinds of things you"
"would find in a real eye"
"but we didn't have to specify any of"
"that all we specified was a very"
"simple uh input that says build an eye"
"here and so so probably no surprise to"
"this audience it looks very much like a"
"subroutine call"
"what we found is a hook into the native"
"program that this animal uses to build"
"an eye and it turns out you can call"
that
"uh that module almost anywhere okay and"
"the subroutine call for this is an"
"electrical a spatial electrical state"
"now here's another example here's a"
"planarian you amputate the head and the"
tail
"and this middle fragment has to figure"
"out how many heads it's supposed to have"
"and where does the head go and where"
"does the tail go"
"and what you will see here is that it"
"has this interesting voltage gradient"
"that says put the head right here where"
the
"where the depolarized or red cells are"
"and if we artificially manipulate this"
"gradient and depolarize back here"
"then these cells this is the pattern"
"that the cells are consulting to know"
"what to do"
"if you change the pattern they don't"
"know any better this is their this is"
"their reference frame"
"and they will then happily build a"
"two-headed worm or in fact a no-headed"
"worm depending on how you"
"uh change the change the pattern and"
"it's that same modularity you know we"
"don't know how to build a planarian head"
"from scratch we don't know how to"
"manage all the different complexities"
"that go inside that planarian head"
"but we do know the the signal that now"
"says build and build a"
"head right here it's a high level"
"amorphous genetic signal"
"now in this in this example what you're"
"seeing is"
"us triggering a second normal head these"
"heads are completely normal and it's a"
"normal head belonging to this species"
"and why why do i make that distinction"
"because actually you can call up heads"
"belonging to other species"
"so you start off you start off with a"
"planarian with a triangular head"
"chop off the head we don't touch the"
"genome at all so in all of these cases"
"the cells are are completely wild-type"
"what we do is we perturb the electrical"
"network in a way that lowers the ability"
"of the cells to communicate for a while"
"and then we wash out that drug and this"
"and the network settles back down"
"into a different uh bioelectric state"
"and sometimes it settles back down into"
"the same attractor that it used to have"
"and so it builds this"
"this nice triangular head but sometimes"
"stochastically it will"
"settle down into uh states corresponding"
"to a flathead"
"like a pifalina worm or a round head"
"like an s mediterranean worm"
"now these animals are about oh between"
"100 and 150 million years of evolution"
"distant from this guy with a triangular"
head
"and um the the odds of getting any one"
"of these heads is roughly proportional"
"to the evolutionary distance between"
"these species"
"so what you can see here is that without"
"touching the dna at all"
"you can call up uh attractors in the"
"state space of this bioelectric circuit"
"that correspond to other ways of being a"
planarian
"other species of planaria and it's not"
"just external"
"head shape it's also the shape of the"
"brain and it's also"
"this is the the green thing here and"
"it's also the distribution of stem cells"
"that becomes exactly like these"
"other species so now okay so we can make"
"extra heads we can make heads belonging"
"to other species"
"but we can also explore areas of the"
"amorphous space that are not currently"
occupied
"by evolution probably because they're"
"not viable ecologically"
"so they just wouldn't wouldn't survive"
"in the real world but you can from"
"perfectly normal planarian cells you can"
"make these spiky forms like this"
"you can make these cylindrical things or"
"you could make this that"
"that is basically a planarian with a big"
"tube growing out of it"
"so these are all other regions of of"
"amorphous space and this is an example"
of
"life as it could be and it doesn't"
"require any changes in the dna"
"it requires changes in the software the"
"electrical conversations"
"that these cells are having with each"
"other to figure out what they should be"
building
"and you can explore this morphospace"
"using the using these cells"
"that we have now one important thing to"
"realize and i'm not going to"
"spend a lot of time on this but let's"
"not um be misled to think that"
"all we're able to do is screw up normal"
"patterning okay"
"uh the point is not that we can mess up"
"the system and get"
"and get monsters the point is that we"
"now have uh pretty"
"at least in some of these cases pretty"
"good computational understanding of"
"where the bioelectric signals come from"
"and how to change them"
"so we can now actually induce rational"
repair
"so this is just an example of using our"
"computational model to take"
"tadpoles that have this this really"
"drastic defect it's a birth defect"
"induced by either mutations or"
"teratogens like alcohol nicotine things"
"like that"
"and we are able to rationally repair"
from
"by by by designing a strategy of channel"
"opening and closing"
"that will actually get you from this"
"horrible defective state to a perfectly"
normal
"uh tadpole brain where they get their"
"iqs back they get their behavior back"
"and so on"
"uh because we're able to modulate this"
"electrical pre-pattern"
"so so we're gaining some some pretty"
"good degree of control over this now"
"and so one of the important things that"
"we've learned and i want to talk to you"
"about this"
"this concept of pattern memory and the"
"idea that these electrical circuits"
"store memories and they store they"
"stably store"
"patterns that are not the genetic"
"default so here's here's an example here"
is
"on the left here you see a one-headed"
worm
"and if you ask where are the head genes"
"expressed well they're expressed right"
"here at the head"
"like they should be here's another"
"one-headed worm again one head one tail"
"where are the head genes expressed right"
"here at the head now"
"if we amputate the head and the tail"
"this fragment gives us a normal"
"one-headed worm"
"this fragment is going to give us a"
"two-headed worm now why in the world"
"would this guy give us a two-headed worm"
"and that would be because in the"
"meantime what we've done"
"is we've altered the internal"
"representation of what a correct worm is"
"supposed to look like"
"so here you see the the the real pattern"
"the wild type pattern"
"has one depolarized end one"
"hyperpolarized in so one head"
"one tail what we've done and you can see"
"it's pretty messy the technology is"
still
"relatively relatively new we only came"
"up with this stuff you know about 10"
"years ago"
"um so we're still we're still working"
"out the the kinks but what you can see"
"here is that we can we can alter this"
"bioelectric pattern"
"and in this one-headed animal"
"it can store one of two paws at least"
"one of two possible memories probably"
"more but but we know we know it can"
"store two"
"so this pattern memory sits there and it"
"doesn't do"
"anything to the anatomy the anatomy is"
"still one-headed this is not"
"a readout of what the anatomy is now it"
"is a counter factual"
"representation of what the animal is"
"going to do"
"in the future if it gets injured that's"
"pretty important let's let's"
"let's think about this for a moment this"
"bioelectric state is not"
"simply a readout of what the anatomy is"
"now it is"
"a a representation a stored"
"information structure that tells this"
"collective what to build"
"if it should get injured okay and so uh"
"a single a single body can store at"
"least one of two"
"ideas of what a uh what a correct worm"
"looks like"
"and the you know originally when we came"
"up with some of these ideas of of set"
"points and so on"
"people are very nervous about this"
"because because the molecular biologists"
"do not like this idea"
"of cells that are not brains"
"uh having some sort of goals or having a"
"stored representation of what's going to"
"happen in the future people are really"
"much more into the"
"emergent feedfall kind of feed forward"
"emerge in paradigm but what you're"
"seeing here is that we can now literally"
"see these gold states we can see the set"
"points they"
"they're they're right there and not only"
"can you see them you can rewrite them"
"so let's talk about what happens next so"
here's
"so here's a worm uh we've amputated the"
"head and the tail using our knowledge of"
"the electric circuit"
"we've treated it with a particular drug"
"that blocks"
"uh uh either either blocks the gap"
"junctions or it"
"perturbs um perturbs chloride signaling"
"and as a result you get these uh you get"
"this this this two-headed"
"this two-headed animal now the question"
"becomes you wait a few weeks"
"the drug by the way disappears we can"
"then we can show that the drug"
disappears
"after about 48 hours so you wait a few"
"weeks and then in plain water"
"with no more manipulation of any kind"
"we're going to chop off"
"this ectopic ectopic head we're going to"
"chop off the primary head we're going to"
"leave just that middle fragment that"
"normal gut piece"
"and we're going to ask what does it now"
"regenerate so the standard paradigm"
"says that okay you've gotten rid of this"
"this crazy reprogrammed head tissue"
"that's gone"
"the genetics are untouched the genomic"
"sequence is still the same"
"so so surely what must happen is that"
"this piece is going to regenerate us a"
"normal one-headed worm but actually"
"um you can make models of this of this"
"process whereby there's another stable"
"attractor that corresponds"
"to a two-headed state that perpetuates"
"and so when we cut this worm the reason"
"i'm i'm telling you all this"
"is because of course that's exactly what"
"happens when you cut this two-headed"
worm
"uh again and again as far as we can tell"
"forever it continues to be"
"to to regenerate as two-headed think of"
"what this means"
"a brief change a brief experience of"
"that bioelectric circuit"
"okay leads to a permanent"
"alteration of the pattern to which the"
"animal regenerates upon damage"
"the encoded pattern of what a correct"
"planarian is"
"is rewritable and once it's rewritable"
"it's stable"
"it keeps now now as of as of last year"
"we now know how to force it back to"
"normal so we can take a two-headed worm"
"and now we can turn it back into a"
"one-headed worm"
"so the reason i call these things a"
"memory is is several-fold first it is"
"it's long-term stable like a memory is"
"supposed to be it's"
"it's labile meaning it's rewritable we"
"finally learn how to rewrite it"
"it has conditional recall like that uh"
"pattern memory i showed you a minute ago"
"it is completely latent until the animal"
is
"injured and then it is recalled and then"
"it is it is used"
"and it uses the same mechanisms ion"
"channels and electrical synapses"
"as the brain uses to maintain uh"
"behavioral memory the familiar kind of"
"memory that you're used to"
"so what we're doing now is is we're"
"trying to have a real multi-scale"
"understanding of this process whereby we"
build
"computational models of the electrical"
"circuit and the genetics downstream of"
it
"we try to understand at a larger scale"
"where the attractors"
"of that state space are and how"
particular
"experiments end up in one or another of"
"these large-scale attractor states"
"okay and so and so we've also toyed with"
"models like this"
"where uh specific attractors in this uh"
"in this state space are like like"
"memories and various kinds of artificial"
"neural networks where"
"they're basically representations of"
"specific different kinds of"
"uh of kinds of plenary and layouts and"
"then these electrical states"
"trigger different cell behaviors that"
build
"according to whatever that pattern"
"memory is okay and this this this may be"
"maybe this model may be right or it may"
"not but this is the kind of thing we've"
"been working on"
"so one of the critical things here then"
"is to understand what's going on with"
"the dna so people"
"usually think of dna as the software of"
"the cell and what i'd like to do is"
propose
"a complementary view which is that"
"what the dna gives you is the hardware"
"the dna"
"tells every cell what proteins is but"
"specifically ion channel proteins and"
"and of course like the chemical"
"signaling machinery what proteins it"
"gets to have"
"but once you've nailed down what the"
"hardware looks like"
"this forms an excitable memory uh"
"excitable medium with some really"
"interesting properties it has"
"it has symmetry breaking dynamics that"
normally
"reliably break to a very specific"
"pattern and this is what you see in"
"normal embryogenesis the same thing"
"every single time"
"but it is also uh it also has memory"
"properties where if you alter it"
"the new pattern will be kept and so what"
"you're seeing here"
"is just a simulation of of a set of"
tissues
"all of which have the same ion channels"
"so the genetics is the same for every"
cell
"but you see here very complex patterns"
"that are"
"that are able to form for through"
"dynamic symmetry breaking"
"and and uh biochemists are already used"
"to this in terms of touring patterns"
"spontaneous touring patterns and things"
"like that"
"but this is uh this is this is new in"
"the in the area of bioelectrics"
"because we can see that this genetically"
"determined hardware"
"is able to house multiple different uh"
"uh software outcomes and that"
"interacting at this control layer"
"is is really powerful and so i want to i"
"want to end by talking about"
"multi-scale organization and artificial"
life
"let's remind ourselves uh of of the of"
"two examples that i started off with"
"the idea that both normal and"
"uh picasso mashed up embryos both end up"
"as normal frogs"
"and that uh that the tails"
"grafted onto the flank will become limbs"
"so this this kind of uh this kind of um"
"anatomical homeostatic process the"
"ability to get to the correct final"
outcome
"even with very very odd starting"
"conditions is"
"uh i think a new model for swarm"
cognition
"and it's important to realize that all"
"cognitive agents are made of parts okay"
"so any agent that you think is"
"intelligent or is performing some kind"
"of function it's going to be made of"
something
"and bodies are just swarms of cells and"
"we need to"
"uh be be very clear that the the the"
"magic here is not just in the molecular"
mechanisms
"but it's in understanding how these"
"collectives these swarms"
"deploy creative problem solving that"
"gets you to the same goal"
"in different circumstances you know if"
"we had swarm robotics that was able to"
"do this"
"we you know we would we would be"
"absolutely calling this a kind of swarm"
intelligence
"and that's and that's what's going on"
"here this is a model for not just"
"uh not not just about medicine but but i"
think
"swarm cognition and for reasons of time"
"i won't go through all of this but just"
"to say if you're interested in that"
"aspect here are three specific papers um"
"you might take a look at where this is"
all
"digested in great detail but we are now"
"really trying to understand"
"how individual cells scale up their"
"computational world from the scale of a"
"single cell"
"all the way up to tissues organs"
organisms
"and so on and so um we have we have a"
"variety of of conceptual ways of doing"
that
"but one of the things that we we think"
"about is this thing called the struggle"
"of the parts and it's actually"
"uh almost 100 years ago a developmental"
"biologist wrote this"
"wrote this paper called the struggle of"
"the parts and it's the idea that"
"the individual and this is the key is"
"you know sort of the main message of the"
"whole talk"
"is that individual components are of of"
"a biological system are themselves"
"goal directed so yes the large organism"
"itself might have behavioral goals"
"but all of the little the organs and the"
"tissues and the cells at every scale"
"there's gold directedness and what it"
"means is this"
"this has massive implications what you"
"what it means is that if uh if you put"
"an eye on the"
"on the tail of a tadpole you don't just"
"get an eye that does nothing"
"it actively tries to carry out the"
"function that it has which is to pass on"
"its visual information"
"to uh the to the the biggest uh set of"
"nerves it can find which in this case is"
"the spinal cord"
"um here what you're seeing on the left"
"is actually a bunch of uh tissues that"
"have been extracted from a planarian"
"these little these little warm looking"
"things they're actually one organ out of"
"a planarian they're the pharynx"
"they're what the animal usually uses to"
"eat and you can see that liberated from"
"the rest of the"
"planarian these guys are are having"
"their own life it doesn't last very long"
"right you need the whole worm to kind of"
"live for long periods of time"
"but they're they're going off on their"
"own and both"
"in this simple behavioral case and in"
this
"morphogenetic case there is uh"
competency
"and goal directedness at every level and"
"this is critical for"
"for two reasons number one is that this"
"is i think what is really responsible"
"for evolvability"
"this multi-scale autonomy greatly"
"smooths the evolutionary landscape"
"it means that if you have some sort of"
"mutation that suddenly"
"uh your eyes end up somewhere other than"
"what they should be you're not"
"automatically dead"
"you in fact will probably do fine"
because
"the eye is really competent at forming"
"anywhere and passing its information"
"up to the brain this means that"
"mutations that otherwise"
"would have wrecked this highly complex"
"system i mean that was darwin's puzzle"
"from the very beginning"
"random mutations how are they going uh"
"ever do anything good for a system"
"that's that complex instead of just"
wrecking
"the competency of the individual parts"
"means that if you have"
"a mutation that changes something all"
"the other stuff around it will do its"
"darndest to still"
"execute their correct outcomes so that"
"the tolerance for"
"change and for mutation becomes massive"
"and it really smooths"
"the evolutionary landscape and makes it"
"much easier to uh to evolve in fact you"
"can start searching"
"a much different evolutionary space if"
"you don't have to worry about the parts"
"if you're"
"if what you're really searching is the"
"space of reconfiguration of large"
"modules um so uh this is"
"this is something that um that we've"
"been we've been working on this"
"evolutionary story"
"of how individual cells become coupled"
"into electrical networks and that allows"
"them to scale"
"their uh their goals in both in time and"
in
"in space to the uh to a much larger"
"um electrically coupled kind of network"
"now the danger of this thing is that"
"sometimes you'll have defections"
"this process if you have one cell that"
"becomes electrically isolated"
"from the rest of the body that cell for"
"all intents and purposes the the the"
"boundary of the self"
"see in this large multi-cellular uh"
system
"the boundary of the between the self and"
"world the information boundary"
"is is is encompasses the whole thing"
"okay because they're all sharing"
"in real time they're all sharing"
"electrical information it's impossible"
"for them to lie to each other they're"
"they're literally sharing their internal"
"contents through the"
"through the gap junctions they in effect"
"become one one"
"uh creature from a computational"
"perspective but if that process breaks"
"down this cell"
"uh now it's it's a radius of itself"
"is now very small because it it is no"
"longer plugged in or connected to this"
"to this network and now all of the"
"signals come from outside"
"through the through the cell membrane"
"and it has a choice it can believe them"
"or disbelieve these these"
"this information it can ignore it and"
"these cells"
"do what unicellular organisms always do"
"they proliferate as much as they can"
"and they go wherever they want and that"
"is metastasis that's cancer and"
metastasis
"so one way to understand cancer is as a"
"breakdown of informational"
"connectivity that normally harnesses"
"individual cells"
"toward large-scale anatomical goals"
"cancer cells are not more selfish than"
"any other cell type"
"they're equally selfish it's just they"
"have smaller cells all of these other"
"cells are just the selfish but they've"
"got a giant self with"
"a body with with very large um"
"anatomical goals that they're working"
towards
"cancer cells have very tiny goals and"
"and they treat the rest of the body as"
"environment and so"
"so you know currently in in our in our"
"machines and our robotics at least oops"
"at least at least most of them what we"
"have is"
"a situation where the whole machine"
"might be intelligent and it might be"
"doing intelligent things but the"
"individual parts"
"are generally pretty dumb they don't you"
"don't really have a scenario where"
"you're worried that some of the parts"
"are going to run off and and do their"
"own thing"
"and in biology this is a constant a"
"constant danger"
"but the upside is the advantages are"
"massive it's it's huge evolvability"
"because of this multi-scale competency"
that
"allows uh allows uh both both"
"evolvability and robustness"
"and so in cancer we've used this and"
"there's just a couple of slides and then"
"i'll stop um in"
"in cancer we've used this the strategy"
"to normalize tumors"
"and we've shown that if you inject uh an"
rna
"oncogene and and it makes these tumors"
"here they're labeled in red"
"all you have to do is provide another"
"a bi-electrical either a channel or gap"
"junctions or or"
"various different ways to artificially"
"force these cells into communication"
"with their neighbors"
"and when you do that there's no tumor"
"even though the oncogene is strongly"
expressed
"because these cells are not irrevocably"
"broken they're not necessarily"
"damaged beyond repair they don't"
"necessarily need to be killed by toxic"
chemotherapy
"they need to be plugged in"
"informationally into the rest of the"
"uh of the communication network that"
"harnesses them towards making normal"
"structures instead of tumors and so just"
"for the last bit i want to show you"
"something that um and this is where this"
is
"done in uh uh close collaboration with"
"uh with with josh bongard's lab and this"
"is the work of"
"doug blackiston and sam kriegman in"
"josh's lab and so"
"we asked this question of how much"
"plasticity do normal cells really have"
"you know we've seen in planaria they"
"seem to have plenty but we wanted to do"
"this in a vertebrate"
"and we wanted to see if their"
"morphological goals were hardwired so"
"what we did"
"was we took a bunch of cells we"
"liberated them from the constraints of a"
"frog embryo"
"and we asked we put them together in"
"this little little depression we didn't"
"change them genetically in any way"
"and we said okay when they reboot their"
"multicellularity what will they form"
"okay and what they form are these"
"amazing multi"
"little machines now there's a couple of"
"interesting things going on here this is"
"this is um"
"sped up a little bit uh what you see"
"here is that they can move around"
"they move in groups they move in in"
singletons
"they they have some interesting"
"behaviors uh this is uh this is some"
"simulations that um"
"that sam and and uh and josh have done"
"to kind of simulate what they're doing"
"in their environment"
"one thing to keep in mind is these are"
"just skin okay"
"there is uh they're just skin cells um"
"they've learned to"
"communicate with each other to make a"
"completely novel little creature it"
"looks nothing like a tadpole"
"it has completely different behaviors uh"
"you can see here that it"
"um as by moving around these particles"
"in its environment it's it's"
"it it makes uh you know it's kind of uh"
"it has it has impact on its environment"
"they can model"
"now uh josh's lab can model these things"
"in silico and we can make"
"different uh different shapes and oops"
"and uh and when we make these when we"
"make these shapes the amazing thing"
"about it"
"is that uh if you were to sequence them"
"you what you would read out is 100"
"xenopus labels all you would see is frog"
"and you'd have no idea"
"that they were capable that these cells"
"were capable of getting together"
"and forming a completely different"
"animal and um"
"uh there we have we have one paper out"
"already and there's there's a couple"
"more on their way that show the amazing"
"uh morphological and behavioral"
"capacities of these things that have"
just
"rebooted their multicellularity to a"
"completely different"
"default structure so the conclusions"
"then are these uh here's what i hope"
"you remember that computational"
capabilities
"infotaxes memory and so on are ancient"
"they are not just for brains"
"uh bacterial biofilms already had most"
"of the tricks that we associate with"
brains
"and that this is an example of basal"
"cognition in fact"
"this is where neurons and brains came"
"from they came from speed optimizing"
"these ancient"
"properties and what evolution does is it"
"exploits the physics of bioelectricity"
"to implement networks"
"that store these patterns these patterns"
"serve as memories"
"and goal states for the cellular"
"collective and during evolution and"
"during embryonic development"
"this expands the cognitive boundary of"
"single cells into much bigger"
"agents that pursue anatomical level"
goals
"and so i think i think there's a couple"
"of implications of all this for the"
future
"uh for robotics and ai we can think"
"about new"
"non-neuromorphic approaches to machine"
"learning so using architectures that are"
"completely different from"
"uh the very sort of derived"
"specialized architecture of the brain"
"for biomedicine we need to exploit"
"the intelligence of cell collectives by"
"using stimuli"
"not genetic rewiring to reset their goal"
"in coatings and we're doing this in in a"
"number of medical contexts"
"and then for synthetic morphology we now"
"have the opportunity"
"to create these multi-scale synthetic"
"living machines"
"and some of them will be useful and"
"they'll do useful things but more"
importantly
"what we can do from them is to learn to"
"program their structure and function"
"by cracking this morphogenetic code by"
"finally understanding"
"where and how large-scale collective"
"goals come from and that's a that's a"
"major puzzle you know how do you"
"how do you discover and then reprogram"
"goals of of complex multi-scale"
collectives
"and i think for the future of uh of"
"artificial life i think these are a"
"great set of models"
"to think about how much how much"
"divergence there can be even in standard"
"uh standard uh cells and and to try to"
understand
"how to combine bottom-up emergence with"
"top-down cognition to implement these"
"robust goal-seeking systems"
"and to really understand the plastic"
"relationship between uh life"
"and mind and so um what i would like to"
"do is uh thank"
"the various people who did the work that"
"i showed you today lots of"
"lots of people um postdoc students"
"technicians and our various"
"collaborators of course our funders"
"the paul island frontiers group and many"
"others and i will just close by showing"
"you what uh two-headed planaria do in"
"their spare time"
"this is it uh the first time i showed"
"this at a conference somebody stood up"
"and said"
"those animals can't exist and so now i"
"bring this video at the end to make sure"
that
"everybody can see uh what they look like"
"and i thank you very much and i'll take"
questions
"you so much mike yes this is fantastic"
"um just a couple of uh logistical points"
about
"q a um for those that don't know uh mike"
"is in the eastern standard time zone so"
"it's dinner time here i would like"
"to be respectful of his time um mike"
"during your talk you've accumulated"
"probably several"
"hours worth of questions so what i prep"
"what i propose we do is um i'll i'll let"
"you field"
"two questions we've also reached the end"
"of our"
"hour so there is the tutorial on"
"molecular mechanisms"
"starting now molecular programming of"
"swarms that's starting in lecture hall"
"a so if you're interested in that"
"tutorial you can leave this lecture hall"
"which is lecture hall b"
"and join lecture hall a everyone else"
"can stay on while mike answers two"
questions
"clearly there are many questions that"
"mike is not going to be able to get"
"to if you typed your question into chat"
"it will be copied and pasted into the"
slack
"and it'll be pasted into the hashtag"
"keynotes channel so if mike doesn't get"
"to your question and mike if we can"
"impose on your time some more you don't"
"have to do that this evening but"
"sometime during the rest of the"
"the conference if you want to dip in"
"there you can you can interact with"
"those that have more questions for you"
"absolutely there will be other keynotes"
"that are dropping in there so if you"
"have a question for mike"
"drop it into hashtag keynotes and"
"address it to"
"at michael space levin"
"okay i believe that hiroki had the first"
question
"so hiroki um you had an involved"
"question so i'll let you answer it so"
"hiroki if you're still here"
"please unmute your microphone ask your"
"question yes okay so"
"thank you very much mike so this is a"
"great talk and my question"
"uh i posted you know that almost 20"
"minutes ago was"
"you know do you have any illustrator"
"cases where"
"this amazing biological adaptivity"
plasticity
"actually fails miserably so"
"we want to hear more about that kind of"
"stuff sure sure yeah yeah"
"oh yeah ab absolutely and uh uh"
"this is this is where um all of these"
"systems have limitations"
"and the limitations are seen clearly in"
"cases of birth defects and they're seen"
"clearly in cancer"
"so it's it's uh so so i'll take the"
"birth defects case uh first"
"so uh depending on the the species and"
"the kind of birth defect that we're"
"talking about"
"there is anywhere between one percent to"
10
"uh of embryos at particular stages that"
"are simply incorrect"
"and there are various ways to break uh"
"the ability of the system to"
"repair back to normal so the way the way"
"this happens is"
"it can be caused by problems in the"
"environment so either chemicals or"
"temperature or various other things in"
"the environment"
"that break the ability of the system to"
"get back to normal"
"it is sometimes caused by other"
"other animals so for example bacteria or"
"other living things so bacteria"
"for example can certain kinds of"
"bacteria can cause planaria to develop"
"uh either two heads or defects of the"
"visual system"
"because they've evolved to plug into the"
"same electrical signals that the animal"
"is normally using they're basically"
"hijacking that system so parasites"
"of various types can hijack that system"
"uh and uh and then of course there are"
"genetic mutations so there are"
"channelopathies there are mutations in"
"ion channels"
"that render the system unable to form"
"the patterns that normally form"
"and those are the things that we try to"
"fix the these are the targets of our"
repair
"so absolutely the system can can be over"
overwhelmed
"and cancer same same deal with cancer so"
"normally the cells are electrically"
"normalizing each other to keep everybody"
"away from cancer"
"but sometimes that fails and that's when"
"that's when you get cancer so"
"um for sure these systems break yeah"
"thank you very much very interesting"
"okay the"
"uh second question and i apologize if i"
"uh mispronounce your name"
"abdalermann mostafa if mr mustafa is"
here
"please unmute yourself and ask your"
question
"if not we will yes"
[Music]
"yeah i'm here all right so thank you for"
"the great lecture this was like"
"incredibly inspiring"
"thank you so yeah my question is what do"
"you think even if it's just"
"guessing these problems however do you"
think
"about the embryological problems"
"congenital problems that involve"
"um not finding a genetic anomaly"
"to do with them so like people do"
genetically
"association studies and they simply"
"don't find patterns"
"but if you think about those can be"
"explained looking at how biology works"
"thank you yeah i didn't i didn't get all"
"of that i think uh the"
"the network wasn't wasn't great for part"
"of that um"
"what i heard was was how does all this"
"relate to the kind of"
"genetic screens that people are doing is"
"that about is that about right"
"i can read the original question very"
"quickly if that helps"
"um so i'll do embryological"
"malformations with recognized genetic"
"errors happen this is really interesting"
"what about malformations for genetic"
"errors idiopathic anomalies"
"i see i see okay um so"
"what what happens is right so so there's"
"a couple of different different ways i"
"mean the easiest way to think about this"
is
"uh if if you if you if you uh"
"wreck your hardware to a sufficient"
"degree then no matter how good your"
"software you're not"
"going to be able to carry out certain"
"functions so there are mutations in the"
"genome if you need a particular enzyme"
"to turn one chemical into another"
"chemical and you've had a mutation"
"in that enzyme and it doesn't work"
"there's nothing that bioelectric"
"signaling is going to be able to do"
"there are tons of these kinds of"
mutations
"there are other mutations in ion"
"channels which"
"themselves set up incorrect bioelectric"
"patterns and then you get defects"
"there are yet other mutations that we"
"can fix so for example we've shown that"
"there's a gene called notch which is a"
"very important gene for brain"
development
"we take embryos that have a terrible"
"mutation in that gene"
"we by forcing the appropriate"
"bioelectric state"
"they will still have pretty normal brain"
"so you can often intervene despite the"
"fact that you have some of these"
"and it just depends on what case you're"
"it just depends on what case you're"
"talking about you know and what kind of"
"damage it was that that you've had"
"okay i think we're doing pretty well"
"here so if we can impose on your time a"
"little bit more mike maybe we'll allow"
"one last question"
"um bartlett if you wanted to ask your"
question
"uh hi uh thank you very much professor"
"levin it's absolutely a phenomenal talk"
"i really enjoyed it and"
"i wanted to ask about whether we need to"
"well almost certainly we need to modify"
"our definition of"
"set points because that there are"
clearly
"either attractors or goals that these"
"systems are heading towards"
"but as you showed they're so plastic and"
"they're so dynamic and there's a lot of"
"there's a lot of switching and decision"
"making um"
"involved in the definition of those set"
"points and i just wondered whether you"
think
"we need to somehow change our definition"
"or or"
"or whether it should be sort of merged"
"into a more general"
"um conception of of biological learning"
"um yeah so so there are lots of"
"potential subtleties the there's there's"
"an incredible amount of"
"room now for development and for new"
"work and there are lots of subtleties"
"that i completely glossed over for two"
reasons
"i mean there's there's allostasis which"
"is distinct from homeostasis there's a"
"million different"
"people who work on this stuff uh really"
"um you know in cybernetics and"
"and computer science and so on uh who"
may
"say this is this is an incredibly um uh"
"kind of"
"kind of that that that one loop i drew"
"for you is very simplistic"
"and it is and the reason the reason is"
"twofold first just for lack of"
"time you know we could have a we could"
"have a whole deep discussion about it"
"but the"
"the bigger reason is that that whole"
"notion in itself"
"of a set point that is an anatomical"
"state and this idea that"
"the embryo is actually trying to get to"
"a particular"
"outcome is basically um"
"uh a forbidden territory in molecular"
"and cell biology right"
"so so so biology has been has been"
running
"headlong away from anything that sounds"
"like teleology for"
"for many years and people are really"
"uncomfortable with with that idea"
"now i point out for those audiences i"
"point out that"
"okay people in control theory"
"engineering you know cybernetics"
"have already had a non-magical theory of"
"goal directedness for decades so i don't"
"think we have to you know worry about it"
"all that much but it's still a really um"
"controversial concept in in with my"
colleagues
"and so for this reason at that point i'm"
"just showing you the very basic"
"simple i'm trying to demonstrate a"
"really simple fact that these goal"
"states exist"
"and that we can see them and we can"
"rewrite them and having done that i"
"would love to have"
"more in-depth conversations with people"
"who um who actually work on this stuff"
"to nail down some very specific models"
"of what"
"what this really is and goal goal the"
"determination of those goals and the"
representation
"of those patterns distributed along cell"
"networks i mean these are all things we"
"should be"
"discussing excellent thank you"
"thanks okay i think um this is a good"
"place to pause"
"um i will invite everyone in the"
"audience to move the party to"
"hashtag keynotes and mike you're welcome"
to
"to carry on over there and continue"
"answering questions now or join us again"
"tomorrow and later in the conference and"
"and keep the conversation going"
"cool thanks so much again thank you"
"again mike and uh just a reminder"
"um that we are starting up again"
"tomorrow morning and at 9 00 a.m eastern"
"time we have our second keynote speaker"
"uh sarah and mari walker from arizona"
"state university so"
"thanks all for a great first day thank"
"you mike and we'll see you all tomorrow"
"thank you everybody"
