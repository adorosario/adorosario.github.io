okay
hello
"good evening all welcome back"
"today last"
"Talk of the conference"
"Professor Michael Levin is people"
"and he is a process of biology"
"University of God you're saying"
"and he also holds one year"
"he's also the director of"
"and also the work of discoveries"
"he's a co-founder of uh and principal"
"investigator of the institution of"
"Institute for computationally Define"
organisms
"from 2020 onwards"
"and he is also a senior research"
investigator
"forces Institute"
"Harvard update Department of laboratory"
"genetics Cambridge"
"from 2018"
"he is uh"
"going to delivering virtual titles as"
"diverse intelligence"
"understanding and relating to"
"unconventional biological engineering"
"and hybrid agents so uh texting the warm"
"welcome to Professor Michael on behalf"
"of the Departments"
"organizing team and thank you Professor"
"living for accepting our invitation of"
"delivering this vector"
"oh to you"
"thank you so much and um I appreciate"
"the opportunity to share some thoughts"
"with you um I will do my best it's 5 a.m"
"here this morning I will uh I will try"
"to be a coherent"
"um if anybody is interested in the"
"details of the things I will talk about"
"today uh you can find me and uh all of"
"the primary papers the data sets the"
"software everything is here at this at"
"this website"
"so please please do get in touch if"
"you're interested in any of this"
um
"the traditional picture is is shown here"
"this is a a famous painting of um Adam"
"naming the animals and it's this this"
"old idea which is really prevalent in a"
"lot of thinking today even among"
"scientists that there are humans in"
"human kind of minds and then there are"
"many other many other creatures and that"
"these are distinct uh discrete natural"
"kinds they're just uh they're just uh"
"sharply different from each other and"
"humans have all sorts of cognitive"
"capacities and a few uh try to look for"
"these capacities elsewhere in the"
"natural world this is often called"
anthropomorphism
"and so some sort of inappropriate"
"attribution of this of these magical"
"qualities uh outside of the human"
"organism but if we take developmental"
"biology and evolution seriously we"
"realize that uh so that that both on"
"long um file a genetic time scales as"
"well as developmental time scales uh we"
"all share a continuity of uh much much"
"different kinds of beings and so so so"
"uh this is this is really a slow a slow"
"Continuum and any sort of uh special"
"properties that we have you have to ask"
"where did these properties come from"
"and uh to what extent uh did they exist"
"in our various ancestors and when did"
"they begin or end if you think that"
"these are uh but discrete categories and"
"and so on but it's actually even much"
"worse than that which is that now"
"because we now have the ability to"
"replace uh components of a living system"
"at all scales so at the cellular scale"
"tissue organism and so on we can replace"
"uh biologically evolved components with"
"all kinds of chimeric engineered"
"materials so whether this be a Nano Nano"
"materials or uh edited DNA or various"
"inorganic components we can we can make"
"very novel organisms and so uh laterally"
"you can see that there's a potential"
"chain of beings which are and"
"increasingly will be uh realized where"
"not only through through biological"
"changes but also technological"
"hybridization there are a very wide"
"range of different types of creatures"
"and then once again you have to ask what"
"kind of Minds do they have so um I have"
"this this framework that I've been"
"working on it's called tame t-a-m-e"
"stands for technological approach to"
"mind everywhere and the idea is simply"
"this we need to be able to"
"create and relate to truly diverse"
"intelligences regardless of what they're"
"made of or how they got here and so that"
"means that we would like this a single"
"framework on which we can compare and uh"
"and understand uh the kinds of cognitive"
"systems that exist in familiar creatures"
"so we so so humans primates"
"um but you know Birds octopus these"
"kinds of things but also really unusual"
"creatures Colonial organisms swarms and"
"in in synthetic biology so new"
"engineered life forms software"
"artificial intelligences and maybe"
"someday exobiological agents realizing"
"that the Earth the all of the examples"
"on Earth are just an N of one and we"
"really have to we really have to"
"understand broader than that now"
"a number of people have have tried for"
"such a thing and so so this was a very"
"nice Beginning by rosenbluth Weiner and"
"Bigelow who created this kind of uh"
"scale that that shows you through some"
"examples of great transitions all the"
"way from passive behaviors all the way"
"up to what we would call human level"
"cognition with them you know a second"
"order of metacognitive kinds of"
"processes and so on and and what's"
"interesting about the scale it's very"
"cybernetic it's uh doesn't say anything"
"about neurons or brains or uh or or"
"really embodiments what it what it talks"
"about is is uh functionality and ways in"
"in of processing information and that"
"makes it compatible with all of these"
"things and I think that's a that's a"
"that's an that's the right approach so"
"what what I'm interested in is uh"
"developing a framework like this that"
"really uh is uh it picks out what are"
"the symmetries what are the invariants"
"among all of these different kinds of"
"agents to uh to give us new capabilities"
"in the laboratory and to move"
"experimental work forward now uh this is"
"uh this is a nice quote from Cyril which"
"says that uh that we have to allow"
"ourselves to really um examine things"
"that that are generally taken for"
"granted and this is the most common one"
"this is a really magical process in uh"
"develop in in in science it's it's"
"developmental biology all of us uh take"
"this amazing journey across through the"
"Cartesian cut we start as just physics"
"so this is an oocyte and this is a um a"
"crescent egg cell prior to fertilization"
"it's a sort of a blob of a blob of"
"chemicals and uh you know you would look"
"at it then you would say that uh it's"
"it's basically just physics there's not"
"there's not a any or not much cognition"
"going on there but eventually we become"
"one of these organisms and maybe"
"something like this this this human"
"organism that will make statements about"
"um being a unique and uh and and having"
"a a kind of uh inner perspective and so"
"on and the important thing to realize is"
"that this process is extremely slow and"
"gradual so step-by-step developmental"
"biology offers no sharp line at which uh"
"boom prior to that it was just chemistry"
"and physics but now now you're a"
"cognitive being there are no sharp lines"
"in developmental biology so everything"
is
"continuous and somehow this process"
"results in mind emerging from matter and"
"so this is this is maybe one of the most"
"interesting questions that that that"
"exist and there have been a variety of"
"ways to think about this in particular"
"there's this idea of uh collective"
"intelligence and so people will"
"sometimes say well ants and colonies of"
"of bees and birds and things like that"
"are um perhaps a a collective"
"intelligence but but we we are a unified"
"intelligence we're not like a swarm of"
"of events we are a collective"
"intelligence so like we have we have a"
"we have a brain and it's centralized and"
"and Descartes wanted to find a a center"
"in the brain um that um was uh was was"
"was specifically uh specifically uh"
"connected to this unified experience"
"that we had but of course uh we are also"
"made of parts and in fact all"
"intelligence is collective intelligence"
"so let's see so so so here we are here's"
"the brain and of course uh the brain is"
"also made of Parts it's made of cells"
"these neurons inside of each cell is an"
"incredible number of things uh that uh"
"that are that are all operating under"
"various rules to give rise to the the"
"collective behavior and so the the real"
"trick to all of this is to understand"
"the scaling to understand how the uh"
"physics and computation of lower level"
"components gives rise to a cognition"
"that appears to be unified so so we are"
"also Collective intelligences and so and"
"so how does collective intelligence work"
"Let's uh let's just take a look at what"
"what our pieces are so this is a this is"
"a cell uh this happens to be a free"
"living organism but all of us were once"
"free living organisms this is uh lacrum"
"area so there's no brain there's no"
"nervous system uh there's no uh cell to"
"cell communication there are no stem"
"cells this is just a single cell doing"
"everything it needs on its own so you"
"can see it's handling its physiological"
"it's metabolic it's behavioral goals at"
"the level of a single cell"
"um look at the the the ability to uh"
"it's it's feeding it's eating the"
"bacteria and other things in its"
"environment uh this is you know the Envy"
"of it's often but as often Soft Robotics"
"and other kinds of engineering we have"
"nothing that's of this level of"
"sophistication so each one of our cells"
"was an independent organism"
"and uh this this makes it really"
"important to understand how these"
"capacities these competencies of uh of"
"our subunits add up together to give us"
"what feels like a unified cognitive"
"experience now"
"um one very interesting thing is that so"
"Alan Turing needs no introduction of"
"course was"
"really interested in intelligence in uh"
"different embodiments for intelligence"
"in computation these very fundamental"
things
"um that he wanted to understand uh the"
"mind and it's in its most General case"
"um but uh one other thing that he he did"
"which uh some some people that are not"
"aware of is that he was also interested"
"in developmental biology he he wrote a"
"very um uh very early paper on uh"
"morphogenesis the appearance of order"
"the spontaneous generation of order in"
"chemical in in chemical systems and so"
"you might wonder uh why somebody who was"
"interested in intelligence would also be"
"interested in uh in morphogenesis in"
"chemical models of Developmental biology"
"and I think Turing although to my"
"knowledge he didn't write much about"
"this I think that he saw quite clearly"
"being the the genius that he was I think"
"he saw quite clearly that these are"
"fundamentally the same problem I think"
"in a very deep way this is true I think"
"uh the The Secret of Developmental"
"biology and morphogenesis is uh really"
"uh if we understood it properly would"
"would uh would really open up uh all of"
"the Mysteries that we're interested in"
"for um for cognition I think I think it"
"is the same problem so today what what"
"I'd like to tell you today is this um"
"first of all I would like to tell you"
"that biology uses this kind of"
"multi-scale Competency architecture I'll"
"show you what that is of nested problem"
"solvers in diverse problem spaces and"
"navigating these problem spaces uh is a"
"central concept and I think it's a"
"concept that binds together diverse"
"fields from engineering and autonomous"
"of autonomous vehicles all the way"
"through to cognitive science and"
"developmental biology and biomedicine I"
"use the notion of goal directedness and"
"I will Define that shortly"
"as a kind of invariant to recognize"
"create and control or communicate with"
"agents in unconventional embodiments and"
"I'm going to show you this this"
"cognitive boundary model for the scaling"
"of cognition I'm going to spend some"
"time talking about a specific example I"
"want to take apart and in detail a"
"specific example of an unconventional"
"intelligence and how do we work with"
"something like this I'm going to talk"
"about the collective intelligence of"
"morphogenesis of cells groups of cells"
"navigating anatomical space I'm going to"
"show you that bioelectric networks are a"
"kind of protocognitive medium which is"
"also the ancestor of of brain function"
"and this has this has huge impact on on"
"biomedicine that I think is going to"
"allow us to do something very different"
"than today's molecular medicine"
"approaches and I'm going to close with"
"uh pointing out again that synthetic"
"bioengineering is giving us a an"
"enormously large option space of new"
"bodies and new minds which are going to"
"exist and some of them already do these"
"have no standard evolutionary"
"backstories and this has many"
"implications for not only understanding"
"Evolution and biomedicine but also AI"
"Robotics and ethics very importantly so"
"in my um in my uh framework one of the"
"things we focus on this is a very"
"engineering based approach because I"
"want to be close to experiments I want"
"all of these philosophical ideas to be"
"testable empirically I want them to"
"generate new work and so this is this is"
"an engineering approach and the"
"engineering approach is simply this that"
"uh we can place all these all these"
"diverse beings on a Continuum that"
"exists with respect to persuadability"
"meaning what technology or approaches or"
"techniques or strategies would you use"
"to control the system right right so"
"that's that's the engineering approach"
"and so you can see immediately that all"
"kinds of diverse systems land on this on"
"this spectrum so you can have very"
simple
"um mechanical systems like like a like a"
"mechanical clock that are sort of on the"
"left of that Continuum and the thing is"
"that if you wanted to control this"
"system uh you will not uh program it you"
"will not convince it of anything all you"
"can do is modify the hardware okay and"
"then you have more interesting systems"
"like like homeostatic systems where uh"
"actually you don't need to rewire the"
"hardware but you can reset the set point"
"and then this thing will will have"
"different behaviors and then you can"
"move from that to systems whether living"
"or non-living that are able to learn and"
"you can train them with the rewards and"
"punishments and various behavioral"
"paradigms and then eventually you get"
"the systems that you don't even need to"
"reward and punish directly you can"
"communicate with uh with with reasoning"
"and and perhaps get them to do things"
"and so you can see as as we move from"
"from this idea that that here's hard the"
"here's modification at the level of"
"Hardware to eventually you get to"
"something that that's sure it's Hardware"
"but but really the most efficient way of"
"dealing with it is basically through"
"some something that in in the in human"
"terms looks like Psychotherapy which is"
"just very very high level uh"
"communication to try and try and control"
"what happens okay so the first thing I'm"
"going to do here for the next few"
"minutes is try to show you some unusual"
"biology uh to"
"um really reinforce this idea that that"
"that everything lives on a Continuum and"
"that we have to understand how agents"
"change along that along that Continuum"
"so the first thing I want to uh talk"
"about is is this so so here is a is a"
"creature this is a caterpillar uh"
"caterpillars live in a two-dimensional"
"world of surfaces they crawl on uh on"
"these these flat structures then they"
"eat uh they they eat the leaves and they"
"have a particular brain that's a highly"
"specialized for doing that"
"but they need to turn into this this"
"kind of creature which is completely"
"different this this one lives in a"
"three-dimensional World it doesn't care"
"about the leaves at all it drinks nectar"
"and it has a different life and it has a"
"different brain that's uh well well"
"suited for its uh for for its"
"environment now the way you get from"
"here to there is through a process of"
"metamorphosis and during this process"
"this guy basically dissolves its brain"
"so so most of the connections are broken"
"many of the cells die the brain is then"
"reassembled from this state to this"
"state and two two interesting things uh"
"from from from this this process the"
"first is that you know in in philosophy"
"101 you might be challenged to ask"
"what's it like to be a butterfly or"
"what's it like to be a caterpillar well"
"this is uh the next uh sort of meta"
"question which is"
"what's it like to be a caterpillar"
"slowly changing into a butterfly right"
"so this is a this is a radical change of"
"your embodiment of your existence in the"
"physical world that occurs during your"
"lifetime not during evolutionary time"
"scales but literally during your your uh"
"your lifetime so"
"um so that's that's kind of an"
"interesting question what happens to you"
"uh but now the other important point"
"because you might be tempted to say well"
"you disappear and then there's a new"
"creature so basically there is no"
"transition but actually that's that's"
"not the case because"
"um under the most common uh Criterion"
"for personal identity which is memories"
"to to uh retaining your personal"
"memories it turns out that memories are"
"retained through this process so there's"
"there's pretty good evidence that that"
"uh caterpillars that learn something"
"that are trained uh the The Moth or"
"butterfly remembers the original"
"information so to some extent and this"
"is this raises interesting philosophical"
"puzzles so to some extent it is in fact"
"the same organism in a new body so this"
"is this is a an interesting and kind of"
"rebirth but but of the same organism in"
"the new body"
"now this is even in these animals this"
"is even uh this is even even more more"
"apparent these are plenario these are"
"flatworms which I'll talk about more in"
"the rest of the talk but the key feature"
"of planarians is that they regenerate so"
"if you cut them into pieces every piece"
"will give rise to a new worm and they"
"have a brain up here a true centralized"
"brain uh with uh the same"
"neurotransmitters that you and I have"
"and uh you can cut off the head and they"
"will regenerate but the amazing thing"
"and this was discovered in uh by James"
"McConnell and and we um replicated his"
"work using the modern Automation in"
"2013. what he discovered is if you train"
"this animal uh then you cut off the"
"hidden the tail sits there doing nothing"
"for about a week they eventually regrows"
"a new brain and when it regrows a new"
"head and brain you can show that they"
"remember the original information and so"
"so they learn they learn that food is to"
"be found on these on these little um"
"these little laser etched discs now"
"this allows you to to to perform an"
"experiment again from from philosophy of"
"mine which is called the malfunction"
"malfunctioning transporter so the idea"
"that you know let's say let's say"
"there's a transporter that somehow"
"transports you from here to there but"
"it's broken down and so once it's"
"transported you it it fails to remove"
"the original copy so now there's two of"
"you and so so which one is the original"
"um is the original person so so in the"
"planarian you can actually do that we"
"can cut in them into pieces and now you"
"have multiple individuals that are"
"basically copies of the original as far"
"as the content of their of their brains"
"are concerned so you can see this this"
"amazing plasticity that uh where where"
"the the ability to to change the body in"
"this case to regrow ahead or to"
"metamorphos and and rebuild a brain is"
"is deeply connected with the um"
"cognitive content of of that of that"
"creature's mind"
"and and this this plasticity of"
"plasticity of the body extends to"
"vertebrates so here is a tadpole of a"
"frog so here are the nostrils the mouth"
"um the brain the gut here and this is"
"the tail back here and so what you'll"
"notice what we've done here is we've"
"created a a tadpole in which the prime"
"the eyes are missing so there's no eyes"
"up here but we did create an eye on its"
"tail and I'll talk later about how we do"
"that but these animals when you create"
"this eye without uh long periods of"
"evolutionary adaptation they can see"
"they can see out of this eye and we know"
"that because this device that we've"
"built and it's the same device that we"
"use to uh train to test to train and"
"test the the planarian during their"
"behavior studies we can show that that"
"these these animals can be trained on"
"visual tasks"
um
"and to stay away from particular moving"
"lights and things like that so so this"
"is uh this is this is amazing because"
"the brain dynamically adjusts its"
"behavioral programs to accommodate a"
"completely different body architecture"
"so uh and this has this has many uh many"
"implications for evolution that that we"
"can talk about later if people want to"
"but but that that plasticity of you know"
"how is it that cells I precursor cells"
"uh implanted onto the tail not only make"
"a perfectly normal eye even though"
"they're in a weird environment with"
"muscle next to them and so on they make"
"a perfectly normal eye but they figure"
"out how to connect and they don't"
"connect to the brain they connect here"
"to the spinal cord for example and that"
"information is is able to be picked up"
"by the brain so so so that um that"
"competency of the parts is"
"um uh is really quite quite quite"
"remarkable and so what this gets us to"
"is is is this uh that"
"biological organisms are not merely"
"um nested dolls structurally so we all"
"know you know we're made of organs of"
"tissues cells molecules not just not not"
"just structurally but uh functionally"
"each of these independent layers is uh"
"is is solving problems it's a it's an"
"independent it's it's it's independently"
"competent in solving various problems"
"and uh and this is happening"
"simultaneously at all scales of"
"organization now what are these problems"
"that it's solving well we're pretty used"
"to uh"
"recognizing intelligent uh activity in"
"the in the three in three-dimensional"
"space so our cognitive and uh sensory"
"structures are prime to uh look for"
"medium-sized objects moving at medium"
"speeds through three-dimensional space"
"and doing clever things like like this"
"Crow that's learned to pick up cigarette"
"butts to receive a reward"
"um but imagine if we had uh the innate"
"sense of uh really feeling every uh all"
"the all the parameters of your blood"
"chemistry for example if we had an in"
"innate feeling of that much like we see"
"uh the outside world I think we would"
"have no problem recognizing for example"
"that our liver our kidneys are various"
"organs are uh performing very"
"interesting uh uh intelligent behaviors"
"in adjusting to all these Circa to all"
"these novel circumstances in"
"physiological space so there are there"
"are numerous other problem spaces that"
"we're simply not uh not used to uh but"
"but these these spaces are ones in which"
"uh intelligence can be manifest in"
"exactly the same way that it can be"
"manifest in three-dimensional space we"
"just have to learn to think about these"
"so so what are these spaces so there are"
"spaces of physiological uh physiological"
"parameters there are spaces of a"
"transcriptional meaning gene expression"
"right so a separate dimension for every"
"Gene and then you have this huge"
dimensional
"um a huge dimensional manifold in which"
"in which every cell is is navigating as"
"it changes its its transcriptional"
"states and we have this which is sort of"
"my favorite and what I'll spend the most"
"time I'm talking about which is"
"anatomical morphe space the the the"
"space of all possible shapes for example"
"the possible the parameter space that"
"defines different shapes of planarian"
"heads so before we launch into"
"um into amorphous space I want to give"
"you one example of transcriptional and"
"physiological space that we discovered a"
"couple years ago so here's a here's our"
"planarian and what we've done is we we"
"take this we take this flatworm and we"
"put it into a solution of barium barium"
"chloride barium is a is an interesting"
"chemical barium blocks all of the"
"potassium channels when you block all"
"the potassium channels cells which rely"
"on potassium flux to manage their"
"physiology become extremely unhappy in"
"fact the the planarian head has so many"
"uh neurons that require this the whole"
"head explodes literally they just over"
"overnight they that they had explodes"
"they lose their head but the amazing"
"thing is that if you keep them in barium"
"what they will do over uh over the next"
"week or two is they will grow a new head"
"and the new head is is completely"
"adapted to Barium has no problem with"
"bearing whatsoever they're fine and so"
"we asked a very simple question uh how"
"is that possible how what is this what"
"is this head doing that's different from"
"the original"
"allows it to maintain"
um
"there's a lot of noise from somebody"
"yep there we go thank you"
"um so uh we what we did was we uh"
"compared the transcriptomes so we just"
"looked at all of the genes that are"
"expressed in these in these normal heads"
"versus the ones that are expressed here"
"and we ask what's different so what's"
"what's transcriptionally different about"
"these uh"
"about these animals and what we find is"
"it's really a very small number of genes"
"that were turned on to allow them to"
"adapt to Barium now here's the amazing"
"thing planarian never encountered barium"
"in nature so there there has never been"
"evolutionary pressure for being able to"
"deal with with barium exposure and for"
"knowing what to do when you're in barium"
"how did these cells know exactly which"
"genes to turn on to deal with this new"
"physiological stressor so you can sort"
"of imagine this problem it's because"
"because the I don't know 20 000 genes or"
"however many there are you can imagine"
"it's like you're in a a nuclear reactor"
"control room it's it's melting down"
"there's a big problem uh how do you know"
"what to do and in fact you can't there's"
"no time to just start flipping genes"
"randomly on and off there's no time for"
that
"um the cells don't don't turn over like"
"bacteria so there's no time for uh some"
"kind of um uh you know random change"
"where everything dies in The One"
"successful cell repopulates the head and"
"so uh there's this real real problem of"
"understanding how do these cells"
"navigate to the correct region of"
"transcriptional space they have to you"
"have to take this walk from from from"
"this state to to to this state and it's"
"and it's not known how they do that so"
"that's an example of problem solving uh"
"in in physiological space what I'd like"
"to do next is to really focus on"
"morphogenesis and and problem solving an"
"anatomical space as a kind of collective"
intelligence
"and so so let's talk about this for for"
"a few minutes uh we all start life like"
"this as a as a ball of embryonic"
"blastomeres so um this is uh this is"
"kind of an early and early stage in"
"these cells eventually build something"
"like this this is a cross section"
"through the human torso and you can see"
"the amazing order here the structure"
"every every organ and tissue is in the"
"right place the right size the right"
"position relative to each other"
"where is this structure specified where"
"is this order specified now people often"
"will want to say well it's in the DNA"
"but we can read genomes now and none of"
"this is directly in the DNA what the DNA"
"specifies is that micro level Hardware"
"of each cell so the proteins that every"
"cell gets to have but it's the"
"physiology and the um and the dynamic"
"behavior of these cells that then gives"
"rise to the right number of fingers eyes"
"and and everything else so we have to"
"understand how do cells groups of cells"
"know what to make and when to stop as"
"workers in regenerative medicine we"
"would like to know well if a piece of"
"this is missing"
"how do we get these cells to rebuild"
"again and as Engineers we would like to"
"ask a further question which is well"
"that's fine to regenerate this but"
"actually what else can we make so so can"
"we can we ask these cells to build"
"something completely different I'll show"
"you that towards the end of the talk"
so
"um well I like to think about uh the the"
"end game of this of this field"
"specifically of regenerative medicine"
"with a concept of of an anatomical"
"compiler an anatomical compiler is a is"
"a future is a is an aspirational future"
"system where what you should be able to"
"do is sit down in front of a computer"
"and draw the animal or plant that you"
want
"um it could be anything it could be it"
"could be a typical one it could be some"
"sort of hybrid it could be anything you"
"like and if we knew what we were doing"
"and we understood we had a mature"
"science of morphogenesis what the system"
"would be able to do is output a set of"
"stimuli that you could give to a group"
"of cells and they would build exactly"
"what you asked for right so so an"
"anatomical compiler now now notice that"
"then I'm going to argue that an"
"anatomical compiler is not a 3D printer"
"you are not micromanaging the positions"
"of individual cells and trying to print"
"it what what it really is deeply is a"
"communication device it's a translator"
"from from from your uh desired"
"three-dimensional shape to the signals"
"that need to be given by the cellular"
"Collective to cause that Collective to"
"build it in exactly the same way that it"
"normally builds something else"
"and so now why do we need this well we"
"need it because because uh most problems"
"of biomedicine with the exception of"
"infectious disease most problems of"
"biomedicine boil down to uh the control"
"of shape so birth defects traumatic"
"injury cancer aging all of this would be"
"solved if we knew how to convince a"
"group of cells to do what we want them"
"to do okay so now now we have molecular"
"biology and genetics so so isn't that"
"isn't that enough how you know what else"
"do we need well here's a very simple"
"example um this is an axolotl larva so"
"these are salamanders and baby axolotls"
"have little little eggs this is a"
"tadpole of a frog frog tackles do not"
"have legs and in our lab we can do"
"something like make a chimera called a"
"frogalotel so we can mix the early cells"
"we can make a chimeric embryo called the"
"frogalital now I ask a simple question"
"well will the Frog aottle have legs or"
"not we have both genomes you have the"
"Axolotl genome you have the Frog genome"
"can you tell me if the frogalital is"
"going to have legs and the answer is no"
"we have we have absolutely no uh"
"Frameworks currently to uh to be able to"
"to to determine this this kind of"
"anatomical information even though you"
"have the full genetics for both animals"
"and so where we are now"
"is this we're very good molecular"
"biology and Medicine are very good at"
"manipulating Pathways so cells and"
"molecules but we're really quite a long"
"way to uh from from controlling Form and"
"Function which is what what we want and"
"my argument is that uh in in biomedicine"
"we are basically where computer science"
"was in the 40s and 50s that it was still"
"basically stuck at the hardware level"
"everything is about Pathways and"
"molecules and genome editing and that"
"this is all at the level of Hardware but"
"we really have an opportunity which is"
"to exploit something remarkable that"
"exists in in biology and and also in"
"some computer systems which is"
"um higher level information processing"
"and in biology we call this agency and"
"so I want to uh give a definition of"
"what I'm talking about that and I like"
"this William James's definition which is"
"uh for intelligence is the ability to"
"reach the same goal by different means"
"um somebody else put it and I wish I"
"could remember who said this somebody"
"else said that uh it's it's the it's the"
"con it's the Continuum of different"
"capacity cities that that make the"
"difference between two magnets trying to"
"get together and Romeo and Juliet trying"
"to get together it's the degree of"
"sophistication you can expect from a"
"system in meeting uh meeting a specific"
"goal which looks like maybe energy"
"minimization in very simple systems and"
"and it looks uh somewhat different in"
"complex systems so so how does"
"intelligence work out in uh in in"
"morphogenesis well here's a simple"
"example so okay so so we know that"
"development is extremely reliable so so"
"almost all of the time an embryo will"
"give rise to a proper uh proper proper"
"human body but actually"
"um it's reliable but it's uh it's robust"
"it's not hardwired so if we take an"
"early embryo and we cut it in half you"
"don't get two half bodies you get two"
"perfectly normal monozygotic Twins and"
"and development in general has this"
"ability to reach the same uh goal"
"meaning the same the same state in"
"anatomical amorphous space from"
"different starting positions and despite"
"various perturbations like these local"
"Maxima that um where where where"
"hardwired systems would simply get stuck"
"the way two magnets trying to get"
"together would just be forever stuck if"
"you put a barrier in their place they're"
"never gonna walk around it they're just"
"gonna um uh try to try to get together"
"in the direct path development isn't"
"like that and um regeneration isn't like"
"that either so so here's a salamander"
"um this this guy that's called the"
"Axolotl and these guys will regenerate"
"their legs their eyes their jaws various"
"internal organs so if you amputate uh"
"for example anywhere along this uh the"
"slim they will grow exactly what's"
"needed and then they will stop the"
"stopping is the is the most amazing part"
"um when do they stop they stop when the"
"correct large-scale Anatomy is complete"
"so the system as a whole knows exactly"
"what a settlement what a normal"
"salamander looks like uh and and"
"anywhere you cut it'll grow just the"
"right amount and it'll stop at the right"
"time so this is an example of anatomical"
"homeostasis or the the ability to return"
"back to that region of anatomical"
"amorphous space when it's been perturbed"
"away from it I should say that this is"
"not just some weird"
"capacity of lower organisms human human"
"livers are highly regenerative human"
"children will regrow their fingertips"
"and deer regrow large amounts of bone"
"innervation vasculature and so on every"
"year so so there's all kinds of"
"capacities for that regeneration but one"
"of the one of the most amazing and one"
"of my favorite examples is is this and"
"this was this was discovered back in the"
"1940s this is a cross section through a"
"um a kidney tubule in a in a newt and"
"what you see is that there's eight or"
"ten cells that cooperate together to"
"build this kind of uh this kind of"
"tubular structure now one thing you can"
"do is you can you can force these cells"
"to be much larger and when you do that"
"uh when the cells get larger the nude"
"stays the same they're the same size so"
"so it has a regular regulatory"
"regulative ability and remarkably then"
"uh just a fewer number of cells are"
"being used but they make the same"
"structure and the most amazing thing"
"happens when you make these cells so"
"enormous that uh what it does is one"
"cell will bend around itself to uh to"
"form a uh to form the exact same"
"structure now what's remarkable about"
"this is that this is a completely"
"different molecular mechanism this is"
"cell to cell communication and"
"tubulogenesis this is cytoskeletal"
"bending so what you have here is a nice"
"example of top-down causation in the"
"service of a large-scale anatomical goal"
"making a proper tubule of the right"
"shape and size different molecular"
"mechanisms will get called up in this"
"case cytoskeleton bending in this case"
"cell to cell cell to cell interactions"
"different molecular mechanisms get"
"called up to uh to to serve this this"
"high level anatomical goal and so we can"
"see this this kind of a multi-scale so"
"so this is of course very very much what"
"cognitive architectures do right you"
"have you have a high level um high-level"
"executive function of some sort and that"
"that eventually feeds down to"
"physiological processes and and making"
"um your muscles move and so on and and"
"uh this is this is an another really"
"nice example which we discovered a few"
"years ago which is which is this that um"
"these again this is a tadpole so the"
"eyes the brain and so on these tapples"
"need to become frogs and in order to"
"become frogs they have to rearrange"
"their face so the Jaws have to move the"
"eyes have to move everything has to move"
around
"and it was thought that this was a"
"hardwired process meaning meaning uh"
"every organ just moved in the right"
"direction the right amount and then you"
"go from a normal tadpole to a normal"
"frog so we decided to test the idea that"
"um that this process was had very low"
"intelligence and basically just was a"
"was a hardwired set of movements so what"
"we did was we scrambled all of the"
"initial starting positions so we made"
"this these these Picasa what we call"
"these Picasso tadpoles where all the"
"organs are in the wrong place and what"
"happens is that actually they still make"
"pretty normal frogs everything moves"
"around in novel paths sometimes they go"
"too far and they actually have to come"
"back but everything moves around until"
"they get to their normal position and"
"then they stop so this is very"
"interesting the system is not just a set"
"of hardwired movements it can actually"
"do the same it can reach the same goal"
"despite this this this perturbation"
"and what the genetics gives you is is"
"not a a hardwired machine but it gives"
"you is an an error minimization scheme"
"it gives you a system that executes a"
"very flexible program that can start off"
"in different starting positions and"
"still get to where it needs to go"
"through novel actions that are not"
"normally taken through development so so"
"this kind of this kind of navigation of"
"morphos space with different"
"um competencies is is exactly what we're"
"looking for as a as an invariant"
"across a really really diverse"
"problem-solving systems so we"
"um we started to think about this this"
"process as this kind of homeostatic Loop"
"like a simple homeostat on that on that"
"initial scale that I that I showed you"
"from a wiener and um and colleagues so"
"the idea is that this this here is the"
"typical developmental uh story that uh"
"that that you get in textbooks where you"
"have Gene regulatory networks"
"um the the genes turning each other on"
"and off and you get some proteins that"
"interact according to the laws of"
"physics so this is a kind of a complex"
"complex dynamical system and then"
"through the magical process of emergence"
"you get a complex outcome you get you"
"get something like this and and that's"
"true all of that does it does happen but"
"the more amazing part of it is that"
"actually this is not a purely feed"
"forward emergent process what you"
"actually have is a set of control loops"
"that will be activated if you deviate"
"from this target state so so that means"
"injury mutation teratogenesis whatever"
"if you a cancer if you deviate from the"
"state then both at the at the level of"
"transcription at the level of physics uh"
"actions will be taken to try to get the"
"system back to where it needs to be so"
"basic homeostasis now"
"um here's the thing in in biology uh in"
"medicine we're very used to homeostatic"
"circuits so so that's that's no big"
"surprise uh for temperature and pH and"
"things like that however two things are"
"unusual here one is that in those kind"
"of systems the the the set the set point"
"is is the parameter is a scalar it's a"
"single number you know pH temperature or"
"something a metabolic State something"
"like that but here what we're saying is"
"the set point is actually some kind of"
"coarse grain anatomical descriptor so"
"the set point is complex here it's not a"
"it's not a single number it's a it's a"
"it's a shape descriptor and so that"
"that's unusual and the other thing is"
"that because this has this has the"
"cybernetic flavor of error minimization"
"it's um it's very much a goal directed"
"system in the in the in the formal uh"
"engineering control theory sense of a"
"goal it's a it's a state towards which"
"the system can repair use energy to try"
"to get back to that state despite"
perturbations
"and so so that that's kind of unusual"
"because because in in molecular biology"
"and and and feels like that you're not"
"supposed to talk about goals you're only"
"supposed to talk about feed forward"
"emergence and I think that's a big um"
"that's a big Miss uh for for uh for for"
"those kind of approaches so uh this way"
"of thinking this unusual way of thinking"
"about it makes a couple of very strong"
"predictions the first thing it says is"
"that well if this is true it has to have"
"an explicit encoding of the goal State"
"uh every thermostat that has a set point"
"to be recorded somewhere and in order to"
"have this kind of homeostatic circuit"
"you need to be able to know what the set"
"point is and so somewhere you have to"
"store the actual memory of what the"
"correct salamander looks like that"
"that's quite unusual and uh and if"
"that's true the prediction is is twofold"
"first of all that you should be able to"
"find it you should be able to decode it"
"and you should be able to rewrite it and"
"and the other big thing about this is"
"that if you do that that's a completely"
"different way of of controlling the"
"system than the traditional bottom-up"
"molecular biology approach because uh if"
"if this was an emergent system then your"
"only hope was was to somehow figure out"
"what to do down here which genes do I"
"alter so so for example if we decided"
"that we wanted"
"um more more fingers or we wanted this"
"to have three-fold symmetry instead of"
"bilateral symmetry can you figure out"
"which genes need to be changed to make"
"that happen and the answer is we have no"
"idea how to how to do that but um but"
"but there's potentially another approach"
"let's leave this let's leave the"
"hardware alone the way you would do with"
"a thermostat and and change the set"
"point can we decode that set point and"
"get the exact same cells to build"
"something completely different and so"
"what I'm going to show you now is is our"
"efforts um our efforts to do that"
"because we've basically uh uncovered the"
"idea that uh the informational medium"
"for this collective intelligence this"
"these groups of cells that do these"
"amazing things and repair and and and"
"and so on uh there is there is a kind of"
"cognitive glue that allows them to do"
"that that binds the individual cells"
"into a single agent that has goals in"
"morphe space and that glue is uh but"
"perhaps not shocking because that's what"
"that's what happens in the brain that"
"mechanism is developmental"
"bioelectricity so let's so so let's look"
"at let's look at brains as an example of"
"a biological system in which"
"uh this kind of problem-solving capacity"
"exists how do brains solve problems in"
"in three-dimensional space well the"
"hardware looks like this so it's a"
"network of of cells connected to each"
"other each cell has these little ION"
"channel proteins that allow the cell to"
"maintain different uh voltage potentials"
"and that electrical State can be"
"propagated to the neighbors through"
"these little electrical synapses known"
"as Gap Junctions and and so that kind of"
"Hardware is known to"
"um support an amazing kind of Behavioral"
"software so you see this here this this"
"group made this amazing video of uh"
"electrical activity in a zebrafish brain"
"and a living zebrafish brain as fish"
"think about whatever it is that fish"
"think about and this drives a um"
"uh this drives a process of uh or a"
"project of neural decoding so the idea"
"is that if we record all of this"
"activity and we learn to decode it we"
"will be able to read out the the the the"
"mental States the goals the preferences"
"um you know uh everything else about"
"this about the the the mental life of"
"the system because it is a commitment of"
"Neuroscience that uh all of the"
"cognitive content of the of the of the"
"organism is is stored and and"
"implemented by the brain physiology here"
"so it turns out so so so so that's the"
"that's the that's the standard um"
"Neuroscience story but it turns out that"
"Neuroscience is actually applicable Way"
"Beyond neurons because all of the cells"
"in your body have ion channels most of"
"them have Gap Junctions to their"
"neighbors and so what we've started is"
"the this idea this parallel idea of of"
"non-neural decoding where we can take a"
"look this happens to be a frog embryo"
"developing same same technology Imaging"
"the electrical conversations that these"
"cells have with each other we should be"
"able to decode this and from there"
"derive all of the protocognitive"
"capacities that the system is using to"
"navigate anatomical space and becoming a"
"proper embryo what does the collective"
"measure what does it remember what does"
"it know what errors does it try to"
"minimize all of these things we should"
"be able to discover if we knew how to"
"crack this bioelectric code and so so"
"the the interesting thing is that it's"
"extremely this this this architecture of"
"brain and behavior right where where the"
"DNA specifies the the the the the"
"electrical components and then you have"
"this this um"
"excitable medium that with with certain"
"architectures that then supports uh"
"Behavior which you can you can affect"
"not not just by editing the DNA but with"
"experience within with with uh with"
"electrical signals through the through"
"sensory organs with drugs and what it"
"does is it controls your muscles"
"electrically to move the body through"
"three-dimensional space"
"but of course this system is"
"evolutionarily ancient this was used"
"long before brains and um neurons"
"appeared even even bacterial biofilms"
"already knew how to do this what it does"
"is the is is uses the exact same it"
"exploits the exact same computational"
"capacities of electrical networks to"
"make decisions collectively that move"
"your body's shape through anatomical"
"morphe space so it controls your journey"
"not through a physical space but through"
"anatomical space before you have a brain"
"and muscles and and all of that and this"
"is this is not only evolutionarily"
"ancient but developmentally extremely"
"extremely early so there's a really"
"strong isomorphism here because"
"evolution of course likes to likes to"
"reuse things and and we think that what"
"it did was was simply pivot the same set"
"of Tricks into different effectors and"
"thus into different problem spaces"
"um and so so here are some tools we"
"developed them uh we developed these"
"these voltage sensitive dyes that allow"
"us to track all the electrical states of"
"for example an early embryo so here's a"
"time lapse taken by my colleague Danny"
"Adams we do a lot of computational"
"modeling to link it to the molecular"
"biology of these ion channels to figure"
"out which channels and pumps are"
"responsible for the states of individual"
"cells and then of course is the hard"
"work of doing the systems uh physiology"
"of figuring out what the what the"
"patterns mean so I'm going to show you"
"two examples of these patterns this is"
"uh this is a voltage movie Taken of an"
"early frog embryo putting its face"
"together and uh you can see here that um"
"this is one frame out of that movie that"
"basically we can now read out the"
"pattern memory that these cells have of"
"what a normal face looks like so before"
"all the genes come on and all the cells"
"become rearranged and everything this is"
"you can already see the tissue knows"
"here's where the mouth is going to go"
"here's where the first eye is going to"
"go the second eye comes later here are"
"the placards uh you can we can already"
"read out these pattern memories now this"
"is we know these are instructive because"
"if you change this using optogenetics or"
"various other techniques I'm going to"
"show you in a minute everything goes go"
"everything Downstream has changed the"
"gene expression has changed the the"
"um uh uh the position of the organs"
"change and and so on this is the this is"
"the reference point that serves as the"
"representation for way for for making"
"the uh this uh this embryo now now"
"that's that's the native one required"
"for normal development here's a"
"pathological one"
"um and and I'll talk a little bit about"
"more about this later but but basically"
"the idea that that what we can do is we"
"can inject human oncogenes into these"
"tadpoles they make little tumors but"
"even before the tumor becomes"
"morphologically apparent you can already"
"see the bioelectrical changes that"
"happen as this this oncogene causes"
"these cells to disconnect electrically"
"from their environment and uh go off and"
"live as amoebas uh treating the rest of"
"the body as the just just external world"
"so it breaks the connection of these"
"cells to This Global bioelectrical"
"pattern the collective intelligence is"
"is broken here so um to to to do these"
"functional experiments to manipulate"
"these things we've developed two kinds"
"of tools basically just uh everything uh"
"sort of stolen from neuroscience and and"
"and appropriated to other cells and"
"that's a very important Point none of"
"the techniques of Neuroscience"
"distinguish between neurons and other"
"cells everything works uh all the"
"concepts uh from from active inference"
"to uh by about purposes perceptual by"
"stability to um a rewritability of"
"memory all all these things work and and"
"the the actual tools work so we use all"
"the same all the same techniques we use"
"optogenetics we use neurotransmitter"
"drugs ION channel drugs all the same"
"stuff works"
"um now now keep in mind in the things"
"I'm going to show you there are no"
"electrical Fields being applied there"
"are no waves or magnets or radiation"
"enough nothing like that all we do is"
"control the native interface the native"
"bioelectrical interface that"
"um these uh uh that these cells expose"
"to each other to allow them to program"
"each other's behavior and that interface"
"of course are these Gap Junctions and"
"these ion channels so we use drugs we"
"use we use some light as an optogenetics"
"we can change the structure of these"
"channels and so on and so it's a to"
"change and so what we're trying to do is"
"change the resting potential and in"
"particular the spatial pattern of"
"resting potential this is not a single"
"cell phenomenon this is a network"
"phenomenon so what happens when you do"
"this well one thing that can happen is"
"that if we if we put in if we inject"
"into the early embryo mRNA encoding a"
"specific ION channel that will cause a"
"pattern that's similar to the pattern"
"that we saw in the electric face that I"
"just showed you we can induce those"
"cells to form an eye and so we can make"
"an eye anywhere not just in the anterior"
"and the rectoderm which is where the"
"textbooks will tell you the only tissue"
"competent to become an eye are so that's"
"not true if you go go far Upstream of"
"Master I genes like pac-6 and and set"
"the correct electrical State you can"
"convince any region of the body to make"
"an eye for example the gut here okay and"
"so if you section These Eyes they have"
"all the same components that normal eyes"
"do so so here are your lens your retina"
"your optic your optic neural of that is"
"is here and and so so uh so notice"
"notice a couple of interesting things"
"first of all this this shows you that"
"these bioelectrical patterns are"
"instructive they don't just make they're"
"not just Epi phenomena they don't just"
"make defects they're actually"
"instructive Force for large scale"
pattern
"also notice the modular control this"
"electrical state that says build an eye"
"here is basically a subroutine call we"
"don't provide all the information needed"
"to uh to make an eye it's a very simple"
"electrical State that's that's a that's"
"a simple State Downstream all the"
"complexity of actually carrying it out"
"does not have to be micromanaged that's"
"very interesting and they have an"
"interesting capacity that is seen for"
"example in ant colonies which is"
"recruitment if I only inject a small"
"number of cells not enough to make this"
"whole lens this whole thing is a lens"
"sitting out in the tail of a tadpole"
"somewhere if I only inject a few cells"
"what they do is they recruit their"
"neighbors so the blue cells are the ones"
"whose voltage we changed these other"
"cells we never targeted them they're"
"completely wild type they become"
"recruited to this process of making this"
"a very nice lens so they have the"
"ability to recruit their neighbors to"
"handle a task that there's not enough of"
"them to do that that's a that's an"
"interesting capacity of collective"
"intelligence what can you uh what can we"
"make well we can make um ectopic Hearts"
"we can make legs so here's our"
"six-legged frog we can make ectopic"
"forebrains using this technique we can"
"make inner ear organs or odor cysts you"
"can also make fins now that's kind of"
"weird because tadpoles aren't supposed"
"to have fins that's more of a fish thing"
"but I'll show you what's what's going on"
"here in a minute"
"um so so so whole whole organs can be"
"re-specified again we're we're"
"programming the collective we're not"
"telling individual stem cells what"
"tissue to be we're telling a whole"
"region you should be an eye and or or a"
"leg or something else and and what is an"
"eye or like individual cells don't have"
"any way of representing that but"
"collectives do and the way they"
"represent it is through these electrical"
"signals now now biomedically of course"
"we're using this now to uh to to try to"
"uh uh achieve certain goals in"
"regenerative medicine so here's our leg"
"regeneration project so frogs normally"
"do not regenerate their legs unlike"
"salamanders um if you amputate 45 days"
"later there's uh at this stage there's"
"basically nothing but what we've done is"
"we've created a bioelectrical uh"
"cocktail that when you apply to the"
"early wound uh shifts the"
"decision-making of that Collective"
"towards a leg regenerating uh uh goal"
"and there and and then so so it's just a"
"um a single day treatment and then you"
"get about a year of leg growth and by 45"
"days already here are your here's this"
"MSX one"
"um uh uh uh by steamer marker the the"
"blastema genes are turned on and then by"
"45 days you've already got some toenail"
"you've got a toenail you've got some"
"toes and eventually a quite respectable"
"leg and the leg is you can see here it's"
"touch sensitive and it's small tile so"
"the animal can use can use this like"
"okay so so again it's this idea of"
"communicating a very simple thing to the"
"collective and then taking your hands"
"off the wheel not trying to micromanage"
"what the stem cells do or or or what the"
"gene expression is all of that is"
"handled top down the idea is to give the"
"the appropriate information at the very"
"beginning and I have to I have to do a"
"disclosure here because um David Kaplan"
"and I are co-founders of a scientific"
"co-founders of a company called"
"morpheuticals which is trying now the"
"same technology in mammals and the idea"
"is to ultimately go to uh Limb and organ"
"regeneration in human patients someday"
"so um I want to go back to this uh to"
"this amazing amazing creature which are"
"these uh these planarium and really"
"think about uh uh try to try to really"
"uh cash out this idea that that these"
"Electrical uh much like in the brain"
"this electrical network is really uh"
"storing the uh"
"the goals and the and the and the and"
"the informational content of the"
"collective intelligence and so and just"
"to introduce you to this to this"
"creature a little bit uh quite complex"
"many different organs uh true brain you"
"can chop them into pieces and every"
"piece knows exactly what's needed to"
"form a perfect little worm in fact they"
"are so good at maintaining the correct"
"shape that they do this all the time in"
"their bodies and thus are Immortal"
"there's no such thing as an old"
"planarian uh they um they don't age at"
"the level of the organism they just keep"
going
"um and and you know that that that that"
"they have to have a very developed uh uh"
"system of of Global Communication"
"because if you cut them in half this"
"half becomes a tail this these cells up"
"here form ahead but these cells were"
"direct neighbors a moment ago so that"
"decision to make a head or a tail can't"
"be locally determined in these cells"
"they have to communicate with the rest"
"of the body do we already have a head"
"which wear is the wound facing and then"
"they make their decision so"
"understanding this this decision-making"
"process was really key for us"
"um we developed a model of of of of"
"bioelectrical signaling at the wound"
"that appears to be involved in that"
"head-tailed decision and that allows you"
"to do the following thing uh here's a"
"normal planarian one head one tail it"
"has normal gene expression anterior"
"genes in it turned on in the head and"
"then when you amputate this guy you get"
"100 of the time you get a one-headed"
"Offspring from this from this middle"
"middle fragment but what you can also do"
"is you can also take one of these again"
"same thing anatomically normal uh"
"transcriptionally normal and it makes a"
"two-headed worm this is not Photoshop"
"these are real I'm real animals and you"
"ask well why is it that I just told you"
"that this was an incredibly reliable"
"process why did this guy form an ectopic"
"head at the posterior because having"
"figured out this electrical circuit we"
"were able to rewrite their pattern"
"memory of what a correct planarian is"
"supposed to look like so here is what"
"this animal represents as a normal"
"planarian one head one tail this is"
"again voltage voltage Imaging but we"
"were able to and this is of course"
"somewhat messy but the technique is is"
"being worked out"
"we were able to change that electrical"
"pattern by acting on the ion channels"
"and the Gap Junctions uh to be to store"
"this two heads and then when you cut"
"that animal it makes a two-headed worm"
"now this is really critical this"
"electrical map is not an electrical map"
"of this animal this electrical map is a"
"map of this perfectly normal"
"anatomically one-headed animal that and"
"this is an electrical memory that is"
"latent it's not doing anything this"
"animal it doesn't match the anatomy the"
"idea of I should be two-headed does not"
"match the current state which is"
"one-headed it's late that memory is"
"latent because we we rewrote it but"
"nothing happens until you injure the"
"animal once you injure the animal and"
"cut and and cut off this middle fragment"
"then it consults that memory and then it"
"becomes two-headed so this is if you're"
"interested in neuroscience and and our"
"brain's amazing ability for what they"
"call time travel the ability to store"
"and imagine states that are not true"
"right now so either things that were"
"true or things that might be true later"
"but are not true right now I think this"
"is a good example of a very basic"
"um kind of um primitive version of this"
"because this tissue can store a"
"bioelectrical pattern of what it will do"
"if it gets injured in the future it's a"
"counter factual memory it's not true"
"right now and so a single planarian body"
"can store up to two different ideas of"
"what a correct planarian should look"
"like and so I promised you earlier on"
"that that I would show you that that"
"we can find and edit the the cognitive"
"medium of this collective intelligence"
"of morphogenesis and here it is when we"
"ask where is the information that guides"
"what you build here it is it's it's it's"
"a it's uh represented much like in the"
"brain by stable electrical states in the"
"in the tissue that guide the activity"
"and no doubt there's more than two but"
"this is this is what we've worked out"
"now I keep calling it a memory why"
"because we we we also find out that if"
"you take these two two-headed worms"
"um and and here they are so you can see"
"you can see the video of of them live if"
"we take these two-headed worms and we"
"continue cutting them in plain water no"
"more manipulation of any kind this"
"middle portion will continue to regrow"
"two-headed worms even though their"
"genetics is completely untouched so let"
"me let me reiterate that there's nothing"
"genetically wrong with these animals we"
"did not change the hardware at all what"
"we changed very with is was of using a"
"very brief physiological manipulation of"
"the electrical State basically a"
"stimulus right we we communicated uh to"
"this collective intelligence within with"
"a brief physiological stimulus of"
"turning the channels on and off the way"
"that it happens for example in your"
"retina when you see stimuli we've"
"communicated the idea that there should"
"be two heads instead of one and once you"
"do this the circuit holds that memory"
"and in the future with no more"
"manipulation despite the wild type"
"genetics it will continue to generate a"
"completely different uh anatomy and so"
"the question but you know the Deep"
"question of what determines how many"
"heads you have you can't simply say DNA"
"what the DNA does is gives you a"
"hardware machine a bioelectrical machine"
"that by default generates a memory of a"
"one-headed pattern but it's rewritable"
"and if you rewrite it it will it will"
"maintain so and so this has all the"
"properties of memory it's long term"
"stable but it's got some it's it's"
"labile a little bit it can be Rewritten"
"it has conditional recall which I just"
"showed you it has discrete possible"
behaviors
"so what we're doing right now is really"
"trying to use some techniques for um"
"from from connectionist um machine"
"learning and some other some other tools"
"of uh of uh of dynamical systems theory"
"and some other things to really pull"
"together what we know about the"
"physiology the electrophysiology of the"
"circuit and the state space of the"
"circuit and the ability of the system to"
"do amazing things like uh regain"
"specific States if it's pulled out of"
"that condition and also to be rewritable"
"uh the way that that memory um in in"
"real and artificial neural networks is"
"rewritable now we can now what's"
"interesting is this as memory goes"
"beyond the number Beyond setting the"
"number of heads it also goes to the uh"
"it also is involved in the in setting"
"the shape of the heads so this is a"
"perfectly um normal uh"
"Dorado cephala with this nice triangular"
"head and uh what we can do without"
"changing the DNA is cut off the head and"
"then perturb the bio electric Network"
"topology of this of this creature by by"
"blocking the Gap Junctions for a little"
"bit then you let it go and the system"
"settles back down but when it settles"
"back down it can make flatheads like a"
"pflena it can make round heads like an S"
"Mediterranean or it can make uh the you"
"know the the normal heads and so what"
"you see is that and and by the way not"
"only not only the the head shape but"
"actually also the the shape of the brain"
"and the distribution of the stem cells"
"become exactly like these other"
"organisms they are about 100 to 150"
"million years evolutionary distance and"
"so you can ask this the exact same"
"Hardware to make heads belonging to"
"other species so basically other"
"attractors in the state space of this"
"electrical circuit correspond to other"
"species so Evolution can can search the"
"the space the state space of this"
"bioelectrical circuit to derive these"
"other species and it does not uh it does"
"not require a genetic change although of"
"course it might become genetically"
"assimilated that change may become"
"genetically assimilated and then become"
"become heritable"
"um okay and not only can you find other"
"species in that morphos space which"
"Darcy Thompson gave us this idea of of"
"of of amorphous space a mathematical"
"amorphous space"
"um in that uh in that amorphous space"
"you can find other things that don't"
"look like planaria at all you can find"
"these weird spiky forms you can find"
"these cylindrical things that aren't"
"flat you can find combinations sort of"
"hybrid hybrid forms all of this is done"
"with exactly the same cells so um I want"
"to take just uh just a a few minutes now"
"to go back to uh really thinking about"
"the mechanisms of this collective"
"intelligence idea what I've shown you so"
"far is that uh individual cells which"
"are themselves competent to solve"
"problems in transcriptional space in"
"metabolic space in a physiological space"
"are bound together in a multicellular"
"organism to solve anatomical problems"
"okay problems in anatomical amorphous"
"space and then eventually Evolution"
"reused it to for for to make brains to"
"solve behavioral problems and eventually"
"linguistic space and so on so so I want"
"to talk for a few minutes about"
"uh how does this scaling work how do"
"these individuals how do you go from"
"from from numerous tiny little little"
"Proto mines to one uh one larger um"
"cognitive uh system and so uh so I want"
"to show you some hypotheses about that"
um
"in a uh uh in in evolution what we have"
"through multicellularity is an expansion"
"of gold States so this this cell is very"
"good at handling very local goals it's"
"never going to work towards any other"
"sort of large-scale goal but together in"
"a collective and I've shown you some"
"evidence that what binds that Collective"
"together is Electrical uh communication"
"and the properties of electrical"
"networks they can work on much bigger"
"goals in a different space so so here's"
"the goal of making a limb and if you've"
"made a limb and I deviate you from that"
"goal you will use uh as as the cellular"
"Collective you will use energy and very"
"rapidly try to get back to that state so"
"so individual cells have no idea what a"
"finger is or how many fingers you're"
"supposed to have or anything like that"
"but the collective certainly does and it"
"will keep implementing this under um"
"under under various types of"
"deformations so that is taking a bunch"
"of um uh low-level minds and making um"
"making something that's able to pursue"
"large-scale goals in an in a different"
"space in the anatomical space"
"but that uh that set of mechanisms it"
"has a failure mode and that failure mode"
"is known as cancer so this is human"
"glioblastoma in culture and so what's"
"happened to these cells is that they"
"have disconnected from each other"
"electrically and when they do that they"
"roll back down to their unicellular past"
"they no longer are able to be a part of"
"a network that perceives large-scale"
"goals so they they go back to their"
"early initial goals which were every"
"cell wants to become two cells and to go"
"wherever life is good and that's and"
"that's cancer and metastasis so we need"
"to understand this process of scaling up"
"and and the various failure modes and I"
"think that basically what happens is"
simply
"um that that when you have single cells"
"they have a little bit of memory going"
"backwards they have a little bit this"
"has been shown in the field of basal"
"cognition cells have the ability to"
"anticipate future stimuli but it's quite"
"small right both in space and time it's"
"quite small and when you join together"
"into larger networks you have uh more"
"computational ability to store past"
"memories you have more ability to"
"predict futures States and you have a"
"larger spatial perception you're able to"
"collectively measure things on a"
"physically larger scale and so if this"
"is how collectives form we ought to be"
"able to use this to address the cancer"
"problem and in fact that's that's what"
"we've done is to say okay uh the"
"oncogene is there we're not going to try"
"to edit the genome or to kill or to"
"somehow kill those cells or to remove"
"that that onco protein what we're going"
"to do instead is force those cells to"
"remain in electrical communication with"
"their neighbors regardless of what the"
"oncogene says and so when you do that"
"here's the the oncoprotein is labeled"
"with red fluorescence it's very bright"
"in fact it's all over the place you can"
"see this is the same animal there's no"
"tumor because what we've done is we've"
"co-injected a particular ION channel"
"that sets an electrical state that"
"forces these cells into the normal uh"
"communication with their neighbors and"
"they participate in normal morphogenesis"
"they make skin they make for the various"
"organs instead of going off on their own"
"and making a tumor so this is another"
"example of taking advantage of the of"
"the decision making and this at the"
"software level to get a different"
"outcome even though your Hardware is is"
"different right and so that we we've"
"we've had in our lab many examples of"
"addressing these kind of Hardware"
"problems uh at the at the um at the"
"software level by by exploiting this"
"this Collective uh phenomena so what"
"we're interested in is uh how to what"
"happens when when individual uh"
"individual cells which can do this kind"
"of homeostatic Loop how they uh scale up"
"to be a collective of coupled homeostats"
"that can do very interesting things like"
"navigate problem spaces and so on and so"
"what you really have here is an"
"expansion of something I call the"
"cognitive light cone for any being and"
"this is this goes back to my initial"
"stated goal which is that we want a"
"framework where we can put anything we"
"can compare anything in the same"
"framework so whether it's natural evolve"
"design whatever"
"so uh in uh in any frame any any agent"
"what what do all uh cognitive systems uh"
"have in common what do all agents have"
"in common what they have in common is a"
"certain uh cognitive light cone which is"
"the spatial and temporal size of the"
"largest goal that they can pursue so if"
"you uh can only uh if you only uh care"
"about the local concentration of um some"
"kind of chemical and uh you have a"
"little bit of memory and all all you're"
"trying to do is optimize your local uh"
"chemical concentration you might be a"
"bacterium or a tick as far as cognitive"
"Litecoin size is concerned so very small"
"uh if you're a dog you have a bigger"
"cognitive like one you have lots more"
"memory going back you have some"
"predictive ability to go in future but"
"you're never going to care about what"
"happens three months from now in a town"
"that's 10 miles over it's just"
"impossible for as far as we know it's"
"impossible for uh for a dog to have that"
"that large scale of goals and so you"
"have a bigger light cone but it's you"
"know it's still delimited if you're a"
"human you might have you might be"
"working towards goals that are planetary"
"scale for hundreds of uh years into the"
"future in fact past your own lifespan"
"um and so you might have this this"
"enormous cognitive light cone and if"
"you're uh some sort of a alien being or"
"a future a future uh human that has uh"
"has a much bigger uncognitive light cone"
"you might um you might be able to uh"
"care for example in the linear range"
"about all the living beings on Earth"
"yeah the humans can't do that we don't"
"we don't have the capacity to to scale"
"our care linearly beyond us you know"
"some some small number of concerns but"
"but there could be potentially enormous"
"Minds that could that could literally do"
"that you know this kind of uh"
"uh this kind of uh advance to form so so"
"so all of us have these cognitive light"
"cones and evolution is a journey that of"
"of enlarging these lichens that that"
"then allow us to have bigger goals in"
"different spaces and of course we are"
"composite beings full of other uh uh"
"organisms or other cells and and organs"
"and cells all of which have their own"
"different sizes of lichens in different"
"spaces so I'm going to end um in a"
"couple minutes uh with one last thing I"
"want to show you um one uh one last"
"thing which is a completely new organism"
"uh and then and then I'll and then I'll"
"finish so I mean I have to do disclosure"
"again because uh Josh bongard and I are"
"scientific co-founders of fauna systems"
"which works on computer design synthetic"
"organisms what we wanted to do was we"
"wanted to ask uh how much uh plasticity"
"do cells have to"
"um navigate their various spaces okay"
"and and what could we could we um"
"liberate wild-type cells from their"
"normal uh normal environment and"
"estimate to reboot their their their"
"multicellularity what what would they do"
"okay and so this is this is this is the"
"experiment here what happens is that um"
"this is uh we take um uh and this is uh"
"Doug Blackiston in my group uh did uh"
"did all the biology for this work and"
"this was done in in collaboration with"
"Josh bongard's Lab at University of"
"Vermont and his student Sam kriegman did"
"all the computational aspects so so we"
"take we take the uh the animal cap cells"
"from this early frog these are skin"
"these are these are faded to be uh to be"
"epidermis of various types and we"
"dissociate them and then we put them in"
"this little um this little depression"
"and uh and we leave them overnight and"
"you wonder what might happen well they"
"could die they could spread out they get"
"away from each other they could form a"
"two-dimensional monolayer the way that"
"cell culture does instead what they do"
"is uh overnight this is a time lapse"
"they coalesce they come together and"
"they form this little um this little"
"circular thing uh which has an"
"interesting uh property we call it a"
"xenobot because xenopus lavis is the"
"name of the frog and it's a biorobotics"
"platform so it's a biobot so we call it"
"a xenobi what does the zenobot do well"
"first of all it swims uh on its own"
"power we do not uh Pace it or direct it"
"in any way how does it swim you can see"
"that here it has little hairs these"
"little hairs are normally used by the"
"Frog embryo to distribute mucus on the"
"surface of its body to to sort of keep"
"the mucus flowing down but but this"
"thing these guys have figured out how to"
"how to roll in opposite directions on"
"either side of of this of this uh of the"
"structure and as a result it can it can"
"swim so they can go uh they can go in"
"circles they can Patrol back and forth"
"like this they can have Collective"
"behaviors here's here's a bunch of them"
"these two are interacting with each"
"other these guys are sitting there doing"
"nothing this one is taking a kind of a"
"long journey around the petri dish"
"um here's one here's one navigating a"
"maze um what you can see here the water"
"is perfectly still here it will move"
"forward it uh takes a turn without"
"bumping into the opposite wall and then"
"at this point for some internal reason"
"that we don't know it decides to turn"
"around and go back where it came from"
"this is a very uh simple example of uh"
"spontaneous self-determined motion"
"there's some kind of process inside that"
"that guides what it does it can take"
"turns it can uh change change direction"
"and and go back uh if we scan the um if"
"we scan the uh the physiology this is"
"calcium signaling so what we're Imaging"
"is is is calcium spiking in these cells"
"what you see is that very much like"
"um you might see in uh in brains uh you"
"see you see a bunch of calcium spiking"
"we're currently using all the same"
"techniques that you might use in"
"Neuroscience to analyze uh the"
"information uh flows here uh in fact"
"within the within each xenobot but also"
"between xenobots who knows maybe they're"
"they're somehow talking to each other"
"and you can detect that using"
"information Theory approaches they"
"regenerate if you cut it in half they"
"will uh they will seal themselves back"
"up so here so here it's basically cut in"
"half like this and then they'll seal"
"themselves back up to a norm to a new uh"
"xenobot shape and then here's the most"
"amazing part of all uh it was noticed"
"that when you simulate these Bots with"
"objects in their environment what you"
"find out is that um actually their their"
"behaviors tend to tend to collect uh"
"particles into little into little groups"
"and so what we decided to do based based"
"on this based on an AI kind of model of"
"of their morphogenesis and behavior is"
"we decided to give them some actual"
"other cells to play with and what we"
"found out was was something amazing uh"
"what they do is so so this white stuff"
"here these are these are loose skin"
"cells and what the xenobots do is they"
"run around and they collect these skin"
"cells into little balls and because"
"we're dealing here not with a passive"
"material but with an agential material"
"meaning with living cells the same"
"material that Evolution works with so we"
"as human Engineers the xenobots and"
"evolution all three of us work with this"
"kind of agential material and what that"
"allows it what that allows is that when"
"they do make these little little balls"
"overnight the balls themselves mature"
"into the next generation of xenobot"
"which then will run around and do"
"exactly the same thing and you get the"
"Next Generation and the Next Generation"
"and so on"
"so think about what this means we've"
"made it impossible for these guys to"
"reproduce in the normal uh froggy"
"fashion it's just skin there's no"
"neurons there there's no reproductive"
"Machinery these are the dishes but just"
"balls of skin basically"
"um but what they've been able to do is"
"to fulfill Von Neumann's dream which is"
"to which is a robot that that goes"
"around and collects materials from its"
"environment and makes copies of itself"
"and that's what it does and we call this"
"kinematic replication so um so so the"
"last the last bit here is simply this"
"uh let's let's think about this for a"
"minute um there's been no genomic"
"editing here we didn't change the genome"
"we didn't provide some weird Nano"
"material uh"
"when you sequence The genome here all"
"you see is that a standard xenopus labus"
"so so when we ask what does the xenopus"
"lavis genome actually encode well it"
"encodes cells it encodes a hardware"
"machine that under normal circumstances"
"produces this it produces a set of"
"standard embryonic stages and then some"
"tadpoles that can do this kind of"
"behavior but under different"
"circumstances these same cells can solve"
"the problem differently and they can"
"become a xenobot with its own weird"
"developmental stage uh and then its own"
"uh very unusual um uh Behavior so as far"
"as we know no other system does"
"kinematic self-replication"
"so uh so so here here are a couple of"
"interesting interesting things here"
"um first of all"
"this is engineering by subtraction we"
"didn't add anything but what we did do"
"is we liberated these cells from the"
"normal influence of the other cells so"
"if you look at a normal embryo in their"
"skin cells and you ask what do they know"
"how to do well you say well all they can"
"do is be this boring two-dimensional"
"layer sitting on the outside of the"
"animal keeping out the bacteria but in"
"fact uh what you find out by by"
"putting them on their own is that yeah"
"that's normally what they do when"
"there's so sort of behavior shaped or"
"bullied by these other cells into into"
"having that role but on their own their"
"default behavior is actually this so you"
"can start to think about Evolution as a"
"way of searching the space of behavior"
"shaping stimuli how do how do we get"
"cells to tell other cells what to do and"
"because you're dealing with an agential"
"material not uh non-passive Legos but an"
"a gentle material these cells already"
"have certain capacities you can't just"
"put them where you want and have them"
"stay there you have to you have to um"
"use various signals to get them to do uh"
"to get them to change their their native"
"behaviors the other thing about this is"
"that for any other living organism if"
"you ask why does it have a certain shape"
"or certain size of certain behaviors the"
"answer usually is well Evolution the"
"anatomical goals Come From Evolution"
"you've been selected for eons to be a"
"specific kind of shape well there's"
"never been any xenobots there's never"
"been any uh evolutionary pressure to be"
"a good xenobot all of this is completely"
"emergent from the uh from the um generic"
"problem-solving capacity of these cells"
"so one of the things we're working on is"
"is understanding how it is that"
"Evolution makes not just specific"
"solutions to specific environments but"
"actually problem solving machines that"
"have the capacity to do new things and"
"new environments that they never had"
"specific selection for"
"uh so um and and we're at the moment uh"
"uh studying their their cognitive"
"capacities we actually have no idea what"
"what can they learn what do they sense"
"what are their preferences all of that"
"um remains to be um to be determined so"
"I'm gonna I'm gonna end here with two"
"things first just stay um uh just a"
"summary of of the kind of philosophical"
"aspects of what I've told you so so in"
"my framework I think that we have to"
"look at uh agency as a Continuum not"
"binary categories uh and we have to"
"really understand"
"um how it is that these uh capacities"
"change when bodies and and Minds change"
"uh I think that persuadability is a is a"
"useful engineering"
"um way to organize that access which"
"enables what I what I've shown you is"
"that it enables uh important"
"um it enables new discoveries and new"
"capabilities in biomedicine and then so"
"on by thinking about how to communicate"
"with these cell groups and so on I think"
"there's no privileged substrate for"
"cognition I think that there's nothing"
"magical about uh about um biological"
"substrates it's uh we're going to have"
"intelligences that are that are"
"extremely diverse"
"we have this notion of the self"
"described by a cognitive light cone as"
"the the size of the goal the largest"
"goal that it's capable of pursuing with"
"this idea of evolution and Engineers"
"pivoting these systems through different"
"problem spaces and it doesn't have to be"
"three-dimensional space when when we"
"look at how intelligent we think a"
"system is we're really taking an IQ test"
"ourselves to ask whether we've"
"recognized uh the space that it's"
"working in whatever goals it's trying to"
"reach and its competencies in reaching"
"those goals those are not apparent"
"immediately like as I showed you for"
"development it looks like it's uh always"
"does the same thing it's actually much"
"more much more clever than that I've"
"shown you that developmental"
"bioelectricity is a evolutionary"
"precursor of of brain Dynamics and it's"
"basically the physiological medium for"
"the software of multicellular life it's"
"the it's the"
"um substrate in which the cognition the"
"proto-cognition of the morphogenetic"
"Swarm intelligence is held and I've"
"shown you the examples of reading and"
"rewriting the memories of that uh of"
"that intelligent uh swarm and this is"
"just the beginning these are these are"
"very early primitive kind of experiments"
"still and that I think that uh we have a"
"really uh interesting implications for"
"evolution here which is not only uh due"
"to the multi-scale competency of the"
"organs you know you put a bunch of eye"
"cells on the tail and they can still"
"form an eye they figure out how to"
"connect and the whole thing still still"
"sort of works if you have a mouth that's"
"often the wrong place it will readjust"
"itself uh so so this has many"
"implications for for evolution and and a"
"really fundamental question of where do"
"these goals come from if it's not just"
"selection and so the last thing I'm"
"going to say is this that that um when"
"Darwin uh said the the phrase endless"
forms
"um most beautiful when he was uh"
"interested uh and and impressed in the a"
"wide variety of of shapes out there in"
"the biological world all of that is a"
"tiny corner of possible uh space of"
"Agents because biology is highly"
"interoperable it solves problems that"
"it's never seen before which means that"
"any combination of evolved material"
"designed material and software is some"
"kind of viable agent so we have high"
"broads and cyborgs and all kinds of"
"different things that many of these are"
"already being made but but some of them"
"will be in the future and we really need"
"a new kind of Ethics to be able to"
"relate to sentient beings that are very"
"different from us they have a different"
"origin story they have a different"
"composition and they have a different"
"kind of um a kind of intelligence so all"
"of the details are can be found in these"
"in these papers which I'm happy to send"
"to you if anybody's interested I want to"
"thank all the people that uh did the uh"
"that did the work these are the postdocs"
"and the students that did all the all"
"the hard work here are our support staff"
"my many collaborators um our funders so"
"many people that have supported this"
"work and I thank you for listening"
