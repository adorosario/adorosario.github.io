"hi everybody and welcome to this laser"
talk
um
"leonardo laser talk is a program of"
"international gatherings that brings"
"together artists scientists humanists"
"and technologists for informal"
"presentations performances and"
"conversations with the wider public"
"the mission of lazar is to encourage"
"contribution to the cultural environment"
"of a region by fostering"
"interdisciplinary dialogue and"
"opportunities for community building"
"over 40 cities worldwide"
"this laser talk is organized in"
"collaboration with a hybrid lab network"
platform
"which will be introduced later by"
"professor laura belov"
"some instructions for our participants"
"so we have a hybrid format today"
"online participants as well as"
"participants in the room in helsinki"
"and the event is live streamed and"
recorded
"online participants are muted and the"
"video will be off during the old event"
"please feel free to use the chat on zoom"
"to communicate with other attendees or"
"panelists and we will do our best to"
react
"there will be a chance to ask a few"
"questions after each talk as well as at"
"the end of the presentations for the"
"online participants if you want your"
"questions to be answered live please use"
"the question and answer section that you"
"see in the toolbar"
"the moderator and panelists will be"
"taking questions after the presentations"
"in case something goes wrong"
"or the connection breaks we will do our"
"best to fix it as soon as possible"
and
"please participate actively"
"but we also remind that this dog is the"
"safe space free from any kind of"
"discrimination or harassment"
"and we hope that you feel comfortable"
"and enjoy"
so
"the first"
"presentation today is professor lara"
"belov phd"
"who is an internationally acclaimed"
"artist and researcher in the"
"cross-section of art technology and"
science
"additionally to research articles and"
"book chapters the outcome of the"
"research is in the form of experimental"
"art projects that deal with the merger"
"of the technological and biological"
"matter at large"
"currently she is associate professor and"
"head of"
"doctoral education in the department of"
"art and media don alto university"
"welcome lauer"
"um thanks aurora and uh anyway thank you"
"all of you coming that's super nice and"
"and i'm"
"a special thank you of course for our"
"speakers who's one is present here here"
"on a tour and who are"
"online chose bongart and michael levin"
"and um now i have to do the the the duty"
"of uh introducing a little bit the"
"funders and so on so so we're also"
"collecting names as you notice and this"
"is a european commission"
"uh regulation on on funding bodies and"
um
the
"hybrid lab network project i just"
"changed the slide if i sorry"
"there it is"
"yeah so this is a"
"erasmus plus strategic partnership"
project
"and here are the partners so i just tell"
"you this was initiated by the"
"i3s which is a bioscience research"
"institute from portugal then there's a"
"bach society which represents citizen"
science
"side of the thing then there's an alma"
"mater european university from slovenia"
"which is a humanities"
"expertise and of course aldo university"
"where we represent the art expertise"
"and here i remember to put the the the"
"european union logo also which is"
"missing from some of the other"
"aspects so just very shortly um i don't"
"i'm not going to do a much of an"
"introduction but i just wanted to"
"say a little bit about the"
"that in this hybrid lab network project"
"we actually focused on crispr gene"
"editing method quite a lot and developed"
"it and especially um we were interested"
"of can you develop a crispr gene editing"
"in vitro and that means that um you"
"don't need this kind of science"
"licensing but could it could there be a"
"method where where one is able to use it"
"in the artistic laboratories and so on"
"so so this has been one of the focuses"
"and and quite a lot of course went on on"
"on that side"
"and um based on that and also the topic"
"of of today's talk is"
"uh beyond our title is beyond"
"spontaneous generation so what is"
"spontaneous generation it's a kind of"
"historical theory that um which"
"understood that life was emerging"
"spontaneously from non-living matter"
"so of course this was then proven wrong"
"but maybe there's a time to look at it"
"again in another way and and this is"
"part of the talk"
"and and of course this links a little"
"bit to the idea of a code so underneath"
"all this development is a code and i put"
"it here there"
"this is a letter to his son"
"by francis kirk and james watson when"
"they kind of"
"made the dna as a code"
"now i say made dna as a code i think"
"it's usually"
"talked about as discovered as a code but"
"i think it's not so"
"straightforward that it had to be a code"
"but um"
"what because at that moment when that"
"happened what also"
"happened was that"
the
"elementary unit of life became"
"informational and that's quite"
"interesting and and of course"
"i'm sort of interested in between"
"biology and technologies also gene"
"editing and all this is based on code"
"but so is computation as we all know"
"and uh here's a very uh short quote from"
"lily k who who wrote that"
"about this moment of of deciphering the"
"dna as a code that no longer was"
"biological specificity"
"captured solely within the viscose"
"materiality of biological pattern now"
"the transmitted messages were"
"constituted through alphabetical writing"
"as a form of verbal heredity the"
"newness discourse emerged as a pure"
representation
"now i would like to point here also that"
"this is actually the dna 1950s 1940s is"
"that same time when"
"information theories were sort of are"
"developed and having this kind of height"
"so it is a peculiar and interesting that"
"that this also what was pushed to that"
"direction and maybe it was something"
that
"it was seen because of other"
developments
"i have very few of course i had to put"
"here convince game of game of life which"
"i think most of you know which is"
"computational uh instructions and and go"
on
"go on eternally sometimes they die"
"though but uh"
"but uh as a as a sort of a pattern"
"pattern of living"
"um here are a couple of artworks then so"
"convoy is of course from the science"
"side these are from the art side eduardo"
"cox agnes is quite early in 1999 this"
"didn't use gene"
editing
"such as crispr but it is transgenic so"
"so there was a dna again changed to a"
"morse code and changed to a synthetic"
"dna and uh"
"and that was uh then pushed into a"
bacteria
"and here's something what we um also"
"looked with the hybrid lab uh network"
"project so gunter seifried and robert"
"von d rendonk"
"like starting to look into these"
"possibilities of"
"what if the crispr editing could you"
"edit an image"
"and i think that there's something"
"interesting especially from the arts"
"where the image making has been so so um"
"strong throughout the history"
"so what does it mean to edit an image"
"with crispr"
"and and like a gene editing and"
"and in the next image actually you will"
see
"this is how it looks like looks pretty"
"different compared to the artist studio"
"in the earlier times where you maybe"
"painted certain things with the gestures"
"and here you actually are kind of under"
"the kind of very strict science or"
"laboratory protocols and methods so here"
"we are creating an image with a crispr"
"gene editing and and just as a in the"
"previous image i just say here the the"
bull
"returned to delmon it's an uh kind of"
"historical bull image and what is edited"
"here so the the first image is so that"
"that um the image is translated to dna"
"the lab is making the dna as a liquid"
"which comes to you so it's synthesized"
"then here in the"
"lower image their eyes are opened so"
"that's a tiny crisper editing"
"and and i can just tell you that this"
"was uh"
"not the the first one which succeeded so"
"there were many mistakes and so on going"
on
"and and"
"of course one can always as an artist"
"also ask why bother because it's uh it's"
"quite laborious however like we will"
"hear today a lot of these science"
scientific
"developments also from earlier times"
"have actually impacted arts a lot"
"and maybe this is also something to"
"think about or think about"
"what kind of art is made what kind of"
"artist are we in the"
"in the longer run"
"and uh"
"i just put it here because in in this"
"hybrid lab network project you can find"
"on the website the protocols and and"
"they will come more still there the"
"project still goes on about half a year"
"so they will come more protocols with"
"the idea that labs can take them and"
"sort of use them so"
"i was then also looking into what is"
"good about it and what is not so good or"
"what are the challenges and the good"
"thing is definitely that when when you"
"do it in vitro in silico so it's"
"synthetic dna and"
"and everything is just on the petrodius"
"you don't deal with the living organisms"
"in that sense so that doesn't require"
"licensing so so that makes it possible"
"maybe to learn about it but also to to"
"kind of look at it and experiment and"
"think with it by making"
"however what is uh quite challenging"
"with that is that it's quite laborious"
"it's very many steps with the in the"
"laboratory what you have to make and"
"take time and in in that sense i would"
"say almost boring a little bit"
"and and uh but the biggest challenge i"
"think is in the pricing because you have"
"to send the the the code to be"
"synthesized that comes back to you"
"then you do editing with the kind of"
"liquids and and with the crispr method"
"and then you send it back to the company"
"and then they they kind of look okay"
"what what's there now and send it to"
"back to you"
"so so"
"i think the pricing is the"
"biggest challenge and that also links to"
the
"um the the size of the image you can"
"have because if let's say each pixel is"
"its own code of color"
"then then this the bigger the image the"
"more you would need uh the longest dna"
"and maybe also challenging"
"potentially maybe in the near future"
"there comes a little bit more quicker"
"and easier sort of our clustered systems"
"in that but i think those are the"
"challenges and"
"that's about i've read loudly someone is"
"interested i've just written a paper on"
this
"um kind of a reporting on this project"
"but little bit talking about"
"of guns and and crisp"
"cas9 in the image editing specifically"
"so so"
"yeah so if someone is one can google up"
"or just give me a mail and"
"and uh"
"and that will be it and that's actually"
my
"own introduction"
"for the for the hybrid um"
"lab network project and now"
"we'll have our first"
actual
"actual um"
"speaker so dr iona tsur straight from"
australia
"um holds two positions one at symbiotica"
"the center of excellence in biological"
"art school of human sciences and she is"
"also the chair of the fine arts"
"discipline in the school of design at"
"the university of western australia"
"she co-established and was visiting"
"professor at biophilia in alto"
based
"base for biological arts in"
"2015 and 20"
"and so so she is actually the"
"establisher of the biophilia laboratory"
"so we're very happy to have her here"
today
"and two together with her collaborator"
"auron katz established the tissue"
"culture and art project"
"1996 as a part of their interest in life"
"more specifically the shifting relations"
"and perceptions of life in the light of"
"new knowledge and its applications"
"often working in collaboration with"
"other artists and scientists she has"
"developed a body of work that speaks"
"volumes about the need for new cultural"
"articulations of evolving concepts of"
life
"so she is considered one of the pioneers"
"in in biological arts and"
"has published and exhibited widely in"
"these areas"
"and then it says here tours ideas and"
"projects reads beyond the confines of"
"art her work is often cited as"
"inspiration to diverse areas such as new"
"materials textiles design architecture"
"ethics fiction and food but also in the"
"arts i would add to that please welcome"
jonathan
[Applause]
and
"wait i'd"
"give you this yes"
"and i need to share my screen yes wait i"
"need to okay"
"stopping into show"
"is it now yours"
"i think so let me see"
"if i can share screen"
yep
"here we go"
"excellent and let's make that small"
"oh okay"
um
"good evening everyone it's so lovely to"
"be in helsinki what"
sorry
"um i don't know why"
[Laughter]
"okay let me"
"um let me try and re-share it"
"okay share screen"
"purple slide"
"will that work"
"tell me"
"does it work now try this one then hey"
"not uh that time i know much about"
"digital but it worked so um yeah again"
"uh many thanks for laura uh for inviting"
"me to present here and i would like to"
"talk that i would like to say that i'm"
"going to the cellular level so for me"
"life starts in the cellular level"
"and i think it will be quite um"
"well we should ask what is life but"
"in a cellular level and i think it can"
"be quite interesting in the context of"
"the next speakers"
"and coming from australia i would like"
to
"say that our project"
"our artistic project and research was"
"done um on the um the land of the nuna"
"wujak people the trade traditional"
"custodian of this of australia"
"and i wish to acknowledge the strength"
"of of the continuing culture and offer"
"my respects to elders past present and"
"uh emerging"
"okay we are talking about in the spirit"
"of this um conference i would like to"
"talk about um"
the
"origin the story for regions of our"
"artistic projects and it's the time of"
"the birth of the tissue engineering"
"engineering and regenerative medicine"
"and again i would like you to understand"
"this history because it will relate also"
"for the following talk"
"um and this is the ear mouths"
"that was created or"
"was made if um you know partly created"
"by scientists the vocante brothers in"
"1995. are you familiar with this mouse"
"is it no it's the first time you've seen"
it
"okay wow um"
"at the time in 1995 this was um one of"
"the you know most amazing things that"
"people saw on the internet yeah"
"and it's basically done through a"
"technique to through a technology that"
"is called tissue engineering so"
"basically there's no genetic"
"manipulation here um i will show you how"
"it's done in a moment"
"and um"
"this is history i mean we're talking"
"almost three decades ago okay"
"so these are two slides that are taken"
"from uh the laboratory the tissue"
"engineering and organ fabrication"
"laboratory at vacantes where naron and"
"myself were research fellows over there"
"and the idea of tissue engineering and"
"organ fabrication is to create spare"
"organs in vitro in a dish in order to"
"then transplant them into bodies"
"and at the time"
"you can see there are two"
"slides here one is from uh 19819"
"again some of you probably weren't born"
"there but that's another thing history"
"the idea of repairing the body was"
"through using non-living materials such"
"as plastic such as metal if a body if an"
"organ of a body stop functioning let's"
"um create a cyborg if you want by using"
those
"kind of non-living materials"
then
"10 years later"
"the county came with the idea that"
"actually the body has um is on"
"its own regenerative"
"abilities the body is a regenerative"
"site so you can take cells from a body"
"and grow them"
"so we can actually take cells and grow"
"new organs via's non-living material and"
"this is the slide that you use so"
"basically you use this kind of"
"biodegradable material to create"
"a scaffold of an organ that you want to"
"do and then you put it in a dish and you"
"put some cells to there we use stem"
"cells why bother we differentiate your"
"cells but at the time it was you know"
"you want to create a heart take"
"muscle cardiac cell etc and then you"
"have a new organ that you can put into a"
body
"and at the time that was back in 1996"
"ron and myself said"
"why do we need"
"to create organ and then put it in the"
"body if we can grow grow something as"
"complex as an organ maybe we can leave"
"it outside of the body and i think the"
"next one"
"next slide will make it even easier so"
"if we can grow"
"now if we can grow a heart outside of a"
"body what is the function"
oops
"someone is listening to me"
"oh what is the"
"is that something that i've done"
"you see even"
"digital technologies are unpredictable"
"not just biological ones"
"shall i continue"
"yeah okay i will continue"
"so if we can create if we can actually"
"grow a heart outside of a body what is a"
"heart a heart is a pump"
yeah
"why not grow a pump instead of a heart a"
"living pump that you know we can live"
"outside of a body"
"and that was kind of a revel for us it"
"was and you're thinking why should we"
"actually grow something that looks like"
"an organ of function as an organ we can"
"grow different kind of things"
"we can grow tools but we were artists"
"and we were very concerned with the idea"
"of what does it mean to use bo you know"
"living bodies as as a raw material"
"and we thought that there's need to be a"
"cultural discussion about it first and"
"we said instead of actually creating"
"tools we would like to"
"grow art or construct and grow out and"
"grow sculptures"
"okay i have i put their warning because"
"i might show you if you are a bit"
"skimmish about"
"bodies of dead animals just close your"
"eyes for five minutes okay"
"but what happened is that's what"
"happened when we came to the lab to uh"
"work with"
"tissue culture tissue engineering in the"
"morning we got those um half heads of"
"rabbits the rabbits were slaughtered for"
"food for animals so i'll move it"
"away and"
"sorry this one as well and um what you"
"know we got those um dead heads if you"
"want and here you see myself actually"
"taking cells"
"from the eyes of this dead rabbit"
and
"what happened is that"
"the cells are not dead and over we keep"
"them outside overnight and in the"
"morning we grow them into"
three-dimensional
sculptures
"so i talked about the poverty of"
"language because we are looking at"
"living cells that came from a dead body"
"a body that was dead for more than you"
"know for overnight"
"are those what kind of life is that and"
"this is the question we have that we"
"talk about about the poverty of language"
"we have one word that we refer to all"
"living things"
"or you know even non-living"
"artificial life what is this world it's"
"such a complex phenomena and we use only"
"one word to say that there's no"
"subtleties there are no other ways to"
"talk about it so for us we said this is"
"not really living it is it's a"
semi-limit
"and we use the word semi-living which"
"means actually taking parts tissues from"
"organisms and growing them in an"
"artificial environment"
okay
"and here you know we have an ear but"
"again instead um of using a mouse as a"
"body we are using different kind of"
"techno-scientific bodies you will see as"
"i talk"
"so we started by having those are"
"growing those sculptures they are"
"growing over um"
"glass figurine and at the time"
"you know history we're talking around"
"1997 no one thought that you can take"
"actually those living um"
"sculptures of semi-living sculpture to"
"the gallery so uh we created those"
"images and um"
"that's what we presented in galleries"
um
"it took us okay"
"i'll go back to that"
"then it took us"
"a few years to get invited into um arse"
"electronica which is a festival that for"
"the first time we could have actually"
shown
"living semi-living sculptures in a"
"gallery so people like you can come and"
see
"life in a gallery not just a"
representation
"what was the problem"
"we needed to create a whole laboratory"
"in order to present those kind of"
"sculptures we needed the whole the whole"
um
"if you want a"
"theater of of science in order to create"
"those sculptures"
"because what you what you need to"
"understand that cells taken out of a"
"body cannot needs what's called need a"
"technological support system that we"
"call technoscientific body which can be"
"anything from a petri dish that inside a"
"incubator that imitates bodies"
"to what is called a bioreactor so this"
"is you see we have to create the whole"
"gallery so we can actually"
"maintain those um living cells and here"
"they are the living um the semi-wary"
"dolls some are living wary dolls groin"
"tiny tiny inside those i'll have to come"
"here inside those vessels of bioreactor"
"okay what happens here is that they get"
"the food that they need"
"they are in sterile condition because if"
"you expose them to the environment"
"they'll die"
"and it's all heated um to 37 degrees"
"like our own bodies and rotating to"
"create this uh three dimensions aspects"
"of it"
"so what i'm trying to say here that"
"those kind of of new entities that we're"
"talking about"
"needs the support mechanism need their"
"environment need a new body which we"
"call techno-scientific body"
"but they're alive the same are living"
"now people looked at it and they think"
"oh they have to believe us that they're"
alive
"how do we make people understand"
"that they have agency"
"you know that they are living the way"
"that we understand life"
"and this is again very related to the"
"next talk that you will see how do we"
associate
"what is the thing that makes us"
"feel the affinity for other things as"
"they are living"
movement
"automata think about those kind of"
"things so what we try to do"
"back in 2003 is to create um"
"sculpture that can move"
"and by that people will realize they are"
"actually living"
"uh we tried to you know uh create if you"
"look at it in a more utilitarian well"
"muscle actuator using muscle cells that"
"you can see here but for us as attitude"
"it was more about the movement and"
"people relating to this new kind of life"
semi-living
"it went really bad and you'll see much"
"better examples of movement of cells"
"muscle cells in the next talk"
"but let's get away from the symbolic"
"ideas i want to move now into what we"
"call the"
pseudo-utilitarian
"semi-living sculpture that we made and"
"this was back in the year 2000"
"okay another question"
"how many of you know about in vitro meat"
oh
okay
"that got up okay"
"inv so in vitro meat is about tissue"
"engineering again"
"now back in the year 2000 and in vitro"
"meat if for those who don't know it's"
"the idea that"
"instead of eating the animal we will"
take
"again cells from the animal and grow"
"them in a techno-scientific body"
"create the condition that need in order"
"to create this myth yeah"
"how many people ate in vitro meat"
okay
so
"the aesthetic of disappointment will"
"come but that's that's something else"
"in the year 2000"
"at the candy lab again the person who"
"made the ear with the with the ear mouth"
"we were two artists very hungry"
"not much"
"not a lot of funding"
and
"a lot of"
"muscle cell at the time scientists did"
"the procedure in utero in a"
ship
"to fix"
"embryo while it's in its mother womb and"
"by that she took some stem cells and"
"stem cells grow really really fast and"
"the whole incubators were filled with"
"um you know"
"sheep or"
"sheep um stem cells and she asked us do"
"something with it because i can't throw"
"it away"
"and what we thought oh you know we can"
"actually grow steak out of it"
"and the idea is that this take"
"not only"
"that it's you know it will come from an"
"animal that was never born"
"and for us an artist that was a complex"
"idea how do you deal with something like"
that
"so we immediately uh went for the job"
"and this is the first take that we grew"
"back in 2000 then in 2003"
"we were invited to france to grow the"
"stake and um in exhibition that we"
"called this embodied cuisine"
"it was wonderful we had to study for"
"three months to feed ourselves in order"
"to end up in a extreme level cuisine"
"where us together with"
"six volunteers"
"tasted for the first time"
"in vitro meat"
"again it"
"i would like to say that this in vitro"
"meat is still using um animal deriving"
ingredients
"and it's far from being perfect but we"
"will go into that what's nice about it"
"that it sells you a beautiful narrative"
"of being able to eat animals without"
"killing them"
"we'll go to that"
"okay so"
uh
"how many of you i want to go back to"
"automation because the more we work with"
"those kind of"
"technologies and in general both"
"biological technologies and digital"
"technologies we are moving more towards"
"automation for automation for good and"
"for worse yeah"
"and i have here an interesting story how"
"many of you know how ford actually came"
"with the idea of the assembly line to"
"create this is the most is the motor"
cars
"he went to an arbiter"
"and he saw actually how"
"the systematic way of taking a whole"
animal
"and breaking it into parts"
"in order to create the meat"
"in order to create meat that is then"
"sellable for people to eat"
"and you realize that"
"it can do the same but"
"to the other way around"
"so if we need to break things apart in"
"order to put them together"
"oh okay if we have animal we break them"
apart
"but we can take parts of cars and put"
"them together using assembly line okay"
"and that's exactly what he did"
"and you can see it here"
"using the same uh"
"oh the the reverse ideology that started"
"you know the idea of automation and"
"assembly line as we know"
"today so just to make it a bit clearer"
"if you want"
nature
"food but animal is happy"
"moving toward ford the idea of you know"
"automation and assembly line we also"
"adding um some kind of technology here"
"but that's still i see your faces it's a"
"bit disturbing yeah"
"something is wrong here yeah"
aha
"this is the future"
"let's even fragment the animals more"
"into cells"
"and we create not only creating a real"
"good meat we're engineering a natural"
"and innovative process to grow meat for"
"the world"
"this is a new nature"
"yeah something doesn't work here"
"let's continue"
"so what we're saying is that the"
"automated techno-scientific bodies are"
technologies
"which seek"
"to mitigate environmental irregularities"
"through various degrees of abstraction"
"so in order to create automation you"
"need to"
"get rid"
"of the complexities of a gentile"
creatures
"unruly creatures and make them into"
"pieces that are um you know predictable"
"and regular"
"and uh um and i'm almost finished here"
"what's the time but this is the recent"
"exhibition that we did which is called"
poetically
"sunlight soil and"
"this cycle um because these are the"
"three things"
that
"in the industry of in the arctic in the"
"food production industry these are the"
"things that all the technologies are"
"trying to get rid of"
"because the irregulars they don't follow"
"a predictable patterns and they cannot"
"be automated"
"so sunlight soil and sheet are the three"
"elements of our technological utopian"
"future farming"
"a technological utopian future farming"
"is trying to live without"
"agtech aims to automate and control food"
"production while"
"non-standardized elements such as"
"sunlight soil and sheet are removed from"
"in favor of artificial light substrate"
"and fertilizer"
"and you can see here you know we try to"
"grow plants we no need to sunlight i"
"mean there's a lot of sunlight in"
"australia where i live but we put them"
"inside so we can control it"
"we also grew in vitro meat in"
"a compost incubator that i'll talk more"
about
"in a couple of days in another"
conference
"and um you know to um"
"try to um"
"we had also a control room where all the"
"data from all those uh fragmented life"
"um put together and we could look at the"
"data and we didn't even and you know the"
"data will give us all the information"
"that we wanted to the point that we"
"didn't even had to look at the plants"
"themselves the data would tell us"
"whether they're thirsty"
"etc need feed food also etc"
"okay i'm going to finish with few slides"
"that hopefully will create a debate late"
"or debate we'll create a conv nice"
"friendly um"
"yeah respectful conversation"
"so um i have a question"
"you know i have a observation or we have"
"an observation that human desire for"
"utopian existence we have this desire"
"you know technologically mediated"
"utopia in which all our products will be"
"abundant and produced without exploit of"
"resources and their uneasy consequences"
"because even in vitro meat uses a lot of"
resources
"and not coming from non-standardized"
"living agents who possesses the capacity"
"of agency and resistance"
"another thing with automation is that we"
"create those machines"
"that do things for us but what ends up"
"is that we are servicing them and to the"
"point today that all of us"
"are performing to our automated machine"
"just think about that i mean i have this"
"bloody thing that makes me uh perform so"
"it will be happy"
"um and you see here around as part of"
"our exhibition making fertilizer out of"
um
"bodies that have been"
"created for food manufacturing but you"
"can you don't waste them you can"
"actually create fertilizer out of them"
"but he spent hours just trying to make"
"this machine works"
"i think lara we talk about maintenance"
"art and we can talk about that later on"
"the other question that i have is can we"
"make life unruly"
"can we you know the more we cut it and"
"chop it apart into small fragments"
"will we make be able to make it"
"standardized in order to automate it and"
"you have control over it"
"or what we refer to is there a secular"
"vitalism there is something about living"
matter
"that resists"
control
"and this is a contamination that happens"
"a lot when you work with living material"
"all scientists will tell you it will"
"happen eventually life resists"
"and the last question that uh not"
"question but the observation that we"
"want to"
"put is that our psycho pathologies of"
"control all of us"
"why do we make dry hard and digital"
"technologies that we constructed from"
"scratch to become lifelike we kind of"
"releasing control over them and just"
"think for example about artificial"
"intelligence that we have no idea once"
"we press the"
"processing button we let it have its own"
"why we're taking things that we haven't"
"constructed we haven't made"
"and they are very complex independent"
"moist messy and really life"
and
"we try to control them"
"and i think i'll finish with this thank"
"you very much"
[Applause]
"am i staying for questions yeah"
yes
"um you're saying for questions"
"so i'm taking the questions from the"
"internet but there is no question yet"
"anybody here"
"oh my gosh"
"i always have a question is it my speech"
"impediment no i'm just"
"i was just looking i of course know your"
"works from a long time and you mentioned"
"just uh briefly the idea of environment"
somehow
"in that and and a lot of the work is"
"anyway like you say it needs a sterile"
"uh environment and so on so so"
"and then you have this soil and"
"thing which is a little bit different so"
"i just want what's your take"
"on the"
"meaning of environment or has it changed"
"also throughout your career the idea"
"yes okay so um"
"one of the things you know i have a we"
"have a whole talk about actually how"
"you have to look even dna or cells"
"we have to look at it in context of the"
environment
"yeah and the environment can be a"
"sterile environment it can be a"
"constructed technological environment or"
"it can be soil and sheet environment"
but
"you you know we tend to"
um
"forget the environment so you know we"
"talk about um"
"we call it a you know um"
"a genotype or dna hype or dna chauvinism"
"even in a way that we tend to look at"
"those kind of things without looking"
"at where they are growing yet life i"
"think there is a context a a quarter"
"that says that the opposite of life is"
"to be indifferent to the environment"
"around it"
so
"everything that i'm talking here all the"
"cells that grew"
"they were part of an environment whether"
"again it's a constructed environment of"
"techno-scientific body or it's in um"
"soils and what i can tell you that"
"sheet and soul is a much more complex"
environment
"than um the petri dish or the you know"
"the the bioreactor that you you saw over"
"there another thing that i can tell you"
"that these kind of cells have evolved"
over
"many many years"
to
"developing those kind of environment and"
"once we transfer them to a new"
"artificial environment they behave very"
"very differently"
um
"and um"
"those environment are a"
"a very complicated a very limited in the"
"sense of um"
"if you want you know"
"they are closed system they're not"
"evolving as such"
"what will happen that most of the in"
vitro
"environment will eventually um get"
"contaminated and then the"
"scientists usually get rid of them i"
"don't know what happened when you have a"
"whole bioreactor with one bacteria"
"coming in it's a big problem and then"
"you have to put antibiotics"
um
"again the the other things that i'm"
asking
"you take already an organism that is so"
"complex in such a complex environment"
"and of course you can take beats and try"
"to sustain them for some time in an um"
"artificial environment"
"but then it's very hard to take them out"
"of that environment"
"so they are dependent on that"
"environment but you can say that we all"
"in a way already"
"living in a techno-scientific"
"environment techno-scientific body"
"that it will be left i don't know about"
"you but i can tell about myself if i'll"
"be left suddenly you know in the"
"bush or here in the forest"
"without my technological support"
"mechanisms i am i still have a chance to"
"live but i'm not sure"
"how long"
"but if you'll transport me to space"
"without my technological support"
"mechanism i will not survive and that's"
"what happened when you take cells from a"
"body and put them in vitro"
"you kind of transfer them into space"
"make sense"
"yeah okay"
"any other questions"
yeah
"uh you mentioned about um"
"animal resources that you're"
"you're using for the in vitro meat but"
"have you taken any other approaches like"
"pluripotent cells or things like that"
"so um"
listen
"you can"
"you can order cells online there is if"
"you yeah you can go and um order cells"
"online so they come in a very abstract"
"forms you know in a little vial so it's"
"not bloody it's that you don't see all"
"the soul and all that you see"
"but these cells still came from"
"somewhere cells don't come we we talked"
"about the fact that cells i think the"
"whole idea is now that life comes from"
"life yeah it's not coming from"
"non-living so they still come from some"
"sorts of life"
"um so there was an animal there"
"somewhere yeah that um"
"well in the scientific time we'll say"
"sacrifice her life"
"for you i don't know if willingly or not"
"but um"
again
"we also have a we"
scientists
"also created this technology of immortal"
"cells immortal cell line so you can make"
"those cells to basically divide forever"
"which is basically what cancer is all"
about
"um so"
"um that's you know you still need those"
"kind of life now another thing that you"
"have with in vitro meat is that"
"muscle cells especially do"
"thrive much better on um serum which is"
"coming from animal blood i think that"
"there's a lot of research to try and uh"
"create a"
"artificial serum again that you don't"
"need to rely on"
"blood of animals"
again
"this is all in the way to this kind of"
"um technologically mediated utopia that"
"we will have this meat that we desire so"
"much without the consequences that"
"involve with that without the resources"
"i mean what do you think in the lab"
"we're using so many resources so much"
"plastic wear is being thrown out the"
"lights everything it's you know"
"sometimes as an artist i feel that it's"
"really important to get people into the"
"lab to understand it's not a magical"
"place it's a place that"
"a lot of waste is happening a lot of"
boredom
"and a lot of failures as well"
so
"again it's part of this idea of um"
"of creating this utopia which you know"
"another solution is just to consume less"
meat
"but that's not something that yeah many"
"people are happy about definitely not"
businesses
"so there is a question in the chat"
"thank you so much for your fascinating"
talk
"what do you think about the possible"
"future protein substitutes from"
"microbial organisms"
"for instance yeast in relation to"
"artificial meat"
projects
"products i think"
um
"yeast yeah come on beer i'm saying only"
"yeast is is one of the the you know"
"of course we can use it i i don't really"
"understand what is the"
"the question i mean many people decide"
to
"go to plant-based"
"diet and that's fine"
um
"is the question"
[Laughter]
sorry
"substitute yes"
um
"yeah it's really funny because you know"
"all those question is how can we create"
"more technologies to create more food i"
"mean we have food"
"you know that's the interesting thing"
"about humans and and i'm i'm part of it"
"i mean i'm i'm implicated i'm in the lab"
"and for me it was important uh for you"
"to see"
"that yeah i took the cells from this"
"animal you know i'm implicated in all"
"those kind of things"
"but again"
"you see us psychopathology um"
"can we we're now looking for more"
"technologies to create food"
"that will be more sustainable or or you"
"know but through technological approach"
"approaches it's it's you know"
"um we have a problem of this"
"distribution of food we have many of the"
but
humans
"knew how to feed themselves for a very"
"long time that's not the problem"
"thank you"
"it's great to have you here and i'm"
"after your uh 30 years at least of"
experimenting
"these issues"
"i'm wondering ethically where"
"what has been your evolution"
"because um"
"it's not it's not easy it's not an easy"
task
"and as you say you are"
"kind of curious as an artist"
"and you really want to to kind of put"
"certain issues out there"
"but how"
"how are you now and i think that these"
"psychopathologies of control is a good"
yeah
"so um"
"i'm a human i'm not a machine so i'm"
"irrational and not efficient and"
"contradictory and unruly um"
"okay when we started back in 1996"
"we came with this kind of um um"
"you know i think naivety which is lovely"
"yeah sometimes you miss this navity that"
um
"through you know through those kind of"
"technology we can really create a better"
world
"or on my partner he came from a product"
"design perspective and he you know the"
"thesis that he wrote is about"
"growing constructing objects or or you"
"know um if you want even he talked about"
"a chair that is tissue engineered that"
"in a way"
"it will be sustainable and also we'll"
"have more kind of uh emotional"
"connection to it like like you know kind"
"of a a guard a a pet or a plant so we"
"won't throw it away you know"
"um of course"
"this is"
"not possible uh technically"
"also you know"
"with all good intention imagine this"
"chair then give you all sorts of other"
"diseases etc so there's always you know"
"technology is not good or bad technology"
"can go to many um places but the more"
"we're very and and i think the"
"fascination there is a really strong"
"fascination with you know what is i mean"
"real life what is life and i believe"
"that the next speakers you know also a"
"lot of their fascination is to"
"understand uh what is life"
and
"there is something really"
"uneasy but also quite interesting"
"working with living material and then"
"you know and and facing all the failures"
"that the more you try to make it do what"
"you want"
"it will resist yeah and at the beginning"
"you are frustrated then you say oh this"
"is the you know"
"the the the whole thing"
um
"so we went from this naivety to a more"
"kind of um i would say a"
[Music]
"realization that um"
"well i don't want to say that the world"
"is but let's put it this way"
"because also not so much with what is"
"happening in the lab okay oh i have a"
"better answer it was brewing there so we"
"did uh you know victimized leader and um"
"victimless take"
"as a critique as as a joke if you want"
"you know and a victimist leader died"
"spectacularly at the moma you know it"
"didn't work and we said yeah this is"
"exactly what we want to show you know"
"that technology not always working the"
"stake the in vitro state that we created"
"that we"
"grew people threw out and we said this"
"is lovely we don't have to swallow every"
"technology that is being given to us"
"and then"
"a decade two decades later"
"it's you know companies are doing that"
"and coming with those fantasies and"
"completely not uh critical about it"
"and suddenly you realize that you know"
uh
"maybe the raw"
"now we're more thinking about what is"
"the role of the artist and the critical"
artists
"and what can we do in order to still be"
"in the lab and be among our you know"
"colleagues artists scientists etc"
"but be able to"
"get those complexities and those cycle"
"pathologies outside"
and
"make people understand when they look at"
"those um websites of all the um"
"companies that promise those kind of"
"technological utopians to be a bit more"
"savvy and a bit more um cautious and and"
understand
"that a lot of it is pure fantasy"
yeah
thanks
"no burning questions so"
"no so then"
okay
"there's a wish for five minute break"
"and then we go to another so go to"
"toilet if you have to or whatever"
"have a have a chat with your neighbor"
"all right"
"i think we're gonna continue"
"um some people are still running around"
"here but uh"
"i think that doesn't"
matter
so
"our next speaker"
"uh couple here trust bernard and michael"
levin
"and they are online as we see them"
"already there"
"just being art is a why not prof"
"excuse me if i'm pronouncing wrong stuff"
so
"vinod maybe professor of computer"
"science at the university of vermont and"
"director of the morphology evolution and"
"cognition laboratory which sounds to me"
"absolutely fantastic"
"his work involves soft evolved and"
"crowd-sourced robots as well as"
"computer-designed organisms he is a"
"co-author of the book how the body"
"shapes the way we think"
"the instructor of a ready-based"
"evolutionary robotics mooc and director"
"of the robotics outreach program"
"twitch blaze robotics"
"and then michael michael leaving"
"is one of our most distinguished"
"professor of biology and director of the"
"allen discovery center at tufts"
university
"his work involves using developmental"
"biophysics and computer science to"
"understand the action of cell groups as"
"a collective intelligence"
"applications of his lab's work have"
"extended to the repair of birth defects"
"induction of regeneration cancer"
"reprogramming and the creation of novel"
"synthetic living proto-organisms"
"and i want to welcome both of them and"
"the title"
"of the talk which is will be um"
"on oxenobots is the innate creativity of"
"ai and of life"
"so please"
welcome
"thank you very much laura um"
"my name is josh baumgardt and thanks for"
"inviting myself and mike levin uh we've"
"decided to tag team this this discussion"
"so i'll start off and then uh in about"
"15 minutes from now i'll hand over the"
"baton to uh to mike"
"um so again thanks to lauren thanks to"
"the organizers for this event thanks to"
"all of you for attending this evening"
"my apologies that i couldn't be there in"
person
"as laura mentioned i wanted to start by"
"talking about the innate creativity of"
"ai in particular i'm an ai researcher a"
"computer scientist and a roboticist so"
"as eonat just pointed out in the"
"previous uh talk there are sort of three"
"players at work in"
uh
"at the intersection of art and"
technology
"there are us humans that create things"
"there is technology the created thing"
"and there is uh life and and it seems"
"that that's the theme this evening is"
"the interactions or the changing ways in"
"which humans and living systems and"
"technology interact so i want to focus"
"in uh in the on these 15 minutes on the"
"ai side"
"and just give you a sense of what ai is"
"currently capable of what it's currently"
"not capable of and what it may be"
"capable of in the years to come and i"
"think again that addresses an important"
"point that the previous speaker just"
"made is trying to separate uh the hype"
"from reality and and really think"
"through collectively as a society where"
"we want to go with art and technology"
"so to start my part of the talk i"
"thought i'd start with libraries i know"
"you were all physically present in a"
"physical library this is another"
"physical library the trinity college uh"
"in dublin but i wanted to talk actually"
about
"an imaginary library the uh library of"
"babel some of you may know that term uh"
"it's the title of a short story by the"
"argentinian short story writer"
"jorge luis borges"
"and like many of his short stories the"
"library of babel was kind of a thought"
"experiment he invites the reader to"
"imagine a library"
"stocked not just with"
"all of the books that have currently"
"been written but all of the books that"
"could possibly be written the space of"
"all possible books as you can imagine"
"this is a very large"
"library and so this idea of all possible"
"books or all possible things that humans"
"and now humans and ai might create"
"together is what i want to try and focus"
on
"i think that's one thing that artists"
"and scientists and engineers share is an"
"attempt to"
"leave behind the known and the obvious"
"and push as far as we can out into"
"what's possible the space of possible"
"things possible ideas"
"engineers scientists and ai and artists"
"all try and push into the space of the"
"possible in different"
ways
"so uh i want to try and focus or"
"structure our thoughts about the space"
"of the possible by using this metaphor"
"created by borges of the library of"
babel
"there are many possible libraries of"
"babel here's a pretty small one"
"i want you to imagine a library that"
"contains all books that are one english"
"character long and we'll just assume"
"lowercase letters to start with it's a"
"pretty small library there's only 26"
"books in it"
"you can imagine another library of babel"
"which contains all possible books that"
"are two characters long"
"it's still pretty small but it's growing"
"pretty quickly"
"one of the one of the ways of"
"approaching these spaces of the possible"
"as a as a mathematician or a computer"
"scientist is we can actually enumerate"
"or count all the possible things in that"
"space in this library of babel there are"
676
"possible books"
"you can go to the website called library"
"of babel and"
"that website"
"quote unquote contains all books that"
"are 410 pages long"
"every page contains uh contains 40 rows"
"and each row contains 80 characters as"
"you see here if you imagine this the"
"library of babel that corresponds to"
"this possible set of all possible books"
"it is a very very large uh space"
"and as you can immediately see if you"
"start to visit random pages in this"
"website that the vast vast majority of"
"books in any library of babel are"
"nonsense they're not interesting they're"
"not creative they're not engaging"
"they're not of interest to humans in any"
way
"so the job of the artist and the job of"
"job of a scientist or the job of the ai"
"is to move through the space of the"
"possible and ignore the 99.999"
"of the junk or uninteresting stuff"
"that's out there and liberate and find"
"and bring back for other humans to"
consider
"those uh what you call in english the"
"needle in the haystack the very very"
"rare exemplars of interesting things"
"in this particular library of babel"
"here's another book that exists in that"
"library which is the first 410 pages of"
"moby dick by herman melville"
"another book that exists in this library"
"is this one"
"and i will"
"alternate back and forth between these"
"two slides hopefully you can see what"
"separates these two books in the library"
"of babel which is a difference in a"
"single character"
"and what's important about that is when"
"we think about the space of all possible"
"things if we can quantify or enumerate"
"them we can also measure the distance"
"between any two items in that"
"library in this case there is a very"
"small distance between these two books"
"and a very large distance between these"
"two books"
okay
"so uh again thinking about these"
"libraries um"
"it is dif it is difficult or impossible"
"for the human imagination to grasp how"
"big these libraries or these spaces of"
"the possible actually is"
"in the case of this particular library"
"you can actually write down the number"
"of how many books there are there are 28"
"to the 80 times 40 times 410 books in"
"this library"
"for comparison there are 10 to the 28"
"atoms in the known universe which is a"
"vanishingly small number in comparison"
"what i'm going to show you in a moment"
"is how mike and i designed an ai to"
"search the space of all possible"
"organisms which is similarly a large"
"space how can we possibly task"
"technology in this case ai with"
"exploring these vast spaces and bringing"
"back the very very small examples of"
"things that are interesting"
"so uh we'll leave books behind now and"
"move on to uh life or living systems um"
"you most of you have probably seen this"
"image before a version of it this is a"
"way to try and uh represent the"
"relationships between most or all"
"living systems on the planet"
"all species that currently exist on the"
"shell of this tree or on the twigs of"
"this tree and as we move inward towards"
"the root we're exploring"
"all possible all organisms that have"
"previously existed and of course this"
"space or library itself is already huge"
"but again it is the space of only those"
"organisms that do exist or have existed"
"if we again combine this metaphor of the"
"library of babel with all existing and"
"all existing species and those that have"
"existed it turns out that if you"
"represent each species as a point in a"
"mathematical space"
"it is a very sparsely populated space"
"these are"
"islands uh in in this vast space"
"and the vast majority of all possible"
"organisms organisms that could exist and"
"survive on this planet have not yet been"
"explored uh by mother nature"
"so the project that mike and i uh are"
"working on and have worked on now for a"
"few years which i'll introduce you to in"
"a moment"
"instead of us tinkering manually with"
"living systems to see what we can make"
"we're going to turn over the task of"
"of navigating through the space of all"
"possible living systems to an ai and"
"we're going to give that ai instructions"
"about how we want it to move through"
"that space"
"um as the years progress and ai improves"
"and bio fabrication facilities improve"
"it's going to get easier and easier for"
"ai to find more and more interesting"
"exemplars of living systems that have"
"form and function different from any"
"that have existed on earth before and"
"perhaps in the q a session we can talk"
"about the implications of that"
"uh so"
"two years ago now mike and i and our two"
"colleagues sam kriegman and doug"
"blackiston reported the very first"
"example of an ai"
"generated organism and i'll tell you a"
"little bit about how that organism was"
made
"at that time"
"mike and doug explained to us that"
"they can rearrange living tissue taken"
"from a particular frog this is xenopus"
lavis
"doug blackiston is a microsurgeon he's"
"very talented at rearranging living"
"tissue under the microscope"
"at that time doug informed us that he"
"could work with frog skin stem cells and"
"frog heart muscle cells or tissue that"
"you see here"
"and as ai researchers we then took those"
"two cell types and we viewed them as a"
"type of lego brick two different kinds"
"of lego bricks or building blocks that"
"could be used by the ai designer or the"
"ai artist the ai was free to try and"
"combine these two parts together in"
"arbitrary ways to explore the library of"
babel
"of all possible tissue rearrangements of"
"frog skin and frog heart muscle tissue"
"what you're going to see in this video"
is
"the ai's first attempt to put these"
"pieces together"
"uh you'll notice that it's building them"
"up using uh it's using using these very"
"small building blocks again where now we"
"have the blue cubes represent skin"
"tissue there you can notice in"
"especially in the top panel that these"
"cubes are being pulled and pushed"
"passively by the red green voxels"
"the red green voxels are meant to"
"represent heart muscle tissue which will"
"increase and decrease in volume and the"
"previous speaker just talked about"
"hearts and pumps which is perfect"
"if you put frog heart tissue together in"
"the shape of a frog heart those cells"
"will talk to one another and figure out"
"how to"
"to synchronize and push blood out of the"
"heart and expand to pull blood into the"
heart
"doug told us that if you rearrange heart"
"muscle tissue doug wasn't sure about the"
"resulting biology would those heart"
"cells synchronize or not"
"since we don't know we made things hard"
"on the ai we told the ai basically that"
"these things wouldn't synchronize so"
"we've actually made the job uh very"
"difficult for the ai which is to try and"
"build a living machine that does"
"something out of unreliable parts or at"
"least parts that don't synchronize"
"i mentioned that we asked the ai to"
"build a machine for us so there's two"
"things that we supply to this ai we"
"describe the building blocks to it which"
"i've already told you about"
"then we tell the ai what we want we"
"wanted to make a machine that does"
"something useful for human beings"
"in this very first experiment the task"
"that these machines should perform is"
"very simple which is to move from the"
"left side of the screen to the right"
"side of the screen"
"the computer starts by creating a"
"hundred random machines here you see"
"three of those 100 machines the ai goes"
"through and watches each of these 100"
"simulated machines and it deletes the"
"ones that do a poor job at whatever we"
"want these machines to do which in this"
"case is move from left to right and it"
"makes randomly modified copies of the"
"surviving machines that happen to move a"
"little bit further to the right and if"
"you repeat this process over and over"
again
"in this particular experiment we got the"
following
"machine which you'll notice it's got"
"unreliable parts but it is reliably"
"moving in a more or less straight line"
"from the left side of the screen to the"
"right side of the screen"
"i've described the ai to you which is"
"basically an algorithm written in code"
"and you probably have guessed what kind"
"of algorithm this is this is an"
"evolutionary algorithm like nature it is"
"performing a trial and error process"
"where it deletes poorly performing"
"machines or systems and makes randomly"
"modified copies of surviving systems"
"and evolution either outside the"
"computer or inside the computer is"
"extremely powerful and very creative it"
"can come up with non-obvious solutions"
"like the one that you see here it can"
"overcome difficulties and constraints"
"like trying to build a reliable machine"
"out of semi-reliable"
parts
"this is just the first part of this"
"first experiment"
"as you can see here this is all virtual"
"it all took place inside a supercomputer"
"here in vermont in the northeastern"
"united states"
"at the end of this two-week period the"
"supercomputer spat out this particular"
"design we sent it to mike and doug at"
"tufts and we're now going to look down"
"through the microscope"
"we're going to look down through the"
"microscope with doug our micro surgeon"
"who's going to reach in with micro"
"surgical tools"
"he has liberated skin and heart muscle"
"tissue from embryonic frogs and re"
"uh re-aggregated those cells into a ball"
"of cells and he is now gradually"
"scraping away or sculpting a shape to"
"match the blue the ai generated"
"blueprint lots of interesting aspects to"
"how doug actually builds this ai design"
"blueprint i don't have time to talk"
"about that today"
"at the end of this micro surgical"
"procedure doug takes that upside down"
"xenobots and puts it right side up"
"on the bottom of a petri dish and what"
"you get is a xeno a physical xenobot"
"xeno for xenopus lavis and bot for robot"
"that reliably walks along the bottom of"
"the petri dish in the way that the ai"
"predicted that it would and this is"
"arguably the world's first computer"
designed
organism
"since that time we've moved on from"
"walking xenobots to swimming xenobots"
"this was a reported in the literature"
"last year this is a xenobot that's using"
"very small hairs on its outer surface"
"called cilia that it uses to beat"
"against the liquid medium and"
"propel itself through room temperature"
"fresh water"
"and then at the end of last year we"
"introduced the third paper in this"
"series so far"
"what you're watching is a swimming"
"xenobot this large dark mass here if you"
"sprinkle the petri dish with dissociated"
"frog skin cells"
"this particularly shaped xenobot will"
"end up pushing those cells together into"
"a mass those cells are sticky they will"
"end up sticking to one another and after"
"a few hours they will if this pile is"
"large enough they will grow these small"
"cilia these small hairs on their outer"
"surface and left to its own devices this"
"pile will eventually start moving on its"
own
"if you sprinkle fresh cells into the"
"dish you will make another pile which"
"continues moving and you have a parent"
"xenobot making a child xenobot making a"
"grandchild xenobot and you have"
"self-replicating xenobots"
"that's just a taste i think of the"
"creative potential of ai of what's"
"currently possible and what's to come"
and
"i will now turn over the floor to mike"
"to continue the uh conversation"
"well thank you so much uh that's uh"
"that's an excellent introduction um"
"all the key uh kind of topics are"
"covered so what i'm going to do"
"is uh bring in some biology and thank"
"you um thank you for"
"uh giving me the opportunity to share"
"some uh some thoughts with you um you"
"can you can reach um"
"reach me here if you have questions"
"later on um this uh this of course uh is"
"alan turing uh everybody knows that uh"
"he was kind of one of the forefathers of"
"thinking about intelligence creativity"
"these kinds of things in novel uh"
"embodiments so so not human but other"
"kinds of embodiments but one of the"
"things that is perhaps less known is"
"that he was also interested in"
"morphogenesis the generation of shape"
"the spontaneous generation of shape in"
"living living tissues and it's kind of"
"interesting to think about why the same"
"person would be interested in these two"
"topics and i think he saw very clearly"
"that there's a truly fundamental"
connection
"and the connection is that we are all"
"collective intelligence is made of cells"
"this is uh this is one cell here it has"
"no brain it has no nervous system it's"
"called a lacrimaria"
"you can see the amazing competency that"
"it has at handling its own local local"
"goals morphological physiological and so"
"on and the remarkable thing about is"
"that all of us make the journey from"
"something that some people call just"
"physics so an unfertilized oocyte which"
"is just basically a collection of of"
"inert chemicals and then uh that there's"
"a there's a remarkable process of"
"embryogenesis in which individual cells"
"uh precursors of things like this work"
"together on very large scale goals so so"
"building a um"
"a complex organ like this or perhaps a"
"human that's going to then have human"
"level cognition um second order kinds of"
"thoughts about what it is and why it is"
"or isn't a machine and those kinds of"
"things so we all take this journey from"
"from a from a bag of inner chemicals uh"
"to a highly sentient complex organism"
"and so so that that process that"
"converts physics into mind is is one of"
"the most you know beautiful and"
"mysterious things in in science"
"and uh the uh the amazing thing about"
"embryonic development is that it shows"
"intelligence long before it creates an"
"actual animal that can show behavioral"
"intelligence and let me let me share"
"with you some some examples of this uh"
"development of course is extremely"
"reliable so so with with very few"
"exceptions eggs give rise to whatever it"
"is that they're supposed to give rise to"
"but um we can we can notice some"
"interesting things first of all you can"
"take a an early embryo of many species"
"including humans"
"uh cut it in half and what you get are"
"not two half embryos which is what would"
"happen if you cut any of our kind of"
"technology in half but you get two"
"perfectly normal monozygotic twins and"
"this is because each side will realize"
"that the other side is missing and"
"restore everything that it needs and you"
"get two perfectly normal human bodies"
"and so development has this uh and and"
"morphogenesis in general has this"
"ability to get to a goal state in some"
"particular space which which josh just"
"introduced uh from a variety of starting"
"conditions despite a variety of"
"perturbations along the way various"
"local local minima that might be um"
"trying to uh sort of trap that process"
"here's here's another example this is"
"something that we discovered these are"
"these are tadpoles of the frog xenopus"
"lavish here's a brain here the eyes here"
"are the nostrils this is the gut and"
"these temples reliably turn into frogs"
"so all the craniofacial features have to"
"move and rearrange so the eyes have to"
"move forward the jaws have to move and"
"so on well it turns out that this is not"
"a hardwired process because if you make"
"these what we call picasso tadpoles so"
"basically you put the organs in the"
"wrong place so the eyes on the back of"
"the head the mouth is off to the side"
"everything is scrambled they still make"
"uh quite normal frogs because all of"
"these pieces will go in novel"
"paths relative to each other in fact"
"sometimes they go too far and they have"
"to come back to give you the correct"
"proper frog face and then they stop so"
"what the genetics actually specifies is"
"a system that can minimize error and get"
"to a correct face despite"
"incorrect starting positions"
perturbations
"and uh"
"so so of course this raises the"
"important question how does it know what"
"a correct face looks like how does it"
"know which region in that face it should"
"be navigating towards and i'm going to"
"talk about that in a couple of minutes"
"with respect to a kind of bioelectric"
"pattern memory but uh this this this"
"ability of tissues to to create what uh"
"what what what"
"is going to be an adaptive anatomy goes"
"goes further than than simple remodeling"
"like this this is a this is an example"
"of um uh in just an amazing"
"metamorphosis so this is a caterpillar"
"so these have brains that are suitable"
"for driving this kind of thing that"
"crawls in two dimensions and it chews"
"leaves but it has to turn into this"
"which is a creature that flies"
"navigating three dimensions and it"
"drinks nectar completely different"
"behavioral repertoire"
"so during this uh during this"
"time of remodeling"
"the brain is basically liquefied most of"
"the connections are broken down most of"
"the cells are killed off and yet the"
"memories remain so it's been shown now"
"that if you train a caterpillar the"
"butterflies and moths remember the"
"original information so you can think"
"about a very kind of a"
"basic philosophical problem on steroids"
"which is never mind what it's like to be"
"a caterpillar or a butterfly what's it"
"like to be a caterpillar turning into a"
"butterfly right to be an agent"
"that whose"
"cognitive substrate is being actively"
"remodeled during the lifetime of that"
"agent um in fact we can make novel"
"configurations that are uh that are"
"completely adaptive so so this is again"
"as a tackle you will notice that instead"
"of the eyes here it has an eye on its"
tail
"and what we found is that even though"
"this brain evolved for millions of years"
"to expect visual input from exactly"
"these locations if you put an eye on its"
"tail no problem the eye the eye forms"
"even though it's next to muscle instead"
"of brain it makes an optic nerve the"
"optic nerve looks around and they"
"connect to the spinal cord instead of to"
"the brain the brain collects that"
"information how it knows that this weird"
"patch of tissue on its tail is actually"
"providing visual data we have no idea"
"but these animals can see perfectly well"
"out of that eye in other words we built"
"a machine that trains these animals for"
"visual cues and they can they can they"
"can behave quite well"
"so so the plasticity of of major"
"architectural change okay is uh is is is"
"really remarkable that so we're starting"
"to think about the creativity of this"
"process it's intelligent not only"
"because it can get to the same position"
"of the space from different starting"
"positions this is william james's"
"definition of intelligence right the"
"ability to reach the same goal by"
"different means but it actually has the"
"ability to handle completely novel"
"configurations and so what we have in"
"biology at all scales is a kind of"
"competency this is a multi-scale"
"competency architecture where every"
"layer solves problems so every layer"
"from your genetic networks to your to"
"your individual cells now"
"the networks that they make the"
"different organs the animals of course"
"and even the swarms"
"solve various kinds of problems in their"
"own space and what does that look like"
"well here are a few examples so this"
"is a it's a it's a mexican salamander"
"known as an axolotl these animals"
"regenerate their limbs"
"they do a natural experiment when"
"they're housed together they bite each"
"other's legs off all the time they"
"regenerate their legs they regenerate"
"their tails we mean including spinal"
"cord their eyes their jaws"
"portions of the heart and the brain and"
"so what happens is that if if if an"
axolotl
"loses a limb at any position what will"
"happen is that it will grow exactly"
"what's needed no more no less and then"
"the most magical thing happens which is"
"that it stops how does it know when to"
"stop it stops when a correct salamander"
"limb is complete so once again we meet"
"this idea that these these bodies are"
"navigating the space of anatomies this"
"morphospace uh with a very particular"
"set point about where they're trying to"
"get to okay and one of the things that"
"we've done recently is actually uh we've"
"actually understood something about"
"where this information is stored and it"
"is stored bioelectrically it is stored"
"using electrical"
"memory basically the same thing that"
"happens in the brain in fact we think"
"that brains probably"
"co-opted this ability from much from"
"much earlier"
"evolutionary contexts and here what you"
"can see is that this is this is one of"
"our favorite examples this is a"
"planarian a flatworm it has a head with"
"a brain and a"
"central nerve cords and a tail and the"
"thing about planaria is that they always"
"regenerate so you can cut them into"
"pieces and every piece will give rise to"
"a perfect little worm"
"so normally here this is one one"
"planarian you cut off the head and the"
"tail that middle fragment right here uh"
"knows exactly what to do it regrows and"
"so it makes one head one tail in the"
"correct positions no problem every piece"
"of that it's kind of a holographic thing"
"every piece of the worm knows exactly"
"what it's supposed to look like and so"
"we asked the question how does it know"
"first how does it know how many heads"
"it's supposed to have and it turns out"
"that if you if you read the electrical"
"pattern in this tissue you can read out"
"something like this that actually says"
"one head one head one tail and that's"
"what it makes so we went in and using"
"a particular technique using drugs that"
"target ion channel uh pro proteins we"
"change the bioelectric pattern in this"
"animal again it's a one-headed animal"
"and we simply change the electric"
"pattern that specifies what it remembers"
"a correct planarian to look like okay so"
"when you do that well first nothing"
"happens until you injure it once you"
"injure it it regenerates and uses this"
"information as the template and then it"
"will go ahead and regenerate exactly"
"what the pattern memory says and if it"
"says two heads then it will go ahead and"
"build a two-headed animal this is not"
"photoshopped this is not um you know a"
"drawing these are real these are real"
"animals i'll show you a video of them"
shortly
"and so whether you have one head or two"
"heads is actually not nailed down by the"
"genetics we don't touch the genome this"
"is not genomic editing the genome is"
"completely wild type if you sequence the"
"genome of these two-headed guys you will"
"see absolutely nothing wrong they have a"
"completely normal genetic set of"
"instructions but the memory of this um"
"collective intelligence of these cells"
"when it has to decide how is it going to"
"navigate that space that memory is"
"stored electrically much like our"
"memories of experience in"
"three-dimensional space now one thing"
"you can do is you can map out the the in"
"fact it was as josh was saying the space"
"you can actually map out the space of"
"this electrical circuit and you will"
"find regions that correspond to two"
"heads one heads or in fact no heads now"
"one thing one thing that's kind of uh"
"unusual here is that there's actually"
"pretty few dimensions here why is that i"
mean
"uh josh was pointing out that that the"
"dimensionality of these spaces grows"
"unbelievably fast right so in the"
"library of babel uh you know you would"
"never find anything how is it that this"
"is such a low dimensional space in which"
"we can actually find the triggers that"
"turn you into a one headed a two-headed"
"and and so on the reason that it's low"
"dimensional is because this we're"
"dealing here with an agential material"
"that is fairly smart we are not trying"
"to micromanage the position of all the"
"stem cells and all the gene expression"
"if we were to do that you would be"
"facing a um"
"a space that's of the kind that josh"
"described which would be intractable"
"both for for"
"uh evolution to get to in the rapid way"
"that we see and also uh for for"
"regenerative medicine for for"
"bioengineering the reason that we can we"
"can take advantage of these nice"
"convenient spaces is because all the"
"components have innate uh"
"competency to read these electrical"
"states and make decisions such as i'm"
"going to build a head or i'm going to"
"build a tail these things are modular"
"they have they have a modular structure"
"that enables them to do this now not"
"only can we call up different numbers of"
"heads but it turns out that if you look"
"further in that space you can find"
"attractors that belong in other that"
"belong to other species of planaria so"
"so here a triangular planarian can give"
"rise to a flat-headed species like a p"
"fellina or a round head like an s"
"mediterranean um in fact not only do"
"their head shapes change but their brain"
"shapes and the distribution of stem"
"cells change as well"
"again no genetic change there's nothing"
"wrong with genetically with these guys"
"but they are now using a different"
"region of the space of all possible"
"planarian heads in fact we can go even"
"further and really get creative and ask"
"well what else is in that space well it"
"turns out that there are things that"
"don't look like planaria at all so there"
"are spiky forms like this there are"
"cylinders there are sort of combination"
"forms and this uh this the collective"
"intelligence of these cells can explore"
"the regions of that state space normally"
"it's incredibly reliable and it always"
"gets to where it goes but we can"
"manipulate that and and using those"
"kinds of signals by manipulating the um"
"bioelectric information processing in"
"that uh in that system we can we can we"
"can start to explore that space and so"
"now we make the connection to uh to the"
"zenobots one thing that we can ask is"
"well presumably the kinds of shapes that"
"exist in that space were created by"
"evolution evolution uh uh structures"
"that space to have um adaptive kinds of"
"animal behaviors and animal structures"
"and so on but the question is really how"
"much how much novelty can we"
"can we expect from cells as they"
"navigate that space where do target"
"morphologies come from and so what we"
"sought to do"
"was uh in in collaboration with uh with"
"with josh's lab is to ask what happens"
"when cells are liberated from their"
"normal environment and asked to reboot"
"their multicellularity what what are"
"they going to do so so this is this is"
"what we did uh we took um skin cells"
"from an early from an early frog embryo"
"we cultured them in a dish now there are"
"many things they could have done they"
"could have died they could have crawled"
"away from each other and spread out they"
"could have made a two-dimensional"
"monolayer like cell culture instead they"
"did this so here are the cells being"
"loaded into this little they're"
"dissociated they're being remembered"
"this is just skin they're being"
"overnight they basically collapse"
"together into this they cohere into this"
"little little ball um the flashes that"
"you're seeing are calcium signaling"
"meaning it's it's um they're"
"processing information it's extremely"
"brain-like actually and then then you"
"get this so this is the xenobots that"
"josh introduced you to so they're using"
"these little hairs that normally would"
"be spreading the mucus around on them on"
"the surface of the frog uh or the"
"tadpole so it swims along they can have"
"all kinds of behaviors they can go in"
"circles they can patrol back and forth"
"they can have collective behaviors like"
"this here's here's a xenobot um"
"navigating a maze there's no water flow"
"the water is completely still so here it"
"goes it takes the corner without bumping"
"into the outside wall and at this point"
"for whatever reason it decides to turn"
"around and go back where it came from"
"okay so they have spontaneous behaviors"
"that we are not micromanaging you can"
"see with these calcium signals if you"
"were to take a"
"a reading of um of a uh of a"
"of a brain human zebrafish whatever this"
"is what you would see you would see you"
"would see this kind of calcium spiking"
"and so remember there's no neurons here"
"we're still uh working to decode what"
"these cells are saying to each other and"
"what the bots may be saying to"
"themselves they regenerate so if you cut"
"if you cut the the body in half they"
"will actually seal up so here you go"
"they'll seal up just like that"
"and uh and of course as josh showed you"
"the one of the most amazing things they"
"do is um they actually uh"
"they actually"
"make copies of themselves so this is"
"kinematic replication i mean think of"
"think of what's happened here um we've"
"made it impossible for these cells to"
"reproduce in the way that frogs normally"
"reproduce within 48 hours they find a"
"new way to make copies of themselves out"
"of stuff they find in their environment"
"in a way that as far as we know no other"
"animal does right so talk about"
"creativity novelty this is this is a"
"completely new way that they're that"
"they're doing to reap to uh to make"
"copies of themselves"
"but the only reason it works is because"
"it what we're dealing with is an"
"agential material these cells"
"the reason we can make xenobots is"
"because once you put that once you take"
"the cells uh and put them in a"
"particular configuration they want to"
"get together and and become a and become"
"a zenobot that is exactly what allows"
"the second generation because all of"
"these all that these guys do is they"
"make the little piles and then the"
"little piles turn into more zenobots and"
"this is exactly what makes evolution so"
"efficient is that it's working with an"
"agential material it's not working with"
"a passive kind of a material these these"
"cells already have agendas they used to"
"be single cell organisms they have all"
"kinds of"
"uh control circuits about what they"
"should do in under various circumstances"
"and we as engineers and evolution can"
"take advantage of that and so um the the"
"amazing thing of course is that both of"
"these life histories have exactly the"
"same genome so this is the standard one"
"and if you know the thing about"
"development is that it's so reliable it"
"basically lulls us into this false sense"
"of um uh determinism where we think that"
"well if you know frogs frog eggs make"
"frogs and acorns make oak trees what"
"else would it be but it turns out that"
"that's just one possible way uh to live"
"here's here's another one the exact same"
cells
"can um"
"can form conform a zenobot it has a"
"developmental sequence so two months"
"later it looks like this i have no idea"
"what this is this is a completely new"
"developmental stage that's never existed"
"before and uh and they have"
"different behaviors than tadpoles do so"
"so now we have uh the answer to a couple"
"of questions the first question is um"
"what what do skin cells really want to"
"do looking at an embryo you might think"
"that well what they'd like to do is to"
"have this boring sort of passive"
"two-dimensional life on the outside of"
"the animal keeping out the bacteria and"
"then you find out that that's actually"
"not their default behavior that's their"
"behavior when they are basically bullied"
"into it by the instructive interactions"
"by the rest of the cells so what"
"evolution is really doing is enabling"
"other cells to have this kind of"
"behavior shaping effect where it takes"
"these these competent skin cells and"
"shapes their behavior to be an outer"
"skin surface in the absence of all of"
"that this is their native behavior this"
"is actually what what the skin cells do"
"uh baseline and of course then when you"
"ask the question well where does this"
"come from uh unlike every other creature"
"on earth where well it's the explanation"
"is it's eons of selective pressure to be"
"this shape or this kind this color to"
"have this behavior"
"there's never been any zenobots so"
"there's never been specific evolutionary"
"pressure to be a good xenobot the"
"typical story you would tell about any"
"other life on earth doesn't exist here"
"and so and yet and yet overnight they"
"make a very coherent organism so where"
"does that come from this is one of the"
"biggest mysteries uh facing facing us"
"today so i just want to close up by"
"saying that um because life is so"
"incredibly interoperable and because"
"cells have to solve these problems on"
"the fly they don't take too seriously"
"the expectations of prior um develop"
"evolutionary lineages they they can they"
"can do a lot of things on the fly that"
"that makes them incredibly interoperable"
"which means that almost any combination"
"of evolved material so cells tissues dna"
"whatever is natural with designed"
"materials so smart very smart materials"
"um nanotechnology and so on and software"
"almost any combination of this stuff is"
"some kind of coherent agent that's going"
"to have some sort of body it's going to"
"have some sort of cognitive capacity may"
"be very maybe very simple maybe quite"
"advanced and so already we have hybrids"
"and and cyborgs and humans plugged into"
"various things"
"we are going to be living in a in an"
"incredibly large um option space of"
"possible living agents everything that's"
"that we're familiar with in the"
"biological world is like this tiny"
"corner of that and this has this has"
"real implications for uh developing"
"better uh better frameworks for how we"
"relate to other creatures that are"
"profoundly different from us not just in"
"the way that darwin thought of meaning"
"just distance along that same you know"
"linear distance along that same um tree"
"of life but completely different uh"
"types of creatures that are nowhere on"
"the uh on the tree of life so um i will"
"close here to just to say that there are"
"more um more in-depth discussions and"
"some things that josh and i um have"
written
"and i want to thank uh a couple of"
"people that did the work so so doug doug"
"blackiston is the biologist that did all"
"the zenobot stuff sam kriegman is uh"
"josh's phd student that did all the"
"computer science for for all of this and"
"various collaborators and our funders"
"and i'm here if you're wondering what um"
"two-headed planaria do in their spare"
"time this is it uh they've been called"
"impossible objects because when you cut"
"two-headed worms it's a it's a memory"
"and of course memory persists the pieces"
"of a two-headed worm continue to make"
"two-headed worms okay and with despite"
"their their normal genetics it's a"
"permanent line that's got a completely"
"different morphology so um"
"uh yeah and that's it and and thank you"
"for listening"
"thanks thanks a lot super fantastic talk"
"uh very interesting i ask questions"
"immediately from the audience if someone"
"has a burning question in the"
"in the hand"
no
"i have here several i just know which"
"way to start um"
"some of them are"
smaller
"um one of the questions i wrote down"
"here which is actually for both of you"
limitations
"what are the limitations or i guess kind"
"of referencing"
um
"how did you"
"come up with this idea what what's the"
"next step"
"and what are the challenges and"
"limitations on this because i see some"
"but i'm curious to hear from you"
"i can speak to some of the technological"
"challenges and opportunities here the"
"the first one is that the ai is able to"
"generate so many ideas of things to try"
"and and it's relatively certain that"
"they're going to work given the biology"
"that it has is that our i think our"
"ability to manufacture and test these"
"ideas in reality is log lagging far"
"behind so one challenge that mike and i"
"are working on is how to how to ensure"
"that the manufacturing or the ability to"
"build these things bring them into"
"reality uh can keep up with what the ai"
"can dream up"
mike
"yeah um i'll go in a slightly different"
"direction and say that i think the"
"biggest limitation is the limitation of"
"our imagination in the following sense"
"all of the engineering in the past has"
"been uh largely focused on passive"
"materials where you have to be"
"responsible for everything that the"
"material is going to do and we now have"
"to shift to a completely different mode"
"of engineering that is much more of a"
"collaboration with the material it's"
"more about communicating uh and and"
"behavior shaping the material at various"
"levels of of competency and giving it"
"various signals to try and convince it"
"to do things it already knows how to do"
"perhaps in new ways and ways that other"
"to achieve other other things that you"
"wanted to achieve it is a completely"
"different way of engineering it is uh it"
"is something that is is requires a major"
"revolution not only in in engineering"
"but in for example regenerative medicine"
"where uh so so we work on things like"
"trying to grow grow back people's limbs"
"and regenerate organs and and i don't"
"believe that's going to happen by by"
"micro managing where all the cells go"
"and what all the gene expressions are i"
"think we're much more likely to achieve"
"that by taking seriously the competency"
"of the material and communicating to the"
"to the tissues this is the shape we want"
"now go ahead and go ahead and build it"
"so so to me that's the biggest"
"limitation is building conceptual"
"frameworks that allow you to take the"
"intelligence of your material seriously"
"and take advantage of of what it can do"
"thank you michael anders you have a"
"question in the chat i'm going to read"
it
"this is perhaps more of a comment than a"
"question but"
"the adaptable unpredictable behavior of"
"the xenobots"
"has some nice parallels with the first"
"speaker's question about unruliness and"
"the idea of"
"that lives preserves"
"given that as you mentioned evolution"
"programs cells to act in ways that they"
"don't necessarily want"
"i would be curious to hear your thoughts"
"about the concept of unruliness and"
"how that relates to creativity in the"
"context of life-building"
"i mean what i would say is that uh we"
"have to remember that"
"a lot of the important aspects of all of"
"this are observer dependent so when we"
"as an observer as let's say the engineer"
"uh looks at these kind of systems and we"
"make claims about"
"this is how intelligent i think they are"
"this is the range of problems they know"
"how to solve they are unruly because"
"because i because i don't know the rules"
"or they are ruling because i've come up"
"with some rules that seem to fit all of"
"this is uh provisional and uh it's we"
"are basically ourselves taking an iq"
"test when we make claims about these"
"things and uh other observers it may be"
"much cleverer than than we are and test"
"them in different spaces so for example"
"in in physical space this is what they"
"know how to do but like bacteria in"
"physiological space or metabolic space"
"they may have enormous competencies that"
"that we may have absolutely no idea"
"about so whether something and and then"
"of course many systems are make models"
"internally of themselves and of the"
"outside world and so how they see"
"themselves is a complete is a whole"
"other question so so whether or not"
"something is really or or or unruly is"
"always relative to an observer i think"
"and uh almost certainly we're going to"
"find these things to be unruly because"
"we're not actually very good at"
"predicting what collective intelligences"
"are going to do so i think it's very"
"likely that we find all these things"
"unruly because we just we just don't"
"have a good a good um signs yet or even"
"good intuitions yet about how to predict"
"what the rules ought to be"
"i i'd add on to mike here again this"
"idea of what does it mean to be unruly"
"or ruley i i think you know it's"
"interesting the language that the"
"previous speaker used and the message in"
"chat here you know the cells don't want"
"it the tissues don't want it you know"
"what do they or don't they want"
"one of the things that we can do with"
"our ai technologies is not ask them to"
"make useful machines but ask them to"
"make machines that are conceptually"
"transparent that they create living"
"systems that allow us to see better what"
"the what the cells and tissues quote"
"unquote do and don't want to do"
"another angle to this is uh is comparing"
"it with robotics so somewhat"
"tongue-in-cheek this technology is now"
"referred to as xenobots or biobots"
"a robot is you know a machine that's"
"designed by humans or these days an ai"
"to do something useful for humans"
"i've been combining ai and robotics for"
"20 years and traditionally with robotics"
"the ai has to figure out how to build a"
"machine using a battery some hunks of"
"metal ceramics plastics circuitry"
"sensors motors and most of the time it"
"the ai really struggles those are dead"
"materials that don't collaborate in this"
"creative process of trying to make"
"something more than the sum of their"
parts
"the one thing that i've learned with my"
"collec through my collaboration with"
"mike's group in doing this building"
"machines out of living systems is that"
"they're collaborative and again that's"
"my view on it it seems that they seem to"
"somehow collaborate in this process it's"
"it's it doesn't seem to me that they're"
"resisting they're somehow going along"
"with what it is we want them to do and"
"again there's a lot of"
"anthropomorphizing there and taking an"
"intentional stance"
"the only thing i know for sure is it's"
"very very different"
"from building machines out of dead or"
"inorganic materials and like mike said i"
"think that's a harbinger of a complete"
"sea change in the way that we think"
"about you know art creativity"
engineering
"basically making stuff it's going to be"
"very very different in the years to come"
thanks
"there's a question here from iona i"
think
"oh yes thank you so much i uh very much"
"enjoyed your uh presentation"
"and um yeah you used a lot of language"
"um that i relate and some and a lot of"
antrum
"for anthropomorphizing"
"yeah uh which we artists tend to do on a"
"daily basis and encouraged to do but i"
"know scientists are trying to avoid so"
"that was a very interesting"
"aspect as well"
"um i also enjoyed the fact that you"
"looked at life not from um"
"genetic perspective but actually um you"
"know you you opened up the black box to"
"have more kind of"
"a gentle cellular"
material
"so um just going back to language"
"okay first of all i want to ask if"
"xenobots themselves have their own kind"
"of uniqueness"
"or are they more or less the same that's"
"one question like can you see um"
"you know if we are going all the way to"
"anthromorphicizing those xenobots i mean"
"we're talking"
"i think josh you talked about them as"
"like almost um"
"babies um do they have their own"
"personalities that's one question that i"
have
"um another thing is that the language of"
"liberating is quite interesting"
"yeah i mean"
"you really yeah"
"and again language is"
"not neutral"
"so when you say you're liberating the"
"cells you are um taking the standpoint"
"and i think that was the question how"
"much do you think um you're liberating"
"them or how much"
"you know"
"you displacing them"
"that's one question that i have to say"
"saying all that i displace sales on a"
"daily basis so that's fine"
um
"another thing that i want to say to say"
"is that you use rene descartes as the"
"person of intelligence"
"but rene descartes made a complete"
"division between body and mind and i"
"think what you're trying to say here"
"that there's not such a division that"
"actually intelligence"
"is already whatever intelligence is you"
"know we're using those big words um is"
"already in the cell you know and"
"definitely a combination of cells"
"so that was another thing that is quite"
"interesting maybe we need to think about"
"a new philosopher to put there"
um
and
"yeah um i enjoyed it very much because"
"of this um"
"create you know anthropocentric"
"uh language that we're using"
collaboration
"um i think the cells collaborate"
"probably more with each other than with"
"you but that's fine"
and
"and again i've been collaborating"
"results a lot and not all collaboration"
"were um"
"yeah so successful but"
"very interesting thank you so much"
"well thank you thank you so much a lot"
"lots of good things to talk about um you"
"know uh we we take the language very"
"seriously we think about it"
"quite a lot actually and uh the reason"
"well the specific reason i show rene"
"descartes as that example is exactly"
"because you can see that a process that"
"goes extremely gradually and slowly from"
"a single cell in fact from a quiescent"
"uh oocyte can give rise to a kind of"
"system that's going to then make"
"pronouncements like hey i'm not a"
"machine right i'm not a you know i'm"
"something different and so on i mean"
"it's amazing actually that that uh that"
"process can give rise to"
"uh uh"
"beings that that have a cognitive"
"capacity to make claims uh you know that"
"are completely at odds with with the"
"actual process that gave rise to them"
"right so that's to to me i did i do that"
"i show descartes on purpose because i"
"think that's quite interesting um i will"
"also say this about anthropomorphizing"
uh
"i i i don't believe there's any such"
"thing for the following reason i think i"
"think that whole that whole um uh what"
"they call that whole supposed fallacy of"
"anthropomorphizing things is a holdover"
from
"pre-scientific world views where uh"
"there was a sort of garden of eden and"
"there were a bunch of fixed kinds of"
"organisms and there was there was adam"
"and he was human and there was a bunch"
"of other animals and it was very"
"important to be sure not to um not to"
"say anything that made it sound like the"
"kinds of things that adam can do are in"
"some small way possible outside of"
"of of the human species that that humans"
"had some sort of you know when we say"
"something is anthropomorphized we're"
"saying that there's there's some kind of"
"unique magic here that we shouldn't even"
"look for it in in even tiny versions"
"basal versions anywhere else but the one"
"thing we now know from evolution and and"
"in particular from development it's slow"
"and gradual there is there is no magic"
"time point at which a lightning bolt"
"sort of gives a true cognition or true"
"memory or or or a goal directedness or"
"anything else you you start off as as a"
"piece of physics which most people would"
"say okay you know"
"you shouldn't anthropomorphize it"
"whatever and nine months later and uh"
"you know maybe a couple of years later"
"you say okay now now we can"
"anthropomorphize it nothing magical"
"happens during that time literally it's"
"it's slow in gradual step by step and so"
"i you know i i push very strongly on"
"this idea that that there is not a"
"binary distinction between uh any of"
"these things there's it's it's gradual"
"and the question is what kind and how"
"much so we can ask questions about um"
"for any given system it could be an"
"amoeba it could be a xenobot it could be"
"a plant it could be a new you know"
"synthetic alien life form whatever for"
"any of these things the real question is"
"okay what kind of cognitive capacity"
"does it have and and there are good"
"frameworks worked out that are that are"
"that actually show you all the different"
"steps along the way and how much you"
"know how much should we treat it as a"
"cognitive agent not binary but what kind"
"and how much so all the language is"
"actually is is used here quite quite"
"intentionally to try to break down that"
"what what what i think is a false"
dichotomy
"i i would just add to that again the the"
"robotics and ai perspective here that"
"going all the way back to the"
"cyberneticians in the in the 50s and"
"into the 40s"
"a lot of them uh intentionally used a"
"gentle language they would point to you"
"know the machine of the day and say it's"
"thinking it wants it's trying to"
"and and a lot of that was a prod against"
"our preconceptions about what is and it"
"does what has and what does not have"
agency
"and today if you look at robotics and ai"
"these are two branches of cognitive"
"science essentially that focus on the"
"body and the brain robotics and ai so"
"cartesian dualism is still with us and"
"it's deeply you know marred the way we"
"think about intelligence uh in machines"
"and so you can see in our field today"
"and my colleagues you know they feel"
"very confident to point at gpt3 the"
"current state of the art in ai and say"
"it's not conscious it has no thoughts"
"it's not creative it's not an artist"
"it's different from human artists"
"whether they're right or not the the"
"telling sign that's been true ever since"
"the cyberneticians is this"
"confidence that we know"
"this machine absolutely has no agency"
"humans absolutely have agency animals"
"absolutely have slightly less than us"
"and it's interesting i think from an"
"artistic point of view and from an"
"engineering and scientific point of view"
"to probe the origins of that certainty"
"why are we so certain"
"and as you know as technology and"
"science continues"
"is to observe how it's dissolving that"
certainty
"i am completely"
"agreeing with you that we shouldn't be"
"the binary in its continuum and you know"
"actually all those kind of projects that"
"discussed here raising all those"
"questions which are you know"
"um interesting and and"
"if i may say even magical um"
"my question and then i'll stop and let"
"other talk to you"
"so i just to be again and i'm um a"
"provocateur here okay don't uh"
"part of being an artist is to be a"
"provocateur and many uh in many respects"
"you know i agree but i provoke"
"so first of all for josh"
"so do you think that a.i"
"has agency at the moment like when you"
"work with a.i"
"do you have a agency and for um michael"
"can you see life evolved from non-living"
material
"great questions and i i also wanted to"
"say i loved your talk i learned a lot"
"and clearly you know you've been in the"
"trenches for many many years you know"
"the challenges and and and the joys of"
"creating with living materials"
"i would say i don't know i don't know"
"how to know i don't know how to know"
"whether the ai has agency or not i feel"
"equal equally uncomfortable if i claim"
"that it does or it doesn't"
"and so you know following in turing's"
"footsteps i i see"
"that in this case when we think about ai"
"generated biology"
"the products of what our ai dreams up we"
"can point to those"
"as a form of turing test there's there's"
"a creative product there is someone or"
"something that created this thing the"
"xenobot that has never existed on earth"
before
"and if you claim that the ai is not"
"creative it's not an artist it doesn't"
"have agency then the onus falls back on"
"to you to prove that human artists have"
"agency have creativity have inspiration"
"and if you're clear that one type of"
"artist is different from the other"
"tell me how they're different so"
"again i think i agree with you i think"
"you know mike and i and you and everyone"
"here are provocateurs and"
"there's one thing that's pretty"
"provoking is the things that this ai"
"spits out and it just helps us you know"
"really get at the roots of why we're"
"often so certain about what is and isn't"
agential
"yeah um i i would say a couple of things"
"first of all with respect to life and uh"
"i'm i'm not sure that that life is a"
"super interesting criterion honestly i"
"think that cognitive capacity is much"
"more interesting because there are many"
"things on the spectrum of agency um and"
"we could do a whole whole kind of"
"discussion about what's on that spectrum"
"but but there are many things on that"
"spectrum that nobody would uh pro would"
"call alive there are many things that"
"people would agree are alive and there"
"are many things that uh we would argue"
"about and never reach a consensus and so"
"when i see uh disagreements about a"
"terminology that are not uh reachable by"
"experiment and that are basically just"
"sort of people arguing"
"endlessly with about these philosophical"
"pre um kind of preconceptions to me that"
"sounds like that that always feels like"
"a pseudo problem that that means our"
"terminology isn't good so so i don't"
"know that life by itself is a"
"particularly interesting concept but i"
"do really like uh trying to figure out"
"where things fall on a particular uh"
"spectrum of of of agency and"
"to go back to the other question of of"
"of a kind of engineered agency and ai"
"and zone"
"you know the the best um kind of road"
"map to all this was given to us by"
"science fiction uh you know probably"
"well over a hundred years ago you can"
"just run this mental experiment so"
"you're at home one day this thing lands"
"on your front lawn something trundles"
"out uh"
"it it you know you come out to look at"
"it it sort of hands you this this poem"
"that it wrote along the way about how"
"happy it is to meet you and so now you"
"have some choices to make because it"
"doesn't look like anything you've seen"
"before there are no obvious things well"
"it kind of looks like a fish so i'm"
"going to treat it like a fish"
"it doesn't look like anything you've"
"seen before you could try to use these"
"old categories that we had so you sort"
"of what did you do in the old days to"
"find out you would sort of knock on it"
"and if you hear a kind of metallic"
"clanging sound you would make"
"conclusions you would say okay it came"
"out of a factory it's going to be boring"
"and um and kind of simplistic and i'm"
"you know ethically it's permissible for"
"me to take it apart and and you know do"
"some things with it"
"we you can't do that anymore right and"
"once you understand that there's this"
"space of of of possible beings those"
"criteria fail utterly it doesn't matter"
"what it's made of the fact that it might"
"be largely aluminum that doesn't matter"
"for any of the things we care about um"
"you might ask where it came you know how"
"did it come to be was it created by some"
"other intelligence like is this is this"
"the quote-unquote robot that somebody"
"built or is this the actual alien"
"civilization that sent it does that even"
"matter once that once you know it's it"
"gives you some pretty good poetry and"
"you feel like you can have some kind of"
"a relationship to it all of the criteria"
"it's like josh said"
"you know we can't tell anymore because"
"all we now see that the criteria that"
"we've been using are"
"kind of uh kind of uh useless and and"
"really we're just just based on on"
"limitations of imagination and"
"technology in the previous age and even"
"though we don't have yet aliens"
"you know real exobiological aliens what"
"we do have are created um"
"constructs whether they be software or"
"whether they be zenobots or whatever"
"else that are basically filling that"
"role so all the problems that that that"
"the science fiction writers talked about"
"about how do you relate to something"
"that's completely alien how are you"
"going to know whether you owe it respect"
"or whether you can take it apart and do"
"things all of these things are now with"
"us today even though the aliens haven't"
"landed because we these aliens are here"
"now we can make them so all of those"
"problems are here and we do not yet have"
"a good road map for making any decisions"
"like that"
"thanks um questions from audience"
"nobody dares to ask anything but i have"
"a question at first i have a comment i"
"was thinking thanks michael because i"
"was thinking exactly this that the"
"terminology somehow doesn't match"
"because this kind of two-headed worm i"
"mean that would be called mutation"
"earlier but mutation then also or also"
"i in my head it would reference"
"something which is"
"a trans evolution but this is"
"intentional in some sense"
"i don't know"
"ah that is true yeah yeah so it's"
"interesting that there isn't really a"
"term for that what it is"
"uh well there are plenty of terms for it"
"in neuroscience because in neuroscience"
"we have a we have a great body of"
"knowledge about how"
"information about goals in various"
"spaces are stored in electrical networks"
"so people who study memory learning and"
"things like this they face exactly this"
"problem there's a rat the rat has"
"remembered how to run the maze from"
"beginning to end and so our job is to do"
"some kind of neural decoding because we"
"believe that that information the goal"
"the cognitive content of that rat's mind"
"is in some way in the electrical network"
"right so so neuroscientists already"
"grapple with this with us they have a"
"they have a physical machine that in"
"some way embodies mental goals i mean"
"it's an immediate it's an amazing thing"
"but but but neuroscientists already face"
"this and and what i'm saying is that"
"brains did not evolve that magic trick"
"it basically they just optimized it for"
"from other types of spaces that"
"evolution has been dealing with for for"
"for a really long time yeah"
"another question to chose or kind of uh"
"i guess um"
"what i'm wondering with ai is that ai is"
"always kind of i feel it's always based"
on
"human limitations it's a kind of"
"modeling based on us"
"what do you think"
"it's like i guess my my concern here"
"would be that that's a sort of a the"
"limitation of of this"
"development but what's your take on it"
"or can you see that it can go further"
"yeah it's a great question so"
"historically ai is built built in human"
"form um i mentioned the beginning of my"
"talk that there are three players here"
"that are of interest humans the living"
"living systems and the ai itself"
"mike just mentioned aliens you know"
"what's which one is the alien here the"
"the ai is also alien in a certain way"
"the the ai that i i focus on is these"
"evolutionary algorithms which i would"
"say are are nothing like human beings"
"they are literally darwinian selection"
"operating inside a machine they are"
"amoral they don't care they have no"
"value judgments of what they find"
"and that's just it's a fact that's"
"that's what it is now what we as a"
"society want to do with that i think uh"
"eonaut spoke eloquently to that in in"
"her talk it's it's value neutral you"
"know this ai is going to bring back"
"things from you know morpho space robo"
"space biobot space you know cultured"
"meat space it's going to bring back"
"things that are increasingly troubling"
"they may solve a lot of our problems in"
"ways that we don't necessarily like"
"that's one of the the the more recent"
"lessons from ai is that ai knows how to"
"build autonomous mach autonomous cars"
"and those autonomous cars kill less"
"human beings than human driven cars"
"full stop"
"what is it that we want to do about that"
"we can't decide different countries have"
"different ideas about how they want to"
"regulate that technology that is going"
"to be our biggest challenge not that the"
"ai is not you know is too much like"
"humans and is going to come up with the"
"same things we do"
"the challenging part is going to come up"
"with very very different things and"
"force us to make moral decisions that i"
"think are very difficult because it's"
"going to bring back solutions that are"
"increasing incredibly efficacious"
"they're going to help relieve alleviate"
"a lot of biomedical suffering as mike"
"will tell you"
"but they are troubling in other ways"
"they are very alien solutions"
"that maybe we would not have thought of"
"or not necessarily digestible and i"
"think i i don't have an answer about how"
"we're going to regulate you know think"
through
"the solutions that the ai presents us"
with
"i would argue it's the alien it's it's"
"got very different values"
"than we do"
"no one talks about the biases of ai"
"i mean yeah"
"i just wonder if you heard about ai"
"biases would you like to ask um about"
that
yes
"okay yes they would like to ask about"
that
"we have a scientist in the room who's"
"been studying biases in ai particularly"
"natural language processing and i would"
"ask her to talk about that but"
"i'm actually very concerned a little bit"
"concerned about the ethical dilemmas i"
"know michael that you had put ethics as"
"a side note in one of your slides but"
"how do we really confront this"
"uh increasingly we have done this in the"
"context of gmo products we've had to"
"think about regulatory frameworks for"
"that but increasingly as we build more"
"of these kinds of uh"
"biological machines uh they may have an"
"impact on an environment that is"
unintended
and
"as a scientist"
"discovery innovation is super important"
"but in the hands of"
"perhaps other actors uh it may take a"
"different role so at what point sort of"
"like cipher and all these other"
"technologies gene slicing when do we"
"make a decision about trying to also"
"develop ethical frameworks around this"
work
"and maybe i'll ask rochelle if she has a"
"question about bias"
"yeah the the the question the the answer"
"to um when do we develop ethical"
"frameworks for all this is is like 100"
"years ago that that's when we should"
"have done it because because"
"many many issues uh i mean look at you"
"know we don't have to uh think about"
"zenobots in particular we can think"
"about all of the things that we've done"
"when we domesticate various animals"
"we've been making chimeras for thousands"
"of years you know mules don't exist"
"naturally right it's a it's a chimeric"
"creation um"
"we have a food industry that that treats"
"uh pigs and and sheep and cows which are"
"you know animals which are probably not"
"controversially agential in certain ways"
uh
"this stuff has been with us for a really"
"long time all this new technology is"
"doing is really just shining a spotlight"
"on the fact that we do not have a proper"
"framework for dealing with uh other"
"other other agents you know asking"
"whether they look like humans"
"sufficiently is not cutting it and and"
"we should have known that for a long"
"time and we've been some people have"
"been wrestling with that for a long time"
"but now it's just blazingly obvious and"
"we need to do this"
"now the other thing i'll point out about"
"the environmental and everything else is"
"look there's a there's and we spent a"
"lot of time thinking about these issues"
"there's a there's a"
"common stance"
"from which people come at this which is"
"kind of this background assumption that"
"okay everything is pretty good now and"
"we need to make sure that the scientists"
"don't screw it up right there's a"
"hundred different ways that you know"
"people who work with viruses with"
"bacteria with really scary things could"
"could really mess up the world in a in a"
"big way and um"
"that that's kind of a general feeling"
"that everything's great and just let's"
"just make sure we don't make things"
"worse i think this is this is a"
"fundamentally again a holdover from like"
"a kind of garden of eden view where we"
"where people used to think that"
"the world that the that our environment"
"in the world was created in some sort of"
"optimal fashion and now it's on us not"
"to make things worse i just want to"
"point out that that evolution does not"
"optimize for intelligence for happiness"
"for any of the things we value it"
"optimizes for biomass that's it and so"
"that means that um we have to take"
"seriously the fact that things are not"
"great right now there is unbelievable"
"human and animal suffering worldwide"
"biomedical suffering"
"uh there are major environmental"
"problems um all of these things already"
"exist so so the question isn't how do we"
"sort of clamp down on scientific"
"progress so that we don't we don't make"
"things worse the ques the the to me the"
"point is we all as as scientists as"
"artists as philosophers all of these"
"communities have an ethical duty an"
"actual moral responsibility to figure"
"out what technologies are available to"
"make life better for everybody for every"
"eve for all sentient beings basically"
"and that does not include keeping status"
"quo and hoping that somebody doesn't"
"develop something that that screws it up"
"it means taking very seriously the fact"
"that uh we are now collaborators with"
"this material and at least"
"at least we have some abilities not"
"great but we have some ability to uh to"
"engineer things toward a particular"
"purpose and that gives us massive"
"responsibilities and and that means more"
"science not less science and so that"
"that's how i come at this is that is"
"that we have we have this response we"
"have a responsibility now to understand"
"what's going on when collections of"
"parts become new emergent agents we used"
"to you know dan dennett had this this"
"phrase um"
"uh competency without comprehension we"
"we've been making think about this"
"humans have been making extremely"
"intelligent uh uh highly agential beings"
"with no idea of how they do it or what's"
"going to happen next it's called having"
"children right we've been doing this"
"forever we create these these"
"unbelievably um competent uh kinds of"
"advanced beings and we're not doing a"
"super great job but you know if you look"
"around in the society we're not doing a"
"great job to make sure that everybody's"
"um you know uh uh has a has a good"
"experience in the world and uh this is"
"just a tiny microcosm of that it's just"
"shining a spotlight on this idea that we"
"are now doing it with comprehension"
"whereas before we were just kind of"
"doing it so now now we really have to"
"understand what it is that we're doing"
"and how we're going to shape all this"
"towards a better life for sentient"
"beings on the planet"
"thank you"
"any other questions and thanks for the"
"for the last michael i have to say that"
"yeah i don't know i mean"
"i don't i don't know if we are able to"
"do a better job i hope so but uh i i"
"yeah i mean yeah look at"
"how we are reproducing and creating"
"what kind of"
"beings on this planet"
"yeah okay here's you not still"
"um yeah it's completely i mean"
"uh yeah i"
"i don't think yeah um"
"let's not yet that's another question i"
"think we have to be a bit more humble"
"about our ability to create a better"
"world and when you say for everyone i"
say
"who for you know um we are very"
"privileged people the three of us um"
"and it's probably because of certain"
"things but anyway"
"my question is more um"
"about evolution um"
"i guess we talked about mutation that"
"are you know defined as something that"
"is um by gene it happens because of um"
genetic
um
"mistake or defect etc"
"evolution can evolution happen because"
"of morphology"
"and not be"
"because of genetic variant"
"so so yes and no it depends it's a"
"subtle it's a subtle thing"
"evolution is definitely guided by"
"morphology because"
"the morphology of and the behavior of"
"any given creature uh is uh is is a"
"strong determinant of"
"what genes are going to pass on to the"
"next generation right so if you're"
"reproductively successful whatever blah"
"blah blah so"
"for sure morphology plays a huge role in"
"shaping downstream uh downstream changes"
"in in genetics but i will also i will"
"also emphasize this uh and and xenobots"
"are a great example of that but there"
"are many other examples uh we need to we"
"need to be clear on this that um"
"what evolution"
"what evolution gives us when it finds a"
"good genome is not a particular creature"
"that is a solution to a particular"
"environment and it's a fit for that"
"environment and so on the xenopus lavish"
"genome is not a recipe for a frog it is"
"not a solution for how to live in a frog"
"like environment it is a recipe for a"
"problem-solving machine which in many"
"different configurations can solve many"
"other problems and do all kinds of other"
"things the planarian genome is not a"
"recipe for a one-headed worm that does"
"certain things it is a recipe for"
"building a set of tissues that is"
"actually reprogrammable and if it's"
"experienced by electric experience is"
"such that uh now it it's supposed to"
"have two heads it will have two heads"
"and it will permanently have two heads"
"forever uh"
"that's the interesting thing that we're"
"discovering now about about evolution is"
"that it makes these competent um"
problem-solving
"uh agents which is which is completely"
"different than simply tracking the"
"frequency of of genes in in future"
"generations and and and uh trying to do"
"a direct mapping between the genetics"
"and and the anatomy you know there's"
"this incredible layer of competent"
"physiology that sits between the genome"
"and the outcomes and so so that's that i"
"think is is how we need to think about"
this
"super interesting thank you thank you"
"very much um"
"yeah i guess i have a"
"if nobody else has a question i have a"
"last question so so what's next"
like
"where is this going or do you have a"
"certain kind of projection there to the"
future
"uh you talk about the reprogramming is"
"that sort of uh what you're doing now or"
"is there"
"what's the aim"
"is the life gonna come better"
"yeah um so so so on my side uh there's a"
"there's a few key things i i think there"
"are three main"
"um threads of of positive impact that"
"are going to come from this kind of work"
"and and not just zenobots but but just"
"this work in general the the the first"
"and most obvious are useful synthetic"
"living machines okay so so can we make"
"cinnabots can we make skin cells do"
"things that uh that are useful for uh"
"that that improve life for for other"
"creatures of much higher agency us other"
"animals whoever so so useful synthetic"
"living machines that's that's one"
"the other big thing that's going to come"
"of this is regenerative medicine because"
"to the extent that we can use these"
"platforms as a kind of sandbox to"
"understand how do collectives of cells"
"make decisions about what to make that's"
"still very much an open question and if"
"we understood the answer to that if we"
"could communicate to these cells what we"
"want them to make then birth defects"
"traumatic injury"
"uh degenerative disease even cancer is"
"are are basically going to be solved"
"this is this is the one fundamental"
"question that underlies most of medicine"
"not not infectious disease but pretty"
"much everything else in medicine it"
"boils down to how how do we induce a"
"collection of cells to make the kind of"
"organ that we want so so i think uh"
"we're very actively working on this to"
"use this as a platform of discovery for"
"transformative regenerative medicine um"
"which is which is not the expensive you"
"know stem cell implants and all that"
"kind of stuff but actually very cheap"
"off-patent uh ion channel drugs that"
"could be deployed worldwide not just not"
"just in certain communities and then and"
"then the third thing that that i think"
"is is also next that we really need to"
"think deeply about is using this using"
"these advances to really push"
"for uh a a general"
"understanding that that we need new"
"ethical frameworks that that that old"
"criteria of where you came from meaning"
"evolved or designed and what you look"
"like meaning on the kind of tree of life"
"on earth that what you look like and"
"where you came from are not a good way"
"to determine how we are go how we're all"
"going to relate to to this being and i"
"think that goes way beyond the xenobots"
"but but it's just it's just a general"
"push to grow to to grow up as a species"
"and get and get much better um a bunch"
"deeper definitions that are not you know"
"these kind of trivial things that have"
"been around for for decades so those are"
"those are the three things that are next"
"and we're working hard on all of that"
"from the from the ai perspective i would"
"say again come circling back to art i"
"think what what an ai functions"
"increasingly like is a mirror it holds"
"up a mirror to human beings and"
"what ai is producing and what it does"
"and doesn't do makes it harder and"
"harder for us humans to hide"
"hide behind our cognitive biases all"
"humans are flawed our society is flawed"
"i'm a human being but i'm slightly less"
"flawed than all of you right the ai"
"comes back and said you asked for this i"
"did exactly what you wanted i found ai"
bias
"um you know female tends to associate"
"more with nurse and caregiver male tends"
"to associate more with doctor that's"
"what is in your every all human text"
"written since the dawn of time it's a"
"fact what are you going to do about it"
"it's able to i think reflect you know"
"what it means to be human and the flaws"
"of humans an increasingly acute way and"
"it's making us all increasingly"
"uncomfortable and how we're going to"
"deal with that i think that that's"
"what's next i would say ai bias is"
"actually not you know a mistake or a"
"flaw about something to be worried about"
"i would say it's probably the greatest"
"achievement of ai"
"so far so"
"as an artist i i would say that's the"
"future for ai is becoming a better and"
"better mirror for for humans"
"thank you and now i think that we could"
"have finished this we will have some"
"drinks here"
"and i wish you a fantastic day"
"thank you so much everybody thank you"
"for the discussion thank you so much"
"this was very enjoyable"
"thanks bye everyone"
"have a great day where am i here"
