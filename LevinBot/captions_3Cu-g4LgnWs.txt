"it is my pleasure to introduce dr"
"michael levin of tufts university"
"dr levin obtained two bachelor's degrees"
"from tufts in computer science and"
"biology before he obtained his phd in"
"genetics at harvard university where his"
"work centered around the molecular"
"mechanisms governing left-right symmetry"
"in the body"
"his lab focuses on the development of"
"biochemical and optical methods to"
"reprogram biological growth with"
"applications ranging from birth to"
"effect repair organ repair to the"
"creation of synthetic living machines"
"also note dr levin is currently the van"
"ovar bush i hope i'm pronouncing that"
"correctly chair"
"and distinguished professor at tufts"
"university where he also serves as the"
"direct the allen discovery center"
"and with that thank you for joining us"
"and we look forward to your time"
"well thank you so much uh really"
"appreciate um the opportunity to be here"
"and to share some ideas with you"
"um i think uh this will be a a bit of a"
"wild ride so hopefully um"
"hopefully you'll you'll find it useful"
"so um what i want to talk about today"
"and uh if you want to reach me"
"afterwards with any questions or"
"comments or get primary papers on all"
"the stuff that i'm going to show you you"
"can reach me here at these two websites"
"what i'm going to talk about is uh the"
"idea of thinking about brains and what"
"bioengineering can"
"can bring to the study of brains from a"
"broader from a broader perspective we're"
"going to take a step back from kind of"
"the obvious assumption of we think we"
"know what brains are and what what and"
"what what brains are and are not so i"
"want to i want to think about this in a"
"broader context so the first thing just"
"to sort of start warming up with some"
"unusual cases that you may or may not"
"know about"
"the first thing i want to talk about is"
"plasticity in the brain body system so"
"one thing that we've done some years"
"back and this is the work of doug"
"blackiston in our group is to create"
"tadpoles that"
"have no primary eyes in the head but"
"they do have an eye on their tail"
"and the interesting thing about these"
"animals is that uh when you test them in"
"a visual learning assay using this"
"machine that we built which basically"
"asks them to learn uh to differentiate"
"specific types of light cues and move"
"around accordingly um they can see these"
"animals can see perfectly well out of"
"out of these eyes and so that's sort of"
"remarkable because for for millions of"
"years this body design um relied on"
"having visual input from this area of"
"the head to the visual tectum and now"
"when there's this weird patch of itchy"
"tissue on your tail"
"you can somehow tell that this is visual"
"data and incorporated into your"
"behavioral repertoire immediately"
"without year you know without eons of"
"evolutionary um tinkering to"
"get the connections right basically many"
"of these eyes synapse onto the spinal"
"cord uh and so on and so um so so that"
"that already starts to introduce this"
"notion of of plasticity and the idea"
"that this whole system isn't just"
"hardwired to be what it is"
"it has a lot of flexibility in terms of"
"getting functional outcomes from from"
"the situation that it's in"
"and uh let's take that one step further"
"and look at what happens at uh in in"
"situations where you don't have a single"
"static brain which is what we're used to"
"when we think about mammals you know"
"you're an adult and you have a brain and"
"that's that"
"um here's a caterpillar this caterpillar"
"is a kind of soft-bodied robot you can"
"think of it as it crawls and it chews uh"
leaves
"and it needs to be transformed into a"
"hard-bodied robot which is going to fly"
"and drink nectar and in between that"
"transition it undergoes metamorphosis"
"where the"
"the brain is largely liquefied"
"most of the synapses are broken most of"
"the cells die and a new brain is formed"
"that is appropriate to drive a"
"completely different type of machine the"
"amazing thing is that memories persist"
"through this process so so if you train"
"a and this is also also happens to be"
"the work of doug blackiston um if you um"
"if you if you train a a caterpillar then"
"the moth or the butterfly that results"
"from it uh remembers the original"
"information okay on the behavioral"
"in behavioral assets and so the ability"
"of memory to persist through radical"
"reconstruction of the brain is very"
"interesting because first of all it's it"
"it really um asks a lot of our theories"
"of how information is stored in the"
"brain because it has to survive can"
complete
"a remodeling of the substrate and"
"certainly we don't have any technology"
"that's able to do that uh and it also"
"reminds us that bodies and brains"
"can change drastically during the"
"lifetime of the agent not not just at an"
"evolutionary time scale and if you want"
"more information on this there's a um"
"there's a review here that you can take"
"a look at"
"so uh the the champion of this kind of"
"thing is uh is are these uh planaria and"
"so these are flatworms they are"
"similar to our direct ancestors they"
"have a true brain with the same"
"neurotransmitters that you and i have"
"they have central nerve cord and uh the"
"cool thing about planaria which you'll"
"hear more about momentarily is that you"
"can cut them into pieces and every piece"
"will grow exactly what's needed no more"
"no less to be a perfect little worm so"
"they've got this sort of holographic uh"
"storage of patterning information and"
"every piece will give rise to a complete"
"worm they are also immortal they don't"
"age and so we can talk about that later"
"but uh the cool thing about or one of"
"many cool things about planarium are"
"that if you train a planarian you can"
"amputate its brain and you know in fact"
"the whole head the tail will sit there"
"doing nothing for about a week then it"
"will grow a new brain and then once the"
"head is complete it will start to"
"exhibit behavior and uh it will then"
"show you that it remembers the original"
"training so in this case we see two"
"things going on we see that learning"
"is able to imprint information across"
"apparently throughout the the body not"
"just limited to the brain and we see"
"that that information can be imprinted"
"back onto a new brain created from"
"scratch from the from the stem cells in"
"the planarian and uh and that"
"information can be imprinted it's very"
"interesting to to look at and think"
"about information uh traversing through"
"the body right traversing from one"
"tissue into another tissue back and"
"forth to the brain"
"so in our group we are interested in"
"cognition across levels of scale so we"
"think about information processing and"
"computation in everything from molecular"
"networks like like gene regulatory"
"networks to uh cytoskeletal systems to"
"tissues and organs and then of course"
"the whole organisms whether through"
"behavior or through morphogenesis and"
"swarm cognition and so on so you can see"
"here this is a simple scale of all the"
"different kinds of from the very"
"simplest passive behavior to all the way"
"up to second order uh metacognition and"
"all the different"
"steps along the way of making comp"
cognition
"in different different scales so so we"
"want to ask a few questions today um"
"what do brains actually do how general"
"are the things that they do do only"
"brains do these things or are brain's"
"just a special case um where did they"
"come from and why does it matter okay"
"these are the things i will talk about"
"so the main points for of today i know"
"it's been a long day so um i'd like to"
"uh bring out the main points early"
"um here's what i'm going to try to tell"
"you that first of all uh brains evolved"
by
"speed optimizing ancient problem-solving"
"mechanisms and strategies that you that"
"evolution first perfected in other"
"spaces later it became for solving"
"problems in three-dimensional behavior"
space
"but originally this was for solving"
"problems in metabolic transcriptional"
"and anatomical spaces and i'll show you"
"what that means"
"and i'm going to introduce you to a"
"concept of developmental bioelectricity"
"which uh illustrates the origin of"
"neural networks uh as"
"as this uh this this ancient process and"
"points to a really interesting roadmap"
"in regenerative medicine including"
"medicine of the brain itself"
"and uh i'm going to introduce the"
"concept of anatomical homeostasis which"
"is a new model system for basal"
"cognition it's a non-neural kind of"
"substrate that has goal directed"
"activity it has intelligent problem"
"solving it even has representation and"
"counterfactuals i'll show you examples"
"and we'll close by thinking a little bit"
"about synthetic bioengineering and the"
"fact that it now provides an"
"astronomically large option space for"
"new bodies and new minds that have have"
"an interesting relationship with"
"evolution because they are engineered"
"and thus have no direct"
"selection backstory that you can use to"
"explain their their their capacities"
"so uh let's start off with uh anatomical"
"homeostasis and the collective"
"intelligence of groups of cells solving"
"problems in amorphous space i want to"
"first introduce this this idea of"
"navigate of intelligence as navigating"
"arbitrary problem spaces you know we're"
"all familiar with uh animals doing"
"clever things to uh illustrate various"
"degrees of intelligence in physical"
"three-dimensional space okay they're"
"moving around in position and here you"
"know two dimensional space the colors"
"represent good and bad regions of space"
"so you navigate this space and you know"
"life over here isn't very good so you"
"sort of figure out how to get around"
"various obstacles and now and now you're"
"here okay but the the same thing"
"cells and tissues do the same thing in"
"transcriptional space which is very high"
"dimensional space of gene activity"
"the same thing in morphospace which is"
"the the space of possible anatomical"
"configurations right you can think about"
"all the different shapes of beaks of"
"birds given by a couple of different"
"variables that lay out amorphous space"
"and and physiological space which is"
"again a complex space of lots of"
"physiological parameters and all systems"
"need to navigate these kinds of spaces"
"and one example uh that that has come"
"out of our lab is that this is just an"
"example of navigating physiological and"
"transcriptional spaces that"
"we take planaria and you put them in a"
"solution of barium the barium uh blocks"
"all potassium channels their heads"
"explode because without potassium flux"
"your cells don't do very well their"
"heads explode but amazingly uh within a"
"few weeks the the or um"
"or a week or so the planaria grow back a"
"new head and the new head is barium"
"insensitive so in other words you leave"
"them in the barium and eventually they"
"grow a new head that doesn't care at all"
"about the barrier and when you ask"
"transcriptionally what's different with"
"these barium adapted heads to the normal"
"heads what you find is a very small"
"number just a handful of genes that were"
altered
"their transcription was altered to make"
"them barium adapted and so this is an"
"incredible uh navigation of"
"of transcriptional and and physiological"
"space because"
"you these these tissues are hit with a"
"stressor that they've never seen before"
"barium doesn't occur in the wild so so"
"it's not like there's some evolutionary"
"um preparation for this uh and yet they"
"figure out out of this incredible uh"
"combinatorial space of genes that they"
"could turn on and off they figure out a"
"small number that is enough to solve"
"their their problem so how do they do"
"that we don't know but it's an example"
"of of navigation of of other spaces and"
"in general your intelligence is your"
"competency in navigating these spaces"
"without getting stuck in local optima so"
"in behavioral space it looks like this"
"right the closest if this if this animal"
"wants to get to these animals the"
"closest line is here and if you're just"
"trying to"
"minimize the distance you're just going"
"to stand there with your with your face"
"pressed into the into the fence"
"but if you were smarter you could walk"
"around and really get to your uh really"
"get to your goal except that that"
"requires you to have some patience"
"because first you're going to move"
"further away so you have to you have to"
"get around this local optimum and have"
"some have some tolerance for getting"
"further from your goal in order to get"
"to where you need to go so depending on"
"your intelligence how you navigate these"
"these spaces i want to kind of"
"generalize this idea of behavior problem"
"solving and navigation uh beyond"
"three-dimensional space"
"so now let's talk about um anatomical"
"morphospace uh we all start life as a"
"ball of cells these are embryonic"
"blastomeres and then they create this"
"this is the cross section through a"
"human torso so this is notice the"
"incredible complexity of uh where all"
"the different organs and tissues and"
"structures everything tends to end up in"
"the correct uh size and position and"
"orientation relative to each other where"
"does that pattern come from well you"
"might think it's in the dna although we"
"can now read genomes and none of this is"
"in the g you can't read any of this"
"stuff directly from a genome it's in the"
"genome as protein sequences"
"and so the the descriptions of the fine"
"level hardware that every cell gets to"
"play with but what we still don't really"
"know is how do cell groups decide what"
"to make and when to stop and in"
"regenerative medicine we ask okay if"
"you're missing a piece of this"
"how do we convince the cells to grow it"
"back okay and as engineers we want to"
"know well what else is possible using"
"these same cells could we convince them"
"to build something completely different"
"so now this is uh what an individual"
"cell might look like this is a lacrim"
area
"you can see this this creature it's"
"hunting in its environment uh look at"
"look at the incredible competency for"
"goals at the single cell level so all of"
"its metabolic needs its physiological um"
"morphological and behavioral goals are"
"handled at the level of one cell there's"
"no brain there's no nervous system"
"there's no cell to cell communication"
"there are no stem cells one cell this is"
"real time one cell is doing all of this"
"okay and so the real uh puzzle then is"
uh
"how and why do these cells get together"
to
"work towards much larger goals and so"
"you can see here this dynamic uh oops"
"you can see here this dynamic rescaling"
"of um of goals because in multicellular"
"bodies these types of these cells work"
"together to do something like this they"
"you know here's a salamander arm the"
"salamander arm has been chopped off"
"and it will progressively regrow an"
"exact salamander arm so here all the"
"cells are cooperating towards this very"
"large goal no no individual cell knows"
"what a finger is or how many fingers you"
"have or anything like that but the"
"collective does and it stops when it's"
"done so so multicellularity causes"
"individual cells to cooperate towards"
"very large scale goals but then that"
"expansion of gold space can actually"
"shrink down again during the"
"individual's lifetime and that's known"
"as cancer because individual cells can"
"in fact isolate electrically and"
"physiologically isolate from the network"
"that is working on this and basically"
"roll back to a unicellular um a"
"unicellular lifestyle and just be just"
"act like an amiga and at that point it"
"just treats the rest of the animal as"
"external environment"
"so this this the scale of of goal"
"directed activity can shrink and um and"
"grow and so um and these are these are"
"glioblastoma these are happening to be"
"human glioblastoma cells and so um this"
"is what we see we see that that the"
"single cell egg will eventually"
"self-assemble into this uh"
"these massively complex anatomical"
"outcomes and it's not just a stem cell"
"biology problem because"
"you know this is a teratoma it has hair"
"and skin and teeth and bone and muscle"
"but um so so the stem cell"
"differentiation part went swimmingly"
"here but what's wrong is the um the"
"three-dimensional organization that's"
"why this is a tumor and not an actual"
animal
"and so uh in developmental biology uh we"
"are taught this you know sort of feed"
forward
"uh kind of a kind of system where gene"
"regulatory networks um"
"uh turn each other genes turn each other"
"on and off and some of them make"
"effector proteins that are sticky or"
"they exert some force or they're uh they"
"diffuse or whatever and then"
"all of this happens in parallel uh and"
"there's this magical process of"
"emergence and outcomes this complex uh"
"uh this is complex anatomy and and"
"certainly it's true that um many many"
"many complex things are emergent in in"
nature
"but uh this feed forward kind of system"
"makes some makes makes regenerative"
"medicine difficult"
"because if you want to make changes out"
here
"but you're focused on uh on on this"
"scheme you have to ask yourself well"
"what do i do at this level what genes do"
"i turn on and off to make specific"
"changes out here and that in general is"
"very difficult that's an inverse problem"
"that's very hard so what we are good at"
"in molecular biology is getting this"
"kind of data right which genes and"
proteins
"affect which other genes and proteins"
"what we really care about is where does"
"anatomy come from why does your leg not"
"look like your arm what would you have"
"to tell these cells what kind of stimuli"
"would you have to give them to make to"
"fill in part of a complex structure like"
"your ear that's that's missing"
"so in order to think about that we note"
that
um
"there's flexibility and which we already"
"saw some of that in the first few slides"
"i showed you there's flexibility at"
"every point so embryogenesis is reliable"
"but it's not hardwired so if you cut an"
"early embryo in half you don't get two"
"half embryos you get two perfectly"
"normal monozygotic twins"
"uh if you have a newt and uh the the the"
"newt makes a kidney tubule of the size"
"and here are the cells working together"
"to do that and you force the cells to be"
"enormous by polyploidy so you force"
"these cells to have incorrect number of"
"chromosomes they"
"the cells get bigger and bigger at some"
"point well fewer and fewer cells will"
"participate in making the exact same"
"size two aluminum and at some point one"
"single cell will wrap around itself and"
"still give you the exact same lumen so"
"think about what this means a large"
"scale anatomical goal having this"
"topology of this of this lumen of a"
"certain size"
"is uh can be implemented by diverse"
"molecular mechanisms either by cell to"
"cell communication when the cells are"
"the right size or by cytoskeletal"
"bending when the cells are huge so"
"multiple low-level molecular components"
"can be activated in different contexts"
"in service of a large-scale anatomical"
"goal okay flexible flexible ways to get"
"to the same point and more in anatomical"
"amorphous space by using different paths"
"at the at the at the level of the"
"molecular details okay"
"and so um this this uh of course is is"
"the the old limb regeneration uh"
"phenomenon the these are these are"
"axolotls um axolotls regenerate their"
"eyes their jaws their their their spinal"
"cords their limbs their ovaries uh"
"portions of the brain and heart and um"
"the amazing thing about regeneration"
"first of all is that it uh works only to"
"make exactly what's needed so if you"
"amputate at the shoulder it starts here"
"and it makes the whole limb if you"
"amputate it at the elbow it starts here"
"and makes the whole limb and then the"
"most amazing thing about regeneration"
"which hardly anybody works on is the"
"fact that it stops"
"everybody's working on trying to kick"
"start regeneration but"
"what we still don't know is um why does"
"it stop and it stops when when does it"
"stop when it has"
"created the correct salamander arm"
"how does the system know what a correct"
"salamander arm looks like right because"
"the steps it gets it takes to go there"
"are different and in particular we found"
"some years ago"
"that uh"
"this is uh the the the this plasticity"
"is everywhere like if you take um"
"this is a this is a tap attack a normal"
"tadpole here and tadpoles to become"
"frogs have to rearrange their face so"
"they have to move their jaws their"
"nostrils their eyes here are the eyes"
"this is the brain this is the nostrils"
"they have to move all that to be a frog"
"and it used to be thought that the"
"genetics specifies a set of hardwired"
"movements after all all tackles look the"
"same and all frogs look the same so if"
"you just uh specify where where you're"
"going to go then you get a frog so we we"
"tested that by making what we call"
"picasso tackles everything's in the"
"wrong place the eyes are on the back of"
"the head the jaws are off to the side"
"everything's moved around"
"and amazingly those animals make pretty"
"normal frogs because all the different"
"organs move around through unnatural"
"paths and in fact sometimes they double"
"back and have to have to um they"
"overshoot and have to double back"
"until they get to a correct frog phase"
"so what the gen x actually gives you is"
"a system that uh is able to execute"
"error reduction that it's able to"
"minimize the delta between what's going"
"on now in this case a total of mess and"
"what it knows is the correct pattern"
"so and in fact if we think about gold"
"directed behavior in various spaces in"
"this case an anatomical amorphous space"
"there's a couple of um there's a couple"
"of features that's important it should"
"be able to do that despite perturbations"
"and i just showed you we can do that"
"with embryos it should be able to do"
"that from diverse starting positions and"
"you saw that because we can cut the leg"
"at any position and it should be able to"
"do that via different paths here's an"
"example this is a frog that we've"
"induced to regenerate its leg so"
"normally frogs don't do that but we have"
"a regenerative treatment that i'll show"
"you in a minute"
"that kick starts um this regenerative"
"cascade eventually makes a very nice"
"frog leg"
"but uh"
"what you can see is that the"
"intermediate stages here look absolutely"
"nothing like uh frog leg development"
"frog legs develop as a paddle and then"
"there's a bunch of apoptosis that kills"
"off the tissue between then that's how"
"you get toes that's not how this"
"regenerate works it's almost like a"
"meristem it looks much more like a plant"
"it makes a central stalk with a toe a"
"toenail on the end and then it makes the"
"toes and then eventually everything"
"grows and you get a nice frog leg so the"
"ability to get to the same point via"
"different paths through the space is a"
"hallmark of gold directed behavior you"
"know what your goal is and you can"
"deviate if you need to and still and"
"still get there"
"so what we've been working on is this"
"idea that uh"
"of anatomical homeostasis"
"it's not simply a feed forward product"
"that the process that just creates a"
"complex outcome there are in fact"
"feedback loops both at the level of"
"genetics and physics that uh continue to"
"try to get to the state despite"
"perturbations so uh injury mutations"
"teratogens whatever it may be"
"anything that deviates from this uh set"
"point is uh is going to activate"
"processes to try to get you back there"
"now this the general loop is very"
"familiar it's what happens in your"
"thermostat um"
"uh it and and it's uh it's it's what"
"makes goal directedness not be magic"
"it's it's uh control theory or"
"cybernetics uh we we have a mature"
"theory of um mechanisms that are that"
"pursue goals like thermostats and uh but"
"but there's a couple of and of course"
"feedback is is not um not new for"
"biologists everybody knows there's feed"
"there's all kinds of feedback but"
there's
"there's one thing that's that's"
"interesting which is that in this case"
"the set point what we call the target"
"morphology it's not a single number like"
"ph or hunger level or something like"
that
"it's uh it's it's a complex uh it's a"
"complex thing it's a it's a rough"
"description of the large-scale anatomy"
"that you're trying to correct to so that"
"that's that point"
"and uh that kind of um operation towards"
"a particular goal is not something that"
"uh but by all molecular biologists and"
"developmental biologists particularly"
"love people like emergence they like"
chemistry
"working towards a goal sounds uh sounds"
"a little a little scary even though it"
shouldn't
"and um so so we wanted to test this and"
"it makes a very strong prediction"
"the prediction that this weird way of"
"looking at things makes is that"
"if it's true that that this system in"
"some way stores a representation of what"
"the correct pattern is and any"
"homeostatic process has to do that it"
"has to store a set point somewhere"
"then we ought to be able to target that"
"homeostatic set point we ought to be"
"able to rewrite this pattern memory we"
"have to find it first and we have to"
"decode it then we have to learn to"
"rewrite it if we ever"
"be able to rewrite it"
"then we could we could uh ask the cells"
"to build something completely different"
"without having to rewire them so the"
"nice thing about thermostat like"
"circuits is that you can change the set"
"point you don't have to rewire your"
"thermostat you have to change anything"
"about the structure of it you just"
"change the set point and so that would"
"be nice for for regenerative medicine"
"because you wouldn't have to rewire"
"genetically your your cells you could"
"leave them alone and simply"
"change the setpoint so so where is this"
"where is the setpoint and this is this"
"is what i want to um talk about now i"
"want to point out simply that um these"
"these cognitive-like properties of"
"homeostasis uh such as flexibility"
"robustness goal directed activity and so"
"on uh even the fathers of developmental"
"biology here's hans speyman saying you"
"know over a hundred years ago that"
"terms that people use in this process"
"which point to not only physical but"
"psychical and it means"
"psychological or cognitive analogies uh"
"was not just meant to be a political um"
"uh metaphor was actually it was actually"
"informative and and in fact and"
"grossberg picked it up again in the 70s"
"talking about the relationship between"
"memory and development and and all of"
"this is actually very deep um and we've"
"been we've been working on this for for"
"some years now so i want to show you how"
"that how that happens so this this part"
"of the talk is is how uh these kinds of"
"decisions of the goal uh the goal um"
"directed activity of cellular agents how"
"it's actually implemented the mechanisms"
"and um"
"basically what it is that uh that in"
"their own simple proto-cognitive way"
that
"that body tissues think about"
"and uh you will not be shocked to"
"discover that it's exactly the same"
"mechanism that brains use so in the"
"brain let's just get comfortable uh with"
"with the um the the framework here in"
"the brain you have the hardware which"
"are is a is a network of of neural cells"
"and then the the electrical activity and"
"the electrochemical um"
uh
"downstream activity uh"
"produces or or enables a kind of a kind"
"of software which um people who work on"
"neural decoding and things like this uh"
"the commitment of neuroscience is that"
"if we just understood the encoding we"
"could track the electrical activity and"
"from that decode and extract the the"
"mental content so we would know what the"
"animal was thinking about what it memory"
"what memories were what the preferences"
"are if we could extract the information"
"in this electrical activity and so"
"what's key here is that this particular"
"uh system uses the electrical activity"
to
"the output of the system is to trigger"
"muscles to move the body through more"
"through three-dimensional space and this"
"is how it uh it solves problems by"
"moving around by by issuing commands to"
"muscles to move around in 3d space"
"and and you can and you can influence it"
"by yes rewiring at the level of genetic"
"change and surgery and so on but you can"
"also change its activities via"
"experiences um neurotransmitter drugs"
"ion channel drugs you know and so on"
"so so it turns out that uh here's here's"
"the the important point that"
"all tissues in your body do this so um"
"basically what i'm going to show you is"
"that uh"
"electrical networks in uh in in other"
"tissues that are non-brain and"
"non-neural likewise drive physiological"
"uh software which um"
"among many other things moves the body"
"configuration through morph of space the"
"outputs of this system are not muscle"
"motions that move you in 3d space but"
"reconfigurations of gene expression of"
"cell shape cell proliferation cell"
"migration and so on that move your"
"anatomical descriptor through anatomical"
"space and we're basically um doing a"
"neuroscience outside the nervous system"
"by asking could we decode this this"
"happens to be a frog embryo and you're"
"looking at all the voltage of all the"
"voltage-based communications between the"
"cells could we decode this and learn to"
"read and write this anatomical"
"information and so um what i'm telling"
"you is that much like in the brain where"
"ion channels allow neurons to acquire"
"voltage states and pass them on through"
"electrical synapses to their neighbors"
"all cells do this every cell has ion"
"channels most cells have"
"gap junctions to their neighbors and"
"it's it's very likely that uh most of"
"the cool tricks that brains do are"
"basically um speed optimized versions of"
"things that tissues have been doing uh"
"basically evolution discovered this"
"scheme around the time of bacterial"
"biofilms there's some beautiful work"
"showing that even bacterial biofilms are"
"very very brain-like usage of electrical"
"modalities to"
"coordinate across distance spread"
"information keep memories and so on"
"so we developed some some tools to uh"
"besides the voltage imaging that you"
"just saw"
"we developed some functional tools and"
"it's very important to say that we do"
"not use applied electric fields there's"
"no magnetics here there's no"
"electromagnetics there are no waves or"
"fields we don't use electrodes"
"everything here is molecular physiology"
"so we basically have just two main"
"classes of uh of intervention we can"
"change the topology of the tissue"
meaning
"which cell electrically connects to each"
"other cell by opening and closing or"
"mutating these gap junctions and this is"
"the equivalent of synaptic plasticity"
"or we can go in and directly change the"
"voltage state of individual cells which"
"by by opening and closing various"
"channels you can do this through"
"optogenetics through drug blockers"
"through mutation and this is the"
"equivalent of intrinsic plasticity and"
"so at the single cell level one of the"
"cool things you can do with this is uh"
"is is um"
"in the in the field of cancer so"
"when we inject an oncogene a human"
"oncogene into uh into a tadpole they"
"make this tumor and uh even before the"
"tumor becomes anatomically apparent you"
"can already see the uh the the aberrant"
"bioelectrical signaling of these cells"
"that are basically disconnected from the"
"rest of the tissue that's what oncogenes"
"do the first thing they do is disconnect"
"the cell from its neighbors and then"
"they acquire a an aberrant bioelectrical"
"state that basically rolls them back"
"towards an ancient amoeba-like single"
"cell existence at which point the rest"
"of the body is just environment and all"
"it's going to do is make as many copies"
"of itself and and go wherever life is"
good
"and so we've shown that you can"
"interfere with this process by you"
"inject your oncogene but at the same"
"time you inject an ion channel that"
"forces the cell into the correct uh"
"bioelectric state with its neighbors and"
"there even though the oncogene here is"
"strongly very strongly expressed"
"there's no tumor because uh because the"
"cells are now being forced to"
"participate in normal morphogenesis"
"instead of rolling back to a"
"kind of ancient existence and so"
"even more importantly than than this"
"kind of single cell type of behavior"
"here's what happens in uh in in vivo"
"so so this is an early frog embryo and"
"uh it's been stained with a"
"voltage-sensitive fluorescent dye that's"
"showing us all of the different uh"
"information processing"
"events here this is one frame taken from"
"that movie it happens to be grayscale it"
"doesn't matter"
"the colors are voltage uh states and so"
"you can see that even before the genes"
"come on that they're going to pattern"
"the face"
"all of the major features are already"
"here in this electrical pre-pattern"
"here's where the eye is going to be"
"here's where the mouth is going to be"
"the placards all of this is already here"
"as we call this the electric face"
"and if you make changes for example by"
"mutating ion channels or uh using ion"
"channel drugs then you uh induce changes"
"in the downstream gene expression and"
"changes in the anatomy this is uh what"
"happens in a lot of human"
"channelopathies where they have"
"craniofacial and other types of defects"
"precisely because of this so this is an"
"endogenous pattern that is required for"
"normal morphogenesis it is instructive"
"for the formation of the face because"
"when you change it the formation of the"
"face is altered so um so using these"
"these techniques we said okay um could"
"we use this to write new information"
"into the uh bioelectric um"
"computations that these tissues are"
"using to uh to undergo morphogenesis and"
"so you can do some interesting things"
"you can make um five-legged uh you can"
"make five-legged frogs by asking uh the"
"the jaw to make a new um to make a new"
"limb and this is uh this is an"
"optogenetic frog line that we made"
"um you can also do things like this"
"we'll take an ion channel inject it into"
"some cells that are going to be gut"
"and uh and and will induce an electrical"
"state that um a pattern electrical"
"pattern that basically says build an eye"
"here and uh and sure enough the cells"
"will build an eye um"
"a couple of important things here one is"
"that you may have read in the"
"developmental biology textbook that only"
"cells in the anterior neurectoderm out"
"here are competent to make eye this is"
"true if you stick with molecular"
"inducers like pac-6 is supposed to be"
"the master ig then the only place it"
"works is out here but if you go upstream"
"and uh and and address the um"
"uh the the sort of modular components"
"that are encoded in these electrical"
"networks you can ask any piece of the"
"animal to make an eye including the tail"
"and so on um that's that's one"
"interesting thing another interesting"
"thing is that this is extremely modular"
"so we didn't provide all the information"
"needed to specify the structure of an"
"eye in fact we have no idea how to"
specify
"the structure of an eye and uh doing it"
"by cell type and gene expression would"
"take forever it would be you know"
"i don't i don't think that's going to"
"happen in our lifetime"
"but what we did do was to find"
"by treating the system as a"
"as a as a as a computational uh system"
"which is um"
uh
"which has which has modularity and"
"plasticity we identified a trigger a"
"trigger of the eye making subroutine the"
"ammo already knows how to make an eye we"
"don't need to know we can provide a"
"simple bioelectrical trigger that"
"kickstarts that whole process and this"
"will be important in a minute also"
"as an interesting instructive aspect to"
"this where this is a lens sitting out in"
"the flank of a tadpole somewhere the"
"blue cells marked with beta gal are the"
"ones that we injected with a channel"
"these other cells here are wild type"
"cells that we never altered they were"
"recruited by these cells to participate"
"with them in making a"
"normal nice round lens so these cells"
"are able to get their neighbors to work"
"together on this much larger uh"
"structure not just it's not just that"
"these cells you know we induced"
"electrically cells to differentiate"
"towards a lens lineage that's not it at"
"all it's that we we told the whole"
"region to make a lens and now uh"
"everybody's going to participate within"
"a certain radius and it's not it's not a"
"single cell phenotype"
"uh one of the most uh uh one of the most"
"sort of advanced applications of this"
"was was here where we actually uh used a"
"computational platform that was"
"created to make a model of brain damage"
"so here's what a normal xenopus brain"
"looks like for brain midbrain hindbrain"
"here's uh one that's mutated where the"
"notch gene right very important"
"neurogenesis gene is mutated the brain"
"is a big bubble forebrain is gone the"
"midbrain and high brain are just a"
"bubble they have no behavior no iq"
"um with the same thing you can do with"
"with uh with nicotine alcohol various"
"other strategies and what we've shown is"
"that if you make a model of this process"
"computationally in in terms of what the"
"bioelectric states are you can ask the"
"model questions like if i wanted to get"
"back to normal after a mutation or after"
"i've been hit with nicotine or alcohol"
"what channels would i open and close to"
"get me a nice"
"a nice sharp demarcation on of a correct"
"brain size and shape and the model told"
"us it happened to be the hcn2"
"hcn2 channel we uh we we used drug um"
"activators of hcn2 and of course before"
"that this expression of hcn2 we tried"
"that too and it basically rescues the"
"brain despite having a notch mutation a"
"very very strong dominant notch mutation"
"you get normal brain shape back you get"
"normal brain gene expression and you get"
"their iqs back these animals can learn"
"again and so"
"so so this is important the bioelectrics"
"the state of developmental"
"bioelectricity is not simply that uh"
"we can make changes and make you know"
"weird monsters the idea is that this is"
now
"to the point where we can make rational"
"repairs to a very complex organ by"
"understanding the dynamics"
"of the electric circuits in the in the"
"in the tissue right and we can use these"
"models these high resolution models we"
"can use them to uh to predict drugs"
"basically right as as as electrostatic"
"and this is another application of this"
"where uh we we did this for the for the"
"frog leg"
uh
"coming up with a cocktail that um that"
"that induces leg regeneration and this"
"is where i have to do a disclosure"
"because uh david kaplan and i are"
"co-founders in um in a company called"
"morphaceuticals inc where we're trying"
"this now in in mice so the idea is to go"
"into mammals and try for leg"
"regeneration in mammals so this is a"
"there's a company involvement here"
"okay so"
"one of the um one of the things that i"
"really want to talk about is uh you know"
"i promised you um anatomical morphostat"
"morphostasis as in a kind of this like"
"homeostatic process as a as a"
"a new model system for basal cognition"
"so i've shown you goal directedness and"
"i've shown you modularity and and and"
"flexibility and plasticity and"
"robustness now i want to show you memory"
"so here's here's an example of of of"
"memory so here's here's our our flatworm"
again
"this is a one-headed flower and this"
"one-headed platform not surprisingly has"
"anterior gene expression in the head and"
"no anterior gene expression in the tail"
"okay and if i amputate the head and the"
"tail this middle fragment will give rise"
"to a nice one-headed worm 100 of the"
"time very very stable very reliable"
"now here's another worm one head one"
"tail anatomically normal uh"
"anterior um interior gene in the in the"
"front no anterior gene in the back fine"
"i amputate this guy head and tail and"
"now i get a two-headed worm and this is"
"not photoshopped this is a real real"
"live two-headed worm"
"now why why in the world would this"
"would this animal give me a two-headed"
outcome
"because in the middle uh what i did was"
"i took this this this intact animal and"
"we induced two regions bio so this is a"
"bioelectrical map that you're looking"
"from this voltage sensitive dye whereas"
"a normal worm has one region of"
"depolarization that says make one head"
"this animal and it's kind of messy right"
"the middle is all messy the technology"
"is still um being being perfected but"
"what we did here was we induced two"
"areas of strong depolarization"
"equivalent as we now know because we"
"decoded it it means make two heads and"
"sure enough if you cut that animal it"
"makes two heads now here's the really"
"critical portion"
"this electrical map is not a map of this"
"two-headed animal"
"this electrical map is a map of this"
"one-headed animal meaning the electrical"
"distribution is not a"
"a readout of what the anatomy is doing"
"and the same exact anatomy can give"
"right can can hold on to one of two"
"probably a lot more but we know for sure"
"one of two different ideas of what a"
"correct planarian is supposed to look"
"like so the anatomy and the bioelectric"
"pattern do not need to match they are"
"the electricity is not a reflection of"
"what the anatomy is doing conversely"
"it's a latent memory that sits there"
"doing nothing until the animal gets"
"injured when the animal gets injured the"
"cells consult this map and see that uh"
"we need to make two two heads and sure"
"enough they build two heads so that's"
"what i try to illustrate here in that a"
"single piece of hardware can can hold"
"one of two different memories target"
"morphologies that guide regeneration to"
"a correct"
"point and when does it stop it doesn't"
"stop when it's made one head it stops"
"after it's made two heads because the"
"target morphology pattern is stored in"
"the standing electrical pattern of the"
"circuit which is which can be rewritten"
"okay and so this is an example of a"
"counter factual memory this animal uh"
"has a memory of what it's going to do if"
"it gets injured in the future not what"
"it's doing right now but what it's going"
"to do in the future if it gets injured"
"and this i think is the basis of of of"
"counterfactual um kind of like the very"
"basement you know simple version of what"
"later on in brains became really"
"powerful uh technologies of um"
"uh uh imagining what you're gonna do in"
"the future right thinking about things"
"that are not happening right now and the"
"other reason i keep calling this a"
"memory is because it is long-term stable"
"so if i take this two-headed worm and i"
"cut off uh if i make a two-headed woman"
"cut off the heads this piece will"
"continue to make two-headed animals in"
"perpetuity in plain water no more"
"manipulations of any kind forever and"
"then we can reset it back to one headed"
"so this system is long-term stable it's"
"rewritable it has latency or conditional"
"recall and it has discrete outcomes this"
"is all the hallmarks of memory and here"
"you can see these two-headed worms this"
"is this is you know what two-headed"
"worms do in their spare time"
"not only can we ask the system to um to"
"make two heads we can ask it to make"
"heads belonging to other species so if i"
"take a planarian with a nice triangular"
head
"i can cut off that head prevent this uh"
"this this"
"remaining tissue from"
"having the correct bioelectrical"
"computations that that that lead it to"
"the uh"
"through the attractor in the in the"
"amorphous space of a one headed of of a"
"triangular head and they can make"
"flatheads they can basically fall into"
"the wrong attractor they can make"
"flatheads like this p felina they can"
"make roundheads like this s"
mediterranean
"or they can make their normal triangular"
"heads and this is not just for head head"
"shape this is also for the brain shape"
"it makes the brain shape appropriate to"
"these other species it distribution of"
"stem cells same thing"
"not only can we make uh heads"
"appropriate to other species remember"
"without any genetic change both here and"
"in the two-headed worms i showed you the"
"genome is wild type there was no changes"
"of um no changes of there's no genomic"
"editing no you know there's nothing"
"wrong with the genome this is all"
"information that's stored in the"
"electrical circuit where have we seen"
"this before neuroscience right when you"
"when you learn you have you have um you"
"have a brain that can"
"that can learn uh information that is"
"distinct from uh the the genetics of the"
"physical structure i can learn new"
"things not just not just what was in the"
genome
"we can go further and we can uh sample"
"some attractors in the space that"
"evolution doesn't uh doesn't use because"
"they're not uh ecologically uh you know"
"competitive so you can make we can make"
"these these spiky forms we can make"
"these cylindrical kinds of things that"
"look like a hat we can make this this"
"animal which is sort of a flat one but"
"then it's got this three-dimensional"
"tube coming out of its back uh lots of"
"things that wild-type cells are willing"
"to build"
"if the target morphology is is rewritten"
"to something else"
"so the summary of what i told you so far"
"are that uh bodies are extremely plastic"
"they harness low low level uh various"
"molecular pathways towards specific"
"system level"
"outcomes both in the anatomical space"
"and what we haven't even had time to"
"talk about which is physiological space"
"and transcription space"
"like in the brain this is in part"
"mediated by a bioelectrical and"
"neurotransmitter networks that store"
"these pattern memories that are"
"rewritable in the same within within the"
"same in in place hardware and we can"
"take advantage of a lot of tools and"
"concepts from cognitive science uh and"
"if you're interested in this we have we"
"have a bunch of a bunch of papers on"
"this to target the decision-making by"
"the cellular collective agents and and"
"using those strategies we reached um all"
"kinds of capabilities that were not"
"possible before"
"and so the last piece of the talk that i"
"want to i want to talk about is is the"
"synthetic engineering of shape"
"and darwin"
"famously had this had this line in his"
"book when he was looking out into uh"
"into a i think a riverbank or something"
"and he said there are endless forms most"
"beautiful and uh impressed being"
"impressed with a variety of living"
"living things and um and i want to sort"
"of jack that up to um to a new to a new"
"level so i call it uh 2.0 and in order"
to
"think about that let's let's go back and"
"think about a fundamental knowledge gap"
"and that knowledge gap broadly speaking"
is
"where do the goals of collective"
"intelligences come from that is if you"
"have a a swarm of robots right so a"
"robotic swarm or you have an ant colony"
"or you have a beehive or something where"
uh
"the individual"
"the individual agents are competent to"
"do various things but what's the"
"collective going to do right what does"
"the collective intelligence want how do"
"we um how do we guess and in biology uh"
"this is this is very very clearly seen"
"in um"
"in uh in morphogenesis because here are"
"a bunch of cells that know how to make a"
"flat-headed planarium and they stop when"
"they achieve a flathead this species has"
"a bunch of stem cells that know how to"
"make a round headed planaria and if i do"
"this thought experiment i'm going to say"
"well i'm going to take this animal i'm"
"just going to mix the stem cells right"
"here some red ones here some green ones"
"and then i'm going to wait till they get"
"comfortable and i'm going to cut off the"
"head what shape are they going to build"
"and despite lots of very nice"
"papers in science and nature looking at"
"the molecular pathways of stem cell"
"differentiation in planaria we don't we"
"as a field we don't have a single model"
"of what head shape is going to result"
"none of those things address this in the"
"slightest and nothing that anybody's"
"done um in in this in the in the field"
"of stem cell biology and planaria can"
"tell you what the head shape is going to"
"be because that is"
"the answer to a completely different"
"question it's the question of once we"
"have a collective of these agents these"
cells
"what is their goal state what are they"
"going to build where in morph space are"
"they going to go and uh understanding"
"the molecular biology is is important"
"but it doesn't it doesn't go um all the"
"way to giving you this this answer"
"and so and so i think this is part of"
"this much broader broader issue of when"
"you make things like the internet of"
"things or swarm robotics or even"
"possibly social structures uh"
"understanding what that collective"
"intelligence is going to do is we don't"
"have a science of that yet really and by"
"the way we are all collective"
"intelligences there is no such thing as"
"an indivisible uh intelligent you know"
"cognitive agent we are all made of parts"
"so so every single agent that you're"
"looking at whether it be an animal or or"
"something else uh is a bag of cells and"
"we have to understand how they work"
"together and where do the goals of the"
"larger scale system come from"
"i mean it's easiest to see this in"
"chimeras but it's actually true uh it's"
"actually true in regular animals too so"
"what we try to do and this is this is"
"also doug's work what we try to do is uh"
"to ask this simple question let's just"
"start from scratch and let's say if we"
"take some cells we liberate them from"
"their normal um"
"their normal um environment in the in"
"the embryo and we ask them to reboot"
"their muscles multicellularity do they"
"like to cooperate and if so what are"
"they going to make so i'm going to show"
"you is some experiments where"
"we take skin cells off of a off of a"
"frog embryo we"
"do not genetically manipulate them in"
"any way we put them in a new environment"
"and we ask what they do now if i said i"
"was going to do this you could imagine"
"well what are they going to do well they"
"could die they could persist they could"
"crawl around they could form a monolayer"
"these are the typical things that that"
"you might think cell cells would do i"
"say that ahead of time because because"
"um i you know it's kind of surprising"
"what they do and i want you to think"
"ahead of time"
"what all the other options are this is"
"what they actually do so here are the"
"dissociated skin cells being put in a"
"little depression they overnight they"
"sort of coalesce and they come together"
"they crawl around and then they kind of"
"get together the fluorescence you see"
"here is calcium signaling so pretty"
"quiet at first but then they start this"
"very brain like very neural like kind of"
"thing and uh remember no neurons here"
"just just um uh just skin and what they"
"do is they make this structure that has"
"little hairs on the outside it has cilia"
"and then something amazing happens"
"within a couple days they start swimming"
"around now here's here's one of these"
"things chugging its way um chugging its"
"way along and some of them"
"they can they can go in circles they can"
"go back and forth you can see one"
"patrolling uh patrolling back and forth"
"here um here is a tracking data on"
"half a dozen of these things you know"
"this one's going on a long journey these"
"two are interacting with each other"
"these two are sitting quietly this one"
"goes in circles they have all kinds of"
behavior
"i'm going to show you one that's in a"
"maze this is a still water maze there is"
"no there are no gradients there's no"
"flow there's nothing in here just water"
"and uh"
"and and and here it is moving around i'm"
"gonna i'm gonna run it one more time you"
"can see what what's amazing about this"
"so so here it is starting it's keeping a"
"certain distance from the wall now it's"
"going to take this corner here without"
"bumping into anything so so somehow it"
"takes this corner and then over here"
"it's for some internal reason that we"
"have no idea about it decides to turn"
"around and go back where it came from"
"so it has this ability to interact with"
"its environment to know that it can take"
"a corner some sort of hydrodynamics or"
"something that lets it do this without"
"without hitting the opposite wall and"
"then some some internal change causes it"
"to turn around and go back so they have"
"these um inter they're spontaneous these"
"are we call them xenobots because"
"xenopus lavis is the frog they come from"
"and they're a kind of biobite"
"there's no muscle here there's no brain"
"there's no neurons there's no external"
"pacing there's no external control"
"whatsoever obviously we really want to"
"engineer these things in a million"
"different ways but the first few papers"
"are focusing on their native plasticity"
"because i specifically want to show off"
"what can these things do on their own"
"before we start to engineer them and"
before
"people say well now you've put in all"
"these circuits and of course now they're"
"doing things this is this is bare bones"
um
"baseline plasticity okay this these"
"little proto creatures um they also"
"regenerate so if you cut them in half"
"they will heal and they will close up"
"right here"
"take a look at the the amazing you know"
"when you cut them in half look at that"
"hinge right that hinge right there 180"
"degrees think of the force that it takes"
"to swing this whole thing around like"
"that and get it to uh get it to heal up"
"back to its new xenobot shape and if we"
"track the calcium signaling uh here it"
"is these cells are very active again um"
"no no neurons here but um"
"but you can uh uh you can actually uh"
"you can actually see that that they're"
"that they're quite quite active and so"
"um there's even uh there's even tiny"
"ones that can that can form here's a"
"much smaller one that's about 20 cells"
"and you can see here it looks like a"
"little little horse or dog or something"
"and they move as a group and they have"
"articulated uh pieces such as this and"
"then they they uh they interact with"
"each other that's a calcium calcium"
"signal and so"
"one sometimes the way i give this talk"
"is to uh show all this stuff and i don't"
"tell people what it is and i said what"
"do you think this is and they say well"
"it's probably a"
"some kind of a animal you got off the"
"bottom of a pond somewhere and i said"
"well we've sequenced the genome and said"
"well the genome that's that's great"
"let's let's see you know let's see what"
"we can learn"
"and the genome of course is a hundred"
"percent xenopus lavish okay it's 100"
"fraud and one interesting thing about it"
"is that these uh the behaviors and the"
"morphology of these zenobots uh were not"
"they don't have a straightforward"
"evolutionary backstory meaning they were"
"not selected to do this they did skin it"
"was selected to sit quietly on the"
"outside of a tadpole and keep out the"
"pathogens and then and use the cilia to"
"redistribute mucus and things like this"
"within 48 hours in a novel environment"
without
"eons of of selection pressure for these"
"properties these cells uh put together a"
"novel proto-organism with with new"
"structures and functions and so that um"
"and and we don't know if we're still"
"starting to figure out can they learn"
"what what are their preferences that we"
"we don't know how advanced they're there"
"they are without neurons"
"so so it's really this this novelty this"
"ability to to uh you know come up with a"
"with a functional um with a functional"
"architecture from scratch in 48 hours is"
"incredibly interesting and of course"
"one thing we have to do one thing this"
"helps us do is get beyond this very"
"standard picture this is this is a nice"
"painting this is um adam naming the"
"animals in the garden of eden so this"
"idea is look we have standard species"
"and uh we need to learn about them and"
um
"and they have evolutionary pressure that"
"explains why they have uh specific kinds"
"of eyes and and fur and and they fly and"
"you know all this stuff and uh we need"
"to get way beyond that in fact even even"
"be pre-scientifically people knew that"
"you could start mixing and matching so"
"you could take a horse and a"
"donkey at the genetic level they didn't"
"know it was genetic but you could you"
"could you could you could mate them and"
"you get this weird thing like a mule but"
"we can actually"
"do chimerism at all levels we can mix"
"dna but also milk cells and organs and"
"in fact whole organisms in parabiosis um"
"we are making in our lab we're making"
"frog lottos which are part frog and part"
"axolotl if you want an interesting"
"puzzle ask yourself if you think a frog"
"a lottle will have legs baby axolotls"
"have legs frog embryos don't have legs"
"will a frog a level have legs and why"
"don't we know the answer to that given"
"that we have the frog genome and we have"
"the axolotl genome why can we not use"
"that information to tell what a frog a"
"lot is going to do"
"and people have done things like like"
"put drosophila neurons into rat brains"
"and they live for weeks and then they"
"cooperate with each other and so on so"
"so the future is is chimeric"
"bioengineering where every level of an"
"of an organism uh molecular cellular um"
"and and so on can be replaced with"
"components that are either evolved or"
"designed you know synthetic materials"
"smart uh materials and so on and and be"
"somewhere on this spectrum of um either"
"either something very simple or"
"something that has high level um"
"cognition and behavior and they can be"
"uh put it uh you know replaced anywhere"
"so there's this amazing um uh uh"
"capacity to make new types of living"
"agents which are uh which have never"
"been seen before which don't have a"
"position on the phylogenetic tree which"
"and some of this is already here you"
"know cyborgs and hybrids and humans with"
"with brain and other organ implants and"
"and uh mice linked together um in in"
"groups where their brains are linked"
"together in groups and so on and um you"
"you if you're interested in this kind of"
"stuff take a look we have a paper here"
"where we point out that uh josh bongar"
"and i um point out that"
"these kind of terms uh machine animal"
"robot um synthetic evolved design all of"
"these things were uh pretty good"
categories
um
"20 to 30 years ago they're not good"
"categories anymore uh there are many"
"reasons why these things no longer"
"really pick out um"
"pick out anything um you know sharp and"
"we can we can talk about that"
"and so there are going to be uh we are"
"going in our lifetimes we are going to"
"see a massive explosion of"
"unconventional agents that are partly"
"software partly hardware um and they're"
"going to be uh and in different kinds of"
"biological and designed and evolved um"
"components that are all going to be"
"somewhere along this uh along this"
"continuum okay and and what we're not"
"going to be able to do is to guess where"
"they are by looking at what they're made"
"of and where they came from it used to"
"be that you could look at something and"
"you sort of you knock on it and if you"
"hear a clanging sound you say uh-huh"
"that's uh that's designed and um it's"
"non-living and it's probably not very"
"smart and you can take it apart and it's"
"then it's fine there's no ethical issues"
"and if it was soft and furry and and um"
"you know sort of sort of squishy then"
"you would say yeah that's probably"
"biological and it might have some degree"
"of intelligence because i see a backbone"
"in the brain"
"and then and then uh you know you have"
"to treat it more you know with some some"
"care uh"
"we are going to see something like this"
"all of that everything we know from from"
"the from the phylogeny on earth is going"
"to be here in this like tiny little"
"corner of this huge space of all of the"
possible
"combinations of evolved material from"
"the living world designed material and"
"machines and software agents and this is"
"going to be massive so"
"the conclusions from everything so i'm"
"just going to stop here"
"are these that uh morphogenesis is just"
"one example of uh this kind of"
"protocognitive process and it has a lot"
"to teach us about intelligence and the"
"scaling of cognition and where brains"
"and behavior came from"
"by electrical networks they store and"
"process a kind of pattern memory that"
"controls this journey through uh through"
"anatomical amorphous space and we have"
"lots of there are lots of interesting"
"ideas about using tissue training and uh"
"and and so on um to uh achieve"
"regenerative medicine goals as opposed"
"to micromanaging the um the the hardware"
"of cells so rewiring pathways and things"
"like that"
"and and uh synthetic morphology and"
"these various chimeric techniques so"
"bioengineering not only uh reveals the"
"plasticity of life that is really very"
"poorly understood still and uh we have"
"huge gaps in our knowledge of the"
"mapping between dna and anatomy and"
"where evolutionary novelty comes from"
"and so on uh"
"but but they also um provide a very rich"
"new space for the creation of novel"
"diverse minds whether with brains or"
"without or different kinds of brains"
"that you've never seen before which have"
"to be dealt with with any new uh theory"
"of cognition in fact we have this this"
"this continuum of bodies and minds that"
"completely breaks the current"
"distinctions of what a machine is what"
"an organism is what a robot is"
"we have machines that are evolved now um"
"we have designed organisms and so on all"
"of this requires us to"
"identify the essential concepts not"
"those that are based on contingent"
"things like where did something come"
"from or the various frozen accidents of"
evolution
"and really understand what we mean by a"
"robot or an organism and so on and and"
"i'll just close by saying that this has"
"massive implications for ethics because"
"i don't think uh the kind of thing that"
"we do in a lot of"
"bioengineering um um meetings where we"
"spent time uh worried about uh how much"
"like a human brain is some sort of uh uh"
"construct or uh or organoid right as far"
"as the ethics of it"
"much we have to go much beyond that we"
"have to we have to think about the"
"ethics of relating to uh to living"
"things that are nothing like a human"
brain
"and that doesn't tell us very much about"
"what its cognitive capacities are and"
"what we owe it as as as"
"in terms of ethics okay so um i think"
"the the future the future is it has to"
"deal with this incredible explosion of"
"bodies and minds so um that's it uh if"
"you are interested in this stuff here"
"are some um some papers"
"uh that go into all this in in in great"
"detail and i want to thank the people in"
"my group who participated in producing"
"all of the data that i showed you today"
"and i will uh thank our funders here and"
"i thank you for listening"
"thank you michael michael that was"
"really fascinating"
"we have a few minutes for questions"
"so michael you never disappoint us"
"you always"
"so you are so far ahead of the"
"regulatory agencies that you know"
"you can do whatever experiments you want"
"but are you you should be getting ahead"
"of the science fiction writers now"
"because it isn't science fiction i mean"
"there's a tremendous opportunity for you"
"because i know you're a great writer"
"i'm just giving you some friendly advice"
"as a friend thank you thank you yeah i"
"appreciate it um i i think i think in"
"many ways you're absolutely right in"
"many ways the technology is way beyond"
"the philosophy that has been written"
"about this stuff right so there's all"
"kinds of philosophy of mind that says oh"
"what if you know what if we separate the"
"two halves of the you know the two"
"hemispheres is it one person or we are"
"so far not just us but like the whole"
"field is so far beyond all of that the"
"it it needs to catch up like we need to"
"develop conceptual uh apparatus in many"
"directions to catch up to what the"
"science is now"
"mike fascinating as always thank you"
"tara how are you doing yeah it's good"
"good i was looking forward to talk and"
"as martha said"
"i was never disappointed i mean you kind"
of
"throw us into this ocean"
"of thoughts"
"and i don't know where to find the"
"nearest island to land on"
"but i but let me ask you one very simple"
"question it seems to me from your"
"experiment is that when you when you are"
"showing the voltage map"
"uh when the voltage was coming from two"
"ends and you it was greenish everywhere"
"but with some more intensity towards the"
"two ends"
"and then comes the two eyes from both"
sides
"and what struck me is that"
"it seems like there is some tipping"
"point where"
"the resolution doesn't matter as long as"
"a process gets started so you know"
"you're applying a voltage field and this"
"voltage field has"
has
"far from precision"
"from the image of the voltage die"
"but the eyes are precisely at the"
"asymmetric location on both sides"
so
"does the biology wait for this tipping"
point
"without caring about all the precisions"
"that we as engineers tend to think of"
"like to put the i have to have a voltage"
"field precisely given by this"
"field uh map"
"rather than give me a field map you know"
"just excite me"
"and i will come up with the position"
"that i have defined as a goal yep we've"
"it's a great question um we've seen some"
"of each so for example in the case of"
"the electric face the positions of the"
"bioelectric domains are quite specific"
"about the size and the and the location"
"of the organs so so the the eye spot"
"that's where the eye is going to go and"
"if you move it the eye will be somewhere"
"else so it's quite quite specific there"
"but other other systems when we make"
"when we grow a leg or a tail uh we and"
"we we provide for a kickstart that just"
"basically says start the module start"
"the leg growing module right here and"
"then we don't micromanage it in fact in"
"fact our latest this this paper"
"hopefully will be out in a few weeks we"
"show that in an adult frog you treat the"
"wound for one day 24 hours with a"
"particular um treatment"
"that gives rise to uh a year and a half"
"of leg growth in which at which one we"
"never touch it at all right we stop we"
"stop our intervention at 24 hours after"
"that the is so so what we see generally"
"is that"
"there's an electrical circuit that makes"
"decisions and once it's made that"
"decision so this gets to your tipping"
"point idea once it's made the decision"
"everything is handed off to downstream"
"molecular cascades you start off with"
"the winds and the bmps and the you know"
"msx1 and all of these things and all"
"that stuff runs and and we don't have to"
"micromanage it right it's all so so you"
"don't have to worry about it however you"
"you there there are other aspects for"
"example once it start making toes"
"there's another bioelectrical uh set of"
"um processes that that say well how many"
"toes are you gonna have and if you"
"wanted to intervene there you could i'm"
"sure we haven't done it but i'm sure you"
"could and get a different number of toes"
"so there are different types of like"
"with any engineering system there are"
"different levels of modules there are"
"very high level modules and there are"
"down in the details you know sort of low"
"level modules yeah yeah"
"fascinating i have to leave i have a"
"class to teach at three o'clock i'm"
"already five minutes late"
"bye everybody good to see you bye"
"are there any"
"i do have another question i i mean"
"anyone else who wants to talk can sp"
please
"interrupt but since no one else is and"
"i'm watching for hands now guys"
"especially the trainees"
"i read a report in"
"the new york times my favorite journal a"
"couple weeks ago about"
"super weeds"
"and the fact that if you treat the super"
"weeds oh samuel do you want to ask a"
"question before i finish"
"no you can go ahead and finish then okay"
"okay um"
"and they so these are these are"
"they've put atrazine and you know"
"they've genetically engineered it into"
"soybeans so"
"those soybeans are resistant to the"
"atrazine but weeds are but what's"
"happened is that within five years after"
"monsanto developing it the weeds are"
"getting resistant"
"and that's faster than evolution"
"everybody's like how in the world are we"
"going to keep ahead of the weeds if they"
"can you know accommodate so fast"
"and it's not looking like evolution"
"which made me think of your barium"
"experiments exactly exactly and um"
"so i asked a very wise friend of mine"
"who isn't on this call anymore i won't"
"name who it was but i said you know"
"what's going on he said well"
"most of these at these organisms have"
"multiple genomes and that's how they"
"they adapt to the changing environment"
"they go through the file cabinet when"
"things change and they go oh that one"
"will work"
um
"that doesn't sound like what you're"
"thinking about though no because because"
"uh that's all well and good to have"
"multiple genomes but of course the big"
"the the big question is how do you know"
"for some weird new physiological"
"stressor that you're experiencing which"
"part of your genome i mean think about"
"it the the the organism has exactly the"
"same problem that we workers in"
"regenerative medicine have which is"
"how do i know which genes to tweak to"
"get a particular outcome it's an"
"incredibly difficult question because"
"the mapping from genome to anatomy is"
"not straightforward and uh the the the"
"you can say in the barium you could you"
"could look at the barriers and say oh"
"well of course they have genes for other"
"ways to do things without potassium yeah"
"that's great but they also have 30 000"
"other genes and when you're blowing when"
"you're a cell and you're blowing up how"
"do you know which genes are to write"
"right i always visualize it like um"
"you're in a nuclear reactor control room"
"you know there's buttons everywhere and"
"things melting down you don't have time"
"to start flipping buttons in some sort"
"of like gradient descent you'll be dead"
"there's no time for that so so how do"
"you know so i think what uh it's a long"
"story you know i don't want to like you"
"we can talk about this offline but take"
"a while but"
"um i think what evolu evolution has a"
"really interesting uh"
"uh architecture that it uses here which"
"we call um multi-scale competency and i"
"i think what what it uses to solve all"
"these these kinds of problems much"
"faster than standard evolutionary"
processes
"is the fact that every every layer of"
"organization knows a little bit"
"something about its own competencies in"
"some weird space and so if you're a"
"higher level let's call if you're a"
"kidney if you're if you're a kidney and"
"you're calling for a kidney tubule you"
"may not know how to make a kidney tubule"
"especially if your cells are huge you"
"don't have any idea but the cells down"
"below know how to do certain things and"
"so this modularity the same way that we"
"can i realize i'm being very um"
"sort of i'm talking in a rough way you"
"can get much more rigorous with this but"
"but but you don't at every level you"
"don't need to know all the micro details"
"of the lower level if you can trust your"
"sub modules to know to that they know"
"what they're doing in their little space"
"right and that and that that's the"
"architecture that we have we don't have"
"a flat thing where everything has to uh"
"call up uh well i know i want this gene"
"and i want that gene that's never going"
"to work that architecture is never going"
"to work what you have are our modules"
"which know how to call other smaller"
"stupider modules to get pieces of the"
"the problem solved and that architecture"
"is uh i think and so this is why you"
"know we're trying to do this in for"
"robotics now right just to build this"
"this multi-scale architecture because"
"why don't we have general ai yet for the"
"exact same reason because our robots are"
"flat um i give a talk right i give a"
"talk called why don't robots get cancer"
"why don't robots get cancer because"
"their parts have no ability for"
"independent activity zero and so right"
"and so this is uh this is this is this"
"is exactly the same biological"
"architectures that are flat like that"
"are not going to work"
"that's right now thank you now let's ask"
"samuel to give us his question"
"so my question is that um when you kind"
"of do this regeneration experiment do"
"you actually track the chemical profile"
"of like in the cause of the growth so"
"for instance you've caused an amputation"
"and nothing is trying to grow do you do"
"do you have a systematic way of trying"
"to track the chemical profiles of what"
"so compared to a control what are some"
"of the"
"what are the chemical heterogeneity of"
"the growing process"
"compared to a control organism that is"
"actually you have not caused any changes"
"to it you're not trying to regenerate"
"any part of it do you have any tracking"
"sequence to actually know the"
"heckability between these two"
"counterparts sure sure we've yep we've"
"done all that so we know all the genes"
"that are turned on and we know the pro"
"you know all the way we've done the the"
"transcriptomics and the marker analysis"
"and the um morphe you know the the"
"morphometrics and all of that too sure"
yeah
yeah
"yeah we we even know the transduction"
"machinery we know how voltage is turned"
"on and off specific genes um we have all"
"that because you you need all that to"
"publish all this stuff you have to have"
"all the all the details uh frankly um"
"it's been a singularly uninformative uh"
"to answer the big questions that we"
"actually have so so so knowing how"
"individual cells turn on specific genes"
"from a specific voltage pattern in that"
"cell has taught us i'm going to say"
"almost nothing about how the global"
"process works to give you a limb versus"
"a tail versus an eye um it's a it's a"
"different problem it's it's it's but but"
"yes we have that information it just you"
"know it's not it's not sufficient for"
"what we need to do"
"oh okay nice and another one that i had"
"was that i mean i was thinking that when"
"you have a building for instance and"
"then uh you have the top of the building"
"then the basement supports in the top"
"you you can actually get a portion of"
"the building off and you have to rebuild"
it
"i mean there is a certain engineering"
"aspect you have to do to in order to get"
"the burden back in shape in order to"
"reduce the pressure"
"and to cause stability to actually"
"happen in the same sense and using the"
"same analogy can you also attribute the"
"fact that when you cause this voltage"
"changes you are actually causing a"
"perturbation in the system where the"
"system has to regenerate stability in"
"and in the cause of generating a"
"stability that goes through that cascade"
"of pathways to build something to"
"generate that that kind of stability so"
"for instance you have an applicator"
"section of your hand it can be that"
"just getting that section amputated is"
"causing some instability within your"
"system so therefore it sends some"
"pressure signals to some part of the"
"framework and then it has to regenerate"
"that section in order to reach that"
"stability or maybe you cause a"
"perturbation or a perturbation but i"
"plan to vote it and you trigger"
"um um um how do you call it an"
"instability which has to actually come"
"back to the normal and set values and"
"has to go through a process of"
"generating something to achieve those"
"goals depending on the mind that you"
"call that perturbation"
"yeah that's that's that's that's an"
"interesting uh point i mean it's true in"
"that a lot of these electrical circuits"
"have specific instabilities meaning"
"there are states that are bifurcations"
"where uh you can you know where a"
"certain stand we we've actually even"
"made we even made a line of unstable"
"planaria that are random where where um"
"if you cut it it randomly decides one"
"head or two right so we've you can"
"balance it right at that instability is"
"that every time you cut it you get a"
"random you know one one or two heads you"
"know you so you can do that instability"
"whether or not you know how much"
"mechanical instabilities play a role"
"that needs to be checked we haven't done"
"any biomechanics on this stuff um but"
"but but the bioelectrics has its own"
instabilities
okay
"thank you"
well
"as always michael thank you so much i"
"look forward to the next time"
"thanks very much it's good to see you"
"good to see you"
