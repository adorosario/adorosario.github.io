"show today thanks so much for Nicolas"
"thank you so much very happy to be here"
"it's a real honor the show for a while"
"and I'm really beat you to have you like"
"typically we start off the show just by"
"you know giving our guests the floor for"
"a little bit so you can tell us a little"
"bit about yourself"
"where you grew up how you got interested"
"in both sort of electrical engineering"
"side of things and biology and a little"
"bit of your journey into what you know"
"what broadly call sort of the frontiers"
"of biological science sure well when I"
"was fairly young we're talking basically"
"around six seven eight nine years old to"
"two things I remember that distinctly"
"kind of set me on this path one was a"
"love of engineering and that and it all"
"started with my dad taking the back off"
"our television set we have this large"
"kind of ancient TV said I need would"
"take the back off and and you could sort"
"of see all the other components inside"
"and I remember being incredibly"
"impressed that there was somebody who"
"knew how to put those things together in"
"exactly the right way and it was pretty"
"clear that you couldn't just randomly"
"jumble them together so somebody knew"
"how to do that in order to make the"
"cartoons come out the other end so this"
"idea that we have this this this"
"rational engineering where we can we can"
"take parts that by themselves don't do"
"much of anything and put them together"
"in a particular pattern a an"
"organization that ends up being though"
"more than the sum of its parts"
"okay so that was that was a kind of"
"something profound and I remember"
"thinking that whoever it was that knew"
"how to do that that's what I would like"
"to do I'd like to be the guy than those"
"how to do it come in parallel I had a"
"friend who was very much into bugs and"
"insects and so we would go outside and"
"and he was he's an older kid he knew"
"everything there was to know about"
"insects and he would show me all these"
"caterpillars and and beetles and things"
"and I was I was really amazed that these"
"things were had very complex behaviors"
"and morphology of course they they they"
"look like very specific shapes and I was"
"thinking and I always remember thinking"
"that well they also must be made of"
"parts they also came together in some"
"fashion or other and wouldn't it be"
"amazing if we understood how that worked"
"and what could we do if we really"
"understood how parts come together and"
"in particular I was always interested in"
"these living things as primarily a"
"cognitive system meaning that you know"
"it was clear that they had goals they"
"were trying to reach and they they like"
"certain things and they didn't like"
"other things and if you if you put"
"things in their way they figure out a"
"way around it and and it was always I"
"was always really interested in trying"
"to understand how it is that pieces of"
"matter and physical stuff like things"
"you might have in your kitchen come"
"together to form a creature that has"
"preferences it might have memories it"
"might have a mind it might have an"
"internal perspective and for sure it has"
"complex behaviors and and goal-directed"
"activity so it's always interested at"
"the intersection of those two kinds of"
"areas and then being older"
"and then emigrating I was I was born in"
"Moscow Russia we left in 1978 when I was"
"nine mm-hmm and I remember coming here"
"and after my dad got a job at a computer"
"company he was able to to to to"
"introduce me to some computer hardware I"
"mean this was you know a fairly ancient"
"stuff at this point but I remember"
"thinking that well this is very"
"interesting because here's something"
"that follows rules exactly and so there"
"if we understood what the rules ought to"
"be we might have a shot at putting"
"together some of the stuff from scratch"
"right could we build some of these"
"things from the ground up if if we"
"understood how they work and so right"
"around this this intersection of biology"
"and engineering and computer science is"
"where my interests lay and I did a lot"
"of coding and growing up had a software"
"company briefly but really I was"
"interested in working in artificial"
"intelligence in the broad sense so so"
"not specifically in any one technology"
"but this idea that could we create minds"
"that from scratch where mine could be"
"anything from a very simple thing that"
"that that exhibits in memory and and"
"behavior to something very complex which"
"something like general AI so these were"
"this was my interests growing up and you"
"know thinking along those lines and sort"
"of dealing with the I would say dumb"
"particle cells dumb but in the context"
"of sort of this theme of this so-called"
"more for genetic field sort of a concept"
"that is it's quite old I mean it goes"
"back over a century now where you know"
"we have this process this mysterious"
"process where we take dumb cells that in"
"some fad you know they know what their"
"neighbour is doing but when it comes to"
"sort of developing a complex structure"
"whether it's an organ or a limb not just"
"in the right size and shape but also"
"position you know hey this is my left"
"hand a right hand does not go here and"
"and my heart is here and not inside my"
"skull and so forth these are really you"
"know these concepts go back why"
"but even well before so we really"
"understood a lot about DNA"
"there's versions of this concept that"
"have popped up in literature in terms of"
"embryonic fields and in embryogenesis"
"symphonic fields and in plant"
"development but sort of they all come"
"downs as you see this top-down concept"
"that yes we can look at these genes and"
"these proteins but at the other day"
"there's a little more going on"
"controlling the shots can you talk a"
"little bit about this field concept"
"because in many ways I look at you as"
"sort of reawakening sort of something"
"that people talked about a hundred years"
"ago but sort of forgot and now you're"
"bringing it back with a lot of the new"
"tools that you have in the 21st century"
"you go a little further with that and"
"you'll be great sure so let's talk about"
"this the reason that the field concept"
"was so attractive for these questions is"
"not simply the kind of physical"
"definition of what a field is from"
"physics but actually the the the real"
"point is that in biology we often see"
"decisions that are being made about"
"fairly large scale structures things"
"that individual cells don't have access"
"to and I'll give I'll give some examples"
"momentarily but the idea is that if if"
"individual cells and actually all across"
"scale so molecules into inter molecular"
"networks into cells tissues and so on at"
"each level you find that in biology"
"these levels are able to integrate into"
"a a coherent functional system that"
"exists at the next higher level and so"
"this means that you that the system is"
"making non-local decisions and this"
"requires some sort of integration both"
"across space and time which is why the"
"field concepts immediately come to it"
"come to my so spatial because you're"
"you're finding that that cells now have"
"to make decisions about very large"
"things as you say about the shape of an"
"eye or the identity of an organ or the"
"length of a hand or things like this and"
"so and so there must be some way of"
"integrating information across space but"
"also time in the sense that the larger"
"collective may have a kind of memory of"
"what happened before it may"
"even have some anticipatory activity in"
"terms of all of the same thing happened"
"X number of times before then eventually"
"it may learn to anticipate it so these"
"these kinds of things are what is really"
"was driving people who think about feels"
"in this scenario is that how do local"
"agents whatever their scale integrate"
"together to become a bigger agent and"
"when I say agent I simply mean that the"
"bigger system is not just an emergent"
"collection of whatever the smaller"
"subsystems are doing but it has its own"
"integrated goals so some people are"
"comfortable with this for example in"
"when you study ants and termites people"
"often talk about the colony it measures"
"things remembers things and tries to"
"achieve things that the individual ants"
"do not so there's this in an important"
"sense there's a there's a new level"
"forming and of course in cybernetics and"
"control theory we're very comfortable"
"with the fact that you could take parts"
"that by themselves don't don't try to do"
"anything but if you arrange it into a"
"thermostat kind of loop then you've got"
"a system that tries to keep to a certain"
"temperature range for example right so"
"it takes some measurements of the"
"temperature it compares to a set point"
"and then it heats or cools depending on"
"whether you're witch whether you're out"
"of that system or not so there's a"
"there's a there's a range of other other"
"phenomena where these kind of"
"goal-directed systems that arise from a"
"comma from a particular combination of"
"subunits are studied and this is what"
"drives this this is this idea of trying"
"to understand fields basically it's"
"collectives right it's it's what does a"
"collective of smaller agents what does"
"it remember what does it want what does"
"it try to do that's distinct from what"
"what the individual agents do and I"
"think you know I would give you a just a"
"couple of examples from biology that can"
"they can get us get us thinking about"
"this so so here's something that and"
"there are many examples like this but"
"here's just one that we discovered a"
"couple years ago so tadpoles of frog"
"tadpoles I'm a very particular"
"arrangement of the face so there's a"
"good there's a couple of eyes there's a"
"jaw there's some gills there's always"
"some nostrils there's all kinds of"
"things for you and in order for a"
"tadpole to become a frog it has to"
"rearrange its face because frog faces"
"don't look like tapo face"
"so you have to move the nostrils you"
"have to move the jaw you have to move"
"the eyes a bunch of things have to move"
"so in the past it was thought that what"
"the frogs G with the frogs genome"
"encodes is a set of hardwired movements"
"never never mind how a genome was"
"supposed to encode movements we'll get"
"to that but but it but it was thought"
"that that this process was hardwired in"
"the sense that all tadpoles look the"
"same all frogs look the same so if you"
"move everything in a very particular way"
"you will get from here to there and then"
"life is good so what we found is that if"
"you in fact take a tadpole and you"
"produce it in a way that we call them"
"Picasso tadpoles because everything's in"
"the wrong place the eyes are up here"
"that jaws are off to the side the"
"nostrils are up you know everything is"
"just mixed around the amazing thing is"
"that largely they become perfectly"
"normal frogs and the reason is because"
"all the pieces move around through"
"fairly unnatural paths that they would"
"never normally do and they end up in a"
"correct Frog like face pattern and then"
"they stop then the system stops stops"
"metamorphosing so what you have then is"
"the fact that the genetics doesn't in"
"some way specify the set of movements"
"what the genetics specifies is a machine"
"that can do an amazing thing it can"
"ascertain its current configuration it"
"has some representation of what the"
"correct configuration is and then it can"
"progressively reduce the error so what"
"you have is that we call this pattern"
"homeostasis or anatomical homeostasis"
"and it's very much like that thermostat"
"loop to which I alluded you have the"
"ability to progressively reduce the"
"error toward some particular encoded"
"goal state you have a set point towards"
"which you you progressively reduce the"
"air and it turns out that this ability"
"to be plastic to issue commands to the"
"individual cells which is what you have"
"to do in order to get they or the organs"
"to move in order to reduce the error of"
"a very large thing so a frog face is a"
"massive thing from the scale of a"
"single-cell no individual cell is it"
"knows what the face looks like this is"
"not a property of any of the individual"
"cells this is a property of the"
"collective and so what you have here is"
"a situation where the collective has a"
"particular set point it's an anatomical"
"set point"
"it works to reduce the error to achieve"
"it so this is the sort of thing we need"
"to be able to explain right and and"
"think about how far any kind of genetic"
"explanation is from something like this"
"because it's not enough to think about"
"how individual cells execute specific"
"rules according to what their what their"
"genome says and then there's this"
"emergent phenomenon that's a lot of"
"people think about development this way"
"right it's emerged in every every cell"
"does something and outcomes you know"
"something something amazing but this is"
"this is much more complex than that this"
"is actually a system that is able to"
"ascertain it's it's its configuration"
"after really pretty drastic deformations"
"you know and then still get to where"
"it's going despite the fact that it's"
"starting from the wrong place and you"
"may intervene with it in the middle but"
"it still gets to where it's going and"
"this is the grand challenge of biology"
"it's not just to understand the"
"mechanisms it's not just about"
"understanding the hardware which which"
"is genomically encoded the hardware that"
"every cell has all the proteins we"
"really need to understand the software"
"we really need to understand how"
"collectives follow large-scale goals and"
"I think I think this is you know maybe"
"the most exciting question in biology"
"and it bleeds into everything from swarm"
"robotics to philosophy of mind to"
"regenerative medicine like this is the I"
"think this is the central question yeah"
"and and a major aspect if your research"
"over the years has of course been the"
"area of developmental bioelectricity and"
"the you know the concept that and well"
"I'm sorry if I butcher this but I'll ask"
"you to sort of take us on a path through"
"this as well"
"cells and tissues throughout the human"
"body use all sorts of different ion"
"channels to communicate with one another"
"process of electro taxes and so forth"
"these are endogenous electrical currents"
"and fields there's different fluxes"
"different resting potentials obviously"
"people may be may be most familiar with"
"the 18th century work of we Giovanni"
"his dancing frog legs and so forth from"
"that perspective but take us a little"
"bit if you would all sort of be the 20th"
"century domain of bioelectricity and"
"sort of how you've now taken sort of"
"what's been done there and taken it to a"
"whole other level this is a very"
"important connection sure a couple of"
"different ways to think about it I mean"
"one one thing you might do is ask the"
"question of where did nerves come from"
"so we're most familiar with electricity"
"in the nervous system so muscle and"
"nerve of course use electricity to do"
"their thing and and if you sort of a lot"
"of a lot of people make a very sharp"
"distinction between neuroscience and non"
"neural you know non neural biology and"
"actually there is no sharp there is no"
"sharp dividing line and in fact we and"
"others have been using concepts and"
"tools of neuroscience to study all sorts"
"of things about development and this is"
"for a simple reason that nerves did not"
"just suddenly spring into being so so"
"nerves evolved from other cell types and"
"those cell types were using electricity"
"long before brains showed up electricity"
"is an ancient ancient way of processing"
"information it was discovered at the"
"very least around the time of bacterial"
"biofilms maybe before that and so"
"evolution discovered really early on in"
"in the process that by electricity or"
"electricity is a really convenient way"
"to do computation it is not an accident"
"that our brains are built on this"
"principle it is not an accident that our"
"current computer technology is built on"
"this electrical circuits are really"
"convenient for information for"
"distributed integrated problem solving"
"for for memory for decision making"
"electricity is really excellent at this"
"so it was recognized for many years"
"actually in there there there have been"
"some great people right from around the"
"1900s to to now that have studied"
"electricity and bio electricity in"
"embryonic development they've studied"
"how cells communicate with each other"
"during regeneration during cancer"
"suppression and so on and you know one"
"one sort of traditional way to look at"
"it would be that well my electricity is"
"one more set of mechanisms like"
"biomechanics like physical forces"
"chemical gradients it's one more a"
"physical mechanism that is required for"
"pattern formation for and for complex"
"anatomy and that and that's all true but"
"I think there's a much deeper truth here"
"and the deeper truth is that what it's"
"actually used for it's not just another"
"mechanism it's actually a computational"
"medium this is what this these bi"
"electric networks are actually what"
"mediates cognitive like processes in"
"living tissues so all of the things that"
"brains do in terms of driving behavior"
"moving the body around through space non"
"neural electric networks in the rest of"
"the body do the same thing they do it"
"more slowly and their output is not"
"moving controlling muscles to move"
"through space their output which is a"
"much more ancient system this is this is"
"how it was at the beginning their system"
"is designed to control all the different"
"cells and make sure that you get the"
"correct the correct configuration in"
"anatomical morphus space so instead of"
"guiding you through 3-dimensional space"
"they're guiding an embryo or a"
"developing limb or anything like that"
"they're guiding it through a complex"
"anatomical morphus space by moving by"
"telling the cells to differentiate to"
"migrate to proliferate and so on so so"
"so the reason we're so excited about by"
"electricity is is not just that it's"
"cool and it's a really interesting area"
"of biophysics but because by controlling"
"by reading and then controlling these"
"five electric gradients we get a glimpse"
"of the computations that are happening"
"inside the tissue it's very similar to"
"how nowadays there's this project for of"
"neural decoding right so neuroscientists"
"would like to read the electrical"
"activity of the brain and if we knew"
"what we were doing we could we could"
"sort of deconvolve that into some sort"
"of representation of what the what the"
"creature was thinking about so is it a"
"you know maybe a visual image or maybe"
"there's a plan or a goal or you know"
"something's going on in that in that"
"brain and we're going to read it out"
"we're going to read out the cognitive"
"content of the mind by looking at the"
"electrical activity of the brain"
"maybe maybe even predict what it what"
"that what that creature is going to do"
"before they do it because because we get"
"to get to read the information"
"structures that guide behavior we are"
"doing the exact same thing for the rest"
"of the body so the idea is that by"
"tracking and learning to decode we call"
"this cracking the more the bioelectric"
"code and by learning to decode this"
"information we are getting a glimpse of"
"what information is being processed by"
"the cells of tissues and better yet we"
"can really can now rewrite that"
"information so just like people like"
"like tonegawa at MIT who are using"
"optogenetics and those kind of tools to"
"Incept false memories into brains we can"
"and we can now insert artificial"
"bioelectric anatomical memories into"
"tissue and get them to build something"
"else and and and we think we think this"
"is really exciting for regenerative"
"medicine because it offers a whole new"
"set of opportunities than the kind of"
"traditional bioengineering and genomic"
"editing approaches so let's talk about a"
"couple of these areas in terms of"
"modulating anatomical worthless space"
"you know I know that you you work with"
"pharmaceutical compounds in spy out"
"their substances that modulate ion"
"channels and so forth to have different"
"effects but then there's also sort of my"
"previous employer from several years ago"
"GlaxoSmithKline investing into this term"
"electro suta khals nowadays we you're"
"getting the drug out of the way entirely"
"and just you know zap well do you know"
"if they call it let's talk a little bit"
"about there's two areas of morphus base"
"modulation that I think are fascinating"
"and everything but I thought we touched"
"on these two and what is this general"
"theme of normalizing cancer and so this"
"fascinating ability we've seen this in"
"literature for a while it hasn't really"
"been known about why it happens when you"
"take a regenerating limb and you stuff"
"it full of tumor cells and regular"
"generates or the work that was actually"
"done here in Philadelphia back in the"
"1970s by Beatrice mrs. group in in"
"Toronto carcinoma and embryos talk a"
"little bit about this using the ability"
"to modulate more for space to normalize"
"cancer if you would I think it's a"
"fascinating sure yeah let me let me"
"start out with it with the electrical"
"idea so Mariska making making people"
"upset I will make I I will say that I"
"think using electrodes to impact by"
"electric state is is not the future of"
"this field I think I think that's"
"actually a step backwards and the reason"
"is because what we are trying to do here"
"is to modulate the information flow that"
"is happening inside the system and get"
"it to do something else physically"
"trying to alter resting potential"
"patterns stay stable developmental"
"resting potential patterns with"
"electrodes is incredibly hard it's it's"
"good for spiking so if your target is"
"the nervous system and a lot of those"
"applications like GSK and other people"
"are using this to target the peripheral"
"nervous system so so spiking neurons the"
"electrodes are a perfectly good way to"
"go for for anything other than that for"
"targeting other cell types and in fact"
"managing three-dimensional structures so"
"we're talking birth defects cancer which"
"I'll talk about in a minute regeneration"
"and so on electrodes are not a good way"
"to just because of the physics of it"
"they they're not a good way to establish"
"standing resting potential gradients"
"instead I think and and and people"
"people sort of love this idea of getting"
"away from the drugs by actually think"
"that's that's the wrong way to think"
"about it you see what you have in the"
"system itself is a bunch of ion channels"
"that the system is using to drive its"
"signaling its information dynamics and"
"what you would really like to do rather"
"than trying to impose external fields"
"externally which is really hard to be"
"specific about it you would really like"
"to control the knobs that the system"
"itself is using you want to be able to"
"open and close those channels and the"
"nowadays the best way to open in those"
"and close those channels is with drugs"
"now you might in a in a city in some"
"systems you might be able to use"
"optogenetics so you might be able to use"
"light in the future there might be"
"acoustic technologies there might be who"
"knows there might be other ways to do it"
"but I think there's no getting around"
"the fact that the most specific and the"
"most powerful interventions are going to"
"be when you take advantage of what the"
"system is doing normally right and and"
"that and that means that you need to you"
"need to have a model a computational"
"model of how those channels are"
"contributing to specific information"
"dynamics and you need to then be able to"
"open and close those channels to set up"
"standing resting potentials in tissue"
"that's that are what you want there's an"
"analogy you can you can think about this"
"as an analogy a lot of modern"
"biomedicine is still focused on forcing"
"the hardware you are trying to literally"
"you know people are very excited about"
"single molecule approaches genomic"
"editing you're you're working down at"
"the level of the hardware you're really"
"trying to micromanage the process and"
"get everything where it needs to be"
"applied field applied electric fields"
"there are that type of thing you're"
"really trying to force the correct"
"electric pattern with an external"
"stimulation for certain things there"
"will be some low-hanging fruit where"
"that's great and that works great but"
"anybody who programs or has looked at"
"the history of computer science from the"
"beginnings in the 40s all the way"
"through this amazing information"
"technology revolution that we have"
"understands that programming at the"
"level of hardware is brutal"
"programming in machine code is only"
"marginally better and what you would"
"really like to do is program at a"
"particularly high level now when I give"
"a talk I often show a picture of what"
"programming looked like in the 40s"
"there's a there's a great photo of a"
"woman and she's sitting there and she's"
"physically Reap lugging wires she's"
"physically moving wise from here to"
"there okay that's it that's how you used"
"to have to program that is where biology"
"is today but we are all about rewiring"
"pathways transcriptional networks it's"
"all about the hardware the thing is that"
"wouldn't it be wouldn't it be amazing if"
"in biology we can do what we do in"
"computer science which when you have a"
"laptop and you want to switch from"
"Microsoft Word to Photoshop you don't"
"get out your soldering iron and start"
"rewiring what you do is you manipulate"
"the system with inputs you give it"
"experiences in this case through a"
"keyboard in my case through through ion"
"channel modulation or optical modulation"
"but what you're trying to do is you're"
"not trying to micromanage the system"
"you're trying to provide stimuli or"
"inputs that you know will drive the"
"system to the correct state now this"
"requires this whole strategy of"
"motivating the system instead of Hara"
"instead of forcing it requires something"
"very particular it requires that the"
"system itself be reprogrammable it"
"requires that what you're dealing with"
"is a cognitive system and some people"
"some people get get really upset about"
"this because it sounds like you're sort"
"of bringing back some sort of weird"
"animism or or you know anthropomorphism"
"but if we take evolution seriously and"
"we realize that whatever our cognitive"
"capacities are they have to have a"
"smooth evolutionary history all the way"
"back we have to ask ourselves and and"
"and of course engineers people who work"
"in in cybernetics control theory and so"
"on are super comfortable with non"
"magical devices that make decisions that"
"have memories right I mean we have a"
"science of this we don't need to be"
"afraid of so so what what I'm going to"
"claim is that biology and we can get"
"into why I think this is how this"
"evolved but I think most current biology"
"is is is a is a is a primitive cognitive"
"system it exhibits what we call basal"
"cognition meaning no of course it's not"
"sitting there in thinking you know"
"wouldn't be nice if I had another finger"
"it's it's not a high order cognitive"
"system but it is one that has memory and"
"can make decisions and can take"
"measurements and can anticipate simple"
"patterns in slowly life so so if we"
"understood how this worked then what we"
"would be doing is we wouldn't be trying"
"to micromanage it and and sort of you"
"know put put specific stem cells in"
"specific areas and and growth factors"
"and all that we would be trying to"
"figure out what are the stimuli that"
"drive the system to decide to make a"
"limb or an eye or heart of a particular"
"size and we would be operating at a much"
"much higher level the benefit of this of"
"course is that it's so much easier I'll"
"just give a very simple example from"
"from nur"
"if you have a rat and you want the rat"
"to do a circus trick put a little ball"
"in the hoop right you have two to two"
"ways to go about it you can if you know"
"neuroscience to the pituitary that we"
"that we don't you could try to"
"manipulate every nerve in that rat's"
"brain play it like a puppet and get the"
"body to move in a particular way to get"
"it to do what it what it needs to do and"
"maybe that's possible someday maybe"
"we'll be able to do that but the great"
"thing is that is that humans figured out"
"all probably ten thousand years ago that"
"you can achieve the same result without"
"knowing anything at all about what's"
"between the rats ears you train the rat"
"you provide rewards and punishments you"
"incentivize the system you offload all"
"of that complexity on to the system"
"itself and that works because what"
"you're dealing with is a complex a"
"cognitive system that that you can"
"communicate with not just force at the"
"lowest level now we have to be careful"
"this is all an empirical so people"
"sometimes say oh my god so a ball"
"rolling down the hill now you're gonna"
"say as a cognitive system no this is a"
"very empirical kind of thing you only"
"right you only ascribe enough cognitive"
"metaphors to be the optimal way to"
"control the system so if you're dealing"
"with a cuckoo clock or a ball rolling"
"down the hill you don't need this you in"
"fact you don't have it you don't have"
"access to any of this stuff it's not"
"that kind of a system you have to you"
"have to interact with it via Newtonian"
"mechanics at the lowest level you have"
"no choice but if you're dealing with a"
"rat at the top of the hill you'd be"
"crazy to rely on on something like"
"Newtonian mechanics to figure out where"
"this thing is gonna go that you have a"
"much better you have a much better set"
"of handles on the system if you"
"acknowledge the fact that it has"
"preferences it has inputs it has outputs"
"it has things that can learn and things"
"that it can't learn right so this is"
"this is why I think fundamentally this"
"question of electrodes versus versus"
"drugs is just a microcosm of that whole"
"of that whole issue I think we need to"
"we need to learn it for we need to learn"
"these things from the informational"
"concept now the cancer the cancer"
"question so let's talk about what cancer"
"really is and and I preface this by"
"saying that cancer is not just one thing"
"going all right there's there's lots of"
"flotsam phenomenon we call cancer but"
"let's just let's pare it down a little"
bit
"one way to think about cancer and this"
"is a way that was popular a long time"
"ago really fell out of favor in the"
"genetics revolution and is now slowly"
"coming back is the idea that the real"
"question isn't why do we get cancer the"
"real question is why is there ever"
"anything but cancer if you look at"
"individual cells right amoebas I often"
"show a video of I think a lack from area"
"you can we can we can put a link to it"
"maybe it's an it's an amazing little"
"little organism you look at an"
"individual cell and you see how"
"competent these agents are they are in"
"their own scale so at the scale of a"
"single cell they are handling their"
"physiology their behavior and their"
"morphology in the case of cells that"
"change their shape all the time like"
"this lacrimarum they're handling it all"
"in real time no brain needed incredibly"
"competent and so one might ask how do"
"you convince a bunch of these free"
"agents to work together to toward a"
"common goal the common goal being build"
"a frog or a fish or a human right build"
"a body and this is a profound question"
"is how do how do you get a collective to"
"have a common goal that is so much"
"larger than any of the members of the of"
"the collective and whatever that"
"mechanism turns out to be you would"
"necessarily expect that occasionally"
"there will be breakdowns in inevitably"
"so at some point what will happen is a"
"single cell in this body so so these"
"these cells are connected there there"
"have kind of a large shared goal space"
"that they're working on and for whatever"
"reason imagine that one cell gets"
"disconnected from this information flow"
"so so there's current is there are a"
"bunch of cues that are telling all the"
"cells what to do to work towards this"
"you know this massive thing and then all"
"of a sudden there's one cell that"
"doesn't get the message that the message"
"for whatever reason as far as that cell"
"is concerned it is now reverted back to"
"its ancient unicellular past it it has"
"shrunk its computational boundary and in"
"fact in a different publication I call"
"this the the boundary of the self you"
"know for the body because all the share"
"all the cells share physiological"
"information if the unit of work the"
"goal-directed unit is large the self is"
"huge it's a body of"
"some size or it's an organ something"
"like that but an individual cell all of"
"that shrinks just to the sort of area"
"around that cell and as soon as that"
"happens the rest of the body is just"
"environment as far as that cell is"
"concerned it's the self is small it's"
"that cell everything it does is for the"
"benefit of that cell and everything else"
"is just the outside world so that"
"boundary beach where where you and and"
"and the world begins can shrink and grow"
"during the lifetime of an individual"
"normally it's it's it's fairly massive"
"but but individual cells can can can get"
"out and then they're they're influenced"
"their information Lea cut off they"
"become single-cell amoebas pharrell for"
"all intents and purposes well what do"
"what do single-cell organisms do they go"
"wherever life is good they proliferate"
"as much as they can so this is"
"metastasis and and and over"
"proliferation and in fact recent data"
"have even looked at the transcriptomes"
"of these individual cells and noticed"
"that literally at the level of gene"
"expression you can see them rolling back"
"to an ancient a really ancient type of"
"transcriptome that belongs to single"
"cell ancient single-cell creatures so so"
"this is this is my view of cancer in"
"that it's an information disorder it's a"
"disorder of the computational boundary"
"between self and world and what we what"
"we did in my lab was to start to say"
"okay if if that's true and if what"
"you're looking at is is the importance"
"of the connection between a cell and"
"it's the its neighbors we already know"
"that by electric networks provide a"
"massive amount of that information not"
"alone of course chemical signals are"
"critical biomechanics is critical we"
"work on by electricity then we said okay"
"that view makes three predictions it"
"predicts that number one if you do have"
"an event where a cell becomes"
"transformed and starts to make a tumor"
"instead of a good organ you should be"
"able to see this very early on by an"
"aberrant by electrical signature you"
"should be able to see that the cell is"
"not connected to its neighbors they"
"should be able to detect cancer this way"
"and we've shown in fact using voltage"
"sensitive fluorescent dyes that as soon"
"as you introduce an O for example an"
"oncogene let's say a nasty humanoid"
"like a harassed mutations into a"
"perfectly normal cell the first thing"
"that it does is depolarize so that the"
"gap junctions meaning these electrical"
"synapses that connect it to its"
"neighbors they close and it becomes"
"electrically isolated and that that bear"
"fact has been known since I think the"
"80s but it hasn't been really plugged"
"into this to the some kind of protocol"
"native view of life so that's the first"
"prediction the second prediction is that"
"you ought to be able to induce cancer"
"and a cancer phenotype without anything"
"being wrong with the genome and and"
"we've done this so what we've shown is"
"in the frog model we've shown that you"
"can cause basically full-on metastatic"
"melanoma in tadpoles that have no"
"genetic mutations no oncogenes no"
"exposure to carcinogens nothing"
"genomically wrong with them nothing that"
"you would ever know from sequencing"
"anything up until the tumor gets"
"advanced enough that you're now seeing"
"markers come on you know physiological"
"markers come up and so we can do this"
"simply by temporarily disrupting the"
"electrical communication between two"
"cell types and and you get you get"
"metastatic melanoma the third and and"
"probably most most most exciting"
"implication in this is that you ought to"
"be able to go in Reverse so if there is"
"a cell that has gone rogue in terms of"
"disconnecting from its neighbors and"
"shrinking its goals to unicellular goals"
"of proliferation and migration what you"
"ought to be able to do is force it to"
"reconnect it wouldn't be amazing if you"
"if you forced it to reconnect and then"
"the other cells around it normalized it"
"and and and and and rolled back this"
"kind of cancer phenotype and we've shown"
"this now as you say beatrice Mintz and"
"other people Mary Hendrix other people"
"since then have shown that complex"
"patterning environments scenarios in"
"which a lot of information is coming"
"down from the body about what cells"
"should be doing this is not only embryo"
"Genesis but regeneration so two or more"
"tumors in the middle of a regenerating"
"limb for example in salamanders people"
"have shown that that kind of environment"
"can normalize cancer cells and and be"
"people if people have been focusing on"
"some biochemical signals but it's"
"completely unclear why why this happens"
"we think or at least I think that it's"
"partly because of this electric"
"connection and so what we"
"done is we've taken tadpoles into which"
"we and we insert human oncogenic"
"mutations and like that like KS normally"
"they make tumors and you can see these"
"tumors on the tadpoles and then what we"
"do is we go back in and we use either"
"light with optogenetics or drugs the"
"target the ion channels or we could miss"
"Express channels directly you go back in"
"and you force an electrical state that"
"will cause it to stay connected with via"
"gap junctions to its neighbors and when"
"you do this you see a drastic reduction"
"of tumorigenesis existing tumors start"
"to disappear now they don't die the key"
"to this is that these cells this is this"
"is not any kind of chemotherapy because"
"the the tumor cells do not die what they"
"do is they they normalized some of them"
"move off the thing basically sort of"
"disbands the tumor disbands the cells"
"join other tissues in their vicinity and"
"they go on as a perfectly normal"
"perfectly normal animal so I think and"
"we're now so as all of this stuff was"
"done in frog lots of papers in the front"
"model now we're starting to look at"
"human cells and tissues and we hope that"
"this is a an approach to cancer that's"
"different from chemo so the idea is not"
"to kill off as many of these cells as"
"you can and hope you don't kill the"
"healthy ones"
"the idea is to normalize or reprogram"
"those cells back towards the large scale"
"more for genetic goals you know working"
"off that same thing you know you spent a"
"lot of time studying regeneration in"
"various models this tournament but"
"morphic where you know as you were"
"saying before we have a process of not"
"just cells that are remain after a DQ"
"pennant a destruction event racing their"
"history but also this process of sort of"
"intercalation where cells know once"
"again specifically how to fill in where"
"they should be where you know this whole"
"you know i'll refer to sort of what this"
"was constantly these different"
"regenerative laws that exist in nature"
"you know you really we're well aware of"
"them that no matter how many times you"
"chop off that salamander leg you know"
"you're never gonna get a foot up here"
"you're always gonna have a proper"
"progression of regeneration based on - I"
"talked a little bit about some of your"
"work in terms in you've done stuff where"
"you've created eyeballs on tails"
"things of this nature which is pretty"
"cool at the same time a couple of years"
"ago you had this fascinating paper it"
"was titled knowing one's place a free"
"energy approach to pattern regulation"
"was in the Royal Society magazine where"
"you have a model in terms of you know"
"where do these patterns exist you know"
"where are they hiding out and we can't"
"find them in the genome can you talk a"
"little bit about from sort of this"
"physical perspective you know your"
"concepts on you know where the limb"
"pattern sort of exists in the context of"
"the body remembering it I think sure"
sure
"so so let's start let's start by coming"
"back to our my particular hypothesis"
"which is which is that and this is this"
"is very much I mean I should I should"
"tell tell the listeners this is very"
"much not a standard way to look at this"
"okay so this is not I'm not giving you"
"the standard view that you will get from"
"a developmental biology textbook my"
"perspective on this is that regeneration"
"and regulative development and those"
"kind tumor suppression all of those"
"things are examples of error"
"minimization so there are examples of a"
"system that in some simple way not down"
"to each individual cell position but in"
"some simple general coarse-grained map"
"of large-scale body features it stores a"
"representation of what a correct"
"salamander leg looks like this is what"
"we ought to in a minute we ought to also"
"talk about some gaps in the modern"
"paradigm that that I think drive us into"
"this kind of conclusion but let's just"
"let's just talk about what what what"
"that entails if that's true and the"
"reason that by the way the reason this"
"is very much a non-standard view is that"
"in modern modern feels like this it is"
"very fashionable for for many years now"
"to really try to avoid anything that"
"sounds like teleology so anything that"
sounds
"like the system has a goal or that it's"
"trying to get to a particular place what"
"people really love nowadays is emergence"
"so this idea that if there are complex"
"systems that when you turn the crank and"
"and and lots of subunits do simple rules"
"again and again complex things emerge"
"and there's absolutely no doubt that"
"emergence is important that emergence is"
"critical for lots of interesting"
"phenomena but but I want to talk for a"
"minute about this this idea that there"
"is a representation of the goal state"
"that that model makes a really peculiar"
"prediction what it predicts is that if"
"you want to make changes to the"
"large-scale system you might not have to"
"rewire the individual cells or"
"components you could change the goal"
"state because because if the if what if"
"what the system is doing is trying to"
"get to whatever the the memory of the"
"goal state is you might just rewrite"
"that and let the cells build to whatever"
"it to the memory right that's a it's a"
"completely different approach because if"
"there is no if there is no memory if"
"there is no pattern memory that the"
"system is trying to get to if it's fully"
"emergent then you have no choice there's"
"there's really nothing to do except to"
"to to try to alter those low-level rules"
"that the cells are following and it's"
"the problem is is is is really really"
"hard and you can think about it in the"
"following way let's say let's say you"
"have a termite mound and it has a"
"particular kind of chimney right and you"
"say okay I want you know what I want I I"
"would like it them to build a chimney"
"that has its forked it's got its got two"
"and so now the question is okay how do I"
"change the rules that every single"
"termite follows to give you a fork to"
"chimney instead of a straight one well"
"this is incredibly hard it's called an"
"inverse problem because what you care"
"about is the large-scale final outcome"
"but what you are trying to make changes"
"in is the is a completely different"
"level of events it's the rules that"
"every ant"
"of every termite has like hey if I meet"
"another termite with a particular"
"chemical I will drop a piece of dirt or"
"I'll pick up a piece of dirt you know"
"these kinds of things and going from one"
"so the other is really hard the same"
"thing happens for to us in in"
"biomedicine what you really care about"
"is how many fingers your patient has or"
"how long their leg is or things like"
"this but the tools we have"
"are things like you know protein factors"
"and and and and transcription factors"
"and knowing how to change those things"
"to get to the correct large-scale"
"outcome is incredibly hard this is this"
"is one reason I think that they"
"techniques like genomic editing and so"
"on while really important are going to"
"hit a limit if we if we exclusively try"
"to use bottom-up approaches so so so so"
"my approach is is is that if we"
"hypothesize that there is a pattern"
"memory to which the system works let's"
"not try to address it from from a"
"different lower level of the individual"
"rules let's try to change the pattern"
"memory okay and remember on the on the"
"on the traditional view there is no such"
"things there's nothing right so okay so"
"so what we've done is we've asked the"
"question if that's true could we find"
"the could could we see detect and"
"characterize this representation and if"
"we could find it could we change it and"
"get the cells to do something else so"
"I'm gonna tell you the story of one"
"particular example where we've done that"
"so think about these things called"
"planaria so planaria are flatworms they"
"are similar to our ancestor they're not"
"like earthworms they're good they're"
"true by lie they have true bilateral"
"symmetry they have a brain most of the"
"neurotransmitters like you and I have"
"complex organisms the amazing thing"
"about planaria is that they are"
"champions of regeneration so you can cut"
"them in any way that you like the record"
"I think is something like 273 pieces"
"back in the back in the day and every"
"single piece will grow exactly what's"
"needed no more no less and make a tiny"
"little worm now the most amazing thing"
"about regeneration of course is that it"
"stops it's easy enough to say that well"
"we're just gonna we're gonna crank up"
"cell division after injury I mean that's"
"fine but what happens is they stop when"
"they or let's say in a salamander limb"
"once it gets to be a correct salamander"
"limb wherever that means then it stops"
"so so so clearly operationally the"
"system knows what a correct limb looks"
"like or a correct worm and then it stops"
"so so we ask the following question okay"
"we have these where these planaria"
"what is it that enables them to know we"
"ask the simple question head number how"
"many heads is a worm supposed to have"
"the standard worm has one head one head"
"one tail and so we ask this question and"
"and what we started to do was to look at"
"the bio electrics of this process and to"
"observe fragments via these voltage"
"sensitive fluorescent dyes that give us"
"a kind of readout it's it's it's you"
"know it's all it's it's almost like a"
"like a like an EEG but but but for the"
"whole for every cell so you can see all"
"the surface you could you know as long"
"as you can see them optically you see"
"what all these cells are doing"
"electrically and what we found is that"
"the way that the planarian piece knows"
"where to put the head and where to put"
"the tail is that it has this really"
"interesting bioelectrical pattern where"
"the depolarization is telling you where"
"the head is going to be the hyper"
"polarization is telling you where the"
"tail is going to be and there's one of"
"each so then we were able to go in and"
"and artificially change this electrical"
"pattern and we were able to let's say"
"take the posterior wound and say you're"
"gonna be we're gonna depolarize you so"
"now the cells look and they say well I"
"guess we make heads on both sides and"
"now you get a two-headed work so you"
"literally get a two-headed planarian"
"with heads on on each end right and"
"perfectly viable the cells are totally"
"happy to build to normal normal heads if"
"that's what the bioelectric pattern says"
"and so so that was the that was kind of"
"the first amazing thing is that it's"
"clear that this pattern is instructive"
"it doesn't just read out where the head"
"and tail used to be it's actually"
"instructive for what's gonna happen in"
"the future because if you rewrite it you"
"get a different Anatomy the most amazing"
"thing about this is that when you take"
"those two-headed worms and you recut"
"them again in plain water no more"
"manipulations of any kind so originally"
"we use drugs to target the electrical"
"you know electrogenic proteins no more"
"of that just plain old water so you take"
"these worms and of course I went when I"
"give talks about this I usually ask"
"people I say well look we have this"
"two-headed worm I'm gonna cut off the"
"ectopic head I'm gonna cut off the"
"original head I'm just gonna keep the"
"middle gut fragment the genetics are"
"untouched we haven't we haven't edited"
"the genome although the genomic sequence"
"is exactly normal what is this this"
"weird head tissue that people say well"
"it's epigenetically reprogrammed okay so"
"it goes in the garbage"
"we cut that off we take this this"
"remaining gut fragment I said what do"
"you think this thing's gonna do and of"
"course the standard paradigm is well it"
"has to go back to the default Anatomy"
"that the cells have a standard genome if"
"you sequence them there's nothing wrong"
"with it therefore they're going to make"
"what what planarian cells make which is"
"a normal plain area that's absolutely"
"not what happens so you take this"
"two-headed worm and it is forever as far"
"as we can tell through many rounds of"
"regeneration it is now permanently"
"two-headed so so worth pausing for a"
"moment to think about what that means so"
"so the number oh and they're just in the"
"spatial distribution of heads is"
"determined by the memory of an electric"
"circuit the electric circuit and there's"
"some other stuff involved too but but"
"but these electric circuits store a"
"pattern that tells the cells what on"
"this large anatomical scale what they're"
"going to build and not only can it be"
"changed but it persists so once you"
"change it it it keeps so it's a it's a"
"true electrical memory actually we've"
"learned to take it the other way so we"
"can now take a 2 worm and a two-headed"
"worm and change it back to being a"
"one-headed so a worms body can hold at"
"least two probably more different"
"memories of what a correct planarian"
"looks like this is the this is the"
"information to which the cells will"
"build if they are damaged now so so so"
"why do I call it a memory well first of"
"all because it's stable like a memory is"
"supposed to be its labile or rewritable"
"like memories supposed to be it is there"
"is also such a thing as latent versus"
"recalled memory so we can take a worm we"
"can alter the electrical pattern and as"
"long as we don't cut it it stays"
"one-headed because that memory is latent"
"no but no one's calling it up it's not"
"being used for anything as soon as we"
"injure the worm that's when it becomes"
"active and the cells consult the pattern"
"then they build a two-headed worm but in"
"the meantime that body can store one of"
"- one of two patterns at least probably"
"more so so what we're able to do is"
"we're able to directly look at a worm"
"we're able to"
"see that pattern memory now we're able"
"to rewrite it and and we can see that"
"the gene expression and the cell"
"behaviors are controlled by this pattern"
"so this is just one example of the fact"
"that yeah absolutely we can see these"
"target states they're absolutely"
"represented now we've gone we've gone"
"further than this and the other thing"
"you can do which is also kind of wild is"
"that two other things should be you"
"should be mentioned one is that there's"
"this electrical system"
"aside from head number you can think"
"about head shape and so one of the"
"different planaria have different shaped"
"heads so there's triangular ones flat"
"ones round ones all different kinds of"
"heads so what we can do is we can take a"
"planarian with a triangular head shape"
"cut off the head and basically prevent"
"that by electrical network from"
"communicating very well we can shut down"
"these gap junctions these electrical"
"synapses for about 48 hours so the"
"network enters this really chaotic state"
"and then it settles back down when you"
"pull the drug out it settles back down"
"the thing is that when it settles back"
"down some percentage of the time it goes"
"back to the same attractor that it used"
"to live in which is a normal planarian"
"head but it turns out there's some"
"others and the others are and sometimes"
"the system stochastically will land and"
"one of these other attractors and and"
"believe it or not these other attractors"
"are the represent the head shapes of"
"other species of planaria so what we can"
"do is without touching the genome in any"
"way we can take that fragment and make"
"it regrow the head belonging to a"
"different species of worm it will have a"
"different shape the brain will be a"
"different shape the distribution of stem"
"cells will be different exactly like"
"these other species these other species"
"about oh probably between 100 and 150"
"million years of evolutionary distance"
"so what you have here is this really"
"amazing divergence between the genomic"
"information and the actual physiological"
"information that guides what the cells"
"are actually doing and the way the way"
"to understand this there's a couple of"
"different ways that we use this but the"
"way to understand it is that what the"
"genome does is it nails down the"
"hardware a lot of people think of the"
"genome as"
"the software of the cell so I think I"
"think that's not the best metaphor"
"writing I think a better way to think"
"about this is that what the genome does"
"is it tells every cell what proteins it"
"gets to have that's your hardware some"
"of those proteins are electrical"
"signaling machinery some are chemical"
"physical forces whatever but once you"
"put all those things together there's a"
"new layer that shows up which is a"
"computational layer that is the software"
"that runs on this hardware and the"
"hardware is amazing the reason the"
"hardware is so so cool is because first"
"of all it's very stable so most of the"
"time it does exactly the right thing"
"it always does the same way of planaria"
"regenerate correctly but just about 100%"
"of the time but once you know how to"
"give it correct inputs which it took us"
"you know what 10 10 12 years to learn to"
"how to do this once you know how to how"
"to put in the correct inputs you can"
"shift that software to a different mode"
"to a different activity mode it you"
"don't have to rewire it you don't have"
"to in fact if we wanted to rewire it we"
"wouldn't know how if you wanted to do"
"genomic editing to make to go from"
"around at or to a triangular head how"
"would you do it we have absolutely no"
"idea and so and so but luckily you don't"
"have to because the system is modular"
"and and and it represents these gold"
"states that you can sort of choose among"
"you can also we have the third thing is"
"that we've also made some some really"
"wacky things that don't look anything"
"like planaria out of normal planarian"
"cells because there are regions of that"
"morphus space that are on evolution"
"doesn't use i mean they're not viable"
"out in the wild doesn't doesn't see them"
"but but you can in fact you can make it"
"you can make some really wild creations"
"if if you're operating at the level of"
"body plane information let's let's take"
"the planarian for a moment and then go"
"in a directory meant I have tons of your"
"I have tons of your your manuscripts"
"around here and it's hard to pick my"
"favorite but clearly your paper the"
"stability of memories during brain"
"remodeling a perspective in"
"communicative anandrao biology is when"
"it was at the top so here you you know"
"earlier on you talked a little bit"
"about the the ancient the ancientness of"
"these by electric networks that neurons"
"you know they came on the scene couple"
"under million years ago whatever but"
"there was a lot happening before them"
"you highlight in this paper obviously"
"that we're on a planet where we have"
"many a neural organisms that don't have"
"brains at all we have these bio electric"
"networks not just you know in our"
"nervous system but we haven't been heart"
"and bone and pancreas and so forth and"
"then we have obviously and this is other"
"wild ok there's another question but we"
"have single-cell organisms that you"
"pointed out that like to get together"
"with other organisms to create all sorts"
"of interesting structures that being"
"said going into the concept of"
"remodeling of the brain obviously the"
"work by McConnell and in the 1950s and"
"Paul pshhh the University Indiana and"
"70s showed that you know you can destroy"
"quite a bit of the stuff in there of the"
"planarians and the frogs and you've also"
"pointed out metamorphic insects and so"
"forth in the paper take us on a little"
"path into the area of non central"
"nervous system information processing as"
"far as what we think of as humans are"
"our memories and I know this is a little"
"Tareq area but it is clearly something"
"that you know I think you're leading"
"them the the march towards us really"
"understanding what all these other"
"potential implications are for storing"
"this cognitive stuff yeah that's so"
"that's a very interesting question and"
"and because I think that evolution is"
"very continuous in the sense that"
"somatic information and behavioral"
"information are all have all have"
"fundamentally the same the same roots"
"and so even even unicellular organisms"
"can learn they can store memories some"
"of them can't anticipate so we have to"
"ask what does it mean to store learned"
"information in living tissue this is a"
"really a basic fundamental"
"like what is that what is a memory and"
"these are the kinds of things that"
"Warren McCulloch you know and the"
"founders a connection isn't really"
"struggled with like what what does it"
"actually mean to store a memory of"
"proposition you know a cup a logical"
"proposition and in memory so there is of"
"course this current paradigm which is"
"very much they call it a neural network"
"or or a connection this type of idea"
"which is that look what you have is"
"these if you have a you have a network"
"of these of these individual units or"
"cells and they can be triggered by"
"inputs and they can pass on their"
"outputs and when through various means"
"when the whole thing gets trained on a"
"bunch of stimuli all those little the"
"likelihood of one thing triggering"
"another thing gets adjusted to just the"
"right level so that as a whole its able"
"to let's say sort you know got pictures"
"of dogs from pictures of cats or some"
"such thing you know this is like modern"
"deep deep nets and and so on so the the"
"the the thing with this is and and of"
"course of course it's had lots of"
"success in specific specific fields"
"there are there's a problem with that as"
"a general explanation for how memory is"
"stored and and I'm not I'm certainly not"
"the the only one to have said this and"
"the most like some of the reason"
"excellent work comes from glance Minh at"
"the glance Minh lab on on transfer of"
"chemical memory it's been known for a"
"long time that as you say that memory is"
"remarkably robust to changes of the"
"underlying medium so for example a"
"caterpillar will learn something on the"
"project during the process of"
"metamorphosis of becoming a butterfly"
"the brain gets mostly dissolved or"
"remodeled a lot of the the neurons"
"either either die or or or the synaptic"
"connections are broken a completely"
"different brain is rebuilt and the"
"butterfly remembers the original"
"information so what is this telling us"
"about of course of course"
"the artificial neural networks don't"
"don't have this property right and we"
"don't in fact we don't have this is"
"something we're actually actively trying"
"to develop in our lab is the is"
"is a set of policies for a kind of an"
"and like scheme that would be robust to"
"these incredible deformations you know"
"when you regenerate a portion of your"
"brain what happens all of this is has"
"clinical implications because pretty"
"soon we'll be injecting naive stem cells"
"into the brain of 60 year old patients"
"that have you know six decades of"
"memories and then what happens it's a"
"personal identity what happens too right"
"so but but it also has really"
"fundamental implications of what does it"
"actually mean for a bunch of neurons to"
"store something you've learned we really"
"don't know I mean people study LTP and"
"and things like this but it's completely"
"unclear what it is so Warren McCulloch"
"was looking for an invariant he was"
"looking for some physical thing that is"
"the same whenever you think about a"
"particular concept that's the same right"
"if you think about your memory of you"
"know you probably have a memory of from"
"from your early childhood let's say"
"before you were 10 and and now however"
"many decades later here we are the"
"question is what physical structure has"
"actually stayed the same in your brain"
"that could possibly write what's a"
"candidate for something that's that"
"long-lived that doesn't change really"
"hard to visualize how that would work so"
"so between that and these kinds of"
"experiments on brain regeneration moving"
"of memories via chemical extracts the"
"old stuff from from Ongar and McConnell"
"and now the latest work by glance Minh"
"and others there's something fundamental"
"that we're missing about what memory is"
"and one possibility and I'm just I don't"
"have any proof of this I'm throwing this"
"out as a possibility one possibility is"
"that what the nervous system is for is"
"not storing the memories but the nervous"
"system is for is for interpreting the"
"information in the cells which might be"
"cytoskeletal it might be biochemical I"
"mean glance Minh takes its RNA you may"
"be the other lot of people like RNA as a"
"medium whatever it is you need to be"
"able to interpret it and one possibility"
"is that what the networks are for are in"
"the neural networks are for are for"
"interpreting that information and"
"turning it into signals to behavior"
"muscles glands whatnot so so that's"
"that's that's something that's the kind"
"of thing we think about it is"
"is entirely unknown it's saying that"
"memory is in the brain is like is like"
"saying that the anatomy of the body is"
"somehow in the DNA I mean it's a it's an"
"it's a simple thing to say and people"
"say it all the time it's very hard to"
"cash that out in a way that actually"
"makes sense"
"you know specifically it had there are"
"lots of difficulties with with"
"understanding how this works so yeah I"
"think I think it's a profound question"
"of what what what actually it means to"
"store memory I I like the fact that"
"you're out there asking these questions"
"so it's extremely important that someone"
"ask them obviously falls within your"
"within your speciality so I think it's"
"great you know coming back to you were"
"sort of the funding and of your programs"
"and so forth you know you you had a"
"rather large grant from Paul Allen's"
"frontiers group a couple years ago in"
"the late co-founder of Microsoft which"
"whose mission in this group was sort of"
"look at this thing's tears of science"
"and identifying pioneer explorers like"
"yourself a little big I always say I"
"come out of the traditional"
"pharmaceutical industry and you know"
"I've had my feet into venture capital"
"space and know-how sort of traditional"
"investors think in effect what is it"
"Billy what's your experience what's it"
"been like instead of championing some of"
"these new ideas I mean do you find it"
"easier nowadays that you have some of"
"this these other big guns behind you"
"because you are sort of really on on the"
"bleeding edge of stuff what sort of what"
"you've experienced out there in terms of"
"sort of 2020 funding for some of this"
"really cutting edge work yeah you know I"
"preface everything by saying that I'm"
"not complaining in the sense that we you"
"know it's been 20 odd years and we've"
"been generously supported by NIH NSF"
"dharmam you know so so I'm not"
"complaining by any means the reality is"
"a lot of funders are very risk-averse"
"and things that look like obvious great"
"things that once they're done and"
"published are inevitably the things that"
"people originally said okay but that's"
"never gonna work the previous X number"
"of things or but that that right there"
"that's never gonna work and then"
"afterwards people I got that's cool but"
"you're the next thing now that's"
"definitely not gonna work"
"so so people people are tend to be quite"
"risk-averse and I think it's it's people"
"as successful people are very well"
"calibrated on their own field and they"
"have their own frontier ideas that"
"they're willing to take bets on but"
"things that are in a different slightly"
"different feel that that you know is not"
"their favorite cup of tea they're much"
"less willing to to give benefit of the"
"doubt for novel just new ways of"
"thinking about it so that's just been my"
"experience so I think what we have tried"
"to do is to really target correctly what"
"the needs of a particular funder are so"
"so so for example if we're going for a"
"relationship with biotech we have to be"
"very clear about there's gonna be a"
"particular biomedical application at the"
"end of this you know they don't really"
"want to hear about philosophical"
"questions about what memory is and"
"things like this they want a clear path"
"to here's how we're gonna we're gonna"
"cure our XYZ right so so we have we have"
"work in limb regeneration for example"
"inducing limb regeneration and these are"
"you know this is there's there's some"
"there's some biotech funding around that"
"there are other funders that are"
"interested in much more basic kinds of"
"things so there was a you know those"
"that the Mathers foundation was very"
"good to us for some very basic initial"
"work on cracking the by Electric Code of"
"course the Alan frontiers group which"
"really got to God got our Center started"
"looking at this at this more for genetic"
"code what they call the dark matter of"
"biology that was Paul's Paul's phrase so"
"we're very grateful very grateful for"
"those kinds of things that support"
"frontier efforts in areas where you're"
"not sure what exactly yet"
"you're not sure what exactly the outcome"
"is going to look like you know and"
"that's very important because when for"
"traditional funders you need to be very"
"clearly specifying you very clearly"
"specify what the success and failure"
"criteria and what are you gonna produce"
"what are the deliverables and in order"
"to do that you kind of have to already"
"have mapped your area out pretty well if"
"you know what you're gonna get out the"
"other end and some projects are very"
"much like that where you can do that and"
"other projects you really can so we we"
"try for a mix of funders with different"
"preferences there are some that really"
"want the frontier stuff they want to be"
"at the cutting edge of new things and"
"others that really want to be pretty"
"practical about ok what are you gonna"
"get at the end of three or four years"
"and and it's a patchwork of it's it's a"
"lot of it's a lot of work actually it's"
"a lot of hard work producing a best case"
"for whatever we want to do for these for"
"these various things and and it's a real"
"mix of private and in public funders to"
"try to try to keep all this stuff afloat"
"because they all have they all have"
"different preferences of areas that they"
"want to advance great just two more two"
"more questions one is people watch the"
"show I usually give me the bio of my"
"guests to my kids to come up with some"
"interesting questions and this one is"
"from my my 12 year old daughter she"
"actually you know what months ago Josh"
"Kronberg came on the show to talk about"
"your your work with xeno bots and"
"actually right before that we had a"
"penny Boston from NASA who was running"
"things in astrobiology and my daughter"
"just wanted a and nothing confidential"
"of course but she was rather you know"
"impressed by all the potential stuff"
"that do a space and that these Zena bots"
"may be good alternatives to either"
"sending humans or robots to colonize"
"plans any any interesting Cosmo"
"biological stuff that that you can talk"
"about that you're doing or anything new"
"on the Xena BOTS front for that matter"
"she was rather interesting yeah sure"
"let's see well is so so for now the Xena"
"BOTS only operate in a in a water"
"environment of probably a pretty"
"reasonable room temperature so I"
"think I think it remains to be seen"
"exactly what the role of something like"
"a Xena ball would be in upper in unknown"
"environments where things are things are"
"very different I think about it in a"
"slightly different way however I I think"
"I see the Xena BOTS as a new model"
"system for life as it could be okay and"
"the idea is you know when we go out"
"there we are going to hopefully"
"encounter some really interesting"
"different kinds of environments and"
"we're going to have to answer an"
"interesting question is there life there"
"and right now we're operating with an N"
"of one example of what life looks like"
"it's the life here on earth and even"
"there there are some corner cases where"
"like it's a kind of unclear what's going"
"on there"
"there are some we in fact we're writing"
"I'm writing a review right now of some"
"of these weird cases where it's"
"completely unclear what the individual"
"is what's the organism is that you know"
"because they're all kinds of weird"
"configurations of different types of"
"cells living together and so on so so I"
"think that one thing we need to really"
"do is nail down what we mean by the"
"words organism alive evolution body"
"death all of these things we throw these"
"words around they're not obvious at all"
"and we're gonna we should nail them down"
"for our work here on earth but even more"
"importantly it's gonna be it's gonna be"
"critical so that we we have some idea of"
"knowing what we're looking at when we"
"see lots of complex things happening and"
"we have to say so is that biofilm is"
"that a single organism is that a you"
"know you can imagine these scenarios"
"where they don't even know the right"
"scale is that just chemistry or is that"
"actually alive is this thing learning is"
"it what where's the which part of this"
"is the organism so it's much less"
"obvious than it seems and the xeno bots"
"are a good example of that so I'm in the"
"process now of writing a paper on the"
"sort of philosophical implications of"
"these inner BOTS and one of the things"
"about the the ones that we've made is"
"you take cells from an organism and you"
"liberate them from"
"you know the frog as it were and they re"
"envision their multicellularity and they"
"assemble something completely different"
"this time around they do they have a"
"different shape and structure and if you"
"chop them into pieces the pieces do"
"something else that's completely"
"different and so one thing you could"
"imagine is is and and I start off this"
"paper like like this imagine imagine the"
"following scenario so you're exploring a"
"planet you see this animal and the"
"animals running around doing things and"
"then it dies the animal dies but we all"
"know that when a body dies most of the"
"cells are usually alive right it's right"
"and so and in fact there have been"
"studies of people you know recovering"
"and culturing cells from cadavers that"
"are quite old and things like this right"
"so in the in an appropriate environment"
"so let's say this is an aquatic animal"
"like a frog or a fish it's entirely"
"feasible that the individual cells or at"
"least some individual cells after the"
"organism dies disband and continue their"
"life as unicellular forms tumor cells"
"can do this we already know they can do"
"this and so you might imagine this this"
"on another planet you might imagine this"
"interesting a life cycle where there's a"
"multicellular body but after death the"
"body's gone but most of the cells go on"
"and the genome continues itself as a"
"kind of unicellular you you know as a"
"set of amoebas basically and we know"
"that being an amoeba is a viable"
"lifestyle plenty right do it so there's"
"really no reason why that couldn't be"
"and then some of them may or may not get"
"together again as as for example"
"Dictyostelium amoebas do and form a new"
"body reverse so it's sort of a reversal"
"back and forth of a developmental"
"process and they could they may or may"
"not recombine with others it may be"
"cyclical it may not but you could"
"imagine these really weird cases in the"
"biosphere that becomes so now you know"
"you you have an organism where the"
"genome of the amoeba is exactly the same"
"as the genome of the organism and so"
"that might be your first clue that"
"something like this is happening whether"
"that happens on earth I have no idea we"
"can certainly do it artificially as we"
"all know in the lab"
"whether that happens in nature we don't"
"know I mean some cancer cells you know"
"like Tasmanian Devil cancer spreads it"
"hops from animal to animal so those"
"animals those cells can actually move on"
"when they if despite whatever else"
"happens to the host they can move on so"
"so I only bring up that example to say"
"that the zone ibattz aside from like"
"very practical applications you know"
"maybe they're cleaning up waterways"
"maybe they're exploring searching for"
"something maybe they're working inside"
"the body to clean out cancer so there's"
"a million applications but aside from"
"all of that I think what they're telling"
"us is that life is incredibly plastic"
"even life that occurred here and I'm"
"sure I'm sure Josh bong I've mentioned"
"this but our Santa bots are as far as"
"I'm aware the only creature whose"
"evolution didn't take place in the"
"biosphere their evolution took place in"
"a virtual world of bond guards computers"
"the cells evolved here but those cells"
"evolved to sit quietly on the outers"
"outside of a frog and keep out the"
"pathogens they certainly did the but the"
"bodies of these enter BOTS that run"
"around and do various things that has"
"never existed in their history before"
"they were not bad and so that just tells"
"you this is so I think I think what's"
"what's important about this and and"
"space exploration is that it opens your"
"eyes to the the no doubt immense variety"
"that we could see out there of ways of"
"being alive and I think you know our our"
"imagination for sure is is too tightly"
"constrained by this one example that"
"we've seen which is through the earth"
"the amazing is that that shape-shifting"
"organism potentially keeps the memory of"
"every multicellular one that died before"
"it that's kind of what planaria do right"
"so planaria reproduced by fissioning and"
"planaria definitely learned from"
"experience now how long do they remember"
"we don't know is there much for them to"
"learn sitting in a Tupperware container"
"of water I'm not sure you know if"
"there's anything exciting for them to"
"remember but it's not impossible I think"
"it's a possibility"
"my last question we we have our guests"
"respond to it just it really about the"
"influencers and mentors sort of that"
"have been with you along this path that"
"I've you know kept you interested in"
"this domain as you've gone along and if"
"you know it wasn't for them that you"
"know you'd be off doing something"
"totally different any specific people no"
"doubt you've known a lot throughout your"
"career but any one you want to highlight"
"here shout out to at this point in the"
"show yeah there have been there's been a"
"lot of mentors and people that I look up"
"to I think the most obvious one is Susan"
"Ernst who she's now retired but she was"
"a developmental biologist at Tufts when"
"I was a student and making my decision"
"to get into biology in addition to the"
"computer science that I was doing I knew"
"zero biology I approached her to do"
"research in the lab and we work together"
"for for several years and and and she"
"was really instrumental in my entry into"
"into biology and then of course during"
"grad school my PhD mentor cliff Tabin"
"with whom I still work he's in fact a"
"member of our Alan Discovery Center he"
"really was that that time period in his"
"mentorship was instrumental for me to"
"see what modern biology was like what"
"the tools are what you know what what"
"are the what are the state-of-the-art"
"approaches to genetic understanding of"
"life and and he both both in the subject"
"matter but also how to do high high"
"impact science with with real integrity"
"you know he was kind of a an amazing"
"example of that my postdoc mentor Mark"
"Mercola who by then I was sort of"
"talking to people about some of my crazy"
"ideas whereas before I kind of kept it"
"kept things wraps but but by the time I"
"was in Mark's lab I started talking"
"about these things and and and he was"
"pretty helpful in in guiding me the to"
"to to to funding and to get my first"
"independent position and so on lots of"
"other people I work with you know Don"
"Ingeborg was always a huge inspiration"
"to me because of his work and just his"
"approach to science people people like"
"that so yeah lots I mean - too many to"
"mention but those are some big names"
"sure well it's it's really been an honor"
"having you join us today every followed"
"you for years I've always been amazed by"
"your your thought leadership in this"
"really this frontier area that has so"
"wide a set of potential from embryology"
"regenerative medicine to oncology and"
"understanding the basics of you know"
"what goes on in here it's uh it's really"
"great so I really wishing you the best"
"on it and for everybody that's it's"
"gonna be listening on the various"
"podcast networks or watching on the You"
"Tube channel you've had the the honor of"
"being joined by dr. michael levin tufts"
"university professor"
"Vannevar Bush endowed chair in the"
"biology department director of the TUF"
"center for gender and developmental"
"biology and director of the Alan"
"Discovery Center at Tufts Mike thank you"
"for for taking the time to come on the"
"show thank you for everything that"
"you've been doing and continue to do and"
"as we say thank you for moving the human"
"story forward but in this case thanks"
"for moving the cedar bus story forward"
"as well and we're really gonna be"
"watching this as everything moves"
"forward because it's it's truly amazing"
"thank you so much I really appreciate"
"the chance to talk to you about this"
"it's been a lot of fun and thank you for"
"your support"
