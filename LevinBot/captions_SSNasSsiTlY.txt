"and yeah take it away here we go yeah"
"thank you so much um really appreciate"
"the opportunity to um uh be here and to"
"share some uh share some thoughts with"
you
"um what I'm going to do today is uh you"
"know when when I got the description of"
"the department and how wide uh the"
"interests here are I I try to um sort of"
"put something for everyone so this uh"
"this talk has a mix of things which"
"could could work well or could go badly"
"so we'll see but there are some very"
"very uh specific things in terms of"
"biomedicine and how we try to approach"
"uh regenerative kinds of Therapeutics"
"and and so on but at the same time I try"
"to really cover some pretty pretty uh"
"philosophical ideas uh some very basic"
"things on the nature of cognition and"
"things I've been working on as far as"
"understanding what selves are and how"
"how Minds scale from the simplest"
"organisms and to me it's really"
"important that that these two things are"
"tightly connected so so in my group"
"um any of the conceptual Frameworks that"
"we make are meant to drive new science"
"forward and that's how we think we know"
"we're on the right track or Not by"
"seeing uh what kind of discoveries"
"including Therapeutics now these things"
"are able to push forward and we like to"
"take the findings that we have and use"
"them to sharpen our philosophical"
"intuition so we'll see um to what extent"
"that's that's possible so uh anybody"
"that's interested in the primary data"
"the uh the software the you know all the"
"original figures everything can be found"
"at this website so please um don't"
"hesitate to contact me if you want to um"
"ask questions later or download things"
"and so on so let's just start with this"
"um this is a classic"
"a very classic painting called Adam is"
"naming the animals in the Garden of Eden"
"and the idea behind this back in the day"
"was that um names are very powerful"
"names that were supposed to reveal the"
"true nature of something and in"
"particular names uh four specific things"
"suggest crisp categories that's one of"
"the things I want to try and blow up"
"today is this is this idea that there"
"are these particular natural kinds that"
"we have to we have to keep fixed and so"
"you can start out this way and and many"
"people do that"
"um uh we've got this we've got this idea"
"of a human a standard uh human and that"
"standard human has a sort of um an"
"agential glow about him that uh that"
"doesn't really extend very well to the"
"rest of Nature and that when you try to"
"understand where these complex cognitive"
"capacities come from uh oftentimes"
"people say things like well that's"
"anthropomorphizing meaning that you're"
"taking something that that uh is is"
"magical it's it's only in humans and"
"it's really inappropriate to see it in"
"other places"
"but if we take Evolution and"
"developmental biology seriously we find"
"out that well this human is actually a"
"Continuum of selves first of all"
"certainly on an evolutionary time scale"
"right so so so there were these humans"
"and then some other types of humans and"
"some stuff before that but even at the"
"lifetime within the scale of the"
"lifetime of this individual uh we we"
"come from a series of Transformations"
"and and there are other places where"
"these Transformations are very"
"interesting in the in the world for"
example
"here is a caterpillar this soft-bodied"
"creature lives in the two-dimensional"
"World it eats leaves it has a brain"
"that's suitable for that kind of purpose"
"eventually it has to transform into this"
"completely different creature that has"
"to live in a three-dimensional world"
"that flies it drinks nectar doesn't care"
"about the leaves anymore and so during"
"this process what happens is that the"
"brain is basically dissolved most of the"
"connections are broken many of the cells"
"are killed off by apoptosis and a new"
"brain is rebuilt a couple of interesting"
"things one is that there's pretty good"
"evidence that memories survive this"
"process so if you train the caterpillar"
"on something The Moth or butterfly will"
"remember the original information that's"
"despite the fact that this the memory"
"medium supposedly the brain is being"
"thoroughly sort of trashed and redone"
"the other thing is that uh this has this"
"has uh interesting sort of philosophical"
"implications because as you think about"
"what's it like to be a butterfly you can"
"take that question one step further and"
"you ask well what's it like to be a"
"caterpillar slowly changing into a"
"butterfly and that makes the changes"
"that we undergo let's say during puberty"
"or so on make make them seem rather"
"minor but in any case we really need to"
"understand what it means to remain the"
"same and for example using a continuity"
"of memories here and what it means to"
"change and and what happens to our our"
"self during that process it's actually"
"even worse than than this this is"
"already sort of disturbing enough but"
"it's actually worse than that because"
"you can go lateral and we now know that"
"using a synthetic biology bioengineering"
"at every level of biology we can"
"substitute various kinds of engineered"
"um or or in fact biological other"
"systems and so we can make all sorts of"
"Weird Hybrids and and and and of course"
"instrumentize and and um I have all"
"kinds of extensions and and so there's a"
"Continuum not only here but there's a"
"Continuum of all kinds of possible"
"beings here and so what we find out is"
"that while many of our categories are"
"sort of discrete with the actual"
"underlying biologies is quite continuous"
"all these changes can be made extremely"
"small and we need Frameworks to deal"
"with all of this so I've been working on"
"on this this idea of um creating a"
"framework that would allow us to think"
"about simultaneously not just familiar"
"kinds of intelligences so that would be"
"that would be humans uh other other"
"mammals birds maybe an octopus"
"um we need to have a framework that"
"handles f everything so all kinds of"
"weird creatures Colonial organisms"
"swarms new synthetic life forms that had"
"that don't exist yet but are going to so"
"all kinds of strange bioengineer things"
"software intelligences and someday"
"perhaps even exobiological agents so so"
"we need to understand what are the"
"invariants what is what what do all of"
"these things have in common I think it's"
"completely implausible to think that"
"everywhere in the universe the only"
"thing that has true cognition must have"
"a brain that looks like ours in a"
"frontal cortex and all that so we need"
"to go beyond that and we need to"
"understand what what do all these"
"different embodiments of of of of of"
"agency have in common"
"so this of course is is not the first"
"time people have recognized the need for"
"that so so here in the in the 1940s"
"rosenbluth wiener and Bigelow already"
"started on a cybernetic framework"
"starting with very simple passive kinds"
"of breitenberg vehicles and and very"
"simple um kind of agents and try to lay"
"out a map of some of the great"
"transitions but really understanding"
"that these are all all of the beings"
"from the simplest to the most complex"
"with the human metacognition and"
"whatever happens to be Beyond they're"
"all part of one spectrum and then there"
"are certainly steps on that Spectrum but"
"they're all part of one Spectrum then"
"the other nice thing about this kind of"
"framework is that doesn't say anything"
"about brains and it doesn't say anything"
"about whether something was evolved or"
"designed it's uh it's very um it's very"
"functional I think this is and I think"
"this is the right way to think about it"
"so uh I uh because because I'm really"
"interested in uh kinds of uh conceptual"
"Frameworks that help research directly I"
"tried to come up with a with a scheme"
"that wasn't really wasn't founded on on"
"on the philosophical aspects but really"
"from a very engineering perspective"
"right and so so what I have here is"
"something I call an axis of"
"persuadability and these are just four"
"sort of way points on that axis there"
"are many many more but what it tries to"
"do is it tries to tell you that whatever"
"system you're looking at whether it be"
"living or non-living or whatever it"
"might be uh the real question is how do"
"we relate to it meaning that what is the"
"most efficient way to uh make"
"predictions and make changes in the"
"function of that system and and and"
"specifically to insist that that is an"
"empirical question you can't sort of sit"
"in your philosophical armchair and say I"
"don't believe uh this thing has any"
"intelligence or or it does or whatever"
"you have to make a model you have to uh"
"choose what kind of tool you're going to"
"use along the spectrum of of"
"persuadability and then we have to see"
"and we have to check and see if that"
"actually gives you efficient control so"
"you can imagine in having certain"
"systems that are like this that are"
"basically the only way you're ever going"
"to change the action of that system is"
"physical rewiring you're not going to"
"convince it of anything you're not going"
"to punish it into anything you just have"
"to rewire the hardware bottom up and"
"then there are some more complex systems"
"like thermostats and and so on where"
"something interesting happens you can"
"change the action of this very primitive"
"goal directed system by resetting the"
"set point you don't have to rewire it"
"you just set this to change the set"
"point and in fact you don't even really"
"have to understand how all of it works"
"once you know how to read and write that"
"set point right the system takes care of"
"the rest that really comes into its own"
"with more complex systems that you can"
"train with rewards and punishments this"
"is why humans have been able to train"
"horses and dogs for thousands of years"
"knowing zero Neuroscience okay because"
"what it does is you're able to depending"
"on where your system fits on this"
"spectrum you're able to progressively"
"offload all of the complexity and ex and"
"and really explore onto the system and"
"really exploit the interface that it's"
"giving this thing offers min minimal"
"interfaces this thing offers a little"
"bit and this thing offers way more and"
"then of course we can um you know human"
"level communication offers an amazingly"
"Rich interface and so this this will"
"become very important because we're"
"going to talk about what this means for"
"regenerative medicine specifically this"
"idea that you cannot simply guess where"
"things are so"
"um here's uh here's here's one example"
"so you look at something like this and"
"you this is a a pathway a gene"
"regulatory Network a protein pathway"
"some something like that and you might"
"look at this and you might say well I"
"can see every element of this there's"
"there's no magic here no um there's"
"nowhere to hide this thing is the uh"
"kind of the epitome of a"
"deterministic of a reductionist to kind"
"of model each gene turns another one on"
"and off that's it right that's got to be"
"the the the level of agency of this"
"thing has got to be zero that's the"
"standard assumption so we decided to do"
"an experiment what if we uh we assume uh"
"for the purposes of the experiment that"
"this thing uh is is somewhere else on"
"this uh on this Continuum actually"
"somewhere around here and we start to"
"treat some of these nodes as uh as as"
"inputs for as a conditioned stimulus and"
"an unconditioned stimulus and a and a"
"response and when you do that and I"
"don't have the time to go into all of"
"this but you can look at these two"
"papers you find out that biological Gene"
"regulatory networks not random networks"
"only the biological ones which makes me"
"think that Evolution must like this this"
feature
"um they have six different they exhibit"
"six different kinds of learning so so"
"this is purely at the dynamical system"
"level this is without rewiring anything"
"we're not changing the connections we're"
"not changing the weights simply by"
"virtue of experience things like"
"presenting multiple stimuli and looking"
"to see whether it learns to associate"
"them actually even this very simple"
"system can do can do some some really"
"interesting sophisticated things so what"
"we're seeing is that if you're if you're"
"willing to to take this as an"
"experimental a kind of a question you"
"can borrow interesting tools from"
"cognitive and Behavioral Science uh to"
"do things in that system that you"
"couldn't do before and we're now"
"pursuing this of course at the bench in"
"in biomedical context to deal with"
"things like"
"um uh drug habituation and uh you know"
"the fact that Pharmaceuticals often stop"
"working after a while and so on so um"
"the the the fundamental so let's talk"
"about uh let's talk about kind of the"
"scaling of of this cognition"
"um all of us uh all of us take this"
"amazing journey from quote unquote just"
"physics so uh the pile of chemicals in"
"an unfertilized oocyte to eventually"
"something like this or maybe even"
"something like this and when when we as"
"as adult humans will say things like"
"well we are not we are different than"
"that we are not machines and we are"
"different than other other you know"
"creatures and so on we have to keep in"
"mind that we kind of assume that here we"
"are as a finished product but this"
"process is extremely slow and gradual"
"there is no developmental biology offers"
"no sharp magical line at which point"
"boom before that was just physics but"
"now we have we have real cognition"
"there's no line like that so we really"
"have to understand how this process"
"happens it's the most you know sort of"
"the most magical um I think I think the"
"developmental biology is kind of the"
"most magical science there is so"
"um what what is that what is it that"
"that actually scales up here well one"
"thing that we sometimes talk about is uh"
"the fact that there are these Collective"
"intelligences and people we'll talk"
"about ant colonies and termites and be"
"you know bird flocks and things as a as"
"a collective intelligence"
"um and then they will say well that that"
"may or may not be a collective"
"intelligence but we are certainly a"
"unified uh centralized intelligence yeah"
"we are not like a like a collection of"
"uh you know like like a collection of of"
ants
"um but of course if you zoom in you find"
"out that uh all intelligence is"
"collective intelligence because we are"
"all made of parts and components so Rene"
"Descartes was interested in the pineal"
"gland because he said there was only one"
"of them in the brain unlike other paired"
"structures and and he thought that was"
"very significant but of course if you"
"what really is there one of if you if"
"you zoom in you find out that that's"
"full of cells and each and even inside"
"each one of these cells is all this"
"stuff right so so a tremendous uh amount"
"of components within components within"
"components so it's really hard to find"
"anything that's unified in any"
"interesting way well we always have to"
"understand the scaling so uh we come"
"from something that uh roughly"
"approximates this this is of course a"
"free living organism but this is a"
"unicellular called alacromeria so these"
"things uh you can see there's no brain"
"there's no nervous system there are no"
"stem cells there's no cell to cell"
"communication uh but what it's very good"
"at is handling all of its local goals in"
"uh in its local uh local um at its local"
"scale so unicellular goals so all of its"
"morphological needs its metabolic needs"
"it's physiological needs are all met"
"here in the scale and the amazing thing"
"is that when these things get together"
"and an individual unicellular organisms"
"get together they're able to pursue very"
"large scale projects instead of single"
"cell kinds of things this is the sort of"
"thing they make they work together to uh"
"to create something very very large and"
"we'll talk about that"
"now what does all this have to do with"
"with intelligence"
"um so so Alan Turing um who probably"
"needs no introduction uh was really"
"interested in intelligence in Computing"
"and in uh what is what is common to all"
"intelligence what is thinking and how"
"does it exist in the physical world"
"now interestingly you also wrote a paper"
"on morphogenesis on the origin of order"
"in chemical systems that would be"
"important for developmental biology now"
"you might it might seem kind of strange"
"why would somebody who was interested in"
"computation and intelligence be looking"
"at uh chemical morphogenesis and I think"
"that he saw a very profound unification"
"I think he's absolutely right because"
"um I think that the fundamentally these"
"are the same problem these are exactly"
"the same problem and um and I think and"
"I think Turing saw that um here's here's"
"a simple simple example when we look at"
"an embryonic blastoderm so let's say um"
"you know maybe 50 000 cells of some sort"
"of amnio embryo uh you might look at"
"that you might say well there's an"
"embryo there's one embryo there and now"
"we ask what exactly are we counting when"
"we say there's one embryo because there"
"are many many cells and you might say"
"well now what you're counting is is uh"
"the fact that uh these cells will"
"cooperate towards one particular outcome"
"meaning the one one particular um more"
"morphological uh morphological outcome"
"but what's interesting and I I used to"
"do this this work as a grad student you"
"can you can take a needle and make"
"little scratches in that Blaster and"
"before they heal up what they're going"
"to do is each region here because the"
"local activation long-range inhibition"
"doesn't cross the the the the scratch"
"each region will get independently"
"aligned and make its own embryo and then"
"the thing heals up and then you end up"
"with conjoined twins or triplets or"
"whatever so you end up something like"
"this where these these regions of"
"embryos and then some cells in between"
"that aren't quite sure who they're part"
"of but let's just keep in mind that that"
"the question of how many embryos there"
"are is not obvious upfront it's"
"certainly not genetically determined uh"
"this is a system that can that can"
"self-organize some number from zero to"
"you know probably less than 10 typically"
"uh of individuals that you need to uh"
"that you need to count and so this this"
"individuation this process of becoming"
"an individual from a from a pool of of"
"uh of of cells and how many are going to"
"be there and who is who's my neighbor"
"and where do I end and somebody else"
"begins this is this is all right there"
"at the very beginning of development and"
"it's also there in cognitive science"
"because if somebody were to show you a"
"human brain and you didn't already know"
"what a human was and they asked you how"
"many how many individuals you think live"
"in here right how many selves can this"
"think uh house you would actually have"
"no idea we don't we don't know and in"
"fact uh in advance you can't guess that"
"in advance"
"um and we have a very similar issue in"
"terms of uh you have some sort of medium"
"and within that Medium you self-organize"
"specific higher level structures"
"um which and and much like with embryos"
"it has a failure mode right so we have"
"we can have split brain patients with"
"different opinions in the two"
"hemispheres about things we can have all"
"kinds of dissociative disorders and"
"different personalities that live in the"
"same brain and so on so this this issue"
"of many to one the scaling is is is"
"exactly the same uh in across these"
"across these domains so here's here are"
"kind of the main points for today this"
"is what I'd like to transmit that if we"
"treat these questions as an engineering"
problem
"um we can we can develop an empirical"
"approach that uh really tries to find"
"the invariance between very diverse"
"kinds of intelligences and one way to"
"think about that is the size of the"
"goals that they're capable of pursuing"
"and I'm going to talk about this at the"
"towards the end this cognitive light"
"cone model that tries to capture this"
"notion of the size of the goals that A"
"system can can follow and then towards"
"the end we're going to talk about a"
"synthetic bioengineering and um what it"
"means that that actually there's a"
"there's an astronomically large latent"
"space of possible bodies and Minds"
"outside of the the end of one example"
"that we see in the on Earth and that's"
"uh that has huge implications for all"
"kinds of things Evolution uh Robotics"
"and and ethics most of all so the middle"
"part of the talk what I'm going to do is"
"spend a bunch of time talking about"
"morphogenesis developmental"
"morphogenesis as just one example it's"
"my favorite example and there are many"
"others of collective intelligence"
"solving problems in the space which is"
"anatomical morphe space so and I'm going"
"to talk about a mechanism that I think"
"uh functions as this kind of uh"
"cognitive glue that binds individual"
"cells into a collective intelligence"
"that solves these kinds of problems so"
"so there'll be four four basic sections"
"uh we're already started talking about"
"um this idea of a broadening what what"
"we think uh an agent is and then we'll"
"talk about the anatomical control and"
"then some some more conceptual stuff and"
"then I want to show you some synthetic"
"organisms after that"
"um one of the one of the model systems"
"that we that we deal with is these these"
"plan areas these are flatworms uh they"
"have many amazing features one of them"
"is that if you cut off a certain uh"
"certain regions of the body let's say"
"the head and the Brain uh they will"
"regenerate it and so one of the things"
"that was found by McConnell in the 60s"
"and then we proved it uh using modern"
"technology he was he was right we made"
"an automated machine to test this"
"if you if you train this planarian it's"
"got a centralized brain and it learns"
"that this little bumpy region here is"
"where it gets fed you can then amputate"
"the brain uh since the tail sits there"
"doing nothing for a couple of days a"
"couple of for a week and a half let's"
"say and then it grows the new brain and"
"at that point you will see evidence that"
"it still remembers the original"
"information and so now uh it's very"
"interesting because you see from here"
"that a learned information can be stored"
"apparently outside of the brain b that"
"it can be imprinted onto the new brain"
"tissue as it develops"
um
"see you see this this tight integration"
"of uh behavioral memories and"
"morphogenetic memories because this"
"thing also has to uh be able to"
"restructure uh correctly all of the new"
"cells and you can also do this"
"interesting from sort of philosophy 101"
"this broken transporter kind of"
"experiment right with let's say there's"
"a transporter in it you step in it it"
"transport you somewhere else but it"
"forgets to delete the original and now"
"there's two of you while in planaria you"
"can actually do that experiment you can"
"cut this thing in many into many pieces"
"all of them share the original"
"information which is the original one"
"right so this this plasticity this"
"incredible plasticity a lot of our"
"concepts are start to get start to get"
"really fuzzy"
"um that plasticity is not just for uh"
"invertebrates so here is a tadpole of"
"the Frog xenopus labus you will see that"
"there are no eyes up here we've"
"prevented the normal eyes here's the"
"mouth here the nostrils the brain but"
"what we did do is put a put an eye some"
"eye cell some eye primordial cells on"
"the tail not only do these eye"
"primordial cells develop into is just"
"fine even though they're sitting next to"
"muscle and instead of up in the brain"
"where they belong but it turns out that"
"when they put out their their optic"
"nerve sometimes it finds the spinal cord"
"sometimes not but they can see quite"
"well so we built this machine this is"
"what we also used to test the planaria"
"and we find out that we can train them"
"for visual cues they do they they do"
"quite well in in learning to uh stay out"
"of various kinds of light stimuli and so"
"on and so you can see the incredible"
"plasticity here it doesn't need uh long"
"periods of adaptation to have a"
"completely different"
"um uh sensory motor architecture so this"
"is uh you know and of course the"
"plasticity of the brain in terms of um"
"uh kinds of sensory augmentation and"
"things like that people have done these"
"studies of mammals too but um this just"
"this just tells you that that that you"
"don't need a long periods of adaptation"
"for this the the system is already"
"poised to accept all kinds of changes to"
"the standard status quo and that's going"
"to be very important shortly"
"so how we think about these things is"
"that biology has this um"
"multi-scale competency architecture that"
"not only are we nested dolls of"
"different levels right so organs and"
"tissues and cells and so on but actually"
"each level solves problems in its own"
"space it's not structural it's not only"
"structural it's actually"
"um of of a functional"
"um little problem solver in various"
"spaces now what do I mean by these"
"spaces now one thing that our uh"
"perceptual systems are very good at is"
"recognizing intelligence in"
"three-dimensional space so medium-sized"
"objects moving at medium speeds and"
"three-dimensional space we are very good"
"at detecting agency detecting"
"intelligent Behavior we we know when"
"we're looking at Iraq or a mouse or or"
"something else but imagine for a moment"
"if you had an internal sense of your"
"blood chemistry if you could feel your"
"blood chemistry and all its different uh"
"different aspects the way that we"
"perceive let's say with vision and so on"
"I think you we would then have no"
"problem recognizing that the things that"
"our liver and kidneys and other organs"
"are doing on a daily basis are"
"intelligent behavior in physiological"
"space in the space of possible"
"physiological States so there are"
"amazing examples which we can talk about"
"after I don't have time to go through"
"them all of uh behavior in physiological"
"space behavior in transcriptional space"
"so walking around this this High"
"dimensional manifold of all the"
"different uh gene expression patterns"
"that a cell could have and my favorite"
"which is morphospace the space of"
"possible anatomical configurations of a"
"given organism and one way to think"
"about this is that Evolution reuses some"
"of the same tricks some of the same"
"navigation tricks which you people who"
"work on autonomous vehicles and Robotics"
"use exactly the same tricks to uh solve"
"problems in different spaces and from"
"the simplest organisms all the way up to"
"behavioral and then even linguistic in"
"humans it basically pivots some of the"
"same tricks in the same mechanisms in"
"fact to navigate all these different"
"spaces so what I want to do now is drill"
down
"into some examples in one particular"
"kind of space which is anatomical morphe"
"space so here's what the problem looks"
"like here's how we start life so a"
"collection of blastomers this is a cross"
"section through a human torso so so look"
"at all the amazing uh the the all the"
"tissues the organs everything is is in"
"the right place the right size of the"
"with the right neighbors pointed in the"
"right direction where does this order"
"come from and the the typical easy"
"answer is while it's in the it's in the"
"DNA and of course we can we can read"
"genomes now we know what's in the DNA it"
"isn't any of this what's in the DNA is"
"the spec they're directly is the"
"specification of the micro level"
"Hardware that every cell gets to have"
"the proteins"
"and and using that uh using that"
"Hardware all of these cells undergo a"
"physiological process that generates"
"reliably generates this order so we what"
"we would like to understand is how does"
"how does this group of cells know what"
"to make if uh if this part is missing"
"how do we convince these cells to to"
"rebuild how do we make them recreate"
"complex structures for regenerative"
"medicine purpose and as engineers and"
"I'll show you this towards the end of"
"the talk as Engineers uh we'd like to"
"know uh what else can they build the"
"exact same cells what what can we get"
"them what what can we get them to build"
"and so in thinking about"
"um uh the end game of this uh of this"
"whole field you know when when can we go"
"home uh I I think it's useful to think"
"about something like this as a Target to"
"shoot for um a kind of a design of um"
"challenge what we need is an anatomical"
"compiler an anatomical compiler is"
"something that uh future people will be"
"able to sit down in front of the"
"computer and draw the plant or animal"
"that they want whatever it looks like it"
"may be a normal organ it may be"
"something completely crazy an alien but"
"they should be able to draw any organ"
"any structure that they want and if we"
"knew what we were doing the system would"
"uh compile that description into a set"
"of stimuli that would have to be given"
"to cells to get them to build exactly"
"that right anything so so complete"
"control now crucial to note the"
"anatomical compiler is not a 3D printer"
"the point is not to micromanage the"
"cells and put them exactly where you"
"want the point is uh to communicate to"
"the the collective the large-scale"
"structure that that they need to build"
"exactly uh the way that this happens"
"under under normal uh standard"
"conditions now why do we need such a"
"thing well among among other things"
"because every problem in biomedicine"
"with the exception of infectious disease"
"so everything else birth defects"
"traumatic injury cancer aging degenerate"
"disease all of this would be solved if"
"we understood how to get collections of"
"cells to go to a particular region of"
"anatomical amorphous space to make the"
"right kinds of organs with the right"
"shape we have almost no no clue how how"
"to do that now there's been amazing"
"process progress in genetics and and"
"molecular biology so why why don't why"
"don't we already have that well here's"
"this very simple example this is a baby"
"Axolotl and baby axolotls have legs this"
"is a larva of a frog xenopus labus these"
"tadpoles don't have legs at these stages"
"one of the things we do in our lab to"
"try to understand the scaling of of"
"these of this morphological outcomes is"
"we make frog a lottles so frogalotel is"
"part Axolotl part uh part frog and now I"
"ask a very simple question you've got"
"the genome for the Axolotl you've got"
"the genome for the Frog full genomic"
"sequences can you tell me if a frog is"
"going to have legs or not"
"and we have basically no Frameworks"
"whatsoever to answer this question uh we"
"just we just have a very poor"
"understanding of how large-scale"
"Collective decisions are made by uh by"
"components whose molecular biology we do"
"understand vehicle you have quite well"
"so so where we are is this the field is"
"very good at manipulating this kind of"
"information or actually a very long way"
"from doing what we really want which is"
"a complete control over Form and"
"Function and"
"um I would like to argue that that I"
"think where biomedicine today is where"
"computer science was in the 40s and 50s"
"this is what programming looked like"
"back then you physically have to"
"interact with the hardware that should"
"sound very familiar all of today's most"
"exciting molecular medicine is crispr"
"genomic editing uh pathway rewiring"
"protein engineering protein structure"
"all focused at the hardware right and"
"the fact that um you know all my"
"students laugh when I say how come how"
"come you don't program your laptop with"
"a soldering iron today and and this this"
"idea that that we've learned to take"
"advantage of this of of the software"
"layers we've learned to take advantage"
"of a a more a more powerful higher level"
"interface you don't have to do"
"everything at the at the hardware level"
"and this is this is what we are trying"
"to do in my group so one of the specific"
"things that we want to take advantage of"
"in these systems is their uh their"
"intelligence this is this is what I"
"think we can really capitalize on what"
"do I mean by intelligence I like William"
"James's definition which is the ability"
"to reach the same goal by different"
"means that's it he's not talking about"
"how much brain you have or what kind of"
"brain you have this is a this is a nice"
"very generic definition that admits of a"
"whole Spectrum from extremely simple to"
"uh to to extremely sophisticated so I"
"want to show you some examples of this"
"kind of intelligence so I don't mean"
"human level I don't mean linguistic I"
"mean different degrees of the ability to"
"reach the same goal by different means"
"when you are interfered with so here are"
"some examples of what morphogenesis can"
"do this is the kind of the most obvious"
"one it's regeneration so this is an"
"axolotl a Mexican salamander regenerates"
"its eyes its jaws its legs many other"
"organs if you amputate anywhere along"
"the limb these cells rapidly grow and uh"
"do all kinds of things that get you back"
"to the correct shape if you keep cutting"
"fingers it will keep regenerating no"
"individual cell knows what a finger is"
"or how many it's supposed to have but"
"the collective absolutely does and you"
"know that because you can try to deviate"
"it you can try to to mess with the"
"structure and they will always expend"
"energy to try to get back to that same"
"region of morphe space and when does it"
"stop it stops when it has succeeded it"
"stops when it has made a correct"
"salamander limb by the way uh wolf you"
"know worms and amphibians are not the"
"only ones that do this"
"um uh humans regenerate their livers"
"deer large adult mammal regenerates uh"
"tons of uh bone and and innervation and"
"vasculature every year right in these"
"antlers and even human children can"
"regrow their their fingertips so this is"
"this is a very um generic kind of"
"capacity so so so one thing is is that"
"you're able to reliably when you are"
"deviated let's say surgically or by"
"other amines you're able to uh go back"
"to that you're able to navigate back to"
"this the correct region of morphospace"
"now the path that you take is not"
"necessarily the same one that you tread"
"earlier so for example"
"um the way that frog limbs develop"
"originally is you get this flat paddle"
"and then you kill off a bunch of cells"
"in between the fingers and now you've"
"got this now you've got this nice limb"
"um in a story I'm going to show you in a"
"minute when we induce leg regeneration"
"in frogs which normally don't regenerate"
"their legs what we found is that they"
"don't do this at all they grow like this"
"there's a central kind of stock and off"
"of that will come fingers and a toenail"
"the most distal part is already here"
"it's it's much more like like like a"
"plant grows it's not like this at all"
"it's a completely different path through"
"morphe space that nevertheless gets you"
"to the same final outcome this is still"
"this is still early the leg's still"
"growing but look at the look at these"
"distal elements I mean very very"
"um very nice leg so so you can get to"
"where you need to go despite"
"perturbations you can do it via novel"
"paths and this is maybe my favorite"
"example ever now this is kind of kind of"
remarkable
um
"this this uh this was discovered uh in"
"the in the 1940s this is a cross-section"
"through a kidney tubule in the Newt and"
"normally there are eight to ten cells"
"that get together and they build this"
"thing one thing you can do is uh is you"
"can make these polyploid nudes which"
"have multiple copies of of the whole"
"genome which is amazing that that they"
"survive all that but the cells do uh"
"they get larger the cells get larger and"
"larger and when you when you have these"
"um let's say a 4N nudes the cells get"
"quite big and there's fewer of them that"
"still make exactly the same type of"
"tubules same radius the animals the same"
"size even though the cells are all"
"bigger so that that's kind of amazing"
"the scaling of uh of so of so so the"
"cells are are fine having extra copies"
"of the of the genome they adjust to"
"having the wrong size and then when you"
"make I believe this was eight n nudes"
"the cells get so gigantic that there's"
"not room for even more than one and what"
"happens then is one cell wraps around"
"itself like this giving you the exact"
"same kind of lumen now why do I think"
"this is so amazing because this is a"
"completely different molecular mechanism"
"this is cell to cell communication and"
"tubulogenesis this is cytoskeletal"
"bending so this is a nice example of"
"top-down control in the service of a"
"large-scale anatomical structure"
"different molecular mechanisms get"
"called up to implement under novel"
"circumstances that that very much"
"reminds us of of certain um uh uh"
"certain cognitive systems where you have"
"some sort of executive control that"
"tells the it tells the animal where they"
"would like to go and that trickles down"
"to all of the low-level mechanisms"
"including uh depolarizing a bunch of"
"muscle cells and everything else that"
"that is required to implement that that"
"high level goal so"
"um already we're seeing and and all of"
"this is is discussed in in kind of"
"painful detail in in these papers if you"
"want to see all the"
"um all the details so what we're seeing"
"again is this is this idea this is what"
"James's idea of being able to navigate"
"that space in this case the anatomical"
"amorphous space in novel ways to make up"
"for various blocks that we throw up in"
"their in their path here's a final kind"
"of example to to motivate the the next"
"part which is which is this uh these"
"tadpoles uh are supposed to become frogs"
"to become a frog they have to rearrange"
"their face so the Jaws have to move the"
"nostrils have to move the eyes"
"everything has to move the traditional"
"uh kind of view of this was that this"
"was a hardwired set of movements that"
"every every organ uh just goes in the"
"right direction the right amount and"
"then you get from a normal tackle to a"
"normal front so we decided to to test"
"that is is it is it really that"
"hardwired or is there more intelligence"
"here so what we did was we produced what"
"we call these Picasso tadpoles we just"
"scrambled everything the eyes are on the"
"side of the head the Jaws are up here"
"Everything is Everything is scrambled"
"and what we found is that those animals"
"make largely normal frogs because what"
"they basically do is all the components"
"move around in novel paths sometimes"
"they even go too far and have to double"
"back but they move in novel paths to to"
"end up where they need to go so what the"
"genetics gives us is not a hardwired set"
"of uh tissue rearrangements what it"
"actually specifies is a system that can"
"do some kind of error minimization it"
"can it can deal with unexpected starting"
"positions and move whatever way it needs"
"to to still end up in the right place"
"very very differently so the way we've"
"been thinking about this is this"
"standard story that uh that we're told"
"in developmental biology"
"um which looks mostly like a uh like a"
"feed forward open loop kind of system"
"where genes interact with each other"
"they make some proteins uh the proteins"
"act under the laws of physics in"
"parallel process of emergence and"
"complexity and boom outcomes something"
"complicated and of course that does"
"though that does happen we know that"
"simple rules can give rise to complex"
"things but it's far more than just feed"
"forward emergence because if you try to"
"deviate this process and that might be"
"injuries it might be mutation it might"
"be physiological change whatever"
"these systems will activate both at the"
"level of physics and at the level of"
"genetics all kinds of feedback loops to"
"try to get back to where they need to be"
"to to navigate that space to get to the"
"correct pattern"
um
"now on the one hand this is not on the"
"one hand this this is not surprising the"
"biologists of course are very"
"comfortable with feedback loops and um"
"homeostatic circuits and all that but uh"
"there are there are a couple of"
"interesting things here that are"
"different first of all unlike in a"
"homeostat for let's say a temperature or"
"blood pH or the metabolic state or"
"something like that the set point of"
"this thermostat of this um homeostasis"
"is not one number it's a it's an"
"anatomical descriptor so it's a rich"
"data structure it's not it's not it's"
"not a scalar that's first second"
"um this uh this this this process has a"
"real flavor of gold directedness which a"
"lot of people especially in molecular"
"biology don't like but this isn't Magic"
"goal directedness this isn't a second"
"order I know what my goal is it's not"
"that it's a very simple kind of"
"cybernetic control theory sense of of"
"goals the system will expend energy to"
"minimize error and the third thing is"
"that it makes a very strong prediction"
"the prediction is this if this weird way"
"of thinking about things is true if it"
"really stores uh some kind of a set"
point
"then what we can do is uh make changes"
"by learning to read and write that set"
"point we don't have to make changes down"
"here the the current Paradigm let's say"
"crispr and and genomic editing says that"
"well that all the changes have to be"
"made roughly down here and that requires"
"you to be able to invert this process"
"that process is generally not invertible"
"if I tell you that um uh I want uh I"
"want a three-fold symmetry instead of"
"bilateral symmetry of this of this"
"Axolotl what genes would you want to"
"would you need to edit I mean there's no"
"way to reverse this in in general it's a"
"really terrible inverse problem but but"
"if this was but but if if there is in"
"fact a set point then what we can think"
"is that well maybe if we maybe we can"
"rewrite that set point and let the cells"
"do what they do best which is cooperate"
"together to build to the set point and"
"so this is what we've been looking for"
"for some number of years and I'm going"
"to show you exactly how this works so"
"we've been we with the so so then the"
"question was okay well what's a"
"um what's a precedent for this how come"
"you know we're we're saying that living"
"tissue is going to store a geometric"
"descriptor as a set point when does that"
"ever happen well of course it happens in"
"the brain because we can store patterns"
"uh geometric patterns as goals in in"
"brains so let's say mazes and things"
"like that and so"
"um here's I don't have to tell this"
"audience what's what's going on here we"
"we have the hardware which are these ion"
channels
"um and uh they can propagate electrical"
"State across the network through Gap"
"Junctions to their neighbors and then"
"that underlies all of the software that"
"uh that we see that drives behavior and"
"then there's this process of neural"
"decoding where the commitment of"
"Neuroscience is that all of the"
"cognitive content is here in this"
"physiology that if we understood the"
"electrical signaling and so this is a"
"zebrafish video that um uh this this"
"group made uh in live fish that if we"
"understood what was how to decode this"
"we would have uh access to the action"
"actual thoughts preferences memories"
"behavioral repertoire of these animals"
"so the amazing thing and so and so this"
"is an incredible and incredible"
"architecture of course that underlies"
"all of this all of the non-genetic"
"learning and and so on"
"um but what's cool is that Evolution"
"actually discovered this long before"
"brains showed up on the scene so right"
"around the time of bacterial biofilms uh"
"Evolution figured out that electrical"
"networks are amazing at storing"
"information processing information"
"integrating information across space and"
"time and all cells in your body have"
"iron channels most of them have Gap"
"Junctions and we can do a very parallel"
"kind of uh research program on neural"
"decoding on non-neural embryonic tissues"
"to ask can we decode what information is"
"being processed by this network to allow"
"the thing to navigate more for space to"
"get from a single egg to whatever it's"
"going to be frog human whatever and so"
"so so it's really very isomorphic where"
"uh what the electrical Network in the"
"brain does is control muscles to move"
"you through three-dimensional space that"
"same system much more ancient system is"
"controlling all of the cells to move the"
"configuration of the body through"
"morphos space it's a very similar um"
"kind of a way to use this network except"
"the output is different and the time"
"scale is different right because because"
"we're not talking milliseconds we're"
talking
"um hours and in some cases day so the"
"time scale is different and and some"
"things are swapped spatial for temporal"
"patterns but basically it's the same set"
"of tricks and so"
"um uh you know neurons and and modern"
"synapses uh basically speed optimized a"
"lot of stuff that was going on long"
"before that and you can you can read all"
"that here so we developed some tools to"
"be able to manipulate uh to so to read"
"uh decode and write these pattern"
"memories so so first was the use of"
"voltage sensitive fluorescent dyes these"
"are uh slow Die slow response die so"
"we're not looking for a millisecond"
"spiking we're looking at long-term"
"stable resting potential States and so"
"this is a time lapse movie of an early"
"frog embryo made by Danny Adams where"
"you can start to see all the electrical"
"conversations that cells have with each"
other
"then we do a lot of computational"
"modeling to understand how the various"
"channels and pumps in these cells"
"actually give rise to all of this I'm"
"going to show you two two patterns this"
"is again a video again made by Danny of"
"um an early frog embryo putting its face"
"together and again this is a voltage die"
"so so the color represents voltage"
"States and this is one frame taken from"
"that video what you see is that before"
"the genes come on and before the anatomy"
"is formed all of the regionalizations of"
"the face the eye the mouth the placards"
"already this this is what tells all"
"these cells what they're going to do and"
"what the face is going to look like as"
"I'm going to show you in a minute this"
"pattern is instructive if you move any"
"of the states the not the cells but the"
"electric states of this pattern the gene"
"expression follows the anatomy follows"
that
"so this is a native pattern that is"
"required for normal craniofacial"
"development this is a pathological"
"pattern if we inject an oncogene uh even"
"before the tumor becomes histologically"
"apparent you will see that um the cells"
"acquire an aberrant voltage credential"
"they start to uh uh detach from the uh"
"from the electrical um Network and they"
"basically treat the rest of the body as"
"just external environment at that point"
"we'll talk about that momentarily so so"
"that's how we that's how we track these"
"things now more important than that are"
"the functional tools so uh how do we how"
"do we rewrite these patterns and"
"basically the key thing is there are no"
"there are no Fields no waves no magnets"
"no electromagnetic radiation no"
"electrodes none of that what we do is we"
"play on the native electrical interface"
"that cells exposed to each other to"
"manipulate their behavior basically we"
"steal everything from the field of"
"Neuroscience so so all of the tools the"
"conceptual tools but also the Practical"
"tools opt the genetics a"
"neurotransmitter drugs ION channel"
"mutants Gap junctional pharmacology all"
"of that stuff works perfectly well"
"outside of the brain those tools they"
"cannot they don't distinguish between"
"between brains and body tissues and so"
"we use all the same all the same tools"
"we manipulate Gap Junctions we open and"
"close ion Channels with light with drugs"
"uh all the same familiar tools and so so"
"now what happens what what what why is"
"this important how do we know that these"
"electrical patterns are actually are"
"actually functional so here's one simple"
"example here's a frog embryo and what"
"we've done is we've taken up some"
"potassium Channel RNA and we've injected"
"it into a group of cells that are"
"eventually going to become gut so these"
"are endoderm faded cells so so we inject"
"we inject some some potassium channels"
"and what you see and what that does is"
"it sets up a little a little uh spot of"
"bioelectric pattern exactly like that"
"eye spot that I showed you in that"
"electric face moving and so what happens"
"is there result of that is that it"
"triggers eye formation anywhere else and"
"by the way outside of the standard"
"anterior and erectoderm which was"
"thought to be the only region competent"
"to make eyes in invertebrates actually"
"you can make eyes anywhere make them on"
"the tail you can make them out of gut um"
"prospective gut tissue"
"so and and if you section those eyes"
"they can have all the same retina lens"
"optic nerve they got all the same"
structures
"so a couple of interesting things here"
"one is the amount of information we put"
"in is actually quite simple we don't"
"specify everything needed to make an eye"
"there's a lot of there's a lot of"
"complexity inside the eye we don't we"
"don't know how to make an eye we don't"
"provide that information it's extremely"
"modular what we've provided is basically"
"a subroutine call that says make an eye"
"here this the the the signal that"
"triggers this is a particular spatially"
"distributed pattern of resting"
"potentials same as for the face same as"
"for other things I'm going to show you"
"that's the first interesting thing the"
"second interesting thing is that here"
"this is this is a lens induced out in"
"the tail of a tadpole somewhere the blue"
"cells labeled with beta galactosidase"
"are the ones that we injected with our"
"Channel all of this stuff here that"
"participates in making this nice round"
"lens was never injected with anything so"
"what happens is this is this is very"
"similar to the kind of recruitment that"
"you see in in ant colonies and other"
"Collective systems where these cells"
"there's not enough of them to make a"
"proper lens so we instruct them to make"
"an eye they instruct their neighbors and"
"basically recruit a bunch of normal"
"neighbors to participate in this in this"
"process of of imorphogenesis"
"and so this is one of those competencies"
"that these cells have not only do they"
"understand a very simple signal to"
"trigger towards a complex uh complex"
"path through morphe space towards eye"
"eye development they can also recruit as"
"needed to along the way to get the job"
"done right"
"um we can make using the same process we"
"can make ectopic brains we can make"
"ectopic legs we can make ectopic hearts"
"and otisists which are inner ear sort of"
"balance organs"
"um we can also we can also make fins now"
"that's kind of weird because tadpoles"
"aren't supposed to have fins it's more"
"of a zebrafishy sort of thing and I'll"
"talk more about that momentarily of"
"course this this idea of being able to"
um
"trigger large-scale morphogenesis with a"
"simple triggers is very appealing for"
"regenerative medicine we're doing this"
"for limb regeneration now so as I said"
"before in frogs normally you amputate 45"
"days later at this stage there's there's"
"nothing what we can do is trigger a"
"particular bioelectrical stage which"
"kick-starts the whole Cascade so"
"immediately you get this msx1"
regenerative
"positive blastema things start to grow"
"right away uh in the latest paper from"
"from last year we show that a one-day"
"exposure to this ionophore cocktail"
"drives 18 months of leg growth so"
"basically for a year and a half this on"
"an adult on a full full-on adult frog"
"the leg grows we don't touch it during"
"that time the only thing we do is"
"interact with that wound right at the"
"beginning for 24 hours to push it"
"towards that path in in morphe space"
"instead of scarring leg regeneration so"
"I have to do a disclosure here because"
"Dave Kaplan and I are I'm co-founders of"
"this company called morphew articles and"
"we're trying to push that technology"
"delivered with a wearable bioreactor to"
"mammals so so mice and rats at this"
"point and then eventually hopefully"
"someday patients so I want to switch"
"gears now and uh really get into this"
"this idea of of this this bioelectric"
"pattern as a um as a set point for"
"morphogenesis I want to go back to this"
"animal these these planaria um the"
"planaria of course are amazing because"
"uh they're Immortal they are incredibly"
"regenerative you can cut them into into"
"many many pieces and uh and I want to"
"show you one particular uh one"
"particular story which was um driven by"
"a a Fallon Durant in my group and uh"
"this is so so here's your here's your"
"normal one-headed worm uh you can see"
"that the anterior genes are are in the"
"head where they belong and if you"
"amputate that middle fragment very"
"reliably gives you a one-headed worm now"
"here's a one-headed worm again anterior"
"genes in the front not in the back where"
"are they supposed to be uh but this guy"
"gives rise when I when I when we cut"
"them gives rise to a two-headed run now"
"this isn't Photoshop these are real um"
"two-headed animals now why might that be"
"I just told you it's very reliable well"
"that's because at one point uh Wendy"
"Bean in my group discovered a a"
"bioelectric uh circuit that actually"
"sets up a pattern that tells the this"
"fragment how many heads a correct"
"planarian is supposed to have and what"
"we can do so so here's this here's this"
"pattern one head uh one tail what we can"
"do and this is still quite messy the the"
"technology still being worked out but"
"what we can do is we can re-specify this"
"with a with a temporary exposure to an"
"ion Channel drug we can re-specified and"
"now we can say no two heads okay here's"
"the most important part of this whole"
"business this bioelectric pattern is not"
"a readout of this animal this by"
"Electric readout is a scan of this"
"one-headed anatomically and"
"transcriptionally normal animal this"
"means that a normal body of a planarian"
"can store one of two possible and I'm"
"sure there's more but we've nailed down"
"two two possible representations of what"
"a correct planarian looks like so"
"remember the the whole premise of this"
"part of the of this part of the talk"
"if if if the collective intelligence of"
"of uh of these cells are going to uh try"
"to navigate morphospace towards a"
"specific set point we need to be able to"
"find the encoding of that set point we"
"need to be able to interpret it and we"
"need to be able to rewrite it so this is"
"it this this uh you're you're looking at"
"it when when we ask the question what"
"determines how many heads a planarian is"
"supposed to have this is the pattern now"
"that's the first thing so so we're"
"looking now at the encoding of the set"
"point the second thing is that's"
"interesting is that this is this is a"
"primitive counter factual memory this is"
"not the the the uh map of what's going"
"on right now this is a map of what might"
"happen in the future if the animal gets"
"injured and until it gets injured it"
"doesn't do anything it's a latent memory"
"just sits there until you cut the animal"
"then this pattern becomes relevant then"
"the cells obey and make a two-headed"
"worm so so this is perhaps I I throw out"
"this hypothesis that this could be a"
"very uh simple precursor of the amazing"
"using capability of brains to do this"
"kind of mental time travel when you when"
"you can remember things that are not"
"happening now and imagine future things"
"that are also not happening right now"
"the ability to store this this different"
"representation uh is a very basal"
"version of that and why do I keep"
"calling this thing a memory well because"
"uh around 2010 Nestor aviedo who's on"
"this on this call"
"um did a uh some some amazing uh studies"
"to ask what happens to these two-headed"
"worms in under under uh future rounds of"
"regeneration so we take this we take"
"this two-headed animal we remove the"
"primary head we remove this ectopic"
"secondary head uh we take the middle"
"fragment the No No genetic change has"
"been made we didn't edit the genome we"
"didn't put any transgenes standard"
"genetics you would think that it would"
"just then go back to normal and make a"
"one head that's not what happens these"
"middle fragments continue to regenerate"
"as two-headed in perpetuity um here they"
"are there's a video of taken by junji"
"murakuma about what these um what these"
"guys are doing"
"um and and uh as of uh you know as a as"
"of a few a few years uh after that we"
"figured out how to set them back to"
"one-headed so we can take the two-headed"
"form and reprogram them so this has all"
"the prop this this electrical circuit"
"has all the properties of memory it's"
"long term stable it's rewritable it has"
"conditional recall and it has a discrete"
"possible behaviors"
"um notice then that the question of how"
"how many heads do planaria have is not"
"really nailed down by the genome what"
"the genome does is specify an electrical"
"circuit that left to its own devices"
"reliably says generates a pattern that"
"says one head but it's rewritable it's"
"uh the actual information is stored at"
"the software level rewritable by just 48"
"to 72 hours of exposure to uh to a"
"stimulus in physiological space so well"
"part of the lab now is is focused on on"
"this basically pulling together what we"
"know about the state space of the"
"electrical circuit with uh current ideas"
"in um a connection is thought about how"
"electrical networks can store"
"information recover recover from errors"
"and and things like that so so this is"
"this is kind of the the computational"
"work that we're doing now it's"
"interesting it goes beyond near head"
"number it goes also towards head shape"
"so this animal uh with a triangular head"
"can be can be treated in the in the way"
"that just for a couple of days screws up"
"on the ability of the cells to regain"
"the correct electrical pattern and then"
"you can get flatheads like a pflena you"
"can get round heads like an S"
"Mediterranean in fact not just the head"
"shape but the uh the shape of the brain"
"inside and the distribution of stem"
"cells becomes exactly like these other"
creatures
"um again no genetic change but but you"
"can access other species morphologies"
"that are 100 to 150 million years"
"evolutionary distance so what the"
"electric circuit can do is select"
"between attractors in its state space"
"that correspond to other species and you"
"can start to think that that's a very"
"quick way way of making that change and"
"then evolutionarily it could perhaps"
"through um embaldment effects and"
"assimilation it could it could"
"eventually maybe that's how these"
"species came to be in the first place we"
"don't know but you can also access"
"regions of that state space that look"
"nothing like modern polaria so so you"
"can make these crazy spiky forms you can"
"make things that aren't flat at all and"
"you can make combinations so what we"
"really would like to do is to have a"
"full stack kind of um understanding"
"starting with the molecular genetics of"
"all the channels and pumps that are"
"expressed followed by using this amazing"
"simulator that um Alexis pytec has made"
"uh large-scale Electrical uh gradients"
"that exist in the field so so the"
"electric face and these patterns and so"
"on and then from there to the logic and"
"actually the the symbolic logic that"
"underlies how these types of patterns"
"make decisions about how many heads"
"where the heads are going to be and so"
"on and then then we can apply effective"
"interventions I'll show you a very quick"
"um way to uh to make use of some"
"something like this"
"we started to look at so Therapeutics"
"birth defects we started to look at um"
"one way that that brains get malformed"
"and so there's all kinds of teratogens"
"nicotine alcohol all kinds of drugs and"
"and mutations that will screw up the"
"early brain so what we did was we made a"
"computational model of the electrical"
"pattern that tells the early brain what"
"size and what shape to be okay and then"
"we asked what happens to this pattern"
"when it's hit by different drugs and and"
"I'm running out of time so I'm not going"
"to go into details until most people ask"
"afterwards but basically what you can"
"see this this is this is the the what I"
"think is the most uh kind of"
"um impressive example so here's a normal"
"brain forebrain midbrain hindbrain"
"here's one with a notch mutation so so"
"this has a dominant uh overactive Notch"
"so you can see the forebrain is"
"basically missing the midbrain and"
"hindbrain are a bubble these animals"
"severely defective they have no Behavior"
"um and uh uh they're just they're just"
"extremely impaired so so what we did was"
"we asked the model the computational"
"model a simple question what channels"
"could we open or close to get from the"
"incorrect bioelectrical pattern which is"
"which is one of the things that this"
"Notch mutation does is it actually"
"screws up the electrical pattern what"
"could we open or close to get back to a"
"collect correct pattern the model gave"
"us one idea which was the hcn2 channel"
"and what we found is that if you then"
"either open that Channel with drugs or"
"simply inject a new hdn2 channels"
"despite the fact that you ever uh you"
"have this Notch mutation you get back to"
"normal so the shape of the brain uh the"
"gene expression in the brain and the IQ"
"of these animals becomes"
"indistinguishable from controls so this"
"is very interesting while I'm not"
"claiming that this is always going to"
"work this way there are many things that"
"are not going to be fixable this way"
"this is an example of fixing a hardware"
"defect an actual mutation and an"
"important neurogenesis Gene in software"
"by providing temporary uh uh electrical"
"states to the brain that reset the"
"morphogenetic um uh traversal of this of"
"the system and so this is of course"
"these things are also now being being"
"tested for various kinds of birth"
"defects and so down the line we want"
"um we want this system which is going to"
"uh let people design these"
"electrosuticals so so at some point and"
"then you can you can play with uh with a"
"kind of an early version of this at some"
"point you will take whatever the"
"incorrect pattern is and it might be a"
"birth defect it might be a wound injury"
"it might be a tumor and uh you can you"
"can use the system to ask first of all"
"what kinds of um channels are even in"
"there that's just uh transcriptomic and"
"proteomic data but then we can use the"
"simulator to ask"
"what kinds of ion flows would would get"
"you back to normal and then choose now"
"that if you've picked your tissue you"
"know what the channel and pumps are so"
"you know what your candidates are and"
"then you choose from from known drugs"
"that Target all of this stuff and and"
"there's a massive toolkit of ION channel"
"drugs already out there which ones of"
"them would get you what you need so it's"
"a it's a design platform for"
"generalizing the the the Frog brain"
"story I just Soldier so in the last five"
minutes
"um I'm running way behind so I'm going"
"to do is I'm gonna I'm gonna skip all"
"this until unless people want to talk"
"about this at the end and then I'll come"
"back to it and I just want to um uh the"
"the the the slides in case we want to"
"come back are all about actually coming"
"back to this idea of scaling this this"
"navigational intelligence from single"
"cells and some hypotheses about how that"
"happens but um what I want to make sure"
"we get to is is this this idea of of"
"Novel uh novel organisms so one of the"
"things that we were interested in is to"
"understand uh how much plasticity are"
"are in it exists in in cells that"
"normally have a very reliable kind of"
"behavior in developmental biology uh and"
"if we did make novel creatures what"
"would their morphology be like what"
"would their behaviors be like and where"
"would these come from and we got an"
"amazing opportunity to do that"
"um uh using uh using a substrate of frog"
"skin cells and this was all done uh in"
"collaboration with Josh bongard's lab"
"and uh Doug Blackiston in my group is a"
"staff scientist who did all the biology"
"and uh Sam kriegman and Josh's lab did"
"all the computer science for this so"
"what we did was was was this we took a"
"early frog embryo um here it is in"
"cross-section these cells up here are"
"going they're animal cap cells they're"
"going to make ectoderms so skin and um"
"what what doug did was basically uh"
"dissociate so here they are we"
"dissociate all these cells and we put"
"them in a little in a little depression"
"all by themselves so we're not adding"
"there are no trans genes here there's no"
"um any kind of nanomaterials but just"
"basically taking them away from the"
"influence of the other cells and and so"
"so what could happen well many things"
"could happen they could the cells could"
"die they could crawl away from each"
"other they could do nothing they could"
"form a two-dimensional a monolayer like"
"cell culture instead what they do is"
"they they come together overnight they"
"sort of coalesce and they make this"
"interesting uh little thing which we"
"call a xenobot because xenopus lavis is"
"the name of the frog so one of the"
"things it does is it repurposes the"
"little hairs that it has on its skin so"
"frog skin has little hairs that rotate"
"to to move the um uh the mucus down the"
"the body of the Frog and so these are"
"now repurposed to actually swim to row"
"against the uh the water and you can see"
"that in the particles here"
"um they can go in circles they can sort"
"of Patrol back and forth like this uh"
"you can make all kinds of weird shapes"
"so here Doug made kind of a donut that"
"that moves up moves along"
"and it and and they also have all kinds"
"of collective behaviors so you can see"
"some Behavior tracking here here these"
"two are interacting with each other this"
"one's going on some sort of long journey"
"these guys are are doing nothing"
"um here's here's one uh navigating a"
"maze so so it goes It goes up here it's"
"going to take this corner without"
"bumping into the opposite wall so it"
"takes the corner and then here"
"spontaneously it turns around and goes"
"back where it came from so so some sort"
"of internal Dynamics"
"are causing it to change direction at uh"
"at some point okay uh they have"
"regenerative capacity so if we cut them"
"in half they will so so here we cut them"
"in half there's this kind of hinge here"
"and they will go ahead and reseal"
"themselves into their new xenobot shape"
"um if you if you look at the calcium"
"signaling here um they have very"
"interesting uh Dynamics which we can"
"apply all the tricks from Neuroscience"
"right so so"
"um Mutual information transfer entropy"
"all these kinds of things to find out is"
"is it brain like to what extent are they"
"communicating with each other we don't"
"know I make no claims about that at the"
"moment we're just starting that"
"um but keep in mind there's no neurons"
"here so all of this all this calcium"
"signaling here is done by the skin cells"
"and all the behaviors we've seen are are"
"done purely by skin and so now in the"
"last couple of slides I just want to I"
"want to show you um one one more amazing"
"thing that they can do so uh if you so"
"so so by taking this this this skin um"
"biobot away from the rest of the cells"
"we've made it impossible for these guys"
"to reproduce in the normal frog-like"
fashion
"um but if you provide them with a loose"
"skin cells so so these white things are"
"just more xenopacles what you find is"
"that they move around both individually"
"and in collectives and they make little"
"piles and what they do is over time they"
"make these little piles and they push"
"the skin cells into little little little"
"balls and they sort of compact them and"
"because much like us and much like"
"Evolution they are dealing with an"
"agential material meaning that these are"
"not passive particles these cells when"
"they come together they they know how to"
"do morphogenesis because of that what"
"happens is you get this reproductive"
"cycle which we call kinematic"
"replication uh these little balls that"
"they make mature overnight it becomes"
"the next generation of xenobots and"
"guess what they do they run around and"
"collect more and they make the Next"
"Generation and that makes the Next"
"Generation so this is basically Von"
"Neumann's dream of a robot that goes"
"around finds materials and makes copies"
"of itself now this is extremely"
"primitive there is no strong heredity"
here
"um we have to provide them with these"
"loose cells so they don't have the"
"ability to to sort of uh you know"
"generate them on their own so so it's a"
"very primitive example but it's"
"kinematic replication and they this"
"happens within 48 Hours of of liberating"
"this else so our knowledge no other"
"animal on earth does that so so this"
"raises some interesting questions what"
"does the xenopus labus genome actually"
"encode well most of the time it's this"
"it's a series of uh standard"
"developmental stages and then some"
"tadpole behaviors but actually also this"
"this is an early xenobot this is a month"
"olds antibodies has some kind of"
"Developmental stage here I don't know"
"what the heck this is this is some kind"
"of novel novel thing and they have and"
"they have different behaviors so so this"
"is so this is interesting a couple of"
"things to think about"
"one is that we didn't engineer in this"
"in this case of course we will in the"
"future add add synthetic circuits and"
"whatnot but we didn't do any of that all"
"we did was Liberate the cells from the"
"influence of the other of the other"
"cells so if you think about what does"
"skin know how to do the fact that it has"
"this boring two-dimensional life on the"
"outside of the animal keeping out the"
"bacteria that's what it does when the"
"other cell's Behavior shape it into"
"doing that on its own left to its own"
"devices this is the lifestyle that it"
"has and we would and you would never"
"know that by watching standard"
"development so standard development"
"hides a lot of um these these weird"
"competencies from us because it's so"
"reliable that's the first thing the"
"second thing is"
"um for any animal if you ask typically"
"what uh why does it look the way it look"
"why does it have certain behaviors the"
"answer is well because for eon's"
"selection has shaped it to be this and"
"that there's never been any xenobots"
"there's never been evolutionary pressure"
"to be a good xenobot so the question of"
"where do these capacities come from is"
"is really is really interesting um and"
"we don't know by the way we're just now"
"beginning the the kind of cognitive"
"experiments do they can they learn what"
"kind of um conditioning can they do do"
"they have preferences what problems can"
"they solve we don't know we have some"
"hints but but I'm not making any claims"
"about that yet"
"um okay so uh also so so so I'm just"
"going to uh finish up here by by"
"pointing out this because uh biology is"
"so incredibly good at at organizing"
"something coherent in novel"
"circumstances any combination of some"
"sort of evolved material designed"
"material so nanomaterials smart chips"
"whatever and AI is some combination of"
"it is going to be a possible viable"
"agent so we're talking about cyborgs"
"High broads instrumentized organoids"
"um uh chimeras all of these things you"
"know so so all of the natural forms that"
"Darwin called endless forms most"
"beautiful these things that really"
"impress them with their wide variety all"
"of that is this tiny corner of possible"
"uh space of of beings and so this really"
"begins now to push us towards the need"
"for some new ethical platforms because I"
"think that in the next few years we are"
"going to be surrounded by creatures who"
"don't share a a an evolutionary lineage"
"with us because so they will be there"
"they will be their their structure will"
"be completely different uh from anything"
"that we can point to on the uh on the"
"tree of life and uh they're not going to"
"share an origin story because there will"
"be partly uh evolved partly designed"
"um so we need new ways to unders to to"
"interact with each other with with other"
"beings with potentially diverse types of"
"intelligence that do not rely on what"
"you look like and where you came from"
"right that origin story these you know"
"these these criteria that we've used for"
"for a really long time if you know you"
"sort of walk up and you knock on on this"
"new system and if you hear a metallic"
"clangy sound you say okay that you know"
"you come from a from a factor you're"
"probably pretty boring I can take you"
"apart it's all good and if and if it's"
"soft and furry then then you know then"
"then you treat it a different way those"
"kinds of things are not going to survive"
"the next couple of decades we need a"
"completely new framework for for"
"understanding this"
"um so I'll just uh end here by saying"
"that uh all of this there are some these"
"these are some of the more conceptual"
"papers if people are interested I'm"
"happy to send this uh this stuff out uh"
"I want to thank uh the postdocs who did"
"and the grad students who did um all of"
"the work um we have some amazing"
"collaborators that work with us some"
"amazing technical support"
"um the model systems really do all the"
"heavy lifting uh for all of this stuff"
"um I think our funders and uh that's it"
"I'll stop here and thank you for"
"listening and I'll take questions"
