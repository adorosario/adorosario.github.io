"i have two different species of planaria"
"one have a round head and one have a"
"flat head"
"they have some stem cells in each each"
"planarian when you cut off the head they"
"build ahead of the correct shape and"
"then they stop that's what planaria do"
"now i have a thought experiment i'm"
"going to take my round-headed planaria"
"i'm going to uh take out some stem cells"
"and i'm going to inject them in the body"
"into the body of the flat head planaria"
"i'm going to let them get comfortable"
"and move around and settle in and then"
"i'm going to cut the head off what head"
"shape are we going to get"
"hi everyone welcome to reason with"
"science i'm your host chittender"
"this episode is with michael levin he is"
"a professor in the biology department at"
"tufts university"
"his work on left right asymmetric body"
"structures is on nature's list of"
"hundred milestones of developmental"
"biology of the century here we talk"
about
"life as an information deterministic"
"view of life"
multicellularity
"two-headed platforms picasso frogs"
"bioelectricity and collective"
"intelligence of cells"
"enjoy the conversation share and"
"subscribe to support the podcast thank"
"you for listening"
"hi mike uh welcome to the podcast thanks"
"so much great to be here"
"yeah so let's start with the kind of"
"your uh basic description of the work um"
"because the the topics that we are going"
"into like after afterwards that they are"
"really broad and uh basically"
"they somehow connect uh with your work"
"which is um"
"on morphogenetics and bioelectricity so"
"um what is the best way to describe"
"what you do"
"well fundamentally everything in my"
"group and basically my whole career has"
"been around"
"trying to understand how different kinds"
"of minds are embodied in the physical"
"world and in particular we're interested"
"in uh this this idea of scaling up so"
"how is it that small"
"competent parts"
"come together to form some kind of a"
"larger scale emergent intelligence"
and
"the bioelectrics come into it because"
"if you"
[Music]
"if you think about how it is that"
"cellular collectives solve problems how"
"do cells make decisions this is a this"
"is a really good way to start on this"
"problem and it's important it's"
"something that's been realized actually"
"by some people for a long time so for"
"example alan turing was one of the"
"forefathers of artificial intelligence"
"he was interested in mind in the"
"physical world but he also had this"
"amazing uh paper on morphogenesis yeah"
"he had one of the early"
"papers on on computationally"
"mathematically modeling morphogenesis"
"and so you might wonder why why that why"
"why would somebody who's interested in"
"in computation and mind be interested in"
"morphogenesis and i think he saw clearly"
"that this is actually the same problem"
"and uh i would also say that you know"
"each one of us makes the journey from"
"from just being a piece of physics and"
"chemistry so an uh and oocyte an"
"unfertilized oocyte and eventually nine"
"months and some years later we become uh"
"kind of a sentient human with all kinds"
"of second order cognition and complex"
"mental life and so on and so so we all"
"traverse that that journey from from"
"physics to mind and uh understanding how"
"that happens during embryonic"
"development what is it that allows"
"individual cells to start off doing very"
"simple kinds of things and then"
"solving problems in in morphological"
"space and then then becoming you know a"
"kind of complex cognitive agent that"
"that's what my group is really"
"interested in"
"yeah it's it's fascinating and how"
"important these questions are for the"
"understanding of biology and especially"
"why i wanted to start with the brief"
"introduction of your work because"
"then the the next question that i have"
"is simply what is life where"
"the whole biology starts basically"
"so how do you look at it"
"uh to be honest uh i've i i don't think"
"about the question of what is life at"
"all um i'm not sure that uh i'm not sure"
"that that life is a particularly useful"
"category for us um people argue about it"
"and there are some people who do nice"
"work on this topic for us i'm not sure"
"it's very important i think what is what"
"is really important is to think about"
"what is cognition"
"and what is it to be an agent what is"
"agency uh what how to define this sort"
"of continuum of agency that has uh"
"physics on one end and simple physical"
"systems and then and then has complex"
"beings like us and and you know and"
"beyond on the other end uh i i'm not"
"sure uh the actual notion of life is of"
"any help here and i think that there are"
"many cognitive systems that are not what"
"we would call alive and"
"i don't think it i don't think it"
"matters really for us"
"so at least for the progress of science"
"you don't think that this question is as"
"important as for example asking the"
"question of cognition or intelligence i"
"think so because because the"
"fundamentally look what this this all"
"boils down to one thing why do we care"
"what the cognitive level of some some"
"system is right and and and i'm"
"interested in systems that are very"
"diverse so so the kinds of frameworks"
"that i deal with have to"
"deal with standard uh evolved animals"
"like we see on earth they have to deal"
"with all kinds of unusual living things"
"that are evolved"
"swarms and colonies and cells and"
"tissues and plants and all kinds of"
"unusual things uh potentially"
"exobiological agents so anything we find"
"off planet at some point probably we"
"will and of course synthetic kinds of"
"forms that we make here then those might"
"be out of living material those might be"
"out of uh traditional ai so so"
"software and some kind of a silicon you"
know
"medium underneath and of course chimeric"
"hybrid constructs so so biorobotics and"
"cyborgs and hybrids and all of those"
"things so so so frameworks have to be"
"able to deal with all of that and so"
"uh why are we doing all this we are"
"interested in these questions because we"
"need to know how to relate to these"
"things right at one end you were talking"
"about how do we relate to them from the"
"perspective of control so maybe"
"engineering maybe robotics maybe"
"regenerative medicine how do we control"
"the outcome of these collective"
"intelligences on the other end you're"
"dealing with things like uh social"
"social policies you know how do we when"
"when when we do have all kinds of novel"
"beings among us which we are going to"
"have that are partly uh standard human"
"partly different kinds of tissues partly"
embedded
"smart uh implants with ai and all these"
"kinds of things and potential alien uh"
"intelligences how do we relate to them"
"right and asking the question of whether"
"they are alive or not seems to me"
"irrelevant to that question but asking"
"what kind of cognition they have seems"
"very relevant so so to me it's all a"
"question of what is the correct way to"
"relate to other beings around you of"
"various degrees of sophistication"
"yeah that's that's fascinating because"
"um it it also i mean to start with first"
"of all this information we get it get"
"from our biology textbooks you know this"
"is how things start that okay that in"
"this uh hot springs in this hot soup"
"the life started and you know etc etc so"
"also kind of to to see now where we"
"stand on these kind of questions um the"
"the next point is uh i mean of course"
"there was a lot of information that you"
"already gave uh basically the gist of uh"
"different topics that we'll be covering"
"uh in the in the conversation"
"but let's start with the um as you said"
the
"the computation part"
"but before that life has an information"
"itself because"
"um let's say that okay i mean even if we"
"uh kind of"
"avoid or remove the question of uh life"
"part but still life exists i mean there"
"are systems that we consider as"
"living beings"
but
"i don't know even if we remove the"
"semantics part um the the point being"
"that there is a certain information"
"there is some blueprint that we all kind"
"of follow right"
so
"where do we stand with the with the life"
"as an information part"
"well uh let's let's look at the"
"semantics issue because it's kind of"
"important uh let's just decide there are"
"there are two types of terminology that"
"we can use there are terminal there's"
"terminology that are useful in everyday"
"life so for example uh the word adult is"
"like that so we all know what an adult"
"is it's very useful in court it's very"
"useful when you need to rent a car this"
"is very important but we also know that"
"scientifically absolutely nothing"
"happens on your 18th birthday that makes"
"you a different kind of creature that"
"now you can do other things right it's"
"total total you know fabrication so so"
"we need to be clear are we talking about"
"uh terminology that's that's kind of a"
"heuristic that's useful for life for for"
"society and everything to move along or"
"are we talking about deep scientific"
"concepts so now there are people who do"
"very good work in this area so so so"
"sarah walker lee krohn and those folks"
"really think very hard about what life"
"is it's it's great um"
"for the kinds of things that i'm"
"interested in i don't believe"
"that a binary category of life versus"
"not life is very useful at all and in"
"fact i don't believe almost any binary"
"categories are useful"
"because because what what you end up"
"with is is these um sort of"
"semi-philosophical questions about well"
"well how about how about these new"
"viruses with a little bit of their own"
"physiology are they alive i i find this"
"i find this"
"comp you know completely um"
"sterile for the kinds of purposes that"
"we have which is just as just as sterile"
"as questions of which sometimes people"
"talk about whether something is or is"
"not uh cognitive or or has agency i"
"think that's a terrible way to frame"
"these um these problems"
"the question isn't is it or isn't it the"
"question is what kind and how much so i"
i
"have this very continuous view of these"
"things i think that uh"
"what i really want to know when you show"
"me a new system and it may be a"
"surprising thing that you either made or"
"you discovered or it came off planet or"
"whatever it is you show me a new system"
"i i'm not looking for you to put it in"
"binary categories i want to know what i"
"can expect can i expect this thing to"
"only follow immediate energy gradients"
"like a rock or a bowling ball or can i"
"expect it to uh"
"act like a homeostat and keep to certain"
"parameters can i expect it to be"
"trainable like uh with rewards and"
"punishments can i expect it to give me"
"wisdom and so we can have a you know an"
"equal relationship with it or can i"
"expect it to you know be so much more"
"advanced to that that you know"
"uh whatever we can have a different"
"relationship with it so so to me all of"
"these claims are um relationship claims"
"or engineering claims it's all about"
"what does it enable me to do how does it"
"enable me to optimally relate to this"
"and i think asking whether something"
"alive or not"
"on an everyday basis of course that's"
"very useful on a scientific basis i'm"
"not sure it does very much for us"
yeah
"the only thing is probably it may just"
"explain the fact that there"
"that there is a transition and if there"
"are these kind of basic laws which can"
"which do explain transitioning from"
"chemistry to biology"
because
"most of your work uh i mean that's what"
"we we will discuss uh today as well the"
so
"because your observations once we start"
"expanding somehow they go to also kind"
of
"chemical level right um"
"yeah i mean this whole issue of"
"transitions uh"
"maybe there are transitions but"
um
"i think that i think that if if you want"
"to argue that there are sharp"
"transitions meaning some kind of phase"
"transition where something very"
"radically different happens"
um
"that may be but i think then one has to"
"argue for that well what is it you know"
"what is it what what exactly happens and"
"i i"
"i'm sure i'm sure there are phase"
"transitions but um i i'm not aware of"
"any that are that are uh kind of"
"defensibly sharp they tend to be in my"
"in my mind they tend to be very slow and"
"gradual and uh"
"you know they i mean there certainly are"
"new kinds of capacities that arise uh as"
"as one goes up uh certain levels but i i"
"i i've gotten more use out of focusing"
"on the continuous nature than to than"
"than focusing on uh kind of the"
"trying to put things in categories"
"actually that's definitely true i think"
"there is no or at least i'm not aware of"
"any biological system which is like this"
"phase transitioning i think all of them"
"they are gradient right"
"i mean of course then there is there can"
"be some selection or something that may"
"work which may remove parts of it but"
"mostly it's the gradient switches right"
"i think so a lot of people don't agree"
"with that you know a lot of people think"
"that there are very sharp boundaries so"
"so there are many people that think that"
"certain kinds of for for example certain"
"kinds of animals are uh are have have"
"agency and cognition and other and and"
"others do not and that's it and there's"
"a sharp line and i mean i've never heard"
"of a plausible sharp line from anybody"
"but but but there's certainly plenty of"
"people who believe that and even you"
"know sort of"
"on the lower end so so there's some"
"there's some that very nice work of on"
um
"minimal minimal uh agential system so so"
"so um"
"those are those little um"
"kind of very very simple chemical"
"systems that show interesting behaviors"
"i i don't think people would call them"
"alive but i spend zero time asking"
"whether they're alive i want to know"
"what does it do and how much where does"
"it fit on this on this uh kind of"
"continuum of agency you know droplets"
"and and the you know active matter and"
"those kinds of things um yeah i don't"
"know i'm not terribly interested in"
"whether they're alive but i do want to"
"know so what can they do do they do they"
"learn do they pursue goals what kind of"
"goals how large are their goals that"
"kind of thing"
"actually i i interviewed a chemist um"
"adi pros and he has written a book um"
"like this transitioning of chemistry to"
"biology and this is what his definition"
"was that living systems are"
self-sustaining
"continuum systems so"
"you know like you know in a way that"
"because what you are saying that once we"
"start expanding i think that's what"
"even in the at the chemical level we"
"will end up with the similar kind of"
understanding
yeah
"yeah i mean people's people certainly do"
"come up with definitions uh"
"around that and then somebody will say"
"yeah but uh you know fire does that too"
"and they say no no you need you need"
"heredity and so so there are some you"
"know there are some there's some"
categories
"i'm not sure i think a lot of a lot of"
"those distinct distinctions have to do"
"more with"
"the question of what what department"
"gets to study them as opposed to what"
"the real phenomenon is"
so
"a lot of these things that are studied"
"in chemistry in biology in computer"
"science in psychology"
"those those barriers between these"
"departments are getting weaker every day"
"um all the important interesting"
"problems are multi-disciplinary problems"
"that don't fit neatly into into any of"
"any of these categories"
"and what do you mean by the continuum"
"system in biology uh in in that case so"
"for example if we take viruses or"
"like those organisms how how would you"
"look at them"
"so so i i have i i've proposed and i'm"
"not the only person to propose such a"
"thing of course people have done this"
"before uh a continuum of cognition this"
"continuum is uh defined by"
"different types of um"
"different different capabilities with"
"respect to how you control it and i can"
"just i can describe what the continuum"
"is but the point is that it it's it's a"
"very um sort of functionalist cybernetic"
"kind of definition it's very engineering"
"based it does not"
"uh care at all what the system is made"
"of or or or its origin story so whether"
"you were designed whether you were"
"evolved whether you came from a factory"
"or you do you evolve naturally on some"
"planet somewhere or uh what you're made"
"of makes no difference for the purposes"
"of this kind of framework what matters"
"is what kind of cognition you have so so"
"along the continuum as i was saying"
"before you might have and and it's all"
"it's all really about if i'm an engineer"
"or some other observer and i want to"
"interact with the system what is the"
"most efficient way for me to do that so"
"it might be a system that's way on the"
"left of the continuum it might be like"
"like like a mechanical clock so it's a"
"piece of physics uh if you want to"
"change what it does you can rewire it"
"you can physically change the hardware"
"but that's it you cannot train it you"
"cannot change any set points you cannot"
"argue with it it makes no sense to be"
"angry at it it's just it's a piece of"
"physics that's it then"
"you know sort of somewhat to the right"
"of that and you know i'm sure there are"
"many categories i'll only mention a few"
"uh to the right of that you have"
"something like a thermostat so a thermal"
"a homeostat like like like the thing"
"that keeps temperature in your house"
"also a piece of physics also"
"could be rewired if you wanted to but it"
"has it but it avails you of something"
"much more interesting you can change the"
"set point and when you change the set"
"point that means you can walk away and"
"what can you do you can trust the system"
"to maintain the temperature even though"
"you're not there to micromanage it so"
"that ability to pursue goals that's a"
"tiny little you know in the cybernetic"
"sense is a tiny little goal it's a goal"
"of keeping the temperature a certain way"
and
"those kinds of homeostatic systems"
"avail you as the engineer of a new way"
"of relating to it you don't have to"
"rewire it when you want to change the"
"temperature you just change the set"
"point um"
"then sort of further to the right of"
"that are other systems that can do"
"interesting kinds of learning so so"
"maybe maybe they can do habituation"
"maybe they can do associative learning"
"rewards and punishments"
"humans so so the nice thing about those"
"kind of systems is that even more so"
"than with the thermostats you don't need"
"to know"
"almost anything about how the system is"
"made in order to control it you just"
"need to know what the rewards and"
"punishments are what are the currency"
"what does the system care about and so"
"humans have been doing this of course"
"for like 10 000 years they've been"
"training animals knowing zero"
"neuroscience you don't need to know any"
"neuroscience what you need to know is"
"how to how to motivate the system and"
"you need to know that it is in fact a"
"learning system you're not going to"
"train a clock but you might train uh"
"certain kinds of living systems and and"
"increasingly certain kinds of non-living"
"systems right there are plenty of"
"non-living systems that will learn that"
"way so"
"so and then and then to the right of"
"that you have you have far more"
"sophisticated systems that have"
"metacognition and you know second-order"
"models of themselves and their world and"
"some of them have language like humans"
"and there you can do something even more"
"interesting you don't need rewards and"
"punishments necessarily you don't need"
"to know how the system works you can"
"provide reasons for them to do things"
"and if you're clever and you are go and"
"you are um uh understanding uh how to"
"communicate with the system you can you"
"can provide reasons for them to do"
"things and then walk away and then they"
"will do all kinds of complicated things"
"and you don't have to micromanage any of"
"it so to me it's all of this is really"
"an engineering question about what level"
"of sophistication does this type of mind"
"offer when we really you know when we"
"relate to each other so that's that's"
"the continuum i have in mind and you can"
"place anything"
"on that continuum no matter what it's"
"made of whether it's alive or not"
"so basically let's say that if we uh"
"walk on earth and we just pick up random"
"objects it can be"
"a human it can be any other animal maybe"
"a microbe"
"or it can be a piece of rock"
"so we'll just look at like if this"
system
"is able to kind of so"
"this is what you mean by cognition right"
"that it it is able to perceive so"
"basically receive the signal and have"
memory
"and act on on that memory so these are"
"the three things uh you would look for"
"or i i look for uh to the the framework"
"that i've put out focuses on the on the"
"issue of being able to um being able to"
"pursue goals so a goal-directed system"
"now the next question is well with what"
"kind of"
"uh competency so you could pursue goals"
"in a maybe you're you're such a simple"
"system that all you can do is go"
"directly towards your goal that's all"
"you know how to do so for example"
"magnets in the magnetic field or"
"bowling balls in a gravitational field"
"they always go in a particular way"
"they're never going to do anything else"
"they're very easily"
um
"uh uh"
"prevented from reaching their goal by"
"local local maxima so you put a little"
"hill and and they bump into and that's"
"it they're not going to go around they"
"don't know how to do anything they're"
"they're they they have very little"
"competency in pursuing these goals then"
"you have then you have thermostats which"
"are which are much better at it but they"
"still uh have limitations because"
"there's only a few things they know how"
"to do they don't set their own goals"
"they they some some other system has to"
"set the goal for them then you have much"
"more complex systems that have a lot of"
"ingenuity so if you've ever seen you"
"know kids or advanced animals to solve"
"problems they will come up with all"
"sorts of different ways to navigate"
"their problem space that is not a direct"
"line in fact they may have a degree of"
"patience they may know that it it's"
"better to step further away from their"
"goal and then go around in some more"
"complicated way to actually get closer"
"to what they need so so the degree of"
"competency in navigating your space"
"whether low or high is the degree of"
"intelligence but the central thing that"
"ties all of these things together is the"
"ability to pursue goals so goal"
"directedness is what has all is what"
"keeps all these agents on the same"
"continuum now"
"one important thing you said is you know"
"you walk around and you pick stuff up"
"this is very important a lot of people"
"think that"
"where something belongs on this spectrum"
"is can be decided a priori so you're"
"sitting here in your philosophical"
"armchair and you look at a gene"
"regulatory network you know this is"
"genes turning each other on and off and"
"you say well i can see it's very simple"
"it's a piece of physics there's no magic"
"here it's going to be zero on the"
"cognitive scale i mean there's nothing"
here
"you can see but but but actually if"
"you're willing to uh accept that this is"
"an empirical question you can't just"
"have feelings about this stuff you have"
"to do experiments you might find that"
"well actually gene regulatory networks"
"have six different kinds of learning as"
"we found and so"
"the thing about all of this is that"
"this is meant to be the the reason so my"
"framework is called t-a-m-e is in tame"
"stands for technological approach to"
"mind everywhere and the reason it's"
"technological is that i don't believe"
"these are philosophical issues i believe"
"these are empirical engineering issues"
"and if you want to know how cognitive"
"something is you have to test it you"
"have to make a claim you have to test it"
"and if somebody else has a different"
"claim that tests better then they're"
"correct and and so on so so all of these"
"things are we have to test we can't make"
assumptions
"is interesting and um i mean i think"
"also people should understand that how"
"much uh"
"in in the science we have metaphors and"
"you know the fact that okay i mean we"
"are using living system non-living"
"system those are metaphors but now this"
"is like the the other framework that you"
"are explaining that this is kind of"
"another uh metaphor right everything i"
"mean that's true but but keep in mind i"
"mean everything is a metaphor people say"
"to me all the time oh well you know it's"
"just it's just metaphorically that that"
"this thing has you know preferences and"
"memories i say look"
"everything you know how about the notion"
"of a pathway right like a biochemical"
"pathway or any of the things any of the"
"pretty color diagrams in this"
"biochemistry book they're all they're"
"all metaphors everything in science is a"
"metaphor and the only question is how"
"good is your metaphor in allowing you to"
"make progress that that's it there's no"
"there's no you know sort of um objective"
uh
"truth and then some metaphors it's all"
"it's all metaphors all we can do is"
"compare them test them and compare them"
"yes but the understanding uh in science"
"it evolves with certain laws and rules"
"that that we kind of test again and"
"again and we we verify them we know that"
"okay this this is"
"um kind of this explains the the"
"the system"
"and so how would then we"
"will apply evolution and selection on"
"this continuum system"
"yeah well that's that's a very very"
"important set of questions uh i i can i"
"mean i have many many many things to say"
"about it but um"
"one of the"
"issues is that uh i guess i guess i'll"
"just tell you two two things"
"the the fact that"
uh
"living things are"
"nested so so"
"subcellular the chemical networks cells"
"tissues organs you know whatever"
"the the that's a multi-scale competency"
"architecture where each level has its"
"own ability to solve problems and pursue"
"goals in various spaces we're talking"
"the transcriptional space physiological"
space
"anatomical space and then of course"
"behaving traditional behavioral space"
"the fact that these things all solve"
"problems on their own and have some"
"degrees of competency has massive"
"implications for evolution"
"i'll give you one one simple implication"
"uh one of the um one of the uh"
"experiments that we did years ago was a"
"study of what happens when you make"
"tacos where the various craniofacial"
"organs are in the wrong locations okay"
"so we tested actually let's let's start"
"even a step back"
"tadpoles become frogs in order for"
"tadpoles to become frogs all their"
"craniofacial organs have to rearrange"
"right because tadpole faces don't look"
"like frog faces"
"so the traditional model of this was"
"that well the genetics just somehow"
"tells every piece of the face which"
"direction to move and how far and then"
"you get from a tadpole to a frog so"
"that's so so that was the assumption now"
we
"wanted to test that because i had a"
"feeling that actually it would be more"
"intelligent than that and so how do you"
"do that you ask the question okay how"
"much competency does it have to reach"
"its goal so what you do is you create"
"and we created these tadpoles we call"
"them picasso tables where all of the"
"organs are in the wrong place the eye is"
"off to the side the jaws are on top of"
"the head everything is in the wrong"
"place and what we found"
"was that actually yeah that process is"
"much more intelligent it actually all"
"those pieces will move around in novel"
"paths unnatural paths and still get to"
"where it's going so what what evolution"
"has done is hasn't given you a machine"
"that does exactly the same thing and"
"solves the problem exactly the same way"
"what it gave you is an error"
"minimization scheme it's a machine"
"that's able to minimize error and it's"
"able to get to the same goal"
"from different starting positions right"
"different positions in anatomical"
"amorphous space they all go to the same"
"basically the same frog face that was"
"william james's definition of"
"intelligence is the ability to get to"
"the same goal by different means so it"
"has some degree of competency in"
"navigating that space it has some"
"policies about how it gets there and"
"it's got some some degree of"
intelligence
now
"here's here's the implication for"
"evolution so that's interesting so"
"evolution makes a problem solving"
"machines like this well"
"here's the implication for evolution"
"imagine that uh you're a tadpole and now"
"you had a mutation and that mutation as"
"most mutations have multiple effects"
"that mutation had a couple of uh side"
"effects one is that your"
"your mouth and your eyes are now in the"
"wrong position"
"but it also has some other interesting"
"make some other interesting changes"
"elsewhere in the body now under the"
"standard scheme where"
"it's a it's a direct relationship"
"between the genome the genotype and the"
phenotype
"you would have a fitness of zero because"
"your eyes who are off target and they"
"you can't see anything your mouth is off"
"so you can't eat that's it do you have a"
"fitness of zero and all the other"
"consequences of that mutation are never"
"explored so this is the reason why the"
"vast majority of of mutations could be"
um
"could be"
"harmful you know harmful mutations that"
"makes sense as engineers we know if you"
"have a nice system and you make random"
"changes to it"
"almost all the time it's going to make"
"things worse it doesn't make things"
"better okay"
but
"we're not dealing with that situation"
"what we're dealing with is a very"
"interesting machine where the parts have"
"competencies so what that means is if"
"your eye is out of whack that's okay"
"it'll get back to it it can still see in"
"fact we've shown that animals with eyes"
"on their tail can still see because the"
"eyes will connect to the spinal cord"
"instead of the brain and those animals"
"can see if you can see can if the if the"
"animal has only the eye on its tail no"
"primary eyes they can still see"
"perfectly well we can train them on"
"visual cues so if the mouth is in the"
"wrong position no problem it'll get to"
"where it needs to go it can move and"
"rearrange the face and it will get to"
"where it needs to go"
"so that gives evolution uh a really an"
"incredible boost because it means that"
"now you can explore all the other"
"consequences of that mutation maybe it"
"does something really great somewhere"
"else in the body"
"and it turns all kinds of harmful"
"mutations into potentially neutral"
"mutations so it really puts evolution on"
"steroids the fact that you can depend on"
"your parts to get their job done even"
"when things change in fact there are"
"some amazing examples of this in biology"
"that we can talk about"
anyway
"so the first the first consequence is"
"that it makes evolution much much much"
"more efficient it makes the power of"
"evolvability goes through the roof but"
"the second something else that's that's"
"interesting can happen which is that if"
"your parts are competent enough to make"
"up for certain kinds of genetic"
deficiencies
then
"here's what happens imagine you have two"
"animals they both look pretty good they"
"have good you know good"
"adaptive behavior in the world so here"
"they come up for selection selection"
"needs to choose which ones are the best"
"ones they look exactly the same however"
"selection doesn't know whether they look"
"the same because they have a fantastic"
"genome or they look the same because the"
"genome was actually so so but all the"
"parts kind of made up for it and"
"everything is is there"
"as soon as that happens"
the
"power of evolution to"
"make improvements by selecting great"
"genomes goes down because you can't see"
"the genome anymore you are right you're"
"you're losing information your your"
"ability to judge and compare genomes"
"isn't that great anymore but what you"
"can do is you can put more effort into"
"improving the software into improving"
"the competency of the parts right and so"
"i think that what happens during"
"evolution is the competency of the parts"
"make a ratchet for improved intelligence"
"because now it's very hard to make"
"improvements by improving the hardware"
"but improving the software is really is"
"really a powerful technique and"
"there's a great example of this there's"
"a great biological example of this which"
"is um"
"they're there and there's no to my"
"knowledge there's no other model in"
"biology that explains why this would be"
"other than what i just told you there"
"are these flatworms called planaria and"
"these flatworms they uh they regenerate"
"and the way that you know if what they"
"the way they can reproduce is they tear"
"themselves in half and then each half"
"regenerates and now you've got two worms"
okay
"so the interesting thing about that is"
"that unlike us when we have a mutation"
"in our body our children don't inherit"
"that mutation right there's a separation"
"of the germline we you know we clean it"
"up during sexual reproduction"
"these planaria"
"because they because they reconstitute"
"half the body each time from both sides"
"they accumulate somatic mutations so any"
"mutation that doesn't kill the cell"
"makes it into the next generation and"
"gets amplified as the cell you know"
"proliferates right"
"so for 400 million years these animals"
"have accumulated these really uh all"
"kinds of mutations their genome is an"
"incredible mess they um"
"they're they're mix applied every cell"
"has a different number of chromosomes"
"even okay so the hardware description is"
"all over the place but they are champion"
"regenerators their anatomy is 100 rock"
"solid every single time they're cut"
"perfect shape now this should be a"
"scandal right we know nobody ever hears"
"about this in developmental biology"
"textbooks but we"
"all of our models predict exactly the"
"opposite why why would the animal with"
"the most messy genome have the best"
"anatomical control that doesn't make"
"sense because you you on the theory that"
"your genome is what determines your"
"anatomy but what makes perfect sense is"
"that this this ratchet went uh all the"
"way in this animal that improving the"
"genome became less and less important in"
"fact the pressure to clean up the genome"
"became less and less important because"
"the competency of making a perfect worm"
"even though you're made up of a bunch of"
"cells with different genetics and"
"whatnot uh that the algorithm got better"
"and better so i think those two things"
"sort of positive feedback loop on each"
"other um"
"and that's that's just an example so so"
"there are many other many other"
"consequences but but those are two"
"examples of evolution where the"
"competency of the parts really changes"
"the the space that you're searching"
"evolution maybe doesn't just search the"
"space of"
"all the kind of um ways to have the"
"hardware it's more behavior shaping it"
"it because you're not working evolution"
"like like bioengineers doesn't work with"
"a um"
"passive material you're working with"
"cells that used to be their own"
"organisms they have their own agendas so"
"what you're searching really is the"
"space of possible communications signals"
"inducements rewards punishments um"
"all kinds of signaling how are you going"
"to get your material to do new things"
"that's the but that's what we as"
"engineers face that's what evolution"
"faces it's very different task than"
"searching the space of all possible"
"configurations of your hardware"
"this is great so uh the major points um"
"which we should probably elaborate as"
"well so the first thing that"
"that you described is picasso frogs then"
"it's the"
"genetics that we we need to and i mean"
"you kind of already mentioned a little"
"bit plan area that's another thing and"
uh
"how basically uh once we mess up with"
"the with parts of it how"
"do they change and the the fifth thing"
"was regeneration so let's start with the"
"uh genetics itself so when we are"
"talking about genetics of all the"
"living forms that they have uh dna um"
"or the or a sort of a blueprint which is"
"a which is this kind of notion that the"
"then that all of us are kind of like"
"everything is embedded in the genome but"
"that's not the case this is what you are"
"describing with the example of picasso"
"frogs right well right let's let's"
"unpack that a little bit what does it"
"mean for things to be embedded in the"
"genome first of all uh"
"first of all we can read genomes now and"
"we know what's in the genome it's"
"protein sequences that's what's in the"
"genome so now that's a description of"
"the micro level hardware of the system"
"we know now and i think in this case the"
"hardware software analogy is actually"
"pretty pretty useful here because we"
"know that yeah you can have a"
"description of the hardware of the"
system
"but then the things that that system is"
"actually going to do"
"are not just what was in the description"
"of the hardware they're actually it"
"involves all kinds of um"
"information from outside for example the"
"laws of physics the laws of computation"
"and so on right so so let's let's"
"imagine i'll give you two simple"
"examples because this is important"
"people often talk about what's in the"
"genome where is shape encoded so let's"
"talk about this um"
"you may have heard of a galton board so"
"galton board right is you get this you"
"get this piece of wood it's up here like"
"this you bang a bunch of nails into it"
"vertically you take a bucket of marbles"
"and you dump the marbles into the top of"
"this thing they all sort of bang bang my"
"bang they all do this they come down and"
"they make a lovely bell curve every"
"single time to make a builder now you"
"never know where an individual marble is"
"going to end up but but overall they"
"make this very nice bell curve so you"
"might ask the question okay that's a"
"that's a really cool morphology that"
"shape where's that shape encoded"
"you could study the wood you could study"
"the nails you could study the"
"distribution of the nails it's not there"
"where is it well it's uh it's in the"
"laws of physics and the laws of"
"mathematics and calculus and uh that's"
"what gives you the bell curve now um"
"here's another example uh i could give"
"you a specification of some transistors"
"and some resistors and a few things like"
"that and you will make an and gate when"
"you make an and gate you the and gate"
"has a nice truth table that tells you"
"how this thing works and if you in fact"
"if you make a nand gate you can make all"
"sorts of really complicated you know"
"computations right"
"so now you say well where's that truth"
table
"you didn't give me the truth table what"
"you gave me was a set of descriptions of"
"of of transistors"
so
"where does it come from well it comes"
"from the same place of the truth of the"
"truths of mathematics and number theory"
"and so on come from i have no idea where"
"they come from the point is that we know"
"perfectly well that for most devices"
"the uh"
"most important thing that they do is not"
"in fact in the description of how you"
"built them dna is exactly the same way"
"so dna when you look at a genome you"
"don't see anything about the size the"
shape
"the symmetry type of an organism whether"
"it's regenerative how many eyes it's"
"going to have you don't see any of that"
"in the genome but you see in the genome"
"is a description of the micro level"
"hardware that every cell gets to have"
"the proteins now what evolution has done"
"is to shape that hardware so that it"
"gets to use certain gifts from physics"
"and computation and so on these"
"affordances are like um"
"generic laws that you don't have to"
"evolve specifically so for example if"
"you had a triangle you don't have to"
"evolve three angles you can only evolve"
"two and you know what the third one has"
"to be now why why is that well it's a"
"free gift from geometry i don't know"
"where it lives it lives wherever"
"mathematica lives so so the point is"
"that in that sense the the genome does"
"not directly encode the shape it doesn't"
"call a blueprint of any kind it encodes"
"hardware that does something amazing"
"what that hardware does is it builds a"
"machine that solves problems one of the"
"problems that it solves is how to"
"self-assemble from a particular starting"
state
"but most of them actually solve other"
"problems too other problems which are"
"for example well how do you repair"
"yourself if you're damaged how do you"
"build yourself from a different starting"
"state what happens if your cells are"
"much larger than they need to be for"
"example in um in in the newt you can"
"make the early cells gigantic and you"
"still get a perfectly normal sized nude"
because
"fewer cells do what they need to do and"
"in fact some cells do"
"will like wrap around themselves to make"
"a particular kidney tubule and so on"
"whereas normally takes eight to ten"
"cells to do it"
"they'll choose different molecular"
"mechanisms to get to the same goal so"
"the hardware is amazing it does all"
"kinds of things but like like as we know"
"like with with uh with computational and"
"other kinds of machines"
"it's not in the description of the"
"machine it's the machine using the laws"
"of physics and"
"and and cybernetics and and and"
"computation and so on"
"yeah the question would be that the"
"so first of all what what would be the"
"software then and um"
"if the software can change the hardware"
"yeah uh well uh"
"the software is the physi the software"
"is the physiology the software is the"
"computations being done by bioelectrics"
"biochemistry biomechanical forces all of"
"the all of the physiology that happens"
"is the software that ends up doing"
"things like well if you start off in the"
"wrong position it will fix you if you"
"had us if you're a salamander and you"
"lost your arm it will keep growing the"
"new arm until it stops that's the"
"software that's that's"
"not now can the software change to"
"change the hardware uh"
"in some sense yes because"
"you cannot you not only well you most"
"certainly change the large-scale"
"hardware because that's what the"
"software does it builds the organism it"
"remodels the organism it's what makes a"
"uh a caterpillar become a butterfly"
"something radical changes of the"
hardware
um
"it uh"
"not only that but uh it"
"it it also"
"potentially can change um"
"the soft the hardware at the at the"
"lower level so certain cells will die"
"and other cells will come different"
"genes will be expressed the cells will"
"move around uh you know maybe maybe at"
"some point there are changes even of the"
"of the genetic material itself i'm not"
"sure whether cases have been made for"
"bacteria for transgenerational"
"inheritance and other animals maybe"
"so um"
"yeah but but that's it but that's that's"
"the idea the the software is the"
"physiology it's the it's the layer"
"between the genome and the anatomical"
"structure and function that provides the"
"intelligence of the system it's the"
"that layer in between"
"and that would also explain that these"
"that these systems are not deterministic"
"in a way right that they there there is"
"plasticity there"
"well yes so so so from the from the"
"biological at the biological scale"
"absolutely absolutely there's incredible"
"amounts of plasticity and we can talk"
"about some some amazing examples of uh"
"living things being interoperable and"
"forming uh you know they can make"
"coherent uh organisms as chimeras"
"between different dna and different"
"cells and different organs with"
"inorganic materials people grow things"
"on crazy material scaffolds and"
"everything i mean amazing plasticity um"
"at the you know if you want to be sort"
"of uh uh really really um uh pedantic"
"about it at the at the micro level"
"they are deterministic in the sense that"
"they're really everything follows the"
"laws of physics and chemistry it's not"
"magic there are laws of physics and"
"chemistry and so you could argue i mean"
"there's the whole quantum question but"
"but you could argue that that at the"
"micro scale they're absolutely"
"deterministic but that doesn't mean that"
"at the scale where it's really important"
"which is the the larger scale of of"
"anatomy and physiology yeah they're not"
"they're not deterministic they're very"
"uh there's this massive"
plasticity
"yeah so um now okay let's let's see"
"again so now if you start from a single"
"uh bacterial cell which is like the"
simplest
"living forms again um with with certain"
"blueprint with certain information um as"
"you said or hardware right"
"where i think the the hardware would be"
"or can we say that the hardware would be"
"more dominant in a way and then once we"
"go into more complex forms where"
"of course the the number of cells"
"increases you know there is of course"
"the issue of multicellularity"
"and once that case comes it's more of"
"the software"
"driven phenomena"
um
"maybe that's a that's a hypothesis"
that
"the the"
"problem with being able to be certain"
"about that"
"is that"
"uh all claims like that are relative to"
"an observer so you and i look at a"
"system and we say oh well this isn't"
"doing anything too sophisticated i think"
"it's mostly pretty hardwired right the"
"problem is that uh when we do that we"
"are taking an iq test ourselves so so we"
"are saying how smart am i in being able"
"to notice what this thing is actually"
"doing because you have to do three"
"things you have to pick a problem space"
"you have to make a guess as to what the"
"goals of that system are and you have to"
"make a guess as to what the competencies"
"are that's a lot of guessing and then"
"you have to do experiments now"
"think about this that"
"as we grow up all of our"
"sense organs basically point outwards"
"and so we are very good at recognizing"
"intelligence and plasticity in"
"medium-sized objects moving at medium"
"speeds you know in our lifetime that"
"kind of thing and so so when we see"
"animals and dog you know birds and dogs"
"and humans doing interesting things were"
"very it's very easy for us to detect"
"agency and to know that they're"
"different from bowling balls and so on"
"imagine imagine if we had um"
"the way that we have vision imagine that"
"we had the same kind of built-in"
"direct perception of your blood"
"chemistry and all the things that your"
"liver and your and your pancreas are"
"doing to uh keep it you know maintain"
"the the chemistry i think in that case"
"we would be quite good at detecting"
"intelligence in physiological space not"
"in three-dimensional space but in the"
"space of physiological states because"
"you could see everything you could feel"
"everything that was going on and then"
"you would see what your organs are doing"
"and you say wow that's really clever"
"look at look at what it did it"
"anticipated that every every day at noon"
"i have this like heavy lunch and it"
"anticipates and it does interesting"
"things so"
"all of this we have to be we have to be"
"humble about these things to to know"
"that we may not know what it's doing so"
"for example bacteria we may think"
"they're hardwired but i would bet and"
"i'm not a bacteriologist i'm sure you"
know
"other people could tell you better but"
"i would i would guess that in the metabo"
"in metabolic space these bacteria are"
"incredibly plastic and i think that we"
"would find out that there's a huge"
"amount of software going on at the"
"metabolic sort of chemical space that"
"the bacteria are dealing with they don't"
"you know they don't do terribly much in"
"other spaces but i bet in that space i"
"bet they're very smart and so but but"
"these are all these are all conjectures"
"right so so so people do experiments and"
"lots of people study this stuff and uh"
"and and you we could get real data on"
"this and then we would know for sure um"
"until somebody else came along with a"
"better you know better model of course"
"yeah so the other thing that you were"
"describing um"
"is the the picasso frog so what exactly"
"uh you do there so do you change the"
"genetic material of"
"there's there's a few ways to do there's"
"a few ways to do it you could do it"
"surgically you could do it uh"
"bioelectrically you could do it uh"
genetically
"um we we've shown we've shown example"
"and and so and so what you do is you you"
"uh make a tadpole that has the wrong"
"configuration of the face and then you"
"find out that the system actually knows"
"perfectly well what a correct frog face"
"looks like how do you know that it knows"
"because it's able to reach that despite"
"the deformations so that's what that's"
"what makes this engineering as opposed"
"to philosophy when i say it knows i'm"
"not using some sort of crazy metaphor"
"where we can argue philosophically"
"whether it knows"
"it's very testable we know that it knows"
"because it will always get back to that"
"same spot even though even though you"
"put it in different different places and"
"in fact we can even now we can even"
"begin to read that memory you say how"
"does it know what a correct face it"
"looks like we've actually developed"
"techniques where we can see that memory"
"we now know how they know"
"so uh"
"you know the thing the thing uh the"
"thing about it is that"
"if you didn't uh if you didn't do the"
"experiment you would never you would"
"never have found you would never found"
"this so we so like this is like i said"
"we don't know the sophistication of"
"these systems until we until we try it"
"um we have an example where"
"we can use software to fix certain kinds"
"of hardware problems not all of them if"
"you're missing some sort of enzyme that"
"you need for metabolism bioelectrics is"
"not going to help with that but we have"
"an example where we"
"looked at"
the
"frog the temple brain"
"and there are a bunch of um ways to"
"disrupt it so there are chemicals that"
"will disrupt it there are genetic"
"mutations for example in gene called"
"notch which is really important"
"neurogenesis gene"
so
"uh what we showed is that"
"if with that that the way that the brain"
"knows how big to be and what shape to be"
"is a particular bioelectrical memory in"
"the cells before there's any brain you"
"know in the cells that are going to be"
"brain later that tell them what the"
"brain should be like"
"and what you can do is even though"
"they're impacted by nicotine alcohol or"
"mutations genetic mutations or changes"
"of the hardware"
"even after that you can you can treat"
"them with pretty with a particular set"
"of drugs that opens and closes"
"electrical uh ion channels that restores"
"the correct bioelectrical pattern so we"
"use the computational model to say this"
"is what the correct pattern is"
"how do we manipulate the voltage to get"
"back to the correct pattern so this"
"wasn't a screen that wasn't a guess it"
"was a there's a model that tells you how"
"to do it so we did that and sure enough"
"you get a normal brain with normal"
"structure normal gene expression and"
"their iq goes back to normal so they"
"actually regain their learning rates so"
"that tells you that at least for some"
"cases you can repair"
"uh you can repair uh"
"genetic hardware defects in software but"
"that's going to be on a case-by-case"
"basis when that's possible"
yeah
"let's try to put it again in the same uh"
"framework that we were discussing so the"
"genomes they uh code for rna proteins"
"and these proteins are the basically"
"building blocks doing different things"
"of course there are also rnas um um"
"and then the um"
"so these things are again packed in the"
"cells which can of course communicate"
"with each other"
"and so so basically what you are doing"
"is that you i mean we can and all of us"
"all the uh"
"multicellular organisms that they are"
uh
"they are built because of the"
"communication between these cells right"
"and these communications can be changed"
"genetically so we change the hardware"
"but we can also change these proteins or"
"there can be some ions and these ions"
"are for example for neurons we know that"
"the these neurons fire and that's what"
"we call"
"action potential and these kind of"
"technical terms but"
"this is how"
"this has been known for years that okay"
"the this is what happens in the in the"
brain
"but now uh this is another mechanism"
that
"that you guys are describing which is"
"called bioelectricity"
"where uh the similar uh pattern is"
"basically noticed in all the cells all"
"the somatic or any any cell in the body"
"yeah so so so let's just let's just be"
"clear well let's start with the brain"
"though the kind of uh familiar scenario"
um
"it's it's not that ions are somehow"
"magic for cognition okay there's nothing"
"particularly special about ions except"
that
"electrical networks happen to be really"
"good at processing information at making"
"feedback loops at storing memories and"
"that's because they take advantage of"
"certain laws of physics and mathematics"
"so the brain uses that modality as the"
"cognitive glue right we are a collective"
"intelligence you and i are bags of"
"neurons and uh something enables those"
"neurons to cooperate to have an emergent"
"set of goals and behaviors and memories"
"and and preferences that don't belong to"
"any individual cell they belong to this"
"weird emergent entity known as a human"
"so so so it happens in in the case of uh"
"on on earth that that evolution chose"
"electrical networks to be able to do"
"this now"
"the thing is that this system evolution"
"discovered this long before there were"
"any brains so so so this is a trick that"
"evolution picked up around the time of"
"bacterial biofilms so so there there's"
"some beautiful work out of for example"
"ucsd where they um"
"they show bioelectrical uh kinds of"
"dynamics in uh in bacterial biofilms in"
"in bacterial mats so this is a very"
"ancient thing all cells do this uh"
"what what evolution seems to have done"
"is it took a set of mechanisms that were"
"used to solve problems in amorphous"
"space so in anatomical space so problems"
"like which cell goes where where how"
"many eyes where does the head go where"
"does the tail go these kind of problems"
"it took that exact same set of"
"mechanisms and just pivoted them onto a"
"different space the three-dimensional"
"space so now instead of moving the"
"configuration of the body through"
"anatomical space now it moves your whole"
"body through three-dimensional space by"
"activating muscles instead of activating"
"other cells and gene expressions and so"
"on there's that same trick it's an"
"ancient trick every every cell group in"
"your body does it and it's not because"
"and again it's not because"
"bioelectricity is somehow magically"
"you know cognitive it's simply that"
"that's a great way to make use of a lot"
"of um computational laws"
"which it's the same reason we made"
"computers this way it's i mean it's"
"exactly it's exactly the same"
"yeah but then what will be the"
"difference between bioelectricity and"
"any other kind of signaling"
um
"in theoretical terms you can do"
anything
"anything that you can do with"
"bioelectricity potentially could be done"
"with other forces so probably somewhere"
"there's some planet where instead of"
"bioelectricity something else is used"
"for the same purpose"
"but but but here on earth the immediate"
"benefits of bioelectricity are uh are"
"many it's you know electrical networks"
"are i mean it's not an accident the"
"brains use them computer technology uses"
"them um"
"it's just uh it's it's it's a it's very"
"convenient i give you a simple a simple"
example
uh
"there are ion channels"
"that produce voltage but these ion"
"channels themselves are voltage-gated so"
"what you really have is a voltage-gated"
"ion conductance it's an it's a it's a"
"it's a ion it's an electrical gate whose"
"open or closed state depends on the"
"voltage which means what happened before"
"so that automatically gives you a bit of"
"historicity right so it's got this like"
"dependence on past conditions which"
"automatically makes it be two things it"
"makes it a synapse meaning a"
"communication channel that has plastic"
"enough to depend on what happened last"
time
"and it's so that's a bit of memory and"
"it uh it enables you to make transistors"
"because that's the transistors are"
"voltage-gated current conductances so as"
"soon as you have that we know what you"
"can do when you have transistors you can"
"compute anything and so that's why"
"bioelectricity is so interesting now"
"could you do this with other things of"
"course you can and uh but you know this"
"is one reason why"
"every once in a while in nature there'll"
"be a nice paper on them you know some"
"sort of um"
"diffusion powered logic gate or"
"something like this that's why it's in"
"nature's because it's so damn hard it's"
"really hard to do that kind of thing"
"with diffusion with chemical you know"
"chemical signals biomechanical signals"
"not that it can't be done but it's just"
"really hard"
"and but this voltage-gated um ion"
"channels they"
"they basically deal with the simple salt"
"that we eat or like sodium potassium the"
"these ions right yeah i mean every the"
"cellular cellular resting potential the"
"the electrical properties of each cell"
"is set by the balance of sodium"
"potassium chloride protons and some"
"other things and so"
"uh yeah but again not not magic just"
"just a cool piece of physics that allows"
"you to that allows evolution to harness"
"certain laws of computation"
"and uh so the the picasso frogs now back"
"to this point so in in those frogs do"
"you change the bioelectrical signals"
"then or what exactly we"
"we do yeah so so for many many purposes"
"so for example"
"one thing that you can do is you can say"
"um uh how does the face know where to"
"put an eye and so you look at the it was"
"so so we've developed a technique using"
um
"voltage sensitive fluorescent dyes that"
"show you where all the voltages is are"
"distributed and when you look at the"
"early uh region of the skin that's going"
"to become the face"
"you can actually see some patterns in"
"that voltage that tell the cell here's"
"where the eye is going to go here's"
"where the mouth is going to go and so on"
"what you can do is you can reproduce"
"those patterns somewhere else in the"
"embryo and you can do that by opening"
"and closing ion channels are with drugs"
"and with other things somewhere else"
"when you do that"
"you you reproduce that bioelectric state"
"somewhere else those cells will if you"
"do that for the eye pattern they will"
"make an eye and we've made frogs that"
"have eyes made out of gut tissue on the"
"eyes on their tail anywhere you want we"
"can make eyes legs brains um a few other"
things
so
"what it ends up being is a kind of sub"
"routine call because we don't have to"
"micromanage again taking advantage of"
"the intelligence of the system"
"we don't have to micromanage it we don't"
"have to tell it how to make an eye or"
"where all the different cell types go"
"that make an eye it's very complex we"
"don't know how to do it what we do know"
"is a high level signal that tells the"
"system make an eye right here right it's"
"basically a very simple subroutine call"
"and then the cells already know how to"
"do it then they do it and then they stop"
"so again this is a system that isn't all"
"the way on the left of that continuum"
"where i would have to guide every i'd"
"have to 3d print every you know people"
"want to do this they want to"
"sort of micromanage the positioning of"
"all the stem cells and all the"
"connections and the different genes go"
"up and down they want to control all of"
that
"that's okay but that's incredibly hard"
"for a complex system it's much easier to"
"realize that your system is actually"
"quite a bit further down on that on that"
"continuum and it understands goal states"
"and it understands modularity and you"
"can give it signals that say"
"build an eye here and then you walk away"
"so we've done that kind of a thing we've"
"done another thing where"
"frogs unlike salamanders do not"
"regenerate their legs so we show that"
"you can make them regenerate their legs"
"by putting a particular stimulus"
"on the amputation wound for uh for one"
"day so 24 hours"
"then they for the next year and a half"
"they grow the leg we don't touch it"
"during that moment because we're not"
"micromanaging the process we're not"
"trying to control it we are trying to"
"communicate with the decision-making"
"process during that first 24 hours that"
"says we're gonna scar or are we gonna"
"regenerate and what are we going to"
"regenerate all that decision making"
"machinery acts at the beginning once"
"you've communicated with it you can take"
"your hands off and let it do what it"
"needs to do that's what's important"
"about all these things is that it tells"
"the engineer how to effectively"
"control the system"
"yeah the regeneration part is uh very"
"interesting but before that um let's"
"also cover a few points here so"
"so the first point would be the"
"expression of the voltage gate"
"channels the how much that changes with"
"the different parts uh the second thing"
"is that when we are talking about"
bioelectricity
"what is um what is changing in the"
"different parts of the um embryo or"
"organism in general um"
"is it the"
"is it the concentration of the ions"
"which i think it it would be fairly the"
"same but"
"no the ions yeah absolutely voltage is"
"set by the balance of between inside and"
"outside of the cell of the various ions"
"so the ions go in and out of the various"
"cells the total is more or less the same"
"if you just grind up the tissue and ask"
"how much total potassium yeah it's about"
"the same but the real question is where"
"is it is it inside the cell outside the"
"cell that's the really key and that's"
"the same thing for"
"for neurons and action potentials"
"because the question is where are these"
"ions in or out so"
"all of that changes during development"
"in very very uh specific ways and that"
"results in a set of bioelectrical"
"distributions it doesn't matter what any"
"one cell voltage is it's not one cell"
"this is not a cellular code this is a a"
"tissue or organ level code so you look"
"down and you see these different"
"biological distributions"
uh
"different stages uh are"
"are pulled by the fact that"
"that distribution changes and"
"that distribution is is used to store"
"the the memory against which the"
"homeostatic agent measures so for"
"example any so the key to all of this is"
"that any homeostatic agent has to have a"
"memory of the set point right if you're"
"going to be a thermostat you need to"
"remember somewhere what the correct"
"temperature range is same thing here if"
"you're going to rebuild a face if you're"
"going to"
"remodel a face rebuild a leg"
"all of these things you need to remember"
"what the correct pattern is how does it"
"remember well it turns out that the way"
"it remembers is to store a bioelectrical"
"pattern which is a rough description of"
"what it's looking for"
"and the error the delta between the"
"current pattern and the correct pattern"
"is what drives change it drives"
"remodeling it's a kind of stress that"
that
"there's a stress reduction loop that"
"tries to drive that tries to reduce that"
"that error and so that bioelectrical"
"pattern keeps changing and as it changes"
"it pulls the uh the the gene expression"
"and the anatomy with it because they"
"will keep changing to try to implement"
"what the bioelectric pattern is doing"
"try to reduce that delta so you go from"
"stage to stage to stage and then"
"eventually you flatten out as a mature"
"you know as a mature organism"
"but does this mean that this bioelectric"
"pattern would be different in for"
"example liver if it would be different"
"for kidneys or it will be different for"
eyes
"yeah uh this is yes it's different for"
"different structures and different"
organs
"the full story of"
"what all the patterns are for all the"
"different shapes we don't we don't know"
"all of them that's very much ongoing"
"research that's we call that cracking"
"the bioelectric code we need to"
"understand the mapping we need to"
"understand why specific patterns make"
"specific shapes"
"and so that's that's very much still"
"under investigation we know it for some"
"systems we know it for for a few things"
"but but we don't know it for everything"
"so so for example liver i have no idea"
"what a correct bioelectrical pattern is"
"for the liver but we know what it is for"
"the face we know what it is for the limb"
"we know what it is for the brain um we"
have
"some some information and what is the"
"meaning of this bioelectric pattern like"
"what what exactly you're looking at it's"
"the ions or"
"also the type of channels neither"
"neither uh it's not any of that uh"
"that's that's all hardware we are we are"
"looking at software state so what we're"
"looking at is voltage so we are"
"specifically looking at the distribution"
"of voltages across a sheet of cells"
"right and the cool thing about it is"
that
"the the voltage is a function of many"
"different ions and what we have shown"
"repeatedly in all of these papers is"
"that you can get the same"
effect
"using sodium potassium chloride it"
"doesn't matter what the ion is as long"
"as you get the voltage correct so you"
"have to you have to you can use any of"
"them but you have to"
"pull them in or out using uh the"
"optogenetics so light gated channels or"
"drugs to open and close the channels or"
"put in new channels whatever the point"
"is you just have to get the voltage"
"pattern right so the system does not"
"track the microstates of which uh which"
"which which ion did it it tracks the"
"resulting voltage the same way that"
uh
"and this is something computer science"
"figured out a really long time ago that"
"when you are when you are programming at"
"a higher level you don't need to know"
"where the voltages are in your in your"
"computer right when you when you on your"
"computer when you change from photoshop"
"to microsoft word you don't get out your"
"soldering iron and start rewiring and"
"you don't have to keep track of which"
"exactly which uh"
"piece of copper has your so has your has"
"your current"
"you don't need to know any of that"
"because the system exposes a higher"
"level interface you can program it with"
"experiences with stimuli and you know"
"something about how the thing works"
"that's what we're looking for we're"
"looking for"
"the ability to read and write these by"
"these voltage states and that way we can"
"start we can we can basically avoid"
"having to worry about all the"
"microstates you know right now right now"
"in biology when you've seen those"
"pictures of what programming looked like"
"in the 40s and 50s right you sit there"
"in front of this giant thing and you"
"pull you know you pull wires back and"
"forth right how much fun was that"
"programming that way and that's where we"
"are in biology and medicine today we are"
"all about the hardware"
"uh crispr you know genomic editing stem"
"cell biology pathways remodeling gene"
"regulatory networks okay great but all"
"at the level of the hardware we have to"
"move beyond that because some problems"
"are not easily solved that way okay and"
"and we can see compute you know computer"
"science already took that journey for us"
"so so we can see how that works"
"yes but then of course in the future"
"we'll we'll be going at like more"
"specific level to kind of uh find out"
"those switches which uh turns on and off"
"uh certain"
"uh switches right like"
"thinking about it from the perspective"
"of switches is okay"
"but it kind of misses the point it's"
"sort of like"
"if if uh if if if i gave you a computer"
"that plays chess"
"and you and you didn't you wanted to"
"study it well you didn't know what it"
"was but you wanted to study it you could"
"get a really great accounting of all the"
"materials where all the copper is where"
"all the silicon is you could study all"
"the switches you could measure all the"
"magnetic fields generated by the"
"electricity you could get a great"
"you you might even if you had you know"
"sort of a lifetime of many universes you"
"might even get to the point where you"
"could predict what the next electrical"
"step is going to be"
"you would be none the wiser about the"
"game of chess you would not know"
"anything about the algorithm you"
"wouldn't know what it is what it means"
"to protect the king and dominate the"
"center of the board or any of this other"
"stuff uh"
"it's just not available at that at that"
"lower level in any in any obvious way"
"so i think for regenerative medicine"
"it's the same we can we can study all"
"these micro switches or we can ask how"
"does the system make decisions what is"
"it measuring what is it remembering why"
"does it decide this or that and what are"
"the signals that are going to uh make it"
"uh you know sort of push it into the uh"
"actions that we like in morphospace"
"building certain organs and whatever so"
"that that's what i'm excited about i"
"mean i mean you know working out the"
"switches is is fine but i i want to"
"communicate with the system at a higher"
level
"yeah and it's definitely exciting and"
"since you already mentioned about"
"regeneration let's talk about two-headed"
"uh planaria"
"yeah well the thing about the two-headed"
"play area it goes back to our question"
"about what information is in the genome"
"and how does it know what to build now"
"let's let's start off"
"let's just uh start off by reminding"
"ourselves of some knowledge gaps here"
"imag let's do a thought experiment i"
"have two different species of planaria"
"one have a round head and one have a"
"flat head"
"they have some stem cells in each each"
"planarian when you cut off the head they"
"build ahead of the correct shape and"
"then they stop that's what planaria do"
"now i have a thought experiment i'm"
"going to take my round-headed planaria"
"i'm going to uh take out some stem cells"
"and i'm going to inject them in the body"
"into the body of the flathead planaria"
"i'm going to let them get comfortable"
"and move around and settle in and then"
"i'm going to cut the head off what head"
"shape are we going to get"
"is one head shape going to be dominant"
"to the other is are they going to get an"
"in-between kind of intermediate shape or"
"is the shape never going to stop because"
"neither set of cells is ever happy about"
"what kind of shape we've made right"
"nobody nobody you know nobody can agree"
"on what the shape should be now we have"
"some beautiful uh papers in nature and"
"science and so on on studying stem cells"
"in planaria plenty of information we"
"have the genomes why can't we answer"
"this question why do we have zero models"
"that make a prediction on this on this"
"thing because we do not understand we"
"understand how the hardware works we do"
"not understand the software we do not"
"understand how collectives of cells make"
"decisions about shape"
"and until we understand that we can't"
"answer questions like that"
"so uh we wanted to ask a simple question"
"years ago um"
"here are these planaria you cut their"
"head off they make a perfect head always"
"the right the number of heads at the"
"right position how do they know how do"
"these cells know how many heads there"
"should be and where these heads should"
"be placed and so we looked we i made a"
"hypothesis that uh in in retrospect it"
"doesn't say i mean at the time everybody"
"said it was nuts but look but but"
"thinking about it in retrospect it"
"shouldn't be that surprising how does"
"the brain store memories electrically"
"okay so we use the voltage uh guy to"
"look at the planaria and we noticed"
"something interesting that there was a a"
"bioelectrical pattern that looked like"
"it was storing the information to have"
"one head that's what it looked like and"
"so then we said okay very simple what"
"happens if we um"
"if we artificially change that"
"bioelectrical state to be a pattern that"
"looks like it has two heads"
"we don't change the dna the hardware is"
"wild type we don't change the we don't"
"edit the genome we don't do anything"
"like that we don't put in new channels"
"even nothing we just use a drug to"
"control the bioelectric so that it now"
"says two heads and now you cut it guess"
"what it makes uh the fragments make two"
"headed worms"
"so so that's interesting so you learn"
"from that that"
"the instructive"
"information about uh where the heads"
"should go lives in this bioelectrical"
"circuit now we learned something else"
"when we took the two-headed animals and"
"we re-cut them again into pieces no more"
"manipulation of any kind no more drugs"
"nothing just recut those two-headed"
"animals guess what they keep making"
"two-headed animals so that tells you"
"that the circuit has a memory once"
"you've reset it from one headed to two"
"now now it stays it's permanent and we"
"know how to set it back to one headed"
so
"that that's that's pretty interesting"
"that suggests that uh"
"the information on how many heads a"
"planarian should have is strictly"
"speaking not in the genome here's what"
"the genome does the genome creates a"
"piece of hardware that by default has a"
"a software state that says one head but"
"that hardware is actually very clever it"
"doesn't it it can not only do that but"
"if you change it it will also keep a"
"different a new pattern"
"so um"
"that we know we're familiar with this if"
"i give you uh"
"the description of the the parts list to"
"a calculator"
"you you you put them together according"
"to the description by the way my"
"description says nothing about numbers"
"it says nothing about mathematics it's"
"just the description of a bunch of"
"electronic parts so you put these parts"
"together you turn on the juice what do"
"you see on the lcd you see zero you see"
"a particular pattern zero every single"
"time every time you turn it on you see"
"zero wow that amazing it's it's reliable"
"it's um you know much like embryonic"
"development it's uh it's robust zero but"
"then you find out something interesting"
"without having to rewire it i can give"
"it input stimuli i can press the buttons"
"and instead of zero it'll say something"
"else and in fact it has a memory and"
"it'll say something else it'll keep it"
"even though i haven't touched i haven't"
"changed the hardware at all so so"
"there's no more mystery in these"
"planaria really is"
"than there is in this uh"
"in this in this example the genome gives"
"you the circuit and the circuit is"
"amazing in that it does two things it"
"has a default reliable behavior but it's"
"also reprogrammable right and that's"
"what you've got you've got biological"
"tissue is reprogrammable it has a"
"default behavior but you can you can"
"communicate with it at a higher level"
"and say yeah i don't say where the stem"
"cells go i don't say how many eyes"
"you're supposed to have i don't"
"none of that i say two heads it's a very"
"high level communication and then the"
"cells build"
"so how do you change the bioelectric"
"signals and um in the um in the these"
"two headed plane areas um did"
"bioelectric signal change"
"yeah yeah so the way right so the way"
"you induce the the change is the way you"
"make the bile the two edible areas by by"
"changing the pattern and the way you"
"change the pattern is you you use the"
"computer model to tell you which ion"
"channels can be opened or closed to give"
"you the right voltage results it's not"
"obvious because it's quite a complex"
"circuit so you can use a computer model"
"and the computer model will tell you"
"that if i open this chloride channel for"
"a while and then turn off this potassium"
"channel then you'll get this particular"
"voltage so that's that's that's the"
"future of of this field is uh"
"development of these kind of machine"
"learning tools that will be able to"
"infer interventions and help you"
"communicate with the system"
"and we already know most of the these"
"voltage gate"
"channels that the uh and this is what"
"then we can model right or"
"yeah yeah and in fact uh"
"you know you know what all the channels"
"are because you can have a uh you know a"
"transcriptional profile of the tissue so"
"you know what all the channels are those"
"are your control knobs now the next"
"question is right so you know what all"
"the buttons are on your device now the"
"next question is which ones do you hit"
"and that's the more interesting question"
"that's what you need the the the"
"community the"
"machine learning part is to is so how do"
"you communicate with that device"
"yeah and you've been using this system"
"already to create"
"the famous"
"xenobots and also xenobots"
"uh well the the the zenobots uh have not"
"yet uh been uh are not yet bioelectric i"
"mean of course we're going to we're"
"doing that now but but the three papers"
"that exist are not bioelectric in any"
"way so what the what the three existing"
um
"uh papers on on xenobots are doing is"
uh
"showing the plasticity of the the tissue"
"it shows you that so so for example"
"regular development is so"
"reliable that it kind of mis it's"
"misleading in many ways because it makes"
"you think that this is what the cells"
"want to do this is the only way they can"
"do it um so for example if you ask"
"so so two ways in which it's misleading"
"one is that you have a tadpole and it's"
"covered by skin and it's his skin is"
"this like like two-dimensional passive"
"layer on the outside of the embryo"
"keeping out the bacteria and you say"
"okay i can i can say two things i can"
"say that evolution if i ask why does the"
"tattoo look a certain way why does it"
"have certain behaviors certain"
"distribution of"
"features because for millions of years"
"evolution selected for a very specific"
"thing right and everybody else died off"
"so now this is what you have"
"and if i ask what do the cells want to"
"do well they want to be this like"
"passive two-dimensional layer on the"
"outside of the embryo"
"so again uh you do experiments and the"
"experiment is"
"you basically you don't add anything we"
"didn't put in any new"
um
"nanomaterials or"
"synthetic biology circuits or nothing"
"like that we we engineered by releasing"
"constraints so what we did was we took"
"away the other cells so here are the"
"skin cells let's"
"remove them liberate them from uh"
"the the native um"
"environment where they're normally told"
"what to do by these other cells and see"
"what they want to do well there are many"
"things they could have done they could"
"have died they could have crawled away"
"from each other they could have made a"
"two two dimensional flat layer like cell"
"culture instead what they do is they"
"show you what they really want to do"
"when they're not bullied by the other"
"cells when they're not made to with"
another
"behavior shape to be a skin layer they"
"form this this this three-dimensional"
"very active creature known as a cinnabon"
"it swims around on its own it has"
"behaviors it's able to make copies of"
"itself by assembling other pieces of"
"skin together there's all kinds of"
"interesting things"
"and uh that's what these cells normally"
"do how come"
"that's what they want to do how come"
"they don't normally do that because what"
"evolution has done is figure out how to"
"make the other cells"
uh
"force these cells to do that right so"
"again as i was saying at the beginning"
"evolution is all about behavior shaping"
"it's not about controlling the hardware"
"the hardware does what it wants to do"
"but but the behavior shaping the signals"
"are what give you the the outcomes"
"so uh"
"yeah you find out about the plasticity"
"that evolution in fact"
"does not give you"
um
"machines that solve a specific problem"
"they they they give you a more general"
"problem-solving device and that"
"actually if you ask where do the"
"properties of the zenobot come from"
"it's hard to say it was selection"
"there's never been any zenobots there's"
"never been any selection to be a good"
"xenobot there's never been pressure to"
"be a xenobot why are they zenobots"
"because there's creativity because uh"
"the intelligence the collective"
"intelligence of these cells is able to"
"come up with new solutions to problems"
"and in this new configuration it figures"
"out a way to be a coherent organism"
"yeah so basically you just take this uh"
"skin cells and they they form into a"
"kind of small"
"organoid kind of things that the uh the"
"question would be"
um
"how do they control their size do they"
"have like different uh sizes in general"
um
"and um so at the end it is again the"
"same thing that it is about the cell to"
"cell interaction which or the cellular"
"communication with changes and they they"
"now kind of form this"
"xenobots right"
"yeah i mean the size you can it depends"
"uh you can somewhat control it by"
"putting different numbers of cells into"
"into a into a pile but when the zenobots"
"make other zenobots when they make"
"copies of themselves they will make"
"certain sizes by corralling a certain"
"number of cells together how that works"
"we're not sure yet um"
"and uh yeah and then and then like with"
"everything else we as engineers have to"
"figure out what are the stimuli that we"
"can we can give these things to um"
"to get them to make new shapes i mean"
"with some some of that in the papers you"
"can see we use ai we use machine"
"learning to come up with ways to sculpt"
"these things there's just the very first"
"step there's going to be a million other"
"ways to do it but the very first step"
"which is very simple with sculpting that"
"we can we can"
"we can use the machine learning to"
"predict ways to sculpt it in ways that"
"and all the machine learning was done by"
"josh baumgardt's lab and at the"
"university of vermont uh they make these"
"tools that allow us to search the space"
"of possible interventions and tell us"
"how to relate to the system how do we"
"control it"
"fascinating and um so about the"
"regeneration again um and since we are"
"again talking about this stem cells and"
"most likely the somatic cells right so"
"what is the difference so um is it is it"
"uh possible that the regeneration is"
"more uh most likely close to uh or is is"
"dependent on stem cells itself now of"
"course the the question would be what"
"what does this mean to have stemness in"
"the cells"
"well it's known it's known that the stem"
"cells in planaria produce all of the"
"tissues so so in order to have new cells"
"you need stem cells so of course that"
"absolutely is dependent on the stem"
"cells but that's like that's like saying"
"if somebody says uh hey uh this this"
"this you know this computer is able to"
"uh you know is able to play chess and"
"they say yeah that's because of the"
"great silicon that's in there i mean"
"kind of that's true right it wouldn't"
"happen without or or you say well that's"
"because the power's on yeah you know"
"kind of true but but mrs misses the"
"misses the point so so you certainly"
"need the stem cells you certainly need"
"the stem cells to be making other cell"
"types but you know teratomas you know"
"there are tumors that have skin and"
"teeth and hair and bone and all this"
"stuff and they're a terrible mess it's a"
"tumor not an organism the stem cells did"
"the right thing they all made their"
"tissues they made hair follicles and"
"skin cells and bone cells the stem cell"
"biology is fine but it's not enough to"
"solve these problems"
"yes um but"
"but the"
"but i think uh this this explanation"
"kind of explained that why uh so let's"
"say if if someone cuts our hand it's not"
"like it'll regenerate right and and the"
"reason would be"
"whether the you know stem cells and"
"their communication i mean just because"
"we don't have the stem cells uh or as"
"many standards sure i'm not sure that's"
"i'm not sure that's true at all uh"
"frogs are like humans they um they don't"
"have a lot of stem cells the way that"
"planaria do they they do tissue renewal"
"so skin makes skin bone makes bone"
"muscle makes muscle and so on and we"
"were able to make frogs regenerate their"
"legs we didn't do particularly anything"
"to the stem cells"
"i'm not sure you know deer deer"
"regenerate their antlers so it's a large"
"adult mammal that grows a centimeter and"
"a half of new bone every day when"
"they're regenerating so i'm not sure i'm"
"not sure to what extent actually stem"
"cells are going to be a huge part of"
"this but maybe um"
"certainly maybe certainly even if even"
"if they're an important uh requirement"
"they're not sufficient you know they may"
"be necessary but they're certainly not"
sufficient
so
"that means the major driver would be"
"something like bioelectricity"
"i i think so but but uh it there"
"the key the thing i'm sure of is that"
"the major driver is going to be an"
"informational process"
"which which maybe is driven by"
"bioelectricity i would put my money on"
"that but but that remains to be seen but"
"the thing for sure is going to be um"
"the uh the driver is the decision by the"
"cellular collective of what are we going"
"to build that's the first step if you"
"don't have that nothing works and"
"nothing's going to happen and that may"
"be uh fundamentally a bioelectric"
"process or it may include many other"
"things so let's let's talk about the uh"
"the role of your work in um in the in"
"health in medicine and um"
"in in general like how"
"better we can study biological system"
"well uh and i i have to do a disclaimer"
"here because i have a i have a company"
"that look at david kaplan and i"
"found it called the morphaceuticals inc"
"so uh"
"we are pursuing this kind of thing but"
"to me the"
"biggest barrier to"
"really transformative regenerative"
"medicine is the uh universal assumption"
that
"living things are best controlled at the"
"micro hardware level that we should be"
"looking at pathways rewiring pathways"
"individual genes genome editing that"
"kind of stuff"
"there will be low hanging fruit that are"
"addressable that way i'm sure"
but
"the general power of regenerative"
"medicine is not going to be achieved"
"that way i don't think i think what we"
"do need to do is to figure out what the"
"innate competencies of cells and tissues"
"are we need to understand how to"
"communicate with them"
"and uh"
"we need to exploit their uh the"
"intelligence of cellular collectives to"
"call up outcomes that are too complex"
"for us to micromanage like growing back"
"organs and so on"
"perfect and what are the major questions"
"coming next from your side"
"well my group works on a number of"
"interesting things so we have projects"
"in cancer on repairing birth defects on"
"regeneration of course"
"we're doing some things in on on machine"
"learning creating um kind of robot"
"scientist platforms that help human"
"scientists make hypotheses and discover"
"better ways to communicate with"
"electrical and chemical interfaces in in"
"regenerative medicine um and of course"
"developing further these conceptual"
"ideas around what is agency and how do"
"we best understand other minds"
"yeah this is so exciting or at least i"
"am really excited about it uh and um so"
"thank you so much for accepting the"
"invitation uh sharing your impressive"
"work and i think it can it it has the"
"ability to transform"
"our thinking about biology thank you so"
"much thank you so much yeah thanks for"
"the conversation i appreciate it"
thanks
you
