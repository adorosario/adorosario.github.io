"i'm really excited to be here today with"
"mike and mark on dr michael levin and dr"
"mark soames"
"dr songz is known for his use of"
"psychoanalytic methods in contemporary"
"neuroscience and he's author of the"
"marvelous book the hidden spring a"
"journey to the source of consciousness"
"which we talked about before on this"
channel
"and he's also a professor at the"
"university of cape town and the director"
"of the neuropsychology program there"
"and awards too numerous to mention i'll"
"say it's a long list of awards that he's"
"got and dr michael levin is the"
"principal investigator at the levin lab"
"at tufts university"
"director of the allen discovery center"
"there and also the tufts center for"
"regenerative and developmental biology"
"he's also active in leadership at three"
journals
"bioelectricity collective intelligence"
"and laterality"
"and i know these two have a lot to talk"
"to each other about because i asked them"
"to give me some questions and they gave"
"me some amazing questions which we'll"
"get to in a minute"
"but before we do i wanted to talk to"
"them about an idea i've been tossing"
"around and get them to give their"
"opinions about it"
"well not your opinion exactly i'd like"
"you to talk about it from your"
respective
perspectives
um
"i think this whole issue of opponent"
processing
"because part of what we're going to talk"
"about later is ai and i know opponent"
"processing is very important in ai"
"but i think opponent processing kind of"
"works throughout the universe"
"in a lot of different levels and"
"one example i could give for our viewers"
"is just sympathetic and parasympathetic"
"systems where the sympathetic system is"
biased
"towards looking for and interpreting"
"evidence that you should raise your"
"level of arousal while the"
"parasympathetic system is biased towards"
"trying to find evidence that you should"
"reduce your level of arousal"
"now the way that john verbake talks"
"about this in his awakening from the"
"meaning crisis is that"
"these two are opposed in their goals but"
"interdependent in their function"
"optimizing between systems that are"
"working different goals but integrated"
"in their function"
"so that the system constantly self"
"organizes and thereby adapts its"
"fittedness to the environment"
"owen barfield who is"
"was a contemporary of the inklings"
"wrote a lot about the the evolution of"
"language and in there he talks about"
"these two opposing ideas of accuracy and"
expression
"and i think that that"
"binary also works in a lot of different"
"levels accuracy and expression"
"and um"
"another good example of opponent"
"processing is marriage"
"because i think you have these these two"
"opposing views but if they work together"
"you have the opposing"
"pressure and then you have the"
"connecting pressure and when they're"
"working together you get the"
"benefit of the creativity that comes out"
"of that"
system
"so i'm wondering if you see that kind of"
thing
"in your"
"departments in the kind of work that you"
"do and if you could kind of toss that"
"idea around with each other"
well
"let me dive in uh i mean certainly i"
"agree with you that"
"the the the concept"
is
"is uh"
"of fundamental importance"
um
"the concept of opponent processing as"
"and you also mentioned artificial"
"intelligence so within the sort of"
"computational neuroscience world"
"um i think that the"
"the um"
"duality between"
"explo explore and exploit you know uh"
"is comes to mind as a as a fundamental"
example
um
"where a system and"
"like an organism"
"on the one hand"
"needs to exploit the resources that are"
"available and"
"and its behavior its policies um are"
"directed to doing so"
"but in doing so you are not aware of you"
"know the bigger picture"
"um and so"
"sometimes it's better to not go for a"
"short-term win and rather go and see"
"what's what's on the other side what's"
"over the hill um you might discover that"
"there are far greater riches than uh"
resources
"in the sense of riches you know than"
"than or in front of your nose"
"and so and done at a at a"
"neurobiological level"
um
this
"comes to"
um
the
"what what yak pancep called the seeking"
system
"the mesocortical"
"mesolimbic dopamine system which which"
"works homeostatically like all of these"
basic
"affective systems do"
"but it works in a kind of in the"
"opposite way to how one normally thinks"
"of homeostasis in other words it"
"positively engages with uncertainty so"
"it's homeostatic set point is"
yes
"i don't know about this this is new this"
"is unknown to me"
"let me let me head towards that rather"
"than away from that"
"rather than moving away from uncertainty"
"so it's a fascinating system uh in the"
"brain of fundamental importance to how"
"how we all function"
"um then"
"one other thought before i hand over to"
mike
"in the same sort of general ballpark of"
"of computational neuroscience is um"
"is um"
"the the the duality between"
um
"accuracy and complexity or rather"
"perhaps i should say accuracy and"
"simplicity you know on the one hand"
"so accuracy always comes with complexity"
costs
"so you can have an overly complex model"
"and an overly complex predictive model"
"an overly complex"
"way of"
"modeling the world that you have to"
"survive in"
and
"it brings you great complex i mean great"
"accuracy but you know you just got too"
"big a model and it's the the the"
"developing and servicing of such a model"
"ends up overfitting the world and so"
"you you want what you want like einstein"
"said is we want things to be as simple"
"as possible but no simpler than that um"
"so you want a model that's that's"
"efficient uh that generalizes"
"um that you don't have to have a"
"different a whole new"
"complex set of assumptions in order to"
"deal with each and every eventuality you"
"want to have something which generalizes"
"so but that comes at with accuracy costs"
um
"so those are those are the first two"
"examples uh within my world that come"
"come to mind as illustrating the point"
"that you're making namely that these"
"sorts of opponent processes understood"
"very broadly uh are are of ubiquitous"
importance
"yeah um uh it's it's it's funny uh as"
"soon as you ask that question i was also"
"thinking explore exploit and i think you"
"know mark described it beautifully so i"
"think um one thing i could add is a"
"different kind of example of explore"
"exploit which is"
"this this question of uh how seriously"
"does evolution and development take"
"prior information so for example uh one"
"one thing that we know in development is"
"that there is amazing plasticity so if"
"if we make uh so-called picasso tadpoles"
"where all the craniofacial organs are in"
"the wrong place so the eyes on the side"
"of the head the jaws are off to the to"
"the other side everything is scrambled"
"what we find is that these or these"
"animals still make largely perfectly"
"normal frogs because all of the"
"different parts of the face will move"
"around through novel paths that they"
"normally don't take and sometimes they"
"in fact go too far and have to come"
"double back a little bit but they keep"
"doing it until they land in the correct"
"orientation so what you learned from"
"this is that"
"uh the the the uh the"
"the genome of the frog doesn't build a"
"machine that uh is hardwired to move"
"every piece of the face a correct"
"distance and that's it but in fact it"
"makes some sort of error minimization"
"scheme that can get the job done even"
"when things start out in in weird"
"configurations and we have many other"
"amazing examples of that and so so"
"that's so that's very interesting"
"because it looks like what the process"
"of evolution produces is not something"
"that simply locks on to past solutions"
"to this environment let's say how to be"
"a frog you know everything you need to"
"be a successful frog and just sort of"
"executes on that exactly the same each"
"time but it but it but it makes a um"
"a machine that's actually much more"
"complicated and is able to uh deal with"
"novel circumstance and to uh solve new"
"problems that uh that it hadn't had"
"before and again many many interesting"
"examples and so"
"so that that kind of that that balance"
"right so so how much do you lock in on"
"the lessons of past environments and"
"what you've learned from selection and"
"past generations versus how much do you"
"put into make it being a general-purpose"
"problem-solving device which again has"
"lots of costs associated with that but"
"in fact"
"enormous capabilities for uh adaptive"
"response to new circumstances so that"
"again i see i see that as well as this"
"as a balance of explorer exploit just on"
"a different scale"
"but would it be fair to say that a cell"
"knows more that it can execute"
"based on any one rule it might be given"
um
"i mean and when i say rule i mean like"
"when you inject a little bit of"
"electricity to kind of send a new signal"
"and then the cells will go off and do"
"something entirely novel"
"do you think it's because there's more"
"capability in the cell"
"there's there's more information in the"
"cell than it"
"can execute at any one given time"
"there's a reserve of information and"
knowledge
"knowledge i'm using that roughly but"
"it's fair um i would say i would say uh"
"slightly diff well i would say two"
"things one is that"
"most of what i'm going to talk about uh"
"in this context is not are not"
"properties of single cells they're"
"properties of cell networks so these are"
"these are i mean cells do it too but but"
"most of my really good examples are at"
"the tissue and organ levels so it's sort"
"of collections of cells doing"
"interesting things and and and you're"
"absolutely right because what what we"
"have with these collectives uh they're a"
"kind of collective intelligence that"
"navigates different problem spaces so"
"they navigate morphological space they"
"navigate physiological space all these"
"spaces and they have uh interesting"
"policies for navigating that space that"
"allows them to exhibit all kinds of um"
"problem-solving behavior but we don't"
"see most of it you know you put you put"
"them in a particular context and"
"you will see one kind of thing that they"
"can do"
"they absolutely could have done other"
"things if you had asked a different"
"question of them if you put them in a in"
"a different environment with a different"
"challenge you would have seen many"
"capabilities so"
"almost universally i think with very few"
"exceptions these things for sure have"
"the ability to do more than what they're"
"doing at any one moment they have"
"different ways they can navigate those"
"problem spaces"
"well so this raises another question for"
me
"and this will be my last question before"
"i let you get started on your questions"
so
"in both the case of the i know um"
"mark when you talk about the the brain"
"stem being kind of the the springboard"
"or the source of consciousness because"
"of that"
"element of homeostasis um trying to"
"balance values"
"and then we have these cells that in"
"community can do these amazing things"
"it seems to me like there has to be some"
"kind of language there"
"even if it's a very simple language that"
"something like"
"this or that"
"here or there now and not now"
um
so
"what accounts for that"
"it's choice it's definitely choice right"
"and it's some kind of language that"
"allows them to communicate this with"
"each other"
um
"if i'm understanding you correctly"
"you're talking about"
"the fact that we have multiple"
"homeostats um you know we we"
"we complex organisms have many different"
needs
"that all of which have to be met each in"
"their own right"
"um but"
"you can only do so much at a time you"
"know so there's a sort of action"
bottleneck
"uh you have multiple needs"
"some of which can be um"
"simultaneously met most of our autonomic"
functioning
"it's not done in"
"series it's done in parallel but when it"
"comes to the um"
"what's called allostasis you know the"
"having to do things in the outside world"
"in order to maintain your homeostasis"
"uh then you have this action bottleneck"
"and so there has to be a prioritization"
"uh of of your needs"
"um and and i i i personally think that"
has
"a hell of a lot to do with what"
"ultimately leads to consciousness"
um
"what is prioritized um is the need"
"where you use the word choice you see i"
"don't think that"
"the the the"
"there has to be a selection"
"um that's not quite the same thing as"
"the folk psychological meaning of the"
"word choice which is something"
deliberative
"um but the the need"
"that you have"
"the least"
"pre-prepared policy as to how to meet"
"this need here and now"
"that's the one that needs the most"
"choice in this in that sense of the word"
"in other words there's the greatest"
"uncertainty as to what must i do so i"
"can relegate these other ones to"
"automaticity i've got predictions that"
"are more or less viable uh you know and"
"we're speaking about a cross-section in"
"times at this point in time those can be"
"relegated to automaticity this one"
"i need to"
"as it were"
"palpate my uncertainty i need to feel my"
"way through the problem um and and and"
"decide is this working or isn't this"
"working i think the very basis of choice"
"um is"
"uh is being able to change your mind um"
"so you know you have a policy and you"
"are you palpating your uncertainties in"
"other words your degree of confidence"
"uh in is this working or isn't this"
"working and how i link that with"
"consciousness is i think that feeling"
"in the sense of valence in other words"
"this is going badly or this is going"
"well is how an organism"
"registers how an organism that has this"
functionality
"how it registers how well it's doing"
"so this is going badly this is going"
"well in other words i increase my"
"confidence in this policy i decrease my"
"confidence in this policy"
um
"and uh you know so if things are turning"
"out as expected that's good uh if"
"uncertainty prevails that's bad and so"
"this is the valence aspect"
"of affect which i think is so"
"fundamental to consciousness but"
"it's the consciousness is not just"
"valence it also has a multiplicity of"
qualities
um
"and this comes back to the starting"
"point that you raised that there's a"
multiplicity
"of homeostats a multiplicity of needs"
"they each have to be met in their own"
right
"and so how we register which need"
"is being prioritized is what it feels"
"like so it's so hunger feels different"
"from thirst because there's a different"
"kind of problem here so there's not just"
"one continuous variable of need there"
"are categories of need and i think"
"that's the ground zero basis of qualia"
"because categorical variables are"
"qualitatively distinguished from each"
other
"i hope i'm not over answering your"
"question oh not at all no no no i uh"
"yeah that that's categorical"
"variables are qualitatively"
distinguished
"yeah so like you can't say"
"you can't say um i've got 8 out of 10 of"
"sleepiness at this point in time and"
"2 out of 10 or first"
"so that makes a total of 10 out of 20 of"
need
"so all i need to do is sleep you know"
"and then i'll reduce the total"
"the total quantity of need so that's"
"reducing them to one continuous variable"
"one common denominator"
"it doesn't work like that biologically"
"you have to drink and you have to sleep"
"you know and you have to uh eat and you"
"have to"
"defecate and you have to urinate you"
"know etc etc so each one of those needs"
"has to be met in their own right"
"um although they all are needs in other"
"words they're all reducible to"
um
"within my frame of reference you could"
"say they're all contributing to the free"
"energy of the system"
um
"but you ca but but free energy"
"minimization uh as a continuous variable"
"is not enough you need to factorize it"
"according to these different"
"categories of need because they all have"
"to be met in their own right and and the"
"main point that i"
"that was the two main points i was"
"trying to make there the one is that"
that
cut
"the qualitative distinction between"
"these categories of need"
"is a fundamental basis"
"it's sort of it sort of lends itself to"
"the very idea of the qualities in the"
"mind that these are different types of"
thing
"um and the the one that's prioritized is"
"the feeling that now comes to"
"consciousness um and then that the"
"palpating of how well is my current"
"policy my current action program"
"doing is is tethered to the the valence"
"within that particular affect of"
"category and this this i think is is"
"fundamental to"
"how consciousness works"
"well if we take that down to the cell"
"level mike when the cells are"
"communicating with each other to get a"
"task done"
"the eye is"
"the eye is in the wrong place on this"
"tadpole head and they have to move it"
"into the right place"
"it seems like there would be a lot of"
"tasks involved with accomplishing that"
one
goal
"and um"
"how do the cells work together to"
"prioritize what step to take first and"
"what step to take next and"
"i mean how do they communicate to each"
other
"yeah yeah so so i want to be clear that"
"if i had the exact answer to this uh you"
"know we would we would then have"
"you know regenerative medicine and uh"
"you know uh and so on and so so we are"
"far from it from a complete answer to"
"this but um basically everything that"
"mark was just saying is exactly uh uh"
"pertinent to the case that we're talking"
"about so these this this system"
"is is what we call a multi-scale"
"competency architecture meaning that at"
"every level so the the gene regulatory"
"networks are optimizing certain things"
"and trying to reach certain goals and"
"the uh the the cytoskeletal system in"
"the uh the cells themselves and the"
"tissues that make up uh that are made up"
"by cells and so on all of these things"
"simultaneously are competing and"
"cooperating towards specific goals uh"
"one of the things that i mean we know"
"some of how they communicate so they"
"communicate of course chemically but"
"also electrically so they form"
"electrical networks that are able to"
"learn from experience and store memories"
that
"guide future behavior and so they"
"navigate these various problem spaces uh"
"in that way uh there um"
"there are all sorts of competitive"
"interactions so during embryogenesis the"
"different organs and tissues actually"
"compete for resources both metabolic and"
"informational even though they're all"
"genetically identical and supposedly are"
"supposed to cooperate in fact they do"
"compete with each other and so the uh"
"the final product that we see and"
"including the failure modes so there's"
"all kinds of ways this can go wrong both"
"in in development and regeneration aging"
"and so on"
"all of this is uh"
"the result of a very complex uh"
"cooperative set of cooperative and"
"competitive interactions both within"
"each level and and across levels right"
"and and what we see is the sort of the"
"final uh the final result but all of"
"these things are trying to optimize"
certain
"certain measurables in their own problem"
"space that they that they work in"
"okay that gives me enough to chew on so"
"now now let's see what you want to ask"
"each other"
um
"mike you wanted to ask mark um well you"
"you you brought up your question why"
"don't you go ahead and pick one of your"
"questions and ask him"
"sure i mean so so one thing i'm really"
"interested in is to uh kind of um get"
"your take on the very earliest steps of"
"of of of being of being an organism and"
"let's say a human so so i like to work"
"it backwards i like to rather than i i"
"think you know when we start off asking"
"if various simple things are cognitive"
"conscious whatever we get into a lot of"
"trouble so i like to work it backwards"
"we start with an adult human where i"
"think we can agree on controversially"
"that whatever"
"consciousness and cognition is we have"
"it whatever that is and then and then we"
"can sort of work it backwards so we can"
"work it all we can we can follow very"
"slowly all the way back to when we were"
"a quiescent oocyte right a a you know"
"just uh just a simple cell a collection"
"of quiescent chemicals that eventually"
"became fertilized became a"
"a collection of cells and then sort of"
"embryogenesis that is slowly developed"
"into a particular uh into a particular"
"advanced form and so i would just love"
"to kind of hear your take on that on"
"that process and where"
"uh what what you think the important"
"milestones on that are because to me"
"where where it leads me is is to an"
"abandonment of binary categories so i"
"you know i i don't like questions like"
"is it conscious or isn't it conscious"
"you know is it uh i i find that the"
"gradual nature of development and"
"evolution really uh"
"require um a kind of continuum view so i"
"would just love to hear what you think"
"about that in particular and what the"
"waypoints on that continuum might be the"
"important ones"
um
"thank you uh"
so
"i i would start with you know so we even"
"at the level of an individual cell"
"you're talking about something a"
"self-organizing system that is trying to"
"carry on existing uh therefore um"
"a homeostatic system"
"um so the the basic mechanism"
"uh the basic principle this is why i"
"think your question is a very good one"
"the basic"
"problem space as you call it you know"
"of the single cell is not that radically"
"different from the problem space of the"
"of the mature organism and of the mature"
"human organism"
"if we're taking this"
"ourselves as the model example as you're"
"suggesting we do because we at least"
know
"that we ourselves have conscious"
cognition
"and your question is about at what point"
"in this"
"in this continuum from the single cell"
"or from the fertilized"
"single cell"
"do we get to"
"uh do we get to a conscious"
"uh cognitive"
being
"um so we start with"
"the raw ingredients that i think end up"
being
um
"the the fundamental mechanisms even at"
"the at the level of the"
"at the level of the mature adult"
"conscious human"
um
"self-organizing system"
"a homeostatic system a system that is uh"
"that that's problem is how do i continue"
"to exist even if it doesn't think that"
and
"reflectively and so i'm already"
"beginning to answer your question by"
"saying i do not believe for a moment"
"that the single cell"
"has thought processes but it has"
"something which is in the of the kind"
"that are going to become thought process"
"in other words a problem that it has to"
"solve the problem of how do i continue"
"to exist even though it's not"
"articulated as such it's just a blind"
"mechanism that drives the behavior"
"of of that single cell"
um
"i think that that is an important point"
"you know that that's your point i i take"
"it from what i've read of your work uh"
"and i've read your work with very great"
"interest i think that that's a"
"profoundly important point that which"
"that we uh that we can speak of the"
"cognition uh of the single cell"
"um and and and uh later we'll talk i"
"hope uh about whether uh it's it's"
"reasonable to draw a distinction between"
"um biological and non-biological"
"cognition when it comes to"
"if if this is what it's about it's not"
"something that's exclusive to biological"
"self-organizing systems"
um
"so homeostasis"
"and the complex of complex"
increasing
"complexifying of the organism um making"
"it better and better at doing that at"
"being a having more and more"
"capabilities um"
"into in"
"in in terms of solving that problem of"
"continuing to exist"
"in in in the environmental niche that if"
"in more environmental niches in a"
"multiplicity of niches for the same"
"organism and so on all of this demands"
"greater complexity in terms of the"
"the the um what we are calling"
"i say we because i think you and i share"
"that view the cognition uh the the the"
"intelligent behavior of the organism and"
"it doesn't even have to have a nervous"
"system and i agree with you there too i"
"think that we can talk"
"in fact i think we should talk um"
"of these things as being fundamentally"
"of the same kind"
um
"i do think that something happens"
"something special happens when it comes"
"to the nervous at organisms within with"
"the nervous system and so now since"
"we're speaking about human beings i"
"think uh at that stage in embryonic"
"development that that we're that that"
"the the the um neural plate develops i"
"don't think at this point we have we"
"have consciousness uh i think that we've"
"had cognition even before the neural"
"plate uh uh"
"uh becomes uh"
"distinguishable um but this is the"
"possibility of a nervous system which"
"has this kind of overarching integrative"
"function once you have a complex"
"organism and it has so many different"
"component needs"
uh
"to have some sort of meta homeostatic"
"mechanism something which which which"
"seems to be the basic function of the"
"nervous system"
"um but i don't think that that every"
"creature with the nervous system is"
conscious
"and so"
"i i think non"
"that creatures without nerve or the or"
"the fetus before it has a a"
"developed a nervous system is a"
"cognitive problem-solving"
system
"once it has a nervous system there's the"
"possibility of a higher order of"
integration
"between the component parts"
but
"since we're speaking in maturational"
"terms or gestational terms i would also"
"say that"
"because the fetus is"
in
"um embedded within the the the body"
"of it of its mother um it's its needs"
"are pretty much met um"
"for it uh and there's not a hell of a"
"lot of surprise um"
"and there's not a hell of a lot that it"
"can do so i think that at this stage the"
"problems are"
are
"pretty automatically met"
"um and i think that consciousness that"
"once we start getting to consciousness"
"um it's once you outside of that"
"kind of"
"problem space in other words you start"
"having to navigate situations for which"
"you do not have"
"pre-prepared predictions as to how to"
"solve the problem"
"and i think it's fairly obvious why it"
"would be a great adaptive advantage"
"to be able to solve problems for which"
"you don't have any uh any um"
"innate preparedness so i think it's at"
"that stage uh that we start speaking"
"about consciousness which for me uh in"
"its most elementary form is just feeling"
"just affective feeling in other words"
"the the organism becoming aware of its"
"own needs by feeling them"
"and i said earlier on in our discussion"
"uh when i was answering karen's question"
"that um"
"what i think that"
"being able to feel how well you're doing"
"uh what that contributes is the"
"possibility of choice choice is what is"
"required if you're going to navigate an"
unpredicted
environment
"so we can come back to at what stage in"
"fetal development and what aspect of the"
"development of the nervous system makes"
"that possible but i'm just wanting to"
"state the general principle here that i"
"think that it's primarily in postnatal"
"life once you start having to fend for"
"yourself uh and once you have the"
"metoric capacity to be able to navigate"
"any environment let alone i mean every"
"for for every"
"little human"
"this is a novel environment but you have"
"you have innate"
reflexive
"predictions as to how to deal with much"
"of what you're expected to deal with at"
"that stage"
"but i think even"
"even in utero there will be unexpected"
"developments that i think that there's"
"the possibility of there being some need"
"felt um but i don't i really don't know"
"obviously all of these things as you say"
"we're talking about about gradients"
"we're talking about you know not binary"
"situations i just think theoretically"
"there's the possibility i don't think"
"that that that it's impossible for uh"
"for a a a"
"a human fetus in utero to start to feel"
"the occasional something but i think"
"that feeling comes into its own um once"
"we are having to fend for ourselves in"
"in the outside world"
"and and having to do so by developing"
"our own policies where"
"where our reflexes and instincts reach"
"their limits"
so
"where reflexive and and instinctual"
"responses to homeostatic deviations do"
"not achieve the desired outcome uh then"
"the the possibility to be able to"
"we were talking about"
"explore and exploit earlier you know to"
"be able to explore new possibilities to"
"try out by trial and error uh different"
"different um"
"ways of acting uh that might bring me"
"back into my"
"preferred states back within my"
"homeostatically viable bonds i think"
"that being able to feel your way through"
"how well or badly you're doing"
"um in in that trial and error situation"
"that's the beginning of a of a conscious"
being
"um that i said i'll say something about"
"the machinery as karen said earlier i"
"believe the bulk of the machinery we're"
"talking about in the brain stem so you"
"know we're talking about a very"
"rudimentary nervous system that's got"
"this functionality"
"um and i in other words we're saying any"
"vertebrate has this functionality and i"
"don't by any means mean to imply that"
"only vertebrates can but we know that"
"the vertebrate brains uh you know the"
"the periaqueductal gray the reticular"
"activating system and the uh and the"
surrounding
"obviously including also"
"diencephalic structures like the"
"hypothalamus that this is all that you"
"need to have a sentient being"
"in the sense of raw feeling"
"but then you know what what's built on"
"top of that"
"if i may oversimplify by saying built on"
"top of that you know what i mean"
"um is is also terribly important you"
"know so for example the ability to not"
"only by trial and error feel your way"
"through a problem but to be able to"
"think your way through a problem uh by"
"by imagining what would happen if i were"
"to do that without actually having to"
"take the biological risk of trying it"
"is another enormous adaptive advantage"
"and as much as i say that consciousness"
"in its most rudimentary form is simply"
"raw feeling um i don't i don't"
"want to pretend for a moment that"
"the cognitive conscious thinking"
"deliberative sort of reflective kinds of"
"consciousness that of which we humans"
"are so"
"so you know"
"they have such unique prowess in those"
"departments that they they add a hell of"
"a lot more um and are a very important"
"part of what consciousness does"
um
so
"with the development um of a of the of"
"the cortex and the capacity to think in"
"other words to generate virtual"
"realities and to navigate"
"counterfactuals over"
"in some with some temporal depth you"
"know i think that's another very"
"important part of what we mean by a"
"conscious human that that that capacity"
"and of course those also not they're not"
"uniquely human capacities"
"um what becomes uniquely human"
"more or less and again i i agree with"
"you totally we don't want to draw any"
"binary distinctions here but you know"
"with development of language"
"and all that that does in terms of the"
"the capacity"
"for uh reflective thought um and"
"abstract thought uh etc uh you know then"
"then we have a fully fledged human form"
"of consciousness"
"so to summarize"
"um what i'm saying mike uh i think that"
"we have a a problem solving"
any
"even a single cell"
"is a is a"
"self-organizing system which has a"
"problem that it has to solve namely to"
"continue to exist and we do this by"
"homeostasis and that is a form of"
cognition
"and as it gets more complex so the"
"organism so it has more complex forms of"
"self-organizing behavior which we should"
"call cognition even if it's not nervous"
"um and then once we get to the nervous"
"system there's this higher integrative"
"capacity of the"
"the prioritization business for example"
"that karen was asking about earlier the"
"meta homeostatic uh functions um"
"that i think that a mind comes into"
"being in the sense of a conscious mind"
"uh once there's"
"felt once once you start to feel how"
"well you're doing and this is only"
"really needed once you start having to"
"fend for yourself in an uncertain"
"environment and then"
"the cognitive forms of conscious the"
"conscious forms of cognition that that"
"that are added to and elaborate um the"
"raw capacity to feel um that that those"
"uh develop with with the development of"
"cortex both um"
"onto genetically and phylogenetically"
"and ultimately ultimately you know it's"
"language so"
"that's how i see it um i i and implicit"
"in what i'm saying is also that i think"
"the crucial"
um
"the crucial problem"
"without wanting to make it a binary"
"again i really don't want to i think the"
"crucial transition"
is
"not so much from a non-cognitive to a"
"cognitive organism i think you can talk"
"about cognition all the way down"
"it's the transition is at what point"
"does it start to feel like something to"
"be that organism um that's"
"that's when we start speaking about"
"minds in the sense that we"
"sentient experiencing human beings think"
"of our mental life i think it's"
"that this comes into being"
"with with felt affect"
"yeah yeah very interesting um you know"
"one one thing that uh i've been thinking"
"a lot about lately is is this idea that"
"we are we because because our our"
"primary sense organs point outward in"
"three-dimensional space we are very good"
"at noticing problems and uh intelligent"
"and various degrees of uh intelligent"
"systems solving those problems so so"
"medium-sized objects moving at medium"
"speeds in in the three-dimensional space"
"so we can see and as you say you know"
"from that perspective the"
"the fetus doesn't have much to do"
"there's not much it can do everything is"
"sort of there and and all the all the"
"excitement starts you know sort of later"
"on when it has to navigate that that"
"world but but i i think that uh part of"
"the fact that we're so wired to to uh"
"really pay attention to that"
"three-dimensional space is that we"
"really i think neglect some other"
"problem spaces that are kind of uh that"
"we don't have primary experience with so"
"so for example"
"um if we had imagine that we were born"
"with a sense of uh a direct sense of"
"your blood chemistry you could feel all"
"the different parameters of your blood"
"chemistry and you could feel all the"
"things that your pancreas and your liver"
"and so on were doing to navigate that"
"physiological space every day i think i"
"think we would be we would be very um"
"in a much better place to recognize"
"those things as uh having some some"
"degree of competent intelligent behavior"
"in those spaces and i think for the"
"embryo one of the things that happens is"
"while probably the metabolics are taken"
"care of and the behavioral stuff is"
"taken care of what's really not taken"
"care of by the maternal organism at all"
"is the journey through morphospace so"
"you start off basically as a as a you"
"know as a collection of cells and you"
"have to end up being an incredibly"
"complicated organism which is this"
"really really difficult journey through"
"a space with all kinds of structure"
"through it and and you have to really"
"get to a pretty narrow region of that"
"space to be a normal uh"
"sort of a typical adaptively shaped"
human
"and that's that navigation of that space"
and
"um we're investigating this uh very uh"
"sort of actively right now involves all"
"sorts of uh problem solving and stress"
"responses and all kinds of things going"
"on that are not apparent in"
"three-dimensional activity but are"
"apparent if you were to look at the"
"configuration of the body through the"
"amorphous space and so i wonder uh and"
"these are open questions we don't we"
"don't know but i wonder because a lot of"
"the same kinds of processes that that"
"you mentioned that happen in the nervous"
system
"are happening in non-neural cells using"
"in fact uh the same electrical signaling"
"neurotransmitters all the same you know"
"serotonin is doing things from the two"
"cell stage it's already they're already"
"using all the same machinery and there"
"and and it's and it's using it to to"
"resolve these problems very actively in"
"that space and so i don't know and you"
"know we'll get to i mean you had some"
"amazing questions that we can we can"
"sort of discuss i i don't know if the"
"same if if it's not the case that the"
"same kinds of dynamics that give the"
"uh the the the affect and the qualia and"
"everything that you're talking about you"
"know what is it like to be i don't know"
"that that doesn't exist in this other in"
"this other space you know um we don't"
"know of course we have no no primary"
"experience of that but i think that we"
"should be we should be open to thinking"
"about exactly these kinds of issues that"
"i think very plausibly what you"
"described as being responsible for some"
"kind of um primary consciousness uh"
"all of that is happening in other spaces"
"and and and you know um we're just not"
"used to thinking about that in robotics"
"too you know when you when when you say"
"robots you think of a robot that"
"navigates three-dimensional space well"
"smart insulin pumps and various implants"
"that handle your neurotransmitter levels"
"and things like this those are really"
"robotics that navigate physiological"
"spaces and other kinds of spaces too"
"we're just not used to thinking about it"
"that way"
"but i think i think there's a lot of"
"intelligence happening that"
"at some point may or may not be"
"associated with some kind of primary"
"affect even if it's not 3d physical"
action
"i'd like to jump in here and just"
"connect these two ideas with something"
"that came to my mind and that is that um"
"mark was talking about how well that"
"that the"
"the affect is how well or how badly"
"you're doing"
"and mike you were talking about"
that
the
the
"cells have some idea of"
"how to get that eye into the right place"
"because they'll they'll go beyond"
"but then they'll come back"
"absolutely right there is a right place"
"there is something that is correct in"
"both cases how well or how badly you're"
"doing means that you're judging that"
"against some"
correctness
"most certainly"
"so we get into this problem of the map"
"and the territory"
"and the the cells"
"in union at least seem to have some way"
"of understanding"
"i'm using the word loosely understanding"
"where that territory is so that they're"
"adapting to the reality of that"
territory
"and in the same way i think that the"
"this whole issue of homeostasis is"
"adapting to the reality of the territory"
"so another way i think about this"
"opponent processing is the organism"
"on one side and the anomaly on the other"
side
"so the organism is always having to"
"adapt to anomaly"
"and and those two are also in opponent"
processing
"and um"
"i just wonder what you guys think about"
that
"yeah no you're absolutely right and i am"
"actually meant to to talk about this a"
"little bit i forgot um this this issue"
"of how well you're doing is absolutely"
"critical because that navigation"
"amorphous space requires the system to"
"uh be estimating an error function and"
"in fact the stress response long before"
"there's any behavior there are stress"
"stress responses in in embryonic"
"development that uh are related to"
"uh how far or how close you are from"
"your goal in morphospace and we know you"
"can see this very clearly when for"
"example a salamander"
"you amputate a limb it what the cells"
"will immediately regrow a new limb and"
"then the most magical part about it is"
"that it stops"
"well when does it stop it stops when a"
"correct salamander limb is complete"
"that's when everything stops so this"
"system like like normal development like"
"regulative development when an early"
"embryo is cut in half and you get two"
"monozygotic twins right because each"
"half can tell that it's missing in"
"a large chunk and then regenerates it um"
"all of these things require an estimate"
"of error and a constant feedback loop"
"and and maybe even you know sort of meta"
"most likely a metacognitive loops about"
"how well am i doing and um"
"you know where where am i towards"
"because because from the perspective of"
"each embryonic stage the prior stage is"
"basically a birth defect development is"
"a series of regenerative events that"
"that go from stage to stage by repairing"
"what we are now into what we're supposed"
"to be and and that that target"
"morphology which is basically the the"
"set point of the homeostatic process"
"whereas you know in physiology you might"
"be thinking of of a scalar for a set"
"point like a ph or a temp body"
"temperature or something like that in"
"development that set point is a rough um"
"uh a location in amorphous space and"
"and and these tissues are constantly"
"evaluating their um their distance uh"
"from that and of course that process is"
"not foolproof you can easily"
"mess it up and get birth defects and"
"things like that but but what they're"
"trying to do is"
"uh is get to this is get to this uh to"
"the correct configuration and"
"we now know that at least one of the"
"mechanisms that stores that"
"configuration because you might ask well"
"how does the tissue know what shape it's"
"supposed to be"
"at least one of the mechanisms that"
"stores it are bioelectrical pattern"
"memories i mean literally the way that"
"it's that that we took all the"
"techniques from from neuroscience you"
"can apply that to non-neural cells and"
"you can see you can now read out the way"
"that people are trying to do neural"
"decoding to read memories and things"
"from a living brain"
"we can now do this in in certain cases"
"in the tissue and we can see for example"
"regenerating flat worm fragments we can"
"see the memory engram that tells them"
"how many heads they're supposed to have"
"and better yet we can rewrite that"
"electrical information to tell a"
"fragment that actually a good worm"
"should have two heads and that is"
"exactly what the cells build and it's a"
"very good memory because afterwards the"
"fragments of that worm will continue to"
"form two heads and on and on without any"
"changes no genetic changes no nothing"
"wrong with the genome"
"it's it's it's literally a resetting of"
"the of the electrically"
"uh mediated uh target morphology"
"information the memory of where in"
"morphospace they're supposed to be there"
"are different attractors we can push"
"them we can push them to attractors"
"belonging to other species so i can take"
"a piece of um of a flap of a completely"
"genetically wild type flatworm and"
"confuse that"
"that navigation process so that it ends"
"up building ahead of a different species"
"100 million years evolutionary distance"
"with the exact same cells nothing wrong"
"with the genome and and so that that"
"navigation uh is is is very related to"
"this question of how how well am i doing"
so
"i think what we're talking about"
"um that there's a there's a continuum"
here
"um between"
"at the one end"
"let's start at the top end"
"my most of my colleagues remember i'm a"
neuropsychologist
"most of my colleagues neuropsychologists"
"cognitive neuroscientists"
they
"they are corticocentric when it comes to"
"consciousness yeah you know so not just"
"nervous system-centric you know they're"
"corticocentric and and in fact um a good"
"many of them"
"it's it still really surprises me i"
"can't get my head around for the field"
"excuse the pun but you know"
"many really respected the leading"
"cognitive and affective neuroscientists"
"and neuropsychologists still think that"
"it's only human beings only human cortex"
a
"prefrontal cortex with language attached"
"then you have consciousness so that's"
"the one extreme"
um
like
"i'll give a very famous example joseph"
"ledoux joseph ledoux an affective"
"neuroscientist who studies his"
subcortical
circuits
"and has done for decades and made such"
"fundamental contributions to our"
"knowledge of how the emotional brain"
"works he believes that all of that is"
"entirely unconscious what's going on in"
"the amygdala and and and and other"
"subcortical survival circuits as he"
"calls them"
"until the output of all of this is read"
out
"in prefrontal cortex and literally"
"labeled this is fear only at that point"
"does the feeling of fear appear"
"so that's the one extreme"
"at the other extreme we have pan"
cyclists
"uh like um like nagel and and and and"
"charmer seems to have gone that way"
"and and so many other"
"you know um"
"really uh good minds"
"um believe that everything has got a"
"little bit of consciousness you you're"
"talking you're somewhere"
"in in between mike when you speak about"
"you know"
"should we not talk about this as"
"problem-solving behavior is it not a"
"matter of feeling your way through"
"the problems of morphogenesis and so on"
"um you know they go way deeper than that"
"and they say a grain of sand has got a"
"little bit of grain of sand"
"consciousness so"
"if we if we take those two extremes"
um
"my main"
"my bread and butter"
"is fighting"
"up here with my colleagues"
"who are who are claiming it's all"
cortical
"and um when i draw attention to the"
"just absolute oodles of evidence uh for"
"the i mean one piece of very dramatic"
"evidence is adrenaline cephalic children"
"born with no cortex whatsoever you know"
the
the
"all the evidence is that they are"
"feeling beings i mean you know"
"you have to just"
"uh you have to just not want to see that"
"to to to not see it"
um
"so my battles are there you know i'm"
"trying to persuade my colleagues"
"that uh the cortex is not where it's at"
"uh that that it goes it's a lot more"
"basic than that consciousness is"
"something much simpler"
"and i don't mean to when i say simpler i"
"don't mean simple you know consciousness"
is
"a much more rudimentary function than"
"these cortical functions it's a much"
"deeper function in the brain that goes"
"way back"
"and then i said earlier you know we"
"there's every reason to believe once you"
"understand that those are the crucial"
"circuits that you know that every"
"vertebrate is conscious every vertebrae"
"and then you look at the behavior of"
"cephalopods and insects and so on and"
"you've got to say there's just no good"
"reason to believe that they're not"
"conscious so"
"those are the battles i'm fighting i"
"want to say that"
"in order to contextualize you know what"
"i'm going to say now in response to what"
"you said mine because i'm on the side of"
"let's try to"
"you know let's let's not be so"
"anthropocentric let's not be so"
"corticocentric let's not be uh you know"
"it's it's it's it's it's let's go down"
"down down down down but i don't find"
"that myself"
"in sympathy at all with pan cyclists"
"so you know it's a matter of trying to"
find
"where where do i locate myself here and"
"i think i'm much more in sympathy with"
"you than with my corticocentric"
"colleagues um but i'm also much more in"
"sympathy with you than pan psychists"
"assuming you're not a pan psychist but"
"we're still going to learn that in this"
"in this conversation"
um
so
"within that broad context so i'm a human"
"being i'm conscious um and i'm i'm aware"
"that i'm not conscious of one of those"
um
"you were speaking of you know if if only"
"we were conscious of things like a blood"
"gas balance um you know then we wouldn't"
"think of consciousness in such a"
"three-dimensional state space a sense"
"that we would think of it as something"
"utterly different well actually i i"
"think it is it's affect that's what"
"affect is affect is not a treatment that"
"does not have to do with"
"three-dimensional space it's got to do"
"with the state of the organism how am i"
"doing in the sense of my homeostatic"
needs
um
and
"so so"
"i was just speaking about blood gases"
"you know we're not normally aware of"
"of our regulation of our blood gases"
"respiratory control is autonomic"
"until we find ourselves in an unexpected"
"situation like a carbon dioxide filled"
room
"and then suddenly"
"the air hunger which is which is"
"consciousness of your blood gas balance"
"you know it forces itself into"
"consciousness you have a you have"
"suffocation alarm"
"and it's i i think it says everything"
"about what feeling is for"
"uh if we try and understand well why do"
"you become conscious of of of your blood"
"gas balance at that point in time it's"
"because now you don't know what to do"
"now you don't have a pre-prepared"
um
"prediction as to how to"
"regain homeostasis in relation to that"
"particular need parameter"
"now i say i am a conscious human adult"
"i'm aware that my respiratory control is"
"not normally conscious i'm not normally"
"aware and and i can go deeper than that"
"and i can say i'm not aware of my blood"
"pressure regulation ever"
um
so
"that that does not deny the possibility"
"and and i think this is along the lines"
"of what you're saying"
that
"prior to my becoming an adult"
"corticalized human being"
"when i was first solving these problems"
"maybe at that point i was conscious"
of
"these what what later become purely"
"autonomic functions i i don't exclude"
"that possibility that's why i wanted to"
"make clear that i'm heading in your"
direction
"i have sympathy with people who's saying"
"don't don't don't over"
"anthropomorphize and corticalize and"
"neuralize and so on everything um so i i"
"think it is possible i really do think"
"it's plausible"
"that but but i'm aware that actually me"
"in my state uh i'm not aware of those"
"things i'm not conscious of those things"
"so what i'm saying is that there is a"
"hell of a lot of those sorts of problems"
"that you're talking about that are going"
"on in me right here and now that i in"
"terms of my empirical capacity to"
"observe whether i'm conscious of them or"
"not i have to say i'm not so you know i"
"think a lot of those sorts of things can"
"go on unconsciously and do go on"
"unconsciously and once we've solved the"
"problem which we might at one stage be"
"conscious of we then"
"consolidate the solution and it becomes"
"less conscious it becomes more automatic"
"so the fact that something is"
"automatized at one point in development"
"doesn't mean it always was"
"always was automatized and unconscious"
"but but the the processes that you were"
"talking about this is why i'm taking"
"such pains to make sure that you know"
"i'm on your side"
"the processes that you're describing"
"there are there's a relatively limited"
"repertoire available at uh to the organ"
"to the to the uh during the maturational"
"process that you describe and and i i'm"
"because there's a limited repertoire and"
"because as you said sometimes things go"
"badly wrong"
"because there's such a limited"
"repertoire you know you the the the you"
"can't deal with every eventuality you"
"don't have the toolkit to be able to"
"deal with eventualities outside of that"
"repertoire um i i'm also open to the"
"possibility that those things don't need"
"to be felt i think that if they are if"
"they are naturally selected"
"um predictions uh a repertoire of them"
"is available to the evolving uh maturing"
"uh embryo"
"in all of these creatures that you're"
"talking about i can see all sorts of"
"problem solving that can be done without"
"without this without the need for"
"feeling so i'm i'm you know i really"
"have an open mind about it uh i i think"
"is the the the best that we can do"
"um is study very carefully the behavior"
"the the the evidence for choice"
"you know is there evidence for a choice"
"having been made here which was this"
"particular organism's own solution to"
"that problem which has nothing to do"
"with what what was given by natural"
selection
"oh and there are there are great"
"examples i mean there are fantastic"
"examples of this um"
uh
"well one one example is that uh"
"normally so so let's take a let's take a"
"salamander and this the salamander um"
"these they they have these um uh kidney"
"tubules you know these little tubes and"
"if you take a cross section through that"
"tubule you see that there's usually"
"about eight to ten cells that make up"
"the the the per the circumference of"
"this of this tubule and the cells that"
"work together to build this kind of like"
"tube so one thing one thing that you can"
"do is uh artificially make the early"
"cells very large in fact the way you do"
"that is by increasing the amount of dna"
"they have and it's amazing that you can"
"just increase six-fold eight-fold times"
"the normal genetic complement no problem"
"the cells are fine but the cells get"
"very large and as the cells get very"
"large what happens is that fewer and"
"fewer of them will work together to make"
"the exact same size tubule and so the"
"first choice they have to make based on"
"how big they are which is completely"
"unexpected evolutionarily because that's"
"not what standard newts are they can"
"figure out uh how many cells there"
"should be and the most amazing thing"
"happens when you make the cells truly"
"gigantic one single cell will bend"
"around itself leaving a hole in the"
"middle and make and make that nice"
"tubule and what's amazing about that is"
because
"it it that's a completely different"
"molecular mechanism so instead of cell"
"to cell communication it's now"
"cytoskeletal bending that enables it to"
"do this so so in a completely novel"
"scenario so so basically development"
"can't even trust that your cells are the"
"right size never mind can i trust you"
"know what the environment is you can't"
"trust how much dna you have you can't"
"trust how many cells there are because"
"some may be cut away you know to make"
"twins you don't you don't even know what"
"uh what the size of your parts are going"
"to be your cells might be gigantic and"
"what you need to do is find a different"
"molecular mechanism that normally isn't"
"used for this purpose at all and create"
"the exact same structure meaning"
"navigate to that region of amorphous"
space
"using using a different underlying"
"molecular mechanism you know it's an"
"amazing kind of like top-down causation"
"because in the service of that"
"anatomical uh large-scale anatomical"
"property you can call up different"
"molecular mechanisms so that's one"
"example another example is"
"uh these uh the xenobots that we make"
"out of uh out of frog skin cells that"
"basically these these completely wild"
"type genetically unmodified skin cells"
"taken out of their normal environment"
"meaning away from the instructive cues"
"of the rest of the cells and you get to"
"find out what they actually want to do"
"on their own they actually want to make"
"this self-motile little proto-organism"
"that has all kinds of behaviors and it"
"can make copies of itself from loose"
"skin cells that it finds in the"
"environment and all this amazing stuff"
"that it never normally does um there's"
"never been selection to be a good"
"xenobot there's never been any zenobots"
"these are all things that are done you"
"know sort of on the fly within 48 hours"
"all of these things come together"
"uh yeah and so and so different kinds of"
"of decision-making novels probably you"
"know problem-solving and novel scenarios"
uh
"there are many many examples of this in"
"in in in development and"
"and and regeneration and so on and so"
"my gut feeling is that"
uh
"while you and i you know we're here"
"having this conversation with our"
"advanced uh sort of the"
"consciousness is talking to each other i"
"think that our"
"it's very likely to me that our bodies"
"contain additional"
"much sort of very different and and and"
"in some ways inferior and in some ways"
"uh very equally complex uh kinds of"
"intelligences that we never hear from so"
"so we can tell each i mean i feel like a"
"unified single being of course as as"
"presumably to you"
"but there are other i think there are"
"others with with us that we just never"
"hear from they're not capable of"
"language not capable of speech"
"whether it's anything to be like them i"
"i have no idea how you know whether"
"that's the case but i think we are a"
"collection of such we are not it's not"
"just us you know it's not just you and i"
"in this uh"
"in this in this scenario i think there"
"are others in here"
"and i think some of that if i and i'm"
"not an expert on this but i believe that"
"some of the early work on split brain"
"split brain patients already started to"
"show us that right when when when when"
"you pull one the the language hemisphere"
"to sleep you find out that actually"
"there are some opinions and some some"
"preferences and some other things that"
"you normally never hear from from that"
"individual that are hanging around and"
"just suppressed by the you know by the"
"language i thought that's my"
"understanding of some of that literature"
"well i must emphasize again you know"
that
"when it comes to me you're pushing"
"against an open door you know i'm i'm uh"
"i really am sympathetic with with"
"everything that you're saying"
um
"i i to me it will be"
"it'll require"
"very little adjustment of my basic"
"orientation you know to"
"to to to accept that the processes that"
"you've just described"
are
"feeling your way through the problem a"
"novel problem"
"i i would be happy to"
"accept that my my own point of view"
"starts with you know we have to start"
with
"just this simplest self-organizing"
"system you know that that's that's the"
"beginning of what becomes all of this"
"marvelous stuff that with that that is"
"that is human mental life um"
"and self-organizing systems are not even"
"uh you could you have pre-biological"
"self-organizing systems you know so i'm"
"all for seeing the continuity i think"
"that this is how we can have a physical"
"science uh of of consciousness is"
"precisely because it's not something"
"magical and something special it's"
"something that emerges by degrees so i'm"
"i'm wholly on the same side as you"
however
"just just because i want to keep an open"
"mind i also want to say"
"that um"
"if what you were just talking about so"
"the cytoskeleton suddenly becoming the"
"the solution to the problem and that"
"this is an entirely novel solution is it"
"not the case that every time you pack"
"this additional dna into the make these"
"super large cells"
"every time they will find the same"
"solution so there is there is still a"
"fixed repertoire there it's not that's"
"not quite the same thing as choice in"
"the sense that this individual"
"organism with i can call it that this"
"individual organism has found its own"
"solution is the is that solution not"
"imminent somehow in its design"
"even though because if you modify the"
"design in this predictable way it will"
"lead to this predictable novel solution"
"which suggests something other than"
choice
"in the way that i'm using the word"
for
"in my own individual lifespan i"
"by feeling my way through the problem"
"come up with my solution to the problem"
"which won't be the same as my neighbors"
"yeah well i i'm i'm in no way suggesting"
"that that this system is as"
"sophisticated as let's say human or or"
"even you know"
"mammalian problem solving in open"
"environments i think that there are many"
problem
"sets where uh in fact uh there may only"
"be one or a few ways to solve the"
"problem and you know you can set up for"
"a chimp or a human you can set up some"
"kind of a thing where the way to solve"
"the problem is to go find the key pull"
"it out you know do this and that and"
"then you get your solution the fact that"
"there's only one way to do it doesn't"
"neglect from from the doesn't detract"
"from the fact that you've got a being"
"that never saw this problem before and"
"yet is able to use available tools in a"
"different way to get where they're going"
"right so it's entirely possible that in"
"that scenario there really is only two"
"ways to make a tubule right one way is"
"multiple cells one way is to bend"
"yourself there may not be any other way"
"to do it i don't know um the interesting"
"thing is to me that what what makes this"
"an example of a novel problem-solving"
"again not as sophisticated as what other"
"systems can do is that neither of those"
things
"you know we say it's imminent"
"it's it's imminent in the sense that"
"you ha you were given by evolution the"
"parts so you have a cytoskeleton if you"
"didn't have that that would be hopeless"
"right so you're given the parts"
"but what you were not given is any"
"selection pressure in the past to know"
"how to do this because it's never"
"happened both in the zen about case and"
"in this case"
"these aren't completely novel uh you"
"know you were never trained or either"
"you know in the behavioral case you"
"would be trained in the evolutionary"
"case you would have a prior history of"
"selection for it as far as we know these"
"things i i have i have other examples"
"here's another example um"
"uh planaria flatworms when you put them"
"in the solution of barium their heads"
"explode because barium is a non-specific"
"potassium channel blocker so they can't"
"pass potassium through their cell"
"membranes their heads explode within two"
"weeks they grow a new head that's"
"completely barium adaptive doesn't care"
"about barium whatsoever and if you look"
"uh what's different about the barium"
"adapted head with the original head"
"there's only a handful of genes that"
"were up and down regulated out of tens"
"of thousands that they have to solve"
"this particular problem now barium is"
"something that you never find in nature"
"ever and so so this is you know in a in"
"a let's say 20 000 dimensional space of"
"all the different genes you could turn"
"on and off"
"you have to find that small number and"
"you don't you don't have very long um"
"in two weeks is not a long time for"
"these cells uh to find the right"
"complement that will allow you to solve"
"that physiological stressor"
"which which evolutionarily has never"
"come up before using the tools that you"
"have which are various other"
"transporters and that you know a few"
"other things so you know i i agree with"
"you that it's not as sophisticated as"
"full-on mammalian problem-solving"
"but i think we are seeing"
"novelty in the sense of reusing the"
"tools i mean it's kind of it looks like"
"at every iq test i've ever seen like"
"here here are five objects use it to to"
"you know to to hold this candle up on"
"the wall or something and then you say"
"well how am i gonna do that and you sort"
"of figure it out that's that's these are"
"the examples that that we see you know"
"reuse of the tools you have in novel"
circumstance
"well um"
"it's it's it's really fascinating what"
"you're saying is fascinating and and and"
"really important"
"um so karen said earlier we we had uh"
"thought up some questions for each other"
"um uh prior to this meeting and what"
"you're saying now leads naturally to one"
"of the questions that i wanted to ask"
you
um
"i i"
"i accept um in fact it was it was partly"
"you that persuaded me uh your you know"
"your work that persuaded me that we"
should
"we should speak of uh"
"this level of process that you're"
"describing here we should speak of it as"
"cognition that's what it is you know"
"it's uh there's no there's no difference"
"between between the the the processes uh"
"that you are describing"
"in terms of what they actually do what"
"they actually are how they actually work"
"they are this is cognitive problem"
"solving this is exactly what we're"
"talking about"
so
"my question to you is that do you think"
that
"all that all cognition is conscious"
"cognition is it is or is there a"
"distinction between conscious and"
"unconscious cognition or conscious and"
"non-conscious cognition and and if if"
"there is such a distinction you know why"
"is there such a distinction and and and"
"and uh and and how do we how do we draw"
"it how do we distinguish between"
"conscious and non-conscious cognition if"
"we're going to use the word cognition of"
"all the way down"
"as you're persuading us to do"
"yeah but yeah i've thought a lot about"
"this and uh you know you may have seen i"
"i don't talk about consciousness a lot"
"in in my work i mainly focus on on"
"cognition and so so i don't have a"
"strong i don't feel that i i have a"
"strong answer to this so i will kind of"
"give some thoughts but um i i don't i"
"don't think i have a strong answer uh"
my
"my gut feeling is that um i i in working"
"backwards from whatever it is that we"
"are down to a a single sort of quiescent"
"cell oocyte"
i
"don't find any"
"sharp line that i can draw where i think"
"okay here's where consciousness winks"
out
"so from that perspective i'm tempted to"
"say that"
"all cognition has some degree or type of"
"consciousness associated with it i'm"
"sort of leaning in that direction"
"because because i'm not finding any any"
"kind of sharp place where it makes sense"
"to say here's where it stops"
"uh i i think that our our fundamental"
"problem with this which is the problem"
"of other minds is that we're dealing"
"with an n of one example each of us"
"personally and then also evolutionarily"
"we really don't have experience with a"
"wide range of other types of"
"consciousnesses we only really know the"
"one that we have in the example of"
"humans and what not um that we have we"
"have scientifically so"
"uh i think that uh i'm"
i'm
"pushed towards thinking that there is"
"some type of uh"
"some type of consciousness accompanies"
"all cognition because i don't know where"
"to put the cut off and i don't know how"
"we would test it you know other than i"
"mean the only"
"thing i can think of so you know to be"
"able to test it so i had so i had this"
"this thought experiment you know how can"
"we um"
"how can we move from from a third person"
"typical scientific investigation of of"
"uh mind which turns out it turns out to"
"be like behavior and physiology is what"
"we do in third person to a first person"
"kind of answer of what is it like to be"
"x and y and so you can sort of imagine"
"the spectrum right on the one hand"
"here's a brain i'm a scientist studying"
"this brain i've got some electrodes and"
"some mri and some other things in there"
"and uh and it all comes out on a monitor"
"in some massaged way the data and then i"
"can see it with my retina and so what"
"i'm really studying is behavior and"
"physiology i'm not really studying the"
"affect of what it's like to be this this"
"organism and then i can say well"
"why do i have this monitor uh in the way"
"here why don't why don't we take take"
"the data that comes out of it i'm going"
"to plug it directly into my brain maybe"
"through my retina maybe somewhere else"
"but i'm going to directly uh i'm going"
"to instrumentize these um these"
"electrodes the way that people now have"
"prosthetic senses right you can you can"
"have all kinds of different senses that"
"you can that you can integrate into your"
"into your brain that are novel and and"
"so and so that that gets me a little"
"closer and after a while i say you know"
"but my electronic interface is really"
"kind of low resolution compared to what"
"the biology does let's just fuse our"
"brains together right and you can do"
"this certainly certainly at earlier with"
"with um"
"uh with with axolotls and other"
"organisms that are much more plastic in"
"adulthood you can you can literally fuse"
"fuse the brain together and then we have"
"a situation that basically the fusion"
"has similar i think similar"
uh
"kinds of qualities as the two"
"hemispheres stuck together in the first"
"place there's a by this biological"
"tissue connecting connecting these two"
"um these two regions and i think then"
"what happens is that"
"you don't really find out what it's like"
"to be that other creature but you do"
"find out what it's like to be a"
"composite creature made of both of you"
"the same way that you and i know what"
"it's like to be a composite creature of"
"our two hemispheres and all the stuff"
"that's in there uh you know along the"
"along the other dimensions and so so i"
"think by by this kind of"
"now what happens there is that you"
"unlike normal third-person science you"
don't
"you don't get to remain unchanged while"
"you do these experiments i think these"
"kind of experiments would change you"
radically
"but then you get to find out something"
"about what it's like"
"from a from a first person perspective"
"in the absence of that"
"i don't really know"
"how we can"
"say anything uh really definitive about"
"about consciousness and the and the"
"thing that bothers me about"
"uh problem"
"about the science of consciousness is is"
this
"this this is what i think is really the"
"hard problem for for every other field"
when
"when they're working on some theory we"
"have some idea of the format of the"
"predictions of that theory so so so it's"
"whether it's quantitative it'll be"
"numbers or equations or something we"
"have some idea of what what do the"
"predictions look like even if we don't"
"have the theory and we don't have the"
"predictions we know what they're going"
"to look like"
"i don't know what the format of it of a"
"correct theory of consciousness is going"
"to look like so if somebody says to me"
"here's a you know here's a here's a"
"standard creature or here's a standard"
"creature with a third"
"hemisphere sort of grown in during"
"development or here's something else"
"and if i had a correct theory of"
"consciousness what would it output would"
"it output"
"if you know numbers and behavioral"
"predictions don't do it because that's"
"not the study of consciousness that's"
"the study of behavior what would it"
"actually output i don't i don't know"
"what that would look like would it be uh"
"poetry art would it be something that"
"puts you in the same or at least tries"
"to put you in the same um affective"
"state as whatever you're looking at i"
"did that that's that you know it seems"
"different to me than every other"
"uh kind of kind of typical third-person"
"science because"
"in those cases we know what the output"
"can be right so so that's anyway so so"
"that's that you know i guess that's a"
"that's a long-winded statement of my"
"ignorance that i really don't know"
"um aside from actually becoming uh"
"physically connected to these uh to to"
"another crew to another organism to know"
"what it's like to be a composite i don't"
"know how we"
"say much about the first person um"
"conscious experience"
"i'd kind of like to jump in here for a"
"second because you brought up poetry and"
art
and
"i have to take a drink of water because"
"i'm a little nervous talking about this"
but
"if i think about consciousness from the"
"human level and maybe there does need to"
"be another category maybe there is"
"something besides consciousness that it"
"is to be human"
"i mean i've seen all the cartoons of"
"how they're exiting off all the things"
"that we used to think it meant to be"
"human because now ai can do that as well"
"but maybe there is an additional thing"
"that it means to be human"
"and let me just throw this out here"
um
"what what i do as an artist when i'm"
painting
"and i think it's very similar to what a"
musician
"took what a composer does when they're"
composing
"a piece of music"
"it is said that mozart claimed that a"
"symphony would arise in his brain in an"
"instant complete"
"and then he went through the process"
of
"arranging all the different parts"
"and then"
"writing down the musical notation and"
"and the"
um
the
"the rhythms and all of those things that"
"would make up each instruments part of"
"that piece of music"
"and then when he got it all written down"
"then the instrument instrumentalists"
"would come in and that they would begin"
"to play it and then when they play it"
"with their own"
"flexibility in the way that they allow"
"their expression through the instruments"
"and the whole thing arises and it all"
"lines up then you have the symphony that"
"was in his mind in the beginning"
"so when i paint"
"an idea will come to my mind"
and
"from that moment on i am trying to"
"express that idea on a canvas"
"and that involves having the canvas and"
"the tools and the materials the paint"
"and so forth"
"but there is also in my brain all the"
"things that i have integrated about the"
"elements and principles of art and"
"design through the centuries"
"and my own aesthetic"
"and my own ideas of beauty and of"
"meaning and all of that and so as i'm"
painting
"every stroke that i make"
"well first of all from the moment of the"
"first stroke i have delimited what can"
"be the final result because each"
"subsequent stroke is limited by the"
"previous strokes"
"i can no longer get to my original"
"perfect image that was in my brain"
"because my hands have"
"made some choices that may have not been"
"perfect choices"
"but every stroke that i make is building"
"up the texture"
"and the um"
"the rhythm and the harmony and the unity"
"of this piece of art"
"working through all the elements and"
"principles until"
"some and and part of the way that i work"
"is like an opponent processing where i"
"create chaos"
"and then i look in the chaos to see"
"where the patterns are in the chaos and"
"i draw the patterns out of the chaos"
"and then i"
"begin to paint"
"with the patterns until finally the work"
"of art arises"
so
"it seems to me that there is"
"there is some sort of"
"top-down thing that's happening where i"
"know what i'm working towards but the"
"thing that i'm working towards came to"
"me in a moment"
"and then i have to reach that thing in"
"the same way"
"that the cells"
"have to make this decision in a moment"
"in order to reach this correctness that"
"they're looking for but it's coming down"
"through levels"
"every level is moving down into the next"
"level into the next level into the next"
level
"in the same way that you think about the"
"inside and the outside of something like"
"at a mechanical level you can think of a"
watch
"the inside of the watch has all sorts of"
"complicated stuff going on in it"
"but for me on the outside all i have to"
"deal with is the the dials you know all"
"i have to do is read it maybe push a few"
buttons
"i don't have to know what it's like to"
"be the inside of the watch in order to"
"utilize the watch"
"and so i wonder"
"when you have a community of cells"
"the community of cells doesn't know what"
it
"doesn't need to know what it's like to"
"be an individual cell"
"but they do need to know what they're"
"working towards"
"in order to use the cells together to"
"build this thing that they're working"
towards
"now i'm not a cognitive neuroscientist"
"or a biochemist or any of those things"
but
"but these are the things i think about"
"yeah well i think what you've just"
described
"the where it"
"where it"
"interdigitates with what mike and i are"
"discussing is more uh it's more mike's"
"field than mine uh you you're talking"
"about this idea i'm a salamander"
"all of these things are going to happen"
"but in the end i'm going to be a"
"salamander and then i'll stop"
um
"that seems to be the analogy that that"
"you're using that that"
"and and then all of these multiple"
"routes by which one gets to what"
nevertheless
"was a pre-existing"
"preconception of salamander hood"
um
"am i following you correctly karen"
"well yes except that i am i am the thing"
"that you're working on"
"right i am the human consciousness and"
"and that's the way that that i work and"
"i can ima i could tell the same story"
"going all the way down through all the"
"levels i think i could i could tell that"
"same story at the"
"at the community of cell level because"
"the community"
"is working here's the thing about art"
"you're working within a set of"
"constraints a very tight set of"
"constraints and that's what creates"
"that's what enables the creativity if i"
"had no constraints then the path ahead"
"of me would be combinatorially explosive"
"i would have no idea what the next step"
"is but because i"
"have this tight set of constraints that"
"i work within then the next step makes"
"itself available to me"
"maybe a variety of next steps make"
"themselves available to me but i can"
"choose between them but if i had to look"
"at an infinite array"
"i wouldn't be able to move forward i"
"think the same problem happens for the"
"cells as long as they stay in community"
"they can solve these problems because"
"they're working together with this"
connection
"but if a cell breaks off and decides i'm"
"going to go off and do my own thing it"
"becomes cancer it becomes a reciprocally"
"narrowing static"
"thing that is"
"ultimately going to create death for the"
"organism so"
"instead of the community thriving the"
"community dies"
"because the connection was lost"
"and i think there's something similar"
"going on in the consciousness that that"
"there is a connection that has to be"
there
upward
"i mean i think there are these levels"
"that go down through and go back up"
"again the whole thing is uh"
"is a loop"
"well within my way of thinking that and"
"this also touches on the split brain"
"stuff that mike was referring to earlier"
"that that that connection"
"um is"
"is brain"
"it stem"
located
"way down uh in the in the brain stem"
"which is where your your sort of"
fundamental
"sentient selfhood arises"
"just a raw experience of being"
"and then all of this elaboration"
that
"of the higher stories"
"um you know that's that's now the"
"picture that comes to my mind from from"
"what you're saying the unifying so"
"they're all the little or the swarm"
"intelligence all of these little modules"
"that are doing these little"
"specialized things uh what unifies them"
"is that they're all in the service of"
um
"one feeling being trying to carry on"
existing
um
"but i'd like to go back to what mike"
"said um about um you know when in my my"
"question to you mike about um cognition"
"versus consciousness"
"i i"
"i i absolutely"
"agree that there's no sharp dividing"
"line you know but the fact that there's"
"no sharp dividing line doesn't mean that"
"the thing goes all the way down you know"
"you can you can say i agree there's no"
"sharp dividing line"
"um but to the extent that there is such"
"and such functionality just to that"
"extent you know what one one speaks of"
"of feeling"
um
so
"you know the fact that you uh"
"are a"
"biological creature and it feels like"
"something to be you"
"um and then you say well it seems like"
"the same sorts of processing is going on"
"all the way down"
"uh you know therefore i can't exclude"
"the possibility that it feels like"
"something to be all that processing all"
"the way down i i think that that's"
"plausible that also doesn't necessarily"
"follow you know it's correct"
um
now
"um the"
"the the fact against sticking with this"
"very simple uh"
"the problem of other minds that the only"
"thing we've got is our own experience uh"
"of what it's like to be a mind uh what"
"it's like to be a human mind"
"um and uh within my own experience you"
"know i i think there's something really"
"interesting which is that"
"i am not aware of so much of what's"
"going on within me you know so so"
"um i i think that"
"the the simple example i gave earlier of"
when
"respiratory control becomes conscious"
"tells us something about you know what"
consciousness
"when consciousness is required and when"
"it's not required"
"and without repeating my whole argument"
"you know i i i think that um"
"studying that transition what brings it"
about
"uh is is is one way in which we can"
"begin to um"
"probe um"
the
"first person"
"there is an empirical access to"
"to the problem by the first person now i"
"am um"
"for my sins you know i mean i i really"
"did something crazy for a neuroscientist"
"which is that i trained in"
"psychoanalysis precisely because of the"
"problem that you're talking about you"
"know that that we are constrained by the"
"the methods uh and and um"
"a canon of of third-person science and"
"and uh you"
"you literally in my view cannot have a"
"science of the mind if you exclude the"
"first-person perspective"
because
"that's what a mind is it is the"
"first-person perspective and you know"
"we've done great violence to"
"the this uh part of nature in the"
"history of psychology"
"by trying to exclude that"
"um that uncomfortable fact about minds"
"minds are subjective"
"um and so for all of its faults"
"that is why i trained in psychoanalysis"
"i wanted to i wanted to take seriously"
"the subjective nature of the mind and"
"see what can we learn from the first"
"person perspective about how it works um"
"and the the"
and
uh
"the the the thing that i learned"
"as uh"
"well first of all"
"through undergoing psychoanalysis myself"
"which is a big part of the training for"
"psychoanalysis and then"
"from conducting psychoanalyses and i'm"
"linking back to what you were saying"
"karen you said well i'm i'm a human"
"being let me tell you what it's like"
"when i try you know when i do such and"
"such and you know that's what"
"psychoanalysis at its best is is that's"
"what it's trying to do it's trying to"
"systematically uh with all of the"
"difficulties uh in studying subjectivity"
"it's trying to systematically study a"
"very large number of human subjects"
"from the point of view of what can we"
"learn about what makes us tick uh from"
"the perspective of"
"of being"
"as a sentient subjective uh human and"
"one of the things that it led us to"
"in psychoanalysis which is why i ended"
"up coming back to uh"
"because i mean i i didn't want to be an"
"analyst i wanted to see what could we"
"bring into neuroscience from"
"psychoanalysis in order to"
"address this this problem"
"that mike's referring to of you know you"
"need to have a first-person perspective"
"if you're going to study consciousness"
and
"and if you're going to equate mind with"
"consciousness it's the only way you can"
"do it well that's psychoanalysis is one"
"way you know of going about doing it and"
"what i learned there is the centrality"
"of affect the centrality of feeling uh"
"in one of the things that you miss when"
"you study the mind from the third person"
"point of view is the importance of"
"affect because affects can only be felt"
"um and you know when you study human"
"beings subjectively"
"from that using that kind of methodology"
"you learn it's all about feelings and"
"everything that we do is in the service"
"of what you know what it feels like"
um
"and uh so that's what led me you know"
"down down that path and um"
"but to come back to a third person"
perspective
"i i you know i i really i i i i"
"sympathize entirely with your"
"your you're confronting the problem of"
"other minds directly and saying this"
"just kind of this just"
"i don't know mark well how to answer"
"your question there's nothing to be done"
"you know it's like short of"
"you know"
becoming
"conjoined uh with"
"another brain uh which in any event"
"changes it into you know"
"it's no longer i'm not knowing what it's"
"like to be that other brain because now"
"we're conjoined you know it's"
"you know i really am sympathetic with"
"the the gravity of the problem of other"
"minds but"
"i think that um"
"there are sort of there are some some"
"third-person starting points you know"
like
um
"what makes it of course everything has a"
"subjectivity in the sense that there's a"
"perspective you know you can say it's"
"just a special reference point uh if you"
"take your spatial reference point is"
"you know this computer"
"then the the"
"from the perspective of the computer"
there's
"you know there is such a thing"
"geometrically speaking"
um
"but but"
"it when does it become plausible to"
"to entertain the possibility that there"
"is something it is like to be"
"uh to to to assume that perspective i"
"don't think that it's equally plausible"
"as i was saying earlier you know a grain"
"of sand"
"it's not equally plausible that there's"
"something it is like to be a grain of"
"sand than that there's something it is"
"like to be"
"the sorts of processes you described you"
"know at the even at the unicellular"
"level uh it seems plausible there and"
"then you know you've got to start"
"breaking that down and saying why why is"
"it more plausible"
"um that it's there's something it is"
"like to be a cell or a fetus or a or a"
salabander
"yeah and and why is it implausible that"
"this that this why does it at least to"
"me it's implausible but you know you"
"can't just say my intuition is it's"
"implosable you want to start"
"delineating what are the mechanics of a"
"of a grain of sand which makes it"
"unlikely that there's something you'd"
"like to be one"
"right i just want to mention here that"
"um that mike has to leave in 10 minutes"
"and so i just want to tell you that if"
"when he goes it's not unexpected so mike"
"did you want to respond to that"
"in your 10 minutes please respond to"
"that and tell us what are the mechanics"
"that make it plausible to speak about"
"safety and subjectivity"
"yeah um i think well look i i mean"
"you're right on the money of course uh i"
"everything you said i agree with um"
"one interesting thing and and i'm"
"certainly not the best person to uh re"
"kind of capitulate all that reasoning"
"and so so"
"you know you could have them on karen"
"and c but um uh but both carl fristen"
"and chris fields and maybe other people"
are
"working on"
"uh recasting basic physics using some of"
"the same active inference kind of"
"dynamics that we use for a lot of the"
"biologicals and so if that project works"
"out now i i want to be clear you know"
"pan psychism the the the problem with"
"with traditional pan psychism is that"
"if you just simply take existing physics"
"and then sort of paint on oh all of that"
"plus by the way you know all the"
"electrons are having like hopes and"
"dreams like that doesn't that doesn't"
"help anybody that that's you know that"
"that's that's useless but what they're"
"doing is something quite quite different"
"which is recast basic physics to look"
"exactly like the kinds of dynamics that"
"we're using to analyze cognitive systems"
"and to the extent that if if that"
"project pans out"
"then it isn't uh unreasonable to say"
"that right the thing that makes it"
"plausible is a specific kind of"
"predictive interactions with the outside"
"world and and so on and by the way that"
"goes all the way down to"
uh
"whatever it goes down to and then what"
"life is good is it is is scaling up"
"right so the of course the basic the"
real
"point of pansexism is to understand the"
"scaling so why is it that you know um"
"it's very simple things like like rocks"
"and and particles all they can do is"
"least action kinds of things so they can"
"find low you know lowest free energy"
"formulations and and so on but but"
"larger biologicals can can can work"
"towards much larger goals and and and"
"you know i've been working on the story"
"of scaling of goals but all my stories"
"begin with cells and up you know i don't"
"really deal with what happens before"
"that but but but there is work on that"
"so i think it's not impossible that we"
"end up with a kind of uh retelling of"
"basic physics that basically makes it"
"very hard to uh to to to stop that that"
plausibility
"from from going all the way down the"
"thing that i find the intuition pump"
"about all of this that i find really"
"helpful to really get a full grasp of um"
"how what what a tight spot we're in is"
"basically the thing that uh science"
"fiction has been dealing with for for a"
"couple of hundred years now which is"
that
"you know there you are um you're you"
"know you're trained in neuroscience"
"psychoanalysis everything else and one"
day
"spaceship lands on your front lawn uh"
"this this thing sort of wheels itself"
"out and you start having a conversation"
"with it that looks very much like the"
"conversations that were published"
"recently in this whole um you know thing"
"about lambda right and and uh"
"all of that so it's so it's telling you"
"how happy it is to see you and look i've"
"traveled all this way i'm delighted to"
"meet another mind and you know hands you"
"a poem and some other stuff and so now"
"you're saying okay so"
"what do i think of this creature i'm"
"certainly not going to find anything"
"resembling a cortex that seems unlikely"
"i'm probably not going to find any of"
the
"typical structures that i'm used to"
"looking at i see lots of crazy"
"intelligent behavior i see the fact that"
"it's passing some version of the turing"
"test with me here and now i have a"
"problem and it's not only a scientific"
"problem it's a moral problem because the"
"question now is do i get to take it"
"apart and see what makes a tick or is"
"this another being to whom i owe you"
"know rights and respect and and all the"
"things that we're used to"
"uh uh giving to to other minds and uh"
"and so so what is it that we then start"
"looking for i mean i think people uh"
"there's this whole outrage about the you"
"know well you can't just use the turing"
"test that's you know you get fooled by"
"that fair enough"
"and then and then and then they say well"
"you know it should have a brain and this"
"and that well in this case no you"
"wouldn't expect it to have a brain and i"
"cert i think it's implausible to think"
"that in the whole universe there's only"
"one class of minds and those look like"
"our brains i think that's that's pretty"
"crazy so what do we then look for right"
"like i mean so so i'd love to hear your"
"thing like how do you can you"
"psychoanalyze this thing and sort of get"
"some intuitions about what to expect"
"like what would you look for in that"
case
"yeah so from for me"
the
"psychoanalysis just means taking"
"the taking seriously"
"what can we learn about is a system an"
"organism uh from the first person point"
"of view in other words from"
"interrogating its subjectivity that's"
"that's all that psychoanalysis is at"
"least that's what's interesting to me"
"about psychoanalysis"
"so you know if you"
"see if you were saying can you"
"psychoanalyze such a system i mean of"
"course it would be"
"uh all that that means is"
"how would you go about trying to"
"ascertain from this"
"agent what it's like to be it and and"
"and then you know what can you learn"
"from that and then"
"my field"
"which is the interface between that and"
neuroscience
"it would be and what are the neural"
"correlates of that and what can we learn"
"about what the underlying mechanisms are"
"that by looking at the neural correlates"
"of these subjectively reported states"
"what can we discern about what is it"
"that explains both of them you know"
"getting down to the fundamental"
mechanics
"which is um"
"which is why i'm in another way very"
"sympathetic with your project because i"
"actually am"
"i'm very afraid with that literature"
"that you were referring to um"
"fristen's particular physics"
"and uh maxwell ramstead just wrote a"
"brilliant paper with him where they cite"
"you quite a bit"
"and it prompted me to ask maxwell are"
"you have you become a pan-cyclist"
"and he said no i'm a pan-cognitivist uh"
"in mike levin's sense of the word and"
"this was why i was wanting to probe with"
"you what is the difference between"
"between cognition and consciousness"
"what is the difference between a pan"
"cyclist and a pan cognitivist but i"
"wrote a paper with um with carl fristen"
"in 2018 uh in the journal of"
"consciousness studies but the title of"
"which was how and why consciousness"
arises
"and it was pretty much the things i've"
"been saying tonight about that about"
"affect being the fundamental form of"
"consciousness and it being tied not to"
"free energy in and of itself"
"you know"
"free energy i think is balanced i think"
"it is it just is bad for any"
"self-organizing system to have rising"
"free energy um but that's that isn't the"
"same as consciousness for me"
"it has to do with these categories that"
"i was speaking of earlier and and then"
"to do with the"
"um you know"
"the kind of functionality that that"
"becomes possible when you're registering"
"those qualities as i said using the"
"model example of air hunger why does it"
"intrude on it consciously so that sort"
"of approach um he and i are very much on"
"the same page we wrote that paper"
jointly
"i i don't think that he would describe"
"himself as a pan cyclist there's a you"
"know there's"
"a self-organ as a purely monotonous"
"self-organizing crystal uh doesn't have"
"the kinds of dynamics that we're talking"
"about yeah um"
"go ahead"
"oh so sorry no please please finish"
"no i i'm morally sad and i also see that"
"we we've got one and a half minutes left"
"so i think you should have the last word"
mike
"um well i'll all i'm gonna say is i mean"
"this is this has been uh incredibly"
"fascinating i'm i'm so pleased to have"
"had uh the chance to uh speak to you"
"about this and um yeah thank you karen"
"for for setting it up and i i'd love to"
"i'd love to talk more i think uh this"
"issue of what do we do when faced with"
"unconventional agents that have"
"no familiar"
"miles you know landmarks for us to look"
"at for so there are no neural as such"
"correlates there's behavior but then a"
"lot of people want to say well behavior"
"is not sufficient because you can be"
"fooled by these large language models"
"and things like that so so if you don't"
"have if you don't have behavior and you"
"don't have anatomy to look at what is it"
"that you're looking at right and i think"
"i you know i'll say i'll say i i'm a pan"
"cognitivist i'm i'm kind of agnostic on"
"the pan psychic"
"psychism thing i i'm just not sure how"
"we resolve that problem so i don't make"
"any strong claims about it but i think"
"thinking hard about"
"synthetic systems whether made by us or"
"whether discovered somewhere else uh"
"what are the criteria by which we make"
"these decisions so i think that's you"
know
"well mark you had this great question"
"you said that you were going to describe"
"your project to develop a conscious eye"
"and ask mike about it i'm wondering if"
"we could do this again and just approach"
"that question i would love to hear about"
"it yeah i'd love to would you have time"
"for that mark"
"yes i think that's an excellent idea"
"because i mean you can see how that"
"trenches on everything that mike's just"
"said it's all of um i mean that's and"
"all of the methodological and"
"epistemological problems that we are"
"facing in that project i by the way in"
"my team there's somebody else who you"
"might know mike who's ryan smith"
"uh you don't know him no"
"so um but in fact we had a meeting"
"yesterday and maxwell joined us and"
"we're talking about exactly these things"
"we're trying to develop a conscious ai"
"precisely because i believe those those"
mechanics
"are independent of"
"of our human biology i think that if you"
"know if you believe you can explain in"
"terms of those"
fristonian
"statistical mechanical terms you can you"
"can explain how how consciousness arises"
"then you should be able to engineer it"
"but then the problem is the one that you"
"were mentioning and once you've once"
"you've engineered it how do you"
"demonstrate that you've done so uh in a"
"way that will persuade your colleagues"
"so i think that would be a"
"i mean just any opportunity to have"
"another conversation with you i would"
"enjoy enormously if we could start with"
"that topic uh that would be a couple"
"days okay"
"for our next episode"
"thank you so much guys i appreciate it"
"thank you so much thank you honor to"
"talk to you"
"likewise next time thank you bye-bye"
bye-bye
