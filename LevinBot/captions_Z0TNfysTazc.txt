"i think what you're doing is nobel"
"prize-winning work well thank you so"
"much that's very kind thank you i'm"
extremely
"very much looking forward to this thank"
"you when i was researching you about"
"every 10 minutes or so you would say"
this
"some offhand comment that would"
"floor me because of its consequences and"
"then you'd move on and then you'd say"
"what trumps what came before and this"
"happened over and over"
"so why don't you start with"
"what non-neural bioelectric states are"
"their relationship to anatomical results"
"and then later we can compare and"
"contrast to standard developmental"
"biology for decades which is it's the"
"genome that instructs constructs perhaps"
"what's epigenetic so we'll start with"
"what are bioelectric non-neural"
"bioelectric states and their"
"relationship to anatomical results"
"sure uh okay well"
"so so non-neural bioelectrical states"
"are simply the fact that all cells in"
"your body not just neurons have the same"
"machinery that's normally associated"
"with neural cells so ion channels"
"electrical synapses neurotransmitter"
"pathways all of these things are way"
"older than nervous systems and all every"
"cell in your body is creating an"
"electrical potential across its membrane"
"most cells in your body are"
"communicating those states to their"
"neighbors via these electrical synapses"
and
"on the one hand people are often"
"surprised to hear this on the other hand"
"if you ask yourself where did neurons"
"and brains come from they didn't just"
"spring up out of nowhere evolution"
basically
"uh speed optimized processes that were"
"already here around the time of"
"bacterial biofilms they're ancient these"
"things are ancient"
"and so"
uh
"if you if you just uh sort of track back"
"the phylogeny of of nervous systems and"
"neural cells you find out that all cells"
"have these and in fact we've had"
"discussions very lengthy discussions on"
"some of these basal cognition meetings"
"in terms of what is a neuron you know"
"people people will say well here are"
"neurons and i'll and i'll say by the way"
"what's a neuron and so they'll write on"
"the board four or five criteria for what"
"they think is a neuron and then they say"
"well every cell does this and so uh"
"there are a couple of there are a couple"
"of differences but but but most things"
"are fairly universal and so then the"
"question becomes we'll find what are"
"they used what is this used for so in"
"the brain what you have is a system"
"where an electrical network is"
"processing information to"
"direct muscles that move your body"
"through three-dimensional space that's"
"behavior nervous system control of"
behavior
in
"prior to that what these systems were"
"used for were to generate signals that"
"control cell behavior to move your body"
"configuration through anatomical space"
"that is the space of possible anatomical"
"configurations so i think um and i'm"
"working on some more stuff on this now"
"in terms of really broadening this this"
"idea but but i think what evolution did"
"was pivot some of the same tricks"
"across different spaces so electrical"
"uh electrical networks were used to"
"control to traverse"
"first in evolution probably first"
"metabolic spaces and then physiological"
"spaces and then transcriptional spaces"
"and amorphous spaces and eventually"
"three-dimensional space when mussels"
"came on the scene and animals could run"
"around and do things like that"
"but uh that's that's what electrical"
"networks used to think about before they"
"thought about behavior in"
"three-dimensional space they thought"
"about navigating other types of space"
"now how does this compare to the"
"standard view which is just it's our dna"
"that programs us the the the the"
"standard view is correct in the"
"following sense what the dna specifies"
"is the structure of the micro hardware"
"of your cells so the dna gives you the"
"protein level"
"uh sequence meaning the the structure of"
"the proteins that every cell has that's"
"the hardware so the dna the dna is what"
"specifies the hardware of the cells now"
"it turns out that that hardware is"
"awesome it's it's amazing in the"
"following way when you put that hardware"
"together it not only has specific uh"
"sort of default behaviors but it also"
"has lo it has computational capacity and"
"it's reprogrammable that that's that's"
"so that's actually one of the most"
"exciting parts about it but uh the the"
"the the the standard view is that"
"you should be able to"
"uh very directly go from what's in the"
"genome to"
"the anatomical structures and i i think"
"what that view is missing is a very"
"important middle layer that sits between"
"the hardware and then of the anatomy of"
"the the hardware of the genome rather"
"and the final outcome this the santa"
"these this anatomical homeostasis that"
"we see in regeneration and development"
"and so on and that layer is the software"
"it's the physiological software that"
"that uh that links those two things"
together
"can you tell me some of the experiments"
"that you've done take the audience"
"through a couple of the experiments so"
"one you amputate a frog's leg and then"
"you're able to regenerate it so on and"
"so on maybe outline three that you find"
"most flabbergasting"
"sure sure um okay uh let's see so so so"
"here's one"
"if you use a voltage-sensitive"
"fluorescent dye which basically just"
"reports you flood your your tissue with"
"it and it just reports"
"with with um different types of"
"fluorescence it reports where the"
"different voltage values are if you look"
"at the early embryo as it's putting its"
"face together for example you will see"
"something we call the electric face and"
"this was discovered in work with my"
"colleague danny adams where"
"we found this thing called the electric"
"face which is basically that prior to"
"all the genes being turned on that are"
"required to make different face"
"components and so on and certainly prior"
"to the anatomy there is a an electrical"
"pre pattern that you see in that region"
that
"basically looks like a face you can see"
"where the eyes are going to be because"
"that's where the voltage is different"
"you can see where the mouth is going to"
"be you can see where the placards on the"
"side of the head are going to be and so"
"you see this electrical face and it and"
"it raised the obvious uh the obvious"
"question which is that if that pattern"
"is instructive then you ought to be able"
"to do two things you ought to be able to"
"mess it up and thus disrupt that"
"electrical pattern and thus get defects"
"in craniofacial patterning and and"
"certainly you can do that and in fact"
"there are even human channelopathies"
"where humans have mutations and ion"
"channels that give them craniofacial"
"birth defects and defects of limb and"
"brain and other things so that"
"that so that's that's true but the other"
"thing the more exciting thing you might"
"be able to do"
"is to take some of those electrical"
"patterns and move them somewhere else"
"and you could say okay if if this is the"
"type of pattern that says to the cells"
"build an eye here"
"could we move that electrical state to"
"somewhere else not move the cells but"
"move the electrical pattern"
"reintroduce that electrical pattern"
"somewhere else and and get it to build"
"an ion so this is actually we we did"
"this this is some of our some of our"
"earlier work um you know around uh 2007"
"or so we we discovered this uh basically"
"you take one ion channel that's able to"
"induce a particular electrical pattern"
"in in the in a region of cells and you"
"inject rna encoding that ion channel in"
"some other part of the embryo that's"
"going to be gut let's say okay it's"
"going to make endoderms to make gut"
cells
"and sure enough uh and so and so three"
"things are significant about what"
"happens the first is that you get an i"
"then you get an i in the middle of the"
"gut you get an eye constructed from"
"cells that were going to be gut"
"so this is remarkable because if you"
"look at the um"
"developmental biology textbooks what you"
"will see is that they say that cells"
"outside of the anterior neuroderm are"
"not competent to become eyes they're not"
"supposed to be able to make eyes and"
"that's true if you use the the"
"biochemical master eye gene pac-6 if you"
"if you try to re-induce eyes with pac-6"
"that's true it doesn't form and it you"
"can't get ectopic eyes anywhere outside"
"the head but by introducing this"
"bioelectric pattern you can and so"
"that's so that's the first thing that"
"you you can you can"
"go beyond the known uh competency limits"
"by using this very upstream sort of"
"master regulator this this electrical"
"pattern the second thing that's"
"interesting about it is that"
"the information content that we provide"
"by putting in this channel is extremely"
"low we don't micro specify the details"
"of how to make an eye you know i has a"
"dozen cell types all arranged in a"
"particular way we don't know how to do"
"that we couldn't possibly do you know we"
"couldn't possibly do that in fact"
"what what we do instead is provide a"
"very simple signal"
"that to a programmer basically looks"
"like a subroutine call right it's a"
"trigger it's a trigger for a cascade"
"that the animal already knows how to do"
"it already knows how to make eyes we're"
"not saying how to make an eye what we're"
"saying is"
"make an eye here"
"but by triggering that that eye building"
"module which includes all the gene"
"expression everything else that's"
"downstream so that modularity that that"
"that incredible um engineering trick"
"that uh that that says that you can call"
"up once you know how to do something you"
"can reuse it"
"in other places the fact that these"
"bioelectrical states are triggers of"
"developmental subroutines okay so that's"
"that's kind of the second cool thing"
"about it the third cool thing about it"
"is that if you label the cells that you"
"are injecting the channel rna into with"
"some with us with a color so you can so"
"you can tell which cells actually got"
the
"the extra channel and then you and then"
"you look at that eye that you've created"
"what you will see is that often for"
"example half the eye"
"will have the channel you put in the"
"other half the eye doesn't have it that"
"means that what the cells that you"
"affected what they did was they"
"recruited their normal neighbors"
"right which by themselves were never"
"modified by you they were completely"
"wild-type and"
"and yet they got recruited by their"
"neighbors to be part of this thing so"
"there's two levels of instruction here"
"there's instruction by us saying to a"
"region you make an eye and then there's"
"a secondary instruction by those cells"
"that say oh and by the way i'm going to"
"need more cells hey you guys over here"
"you're going to be part of this lens and"
"they all come and they even the ones"
"that we never directly affected and so"
"this third part is cool because"
"well the the the second part is cool the"
"the fact that it's it's modular and a"
"trigger is cool because that means that"
"you can"
"achieve regenerative medicine outcomes"
"things that are way too complex for us"
"to micromanage by using triggers if we"
"can identify"
"the triggers of the subroutines that we"
"want make an eye make a layer make a"
liver
"then we can trigger those things long"
"before we actually know all the details"
"about how to micromanage it right so"
"part of part of reverse engineering and"
"i very much see this as a reverse"
"engineering task part of reverse"
"engineering is finding out all the cool"
"hooks in the system that are already"
"there for you not that you have to put"
"them together from scratch but they're"
"already there for you what is the"
"trigger that that's the build and i sub"
"routine what other subroutines are there"
"right that's that's that's part of our"
"job the other the thing that's cool"
"about that third part is that it's"
"non-cell autonomous meaning"
"you can exert effects on cells without"
"touching them directly because cells"
"communicate to each other so by"
convincing
"a bunch of cells over here that they"
"should make an eye you in effect uh"
"affect a bunch of other cells and cause"
"them to be part of that eye without"
"having to touch them directly and that"
"comes up"
"sorry that's what you meant when you"
"were talking about recruiting earlier"
"exactly exactly right exactly right yeah"
"so that's so that's kind of the first"
"that's the first example um that that i"
"would i would talk about the second"
"example i would talk about uh has to do"
"with has to do with cancer and so"
"michael is it okay if we hold on that"
"cancer result because what you said was"
"so profound and i want to unpack it okay"
"sure sure yeah we'll hold on tell me if"
"this is broadly correct let's imagine"
"i'm a frog where the frog is"
"developing before an eye or a stomach or"
"a throat or whatever it is is made you"
"see some ad abrasion some atomization"
"some electrical atomization like a hint"
"of it and then what you could do is you"
"can say well there's some pattern let's"
"imagine it's a circle to be simplistic"
"there's some circular voltage gradient"
"and that means i so what if i induce"
"that what if i induce a voltage gradient"
"over here near the heart i know you said"
"something but whatever over here"
"then what will happen"
"is instead ordinarily we would think"
"well you need to micro tune that eye"
"each molecule it's extremely difficult"
"to make an eye we don't actually know"
"how to from the bottom up molecularly"
"make an eye but we see this pattern what"
"if we put that pattern on the heart or"
"the stomach oh lo and behold some time"
"amount later then an eye is born is that"
"correct yeah that's that that's that's"
"correct and the only thing i would add"
"to that first of all is that the reason"
"i was i was telling you about that"
"electric face pattern is because it's"
"kind of the most obvious one in the"
"sense that the electric face pattern"
"actually looks like a face you can't"
"miss it it just it just looks like a"
"face but not all of them are that simple"
"some of them are really um"
"kind of uh um"
"they're encoded more deeply such that by"
"by staring at it you can't tell what"
"it's going to be right so so for example"
"there are there are other patterns that"
"we've seen where the only way we know"
"what they are is is by watching what"
"they make we you couldn't have guessed"
"you know so some some of them are very"
"direct almost a paint by numbers you can"
"sort of see what's going to happen and"
"others are really complicated and you"
need
"computational tools to deconvolve what"
"you're looking at to figure out what"
"it's going to be so so not all of them"
"are as obvious as as the electric face"
"pattern right yeah one of the questions"
"i had was why hasn't this been found out"
"before was there a technological limit"
"or did they just not look at cells with"
"the dye that give an indication of"
"voltage gradients or optogenetic"
"technologies and so on yeah so so that"
so
"so that's an interesting question why"
"why why not before i mean on the one"
"hand everything has to have a beginning"
"at some point right so so whenever it"
"was it would have you know you could"
"have asked well like why not before"
"right but hindsight is always obvious"
"you can always you can always say but"
"but let's but let's kind of dig into"
"that um on the one hand there was a"
"conceptual uh"
"leap that kept this pretty much under i"
"mean let's be clear i am not the first"
"person to talk about the importance of"
"bioelectric signals people have been"
"studying endogenous by electricity since"
"before 1900 so so it certainly has"
"occurred to people that maybe electrical"
"signals are important in development"
regeneration
"all of my work i was i was incredibly"
"heavily inspired"
"by by work that was done in this in the"
"60s 70s and 80s by a bunch of people"
"that worked really hard on this stuff"
"the reason that it hadn't gone far"
"enough was to two reasons number one"
"the tools weren't there so these dyes"
"didn't exist all they had was"
"traditional electrophysiology in"
"traditional electrophysiology you have"
"one electrode and you're poking it into"
"cells and if you want to have a picture"
"of what's going on you got to poke all"
"the cells and that's just completely"
"impractical right these dyes didn't"
"exist the conceptual thing was that"
"um around the time that this stuff was"
"was taking off using using electrodes"
"and things like that uh biochemistry and"
"molecular biology took off and the thing"
"that the reason molecular biology drew"
"all the attention is because you could"
"do molecular biology and biochemistry in"
"dead fixed tissue"
"so you can you can kill and fix your"
"cells and you can sequence the dna you"
"can sequence the rna you can get a"
"proteome you can get a uh you know all"
"of these all of these kinds of things"
"you can do"
"none of that is possible with"
"bioelectrics so the minute your cell is"
"dead all of it goes away"
"so none of the typical olmics approaches"
"work so it's it's it's uh it's it's that"
"much harder and so it really lagged"
"behind because all the interest went"
"into the molecular uh you know kind of"
"molecular biochemistry and uh and it had"
"to wait for some of these tools to to"
"come up the third thing the third thing"
"is is that"
"i think"
while
"while people did uh"
"think about uh the importance of these"
"bioelectric gradients"
"nobody to my knowledge uh"
"before we did it really thought about it"
as
"the beginnings of the nervous system and"
"to really put that computational spin on"
"it the fact that this thing really is"
"liking neural network doing computations"
"about development i i think that's new i"
"i will say um harold burr who was this"
"guy was working in the 30s 1930s 40s and"
"50s okay he had one of the first good"
"volt meters around and he went around"
"measuring things you know elm trees and"
"rabbits and tumors and embryos and all"
"kinds of stuff on the basis of this he"
"wrote an amazing book um"
"that basically said most of the things"
"that we're discovering now the guy had a"
"crystal ball it's incredible it's"
"absolutely incredible so he he could"
"clearly see a lot of this stuff the"
"thing the the one thing he did not see"
"because at the time it didn't exist was"
"the computational aspect and the and the"
"really the link to um you know to to to"
"this as as a kind of neuroscience done"
"in another space in amorphous space that"
"i think is is new but but uh"
"people had already had these ideas and"
"it needed the technology to really make"
"it to really prove them out and to"
"really see how it works"
"i'll be showing people some overlays of"
"some of the cells with the blue and"
"green and red voltage colors now voltage"
"is actually fairly abstract"
"for most people but what's not abstract"
"is something like an electron people can"
"fathom that that has a certain charge so"
"when someone is looking at these"
"videos of voltage gradients and they're"
"colored what is one seeing essentially"
"i'm asking you to explain what voltage"
"is simply but in terms of electrons in"
"terms of something that people can"
"understand yeah in order to understand"
"both you have to understand potential"
"and you also have to understand fields"
"technically if you want to understand"
"that correctly yeah um it's not so bad"
"you don't need to really do much with"
"fields in this one all because because"
"all of the things that i'm talking about"
"are really not fundamentally fields per"
"se they're just spatial distributions of"
"voltage gradients and and to understand"
"a voltage gradient it's it's pretty"
"simple instead of electrons life i mean"
"life uses electrons too but mostly the"
"kinds of stuff that we're talking about"
"uses a different charged particle they"
use
"potassium chloride sodium and protons"
"okay but otherwise same same deal and so"
"any cell has a cell membrane around it"
"the outer surface and it has these ion"
"channels which are these little portals"
"these little proteins that can open and"
"close and let specific ions like"
"potassium or sodium in and out these"
"potassium so potassium and sodium are"
"both positively charged so you can"
"imagine that"
"if you if you're a cell and you let a"
"bunch of your positively charged"
"potassiums out you can have an imbalance"
"more positives out here less positives"
"inside so now there's going to be a"
"voltage gradient basically a battery in"
"effect i mean that's basically what a"
"battery is right it's a it's a membrane"
"with a with a charged disk balance on"
"across it that's that's all this is so"
"every cell is a battery it achieves that"
"by using energy to pump ions in a"
"particular direction and as a result you"
"if you were to take a tiny little volt"
"meter and put it across and people"
"that's exactly what electrophysiologists"
"do you put it across that cell membrane"
"you're going to read a voltage of some"
"sort you know it's usually somewhere"
"between i don't know between 20"
"millivolts and and"
"70 millivolts something like that right"
"that's all it is and so now you imagine"
"doing that for every cell in the tissue"
"that you're looking at"
"and you're just going to color every"
"cell depending on how big that voltage"
"difference is it's you're going to color"
"it red if the voltage difference is"
"quite small that's called being"
"depolarized meaning there's just not"
"that much imbalance it's pretty much"
"it's quite simple you know the ions"
"inside and outside are pretty similar so"
"you're going to color those red and then"
"the ones that are really different where"
"there's a ton of"
"positive charges that have been kicked"
"out so the cell is really pretty"
"negative that compared to the outside"
"space that you're going to color those"
"you're going to color those blue"
"and that's and that's what and that's"
"what you're looking at"
"great okay so now we have some"
"background as to what"
"so dna calls for proteins and you can"
"think of that as low level and then what"
"you're discovering and you and your"
"teams and the teams that you collaborate"
"with are discovering is that there's"
"these non-neural bioelectric signals and"
"those are somewhat like large-scale code"
"some of the implications are"
"regeneration of limbs barely touched on"
"that's okay we touched on generation of"
"actual so generation of eyes not"
"regeneration of eyes and then you were"
"about to get into cancer so do you mind"
"yeah um"
"so so"
"so the just just real quick to say the"
"analogy is that i i think a good analogy"
"is this the dna is what encodes the"
hardware
"okay and the electrical dynamics are the"
"software now a lot of people get upset"
"at this because they say ah living"
"things are not like a computer so i am"
"certainly not claiming that living"
"things are like the kind of computers"
"that you and i use on a daily basis"
"these right this architecture is not"
"what life is using however the deeper"
"concept from computer science which is"
"the idea of reprogrammable hardware and"
"the idea of software multi-layer"
"software where you could be programming"
"at the in the in machine code or you"
"could be looking for higher level"
"subroutines and higher level"
"languages that i think is quite quite"
"realistic and i think what we're looking"
"for here is to understand basically to"
"to to find the"
"the best"
um
"the best representation of that software"
"so that we can manipulate it as uh as as"
"you know to to advantage basically and"
"and to understand how evolution"
"manipulates it and so and so the other"
"you know you had asked for three"
"examples so so there are three basic"
"examples i wanted to give so so the"
"electric face was one there's a cancer"
"example and then there's a planarian uh"
"flatworm regeneration example so the"
"cancer the cancer example would look"
"like this um"
"one of the things about"
"cancer the the the one way to think"
"about cancer is to ask the question"
"why is there ever anything but cancer in"
"other words"
"individual cells like amoebas are"
"extremely competent on their own they"
"handle single cell level goals quite"
"well why do they ever get together to"
"form something like a kidney or a liver"
"because when you have when when there's"
"a cancer what you're seeing is a"
"defection from that process you're"
"seeing cells that normally should be"
"working on making a nice organ in store"
"up keeping a nice organ in an adult"
"instead of that they go off and they"
"basically revert to a single cell kind"
"of existence they they"
"basically become like an amoeba they"
"treat the rest of the body as just"
"environment it's like external"
"environment so you can think of that"
"that computational boundary between"
"between self and world can shrink it can"
"grow when a bunch of amoebas a bunch of"
"amoeba-like cells get together and they"
"build something like an organ or a whole"
"body that that computational boundary"
"grows but can also shrink because an"
"individual cell can say uh uh i'm i'm"
"not working on this anymore i'm just an"
"amoeba and i'm gonna do what amoebas do"
"what do they do they they become two"
"amoebas and two amoebas become four and"
"so on they over proliferate and they go"
"where life is good so they metastasize"
"to wherever they wherever they want to"
"go so that's so that's cancer so"
"so if you think about it that way that"
"that cancer is this is this like"
"defection from multicellular cooperation"
"you can you ask yourself okay so what is"
"the process that normally keeps them"
"harnessed towards specific goals and"
"and so if you ask yourself what what"
"what what do we know that's a process"
"that harnesses individual competent"
"subunits towards larger scale goals"
"that's very clear that's that's uh the"
"neural like processing because you have"
"individual neurons which are cells"
"but you connect them together into a"
"network and this amazing computation"
"starts to take place that can do things"
"like plan for the future and have"
"memories and have preferences and goals"
"on a large scale you know you as an"
"organism can have goals and memories"
"that your individual cells don't have so"
"so we know that electrical networks are"
"really good at binding"
"small competent subunits into larger"
"scale computational agents we do we we"
"take advantage of that in computer"
"science we take it evolution takes"
"advantage of it in in making neurons"
"so um so we asked the following question"
"okay could that be the basis of cancer"
"and now i must say that of course we're"
"not the first to have this idea okay"
"again harold burr um had this said this"
"in the 30s"
"but so we did we did three things we"
"said okay first of all when this process"
"happens can you see using the voltage"
"dyes can you see the cells defecting"
"from the electrical network and in fact"
"that's then in fact you can so what you"
"can what you can do is you before it"
"happens so so you can inject a human"
"oncogene which is going to form a tumor"
"in a tadpole you inject that into"
um
"you inject that into a uh"
"into a tadpole they make a um"
"they make a they make a you know it"
"makes a tumor and even before that tumor"
"becomes uh becomes apparent you can"
"uh you can see with a voltage die you"
"can see that those cells become become"
"highly depolarized they electrically"
"uncouple from the rest of the tissue and"
"they go on their way and they just treat"
"to them the rest of the animal is just"
"external environment at that point so"
"they become electrically uncoupled and"
"that's that's the first thing that that"
"oncogenes do is electrically isolate the"
"cell from its neighbors from that"
"collection of of signals that normally"
"tell the cell what to do in a larger"
"context so that's the first thing we did"
"the second thing we did we said well"
"if that if that's a potential cause of"
cancer
"could we"
"uh could we could we cause cancer"
"but just by disrupting the electrical"
"communication directly no no oncogenes"
"no carcinogens no dna damage no"
"mutations nothing wrong with the cells"
"that any molecular biology test could"
see
"and could we could we cause cancer"
"because because remember the standard"
"model in the field for years has been"
"that cancer is the cause of genetic"
"damage basically right that it's that"
"it's a genetic disruption that makes a"
"rogue cell that has other mutations and"
"so on so we said fine no we're going to"
"take completely normal cells nothing"
"wrong with them and we're going to"
"simply prevent them from talking to"
"other cells electrically okay we're just"
"going to manipulate that and so we did"
"that and sure enough we made metastatic"
"metastatic melanoma in tadpoles so so"
"that tells you that you there doesn't"
"have to be anything wrong with the"
"hardware in order to have cancer it can"
"be a purely physiological phenomenon it"
"can be caused at the software level"
"which a lot of people who study"
"stress-induced cancers and things like"
"this they kind of already knew but but"
"but really the paradigm has been that"
"there has to be a genetic defect at the"
"at the root of this somewhere okay and"
"then the third thing we found which is"
"of course the most exciting thing"
"which is you can go in the opposite"
"direction you can you can inject a"
"really powerful human occaging like a"
"p53 mutation oncogene for those who are"
"listening it's just a gene that causes"
"cancer yeah an oncogene is a is a is a"
"mutation in a in the normal gene that"
"causes that that are that is that is"
"thought to cause uh cancer"
"transformation to cancer yeah okay so"
"you can inject that and then if you do"
"that into into a tadpole"
"if you at the same time inject an ion"
"channel that"
"forces the cell to remain in an"
"electrical state where it's connected to"
"its neighbors and it doesn't depolarize"
"then even though that oncogene is"
"blazingly strongly expressed there's no"
"there you you won't you won't have a you"
"won't have a tumor because you're"
"overriding that there's a hardware"
"problem but it doesn't matter because"
"you're overriding it and saying yeah i"
"know you want to depolarize but you"
"can't you have to stay connected to"
"these neighbors and you're just going to"
"be part of this and and and we can"
"override that way a variety of different"
"different types of oncogenes"
"okay so i was just having an analogy in"
"my head it's almost like imagine you"
"have these kids and they're misbehaved"
"so you can say well it's the kids who"
"are the problem and they cause havoc in"
"the house but if you have an adult who's"
"stern enough they can override the"
"misbehaved kids if you leave the kids"
"without the adult and the hustle bean"
"shambles in this analogy the adult is"
"like the electrical communication so you"
"can force that electrical communication"
"that standard adaptive electrical"
communication
"yeah yeah you can you can think of it"
"that way i mean the the the thing where"
"i think it it it breaks down a little"
"bit is that is that you we're not"
"introducing an extra element that keeps"
"everybody else in line right we're we're"
"in effect it's like um"
"you know it's like it's like it's like"
"you have a bunch of kids that know what"
"to do and you've got one that's wearing"
"uh you know dark glasses and you can't"
"see and he's causing all kinds of"
"trouble because you can't see what he's"
"doing well you can you can sort of you"
"could put a camera on him or take the"
"glasses off or something so that he just"
"goes right back into the into the"
"interactions with with the you know in"
"the in the with the rest of the uh"
"you know the rest of the group it's"
"about it's about communication it's"
about
"uh binding the individual competent"
"subunits towards a larger goal your goal"
"is not simply to grow as much as you can"
"the way an amoeba is your goal is to"
"build a hand or a liver or an eye or"
"something else it's really about the"
"scale up of goals and electrical"
"networks are great for this"
"does your work have any implications for"
"what it means to have an identity so"
"right now you were talking about cancer"
"as if it's dissociating from the larger"
"cells yeah and then there are gap"
"junctions which you've referenced in"
"your other work and they effectively"
"make an equivalence class between"
"signals that i generate as a cell or my"
"environment or signals from connected"
"cells i'm unable to tell the difference"
"between them yep"
"because i'm unable to tell the"
"difference between myself and my"
"neighbor it's as if i'm identified with"
"them so it has plenty of bearing at"
"least i see it has plenty of bearings"
"for what it means for the eye or the ego"
"in a non-pejorative manner"
"so what are the implications of your"
"work for the concept of identity"
"yeah yeah no you you put your finger"
"exactly on it so so so two two years ago"
"i wrote this paper called on the"
"boundary of the self and it's exactly"
"this idea it's the way to to uh to"
"define what is a self at different"
"scales and uh how does the boundary the"
"size of that self change okay or over"
"time and that's exactly the kind of"
"thing that you that you're talking about"
"it's having having communication"
"channels that partially wipe the"
"metadata on information so that i no"
"longer know whether it came from you or"
"or whether it came from me right gives"
"us a partial mind melt because now it's"
"really hard to keep an identity if i"
"can't tell which are my memories and"
"which are your memories it's really hard"
"for us to keep uh to keep distinct"
"identities we become partially unified"
"and that's that's exactly the sort of"
"process that evolution exploits to build"
"larger cells out of um small competent"
ones
"another astounding experiment of yours"
"i'm not sure if i should be calling it"
"an experiment was where you took skin"
"cells of a frog and then it has"
"locomotion can you outline what the heck"
"did you do there and why is that"
important
"yeah yeah no it's definitely an"
"experiment um"
"so so you're talking about our zenobots"
"uh i think and"
"the question was that the question that"
"we're interested in addressing is is"
"basically this um"
"where do anatomical goals come from and"
"in order to illustrate why that's even a"
"good question i want to talk about"
"plenaria for just a moment and then and"
"then you'll see why this this is"
"important for the xenobots"
um
"we are we are used to the fact that"
"uh each species has a specific shape"
"that is associated with it and that frog"
"eggs make frogs and and zebra fish eggs"
"make zebrafish and so on so we're kind"
"of we're kind of used to that but"
"the actual question of how do cellular"
"collectives decide what they're going to"
"build and when do they stop building"
"that's very much an open question"
"and so so one way you can see how how"
"far we are away from a good"
"understanding of this is in in a very"
"simple um very simple experiment"
uh
"there are there are around so so"
"planaria are these flat worms that"
"regenerate when you cut them into pieces"
"every piece builds whatever's missing"
"and they regenerate okay that's that's"
"plenary you can cut them into pieces and"
"they every piece regenerates to a normal"
"plenary so there are species of planaria"
"that have round heads and those type"
"those cells are really good at building"
"a round head and then stopping so they"
"stop when a round head is complete okay"
"then you got another species of plenaria"
"that has a very pointy head a truck kind"
"of a triangular head and those cells are"
"very good at point at making a"
"triangular head when you cut it off it"
"makes a triangular head and then it"
"stops so i have a simple question if i"
"take a bunch of the cells from the"
"round-headed guy and i stick them into"
"the body of the triangular guy and i let"
"them sort of get you know get"
"comfortable and sit around for a little"
"while then i cut the head off what head"
"shape are we going to have are we going"
"to have is one of the head shapes"
"dominant to the other are we going to"
"have an intermediate shape or are we"
"going to have a planarian that never"
"stops regenerating because neither set"
"of cells is ever happy about the shape"
"they're never that stop condition is"
"never said okay so now so now look the"
"the important thing is not the answer"
"the the important thing is"
"despite all of the"
"uh papers in nature and science about"
"the molecular pathways of control of"
"stem cells and planaria and all these"
"kinds of high resolution transcriptomics"
"and all this stuff there is not a single"
"model in the field that makes a"
"prediction on this experiment"
"why because every piece of data out"
"there now addresses the hardware that"
"enables individual cells to do cell"
"things fine"
"but we have no understanding of what"
"happens when the cells join together"
"into a larger scale self that makes"
"large scale decisions about head shape"
"head number things like that in"
"morphospace that navigates morph space"
"by making these large scale decisions we"
"have absolutely no idea how those"
"algorithms work and the fact that we"
"know how the stem cells work and have"
"lots of molecular biology about that"
"really hasn't affected this other"
"question much at all we we just have no"
"no models for this because it's too"
"computationally complex or some other in"
"principle reason i don't think it's well"
"no i don't think it's because it's too"
"complex although it is too complex to"
"calculate out directly i think it's"
"because conceptually we haven't found"
"the right"
"uh we haven't found the right way to"
"think about how cellular collectives"
"make decisions this is this is a"
"collective intelligence problem this is"
"not a molecular biology problem we've"
"been thinking about this as a molecular"
"biology problem that's not what this is"
"this is this is trying to read the mind"
"of a collective intelligence now people"
"think of collective intelligences as"
"exotic things like anthills and and you"
"know bb colonies and things like this"
"these are collective intelligences"
"um i want to remind everybody that we"
"are all collective intelligences we are"
"all bags of cells"
"no there is no cognitive agent that is"
"like this"
"single diamond that's that's not made of"
"parts that's sort of unchanging we're"
"all made of parts any cognitive agent is"
"made of parts and so your goal is to ask"
"how do those parts bind together to make"
"decisions as a collective individual"
"cells don't know what a head is they"
"don't know what round round means they"
"don't know what triangular means right"
"but the collective sure does and so the"
"collective is able to navigate morph of"
"space in this way that we don't"
"understand the algorithm so if we don't"
"even we don't even know how to um how to"
"think about this okay so"
"um so so so this this is very isomorphic"
"to problems in neuroscience to problems"
"in in artificial intelligence it's uh"
"trying to understand the scaling of of"
"minds and in in trying to do that we we"
"pose the following problem"
"okay standard"
"tadpoles make you know standard frog"
"eggs make it make frog embryos and"
"everybody's kind of used to that even"
"even though you know you can remind i"
"always remind my students did you"
"realize that that if i gave you the frog"
"genome you couldn't tell me what a frog"
"looked like right"
"you could compare it to other genomes"
"yeah you didn't know what but that was"
"that's cheating you know"
"so so so okay so we asked we asked a"
"simple question"
"where does the goal of making a frog or"
"tadpole really come from and how"
"hardwired is that so what we did was we"
"took some skin"
"that we scraped off of an early frog"
"embryo we set it aside in a different"
"environment and we said okay now you're"
"free to sort of reboot your"
"multicellularity you're here we've we've"
"we've relieved all of the constraints of"
"the rest of the embryo you're no longer"
"getting constructive signals from from"
"from endoderm and from mesoderm from all"
"these other things you're no longer"
"subject to all these other signals"
"what are you going to do what"
"what's what's your new what you know"
"what what do you want to do and there's"
"a couple of"
"different options that could have"
"happened the cells could have"
"died they could have wandered off and"
"and sort of when each cell go its own"
"way they could have made a monolayer of"
"cells in a dish the way you get in cell"
"culture all kinds of things they could"
"have done they didn't do any of that"
"what they did instead was to combine"
"together and to form a little ball"
"that grew cilia these little motile"
"hairs on the outer surface"
now
"cilia are normally sitting on the"
"outside of embryos and they're there to"
"kind of redistribute the mucus around"
"and to you know make the pathogens sort"
"of keep moving and not stick to the skin"
"they're used to they're used to um"
"keep the surface of the of the tadpole"
clean
"uh but instead these cells basically"
"repurposed that genetically encoded"
"hardware the cilia themselves are"
"genetically encoded all the proteins"
"necessary to make a psyllium are in the"
"genome and they so so they have that"
"already but what they did was they"
"assembled themselves into a new um"
"into a new kind of uh a new kind of"
"architecture this this this spherical"
"thing which and and then and then they"
"use the cilia to propel themselves so"
"they started running around they started"
"moving around and so we have these"
"amazing videos of them moving around"
"singly moving around in groups"
"interacting we're going through a maze"
"going back and forth in various"
"configurations they have all kinds of"
"behaviors they have all kinds they can"
"regenerate if you if you cut them"
"almost entirely in half they will like"
"join back and and and make a"
"you know make a uh uh"
"make a make a zenobot again"
and
"the the the and and so and so the"
"coolest thing about them is and by the"
"way we don't know their cognitive"
"capacities yet okay we don't we we're"
"only beginning now to start to see can"
"they learn can they do they have"
"preferences all these kinds of things we"
"don't know yet but the coolest thing"
"about them is that to my knowledge"
"they're the only"
"creature on the planet that doesn't"
"really have"
"an evolutionary backstory the individual"
"cells do okay the cells have a long"
"evolutionary history on earth"
"but they were selected for that genome"
"was selected for the ability of these"
"cells to sit quietly on the outside of"
"the frog and keep out the pathogens they"
"were not selected specifically to be"
"able to get together and run around in a"
"separate in a separate configuration"
"away from the embryo where did that all"
"come from and in fact one of the one of"
"the things about it is people people"
"often say well you know when are you"
"going to buy when you're going to"
"engineer these things you know knock in"
"various synthetic biology circuits right"
"make them do things and we absolutely"
"will do that but my goal before we do"
"any of that my goal was to show people"
"what what can happen while the diversity"
"that can happen from the exact same"
"genome with no manipulations whatsoever"
"because if you because the thing about"
"these cinnabots is they just have a"
"normal frog genome they have no other"
"they have no transgenes no genomic"
"editing there's nothing different about"
"them there what we're seeing is the"
"plasticity of"
"of this collective intelligence that is"
"able to make a new functional"
"proto-organism in a novel way out of the"
"exact same parts"
"so there's no genomic editing there did"
"you manipulate its morphogenetic code"
"the electrical signals at all not yet no"
"we're going to we're certainly going to"
"that's all to come no at this point we"
"haven't done that this is this is this"
"is purely native plasticity this is what"
"these cells already know how to do we we"
"we scrape them we scrape them off of the"
"frog and we put them in little holes the"
"little little sort of depressions"
and
"i should back up there are two types of"
"cinnabots okay the one i'm describing"
"now we literally did almost nothing you"
"scrape them off the embryo you set them"
"aside and you say fine now liberated"
"from all the signals that would have"
"turned you into uh various uh various"
"things what do you want to do and this"
"is what they do on their own"
"there's another type of zen about which"
"is actually the one we started with"
"where we sculpted them a little bit we"
um
"and this is by the way this is all work"
"done in in collaboration with uh with"
"bongard lab at university of vermont and"
"sam kriegman did did all the"
"computational model modeling for this"
"and then um"
"doug blackiston did the uh did all the"
"all the microsurgery and everything we"
"we sculpted them a bit to give them legs"
"so you basically just it's subtractive"
"like subtractive sculpting you just cut"
"away some stuff so that you're you're"
"left with kind of an ottoman that has"
"like four or four legs you know and uh"
"and and we and and we put in a little"
"bit of a little bit of of muscle and"
"then it learned to walk so so the muscle"
"would contract and the thing would"
"basically walk along that's that's the"
"first set of xenobots we made the second"
"one has no muscle it has no nerve it"
"only it's only skin and those can get"
"around perfectly well on their own using"
"these cilia and their our interventions"
"are extremely minimal"
"it's important that it was taken off of"
"embryos or it doesn't matter if you took"
"it off of a frog much later in"
development
um
"we haven't we haven't taken it off a"
"frog later in development but we we have"
"we have other evidence that i can't"
"really talk about yet that uh suggests"
"that it doesn't matter that it's a frog"
"and it doesn't matter that it's an"
"embryo we have we have we we have data"
"on adult cells now"
"what occurs to me is"
"i'm wondering"
"if this has implications for what it"
"means to be"
"alive in the colloquial sense so forget"
"about in the biological sense so we"
"think of our skin as dead and our bones"
"are dead and perhaps dead isn't the"
"right term but let's say animated"
"animated with life with vim with brielle"
"yet you showed that somehow you can"
"still trigger vim and brio"
"not via this electrical manipulation i"
"thought it was that but does this have"
"any bearing as to what we consider to be"
"alive or it's a dif or it's a are"
unrelated
"um i'll tell you that uh one of the"
"things that this kind of work does is"
"really illustrate the"
"insufficiency of our vocabulary so"
"people often argue for example i mean"
"alive is a funny thing i don't i don't"
"actually know what alive really i don't"
"have a good definition the these cells"
"and these organisms are for sure alive"
"in the traditional sense i mean the the"
"cells are alive there's no there's no"
"getting around that but but but people"
"will often argue for example are they"
"robots are they organisms are they uh"
"you know these are they machines these"
"kinds of things and and and we we josh"
"bongard and i wrote a paper addressing"
"this question basically pointing out"
that
"though that terminology is almost"
"useless now it was it was great 50 years"
"ago when you could"
"you when when it was really easy to tell"
"apart machines that were that were that"
"were boring predictable they were they"
were
"designed right and living things which"
"were surprising and interesting and warm"
"and wet and um and evolved those things"
"are now so intermixed"
"that with modern with modern techniques"
"of digital evolution and bioengineering"
"and synthetic morphology that"
"distinction does not exist anymore and"
"so it used to be that you can sort of"
"like you could knock on something and if"
"you hear a hollow metallic sound and you"
"say ah yeah that that came off a factory"
"that's a machine and i'm you know"
"morally um uh okay with taking it apart"
"and doing whatever i want with it and if"
"you were to do this and and it was sort"
"of so soft and squishy then you would"
"say that's evolved and it's living and i"
"better i better be nice to it that right"
"though that easy distinction is just"
"that doesn't exist anymore so we need we"
"need a better vocabulary i mean they're"
"they're alive for sure but if you want"
"to ask questions about whether they are"
"machines or robots or living organisms"
"or that that all that stretches the"
"vocabulary which is no longer up to the"
task
"is there a relationship between"
"perception and this morphogenetic code"
"and i know i keep using that word"
"morphogenetic code and yeah forgive me"
"if i'm abusing the terminology but is"
"there a relationship between perception"
"and morphogenetic code i'll give you my"
"reasoning behind it right now what i see"
"is i recognize a monitor i see a"
"microphone i see you you have eyebrows i"
"see large scale structures then the"
"question is well is there anything"
"special about your eyebrows"
well
"other than you're an attractive man"
"let's say"
"physically speaking physics would say"
"there's nothing special about this"
"microphone or 10 percent of the"
"microphone or 10 of the microphone plus"
"the air slightly around it it's more a"
"pragmatic matter"
"that it's a practical that it matters"
"that i can use this"
"however when you're talking about this"
"non-neural bioelectric code it's as if"
"these large-scale structures that we"
"recognize as salient and significant"
"such as a low resolution facet like a"
"child's drawings of eyebrows nose head"
"placement and so on that those are there"
"in the code so somehow what we perceive"
"is also what is encoded"
"and i'm curious well is that is there a"
"confounding factor that influences both"
"does the morphogenetic code influence"
"our perceptions"
"perhaps i can give a better analogy if i"
"a computer science analogy where we have"
"machine code and then you have like"
"what builds a top that builds the top"
"library is jquery and on html5 and so on"
"so we have a function bounce which takes"
"an image and bounces it or texts and"
"bounces it or one that plays mpeg so the"
"question is well what makes bounce"
"or mpeg playing more fundamental well to"
"me i would say nothing it's us it's what"
"we use however it's strange that"
"objectively there's this code for it"
"yeah yeah um well there's a there's a"
"lot there and what you just said uh"
"certainly um perception is a part of"
"this whole process because in order to"
"have this kind of um"
"anatomical homeostasis where"
"you you uh you you you you damage in you"
"know an organism like a salamander which"
"can regenerate most of its organs or a"
"planarian which can regenerate all of"
"its organs you you damage it and then it"
"grows with the right thing and then it"
"stops when it's done that loop that"
"homeostatic loop has to have a"
"perception component because it has to"
"be able to recognize when it's done so"
"it has to be able to perceive am i a"
"correct planarian or not and if i'm not"
"i'm going to keep remodeling until i am"
"and at that point so it's an error"
"minimization scheme and in order to"
"achieve that error minimization you have"
"to be able to perceive around you in"
"anatomical space and to say am i in the"
"right region of space here is my head"
"and the right size is do do i have the"
"right number of eyes um all of that"
"you need to perceive that and people um"
"people like grossberg uh and uh at bu"
"had written years ago about the"
"relationship between retinal information"
"processing and development and i"
"actually think he was he was really on"
"to something in the sense that i think"
"most epithelia are basically like a big"
"retina and that what they're doing is"
"they're they're they're constantly"
"surveilling the rest of the animal"
"or the rest of the body"
"and making decisions about large-scale"
"features so not just individual pixels"
"but things like in the in the retina"
"you'd be talking about edge detection"
motion
"things like that and that's what they're"
"doing they're looking at large scale"
"features that individual cells cannot"
"detect so"
"one way to look at this is that we have"
"a precedent for this from neuroscience"
"and from visual from the science of"
"visual processing the probably the more"
"accurate way to look at it is yeah that"
"guess where the retina learned its"
"tricks right and guess where where"
"brains learn their visual processing"
"tricks by far more ancient mechanisms of"
"cellular groups navigating morphospace"
"that that's that's what it used to be"
"before it became the before it became"
"vision basically"
"do you believe that the problem of"
"senescence to the degree can be called a"
"problem is largely a disruption of"
"this electrical blueprint rather than"
"oxidative stress and damage to dna and"
"so on that or telomeric length that"
"people think"
"um i don't have any evidence yet that"
"there's a bioelectric component to this"
"i mean i suspect there is but but we"
"don't have any evidence on it we haven't"
"really worked on aging per se"
"i will say that i don't think it's"
"anything as fundamental as"
"uh this kind of like thermodynamic decay"
"or anything like that because the"
"planaria are immortal they don't have a"
"a life span limit they live forever and"
"so they are telling us that it's"
"possible to be a complex regenerative"
"organism with uh learning capacity and"
"so on and not age so so so it's clearly"
"possible so so the rest is details right"
"the rest is i i don't think it's"
"anything as fundamental as"
"the the the theories that say well look"
"when you copy things you inevitably make"
"mistakes so eventually stuff whereas it"
"wears out if that were true"
"you wouldn't have plenary so so i don't"
"think i don't think it's anything like"
"that i think it's something much more"
"contingent much more specific uh and and"
"thus i i'm optimistic that we can"
"overcome it so there's some work you're"
"outlining in a previous talk with uh as"
"i think it was a couple years ago at the"
"time it was an undergraduate her name"
"was maya though i don't recall her last"
"name and she changed between three types"
"of planaria head"
like
"i think it was felina mediterranean doro"
"i don't recall how to pronounce it but"
"there were about tens of millions of"
"years apart evolutionarily and that to"
me
"implies that there"
"perhaps our structures that are"
"unfathomably submerged in us from our"
past
"and then i'm"
"curious if there's a relationship"
"between that"
"between these"
"let's say these electric blueprints even"
"though so whatever these electric"
"blueprints and union archetypes to go"
"off on a huge speculative jump is the"
"relationship between them"
"boy uh that's that's"
"that's a good that's a great question um"
"i think that uh"
"if if one were to"
if
"let's run it backwards let's say let's"
"say that"
"we underst we we have a conception of"
"jungian archetypes for"
"neuroscience and psychology"
"and now somebody could say yeah but"
"you're saying that all of all of you"
"know you know neuro neuro psychology"
"comes from earlier"
"somatic bioelectrics what would the"
"jungian what would that look like then"
"in that right in in that case what would"
"the jungian archetypes look like in this"
"other pre-neural"
"type of of bioelectrics because we do"
"this all the time we we ask things like"
"what does memory look like before it was"
"brain memory what does"
"bistable visual illusions look like"
"before they were before there were"
"brains all of these things that we see"
"in neuroscience you can ask what the"
"what the older somatic equivalent look"
"like so you can do the same thing here"
"it's an interesting question i've never"
"thought about it that way but you can"
"you can ask that question if you ask"
"that question you get to exactly the"
"kind of thing you're talking about and"
"what i would say is well probably in"
"morphospace there are these stable"
"attractors corresponding to different"
"types of shapes of heads different"
"numbers of eyes different planaria body"
"plans different all different kinds of"
"things and what you can do is you can"
"dial in those different"
"uh stable attractors by by in in the"
"state space of the electric circuit by"
"by shifting that electric circuit state"
"so uh yeah i think i think that's a fair"
"i think that's a that's that's a totally"
"fair way to think about it"
"your work is so"
"it's like to me it's like the discovery"
"of dna"
"and maybe you're too modest to accept"
"that as a compliment but i see it as"
"as that seminal and i wanna well"
"i'm gonna put this out there i'm gonna"
"say in the beginning i think this guy's"
"gonna win a nobel prize"
"he has not said that like this is not"
"him saying that i'm saying that well"
"thank you so much yeah that's that's"
"that's very kind um there are lots of"
"people i mean i i think it's important"
"to say that uh"
"yeah it's not none of my friend right"
"now well it's on on two levels so so so"
"first of all none of this uh came out of"
"thin air i didn't think of any of this"
"stuff just you know from nothing i i i i"
"built this these ideas uh on on on many"
"other ideas of of really uh kind of uh"
"really pioneering folks that work for"
"years and many of them um didn't really"
"get uh you know didn't get a lot of uh"
"acceptance from the community so that's"
"that's important to say is that is that"
"there's a lot of that out there and uh"
"and of course the people in our lab"
"right the the postdocs and and and for"
"phd students and techs who do the work i"
"mean it's certainly not not just me"
"doing all this work there are a lot of"
"people in this field and a lot of people"
"in my group so um lots of people um"
"contribute to push this all forward"
"we'll get to the audience questions"
"okay so this one comes from rupert"
sheldrake
"how does he think"
"how does he think his conception of"
"morphogenetic fields relates to mine"
"referring to rupert"
"yeah uh interesting question um"
so
"basically our morphogenetic fields that"
"we work on"
"uh are completely physical in other"
"words they take place entirely within"
"the body of the organism they're"
"generated by the cells we can measure"
"them using"
"current technology"
"i don't know if that's true of the kinds"
"of things that rupert is talking about"
"i kind of suspect that those would have"
"to have quite a bit different properties"
"but just to be clear our fields are"
"uh and in fact in fact the things that"
"we deal with are strictly speaking not"
"even fields right so so we work with"
"spatial distributions of resting"
"potentials so it's not clear to me that"
"these are really fields in the"
"mathematical sense of of the word field"
"but these are distributions of"
"electrical potentials of living cells in"
"in a particular body so they are"
"they're they're very physical they're"
"local they're you know kind of quite"
"quite traditional distributions of"
voltage
"another application that i've heard you"
"mentioned though it was i don't know if"
"it was more on the speculative side or"
"if you've developed this"
"it was some organism of the potential of"
"creating some organism that"
"spontaneously and temperamentally goes"
"out and cleans up the environment it's"
"engineered to remove certain toxins"
"can you speak more about that"
"yeah that's probably was referring to"
"our zenobots so we have this uh"
"this technology where we're we're"
"creating synthetic living"
"proto-organisms made in this in this"
"case made of frog skin so these are frog"
"skin cells that in different"
"environments self-organized to be these"
"these little motile creatures"
"and at least one of many possible"
"applications in the future is to program"
"them for some sort of collection"
"tasks so that they would go out and"
"maybe collect"
"useful useful molecules or maybe they"
"would clean up toxins maybe they would"
"detect various various other chemicals"
"in the environment that you would want"
"to know about so these are all potential"
"uh applications of of the practical sort"
"of use of these kinds of synthetic"
"living machines"
"you mentioned quite a few times that"
"it's important when you're dealing with"
"the manipulation of this electric"
"field or voltage gradient that you don't"
"use external electric fields you"
"actually manipulate the cellular ion"
"channels directly yeah okay so then i"
"was wondering does this mean you know"
"how some people say 5g"
"that we should be scared of 5g because"
"well for various reasons"
"but then other people say it's"
"non-ionizings and that's and that's all"
"that matters well is that all that"
"matters is there some validity to being"
"concerned about 5g"
"um so so i think i think both of those"
"viewpoints are a little bit off and the"
"truth is somewhere in the middle so so"
"let's let's just start with the ionizing"
"business so so i i think the evidence is"
"quite clear that electromagnetic"
"radiation does not need to be ionizing"
"and in fact it is not to be particularly"
"strong in order to in some way affect"
"living cells so living things so living"
"things are sensitive to all sorts of"
"electromagnetic radiation uh in many"
"ways that do not require ionization or"
"heat or anything like that at the same"
time
"i think i don't have any reason to be"
"concerned about 5g first of all the"
"kinds of things that we study so these"
"bioelectric signaling"
"pathways are not particularly affected"
"by external electromagnetic fields if"
"they were we would be using these kinds"
"of things in the lab to manipulate the"
electrical
"the electrical signaling it's just not"
"it's not a great way to control"
bioelectric
"signaling within tissue it's it just"
"doesn't do a very good job of it so i"
"don't have any particular reason to be"
"worried about 5g i have a feeling that"
"uh for most people that are worried"
"about it you have far bigger dangers and"
"stressors in your life you know uh if"
"you eat certain things if you uh engage"
"in certain behaviors"
"this is far more of an issue for you"
"statistically than than 5g ever will be"
"so so i'm i i'm not particularly worried"
"about 5g on a on a practical level in"
"the in the grand scheme of things that i"
"worry about in the things that we all do"
"in our life that are sort of not optimal"
"for health i think 5g is probably way"
"down on the list of things for you to"
"worry about however i think it's it's"
"not true to say that uh because it's"
"non-ionizing we don't need to worry"
"about it i think that's actually false"
"okay speaking about diet you mentioned"
"eating and then in one of your talks you"
"also mentioned there's a connection"
"between the microbiome and this"
"morphogenetic field but i didn't hear"
"more elaboration on that so if you don't"
"mind elaborating they'll be great"
"yeah well"
"the general point is that"
"any sort of"
"uh kind any any sort of"
"modality that that controls the behavior"
"of cells in an organism automatically"
"becomes the target of an evolutionary"
"arms race of other organisms that live"
"near you on you within you and so on"
"because they can potentially manipulate"
"those controls to make specific things"
"happen in the body right so so anything"
"including chemical signaling"
"neurotransmitters we already know that"
"the microbiome is affecting mood and"
"behavior and things like that by"
"plugging into the neurotransmitter"
"pathways so there's this gut brain axis"
"and so on"
"so the same is true of bioelectric so so"
"in general you we could certainly assume"
"that various microbes that live in the"
"body and various other kinds of"
"parasites would have ways of tweaking"
"ion channel activities meaning probably"
"using some sort of you know chemicals"
"that they would be putting out to"
"manipulate your tissues way in ways that"
"would be"
"evolutionarily advantageous to them now"
"it just so happens we have a practical"
"example of this that we studied a couple"
"years ago in planaria"
"where and this was done in collaboration"
with
"ben wolf's lab at tufts where we showed"
"that there are bacteria that live on"
"these planaria and these bacteria are"
"actually able to manipulate the worms to"
"for example alter the structure of their"
"visual system to have multiple heads and"
"so on and that is because these uh these"
"bacteria are able to"
"tweak the same kinds of controls that"
"the worm tissues are using in the first"
"place to make decisions about how many"
"heads you're supposed to have what what"
"your visual system should look like so"
"it's it's it's on the one hand uh kind"
"of amazing that that these microbes have"
"a say in the structure of this uh"
"kind of organism that they live in on"
"the other hand from an evolutionary"
"point of view is completely expected"
"that they would have discovered ways to"
"do that"
"earlier in our talk you mentioned that"
"when you were looking for these voltage"
"gradients when you did this die the"
"voltage die you saw something that it"
"was a conspicuous face on the frog and"
"then you also mentioned well"
"you don't imagine that the code will be"
"that obvious for the majority of what we"
"care about especially for humans how is"
"it that you go about finding out or"
"decoding this code"
"and also what other factors matter is it"
"the do they pulse the voltage pulses and"
"then so the frequency of pulsing matters"
"doesn't move like what are the factors"
"that go in to"
"determining the code and then how do you"
"decode it"
"yeah um we don't know many of the things"
"about it so for example at the moment it"
"doesn't look like there's pulsing and"
"that the the temporal aspects of it are"
"particularly critical but that's"
"probably more a function of the fact"
"that we haven't really dug into it yet"
"but it's entirely possible that when we"
"we dig into the temporal aspects we will"
"find out that the time dependent changes"
"are really important it's possible at"
"the moment we've been completely"
"occupied with the spatial aspects and it"
"doesn't look at least to our technology"
"it doesn't look like it's uh"
"pulsing in in that particular way but we"
"may have simply not found it yet"
"uh in terms of in terms of how do you"
"how do you crack the code so"
"um there's a few there's a few pieces to"
"this one piece is simply observation"
"right so it's almost everything in"
"science starts with some sort of"
"observation and really just getting a"
"database or a profile of different"
"tissues under different conditions a"
"bioelectric profile of different tissues"
"under different different conditions"
"will be absolutely crucial to decoding"
"this because we need the same way that"
"we currently have databases of gene"
"expression of proteomics of um"
"all all these kind of biochemical and"
"and genetic profilings of tissues and"
"health and disease and different cells"
"of the body and so on uh we need the"
"exact same thing for bioelectric so we"
"need a kind of physiomic profiling where"
"there ought to be a database where we"
"can go and say this particular tissue"
"under these conditions should be in this"
"we have this bioelectric pattern and"
"here are the sort of range of normal and"
"here's how a difference between between"
"people and between the organisms in"
"different states and so on so that"
"that's that's the first thing and so we"
"only have that for very small number of"
cases
"we certainly don't have anything like a"
"full physiomic profiling yet"
"then what you need to do is you need to"
"build computational models that help you"
"explain why the electrical pattern is"
"the way it is given the various channels"
"and pumps that are"
"that are expressed in that tissue and"
"then you begin the hard work of"
"functional experiments so you open and"
"close some channels you observe what"
"happens and you build up uh a theory"
"based on an improved computational model"
"of how that"
"particular bioelectric pattern triggers"
"the downstream effects that it has so"
"for example we know now there's a"
"pattern that corresponds to make an eye"
"there's another pattern that corresponds"
"to build whatever goes at this location"
"of a wound we have a pattern that says"
"build a nice sharp brain the edge of a"
"brain and so we have a pattern that says"
"um don't be a tumor be normal tissue and"
"so on these kinds of um"
"these kinds of patterns need to be uh"
"need to be identified and that can only"
"be done"
"with uh this kind of mapping of of"
"pattern to the particular outcome and"
"then there's a lot of computational work"
"that goes in between"
"do you think psychedelics have any role"
"to play in"
"in changing or altering the"
"morphogenetic morphological code what i"
"mean is"
"you know after a single initial dose"
"there's markedly increased openness and"
"i'm wondering well is that because"
"there's a change in some non-neural"
"bioelectric activity"
"i have no idea uh i i've been no"
"expertise in in psychedelics whatsoever"
"i can tell you that much like in the"
"brain um"
"there is there's a really uh nice"
"connection between neurotransmitter"
"activity in the rest of the body and the"
"electrical signals that move these"
"neurotransmitters around so i would not"
"be at all shocked if there was some"
"connection and in fact we've certainly"
"used various compounds that are normally"
"uh utilized to target uh to target the"
"brains and so so things like anxiety"
"lytics and ssris and"
"various kinds of drugs that are normally"
"used in the nervous system we've used"
"them in in embryogenesis"
"uh in regeneration to to try to tweak"
"some of these pathways outside the"
"nervous system so that that's that's for"
"sure a thing you can do"
"whether or not it has anything to do"
"with the mental states induced by these"
"kind of compounds in humans i have no"
idea
"i know these questions are desolatory"
"they keep"
"going from subject to subject it's just"
"how my notes were but well regardless"
"you mentioned one time i think it was to"
"sean carroll that you can use daniel"
"dennett's way of speaking of intention"
"that is"
"i believe it was give as much intention"
"as you like to a system in order to"
"explain what's happening and when i say"
"intention i mean act as if it's willing"
"to do something"
"and then you also mention that when one"
"scales down one's theological projection"
"to smaller particles like pan psychics"
"might do then it leads naturally to"
"quantum indeterminacy and the least"
"action principle okay so let's start"
"from the beginning uh the"
"dan dennett's intentional stance"
"is the basically the following idea that"
"the real answer"
"to whether due to how much"
"intentionality but you know he usually"
"talks about consciousness but but"
"intentionality cognition intelligence"
"whatever whatever you're interested in"
"the real question of how much of that"
"some particular system has is not to be"
"found by sort of armchair philosophy"
"right to just assume and you know people"
"say this all time they say things like"
"well thermostats can't possibly have any"
"intention or you know"
"so so this is this is a decision that"
"somebody had made it has made just by uh"
"by by fiat basically and and and dan's"
"point is is very important it's that"
"it's an empirical question you can't"
"just you can't just decide and the way"
"that you discover this is simply this"
"you take a particular stance and you say"
"here's my system i think it has this"
"much intelligence or i think it's"
"capable of learning or i think it's able"
to
"uh have preferences in the you know or i"
"think it's a goal directed system"
"whatever whatever"
"wherever you choose to uh to start on"
"that continuum"
"and using that stance you do empirical"
"experiments to see how well that stands"
"helps you to understand what and control"
"whatever you're dealing with and so the"
"point being that we can't simply assume"
"that something is a non-intelligent"
"system because of what it's how it's"
"made or because of how it looks you have"
"to actually ask"
does
"what is the optimal way of looking at"
"that system so just to give you a simple"
"a simple analogy if you have a ball on"
"top of a hill you are pretty well um"
"you're going to do pretty well using the"
"newton's laws to ask how it's going to"
"roll down the hill and if you have"
"additional theories about the hopes and"
"dreams of this ball as it rolls down the"
"hill they're not going to do you much"
"good right they're not going to give you"
"any improved ability to uh to to"
"understand and control what's going to"
"happen on the other hand if you start"
"off with a with a with a live mouse at"
"the top of a hill and you think you're"
"going to apply newton's laws you're not"
"going to do very well uh because you're"
"going to need some other laws and so you"
"might decide that the system is is"
"minimally intelligent and see how you do"
"you might decide that the system is very"
"intelligent and it has memories of of"
"what happened when you put it on the"
"hill last week and it might do something"
different
"the point is it's an empirical"
"experiment you can't just decide what"
"it's going to be you have to uh you have"
"to choose a a level of abstraction of"
"some type of"
"learning agent maybe maybe all maybe"
"very little maybe quite a lot and see"
"how you do so so that's uh so that's"
"that's the intentional stance is that"
"that everything is to be decided by the"
"quality of the predictions and the"
"amount of control you gain by viewing"
"your system in a particular light right"
"so so so everything is is in a way"
"observer dependent and it's dependent on"
"the on the"
"experimental context in which you want"
"to examine the system you know a a human"
"brain is very intelligent in a certain"
"context it also makes a great"
"paperweight and if and if that's the the"
"how you choose to look at it then you're"
"you don't need uh to understand to"
"attribute much intelligence to it if"
"you're examining the problem space of"
"keeping down some papers in a wind then"
"then it doesn't come up"
"so so that's so that's so that's that"
"and so my uh where where i intersect"
"with this is that"
"i basically point out that"
"uh this is a really essential"
"uh this is a really essential way of"
"looking at things when"
"traditional phylogenetics"
"is is not a great guide and this is"
"meaning that when we are confronted with"
"novel creatures they might be novel"
"bioengineered creatures they might be"
"chimeras they might be uh something that"
"you find in space somewhere some"
"exobiological agent they might be"
"artificial intelligences that we create"
"whatever it is"
"when you are confronted with something"
"that you cannot simply place on the"
"familiar evolutionary tree of life in on"
"earth and say oh yeah this thing is uh"
"closely related to a fish therefore i'm"
"going to"
"i'm going to assume it has roughly the"
"cognition of other fish that i've known"
"so when you are"
"cr either creating or reverse"
engineering
"novel creatures the intentional stance"
"becomes completely essential because you"
"can't know a priori what the cognitive"
"capacities of this thing are going to be"
"and they might be uh it might behoove"
"you to really attribute quite a lot of"
"cognition to it or maybe not at all"
"depending on"
how
"how that does for you in terms of"
"empirical success so having said that"
"then the natural question might come up"
"is there a zero on this scale so if"
"you've got a scale uh a a continuum of"
"cognition or of intelligence that that"
"is a smooth gradient where different"
"types of systems might might land right"
"and so the question is is there in fact"
"a zero and so what i was saying is is"
"simply this that"
"if you"
"uh if if somebody if somebody had said"
"to me um"
"what would the absolute minimum"
"what would you have to have an absolute"
"minimum in order to be on this scale at"
"all right so so to be somewhere on the"
"scale of cognitive creatures what's the"
"what's the basement right what's what's"
"the minimal version that you would have"
"to have i would say probably the minimum"
"you would have to have two things you"
"would have to have some ability to do"
"goal directed behavior so you would have"
"to have some kind of ability to to"
"pursue goal states and you would have"
"you would have to have some kind of uh"
"internal uh control such that your"
um
"your your behavior and the things you do"
"are not perfectly described by all the"
"external influences around you at a"
"given time"
"right in other words in other words if"
"if i can if i can look at all of the"
"forces impinging on you and know exactly"
"what's going to happen then you're"
"probably a marble running down you know"
"some kind of an incline plane otherwise"
"otherwise if if you're if you're more"
"complex than that"
"then i would have to take into account"
"things that happened before things that"
"might happen in the future all kinds of"
"things that are not immediately what's"
"what's what's there so so what that"
"boils down to is some sort of internally"
"uh internally uh initiated action some"
"some some quote-unquote freedom and"
"that's you know that's a whole other"
"story to really dig into that but this"
"idea that that you would be able to"
"initiate things on your own you're not"
"just a responding you're not you're not"
"just a passive responder to forces"
"around you at that time and so having"
"said that having said those two things"
"you realize that already uh particles"
"already have those two things because"
"because particles already exhibit"
"quantum indeterminacy where they do"
"things that are that are fundamentally"
"not caused by any of the things around"
"them right they're complete it's"
"completely uh sort of um"
"indeterminate and they have the ability"
"to pursue goals in a very"
"uh sort of a very primitive manner which"
"is which are these least action"
"principles and so"
"one of the benefits of people often say"
"that um that that pan psychism"
"is it's it's a bad theory because"
"because it doesn't lead anywhere it"
"doesn't give you anything and i think"
"it's certainly there's there's there's a"
"little bit of truth to that but"
"there's um"
"there's also the fact that if you were"
"to ask the question"
uh
"i think that even par if you were to say"
"that i think even particles should have"
"some degree of gold directed activity"
"you might make a prediction"
"of of something like least action"
"principles existing and then you would"
"be right you would find you know they"
"that that model actually makes a"
"prediction that's completely not obvious"
"it is it isn't obvious that uh that that"
"when you have a um"
"a beam of light passing through a bunch"
"of lenses it's it's not obvious that you"
"can actually"
"forego the calculations of how the light"
"will interact at the at with the glass"
"at every point along the way and simply"
"say you know what i think i think it"
"wants to get where it's going with the"
"least amount of uh action right and so"
"and so you can you can make the correct"
"prediction of where it's going to go"
"simply by assuming that the light likes"
"to get where it's going"
"by minimizing and maximizing certain"
"things and you could predict something"
"like that if you had this idea that even"
"at the very bottom there would be some"
"type of"
"uh some type of"
"goal directed activity so if we ask what"
"does that look like what does agency and"
"intelligence look like in the very"
"minimal the the most minimal version"
"possible i think what you get is"
"something like like particles so from"
"that perspective i suspect there is no"
"zero on this scale because because even"
"particles are already on the scale"
"okay this zero was that the way that i"
"understand that is that that's like an"
"intelligence scale do you synonymize"
"that with"
"consciousness right that's that's a good"
"question uh i will say that um in my"
um
"writing on all of this stuff i've almost"
"completely avoided consciousness okay i"
"almost never talk about consciousness i"
"talk about cognition and and that's"
"that's kind of on purpose um i"
"don't have my my views on consciousness"
"are not"
uh
"fleshed out to the point where i'd be"
"interested in talking about them because"
"i don't think i can add anything yet"
"that a lot of other smart people haven't"
"already chewed over what i think i have"
um
"something to contribute is to the to the"
"questions of of cognition and"
"intelligence because those things are"
"empirically measurable they're absorbed"
"publicly observable behaviors and we can"
"we can have a research program focused"
"around them that i think is is different"
"than what other people have been doing"
"so that's what i've been talking about"
"consciousness is different um"
"in the sense that i think many of the"
"people who study who who say they study"
"consciousness in fact do not study"
"consciousness what they study at best"
"are correlates of consciousness or"
"oftentimes behaviors and properties that"
"may or may not have anything to do with"
"actual consciousness and so i think it's"
"very difficult to study actual"
"consciousness if you you have to"
"studying consciousness is a first person"
"activity it's not a third person"
"activity the way that you would study"
"anything in the external world meaning"
"studying it externally outside of"
"yourself i think fundamentally studying"
"consciousness requires"
"the subject of meaning you or whoever is"
"studying it to actually change during"
"during that that that process it's a"
"it's a completely different thing so so"
"i'm i'm i'm working on some things along"
"those lines it's a little early uh it's"
"a little early to talk about it"
"faraz hanarvar asks could the mapping"
"and thereby the treatment of the"
"signaling that is this electric"
"signaling differ between individuals"
"when we're talking about humans so does"
"the code is the code species dependent"
"or can it actually differ"
"based upon people"
"yeah um i don't think it's even species"
"dependent because we've seen that we can"
"induce let's say one species of flatworm"
"to form a head that belongs to a"
"completely different species simply by"
"by changing the distribution of gap"
"junctional connections"
"uh i suspect there are massive"
"uh conservations in the same way that"
"the biochemical and genetic codes are"
"are highly highly conserved"
"um are there going to be individual"
"differences among patients for sure and"
"we need to understand what those are we"
"do not yet know what those are that's a"
"major area for future research but i"
"think it's going to be conserved"
"sufficiently that we will be able to"
"have general purpose"
"electroceuticals however i think that"
"there will have to be some very serious"
"computational modeling that is going to"
"likely be personalized that is we're"
"going to have to take into account the"
"various physiological and"
"genetic states of the patient in terms"
"of do they have any ion channel"
"mutations what what other kinds of"
"physiological things are going on in"
"their blood in terms of ion content and"
"so on in order to perfect some of these"
"some of these treatments i think it will"
"be very much personalized but underneath"
"it all is going to be a highly conserved"
"bioelectric code"
"you mentioned electroceuticals which"
"reminds me of your company"
"morphoceuticals so if you're allowed to"
"talk about that what's the state of it"
"what's the goal of it"
"yeah the goal of the goal so so"
"morphaceuticals inc is a it's a new"
"company that um i co-founded with david"
"kaplan who's uh head of biomedical"
"engineering at tufts uh he and i are"
"partners in this work we work very"
"closely together"
"and the right now the mission of"
"morphoceuticals is focused around limb"
"regeneration so we are taking the things"
"we learned in the frog in terms of how"
to
"induce the regeneration of appendages in"
"the frog and trying to move it to"
"mammals so that someday towards humans"
"and so you know i can't really go into"
"details of how it's going but it's in"
"its very early days but i'm i'm very"
"optimistic that uh we will actually have"
"something something useful"
"so that's what we're doing are you"
"seeing more progress than you would"
"hoped or are you seeing less or"
"is it going pretty much how you expect"
"it basically going the way i thought it"
"would it's in the we're on track we're"
"on track given the the timeline that"
"we've envisioned and the basic science"
"that has to be done i mean this is let's"
"to be clear and and i receive all kinds"
"of um emails and phone calls from people"
"with with with really desperate medical"
"conditions and it's it's just it's an"
"amazing the need is incredible and and"
"unfortunately i have to say to all these"
"people every day that uh we're working"
"as fast as we can but it's still a basic"
science
"project it is we are not in clinical"
"trials we are not dealing with human"
"patients it is still very basic science"
"however it is now to the point where we"
"have commercial investment and it's"
"obvious that it's going to at some point"
"it's going to be real for patients"
"so um it's pretty much on track uh the"
"idea is uh this is quite simple uh david"
um
"david's group makes these wearable"
bioreactors
and
"uh you wear them on a limb amputation"
"site and they basically produce a kind"
of
"uh protective aqueous environment around"
"the around the wound and then my group"
"comes up with the payload which are the"
"drugs these are the electroceuticals"
"which are different types of ion channel"
"drugs and other other types of drugs"
"that are going to set the wound cells"
"towards a decision of let's let's"
"rebuild let's rebuild the limb"
"okay nadia wants to know would be very"
"interested in learning how the actual"
"algorithm works if he's even allowed to"
"share that information i guess it's some"
"form of pattern recognition but the"
"details would be cool to learn which"
"which which yeah i'm not sure which"
"algorithm was she talking about i think"
"she means the algorithm of when we"
"talked about decoding"
"decoding oh"
"like frog's face means frog's face"
yeah
"and then she has a sub question which"
"may be related also how do we know that"
"we are actually learning the cells"
"language and not just observing the"
"cause and effect because we only see"
"their behavior on the outside"
"well um i want i guess to go in order uh"
"the algorithm is still very much under"
"development part of the problem is that"
traditional
"machine learning algorithms require"
"incredible amounts of data meaning"
"meaning huge numbers of examples to"
"learn from we don't we don't have those"
"data so it's it's very expensive and"
"time consuming to get these images of"
"the electric pattern so we can't deploy"
"the typical types of algorithms that are"
used
"so we're still we're still a lot of the"
"early work was basically done by hand"
and
"we're at the moment uh still is that"
"we're still working on these algorithms"
"so that's still very much a uh kind of a"
"a story in progress uh with respect to"
"the second question i guess i'm not sure"
"what the distinction would be so if we"
"understand the bioelectric signals"
"sufficiently that we can put out"
"whatever whatever signal we want and get"
"the cells to do what we want i think by"
"definition that means we've communicated"
"correctly to the cells which means by"
"definition we've learned their"
"appropriate language i'm not sure what"
"it would mean to be able to do that and"
"yet not really have the language of the"
cells
"sam thompson wants to know do you think"
"biological self-organization and"
"emergence might be proto-algorithmic"
"and then what with the implications of"
"for that what would the implications be"
"for science"
"i don't know what proto-algorithmic"
"means in this context"
"um i can take i can take a stab at uh"
"i think what might be an interesting"
"sense of it but i'm not sure that"
"captures what he was asking"
"the kind of thing that i think is"
"important sort of foundationally to"
"think about"
is
where
"do the set points of various uh"
"homeostatic systems come from so so"
"whether you have physiological"
"homeostasis or anatomical homeostasis"
"the ability of a system to get back to"
"the same"
"state even though it's it's perturbed"
"right one might ask where is that"
"information and an easy thing to say is"
"that well it's it's evolution provides"
"it because certain types of um set"
"points are adaptive and other time other"
"types will will not you will not let you"
survive
and
"that's okay except that now what we see"
"with these synthetic organisms is that"
"for example with the xenobots we can"
"take these frog skin cells and put them"
"in a new environment and within 48 hours"
"or so they"
"self-assemble into a new organism with a"
"new anatomy a new behavior and various"
"new capabilities"
"they never existed before they have no"
"lengthy history of selection on earth"
"right the the cells themselves evolved"
"for being really good at sitting on the"
"outside of a frog or a tadpole and"
"keeping out the bacteria they did not"
"evolve for the ability to get together"
"and run around by themselves and do"
"various things so that raises the"
"interesting question of where does that"
"actually come from right what the the"
"it's clear that there's incredible"
"plasticity of the hardware that's"
"encoded by the genome it can do all"
"sorts of novel things but where does"
"where do the specific things come from"
"and i don't know if this is what he"
"meant by proto-algorithmic but"
"you can sort of think about it one of my"
"favorite analogies is this thing called"
"a galton board i don't know if everybody"
"knows what that is but imagine imagine a"
"vertical piece of wood like this it's a"
"vertical piece of wood and then you bang"
"a bunch of nails into it at you know"
"regularly spaced intervals you just bang"
"a bunch of nails into it you take them"
"you take a bucket of marbles and you"
"dump it into the top and they go boom"
"boom boom they all go and every marble"
"just sort of bounces stochastically back"
"and forth"
"if if if you've got enough marbles the"
"outcome is always going to be exactly"
"the same you're going to get this"
"beautiful bell curve"
"right if you just visualize and i"
"actually have toys of this you can"
"actually buy one on amazon it's like"
"twinkle from price is right yeah yeah"
"yeah very very similar very similar but"
"you dump a whole you see if you dump one"
"marble you have no idea where it's gonna"
"end up but if you dump a bunch of"
"marbles in then on average you're going"
"to get this beautiful bell curve and so"
"you can ask a simple question where is"
"the shape of this bell curve encoded"
"was it in the description of the wood no"
"was it in the layout of the nails no you"
"could put the nails almost any which way"
"you want was it in the in the recipe of"
"making this thing no"
"um where was it and so"
"you end up with this idea that"
"much like and this is certainly i'm not"
"the first person by far to to to say"
"this this is a very old you know maybe"
"maybe pythagoras or plato had similar"
"ideas where"
"you would say that somewhere in an"
"important sense there are laws laws of"
"mathematics laws of computation that"
"exist independent of"
"uh well independent they have an"
"independent existence and what happens"
"is that when we build specific kinds of"
"machines we couple to those laws and we"
"take advantage of them so for example if"
you
"build a a machine that looks like a"
"galton board you get to couple to the"
"rules of mathematics that give you this"
"beautiful shape you didn't have to"
"specify the shape ahead of time you get"
"the shape for free by building a device"
"that can couple to those laws if you"
"discover a transistor which is basically"
"just a uh voltage-gated current"
"conductance right it's so it's like a"
"little tiny synapse you know it's the"
"same as a gap junction an ion channel as"
"soon as you've made that little machine"
"you can couple to these amazing laws of"
"computation that tell you for example"
"that if you have a bunch of nand gates"
"you can build anything well where did"
"that fact come from you know these truth"
"tables or if you know two angles of a"
"triangle you automatically know the"
"third way where that come from so so"
"where is that so so maybe that's what he"
"meant by proto-algorithmic but it's the"
"idea that"
"there are these rules and some of the"
"some of them are physics some of them"
"are mathematics and some of them are"
computation
"you can if you make the right kind of"
"device you can reap the benefits of of"
"some of those laws and evolution does"
"this all the time evolution discovers"
"certain pieces of hardware that then let"
"you do amazing amazing things because"
"you're leveraging these laws that are"
"out there that are invisible to you"
"until you've built the right hardware"
"great we'll just get to four more"
"questions hopefully they're quick"
"feign is the evolutionary suppression of"
"regeneration in mammals an advantageous"
"trait for the accumulation of memory"
"wow uh i'm not sure about for the"
"accumulation of memory i i doubt it"
"because there are plenty of creatures"
"that uh it can do perfectly well with"
"memory that that are highly regenerative"
"so so i don't think that it's um you"
"need to you i don't think it's"
"impossible to have a regenerative"
"capacity and memory in the same animal"
"however um we can think about"
why
"don't you why aren't humans for example"
"regenerating their limbs so so nobody"
"knows but but i'll tell you a plausible"
"story that may or may not be correct"
"imagine that you are the ancestor of"
"mammals you're the tiny"
"thing that looks a little bit like a"
"mouse and you're running around the"
"forest and somebody bites your leg off"
"so the problem is that unlike a"
"salamander which can hang out in water"
"and take a long time to heal you have a"
"rapid metabolism you have a rapid"
"heartbeat and blood pressure and"
"you're going to bleed out long before"
"you get a chance to regenerate so your"
"job if you want to survive is to form a"
"scar and to have an inflammatory"
"response that's going to kill off with"
"some of the bacteria you need to not"
"bleed out so you need to seal the wound"
"immediately you need to make a scar and"
"by the way you are going to try to put"
"weight on it because you're walking on"
"it unlike unlike a salamander which has"
"the buoyancy of water to hold you up"
"you're going to try to put weight on it"
"which means that as soon as some kind of"
"delicate blastema is formed and these"
"cells are starting to grow you're going"
"to grind it into the forest floor so"
"that's not particularly conducive also"
"because you're you're in dry air instead"
"of water all of the electrical currents"
"that need to come out of that wound"
"epithelium to drive the electric states"
"they can't work because the dry air is a"
"is an insulator"
"so uh you might imagine that at that"
"point you might as well just shift the"
"scarring because the regeneration now"
"that story"
"has pros and cons um"
"one nice thing about that story is that"
"for example it fits with this really"
"weird fact why are"
"why are deer regenerative on their"
"antlers why can deer regenerate massive"
"amounts of bone and vasculature and"
"innervation every year"
"i mean what's interesting about the deer"
"is they're not putting weight on it"
"they're catering and carrying it around"
"and they never have to it never has to"
"worry that it's going to be disrupted"
"while it's trying to grow so so that's"
"that's one part you know that that that"
"fits what doesn't fit is questions like"
"well okay that explains why the limbs"
"don't regenerate how about internal"
"organs why don't they regenerate right"
"and we don't know so the you know so no"
"one knows and we can come up with some"
"ideas that"
"have sort of pros and cons"
"tom carrick asks well it says"
"fascinating are there overlaps with the"
"field of quantum biology what about orc"
"or that is i'm sure you've heard of"
"stewart hammeroffs and penrose's"
"orchestrated objective reduction"
yeah
um
"i don't know"
"i i can't say too many useful things"
"about that but but i will say sort of"
"one thing uh"
i
"do agree with uh with with uh hameroff"
"and penrose on the idea that anesthesia"
"in general is"
"one of the most profound"
"maybe maybe the only profound tool we"
"have to study actual consciousness right"
"that's we we don't have a lot of other"
"tools to study consciousness but"
"anesthesia is a pretty good one and the"
"interesting thing about anesthesia is"
that
"in general most general anesthetics are"
"gap junctional disruptors"
"now this this this has uh like many uh"
"facts as things that are that are easy"
"to understand and some things that are"
"deeply puzzling the e the kind of uh"
"thing that makes perfect sense is that"
"these these electrical networks in the"
body
"manifested various cognitive abilities"
"long before they were brains so these"
"gap junctions that enable body cells to"
"form networks are critical for these"
"networks to have memories memories of"
"body shape but to make decisions about"
"what they're going to grow and so on so"
"so the use of gap junctions to"
"make networks that can follow"
"large scale goals like make a limb and"
"make an organ and so on that's"
"evolutionarily ancient and it's not"
"surprising at all that what evolution"
"did when the nervous systems develop was"
"to use that same trick to create another"
"type of cognitive agent which which"
"lives basically central ascension"
"centered in the brain and use this the"
"exact same reuse the exact same hardware"
"for that so that makes sense and so it"
"makes total sense that that goes away"
"when when uh those gap generators are"
"disrupted by a general anesthetic it"
"also makes total sense that if we want"
"to turn a planarian it into the head of"
"make its head turn its head into uh the"
"head of a different species of planarian"
"guess what we use a general anesthetic"
"called octanol it's the exact same thing"
"it's a gap junctional disruptor so what"
"you're doing is you're basically"
"disrupting that proto-cognitive agent"
"the collective intelligence of the body"
"that normally remembers how to make a"
"particular kind of head you're basically"
"disrupting that with this general"
"anesthetic now the amazing thing about"
"general anesthetic is that any of us"
"ever come back from it being the same"
"person think about it you have this"
brain
"you have you have right it's a it it"
"supports the cognitive structures of a"
"very complex creature and then"
"for some number of hours you simply"
"disconnect most of the cells from being"
electrically
"in communication with each other and"
"then you let the connections reform"
"and you just sort of hope that"
"everything comes back to how it was"
"right if i didn't know"
"you know if we didn't know that the"
"general anesthetics work somebody were"
"to tell me that that's their plan i"
"would say"
"well you might get a living living human"
"out of it at the end but certainly not"
"going to be the patient that walked in"
"you you know you're going to bear no"
"resurrection yeah of course you're going"
"to completely wreck their mental state"
"and and so so one thing that's amazing"
"is that actually most people come out of"
"it being the more or less the same"
"person as they went in"
"but the other interesting thing is not"
"everybody so in fact um there is this is"
"why they don't give they don't like to"
"give general anaesthetic if they can"
"help it because some people have"
"permanent psychosis some people um in"
"fact many people have hallucinations on"
"their way out um out of it that"
"eventually resolve as the brain sort of"
"finds its its attractors that were there"
"before but if you watch you can go to"
"youtube and you can watch some really um"
"sort of funny videos of people coming"
"out of general anesthesia right and you"
"know people think they're pirates and"
"they're gangsters and they you know they"
"don't understand where where they've"
"been and they have all these crazy"
"stories about who they think they are"
"and eventually that sort of resolves and"
"not really that part's not really"
"surprising i'm shocked anybody ever"
"comes out of it you know properly that"
"it's amazing"
"so uh the planaria is exactly the same"
"thing so when you disrupt their um their"
"gap junctions"
"the first thing they do is they"
"regenerate random heads that belong"
"possibly to other species right and then"
"after about uh 30 days"
"those heads actually remodel back to the"
"correct species a species-specific shape"
so
"they're not permanent so so to me this"
"looks exactly like what happens when you"
"come out of general anesthesia"
"okay mo flow wants to know how does he"
"see his work relating to david"
"sinclair's biological clock"
"yeah um yeah interesting uh it's it's"
"funny i've been talking a lot i talked"
"to david recently and i uh i've been"
"thinking a lot about um people have been"
"asking me a lot about aging bioelectrics"
"of aging"
"um i i don't know i don't know what the"
"relationship between bioelectrics and"
"aging really is"
um
"i can tell you that"
"uh planaria as far as we can tell don't"
"age there's no such thing as an old"
"planarian they live forever if"
"you know if they're not injured and so"
uh
"i think what that tells us is that aging"
"it would be resolved if we could crank"
"up regenerative capacity to the point"
"where we would constantly be"
"regenerating any to any cells that that"
"aged right senescing cells would just be"
"regenerated the way planaria do"
"so my sis my strong suspicion is that"
"uh aging is a is a"
"a consequence of our poor ability to"
stay
"with the appropriate anatomical"
"structure through long periods of time"
"and if we cracked that problem we would"
"simultaneously get the answer to to"
"aging cancer degenerative disease and"
"traumatic injury i think it all comes"
"down to the ability to to to defend a"
"particular body plan over time"
"i know many people say that telomere"
"length has to do with aging well the"
"shortened telomere length and you're"
"suggesting well it could be that but"
"it's also related to this"
"morphogenetic code that you're referring"
"to and"
"yeah are they interrelated somehow"
"probably i mean i am not an expert on"
"telomeres i have no idea what's going on"
"with telomeres in planaria i'm assuming"
"somebody's studying it we certainly"
"haven't i'm assuming somebody must be"
"all i know is"
"this this story of"
"inevitable aging because you keep making"
"copies of things and fundamentally"
"things are the information is degrading"
"and eventually you you don't have it"
"anymore uh and it's degrading at the"
"ends because you know because that's"
"where you're eating that that clearly"
"cannot be the whole story because"
"planaria avoided permanently so whatever"
"they're doing"
"is uh is is is the way to get around"
"aging and i think it's more than a"
"coincidence that the species that is"
"immortal is also the species with the"
"greatest regenerative capacity or let's"
"say the set of species so i i don't"
"think that's a that's a that's a crazy"
"coincidence that i think there's there's"
"a reason for that"
"okay the last question"
"nate brundman can you imagine"
"referring to you michael can you imagine"
"a mental practice by which a person can"
"influence the goal state of the body for"
"example joe dispenza has made some"
"claims that he's healed his body in a"
"way that doctors say are impossible it"
"also a question i had for you earlier"
"which relates to this is"
"how your work is related to the placebo"
effect
so
"whether or not you see the connection"
"there i'm interested in the placebo"
"effect too i'm trying to sneak in two"
"questions for the pressure one"
"yeah um okay so so i i don't know"
"anything about uh joe dispenza i don't"
"know anything about the claims that he's"
"made or or any specific uh you know kind"
"of uh healing event"
"but i'll give you kind of a general"
"thought about this"
"it is"
uncontroversial
that
"your your thoughts whatever they may be"
"whether or not uh you know whatever"
"whatever you think thinking is it is"
"pretty uncontroversial that your"
"thoughts affect the physiological"
"functioning of your body i mean that's"
"obvious if you if you want to get up and"
"walk around your thoughts have now"
"activated various uh electrical pathways"
"they've triggered a bunch of muscle"
"motion if you have a tendency to you"
"know mentally work yourself up into an"
"anxious state you can certainly by by by"
"your thinking uh crank up various stress"
"enzyme production in your body right we"
"all know that you can do the opposite if"
"you if you've trained in techniques to"
"calm yourself down under various"
"circumstances you can uh reduce the"
"level of cortisol in your blood you can"
"reduce um various uh various fire and"
"flight responses so it's it's it's not"
"some some some weird um you know of a"
"voodoo kind of claim to uh to say that"
"that your thoughts absolutely affect the"
"biophysical processes of your body we do"
"it every day if that wasn't true you"
"couldn't get up in the morning when you"
"wanted to get up and go to work so so"
"it's it's that part's completely obvious"
"so from there it's a very"
"short uh hop skip and a jump to the idea"
that
"not only can you give commands to your"
"muscles and your glands to produce"
various
"hormones neurotransmitters and muscle"
"motion but you might be able to exert"
"some influence over other cells for"
"example skin cells um in your uh you"
"know at wounds and and uh and you and"
"your liver the in the way that it"
"processes information"
"i don't find it implausible whatsoever"
"so i don't again i'm not commenting on"
"any particular instance of anybody"
"having healed themselves of anything i'm"
"just saying that"
"it is it is uh it is it is not"
"uh it is not a stretch to think that not"
"only can you talk to your van"
"when i say talk i mean you know exert"
"exert influence"
"on your uh on your various glands that"
"that put out cortisol and adrenaline and"
"various other things"
"why can't why can't you send commands to"
"other cells i that that seems it seems"
"silly to think that that's impossible"
"so um"
"having said all that i think that uh the"
"placebo effect is extremely profound i"
"think that what it's telling us is that"
"there is a communication across levels"
"so you have meaning that you have a"
"level of organization that consists of"
"your body cells and that has a degree of"
"cognition and a degree of intelligence"
"but your body is also home to an"
"additional intelligence which lives"
"probably largely in the brain and it"
"appears that those two can uh can"
"communicate in various ways and i can"
"imagine that"
"there are new there are lots of things"
"to be discovered about ways to improve"
"that communication and have you know we"
"know we know there are certain practices"
"where people extend the amount of time"
"they can they can sit under water and"
"and uh change their body temperature and"
"and change their their pulse rate and"
"things like that i find it completely"
"plausible that that there are ways to uh"
"communicate in that way to other cells"
"in the body"
also
uh
"there is the there is the field of um"
"hypno dermatology where where people by"
"hypnosis try to treat various skin"
"diseases some of which have a neural"
"neuroimmune component some of which may"
"not have a neuroimmune component"
"so um the activity of of the mind which"
"is simply the execution of of the"
"physiological computations that happen"
"in the brain affect physiological"
"computations that happen outside the"
"brain i don't think that's i don't think"
"that's particularly a stretch"
"at all"
"one of your goals is an anatomical"
"compiler and then what you just said"
"made me think well some of these people"
"who are meditating or on the more"
"meditative side tend to work with"
"thoughts to heal oneself then i was"
"wondering hmm i wonder if your"
"anatomical compiler can advise some of"
"the more thought-based healing practices"
"here's an example you say well if you"
"were to think of this image it's more"
"likely to heal you than if you were to"
"think of this other image do you think"
"that's at all possible or that's way too"
"high level"
"i don't think it's i don't think it's"
"impossible no uh"
"again i'm not suggesting that there's"
"i'm not supporting any particular image"
"of as being a healing one but i don't"
"think it's it's impossible at all i mean"
the
"uh and and there's been work recently on"
"various types of um pulsed light stimuli"
"into the retina having some some"
"interesting neuro"
"neuroprotective effects in the brain and"
"so on um yeah all of this it's it's a"
"giant electrical network all of the"
"cells are communicating with each other"
"uh there's absolutely no reason why that"
"couldn't work but i think that um you"
"know to be clear this anatomical"
"compiler isn't just us you know"
"the anatomical compiler is a"
"it's a sort of practical um"
"personification of the goal that all of"
"us in the community are going for which"
"is the ability to control growth and"
"form right and and when we have that"
"ability that's when the anatomical"
"compiler becomes positive possible so"
"it's not just something that we you know"
"we in particular are working on"
"but i think that uh this is this is part"
"of all the things you're discussing now"
"are part of the deep reason why"
"cognitive science and consciousness and"
"all of those kinds of things are deeply"
"related to developmental biology and"
"physiology right they're they're"
"absolutely interrelated because they are"
"two sides of the same coin information"
"processing in goal-directed hierarchical"
"systems and when you understand the more"
"you understand about one the better you"
"are at managing the others this is this"
"is two sides of the same question"
"where can people find out more about you"
"and what's next for you"
"well uh they can find out uh i have a i"
"have a website um"
at
"drmik11.org uh we have a center website"
"which is allencenter.tufts.com"
"i have a twitter feed which is at"
drmik11
"and uh what's next uh it's a good"
"question i i don't you know i can't tell"
"you exactly what's going to happen next"
"but i certainly know the things that we"
"are trying to do and that we're working"
on
"and you can go to our website and see"
"all kinds of projects that we're working"
on
"in the um"
"in the areas of trying to lay a better"
"foundation for understanding basal"
"cognition and"
"understanding morphogenesis and"
"developing applications and birth birth"
"defects and regeneration and cancer"
"we're doing some work in machine"
"learning and trying to sort of close"
"that loop and understand how"
"we can use the principles that we learn"
"in biology to make better uh cognitive"
"to to make novel and better um cognitive"
"systems that are going to help us in in"
"various ways"
"and the links to everything that michael"
"just mentioned will be in the"
"description so please check that out you"
"mentioned two sides of the same coin but"
"i didn't quite understand that how is it"
"that developmental biology and"
"consciousness may be two sides because"
"you mentioned one is first and third"
"person is the other so how are they two"
"sides of the same coin"
"well in in in many ways uh first of all"
uh
"uh the fact that we all start life as a"
"single cell and that cell self-assembles"
"into a creature that can later say i am"
"a centralized intelligence i am i i"
"a self yeah that may be but you're made"
"of a bunch of cells and in fact you used"
"to be one cell and then a ball of cells"
"and so that whole process of of how that"
"that that's that unified self is"
"arranged uh and and uh supported by a"
"collection of of competent agents these"
"being cells is very similar to uh how"
"the body is in the pattern of the body"
"is is arranged by the collective"
"intelligence of cells morphogenesis is a"
"collective intelligence problem it is"
"not a chemistry problem or a genetics"
"problem it's a problem of collective"
"intelligence and"
"those same kinds of issues arise when"
"you're trying to understand any kind of"
a
"human or any other centralized"
intelligence
"how does the information processing and"
"the capacities of lots of independent"
"subunits in the case of brains those"
"will be neurons but in the case of the"
"body there'll be other types of cells"
"how do they work together to pursue"
"goals and plans and have preferences"
"that don't belong to any of the"
"individual subunits themselves"
"right the making a limb is a goal that"
"no individual cell can can no no no"
"individual cell knows what a limb is or"
"you can can answer the question for how"
"many fingers are we supposed to have or"
"how long is the finger supposed to be"
"that is a piece of information that only"
"the cellular collective has right so"
"this ability of"
"pursuing large-scale goals of having and"
"having collective information that's"
"more than the sum of its parts is"
"exactly the same question of where does"
"intelligence uh and and and you know"
"sort of uh"
"cognitive capacity come from those are"
all
"those problems will be answered together"
"they will not be answered if either one"
"of these things remains mysterious we"
"won't have an answer to the other"
"thank you sir thank you so much for"
"spending so much thank you very much"
"yeah thank you for your questions i want"
"to make let everyone know that this i"
"think is nobel prize winning work so i i"
"will do my best to promote this and"
"and get you"
"get you some more attention man i hope"
"so thank you thank you very much that's"
"very kind thank you i appreciate it"
"the podcast is now finished if you'd"
"like to support conversations like this"
"then do consider going to patreon.com"
"slash c-u-r-t j-a-i-m-u-n-g-a-l"
"that is kurt jaimungle it's support from"
"the patrons and from the sponsors that"
"allow me to do this full time every"
"dollar helps tremendously thank you"
