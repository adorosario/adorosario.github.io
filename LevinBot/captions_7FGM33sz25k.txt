"let me see here"
"okay uh can everybody see my slides"
"yes yes perfect"
"um okay thank you so uh if anyone is"
"interested afterwards in reaching me or"
"uh finding any of the um"
"uh the primary papers the data sets the"
"software everything is uh is at this"
"website so what I want to talk about"
"today is uh this idea that uh a"
"pre-neural bioelectrical networks"
"underlie a kind of somatic intelligence"
"and I want to talk about uh the"
"implications of this for"
"um for regenerative medicine but also"
"for evolution and and some things like"
"that we can start by thinking about Alan"
"Turing who who needs no introduction"
"this is the the forefather of uh of"
"computer science and he was very"
"interested in"
"um intelligence in different embodiments"
"he was interested in what what is what"
"is fundamental about intelligence uh as"
"aside from any one particular uh"
"implementation and uh in in the basics"
"of computing and so on but he also did"
"this really interesting um early work"
"on uh on morphogenesis uh the idea of"
"the generation of of uh pattern from"
"chemical signals during embryonic"
"development and so one might ask why"
"would somebody who's interested in uh in"
"in uh intelligence and in computation"
"why would they be interested in in"
"studying morphogenesis and I think"
"Turing uh although he didn't write"
"explicitly about this I think that being"
"the genius that he was he saw deeply"
"that these are the same problem and I"
"think fundamentally this is a very um"
"very very important idea that that that"
"the Developmental morphogenesis and"
"intelligence are really the same problem"
"and here's why uh we oftentimes uh"
"there's this uh there's this idea that"
"um uh"
"there are let's say let's say uh"
"collections of ants and termites and and"
"bird flocks are kind of collective"
"intelligence and then people think uh"
"about well is this really a an"
"individual is it really a collective"
"intelligence how do we think about it"
"but then they say well those things are"
"are maybe controversial but but but I am"
"a true centralized intelligence right I"
"I am a single being I'm a centralized"
"intelligence and of course this isn't"
"this isn't correct because we are also"
"made of parts so so our our brains are a"
"collection of cells we are all walking"
"bags of cells basically"
"um and this is the sort of thing that"
"we're we're made of uh this is a single"
"cell this is called the lacrum area and"
"uh this is of course an independent"
"organism uh this is not a human somatic"
"cell but but all all of our cells were"
"once independent to the living organisms"
"and so you can see the uh the the high"
"level of Competency and autonomy that"
"this uh little creature has in uh"
"addressing the problems on its own scale"
"so physiological metabolic things like"
that
"all of us made this amazing uh journey"
"across the Cartesian cut we were all"
"once a uh an acquiescent oversight so"
"just a single cell where people would"
"say well that's just physics and"
"chemistry there's no cognition there"
"it's a it's a chemical system and then"
"eventually we end up being uh something"
"like this which is which is a complex"
"organism with behavior and maybe even"
"something like this which is a very"
"complex uh he has has a human level"
"metacognition and will make statements"
"like I am unique and I have mental"
"properties that that don't uh that don't"
"exist in other creatures and and so on"
"and so the key thing to realize is that"
"this this journey is incredibly slow and"
"gradual the developmental biology offers"
"no sharp lightning bolt where uh to the"
"left of that line we were just chemistry"
"and physics and then boom after this now"
"you're a cognitive uh creature that I"
"mean there's no such thing in"
"developmental biology it's a slow"
"gradual process so we really need to"
"understand how the scale up of of of of"
"cognitive capacities happens during this"
"uh during this process of course on an"
"evolutionary time scale but also on each"
"of us on the developmental time scale"
"and this this connection between"
"information in the brain and information"
"in the body can be really uh seen in the"
"plasticity of certain biological forms"
"so here for example is a planarian so"
"this is a flatworm uh they have two"
"interesting properties one is that"
"they're smart so you can train them for"
"specific memories for specific behaviors"
"and they regenerate so if I amputate the"
"head off of this planarian the tail will"
"sit there and eventually regrow a new"
"head and so this is something that"
"McConnell uh discovered in the 60s and"
"then we later confirmed using modern"
"automated techniques if you train a"
"planarian to recognize these little"
"bumpy discs as the place where they find"
"food and then you cut off their head"
"which contains their brain the tail will"
"eventually regrow a new head and that"
"new head that new animal will show a"
"behavioral evidence of recall he will"
"still remember the information so these"
"memories not only are potentially stored"
"outside of the brain but also imprinted"
"onto a completely new brain as it"
"develops so you see this ability of"
"information moving across the body you"
"see the the conciliency of of uh of"
"information about about shape about"
"anatomical shape that we have to rebuild"
"the head is missing we have to rebuild"
"it but also restoring this uh this this"
"uh this this uh cognitive information"
"so these are really really quite"
"connected that plasticity that ability"
"to to to uh recover a personal identity"
"and by the way if you're interested in"
"philosophy and the question of personal"
"identity and the question of what"
"happens if somebody makes a copy of me"
"are they also me what what happens to"
"the to the individual here you can do"
"this in planaria right you cut them into"
"pieces and every piece will have the"
"original information now who's the"
"original right is it kind of a"
"philosophical puzzle"
"but this this plasticity um exists in"
"vertebrates as well so this is a frog"
"tadpole so here's the uh here's the"
"brain here the nostrils the mouth"
"um and what we've done is we've removed"
"the we've we've produced the tadpole"
"with no primary eyes but we did put some"
"eye precursor cells on the tail and they"
"form a perfectly good eye and that eye"
"uh connects to the spinal cord and these"
"we we show using this device that we've"
"built uh we show that these animals can"
"see quite wild so we can train them on"
"visual tasks even though this eye does"
"not connect to the brain and it's not in"
"the head so that plasticity and you"
"didn't need uh you know thousands of"
"generations for this to evolve that this"
"this architecture is already ready to uh"
"be scrambled in this way and still have"
"uh adaptive function and that has huge"
"implications for evolution"
"so the interesting thing about uh"
"biology is that"
um
"we are we are all multi-scale systems"
"not only structurally so we all know"
"that we're made of organs tissues cells"
"and molecular networks but actually"
"functionally at each level these"
"um these layers uh solve uh various"
"problems in various spaces so they're"
"competent uh to solve different"
"different types of problems in different"
"action spaces now uh in this and we call"
"this the multi-scale competency"
"architecture now what do I mean by these"
"problem space as well we are and many"
"animals are uh very primed and very good"
"at recognizing agency and intelligence"
"in uh three-dimensional space so so"
"medium scale bodies moving at medium"
"speeds through uh through space and"
"doing intelligent things it's easy for"
"us to recognize that but it should be"
"clear that that when we look at various"
"systems and assign to them some kind of"
"um estimate of their intelligence we're"
"really taking an IQ test ourselves"
"because we're not very good at"
"recognizing intelligent behavior in"
"other problem spaces so for example"
"imagine that you had an innate feeling"
"for your body chemistry the way that we"
"have vision and hearing and so on"
"imagine if you could feel your your"
"blood chemistry I think it would be very"
"easy for us to recognize"
um
"the the workings of our of our liver and"
"kidneys and so on in physiological space"
"as different kinds of uh intelligent"
"Behavior meaning problem solving"
"Behavior with different levels of"
"competencies so the spaces that we deal"
"with are physiological space the space"
"of all possible Gene Expressions so this"
"is a transcriptional space and my"
"favorite which is amorphous space right"
"this is the the space of the different"
"parameters that establish different"
"anatomical shapes like these different"
"um head shapes so I'll give you uh we're"
"going to spend most of today talking"
"about uh problem solving in this"
"anatomical space but I want to say one"
"thing about transcriptional and"
"physiological spaces just to give you an"
"idea of just just how clever um our our"
"cells really are"
"so uh this is a planarian this is a what"
"that flatworm that I uh that I talked to"
"you about and what we found is that if"
"we expose this if we um expose this"
"planarian to Barium a solution of barium"
"chloride uh what happens is barium is a"
"non-specific potassium channel blocker"
"so so"
"um the cells can't pass potassium and uh"
"that makes the cells very unhappy and"
"especially in the head where there's"
"lots of neurons that want to transfer"
potassium
"um their heads explode their heads"
"literally literally explode overnight"
"and if you leave them in the barium what"
"happens is that a couple within a week"
"or two they regrow a new head and the"
"new head is completely insensitive to"
"Barium so we asked the simple question"
"transcriptionally what is different"
"about this new head why does this new"
"head not mind the barium so we just"
"compared all the genes that are"
"expressed in these guys versus these"
guys
"and we pulled out a very small number of"
genes
"um you know here's the amazing The"
"Amazing fact is that"
"uh planarian never encounter barium in"
"the wild so there's net there's no"
"evolutionary history for barium exposure"
"there's no uh there's no reason why they"
"should have a built-in"
"um a mechanism for us expressing certain"
"genes when they encounter barium this is"
"a completely novel problem for them and"
"so you can think about this as as being"
"stuck in this in this nuclear reactor"
"control panel where every you know 20"
"000 genes or however many they have"
"every knob is is one Gene and you're"
"faced with it's it's melting down you're"
"faced with this terrible physiological"
"stressor how do you know which genes to"
"turn on and off if you've never seen"
"this this uh this this challenge before"
"and the amazing thing uh uh is that you"
"don't have time to to do a random walk"
"you don't have time for a gradient"
"descent the cells don't turn over very"
"fast the way that you might in a"
"bacterial Colony that you might see that"
"uh they they find their way through this"
"transcriptional space very very"
"efficiently given a completely novel uh"
"challenge so so it's when we don't know"
"how this works it's very interesting"
"interesting to think about how this"
"works so overall what we are interested"
"in is diverse systems so not traditional"
"brainy systems necessarily but all kinds"
"of other things"
"whether whether evolved or designed that"
"are able to navigate different problem"
"spaces with different degrees of"
"Competency so so uh all the way and and"
"this um this this notion of having"
"different degrees of Competency in"
"navigation was described by by first by"
"by Norbert Weiner and uh and uh"
"colleagues in a very"
"um kind of cybernetic scale of thinking"
"about how Behavior could be controlled"
"and what he wanted was what what they"
"what they wanted to do was establish um"
"a kind of uh a Continuum with with some"
"good transitions here all the way from"
"completely passive Behavior which we"
"would just say is just physics all the"
"way up to what what we see in humans"
"which is metacognition and things like"
"that and all of the steps in between in"
"a way that was not tied to specific"
"architecture so we're not saying brain"
"we're not saying neural network we're"
"we're not making any uh assumptions"
"about what the substrate is what we're"
"saying is there are different kinds of"
"Behavioral competencies with respect to"
"reaching specific goal States in that"
"space and when he says teleology he"
"doesn't mean magic and he doesn't mean"
"human level I know that I know what my"
"goal is it just means the ability of a"
"system to reach a specific goal despite"
"perturbations and these are the"
"different levels of sophistication for"
"different systems that might be able to"
"do that and what that allows this this"
"kind of approach allows us to do"
"something interesting which is the goal"
"of my framework which I which I call"
"t-a-m-e tame for technological approach"
"to mind everywhere it allows us to to"
"think about uh using the same tools a"
"very wide range of potential agents so"
"so yes familiar subjects of Behavioral"
"Science like like humans like mammals"
"other mammals um Birds maybe octopus but"
"but also really weird creatures like"
"Colonial organisms whole swarms"
"synthetic new life forms I'll show you"
"one at the end of at the end of this"
"talk artificial intelligences that might"
"be entirely software based and maybe"
"someday exobiological agents because all"
"life on Earth is basically an N equals"
"one example of of evolution"
"so um we want general purpose tools to"
"be able to recognize competencies I'm"
"not saying anything about Consciousness"
"at this point I'm not saying anything"
"about human level intelligence I'm"
"saying basic problem-solving"
"competencies at different levels of"
"sophistication that that might exist in"
"unfamiliar guises and here's and here's"
"my favorite example of that which which"
"I would like to talk about"
"um we all Start Life as a collection of"
"embryonic blastomeres and then"
"eventually you get this so this is a"
"across section through"
"um a human torso so you can see all the"
"amazing uh"
"the order that's here right so so all"
"the tissues and structures are all uh uh"
"positioned and and um everything's in"
"the right this of the right size the"
"right orientation the right uh uh a"
"position relative to each other where is"
"this amazing uh amount of order encoded"
"right where is the pattern now people"
"are often tempted to say well it's in"
"the DNA but we can read genomes now and"
"and we know what's in the DNA what's in"
"the DNA is a description of the micro"
"level Hardware the proteins that every"
"cell gets to have the DNA doesn't"
"directly say anything about this"
"large-scale structure the structure"
"arises from the behavior of individual"
"cells from the physiology that drives"
"individual cells to interact and create"
"something like this so we're interested"
"in that that uh that that Collective"
"Behavior we're interested in how groups"
"of cells know what to make and when to"
"stop building as workers in regenerative"
"medicine we'd like to know well if a"
"part is missing how do we recreate it"
"and as Engineers we want to go further"
"and say well can we push these cells to"
"do something else besides what they"
"normally build can they can they build"
"something completely different and so"
"what I want to talk about is this uh the"
"this the the idea of uh the end game of"
"the how I see the end game of this whole"
"field is uh with this notion of an"
"anatomical compiler so imagine that in"
"the future you will be able to sit down"
"in front of a computer and draw the"
"plant or animal that you want not at the"
"level of molecular Pathways but the"
"level of functional Anatomy you're just"
"going to draw like here is this this"
"three-headed planarian"
"and uh if we knew what we were doing and"
"if we had a mature mature uh signs of"
"morphogenesis this system would be able"
"to compile that description into a set"
"of signals that would have to be given"
"to cells and caused them to build"
"whatever you wanted them to build to be"
"super clear this anatomical compiler is"
"not a 3D printer we are not talking"
"about micromanaging the position of all"
"the cells and and creating a 3D printed"
"ear or something like this well the the"
"anatomical compiler is a Communications"
"device it is a way to convert from from"
"from an anatomical specification to the"
"signals that have to be given to a"
"collective of cells to get them to build"
"something the way that they normally"
"build other things in in um in in"
"development and regeneration why do we"
"want this thing why do we want this"
"thing well"
"um all problems of biomedicine with the"
"exception of let's say infectious"
"disease boil down to the control of"
"collective cell Behavior if we had a way"
"of convincing cells to build anything an"
"arbitrary structure we would"
"automatically have the solutions to"
"birth defects to traumatic injury to"
"cancer to aging to degenerative disease"
"we could make a synthetic biobots on"
"demand all of these things would be"
"solved if we solved this simple problem"
"of how do you communicate to a"
"collective of cells what do you want"
"them to build now you might think that"
"so why don't we have this yet right"
"we've had all this incredible advance in"
"genomics and and molecular biology why"
"don't we have something like this well I"
"just want to show you a very simple"
"um example of a problem"
"here's a here's a basic uh Axolotl larva"
"baby Axolotl they have legs and so this"
"is a baby it's a salamander they they"
"have legs here is a frog larvae this is"
"a tadpole um of a xenopus frog they do"
"not have legs and so in our lab we can"
"do something which is make a chimeric"
"embryo we call it a frogalotel and uh I"
"can ask a simple question do you expect"
"the Frog aottle to have legs"
"and uh you have the genome so so we have"
"the genome for the axle we have the"
"genome for the Frog can you tell me if a"
"frog was going to have legs or not and"
"if it does have legs are those legs can"
"be made entirely of Axolotl cells or"
"will they have some frog cells included"
"so the so the so so unfortunately we"
"have absolutely no uh uh conceptual"
"um a framework that will allow you to"
"derive that information from the"
"genomics it's we just can't do it and so"
"so where we are today is is here we're"
"very good at manipulating molecules and"
"cells so Pathways genomic editing those"
"kind of things we're very good at that"
"but we're really quite a long way from"
"control of large-scale structure and"
"function which is really what we want so"
"what I would argue is that where we are"
"in biomedicine today is here it's where"
"computer science was in the 40s and 50s"
"where you had to interact with the"
"machine at the level of the hardware so"
"so crispr pathway a pathway editing"
"single molecule approaches protein"
"design all of that stuff all the most"
"exciting advances in in molecular"
"medicine are around the control of the"
"hardware and we know very well from the"
"information technology Revolution that"
"that's just the beginning and that what"
"we really want to understand is how to"
"take advantage of the higher level"
"uh uh affordances of of living bodies"
"and really really exploit uh what what"
"ends up being the agency of of uh of"
"cells and tissues as they solve various"
"problems and so that's I want to I want"
"to talk today about um those those kinds"
"of approaches so so I talk a lot about"
"competencies and intelligence and so"
"let's let's give a definition I like"
"this definition by William James which"
"is intelligence is the ability to reach"
"the same goal by different means so what"
"we're talking about here is uh again"
"when we say goal it we we don't mean"
"something that's a second order I I know"
"what my goal is I mean that's the humans"
"have that ability but you don't need"
"that uh it's the ability of some system"
"to exert energy to reach the same state"
"despite uh very in in various means now"
"why would there need to be various means"
"because there might be interferences of"
"some sort that prevent it from doing the"
"thing that it normally does and so the"
"degree of intelligence and the type of"
"intelligence that a system has is how it"
"handles those interventions what does it"
"what what abilities does it have to get"
"to where it needs to go"
"in its in its problem space despite"
"various interventions"
"um somebody once uh well I wish I could"
"remember who said this somebody had this"
"great quote where intelligence"
"is is a Continuum that makes the"
"difference between two magnets trying to"
"get together and Romeo and Julia trying"
"to get together right the difference is"
"simply in the degree of"
"um of of sophistication of things that"
"are going to happen when you try to"
"prevent them from reaching their goal in"
"one case uh very little sophistication"
"at all all they can do is try to"
"minimize the energy and in the other"
"case lots of sophisticated tricks to try"
"and get there so let's talk about this"
"kind of intelligence that's related to"
"uh biomedicine in particular so"
"development is incredibly reliable and"
"so we know that in embryo most of the"
"time gives rise to a normal very complex"
"body but it isn't hardwired and so if if"
"you cut this embryo in half you don't"
"get two half bodies you get two"
"perfectly normal monozygotic Twins and"
"that's because in this morphogenetic"
"state space the ability to reach its"
"goal this Ensemble of states that we"
"consider a normal uh healthy embryo you"
"can get there through uh from from a"
"variety of starting positions and in"
"fact as I'll show you momentarily by"
"avoiding various local Maxima of"
"avoiding local various various problems"
"and doing new things to get to where you"
"need to go so here's here's one of very"
"sort of well-known example this is a"
"salamander known as the Axolotl these"
"guys regenerate their limbs their eyes"
"their jaws their portions of their brain"
"and heart um and and here's what the"
"limbs look like if you amputate anywhere"
"along the axis of the limb it will"
"regenerate the cells will grow exactly"
"what's needed no more no less and give"
"you a complete perfect limb now the most"
"many amazing things about this but the"
"most amazing thing is that they know"
"when to stop these cells are growing no"
"individual cell knows what a finger is"
"or how many fingers you're supposed to"
"have but the collective makes exactly"
"the right number of fingers and then it"
"stops when when a correct salamander"
"limb has been completed and if you"
"deviate at that point and you cut off"
"some fingers and whatnot it will"
"continue to grow and it will only stop"
"when the correct pattern has has"
"completed so uh so so if if you if"
"you're into computer science this looks"
"like some sort of means ends analysis"
"and basically it's an error minimization"
"scheme that allows the system to detect"
"deviations from a from a stored set"
"point and and and and work and work"
"towards that now now salamanders aren't"
"the only ones that that have this human"
"liver for example is highly regenerative"
"um even the ancient Greeks knew that I"
"have no idea how they knew that uh human"
"children regenerate their fingertips uh"
"deer regenerate large amounts of bone of"
"vasculature and innervation every year"
"so so there's some some mammalian"
"examples of of regeneration but"
um
"here's one of the uh one of my uh kind"
"of uh kind of favorite favorite examples"
"because uh this this illustrates a very"
"interesting point uh that you can think"
"about as uh top down control so this is"
"this is the cross section through a um"
"through the Lumen of a of a of a"
"salamander and what you can see normally"
"is there's about eight there's about"
"eight to ten cells that"
"um uh"
"uh form this kind of um this kind of"
"structure and one thing you can do here"
"is that you can make"
"um you can make these cells larger uh"
"much much larger and when you do that"
"when you make them larger uh the system"
"adjusts and and a smaller number of"
"these large cells make the same shape"
"Lumen and now you can do the most"
"amazing thing of all which is to make"
"the cells uh incredibly large and when"
"you do that"
"um just one cell will wrap around itself"
"like this and form the exact same"
"structure now this is remarkable for a"
"couple of reasons uh one of them being"
"that this is a completely different"
"molecular mechanism in the first case"
"you have cell to cell communication and"
"and Delta Notch signaling all these"
"things that are important in in forming"
"um oh tubulogenesis in this case it's"
"cytoskeletal bending and so in the"
"service of a large-scale anatomical goal"
"State meaning that having a tubule of"
"the right shape and size different"
"molecular mechanisms different"
"underlying molecular mechanisms are"
"being called up to reach that state so"
"this is this if"
"um if you're if you're into Neuroscience"
"this is very familiar because in in"
"cognition you have you have this this"
"exact example we have large-scale uh"
"kind of executive control and and goal"
"directedness that has to feed down into"
"the individual"
"um uh circuits and eventually to to to"
"muscle uh voltage states to to execute"
"the problem it's a it's a top-down"
"control and it happens here in in"
"morphogenesis uh uh in this in this"
"amazing example so this is um this is a"
"different example that uh that we uh"
"discovered a few years ago which really"
"shows you uh uh the need to look for uh"
"competencies in unexpected places so"
"here again is our tapple here are some"
"eyes the nostrils the mouth is back here"
"the brain and uh these tadpoles have to"
"rearrange their face to become a normal"
"fraud and so it was thought that this"
"process is very mechanical so so every"
"normal tadpole looks the same every"
"normal frog looks the same and all then"
"you would have to do is somehow the"
"genome would just program a set of um uh"
"uh uh hardwired motions where every part"
"of the face would move in the right uh"
"in the right direction the right amount"
"and then you get a normal fraud from a"
"normal Capital so we we tested the"
"hypothesis and so I think this is really"
"critical before make taking any sort of"
"assumptions about what the level of"
"Competency of a system is you have to do"
"experiments and so we asked that we we"
"did this experiment we said um I wonder"
"if it really is hardwired let's what we"
"did was we made these called Picasso"
"tadpoles so basically they're scrambled"
"everything's in the wrong place the Jaws"
"are off to the side the eye might be on"
"top of the head everything's scrambled"
"and what we found is that these animals"
"make largely normal frogs why because"
"all of these organs will move around in"
"novel unnatural paths and in fact"
"sometimes go too far and actually have"
"to move backwards they have to they will"
"all move around until they get to a"
"correct frog pattern and then they stop"
"so the genetics does not specify somehow"
"a set of hardwired rearrangements what"
"it specifies is a system that is able to"
"reach the goal despite completely uh"
"abnormal unexpected starting positions"
"and this is very important Evolution and"
"I think this is a more General claim"
"that I would make is that Evolution"
"doesn't just make specific solutions to"
"specific problems it actually creates"
"Hardware that implements a"
"problem-solving machine that is able to"
exert
"problems of various kinds of information"
"processing to reach regions of"
"anatomical space physiological space and"
"so on despite novelty and I'll show you"
"a bunch of examples of that"
"um so what we started thinking about"
"then was was was this I mean this this"
"is the typical uh story that that"
"appears in the textbooks which is now"
"the process of morphogenesis is this you"
"have genes turning each other on and off"
"they make effector proteins there are"
"local interactions in terms of physics"
"and then eventually this this magical"
"process of emergence where complexity"
"arises from lots of simple local rules"
"now this is certainly true when there"
"are many systems where complexity arises"
"from simple rules but this is not the"
"end of the story and uh in in fact uh"
"this is this is I think just the not"
"even the major part of the story because"
"what we see now is that it is this this"
"process is not simply feed forward"
"emergent uh if this final form is"
"deviated from its uh from its goal state"
"by injury mutations teratogens whatever"
"what will happen is that"
uh
"feedback loops will kick in both at the"
"level of physics and at the level of"
"genetics which will uh which will"
"undergo various other actions to try and"
"get back to the state so this is very"
"much in the cybernetic sense this is"
"very much a goal directed system that"
"regeneration regulative development"
"metamorphosis all of these things uh are"
"are trying to get to specific regions of"
"anatomical amorphous space they exert"
"energy to do so and they have diverse"
"competencies more than just uh pre"
"um sort of sort of pre-wired kinds of"
"behaviors they exert various"
"competencies in order to do that now"
"uh this is this is uh on the one hand"
"this is uh nothing nothing too new"
"biologists are well aware of feedback"
"loops um in homeostatic uh kinds of"
"Loops like this so so pH temperature and"
"so on uh of course we know cells do this"
"but the interesting thing about this"
"process is that the set point for that"
"uh homeostatic process is not a scalar"
"it's not a single number it's not just"
"PA it's not not just pH or metabolic"
"level it is a uh an anatomical"
"descriptor so it's it's a it's a shape"
"so so that leg will continue to"
"regenerate until a correct salamander"
"leg has formed so in some sense"
"uh it is it is a descriptive of our"
"complex multicellular Anatomy here"
"that's that's driving this thing and so"
"this whole kind of uh odd view of of of"
"of looking at these at these systems as"
"navigational agents"
"um uh as opposed to just emergent uh"
"emergent physics and chemistry uh makes"
"a very strong prediction it suggests"
"that if there is an explicitly encoded"
"set point somewhere then we ought to be"
"able to find it so find the physical"
"mechanism of that encoding we ought to"
"be able to uh decode it and so to"
"understand to be able to read it out and"
"uh we ought to be able to rewrite it to"
"re-specify it and and that's what that's"
"what we've been doing"
"um and I'll show you I'll show you how"
"that works uh one of the sort of"
"conceptual uh implications of this is"
"really important it means that if this"
"is true then"
"we have the ability on a biomedical"
"level to rewrite that set point without"
"having to change the machine in other"
"words the the the amazing thing about"
"your thermostat in your house is that"
"you can change the set point without"
"needing to rewire the thermostat the"
"hardware stays exactly the same but you"
"can make it do new things and computers"
"of course are are reprogrammable and"
"that's that's the beauty of it you can"
"run multiple things on the same Hardware"
"uh currently molecular medicine is is"
"all about this portion that is uh if you"
"want to make a change here we have to"
"figure out which genes we would need to"
"let's say crispr um to make that change"
"happen and in general moving backwards"
"this is an incredibly difficult inverse"
"problem that's going to limit the"
"applications of of crispr and genome"
"editing Technologies because in general"
"you cannot reverse this we have no idea"
"what genes to change if you wanted a"
"salamander with um three-fold symmetry"
"instead of bilateral symmetry genes"
"would you change we have we have no idea"
"so so it would be really nice to to if"
"it were true that uh Collective cellular"
"collectives had a set point you could"
"change the set point and uh it would"
"then do uh it would then build you"
"wouldn't have to solve this terrible"
"inverse problem so um how does the brain"
"handle a goal directed navigation in uh"
"in its problem space well uh of course"
"uh it's got this Hardware where um uh"
"individual cells have these little ION"
"channel proteins that enable the cell to"
"reach a resting potential and those"
"potentials are propagated to their"
"neighbors through these Gap Junctions"
"they have this electrical Network and"
"that electrical Network that that"
"Hardware allows a certain um a set of"
"Behavioral software where and here you"
"can actually see the readout in this"
"this group did this amazing um uh video"
"of the electrical activity in the living"
"zebrafish brain and so Neuroscience is"
"committed to this idea that all of the"
"cognitive content of this of the system"
"of this mind is uh encoded in the this"
"physiology and in this electrical"
"activity that if we were able to read"
"and understand basically decode this is"
"what people work on neural decoding if"
"we could decode the this this electrical"
"activity we would know what the memories"
"the goals the capacities of the of the"
"system are so the good news is that this"
"amazing uh architecture right of this"
"hardware and software is extremely"
"ancient in fact it's as old as bacterial"
"biofilms most cells have uh electrical"
"connections with each other all cells"
"have ion channels that set their"
"electrical State and what you can do is"
"you can you can you can run a a very"
"parallel kind of research program uh"
"using this all of the techniques from"
"from uh from uh"
"computational Neuroscience to try and"
"decode the uh information processing of"
"the body cells as they try to solve"
"anatomical problems"
"um and here and here it is parallel to"
"this brain scan this is uh this is a"
"frog embryo putting its um putting"
"itself together and you can see we can"
"we can now image all the electrical uh"
"States as this happens and try to decode"
"them so the"
"um isomorphism is very strong because"
"because here what you have here is uh"
"the the DNA which determines the micro"
"level Hardware this becomes an excitable"
"medium which has uh the ability to uh to"
"have a certain uh certain electrical I"
believe
"um implemented the information"
"processing tasks and what it does is it"
"controls it makes decisions to At Large"
"Scale decisions to control muscles to"
"move you through three-dimensional space"
"that same architecture exists in your"
"body it's extremely ancient both"
"evolutionarily and developing monthly"
"and what it does is use the exact same"
"kind of tricks so the DNA specifies the"
"the channels but then you get this"
"excitable medium that is able to have"
"memories and decision making"
"um at the level of the network and what"
"it does issue commands to all kinds of"
"cells not just muscles and those"
"commands move your body configuration"
"through morphe space that process takes"
"you from the shape of of an egg in an"
"early embryo through a progressive"
"stages and if you're a caterpillar"
"further through metamorphosis to become"
"a butterfly and and and and so on so uh"
"the exact same thing what evolution does"
"is Pivot the same trick this of this"
"ability of electrical networks to"
"process information and to integrate"
"information through different problem"
"spaces starting off with uh with with"
"with metabolic and then moving forward"
"into into anatomical and eventually"
"behavioral and eventually linguistic in"
"the case of humans so we developed some"
"tools to study all of this so so here's"
"a time lapse movie of the Frog embryo"
"this is done using a voltage sensitive"
"fluorescent dye so this was um this this"
"technique was was developed by Danny"
"Adams to uh look uh to to help uh uh"
"characterize what the what the cells are"
"saying to each other we also do a lot of"
"computational modeling to link to the"
"molecular biology what ion channels and"
"pumps and GAP Junctions are responsible"
"for these for these things and I want to"
"show you two um I want to show you two"
"uh kinds of patterns so so this is we"
"call this the electric face uh"
"this is one frame taken from a from a"
"voltage movie of a of a frog embryo"
"putting its face together and what you"
"see is that long before the genes turn"
"on to actually become uh to actually"
"regionalize and then implement the face"
"Anatomy you already can read out the"
"pattern memory that tells these cells"
"what to do here's where the mouth is"
"going to go here's where the eye is"
"going to go the other eye will come"
"later uh to you know the placards out"
"here all this this pattern is already"
"there we know this pattern is"
"instructive because if you move any of"
"this and I'll show you in a minute How"
"We Do how we do it the gene expression"
"moves in and the anatomy moves we'll"
"show you that so so this is a normal"
"pattern that's required for face"
"development this is a"
"uh pathological pattern that occurs when"
"you imply uh inject a human oncogenes"
"into an embryo eventually they'll make a"
"tumor but before that uh that uh tumor"
"is is uh um histologically apparent you"
"can already see from the cells aberrant"
"voltage signature that they've"
"disconnected from the electrical network"
"of the rest of the body they have their"
"own weirdly depolarized voltage they're"
"basically like amoebas at that point"
"they're just going to uh uh treat the"
"rest of the body as external environment"
"this is metastasis they've rolled back"
"to their individual unicellular past so"
"um so how do we um how do we do these"
"kinds of experiments we've borrowed a"
"lot of tools from Neuroscience we do not"
"use there are no applied Fields no"
"electrodes no radiation no"
"electromagnetic radiation nothing like"
"that this is this is manipulating the"
"native interface the native"
"bioelectrical interface that cells"
"exposed to each other to enable them to"
"program each other's activity"
"collectively so what those are are own"
"channels and GAP Junctions so we can use"
"the all of the techniques from"
"Neuroscience so we can we could mutate"
"the channels to give them new properties"
"we can put in new channels we can block"
"channels pharmacologically we can do it"
"with light so optogenetics all the same"
"tools it's very interesting that neither"
"the tools nor the concepts of"
"Neuroscience can tell the difference"
"between brains and other tissue so all"
"of the stuff works so so we do we we"
"steal everything from neuroscientists"
"all the neurotransmitter machinery and"
"drugs optogenetics active inference"
"perceptual by stability you name it all"
"of these concepts are directly"
"transferable because the difference"
"between uh between other cells and"
"neurons are there are some important"
"differences but but but all of them are"
"capable of the key thing which is to"
"make these electrically active"
"information processing Networks"
"so um let me give you some examples of"
"what happens when you make some of these"
"changes so so one thing you can do is we"
"can micro inject into this frog embryo"
"some RNA that encodes an ion Channel"
"let's say a potassium ion channel that"
"will set the same electrical state that"
"we observed in the eye field in that"
"electrical face uh the the embryo the"
"the electrical the electric face"
"scenarios when you do this uh this what"
"you've communicated to the cells is that"
"they should form an eye and you can do"
"this to cells in the gut on the tail"
"anywhere not just in the anterior and"
"the rectoderm where the textbooks tell"
"you are the only cells competent to make"
"eyes that's actually not true if you go"
"further up the chain of command and and"
uh
"edit the bioelectrical pattern uh in any"
"any cells in the body in the in the in"
"this body will make a will make a"
"complete eye these eyes have all the"
"right layers of retina optic nerve core"
"you know uh um all the all the stuff is"
"here notice"
"um a couple of interesting features here"
"one feature is that what we have not"
"done is reprogrammed specific stem cells"
"for specific Fates we could we we put in"
"a very simple signal we don't try to"
"micromanage the cells uh this is"
"basically a subroutine call we're"
"communicating to the collective that it"
"should uh that that the eye uh state is"
"what it should what it should make we"
"are not trying to"
"um micromanage uh the uh the individual"
"cells and so this is modularity this is"
"this is really like a subroutine code we"
"should say build an eye here the cell"
"the the all the downstream Cascades"
"turned on after that the second uh"
"amazing um competency that these cells"
"have is they can do uh What uh ants and"
"termites do which is recruitment so"
"um here is uh here's a lens this this"
"ectopic lens is sitting out in the flank"
"of a of a tail somewhere these blue"
"cells are the ones that we've actually"
"injected with ion channels but there's"
"not enough of them to make a proper lens"
"and so what they do is they recruit"
"their neighbors these other Brown cells"
"that are completely wild type there's no"
"extra Channel there but they're"
"recruited by these cells and secondarily"
"so those two levels of instruction we"
"instruct these cells hey make an eye"
"these cells instruct their neighbors"
"there's not enough of us you've got to"
"help and so they have the ability to"
"detect whether or what there's enough of"
"them to um to to to do the to do the"
"task and if there's not they have the"
"ability to to to instruct their"
"neighbors to join in and these are these"
"are cells that otherwise would have made"
"uh but pieces of the tail"
"and so and so these are some some really"
"interesting capacities of this of the"
"cellular Collective to get its job done"
"uh we can make um so so in addition to"
"eyes we can make extra limbs uh here you"
"can make extra four brains you can make"
"extra Hearts we can make otisists or"
"inner ear organs or you can make fins"
"now that's interesting because tadpoles"
"don't have fins that's more of a fish"
"thing we'll get to that momentarily but"
"so so targeted Mis expression of ion"
"channels meaning creating a new"
"bioelectrical state calls up different"
"organs you can not individual cell"
"States but actual organs and we can take"
"advantage of this biomedically for"
"example here's a frog frogs normally do"
"not regenerate their legs so if the leg"
"is lost 45 days later there's nothing"
"going on here there's a cross-section we"
"came up with a cocktail uh and this is"
"uh this is the work of Kelly Chang in my"
"lab who uh uh basically uh created a"
"cocktail that is that that triggers uh"
"regeneration decision in this wound"
"24-hour treatment and then legs grow for"
"up to a year and a half and we never"
"touch them during that point but but"
"after after 24 hours already you already"
"the signals have been passed to convince"
"the cells that this is the path through"
"amorphous space they should be taking"
"not towards scarring but towards"
"regeneration and so immediately uh you"
"turn on these um msx1 which are these"
"pro pro with pro-regenerative Gene uh by"
"45 days you already have some toes"
"you've got a toenail up here and"
"eventually a very respectable frog leg"
"that is touch sensitive and motile"
"meaning it's functional so the idea for"
"regenerative medicine is that we should"
"be looking for triggers for for ways to"
"communicate to the cells what structure"
"they should be building not trying to"
"micromanage the process the the you know"
"the whole the whole time and so I have"
"to do a disclosure here because uh David"
"Kaplan and I are scientific co-founders"
"of a company called morpheuticals Inc"
"which seeks to now take those"
"discoveries and move them into mammalian"
"and so so we're doing this now in in"
rodents
"um hoping to learn to do organ"
"regeneration and and ultimately of"
"course the human patients some someday"
so
"um I want to switch a little bit to this"
uh
"to this other model system these"
"planarian and as I've told you the"
"planaria are amazing they're so good at"
"repairing body damage they do this"
"continuously they're actually Immortal"
"there's no such thing as an old"
"planarian they continuously replace"
"dying cells and uh and as a result the"
"individual worms are basically Immortal"
"and the amazing thing"
"uh about that is that when you cut them"
"into pieces each piece needs to know"
"what it's missing and what needs to be"
"rebuilt so that anatomical control that"
"makes them cancer resistant and Immortal"
"and so on needs to be able to to always"
"recognize what part needs to go where"
"and so typically it's 100 reliable if I"
"amputate The Head and the tail and I"
"take this this so this uh this middle"
"fragment it will give rise to a"
"perfectly normal one-headed form now"
"um one of the interesting things that we"
"found is that there's an electrical"
"circuit in this fragment that determines"
"how many heads and how many Tails it's"
"supposed to have that's the memory the"
"memory is literally electrical and and"
"so uh what we can do is we can take this"
"this one-headed animal with normal uh"
"transcriptional profiles so the anterior"
"genes are in the head not in the tail"
"and when you amputate this guy he gives"
"rise to a two-headed worm this is not"
"Photoshop these are real animals why"
"would I just told you that it's"
"completely that it's a 100 Fidelity why"
"would it give rise to a two-headed worm"
"well uh that's because what we first did"
"was to uh use drugs that Target ion"
"channels and the Gap Junctions to reset"
"the electrical pattern memory and this"
"is normal this is what the fragment"
"normally has one head one tail we can"
"reset that to say two heads and you can"
"see it's kind of messy where the"
"technology is still being worked out but"
"uh but we can reset this pattern to be"
"two heads and then when you cut then it"
"makes a two-headed animal now here's the"
"really critical part this Electrical uh"
"um electrical map is not a map of this"
"two-headed animal this is an electrical"
"map of this perfectly anatomically"
"normal one-headed animal"
"it's their latent memory meaning it"
"doesn't do anything until we injure it"
"and when you injure it that's when the"
"cells consult this map and this and and"
"realize they need to make two heads and"
"that's what they do so a single body a"
"single one-headed planarian body can"
"store one of two different"
"representations of what a correct"
"planarian looks like I promised you at"
"the beginning that if we have this"
"homeostatic Loop you have to store the"
"set point somewhere somewhere you have"
"to say what the correct information is"
"how does it know what's correct this is"
"how that information is stored in"
"electrical memories that we can actually"
"now read out and edit and write to some"
"extent much like people are trying to"
"incept false memories into brains"
"uh so another kind of neat thing about"
"this is that if you're interested in the"
"brain and uh this ability they call it"
"mental time travel the ability to"
"remember things or imagine things that"
"are not true right now right so the"
"ability of a system to to store states"
"that are not actually true right now"
"um that time shifting that's what you"
"see here this this electrical memory is"
"a counter factual it is not a true"
"description of what my anatomy looks"
"like it is a counterfactual memory of"
"what I will do if I get injured in the"
"future okay it's a memory of of uh it's"
"it's a it's basically a plan for the"
"future it's a very primitive way of"
"doing counterfactual memories that might"
be
"um the kind of evolutionary precursor to"
"to to complex counterfactual thought in"
brains
"now why do I keep calling this a memory"
"because if you"
um
"if you cut these two-headed animals and"
"you take this this uh this this middle"
"middle fragment with no more"
"manipulation it will continue to form"
"two-headed animals now keep in mind"
"there's no genetic uh there's no there's"
"been no genetic change here we haven't"
"Rewritten The genome the hardware is"
"exactly the same what we've done is"
"given it a brief physiological stimulus"
"that altered the memory of what this uh"
"of what the set point for this"
"regenerative process is so the question"
"of what determines the number of heads"
"in a planarian is kind of subtle it"
"isn't the DNA what the DNA does is"
"produce an electrical machine that by"
"default stably settles on the memory of"
"a one-headed uh structure but it's"
"rewritable and it has memory and once"
"you rewrite it to a two-headed State"
"that's what it keeps and we do have a"
"way of actually turning them back so we"
"can take these two-headed animals and uh"
"rewrite the memory back to a one-handed"
"so so here you are you see it you see a"
"video of what these guys are doing uh"
"this is all the properties of memory"
"it's long-term stable it's rewritable it"
"has conditional recall which I just"
"showed you and it has discrete discrete"
"behaviors and so um what we uh are are"
"doing now and um uh this is you know"
"we're very interested in collaborations"
"and then srini and I are collaborating"
"on these kinds of things is to uh"
"take what we know about the uh the state"
"space of these electrical circuits and"
"map them to anatomical outcomes which"
"are attractors in this morphe space and"
"understand how that process gives rise"
"to the these kinds of amazing abilities"
"such as uh if the system is deviated it"
"comes back it recovers missing"
"information these are all things that"
"people who study uh uh artificial neural"
"networks and connectionist models of"
"cognition these are all things that"
"people study and so we want to we want"
"to um you know kind of integrate uh"
"integrate that field interestingly this"
"is not just about head"
"a number it's also about shape so if we"
"perturb the electrical Network in this"
"in this guy when he tries to regenerate"
"his head you can get the same genetics"
"to form a flat-headed pflena or a"
"round-headed s Mediterranean uh with and"
"and the distance between this guy and"
"these species is about 100 to 150"
"million years"
"so what you can do by by by changing uh"
"the electrical pattern memories is to"
"select between attractors in the state"
"space that normally correspond to other"
"species one way that could have happened"
"is that is genetic assimilation so so"
"um and then a a bioelectric"
"environmentally induced by Electric"
"change that causes head shape change"
"that then eventually ends up being"
"assimilated into the genome as changes"
"in ION channel properties and whatever"
"so Evolution might use this very rapid"
"it's akin to the Baldwin effect when"
"learning becomes eventually assimilated"
"into genetic behaviors"
"uh Evolution could could make use of"
"this very powerful mechanism and in fact"
"um and so so it's not just the head"
"shape right it's the it's the shape of"
"the brain and the and the distribution"
"of stem cells is exactly like these"
"other species so you're literally making"
"a head of another species it's not even"
"about existing other species you can"
"make uh shapes that uh don't belong to"
"any species so the morphe space of"
"possible shapes is quite large you can"
"make uh these spiky forms you can make"
"this cylindrical kind of"
"three-dimensional thing you can make"
"combination forms"
"Evolution doesn't use it presumably"
"these don't make very successful worms"
"but the cells the the hardware the"
"genetically specified Hardware of a wild"
"type genome is perfectly happy to uh to"
"form these other uh these other um these"
"other forms so what we're looking for is"
"a full stack uh kind of uh a framework"
"in which we can start from knowing what"
"the channels and pumps are that"
"determine the hardware of the cells but"
"then we can now start to understand on a"
"tissue level the change is in the"
"bioelectric large scale properties"
"getting to what does that mean for organ"
"specification and ultimately getting to"
a
"kind of a symbolic algorithm of the"
"decision making at the Oregon level"
"about where heads and tails and all the"
"other organs go and we have this we"
"we've started work on this bioelectrical"
"simulator so Alexis pytek has made this"
"amazing system that allows us to"
"actually simulate um some of this stuff"
"and and Link chemical networks with the"
"electrical Downstream electrical"
"information processing I want to show"
"you one a quick uh success case of using"
"such a thing for biomedicine this is a"
"tadpole brain forebrain midbrain"
hindbrain
"in animals that are exposed to"
"teratogens like nicotine or um uh uh"
"other other alcohol other other kinds of"
"teratogens there are severe brain"
"defects and we said okay could we make a"
"computational model of the bioelectric a"
"pattern of a normal brain and uh show"
"what happens to that pattern under"
"various deformations so we made this"
"pattern and and it showed us some really"
"interesting um some really interesting"
"uh features of why things go wrong and"
"what that model was able to do is then"
"say okay uh if that's what happens to"
"the electrical pattern uh could we what"
"would we need to do to fix it so which"
"channels and pumps could be open or"
"closed to to get back to the correct by"
"electrical pattern even though you were"
"exposed to this nasty teratogen and in"
"fact we we did it we did this with um uh"
"with even a genetic change which is a"
"mutation and Notch so Notch is a very"
"important neurogenesis Gene in the"
"absence of"
"and proper Notch function the forebrain"
"is missing the midbrain and hindbrain"
"are just a big bubble the animals have"
"no Behavior it's it's a very severe"
"defect what the computational model was"
"able to do is pick out a channel for us"
"specifically this hcn2 ION channel"
"that's some interesting properties in"
"the and the model the computer model was"
"what told us that if we uh turn on this"
"channel the the bioelectric state should"
"basically come back to normal and when"
"we and when we did that and you can do"
"this either genetically or through um a"
"couple of drugs that are already human"
"approved drugs that Target hcn2 they uh"
"these animals went back to normal they"
"had so so these animals have the same"
"Notch mutation but you can see the the"
"brain structure is normal their behavior"
"their IQs are in in distinguishable from"
"controls they get their behaviors back"
"so this is an amazing thing not only is"
"the are we now to the point where a"
"computational platform can actually"
"predict Therapeutics by by"
"quantitatively asking what does the"
"bioelectric change need to be and then"
"what drugs do we have that will induce"
"that change"
"but this is an example of fixing a"
"hardware defect so the notch mutation"
"fixing a hardware defect in software by"
"by brief stimulation of the physiology"
"with a drug so I now I'm not arguing"
"that that's going to be true always"
"there are many Hardware defects let's"
"say um enzyme mutations and so on that"
"are not fixable this way but uh but it"
"is it is remarkable that some some"
"genetic um defects can actually be"
"repaired this way so what we are working"
"on is this uh is this kind of a system"
"um that basically uh it's it's a it's a"
"and and you can you can you can you can"
"play around with this thing a little bit"
"although it's a very early stage still"
"the idea is that uh you should be able"
"to take your knowledge of the correct"
"and the incorrect state run it the model"
"will tell you which ion channels and"
"pumps can be targeted we know uh what"
"what the drugs that exist for all these"
"different channels and it should"
"basically suggest uh electrosuticals so"
"so combinations of drugs to address"
"different kinds of problems with um you"
"know cancer"
"repair of injury birth defects and so on"
"and so just for the last couple of"
"minutes I want to um uh say a couple of"
"quick things about uh coming back to"
"this idea of let's let's zoom out from"
"the biomedicine and and just think about"
"what we've learned about uh about"
"intelligence and and cognition"
"um we know that this thing uh has"
"competencies in a certain very small uh"
"cognitive light cone basically uh local"
"environment is what it cares about it"
"has cells have a little bit of memory"
"going back a little bit of predictive"
"power going looking forward in the"
"future but basically both spatially and"
"temporally the goals that this system"
"pursues are very small"
"um what evolution did is is create a set"
"of uh policies for electricals networks"
"that allow them to pursue much bigger"
"goals so this Collective pursues the"
"goal of having this anatomical State and"
"uh you can deviate it and we'll do its"
"best to get back there individual cells"
"have no idea what a finger is or how"
"many you should have but the collective"
"does and and it's the and it's the"
"network that's able to do this but it"
"has a failure mode the failure mode is"
cancer
"and when cells disconnect from this"
"electrical Network this is glioblastoma"
"they basically roll back to these"
"individual cell behaviors and their"
"light cone shrinks okay and so we can"
"think about"
"um uh the scaling up of cognition from"
"Individual cells that have a very small"
"spatio temporal uh cognitive capacity to"
"larger larger networks that have more"
"computational capacity for memory for"
"prediction and for integrating spatially"
"information across a distance this has a"
"very clear biomedical uh testable"
"biomedical prediction which is that"
"um well here's our here's our uh our our"
"tumors induced by human oncogenes what"
"we can do is we can say we're not going"
"to change the hardware we're going to"
"leave the the hardware defect in we're"
"not going to remove the cells or or try"
"to fix the the genetic mutation what we"
"will do is force these cells to be in"
"normal electrical communication with"
"each other and so when we inject the"
"oncogene what we also inject is a uh an"
"ion channel that that despite what the"
"oncogen does which is to electrically"
"decouple the cells it will um cause them"
"to stay connected so this is this is the"
"oncoprotein here it's very strongly"
"expressed in fact it's all over the"
"place but there's no tumor this is the"
"same animal there's no tumor because"
"um the physiology overrides the genetics"
"some some Hardware defects can be fixed"
"in software so if you connect these"
"cells to the group they will not have"
"the metastatic single cell goal pursuing"
"Behavior they will work on a collective"
"project making nice skin nice nice"
"muscle underneath all that stuff"
"so you can see how these these ideas of"
"cognitive scaling lead directly to novel"
"therapeutic approaches that that had"
"never been been tried before so um the"
"last two minutes or so I just want to"
"show you one one uh amazing um kind of"
"example of cellular uh competencies and"
"plasticity we wanted to know whether"
"cells could reboot their"
"multicellularity and what their novel"
"goals would be if we took them out of"
"their normal context and so this is the"
"work I have to do a disclosure um uh"
"Josh Baumgart and I have founded this"
"this company for a computer designed by"
"robotics this is all everything I'm"
"going to show you is done in in"
"collaboration with the bongard lab and"
"uh Doug Blackiston in my group did all"
"the all the biology and Sam kriegman did"
"the the computer science aspects"
"and so what we did was we uh so so Doug"
"takes these these frog embryos he takes"
"the skin cells from the top these are"
"these are cells Theta to be uh to be"
"epidermis so so skin and he we"
"dissociate them and then and then uh"
"just uh pipette them down into this"
"little little depression what might they"
"do well they might die they might spread"
"out they might form a two-dimensional"
"monolayer many things they could do what"
"they do instead is oops"
"they uh overnight"
um
"they uh they coalesce together like this"
"and they form uh they form this little"
"thing we call a xenobot here it is we"
"call it a xenobot because xenopus lavis"
"is the name of the frog and it's a"
"biorobotics platform so it's a biobot"
"one thing these xenobots do is they swim"
"they move um how do they do it they have"
"little hairs called cilia on the outside"
"of their bodies normally the Cilia are"
"used to redistribute mucus down uh the"
"the body of the Frog"
"um but here what they do is they row and"
"the ones on this side row this way the"
"ones on this side road that way and so"
"the thing moves on its own it's a"
"completely spontaneous we don't Pace it"
"we don't activate it it's on its own"
"they have a wide variety of behaviors"
"they can go in circles they can Patrol"
"back and forth like this just keep in"
"mind uh this is skin there's no neurons"
"here there's nothing else"
"um they have some collective behaviors"
"so these two can interact with each"
"other uh these are resting doing nothing"
"this one is going kind of on a long"
journey
"um here it is navigating a maze so it"
"moves forward uh it takes the turn"
"without bumping into anything doesn't"
"have to bump into the opposite side it"
"takes the corner and then at this point"
"due to some internal Dynamic it turns"
"around and goes backwards came from uh"
"no no control by us this is completely"
"spontaneous behavior of these guys"
"um if you if you image the signaling"
"this is calcium signaling it's very uh"
"this is the kind of thing you would see"
"in uh in imaging brain activity and so"
"we are now of course uh analyzing using"
"information Theory approaches uh what"
"the integrated information is inside or"
"or in fact between are they"
"communicating we don't know yet well"
"that that remains to be determined um"
"they can regenerate so if you cut them"
"in half here so think about you can you"
"can cut them almost in half look at the"
"amazing force that it takes to uh to to"
"to fold this thing uh fold this thing up"
"like that so they do regenerate and then"
"here's the most um uh uh surprising uh"
"thing of all"
"which is uh by modeling so so Sam and"
"Josh computationally model this and"
"basically evolved in an AI kind of um"
"environment uh used used evolutionary"
"algorithms to evolve different kinds of"
"xenobot shapes and and simulate their"
"activity and one thing that we learned"
"is that they like to make piles they"
"they like to find loose material and"
"collect it into um into into piles and"
"so we we chat we tested whether that"
"would be true of real Bots we gave them"
"a bunch of uh loose materials so these"
"are cells these white things are just uh"
"uh loose skin cells and we found"
"something incredible is that yeah in"
"fact in fact they run around and they"
"collect these these cells and they"
"collect them into piles and they Compact"
"and the piles become the next generation"
"of xenobots which then mature and go on"
"to do exactly the same thing so they"
"just continue to make uh to reproduce"
"copies of themselves now a couple of"
"interesting things first the only reason"
"this works is because the xenobots like"
"us and like Evolution are working within"
"a gentle material they're not working"
"with passive particles they're working"
"with an agential material that also"
"knows how to cooperate with each other"
"to become something interesting meaning"
"another zenobot so this is um this is"
"this is taking advantage of that"
"agential capacity of the Bots uh the"
"second thing is that this is Von"
"Neumann's dream a a a robot that's able"
"to go out and make copies of itself by"
"finding objects in its environment so uh"
"this is a very early form of that"
"there's no strong heredity here all the"
"all the Bots look the same but but they"
"do replicate and so this is we call this"
"kinematic uh kinematic self-replication"
"we've made it impossible possible for"
"these guys to replicate in the normal"
"froggy fashion but within 48 hours they"
"they they they are able to do this and"
"so the last thing I want to I want to"
"just discuss is the kind of evolutionary"
"implications of this this is a normal"
"frog with a normal frog genome uh when"
"you ask what does this genome encode"
"it's it's common to think well it"
"encodes a frog but actually what it"
"encodes is a a little a little machine"
"that can under normal circumstances it"
"has a default frog developmental stages"
"and normal tadpole behaviors but under"
"other circumstances it can be a xenobot"
"it can form uh the xenobot it has its"
"own developmental stages who knows what"
"this is this is a completely novel thing"
"and then and then they have their own"
"different xenobot behaviors now we"
"didn't add anything to go from here to"
"here we didn't add any any new genes we"
"didn't add synthetic circuits no weird"
"Nano materials uh all we did was was"
"engineer by subtraction"
"meaning that we removed some other cells"
"and we we asked what is the native"
"behavior of these cells because if you"
"look at a typical embryo skin you would"
"say that what does it uh what does it"
"know how to do uh well it knows how to"
"how to be a boring two-dimensional um"
"layer on the outside of the um uh on the"
"outside of the of the embryo but that's"
"because the other cells are basically"
"bullying these cells of the behavior"
"shaping these cells into doing that on"
"their own left of their own devices this"
"is what they actually do this is the"
"default Behavior so you can imagine"
"Evolution as searching this uh space of"
"um Behavior shaping signals that cells"
"will send each other to get them to do"
"what they want what you know what to get"
"them to do something something adaptive"
"this is the default behavior of those"
"cells and the final thing is this uh"
"when we think about why does a certain"
"organism have certain shapes behaviors"
"properties the answer is usually well"
"Evolution because because eons of"
"selection have have given at these"
"particular goal States in anatomical"
"space and behavioral space and"
"morphological space and and so on but"
"actually uh there's never been any"
"xenobots and there's never been any"
"selection to be a good xenobi so this is"
"the these you you there's no"
"straightforward selection story that"
"explains these behaviors so we have to"
"start thinking differently about where"
"goals in these spaces come from and I"
"think that's that's very interesting um"
"and we don't know what the cognitive"
"capacities of these guys are yet we're"
"working to understand what can they"
"sense what are their preferences what"
"can they learn and so on so I'll just"
"stop here by saying that"
"um all of this is uh the the conceptual"
"stuff is discussed in these papers which"
"I'm happy to send to anybody I want to"
"thank uh the the postdocs and"
