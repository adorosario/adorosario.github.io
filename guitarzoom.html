<p>Hey Steve here. And today we're going to be talking about learning how to play standing U. Now it seems pretty obvious
but there are some things that you need to think about for the most comfort. And I know this because you know playing in
bands and things like that like I I have a an unfortunate sense of I wouldn't say it's OCD but I like things to be
particular all the time. You can certainly ask my wife about that and guitar straps are one of those really weird things
where it's. Very, very, very important that the guitar sit at a proper level for me to be able to do the things that I
want to do. If the guitar strap is not at the right place in terms of height, it throws me off, it throws my playing
off, it throws everything off. And so that's why I thought it'd be nice to talk about this a little bit. So maybe you're
new to playing standing up, maybe these are things you haven't really thought about before. But so the first thing to do
is we're going to talk about the guitar strap itself. Now, I grew up in the days. With strap locks. So a lot of my old
guitars, you know, guitars that I've had for a long time, all have these strap locks that I've replaced. And the nice
thing about strap locks is that when you put a strap lock on and then you put the guitar on the guitar. There'd be far
less chance of the guitar ever falling where if you just use a regular guitar strap and put it on, you'll notice
sometimes maybe the whole of the guitar strap is really loose and you know the guitar could fall when you're playing
that sort of thing. And that's like not something that you want to have happen. So I used to always reconfigure these,
put strap locks on, but I haven't done that in the last. Eight years, um. Maybe not that long, but quite a long time.
And the reason being is because now they've come U with guitar straps that have a lock built into them. O again, this
isn't a sales presentation, I'm just telling you the truth of the reason I use these. It makes my life easier because
like let's say you you're playing on stage and you bring three guitars, right? And two of the guitars have strap blocks
but one of the guitars doesn't have strap locks. Well then you need to make sure that you're you know that one guitar
has a different guitar strap. And the other two right. And if you're running a wireless system and your wireless system
is taped onto your guitar strap, well now you have a problem because you'd have to replace the strap locks and on the
other guitar, so you could use the same strap all the way through. So it just becomes a hassle. And with this, it
eliminates the problem because it doesn't matter what kind of peg there is it'll use, it'll work with anything. So these
are made by Daddario, and what they do is they have this little this little clamp. That goes on there. That goes around
the peg and then it locks into place so it won't come off. And it doesn't need to be a strap lock. It can be just a
regular peg and it'll go on just fine and it'll lock on there. You know, I suppose if you have one of those giant ones,
which I don't even see those on guitars anymore, but if you had something like that, you know, maybe this wouldn't work.
But 99% of every kind of peg that you'd have, this will lock right on there. OK. So that's the first thing to understand
about it. The second thing is, is that when you're playing. Sitting down, if you've played sitting down for a long time,
you've got comfortable with the guitar sitting right here relative to you. Your body, your leg, your, your, your, your
stomach, all that kind of stuff. The guitar sits right here. And you've found a way of making this feel comfortable. O
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to stand U and I'm going to put the guitar strap on and we're going to talk about
this a little bit. OK? OK. So we're going to be standing up playing here. And so I just want to show you a couple
things. So here's ideally where I would like my guitar strap to be in terms of length. And once I've found that, we're
going to talk about this because I'm going to switch this. I want to just mark this. So a lot of times what I'll do
again. Because I am a bit obsessive about this kind of stuff is I'll just make a small mark on the guitar strap with,
you know, it might be a piece of tape, it might be a marker or something like that, but just something that kind of
tells me where the ideal spot is for that guitar strap. OK, and again, you don't have to do that, but that's something
that I'll wind up doing quite a bit. So now I've got this little mark on the guitar strap here that I'm going to use.
And So what I'm going to do is I'm going to open this up. And make this a lot longer than I want it to be for a reason O
let me grab a guitar. All right, so when you put this on, the first thing you want to do is make sure that when you put
this on, the looped side goes behind you, not in front of you. OK, now again, other guitar straps might be a little bit
different, and then this one will lock in underneath here, OK. Right there. So now when I put this on, we want to go the
other way here. Here we go. When I put this on, it's going to be. Pretty good. Let's make that a little longer here so
you can kind of see my point. O I'm going to make that longer. There we go. Now when it gets to be a little bit longer
like this, it looks great, OK. And again, it all depends on what's comfortable for you. It all depends on your height
and comfortability and all that kind of stuff. You know, your arm length and all those things kind of come into play
there. So if I was playing like this, it would look great, OK. The problem is, is when I go to play, if I was going to
try and place some things like U in here, my wrist isn't going to be able to reach this. As cool as it looks. And this
is where the problem is. As cool as it looks, there's only so much that I can actually do OK. Like if I wanted to do
like there's a lot of stuff that I do with like arpeggios and things like that, and my wrist is literally just locked
this direction to try and play like this. Now if my arms were longer or whatever it might be, maybe that would work
great, but that's not going to work. For me, OK so. The balance is understanding that, especially if you're new to this.
Don't worry about what it looks like, worry about what it feels like. And then if you need to battle the well, I need to
look cooler thing. That's that's an internal thing that you're going to have to deal with. But if you start off learning
how to play guitar, standing up with the guitar way too low. The problem is, is that your ability to play the guitar is
going to be hindered because the guitar is sitting. You know, if you thought about it, if I was sitting down, it'd be up
here. Well, now it's down here, it's in a completely different spot. Right. So that's going to be tough. Now, if I was
just playing chords and things like that, this would be just fine. Or maybe some basic kind of, you know, pentatonic
store sorts of things where I don't really have to go to these strings very often or something. Maybe that would be OK.
That isn't the way that I play, so this isn't going to work OK. So that means that what I need to do is I need to find
that comfort zone now just to make things quicker here. I'm going to take that guitar off. And I'm going to raise this
up now. I've already made that little mark as I explained to you before. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to raise
this until I find that little mark. OK. So. And there it is right there. So I can go right to that little mark. With
this guitar strap. There it is. Now you can't see it, but it's on there. There we go. And now this strap is exactly
where I left it last time. And you're going to notice. That the guitar is going to be sitting up higher. OK. So now as I
put the guitar on. This is where it's comfortable for me. OK, this is where I can do all the things that I want to do.
Play exactly the way I want to play and it still feels good. OK, now, is it higher than I'd like it to be? I don't know.
I mean, you know, if I could drop it down 3 inches or something like that, maybe it would be more in the cool zone. The
problem is, as I start sacrificing my ability to do certain things on the guitar, if I do that, and I'm just not willing
to do that, I can't in my head. I can't just lower that down to be cool or whatever. It is right for you. Just. So it
looks good, but I can't play as well, you know what I mean? I can't really sacrifice that. I play the way I play, and so
the guitar needs to be in a position that feels really good. So right here. I can still comfortably reach. Everything I
need to. Playing right here is comfortable. My wrist isn't, you know, completely jacked like this to be able to. I can
play very comfortable. I can come up here. And everything's comfortable. So that's what you want to think about a little
bit. Now a couple of other things I'm gonna unplug and it's going to make just a little bit of noise here, which
normally you could be muted for that, but for this it doesn't make any difference if you're playing standing U. What I
would highly recommend if you've never done this before is you take your cable and you run your cable upward like this.
Through your guitar strap and then you plug it back in. And then what you can do is you can kind of lock it into place a
little bit. You'll notice I have just a little bit of slack here. But now what's happening is the guitar strap is coming
U inside here and then lugging it out here. And that way if I was to accidentally step on my guitar or my cable or
whatever, it's not going to fall out of the guitar. That's the beauty of being able to do it like this is now as I'm
playing and I'm walking on stage, if somebody steps on my cable or I step on my cable or whatever it might be, it's not
going to come out of the guitar. The other thing is because I have a little bit of slack right here, OK. If somebody
were to step on it, it would probably tighten this up a little bit. But I've already got some slack there to kind of
protect the cable, the Jack, the guitar, everything like that. And, you know, I don't have a lot, but just there's a
little bit of a loop right here, if you can see that, OK. And now that's what I would do with that. And the other thing
that I do is, and I'll actually just show you, just give you one second here. Because I like these guitar straps so
much. I own a number of them. I keep a couple in my vehicle. So when I'm driving somewhere, if I'm going to play with
somebody or, you know, some impromptu thing shows up, I've got a guitar strap that's comfortable for me available. And
because of the ends on this, it'll work on anybody's guitar. So I can use this if I need to. Or, you know, I'm bringing
a couple of guitars to a show and I'm not bringing that guitar or something like that. It's always nice to have extra
guitar straps, believe me. It's like cables and power cables, all that kind of stuff. It's nice to have extras, not just
having like one, you know, it's nice to have a few. So what I do is I'll take these guitar straps, and I'm not going to
do this right now, but I'll take the one that feels right to me, OK, that I've marked. That'll be like my official
guitar strap. And again, you know, if I need to move it a little bit, I can remarket or do whatever I want to do. And
again, you don't need to use a permanent marker. You can use something like just a little piece of tape or anything that
you want, you know? And then once you find it, you can leave it there and you're good to go. But what I'll do is I'll
take that, I'll lay it on the floor, and then I'll take these other guitar straps and I'll set them right next to it,
and I'll pull them tight and I'll check their length and I'll adjust these relative to the length of my template strap.
And that way all these other straps are the same size. OK, so because you know whoever's making these that they're not
always exactly the same like. Where these things will line U on them. You know, that sort of thing, those are always
going to be exactly the same thing. So I'm not worried about that. What I am worried about is the length from this point
to this point, making sure that that's the same on all of these straps. That way when I go somewhere and I grab the
guitar or the guitar strap and I put it on a guitar. Now if I put it on a guitar that maybe the the pegs are in a little
bit different spots, you know, maybe it's a Gibson Explorer or something like that, you know, whatever it might be,
well, I can just adjust the strap to that comfort zone. The more you play standing up, the more you get comfortable with
where. That comfort zone needs to be you see O anyway, hopefully that helps you a little bit and understanding the
importance of learning how to play standing U. The last thing I will say is if you want to learn how to play standing up
and you're not very comfortable with it or maybe used to play setting up and you don't do it much anymore or whatever
the case may be what I would strongly recommend. Is that you do all these things we've talked about and then the last
thing is, is play standing UA little bit every day. When you have your normal daily practice routine, try and spend a
little bit of that practice routine just putting a guitar strap on and just playing a little bit standing up. Even if
it's, you know, just in your studio or your living room or whatever it might be. You know, just to get comfortable with
that. If you like to play songs, definitely play standing up and practice those songs to see if you're the guitar is
really at the right length. Right. And to get comfortable playing those songs standing up, doesn't matter what it is,
you know, whether it's chord songs or soloing songs or whatever it might be. But all of that stuff will train you to
better understand just how high or low your guitar needs to be and how long or short that that guitar strap needs to be,
alright? So take care, stay positive and I'll talk to you soon.</p>
