<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones yes christmas is coming and i'm as excited to barrel monkeys whoo i actually know how excited monkeys would be in a barrel i think if you rammed a bunch of monkeys in a barrel they'd get pretty excited slash aggravated.
 All right, well, I'm certainly not the aggravated agitated end of that spectrum, but I am very excited.
 That's very good, darling.<br/>
 I'm not sure why excited you already have your Christmas present.
 No, well, yes, yes, and yes, but I'm believing in God that I'm going to get more Christmas
 than the one you already bought me.<br/>
 Well, I am excited not only about Christmas, but about seeing Star Wars in three days.
 Come on.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And you've done quite a good job of avoiding everybody trying to tell you about Star Wars.
 I have I just cut them off mid sentence if they say anything about it and then you know on instagram or whatever I just look past them very quickly.
 I noticed this morning church somebody tried to talk to us about Star Wars and you punched them in the windpipe.
 Yeah well I mean I had no choice to keep going on and on.
 You just pretend the holy spirit.<br/>
 More.<br/>
 More.<br/>
 More.<br/>
 More.<br/>
 Jab.<br/>
 Am I right in thinking that our Christmas shopping is pretty much done?
 It is mostly done.<br/>
 Yeah, I still have a few things, but mostly done.
 Can Amazon take care of it? No. Why? Because they can't. Oh, okay. I could explain it to you
 when we're not being recorded. Oh. Because it's local things I need to get. Oh, I see. Okay. Well,
 that's... Shop local. Okay. Very good. Shop local as if. 90% of our
 shopping is Amazon. Let's run this week Monday and Tuesday. We have the last day of school for
 2015. That was sad. I know. Well, it wasn't sad. It was awesome. That was great. You we have a
 very special guest and second year at the school. What do you want me to say? Amy Black. Oh, I was
 going to say Luther Vandross. We didn't actually have Luther Vandross, but we did have Amy Black.
 an a black this is going to be weird for a parent to be introduced by their child name but many of you be familiar with our friend christa black.
 She's.<br/>
 I'm crystal talent in so many different areas she's a prolific songwriter.
 She's an author a blogger speaker she's just amazing well it was her mom that was coming in to teach on the school.
 I did have a thought though and I mentioned it to Amy I said is it amazing to watch your kid doing what they're obviously created to do.
 Right and she was like it's the best thing ever.
 I think I'm going to be really excited to be known as tears dad yeah or mj's dad yeah or abby's dad yeah.
 I said all three kids and getting from this.
 Well, you're not going to be excited to be my dad.
 Yeah, I mean, yeah.<br/>
 And what was Amy teaching?<br/>
 She was teaching on heart sync.<br/>
 And what is heart sync?<br/>
 Heart sync is, it's another inner healing method.
 Okay.<br/>
 You know, like there's RTF or Soza or whatever.
 It's completely different, however, and quite amazing.
 I think that I loved the teaching.<br/>
 The most fun part for me was watching a couple of people get a heart sink and sort of get an idea of,
 "Oh, that's what it looks like, you know, I've had one."
 And I loved it, but I'm just sort of like, "Oh, you know, it's different.
 It's really cool because you really flow with the Holy Spirit."
 And it's the one I wished I could have been in to listen to,
 because I was really excited about the revelation and the teaching.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I got the notes, but that's not the same.
 And I couldn't be in the teaching because I was doing teaching in first year on honor.
 Yes.<br/>
 And which we had a riot with the students.
 It's fun that they're learning honor and boundaries before they go home for Christmas.
 It's really good.<br/>
 And they've learned how to make their honor into a wrap so they can wrap over their parents when they get home.
 Are you on drugs?<br/>
 I'm just kidding.<br/>
 Wednesday was our three year old Christmas recital.
 Oh, it's so cute.<br/>
 I didn't see much of it.<br/>
 No, because you're on the back and your iPhone.
 it's because i literally can't stand being around that many small children who are that
 and coordinated who are not seeing the sun i mean let's face it they're not seeing the
 suns are i think awkwardly to really poorly sun carols and i'm in distress so i sat the
 back and some of the children are actually seeing the songs it's just that none of ours
 ever had so no matter which child it has been when we go to the preschool singing
 thing they never sing.<br/>
 No, I just make sure that they see me on the way in.
 Because I'm never going to be able to see me pick me out with the crowd anyway.
 Then I go to the back.<br/>
 That church has got progressively better cellular service over the years.
 So I can thank God.<br/>
 I catch up on email.<br/>
 I want it so far.<br/>
 I greet them enthusiastically and then we go home.
 So that was Wednesday.<br/>
 But MJ looks so cute because he was dressed up like a Christmas tree.
 It was a Christmas tree.<br/>
 I was wondering what it was.<br/>
 I thought he was a leprechaun.<br/>
 What?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 There's no somewhere over the rainbow songs or anything like that.
 It was called a tale of three trees.<br/>
 Oh, I was a Christmas mystic completely.
 Yeah, he was so cute.<br/>
 And then Thursday was a normal work day.
 Lots of meetings, but Thursday night we got to go.
 I didn't say one of your favorite restaurants, but I think it's one of your
 favorite restaurants.<br/>
 But I like it.<br/>
 It's one you went to before the happy octopus.
 No, the little octopus.<br/>
 I have the octopus.<br/>
 I think the happy octopus is a great name for a restaurant.
 Well, there you go.<br/>
 There is folks.<br/>
 If you ever want to start a restaurant, we went to East
 Nashville, which is always good for my self esteem.
 What do you mean?<br/>
 Because I go there and I realize, oh, any semblance that I was
 either hip or fashionable.<br/>
 No, it just, it course corrects that.<br/>
 It's just like, don't be.<br/>
 Why are you so foolish to even think that?
 I'm pretty sure people were looking at us like how did they let them in?
 Yeah, they're like, who let them in at East Nashville?
 Let us square it in.<br/>
 But we had a great time.<br/>
 We really enjoyed that and our company was amazing.
 I think I got let in because I was wearing my cape from Emily, that Emily made for me.
 And so I looked just hip enough to make it into the restaurant.
 And what about me?<br/>
 I think they just let you in because you were with the three of us.
 Oh, OK, you're actually probably not far off the street.
 And then Friday was funny because in the morning I was budgeting and preparing for a meeting
 with our accountant.<br/>
 I am trying to be so organized for this upcoming tax year.
 You go baby.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 I was really impressed with that.<br/>
 So it's been the morning being nerdy and in Excel and lots of numbers and accounts.
 And then Friday night started our kickoff to fake Christmas.
 Yes.<br/>
 We had fake Christmas Eve on Friday night and fake Christmas day on Saturday.
 Yes.<br/>
 It was a pretty good dry run for Christmas day.
 It was good.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I have some ideas of things to do and not to do.
 Let's not do roast lamb again.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 That wasn't good.<br/>
 No, I need to find a better recipe.<br/>
 And the potatoes.<br/>
 What happened to the potatoes?<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 I saw real potatoes go into the pot.<br/>
 But what came out--<br/>
 There was stodgy.<br/>
 Well, it's kind of like wallpaper paste.
 It really was.<br/>
 But I'm used to making my mashed potatoes with cauliflower.
 So I have forgotten how to make them with real potatoes.
 I don't know.<br/>
 That was the issue.<br/>
 I'm at a loss.<br/>
 I don't know whether I needed more or less butter, more or less almond milk.
 Maybe no almond milk in real milk.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 They certainly didn't taste that.<br/>
 You redeemed yourself.<br/>
 Because tonight's dinner was amazing.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 I was absolutely spectacular.<br/>
 It really was.<br/>
 Yeah, it was amazing.<br/>
 And so fake Christmas was awesome.<br/>
 We got some fake Christmas presents.
</p><ul>
  <li>They were real Christmas presents.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, but they were fake Christmas presents.
 They were real presents given on fake Christmas.
 Our friend Cindy, who we wanted to celebrate Christmas
 with this year, chose her family.
 I don't know what that is.
  </li><li>That's shocking, isn't it?
  </li><li>And sometimes she's working.
 So anyway, we had a fake Christmas celebration
 and that was awesome.
 And it's a good job being friend to the high gift giver
 'cause she gives some pretty amazing gifts.
  </li><li>Yes, she pays attention.
 She's like a secret.
 And gives great gifts.
 Yeah.
 And I got a Rosalina amigo.
 You did.
 Well, it's really a very small population of our listeners who know what that is and our care, but it's a super rare Nintendo.
 Figurine, I guess.
 That's really, really rare.
 You can't get anywhere and Cindy tracked one down got one from.
 Darling, you collect figurines.
 Maybe you know, my sense of sight begins to come out and you just squash it.
 Oh yeah. Look at them all over. Beautiful. They're beautiful.
 See, this is the abuse I suffer. Yeah, this must be really hard to be.
 Did anything special happen for you on Saturday, babe, on fake Christmas?
 Did fake Santa do anything nice for you? Fake Santa bought me a real bike.
 Oh, that's nice. I didn't even know you were into biking.
 Well, I think because when we went to go and pick up your bike last week, I wasn't into biking.
 I used to love biking when I was a kid, but I haven't biked in ages.
 Because you're in like the Toronto arm of the health angels weren't there?
 Yeah, for children. So I tried a couple bikes when we went in to get you fitted for yours.
 And then I've just thought about them every day since then.
 And so Cindy wanted to look at bikes.
 So I took Cindy into the bike store, but you were very sneaky.
 Meanwhile, I called ahead and pre purchased your bike.
 Yes.
 And the salesperson was in on it.
 So they came in and just helped you and then you went over leaving.
 Well, yeah, let me tell it.
 They played it super cool.
 He didn't say anything about it when Cindy was riding around on her bike,
 almost colliding with Mercedes and things like that, not joking.
 He said, "Are you getting a bike?" And I said, "Well, hopefully soon."
 And he was like, "Oh, great. I didn't say anything." And then I went to buy a little bell for Abby's
 stalking to put on her bike. And so I said to him, "Hey, can I just pay for this bell then before we
 we go and he said, "You can pay for it right after you get sized for your bike." And I was like,
 "Oh, no, I don't have a bike." And he said, "Yeah, it's been paid for and you're going to get
 sized for it." And then you probably burst into tears? I did. I started bawling in the bike store.
 That is the goal of fake Christmas people. Yeah. And so you've been out for a bike ride already.
 You've clocked a couple of miles. So how many miles did you do today? I think about four.
 look at you go you're amazing thanks so that was our week i can't wait for this week i'm so excited
 except it's gonna rain all week so we won't be able to ride our bikes oh i know but real
 christmas is coming right real christmas forever more power tools break for me our topic this week
 comes from one of our listeners yes Jill wrote in and said this dear Alan and Ajay i just want to
 say i love listening to your podcast i look forward to every monday and i'm encouraged by your
 your realness. Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. You mentioned during a podcast on rest
 a couple of weeks ago, and I wanted to say I'd love to hear your thoughts on the subject.
 My husband and I have been talking lately about how rest looks different to each of
 us. I'm trying to figure out what it looks like for me. I remember you talking one of
 your early podcasts about how women often have a hard time resting at home because there
 are always things to do. I have a very hard time ignoring things that need to be done,
 I've had the epiphany that there will always be things to do.
 I often find myself frustrated because my husband can so easily unplug and absorb himself
 into a TV show or a video game and not be bothered at all by the things I can see and
 can't seem to forget, it's not unique to your husband, it's a gift all manjure.
 "Shocking isn't it?"
 I know you both work like we do, plus you have kids which we don't yet, so there's only
 a limited amount of time to cook and keep up with things around the house.
 I would really love to hear your thoughts on learning to rest and letting things go and
 or learning to prioritize.
 That's an excellent question.
 Yeah, and I think, Jill, you're halfway there really because you said, you know, you're
 asking for our thoughts on learning to rest.
 And the truth is learning to rest really is a process.
 Getting to a place where you understand rest is something that is a learned skill, especially
 in America.
 I'm not sure if you're American, I'm assuming that you are.
 I was playing AJA video earlier today.
 I don't know if people in America remember there was an ad that came out by Cadillac.
 It's a brilliant ad, but it's a horrible ad on so many ways.
 I'll be really interested to see what non-American think of this ad, but let me play it for
 you now because it sums up some of American culture quite well.
 Okay.
 Why do we work so hard?
 For what?
 For this?
 For stuff?
 other countries they work, they stroll home, they stop by the cafe, they take August off.
 Off.
 Why aren't you like that?
 Why aren't we like that?
 Because we're crazy driven hard work and believers, that's why.
 Those other countries think we're nuts.
 Whatever.
 We're the Wright brothers insane, Bill Gates, Les Paul, Ali.
 Were we nuts when we pointed to the moon?
 That's right.
 We went up there, you know what we got?
 Board.
 So we left.
 Got a car up there, left the keys in it, do you know why?
 Why? Because we're the only ones going back up there. That's why.
 But I digress.
 It's pretty simple. You work hard, you create your own luck, and you've got to believe
 anything is possible.
 As for all the stuff, that's the upside of only taking two weeks off in August.
 Nespon.
 What do you think the ad, AJ?
 I think it's kind of obnoxious, but it's true.
 Like there's so much about it that's, you know, it is the mindset of like work harder, get more stuff.
 Right.
 Yes.
 And we're not certain to be the goal.
 Right.
 We're certainly not advocating lots of stuff, but it is very commonplace in America that the culture is work, work, work.
 Compared with other countries, America, the chart I looked at is the last country.
 We most develop countries for time off.
 In fact, there's no federal law that mandates paid time off for American employees.
 Wow.
 That's shocking.
 Yeah.
 When you think about, isn't the UK like four or six weeks to start?
 Like it's no, I think that's teachers like Australians have at least four weeks
 off plus 10 public holidays.
 Brazilians have 22 days of paid leave with a 33% salary of vacation bonus.
 And the French have at least five weeks off.
 Some employees have up to nine weeks off.
 Wow.
 In context, Americans are not very good at resting.
 No, which is really, really sad.
 Well, there's no value on it.
 Right.
 I've noticed that.
 Mm hmm.
 There's a value on work work work.
 Yeah, but not so much on rest, rest, rest.
 I've noticed that even when we try and take our days off during the week.
 That if you, well, if we, when we, because we hold to our boundaries of this,
 our day off to do whatever. It seems like if we're like, well, no, it's our day off,
 so we're not going to go and do X. It's like a foreign concept.
 Like, well...
 No, what are you saying? You're saying that you've noticed pushback from other people
 when we were trying to take a day off?
 Yeah.
 Would it shock you that I have been completely unaware of other people's reactions to my
 boundary?
 No.
 Would not shock me.
 Here's the trouble. You alluded to this, Jill, is that you can't let the lack of work
 dictate when you rest because there will always be work.
 Yep.
 I mean, we've been in the house that we live in now for three years and there are still boxes to
 unpack. So at any point when we're like, I'm just going to sit down tonight, we could unpack boxes,
 actually forget unpacking boxes. We could actually tidy our house.
 Yeah, we could.
 In terms of compromises, the thing that we probably let fall, by the way, is actually having a tidy
 house. Yes. At any time you would stop by our house and announce our houses looks like
 five. It looks like a frat house. It looks like a house that three children live in.
 Yeah. With parents who work all down. And I'm okay with that. I think you have a harder time
 because that whole diffuse awareness that women have. Yeah. But I at least have grace for it. Like
 this is not what we would wish, but it is the reality of our life. And I'm not going to kill
 myself to have all these things.
 Well, and we could keep it tidy, but that would be at the expense of our children's
 time with us.
 Like if you have a limited amount of time to do things, it's either spend time with
 the kids and let them play and let them have fun or have a tidy house.
 And I think in the long run, when they're older, they're not going to remember whether
 the house was tidy or not.
 They're going to remember whether they have access to us or not.
 And that's our story and we're sticking to it.
 Yes.
 No, but seriously, that is an important point.
 You have to understand what's valuable to you because you can say yes to anything, but
 you can't say yes to everything.
 Right.
 So we could say yes to have an entire house, but of all the things.
 I mean, literally we leave the house at like eight o'clock in the morning.
 Some days we get back about 6 p.m. and then we run back out again for a nighttime meeting.
 So our options to do things like basic domestic chores fall by the way.
 Now, when we have gas come over, we just go into hurricane mode and tidy.
 Yeah.
 And we're also blessed to have amazing babysitters that help tidy and all that kind of stuff.
 And we have Amber blessed to have friends and family who love to just chip in and when
 they're over our house for dinner or whatever, they'll strain sofas and tidy stuff up.
 Yeah.
 Or just not care that it's messy.
 So Jill, I think the notion that you can have everything happen at the same time, at least
 in our life, is unrealistic.
 So we just have to pre-decide in advance what are we okay with not having?
 What are we saying no to so we can say yes to rest?
 Right.
 And in this season of our life, we're saying no to having as spotless a house as we would
 normally like.
 Right.
 I think also, babe, there's...
 I realize that there's a difference for me between a puttering type of rest and resting
 type of rest.
 I'm pleased to explain.
 Well, and I don't know if this is just a chick thing or what the deal is, but maybe
 it's the equivalent of you playing a video game to wind down.
 Yes.
 My equivalent to that would either be to draw or something on my iPad that's just totally,
 know, mindless coloring things in that kind of stuff.
 Right.
 Or go and, you know, get a coffee, walk through the factory or walk to the mall, you know, that
 kind of stuff and just putter, like just sort of look at things and not talk to anybody, but just
 right de-stress by moving around and seeing new things.
 And how is that different from rest rest?
 Well, I don't think that that's proper rest because I think I still require rest,
 but it helps me get to where I can rest.
 So I could come home from.
 Puttering or just chilling out, you know, in public and then actually be able to read or whatever.
 It helps.
 It's like the middleman for me getting to rest.
 So the precursor to rest is pottering for you.
 Yeah.
 Whereas the precursor to rest for me is.
 a video game. Well, no, because that's for us for me is I think I can just switch off really,
 really quickly. I think most men can. Well, maybe I'm the only man who's the inside of their head.
 They know what you're the only man who's head. Do you know the inside of it? Is that not what I said?
 Let's go with your version as much better. Okay. Yes, I think that would be an important step.
 Jill is is define what is rest to you and talk to your husband about what is rest for him and resist
 the temptation of getting mad at him when he's choosing to prioritize rest and you're having a
 harder time doing so. Yeah and if you need to get out of the house because everything isn't perfect
 to be able to rest then do that. Yeah. Prioritize rest by leaving. You know along with that whole
 thing of puttering and resting I guess that whole thing is defining what is rest for you.
 So much wiser than me once said to me is that Alan, it's really, really important because you're a
 triune being that you work out what's restful to your body, what's restful to your soul,
 and what's restful to your spirit. So what's restful to my spirit is time alone with Jesus.
 Or self-ginger. Right. Sorry, what's restful for my soul is usually either alone time or quality
 time with a small group of friends and throw in video games as well. I'll put that in that
 that bottle. So that's where I would put puttering and creative.
 Right. What's restful for my body is actually I feel rested after physically exercising.
 Yeah. So do I. Or massage. Or napping. Or sexy cuddle time. Or hot bath.
 One of the things I love that we've learned to do over the years is planning rest.
 Yeah. Is that whole adage of a few fail to plan? You plan to fail.
 And that revelation that self care is not selfish.
 Right.
 That's really helped us plan times of rest.
 Just like we plan every Sunday night, we record a podcast.
 We also plan days of the week, Fridays are day off.
 So we talk about what we're going to do with that that's going to be restful for us.
 We try and take a night a week where it's off, where there's nobody and it's just us
 and then we can unwind.
 And then looking larger than that, you know, we're about to go to Mars my last day at Grey
 Center until 2016.
 We're off for two weeks.
 I plan on doing absolutely no work-related stuff at all.
 Right.
 We might putter around the house and do some fun things.
 Sure.
 Yeah, but that's completely different.
 I don't plan on doing any Grey Center work at all.
 I'm just going to switch off.
 I'm going to be with my kids as much as possible.
 And that really comes to the last point I want to make, which is in your life you have
 to evaluate is the pace of your life right now seasonal or is it a lifestyle?
 Yeah. Like for us, the season of life that we're in is I can't, I don't think I've ever been busier.
 No, it's been crazy.
 Certainly since we moved to Nashville, this has been the craziest, most intense,
 hard work season that we've been in. But I know I can endure it because I know it's a season
 and I know that I rest tomorrow, like after tomorrow, boom, I'm resting for two weeks. So,
 kind of like the joy set before me I've endured this season.
 Right.
 If this pace of life was our lifestyle, it would kill us.
 But I realize, hey, it's a couple of months here, then break a couple of months
 there, break, and then we're going to have to make major changes to the daily
 pace of our life so that we can actually be there for children's graduation.
 Right.
 But I think what I think what some people do is they don't evaluate is the stress
 I'm under is my need for rest a result of the season I'm in or the lifestyle I'm in.
 If it's the lifestyle, you really need to make that your top priority or you will find
 it will become your top priority.
 Then what do you do to manage your season?
 Right.
 Yeah.
 I think putting little pit stops along the season of fun things to rest would really,
 really help.
 Yeah.
 And then I think also recognizing it's not so much about time management, it's about
 energy management.
 I'm not talking about this on the podcast before that will will are agreement to do social events is largely dependent on how much energy we have not if we have time available.
 I have way more time than I have energy right and so it's just learning what's life to you learning what takes.
 What makes you take what makes you take the answer busy and drop an extremely sad word i know i'm so email you.
 can i read mark here i'm just passage from mark six times good mark six verse six then jesus went
 around teaching from village to village calling the twelve to him he began to send them out
 two by two and gave them authority over impure spirits so this is him you know gathen they're
 all super excited verse twelve they went out and they preached that people should repent
 they drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them so that's awesome
 Verse 30, the apostles come back.
 They're all super excited, says that the apostles
 gather on Jesus and report him all they had done and taught.
 Then, because so many people were coming and going,
 that they did not even have a chance to eat,
 he said to them, "Come with me by yourself
 "to a quiet place and get some rest."
 So there in the midst of successive ministry,
 in the midst of busyness,
 actually Jesus prioritizes rest over fruitfulness.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so what's crazy is, verse 32,
 So they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place, but many who saw them leaving
 recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them.
 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them.
 And so this is actually the feeding with 5,000.
 So then it does this huge miracle.
 As soon as he's fed everybody, verse 45 it says, "Immediately Jesus made his disciples
 get into the boat and go ahead of him to Bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd.
 after leaving them, he went up on a mountain side to pray. So both times in that passage,
 you see him prioritizing rest for his disciples and rest for himself. Both times in the midst
 of craziness, both times in the midst of busyness, he didn't let the amount of work he had dictate
 the amount of rest he took. Right.
 And we need to take a leaf out of Jesus's playbook. That's a sports analogy.
 A page out of his playbook?
 All right, okay, we need to read the whole book.
 [laughs]
 I think, you know, it's funny.
 I wrote an article a couple of years ago, it's on our website,
 you go to alanonaj.com/rest.
 It's all about the fact that the primary thing that Jesus wants to give us
 is the one thing we don't actually place a high value on, which is rest.
 In verse 29, Matthew 11, Jesus says this,
 "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
 for I am gentle and humble and hard and you will find rest for your souls.
 And I mentioned in this article that I think it reveals two reasons why we don't choose rest.
 The first is we simply haven't learned from Jesus because we don't know what he's really like.
 Like in so much of the church is spending so much time striving and trying to earn God's love and favor and
 absolutely because we don't realize that we're loved the way we are so we can't rest.
 Right.
 And so yeah, it's important you have a proper revelation of Jesus to enter rest.
 I remember, I see if you remember this, when we had our first child, Abigail,
 my mom flew over from Scotland for six weeks to stay well.
 So it was amazing.
 She did that with all her grandkids, just an amazing revelation of who my mom was.
 But I remember when we had our first child, we were watching the West Wing.
 Do you remember that?
 Just to keep us saying we'd have a box set of DVDs and every time you were
 breastfeeding, we'd put on a DVD and we'd just watch it because that's
 seem to be like the baby was either eating or sleeping.
 And I remember one night, so we're all watching this as a family, me, you, my
 mom, my dad were there.
 And we'd put in the, it'd been a long day.
 It was about nine o'clock at night with all eaten, we'd done all the dishes, we
 just sat down and so f*ck exhausted.
 Uh, you had a little bit of wind up before our abigal would wake up and we
 just all plant down on the sofa.
 We said, so we watched the West wing and we put in a DVD, the title
 start and up jumps my mom.
 And I'm like, mom, well, we're about to watch a movie.
 And she said, "I must redeem the time for the Lord."
 And I was like, "What are you talking about?"
  </li><li>So she ironed.
  </li><li>So she ironed while watching.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because she wanted to--
  </li><li>'Cause she wasn't allowed to rest.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So in one sense, whether you're American,
 Welsh, European, or just Carol used to say,
 "We've forgotten we're human beings and we've--
  </li><li>Become human doing.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think that's the truth.
 It's not our innate position to rest,
 which is why Jesus wants to give us it.
 All right, two things that might help as we wrap this up.
 One, the article I just talked about,
 go to lnag.com/rest, it won't take you long to read.
 And then our boundary teaching will absolutely help you
 say no so you can say yes to rest.
  </li><li>Yes, if you haven't heard it, it is amazing
 and it's extremely helpful,
 especially heading into the holidays,
 but just in life in general,
 and especially, especially, especially if you're in ministry.
 You need to understand boundaries.
 It will help you immensely.
 And you can go download that now and just listen to it immediately.
 Go to lnaj.com/82 for this week's show notes.
 We'll put a link to the boundary teaching in that note.
 So Jill, I hope that was helpful.
 I hope that was helpful for everybody else who tuned in to listen to our answer for Jill.
 We hope you have an amazing Christmas.
 Age and I want to ask two things of you at the season of gifts and giving.
 Number one, if you haven't already, could we ask you to go to iTunes and leave us a review?
 Not only is it a huge encouragement for us personally, but it helps iTunes notice the audience engagement, which means they can promote the podcast more, which means we can reach more people.
 Yay!
 Number two, would anyone out there be interested in hearing us record this live?
 Alan was mentioning that we record it and then we edit it and then we post it, but there's nothing to stop us from making a raw live feed available.
 the idea terrifies me, but there's nothing to stop us.
  </li><li>The only thing that would stop us is half our audience
 will be asleep.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we don't want to encourage people not to rest.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So maybe we shouldn't do that.
  </li><li>We record about 7 p.m.
 Central Standard Time in America.
 That means most of Europe is asleep.
 Australia, New Zealand, you're starting your day tomorrow
 and everybody in America, you know, if you're up.
 But we wondered if you would be interested,
 If there's interest in being able to tune in live,
 and you probably get a different show live,
 you do edit it.
  </li><li>I think that would be safe to say.
  </li><li>You would hit us up, just reach out to us via Facebook
 or Twitter or Instagram, whatever,
 and let us know if that's something you would like,
 and we can easily make that happen.
 I think that could be quite fun,
 and/or quite stressful.
  </li><li>Yeah, exactly.
 And lastly, join us next week for the last podcast of 2015,
 where we're gonna do fun things
 but I'm not allowed to tell you about right now.
 But for now, we pray that you have a wonderful Christmas
 filled with joy, peace, and revelation of God's love
 in Jesus' presence.
  </li><li>We hope you have an amazing Christmas
 and we will be with you next week.
 Like I just said, it's the last podcast of 2015.
 Merry Christmas, everyone.
  </li><li>Merry Christmas.
