<p> I'm in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a sniffles hi how are you feeling I am feeling very tired we've had a little bit of a sick week and we started Monday and Tuesday with the.
 Hi congestion coughing.<br/>
 Grossness, but we got rid of it so quickly with the weirdest massage, not weird.
 You did I didn't.<br/>
 Well that's because I have superhuman.
 Yes, it's true.<br/>
 So we had this massage from Julianne and she saw some emanate was like you guys look terrible sit here and then she did kind of like this light tapping on the back of her neck and it was a limp system massage.
 It was amazing.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I think I did it better than you because I breathe properly.
 She was really impressed with my breathing.
 Oh, I didn't know it was a competition.
 It was.<br/>
 And then she said something I've never heard anybody say before but apparently everyone does it you're supposed to put hydrogen peroxide in your ears yes so we did that but yours crackled mine really crackled mine did nothing i felt like i have a thousand fairies with pickaxes in my ear.
 I go i go with it you did not go with my source of it is horrible i didn't drink it i go with it but it's i mean we still taste it no i didn't.
 Okay. I loved it. Okay. I'm weirdo. Loved it is a little bit excessive. I didn't read the instructions. I don't know if you're supposed to dilute it before you gargled it. So I just gargled it neat. Clever. It had a more potent effect. Yes, it would. Then diluting it. But you don't sound like you've recovered much.
 Well, I spent the week teaching and so no, and I flew out when I flew out to Phoenix,
 the guy that was sitting next to me, we had a seat in between us, but he sounded like
 he was dying from something toxic.<br/>
 I was like, yay, great, perfect.<br/>
 And then you were in Phoenix for three days, four days.
 Yeah, I mean, I was gone.<br/>
 I left Wednesday, got back Sunday, but I taught four sessions a day for three days in a row.
 That's 12 sessions, boom, just like that.
 Boom.<br/>
 But then you got vertigo, you woke up this morning with vertigo.
 Yeah, in the middle of the night, I woke up my vertigo.
 So you're really easy to push over at the moment.
 Dude, I just, my body is, you know, just wanting to have a little break, I think.
 I think you need to rest.<br/>
 Yes, probably.<br/>
 The day that you left, Wednesday, MJ decided to throw up everywhere.
 Yeah, you did. Poor buddy.<br/>
 It was great timing.<br/>
 No, it was horrible timing. I felt so bad going to the airport knowing that he's vomiting was horrible.
 Really? You sent me a text that said, "Peace out, suckers."
 Oh yeah, would you like to produce the evidence of that text?
 Here we go.<br/>
 Yep, there it is.<br/>
 You're a liar.<br/>
 So run this week with me.<br/>
 Aside from being sick, this week at the school, all of our students were teaching us.
 It's a fun week.<br/>
 It's such a good week.<br/>
 We teach them how to teach and then two weeks later they actually teach the school.
 And they did awesome.<br/>
 They did incredible.<br/>
 It happened every year.<br/>
 They're just phenomenal teachers.<br/>
 I love it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 There were so many of the ones that I watched that I was like,
 nobody else would believe this was your first time speaking.
 No, not at all. Not a chance.<br/>
 I was listening to one of our students and I was like,
 I've been at conferences that haven't had as good speakers as this person is.
 Literally, I thought this is this, if I paid to listen to this, I would have loved it.
 Yeah. I mean, so good.<br/>
 And then Monday night, speaking of so good, Michelle Viterus was teaching.
 She did a fantastic job.<br/>
 If you've been listening along to my blessing message, either at M&amp;A or at Grey Center,
 then I'd really encourage you to listen to Michelle's message. I'll put a link in the
 show. It's so funny because Michelle's teaching on abundance. So here I am. I'm pioneering this
 whole thing in our community about God being good and a blessing on abundance. And I'm listening to
 her share some of her testimonies. And I'm finding myself getting offended.
 Really? Well, of course, I'm not offended because I catch that thought. But the thought is rising
 up in me. Like, oh, so you're saying, I'm doing the very, I just thought it was just
 a great moment of irony where I had this opportunity to be offended about the goodness
 of God. I was just like, oh, this is, this is so funny.
 Well, it's easy enough to listen to that voice if you want to.
 Yeah. And then Tuesday night, we're at the belonging talk about Tuesday night because
 it was great.<br/>
 Oh, it's so good. So the belonging had their third anniversary. And they had it at the
 of the rhyming, of course, 'cause they can't actually fit
 altogether at Rocket Town.
</p><ul>
  <li>And they couldn't fit altogether in the rhyming.
  </li><li>No, they sold out the rhyming,
 and there's people that couldn't get in,
 and the worship was outstanding.
 I mean, it was just fantastic.
 And that was mostly worship,
 and then there was some videos and some sort of updates
 on what the Lord has done through the belonging
 and different ministries that it's touched,
 and stuff like that.
  </li><li>And the belonging, for those of you who don't know,
 It is a church that started three years ago in Nashville.
 It's led by friends of ours, Alex and Henry Sealy.
 We interviewed them maybe last year.
 I'll put a link in the show.
 A great podcast that tells you the story
 of how they ended up here and what they've been doing.
 And it was just a joy to go and celebrate
 all that God's done in this city
 through this amazing church.
 So it was great to be there.
  </li><li>It was so fun, such a real night.
  </li><li>Well done, guys.
 You're doing an awesome job.
 And then on Wednesday, you flew to Arizona
 to be with Patricia King,
 and you were there doing a four day training seminar
 finding father and that got filmed. You tell me about this. You had a picture, an Instagram
 this week, of you sitting on a chair upside down. I did. I have to say, I was like, I
 have never seen you do that. Tell me about what was behind the picture. I was explaining.
 It was, of course, because I had 12 sessions, you know, to speak about finding father. And
 so one of the sessions I talk about being a daughter in the house and what does it actually
 mean to be a daughter. And when I was on my journey to understanding that I had this dream
 of being in this big armchair with the Lord in his living room kind of thing. And I was acting out
 like what I had done in the dream, you know, that in the dream to begin with, I'd sat like really
 up tight and the Lord was like, what are you doing? Like I'm behaving myself. He's like,
 Oh, I didn't ask you to do that. I want you to be like a kid. And in the dream, I had flipped
 upside down on this chair. And so, like just sort of like, oh, yeah, is this kid enough
 for you? What about this? And that, you know, the Lord had kind of enjoyed the joking around
 with the chair. And so I was reenacting it.
 And so this is all on dream. It was all on a dream. I love your dreams.
 Thank you. So I don't normally get to share that dream because I don't normally get that
 amount of time to teach it. So 12, 12 hours of teaching? Yeah, it's amazing. I mean, some
 of the sessions might have been more like 40 minutes. There was probably two or three
 that were a little shorter. Right. But most of them were around an hour.
 Ton of content on it all got filmed. Yes, all got filmed.
 Since you've written the book, everybody asks, is there videos that go with the book?
 Right. And there's going to be. And there's going to be.
 Which is super exciting. Yeah. So we'll update everybody on that once they're ready.
 Yeah. And this morning, while you were flying back from Arizona, I was at church speaking the
 second message in series of three on the blessing of a God. Yeah. How'd that go?
 Well, you'd have to ask people that were there. I would say if you were there at first service,
 please listen to the second service because first service, I had about 15 or 20 minutes to speak
 an hour long message. So I drastically cut back what I was going to share. It didn't actually get
 to share the main point. It is tricky. But yeah, if you were there at first service and
 thinking that didn't quite make sense. There's a reason for that listen to the second service.
 But yeah, it was fun.
 I'm always amazed at how stuff comes out because sometimes when you're preparing a
 message, you've got the content, but you're not quite sure of the tone or the delivery.
 Yeah.
 And I was a little taken aback by the tone of the delivery this morning.
 I hope it went across well.
 I got some text messages about how you had nailed it again this morning.
 Oh, good.
 Well, at least it wasn't text messages that Alan set fire to things.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And we didn't get fired.
 So that's, you know, that's good.
 Well, you must have done OK.
 Yeah.
 On the way to church this morning, our kids, you don't know this, but our kids were in the car and they're all talking to you.
 My seven year old starts by saying, "Daddy, I just want to be a grown up. If I could have anything, I would be a grown up."
 And then our nine year old Abigail says, "Well, if I could have anything, I think I want to be an architect or a computer programmer."
 And then our four year old boy says, "Hmm, if I could have anything, I want to ride a live T-Rex and not have it bite me."
 me. I was like, "Adaboy."
 That's awesome.
 Yeah, I love that. Well, listen, you're not sounding fit as a fiddle.
 No.
 And you just got off a plane from Phoenix.
 Yeah.
 I've had the kids for five days and then start today.
 So I'm wiped out and we spent about half an hour trying to work out what we want to do,
 podcast on and couldn't come up with a solid idea that either of us could think through.
 So you heard the genius idea that we're going to do what now?
 I downloaded an app that asks you random questions.
 Oh, great.
 And then you just answer them.
 Are you ready?
 I'm-- I think I'm ready.
 And what are we hoping this will be?
 Just humorous on some level.
 All right.
 OK.
 Humor me.
 OK.
 First question.
 This one says, not so attractive, guys.
 What did you do to get that girl?
 Thanks, babe.
 But you're far too handsome to answer that question.
 So we'll have to go on to the next one.
 What did I do to get the girl?
 What did I do to get you?
 It's all about the accent.
 It was the Scottish charms.
 The Scottish charms.
 It just wasn't the accent.
 No, it wasn't.
 What was it then?
 I just love the way that you loved God.
 Okay, there you go.
 There you go.
 All right, if you're not that good looking, cultivate a great relationship with Jesus
 and women will flock.
 Or an accent or both.
 Okay, next question.
 What's your favorite book that was required in school?
 I have two.
 Okay. One was called a queue for treason.
 Yep.
 And I think I read that in great eight.
 And the other one was Tarzan, Lord of the Apes.
 I love that book.
 That's amazing.
 Yes.
 What are you excited for this year?
 That's a great question.
 Thank you.
 I don't know so much.
 I think I think I'm always excited about what God's going to do in our church
 and in our family and in me personally.
 So I'm excited to see because I feel like God has been taking our church to a whole different
 place. And I want to see what the fruit of that is. I feel like all this blessing talk that the
 Lord's been teaching me about personally, I'm interested to see what that looks like. And then
 I love watching my family grow. So I think I'm excited about seeing what that happens.
 Yeah, that's a good answer. Thanks. Okay. All right.
 Here's a good one. What is something that you apparently do in a weird slash wrong way
 according to other people something I do in a weird or wrong way according to other people will laugh.
 Do that in a weird way gorgeous laugh. Oh thank you.
 I've been criticized for my life for many many years but thank you.
 Okay, I know what you do wrong. What a weird way what you put your pin number in instead of using your thumbprint.
 Okay, you know you might have to let that go.
 There is no way I'm letting it go. Apple spent millions of dollars developing a fingerprint scanner that works remarkably well,
 almost like 99% of the time. I look over in church and see you entering a pin number. I'm like, "What are you doing?"
 It's a force of habit. What small, simple things bring you great joy?
 Great question. Anything that is delivered with care and thought.
 Hey, so for example, almost every apple product I touch, I feel like it was just perfectly built for me.
 And even the packaging and everything.
 Yeah, or when I go to a beautiful restaurant or a wonderful hotel, just anything with intentional thought, I feel incredibly loved by.
 That's very cool.
 Is that a good answer?
 That's a great answer.
 All right, what can you catch but not throw?
 What can you catch but not throw a cold?
 okay i don't think it was a riddle i think it was literally an insight into your coordination.
 oh, it's because the girls keep doing riddles.
 um what can i catch but not throw.
 uh i'm not really catching much really.
 or throwing like car keys it's just a nightmare.
 because I don't want to puncture your skin. Oh, Donnie, you're so delicate. I know.
 This is a very strange question. Are you ready? Yeah. Assuming that complete recovery
 were instantaneous, would you be willing to accept a year of total paralysis below the neck to
 prevent the otherwise certain extinction of a species of animal? No. No. All right. What are
 some road trip essentials? Road trip essentials. Dark chocolate covered peanut butter cups from
 Trader Joe's. Blue chips made by Earth,
 best or green Earth or the blue ones. Yeah, those ones.
 Hummus. I like hummus. Water, coconut and coffee water by the simple people.
 I can't remember what he says.
 not on the list, but appears on every road trip is Doritos cool ranch flavor.
 It's true. They do. They make it every trip.
 What is the one thing for which you would most like to be remembered for after your death?
 My gentleness, which I'm currently trying to cultivate.
 This is the thing I'm trying to cultivate in 2017.
 That scripture, let your gentleness be evident to all.
 Yes.
 It's really been on my heart and I'm trying to be gentle, but like this morning,
 I this morning while preaching, I said, if you're not tithing, you're a thief.
 Well, there's true to that, but what was worse?
 That's not the nicest way to put it.
 What worse?
 Worse as I prefaced it with like, you know, I want to say this gently.
 And then I came out with, but if you don't tithe, you're a thief.
 That's so funny.
 I know.
 I was like, but I would love to be remembered as a as a gentle person, somebody who
 reflected the gentleness and the kindness of God.
 Because here's the thing about the Lord.
 You know, for all his attributes and all his, all the adjectives that could be used to describe his
 personality, he's so gently, so kind, he's so safe.
 And I would love to be remembered as that.
 Yeah.
 I'd like to be remembered for...
 Nobody cares, that wasn't your question.
 Okay, moving on.
 That's your gentleman showing through already good.
 what's something you find super annoying that most people don't i don't know if most people don't but i find it really annoying if i can hear somebody while they're chewing.
 What traffic if i can hear their teeth hit or if they happen to him while they're chewing you must hate me next to me.
 Well you know just trying to block that.
 What do you keep in the trunk of your car i don't keep anything in the trunk of my car because we don't have a trunk but what about the back of the minivan.
 I don't keep anything like I just do not.
 I just don't think like that.
 I mean, there's whatever's in the back of the car is whatever we put there.
 Right.
 There's just like random stuff.
 We don't have any kind of plan.
 Right.
 I'm not that I'm just thinking about today.
 Like, you know, a lot I care about a lot of things.
 One of the things I just don't care about is my car.
 What car is 12 years old?
 I'd never have a 12 year old laptop.
 Yeah.
 I'd never have a 12 year old pair of pants.
 Yeah.
 But I have a 12 year old car and I never think about it.
 I'm so indifferent to cars.
 I'm not.
 I know.
 I'm just thinking that's weird.
 Yeah.
 What's one easy thing that you can do but it amazes people every time?
 Well, probably maybe tell my testimony.
 Right, because people can't get over the fact that you're still standing.
 Right.
 By the end of it.
 Right.
 That's a good one.
 Okay.
 If you could have 50 pounds of anything other than money, what would you want?
 Say that one more time.
 You could have 50 pounds of anything other than money.
 What would you want?
  </li><li>So I can't have gold.
  </li><li>I'm assuming not.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Gummy bears?
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>No, I don't like gummy bears that much.
 50 pounds of something.
 50 pounds is quite heavy.
  </li><li>You know you want chocolate.
  </li><li>You know, I threw it in a couple days.
  </li><li>I'd want gadgets, you know,
 like nice high quality electronics.
 50 pounds of gadgets.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
 I mean, if I could just go into store
 and buy things by weight,
 that's a whole load of nerdery.
  </li><li>That's true, it is.
  </li><li>That's probably what I'd want.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Let me ask you this.
 What do you miss from Canada
 that you can't get in America with these?
  </li><li>Swiss chalet.
  </li><li>Well, like why?
 Why do you miss Swiss chalet?
  </li><li>Oh, it's this beautiful rotisserie chicken
 and the French fries are so good.
 And then you can have the gravy and the dipping sauce.
 When I was with the Patricia King,
 we were talking about how we can't believe that Swiss Shelley is not down here and that
 people would definitely eat it.
 But let me ask you a question.
 I'm not marking you for your insanity, but you can get rotisserie chicken here and you
 can get french fries and you can get gravy.
 It's not the same.
 And that's what it is.
 It just reminds you of comfort in the home.
 And it's just better.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 If you could transport yourself anywhere instantly, where would you go and why?
 Does this have to be on this terrestrial ball?
 I don't know.
 What can I go to heaven?
 It doesn't say, sure.
 I'll go to heaven.
 And why?
 You know why I'd like to go?
 I'd like to go, if I could do that, I would like to see if when I go in the spirit it looks
 the same as when I go in the natural.
 That'd be cool.
 Yeah.
 What is your favorite quote by any fictional character?
 Fear leads to anger.
 Anger leads to hate.
 Hate leads to suffering.
 No?
 If you could change the world, what would you do?
 I think I'd love to find a way to get the message that the church is carrying two people without
 first encountering interference. And what I mean by that is right now in America, the notion of
 Christianity is hugely offensive, hugely bigoted and hugely despised. And I wouldn't mind so much
 if it was all of those things for the actual gospel of Jesus Christ, but it isn't. It's because
 you've got Christians who've been misrepresenting the heart of Jesus, and now a culture's grown up
 where people think, "Oh, that's what Christians are like," and we're really not. So I think if we
 could find a way to communicate really, really well and undo some of the PR damage that we've done.
 Now, to be sure, I'm not talking about the quote-unquote "offensiveness" of the gospel.
 that's going to be there i just more mean i feel like i couldn't even have a dialogue with people
 because they have just lumped me in with you know what they think christian's are like that for me
 makes me sad that's what i would like to do okay let's say your birthday is tomorrow what would be
 the best gift you could receive a mini cooper countryman okay great glad i've got a couple months to save
 Right?
 (laughs)
 Okay.
 What do you like about your job?
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
 I like almost everything about my job.
  </li><li>Me too.
  </li><li>I like the people that I work with.
 I like my boss.
 I like the freedom with which we have.
 I like the influence that we have.
 I like the fruit that we produce.
 I like the environment we work in.
 I like the cause we're living for.
 I like the culture that we work in.
 I like my colleagues.
 You said that twice, but I really like them too.
 Yeah.
 I was thinking twice as well.
 I was thinking about you the second time when I said that.
 Oh, thanks.
 Yeah, I love my job.
 It's a good job.
 I literally couldn't think of another job.
 I would like more.
 Me too.
 Like I can't think of a place I'd love to work more than Grey Center.
 Me too.
 I can't think of an environment I'd love to be in.
 Can't literally.
 I just I love what we do.
 So do I.
 I mean, it's pretty fun, huh?
 Yeah, I mean, there's a blessing from God right there.
 I like the questions I'm asking better than the questions that you're asking.
 Is are you on this app?
 Nope.
 Name your favorite children's story.
 Favorite children's story is probably the hungry, hungry caterpillar.
 It's so much of a favorite.
 You can't remember what it's called.
 Well, I'm really tired.
 The very, the very hungry caterpillar, which of Snow White's seven dwarfs
 describes you best and why. Doc, happy, bashful, sleepy, sneezy, grumpy or dopey.
 I think I worked through them. You just sort of switch out which one you're going to be.
 Exactly. What do females typically not understand about males?
 We don't understand why you need to share all your bodily noises in public places.
 That's just quite good. You really don't understand why we do that.
 What do you think are the most important qualities of a good parent?
 Wow. I think I'm biased because I grew up with a mother who called her mother and she said,
 "All you need to do with kids is love them." Yeah.
 And I don't know if I'm going to guess a straight being loving. But I think being loving, I think,
 is more important than being patient. Being loving is better than providing. I know lots of people
 been provided for but then have loving parents.
 Right.
 So I think being loving, that sounds like a cop out.
 You can probably have more than one quality because it says qualities of a good parent.
 Well, then being loving, being Christ-like, being patient, being fun,
 yeah, being attentive, yeah, kind, being gentle, yeah, being consistent, consistent, very good.
 Is there one place you'd like to visit that you haven't yet visited?
 Yes, Israel.
 Oh, good choice.
 Thank you. What are some slang words or phrases that are no longer used?
 Well, there's all these Scottish colloquial phrases.
 Yeah.
 That are no longer part of my vocabulary, so I forget them.
 And but when I speak to Glenn or I speak to Quinn or I speak to other friends from Scotland,
 I remember them and I genuinely get a hearty chuckle from them because they sound so obtuse.
 But I remember that these to be part of my everyday vernacular.
 Do you have any examples for us?
 No, like when Andy and Lauren were here and they were saying things, I mean, I would just belly
 egg thinking, "Oh yeah, that's a thing that you would say. Why do fat chants and slim chants mean
 the same thing?" That is a nice link question.
 Seriously, what is the most valuable thing that you want? I mean, valuable. I don't mean money.
 I mean most valuable personally to you of sentimental value.
  </li><li>Be my rings.
  </li><li>Aw, you little cutie.
  </li><li>Thanks.
 What are some companies that have great customer service?
  </li><li>Oh, easy.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Walt Disney.
  </li><li>Walt Disney for sure.
  </li><li>The Four Seasons.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>The Ritz Carlton.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Apple.
  </li><li>Up.
  </li><li>Jail Exenders.
  </li><li>Yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's places that if I walk into it,
 I feel instantly comfortable because there's a predictable level of customer service.
 I love that.
 I love that feeling.
 What was the last text you sent?
 It said, "I'm going to watch HGTV and run on the spot if you want to join me."
 Sorry.
 Who could turn down an offer like that?
 She did.
 She turned me down.
 I know.
 It was called.
 So called.
 five songs to which you know all the lyrics.
 I don't know the lyrics to one song.
 Because next I'm supposed to ask you to sing a little.
 But seriously, even- Deep dab because I'm five out of five out of ten andD
 -d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d
 What is happening right now?
 What is happening?
 This is trying to bust a move.
 No, I don't know any songs all the way through.
 I really don't think I do.
 Even ones that I should know and even ones I sing all the time, I just, I don't know.
 You probably know Jesus loves me.
 But, but even then I'm pretty sure I muddle up the words.
 I sing it to MJ.
 What one thing would most people be surprised to learn about you?
 learn about you that I like camping.
 People wouldn't be surprised to know that about you.
 No, I mean, we tell everybody so much about ourselves.
 It would be hard to say what they'd be surprised to hear.
 But that's what I'm going for.
 I think they would be surprised to know that I get very stressed out by having to
 figure out what to wear.
 That's actually a good one.
 You really do.
 I do.
 I don't feel like I have necessarily a fashion sense.
 So that can't be true because you have a very...
 I don't know what is in style and what is out of style.
 I just know what I like to wear.
  </li><li>Oh, that's good.
 And it does stress you have, doesn't it?
  </li><li>It does, it stresses me out.
  </li><li>So having friends who are really fashion conscious
 help you.
  </li><li>It does, but then I know sometimes
 like when I'm wearing something that probably isn't right,
 I feel like maybe I should apologize
 or ask them if they want me to change before we go out
 in public, "Hey, are you okay with me wearing this?"
 I actually do do that.
  </li><li>That is hysterical.
 I didn't even know that about you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You never asked me if you should change before regard.
  </li><li>I didn't think it bothered you very much.
 Well, if you did it, I'd be like,
 could you change into that, Princess Leia?
  </li><li>Yeah, that's another good reason not to ask you.
 Name a turning point in your life.
  </li><li>Either the baptism or the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When I went to that church and the pastor was like,
 have you been baptized in the Holy Spirit?
 And I didn't know what you meant.
 And I was sure I had been baptized
 and I had the Holy Spirit,
 but I had in the clue what I was talking about.
 So being baptized in the Holy Spirit,
 that was a turning point.
  </li><li>Yeah, good.
  </li><li>All right, I got a question for you.
 Which of your three children do you love the most?
 They're all my favorite.
 I'm going to have to push you for an answer.
 They're all my favorite.
 No, that word.
 Order of importance.
 Sushi wine coffee.
 Coffee sushi wine.
 What's your dream car?
 I'd call it a Tesla.
 I would do some of my dream car.
 I still want a countryman, but the Teslas are nice.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
 A countryman is your dream car.
 Yeah, you can get it in a stick shift.
 You can get a Ferrari in a stick shift.
 Yeah, but I don't want a Ferrari.
 You can get a Porsche.
 You can get a Porsche.
 You can get a Porsche.
 Three children to stick in the car.
 Are Mercedes.
 Yeah.
 Your dream car, like the biggest dream
 that you could possibly envision is a mini.
 I enjoy a countryman, mini countryman.
 I don't even know who you are anymore.
 Okay, but I mean, I like the four by four Tesla too,
 but we haven't test driven it yet.
 Okay.
 What celebrities have you seen in public?
 Keith Urban almost said hi to him
 because I thought I recognized him.
 That would have been awkward.
 I know. And Brad Paisley and his wife, his wife is like an actress or something.
 Any others?
 Well, the problem is I really don't know who most celebrities are, so I could have seen
 them, but I wouldn't necessarily have known.
 Right.
 Yeah. I've met, I actually met, but this is like when I was 13, Tom Cruise, but I was
 13.
 I've died not on that story.
 I don't know.
 My brother and I were on Santa Belle Island, and I guess he must have had a house on Santa
 about Island or something.
 And we met him at the grocery store.
  </li><li>And so this is worth exploring.
 And so what happened when you met Tom Cruise?
  </li><li>We just were walking in while he was walking out.
 And we said hi to him and he was really nice
 and just was like, hey, how's it going?
 Whatever, we're like, yeah, it's so cool to meet you.
 Now is that?
  </li><li>Didn't know that.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, it was a long time ago.
  </li><li>All right, three more questions.
  </li><li>Okay.
 If you could live in any home on a television series,
 what would it be?
 Oh, I like that.
 Any home on a television.
 Do I have to live with the people in the DVR?
 No, you're just living in it.
 Yeah, we get their house.
 I loved the big house in the West Wing.
 What was it called?
 The White House.
 The White House.
 Yes, that was a brilliant looking house, wasn't it?
 Yeah, it was quite nice.
 And then it's not TV show, but Iron Man's house.
 That was quite nice in Malibu.
  </li><li>It really was.
  </li><li>Probably like that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then Mr. and Mrs. Smith's house.
 I can't like that one.
  </li><li>I can't remember the kitchen,
 so I don't know if I can agree.
  </li><li>Okay, good.
 What is the best dish you can cook?
  </li><li>My salmon roast.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah, your salmon roast is delicious,
 for sure. Calus puts on it for our listeners. I've tried to get Adi to explain this three
 or four times, but she goes into girl mode where she tells every single ingredient what
 she does for the boys listening. It's just two pieces of salmon, one on top of the other,
 and in the middle there's goat's cheese and then sauteed vegetables and it's tied in string
 And then it's oven roasted and it's delicious.
 Last question, ready?
 Yep.
 What is your favorite month of the year?
 June.
 Is your birthdays in it?
 Yeah.
 I'll put link to the two apps that we use
 to ask each other questions in the show notes.
 Hopefully you learned something about it
 so you didn't already.
 Babies, are there anything going on this week
 that we need to remind our listeners about?
 Applications are open for both year one and year two
 of the School of Supernatural Life.

 We'd love to have you come, John,
 as here in Franklin, Tennessee,
 for an A-month school that would radically change your life.
  </li><li>And if there's something you'd like us to talk about
 on the podcast, go to alanahj.com/ask.
  </li><li>For the rest of you,
 we hope you have a glorious week filled with blessing,
 filled with rest, and we will be here at same time,
 same place, next week.
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin to Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
