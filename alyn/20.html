<p> Welcome to very special edition of keeping up with the jones is keeping up with the jones is as you can see we found budget for our own jingle.
 I talk to about this week.<br/>
 I'm well we talk the school on inner healing it was amazing not just that we were amazing we talk on humility we're so proud of our human.
 No, I just mean like the testimonies and stuff and the way the students are totally going for it was amazing.
 You know the wisest man in the world in scripture said this above all else guard your heart.
 It's a wellspring of life.<br/>
 That's what I love about this week that we just taught.
 It's all about guarding your heart and tending your heart and making sure there's no yukis in the midst of your heart.
 That's the technical term.<br/>
 Yeah, I just love the way our students go for it.
 It's not an easy week to go through where we're like, okay, you know all the stuff that you've just been
 building your life around hiding. Well, let's bring them, let's bring that to the surface and let Jesus heal it.
 But I love that.<br/>
 Yeah, it's amazing.<br/>
 Jesus didn't come so we could manage our sin and our hurts and our disappointment really well.
 Came to heal our brokenness, which is amazing.
 And free us from it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So that was fun.<br/>
 I think quite like doing mass deliverances there.
 No.<br/>
 But it was very fun.<br/>
 It was very fun.<br/>
 It was very fun.<br/>
 Yeah, love it.<br/>
 How do you enjoy your new iPhone, by the way?
 I love it.<br/>
 What do you love about it?<br/>
 I like that this green is bigger.<br/>
 It's lighter than my 5S.<br/>
 It's not actually.<br/>
 It feels lighter.<br/>
 It does.<br/>
 It's a very clever trick.<br/>
 They've made it by volume thinner so it feels lighter but it isn't on a scale.
 But I get what you mean.<br/>
 it does feel lighter in the hand.<br/>
 Cuz I'm still a monster.<br/>
 It is enormous.<br/>
 It's like half the size of my iPad mini.
 Because I've been using the 6 Plus for a week now, almost a week.
 I went back to our old five assets to wipe them to sell them.
 And when I picked them up, I was like, oh, this phone is so cute.
 It's so tiny.<br/>
 It's so miniature.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I told you, yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 But you're liking it.<br/>
 I'm loving it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Everything. It's nice to be able to actually have a battery that lasts all day.
 Yeah. And I use my phone a lot.<br/>
 So to come home and still have my phone up and running, it's really, really nice.
 I like Instagram on it, on the big screens.
 See, my problem with Instagram is love.
 It hasn't been updated yet.<br/>
 So all your problem is with Instagram.
 I'm saying I like Instagram.<br/>
 It's what you're looking at is you're looking at the same resolution as on your
 5s blown up horribly to a larger screen size.
 You do understand that, right?<br/>
 So it's I still like it.<br/>
 OK, well, and my am I tapped out game?
 I have more space.<br/>
 We're going to get you an Android next year.
 You're not drawing Android quarantine.
 We can't be on the equally yoked.<br/>
 Baby, I love that you just fit upon my biases.
 You know, basically, I was responsible for salvation,
 because when we started dating, you had a Dell.
 Yes, because I didn't know any better. It was complete ignorance.
 That's right. I was here in Savior.<br/>
 I couldn't afford anything else because those were cheap for a good reason.
 Anyway, there goes our Dell sponsorship.
 Oh darn.<br/>
 We're coming to the end of our Whole 30 experiment.
 We are. And what did you say today?<br/>
 I said that thanks to Whole 30, I pooped like a newborn.
 Now, what did you say after that?<br/>
 Well i actually thought i today is been the first day and it's been twenty five days of doing this thing where i've actually thought i feel better prior to today i don't think i could have told a difference.
 That's just how much detoxing your body into three and a half weeks in your body is finally feeling the counterbalance that was even i am feeling better i'm aware that i still have sugar cravings,
 which is crazy given i have any sugar in my system for 25 days.
 So i did this fleeting thought went through my head of going i want to do this for another month like i wonder what change i would see another month yeah because i have way more energy.
 Example like normally now i noticed as i go older.
 My ability to stay up late and not pay penalty for that rapidly diminished yeah to the point where if i have a night where i go to bed after midnight i was grumpy sin the
 next morning. It takes me a couple of days to recover. But on Whole 30, usually I get
 a second wind about 9pm, 10pm and I can stay up and work and be creative and cognitively
 aware. Several nights in the last couple of weeks, I've not been going to bed until
 about 12.30, 1am sometime later. I haven't noticed a difference. I haven't slowed down
 in the morning, I'm not groggy, I'm not grumpy." So I'm thinking, "Oh, that's a really interesting
 effect I've noticed." Yeah. I would say I don't have brain fog. You know, the whole thing,
 when you're trying to recall stuff. Right. But you also said you haven't been in pain this
 month. No, I haven't. Yeah. After about day five or day six, because I have consistent
 back pain, I think just from all the damage that I did to my spine from some accidents and stuff.
 And so I pretty much always have like a three or four for pain level. And then I have days
 where I get much higher than that. And I haven't since about day five had any back pain at all.
 And I'm adjusting a lot better like our chiropractor is finding it easier to adjust me.
 So there you go. A whole 30, a bunch of us can say a bunch of our friends, not two of our friends
 to my knowledge. I've been doing whole 32.
 No, there's more like eight.<br/>
 Oh, we have eight friends.<br/>
 That's awesome.<br/>
 I know, right?<br/>
 Well, yeah, we were having a whole 30 support group meeting tonight where friends of ours
 who've started it too.<br/>
 If you can get past the first 24 days, it's almost a walk in the park.
 Hey, what did you see on Facebook that was very cool today?
 Oh, Laura Woodley is doing a Kickstarter for what looks like it's going to be children's
 soaking CD.<br/>
 If you're not familiar with Laura Woodley, Laura Woodley.
 Osmond.<br/>
 Yeah, she's just a gift from heaven, really.
 She released an album a number of years ago called Home, which pretty much by and large was the de facto soaking CD for so many years in Toronto.
 And she's just this amazing, amazing person who loves Jesus.
 And she's, and I say this as a compliment, not as an insult.
 She's the most right brain person I think I've ever met.
 And I know a lot of right brainers in that she's just so caught up in love for Jesus
 and affection for his presence that at times you're like, are you, are you really,
 I remember we were having lunch for the ones.
 And we were like, okay, we've all made our mind up and she's, and we look at her and we're like,
 what? She's like, I'm just asking Jesus what to eat. And now normally that would sound corny and
 sappy, but it's completely authentic and genuine with Laura. And so anyway, if you've never heard
 her music, go head over to iTunes, just search for her and listen to some more stuff. Just incredible.
 The thought that she's putting together soaking CD for kids is amazing.
 and I would love to have a soaking city of hers to play over our kids.
 Right, which is why we joined our Kickstarter campaign. We sure did.
 Yeah, so we'd encourage you to do that too. This is a very special episode of
 keeping up with the Joneses because we're actually keeping up with the Jones because you're away
 this weekend. Yes, I am. Apparently, on the road doing jingles. Where are you going this weekend?
 St. Louis. And you're taking a team of six people.
 Some awesome women.<br/>
 Yes, amazing.<br/>
 And so you're just going to go, are you doing interhealing or prophetic or everything?
 We're doing sort of a big modge pod of everything, but yeah, we'll be prophesying over.
 We're doing a prophetic prespiratory, like an actual one, but then we'll be prophesying
 over them at the services and that kind of stuff.
 So you're away and I'm looking after the kids for three days.
 Yeah, super-dating it.<br/>
 Well, it's going to be awesome.<br/>
 They're all going to get haircuts.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 I'm going to give them piercings.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 I wear it away to do your own Hannah Tatsu just using Sharpie.
 You just like dissolve a Sharpie and some apple cider vinegar.
 You just get a syringe.<br/>
 You can use apple cider vinegar.<br/>
 It's going to be awesome.<br/>
 I just hope my spelling is up.<br/>
 This is a scratch.<br/>
 First of all, if you Hannah Pierce or cut their hair, I will end you.
 I will find a dazer and it will not go well for you.
 OK, what if I get somebody else?<br/>
 Is it just somebody else?
</p><ul>
  <li>I'm going Craigslist.
  </li><li>I just believe in that.
 Here's my most precious session.
 And then back to me when you're done.
 No fast food.
  </li><li>What is this fast food you speak of?
  </li><li>You want me to name all the rest of your knowledge?
  </li><li>It means 25 days.
  </li><li>You're not allowed to go do it.
  </li><li>Well, you can't eat there, but I just don't want you
 to like go into culvers and feeding them junk,
 which is what happened the last time I went away from weekend.
 mommy we waited we had a blue place and we had a choc
  </li><li>Daddy said to say I can't quite remember,
 but I can remember by me.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>All right, well.
  </li><li>You're not gonna get them to lie to me.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Any other top tips?
  </li><li>MJ's quite fascinated with grass right now,
 so you could probably run around outside
 with him in the grass and he would be like that.
  </li><li>Sure, that'll happen.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'll just put all the pictures of grass on our TV
 and then we can stay inside in air condition now.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
 We need to pray for healing for you
 for the outdoors thing.
 any other top tips?
 It's not like I've been with them at every stage
 of development.
  </li><li>Well, here's the thing, Jones.
 Almost every single day when I say something like,
 "Hey, could you make the bottle or hey,
 "could you whatever?"
 And he's like, "Yeah, and you say."
 He didn't ask me to, or I didn't know that had to happen,
 but it's been happening every day for two years
 at the same time. - It's not been in my,
 when you go away,
  </li><li>What I'm saying is there's a lot of stuff that I do
 that you probably didn't have been in.
 takes in though. When you go away and I just manage it. Okay. You watch. I'll send you
 pictures and everything will be fine. I think last time I went away I called and it was like
 9.30 in the morning and you hadn't fed them breakfast yet and MJ was like melting down.
 Yeah well I made out with a milkshake later. Oh gosh. I just blended to Mars Bar. Oh Father.
 I'm gonna pray over the little tummy's before I go tomorrow. All right well thanks for your
 care and concern. Thank you. Be totally fine.
 Tia did ask if I could teach her how to FaceTime in case she needed me for something.
 Well, I was thinking we'll face paint and then we'll face time. It'd be like a surprise.
 Well, I thought that we'd do a theme that we can and it's going to be pirates.
 Oh, wow, that sounds fantastic. So while you're away, I'm going to
 I'm going to record a proper podcast with none other than the very mighty Jeff dollar.
 Jeff dollar.
 It's true.
 Well, we only have two microphones, so I have to go away for us to have a guest person.
 Well, listen, you have a fun weekend, baby.
 Thanks.
 And we'll see you back.
 I'm going to sleep in every morning until eight.
 Okay.
 Jesus, I'm praying right now for the spirit of alertness at seven a.m.
 That is unkind. Bye. Bye
 Jeff dollar, how are you I'm doing great. You're looking Jones. You're looking resplendent. Thank you so much
 You look like a radio profession. Well, you know, that was one of my
 It wasn't it was never one of my desires to be already
 Someone ever told you got a great face for radio
 You know
 Yeah, I take care of my dad on his side of family. Yeah, they look great to radio
 My wife is out of town so.
 I know it's just party central.
 It is.
 My friend.
 Cheers and free goes.
 Kid running around.
 Totally.
 Where's Becky?
 What's Becky doing?
 Becky is...
 Where is she?
 She's out with somebody today.
 Doing a coffee, doing a coffee.
 For those of our listeners,
 you've never met Jeff and Becky Dollar.
 Your life is not complete yet.
 Jeff and Becky are senior pastors at Grace Center, the leaders of our church, their dear friends of Aji and I, and
 we've known each other for five plus years, maybe six years. Wow. Probably a little longer than that, but we've certainly been working here.
 Wow. And how would you just try Becky for those people who've never met Becky?
 She is the personification of joy.
 She really is. That's kind of it with blonde hair. She really is. That's it. I've, I think I've
 really mad and everybody like backy i've never met anybody she's like the energizer bunny of.
 Joy and compassion like i've never seen her wind down behind doors she cuts like a sailor and stuff she's horrific.
 Terrific i tell you we she curses swear she's a seriously does she have bad days or she just constantly.
 Like she is.
 She probably has bad days and all of them involve me.
 So if you pull me out of the picture, Becky has is great.
 But her bad day probably looks like one of my good days.
 Oh, in terms of her self-controlling.
 I mean, she's as buoyant as a beach ball.
 So if you can hold it, however long you can hold a ball underwater.
 As soon as you let go, she's back on top.
 Just boom, bouncy, joyous.
 And she was like that when you met her.
 laughing like that when I met her.
  </li><li>And what do you give credit for that, meth, I'm fair to me?
  </li><li>One of them, yeah.
 I never did meth, but yeah, there's something in it.
 I think she sips Benadryl or something, but no.
  </li><li>She's just constantly joyful though.
  </li><li>Constantly joyful.
 I think a lot of it is for her,
 see I never knew her before, but she had a horrific life.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Horrific, horrific.
 So just to see how far down she was probably pulled emotionally just from all of the things
 that happened.
 Circumstances and life.
 Circumstances.
 Yeah, just a lot of loss.
 And so when the Holy Spirit, when she was baptized in the Holy Spirit, it just shot her.
 That far in the positive, in fact, I guess, that's just.
 do yeah, I find it interesting introducing people that I've known for a long time to Becky and
 And watching them kind of like tilt her head trying to comprehend if she's real which of course she is
 I mean that in the most endearing of senses. I mean she's so kind and so thoughtful and so genuine and so
 Interested. I don't know how I don't know how bear to describe her than that like when she looks at you
 Her eyes are fixed on you. You're the most important thing in the world
 And I think that's uncommon.
 And so I don't know if people know what to do with that
 until they see it repetitively and go,
 oh yeah, you're consistently like this.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's almost like she's read about you
 or heard about you or,
 and so she is so excited to meet you,
 even though she does that to everyone.
  </li><li>That's a very good way.
  </li><li>That would be what it's like.
 She does it every time.
 And every time she sees you,
 you know how you do, you meet someone
 after the third or fourth time,
 You're kind of, oh, hey, Alan, how are you?
 She's still on that first time meet.
 Oh, I'm so glad to see you.
 Or you've been gone for two years or three years
 and she can't wait for you to get back
 and that's what it's like.
 And so people don't know where to put that.
 And she's genuinely, or if she's never met you before,
 she will still, it's like she's been waiting
 to meet you all of your life.
  </li><li>She'll totally pursue you in that.
 It's funny if we're in a meeting
 and we're waiting to get started.
 She's got no concept.
 Again, this is a good thing.
 This sounds like it's a negative and it really isn't.
 But she'll have no concept that,
 oh, there are quote unquote more important things to do
 than individually greet every person,
 give them a genuine hug and a genuine smile.
 It's incredible.
 Like I think she's just phenomenal like that.
  </li><li>We've had more people join the church because of Becky.
 And I'm like, what do you mean?
 says, "Well, my wife saw Becky at Kroger,
 and Becky made a point to come around to the next aisle,
 meet her in the next aisle, and hugged my wife.
 And my wife said, "Oh, my word, who is this lady?"
  </li><li>Right.
 Tell me what they said about her
 when you went to Romania last year.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>They bless their hearts.
 You know, they're all really,
 they're from a communist regime and a communist influence.
 So it's really oppressive.
 And so there, we love these people, they're so blunt and truthful.
 And so the wife of this one couple that we went on there to minister to said,
 "Oh, Jeff, we love Becky. She's so kind. She's so sweet. We like her better than you."
 I just laughed, but I totally understand. But I think she meant it. I really do.
 Right. I'm not in the running. I'm so sorry. Not at all.
 How can you compete?
 they had never seen a person like her,
 full of life and light, and it's authentic.
 And so especially the women,
 well, no, everyone was just so attracted to Becky.
 It's like a walk, she's like a walking light,
 that just walks around, so it was amazing.
  </li><li>So I was talking about how you, I mean, I know,
 but tell us how you got saved.
  </li><li>We grew up in the Nazarene church.
 My parents were Nazarene, my grandparents were Nazarene,
 My great grandmother was Nazarene,
 so like what is that fourth generation Nazarene?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Nazarene's believe real huge emphasis on holiness.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so which I really appreciate that heritage
 and that upbringing.
 Eight years old, I was at a vacation Bible school
 and I got saved.
 Just as genuine and authentic as anything.
 I think the pastor had us around the altar
 and was talking to us and all of a sudden conviction
 comes over me and I'll begin to cry. I don't know why I'm crying, but I'm crying." And
 he just leads me in the prayer. And afterwards, felt really clean, really like something had
 just happened, like I just got taken a shower on the inside or something. I don't know. It
 was really, it was great. And then I was baptized when I was nine, water baptized when I was
 nine, same thing happened.
 Right.
 So yeah, but then you, so you're nine years old, you grew up, you're in your teenage years.
 What caused you to walk away from church?
 I think was a few things, but one in particular was I, when I was a sophomore in college,
 I had a real encounter with the Lord.
 So I was in the word reading and I was so hungry for what I was reading about, which
 was basically, I didn't know it, the signs, the wonders, the healings, the evidences,
 and there was no room for that in the Nazarene Church. They believed in it, but they would just
 say if it's God's will. So apparently, by deduction, it was never God's will.
 Which is a fascinating line of reasoning. It totally is. You can outsource so much stuff to not
 happening as it being God's will. And conversely, attribute so much evil to it being God's will.
 To being God's will. Totally.
 And you're just like, we wouldn't attribute nearly any of that stuff to an earthly father.
 So I don't know why we still look at it, and we're going to have any father.
 So you were seeing stuff in the Bible that you're not seeing in your life, and what does that
 cause your heart to? Just, you know, I would search for it. So I didn't know any better. I would
 asked the leaders of the church, "Hey, where is this?" And they would say, "Well, if it's God's will."
 And at the same time when they said that, they were such a, my heart began to get sick,
 and I hope deferred, makes a heart sick. So I just thought, "Good grief, it was for then. It's not
 for now." And so I kind of got bored, and it wasn't fun. And so I took a hard left and got into the
 the drug scene and the party scene and all that sort of stuff for how long? Probably five years.
 Gosh. And it was miserable. I mean, I'd had fun, but I was miserable. And the Lord would speak to me
 in the bars. And though, you know, just I had some really funny, say funny, interesting encounters
 with the Lord while I was really straight away from him. I mean, I had gone so far. I didn't kill
 anybody, but nor did I do heroin, but anything in between there, I did. So, yeah, he would
 talk to me and he would, yeah. And so I was really miserable. And I told the Lord one day
 I was on vacation and I couldn't, I worked every Sunday from eight in the morning until
 10 at night, that's on a long day. So there's no place for me to go to church. And the only
 quote unquote church that I knew was the Nazarene church.
 And so I knew I was lost.
 I knew I was, and so I was on vacation and I was at home.
 And for whatever reason, I turned on the religious station on television on cable.
 And I'm not going to tell you who it was, but some this evangelist was on television.
 He was saying all this stuff.
 And I got so angry at what he was saying because I knew it was just bull.
 Right.
 And I was like, ah, I was really angry.
 And all of a sudden, I feel this presence really close to me.
 And this internal audible voice is Jeff.
 I said, yeah, he says, I need some help.
 I knew exactly.
 It was the Lord. I said, all right.
 I said, well, Lord, I'm on vacation.
 I can only go to church this Sunday.
 He says, just show up.
 Okay, I'll do it." And he was gone. So I completely forgot about it. That was like a Tuesday or
 Wednesday. Saturday night, up, stayed out late, got home at five in the morning.
 Totally forgot about what he said about going to church. So I slept till five that night.
 Woke up, you know, and tried to call my party friends and nobody wanted to come over, which was
 really odd. At least somebody or one person would come over. There's about five of us that ran
 together. And no one wanted to. Well, about that time, the Lord that that voice again went
 I don't know how to describe it. Really close in audible internal audible voice said, Hey, I thought
 you said you're going to church. So you're right, I did. So go to church, get ready, go to church,
 walk in, they haven't seen me in five years by hairs, you know, down to my shoulders and, you know,
 you know, the people's eyes were as big as saucers.
 And so walked in and there's, what are you doing here?
 So well, I've thought I would come tonight.
 And so in our church, we had one night a year
 where they took time to kind of update everybody
 on the missions part of the church.
 So usually our missions trips were going to some place
 and painting or, you know, construction work or whatever.
 But it was the one service
 that if you wanted to skip, this would be the one to skip.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so I'm thinking, oh dear God, I have missed it.
 Because I knew there wasn't gonna be a message.
 I knew there wasn't gonna be an altar call and there wasn't.
 And I was prepared to go through all of this.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>I was ready.
 'Cause I told the Lord, if I come back,
 I don't wanna fall back again.
 So He says, just show up.
 So I am sick.
 up there showing slides about, you know, here's Yogambi, our interpreter, and here's the beach,
 and here's, you know, and I'm like, oh, dear God. So afterwards, some friends of mine that were
 still in the church, and I went out to eat, and when they brought me back, I began to cry.
 And I told them, I said, whatever you do, do not ever leave the church. Well, they didn't know
 what to say. They were their eyes were as big as saucers. And so I get out, shut the door,
 get in my car, drive home, realizing I've got another year before this is going to be able to
 happen again because I work every Sunday. So I'm crying on the way home. I feel sick and
 wow, get home and try to flip turn back on the religious station. That was that point. That was
 the place where God met me even though it was I thought it was negative. He met me right there.
 Right. So you're trying to recreate that. Trying to recreate it. Couldn't do it sick.
 My stomach felt sick. And then about that time I got a knock at the door. Thankfully,
 one of the guys that I've got to eat with followed me home and said, Jeff, I think you're, this
 is conviction. I think the Lord is, is moving on your heart. So after about an hour or so, they were
 trying to talk me into it. I want to make sure I got it. I wanted to make sure, you know, it was
 legit. And once I prayed a repentant's prayer, I didn't feel hardly anything. Right. Except they
 They said, "Oh, your countenance has completely changed."
 So went to bed.
 Well, I got up the next day, walked into my work and quit.
 And so everyone was shocked that you're quitting.
 What?
 What happened?
 So I went to church yesterday.
 I said, "Wow, it must have been a good service."
 I didn't know what to say.
 It was horrible.
 You know what I said?
 Yeah, it was good.
 So that, so I didn't know how I was going to make a living and was totally trusting God.
 So I immediately got two guys to meet with me once a week.
 They came over maybe every Tuesday night or Monday night
 and we just ate and talked,
 but it was really a place I was selfish
 'cause I needed some form of accountability.
 I wouldn't call it accountability,
 but I needed that.
  </li><li>And were you going back to that church then on Sunday?
  </li><li>Yep, yeah, went back to the church.
  </li><li>And was there life in it for you?
 Or it was-- - There was, you know,
 I tell you what was interesting is when I got back,
 I was shocked at everybody knew about God.
 It seemed like they didn't know him.
 So we would sing because it was traditional church,
 they would sing out of the hymnal.
 So it'd be singing stuff, the choir would sing it.
 I'd watch the people in the choir,
 kinda they knew all the songs by heart.
 So they were just kinda looking off up in space
 to the right or to the left or looking at for their kids.
 and I'm weeping one, oh my goodness,
 you have no idea what you're singing about.
 Or if you do, you've forgotten it.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And so I just remember the Holy Spirit would touch me,
 you know, deeply.
 And so for about, see that was '87,
 for about a year did that.
 And actually this little group, these two guys,
 more people started coming.
 And so we would just kind of sit around in my living room
 just talk about the Lord and basically the young adults at that time, most of them in
 the church were just like I used to be except they didn't go out to bars and stuff.
 So they were away on the inside but their actions didn't portray it?
 Exactly.
 I don't know what's worse.
 Yeah, I think it's the same.
 So I just chose to, hey, if we're going to be black and white, I might as well, I'm
 black or what are darker or whatever. So, so I remember there's
 just one revival that happened and me and those two guys, their
 name was Greg and Don prayed every night because of the revival
 started on a Tuesday and went through Sunday. So every night
 afterwards, we'd stay behind at the church. We had a key and we
 go up to the altar and we'd pray. So I remember Saturday night,
 we were kind of prayed out. There's nothing else to pray. So
 were just sitting there and one of the guys opened up a hymnal and just started reading
 the words of these hymns that we sing. And it was like, "Wow, I've never read it like
 that. I've always sung it, but I've never read it." And the Holy Spirit showed up and
 to this day, this has never happened since. But we all began to shake and tremble. And
 was so intimate that we didn't speak out loud. We all whispered. But we were all visibly shaking,
 couldn't control it. And I knew the next day something was going to happen.
 So I woke up Sunday morning, I'm like, "Oh, man, this is going to be great." And sure enough,
 it was that that entire youth group kind of came back to God.
 Wow.
 I mean, I didn't have anything to do with it.
 I was just, we had just prayed and I knew it was going to happen.
 So that's how our, our kind of group on Monday nights grew.
 Boom.
 Instantly, we had like 11 or 12 people show up.
 So we all kind of did life together.
 And during that time, I had met Becky and she came.
 She would start coming.
 And I didn't know this, but she had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
 I didn't know that.
 So it's really interesting because we would all be sitting, sitting around in
 the room, talking about different stuff.
 When she would talk about the Lord, it was like we all just were just kind
 of drawn into it.
 And then once she would finish, no one had anything to comment on what she said,
 because it was just, it was out of our league.
 I mean, we didn't know, you know, I guess cognitively you would think,
 How does she know that or where did you get that?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Or is all the Holy Spirit.
 So let me keep going.
  </li><li>Well, let me jump in for a second,
 because you and I know what we mean by baptism,
 the Holy Spirit.
 I'm imagining there's people who are listening to this.
 That's an unfamiliar term for them.
 So help me explain, like, so you and Becky
 are at the same Monday night group.
 You're both Christians, you both love the Lord.
 Yet you're pointing to a difference in her
 that you didn't see in you.
 Talk to us about what that is.
 Or maybe tell your experience.
 Yeah, no, no, well, no, the difference was, because that's a great question.
 The difference was she was much more intimate, personal in her experience with the Lord.
 Right.
 I think that was it.
 She was speaking from a personal experience,
 whereas we were too, but it wasn't as ongoing,
 not ongoing's the wrong word.
 It wasn't as intimate.
 You'd have thought that she'd just come from a meeting
 with him and was talking to us, whereas we were going,
 "Wow, it's that whole thing of knowing about someone
 versus knowing someone.
 So I say this all the time.
 So, you know, I was a big Michael Jordan basketball fan
 and I knew all about Michael Jordan, his stats,
 how tall he was, where he was from,
 what his favorite food was, that sort of stuff.
 But I never met, I never knew Michael Jordan.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so something, she had something like that,
 where it was so funny because every time she would speak,
 would have to change a subject because no one could comment.
 All right, because it was, you know, so,
 but she, I tell you the thing that drew me to Becky was,
 she loved Jesus more than anything in the world,
 more than anything, and you could see it.
 Right.
 So,
 so I don't.
 So tell me then, how did you, 'cause I know that,
 I know what happens next, I know that you end up
 and baptize by the Holy Spirit. So talk us through that and then talk us by what you, well, yeah,
 tells your experience of being baptized in the Holy Spirit.
 So the group that we were in went on a retreat. I couldn't go because I had to work.
 So I was the only one that stayed back. And Becky said to me, she was, Hey, I don't take you to this
 Bible study over at this Episcopal Church. Well, I'd never been in an Episcopal Church and
 I'm thinking, okay, I don't know what that's going to be like, but I trust you.
 So we go, we weren't even dating.
 So we picked her up and so we go in and this lady speaking.
 And I didn't know any of the songs.
 They all knew the songs and it was this cool guy on the guitar.
 And so when this lady started speaking, I'm thinking, good grief.
 Where is she getting this stuff?
 Like what commentary is she reading?
 Because this is, I've never seen this before.
 Not knowing that it was the, the Holy Spirit.
 that was telling her this.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So at the end, I don't remember what she spoke on.
 I just remember at the end,
 she invited people to come up that wanted prayer for healing.
 And I went, oh my gosh, they're doing it.
  </li><li>Right, they're doing this stuff.
  </li><li>It's not weird.
 It's not weird.
 It's not the stuff on television or, you know,
 it's not, there's nothing weird about this.
 And I was just, I was fixated on people
 and how they were doing it.
 Then she said, I really feel like there's people here
 who have never experienced the power of the Holy Spirit.
 I think that's the wording that she used.
 So I turned to Becky, I said, "What is that?"
 And she was like, "Well, it's a..."
 'Cause she knew all the buzzwords that we brought up.
  </li><li>Right, that would trigger you.
  </li><li>That would totally trigger us.
 Tongues or whatever.
 So she was kind of dancing, but not,
 she wasn't being devious about it.
 But I remember saying, "Do you have it?"
 And she said, "I do."
 And I said, "That's it."
 Whatever that is, I'm missing.
 So I went up front.
 I think I was the very last one to leave the building.
 They prayed for me.
 I received the baptism, the Holy Spirit.
 It wasn't anything demonstrative or anything.
 You know, it's just they encouraged me to try to speak out,
 which I just got one word.
 And when I spoke that word, it was like liquid honey
 from the top of my head, went all the way down.
 I felt it go all the way down to my feet and then back up.
 And I, Becky said I had this big smile on my face.
 I think I said, wow, that was.
 Wow, indeed.
 So we went out to eat.
 I still didn't know really what had happened to me.
 We had listened, she had brought a cassette tape for those of that
 who are listening, they might need to go Google what cassette tape is.
 Sure.
 But listening to this worship band and before I received it, it was just good music
 afterwards. She said, why don't you keep this? When I dropped her off, I am weeping on the way home
 because my spirit is now worshiping with this group that I had never experienced that before.
 I was so elated, joyful. It's like I didn't want this experience to stop. So I stayed up as late
 as I could, you know, in my house and was trying to keep it going. And that's just when everything
 started. It is funny if you think about our experience of church now and our experiences,
 because we have a very similar experience in churches. I think it's so endearing that you try
 to stay up all night because you didn't know that presence is available all the time.
 Exactly. I think the goodness of God is the best kept secret in the church.
 I'm just amazed. In my own experience, I always wanted to hear the voice of God, and there would
 be times when God would punctuate the sounds of my life with him speaking, but it seemed haphazard,
 seemed outside of my control, seemed completely sovereign. I didn't know how to make it happen.
 Only to learn years later that I hear God as often as I choose to listen for him.
 and we can come into His presence anytime we want.
 And weakly, we're in this amazing presence at Grace and her
 that previously I paid thousands of dollars to travel to the other side of the world to experience.
 And it is amazing how you grow in your understanding of God's nature
 or understanding of how to cooperate with Him.
 I don't know.
 I just I have no idea.
 It is amazing because as you were saying that, I was thinking about, you know, I said this
 a few weeks ago at church, I'm hearing things coming out of my mouth that back in the day,
 when I was longing for this, it sounded like something that you'd read in the Bible.
 Right.
 So we have friends now who have prayed for people that have been raised from the dead.
 We've got friends who have been raised from the dead.
 And I'm just bizarre.
 It's just bizarre.
 totally bizarre. Do you remember the first time you heard a contemporary story of somebody
 who raised from the dead? I remember listening to Heidi Bakey. Heidi Bakey. It's Heidi Bakers
 distant cousin. Now, I remember listening to Heidi Baker talk about her encounter in Toronto,
 then going back and the transformation that happened and her, you know, witnessing people
 being raised from the dead. And I turned off the CD because I don't have anywhere to put that.
 "Oh, really?"
 I wasn't calling her a liar, but I kind of was.
 I was just like, there's no way that.
 That's just absurd, that's just ridiculous.
 Like literally I had no grid for that.
 And now like you say, we have friends who have raised people
 from the dead and we have friends who have been raised
 from the dead.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean it's bizarre.
  </li><li>Bizarre.
  </li><li>Bizarre.
  </li><li>So bizarre.
 And then when I try to tell people,
 like if I were to go back to,
 or just talk them to my parents or whatever,
 they have no grid for it.
 They can't.
  </li><li>They don't know where to put it.
 there's no place to put it.
 They're just like, oh, isn't that interesting?
 And I'm thinking, what in the world?
 Did you just, did you hear what I just said?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But bless their hearts.
 I mean, they don't, they don't have a place to put it.
 So, you know, I don't know if you want me to continue
 that story. - Yeah, go on.
  </li><li>So, so when I received the baptism
 of the Holy Spirit, I had no idea that,
 that the baptism of the Holy Spirit brought the spiritual world to life.
 Right. Stop right there for a second. Explain to people what the baptism of the Holy Spirit is.
 Oh, that's right.
 The baptism of the Holy Spirit. That's a great question too because people talk about,
 well, you get the Holy Spirit. I thought you got the Holy Spirit when you were saved,
 I think it's in Acts chapter 19, I believe it is.
 Paul is talking to this group of people
 and he said, "Are you basically disciples of Jesus?"
 Yes, yes, which baptism did you receive?
 What did the baptism of John?
 So it's even not been baptized in the Holy Spirit.
 We didn't know there was a Holy Spirit.
 So I think it's the baptism of the Holy Spirit
 is when the Holy Spirit comes on you.
  </li><li>Right.
 So when I got saved, the Holy Spirit came in me.
 And Jesus demonstrated that with its disciples
 when he was raised from the dead, when he was resurrected.
 And he walked into this room and said,
 "Don't fear."
 And he just he breathed on him and said,
 "Receive the Holy Spirit."
 Well, they did.
 And then he told them,
 "Don't leave Jerusalem until you receive the promise
 "from on high."
 And so that was in the book of Acts, as we know,
 Acts chapter two.
 They received the day of Pentecost.
 They received the baptism of the Holy Spirit
 'cause he said, "You will receive power
 once the Holy Spirit comes on you."
 And so why it happens like that, I have no idea,
 but it's a truth that happens and so it happened to me.
 So that's what happened to me, the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Right answer.
  </li><li>Yep, and so I remember going back to the people
 in our church and I said,
 "You are not gonna believe what just happened to me."
  </li><li>Surprise!
 (laughing)
 You're not gonna believe this.
 And I said, I receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
 And I remember I told my dad first,
 'cause I thought he would be the most happy for me
 because I mean, seriously, he had a really hard time
 when I was in the five years of that.
  </li><li>I'm trying to imagine being a parent
 and watching your kid walk away.
  </li><li>He caught me with drugs.
 He caught me with stuff and just broke his heart.
  </li><li>I'm sure.
  </li><li>So I went to him, met him at work.
 He was working at the airport
 and it's back then you could just walk in
 and not go through security.
 So, told him that, and his reaction was,
 like his eyes rolled back into his head.
 And I thought, is this, is he relieved?
 Is this a relief?
 Like, thank God, he let out this big sigh.
 And then he said, I cannot believe you've done that.
 And I was like, what?
 What are you talking about?
  </li><li>Oh.
 And he says, "I cannot believe this."
 And I was like, "Do you mean this bad or?"
 And he meant it bad.
 And I said, "Dad, it's not what you think, right?
 It's the best thing, right?
 Unbelievable."
 I mean, it's, and so that was my first inclination that,
 you know, something might be wrong in paradise.
 So I had, so when the young adults came back from there,
 Retreat we met on Monday night and I told them
 It's guys it is it is not what you think right? It's the most amazing thing ever and
 So we went to pray for a person and
 Back you got on one side. I got on the other side. I didn't know what to do. It's like come Holy Spirit
 so we prayed he came and
 Anyway, this guy manifested so
 Which I didn't know anything about manifestations anyway
 The juxtap of all this was we were not received well, and that was one of the hardest things that we had to go through probably the next
 year
 We were not well received see were you ostracized or are?
 Yeah, we were I mean eventually we were we were we were actually asked to leave the church
 But it came through a really cool
 this thing happened. This lady started coming to our Bible study and we'd never seen her
 before. I'd never seen her in the church. We didn't have that big of a church, maybe
 300 people. She shows up one night and we're talking and she says, "Hey, you guys believe
 in deliverance?" We were like, "Oh." Because that's another bad. That's another bad.
 I was like, "X day on the deliverance day."
 You know, let's not, you know,
 meet me over here.
 So we got to talk into her.
 She said, "Well, do you guys believe in deliverance?"
 We couldn't say openly all of us did, but Becky and I did.
 We were like, "Yeah, we do."
 She said, "Why do you need to be delivered?"
 She said, "I'm a chain smoker."
 And I read this thing that it's actually,
 you can actually be delivered from that.
 So I said, "Oh, okay."
 So we set up a time.
 We didn't know what we were doing.
 We called these other people that were going
 the church that we were attending at Belmont and they had a deliverance ministry and I said,
 "Doug, what do we do?" And he says, "Well, you just have them forgive everyone that they can
 forgive and then you just start casting that thing out and the name of Jesus that has to leave."
 So we're like, "Okay." So deliverance one-on-one. So we bring this lady into the church and it was
 on a Thursday night so there was no meetings. And we did it. And so I remember telling the
 Lord, because we had been so kind of ostracized about the baptism, the Holy Spirit.
 How is it going to bring it up?
 I said, Lord, if you want her to know that, you let me know.
 And so we pray for her and bless her heart.
 You know, she at one point, she was just, I said, is anything happening?
 She said, well, here's on the back of my neck or standing up and I said, okay, well,
 that's good.
 And we just kept going.
 And anyway, so she got delivered and she was sitting there kind of puzzled, kind
 of staring off into space.
 And I said, what are you thinking?
 She said, the word baptism keeps coming back to me and I went, Oh, my word.
 So we knew that was the Lord telling us we prayed for her to receive the baptism, the Holy Spirit.
 So we left.
 It was over.
 We left Sunday.
 She shows up to us walking towards us with her Bible open with this look on her face.
 Like, do you pointing to her Bible?
 Do you know that there's so much more that's in here that she pointed to the floor, the church, then what's in here?
 meaning in the church.
 And it was like, you know, I've told you this before, it was like, best way to describe
 it was Helen Keller's teaching teacher getting a breakthrough with Helen going, Oh my gosh,
 she's finally getting it.
 Right.
 So we're like, Yes, we understand.
 We understand.
 So finally, you know, someone caught it.
 And she said, did she catch it?
 But she moved that following day to another state and lived with five people in a big house
 that we're all chain smokers and she never touched another cigarette.
 We're still in contact with her.
 She's never touched another cigarette.
 So, oh my gosh.
 All right.
 We just wrap this up, but hold that thought for two seconds.
 We're going to eat to pray for people for the battle and the Holy Spirit
 and for deliverance from cigarettes.
 Seriously, we're going to do that in a second.
 But I want to invite anybody who's in the Nashville area.
 October 23rd to 26th, we're having a phenomenal conference at
 grace and our code heaven declares. We have RT Kendall who's an
 Asaree.
 X Nazaree and Cheris.
 X Nazaree.
 RT is just this amazing, amazing man of God. We love him
 to bits. He's a world renowned theologian, an author of so many
 books and an excellent teacher. And he's going to be with us
 and then John Paul Jackson and Bobby Connor both widely regarded,
 highly regarded prophetic voices are going to be with us as
 well. If you go to heavendeclares.info, we'll put a link
 in the show notes. We'd love you to come. If you live, I would say the Nashville and
 there's no way you can come. We are going to be streaming it. We'll have information on how you
 can sign in and watch the conference. We really encourage you to do that. But as we leave today,
 I want to thank Jeff for standing in for AJ. You make a great understudy for AJ.
 But I'm going to ask Jeff if you would pray for everybody who's listening for
 bachelor's in the Holy Spirit, for more of the Holy Spirit and for delivering from...
 Okay. Yeah. I mean, I have to do that. So if, yeah, if you're one of those, that's like, I want this,
 I'm going to ask that you, first of all, if there's any sin in your life that you're holding on to,
 that you kind of take that and trade that in to the Father, say, Father, I'm willing to give this
 up in order to have more of you, and do that, just do that now, just say, Father, you know, I repent of
 this and handed over to him. So you don't want to anything that's from the enemy's camp to be
 in your possession. And so as you do that, and as you've done that, I'm going to pray for you. So
 father, we just reach out right now to whomever's listening. And we just say, Holy Spirit, would
 you come would you come upon this one right now? From the top of their head to the bottom of their
 feet. Holy Spirit, would you just blow and would you so pour out this seal of hope?
 Just bless you with the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Just allow that to happen.
 If you want to say something, begin to respond, whatever it is, whatever you want to do,
 thank you, Lord. Or thank you that if we ask for
 bread, you're not going to give us a stone.
 So we just take time to allow the Holy Spirit to minister to you.
 That's right. Just receive. Breathe Him in. Let Him give you a divine exchange.
 Life for heaviness. Thank you, Lord. If you have an addiction,
 You're addicted to things, cigarettes, whatever, but I want to pray for you.
 Just father would just take authority over the spirit, over the spirits, in the name of Jesus,
 and at the name of Jesus, we command you to leave.
 Leave, leave, leave in the name of Jesus.
 You're not welcome here.
 Leave.
 At the name of Jesus, the name that's above every name, every knee will bow, every tongue
 will confess that Jesus is Lord.
 And I also want to encourage you that after this that you ask the Lord, is there anyone
 that I need to forgive. You write that person's name down and you release them. You forgive
 them from any form of punishment that you think they deserve that you'd release them.
 No more. We forgive them, Father, in the name of Jesus like you've forgiven us. Amen.
