<p> AJ Jones, my love, my love, my farewell. How are you?
 I'm good.<br/>
 You lie, where you have been on a colon cleanse and I declare you cannot be good while doing
 what you have been doing.<br/>
 Well, I've been, yes, I've been on the cleanse now for seven days, I guess. But for the
 last three days, I've been doing the just water and apple juice and drinking the sludge
 for the cleanse thing.<br/>
 Yeah, it's probably worth letting our listeners know that the sludge is a pretty accurate description. It looks like
 Chewy sand, reino or<br/>
 Mr. Muscle you know the stuff you poured on the sink and then it expands and pulls off the grime
 That's effectively what it's doing to your innards. Yep. It cleans out your intestines and your colon. Yeah, baby
 And then once you finish this insanity then what happens?
 Well, then I have another 21 days well, I have like four days of break
 week. And then I have another 21 days of cleansing all the other organs.
 And since you posted this on Facebook and or Twitter and or Instagram, you've had lots
 of people asking you which one are you doing and can I do it? So where did you get this?
 I got it from blessed herbs.com. And if you're a European listener, herbs has a, heh, other
 for another so it's blessed herbs.
</p><ul>
  <li>That's so funny that I said herbs instead.
 I must be acclimatizing to my new environment.
  </li><li>You must be acclimating to your new environment.
  </li><li>Well, whatever.
  </li><li>Right, absolutely.
  </li><li>I'm doing one of those things.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Now, do anybody get any discounts off them
 because they know you?
  </li><li>Yes, if they email me, I can send them
 a coupon for a discount.
  </li><li>So if you would like to pay money
 and pay slightly less money,
 to make yourself do things that your body really shouldn't do
 then see AJ.
  </li><li>Babe, it's not things that your body shouldn't do.
 It's good to detoxify your body.
 We traveled like crazy.
 If you're feeling brave, go to the blessederbe.com
 and search for the photo testimonials now.
 (laughs)
 I don't wanna make this an R-rated podcast,
 but you have been warned.
 It's not pretty.
 It's pretty revolting.
 Try and tell me your body's supposed to do that.
 Well, do you want that in your body?
 That's the real question, or would you rather have it out?
 But I have to say, actually, the last three days has been,
 it hasn't been hard except that I have
 for seven out of nine meals,
 watched people eating some of my favorite food
 and sat there and drank water.
 That was pretty brutal.
 And then the other two,
 I got to make food for the kids and for you.
 So that's not my favorite part,
 but it's actually, I'm feeling really good.
  </li><li>Well, I'm sorry that I put you through that.
 Especially when I had steak tacos today,
 chial examiners.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you guys had guacamole to start.
 It was horrible.
  </li><li>Well, don't worry babe, only in 28 days,
 you two will be able to have guacamole.
 I can start eating again on Sunday.
  </li><li>I think I misunderstood.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Speaking of food, we said last week
 we were gonna try and eat somewhere new.
 We had the luxury of doing that this week
 when we met our dear friends Mason and Emily
 up in German time.
  </li><li>By we he means him because of course I watched.
  </li><li>I'm actually quite certain.
  </li><li>I'm actually, I was fasting too.
 So me and Emily had some really nice food
 at the mad platter.
 Apparently it's the oldest restaurant in German time.
 I'm not sure that's true.
 I'm sure Nash Villian will email me to correct me,
 but it was pretty good.
 I had a chicken salad.
 I must be turning into a southern herb
 because if this pimento cheese on the menu
 or if there is chicken salad on the menu,
 that's going straight in my gullet.
  </li><li>You could probably get deliverance for that.
  </li><li>I don't want deliverance from that.
 I'll keep the pimento demon.
  </li><li>Emily had crab cakes and they smelled astronomical.
 If you can decide by the smell,
 which I feel you can, they seemed excellent.
  </li><li>All right, I wanted to talk this week.
 We talked last week a little bit about marriage.
 This week I wanted to talk about a completely different topic.
 I wanted to talk about dreams.
  </li><li>Sounds good.
  </li><li>And I don't mean your hopes and your dreams
 and your aspirations.
  </li><li>Aah.
  </li><li>I wanted to talk about dreams
 because despite the fact that the Bible is littered
 with people having dreams and God speaking through dreams,
 somehow in my upbringing or by osmosis
 or by the church culture I was in,
 we stop believing that God spoke through dreams.
 And I remember reading a book.
 I think it was Dr. Jack Deere's surprise
 by the voice of God, which is a superb book.
 If you've never read it, I can't encourage it
 highly enough to you.
 But in there, he started talking about
 God speaking through dreams and I was kind of skeptical
 until I had a dream.
 And I remember this dream really well
 because it caught my attention,
 but I had a dream that I was in Belgium.
 And at the time I lived in Scotland,
 but I had a dream I was in Belgium
 And I was getting out of a train.
 And as I departed the train station,
 I had to climb a large set of stairs.
 And at the top of the stairs were two young men
 who were handing out leaflets.
 And they came over and handed me one.
 And the leaflet was all written in French.
 And I tried to understand it, couldn't understand any of it.
 So I'm trying to use all my schoolboy French
 to kind of understand it, like, "Merkredi."
 Is that Wednesday?
 Like, what is this?
 And so these two young men,
 They come back to me and they said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
 And I'm like, "No, I don't."
 And so they explained to me and then they said, "Can we pray for you?"
 And I said, "Yes, you can."
 And as they prayed for me, what I would describe now, but I didn't know then, was the power
 of God hit me, everything went white and I woke right up.
 And I thought that was a stranger stream ever.
 So I got up and for some reason I wrote down my journal, I wasn't into recording my dreams
 or anything at that point.
 I just wrote it down.
 I don't know if it was a couple of weeks or a couple of months I should dig out my old
 journals.
 I happened to be in Belgium.
 I was visiting a friend from university and I was on a train and I got off the train
 at the train station and I walked up a flight of steps to get to street level and at the
 top of the steps there was two young men and they handed me a sheet of paper.
 The sheet paper was all in French and so with my best school boy French I'm trying
 to translate it into English.
 I don't really understand what it says.
 They said, "Sir, do you understand what you're reading?"
 I said, "I don't."
 And they said, well, we're from a church in Florida.
 We're from a church in Brownsville.
 Uh, is that a place?
 Brownville?
 No, Brownsville was the name of the church in Pensacola.
 In Pensacola.
 Yeah.
 We're from the Brownsville Revival at church in Pensacola.
 And we're here telling people about Jesus.
 Could we pray for you?
 And I hadn't put two and two together.
 I just said, yes, I'd love you to.
 And as they prayed for me, I fell onto the floor in the middle of Belgium.
 And I had, I had a real experience with God.
 And when I realized what just happened, I kind of squealed with delight and they looked at me like what is going on.
 And I pull up my journal and I read to them the dream that I'd had weeks or months before.
 And of course, there was ecstatic as I was.
 And that I think was the first dream for me where I was like, OK, God, I'm going to start paying attention to my dreams because clearly you're speaking to me.
 And I remember a couple of months later, I had another dream similar to that.
 But when I met you, I don't know if you taught on the school and I heard you, but somehow I heard about
 when God started speaking to you through dreams.
 And I want you to tell everybody the dream about when you worked for
 in your old job.
 For national.
 Well, okay.
 So I had by this, by the time I was working for national, I already knew that I heard from the Lord through dreams.
 I knew that that was a normal way for me to hear from him.
 How did you know that you just had experience?
 I had probably about 20 dreams that I could look back at and know that I would dream something
 within a few days it would happen.
 So I knew how I felt waking up from those dreams.
 I knew when they were that kind of dream.
 So you weren't in an office like I was?
 Well not the dreams that you're asking me to tell, not when I got to doing the national.
 So I was working for National Car Rental.
 And with the first stream, I was what I did for National at this particular time was I
 was traveling from department to department and I was learning to oversee different departments
 because they were training me for like city management.
 And so I was in the licensee department at the time and the reason, the only reason that's
 important is I was sharing a space with the executive secretary.
 And so I'm trying to remember the order everything happened in.
 So when we sat at our desks, we faced each other.
 So one night, it was a Thursday night, I had a dream.
 And in the dream, our current president, who was a guy named Todd, in the dream, he moves
 to Minneapolis.
 He takes over a car company called Car Temps USA, which I wasn't sure even existed.
 We get a new present who comes from Florida and that new present has two blond sons.
 That's all I know in the dream.
 There's three managers that leave.
 I go in on the Friday morning and I'm sitting across from Darlene who is executive secretary
 and I said to her, "Hey, do you know if Todd's planning on leaving?"
 And she said, "No, why?"
 And I said, "Oh, I just had a dream and it's just the kind of dream that feels like it's
 probably going to happen."
 And she said, "Oh, well, what did you dream?"
 And I said, "Oh, I dreamt that he moved to Minneapolis, took over Cartevans USA.
 We got a new president from Florida, and he was a dark-haired guy, and he has two blonde
 sons."
 And she's like, "Oh, so strange."
 And I'm like, yeah, and then there was like three managers that left him, whatever.
 So she, I mean, I had been trying to talk to her about the Lord and she was really kind
 of shut down to chatting with me about anything.
 I mean, she was very, very sweet, but she didn't want to talk about God.
 And so anyway, so she was like, oh, weird.
 And I was like, yeah.
 So Monday morning I come in and I sit down at my desk and she's looking at me like a
 deer and headlights.
 Like she's like, been shocked by something.
 So I looked to her and said, "Darlene, are you okay?"
 And she said, "Tod's leaving.
 "He's moving to Minneapolis.
 "He's taking over Car Temps USA,
 "which apparently is an actual company."
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>And she said, "We have a new president.
 "He's coming from Florida.
 "His name is Paul."
 And I said, "Does he have two blonde sons?"
 And she goes, "No, I asked.
 "He has three dark-haired daughters."
 And I was like, "Okay."
 Thinking, "Wow, you asked.
 "Okay, that's kind of cool."
 And she goes, "Who are the three managers that are leaving?"
 And I said, "No, I'm not doing that."
 But I said, "What I will do, Darlene,
 is I will write them down,
 I'll write down the order that they leave in,
 and I'll put it in an envelope.
 And you and I will both sign this envelope."
 So we know it's the only envelope that looks like that.
 And I'm gonna stick it my drawer.
 If those managers leave in that order,
 then we'll open it on one condition.
 She's like, "What?"
 And I said, "You will go out to lunch with me,
 and you will let me tell you about why I know God
 real why Jesus is awesome. So she's like that's fine. Anyway Wednesday comes along and on Wednesday
 Paul the new president comes up to you know see what he's taking over because they move really fast. Right and meet staff and stuff like that
 Yeah, and so he comes up and so the front desk calls and says he's coming
 He's gonna be coming down the hallway and so we're you know
 We all get ready and he's with his wife and his three daughters
 And as he comes around the corner starts walking down the hallway
 There is wife three daughters and has two blond sons that he's just adopted from Romania. Oh my gosh
 Yeah, so poor Darlene upon meeting him shakes his hand doesn't even say her own name and says you have two blond sons
 So I felt kind of bad
 but anyway, so the three managers did ultimately leave within a couple of months and
 In the right order and so are we open the envelope and she went up for lunch with me and she said well
 AJ, I would have sworn that there's no God, but clearly you hear from him so he must exist.
 And so that was pretty cool.
 Man, that's so crazy.
 Like most of the dreams I know that people have are not as clear as that.
 And to be fair, most of the dreams I have are nowhere near as clear as the dream you
 just told or the dream I told about being in Belgium.
 Most of my dreams are symbolic.
 As in most people's dreams are, I think.
 certainly if you look in scripture, the majority of the dreams are all symbolic.
 Do you ever have symbolic dreams?
 Are they all as crystal clear as that?
 I don't often have symbolic dreams.
 I have had a couple and I'm not very good at interpreting them.
 So I think maybe God gives me straight forward dreams because he knows I can't
 be bothered with interpretation.
 That's terrible.
 That's ridiculous.
 But I mean, with that dream that I told you that the cool thing about
 That was actually a couple of months down the road.
 Do you remember the dream that I had a couple of months down the road?
 That's right.
 And I had a dream about Paul a few months down the road.
 Paul was Jewish, his family was Jewish, and they're lovely.
 And of course, Darlene was atheist.
 And anyway, I had this dream one night.
 An atheist who now admits that--
 God must exist.
 --that must be real.
 Right.
 So she's not a very good atheist.
 Yes, she's a wavering backsliding atheist.
 She's a backside engage.
 Yes, Lord.
 More of those.
 So I'm working at a different department at this point.
 I have a dream that Paul is out with the senior team of the VPs and all that kind of stuff.
 I have a dream that he's out with them and he has a massive heart attack and he falls
 to the floor and later in the dream I walk into a hospital room and his wife is there
 and I say to the hospital to sorry to his wife.
 I walk in and I say to his wife, you know, I know in the dream that they've advised some
 sort of radical surgery and they said he's never going to come out of this or something.
 And in the dream, I say, don't do it.
 He'll be awake tomorrow and he'll be better than he ever was.
 And then I wake up.
 So when I woke up, I wrote the whole dream down in like on a word thing at work.
 It's because you didn't know me yet.
 You're still using Microsoft.
 I know.
 I know.
 I know.
 Since repenting we digress. I'm sorry
 So I just you know sort away and I sent darlene a email and I just said hey
 If I because I didn't want to freak her out
 So I said if anything happens to any of the senior management team
 Could you just let me know and she emailed right back and said have you had another dream?
 So I emailed back and said I have but I'm not going to send it to you unless something happens
 Well, two days later, Paul falls down at the Detroit Auto Show with all of our senior team
 there and has a massive heart attack.
 They take him to the hospital.
 He's not conscious.
 The wife flies in.
 She's getting all this information and she sends it to me and she says, "Paul's had a
 massive..."
 Who's she?
 Darlene.
 The secretary.
 Yeah, the atheist secretary.
 He's me.
 She emails me and she says, "Paul's had a massive heart attack.
 Is that what you dreamed?
 I said it is, I'm gonna send you the email.
 So here now we have an atheist woman
 who calls the Jewish wife to say,
 okay, here's the background.
 She knew you guys were coming.
 She explains the whole previous dream.
 Says I'm a Christian.
 She knows that I hear from the Lord
 and that I've had this dream and she reads it to her
 and of course I dated it and everything.
 And she says, they're gonna advise you to do radical surgery
 in the dream.
 She says, don't do it.
 He'll wake up in the morning
 and he'll be better than he ever was.
 And she says, the wife says,
 well, they have advised some sort of radical surgery.
 And so the wife based on an atheist
 repeating a Christian's dream decides not to do the surgery,
 she says, I will wait till morning then.
 And she waits till morning and Paul comes out of,
 I don't know if it was a coma or he becomes conscious again.
 And within a few months, he really was healthier
 than he had ever been, but he was pretty freaked out by me.
 Oh, I'm sure.
 Because of the whole.
 I'm sure.
 Did everybody ever say, "Hey, here's some NyQuil.
 Please get me the lottery numbers for this week."
 Well, I used to joke around with people when they'd say, "Hey, could you give me a prophetic
 word?"
 And I'm like, "Do I have time for a nap?"
 Yeah, 'cause you dream.
 Yeah, 'cause I'm a dreamer.
 What did...
 So one of the best people that I would say has got some of the greatest teaching out there
 on understanding dreams is John Paul Jackson.
 And we had the pleasure and the privilege of having John Paul up in Toronto many times.
 at one time he came in and did a weekend on dreams
 and we were having lunch and you got to ask him
 about your dreams.
 And I loved his answer.
 It was so matter of fact,
 yeah, left us with more questions.
 But you asked him, what you asking me?
 You asked him about your dreams.
  </li><li>I told him a couple of my dreams.
 Like I explained what they're like
 and that there is also another dream that I have
 and I've had it recuringly where I'm just,
 I'm in the dark and I'm just having a conversation with God.
 I'm asking questions, he's audibly answering questions.
  </li><li>Right, these are repeating dreams.
 They're different content.
  </li><li>Different content, but I've had this occurrence
 several times where I can ask whatever
 and he tells me dates and stuff like that.
 And so I explained those and I explained the other dreams
 and he said, "You're not having dreams,
 "you're having visitations of the night."
  </li><li>So we were like, "Who, okay."
  </li><li>Which didn't help me much, 'cause I was like,
 "When does that mean?"
  </li><li>"When does that mean?"
  </li><li>I'm not sure what you do,
 visitations of the night.
 Yeah, I'd say John Paul and our dear friend James Gall and our dear friend Sarah Jackson in Toronto
 have got some of the best teaching that we've heard. Sarah hasn't written a book. John Paul's
 written many. James has written a wonderful book. I think it's called Understanding Dreams and
 Visions. I'll post the notes in the show notes. But I think one of the greatest joys for me is
 hearing from the Lord and Dreams, in part because you really can't bring in much interference. Like
 like if I'm praying for you or I'm prophesying with you or I have a vision, I've got some
 element of my own contribution I can make. Well, when you're asleep, you're asleep.
 I, you know, that everybody's wish that they could control the dreams. So I really love
 the dream for that verse in Proverbs says, it's the glory of God to conceal a matter.
 It's the glory of kings to search a matter out. And I love that verse because part of
 the thing is that God loves to wrap things up in riddles and symbolism and.
 Yeah, so I have to go back to him to get the answers.
 I love waking up with a dream that I know is significant, but I don't know what it means.
 And then I love getting to ponder it with God, you know, go for coughing to sit and say,
 you know, Lord, did you give me the interpretation of this?
 And then run it by people who are more skilled at dream interpretation than I.
 And we've, I mean, we moved to Nashville.
 I would say on the strength of it.
 I mean, it wasn't just one dream, but you already knew we're moving to Nashville,
 the profit you are. And I didn't. I was just like, "Lord, give me a word." And I had probably the most
 significant dream I would have ever had in my life in Iceland, which, you know, kickstarted the whole
 process. So I love dreams. And I'm only sorry that to me so long to realize that God still speaks
 through dreams. If you go to the show notes for this week's show, I will post links and resources
 to books and teaching resources that will help you if you want a journey in understanding
 your dreams.
 I wonder, AJ, if you would pray for everybody who's listening for an impartation of dreams,
 you would just activate your faith and just say, "Jesus?"
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So, Father, I just thank you for every single person that's listening.
 And Lord, I ask that you would reawaken our hearts and minds to dream with you like never
 before. Lord, I ask that you would just speak to us in the night and Father, I am part
 the gift of being able to dream and connect with you in that way. Lord, I ask that you
 would invade our thoughts and minds and you'd give people really great rest while giving
 them really awesome revelation in Jesus name. And also Father, for the people who had dreams
 as kids, but have freaked them out so they shut it down. But I just ask that you would
 stir up gently that gift that you gave them. And that for those of us who do dream Lord,
 you would increase our dream life, that you would increase the revelation that we get at night.
 And you would minister to our souls, you'd come and speak to us and give us understanding
 and give us revelation about dreams. Yeah, that's an interesting point actually, Alan,
 because I've always been a dreamer, but I used to have night terrors and nightmares, like really,
 really vivid that seemed totally real kind of night terrors. And it put me off dreaming for years
 years and years and years. Like I was just terrified to dream. So I think sometimes that
 kind of activity can be a good indication that actually God wants to speak to you through
 dreams and the enemy just tries to shut you down in that area. So it's a great thing also
 if you've decided not to dream to just repent of any way you've taken control of your own
 ability to dream or you know what I mean? And just sort of say, "Okay Lord, I'm going
 trust you again. But I for years would put my hand on my own forehead and pray over myself
 when I go to bed and say, "Okay, Lord, I'm trusting you and I'm only going to dream your
 dreams and your thoughts and I reject any other access and whatever." So just a thought for those
 of you that have been freaked out by dreaming before.
 Very good. If you have any questions you want to ask us about the topic of dreams or if there's
 there's any questions you'd like us to discuss as a topic on the podcast.
 Go to Alan and AJ.com/ask and you can give us your thoughts right there.
 This week coming up, we have got the more conference that kicks off on May 23rd.
 Whoop, whoop, on the Friday.
 Yeah.
 On the Friday of the Memorial Day, we can't run all the way through to the Monday.
 And we'd love you to come if you're in the Nashville area, go to musthavemore.com
 to get information about that.
 Chris McLaurney and Luke Finch, your lead in worship.
 AJ and I are going to be teaching, along with our dear friend Dave Campbell all the way
 from England, on the Monday afternoon, which would be the Monday 26th.
 I think I'm just making up those dates.
 Let me just check.
 No, I think that's right.
 Yeah, on the Monday 26th, I was right.
 We are having an open to everyone Memorial Day picnic in the park.
 So Grey Center sits on some really nice lush grass that will be sprayed for ticks, do not
 for you. We've invited some great food trucks from around Nashville to come and serve you
 food including Jenny's ice cream. It's going to be amazing. That is a free event. Of course
 you will need to buy your own food from the food trucks, but there's no charge to come
 to the picnic. We'd love you to come. The final session of the conference which is held
 Monday night is also a free session open to everybody. If you're in the area or perhaps
 you've been away from Memorial Day weekend, but you get back here on the Monday, come
 John is at three o'clock for the picnic and then stay for the evening service and we know
 you're going to have an amazing time. Yeah, I mean even if you're just looking for something to do
 on Memorial Day weekend because lots of people go someplace else. If Nashville is close enough
 to be that someplace else and you're interested, come on out, we'd love to have you. Yeah, we'd
 love to have you. All right, well that's all for this week. We will see you next week. We pray
 have an amazing week full of dreams, full of encounters with God and full of goodness.
