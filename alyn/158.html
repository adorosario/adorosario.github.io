<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones yes sir how the heck are you i'm good how are you i'm good i'm back from vacation yes we are.
 Did you enjoy your vacation i i did let's play the game of comparing contrast between stay cation and vacation go.
 Oh, well it's hard I think to do that well because most of the first week of our stay
 patient I was still in an enormous amount of pain so we didn't really get to make good
 use of it.<br/>
 I forgot about that.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah you were flat on your back.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So I vacation for me this year was a little bit less restful vacationy than normal because
 of the pain.<br/>
 You were bad for four days.<br/>
 I was more rested.<br/>
 Oh I see what you're saying.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I have a glamorous idea of staycation I think is going to be awesome and we get to stuff done around the house and all these projects can be great yeah,
 and I found that this year when staycation happened I just got hit with a bucket load of shame yeah.
 What do you mean yeah.<br/>
 Because we had several conversations about it.
 No thanks sorry to burden you was feelings of my heart i feel the same and what i mean by that is,
 i don't i don't know if i just put pressure myself but i'm just thinking.
 Oh you you didn't steward your resources well or you didn't budget for vacation or.
 And you know got by kids are doing their best to like wait so what we're doing this year to stay home and we try to do a fun activity every day.
 But i just realized my idea vacations being left alone and you can't do that when you have a family no.
 No, it's very difficult. Especially when they're the ages that our kids are, you know, yeah, they want to, they want to do something. And I think when they were little or they didn't so much notice that we didn't really, we didn't really.
 Do vacations really into a couple years ago, right.
 And so we've only we're only learning the other difficulty is that they've they were on the staycation before we ever work. For example, they were off school.
 but at home while we were at work right so for them having my main daddy not at work.
 Didn't feel any different for them like wait we're still at home we're still at home we're still just going to the pool or doing.
 A couple hours of activity at some point so that didn't feel so fun for them so yeah we were doing our stay cation and try make the best of it.
 And admittedly it was nice not being at work but i think the previous couple months of beaten snow out of us really yeah for sure so we were.
 you know feeling pretty run down and one day i checked my bank account and to my shock there's a
 $2,200 credit so i i don't know who it's from i can't see so i caught the bank and the bank are
 like oh we don't we don't actually know where the money came from and i'm like how do you not know
 where the money came from right it appeared in my account oh you like you must have a way of tracking
 that they're like we honestly don't and i was like well where do we go from here because i don't
 I don't want to spend money if it's not mine to spend.
 They're like, well, I can have our back office look into where that money came from.
 I was like, yeah, would you?<br/>
 So the back office looked into it and they said, they were next to you.
 So they just said, we don't know either.
 So we were like, huh, Lord, here we are praying for a vacation.
 And here's $2,200.<br/>
 It's just landed in our back account.<br/>
 And I hadn't actually used my birthday money.
 Again, I think we talked about this on a previous episode.
 Our friends from around the world were so generous
 and put together a big surprise for my birthday.
 You know, like a drone and some stereo speakers
 and a huge cash gift.<br/>
 And I wasn't sure what to do with it.<br/>
 So I realized, man, if we put this $2,200
 plus my cash gift for birthday,<br/>
 that's enough to do a last minute Disney trip.
 So we upped an ald on it, didn't we?<br/>
 We had a date one day to talk about it.
 By Monday afternoon, we found an Airbnb in Florida.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And by Tuesday morning, at 6 a.m., we packed a car
 with all the kids close, woke them up, shoved them in the car.
 They were all like, "What, where are we going?
 "What are we doing?"
 And we were like, "We're gonna Disney!"
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 It was so fun.
 I mean, we're, again, sort of heavily reliant on,
 you know, Christy, 'cause of our backs
 and that kind of stuff.
 Kate had me pack the car and clean the car and all that.
 but it was so fun to surprise the kids and get out the door.
  </li><li>For those of you who are wondering who Kristy is,
 Kristy is our friend from Scotland
 who's staying with us for the summer.
 And so she only were like, "Hey, guess what?
 "You're going to Disney tomorrow."
 She was like, "Oh, great, never been to Disney."
  </li><li>It was quite fun to watch her processing Disney.
  </li><li>It's been fun watching her process America, period.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This little 17 year old girl
 who's lived in Scotland her whole life
 and then comes and lives in America.
 I'm like, "No, no, Waffles is what we have
 "for breakfast every morning."
 And that's why we are the size we are.
 Welcome to America.
  </li><li>So we did Disney, we did a park a day.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And it's, I don't know, we honeymoon in Disney.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>And we've been back a couple of times.
 So I feel like I know my way around Disney
 better than I know my way around Franklin.
  </li><li>Yep, you were a boss.
  </li><li>I was a boss.
 I knew where everything was, mostly.
 But praise God for the app.
 What would be your top tips for people going with Disney?
  </li><li>Use the fast passes.
 They're awesome.
  </li><li>Well, use the app to book your fast passes.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I was amazed how many people I saw
 physically walking to a fast pass machine to,
 I was like, guys.
  </li><li>At the actual ride and stuff.
  </li><li>On your phone.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>The Mide doesn't experience that for your phone.
 Worked pretty much all of the time.
 There was a few glitches, but it's an amazing thing.
 So yeah, fast passes.
  </li><li>And if you wanna get on the new ride,
 you have to fast pass like a couple of months out.
  </li><li>Yeah, you can, you can, fast passes basically a way
 where you can kind of pre-book a time to arrive for your ride and you end up in a shorter line.
 And I think Fast Pass has opened 120 days early. So for example, we only had a couple of days to
 try and book Avatar. We had one day. We couldn't book any Fast Pass for that. So we waited in line
 for hours. Yeah. Oh, wow. But you're dining early. Yeah, for sure. And then taking Nanny, if you can.
 Gosh, that made a difference.
 Yeah, it was so great.
 Again, having Christy with us was so helpful because, you know, we could go back in the
 evening when the kids are exhausted and let them have dinner and go to bed.
 And then we went back to the park and had some date nights, didn't we?
 We just rolled around laughing all the people with children.
 We sound like horrible people.
 Oh, no, we didn't laugh.
 We were just like, oh, yeah, being there and done that.
 Yeah.
 I felt really bad for the ones that had crying children because we're like, oh, yeah, I feel bad for the ones with strollers.
 I feel like at the start of your day at Disney, you're like, oh my gosh, this is a happiest place on earth.
 And by the end of your day days, you're like, get out of my way.
 And you forget that you're safe.
 I remember one trip and this was made worse by the fat Tia was in a stroller at the time,
 but I was pushing the stroller down Main Street and, you know, how they have those, like, I guess tram lines and the wheel got caught in it.
 Yeah.
 And somebody walked in front of me bumped into it and I said something and kind and you're like, babe, you're a pastor.
 As a pastor on the edge.
 Yeah, that's one degree.
 The one night that we went to Magic Kingdom, this trip and we sort of left when the park was closing, which we we've never stayed until the park was closing.
 It took us an hour to get from Main Street to our car.
 Right.
 just out to the parking lot. Just trying to get to parking lot was like
 hurting. And every once in a while, I would move like a cow because I found it
 amazing. And some people thought it was funny, but others did not.
 How was your transition back to work? Which, by the way, was this week?
 I think because of the amount of pain I was enduring vacation,
 I don't feel like my body physically got to rest. So I don't feel as
 those restors I'd like to going back into work, if that makes sense.
 Yeah, it does.
 But I mean, I love who we work with and I love what we do.
 So on one level, it's easy to go back to work.
 On the other level, it's rough because you're like, "Oh, I have to get up on time.
 Oh, I can't just stay home and, you know, whatever, cuddle the kids and watch TV and,
 you know, eat Cheerios or whatever."
 That was a mighty list of things you achieved in the morning.
 I was like, "I just put on clothes."
 You know.
 Some days you didn't.
 No, some days I just stayed in pajamas all day.
 It was impressive.
 It was glorious.
 Yeah, for me, I spoke this morning and on my way,
 and I was like, "I haven't spoken in public for..."
 I don't even remember the last time I preached.
 I was like, "Can I even do this?"
 I just felt so rusty.
 You know what? I forgot?
 I forgot how tiring it is to preach.
 It's exhausting.
 Right. Now, put that in context,
 because if you haven't done that, that sounds ridiculous, especially if you do manual labor
 for a job, it sounds pathetic for us to say. I'm tired of standing up, but ask any school
 teacher. Public speaking is tiring, but I also think I've started a series of messages at Grace
 Center, and I feel some level of responsibility for making sure it's delivered well. Maybe perhaps
 more than I normally would in a message, and I think the preparation, the speaking, the constantly
 reading the room to work out where you are, watching the clock. But I was wiped out when
 I got home from church. And whenever I talk like this, I have to remember that my grandfather
 was down the coal mines at age 14. So I don't have it bad in comparison to that. But nevertheless,
 I was like, this is just a combination of vacation and out of practice. But I felt a little bit
 winded pray for your pastors, guys. Your pastors on a Sunday, man, that's a big day.
 Yep. Anything else happen in the last two weeks is noteworthy.
 Well, we've had this past Saturday, we had demo day at church.
 And so we're demoing an entire end of the church to make room for the new children's wing.
 I walked along there this morning and I probably shouldn't have done,
 I was in open-toed flip-flops going into a building site.
 No, you shouldn't.
 It was quite amazing.
 Did you see all the wires hanging down and all that?
  </li><li>I nearly put my eye out.
  </li><li>There was like 30 people from Grace Center
 that showed up, a bunch of guys all with their power tools
 and their sledgehammers and their raw attitude
 and they just, they got it done.
 It was amazing.
  </li><li>Where'd it go guys?
  </li><li>And there were some girls too, I should say that.
  </li><li>Yes, absolutely.
 I got a treat in the mail this week.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I don't think you realize this,
 but I joined Kickstarter and helped fund the Bible project
 book.
 Now the Bible project, you might have heard us talk about this,
 were huge fans of the Bible project.
 They're creators of video summaries of each book of the Bible,
 along with video summaries of major themes of the Bible.
 I'll put a link in the show note.
 They're absolutely incredible videos,
 really, really well produced, fascinating to watch,
 give a great overview.
 Anyway, they've done these brilliant animated videos
 about each book of the Bible,
 and they've produced a book with the illustration
 that goes along with a video for every book of the Bible.
 It's a beautiful coffee table book.
 It's really, really big, but it arrived this week.
 Did you know that?
  </li><li>I did know, I didn't get to look at it,
 but I saw that it had come in the mail.
  </li><li>Yeah, I've hidden it from you.
 I want to keep it in pristine condition, so.
  </li><li>So, and you're afraid I'm going to do what?
 Eat pizza, well, look me at the book or something.
  </li><li>Eat like Cheetos, turn my page and I'll be stained orange.
  </li><li>Well, you know how I love Cheetos.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>It's your one flaw, baby.
 So this week's topic comes courtesy of you.
 talking earlier and you were like, "Hey, I want to talk about this whole topic of learning."
 All right, take it away, Adjjuns.
 So, my thought was, I think the people that grow the most, or if I look at my life, the seasons
 where I've grown the most have been seasons where I have been open to learning something new, even in
 situations or moments where I really thought like I understood things fairly well.
 Right.
 But just keeping your heart and your mind open to the Holy Spirit trying to teach you
 something new either just through when you're reading the word or through just being
 in a service or something where somebody's teaching on something where previously
 you might have gone, Hmm, I don't really know what I think about that, but allowing
 your heart to be open and teachable and learning something that perhaps previously you weren't
 open to.
 It's one of the hardest challenges, I think.
 Anytime you hear information that sounds like it could contradict or jeopardize what
 you already know, it's amazing how we bolt down and brace ourselves for conflict rather
 than, rather than listening to what the person is trying to say and seeing if you're persuaded
 by the teaching.
 Right.
 It's a knee jerk reaction isn't it I'd buy don't know about this right such a difficult thing right and I you know I sort of think about
 In this isn't necessarily a Bible example
 But like when we met Josh Axe and started going to his office
 And we started learning all this stuff about health that we never knew before well, that's a good point
 So Josh Axe is a friend of ours. He's a health fanatic
 We'll put link in the show notes to his website. He's he's got a website that covers everything
 But when we first started getting to know Josh,
 so I was raised to believe that,
 you know, you don't want to eat white bread.
 It's just bleached flour.
 There's no nutritional value.
 What you want to eat is whole wheat bread.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Whole wheat bread is much better.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you don't want full fat milk.
 I mean, the fat in there is just terrible.
 You want some like good skimmed milk.
 Well, when I met Josh, he was like,
 "No, like milk of any kind is literally
 the worst thing you could put in your body."
 And I'm like, "What?"
 (laughs)
 Oh, and we and we shouldn't be having that.
 No, but I was like, no, no, no, whole week.
 That's a good stuff.
 And he's like, no, it's totally toxic to your body, totally inflammatory.
 And I'm like, this is flying in the face of everything I've been told.
 And by the way, I was told this by my mother and my mother loves me and my mother
 would never see.
 And so you're just kind of bolting down what you think, you know, and here I am
 arguing with somebody, you know, who's got way more experience, way more understanding
 has done way more study on this topic, but I'm convinced I'm right because of my
 previous understanding.
 Right. Only to find that. You're right.
 Yeah. So I, you know, I was thinking about that and I was thinking when I first got information from him about what we shouldn't be eating and, you know, microwaves and all that kind of stuff, I thought, this is going to be so much working.
 It's going to be so hard. It's going to be such a huge adjustment.
 But actually, I don't miss having a microwave and I don't miss the, you know what I mean?
 like down the road, once we were able to sort of process and go, "Oh, actually, this makes sense."
 And, you know, I can understand where the information is coming from. I'm going to choose to be
 teachable and learn something new here and realize, "Okay, I haven't spent my life studying nutrition,
 so that's why I didn't know that." But I'm going to take it from people who have studied
 nutrition and try and make a good change. But again, it's amazing how we will defend what we
 think we know against new incoming information.
 Right.
 And I still do it.
 Right.
 And so comfort zone.
 Right.
 I still do.
 I just, I'm doing it in different areas, but that was sort of the, the area, the example
 that I thought of to begin with was like, Oh, yeah, like with all that health stuff,
 I really thought I knew that stuff, you know, and it turns out there was so much that I
 didn't know I thought I was living healthy and I wasn't.
 So I was thinking about that kind of stuff.
 And then this morning, of course, you're teaching a whole new series at church where
 a couple of years ago, this wouldn't have been our paradigm at all.
 Right. In fact, it might have been our anti-paradigm.
 Right.
 As in, we may have fought against some of the stuff that I'm teaching because it felt,
 you know, I was talking this morning about how Paul writes about, you know, in the church,
 this first apostle, second prophet's third teachers. And I was like, "Hey, you know,
 I used to read that verse in bulk at that because, for example, I don't like the idea of hierarchy
 in church. I like this more egalitarian view where it's a level playing field. We're all
 the same in the kingdom of God. It's fine. But to be confronted with the fact that actually God
 has some level of order or flow or priority, that took a long time for me to kind of wrap my head
 around it. For God's sake, I didn't think prophets were real. Do you remember? I thought speaking
 tongues was of the devil. Right. You've come a long way. Oh, baby, let me tell you. I've come a long
 But to be fair, the whole apostles, prophets, teachers thing, you've been processing for
 two years with the Lord.
 So I'm not necessarily saying that learning is that you just accept whatever the new information
 is without study or process.
 I don't think that's learning.
 I think that that's probably dangerous on some level, you know, but I think when the Lord
 presents you with new information to keep your heart open and allow him to persuade you is actually wisdom.
 Right. It's also, yeah, it's being open to the possibility that you've got more to learn on a topic,
 which is probably by the very definition, humility.
 Yeah. I always find it funny, actually, like we've had a couple different people that will say things
 like, "Well, if you mention encounter weekend or you mentioned doing the school and you have,
 Sometimes we've seen the reaction of, well, you know, I've, I've already read
 inner healing books or I've already, I've already done inner healing or I've already done, you
 know, whatever. I don't need to go to ex conference because I already know about whatever the
 prophetic or whatever the thing is. And I think, I think that scares me a little bit when I hear
 that from people because I just think, gosh, guys, we've never arrived. Like you always can learn
 more, but you're going to miss what more you could learn by hiding in that place of just like,
 I've got it already.
 That's the whole thing of sometimes what we think we know can keep us from what we need
 to know.
 Right.
 I think it was David Campbell who said, "In order to be lifelong learners, we have to
 be willing to be lifelong un-learners."
 And that's, it comes back to that whole humility thing of, "I'm prepared to have what I think
 I know challenged."
 Yeah.
 But the thing is, I was thinking, Erdourg, we were talking about this, I was thinking
 In my life, I'm impressed by fruit, not theory.
  </li><li>Right. - What I mean by that
 is everyone and their mother has a theory,
 a pitch, an idea of why they're right.
 But if it's not born out in fruitfulness,
 I'm not really gonna be interested
 in being persuaded or changed.
 Does that make sense? - Yes.
  </li><li>So I see a lot of people who want to be taken seriously,
 but they're really, really angry.
 And I'm like, hang on,
 You're not displaying the fruit of the thing that you're trying to convince me I need to know.
 Right.
 You were talking earlier about how you almost missed revival.
 I really did.
 I, because I thought I understood, which is funny when I think about it now.
 I mean, I was all of like, you know, 22 years old or something.
 Um, but I really thought that I understood the kinds of things that the Holy Spirit did.
 And so when the Holy Spirit showed up in a completely new way,
 I was desperately sad because I was like, I'm going to have to leave this church.
 Well, why is that?
 Help me understand that.
 Well, I really felt strongly that this couldn't possibly be the kind of thing that God would do.
 But what was happening in the church?
 Yes.
 Was not God.
 Yes, because I really thought that things would always be sort of decently in an order.
 And it was pretty far from that.
 I mean, people were laughing all the time and there's people crying right next to the people that were laughing.
 And it just, it felt like chaos to me.
 And because I had significant control issues, it wasn't a situation where I felt
 like either I was in control or that anybody was in control.
 And so I was like, this, this doesn't feel safe to me.
 And because it didn't feel safe, it felt like that's not something God would do.
 Sure.
 Cause God's safe.
 He's in the box.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 Keep him neatly in your box.
 So you nearly missed him.
 I nearly missed him.
 I need to find a new church.
 Yeah, because my heart wasn't open to learning something new about God.
 I just really felt like I had a full understanding, which is quite funny when you
 think about how huge God is that as a 22 year old or even as an 82 year old,
 we would think we have a full understanding of everything that God will do.
 Um, but I really thought that.
 And so I was like, Oh, I'm so sad.
 I really loved this church.
 And now, you know, now I have to leave because this isn't what God would do.
 So, you know, I'd love to say that God just, you know, quietly spoke to me as I was sitting
 in a chair and I was like, okay, God, I agree with you.
 But actually God pretty much pinned me to the floor for three hours until I, you know,
 not quite said uncle, but I was like, Lord, you know, I need help here.
 And he said, you know, here's the thing.
 Notice how you're stuck to the floor.
 I'm like, yes, he's like, have you stuck yourself to the floor?
 I was like, no, it's like, all right,
 do you think it could be me?
 You know?
 And you know, the conversation was a little shorter than that,
 but yeah, I mean, I remember just lying there and going,
 oh, well, if this is you, then my whole paradigm has to change.
 You know, I have to be open to something that scares me.
 But actually God was so beautiful through the whole thing
 of just allowing my heart to grow and learn so many new things about him.
 Isn't it true that in the midst of that, Carolina walked up to you and pointed
 at you and said, you need to decide who's God, you or him.
 Yeah.
 You she said, you need to decide who's going to be in control.
 Oh, yeah.
 Or God.
 And I was like, and that was right when I was literally right in the middle of
 this conversation with the Lord, like, God, I just need to know if this is you.
 And he's like, have you stuck yourself to the floor?
 Like, no, but I just need to know if this is you.
 So, yeah, it's interesting.
 I mean, I don't think God expects us to just run into everything without question.
 I just think, I don't know, I think sometimes cynicism gets a throne in our lives, you know,
 this, sort of like we think we're being wise and whatever. And really what we're being is
 cynical. And I don't think that cynicism leads us to good things in the Lord necessarily.
 I was just thinking about what you were saying about how the Lord got you to change your mind.
 And you know, that's learning in one sense. Learning is acquiring new facts and then changing your
 opinion, changing your mind. Yes. And I was thinking that one of the tragedies about human nature is
 that often we don't change until we have to. So we don't start exercising until we've
 had a heart attack. We don't go and get marriage counseling until our spouse said, "That's
 it. I want to divorce." We are slow to change until the pain is sufficient to bring about
 that change. How much wiser would we be if we were open to learn/open to change way
 before the pain point. Right. I was thinking earlier, I was talking to the Lord. I'm not
 sure if this fits in here, but I was talking to the Lord last night. And I was saying,
 Lord, in this current season of my life, I'm not the man I want to be. And the Lord was like,
 well, what kind of man would you like to be? And these are, you know, trivial things. But I was
 like, Lord, I'd like to be a man who reads like my current schedule at the moment. I've bought a
 bunch of books I desperately want to read. I haven't got to them. And I'm like, I would like to be a
 a man who reads. And the Lord is like, Oh, and then out, you know, there's a bunch of
 things like, well, what else? I was like, Lord, I would like to be a man of power. You know,
 I, I would like to see the power that you've promised. And I was like, Oh, well, what, you
 know, what are you going to do about that? And I just thought, Oh, I can actually make
 changes to my schedule to learn the things I want. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not hostage
 to my schedule. I've, I'm blessed with great flexibility. I can get up at any time in the
 morning I would like to add more hours to my day.
 I can choose to exercise whenever I would like.
 I can choose to read.
 You know, I've got these things, but that's an example where I'm like, actually, Lord,
 I would like to do things differently.
 Would you teach me how to do that?
 And you know, the Lord's a great teacher.
 He loves teaching people.
 I think the Holy Spirit is drawn to the request of Holy Spirit.
 Could you help me with this?
 I think he's like, yeah, what do you want to do?
 Yeah, I'd love to.
 Yeah.
 faster and more efficient than YouTube.
 So I think to sort of finish the thought of learning, do I think the advantage for any
 of us in being a learner is there's always somebody who's watching you and following
 you and the more that I can learn, the higher my ceiling goes that becomes my children's
 floor. You know what I mean? So if for some reason you won't learn or I won't learn for myself,
 learn for those that are going to follow you. You know, be open to change into growing because
 others are going to grow as a result of your growth. That's true. Right? So especially as a
 leader, but just, you know, as a parent, as a person, you know, in community with other people,
 the more that you can learn, the more that you can work on your stuff and stay open to the Lord and all that kind of stuff.
 You set the bar higher for your experience,
 both in the world, basically, and with the Lord.
 I also think it's enormously important to make your learning visible.
 To make your learning process visible, that is.
 I started getting our kids to do chores around the house.
 You know, they're an age now where they can.
 So Abigail empties the dishwasher and he is filling the dishwasher,
 but I'm having so much fun because I'm doing it with them and I'm realizing
 they're learning as I'm doing, like even this morning, the kids were in worship
 with us and, you know, Emchies four, he, he's not enjoying this process at all.
 Like he's just like, when is this over?
 But I held him and I, you know, I was holding them in the cuddle and I had his
 hands and I just started drumming on my legs with his hands.
 Well, and I wasn't thinking, I'm not going to teach you how to drum in time to the music.
 I was just, you know, trying to interact with them.
 Well, I took my hands off him and then I realized in the next song, he was drumming
 with his own hands without me doing it.
 And I was like, well, this is amazing.
 But I remember being in school and we were learning about teaching.
 I did a postgraduate degree in teaching.
 And we realized that the most effective way to learn the most effective way to recall
 is to teach other people. And so if in your process of learning, you can find some way
 to tell other people how you've learned or what you've learned, you will not only a remember it
 more, but you'll also pass on that knowledge to other people, which is why I love podcasts.
 I love blogs. I love YouTube. I just love watching people teach what they know,
 because we all benefit from it. Yeah.
 AJ Jones, thank you for showing that. That was a great thought. Tell the people what they need to
 Okay. Well, for today's show notes, you can get those at <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/158. If you have
 a question that you'd like us to ask on air, you can go ahead over to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask
 and put your question in there. Also, if you would be so kind as to leave us a review on
 iTunes, what that does is it helps people know that our podcast is there and hopefully
 will be life to them. So again, thank you so much for listening. We love you guys and
 we're really happy to be back at podcasting.
 Yeah, the ages point of leaving a review. It greatly helps. We met a great couple this
 morning at Grace and I, Gareth and Sharon. They're both from the UK. He's from Northern
 Ireland. She's from England. They live in Texas. They were in Nashville for their wedding
 anniversary. And so, you know, they came up and said hello. And we got talking. I said,
 how did you end up in Texas? So they told us that story. I said, how do you hear about
 grace? And they were like, from your podcast, I was like, how did you hear about our podcast?
 And I said, well, we're going on a road trip. And we asked our friends, what podcast should we
 listen to while we're on this 10 hour road trip? And they haven't mentioned our podcast. So
 really word of mouth is the fastest way that podcasts grow. So you leaving reviews, you telling
 friends, you encouraging other people to listen, it helps the podcast grow. And we appreciate your
 your help. Well, thanks for tuning in. We're glad to be back. We hope that you're having
 an incredible summer and we'll be back this time next week.
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin to Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
