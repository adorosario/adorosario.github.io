<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one 78 of keeping up with the Jones is the first episode of the new year.
 A j Jones you're looking resplendent in your blanket covering your shoulders.
 It's so cold and Nashville right now.<br/>
 That's a Canadian saying that.<br/>
 Yeah, I mean, we weren't here when it was super cold, but like it was minus 11 or minus 14 or something last week.
 Are you saying that in centigrade or Fahrenheit?
 Centigrade.<br/>
 Do you think in warm temperatures and Fahrenheit and cold temperatures and centigrade?
 Yes.<br/>
 So do I.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It took me a while to learn what the equivalent Fahrenheit to centigrade was, and then I just
 started thinking Fahrenheit for heat.<br/>
 I haven't worded out the other way.<br/>
 No, I haven't either.<br/>
 There's no obvious formula to me.<br/>
 Hmm. Do you realize we have not been online for almost four weeks, three weeks, almost four weeks?
 Well, yeah, me, me four weeks because I was sick. That's what you bailed on us.
 I bailed. I was just, you know, being a chicken, you know, being a wimp. No, I was probably the
 sickest I think I've ever been in terms of just staying in bed. Yeah. If you have 102.5.
 Good job. You have a cute understudy. I did have a cute understudy. I love listening to that
 podcast.<br/>
 Yeah. For those of you who don't know what we're talking about, the last podcast, 2017,
 AJ and I were supposed to be doing a year in a review. AJ got sick. So MJ, our five-year-old,
 came on and helped host the podcast. And then I kind of did a cheap podcast. I copied
 and pasted in a sermon I'd preached on on dreams. So apologies for that. But he was very,
 very cute and very excited to be on the podcast.
 Oh, he's so adorable. The child is just ridiculous.
 So yet last podcast was three or four weeks ago.
 Can't believe it.<br/>
 So catch us up on what's happened since then.
 Well, we've had Christmas.<br/>
 We did have Christmas.<br/>
 Talk about the meat extravaganza we had on Christmas Day.
 In lieu of turkey, we had...<br/>
 In lieu of turkey?<br/>
 Well, I'm not a turkey fan necessarily, and I really like chicken.
 So we had two Weber Barbecue Chickens, like whole chickens done on the barbecue.
 Right.<br/>
 had lamb ribs with tons of lamb chops. Yeah, lamb chops, lamb, lollipops.
 Yeah, those things. Basically, I guess ribs cut up and then kids love them.
 I'm not surprised. They're delicious. They're absolutely delicious. And on top of
 that, we also had on top of that, do we have more meat? I thought we did.
 Really? What did you think we had? Oh, you know what it was? We had salmon.
 We had a fresh salmon. Yes, I made a salmon dip. I've, I've sort of internally in
 my head ripped off the jail examiners salmon dip and recreated it at home and
 done an amazing job. Thank you.<br/>
 So it Christmas day with the kids and some friends came over. That was absolutely
 wonderful. I thoroughly enjoyed that. I was just, I was thinking about the
 presents we got each other and I was thinking the present I've got you, you
 have not even unwrapped or played with.
 That's because of the present I got you.
 Which will come to the second, but what did you get for Christmas?
 I got the Gordon Ramsay masterclass for cooking.
 So it's 20 classes.<br/>
 I'm super excited about it.<br/>
 But I mean, I bought it and then we left
 and I wasn't at a kitchen that I had access to.
</p><ul>
  <li>I'm part of the only like,
 I completely forgot that we got you that.
 Masterclass.com is a great idea.
 It has all these world class teachers
 teaching whatever you're interested in.
 So if you wanna learn directing Ron Howard's teaching a class,
 if you wanna learn screenwriting,
 Aaron Sorkin's teaching a class,
 if you wanna learn cooking,
 Gordon Ramsey's teaching class.
 So I thought I'd get a do that, given you love cooking.
  </li><li>Cheel.
  </li><li>What did you get me for Christmas?
  </li><li>I got you a pro controller for the Nintendo game.
 And I got you Zelda.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Before we get to Zelda,
 which is gonna occupy a large portion of this podcast.
  </li><li>Probably.
  </li><li>But we will talk about declarations for money at the end.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Just to help us view who are, stay with us.
 I'm like, I don't want to.
 I didn't want to either.
 I understand.
 Day with us.
 Age is going to be a gateway drug dealer.
 OK.
 Yeah.
 So anyway, Christmas, yes, lots of Nintendo kids extremely excited.
 Then day after, which we call Boxing Day to Canadians call it Boxing Day.
 Yes.
 Americans don't have a clue what I mean when I see.
 I think the Commonwealth countries all call it Boxing Day.
 Right.
 Boxing Day, for those of you who don't notice the 26th of December, it's the day after
 we headed over to.
 Did we head up a Charlotte North of here?
 No, over is good.
 It's over.
 We headed over to Charlotte, North Carolina, where my sister and her husband and
 their kids live are our closest family in America.
 We went over to spend a couple of days with them.
 And my other sister, Claire, my youngest sister and her husband, Stuart, they
 had flown over to celebrate Christmas with the cousins in North Carolina.
 And then they were off to Florida, to Disney World.
 So I got to see almost all my family.
 My eldest sister, Allison, and her husband and their six children.
 Yes, six, six, seven, six.
 OK, six.
 They were in England, so we got a FaceTime then.
 But went over to Charlotte had a great time there.
 Yeah, it was a great visit.
 Our kids love their kids.
 Yes, and they get along great.
 So amazing.
 And then we left Charlotte and headed to Florida, sunny Florida.
 Well, it was sunny for a day anyway.
 Yeah, I think America has been hit by this, like cold.
 snap. Right. Yeah. Is that what we call it? Meteorologist term is snap. My mother calls it a Siberian wind or
 something like that. No, that's not right. I can't remember what she called it. It's been freezing in
 America. It's been so cold. So we get to Florida. We had a week down in Florida in an area that we
 absolutely love. It's called 30A. It's a stretch of beaches, south Walton beaches. And we had a beach
  </li><li>There's a chef there and we go out one day.
 We went cycling with the kids.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Do we want to talk about that trauma?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, there were parts of it
 that were fantastic.
 So we--
  </li><li>The bike ride you're talking about.
  </li><li>Yes, yeah, but like we got these little trailer things,
 not trailers, but they look like a bike attached
 to the back of your bike.
  </li><li>It turns your bike into a tandem bike.
  </li><li>Right.
 So Tia and MJ, both of them,
 they don't actually ride bikes on their own yet.
  </li><li>They don't like it, they get freaked out.
  </li><li>They get totally freaked out.
 And they loved it.
 Like they love the tandem bikes.
 MJ, I felt like I had my own portable jukebox
 on the back of my bike.
 He said hi to everybody we went by.
 He told them we were going to the beach.
 He told them his name.
 He told them we were from Nashville.
 He told them all kinds of things.
 And then he sang me songs.
  </li><li>Wow.
 Altius Shouted was on your left as we passed people.
 (laughing)
 I tried to get her to kick other people off,
 but she wouldn't do it.
 She's too well raised.
  </li><li>Oh, well that's good.
 But yeah, so they loved it and they wanted to go back out,
 but the weather didn't,
 you only had biking that one day
 and then it got real cold real fast.
  </li><li>And then Abigail rode her bike.
  </li><li>Yes, which was so much traumatic.
  </li><li>Well, only because she hadn't ridden her bike in a while.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we were cycling near traffic.
  </li><li>Yeah, so she freaked out and then we freaked out.
  </li><li>I freaked out.
 I was like, I don't want to say goodbye to my daughter.
  </li><li>I need you to pay attention.
 stop swerving so much.
 Which meant the rest of the time, because it was so cold,
 just as a family, the five of us stayed indoors.
 We sort of hunkered down in our PJs, didn't we?
 We literally did.
 Yeah.
 Jamas and every once in a while, I would go out to forage at the grocery store and come back.
 You went hunter gathering at Whole Foods.
 Yeah.
 And then it brings us to our main topic.
 I can't believe the main topic for this week is what it is.
 It is a shocking main topic.
 This for me is as monumental as I assume me going camping is for you.
 Probably.
 So I know there's a bunch of listeners who've never heard of Zelda
 and they've never heard of the Nintendo Switch.
 I'm going to ask you in a second to tell them about both of those things.
 There's also a bunch of our listeners who I know are really into the switch
 and in particular Zelda because I've been texting with you and freaking out about this game.
 But there are also some people who might be like, I have got absolutely no
 interest in hearing about Zelda.
 And before this week, you would have been one of them, correct?
 Oh, yeah, totally.
 I was not interested at all.
 So I'm excited to share your salvation story with these people.
 In fact, I would say I was anti Zelda, not just disinterested.
 Right.
 So I'm naturally very excited about this because you're stepping into one of my
 love languages.
 And I'm a little freaked out about how much you've got into Zelda, but we're
 you're getting ahead of ourselves.
 First things first, what is a Nintendo Switch?
 So the Nintendo Switch is a game console that's made by Nintendo and it's both portable
 and you can host it on your TV.
 Right.
 So it comes with a dock.
 Yes.
 And if you want to play on the TV, you slide the switch into the dock and everything comes
 up on your big TV screen and you can use a controller.
 If you want to take it with you, say, on a nine-hour drive to Orlando, you take it out
 of the dock and it's just a handheld device about the size of an iPad mini with controllers
 built in.
 Yeah.
 So completely portable or play upon a big screen.
 Right.
 And it and I mean it's what we've been playing Mario Kart on.
 Right.
 So the switch itself is the game station so to speak.
 Yeah, has a bunch of different games.
 And then you can get a bunch of different games for it.
 Previously we've been playing Mario Kart.
 I've been playing Super Mario Odyssey.
 I've now completed it 100% finish to promote odyssey.
 So you're shaking your head, you're rolling your eyes.
 I didn't roll my eyes. I shook my head.
 There was no. No, there was no.
 I was. No, there was definitely that.
 But there wasn't any eye rolling.
 I just want to be clear.
 So, yeah, you can play multiple different games on it.
 OK, next thing then, what is Zelda?
 Zelda is the game that my sister tortured me with as a teenager.
 So years and years ago when you were in high school, we think that she probably had a super Nintendo,
 which is a very old game console.
 Not that I'm trying to date you.
 Yes, it was great if that helps.
 OK, yeah, it was super Nintendo.
 So she was playing Zelda with just explain what Zelda is before we go into detail about this version of Zelda.
 Well, Zelda is a game where a little guy named Link
 goes all over this land and tries to pick up different things and whatever so that he can go and free the princess.
 who's named Zelda. Right. So it's a just like Mario as a character who's appeared in a string
 of games. Yes. Zelda is a franchise that Nintendo has released many, many, many, many games in the
 past. Now, different versions with each console kind of thing. Correct. And I feel disclosure,
 I've never played a Zelda game. I briefly played, and by briefly, I mean, maybe for 15 minutes,
 one of the Zelda games for the M64 got bored really quickly and didn't understand the point.
 But back to your story, your elder sister used to play Zelda when you were in high school.
 And what was your experience with it then?
 Well, the TV was right outside of my door.
 Your bedroom door?
 Yeah, in the condo that we lived in.
 And it wasn't even like a bedroom door, it was a sliding glass door.
 And so not only the light from the TV, but the sound from the TV,
 It was basically on top of my head.
 And at the time, she didn't sleep very much,
 and she just played the game all the time.
 So she'd play until like three or four in the morning,
 and I would ask her to turn it down,
 and she would be like, "No, I need to be able to hear it.
 I need to be able to hear it."
 And so I just didn't sleep very well, and I hated the game.
 Like, I contemplated destruction of the game so many times.
 I just was like, "I hate this game."
 So I remember even when we got the switch, you mentioned that Zelda existed for it.
 And I was like, yeah, we're not getting that.
 Which was fine, because again, I had no attachment to Zelda.
 As I'd never played a game, I wasn't really interested in it.
 I had no historical significance to me that Mario games have.
 I got my first one when a bunch of my friends saved up and surprised me one for my 21st birthday.
 I got an N64 and that was life-changing.
 but really i haven't played a lot of games but the only games i have played are the mario one so this mario franchise had a huge place in my heart.
 The reason we got zelda was it one game of the year everybody was raving about it and i was like me is probably people like zelda who are raving about it but.
 pretty much universally it won all the awards last year.
 I spoke to some friends of mine who are playing and they're like, yeah, you might like it might be a little bit too slow pace for you might not keep your interest.
 And so we thought what the heck will we buy it.
 Yeah, I mean the kids really wanted to buy it didn't they they were like, oh, this will be fun.
 Right.
 So yeah, sort of against not against my better judgment. I was happy to get you a video game and I trust you.
 you know with with playing it like in terms of.
 You're not leaving you a nintendo widow that's right yeah so i was like okay well we'll get it you know never thinking that.
 I would ever play and i didn't play for a couple days i got another game called splatoon of playing that right and on the drive down of florida are nine hour drive.
 We've you know we had the car charger for the switch i thought what the heck i'll start playing right and then we'll have an.
 Well so you will you play it on the way down i didn't really pay attention to that i was just listening to my book my audio book and then once i got cold in florida,
 course it's up on the screen and the kids are totally into it so everybody's cuddled on the couch watching you play this game and i start watching the game and then i start getting really interested in how does that work and how does this work and.
 i think it's all part of some sort of tricky plan he just lured me in.
 I was surprised as anybody that for those of you've never seen the game will describe the game i love hearing you talk about it is describe the game so it's a game where this.
 guy named link who is a warrior who's forgotten everything because of a hundred years ago something happened blah blah blah blah.
 So he's a warrior who is trying to defeat all of these baddies in the land and he has to eventually freeze out there and restore goodness to land.
 But in the minutia of the game is basically running around, picking up mushrooms and apples
 and shooting foxes and that kind of stuff, fighting off bad guys, going and finding wild
 horses and mounting them and then bringing them in and boarding them in stables and making
 food from weird things like monster parts and all this kind of stuff.
 And probably the thing that is most fun about it is my game doesn't look the same as your
 game, look the same as MJ's game, because it depends on who you as a person, where you
 want to go, what do you want to explore, it's totally open.
 And so there's parts of the land that I've seen that you haven't seen, there's parts
 you've seen that I haven't seen, you're much further ahead of course in the game than I
 am.
 But there's it rewards curiosity and it's just fun.
 It's you can climb up mountains, you can parasail off of things, you can, you know, it's just super fun.
 It's absolutely enormous.
 It's huge.
 Yeah.
 It's a colossal game.
 So you have this virtual character that you can run around, some of the most beautiful landscapes.
 And I think the reason you like it is, there's really not a lot of punishment for doing things, quote, unquote, wrong.
 like it's a very unstructured game and it kind of nudges you gently in the areas where there are some structure to it like where there's some precursors to doing something else.
 It guide you there but for like 90% of it.
 It's wide open for you to do whatever you want you could spend an hour as I have just climbing a mountain to see what it takes you yeah and then looking around in the graphics of it are amazing.
 So it's quite fun so here I am in Florida.
 Realizing i'm having to fight you for the game because you are so it was a couple nights that i went to bed before you because you were staying up like well the first day i didn't play at all i just watched all of you play it and i watched abby play it and then t a play it and then mj play it.
 And everybody was so having so much fun and so excited and they're all excited about different parts of it.
 And then whenever it would get like really like there's a lot of baddies or whatever,
 of course everybody hands a remote to daddy and daddy fixes the situation and kills the
 bad guy.
 So it was just very sweet, but no matter who is playing they'd all be sitting there watching.
 It's like an interactive movie because you get to direct what happens next and they you
 will hit puzzles where you can't figure out and I love watching the kids use all the problem
 solving skills.
 Yeah, that's the thing actually the puzzle thing.
 There's these shrines you're going to you're going throughout the land finding these shrines and when you go in them
 Some of them are like you just have to beat up a bad guy
 but a lot of them are
 Problem-solving things so you have to figure out
 You know here
 There's electricity in this half of the room and you've got to get it to work in this half of the room
 And what have you got on you to conduct it and all that kind of stuff and so there's lots of
 Like sort of problem-solving type things just so fun to watch the kids do
 'cause they're like, everybody gets into it.
 We're like, okay, try this, okay, no, that's not it.
 Okay, try that, you know, and we all sort of work together
 to fix it, so it's really fun.
  </li><li>Do you wanna talk about how much money
 we spent on Amoebos in the last seven days?
  </li><li>In the last seven days?
 Well, Tia spent a bunch of her Christmas money
 on Amoebos. - Which is hysterical
 to watch. - Yeah, she spent like 40 bucks
 on Amoebos, and MJ spent 20 bucks,
 and I spent $34.
  </li><li>Okay, you actually answered that quite left.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>A lot.
 We spent a lot of money on amoebas, about a hundred bucks.
  </li><li>And explain to everybody what an amoebo is.
  </li><li>An amoebo is like this little statue
 that you can buy it like Best Buy or whatever,
 that I don't really know what they are babe.
 They're like little figurines
 and when you hover them over the game console,
 it gives you free stuff.
 So I get super excited 'cause it gives you free meat
 and free fish and whatever, and it all falls from the sky
 and then you just run around and pick it up,
 which is super fun.
 Just because you need all those things to cook things
 and part of my favorite part of the game is
 that you cook all these weird meals
 with random fish and mushrooms and things.
  </li><li>I'm loving it.
 I'm loving listening to you.
 I haven't let you talk about this to anybody.
 I'm like, I want it fresh for the podcast.
 I want everybody here that I have not made this up.
 How into this game you are.
 I'm totally into it.
 I love.
 I also love catching the horses.
 I don't really care about fighting the bad guys.
 I'm not even sure I care about my quests.
 I just like catching horses, bringing them to this table and then breaking them in.
 And I like cooking food and finding shrines and doing puzzles.
 But you also like you like all the puzzles.
 Like this puzzle.
 I couldn't have solved without your help.
 Thank you.
 No, it's true.
 And then there's the four divine beasts aren't there.
 There's these four beasts that you have to turn from the dark side as it were back to
 the good side before you can kill the main baddie.
 And they are huge puzzles.
 Like once you've actually stopped it.
 I don't want to do any spoilers in case people are into this and haven't played it yet.
 Okay.
 Once you've stopped it from moving, then you have to figure out each, you know, each animal,
 They're like ones a bird and ones an elephant and ones a camel and the other was sorry guys. That's just nonstop spoilers
 You can't look that stuff up
 Like one of them dies forget that they just random animals
 But then you have to figure out how to manipulate the animals and stuff to make everything work, right?
 so
 It's it's quite fun, isn't it?
 Oh, it's the two of us have sat there at night like when the kids are good at bed and we figure out
 the puzzle of
 taking over the animal and
 Turning it back to the good side, which is quite fun
 I also sneakily quite like it because when I play it you're exceptionally complimentary to me
 You're really good. See I I still I'm not a gamer
 So I don't know how to use the controls and so when you're like the first two days
 I did have to just bite my leg.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>I was like, "ZL."
 I'm like, "What is ZL?"
 Then you'd be like, "L, hit the R button."
 I'm like, "What's the R?"
 And I'm looking for a letter on the button.
 He's like, "No, it's on the front."
 You know, so I--
  </li><li>It was like an octopus having an epileptic fit.
  </li><li>Oh, it's just really rough.
  </li><li>It's just limbs flailing everywhere.
  </li><li>Well, I'm slightly better now.
  </li><li>You're my-- oh, please.
 But here's the thing you got on the side.
 You are not a gamer.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>And there's a certain,
 I mean, there's all this new muscle memory.
 Like it took me a good couple of days to remember
 what button does what and where,
 and I still haven't got it all mapped down.
 But once your muscle memory kicks in,
 it just becomes all normal.
 But anyway, I love that you've stepped into
 what was previously an exclusive part of my world
 that you wanted nothing to do with.
 You kind of merely tolerated from a distance.
 And now you're in it, you love it,
 you're engaged with it, our kids are talking about it
 the whole time, I'm like, Lord Jesus, what has happened?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>This morning, you left for church.
 And I was like, well, I don't think I'm going to get to play today, which I haven't played yet today.
 Listen to you.
 You're jonesing for a play.
 I'm like, you'll be editing the podcast.
 I'll be playing Zelda.
 Um, yeah.
 So, but I thought I probably won't get to play today.
 Uh, I'm going to go scan in all the amoebos so I don't lose today's worth of stash.
 My God, because you get to scan them once a day.
 And I thought, I don't want to lose all the fish and the herbs and the mushrooms and
 all the stuff that you get.
 And I need some weapons.
 I don't have any good weapons.
 So I'm hoping that the amiibo thing
 will give me some weapons 'cause I need 'em.
  </li><li>I was thinking, and I joked about this earlier,
 but I think seriously the law of sewing
 and reaping is an action.
 I think I sowed an interest in camping,
 which is something very dear to your heart.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And I think genuinely I've then reaped a wife who likes Nintendo.
 There's a marriage lesson in there somewhere.
  </li><li>Right there, right there.
 Yeah, so anyway, I'm loving the game.
 I'm dreaming about it every night.
 Like I'm dreaming about how to fix things
 or how to self-puzzle so that I had to leave.
 Like there was a couple of shrines I had to leave
 'cause I was like, I just, I don't know.
 And now I'm feeling frustrated
 and that's not why I'm playing the game.
 So I just would leave and I'll go back.
  </li><li>What if you get this
 excited about Super Mario Odyssey. I won't. I don't like the music. I don't like the
 colors. Everything looks dumb and kiddish. He sound remarkably similar to a wife I once
 had. Who said it was Zelda? It looks dumb. It sounds dumb. You're a stupid little man.
 It sounds dumb. I was. I despised it. I despised it based on my experience from 30 years ago.
 So when it did look dumb and sound dumb, there's an awful lot of crossover between the two
 of the world.
 Well, in 30 years, I might like Mario Odyssey.
 Okay.
 Baby steps.
 I'll reward you for where you've gone so far.
 Thank you, darling.
 It's a new year.
 It's a new year.
 Can we talk about the awesomeness of our service this morning?
 It was a great service.
 Yeah.
 You and Jeff, without talking about it, were scarily on the same page.
 Yeah.
 heard from the Lord and had a message. And then you heard from the Lord and had a prophetic
 word. And they were like word for word.
 The same thing. Yeah.
 Yeah, briefly talk about that. Because I think that's, I think it's a great star to
 the year.
 Yeah. I during worship, I had a picture of the ground shaking and like stuff coming up
 from the ground and then Jeff with this massive, you know, Zelda type hammer,
 sledgehammer thing. Yeah, I knew it was like swinging it back behind him and over his head and then
 slamming it down the ground and and it just breaking free. You know, whatever was happening and I was
 like, Lord, what is that? And it felt kind of like in my head, it felt kind of funky, you know what
 I mean? Like in the room, I was like, huh, there's definitely something going on here. And and the
 The Lord basically gave me this word about how people are trying to reign in hope that
 they're afraid to hope in 2018 because they're afraid of being disappointed.
 But actually hope is the thing that opens the doors.
 I saw this picture of these two double doors and he said it's a hope-shaped key.
 So I wrote all this stuff down and then there was this stuff about standing in promise.
 Jeff's message was about hope.
 about standing and about standing and about pursuing promise. And he talked about two double
 doors and all this stuff. So it was like, I mean, as he's talking, I'm like, whoa, you
 know, because I had gotten the word. And at the end of worship, leaned over and just said,
 Hey, what are you speaking on today? Because I just had this picture. And he said, Oh,
 I'm speaking on hope. And so I just passed on my phone because I had written the whole
 thing out and he just looked at me and he's like, "Uh, uh, I probably could just share
 that."
 I was like, "Okay."
 You know, whatever.
 So, you know, I shared it at the end, but it was just really fun.
 Because you didn't know what he was going to be sharing?
 No idea.
 You were too busy scanning into me because it was the one to watch the first service.
 That's right.
 No, actually it was too busy trying to brush Tia's hair.
 It took 25 minutes for me to brush her hair this morning.
 It was so knotted.
 I nearly shaved her head.
 I was like, "And who wants to be bald?"
 I can't leave my kids alone apparently.
 So yeah, dear listener, what are you needing hope for this year for 2018?
 Yeah.
 I think it's going to be a great year to set up some declarations about where you
 want to go and then attach your hope to it and attach your faith and excitement.
 One of the fun things we got to do with our kids and as a family was sit down and
 say, what do we want our family to be known for in 2018 and forward?
 And then the kid just chipped in like what do we want our family legacy to be?
 Yeah.
 And just giving the Lord something to aim at, giving us something to aim at.
 So I'm excited.
 I thought it was amazing.
 I'll put link in the show notes to this morning's message so you can go be encouraged
 by Jeff sharing that.
 And hopefully that will super encourage you.
 I keep thinking about, you know, several weeks ago, Jesse earlier, I think it was
 on one of the platforms like on on Twitter or Instagram or something.
 coined the phrase 20 great teen as opposed to 2018. And it really hit my heart. Like I was like,
 Oh, yeah, 20 great teen. Like it's, I think it's a year where I want to have, I want to dare to
 have expectations that I haven't ever dared before. Like, because I actually think that God's calling
 us way higher. And we so limit because we're afraid, or you know, whether it's fear of disappointment,
 or whether we just don't realize how big he is. You know what I mean? So I'm, every time I think
 about it, I'm like, yeah, 20 great team. Like this is, this is a year that we remember forever.
 I'm excited. Yeah, me too. I have a listening question for you.
 Okay. It's from Hillary. Hi, Hillary.
 And she says, hello, Alan and AJ. Happy new year. I've been following Grace and her online via
 YouTube. And notice the declarations you guys do during tides and offerings. Can you explain more
 about where this declaration comes from biblically and how it ties to you guys' time of giving
 ties and offerings. I'd love to understand more. Thank you, Hillary.
 Well, where it comes from in terms of how it ties into how we do ties and offerings,
 there's a bunch of different things. One is, if you've ever done Dave Ramsey's
 Financial Peace University, I always think about one of the things he says is you want to tell
 your money where to go then instead of wondering where it went.
 And so your words have power and so speaking to anything is really, really important.
 And so what we do is we as a church, we say those declarations when we give our money
 because you're reminding your heart and your spirit what you're doing and you're telling
 your money what it's to do for you.
 So it's about your words having power and the power of declaration and that kind of stuff.
 Do you want to answer the first part of that question?
 the Bible side. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think about Romans 12, where it talks about we're transformed
 by the renewing of our mind. Without ever making a declaration, we already have thoughts regarding
 money, and most of them are negative. So your declarations is a way of telling you to think
 something different. So Job 22, verse 28 says, "You will decree a thing, and it will be established
 for you. So we make these decrees like as we receive today's offerings, we're
 believing the Lord for jobs and better jobs, raises and bonuses, benefits, sales, tips
 and commissions, favorable settlement, states and inheritances, interest and income,
 rebates and returns, checks and mail, gifts and surprises, finding money, debts paid off,
 expenses, decrease, blessing and increase. And so we make that like we've obviously memorized
 that from years of saying that we have a bunch of them that we cycle through.
 That's one of my favorites.
 But what that means is when I go to the mailbox, I am literally expecting
 checks in the mail. Whereas previously, it may be that you go to the mailbox
 and there's some fear or interpretation you're like, uh, is there going to be like
 an unpaid bill that I've forgotten about or is there going to be somebody like,
 you know, requesting money that I've forgotten about?
 You know, when it comes to tax time, when you're thinking, Oh, I'm probably going to
 or are you thinking there's going to be rebates?
 And just as a community and as a culture making these declarations has had a tremendous impact
 on our community that we all have testimonies that literally go down that list where people
 have seen all these things happen in their life.
 It's kind of to hardwire your heart into expectation and faith and hope rather than
 dread when it comes to finances.
 Proverbs 18 21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue.
 So we choose what to speak. I mean, if you think about it, people make declarations all the time.
 Oh, I'm so broke. Man, I just don't have enough money.
 Oh, I, you know, I'd love to come out, but I can't afford that.
 So those are declarations, whether you realize them or not, we're just intentionally making positive biblical affirmations.
 and the declarations that we have are all in line with biblical principle so not only are declarations a biblical thing but the content of our declarations are all based on biblical principles so.
 I hope that helps.
 Yeah hilly i don't know sometimes i don't know if you've watched online anytime so we've done it but sometimes we have people.
 You know wave their hands if they've seen you know two or three of the different things that we mention.
 happen and it's always amazing to me how many people are now because they've activated their faith they're seeing god do something different in their finances than they've ever seen before so it's super exciting almost on a weekly basis we have i would say actually on a weekly basis because
 every kid the school we have students can testify and in our community in our culture we've seen some amazing things like people you know cars and better cars people being given cars people get being given houses.
 jobs, promotions, upgrades, I mean, all kinds of crazy things.
 So that's where it comes from.
 That's why we do it.
 And we've seen tremendous fruit from it, which is what Proverbs 1821 says.
 I didn't finish the verse, "Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who
 love it will eat its fruit."
 So we're either eating positive fruit from our declarations or negative fruit from our
 negative declarations.
 Yeah. And I think too, like, do we get those decorations from Bethel?
 Yeah. Yeah. So I think somebody just sort of caught a hold of, "Oh, these are amazing."
 And so they post them. So we picked them up and we've just started saying them and seen a lot of
 transformation for people, not just us, but so many people.
 Well, we're trying something new. We started the tail end of last year.
 And it's really in line with why we start the podcast.
 Originally we started because there was a lot of people who wanted more connection with us,
 but there is really no easy way for us to offer that.
 So part of the reason our podcast is conversational is we start each episode,
 for example, with a weekly catch up because that's literally what you do when you sit down with friends.
 If you think about it, if you go out for lunch with a friend, you haven't seen in a while, you say,
 "Hey, what's been happening with you since the last time we saw each other?"
 Right.
 So we've tried to be conversational.
 That format seems to work as best as we can tell from not only the download stats from
 our server, but also we do a listener survey every year and the feedback that we've received
 from you guys is very positive.
 And I guess what we want to say right now, the start of the year, whether you've just
 started listening to us or whether you've been listening to us for years, is thank you
 for choosing to listen to us week in and week out.
 Yeah.
 you're choosing to spend your time listening to our voices and that's super sweet.
 It's a huge privilege to join you on your commute or talk to you while you're doing your dishes.
 Or if you're at the gym, we've even had some people say, I fall asleep to you at night.
 Well, I'm not sure that's encouraging.
 Yeah, there's a whole lot of feelings I have about that statement.
 But my cousin said she had to stop listening to us at the gym because she'd burst out laughing and people thought she was like
 somewhat off her rocker. So she's like, I don't listen to you in public anymore.
 It's partially true, though. She is a little bit off.
 A little bit, yeah.
 But we're aware from your emails, from conversations we've had with people and from
 people connecting with us over social media, that there might be some of you who'd like a
 deeper connection with us than just listening to us on a podcast.
 That's why we've created a Patreon account. If you head over to patreon.com/elananaj,
 you can find out about an opportunity to connect with us in a more meaningful way than just listening to us on the podcast.
 Over there were trying to create an online community where we can connect with our listeners more,
 let you in on some of the new developments we have going on,
 offer things like discounts on our products and create a place where we can answer your questions that might not lend themselves well to a public podcast head over to patreon.com/allon and a.j.
 that's P A T R E O N dot com slash A L Y N A N D A J to learn more that's Patreon.com/allen
 and AJ. If you want the show notes for this episode, you can get them at allen and AJ.com/178.
 And I will have a link to everything we talked about this week. Until next week, we pray
 you have an incredible week. May you beat many guardians. May you solve all your puzzles.
 May you be the divine beasts and may you upgrade your armor and armor.
