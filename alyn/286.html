<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to a very special episode of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 That is less an episode and more a public health announcement.
 And kind of an update.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I'm sorry, Ade, what did you say?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So, AJ has lost her voice.<br/>
 Sure have.<br/>
 That's gonna be an interesting weekly update. I don't know how this audio is gonna work.
 Your SNFs are louder than your whispers.
 Sorry.<br/>
 Can you try talking and greeting the people?
 Hello people!<br/>
 We should have done this on videos so people know you're actually here and it's not just me with the sock puppet.
 Yeah, my voice is totally gone.<br/>
 Your voice is totally gone.<br/>
 AJ Jones, shall we do a weekly update?
 Sure.<br/>
 Why don't you do the talking and I'll do the intercession.
 Okay.<br/>
 This is going to be such a weird episode.
 All right.<br/>
 Week to update our girls were away on a youth camp in Florida this week.
 Hard to believe again.<br/>
 I know we say this every week, but hard to believe that was this week.
 They were away.<br/>
 You've been sick that much is obvious.
 Yes.<br/>
 Do you want to talk about your sickness and about how I called it about a week ago and
 you were stubborn and refused to go to a doctor.
 today you went to see a doctor and the doctor confirmed everything I'd already told you.
 Yeah, so I definitely have a push through issue. So I do think I could push through anything.
 And uh yeah, I wasn't. Tia came home with a cold from camp. Not a cold. What you thought was a cold.
 She came home with something. Yes, but with my medical training, I diagnosed it as something
 other than the cold and everybody mocked me because technically I don't have a medical
 degree or license.<br/>
 But in my head, I'm an amazing physician.
 And every time I go to a hospital, everybody thinks I'm a doctor.
 Except for the medical people.<br/>
 Yeah, I know.<br/>
 But one time I asked my friend, I was like, "People often think I'm a doctor."
 And she was like, "Is it the nurses that think you're a doctor?"
 I'm like, "Yeah, it's not your medical knowledge that they're amazed by.
 that you're short and grumpy, which is what most doctors are. I was like, oh, yeah, that
 puts a spin on it. But we digress. You're not short. You're six foot one. I'm just kidding.
 That was brilliant. Okay. Anyway, I pushed through into the encounter weekend. And I
 know, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah. Don't blame us on the encounter weekend.
 That's not the encounter weekend's fall. I'm just saying, I probably haven't felt great
 in two weeks. And what did you decide to do this week before you did the encounter weekend?
 I went to see Riverdance.<br/>
 And we're still married.<br/>
 I mean, that is a test, many of covenant in action.
 You went to see Riverdance.<br/>
 It was amazing.<br/>
 But you weren't well.<br/>
 And I was like, I actually felt better that day than I am.
 But that's your superpower.<br/>
 Your superpower of denial and delusion
 allows you to no longer feel the physical symptoms
 that everybody else can see that's on you.
 Well, what's weird is I don't like even--
 I saw it went to the doctor today.<br/>
 I misspoke all day yesterday.<br/>
 And my voice kinda went by the end.<br/>
 At the very end I was done speaking and then my voice kinda went.
 Anyway, when I saw the doctor today, she said, "Listen, from the collar bones up, you're
 basically a pickled mess."<br/>
 She said, "You have an ear infection.<br/>
 You have a monster sinus infection."<br/>
 And she said, "It's not in your lungs, so that's good."
 Your vocal cord is stripped.<br/>
 Yes, she said that's all because of the drainage from the sinus infection.
 So she said, "Your throat is swollen and everything."
 She said, "You must be."<br/>
 She's looking at my throat.<br/>
 She goes, "You must be an enormous pain."
 I said, "Well, I'm in some pain,<br/>
 but I'm not gonna die or anything."<br/>
 She goes, "Wow, that's a metric."<br/>
 So she's gonna look at me.<br/>
 So anyway, I got a steroid shot.<br/>
 Yeah, and I'm now in antibiotics and steroids.
 And I wanna feel better real soon.
</p><ul>
  <li>Right, and you're also podcasting right now.
 But, blessed you, you have been silent all day.
 Yeah.
 Which is an interesting chapter to our marriage.
 Me, silent?
 Mm-hmm.
 I'm real loud, am I?
 You're louder than you have been today.
 Well, that's true.
 For sure.
 You've been taking advantage of the fact that I'm not supposed to be speaking.
 I really have.
 Speaking of the encounter we can't, how was the encounter we can't?
 It was amazing.
 It was so good.
 The team was great.
 It...
 I got to meet a ton of new people that are new to Grey Centre.
 That's fun.
 You all had a meal together?
 Yeah, it was really good.
 Good.
 Yeah.
 Well, other than the girls being away, you being sick, largely, this has been a week of rattling off work, like just working, working, working, working, working, working.
 Yeah, crazy working.
 Because as the title of this episode suggests, we are about to go on sabbatical.
 In fact, not about to.
 We are officially today is our first day of sabbatical.
 Yeah.
 I think that's part of, I mean, to go back to the sickness thing, I think that's part of why I didn't recover as well as because we worked all weekend.
 Take, try and get ready to be able to go.
 Right.
 Yes, because if we, if we slip beautifully from our weekly catch up into our main topic, you're right.
 Like we are having a sabbatical, but it's all happened very, very quickly.
 Like I did the math.
 It was three weeks ago that we actually asked for a sabbatical.
 And it was last week that we found out that we were getting it.
 Yeah.
 And then we had a week in which to make sure everything ready for all of our
 departments would be covered.
 Yeah, exactly.
 So, you know, the one question everybody asked when they hear that we have an eight
 week sabbatical, which by the way, like let's not go any further without a huge
 thank you to the generosity of our church board that approved our request.
 So wonderful.
 But the first thing everybody asks is, what are you going to do for eight weeks?
 And the trouble is as high shape as we really haven't had that much time to plan.
 No, like on my hard drive, there is a beautiful mind map of what I want to do.
 And what I want to do is definitely not on your back.
 Well, no, it does.
 I think I could cross.
 They could cross over.
 It does cross over.
 But my point is you haven't had time to think about it.
 I've had a little time to think about it and put some stuff into action.
 But with all the stuff getting ready and then doing encounter,
 a couple of days behind you, I think.
 Yeah, you are.
 Like I technically I finished my work week at 5 p.m. on Thursday.
 And you worked all day Friday and all day Saturday.
 Yeah.
 So I had seven or eight last night.
 Yeah.
 So we're on Spaticle.
 How's it feel being as today was really going to a doctor's office and then
 try not to talk all day.
 I'm quiet.
 So where do you want to go with this, Ajay Jones?
 Obviously, you can't talk too much.
 Yeah, you talk it all.
 Agree silently over here.
 Okay.
 You're going to agree silently.
 My marriage just got so good.
 And my voice should be back in a day or two.
 Don't get used to it.
 It's funny that we're having a sabbatical because I've actually never really given
 any thought to a sabbatical.
 I don't remember having more than two weeks off at a time.
 Since I was probably 18 when I started working full time.
 Yeah.
 Let's talk about your issues for a second, but you're right.
 Like you, you just work, work, work, work.
 Yeah.
 I've never like a, I realized I was like, Oh, I need to talk to Samuel about the
 anxiety I felt with what does one do with more than two weeks off?
 Like, right.
 And he's like, you seem to be afraid that you're not going to know how to spend that correctly.
 He was funny because he was like, well, first of all, it'd be good if you didn't view the next eight weeks in your units, your 15 minute units of time.
 I was like, thanks, yeah.
 So probably you want to take some time to think about how you want to spend the rest of your time.
 I mean, I have some ideas of what I'd like to do, like things I'd like to do with the kids.
 What would you like to do with the kids?
 Well, I want to take them on an RV trip.
 And I'm actually shot that I'm not against the idea.
 Yeah.
 Is getting an RV and driving around the United States.
 Oh, I've mapped the whole thing out.
 I've figured out kilometers.
 Kilometers.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 We go to Canada.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 I figured out miles and I figured out the main parks
 that I want to take them to.
 And I've got it all down.
 Oh, this is a difference between Angie and I.
 When she says I haven't really thought about anything,
 and I'm over here waxing lyrical
 about having a mind map.
 What she's done with really no time
 is plotted in RV trip around America.
  </li><li>Well, I wanted to know how much of a cost.
 So I wanted to figure out like mileage
 because mileage figures in the cost
 just think could we even do something like this?
  </li><li>Tell me the highlights
 of where we would be going in this fictitious.
  </li><li>I have it all written down just a moment.
 We would start with leave here.
 We go kind of through Dallas.
 Well, hang on, we don't live in Texas.
 So when you say we'd start here and then go through Dallas.
 Because we're trying.
 We're trying to drive.
 How long is it from Tennessee to--
 Born in New Mexico, my friend.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 How many hours driving is it from here to Dallas?
 Oh, 10.
 Is that all?
 Yeah.
 Wow.
 We go to White Sands National Park.
 What's in White Sands National Park?
 It's like a desert.
 It's a desert park that the sand is all white.
 and because of the wind it forms into all these structures that they're not
 they're different every day and you can
 They have slides there and you can take slides and you just slide down these mountains instead of being snow mountains their white sand mountains
 So it sounds like really fun and it's
 It's supposed to be one of the wonders of the world kind of thing
 Yeah, I don't know who came up with that list because it's not on the same list as the Taj Mahal
 Okay. Well, nobody wants to see that. We have children.
 The hanging gardens of Babylon and then the Grand Canyon. Obviously
 Arches Natural National Park, which isn't far from there, which is where those massive stone arches are.
 It's like amazing. I'll show you pictures.
 Oh, wait, wait, all I want to see is the White House.
 Can we take an RV to DC?
 Oh, you can't take an RV into DC.
 This is America. Land of the Free.
 The kids don't want to see the White House.
 Excuse me.
 Have you even pulled up?
 You can't take an RV into DC. You're literally not allowed.
 Is Mount Rushmore on your list? No, it's too far away, it's too many miles. So Dakota, there's nothing else by it.
 Okay, thanks. I'm glad we had this episode just to kind of solve this out.
 And then I found out where there's some Six Flags parks to take the kids on roller coasters.
 And I thought we might be able to finish staying at the RV park at Disney and do like a day or
 do it Disney. Are we officially becoming, remember that Robin Williams movie, RV? Are we becoming that
 family. Listen, remember that was like bonding trip. Do you remember the movie? They were
 so bonded by the end. That's right. Well, so, Ajit would apparently like to go on an RV trip
 around America. Yes. But apparently not hitting the places I would like to go see, which is... I'm
 willing to take into consideration some of your needs. Not all of them, of course, but I would say.
 I was just snoring.
 You just snorted on the podcast and just for that,
 I'm leaving that snoring.
 I was trying to keep where we were going,
 all within a little tight area because of mileage.
 You're now adding in Washington and South Dakota.
  </li><li>Well, we aren't apparently getting a gas holiday,
 a tax on gas holiday.
 President Biden can--
  </li><li>What does that mean?
 So the gas prices will come back down?
  </li><li>Yeah, we just want paid tax on gas for a month.
  </li><li>Well, praise him.
 Let it be now because that RV is going to be brutal.
 Well, apparently you haven't given some thought
 to what we're going to do on a--
 I think it's sabbatical.
 Yes.
 I would like to do that.
 And then I want to paint the kitchen.
 Oh my god.
 I need to sabbatical for my sabbatical.
 My wife's just the man she wants to paint the kitchen.
 You know how to unwind, huh?
 Well--
 Oh, baby, listen to your squeaky.
 Maybe you need to gargle some WD-40.
 I think that would help.
 Yeah, you're like squeaking like an old door.
 So we're on sabbatical.
 We asked for about three weeks ago.
 I was saying that I haven't really,
 this has not been like a long-term plan.
 It's not something I've been thinking about.
 I just remember one day,
 about three and a half weeks ago coming home
 and just saying to you,
 I have a moment of clarity.
 I think I'm gonna ask our board for a sabbatical.
 And I remember you looking a little shocked.
 Do you remember that?
 because I was like, I have so much to do.
 I can't go on a sabbatical.
  </li><li>But it makes sense for us to go on a sabbatical now
 because any other time of the year,
 it's the easiest time for us to do it
 because S.O.S.L. is not in session.
 And all the other stuff we do at the church
 can get covered by our staff far easier
 than any other time of the year.
 And our kids are at the school.
 So that's the how.
 Like I asked for one.
 The what is its eight weeks, which is amazing.
 As for the why, the last two years, any way you want to skin it has been difficult, especially
 the last year, was particularly taxing.
 And a number of things just fell into place.
 One of the other things that's happening is grey sinners going through some restructuring.
 And one of the beautiful parts about that is neither you or I are involved in that restructuring,
 which is nice.
 So we're not leading the charge on those changes, which means we can step aside.
 And when we return, we'll be able to see the fruit of those changes and just kind of slot
 in where we need to there.
 We already mentioned our kids being out of school.
 We already mentioned SSL not being in session.
 So it allows us and affords us a little bit of time to recover probably just regain energy.
 The other thing, and I've mentioned this before in the podcast, but especially 2022,
 you know those, do you do this in North America?
 You know when people get married, you tie tin cans to the back of a car and you'd write
 "just married"?
 Yeah.
 All right.
 I feel like one of those tin cans.
 Like, I've got where I need to go, but it was a bumpy ride and it wasn't me that was
 driving.
 I was just dragged along by life.
 Yeah.
 So I feel like it's shocking to me that this is the middle of June, end of June.
 Good Lord.
 Yeah.
 It's shocking to me.
 It's halfway through 2022 and I feel like I've just been dragged here.
 So I'm looking forward to just getting a fresh perspective.
 One of the things that happens when you are in leadership crisis is you tend to very easily
 focus on what's before you and there's a tendency that you can lose sight of a larger
 scope.
 So I'm looking forward to being able to lift my eyes a little bit and get some perspective
 and see the horizon for what feels like a long time.
 Yeah.
 What about you?
 feel like with all the busyness and all the sort of pressure of the last couple years,
 I feel like I've kind of lost me.
 Kind of lost you?
 Yeah.
 And so I think really my main goal other than getting lots of time with the kids is to
 refine to me.
 Do you know where you left you?
 I'm not being quite.
 I don't know.
 I'm genuinely curious.
 I don't know.
 Under a bus somewhere I think.
 One of the reasons this is an odd episode in many ways is one, my beautiful co-host doesn't
 have a voice, so it's very hard to podcast when you don't have a voice.
 But part of this episode is just to give some context to why there's not going to be any
 episodes for the next eight weeks, because as we go into the sabbatical, we are pushing
 pause on everything, not just Ministry at Grace Centre, but also all of our extracurricular
 activities.
 really one of the major focuses is time with the kids because I'm not sure how much price
 our kids have paid in the last couple of years. So I'm looking forward to that. We sat down
 with them and had a family meeting about what they want to do. That was an interesting
 list of things.
 That's why I want to do something like an RFP trip or something that's kind of epic
 because what are we going to get eight weeks off again?
 I mean, I think that's the pressure.
  </li><li>But this has been like the memory,
 like I want them to look back and go,
 remember that amazing summer that we went into it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And there's at such great ages with Appian 15 and Diab 13
 and MJ about to be 10, like they're gonna remember this
 for like ages.
  </li><li>Has it dawned on you that while we're on sabbatical,
 we might get a baby?
  </li><li>It hasn't, but it's certainly possible.
 It's funny because even in the last couple of days, one of the agencies that we've followed
 has posted more.
 Not that we are qualified for because they want a family who's based in Utah or whatever.
 But it's interesting certainly with the Roe v. Wade getting overturned.
 My heart is like, "Oh, this is so amazing."
 My hope is that Christians are going to stand up and say, "We'll take them and we'll give
 them a loving home. So I would imagine adoption statistics are about to really change. Apparently
 the last year they went down 45%. Right. We got an email from one of the adoption agencies that said
 that pregnancies in the last two years have dropped, adoptions have dropped.
 I mean, really COVID had a, you know, we're now being able to see the massive knock on effects of
 that. But we even had a conversation with one of our adoption people this week. And they were like,
 you know, typically somebody in your situation would have been matched by now. But what we're
 seeing is all of the agencies are slowing down. All of the people who are in the adoption process
 are slowing down, which made me feel a little bit better because, you know, here we are, we've checked
 all the boxes, we've done everything we can, and we're waiting and nothing's happening.
 Which again, we're not in the situation, which I can imagine some families are who are
 You know, they don't have any kids. This is maybe going to be their first child.
 Right.
 You know, we are living, continue to live a rich, full, busy life and are looking forward
 to a baby.
 Yes.
 But it's not the most preoccupied thought at the front of my head.
 Well, we still have full life in the midst of it, yeah.
 Right. But I was wondering, oh, the timing is interesting.
 Yeah.
 We'll just be interested to see what the Lord does.
 Yeah, we really will be interesting, yeah.
 Well, in an effort of not stressing my wife's throat anymore.
 I'm going to bring this one to a close.
 Thanks, babe.
 It's a weird episode, for sure.
 But we did want to just let you know where we are and where we're going.
 You will not hear from us for the next eight weeks, either podcasting or on social media.
 We're taking a break from everything.
 Thank you so much for joining us on our journey.
 We're in our 286th episode.
 We are looking forward to being back in late August when we come back from our sabbatical
 and hopefully we'll still have some stories to tell you about what we did on sabbatical.
 But for now, thank you so much for being with us.
 We are praying that you have an incredible time on your next eight weeks and look forward
 to being with you soon.
 Bye.
