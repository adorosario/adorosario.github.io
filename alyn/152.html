<p> I'm in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is Mrs.
 AJ Jones. Yes, here. How the heck are you?
 I am both full and exhausted.<br/>
 This week was pretty much a blur.<br/>
 It was totally a blur.<br/>
 Great week.<br/>
 Had the more conference this week and got to meet tons of people that have been listening to the podcast.
 Yeah, from all over the country.<br/>
 It was amazing.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 Thank you, everybody who came up to say hi.
 It was super encouraging.<br/>
 It was so fun.<br/>
 It was so fun to meet you.<br/>
 Yeah, I met listeners in Seattle.<br/>
 Yes, from Seattle.<br/>
 Yeah, Florida.<br/>
 Yes, Kentucky, look at you, Alabama and Maryland, I think.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So I'm sorry if I've missed out on what state you're from.
 I'm it's all sort of blending together for me.
 The weekend was quite intense.<br/>
 I find I probably need a couple of weeks to process it.
 The week went was amazing.<br/>
 But to be sure, we're not going to be able to give you an update on the more
 conference until we've had a little bit more sleep and a little bit more time to
 process it. Amen. Yes. Yes. Which is just as well. Because we have an awful lot of
 ground to cover tonight. We certainly do. We love getting to run a school all about
 transformation. Yes. And so we've asked some of our graduates to join us this week to
 just talk about their journey to the school and their experiences on the school.
 Yeah, it's going to be great. Welcome, guys. Hey. Thanks for having us. This is exciting.
 I wish everybody could see how cute you guys look with your headphones and microphones and all of that.
 I think where we want to begin is I want to ask you guys how you even ended up at the school because as I'm looking around the room,
 not a lot of you were actually from Franklin to begin with.
 So what was your journey? How did you end up hearing about the school? How did you end up applying? Who wants to start?
 Okay, well, since all eyes are on me, I guess that means.
 Well, I was basically in full-time ministry or an outreach capacity and had done a Bible school,
 had done YWAM, and to be honest, I didn't really think I needed the school. So I had friends that
 had done it, as well as different church members at Grace Center that had approached me and said,
 "Hey, have you ever thought about it?" And I immediately would just kind of dismiss it and think,
 "Well, I have a full-time job. I'm already in ministry. I had my list of why I don't think I need to."
 to. And then one of my closest friends went through the school and I literally saw him
 the transformation in his life created such a hunger in my own where I thought, wow, like
 I would love to see that kind of transformation in my own life. And what would it look like
 if I wasn't as prideful and didn't think I had kind of arrived? And I think Holy Spirit
 kind of convicted me on that and said, "Oh, well, that's good.
 You think you've arrived and you're at the ceiling of what growth looks like because
 you're "in ministry, if you will."<br/>
 And so I thought, "Oh, yeah, I haven't arrived and I do want to be a continual learner,"
 or as Alan says, "also a continual un-learner."
 And thought, "I would love to see that kind of change in transformation."
 So initially it didn't seem possible and then kind of got to a place where I thought, "If
 this is God, it's going to be possible.
 So let's just at least fill out the application.
 It couldn't hurt.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 I'm just going to sit down, fill out this application, and at least take that first
 step and then see what God does with that first initial yes that says, okay,
 I'm going to do this.<br/>
 So yeah, it's funny what a trap.<br/>
 The pride thing is, isn't it?<br/>
 Like in terms of I've arrived because I know like for myself a couple of different
 times in my life, I thought, okay, like I'm good.
 I've arrived now, you know, and then the Lord will just show you something a little bit different
 and you're like, "Oh, I haven't arrived because I don't think we ever do." But yeah, that's awesome.
 So cool. Hi, I'm Adam. And my wife and I, we, our journey was kind of a strange one in that we
 were actually directors of a school in North Carolina with Catch the Fire, amazing ministry,
 amazing group of people, love them all dearly. And we've done that for a few years and
 we're sort of in a season of transition and ended up going to Toronto, which shout out to
 TACF/KitsFartrano and did a three-week leader school. And while we were there,
 through a series of kind of crazy experiences in the Lord speaking to us, and then also a hunger
 for more training, more equipping, more healing, we, Lord spoke to us about Nashville. And then
 that partnered with a hunger for more.
 We were just like, Lord, what does this look like?
 What does this mean?<br/>
 Okay, training and equipping Ivan Allum, who you guys know love Ivan and Isabelle.
 Ivan profsite over us at the school and gave us this incredible word about stepping
 and quickly stepping into a season of training and equipping.
 So as we processed all of this, we realized, oh, there's a school in Nashville or Franklin.
 And it not only is it a school connected with Toronto, obviously you guys having
</p><ul>
  <li>Sure. - I'm from there, but it's doable
 in that we can go, it's two days a week,
 we don't really know what the future looks like,
 we don't really know why we're going,
 other than we were hungry for healing.
 We knew that the trajectory of our lives was going up,
 but we felt that the condition of our heart
 was not going in the same direction as our life was.
 Not that we were horribly depressed or anything,
 but just, we knew there was more for us
 and it felt like the right time in the season to step into training and equipping.
  </li><li>Because you're a director of a school just like ours.
  </li><li>Yeah, right.
  </li><li>You and your wife were both directors, and that's what blew our mind.
 We're like, but don't you have your own school?
 Why are you coming to this school?
 That just caused us no end of amusement.
 And just your humility that you would leave your job, your life, your home where you were,
 a cross country and set up, 'cause you didn't know anybody.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>I mean, you knew nobody here.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>And you had a baby girl.
  </li><li>And we had a gosh, a five, six month old.
 And again, nothing was wrong with our life in Raleigh.
 It was amazing.
 Community was great and job was great
 and all that sort of thing.
 But after taking three weeks off to just invest
 in who we were individually and our relationship with God,
 it was like, we have to have more.
 We'd never not done that.
 we'd always been in leading something,
 whether it was youth group as a kid, college ministry,
 young adult ministry, school of ministry,
 which we love, but taking that time, it was like,
 oh, this is so vital.
 This is huge.
 Like, there could not be anything more valuable
 to invest your time and money in
 than figuring out who you are
 and what your dynamic, what the relationship with God
 that you are created for is like.
 We were sort of like, felt like we were flying at 10,000 feet,
 but had never really learned how to fly.
 Do you know what I mean?
 It was like, how do we do these controls?
 And who's even controlling the plane?
 Am I?
 So that was what landed us in Nashville to do the school.
 Yeah, come on.
  </li><li>Well, for me, coming to the school
 was probably totally out of left field
 in the scope of the rest of my life.
 And the school prior to me coming was actually part of what helped me to become saved in the first place.
 So at the age of 26, I came down and I visited Grace Center and emanate and the school because a friend of mine was a small group leader at the time.
 And I wasn't entirely sure what I even thought about God or Jesus.
 And I was kind of warming up to the idea,
 but the experiences I had,
 just witnessing what I did when I visited
 were part of the final things that helped me to
 finally give my life to Jesus.
 And the second I did that,
 there was no question in my mind
 that if I was going to do this with the Lord,
 I was gonna do it all the way.
 I don't like to do things part way.
 So for me, I was like, well,
 I've like run away from this my entire life,
 and I'm not gonna waste any time.
 And I just really wanted to be fully immersed.
 So it was a no-brainer.
 I knew I'd met people.
 when I visited the school and they were different,
 and I was just attracted to whatever it was that they had.
 And I think maybe something in my spirit knew
 that I would need like the safety to being a new believer.
 So I applied, I think pretty quickly after I got saved.
  </li><li>Elena, that's amazing.
 I love hearing your story.
 I'm now looking to my left at an old friend from Scotland,
 even though he's Irish.
 Mr. Quinn, talk to us about your journey to the school.
 Okay.
 So my journey to the school, I spotted a tweet from your good self
 in which you'd spelled a word incorrectly.
 And, you know, I couldn't let the world suffer under.
 I had the corrector spelling, which I was compelled to.
 Yeah.
 I know you were.
 You mentioned that.
 And so we had a very brief Twitter conversation, which ended up with you saying
 You should come out and visit us.
 And for context sake, I'd left the UK in 2003.
 This is now what, maybe 2010, 2012.
 So we hadn't seen each other since my wedding,
 really in 2005.
 No.
 And so I'm living in America, you're living in the UK.
 I tweet something, you correct the spelling.
 And I say, hey, now that I've got your attention,
 why don't you come out to Nashville for a break?
 But I was too proud.
 So I thought, why, you can't tell me
 what to do with my holiday's vacation. So I just didn't, I didn't actually give
 in respond to that. I think I just let it hang. And I suppose again, the Lord was just
 working in my heart and, you know, that manifested itself as, you know what, I'm being invited
 out to go to a nice sunny place for a holiday. Why would I not want to do that? So I got
 back in touch and said, Hey, you know, by that offer, if it's still open, can I kind
 to come. And you said yes. And so I came out. It was almost exactly this time of year because
 it was in fact, I didn't come out for the more conference, which we've just had here.
 I came out on holiday and those were the dates that I could make. So I arrived on the first
 night of the more conferences that turned out. And Gary Morgan was speaking in that
 conference who I think you had on here last week. So I hadn't experienced prophecy like that.
 Ever before I had an experience words of knowledge, I hadn't experienced
 he he prophesied over me, which had a huge impact on me. But most of all, I think I just experienced
 the presence of God in a way that I hadn't before. So when you say you'd never experienced the
 presence of God like that, help help us understand what you mean by that. I mean, I had experienced
 for sure the presence I've got before. I'd spent time in worship and experienced the presence of
 God. It was just thicker. It was just kinder. So I'm standing in worship, typically at a worship
 session at the more conference back there in 2012. The words of the songs were impacted me,
 and I loved them. But really wasn't the words of the songs. It wasn't like I heard the Lord speak
 distinctly to me and any specific thing. I didn't hear any specific words from him. I was just
 overwhelmed by a sense of how much he loved me. And that's a very difficult thing to explain
 because it's not particularly rational. But I was just overcome by a sense of his goodness and
 his kindness towards me and his love. So you encounter God's presence, you encounter our culture,
 and I know that you decided to do the school because you came and did it.
 coming to the school cost you a lot, not just our application fee, but you had to leave Scotland,
 quit your job, pretty much sell everything you own and move to a foreign country.
 Without knowing what you were getting, talk us through that process because that's a huge commitment.
 Well, without saying, without knowing what I was getting is true, but on the other hand,
 I could see some of it here. So in my interactions, even with people, I was aware of not just yourself,
 but other people that I encountered on that trip over here. I just saw something they had that I
 didn't have, which I couldn't necessarily put into words. But I guess if I was to try and put
 into words, I would say they had a much better sense of their identity in God. They were more
 operating out of sonship. They were operating as sons and daughters that knew they were loved
 unconditionally. And that was permeating their whole, their words, their actions,
 their everything. And I didn't have that. And so while you're right in that, I didn't know what
 I was getting, I could see what the end result could be. And I was excited by that.
 I think we were all staggered when you, because I knew your life in Scotland,
 you had a great job. You were a working professional. You earned a good salary, you had a great life,
 and you quit everything. I think that's one of the most awe-inspiring things for us as the
 director of the school is to watch people leave many of the things that the world is trying to acquire
 to come live in Franklin, Tennessee for eight months and sit in a tin room for two days a week
 and learn about the presence. It's humbling, it's amazing. And then of course we love watching
 people's hunger be rewarded by the transformation that we see.
 And it was such a joy for me, of course, because we've got a long, long history going
 back years and years and years to when we were, but young lads in university.
 And plus I'm jealous for everybody to experience Southern hospitality in America.
 And I don't think you'd ever had your tea iced or your biscuits with gravy.
 No, I hadn't.
 I was glad to have that.
 It's all part of the glory.
 Yeah.
 it was a combination of my husband's poor spelling
 and Southern food that brought you to the school.
  </li><li>Big whatever it takes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Amanda, tell us what brought you here.
  </li><li>Gosh, when you ask that question,
 a flood of emotions just hit me out of nowhere
 'cause to put myself back into that thought process
 that I was in before doing the school
 is just a world of difference from where I'm at now.
 So here's your first shameless plug to do the school.
 (both laughing)
 So I had gone to the school of worship in Bethel.
 And so I had done that and I had tasted first
 of like what the Lord's love could be like.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I remember really wanting to do BSSM.
 And so around that same time when I came back home,
 I had applied and got accepted to their school
 and it just felt like I wasn't supposed to go.
 And around the same time I started visiting Nashville.
 And so I came to Gray Center for a conference
 and was introduced to the world of Gray Center
 and all the wonderful things.
 And so I just became like this home away from home feeling.
 And when I decided to move here,
 it was no question in my mind that I wanted
 to taste the freedom that I was experiencing.
 Though I didn't know how to explain
 like what I was picking up on the people around me.
 That's what led me.
 I remember somebody asking me.
 I was an alumni student and they said,
 why do you wanna do this school?
 And I had this really big vulnerability moment
 where I said I would really like to not hate myself anymore.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Truly like I was in such a broken state
 and I had so much self-hatred
 and all of these really intense, heavy feelings
 and it really was the choice to do this school
 is like I really know that I need help
 and I need the Lord's love.
  </li><li>So cool.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And he came through.
  </li><li>Come on.
 He always comes through, doesn't he?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>For our listeners, honestly,
 I wish you could see these incredible graduates
 because they literally are shining examples
 of what God can do with laid down lives.
 I mean, seriously, you're all amazing.
  </li><li>You really are, guys.
  </li><li>Okay, Judah, talk to us about your story
 because your story has a few interesting twists and turns.
  </li><li>Goodness.
 The way that I got to the school is super interesting.
 You're chuckling now, mainly because I thought it was a cult for a little bit.
 Yeah, you applied and then ran away.
 Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
 Talk to us about that.
 So I came to, I started coming to emanate in the fall of 2012 and Mr. Alan Jones gave
 me a prophetic word.
 I don't even remember that freaked me out.
 It was my first time to emanate and you like relayed back to me my entire life and you had
 never seen me or met me before. And it was this really kind of just supernatural experience
 for me where I felt so seen and known by the Lord. So that's what kind of kept me coming.
 Even though I thought it was super weird, I thought everyone was super weird and likeJust 
 because of your church background and not bringing?
 Yeah. So like I grew up Pentecostal. So like they believed in like experiencing the Holy
 spirit, but it was nothing like Gray Center.
 Right.
 Not even close.
 And yeah, it kept me coming.
 Like some of the stuff that was, was a little weird was like people
 manifesting.
 And that was hard for me.
 Um, and just like the idea of like, wait, everyone can prophesy, like it's not
 just like the elders of the church, like that kind of stuff.
 But so I was coming to emanate for a while.
 And then I went one night and you guys had like a guest speaker and it kind
 like really freaked me out. And so who was it? Cause it's James Gull.
 With James, was it the night that was it like the night where like James was
 at emanate once and it's easily one of the top 10 services I've ever been in my
 life. Yeah, he was like an Old Testament prophet. Yeah, it was it was the night
 that he he stood up. Um, Sarah and Josh Parsons. Yep. And talked about like how
 Charlie Brown had come to him in a dream and told him that the Parsons are pastors.
 I was like, what is happening right now?
 And you have no training in the prophetic.
 So you've got no grid for that.
 No, no, great at all.
 Right.
 And so I get super freaked out and I'm like, well, I like, I don't think I can come to this place anymore.
 And so I left Gray Center for like five, five to six months and ran away to Central America.
 You thought you honestly thought we were a cult.
 You had people saying that to cult.
 Yeah.
 Loves to Kundalini spirit at work.
 You watch some scary YouTube videos.
 Yep.
 I just had people calling me like, hey, I'm just really concerned for you.
 Like you're a part of this like church movement, false teachers and all this stuff.
 And so I left Gray Center and then I remember the first time I recognized that I missed
 the present and I recognized that it was the presence of God that I missed.
 I just sat on my floor and cried and cried and cried for like two or three hours.
 Just be like, oh, I just want to go back there.
 I just want to go back there.
 I just want to go back there.
 But I can't because it's a cult.
 And, uh, and then I encountered God pretty radically where he just told me to move back to Chicago.
 So I moved back to Chicago.
 And in Chicago, I read this book called Wild at Heart.
 And at the end of the book, they have you ask God a question.
 You ask him, "Hey, what do you think about me?"
 And so I asked him that and he didn't answer me.
 He said, "Do you trust me?"
 I was like, "Yes."
  </li><li>That's right. - Yeah.
 Yes.
 And he said, "Then move back to Nashville
 and do the school supernatural life."
 And so that's how I got to the school.
  </li><li>It's pretty good when you get an endorsement
 from the Lord himself.
  </li><li>Totally. - Yeah.
 And I remember like, that was the reason why I went
 because I know what I heard
 And like going into it, I was super nervous.
 But the Lord was like, hey, just trust,
 trust everything that these people tell you.
  </li><li>Whoa.
  </li><li>And so that's kind of what had me stay there
 and just be open to everything that people have taught me there
 is because the Lord said, hey,
 stay open to everything these people have to say
 'cause it's gonna lead to abundant life.
  </li><li>Gosh, I love that.
  </li><li>I realize this next question is pretty broad
 and you could probably answer it a different way
 on any different date.
 But having done the school, what were some of the things that changed for you?
 Everything.
 I was actually thinking about this earlier, just in preparation for the interview.
 And the only thing I could come up with was everything.
 It changed everything.
 Um, because I can look at.
 I can look at every area of my life and see practically and spiritually.
 The things that I have would not be that way
 if I hadn't done this school.
 And the life that I have with the Lord
 and the marriage that I have
 and even the confidence I have in my future
 and to echo Amanda a little bit,
 the love that I have for myself now,
 I don't think would have been possible
 had I not had the opportunity to be immersed in that community,
 especially as a newer believer.
 People never believe that I've only known the Lord
 for like a couple of years and they meet me.
 And I think it's because I was steeped in that environment.
 And there are things that I see my friends going through
 spiritually or even just like theological battles
 that they have that I don't feel affected by
 because I'm so convinced of God's love for me.
 So the school quit me in so many ways
 that every day I'm using those skills still,
 like especially the communication
 and Alan's teaching about how to be awesome because the Lord has given us authority over
 our lives.
 And for me, that was the first time in my life I realized I wasn't actually a victim
 and that I had been living like a victim and so passive.
 So there's all these very practical ways that we've been equipped and even in ministry
 things, so praying and prophesying and praying for healing.
 But I think just that foundation of the love of God, if I had not been immersed in that,
 I just think my life would look so different now.
 But I think everything I have now that I love was made possible because I invested in getting
 my life turned upside down.
 It's crazy because everything can feel like such a cliche thing to say, but the school
 is designed in such a way to kind of remove the clutter of your life, of the beliefs that
 you have about yourself and about other people and leaders and God.
 And so you're sort of have this blank canvas to finally receive the Lord in his fullness.
 And then his fullness comes into like the fullness of your life.
 And there's not one area that it couldn't possibly touch, which is just amazing.
 And again, it feels annoying that it feels kind of like cliche to say, but it's just
 completely true.
 Adam, I would say probably one of the biggest things that changed for me was what I was
 Well, you guys talk about, you say this quite often
 in the school and it's so true.
 And maybe it's a quote from someone else.
 So correct me if I'm wrong,
 but the key to learning is being able to unlearn
 just as well or something to that.
  </li><li>Yeah, to be lifelong learners,
 we have to be lifelong unlearners.
  </li><li>So I would say a huge part of my experience at SLSL
 was unlearning bad thinking,
 whether it was ungodly beliefs or even just stuff you pick up,
 not necessarily that anyone taught you,
 but you just life and hurts and pains.
 you just begin, you create these frameworks in your mind
 and I'd created some really horrific frameworks
 for how I lived my life.
 So for example, the boundaries week
 absolutely turned my life upside down.
 I'd never, I'd heard the book,
 even being given the book, never read it.
 Probably should have done that.
 Could have saved me a few years of pain,
 but I remember that week being so heartbroken,
 listening to you teach on boundaries
 because I realized, I realized that I'd never realized
 how much power God had given me in the way I could live my life
 and interact with people and govern my relationships
 that would actually promote health instead of death.
 And here's what I mean.
 I shaped my future, I shaped the way I thought about myself.
 I shaped the way even dynamics in my marriage
 around what I thought people thought about me
 and I thought that was being a good Christian.
  </li><li>Whoa, your whole life was dictated
 by what you thought other people thought of you.
  </li><li>Totally.
 So take a good principle like submit to healthy leaders.
 And I would then take that to the nth degree
 and say, okay, whatever Allen, Allen's my leader,
 whatever Allen says about me, is it?
 And I have to, if I do anything outside of that,
 what is he thinking of me?
 If I step out, if I have a passion for something
 that isn't within the scope of what Allen has prophesied
 over me or shared with me, I need to throw it away
 because that's not God's plan for my life.
 Or like, I mean, just crazy stuff that seemed normal
 my mind. Right. And you begin to talk about things like, what are the dreams within your heart?
 Well, what are the things that God's put within you? Well, hey, did you know that you can actually
 temper who has influence in your life, starting with God number one, leaders and and spouse or
 and sort of like moving in these outer ring circles and realizing, wow, just because
 this guy that I met that goes to my church or that I work with or whatever the case is says this
 thing about me, I don't need to live my life in such a way that I have to, I have to appease him.
 Like, so even in leading the school, which was a, such a growing and incredible many ways experience,
 as a school director, this is horrible. As a school director, I shaped my job and my role and my
 expectation of what I was supposed to look like based on whether or not the students liked me.
 And you, can you imagine how horrible, I mean, hindsight, I didn't know any different, right?
 I didn't know any better. I just thought, okay, the evidence of me doing well in something is how
 people respond. If you're doing well, then people like you and they affirm you. And if you don't
 like me and affirm me, I'm doing something wrong. And now I think of that. And that's horrible,
 but that was the cage I lived in. So you're constantly being held hostage to other people's
 expectations of you. Exactly. Voluntarily, by the way. Exactly. And I thought that was the right
 thing to do. I literally didn't know that that was wrong until, and it's more broad than just
 boundaries week, but just being set free from that and realizing I'm not responsible for how you
 think of me. I'm only responsible for being me, and I never knew that I was free to just be me.
 Oh, I love that.
 All right, Mr. Quinn, same question to you. I think the man thing that changed me,
 And I'm just, I was just sharing with these guys that I think literally it changes every
 few months.
 You know, sometimes I think to myself, oh, it was this.
 And then I'm like, no, you know what, it was this.
 I have this new revelation that actually the stuff, the truth that was imparted to me during
 the school is a different thing.
 But I think honestly it boils down to being confident and hearing God's voice for myself,
 that changed from me, was my confidence in hearing God's voice.
 So I am confident that I did hear God's voice before I came to the school.
 It's just that while I was viewing it, I were hearing him through a filter a lot of
 the time.
 So I was a lot of the time I was hearing angry God, which I know wasn't the voice of
 God.
 Therefore, I didn't seek him out.
 I didn't presume.
 I didn't want to spend time listening to him because he didn't have anything nice to say
 about me.
 So it seemed then I learned to sit down and hear his voice.
 I learned about the father heart and I realized just how much he loved me.
 And therefore, and then I, that made me want to hear him speak over me.
 And the change that that's brought about my life is nothing short of miraculous because
 that has provided the foundation from my identity now.
 So my identity before would have been on, on how well I did things, right?
 And what other people thought of me.
 it's based on what the Lord thinks about me and I know what he thinks about me and it's all good.
 And so whenever I hit a patch where I don't feel affirmed or I feel less than confident about what
 I'm doing or I don't know. Like, so let's say I'm speaking at, we have a school in Edinburgh,
 let's say I speak at the school or I speak in my church and I feel like I've done a very good job
 rather than beating myself up about it. I asked the father what he thinks about it or what he thinks about me.
 And I rest in that rather than in perhaps criticism from other people or perceived, you know, disapproval from other people or whatever it may be.
 So it's changed my whole, the foundation of my identity because I get my identity from what he says about me.
 And what's crazy is if you think about it, that's week one. Like week one. Hello.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're gonna teach you how to hear God's voice
 in four easy steps.
 And we guarantee you, you will be able to hear God's voice.
 Like I love what you said, that I could hear God's voice,
 but it seemed like it was his discretion.
 Like when he would speak, I would hear him.
 But now learning, I can hear God as often
 as I choose to listen for him,
 not as often as he choose to speak.
 That's amazing, I love it.
  </li><li>It's so cool.
 Change for me, having done the school
 and then been a small group leader at the school,
 and then now, one year out of the school, to me change looks like it started a process
 of change that continues on a daily basis.
 So every day, not being in the school, I realize currently my life now is impacted because
 of the tools that I was given for eight months.
 So I don't necessarily think of it as a before and an after.
 I can see the results.
 So just on a practical level before the school, growing up in church, my dad's a pastor.
 So that was kind of my immersion was from my earliest memories.
 It was church.
 But as a result of that, people are people.
 And just because you're in church doesn't mean they're perfect.
 But my personal experience was a lot of church authority wounding.
 Or I don't know if I can trust these people.
 not because of my dad, but just because what I was surrounded with growing up seeing people that are just
 They're in need of a savior. Just like I am, you know, right?
 So I came in with a lot of distrust towards church leadership and like I don't know if I want them to see my junk
 Because it could disqualify me, but realizing I think on the flip side of the school
 Like God really did a healing work in that where I go. Wow. This leadership is safe. They're not scared by my junk
 They're not going to write me off.
 It's not a legalistic church environment.
 It's so free and it's literally empowering me to be the woman of God that God's designed
 me to be because of the church leadership that's there to protect me, but then also
 to champion and inspire and encourage me.
 So I think on a practical level, my perspective of church leadership has totally shifted.
 at the same time on a daily basis, I see the change where I go, wow, I couldn't have the
 job that I have now had I not done the school and dealt with, let's say, the topic of ungodly
 beliefs. Because this job right now that I have, I'm like, this is, I feel like I'm highly
 underqualified for this. I don't know what I'm doing. And you can hear the ungodly beliefs
 just start coming out of the woodwork. But to be able to go now, I'm driving into work.
 I'm called, I'm going to begin to implement godly beliefs that I know I'm called in this
 season of life to do this job or in relationships or I mean there's every week I feel like at
 the school is equipping you for long term change.
 So to me I think that's the most beautiful thing is it's literally setting you up with
 eight months of tools and habits to become a highly effective person in a professional level,
 in a spiritual level, you're walk with the Lord, in a supernatural level, because we're supernatural
 beings. It's just emerging of every component of life being equipped with tools to how to better
 handle it and see long-term change. So cool. Judah, what about you?
 That's a really loaded question because so many things changed for me in my life after just the first year of school, let alone the second year of school.
 That's right, because you did both years.
 Yeah, and then was just on staff for a year.
 Yeah.
 And so doing three years, kind of in the pressure cooker of S.O.S.L.
 that there's so many aspects of my life that are completely different.
 But to go back to the first thing that I think started,
 the snowball effect in my life and my relationship with the Lord was,
 I feel like there were two parts of the Godhead that I had never really been introduced to.
 And I felt like I was set in a room and like taken by the hand and introduced to the Holy Spirit
 and then taken by the hand and introduced to the Father,
 and met them for the first time.
 And that changed everything.
 Meeting them, getting to know them, the Holy Spirit,
 and all of the wild aspects of who He is,
 and the Father and His kindness and His love and His mercy.
 That changed everything.
 I think a huge aspect that was restored to me as well,
 In year one was like falling in love with the bride.
 I was just super bitter and angry.
 I wasn't, I'm a pastor's kid.
 So I was like a really angry pastor's kid wounded by the church.
 But as I got to know the father and got to know the Holy Spirit and got to know Jesus and their hearts,
 I couldn't help but form with the bride as well.
 Right.
 So you devout to new love for the church and you love for the church, for community, for family.
 Absolutely.
 speaking of that, the church, I think it's interesting that I'm looking around the table and
 Grace Center was new to you guys too, for some of you at least. So it wasn't just the
 school culture that was new to you, but it was also Grace and that was new to you. And
 I know, Judy, you were saying that when you first came, we thought it was a cult.
 Yeah. Describe what grace and are like to people who've never been a grace in her.
 Oh man, it's like a river.
 I think like, Grace Center is just this really
 kind of amazing family of people.
 And I think that there's something amazing
 that can be experienced if you choose to let them know you.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I mean, I had so many strange encounters
 my first couple times at Grace Center.
 I remember this one time.
 I just like kind of partied the night before.
 And I was like, okay, God, I'm gonna go to church,
 but don't let anybody like, don't let them see me.
 'Cause it still weirds me out that these people
 like know things about me and all this stuff.
 So I go into church Sunday morning
 and then I see, I think it's the personal ministry's pastor,
 Christine Stroup.
 I see her looking at me from the distance.
 And I'm like, God, like, I told you I was gonna come
 if you didn't let them see me.
 And she walks over to me and she says,
 hey, I don't really know you.
 But I feel like you're hidden.
 I see a paper bag over your head.
 And I just wanna let you know it's okay
 that you want to be hidden,
 but this is a safe place to be seen.
 (both laughing)
  </li><li>How does that make you feel?
  </li><li>It was just a crazy wild, wild adventure
 of experiencing church and family in the Holy Spirit
 and the Father and Jesus all working together
 as one big family.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 Because I had had that experience at Bethel,
 I remember the first time walking into Gray Center
 and feeling like, oh, this feels the same.
 It feels so similar.
 And if you've ever been to Reading California and Bethel,
 like just the presence of God is so thick.
 And it's the honor placed on the presence of God.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That God is a friend and he's our honored guest
 and he's the one that we're here for.
 And so that was evident the moment that I walked in the door.
 And it's never changed.
 It's always been the same, so consistent
 in the high value for the presence of God.
 And so, Grace Center is this wonderful place
 where we get to practice doing family with people.
 And it's a wonderful experience.
 'Cause I have had experiences in family
 and in church family where I've had a lot of hurts
 and like so many people have.
 And it was a challenge to say yes to family
 and to say yes to church and to say yes to a new experience.
 But on the other side of that,
 I've experienced so much healing and wholeness,
 just attending church, just like being apart
 and being around moms and dads and sons and daughters
 and just family.
 And it's been wonderful, it changed my life.
 It was amazing.
 Yay.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>How would you describe Grace Center?
 I mean, what's Grace Center being like for you?
  </li><li>Grace Center has been a really safe place
 to be in process.
 Like it, it's a, I could imagine the dynamic
 of hosting people for a short period of time,
 but also trying to be a local church family
 would be an interesting thing to navigate for you guys
 as leadership team.
 But it's never once felt like, well,
 there's the school students,
 And but here's over here's the local church.
 It's just like we're in this big Holy Ghost mess together
 and figuring it out as we go.
 Like and walking under Pastor Jeff on Sundays
 is the most fun thing because he's like so humble.
 And and so I don't know.
 He's just in for the ride.
 He's in for the adventure.
 And that's what I think doing the school.
 It's that there's a big element of the unknown.
 I mean, you guys, you get a pant or a catalog
 And you lay out as much force as possible as far as what the weeks are going to look like in the schedule.
 But at the end of the day, it's sort of like when God shows up, who knows what's going to happen.
 And so there's that element on Sunday mornings that is fun.
 You just don't know what the service is going to look like.
 And you don't know what, yeah, what's going to happen.
 And I think so coming in and being a student, but wanting community, it was a really safe place
 to find that, to find relationship, to be in process.
 The cool thing about Nashville is there's so many people who are really well known for
 their music or their ministry or their job or whatever.
 And then there's obviously a ton of people who aren't known at all, yet at Grace Center,
 it feels like it's a level playing field.
 Like there's not a hierarchy of, well, you're anointed and amazing and you're in the school.
 So you just kind of like, I mean, no, it's like we're, we're just in this.
 We're just together.
 We're going to go for God.
 We're going to go for healing.
 We're going to go for revival.
 or the kingdom, you know, and it's,
 but I've noticed for those people,
 like Judah talking about how he had been hurt by the church,
 but you obviously, Judah at some point, came and said,
 "I'm in," like you had a positive mentality.
 So that would be the flip side, as I remember Anna and I
 coming in and just crying the first Sunday,
 and we were like, "We're in."
 Like I remember choosing, like,
 even though we've never been here before,
 well, we've been here one time, a year or two prior
 on a visit to see my sister, but like,
 work in, like this is gonna be home.
 I remember choosing that.
 And had we not done that,
 I don't know that we would have had the same experience.
  </li><li>Right.
 What about your experience, Quinn?
  </li><li>Wow, Grace Center.
 I love Grace Center.
 I mean, I just, I arrived to do the school.
 And so I hadn't experienced Grace Center
 apart from the war conference beforehand.
 And so I wasn't really sure what I was gonna expect,
 but I was signed up to it.
 You know, I had committed and that was it.
 And I loved it. I just experienced so much honor and favor there from the word go. And
 people sometimes say that's because of my accent, but I don't believe it. So I loved
 it. I loved that. I loved the freedom and the freedom from any kind of program necessarily.
 So I mean, obviously, most Sunday's grace center looks like a certain thing. It looks
 like you start in worship and then you have some notices and then you have a talk and
 you finish.
 I mean, that's basically how it works, like most churches, right?
 But there were times and it felt like a significant number of times when Pastor Jeff would just
 can the talk, you know, which he had probably prepared a great length.
 And just because the presence of God was so thick, so obvious that he would just roll
 with it and we would just spend more time in worship.
 We would spend time in silence.
 we would spend time waiting on the Lord.
 And I just love that there was that freedom
 and that he had the courage to do that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Courage is something he does not lack.
  </li><li>No, and I also remember,
 I mean, these are little things that just jumped out to me.
 I remember several times you or Pastor Jeff
 or whoever was emceeing or leading the service would get up,
 you know, when there was a time of ministry
 or when it was a time of worship
 and it had just gone quiet and it had been quiet for a while
 Or just the presence of God was there and you would openly say from the front, "Hey,
 we don't actually know what to do."
 And there was that courage of just trusting the Holy Spirit and not needing to perform
 in a certain way because of a certain way it was expected of you because this is the
 way that you were in a service or this is what you're supposed to do now.
 It's just like, "We don't know what to do, so we're just going to roll with this for
 a while."
 I love that.
 You know, there's so few people like Jeff Daller, like his, his meekness is matched only by his
 boldness. And those two usually don't go together. But his, his resolute honor of God over and above
 the fear of man, I think is amazing. That's a good way to be. That's why we're all like, oh,
 we're following you. Yeah. I know you don't know where you're going some of the time, but we're
 not intimidated by that. Yeah. We'll, we'll, we'll follow you as you follow God.
 I think my answer is probably pretty brief.
 I think it's, Grace Center is a, it's a family that has one thing in mind, we're going after
 God and we don't care what it looks like.
 Yeah.
 And to me, I think that's a beautiful thing to truly have, like you said, the dads and
 the moms and almost like the uncles and the aunts and then the teenagers and the middle
 schoolers and the children and to literally have the full spectrum of life in one church.
 It's not a youth church.
 It's not just, well, it's a bunch of, like, it doesn't fit into one age grouping, which
 I feel like that's so healthy to have the full spectrum of ages, the full spectrum of
 wisdom, the full spectrum of youth.
 And I think that's probably the best way I would put it.
 It's a group of people that are in pursuit of God, and it doesn't matter what it looks
 like.
 It also doesn't matter what you look like either, which is fun, because it's easy to
 walk into church and feel a little self-conscious of, "Oh, is everyone looking at me?"
 Or, "What am I doing?"
 And to realize, "No, not as many people are looking at you as you think they are."
 Right.
 And any one at Grace Center that is looking at you is looking at you through the eyes of
 love and the eyes of God the Father, which is like we don't care what you look like.
 care about your heart and your heart is in this room with our hearts.
 So let's just go after Jesus.
 Yeah.
 I love that thing of being able to come as you are because it kind of makes me think
 if you showed up in your pajamas, people would assume they missed the notice that it was
 pajama day.
 They wouldn't think that you were strange.
 You know, it was just like, "Well, right then, let's do this."
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I completely agree.
 I feel like my answer is very similar, but it has to do with the heart, like the heart
 of God, which is what I feel like everything we do is around.
 Like there's such a rich, like, inner healing ministry at our church, and this school is
 very much like that.
 It's the first for weeks are all core heart things.
 So there's like going after the heart of God, but also tending to your heart.
 And so I feel like Grace Center, like you can feel it when you walk in, that it's peaceful
 and it's gentle and it's a really safe place to be broken, but it's also really safe.
 Goodness.
 I can't get through a question without crying.
 (laughing)
 Oh, I have so many feelings.
 It's a really safe place to be broken,
 but it's also a really safe place to rise.
 I think it's just so accepting.
 And I remember coming and seeing people
 that I didn't know that were just wild and worship.
 And it's easy to have judgment about that.
 But then you let yourself be a little bit wild and worship.
 And then you find out that there's something
 God has been calling you to, that you didn't know.
 So it's just this incredible place where people are abandoned to the Lord and it's sometimes
 it's a little bit crazy, but it's also so safe.
 And I think in large part, that's because of Jeff and Becky.
 And because the school is part of Gray Center, everything that Jeff and Becky have worked
 their lives for and everything they've given for the Lord and everything they've done to
 Stewart Gray Center, the school has been like imparted with as well.
 So when I look at the leadership from Jeff and Becky
 to you and Alan, Tony, Christine, everybody,
 you just see this leadership staff
 that is also abandoned to the Lord
 who has put in the years of sacrificing for him
 and you just feel so safe.
 And they model that.
 I feel like I've seen every single leader get up
 at some point and share a very real part of their hearts
 or cry and not be afraid to do that.
 And it sets a standard and it makes you feel closer to God
 and it makes you feel like it's okay to be who you are too.
  </li><li>Okay, so the next question is,
 so what do you think were the major things
 that contributed to your change?
  </li><li>I think the first thing that comes to mind
 is just saying yes to the Lord,
 was what began all of the change.
 And even when, 'cause I did first year,
 And then there was a year off and between, which was like hell year for me.
 I still need so much more.
 Like I was, I had a hard time.
 I mean, just to be really honest, like there were so many thick places of
 disappointment and pain in my heart that even being submerged once into all of the
 truth, I needed a proper dunking again.
 Like I like that.
 A proper dunking.
 Good.
 Um, so what I learned though was that if I was able to continue saying yes to the Lord,
 even though my circumstances or what felt true about life didn't match what he was saying,
 that if I continued just to say yes, and to hold on to the glimmer of what seemed like
 would be his truth for my life, that that brought about, oh my gosh, it was like an
 iceberg of change. And it's crazy that there's so much on the other side of your yes to him.
 Yeah. It's wild. Yeah. Well, I think ultimately, the thing that transformed me the most was the
 presence of God. And I think that is something that Gray Center is definitely not lacking in
 is the presence of God is just there. It is. It's just there. It's like I've encountered the
 the presence of God other places, but not quite like I've encountered a gray center.
 I think it's the presence paired with the teachings, paired with community, paired with
 being a part of the church and exercising the very things that you've learned that is what
 creates the atmosphere with this transformation.
 My first thought was just hunger, but it is kind of what you already said, that there
 is an element you will get out of it what you put in because there is a lot of truth
 to something that Charlene would always say to me that first year.
 She's like, "All right, Elena, if you want to see this happen or you want to see whatever
 happen you need to just start moving because the Lord can't drive like a parked car, like
 you have to decide to put into gear."
 So there's like an element of partnering with the Lord that is really important.
 And I think for most of us at the point that we decided to do the school, we were just
 desperate enough to let him have everything because maybe things weren't working.
 So how I was doing my life wasn't working for me.
 So you get to a point where you can recognize your own limitations enough to let him start
 telling you who you really are and start believing him.
 So I think learning to trust God and believe what he said about me was a really big part
 of it.
 But after hunger, I think it was being in safe relationship, which for me, I didn't have
 a lot of, I didn't have a lot of safe family relationship.
 I actually didn't have many friends and any family members that were Christians.
 So having safe leadership changes everything, having a small group leader that received
 me of grace.
 I remember going to my small group leader and just being so ashamed if I didn't finish
 my homework and all this performance stuff would come up for me and she'd always just
 received me of such love and just hugged me and instead of, you know, addressing the,
 well, you know, you're in school and so there's agreements of homework, you have to get it
 done.
 just like deal with the heart. And so I think that in the school, you're with a lot of people
 like that where it's safe and it's about your heart. It's not about your performance or what
 you can earn. And that was really big for me. So having you and Alan or two of the safest
 people I know, but also people that are so knowledgeable about the Lord and the headway,
 but also in a hard way. And I still to this day, if you guys tell me anything, I'm going
 to take it. Like I don't, not in a unhealthy way where I will, you know, blindly follow
 someone, but I know that I can trust you. Yeah. But I trust that I trust the walks that you
 guys have led. You live the lives that you preach. And so every day I would sit on the
 front row and just be eating up everything you had to say because I could see the fruit
 in your life and I could see the kind of people you were. And I knew that I could trust you,
 which I think is a big deal for a lot of us because you've been hurt or I hadn't even
 grown up in church, I'd only heard of a God that seemed kind of mean.
 So to be in a community with leaders that were so safe and saw such eyes of love
 and would reflect back to you how God saw you was a really, really big deal.
 Great answer.
 I think a big thing about physically being present for me was being part of a small
 group and in being in a small group, you have a small group leader who has
 permission to call you on your stuff.
 And so if I was doing the school online, for example, I mean, you could probably have an online small group, but you wouldn't have someone who's necessarily witnessing your behavior and seeing different things maybe come to the surface, which, you know, need to be dealt with.
 And it's not that they, it's not that they interfere in your life, you know, your small group leader, but they do have by implicitly they have your permission to speak into your life.
 And so therefore when, you know, they will see you in ministry, they will see you working
 out how you do prophetic ministry, how you do prayer ministry at the front.
 They will see all that happen and they will be able to sometimes take you aside and have
 a conversation like, Hey, I've just noticed this thing.
 And that, you know, there's little things like that just cropped up through the
 year where, you know, my character got improved and I got more inner healing because
 of things that other people had witnessed in me and called me on.
 That's so amazing.
 The power of confrontation, we've been done the confrontation, is big, bad, scary.
 If you're being confronted, it means you've done something wrong and you're a bad boy.
 You're a naughty girl.
 But actually confrontation is one of the kindest things when it's done well.
 Absolutely.
 And it's one of the things we empower our leaders to do, hopefully very well, you know, with
 tremendous tact and grace.
 But I think you're right.
 I remember Danny Silk saying, if you have a culture of honor, without a culture of confrontation,
 you really have a culture of flattery.
 If I just tell you that you're awesome, but never help you fix the short fallings
 You're actually served. That's amazing. I think for me why the change took place would probably be because I think
 God always honors sacrifice. Yeah, and so for me it was a big sacrifice to do the school
 it was it it meant leaving a job that I held for seven years and
 You know, it's an investment. It's money. It's time and
 So it was a bit of a sacrifice, but God always honors that.
 And I feel like the enemy deals in that currency
 of like something's gonna be wasted.
 Don't do it 'cause you'll waste your,
 whatever, fill in the blank.
 But realizing that, well, that's just a lie of the enemy,
 that it's a waste of time or a waste of,
 but realizing God always honors sacrifice.
 And his yes towards B is always far larger than my yes
 towards him.
 For me, it was a daily choice that said,
 I quit my job for this.
 I'm investing money in this.
 I've given a verbal commitment to do this,
 and I'm gonna get my money's worth.
 I hate to say-- - Just on a my--
  </li><li>Just on a basic level.
 And I thought I didn't spend this money
 and quit my job to be the punk rock kid
 that sits on the back row with her arms crossed,
 being cynical, skeptical.
 I don't know if I believe that.
 I don't know if I've heard that before.
 Where's that in the Bible?
 I thought that's not what I'm in for.
 But I'm in to say yes, and I'm going to wrestle through this, like Jacob wrestled with God and just say, God, I want to wrestle through this stuff with you.
 Some of this is brand new to me. Some of it I've heard before, but I'm going to like juice it, if you will, like I'm going to juice it for all its worth because I want the nutrients, the spiritual nutrients of what this school has.
 So I hate to say it. I think it's really a lot on the part of the individual. God's yes is already there.
 But when we daily say, "All right, yeah, it's 8 a.m. Monday morning and I really don't feel like going,
 no, I'm going anyways because I didn't quit my job to sleep in."
 Like, "Right, I quit my job because I wanted more."
 I agree.
 100%.
 I would not trade what we gave up for what we now have.
 Amazing.
 Well, this might be evident from all of your previous answers, but the final question would be,
 what would you say to someone who's thinking about doing the school?
 I would say what you gain doing the school is incomparable to what you're giving up.
 It's hard to see that on the front end, but it's coming from someone who's now on the
 back end of the journey.
 And I would also say there is nothing, there's no greater investment of your time and your
 money than to discover who God says you are, who you are, what he thinks about you and
 what it is your destined to do.
 Because otherwise, gosh, you could spend your whole life never knowing any of those things.
 Thinking he's an angry father or thinking you're just destined to ameager life with
 getting just getting by and that's absolutely horrifically untrue.
 But you don't know that until you're exposed to it.
 And so do it because what lies ahead of you is greater than probably
 you're you're believing right now.
 Come be exposed to what's available.
 Just come read the menu, come taste some of the food.
 You know what I mean?
 Like it's you you just don't know until you do it.
 And like Quinn said, the sacrifice or something about that, giving it up, moving,
 Giving up jobs, financial security, whatever it takes because it's your future self on the line.
 Yeah.
 So yeah, I mean, I concur with what Adam said.
 I think it came to me one time as just an idea that you feel like you're giving up everything.
 And then once you give up everything, you realize actually it was nothing like it was it because it has the stuff that you give up is of no importance now to you.
 But it has loads of importance to you before you give it up.
 But once you've given it up, it has no power over you.
 It just feels like nothing.
 And I would also say on a practical level, if you're thinking about doing
 the school, just push it some doors, because if you're coming from any
 distance to do the school, there might be any number of practical
 obstacles in your path.
 I would push it the door.
 So for example, I got back from my original holiday in Nashville.
 I got back off the plane.
 I pretty much decided down in there I wanted to come back and do the school.
 But I had a job.
 I didn't know what I was going to do about that.
 I didn't know what I would do about a house that I owned.
 So I went to see my boss.
 I actually sent my boss an email before the weekend knowing that I had a meeting with
 him on a Monday morning.
 I sent him an email and said, "Hey, I had a great time in Nashville and I'd love to go
 back and do the school.
 It would involve me being away for eight months, nine months, whatever it was, is there any
 chance?"
 I'd worked at that point for 16 years at that place for him and worked, I think, well,
 and I think I had some favor with him.
 I did have favor with him, but I went, I didn't, I have no idea how he would respond to that.
 And I honestly wasn't expecting a favorable response from him, but on the Monday morning,
 he called me into his office and we sat down and he said, "Got your email?
 I think it's a great idea."
 Wow.
 And I nearly fell off my chair because I was not expecting that.
 And so that was just one of the ways that Laura went here.
 I'll make it happen.
 Yeah.
 I never felt like I had to come into this school.
 I never felt like it was compulsion.
 This is what you have to do next in your life.
 It was an invitation. That's the best way to put it.
 It was like he brought me over here.
 I had the foretaste, so I got the taste for it.
 And I felt like he said, do you want to do it?
 And I said, yes, I do.
 And then pretty much he made everything happen.
 No, I had to then push out the doors
 and the door started open.
 I'm like, okay, here we go.
  </li><li>Gosh, I feel like so many people say this,
 but it's like even if there's just an inkling
 inside of you to just apply and go for it.
 I remember having a conversation with my best friend Hope
 who she also moved to come to the school.
 And we were just talking about her doing it.
 And she, we were just like,
 what if we just gave God a year?
 What if you just gave it to him?
 What if you just, why not?
 If even you have this tiny thing inside of you,
 and it's been so fruitful and so wonderful,
 I don't think anything could,
 I mean, nothing bad's gonna happen.
 It's only gonna get better.
  </li><li>Right, right, right, right.
  </li><li>Honestly, what I gave up doesn't even come close
 in comparison to what I gained.
 Like from my first experience of being at school
 the first year, I'm seeing waves ripple through my family now.
 I'm seeing my entire family be transformed
 from my risk and yeah, it's totally worth it.
 I think that the Lord is attracted to risk as well.
 I feel like he loves to play chess with us kind of,
 not in like a mean way, but in a kind, I'll let you win way.
 Yeah, do it, totally do it.
 Take the risk, it's worth it.
  </li><li>Yeah, again, I totally agree.
 I look at my life and I see 20, 26 years of living
 that I was doing the best I could.
 But once I reached adulthood and caught a glimpse of what I was actually in,
 the idea of giving eight months to God to see if just maybe he could give me
 something better seems like such a small sacrifice for everything that I've gotten.
 And to think that, I mean, especially at the age I was, I could hear people's
 concerns of, you know, go have a career or I'm an adult, like I don't do school
 or I'm too old or I'm getting married or whatever it is,
 I had job transition and I got married partway
 through my life three years, so I sold journey.
  </li><li>Partway through year two, didn't you?
  </li><li>Yes.
 So I have all these things, but as an adult now
 on the other side, I've seen things happen in my life
 at an accelerated pace that I couldn't have done
 on my own if I tried.
 And for all the years of my life, living in LA,
 living in New York City, pursuing things,
 doing the hustle, like everybody's always talking about,
 I couldn't get for myself what the Lord was able to do
 for me even the first couple months of school.
 And since then I've seen things accelerate
 and I've come to know myself and become healed up
 in a way that I can actually pursue the things
 that the Lord had for me in the first place.
 So doing life with God, he can do things more than you can
 even, that you could muscle up yourself.
 So in the grand scheme of that, when I look at what my life
 is like now, that first year was just such a small sacrifice, even though at the time,
 it felt like a big one because it felt like I was giving all of New York away.
 The career path I thought I had for myself, my family in some respects because I didn't
 know if they would be okay with my decision to become a Christian and almost all of my
 friends, my reputation, everything.
 But it became abundantly clear immediately.
 I never looked back.
 There's never a part of me that was homesick
 or I wanted to change my mind.
 It's just worth it.
 And God can do so much more with that.
 It's like what my was saying.
 He makes good on your investment
 because you're his investment.
 He's invested in me.
 He's not going to let it be a bad investment.
 He's going to compound and he's going to make it
 really wonderful.
 It's just what he does.
  </li><li>Yeah, come on.
  </li><li>I think the way I look at it is in the grand scheme of life,
 if I live to be 80, that would be a pretty healthy life.
 So in the grand scheme of, if I live to be 80, what is eight months?
 It's nothing.
 It's a, it's a blip on the screen.
 Um, so I think before the school, it's easy to go eight months.
 Oh my goodness.
 That's so long.
 It's really not.
 If you take eight months that sets you up for the next 50 to 70 years,
 whatever it looks like of your life.
 Um, and it's an investment beneath the surface of your life.
 I like thinking of it like an iceberg.
 So much of life is that little tip that everyone sees
 and it's the external, but to really take those eight months
 and kind of dive deep to where the real core
 of who you are, the real core of your relationship with God
 and other people may not see it
 and other people may not understand.
 And I did have people that asked,
 well, what are you, school of supernatural, what is it?
 And it was, they didn't get it.
 They're like, what, I don't understand.
 what do you, like they would make jokes and school, you know. And to just realize like it doesn't
 matter what you think of me, it doesn't matter what you think I'm going to do in this next eight
 months. It's actually for me and me and the Lord and like Alan says that self care is not selfish.
 Yeah. And to really say, hey, I'm going to go, I'm going to dive deep beneath the surface,
 get alone with God, get in community, do this school because eight months could set me up for
 the next 80 years. So I would just say do it. I've seen the change in other people before I did
 the school. I've seen the change in my own life, walking through the school, and then now out of
 the school, seeing people that are coming out of it and just graduating a month ago and seeing
 the change in their lives that I knew them before the school, it's the growth, it just gets contagious.
 We're like, oh, wow, look at that.
 They're not the same person.
 You know, so what is it worth to you to give everything over to the Lord and see
 him multiply and give back?
 It's just, it's so worth it.
 It's one of the greatest investments ever.
 I was thinking as well that something that I thought about years ago before I
 decided to become a Christian, but I had one thought that I was like, what if God
 is real and he is like what they're saying he is, wouldn't I want to know? Like wouldn't
 I want to at least try? Because if it's true, that would be everything. And when you do the school,
 something that you guys teach when you're talking about the father heart of God is this idea that
 your understanding of who God is is going to determine everything in your life. And so if there's
 people who are listening to this that are thinking that their Christianity maybe doesn't sound that
 exciting or they're not seeing the things that are in the Bible or they want more from their
 relationship with God, it's so valid because it's supposed to be this passionate adventure and I
 think so many of us don't get to have that. And if there's any part of you that is curious if God
 really is everything that the Bible says he is, a really good way of figuring that out is to take
 take a risk and to immerse yourself in something like this.
 And it's just like, again, it's so worth it.
 It's so worth it to find out
 because of getting like a right understanding of who God is
 and who He says you are,
 that will change your entire life
 and will unlock everything about you.
 So wouldn't you want to try?
 Just risk it just to see because that's what we all did
 and it changed everything.
  </li><li>And for any of the parents out there
 who are thinking, "Why kids and what would I do?"
 And they're not quite school age and that sort of thing.
 Our daughter came in at six months,
 six months and then now we've done two years at the school.
 And so she's literally grown up a year and a half of her life,
 two years, her first years of her life in SSL kids, which has been amazing for
 her to be getting at that young age.
 They teachers giving away what they've learned because all the teachers have
 gone through SSL.
 So we're journeying through it in our mid to late twenties.
 And then our, our daughter is getting it on a sort of one year old level, but,
 but no junior Holy spirit, but just soaking and worship and praying for her
 prophetic words over her and it's like, what a gift for her to spend, you know, two days a week
 for the first two years of her life in that same environment. So even if you have kids,
 it's totally worth it for them to go through it.
 And to clarify, SSL Kids is our child care track. So for the parents who are doing
 SSL, their kids are on site with their parents in another classroom, getting to play with other
 kids and going through a kid's version of the SSL curriculum. And it's amazing.
 It makes it possible for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to do it and we love it.
 Well, guys, girls, thanks so much for spending some of your afternoon just talking about
