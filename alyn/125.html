<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mrs Jones.<br/>
 There is.<br/>
 I'm not doing that podcast with me.<br/>
 You will.<br/>
 Wait, it's them to share.<br/>
 Can you please be normal?<br/>
 OK, sorry.<br/>
 If you're going to be a Star Wars character, at least be Princess
 late.<br/>
 No, it's your turn.<br/>
 Return of the day.<br/>
 You had a rocks.<br/>
 It's fairly late on Sunday night.<br/>
 I'm in my pajamas.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And it feels great in our house, doesn't it?
 Yes.<br/>
 I mean, do you mean like air quality wise or just peacefulness?
 It feels really peaceful and still.<br/>
 It does.<br/>
 I hope wherever you are listening to this, you have an equal sense of peace.
 Of course your peace might be ruined by my wife doing Yula impersonations.
 I'm sure that's not going to be the case.
 I'll just interspersed them throughout the podcast and then that way people will feel
 like it's a normal part of the podcast.
 I'm going to have my editing work.<br/>
 I'll come out for me this evening.<br/>
 So how the heck do you, Mrs. Jones?<br/>
 I feel like I've missed out on large parts of the week with you.
 That's what happens when you fly away.
 Fly away, fly boy.<br/>
 But I came back.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 Tell me about your week.<br/>
 Good week.<br/>
 Taught on Sunship on year two, which is probably one of my new favorite teachings.
 And it seems to be a new favorite teaching from everybody who's heard it.
 Yes.<br/>
 seems to be going over well.<br/>
 I think because it's more encouraging<br/>
 than looking at orphan behavior versus sons behavior.
 It's like stages of maturing.<br/>
 No matter where you're at, it's okay to be where you are.
 And it's okay to talk to God about any place
 you might be stuck in, be able to head forward.
 So I think it's a more positive kind of view of sunset.
 as opposed to our orphans versus sun teaching.
</p><ul>
  <li>Right, 'cause it kind of feels,
 I mean, it can be very black and white.
 You're either orphaning your son
 or you're somewhere in between,
 but it's hard to identify
 if you might be somewhere in between.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So it's a little bit more encouraging.
 And it also, I just think the different stages
 of sunship really helped me as a pastor,
 understand some of what I was seeing
 and people that were getting stuck
 and just being able to identify,
 oh, it's okay, you're just at this stage of sunship.
 And actually I know how to encourage you through that stage of friendship.
 So for me, it actually made a big difference.
 So I think probably that helps as well.
 Cause I have a lot of hope as I'm teaching it.
 And while you were teaching on sunset, I was teaching on practical life skills or how
 to be utterly awesome in everyday life.
 Yes.
 I always get a giggle when I teach on how to handle humans.
 Like here is an instruction manual for other people in your life.
 But you kind of need that.
 Yeah, I do.
 on any given day human behavior.
 I'm using instruction you need.
 Sorry.
 Go ahead.
 Sorry.
 I won't.
 That's a lot of time.
 Maybe.
 You're durable.
 Monday night, I had the challenge handed to me that we were we're on a negative
 fast.
 How's your negativity fast?
 Go and baby.
 Yeah, negativity can fast.
 They suck.
 I think we're so so fast being negative.
 -No. -No feast on it.
 -I'm enjoying it immensely.
 I find I struggle the most when I'm driving.
 -Do you? -Yes.
 -Is that because you have a low tolerance for bad drivers?
 -I do. Very low. Very, very low.
 -Well, that's good. God's teaching you to be gracious.
 -It's bad when MJ says things from the backseat like, "Mummy,
 does he not know what color of green that is?"
 The reason he's saying that is because I will say things like,
 "Are you waiting for a particular shade of green
 where you start going.
 So, yeah, if you're having that much fun, imagine what it was like me speaking on the
 election on Monday night while on a negativity fast.
 Yes, tricky.
 I was supposed to say that I'm negative, but I'm catching myself.
 Look at that.
 Good job.
 And then I flew up to Toronto on Wednesday, Wednesday night, I flew up.
 You did.
 So I thought Thursday and Friday, I flew back Friday night.
 You saw my people?
 I did.
 Well, I saw some of your people.
 Many people were away.
 I know.
 How dare they?
 I know.
 but I do want to say hello to Laura.
 Laura Woodley-Ozman, it was so lovely to see you.
 -And Laura, I love you. -You haven't heard any of Laura's music.
 You're missing out seriously.
 -She's fantastic. -Oh, she's amazing.
 So anointed.
 If you were to look at my iTunes play count, Laura Woodley's CDs would be
 astronomically high. -Yeah.
 -A large portion of the last 10 years of my soaking life has been to Laura Woodley.
 -Yeah. -So I was lovely to see Laura.
 I walked into the middle of a meeting you were having and then stole the person
 meeting with because we could have lunch with Ben and Sarah, but I can't talk about that
 because you'll be mad.
 What were you teaching on?
 I was teaching on boundaries and the poor souls had two days and eight sessions with
 them.
 So, yeah, morning and afternoon on a brand new concept and a brand new way of doing life.
 And I forgot that it's such a multicultural school that there's all these people from,
 you know, English is a second language for many of them, but they did great.
 They, they leaned in and asked great questions.
 So I loved that and then flew home.
 Good.
 You did.
 Oh, did we know good?
 You did.
 You were there.
 Remember you picked me up at midnight, but it took forever.
 You're supposed to find it nine something.
 I know, but we're fine about that because we're
 because we're on a positive mess feast feast.
 Yeah.
 I I loved to staying up until midnight.
 You can't just say that with sarcasm and say, well, I said the words.
 Yeah.
 It was nice to have you.
 Oh, thank you.
 Especially since you got up early on Saturday morning and let me sleep in.
 Well, I had no choice.
 Really?
 Yeah, you kicked me out of bed.
 I did?
 You did.
 Just with your heel.
 This is my...
 Really?
 Yeah, I took that to mean you're the best husband in the world.
 Please get out of bed.
 I adore you.
 And so I thought that's nice words of affirmation in the form of kicks to the small of my back.
 I'll have to try that again next week then.
 I thought it was like Morse code that you were tapping out.
 I love you.
 You are amazing.
 the children. Well, they did. They hadn't seen you in days. So I'm two days. They probably loved it. Three, I think three. Depends how you can. Yeah, if you count days or whatever you're counting.
 But then Saturday we had the emanate picnic in the park, which I have to say was amazing. I'm not one for outdoors, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself. It was fantastic. We played nine in the air. Yeah, I love that game. You didn't play. I know, but I was trying to send
 like I was athletic and sporty for once.
 -Oh, you are.
 We played Nine in the Air, which is apparently the same thing as Four Square or Four on the
 Floor or something like that, but you just kind of volley the ball up in the air.
 -You need to let us say I'll put none of this in the show notes because I don't have a clue
 what you're talking about.
 -In the show notes or you're cutting it out of the actual podcast.
 -I'll leave it in the podcast because I'm sure some people will connect with you.
 -Oh, yeah.
 We know that.
 -Apparently, if you Google Four in the Air.
 No, nine in the air. You'll see it.
 And that was my point.
 Yeah.
 Saturday night, we got to go on the date and we got to see Jack Reacher.
 We did. And I really liked it.
 Jack Reacher, too.
 And I max.
 Yes.
 That screen is enormous.
 I know that's an understatement.
 It was enormous.
 And the sound of people's bones breaking was pretty disturbing.
 It was classic Jack Reacher.
 You know, he's kind of a bad dude.
 Yeah.
 But I like to act the story actually like this one better than the first one.
 Good.
 I just realized I started the podcast in my content later and there's no easy way
 to bridge from being contemplative to being an influencer.
 So excuse me for a second while I leave.
 And now I'm coming back.
 Hey, everybody, what's going on?
 There you go.
 There's my influencer.
 It's up a little bit.
 So if you're listening to this on the way in and you're like, why does Alan sound so
 It's because I'm quite tired, but now I'm completely awake.
 Thanks to my wife's brilliant Yoda impersonations.
 Thank you. You're so welcome.
 I'd forget to ask you.
 Literally, we haven't really talked because since we got back, we hit the floor running.
 So what did you do while I was away in Toronto?
 I had a great day.
 I'm trying to think Wednesday, normal meetings, put kids to bed, watch TV.
 Thursday worked on our presentation that happened this morning.
 Talk about that.
 Talk about what we're doing.
 Well, we're revamping, overhauling, renovating our new children's wing.
 So Gray Center is in an old school building, and we had been renting out part of the building,
 a large portion of the building to a school that
 existed to help kids with learning differences.
 So they moved out in the summer and we got that space back.
 It's an enormous amount of space that's available to renovate.
 And what we're doing is renovating all of it for the children's wings.
 So we're going to have brand new preschool area,
 children's auditorium, grade school area, breakout rooms,
 like just all kinds of craziness.
  </li><li>And it's really exciting because it's,
 I think it's one of the first areas at Grace Center
 where we can be intentional with our scope
 rather than inheriting, you know what we have,
 basically massaging what we want to do
 within the existing confines.
 It's a new chapter at Grace Center.
 I love it.
 I thought you did a great presentation this morning.
  </li><li>Thanks, babe.
 I'm super excited.
 And that was great taking people on a tour of this old building, but good lord, it was,
 it was hard to breathe down that.
 It smells horribly.
 Yeah.
 I mean, it needs renovating.
 It's not, it's not like we can just throw paint on that bad boy and use it.
 I mean, it's something's, it needs significant renovation.
 So the great thing is the structure is great.
 You know, the outside walls and all that kind of stuff.
 So, yeah.
 So we're, we're really excited.
 met with a company called Worlds of Wow this week who kind of
 kidify the space for lack of a better word. They theme
 everything so that it feels like it's designed for children. So
 we're really, really excited about the project. And you love
 it because you get to tap into all your architectural space
 design. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My dad was an architect and I worked
 in his office in the summers and stuff. And I love that. I love
 plans and I can visualize it quite easily and stuff. So I'm loving all of it.
 All right. Our topic for this week.
 I didn't get to tell you about my weekend.
 Okay.
 On Friday, I made blender bread.
 Is that why you just ate?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 It's made from cashews and eggs.
 You know my most bread.
 You can cook on that flour.
 You know my most bread isn't made from nuts and eggs.
 Well, just...
 Unless you want to eat something that tastes like a kitchen sponge, I hope this is
  </li><li>It's just making it.
  </li><li>And let's toast it, kitchen sponge.
  </li><li>So it's crispy and then moist.
 It's like (slurps)
  </li><li>It is, but it's grain free,
 and my stomach doesn't react to it at all.
  </li><li>But it tastes disgusting.
  </li><li>It's not awesome, but it's not too bad.
 I don't mind it.
  </li><li>But I don't want to give myself the eating stuff
 that can be described as, it's not awesome,
 and it's not too bad.
  </li><li>Well, okay, I enjoy it as much as I enjoy anything
 like Azika bread or any of the
 gluten free breads as you can bread is like eating toenails bread yeah well I just love
 it oh wait positivity fast feast yummy toenails and bread yeah what are we going to do about
 this I'm so sorry to negative to pass skip this up we're doing it right it's really
 late at night and we've had a busy week so we're going to we're going to be on it tomorrow
 we're going to be so enthusiastic we're going to be so positive tomorrow it's going to
 eradicate today. That's how it works. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Should we move on to our actual topic
 for this week? Okay, I just wanted to do another. I had a nice couple of days. I'm thrilled,
 baby. That's awesome. I'm glad you had a couple of days. You had girl time? I had lots of girl
 time. Okay, good. Yeah. It was good. Is that why you had your hair all curly when you met
 me at the airport? Yes. I was like, why don't you have time to do your hair? Because my beautiful
 friend, neighbor, Lauren came over and curled my hair for me. Did she happen to leave three
 curling irons behind. No, those are mine. You have three curling irons. No, I don't have
 three curling irons. I have one straightening iron, one small curling iron, and one large
 curling iron. I've been corrected. Thank you. I guess it's like me having a laptop and iPad
 and iPhone. Yeah, you have three devices? Yeah. Yeah. No, that makes sense. I just don't leave
 them all on the kitchen counter. Yes, you have. I guess there's a difference. You've definitely
 left all your devices in the kitchen counter before. You realize I can mute your side of the
 cheating you are.
 Our topic for this week is money.
 Wow.
 I know.
 Well, I was teaching on it a little bit this week and I looked through our index page on
 the website to look at all the episodes because we're now in our 125th episode and I've forgotten
 what we have to talk about and what we haven't.
 Let's face facts.
 We're never going to be able to, oh, that was a negative.
 Let's face facts in all likelihood.
 We are going to revisit topics again, but right now I'm trying to make sure that we're
 not boring people.
 Right.
 But we haven't talked about money.
 I mean, the topic of money has come up, but as a main topic, no.
 Okay.
 We have never.
 Oh, that's exciting.
 So I was thinking there was a bunch of things that we could talk about.
 There's so many wide-ranging things, principles, etc.
 Okay.
 Regarding money.
 But I've narrowed it down to three.
 Excellent.
 for us they've been three that have produced the most fruit in our lives and
 it's nearly ten o'clock at night and also none of them are negative. All right,
 three principles regarding money. I'm gonna say the words and you're gonna
 talk to me about them. Oh yeah because in my show notes it just is three things.
 I haven't actually written anything down. We rarely ever do anyway but so
 first principle I say tithing to you and you say what? I think it's a fantastic
 Look at you and your positivity feast.
 Thank you.
 It's 10% well spent.
 I think it's interesting that as teachers and preachers, we'll cover an awful lot of controversial material.
 Yes.
 But none yields greater pushback in the spirit when we're speaking on it, in my opinion, than
 tithing and maybe women in ministry, but probably tithing predominantly.
 Yeah.
 And I think it's hysterical that we worship and follow an amazingly generous God that we want to be like.
 But it feels like some Christians want to fight over 10%.
 Yeah, it's pretty wild, isn't it?
 I wonder if it's wild because it's not theoretical for us.
 It's something that has been proven in our life to be astonishing.
 Like it's absolutely true that we have found that the 90% goes way further than the 100% could.
 And that's just bad math.
 It doesn't make sense.
 Right. God's good at bad math. Oh, yeah, he always runs up. Yeah. But what's funny is I think in the discussions of I don't know what's at the, I don't know what's at the root of it. Like we'll, we'll.
 Probably fear.
 But that doesn't make sense. You're trusting your life to the Lord. You're trusting your eternity. Your eternity to the Lord. Why would you not trust him with your finances?
 I don't know. I'm trying to think like I mean, I didn't always tithe.
 I didn't start tithing until probably I got pretty serious about the Lord and
 Then I started hearing messages on tithing and I thought huh well, I guess I'll try that
 and started just
 Started tithing 10% right away. I know people that
 You know started trying with 5% to begin with or whatever and
 Totally cool, but I started with 10% because that's what somebody told me to do and in that one year
 I think I got promoted eight times at work. I was like, okay. Well, there you go
 But that was you know that was years and years and years ago
 And I think it's not even in our heads that that 10% would ever get touched by us
 I think cancer been my sister or brother-in-law
 We were at the church or they said it to us or they tweeted out
 Well, I thought it was a brilliant line that you don't give a tithe to God.
 You return a tithe.
 It's already his.
 You can't give something to somebody when it already belongs to them.
 So you're right.
 We've never considered that 10% hours to begin with.
 It's the thing that comes off the top.
 I wonder if in response to my earlier, I can't understand why
 Christians have a problem with tithing.
 It's probably, I would imagine, mostly to do with the delivery that they've heard it.
 Like I've heard some shocking, shockingly bad.
 Oh, you're so a vine, which is hugely abusive and doesn't serve scripture very well or hugely
 manipulative.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And so maybe the maybe the apprehension is from the control and manipulation that's
 been said.
 Yeah.
 It's possible.
 I so tithing, if you're not familiar with it, is giving the first 10% of everything
 you make and giving it to the Lord.
 In my understanding, it's giving it to your local church, where you get fed.
 Yes.
 I don't think it's for giving away to other.
 Parachurch organizations.
 I think it goes directly where you eat your local church, where you get fed is.
 Yeah.
 I mean, you can give extra away to parachurch and whatever, but we'll talk about that in a second.
 Um, I think, babe, like when you think about, I do think it's fear, um, that keeps a lot
 of people from tithing.
 And I think it's fear that they won't have enough.
 And I think that stems from actually just not knowing
 how good God is or how big he is
 or how faithful he is or what a good dad he is.
 'Cause if you don't know any of those things,
 then you're kind of in it on your own
 and giving away 10% of your salary seems like insanity.
  </li><li>All right, I backtrack my intense reaction.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And given I'm on an activity fast,
 I make another mark and my checkbook for...
  </li><li>I think for me, it's just a funny thing
 because it's always been clear for me in scripture.
 And more than that, it is produced incredible dividends
 in my life, not that that's what it's about,
 but honestly, it's just obedience to the Lord.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I love it.
 Do you know who really impresses me and fascinates me?
  </li><li>Who?
  </li><li>Is Rick Warren. - Okay.
  </li><li>So Rick Warren writes "The Purpose-Driven Life."
 I think I'm accurate in saying this,
 it's the most published book or most sold copies apart from the Bible, which is astonishing.
 And I was watching an interview with him. I'll try and put Link in the show note to it.
 I think it was an interview with John Piper, where he was talking about what happens when you write
 the most published book in the world except for the Bible. And he said, it's just tens of millions
 of dollars begin flowing through your hands. And he said, yeah, two things happen. He said,
 you become insanely wealthy and then you have incredible influence. And he said, I was actually
 more scared about dishonoring the Lord through the misuse of influence than I was about the
 misuse of finances. And he said, in part, because before I ever had millions of dollars flowing through
 my hands, a long time ago, I settled this issue with the Lord, but the grace of God had never
 been an issue I'd struggled with. And he said, my wife and I have never, I think he said never
 given less than 20% in our whole life. I think that's why 12%. It was something like that.
 It was above the 10%. He said, "We just started out 10 and just worked up and we've never given
 below 20%. I think again I'm correct." Anyway, the point was he's just been tithing and then some.
 So when the money came, it wasn't an idol to him. He just spent on behalf of people who had no
 influences what he said. I loved that. I thought, "Wouldn't it be great to get to the point where
 money has no control over you. And what I love about tithing is every month, we get to punch fear in the throat.
 Yeah.
 We get to really practically step out in faith and go, okay, yes, we could do with that money.
 We could see how that money could be used to help our family or pay off debt or be put into savings or whatever.
 Right.
 But we get to just pre-decide, "No, our confidence and our faith is in God, there you go, God."
 And I love that. I love that real feeling about tithing.
 Me too.
 What do you think about people who say, "I've tried tithing and it doesn't work"?
 I mean, what do I think about them?
 No, I think what... I mean that...
 I don't know. I guess it would... How do you try for it? I don't understand trying it anyway,
 Because in my mind, it's just an act of obedience.
 It's something that the Lord is, you know, it's mandated in Scripture.
 It's in both the Old Testament and the New Testament.
 It predates the Old Covenant.
 It's not part of that.
 I've heard that argument, but it's not actually part of the Old Covenant.
 And, you know, Jesus even talked about it.
 Didn't say stop doing it.
 You know, so it is New Testament as well.
 and I just think it's wisdom to do it.
 And my thought is, really anything in life,
 if you just give it a try,
 there's probably a limited success rate
 on trying anything.
  </li><li>I tried going to gym and I didn't get a six pack.
  </li><li>Right.
 So you got to go into anything
 like you're going in for the long haul.
  </li><li>Well, it's the whole thing of,
 I tried typing it didn't work.
 I was like, no, you gave 10% a few times.
 that's different from the lifestyle of giving.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Anyway, I realize I'm sounding quite sharp
 and like I have an edge and I totally don't mean to.
 So I apologize if that's the way it's coming across.
 I'd rather be encouraging rather than snorke
 and I fear I'm being a bit snorke.
 So if that's the case, I absolutely apologize for that.
  </li><li>It's probably for my cashew bread, sorry babe.
  </li><li>Yeah, sorry.
 I just ate a toasted sponge.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>And that was a little grumpy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Mm, is this fermented kitchen sponge?
 (laughing)
 One of the nuts and eggs, you say, never told.
 So tithing, tithing is a no-brainer.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Love tithing, a huge fan of tithing.
 Let's talk about the second principle, giving.
 You know what I used to think?
 I like I've tithed as long as I can remember really.
 I mean, that's not strictly true,
 but my tithing predates anything of sincerity
 with the Lord really, because I was taught that.
 But once I gave the Lord the 10%,
 I was so stingy with a 90%, it was ridiculous.
 I was like, you have your 10%,
 don't you dare ask for my 90%.
 And I could just be icy cold when offerings came up
 because I just thought, nope, this is my 9%,
 I've already given my 10%.
  </li><li>It's my mommy.
  </li><li>Yeah, and that stinginess,
 that fear, I think it is, fear of lack,
 fear of not having enough.
 And I, of the many miracles God's done in my life,
 I think one of the things I'm most grateful for
 is the Lord lavishing me with his kindness and in doing so teaching me that when I am,
 when I give I'm most like my father. And so I have loved, I love that we have part of our budget
 set aside to give on top of our tithe. Now, like anything we talk about in the podcast,
 I struggle with the fact that we're being vulnerable because I'd hate for this to be about us,
 Not that I actually know what I'm going to stop apologizing.
 Nobody's making a listen to this podcast.
 You do each week, so you probably don't care.
 So I love that we have a giving budget.
 Yeah. On top of a tithing budget.
 And I think your gifts, once the tithe has been given to your local church,
 I think your gifts get to go wherever you want.
 And what would you say the ratio is of when the Holy Spirit tells us to give
 or directs or giving verses when we just want to give?
 Oh gosh, I don't know.
 I don't think I've ever really thought about it.
 I mean, so some things are just giving in small ways.
 Like if we see anybody who's in the armed forces
 or police or firemen or whatever,
 if we can buy their food or buy their, you know,
 whatever, that's just, you know, just generosity
 being generous people.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Just super fun, but you know,
 I suppose that's termed as giving.
  </li><li>Right.
 But then we also have like scheduled things that we give to.
 Right.
 I just think back in my days when I wouldn't give unless the Holy
 Spirit prompted me to give.
 Right.
 Now, like, for example, we have what dates are offering coming.
 Oh, on November 20th.
 OK, so now November 20th, we're going to be taking up a one time offering
 to bring in all the money we need to do our children's ministry, somewhere
 in the region of half a million dollars.
 Yes.
 And I already am so excited about giving.
 So I'm, I'm, what, what happens is I usually get so excited
 about giving that I need to be, it takes a while for me to be
 talked out of what I want to do.
 So like I leaned over to you this weekend and with wild, crazy,
 I was like, babe, this is what I want to give to this.
 And you're like, let's talk about that, shall we?
 And I'm actually fine with what you want to give to you.
 You are. Yeah.
 Okay, great.
 between the two of us, we don't need both kidneys.
 Right.
 Right.
 But like what I find is this, this percolating joy in my heart about the thought of getting to give and this, this delight.
 And I heard, I forget who told me this, but I loved it.
 I was teaching on it this week about your ties protects your finances, but you're giving determines your increase increase.
 And I love that.
 And we've found that to be true.
 like, because I'm a nerd, I actually charted our giving, not our tithing.
 So take the tithe off the table.
 The tithe just happens anyway.
 Right.
 But one year I just, I kept track of what we gave.
 And then another column and a spreadsheet, I kept track of what we received.
 Right.
 And some of that is monetary and some of it is, uh, other.
 Oh, yes.
 Like upgrades and gifts surprises.
 And I think I averaged that.
 I think it was something like a 1400% return on quote unquote investment.
 I'm pretty sure you can't get that in the banking world.
 I have just seen time and time again that the proportion that we are moved in our
 hearts to give results in, in unexpected blessings.
 And it's hard to teach teaching about giving because you end up talking about
 receiving.
 And that isn't the point that the joy is in the giving, the receiving of blessing
 feels like astonishment.
 Right. And I don't want to get caught in the, well, I'm giving to get. I want to give because I feel like my father when I give.
 Yeah, it's fun. I think too, like when you think about, you're talking about returning the tie, then that giving is what provides the increase.
 That I mean, that's Malachi right there, isn't it?
 Or Malachi if you're Italian.
 Right. The Italian prophet, Malachi.
 You know, where it's just talking about returning the tithe to the Lord, but it also talks about,
 you know, if giving opens the storehouses of heaven where the tithe protects your money.
 Right.
 So, you know, you give 10 percent that protects your finances, it protects your,
 your life as it were financially. But then giving extras what actually opens the floodgates
 of heaven. So it seems like when there's stuff like that written, it's worth taking it out for a
 test drive. Well, especially when it's like task mean this. So when you have an opportunity
 to deliberately task God in something, his invitation, buckle up, bar a cup.
 I mean, I mean, seriously, what do you think?
 Here's something that we've noticed in our life is there's like we,
 we budge it into our giving, giving.
 But then there's another type of giving, which is sacrificial giving.
 Yeah.
 I realize that still deep breath moment in my life.
 It's it doesn't.
 I don't think it's an alley, but there's moments where I'm like,
 "Oh, right, we're gonna go for this, are we?"
 And I quite like that moment in the same way that I would imagine cliff jumpers like the
 moment when they're at the top of a really scary cliff and thinking, "I'm sure I'm going
 to like this when I survive this, but right now I'm adrenaline pumping."
 Right.
 And I think the cool thing is we've never not found God faithful in those moments, but
 always it's usually if it's a sacrificial giving, it's going to cost you.
 You're right. Those moments are a little bit like, "Oh, okay, God."
 But what's good is usually, I can't think of a time when we haven't ended up
 with the same number to give when it's been the big sacrificial ones where
 it's like, "Okay, give me two."
 I have to say that is one of the big benefits of being married.
 No kidding.
 I mean, there's obvious benefits of both.
 But one of the great joys for me is when I was on my own, I just thought I wasn't confident
 that what I was giving was smart or wise or I don't know.
 So I like it now when we have an opportunity to give, when I look in and go, what did you
 get?
 And you're like, what did you get?
 And we more often than not come up the same number.
 when we don't, what do we tend to do when we don't?
 Do we give the bigger one?
 Or we meet in the middle?
 Yeah.
 If one of us is completely out of touch
 with our financial situation.
 Like, babe, we don't actually have that.
 We don't have $10 million to give, but you're adorable.
 Well, so first two principles then,
 that we've lived by is tithing and is giving.
 Can I just tell you one other thing
 that I think is really cool about the whole giving thing?
 We have some friends who they really feel like,
 at some point in their lives, the Lord is going to allow them
 to pay off people's mortgages.
  </li><li>Oh, I love this story.
  </li><li>And so they're like, you know, at this point,
 that's not something we can do,
 but what we could do is make a mortgage payment for someone
 which would be heading in the direction of what we wanna do.
  </li><li>I love that.
  </li><li>And so, you know, this is a young couple,
 they're not loaded for bear,
 they're just sort of going, you know,
 we wanna be faithful to just head in the direction
 that we feel like the Lord is gonna call us
 to walk faithfully in.
 So I love that stuff too.
  </li><li>Yeah, I love that there's someone where they want to go.
 Do you want to talk about the time,
 because I was telling this this week,
 and I don't think people believe us.
 I think people think, oh, I don't know what people think,
 but I love the day that we decided.
 I forgot who challenged us,
 but the day we decided to give 11% instead of 10.
 And do you remember that story?
  </li><li>I don't.
  </li><li>Okay, we'll see if I can jog your memory.
 It was a sandy night, we were out on a date, and at that point, our budget didn't allow
 us to do nice things for dates.
 So what we would do for a date is we would go to Starbucks and get a coffee, and then
 we would wander around Bed Bath and Beyond or Target or whatever, and just look at things
 that we couldn't afford to buy.
 And so we'd wander around that.
 And that particular night, we'd been looking at drapes, and we'd been looking at bar stools
 because we were doing some bar stools.
 And we'd been in Costco and we were dreaming about getting a large trampoline for the kids.
 Do you remember that?
 I do and it's a kind of a bittersweet thing because one allows your heart to dream, but then you're also looking price tag for money
 You don't have money buy this and so no problem no problem at all
 and so we go home and I
 Forget what it was I heard a test money or heard something anyway
 We end up being challenged to give 11% yeah, and I say challenged
 I don't mean the Holy Spirit come and say the game I said give 11%
 I just mean we were inspired by other stories of people so we were like right
 We're going to start writing 11% tithe checks instead of 10%.
 Yeah.
 And the first one we did.
 Now, it's funny because 1% of the 10% you're giving isn't that much.
 No, but it feels like a lot.
 Well, yes.
 So we started and then our neighbors stopped by and say hello.
 Now, what was interesting about these neighbors is I think without any sense of exaggeration,
 we met them once when they moved in.
 We took them bags of groceries to say welcome to the neighborhood.
 Yes.
 and then literally never saw them again.
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>For about two, two and a half years.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And this is the second time we see them.
 They knock on our door.
 We don't even know who they are.
 They have to explain, oh, we're neighbors.
 And their opening question is,
 you guys don't need a trampoline, do you?
 And we're like, what?
 And they're like, well, we have one of those big round
 trampolines with a big net.
 And we're moving house and we don't want to bring it.
 And we just thought we could roll over to your house.
 It's that's what you would like.
 And we're like, yes, very much so.
 So we go over to their house and they're taking us through their house into the back garden.
 And as we're there, they're like, hey, you don't want any barstools, do you?
 And they just said, yeah, we're not taking them either.
 And then so we go out and we look at the trampoline, we're like, oh, that's amazing.
 And she's like, you know, actually we're leaving.
 So do you need like drapes, curtains, and.
  </li><li>Adio furniture. - Adio furniture.
 That's right. They gave us. - They gave us so much stuff.
  </li><li>And in the space of one afternoon, we ended up with all the stuff, including the sofas that live
 upstairs in our in our bonus room, which I think we bought for like a hundred and fifty bucks.
 That was the only thing we paid for everything else. We got given free. And I was like, Lord,
 that is spooky. Like that 1%. And this is the revelation. Lord, give me Alan. You give what
 you do have, you get what you could never have afforded. And that has been consistent. That has
 proven true over and over and over and over again. So anyway, if you're not tithing, I'd really
 encourage you to tithe. Go listen to some great teaching about tithing. If you are tithing,
 I'd encourage you to give and don't wait for the Holy Spirit to lead you in to give
 but start by being spontaneous and see what that takes you.
 Spontaneous and generous and see what happens.
 The third thing is producing money. That's a revelation the Lord started giving us.
 Because we started saying to the Lord Lord we we did not get into ministry for money.
 But we realize for the things that we would like to do for our kids, we would like to have
 more income than we currently have. We don't want to be a drain on the church. We have no
 expectation that the church is responsible for meeting our lifestyle. We believe that God is going
 to. And so one day I just started asking the Lord Lord can you help me because if I'm honest my
 My heart was feeling bad that I wanted more money.
 What do you think about that?
 Well, I mean...
 Because that verse description says, "You know, I've learned to be a base, I've learned
 to have margin, but I've learned the secret of being content."
 I think the only things that I find hard is when you realize you can't do things, some
 things for the kids.
 Like, those are the places where I realize, "Oh, my heart feels sad about that and I want
 to do something to enhance our finances so that we can do some extra things for the kids.
 Right, because I look down the line, I think about school, and I think about all that sort
 of stuff. The other thing is, I think about when you and I were dating, John and Carol
 basically funded my life for a year. And I wouldn't have had the experiences I had if
 they hadn't had enough money to fund my life. So there are a bunch of people in our lives
 that I would love to help fund their dreams and currently cannot. And I'm like, I would love to
 be in that position. That's something I would love to do. And so in the measure that we do have,
 we're aiming towards that. We're showing where we want to go. But nevertheless, I settled in my
 heart that I would actually like more money and I think I'm okay with that and I'm happy
 to be challenged on that.
 And to my great surprise, the law was like, oh, I'd love to give you more money.
 And I was like, oh, you would.
 And the law was like, yeah, I actually give you the power to get wealth.
 So I was like, okay, Lord, well, that's interesting.
 How I know that you give me the power to get wealth.
 How does that work?
 And this is what the Lord said.
 The Lord said, "Put something in my hand to multiply."
 Wow.
 And so that goes in hands with, I think one of the reasons, one of the ways that you produce
 wealth is you become generous, you give what you do have you get what you could never have
 afforded.
 So if you think about our lifestyle, large parts of our lifestyle are funded by the Lord,
 not by our paycheck.
 Yes.
 And that's amazing to me.
  </li><li>It is amazing.
  </li><li>But the other thing is,
 if we put ideas in the Lord's hand,
 he generates wealth out of that.
 So we've got friends who are artists or musicians
 or podcast editors or writers or any of those things.
 And I love watching them get commercial success
 as much as I do,
 watching them get critical success.
 So I see people start businesses
 or I see people think,
 "I'm going to try being this."
 and I watch them take a step out and the Lord bless them on that and financially reward them as they go to work on that.
 So I've loved, for example, watching you decide, I'm going to write books.
 I've never written books before.
 I don't even know how that works.
 I don't know how it would get published.
 And I'm watching as you step forward, the Lord meets you and multiplies blessing and us producing teaching material and us, you know, traveling and just saying,
 Okay, Lord, would you give us opportunity to speak and go places?
 You know, our gifts are teaching.
 I'm not good at dancing.
 I'm not good at it.
 You know, it's not like I can do stop.
 Yeah.
 Great at dancing.
 I am great at dancing, but it's only for you.
 It's not like I can do dancing lessons.
 Okay, guys, I'm going to take an ad out creepy dance lessons offered by
 uncoordinated alum.
 You're not a creepy dancer or an uncoordinated limp.
 Babe, on our honeymoon.
 Yes.
 We called it the sexy dance, but it really was the creepy dance.
 Yes, and you did manage to remove your big toenail while doing it.
 And I also managed to cover you in hot candle wax.
 That's true.
 So generally speaking, the sexy dance has not been that sexy.
 I'm not talking about that dance.
 I'm just talking about if we go to a wedding or whatever, you can actually dance.
 It's not like your white boy can't dance.
 No, no, I am most definitely the white boy who can dance.
 No, I disagree.
 I know.
 I've seen the white men that can't dance and you're not him.
 No, no.
 Inside my head, any time I'm dancing a wedding, which is why I never is I'm like, what are you doing?
 What are you doing?
 Stop it right now.
 This is ridiculous.
 Like inside your head, you're doing the white man overbite.
 Well, no, inside my head, I'm thinking, I'm just going to pass out.
 That's what I'll do.
 I'll pretend I'm an archalaptic and I've just fallen asleep on the floor.
 Collapse, pretend I'm asleep.
 I don't know.
 Yeah.
 OK, I didn't know that was going on, but you're not a bad dancer.
 No.
 Well, you're going to have to trust me.
 I don't know in that area.
 I think that's your one area of confusion.
 -Now, you're sexy.
 -Well, yeah.
 -Okay.
 -Okay, well, suddenly we've moved into our rated territory.
 Anyway, my point in all of this is...
 -Yes, you will.
 -Oh, my gosh.
 -Okay.
 -Get out your system.
 -Okay.
 -Anything else?
 -It leads to anger.
 Anger leads to hate.
 Hate leads to suffering.
 -You're the one on an activity.
 -Oh, I'm sorry.
 -I'm the one on anger for fear or hate.
 Sorry.
 So my encouragement is put something in God's hand to multiply.
 Yes.
 Even if the stuff that you're thinking, man, I should list out on Craigslist.
 You don't get money by thinking you should list stuff on Craigslist.
 You do get money by listing on Craigslist.
 Right.
 Martin Smith of Delirious Fame.
 I read an interview with him and he said, it's funny.
 Britain and America has two different thoughts regarding money in Christian circles.
 He said, "In America, it seems like wealth is seen as a sign of blessing from God."
 Right.
 Whereas in Britain, wealth makes you feel like you're grubby and sinful.
 Oh, wow.
 And I thought, I mean, I haven't been in Britain for so many years to know if that's true,
 but I realize I've grown up with some sort of grubby, like I'm more familiar with the verses and scripture
 about the love of money is the root of all evil.
 Right.
 than I am about God's abundance and blessing. And I realized God's had to work over time on the
 shyness in my heart regarding money. Oh, wow. That's a good realization. Yeah. Yeah. All right.
 Anything else you want to say about tithing, giving or producing? Yeah. I think it would be
 just good if we prayed for our listeners today. Okay. Okay. Are you going to do that or would
 you like me to? Well, you can do it. No, you pray in a yoga voice and see if God answers you.
 Really? No. That was gonna be fun.
 Lord, thank you that you're amazing, that you are wonderful.
 You're a wonderful dad.
 You're a fantastic provider.
 And Lord, that we don't need to worry about anything at all,
 because you were on the throne and you know what's going on in each one of our lives.
 And Lord, I ask that for anybody that's just entering into the journey of learning to
 tithe, Father, that you would meet them in the midst of that.
 And you would remove every stronghold of fear and help them to just press into knowing the
 blessings that come with obedience.
 Lord, and Father, I ask for all of us that you would give us stuff to give away, that
 you would move on our hearts when you want us to give.
 that you would show us things that we can be generous towards.
 And Lord, that you would help us with ideas and inventions
 and songs and things that produce
 so that we can be representing your kingdom
 wherever we are and be generous people.
  </li><li>Amen.
  </li><li>Amen.
  </li><li>All right, do I have a listeners question for you
 that dovetail's perfectly with what we've just been talking about?
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
  </li><li>So this is from Hannah and Hannah wrote in
 She said, "Hello!" I listened to her podcast regularly. Thank you.
 "And visit M&amp;H sometimes when I come to visit my brother and I hear you talk all the time about
 how God is going to bless me with abundance when I expect and believe that he will do so."
 And she wrote, paraphrased, obviously. "I have a hard time understanding how God wants to bless me,
 a middle-class white privileged American, while there are so many people in the world who experience
 homelessness, poverty, oppression, etc. How can I justify and accept my blessings when
 so many others go without? In summary, I have a difficult time believing that those people
 suffering just aren't being positive enough to receive God's blessing or don't have
 enough faith. Do I have a faulty understanding of abundance and blessing?
 It's a great question, Hannah, and I'm glad that you asked it. I don't know if you have
 a faulty understanding of abundance and blessing, I think you might have a faulty interpretation.
 It sounds like some of the stuff that you're asking would be an interpretation of an extension
 of the stuff I've been saying. What it feels like you're saying is, "Oh, because you're saying this,
 then x, y, and z follows." I don't necessarily agree with how you got to where you've got with
 with your questions, but I have thought similar sorts of things.
 So, your answer is probably worthy of a better one than I think I can give, but the way I
 think about blessing is if we abstract it for money, if we take money off the table,
 and let's talk about blessing not in terms of money, which is somewhat ironic given we've
 just talked about money for this whole episode.
 I will say it's the first time on 124 episodes that we have talked about money, so I think
 there's some balance. But if we take money away from him, and if I was to ask you Hannah,
 just this question, does God want to bless his children?
 Even the children who are homeless and in poverty and impression, is it clear from the Bible that
 God actually wants to bless his children? I think nobody would have a problem with saying, yes,
 He absolutely does.
 And if you were just to look at Scripture, for example, Genesis 1, right at the first
 book of the Bible, the first thing God does after creation is to start blessing us.
 It's amazing.
 Number 6, verse 24 is a prayer, "May the Lord bless you and protect you."
 So the problem isn't so much with the fact that God wants to bless us.
 that we become uncomfortable, I think, with the thought of God blessing. It's like it's interesting
 that you say, "I have a hard time understanding how God wants to bless me." That is a very common
 thought. I have a hard time understanding why God wants to bless me. I know on days where I
 behave terribly that I'm astonished that God is so relentlessly kind. King David, who was thoroughly
 blessed by God, had a problem understanding why God wanted to bless him. And he was just like,
 God, you've given me so much and now you're going to give me even more.
 I think part of the journey that we've been on is reconciling our hearts with the fact
 that God wants to bless us and that it's not grubby to agree with that statement.
 And I don't know if it's shame.
 What do you think it is?
 Is it poverty?
 What is it that keeps us feeling uncomfortable with God wanting to bless us?
 might be shame, it might be just general unworthiness.
 Lots of us are taught from,
 if we've grown up in the church
 that basically we're a worm, safe by grace,
 and not quite those words, but you know what I mean?
 And so it feels like to expect God's blessing
 or even hope for God's blessing is maybe a bit much
 'cause after all, you're just a sinner, you're just a worm.
 you know, we're actually God's love for us is so much greater than that.
 Right.
 So I think some of it is actually not actually understanding who God is in the
 first place.
 I was reading earlier in my Bible and I came across some 119 verse 58 says,
 with all my heart, I want your blessings, be merciful as you promised.
 And I, I notice a shift in my heart from, you know, this kind of, not ambivalent,
 But like, I want to be so holy that I don't want to ask for blessing because that somehow
 is, you know, tarnishing to the purity of my, you know, character.
 But then I see in the Psalms, David just said, no, I want your blessing.
 And that coupled with the fact that God does want to bless me has been the mind shift that
 I've had where I'm like, okay, God, you say you want to bless me.
 Blessing isn't bad.
 Therefore, I'm going to look for it and I'm going to ask for it and I'm going to expect
 it.
 And I'm not meaning to say that people who aren't blessed aren't doing the right thing.
 That's not what I'm saying at all.
 And I think it's really prone to error to think that way.
 Like I see that whenever we teach on healing and we'll teach on healing and we'll demonstrate
 healing and we'll make a statement like, God's will to heal.
 And I want you to understand that God wants to heal because if you don't believe that
 God wants to heal, how can we pray with any expectation that God will heal?
 Right.
 And rather than going, yeah, that's great.
 I see that in the Bible, people will go, "Yeah, well, if God did want to heal, why are so many people not healed?"
 And I'm like, "That is faulty reasoning."
 We can't say, we can't question Scripture based on our perceived lack of understanding of what God is doing.
 Right.
 And so I see that all the time.
 And so I see the people who stay stuck like that rarely see people get healed.
 But the people who are like, I don't know the answer to that question, but I do know I'm more confident in the fact that God wants to heal than I am confident in the answer to that question.
 They see tons of healing happen.
 Cool.
 Oh, bless you. You're just super tired, aren't you?
 I am. I realize I'm fading. I have sandy eyes.
 All right. Let me leave you with a final verse. Hebrew 6, 14.
 The Lord says, I will certainly bless you.
 I noticed that we often do a dance when we go for dinner and so hand i want you to imagine that agent i just taking up for dinner we're eating dinner.
 You're in town and we are having some amazing tacos and the bill comes and i grab the bill say no i want to pay for it.
 Are you okay with me paying for the bill or you like no no i can pay my own no no i don't expect you to pick no no no this was no allow me to get it and are you gonna fight or are you gonna be okay with.
 with us buying your dinner.
 See, because the desire is on our site to bless,
 but I find some people don't want to let us pay for dinner.
  </li><li>Yeah, they fight if I... - It's embarrassing for them,
 or they feel awkward.
 And that's the kind of challenge,
 that's the dance that I've had to do with God.
 But in summary, the reason we are blessed is because of who God is.
 It's got nothing to do with us, it's his nature.
  </li><li>Yeah. - But another reason we are blessed
 is so that we can become like him and bless others.
 So we are actually the answer to the question that you you you ask, like, how can I be blessed when all these other people don't have blessing?
 The wrong that I think that's the wrong way of looking at it.
 I think how can I not be blessed by God so that I can help solve those problems?
 Like I think God wants to bless us so that we can be a resource to bless other people.
 Absolutely.
 Bill Johnson, I heard a great sermon.
 He said, "If we don't have a theology of blessing, we condemn the poor to poverty."
 Wow.
 I know.
 It's just the bill being bill.
 So Hannah, I'm sorry, that's a very, very fast treatment.
 It is a brilliant question.
 And I love that you asked and I hope our musings helped you somewhat.
 All right, baby, you're dry, itchy eyes.
 I can see.
 Let's wrap this thing up when we're going to go bad.
 They're sandy eyes.
 What did I say?
 Itchy.
 I would imagine if sanders in your eyes would be quite itchy.
 Well, you know that feeling when you're really tired, it feels like they're standing in your eyes.
 Nope.
 Okay.
