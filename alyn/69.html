<p> Good evening, Mr. Jones.<br/>
 We shouldn't say good evening because some of our listeners listen to this in the morning.
 Good morning, Mr. Jones.<br/>
 We shouldn't say good morning either.<br/>
 Good day, Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Hello, Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 Hi.<br/>
 What are you up to?<br/>
 I'm up to episode 69.<br/>
 What are you up to?<br/>
 Just hanging out with my beautiful babe.
 Oh, thank you.<br/>
 Thank you very much.<br/>
 Come in about this week.<br/>
 Well, this week, the School of Supernatural, I've kicked off.
 And how was that?<br/>
 So good.<br/>
 What was good about it?<br/>
 Lots was good about it. Worship was great. Just having the room full. I mean, we have over a hundred people in that room, which feels great.
 Does really does. Yeah. And I was teaching on here and God's voice.
 You were and you're you updated your slides and they look gorgeous.
 Everybody said that. I updated my slides. I guess I refreshed them with a bit of a lick of paint, but it's the same content.
 No, I know. But they they looked pretty. I liked the red phone.
 Oh, thank you, babe.<br/>
 It's weird getting back in the saddle teaching six times in two days.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I got blessed students.<br/>
 They stayed with me.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And you're teaching this week.<br/>
 I am.<br/>
 I am teaching this week.<br/>
 You can tell that we started back at school because this week we did nothing.
 Yeah.<br/>
 We were complete home bodies all week.
 We didn't go out at all.<br/>
 I didn't even really get groceries.<br/>
 No, that's for I noticed you get because I lived on Doritos and Cheetos,
 which neither are paleo, by the way.<br/>
 No, we're good for you.<br/>
 No, for that matter, but I had the joy set before me.
 You were very gracious and you let me budget some money on a new Nintendo game.
 What is the downside to me having a new Nintendo game?
 You are singularly focused and so the world could be falling apart around you and you may not notice or
 prioritize such things as stinky bums and such.
 But I do finish a level with all three star coins.
 Yes, well, you know, then that's very important to me.
 So that is a negative. Yeah, I do focus on the immediate rather than the important.
 Yes. What do you see as the benefits of me having a new Nintendo game?
 I guess the only benefit I can think of is its wind down time for you.
 That's right. That's pretty much it. And you play with Abby.
 That's good. And the good thing is this game doesn't seem to have bubbles,
 so you don't have to say get in your bubble, get out of your bubble, come in your bubble,
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, get out of your bubble.
  </li><li>I've got to be bad in this field, there are bubbles.
  </li><li>You're gonna burst my bubble, yeah.
 Okay.
  </li><li>Tell me what's going on with your shoulder.
 You went and had prolotherapy.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm, yeah.
  </li><li>I don't even know what prolotherapy is.
  </li><li>It's where they inject dextrose
 and some sort of freezing agent
 into the start and finish of your ligaments
 and muscles that go into your shoulder.
 And what they're trying to do is cause inflammation
 because for some reason, my body is in attacking
 the level of inflammation that I have now.
 Right.
 So they want to induce more inflammation so that it sends off the bat
 signal basically to my body to, Hey, there's something wrong with this shoulder.
 Let's heal it.
 So that's the theory of it.
 And apparently it can take a couple months of doing it, but I did say I'd
 rather do that than surgery.
 Of course, I went to have it done.
 And because freezing doesn't work on me, I just basically got injected between
 35 and 40 times.
 Into your shoulder, ligament and muscle.
 Yeah.
 And you have a pretty high threshold of pain.
 Yeah, this was pretty ridiculous, though.
 I think I'd rather give birth.
 I was just like, are you kidding me?
 Like I said to the doctor, this better be a lost sight,
 because it's like he-there'
 s like six or seven different places
 where he would put the needle in and out
 and in and out and in and out.
 And so I said, I'm done.
 This better be your last sight.
 And he's like, it is.
 I'm like, that's good.
 I'm sure you're a nice guy and everything, but I don't like you right now.
 And so the nurse is like, I don't really blame you.
 And the problem is light a cane doesn't work on you.
 Right.
 It should have, I mean, for anybody else, they, the freezing should help.
 But it didn't.
 No, sir.
 And how is your shoulder three days later?
 Um, it's, it's a lot better today.
 I would say it's sort of back to the pain level now that it was that before I
 I went to have it, but I won't actually know how much movement or restoration has been
 restored probably for a few weeks.
 But do you have more movement today than you did before?
 I think a little bit.
 All right.
 Well, we'll be frank.
 I still can't do my own hair though.
 I noticed to be honest.
 You don't remember doing my hair yesterday.
 It was a fantastic top knot if you want to call that.
 Do you know how the Disney princesses often have woodland creatures come and do their hair makeup?
 Yes.
 Yours is like that except as much woodland creatures as it is like a pigeon and stuff doesn't even
 caught it.
 Am I trying leading out the window just like that maybe?
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
 ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
 ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
 Yes, it's eating your hair.
 It's not my gifting.
 It isn't but I appreciate your effort.
 Oh, thanks, babe.
 Yeah.
 I feel loved.
 Oh, good.
 I don't know how you do it.
 You got so much hair to predict this.
 I know.
 I might cut it off while you sleep.
 I think I might wake up for that.
 Talk to me about your jingle, mania.
 Oh, you tell me.
 Last week, you surprised me and the world by enhancing a jingle competition.
 Well, I have to do these things by surprise.
 Yes, go on.
 Well, we're having.
 We're having a jingle competition.
 So basically we are looking for talented individuals
 who would like to write a jingle for us
 to write something that's between 30 and 45 seconds long.
 And basically the jingle will be played
 at the end of the episodes.
  </li><li>What are you looking for in a jingle babe?
  </li><li>Well, I think we basically want something
 that's sort of happy and upbeat and punchy kind of.
  </li><li>What about beat poetry to really bad jazz?
  </li><li>I know.
 What about hip hop?
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>You'd like a hip hop?
  </li><li>Ooh, no.
 I mean, I don't know.
  </li><li>Have you listened to hip hop?
 Because it doesn't sound like a wobbly swing.
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Dipped, dived, dived, fived, fived, fived, &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Fived, dived, dived, dived, dived, dived, dived, &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
  </li><li>Oh dear God, what is going on?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>No, I'm happy with hip hop.
 If there was a good hip hop one that was turned in.
  </li><li>What about a ragge angle?
  </li><li>Wow, that would be different.
  </li><li>Speed metal.
  </li><li>Can that be happy?
 I haven't heard any happy speed metal but this was the first.
 All right.
 Well, I'm interested to get Brian to write us a screamer one.
 Okay.
 Is that what they call it?
 That kind of music.
 I don't know.
 Okay.
 I'm not done with the kids.
 If you have a jingle prepared, upload it somewhere wherever you'd like tweet at us at
 Alan and AJ and we'll find it and listen to it.
 And hopefully AJ's passionate pursuit of a jingle for our podcast will be over.
 Yes.
 And then you'll come up with a new competition.
 Yeah.
 Competitions are fun.
 If you go to lnaj.com/jingle, you can hear everything AG just said.
 Plus, we talk about prizes, so that's always good.
 Yeah.
 Are you ready for our main topic?
 Yeah.
 Can I tell you something first?
 Yes, please do.
 I'm hungry.
 Okay.
 There's a Snickers bar on your side.
 It's a little bit melted.
 I just wanted you to know I might talk a little bit fast because I'm hungry.
 All right.
 Okay.
 Podcastless since you've been warned.
 I wanted to talk this week about the importance of connection.
 Yeah.
 Now, connection sounds kind of really, really weird, but a healthy relationship, and hopefully
 we're all in healthy relationships, but a healthy relationship is primarily about building
 and protecting the connection between those people in that relationship.
 So for example, you and I were married.
 Yes.
 We've learned over the nearly 11 years of being married, but the most important thing we can
 do is prioritize our connection to one another. And so when when we focus on our connection,
 our relationship is fantastic. Yeah. When we let our connection deteriorate for a variety
 of reasons. Yeah. It's not pretty. Yeah. Tell me if you think this is correct. From all
 the relationships that we've helped, you know, through marriage counseling, that sort of
 I would say the number one cause of the breakdown of the relationship is that the connection
 hasn't been tended to.
 People usually come in pointing at things, but those things are merely the fruit of a
 not tended connection.
 Yeah, or some of those things might be part of the contributing factor, but the underlying
 thing that seems to be the main issue is usually lack of connection.
 Right.
 Danny Silk, who is a relational genius and a pastor at Bethel Church out in Reading, California,
 wrote a fantastic book.
 It's a book that we have our students reading, write a book report on in our school called
 Keep Your Love On.
 And in it, he wrote this.
 I thought this was fantastic.
 Talking about connection, he said, "There's three skills you need to learn to have a healthy
 relationship."
 first skill is understanding that it's my job to control myself and I don't get to control other
 people. Before we even go into the other two, let's talk about how hard it is to control yourself.
 Yeah. I mean, it is hard, especially if you don't feel loved or you don't feel heard,
 that point number one can fly out the window in a heartbeat.
 And there's a fallacy that I'd have a much easier job controlling you than I would controlling me.
 Or if only you would stop doing that.
 If only I could control your behavior,
 then I wouldn't get upset.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Rather than actually taking responsibility
 for why I'm getting upset.
 Or rather than picking a different emotion.
 What are some of the things that you found helpful
 to prevent crazy murdering me when the disconnect is real?
  </li><li>I think usually I have to get away,
 like at least in another room,
 And then process with the Lord and sort of ask myself the question of,
 is what I'm experiencing or what I think I'm experiencing real or imagined,
 is this lineup with,
 do I know how to be what I know him to think and feel on a normal day
 when it's not high stress and a million things going on?
 Is this true to who he is?
 Right. Bill Johnson has this great saying where he says,
 we're our dumbest when we think we know the motives of another person.
 So usually, especially in close-knit relationships,
 it's not the thing that's been done to us
 that hurts the most.
 It's the motivation behind the thing
 that's been done to us.
  </li><li>The imagined motivation.
  </li><li>Right, and that's usually the thing
 that's empowering the hurt.
 So taking a step back and going,
 actually, is this consistent with what I know of my wife
 or know of my spouse?
 And usually the Holy Spirit's like,
 don't believe the lies, don't believe the lies,
 don't believe the lies.
 And it's much easier in, you know, once you're in that state to go, okay, I'm not,
 I'm not coming to the table to explain why you hurt me.
 I'm coming to the table to explain how I got hurt.
 Because usually when I'm coming to the table, say, this is how you hurt me.
 I'm attributing blame and intent on your end rather than owning that I've been hurt.
 And that sounds tiny, but one's super inflammatory.
 The other, if communicated properly, usually provokes that, oh, babe, I'm so sorry.
 I can totally see how that would have hurt you bla bla bla bla.
 Right.
 But still, man, step number one, understanding that we're only responsible for controlling ourselves.
 Good night.
 What is it?
 And James, where it talks about the tongue, the power of the tongue being like a rudder,
 being like a little spark that can set a forest on fire.
 Who is that ever true?
 Number two.
 Yeah.
 Skill number two.
 So if skill number one was, it's my job to control myself.
 I don't get to control other people.
 Skill number two is my number one goal and priority in this relationship is building and protecting connection.
 Yeah.
 And by connection, how do you define connection before we begin?
 Clear lines of communication and just feeling like we're on the same path together with the same goals.
 And both of our love times being super filled.
 Yeah.
 So what builds a connection then?
 I guess there's different things that build it.
 One of the things that's helpful is understanding each other's love languages and how you give and receive love.
 What are the five love languages?
 Touch, quality time, acts of service, gifts, and words of affirmation.
 Right. I think I'm quality touch and physical tongue.
 I'm sure you are, baby.
 I have interest. What's your love languages?
 gifts and quality time.
 Does it help that I'm buying you an iPhone next week?
 Are you?
 That'd be lovely.
 Does Emily want to buy a used iPhone?
 It's gold.
 Mine's going up for sale.
 But yeah, you feel super loved when you get gifts.
 Yeah.
 And when there's quality time.
 Yeah.
 And when there's access service.
 Yes, access service is up there too.
 Yeah.
 I think also like,
 access service wasn't that high before we had kids.
 And then holy mother of pearl please help me i'm drowning over here yeah and i'm just like i realized that you know whether it's you or whether it's like we have some friends that just come over and help us with different things right.
 I feel so loved by that right that i'm just like i mean i'm like love tingful you know it is funny your love language is change over time depending on the season that you're in.
 I wonder too if like, I feel like my quality time one has gone down a bit, but I think that's maybe
 because we don't have a whole lot of time for quality time right now in the season.
 So, you know, I get my quality time by snuggles with MJ on the couch kind of thing and just,
 you know, in bits and starts. So I think, yeah, I think you're right. It does switch around.
 Mine are in all seriousness, words of affirmation and physical touch.
 So I just want you to hug me and tell me I'm amazing.
 Well, you were so cute at church this morning because I started rubbing your
 arm and you like to turn around and keep doing that.
 You know, I'm just like, okay, you would think I just gave you a
 maserati or something.
 I am a touch monster.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 As anybody who's close to me will realize, usually, especially, you know,
 we've got a whole new staff and just because I'm naturally physically
 quite affectionate. I have to check. Oh, wait, are you physical touch or is this
 grouping out and driving you nuts? But you don't want everybody to come up and touch you.
 Oh, heck no. Right. No. So it's, it's,
 did you think that was an invitation for random people to? Well, it might be somebody might go,
 ooh, he really likes touching me and start rubbing his shoulder randomly or whatever.
 Like, please don't do that. That's not really what he's saying.
 I'll show you another side of physical touch.
 That's building connection. What protects that connection?
 Probably not consciously or subconsciously sending disrespect messages or I hate you eyes or
 as we like to call them shortcuts.
 Let's talk about I hate you eyes.
 Yeah.
 How does that work?
 Well, I think for me, anytime that your face doesn't seem particularly animated or happy,
 you may just be in workflow and just look over at me and i'll be like what i do.
 He has eyes of hate eyes of hate or shark eyes right oh great is that because your eyes are brown is that because you're talking to me while i'm playing a video game because that could be the issue.
 I'm not allowed to talk what you play video game that is the last video game you get to buy enjoy it darling.
 Now that you can't talk, it's going to be hard for me to give you an emotive response.
 Anything more than a monosabilic grunt.
 As well as understanding what fails a love tank, it's really important to understand the disrespect
 messages. I think I can receive a disrespect message by you not helping me as quick as I'd like you to.
 That's a real deal right there.
 Who should I could you help me and I'm thinking can I help you yes theoretically I can help you I am able bodied I will be able to help you yes yeah and you're thinking it's whenever you have time in the next little while I finish this level but typically but even if you're not playing a video game right.
 But typically if I'm asking for help, I mean right now.
 I never asked for help 10 minutes before I need it.
 By the way, in 10 minutes, I may need your help.
 I don't know how many times until we figured out what was driving me nuts.
 And I was able to communicate, Hey, babe, I realized when I'm asking for help, I mean now.
 And not like, no, but just I don't pre think I don't pre realize that I need your help with a jar or,
 you know, and then I'm stuck until you help me.
 So I do mean now.
 And what are the sweetest words you can hear when you say, babe, could you help me with this?
 Sure, babe.
 I'll do it right now.
 Yeah, which you're great at and especially since my arm has been getting worse.
 But I'm only great at that once you once you learn that was the issue and communicated it to me.
 Right.
 Because prior to that, it was frustrating.
 Yeah, you would just internalize your frustration and then blow up one day.
 And I'd be like, geez, what's your problem, lady?
 You know, because I haven't realized, oh, you've been storing up the frustration.
 like I've been communicating dishonor to you completely,
 obliviously, I haven't been aware that this is an issue.
 And to be fair, neither of you.
 Yeah.
 You're just slowly eroding honor in our relationship by not helping you
 when you need to.
 Yeah.
 And then it dawned on you.
 Oh, so.
 And then I would do stuff like just push through the pain that I was in
 because you didn't get up right away because you didn't realize I needed you
 to get up her way.
 And then I'd hurt myself further.
 So I mean, just stuff like that would just become this, you know, look.
 And it's funny what constitutes dishonor messages.
 I saw on Instagram, I think this week,
 our friends, Alex and Henry Sealy,
 they posted a series of photographs that were hysterical.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, they were so funny.
  </li><li>Basically, it was a photograph
 of an empty toilet paper roll,
 still on the spindle with a new toilet roll
 just shoved on top of it, like not attached.
 And she was like, "Seriously ladies,
 "any other husbands suffer from this deficiency?"
 And then he posted a picture later
 where basically she'd replaced the toilet tube
 and left the empty one just on the floor beneath.
 Like, so it was this tit for tat thing.
 And we laugh at that, but there can be little things
 where you say, hey, could you make sure
 you put the toilet roll back on?
 And it doesn't happen.
 And somehow that in and of itself isn't
 worth getting upset about.
 But the message being sent is, I don't care
 about what you're asking.
 And you just store a professor.
 So tiny little things to massive things all contribute to either feeling a love tank or
 draining it really, really quickly.
 And so the key there is learning to communicate.
 And gosh, you would think that communication should be super easy.
 Totally not.
 No, as Dan Farley says, everybody has their own secret code book that we communicate through
 and we expect everybody else has the secret decoder rings.
 And I would say we have an advantage in that we understand life languages and actually
 our life languages are fairly similar in our top three or four.
 So there'sI'
 m going to stop you right there.
 Yeah.
 Because there's probably people listening who aren't familiar with the term life languages.
 Okay.
 What we need to do is we need to talk about life languages.
 We need to do a whole podcast on life languages.
 Yeah.
 Maybe we could have Alison on to talk about life languages if you'd care.
 However.
 Life language is basically a communication profile tool that helps you understand how you communicate
 and what's important to you in communication. And we haveAnd 
 your distress signs and all that kind of stuff.
 And we have taken that and we understand how fluent we are in.
 Anyway, we're talking about something that we really need to devote a whole podcast.
 Yeah. Yeah. And so we'll do that. We'll talk about that more. But I was just, I mean,
 basically my point was our first three or four languages are basically the same.
 So probably in terms of communication, we're maybe a little bit ahead in terms of ease,
 naturally, because we think very similarly and we greet problems very similarly.
 Correct.
 And even in the midst of that, we can still totally miss each other, hurt one another,
 even though we view life almost exactly the same.
 Right.
 So yeah, I mean, marriage is work. Anyone who tells you differently is selling something.
 I think what they would be selling.
 All right.
 So there's number one is it's my job to control myself.
 I don't get to control other people.
 Number two is the number one goal in prioritating relationships is building and protecting connection.
 And the third and final skill that you need in order to control yourself and pursue the goal of connection
 is a new plan for dealing with the things that threaten your connections.
 Oh boy, stepping back and identifying the things that are a threat to your connection
 is one of the smartest uses of your time for relationships.
 Yeah, for sure.
 So what threatens our connection?
 I think probably our biggest one is just busyness.
 Right, because when you're running at a certain pace, you can actually...
 Well, run yourself out your grace levels get low and you know everybody becomes an obstacle
 instead of a blessing.
 Well even more than that you can like our whole life is fairly structured.
 Yeah.
 Like I just scheduled a lunch with a friend in October like the last week of October.
 Like taking me a bunch together and like yes I was you know the last week of October.
 And so when you're moving at that pace there's a danger that we take one another for granted
 and forget to schedule and things that are important to each other.
 I think it's a danger too that we don't preserve our connection with our kids either in the
 midst of busyness.
 Those connections are super important as well and they connect differently.
 Yeah, they really do.
 Our youngest daughter, Tia, is quite similar to me, isn't she?
 And that she loves being with people.
 But once she's hit her max, she doesn't want to see anybody.
 So today she was at church from, I don't know, 830 to like 130 with everybody.
 We went out for lunch.
 She made it through lunch.
 Then she came home, went into a dark room with some headphones on my pad and resurfaced
 two hours later.
 She's quite different from our oldest daughter Abigail, who after being at church with people
 all day and lunch just wanted to hang out with me all afternoon and was like a human
 blanket.
 Just physical touch, quality time.
 Total, total people person.
 an m_j_ is probably somewhere in the middle he loves to play and connect and be with people and then he'll also have his moments where.
 You just need to not touch him not talk to him just leave him all over the bed.
 Yeah i'm learning to read the signal super important yeah you know the other thing that threatens our connection but.
 In that one i don't treat tenderly the things that you value even though i don't value them yeah.
 And again, busyness will kind of erode the grace level to go, oh, yes, I have to remember that I'm interested in this because you're interested in it.
 Right.
 What about, I was thinking about this, this, because this happened this week because there's like five people having a conversation with me at the same time.
 When we get to a level where we are maxed out on incoming information.
 So for example, I'm fairly, you know, single focused on tasks.
 So I might be responding to a text message.
 And you might not know that I'm responding to text message.
 So you're asking me for an answer.
 I can't think of the answer I'm trying to give you.
 Meanwhile, MJ is asking me to tie his shoes on.
 Meanwhile, Tia comes up and wants me to open like a juice packet.
 Meanwhile, I'm getting texts from other people and an email that comes in.
 And at that point, I'm just ready to explode.
 And it's not that anybody has done anything wrong.
 It's just this way too much information coming into me at once.
 So, and then again, if you're busy, that raises the water level of how much bandwidth you can
 absolutely have.
 So how do you maintain connection when you're bandwidth is full?
 Reducing friction, that's one of the reasons we try to automate as much stuff as we can in life,
 so that we're not spending valuable decision-making energy on trivial things.
 We tend to eat at the same restaurants, we tend to order the same thing every restaurant.
 You know, a lot of our household supplies come on Amazon, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 We're trying to pre-decide decisions we do care about, so we don't have to think about them in the moment.
 Right.
 And then trying to teach your children to not talk over each other, and that mom and daddy only have
 two sets of ears between them.
 Right, that's not right.
 Mom and daddy are sharing their ears today.
 Don't be alarmed.
 Well, I hope that's helpful, that rambling on connection for us,
 more than anything else more than being right being connected is the most important thing.
 And it has not only strengthened our marriage but saved our marriage on so many times hasn't it?
 Yeah.
 All right. I've got time for a listeners question.
 No.
 All right. Kayla will answer your question next week.
 Sorry Kayla. I'm still hungry.
 All right. Here's your ramp up. If you want the show notes for this week's episode,
 including a link to Danny Silk's book, head to alanaj.com/69. Finding father books last week
 we told you that we were sold out of books this week we got more in which is amazing.
 Our publisher sent some and then we opened up the box and we found that there was a problem
 with the printing press.
 So they're going back to our publisher and we'll get some more back in and we'll tell
 you what we do.
 They're rushing it though so it should be a couple of weeks.
 And Heaven Declares is our fall conference at Grace Center.
 It's going to be an incredible conference.
 We'd love you to join us.
 Go to heavendeclares.info for all the information.
 forget to submit your jingles by October 1st.
 And we just bless you to have a wonderful week in Jesus' name.
 We'll catch you next week.
