<p> AJ Jones, welcome home. Thanks. Where have you been? St. Louis.
 And what have you been doing in St. Louis? I was doing a women's event in St. Louis for
 Southgate Church. You have been there many, many times.
 Behind years in a row. They just love you, I guess. They do. I love them too though.
 Well, that works because that would be awkward if you didn't. Yes. If it's not too weird a statement,
 I've fallen in love with that group of ladies.
 They're so amazing.<br/>
 Oh, good.<br/>
 And I love seeing all the stuff that God's doing from year to year to year.
 And you took a team of women with you to minister as well.
 I did.<br/>
 And do you have fun?<br/>
 It was so fun.<br/>
 They're they're crazy.<br/>
 Like the women you took with you or the women you went to visit?
 Well, the women went to visit and then I brought some crazies with me.
 So I had a lot of extra votes on the team this year.
 And that worked out real well.<br/>
 So really even car rides with extraverts.
 Well, it was a little loud when we first all got in the van to head to St.
 Louis and then a couple of the extroverts fell asleep and it got like about, you know, normal.
 So that's amazing.<br/>
 So yeah, it was good.<br/>
 So you had a great time.<br/>
 You've literally just walked in the door from driving home from St.
 Louis. Yeah.<br/>
 And you're looking amazing.<br/>
 Really?<br/>
 Ah, absence makes a heart grefonder.<br/>
 So I don't actually look amazing, but because I've been away for three days, I look OK.
 But what's the right answer that still lets me jump here tonight?
 Oh dear.<br/>
 Um, I don't know.<br/>
 I have to see.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 You realize all the children are still alive.
 That must count for something.<br/>
 It does.<br/>
 It I mean, alive and they even looked happy.
 Very happy and like you might have bath them this weekend.
 I did.<br/>
 I bath them.<br/>
 I remember how to do that.<br/>
 And I fed them, I think mostly.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And it's kind of easy now because I let them
 and pick their own clothes.
</p><ul>
  <li>Okay, okay, including MJ.
  </li><li>And you're not there to correct me.
 Sure, he went in Superman,
 but Jama's the church today was fine, no one cared.
  </li><li>Oh, okay, well he'd look cute.
  </li><li>Tell me about this week, recap.
  </li><li>Taught on the father heart at the school this week.
  </li><li>Yes, you did, you did an incredible job.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>There was lots of tears.
  </li><li>Lots of tears, that's what you're looking for
 in a father heart week.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>And then I taught at M&amp;A on Monday night.
 And then we had a, we said this every week,
 we had a week of meetings.
 because we have weekly meetings, but they were very productive and very encouraging
 meetings. They were. It was a good week.
 The most important thing of this week was new iPhones came up. Yes. Did we get new iPhones?
 We did. Does that surprise anybody? Probably not.
 Now this is the advantage of the iPhone upgrade cycle. You can sell your current phones to
 couple the cost of new phones. And it, yeah. Which is what we did. There you go. We actually,
 in America, they have the iPhone upgrade programs right from Apple, which seems like
 a lot less work. So we signed up for that, which just gives us a new iPhone every year,
 which is basically what we're doing.
 So now going forward, we don't have to find somebody to sell it to. We just hand it back
 and get a new one.
 Correct.
 I'm liking this idea. But we've never really had a hard time selling our phones.
 Nope. No, we have not.
 So, yeah, I'm super excited. We didn't have great internet while we were away this weekend.
 So some of my things instantly downloaded when I walked in the house.
 What do you mean your things?
 My apps and stuff that had it.
 from your backup. Yeah, that hadn't downloaded from backup. So I'm with you.
 I'm excited. I haven't played my game all weekend. So strong. I know, right?
 I haven't played lots of my game this week. It's amazing how much gaming you can get done when
 your wife isn't there to kind of moderate your progress through Super Mario Brothers U.
 When we were driving in the car as we were leaving, they were saying, so you know, what's
 all I'm going to do with the kids this weekend? And I'm like, you know, I don't know, but I
 imagine he's going to play more video games than normal.
 And I said, but he will have to feed the kids.
 And so Shannon said, well, if you come home and MJ knows how to make his own
 omelets, you'll know that he didn't feed the kids.
 I made sure the kids were turned towards the light periodically.
 Great.
 They just ate M&amp;Ms and Skittles out of a dog bowl and they were fine.
 I just put down some newspaper in the corner and they were great.
 All we can.
 A little bit of water, maybe.
 Talk to him about jingles because this Thursday,
 October 1st is the cut off for a jingle.
 Yeah, come on.
 And I've had lots of people come up to me at church and just say, I've got some jingles
 for you, but no tweets yet.
 Oh, guys, you have to get your jingles in.
 We need your jingles by the first.
 Not strictly speaking true that we had no tweets.
 We did get one tweet.
 Yes.
 But I'm too excited about it to talk about it.
 Yes.
 Do you know what?
 I was thinking about a topic for this week.
 Yeah.
 And I was thinking about what you were teaching this week at school.
 Yeah.
 Surely we've talked about the topic we're going to talk about tonight.
 But we haven't had that.
 And I look back through 69 episodes and we haven't talked about the power of forgiveness.
 At all.
 It's hard to believe.
 Shocking.
 Right.
 It's like not talking about donuts, the kindness of God, the father, the prophetic.
 Fish tacos.
 Right.
 We hadn't covered forgiveness.
 And for people who are connected with you, who know, you who've heard you speak,
 Obviously, the father heart message is a key message of yours.
 But right at the first message you probably ever share on the father heart message is your forgiveness message.
 And thousands of people around the world have been impacted by your life story.
 Yeah.
 Which you don't have to tell now because it takes a long time.
 Yeah.
 But forgiveness has been key to your life.
 And if I made the radiance of your life, like when I met you in 2000,
 in three, I couldn't equate the person standing before me with the person in the story when
 you tell your life story. Does that make sense? Yeah. When you're telling the class about
 your life, it's very, very hard for me to correlate the little girl in that story who
 grew up to be the radiant woman in front of me. Cool.
 And I think obviously the key to that is not only receiving forgiveness, but extending
 forgiveness. So talk to me a little bit about misconceptions about forgiveness.
 Okay. You have to remember when you met me though, you're talking 12 years into a journey of learning
 how to forgive at that point. And so... Yeah, you hadn't met me in one of the new chapter of
 forgiveness. I forgive Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong, and Alan.
 And what's that guy's name?
 Bowser.
 Yes, we have a Bowser in our little studio here.
 That's that sad.
 Anyway, I...
 That glorious.
 Glorious.
 I'm sorry, I meant glorious.
 I just said sad.
 I think there's a lot of misconceptions about forgiveness.
 I think sometimes people's reticence to forgive,
 and certainly my reticence to forgive to begin with,
 was that I thought if I forgave someone for what they had done,
 or, you know, whether it's my dad or whoever it was, that that meant what they had done
 was okay.
 Right.
 So I couldn't get to the point or I wouldn't allow myself to get to the point where I
 forgave them because I thought, well, what they did wasn't okay and I won't say that.
 Right.
 But forgiveness doesn't say what they did was okay.
 It just says you don't owe me for it anymore.
 But those two seem neighbors.
 You don't owe me anything for what you did.
 I mean, that's a hard mountain to climb.
 People who've been betrayed, beaten up, stolen from, abused, right?
 To turn to the person who perpetrate those horrible things, and you say, actually,
 I don't need to get even with you.
 You don't owe me anything.
 I actually release you from everything you did to me.
 That's an enormously Everest like.
 That's to to ascend.
 What is the reward for doing that?
 Because surely there is merit found in the vitriol of unforgiveness.
 Well, nothing that's going to give you life.
 I think the reward in the short answer is freedom.
 But I think maybe looking at it a little bit differently, like here's the thing.
 You and I, when we're, when we've been forgiven by Jesus for all the things that
 we've done, we owe nothing now.
 Right.
 That's not fair either.
 But the kingdom of God isn't about fairness.
 So I'm thankful that I don't know what I should owe for the way that I've lived my life because actually what I owe is my life.
 But Jesus made an exchange for me.
 And so you're doing the same thing.
 You're saying, okay, you know, I'm going to release you from the debt that you owe me from it.
 When you release somebody from the debt that they owe you, then actually God can move and bring healing.
 the longer you sort of sit there with your little hands around their little neck waiting for justice,
 you're never going to see healing in that situation. And you're the one that's suffering as much as
 anybody else. Yeah, unforgiveness is kind of like drinking poison and hoping the other person gets
 sick. Right. It's funny because even in the church circles and the Christian world that some people
 move in, their viewpoint of God is through a justice mentality. Yeah. Where they want justice
 for the person who sinned against them, but they want mercy for themselves and their sins against God.
 Right. And it doesn't work that way. Why doesn't it work that way?
 Because if I want justice for you, I get justice for me. And if I want mercy for you, I get mercy
 for me, but I can't. It doesn't work that I could sow wanting justice and reap mercy.
 Right. There's that amazing verse that says, "Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. A man
 and reap for His souls.
 And it's impossible to sow oranges and reap bananas.
 So you can't sow, get them, God, get them.
 See what they've done to me?
 Make sure they pay me back and actually
 reap the same thing in your own life.
 And the thing is you don't just reap from that one situation.
 You reap from all over the place.
 So whatever you're sowing, even if you might even
 be sowing something small and with just one situation
 where you're unwilling to release forgiveness,
 going to reap unforgiveness from all over the place. So it's never going to be a good decision.
 I heard a Christian minister once say that it's immoral to forgive somebody who hasn't first
 repented and said sorry for the thing that you need to forgive them for.
 I'm not sure where they get that from. I mean, I remember the Lord saying to me,
 You know, when he was asking me to forgive my first husband for, you know, everything that had
 gone down in that situation. And there was a lot. And he woke me up one morning, gave me this dream,
 and he said, "I want you to forgive him and let him go." And I was like, "Okay." You know,
 I was bawling because of the stream that he'd given me. And he said, "I want you to forgive him."
 And he made, he's never going to say that he's sorry. And so it's one of the questions that I
 ask people, you know, when we talk about forgiveness, can you forgive them, even if
 they're never going to say that they're sorry? Because us extending forgiveness is
 actually something that Jesus asks us to do. And it never says anywhere that I can
 remember that they have to say they're sorry first. Right. You know, so what was
 that like forgiving your husband for running off of somebody else and cheating
 on you? And then ultimately filing for divorce against you. What was that like
 having to forgive when the Lord said, he's never going to say he's sorry.
 horribly difficult.
 I mean, you know, there was, there were moments where it felt easy
 ish and then there was days where it was just horribly difficult.
 Cause it kind of comes in stages and layers, you know, right.
 Um, but freedom lies on the other side of doing it.
 I remember you teaching something that took me a while to get my
 head around. But I've since meditated on it, I think it's amazing. Tell me your insight
 on forgiveness about Stephen being stoned to death in the book of Acts.
 So if you read Acts, where Stephen is, he's anointed for lack of a better word, he's chosen
 and he's set apart. And then a couple chapters later, he's stoned to death. And certainly
 present at that stoning, possibly orchestrating it, is a man named Saul.
 And we know that he's there because the Bible says that he's there.
 And Stephen, as he's being killed, releases forgiveness to those that are killing him.
 Just as Jesus did on the cross.
 Just as Jesus did on the cross.
 And I think it was pretty impressive.
 I've never been killed before, but I think it would be difficult, you know, while people are, you know, throwing large rocks at me to be like, no, I forgive them.
 But he did.
 He forgave them.
 And I really think that that forgiveness is what releases God to move in Saul's life.
 So all of that takes place in Acts 7.
 And then in Acts 9, Saul has his encounter on the road to Damascus and is blinded,
 encounters Jesus and becomes Paul.
 So it makes me wonder if Stephen's forgiveness released a grace upon Saul for God to move
 and do what he did and make him fall.
  </li><li>Here's something I'm wondering.
 It's quite aside from the spiritual dynamics
 of forgiveness and/or unforgiveness.
 Like when I met you,
 even though, as I was saying, I'd listened to your life story
 and we're gonna put a link in the show notes
 so you can hear AJ's test when if you haven't heard it before,
 I just even think about what kind of person
 you would have been if you had an extended forgiveness.
 Certainly you wouldn't have been as cute
 and as shiny as you were.
 You probably would have looked like a prune.
 I'd look like one of those, did you ever make one of those apple people?
 No.
 You know, you take an apple and you shrivel it up and then you put pins in it for an
 eye and a nose and it looks like a little shrivel, little lady.
 We had TV in Scotland,
 ten or ten.
 Oh, wow, that's great.
 But not good TV.
 Now you're going to get emails.
 Yeah, you know, when you meet people who are struggling with unforgiveness,
 it's not a pretty site, especially when it's been a 30, 40, 50 year journey.
 And the trouble is it's like, I know you probably don't have a better tool to deal with the pain that you're carrying,
 but ironically, the way to get rid of the pain is to extend forgiveness to the person who inflicted the pain in the first place.
 But I think when you're right in the midst of a whole bunch of pain, it seems like the hardest thing in the world to do.
 Absolutely.
 But it's the smartest thing.
 And it's the thing that will get you the healing that you'd so desperately want the fastest.
 Yeah, like I said, if you want to hear ages story of growing up in a very broken and abusive household and her struggles with suicide and death in the family and alcoholism and how do you even describe your life?
 It's like all the episodes of every major theme in a soap opera happening in your life,
 but it was all real.
 And then the trail and I mean, it's amazing.
 I just love that you're happy.
 And I remember, I remember one time we were coming home from church and you'd been on
 prayer team and you were praying with somebody who was going through a horrible divorce.
 And in the car home, you know, you were really quiet.
 I said, are you okay?
 And you're like, yeah, I just praying for somebody who's, you know, whose husband's just
 left her and it just really broke my heart.
 I just can't even imagine what it would be like to go through that.
 And I was like, babe, you went through that and you were like, oh, yeah, I did.
 I forgot about that.
 But that's what forgiveness does, because it totally removes the power behind the things
 that you've been through.
 So yeah, I've been through a lot of stuff, but I don't have to walk like the wounded and
 it's forgiveness that releases that.
 Forgiveness is the door that ushers in the restoration, the whole experience.
 Yeah.
 just unlock that bad boy and the grace and the mercy
 and the love of Jesus just becomes pouring in.
 It's incredible.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>If you would like to hear AJ's testimony
 and her teaching on forgiveness, go to lmaj.com/70
 and it will be in the show notes
 so you can find a link there.
 All right, do you wanna say anything else about forgiveness?
  </li><li>I'd encourage you to give it a shot
 and realize that sometimes you forgive the same person
 for the same thing more than once
 maybe 50 or 100 times depending on what it is and you just keep going until that thing
 doesn't have any power behind it when it comes to mind.
 I mean, the two key verses in Scripture, Matthew 18 with the power of the unmerciful servant
 and then the Lord's Prayer that actually it's a mandate to forgive. That's not very helpful to
 know when you're in the midst of forgiveness. But I guess one thing that's very handy to know
 is that forgiveness is actually a choice it's not feeling. You're probably never going to feel
 like forgiving. It's always going to be a choice of something you choose.
 Yeah, you just get your will behind it and go for it.
 And I think people get stuck because it feels fraudulent, like the pain feels real,
 but the forgiveness feels fake. What do you say to people in that situation?
 Well, I think there's power in your words. So you start with getting your will behind it and
 releasing forgiveness. And sometimes your emotions come online and sometimes they don't,
 but either way you're being obedient to Scripture and God's going to honor that.
 Very good. I've got a listening question for you.
 Okay.
 Last week we talked about connection. This week we got an
 a listening question from Charlene and she says this, she said, "I love your podcast.
 As a single woman, I sometimes struggle with the who to maintain connection with.
 I have lots of friends in that there are many people who I enjoy and can talk to
 at a party or event. But my question is, how does someone who is single and loved by others
 get on the minds of other people to invite them places.
 It seems like others may be assuming that I don't want to spend time with them and their kids or husbands,
 but I actually would love to.
 My other question is, what does community or connection look like for someone single like me,
 as it seems like all of it is centered around spouses and children, which I don't have yet?
 Thanks again, love you guys have done. Well, you can answer the second part to that question,
 because you were single for quite some time after being divorced until you met the sons of Scotsman.
 It's true. It's true. I was single for quite a while.
 So my question to you then on behalf of this listener is what did community or connection look
 like for you when a lot of your friends had spouses? I suppose community and connection
 for me looked a lot like doing different church events like... Because that was your orbit.
 Because that was my orbit. And so yeah, I mean, there was young adult things, there was, you know,
 youth things and I kind of helped out with the youth. And then if there was, you know,
 if there was a service going on, I'd go show up and most of my friends all were in that
 same sort of orbit. So we just mostly groups, I mean, just huge groups of people hanging
 out. And we kind of all went out for lunch every Sunday and all did this and all that,
 you know what I mean? Like we just moved around together as a big kind of horde of people.
 Right. So I had friends within that group that were definitely tighter
 Friendships, you know where I was definitely closer with them and they were the kind of people that I go
 I'm really hurting about this or you know
 Hey, could you pray with me about that or you know if you because I'm not exactly an extrovert?
 I'd need smaller group time as well. Um and some of those people were married in some of them weren't but um
 They tended to be all people that were evenly invested in relationship
 Hopefully that's a helpful second question. First question is, how do you get in the minds of other people, especially people who got kids or spouses?
 I think the funny thing is I remember being single and trying to connect with people who were married and had kids and
 really had no clue
 how different their life was from mine. Like I remember saying, hey, you know, why don't you come over at seven o'clock and they were like, uh,
 I put my kids to bed at seven and it hadn't, you know, until you're married or until you have kids,
 It's very difficult to imagine just how consuming getting through the day is.
 Forget spending time with your spouse or having a date night.
 I just mean making sure none of the children are bleeding or broken and are
 well fed and have done their homework and are in bed.
 Right.
 You know, by the time you get to the end of the night, you're just like, uh...
 I mean, I don't even arrive at thinking about even possibly being social until
 after they've gone to bed and I've had half an hour of nobody saying, "Mommy," so you're now talking
 seven thirty before I've considered if I even have energy to see somebody.
 Right.
 And usually by then I'm like, it's too late.
 And so tomorrow begins.
 Right.
 So it's probably not the single person's fault.
 If you know, so because the question is how to get on other people's minds.
 The truth is other people's minds are probably wasted by about eight p.m.
 They're just like, oh my gosh, I believe it got for that day.
 So it's not like they're in this constant stream of socializing and you're
 somehow missing out on it. It's they're probably just collapsed.
 And I was saying, I was especially when there's kids involved, right?
 I think there's the stage of you get married and you're learning how to do life
 with a spouse, but really even at that stage, you could still go, Hey, babe,
 I'm going to go out with so and so. And it's no inconvenience to the other person
 because you're not asking them to pick up the slack. But it's, it's different
 when there's kids involved because now you're, you know, in order for me to go out
 and hang out for a day with whoever, that means you have to be okay with having three
 kids and everything that comes with that. And you're just as tired as I am. So it's a lot easier
 if you're sharing the load. So obviously we frequently just say, hey, come over and hang out.
 Right. And hang out means be a part of what's going on.
 Be a part of the circus that's going on. Be prepared to get catch up flung at you.
 be prepared to persuade children that don't eat to be content to have door the explorer on the background and then once all the kids are the way be prepared to set a sofa and say nothing.
 Well if we personalize it and we think about the friends that we have in our orbit of our life at this at this point if they were to come over and just fit in with what's going on.
 and be happy to just kind of hang out and then take the energy level as it comes which means that seven o'clock there may be energy for conversation and there may not.
 You know and you're free to hang out watch movies with us if that's what we're doing or you know sometimes we're chatting or whatever.
 But it sort of go with the ebbs and flow of the amount of energy that's available then that's really cool but.
 It's i think some it depends on the person because if you're looking for more of a connection in a heartfelt something that's going to be really hard for me to do specifically or.
 I'm without having you know face time without any kids involved without any for me that takes planning energy for that event because i'm spending everything i've got on the kids and right and then you're planning energy on that means.
 I'm spending my energy on a completely different event which is juggling three kids or vice versa.
 So you're available spots as a married person with three children to go and connect with other people is drastically limited which is why might look insular from the outside i wonder.
 Because you're just you're just maintaining keeping your head above the water and i think as kids get older it looks a little different i was just in a stage where ours are really little right there.
 you know we still have one in diapers and they're just very hands-on right and that needs to be the
 priority so i guess the answer to the first part of the question is unfortunately you have to work
 very very hard at probably getting very very little yeah i'm not sure it's gonna feel like a good
 return on investment necessarily probably the great return on investment is finding other people
 from the similar sort of season of life and connecting with them.
 Yeah.
 Okay, here's another lesson question for you.
 Yeah.
 This is from Kayla.
 This is a great question.
 Okay.
 She says, "I'm a believer and I've been to many charismatic house churches and I still
 have a lot of questions, one, for example, being on the gift of prophecy.
 I'm confused as to how that is specifically a lesson to be taught to another believer.
 If this is the gift of the Holy Spirit, shouldn't he be the one to give it to us?
 How does a person give this to another person?
 I'm going to stop there.
 There's another part of the question.
 Kayla, have you ever met somebody who is gifted at music?
 Like they can just, for whatever reason, play piano by ear, right?
 And so they've got this amazing gift where they can just play.
 That person would still benefit from being taught how to play the piano.
 That still receive incredible benefit from learning how to play with other people, from
 learning how to read music to actually kind of broaden the gift that's already there.
 Yeah, refine the gift.
 Yeah. So you may have a gift, but until you know how to use your gift, your gift is kind
 of useless. John Paul Jackson, who was a very famous prophet, who is now with the Lord,
 said that for most of his early parts of his life, he was a gifted nothing. He was somebody who had
 a gift, but wasn't trained in how to use it, how to connect with the rest of the body,
 etc, etc, etc. How does a person give this gift to another person? What Paul said,
 I long to be with you that I may impart some spiritual gift to you.
 So there is a sense that gifts can be imparted to people.
 Yes.
 But a lot of the training that we do in the prophetic is not training you how to get a gift,
 it's training you how to use the gift that you may have already been given,
 or activating you in a gift, so to speak.
 So I hope that helps.
 The second part is that also every time a person with a gift of prophecy calls themselves a prophet,
 my spirit becomes very uneasy.
 And I was just wondering if that term is just a blank statement for someone with a gift or it actually means a profit with equal authority as Jesus.
 What do you specifically mean when you call yourself a prophet?
 If you think about it, Kayla, I mean, I get what you're saying.
 I'm usually quite uneasy around people who call themselves prophets.
 I know lots of prophets and people who I would call a prophet.
 But are you uneasy when people call themselves a pastor?
 Are you uneasy when Billy Graham is referred to as an evangelist?
 You're probably not uncomfortable with people calling themselves a teacher or a pastor,
 because we're kind of used to those terms and we've built up an understanding of what those ministry offices look like.
 We understand what a pastor does, we understand what a teacher does, we understand what an evangelist does.
 But I don't think everybody who has the gift of prophecy is a prophet.
 That's not something I subscribe to at all.
 I think there's been a lot of misuse with people calling themselves profit.
 Yeah, for sure.
 The couple of episodes that we've done when we've talked about our journey into understanding
 the prophetic call in our life is really our unease with the term profit, our unease with
 referring to ourselves as prophets, and our journey in understanding, "Oh, okay, we've
 got varying degrees of calling into prophetic ministry."
 And in age a, especially I forget which episode it was that you talked about your difficulty,
 because a lot of the prophets that were coming to our church that are calling you out as a prophet,
 and it was a big deal for you to agree with what God had said about you.
 So I'm not sure if that helps, but certainly we don't believe that people who are prophets are on the same equal authority as Jesus.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Because Jesus himself gave prophets to the church.
  </li><li>Right. - So in Ephesians 4 verse 11, it says,
 So Christ himself gave apostles the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and the teachers
 to equip his people for works of service so that the body of Christ may be built up until we reach unity in the faith
 and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature.
 So part of the role of a prophet along with an apostle and a pastor and evangelist and a teacher
 is to equip the church.
  </li><li>And bring maturity. - And bring maturity.
 So are there a lot of people who are wondering around calling themselves pastors and teachers and prophets who aren't really passes teachers and prophets? Of course there are.
 But at the same time, there are legitimate people who are prophets and I love being in relationship with lots of those people.
 Yeah.
 All right. I hope that was helpful.

 And oh, I forgot our finding father books are back in stock.
 Yes, they are.
 We got a shipment this week.
 And if you've been looking for a copy, go to allanaj.com and we'll put a link in the show
 notes and you can purchase a life-changing book there.
 And also we have our Heaven Declares conference coming up at Grace Center.
 At the end of October, we'd love to see you there.
 Go to heavendeclares.info for information about that.
 And don't forget to get your jingles in my Thursday.
 Bye-bye.
