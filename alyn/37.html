<p> Ladies and gentlemen, I can actually say ladies and gentlemen, because there's a lady and a gentleman with a very respectable beard sitting in our studio.
 In your respect will be heard.<br/>
 And I've just dubbed our spare room studio.
 Mm hmm.<br/>
 That's our pretentious.<br/>
 It's become a studio.<br/>
 It used to be our Godroom.<br/>
 And previous to that it was our bonus room.
 But it is a studio.<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 It is now.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 Ladies and gentlemen, we have none other than Mr. Lyle Phillips with us.
 Hello.<br/>
 Last week.<br/>
 You may or may not know this, but AJ came prepared this week to prepare a jingle.
 AJ, did you complete your homework?<br/>
 I'm amazing.<br/>
 We know that.<br/>
 But did you do your homework?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So you have downloaded GarageBand to your iPad.
 Yes.<br/>
 And in GarageBand, you have created a jingle.
 And for the first time ever, would you play it for us, please?
 Sure.<br/>
 [music]<br/>
 Wow babe, you've hands them or may as well just retire because you're available.
 We could be making millions.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 I'm going to hire you out as a<br/>
 Jingle maker, movie soundtrack.<br/>
 I have a cousin that makes jingles actually.
 Is that where you got help from?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Allial Phillips.<br/>
 How in the heck are you?<br/>
 Man, I am amazing.<br/>
 You are.<br/>
 Awesome.<br/>
 My wife's pregnant eight months, so we're really excited right now at the
 Phillips house.<br/>
 You're about to have a baby.<br/>
 you baby Isaiah and oh I thought it was going to be called Alan oh yeah I forgot about that we did text about this I'm still praying about Alan as a middle name.
 Yeah with a why right with a very regal yeah majestic yeah it is for those people who have not had the pleasure of meeting you.
 I'm so sorry first of all that was his beard scratch it is so large that there are rodents in there that he's just checking your okay that was breakfast.
 (laughing)
</p><ul>
  <li>For those people who've not met Lyle Phillips,
 Lyle, tell us who you are and what you do.
  </li><li>Sure, well, my name is Lyle Phillips.
 I am from West Kentucky,
 a really tiny farming community called Sacramento, Kentucky.
 There it is. - You don't have
 to be confused with Sacramento, California.
  </li><li>Yeah, you won't have a problem confusing it
 because it takes about five minutes
 to drive through the entirety of the town.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's one stoplight in the entire county.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Yeah, so it's a really small town.
 So that's where I'm from.
 And my wife, Alison and I, pastor,
 a church called Iris here in Nashville.
  </li><li>And is the church Iris affiliated with Iris
 that people may know of Heidi and Roland Baker?
  </li><li>Absolutely, yeah.
 We are one of about 30 missions bases around the world.
  </li><li>Wow. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And we're gonna get into that story
 of how you got connected with IRS and how you got connected.
  </li><li>Absolutely. - Later.
 You also run a ministry called Mercy 29.
  </li><li>Yes, I do.
  </li><li>And what does Mercy 29 do?
  </li><li>So basically Mercy 29 is a non-profit
 that I began when I was 24 years old.
 And so we go after feeding hungry people
 and rescuing children from human trafficking,
 child slavery and prostitution.
  </li><li>We could just end up with that.
  </li><li>That's a small job then.
  </li><li>Yeah, so you oversee the 501(c)(3)
 and the proper organization that rescues children
 from human trafficking and you feed orphans,
 you have an orphanage, don't you?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You have a couple of orphanages?
  </li><li>That was yours.
  </li><li>That was mine.
  </li><li>You did not put me on our plane.
  </li><li>Alan scolded all of us prior to starting this interview
 with everybody put your phone on airplane mode.
  </li><li>And his just dinged.
  </li><li>You know I can cut this out guys.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So you ran an orphanage?
 Yes.
 So, just recently as of 2015, we've passed along the orphanages that we began to an organization
 called Set Free Alliance out of Texas, which is awesome because they're able to do something
 for those kids that we never were.
 And I can't remember the amount.
 No, I think it's like $90,000 a month.
 took our children's homes and they're now supporting them to the tune of 90 grand a month. So what's
 that? What that does is it allows all of those kids to be enrolled in free school, you know,
 receive education, medication, if they needed planting churches, building better homes for them
 where they all have space with beds and a few changes of clothes.
 And when that would have happened if you hadn't started.
 Yeah, pretty much.
 So you're a full-time pastor, you're a full-time husband, about to become a full-time dad.
 And you also run an international missions organization.
 Why are you so happy?
 Jesus.
 Right?
 That's a really good answer.
 Yeah.
 And it's a real answer.
 It's not a bad answer.
 No, not at all.
 So tell us your story, because I know some of your story.
 I don't know all of it.
 Sure.
 But go back to the days when you had grills and plural and an Afro.
 Right.
 And you were dealing drugs.
 Tell us how you got to that state.
 Okay.
 So when I was a kid, I grew up like taking naps under the church pew.
 Right.
 My parents have been in ministry for most of my life.
 So I grew up with this love slash hate relationship with the church, which many
 people have.
 Absolutely.
 A lot of PKs, you know.
 And for me, when I was about 11 years old, I really felt like God was calling me
 into a life of ministry, which I absolutely despised and said, God, no way,
 no, how will I ever become a preacher?
 How'd that work out?
 Well, I'm a preacher.
 So no way.
 Yeah.
 I was like, I don't want to be a preacher.
 I want to be in the NBA.
 Right.
 Yeah, because I played basketball and grew up playing basketball for Nike.
 So I traveled.
 I was teammates with Ray John Rondo, who now plays for the Dallas Mavericks.
 Thanks for explaining that because I don't know who sports, but my listeners will know who that is.
 Yeah, he's an NBA basketball player.
 There were many others on that team that played D1 ball.
 Is it cheeky to say, and you're so tall that it's reasonable that you would think that this was?
 Yeah.
 I mean, my chances of playing in the NBA were slim to none.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Absolutely.
 But I was like, had my fingers crossed
 for overseas ball or something like that.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So. - You can play in China
 or something like that.
  </li><li>Yeah, in China where everybody's shorter.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>And then you'd be tall.
  </li><li>Yeah, except for Yao Ming.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Where is that?
  </li><li>Yeah, and you know about him,
 even though you don't know much about sports.
 Everybody knows about Yao Ming.
 So anyways, I wanted to play professional basketball
 and I got sucked into that culture, like big time.
 'Cause I was like, I don't wanna be in ministry.
 Everybody who works in ministry is poor.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, that was my thought.
 I don't know where I got that thought,
 but I was like, I want to be a millionaire,
 I want to play basketball, it's what I want to do.
 So I really got sucked into that culture.
 It was like the hip hop, rap, you know, hood culture.
  </li><li>Which works well when you're in a county
 with one stoplight.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And you live in a farming community.
  </li><li>Yeah, it does.
 I grew up like riding the bus, listening to
 bone thugs and harmony and Tupac and, you know,
 like all the thug rap and I was like,
 I want to be like those guys.
 You know, they're cool.
 So yeah, it's kind of weird.
 You wouldn't think that culture exists there,
 but especially when you play basketball and you travel,
 you interact with a lot of people
 where they do come from that culture, from bigger cities.
 So I was fascinated by it.
 I wanted to be a part of it.
 And when I was a senior in high school,
 I actually transitioned schools
 because I went to play basketball
 at a much larger city school in a bigger city
 because they had a really good recruiting program
 and it was pretty much a shoe-in for me
 to go play D1 college ball.
  </li><li>D1 is division one.
  </li><li>Yes.
 But that's your entryway into being recruited
 out of college and to NBA.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, you can be recruited at D2
 and AIA smaller schools as well,
 but D1 you get to play in the big dance,
 which is March Madness.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So my whole goal in life at that time was to play,
 you know, on national TV, March Madness.
  </li><li>Right.
 So I transitioned to that school and in that process was introduced to some friends who
 probably weren't that healthy and they introduced me to some harder drugs.
 I was already experimenting with weed and stuff like that.
 But in that process, I became addicted to cocaine.
 I was addicted to prescription pain pills and ended up getting kicked off of my team my
 senior year after getting some great opportunities and invitations to go and play D1 basketball.
 Wow.
 So I lost my identity.
 I just spiraled into oblivion.
 And the next thing you know, I had started running with some people who were very engaged
 in gang violence and selling drugs and shooting at people.
 One of the last things that I remember about being in that lifestyle was a drive-by being
 done on my house while I was standing in the front yard.
 You're kidding.
 I did not know this part of the story, Lyle.
 Yeah.
 Terrifying.
 I shot back at those people too.
 And that happened on multiple occasions, not just a drive by, but me shooting at people.
 So we need to stop right here in pause because if you've never met Lyle, you
 probably come up with a picture or an image of Lyle that simply doesn't exist.
 Right.
 So if you knew Lyle today and didn't know any of that story, you would never
 believe that it was true because he's got the kindest eyes.
 Nice.
 Like a big teddy bear.
 He's got the gentlest spirit and the sweetest heart.
 And so it's just so funny to me that God would transform your heart in that way.
 And I keep going.
 So that was your last family.
 How did you end up out of that?
 Mm hmm.
 Into being sweet, cuddly and an awesome beard.
 You guys should see my rap sheet.
 Like it's in my desk, in my office today.
 And I keep it as a reminder of what Jesus has done in my life.
 It's three pages long.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 I giggled your, what was it, your mugshot?
 Yeah, that's right.
 Yeah.
 Don't Google it guys, because I took it down.
 I flagged it, spammed it.
 Yeah.
 Good for you.
 Jesus has no record.
 Google shouldn't either.
 That's right.
 You know?
 So basically, to be honest with you guys, the Holy Spirit started hunting me down.
 I started dating this girl that wasn't a Christian, but begged me to go to church with her.
 And her whole motive was to get me saved.
 She wasn't, but she knew I needed to be.
 So every time we went to church, we'd sit on the back row and she'd nudge me during
 the altar call and say, "Go up to the front."
 And I'd be like, "No, leave me alone.
 I'm not getting saved."
 I know what this is.
 I grew up in church.
 Yeah, exactly.
 She was like, "You need to get saved, Lough."
 And so anyways, so the Holy Spirit, man, he's coming for me.
 I'd be riding around listening to hip hop music, smoking weed, and I'd hear God say,
 "Turn that down.
 Put that out."
 You know, I have a plan for your life.
 I love you.
 Yeah, it was crazy.
 And so one night I was, um, you know, just in my apartment, which I was selling
 cocaine out of and growing weed in my bedroom closet.
 Didn't work out too well, but I tried.
 I can't imagine this looking at you.
 Gosh.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 This is an Allen and AJ exclusive story right here.
 Like I don't know if I've ever shared.
 You know, we do.
 On the internet.
 Right, I know, I know it's terrible.
 But here's the good news,
 is that one night I was in this apartment
 and you know how whenever you go to sleep
 and you like shake, you're like,
 oh, like you fell or something?
 Like that's what happened.
 And I saw somebody walk past my window to the front door
 and I thought it was the police.
 'Cause I was like, oh man, I'm busted.
 The police are gonna come through the door,
 I'm gonna get arrested, and I'm gonna go to jail.
 And so I got up, I was afraid,
 I looked out the window and nobody was there.
 And then as soon as I sort of stepped away from the window,
 I felt, I didn't see it, but I felt Jesus
 just stepped through the door.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And I was like, that was Jesus.
 He walked by the window and he just stepped
 into my apartment and it wasn't audible,
 but it was just as powerful.
 I felt the Lord speak to me and say,
 "In six months, you're gonna be dead or in prison
 unless you come home to me right now.
 And that's what I heard.
 And that's how I got saved.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>That would do it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So what did you do?
  </li><li>So I ran to my cabinet and I grabbed a bunch of cocaine, flushed it down the toilet.
 I called my friend who was like keeping all of my drug money.
 And I was like, "Hey man, I'm out.
 Bring me my money tomorrow because I'm moving back home.
 I just got saved and I'm going to be a good big brother and a good son."
 That's what I told them, exactly.
 Because I was basically estranged from my family.
 Of course.
 I mean, my family and I, we didn't talk at all.
 They must have been heartbroken.
 Yeah, completely disconnected.
 You know, I have three little brothers.
 I was not in their lives for years, five years, just completely absent.
 My parents, I never came home.
 I mean, I always made it back for like Christmas dinner, you know, but I was so high.
 I don't remember them.
 You know, cause I would be like using heroin, like shooting up and stuff.
 So I have these spaces of my life that I don't remember a lot of detail.
  </li><li>Holding mother of Pearl, I did not know any of this.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That's hardcore.
  </li><li>It's very hardcore.
 Yeah.
 I mean, there were times I definitely should have died because I overdosed on drugs.
 I mean, I did way more than you any human should be allowed to, but God kept me.
 So you return home or turn home?
 What do your parents do?
 They're freaked out because my mom had kicked me out of the house three or four times already.
 Like she'd pack up my clothes and throw them out on the front porch and just say, get out.
 My dad always let me back in though.
 So your dad's the big softy.
 Yeah, he was the softy.
 Yeah, so at first my mom was skeptical.
 She was like, I don't know about this.
 Are you going to steal dad's golf clubs again and pawn them for drugs?
 Because I've done that twice.
 Oh, gosh.
 Yeah.
 So you basically owe your dad some golf clubs.
 Yeah.
 Well, he got him back.
 Yeah, he still has him.
 But still.
 Yeah, that's pretty bad, isn't it?
 Yeah, I know.
 One time I did it though so that I could buy some food.
 Then that's okay.
 So, you know, justifiable.
 It's possible, though, if you'd asked your parents for money to get food, they would've
 fed you.
 Gladly.
 Gladly.
 So, anyways, I came back home and my parents started to disciple me, actually.
 It took a couple of weeks, but I think they understood that I was very serious right away
 because my disposition had changed the way I talked, changed, the way I did life changed,
 the way I dressed, changed.
 I mean, everything about me was different from that moment when God told me I had six
 months.
 Like, everything.
 Like, I know that some people, you know, getting saved, there's a transition over time
 and a healing that comes and deliverance from drug addiction and all that.
 I had it in that second.
 I had it in that moment.
 Like, I stopped using drugs.
 I didn't have any adverse reactions, no withdrawals, nothing.
 Everything was just different about me from that moment on.
 So every night my mom would cook dinner,
 we'd eat together as a family,
 and then afterwards my dad and I would watch TDJ's DVDs,
 and I would ask him questions.
 He would hit pause and answer them,
 and that's how I got discipled.
 God bless us.
  </li><li>I'd worship TDJ's.
  </li><li>Yeah, I wrote him a letter once.
 I don't know if he saw it, but.
  </li><li>He's probably listening to podcasts right now.
  </li><li>He probably is.
  </li><li>He's a big fan of us.
  </li><li>Bishop.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>My favorite story, which must be happening
 around about this time is when you discover Heidi Baker.
 Yeah.
 Tell me how you discovered Heidi Baker.
 It's an interesting story because I discovered her.
 A friend of mine gave me a CD and she said, "This is Heidi Baker.
 I put it in and all she did was laugh for 45 minutes."
 And I thought it was terrible because I was like, "She can't preach at all."
 She's a terrible preacher.
 Just as an aside, did you ever have a problem with women preachers?
  </li><li>Oh, was that like?
  </li><li>Not really.
  </li><li>Oh, so that wasn't part of my experience.
 I mean, we rarely had women preachers.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But it wasn't a stumbling block.
  </li><li>No, not really laughing.
  </li><li>It was the laughing.
 I was like, what is this?
 You know, this is not like what I've learned about,
 you know, so far.
 So, but there was like something on it.
 Like I listened to it for 45 minutes
 and then by the end of the tape, like I was laughing.
 And I was wanting to have that experience with Jesus.
 I was like, whatever she's got a hold of, I want it.
 I don't know what it is, but I need that.
 So, but I only had that one CD and I listened to it a bunch,
 but then I went over to a youth group to preach there
 and a pastor had a VHS tape of Heidi Baker in his library.
 And I said, oh, I just heard about this lady.
 Heidi Baker, can I use that?
 Can I borrow it?
 And he was like, I don't even know who that is.
 The pastor who was here before me left it, you can have it.
 So I took it, it was a video of her preaching
 at an Awakened Deborah Conference
 in Brownsville, Pensacola.
 So it was a ladies conference.
 (laughing)
 And I watched it like, I think like 15 times
 in just, you know, few weeks.
 I mean, like I watched it every night and I cried.
 Because for me, I was so fascinated by Heidi.
 I was like, okay, like here's a woman
 who's willing to die for what she believes in.
 Like she's willing to die for Jesus.
 And this is so appealing to me.
 I want to live my life like her.
 And so I would sit on my couch
 and I would weep watching a women's conference
 every night by myself.
  </li><li>So what happened then?
 So you now know of Heidi.
  </li><li>Yep, I know of Heidi.
 So I look up, you know, her online
 and I find out that she has a harvest school.
 Same friend who gave me the CD
 encouraged me to go to it
 because she said that she was going to.
 She didn't and I was praying around that time
 about going to join an internship or to go to the harvest school.
 I ended up going to the harvest school and, you know, that's how I got
 introduced to high risk was in 2008 going to harvest school number eight and
 PIMBA. So, so what does harvest school look like? Like to give us an idea?
 I mean, PIMBA, when I went there for harvest school eight, yeah,
 harvest school eight. Yeah, I think that's what it was or nine. I can't remember
 But anyways, like I got there I was taken to my dorm room where I bunked with five other
 Filthy gentlemen they were just nasty they had been there a week already
 And so I was like a week late getting there and so none of them had showered in three days
 There's red dust covering my bed, you know, I roll out my
 Sleeping bag and I'm like I am going to hate this I look at my watch and I'm counting down the days
 For when I get to leave I'm I set my watch I'm like 82 days
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause I was like,
 I definitely don't wanna be here.
  </li><li>'Cause you're literally living in the dirt
 among the poor.
  </li><li>Yep.
 And I always liked kids
 and I always wanted to work with children,
 but I was like, I'm not ready for this.
 This is gonna be terrible.
 It's so hot, there's no AC.
 I didn't have a fan.
 You know, the practicals that just suck
 about being in Pemba.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, the food is terrible.
 I mean, sorry, Iris,
 but the cafeteria food at that time was garbage,
 except on like chicken night,
 which happened like twice the whole time I was there.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You had chicken advice.
  </li><li>See, this is why when people invite me
 to go up Mozambique I go, no thank you.
  </li><li>No thank you.
  </li><li>Yeah, well I have a friend Lyle, he'll go.
  </li><li>You know what's funny though, I drink so much Coke.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Well that's pure health food right there.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
 I think I only bought like,
 They were concerned about me at the end of school because this was before I drink water.
 Because I grew up in the farming community. Nobody drinks water.
 Right.
 We drink sweet tea.
 Right. Like a good southern boy.
 Right. We didn't drink water. You know, my dad's old assistant. She hadn't drink water
 in three years one time. She drank Mountain Dew.
 Oh, that's horrible.
 So, it's my favorite part of the podcast.
  </li><li>Okay. - So I just drank Coke.
 And the whole time I was there,
 I only bought one box of water, which was 10 waters.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>In 82 days? - Yep.
  </li><li>You know, the life of drugs
 probably prepared your constitution for Pamba.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And Coke. - And Coke.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>You just malnourished. - Right, yeah.
  </li><li>And what is, you know, was it what you thought it would be?
 Or was it horrible? - At first it was horrible.
 Like, were you expecting?
 Like, I remember coming to Toronto,
 and I'd heard about Heidi's test when it Toronto,
 you know, burnt out, ready to quit the ministry,
 God touches her, and she goes back and starts revival.
 And I remember coming to Toronto,
 looking for a touch like that,
 and so utterly disappointed when nothing like that happened for me.
 And I would imagine probably you weren't going to
 Pemba Mozambique for vacation.
 You knew what you're getting into,
 so there was a level of sacrifice,
 and I would imagine days go by and you're like,
 I'm not getting it. I'm not getting it. Is that right or am I just? Absolutely. Okay.
 And a lot of students have that experience because Pimba is so
 admissions romanticized. You read books like there's always enough,
 which Heidi wrote or compelled by love or you watch the movie and you're like,
 when I get over there, I'm just going to raise the dead.
 I'm going to heal the blind, the deaf.
 I'm going to speak to that lame guy and he's going to get up and take his mat and
 walk. You know, this is going to be my experience.
 And for me at the time, I'd become a youth pastor.
 So I was used to having experiences like that.
 When I got over there, 'cause I grew up in a costal.
 So like the power of God and signs and wonders,
 like I was very familiar with that as a child.
 Like I knew about Holy Spirit.
 So when I got over there, of course,
 I'd read Heidi's books too,
 but I had familiarized myself with that lifestyle
 to an extent.
 It was like, okay, I believe in healing.
 But there were other people, students who were there,
 they were like, I've never seen a miracle.
 So I came to Pimba because I want to see a miracle.
 And for me, I was like, oh, that's easy.
 Let's just go find somebody to pray for
 and see a miracle right now.
 Like we don't have to wait on how did he get here.
 So yeah, there was like a revelation of that.
 But when I got there, I prayed for people
 and nobody got healed.
 Ever.
 (laughing)
 Ever.
 It was terrible.
  </li><li>That's a great season of life, isn't it?
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
  </li><li>I love that.
  </li><li>Yep, my mom had given me a necklace before I left
 and I looked it up online
 'cause it was a certain type of cross.
 And it was known as a prophet's cross.
 And at that time, I remember a lot of people like,
 you're a prophet, you're a young prophet, you know?
 And I was like, yeah, I am, you know?
  </li><li>'Cause I believe you nominate yourself
 for the prophetic
 Because you're nobody except for who I tell you are, tell you you are and you are a servant
 to humanity.
 And that was what I heard from the Lord like the first week I was there.
 And so every day I just spent with my face in a grass mat crying and snotting all over
 the place.
 And that's because I was miserable because everything I knew about myself and I knew
 about God was being as we like to call an iris wrecked, ruined, destroyed, everything
 that I was standing on was gone.
 I have some favorite stories that you've told me over the years.
 Come on.
 And I don't want to make you tell stories you might not want to.
 I don't care.
 But one of the stories I love was you were in, correct me if I'm wrong, but you were
 in a small group session.
 At one point we'll hide you in some of the other students.
 And it was kind of a debrief.
 Has everyone doing?
 What are you feeling?
 Yep.
 And you'd hit kind of rock bottom.
 Yeah, that was a few weeks in and at that point I was pretty miserable
 Pretty concerned that my quote unquote healing anointing wasn't manifesting
 so
 she's going around the room asking everybody how you doing and
 I was nervous because I knew she was coming around to me and so I was like do I lie to her?
 Because I'm sure that's what everyone else has tempted to do when Heidi Baker asked you how you're doing
 Or do I tell her the truth?
 So I decided to go with the truth
 Which I figured might get me in trouble, but at least it would be honest and so when she got to me she said
 Hi
 what's your story and
 You know how she does and I was like well, my name is lau. I'm a youth pastor in Kentucky and I hate it here
 And you know I see you've been to the Alan Jones school of graces right
 She just looks at me with this concern face and she's like, "What's going on?"
 Tell us, share with us your heart.
 What's going on in your heart?
 And so I'm like, "Well, I've got to be honest with you.
 I'm a youth pastor.
 I've got it together.
 I'm in ministry.
 Like there are people who I'm responsible for.
 I've got to look out for them.
 And everything that I thought I knew about God prior to coming to this school has been
 destroyed. I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I don't know how to do ministry. I don't know
 what I believe about Jesus right now. Like I just feel messed up and my only prayer is that God
 puts me back together again before I leave this place in like 72 days because I had a countdown
 going and you know the room was completely silent because up to this point everybody had given her
 favorable response to what's your story? And so I was a little afraid and everybody was
 looking to see what would happen. And so I'm just looking at her because I'm nervous.
 And then I noticed that this tear starts to form in her eye, just one eye and it just
 starts trickling down her cheek. And I'm like, okay, I'm good. Like she's not mad at
 me. But I have no idea what she's going to say right now. And instead of saying anything,
 She just got down off the couch where she was sitting.
 She crawled on her hands and knees across the entire room, crawled right over to me,
 grabbed me by the neck and leaned in to whisper in my ear, "Blessed are you, son,
 when you're poor in spirit, for yours is the kingdom of heaven."
 And then she leaned back and looked me dead in the eye and she said, "God's never going
 to put you back together again."
 And that's why it's one of my favorite stories.
 That's the day I became an iris missionary.
 Because in that moment I was like, I'll do anything for this woman.
 Because I felt so seen and so heard and she was so unoffended by me being real, which
 was not my experience in ministry at all.
 As a pastor, you have to keep it together.
 know, I'm this great man of God. I don't have problems. But, you know, I risk it. I was like,
 I'm going to be vulnerable. Wow. So what happened after that? Like by the time you go to the end of
 the school, where was your heart? Where was your vision? Where was your life? I was like, I can live
 here forever. Really? Yeah. I mean, my heart had completely changed. I mean, I did want to go back
 home. I was excited about going back home and seeing my family and my church family and sharing
 with them everything that I had received, but I was so pumped on loving the poor that
 I would have stayed in Mozambique, gladly.
 But I went back home and I thought to myself, you know, I'll probably never come back here.
 But I did go to Reading to hear Heidi speak.
 I was invited to go out there by a friend of mine, her name is Shara.
 And she really felt that I should meet the people from Jesus culture and get connected
 with Bethel.
 And so at that time, of course, like a lot of young people, I was so inspired by the
 ministry of Bethel and Jesus culture that I was like, "Yes, absolutely.
 I'm going because I'm going to connect with Bethel and I'm going to move to Bethel and
 I'm going to be a part of the church and ministry there and ready."
 And that was my plan, honestly.
 When I left Pimba, that was my plan.
 She had also wanted to connect me with some campus ministries there and she really felt
 like it would be a good connect.
 So I went out there, the same weekend that Heidi was there.
 Jesus culture was out of the country,
 the girl that I was supposed to connect with
 from their campus ministry was sick with the flu,
 and Shara couldn't make it out to Reading
 because that was the weekend that Jill Austin passed away.
 And so she was in Kansas City with the funeral arrangements.
 And so everybody that I came out there to meet
 couldn't meet with me.
 So here I was in Reading all by myself.
 No one, I was with no one.
 I was just staying with a host family that I didn't know.
 And my whole plan in going out there was to connect with Bethel Church.
 And I was like, I'm going to move to Reading.
 But God had a different plan because I came out there to connect with Bethel and I ended
 up connected with Iris.
 Wow.
 I don't know how Heidi even knew anything about me.
 I mean, I was just a student.
 We had never formally met.
 But she was like, oh, I heard some students were here in Reading.
 Invite them up to my house because we're having a party.
 So this is years after you've graduated?
 No, this was like a month afterwards.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 So, you were on school eight or nine, there's many, many students.
 You're just one of a sea of faces.
  </li><li>Tons, yep. - Right.
  </li><li>Yep. - So at this point, you don't have a personal relationship with my baby.
  </li><li>Absolutely not. - Apart from her whispering your ear,
 you making her cry, that's it.
  </li><li>That's it. - And you're just one of hundreds of people who've done the harvest school.
  </li><li>Yep. - And you're in Reading, and she says,
 "Come up to my house in Reading, we're going to go party, and then we'll have it."
  </li><li>So I go up to her house in Reading, and basically it's like this holy ghost hoe down.
  </li><li>I'm sure it is. - Yeah.
  </li><li>I'll be with line dancing.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was wild.
 I mean, everyone was underneath the kitchen table.
 That's what I remember.
 I came in and people were just manifesting and going crazy and it was like, "Holy spirit,
 just house party."
 Right?
 And everybody's praying for each other.
 Nobody was having a normal conversation.
 It was just like prophesy over each other.
 You know?
 Which I thought was amazing.
 I was like, "This is great."
 Kind of like Pimba.
 And Iris Global's board was there.
 So, I was like, "Oh, I'm going to go to the kitchen table."
 And Iris Global's board was there.
 So Chris Valton was there and Mel Tari was there
 and like missionaries from China.
 So it was awesome, you know.
 But it was there up there on that mountain
 and redding at her house that I was like,
 you know, this is my tribe.
 You know, I came out here because I wanted to move
 to be a part of Betha, which is an awesome ministry.
 You know, I go to Betha every year.
 But God was like, no, I want you to connect with Iris.
 I don't want you to, at least in that season of life,
 I want you to work with the poor.
 I want you to be a missionary.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So while I was there, I listened to Heidi speak
 and she was preaching and she said,
 okay, you know, I wanna have an altar call.
 And the first thing she did was call witches and warlocks.
 That's real, she did do that.
 She had an altar call for witches and warlocks.
 So I was like, okay, this doesn't apply to me.
  </li><li>This is the main church now.
  </li><li>Yeah, Beth. - Okay, not at her house.
  </li><li>Yeah, no, no, no.
  </li><li>I was like, "What?"
  </li><li>So this is, she's now preaching a weekend service at Bethel.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And she's doing an altar call for which is normal.
 Which is normal for her in Africa, I'm sure.
  </li><li>Yeah, and so normal in California.
  </li><li>Not so normal there.
 And I was thinking, "Well, hey, you know,
 "I've heard how to you a million times.
 "I'm just gonna get myself, I'm gonna go.
 "Like, let somebody else, you know,
 "receive ministry, I guess, in the altar."
 But I thought to myself,
 "But if she says anything about working with children,
 I'm going to go up because I'm feeling like this weekend God's really marking me
 With a specific purpose and that is to work with the poor and work with children
 So if she says anything about that, I'll go up so after she finished her altar call for witches and warlocks. She said
 If there's anybody in here who feels called to work with children
 Specifically, I want you to come up because I want to pray for you and I want you to come over to this side of the stage and
 I was walking out the door out the door at the time
 So I was like I have to go she said exactly what I just prayed about so I'm gonna go up to the front
 So I went up to the front
 But I but I got in the back of everyone because I was thinking hey
 I've been in Pemba with Heidi for three months like she's prayed for me a bunch of times
 somebody else can get prayer and
 she just walked right back to me and
 You know started praying for me and it was in that moment. I mean I was just weeping but God spoke to me and said
 You gonna help Heidi get the million kids and so I told her that I was like she you know, of course
 She didn't know me really but I said hey
 God spoke to me and said that I'm supposed to help you rescue million kids and she was like oh, that's great honey
 And walked away. That's all she said
 She's in the middle wonder how many times so people have said stuff like that to her and then yep
 It's you know, she's never seen them again and that I was thinking that when I said it to her
 But then when I showed up showed up the very next summer in Pemba, she was like you meant it oh
 Because she remembered it oh
 I love that and I was like yeah, I'm here to help you get the million kids
 So in the meantime, I have to mention this I started Mercy 29
 So between the school I went to and the school I came back to
 It's about six months right so in that six month period. I had started Mercy 29
 I started working with a staff member there in Pemba to help them with a project that was going on outside the base
 Which was to help?
 Semi orphan children and their disabled grandmothers
 in a home that the goal was to be a self-sustainable home and to start an after-school program for the village and
 So that was the project that Mercy 29 took on as its first project because my logic was well as an organization
 I will help these kids that Iris is taken care of and that will enable them to help more kids
 Right, so how do you obviously found out about that?
 Once I arrived at the second school
 Because they're like oh, there's this kid who says he feels called to help you rescue million kids and he started a nonprofit
 Organization and he's helping the staff member with this
 You know house for disabled grandmothers and their semi orphan grandchildren
 which on the spectrum of sexy things to do in the kingdom,
 you know, you know,
 ministering to the nations,
 only go for vival,
 right, raising the dead,
 children in another country with disabled grandmothers,
 not that sexy.
 Not really.
 No, but that's what you went after.
 Yeah, that's where we started.
 And you know, I love those guys.
 I say that as a credit to your heart.
 I don't I mean that to mock.
 No, no, no.
 I just mean most people.
 I've met who want to be in ministry.
 Think up here rather than the least of these yeah, I think that's really unfortunate because I think the real riches are with the poor
 But that's the iris talking. Oh, it's right. It's the jesus talking. Mm-hmm. And that's one of our core values
 Which is we believe that revival begins with the poor
 But that includes the pouring spirit
 Right so that can be anybody you know from here to tennessee to tanzania, you know
 I remember speaking to somebody and I said, what do you want to do?
 He said, I want to be a pastor of a large mega church.
 I was like, that's great.
 What are you doing towards that vision?
 He's like, I'm waiting for God to give me the mega church.
 I'm like, you're not a cell leader in your local church.
 You don't have something.
 Something's like, I know, like no concept that you would start something and
 call it breathe on it and it would explode or learn to be faithful in something.
 Come on.
 Yeah.
 So you show up.
 Why did you go back to a second school having just finished the first school?
 Staffing it.
 Yeah.
 So I applied to staff.
 Okay.
 And it worked out because the guy who was leading that ministry with the grandmothers,
 he was actually on furlough. So he allowed me to lead it in his place the entire time I was on
 staff. So I was doing two jobs. I was staffing the school, which was from about 8 a.m. to 2 p.m.
 and then a lot of times we had night services. So I had to be at those as well. But I would get up
 Around dawn, I would go over to the home and, you know, wake up the kids, get them ready for school,
 hang out them, maybe eat breakfast, then I'll go to the school. Once the school is over the
 harvest school, I would come back to the house, eat lunch with the kids, take a nap there with them
 because they had like this big, like community space, like a big marble floor or whatever.
 And so I would just sit there with all the kids. I'd just go to sleep because the grandmothers would
 feed me and their food was way better than the cafeteria food.
 And I would hang out there with those kids and those grandmas until we had our night
 service and then I would go to the night service.
 So you know, it was amazing because my life was so changed, but I really was, I mean,
 quote unquote, working, you know, for like 15 hours a day.
 Oh, yeah.
 But it was awesome.
 Like I never felt tired.
 Like, honestly, I really didn't because so much of my time was spent like in worship
 in prayer at the school.
 So it felt so fulfilling.
 I didn't want to leave again the second time.
 But you did leave.
 But I did leave, yeah, because I came back to the States to help my parents and their
 church in Kentucky in that same farming community where there was a genuine move of God happening,
 which was amazing, but also to continue Mercy 29 and eventually go to India because I had
 heard about the 1.2 million child prostitutes that were in India because a news report on
 on CNN and based upon all that we had learned at the Harvard
 School, I was like, we have to go there.
 Hold on.
 You're watching CNN and a news report comes on about 1.2
 million children and prostitution in India.
 And you're thinking, that's not right.
 Yep.
 I have to do something about that.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 So then what happened?
 That was how I got called to India, profit CNN.
 So then what will happen?
 So basically I went on a manhunt for a connection in India because at the time I didn't know
 anybody and I didn't know anybody from I rest that was working there.
 But I had a Facebook friend and so we had been Facebook friends for quite some time,
 probably a year and I stayed friends with him because he never asked me for money.
 I don't know if you guys have ever received emails from like pastors from Pakistan or
 India.
 Oh, yes.
 Many.
 Yeah.
 It's like, hey, come over.
 We want to have fellowship with you.
 And then here's our routing number.
 And here's our monthly expenses.
 So I would always delete those emails.
 I mean, God bless those people, but I wanted to do something that was more relationally
 oriented.
 And this guy never asked me for money.
 So I thought he's probably a cool guy.
 So I Facebook message him and I said, hey, man, you know, we've been friends on Facebook
 for a year, we've exchanged a few messages.
 I knew that he worked with children, and I told him about my heart to rescue children
 from prostitution, and I asked if he knew where there were any children that were prostitutes.
 And he got back to me in a few weeks and he said, "I know a place.
 It's about eight hours from where I live, but I think if we go there, we can rescue some
 kids."
 So after that, we started a fundraiser and...
 I love how you tell us some matter of fact.
 It's how it happened.
 I mean, I made a movie on iMovie
 from pictures like Getty Images about India
 and I just put some statistics and then I said,
 "I need 250 people to give me $100 a piece
 "so I can go to Indian Rescue Children
 "from child prostitution."
  </li><li>And you had no training, no planning.
 What was your plan to show up with money and buy children?
  </li><li>That was the plan.
  </li><li>Okay, so-- - Probably a dumb plan,
 but that was the plan.
  </li><li>That was a plan.
 So your friend found a place eight hours away
 that sells children for prostitution.
 You've made a movie on iMovie, and do you raise the money?
  </li><li>Only 100 people gave me $100.
 So I had $10,000.
  </li><li>So you fly to India?
  </li><li>With my mom.
  </li><li>'Cause your mom is just amazing.
  </li><li>She was like, well, if you're going, I'm going.
  </li><li>So you and your mom fly to India.
 To, do you tell the story?
 I'm just in shock.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's what happens.
 I mean, we go over and we meet this guy.
 you know, that we knew on Facebook.
 And he took us around.
 We visited some churches, we preached.
 But, you know, our goal was rescue kids
 from child prostitution.
 So we went to a place that just south of Hyderabad, India,
 which is right Bullseye Center in the nation of India.
 And we went to a place where kids were being used as slaves
 and as prostitutes to work all day in granite,
 slate rock and marble mines.
 and then at night, used as prostitutes.
  </li><li>How old are these kids?
  </li><li>Anywhere from four to five years old to,
 you know, 14, 15, but there's older kids too,
 and there's older people working in there,
 like we met grandmothers in there
 that had been working their whole lives.
 And we said, "Hey, can you leave here if you want to?"
 And they said, "No."
 He said, "So your slaves?"
 "Yes."
 "Do you wanna leave here?"
 "No."
 I know nothing of the outside world.
 That's what they told us.
 I just want to be here.
 This is my life and this is what I know.
 So they've been working there since they were kids.
 Which is pretty wild.
 So when we got there, we met a few kids,
 three kids to be exact that first time.
 Maybe some others, but three kids that we really interacted with.
 There were more kids there.
 They told us there were hundreds of kids there,
 but you don't always see those kids.
 And we have video and stuff like that
 of kids that are working there in mass.
 But when they see people coming in, they see cameras,
 they start hiding kids and trying to make sure
 you don't get to places where their family's working
 and stuff like that.
 And so we met three kids.
 They didn't know how old they were.
 The first girl that we met specifically,
 she had no idea how old she was.
 Her story was that she had three older sisters
 that had all been sold into that place with her.
 They had all committed suicide because of what they
 were suffering in there.
 And, you know, she was contemplating the same fate.
 She was like, I think I'm gonna kill myself.
 I would say she's probably 12.
 That'd be my guess.
 And so she talked to us a little bit.
 She was really afraid of me, you know, of course,
 'cause of her experience.
 So like, you know, no physical touch or anything.
 She just sort of stood at the distance.
 But we did get to ask questions.
 And, you know, she said, yeah, I wanna leave here.
 So I gave her my word.
 I said, no matter what it cost,
 we're going to get you out of this place.
 And that's how we started.
 You know, with that $10,000,
 I was like, no matter what it takes, I'll get you out.
 And I had no idea because my friend,
 he had told me the Indian pastor,
 he said, oh, I bet it'll take like 500 bucks.
 So we offered 500 bucks to the people who were overseeing
 that mind and they laughed at us.
 And then they threatened us.
 They said, never come back here.
 We don't want Christians here.
 We don't want people talking about Jesus.
 You cannot buy this girl for $500.
 You cannot buy this girl for $5,000.
 So that was a bummer because we were like,
 well, we gave her our word and we only have $10,000.
 So, you know, I guess we can give all of it to this guy
 if that's what he wants.
 That's what we came here for.
 This isn't my money.
 And after a week or so, we ended up getting two children,
 I think it was like $7,500.
 that was the negotiated price for their freedom.
 It was like $7,500.
 So that was where we started, but fortunately,
 it opened up the door to a relationship
 with these pimps and slave owners.
 And that's really the testimony.
 I mean, not to disregard what God did
 with that one little girl,
 but because of the slave owner coming to Jesus,
 which eventually happened months later.
  </li><li>Wait, wait, wait, wait.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So how do you get there, Lyle?
 So you're told on another circumstances return, you're threatened.
 We're never going to say this girl.
 We don't want to do it.
 Christians do not come back.
 Right.
 Big scary people.
 They are slave owners and the lost two children.
 So their moral can compass is a little off.
 Yeah.
 I saw an auction once, which was pretty intense.
 You know, I saw people auctioning off their kids and people buying them.
 And they'd kind of bring them up like you would.
 like you'd see all movies, like auction block.
 You know, and we would beg them not to sell their kids
 'cause we had no ability to stop them.
 We didn't have enough money to do anything about it.
 You know, they were selling these kids for thousands of dollars.
 So I was like, well, I could preach.
 I tried that once.
 And people seem receptive to what I said,
 but they still sold their kids.
 So it was...
  </li><li>So you're in distress,
 But obviously you go back to the place where you're threatened.
 Yeah.
 And when you said you got two kids for $7,500, was she one of them?
 She was. Yeah.
 So you got to keep your word.
 Got to keep my word.
 And what does she do when she got released?
 Man, that was a pretty wild experience because I don't think she believed us.
 So when we came through, it was pretty emotional.
 She doesn't know English obviously, but she knew how to say thank you.
 And that's all she said.
 She just kept repeating it over and over.
 She was crying, just saying, "Thank you, thank you, thank you."
 You know.
 So that...
 Where did she go?
 She went into one of the homes for children.
 That pastor was overseeing at the time.
 We took her to the hospital.
 We found out that she had HIV.
 And the doctor said, "Oh, she's probably got a month or so to live."
 Which is pretty intense, you know, after having pulled her out of that situation and
 everything.
 But she's still alive today.
 And how many years has it been since then?
 That happened in 2009.
 Wow.
 So...
 Sick.
 Yeah.
 This is unbelievable.
 Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
 I mean, I'd say it's one of my highlights of life.
 You know, because...
 I guess so.
 Yeah, you don't think about it when it happens.
 You know, and it's the temptation for anybody listening will be the same temptation that
 I had when I read Heidi's book because you're like, oh, that's so romantic.
 Oh, it's so sexy.
 You rescued a kid from human trafficking.
 Like you're awesome.
 But, you know, to be honest with you, I think the only reason that happened was
 because of the time I spent in Pimba miserable.
 Right.
 You know, and that's sort of my motto for ministry, which is brokenness on
 the breakthrough.
 And that's, that's sort of my, that's, that's my motto, man.
 Like that's why I think brokenness is a good thing, not to be resisted, but yielded to.
 And I try my best to practice that lifestyle because I know that brokenness in me is going
 to produce breakthrough in ministry, but not for the sake of breakthrough in ministry or
 obtaining some grand testimony, but because the people receiving the ministry will experience
 real love, divine love, supernatural love.
 that will lead to all kinds of awesome stuff.
  </li><li>How did you lead the slave owner to the Lord?
  </li><li>I didn't do it personally, but I had a hand in it.
  </li><li>How did he get saved?
  </li><li>Well, we go from being hostile
 and wanting none to do with Christians.
  </li><li>Yeah, he threatened us initially, like, I'll kill you.
 But, you know, I was thinking he's surely
 not gonna kill an American.
 Like he doesn't want that heat.
 And I mean, come on, I had drive-bys done on my house.
  </li><li>You're like, whatever dude.
  </li><li>You're not nearly scary enough.
  </li><li>My mom choked me out.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I have a drive by some Kentucky, I'm not scared.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I mean, you're small.
 Like, I know I'm small, but you're small too.
 Like, you're probably not gonna kill me.
 I mean, that was my thought.
 I was like, this dude's not gonna kill me.
  </li><li>But he did have a mind to bury you in.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Yeah, he did, he didn't like us at all.
 And, you know, for him, us preaching the name of Jesus
 was he would get in a lot of trouble for that
 from his temple, you know, from his friends.
 So what ended up happening was it was my stance
 that we should not prosecute him.
 Now I'll probably get into some trouble
 with the justice people out there,
 but my stance was we shouldn't prosecute him.
 And that's just what I felt like we should do.
 We should love him and hope and pray for an opportunity
 to love him more effectively in the future
 so that maybe we could end up with more children.
 And so that was something that was sort of new for me
 because it was a challenge to love the oppressor
 as much as the oppressed.
 And that's what I learned in that season.
 And so I was like, okay guys, let's not try to put them
 in jail, let's just love them.
 And let's just see what happened
 'cause love is gonna win.
 Like I just had this faith, like love is gonna win.
 And so what ended up happening was there was a hurricane
 that took place on the coastline of India,
 but it created like some terrible weather and flooding
 and mudslides and all this stuff.
 And it affected this guy in his minds.
 And he has all these slaves and all these families.
 And so he needed help feeding them
 and getting clean water to them
 so he could preserve his workforce,
 his cheap labor operation.
 And so rather than do it himself, he thought,
 well, heck, I'll call that charity up.
 Those people never tried to put me in jail.
 I bet they would help me feed these guys.
 And of course we did.
 And that's how we got away in with him.
 And he was like, wow, you mean you're really going to do this?
 You're like, of course.
 And we took money out of our own bank at the time.
 I think we had another $10,000 saved up and we used it all to help them.
 So we basically went broke helping a slave owner.
 I wish people could see your huge smile.
 Yeah.
 Because you know, there's a handbook for all of this.
 Right.
 Yeah, blue pen.
 Yeah.
 And so then what happened?
 counter-cultural man. Yeah. You know, but the cross is counter-cultural. I mean, we all want like
 this success thing. Like, oh, I want to be on top. I want to win the rat race, compete and compare.
 And something I find very fascinating, I won't preach long, but I want to say this,
 is that Jesus never offered paradise to anybody that valued money over everything,
 Success or personal happiness, but he did offer paradise to a thief on a cross which I think is interesting
 Because that's the way of Christianity, you know, it's so counterculture. It's the cross
 It's what everybody else considered to be a loss, but God said that's a victory
 And I think that's what happened with the slave owner because like organizations were advising us otherwise
 They're saying oh, this is a terrible idea. Don't give them all that money. He's gonna go back and he's gonna buy other kids with it
 And he probably did but eventually he showed us the village where he bought those kids from and he vowed to stop buying kids from that village and then introduced us to the village chief and we started projects there to keep those families.
 With money so that then that way they wouldn't have to sell their kids are an income.
 And then he start giving you other kids as well yeah he gave us over 400 when it was all said and done.
 A lot of kids.
 So you spent seventy five hundred on two and then ten thousand on four hundred.
 Kingdom economics.
 Come on hashtag.
 I have a question.
 Our listeners write in and they ask us questions and each week we try and do our best to answer them.
 That's awesome.
 But I've had a question that's been sitting in my inbox.
 I don't feel qualified to answer.
 But you're going to ask me the question.
 Well, I think that's correct.
 ridiculous. No, you're my pastor. I think that you have. So, A.G. and I never try and teach theory,
 and I don't have a theory of this. I mean, sorry, what I mean by that. Let me say it again.
 A.G. and I never preach theory. We try not to. So, I don't want to give an answer from a book or
 an answer from something I've read. If I don't know the answer, I don't know the answer,
 and I don't know the answers to this. This is from our friend Josh Ramsey. He said,
 when I read Paul's letter to Timothy and he says in 2 Timothy 3 12, "All that will live
 Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution." And Jesus says, "Blessed are those who are
 persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." How do I live that out?
 Is it just something to have in the back of my mind in case it happens, so I'm not caught off
 guard? Or is it something that should be evidence in my life as a believer? I know it doesn't simply
 mean to go out and seek out persecution. But at the same time, Paul and many of the New
 Testament writers seem to rejoice in their suffering and persecution, and it seemed to
 strengthen their faith somehow. 2 Corinthians 4 always intrigues me because it seems there's
 great fruit in their faith from suffering, but I'm not experiencing persecution or what I would
 consider suffering. Am I missing out in something? Or am I not living a godly life that somehow
 invokes that persecution? Granted, we live in a different time in the era and place than they do
 do where Christianity has been accepted and thankfully even celebrate for the most part
 in our country.
 But there seems to be a richness that comes to Paul's faith because of his suffering
 for the sake of Christ.
 That is an awesome question.
 And basically, what do you do with suffering?
 And I, when I say I don't have a theology for suffering, I don't mean I have prayed,
 fasted, researched all and at the end of it, I have come to a conclusion, I don't have
 a theology on suffering.
 I just mean, I'm ignorant to answer that question.
 Josh, awesome question, man.
 And I think he's on to something and I would encourage you to go further up and
 further in on that man, honestly, because the sermon on the mount, man, I think it's
 like a portal.
 You know, it's like the cross.
 It's like it's an introduction to real life.
 It's when you drop the script that's been handed to you and you start to read
 from the script of the kingdom. And in my opinion, that's going to involve resistance.
 I mean, yeah, sure, Jesus was persecuted, but I'm not sure that, you know, his disciples
 and he gathered around a table with a calendar and said, okay, here's the date that I would
 like to set for my persecution. Like life just made a way, you know, like life happens
 ups and downs like life makes a way for resistance and for failure and for persecution. And I feel
 like like, you know, what Josh is talking about is physical persecution, like violence. And man,
 we're so blessed to live here in America where we don't have to suffer for our belief in Jesus.
 However, if you start preaching and living a true gospel of the kingdom, not one of,
 I'm going to get political again, but Americanized consumer oriented entertainment driven Christianity, you will suffer some persecution.
 That might be gossip. That might be slander.
 That might be failure or losing social status, but you will be blessed because you will see the kingdom of God.
 That's a great answer.
 It's probably not everything that Josh is wanting to hear, but I think what one of the things that he was asking is, should I be looking for persecution so that I can live out this fruitful blessing?
 You're like, no, no, no, absolutely not.

 Well, do you think like to end the podcast, Lyle should wrap us out of the podcast?
 No.
 I think to end the podcast, we should have Lyle pray for our listeners and bless them.
 Can you wrap?
 Will pray in rhyme format?
 Okay.
 Come on, bring it.
 I don't actually think I can do that, but I could give it a shot.
 Thank you, Jesus.
 It's just so thankful to know you, God, and to connect with you on a deep, intimate, spiritual level.
 We want you to know us completely, and we want to know you completely, God.
 You are the desire of our heart, and you are the priority of our lives before anything else,
 before ministry, before work, or career, or money, or success, or fame. God, opportunity,
 You are our priority.
 And so I just want to say, God, I love you and I'm so proud of you.
 And you're the best.
 I love you Jesus so much.
 And I just ask you to just lay hands on every single person that's listening to
 this podcast and just release your heart into them and just release blessing
 and peace over them.
 God, I just pray complete peace on on everybody who's hearing this, that all
 anxiety would go, all fear would go, all feelings of needing to perform or, you know, get all
 these things done would go and that people would just receive peace. And Lord, for all
 those that have heard my testimony, which is really your story, God, I just pray that
 any impartation from that testimony, from that God story that could go to these people
 would find a home in their hearts and that they would know that this is more than inspiration.
 This is impartation from heaven and that they too can go out and they can do great stuff with you.
 They can rescue kids from human trafficking. I pray that over them, God, that you'd put an abolitionist
 anointing on people as they listen, that you would put a world changer anointing on people
 as they listen, a revolutionary anointing on people as they listen, God. And I just bless them
 in Jesus name with everything that I have to pray and bless them with everything that
 Heidi and Roland have laid hands on me and imparted to me.
 God, I just pray for just to be a conduit of blessing from my mom and dad and that
 all of them, everybody, every listener, uh, would receive that blessing richly in
 the name of Jesus Christ.
 Blah Phillips, we love you.
 Love you guys.
 Would you come back for another podcast?
 Oh man, I would absolutely love to do that.
 All right.
 We love you.
 Everybody.
 Have an amazing week.
 Bye.
 Bye!
 See you later!
