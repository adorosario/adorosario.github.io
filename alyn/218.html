<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 218 of Keeping Up with the Joneses,
 a weekly podcast made possible
 by the support of our wonderful patrons.
 This week, we wanna thank Catherine
 for making this episode possible.
  </li><li>Thanks, Catherine.
  </li><li>AJ Jones. - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>How the heck are you?
 I am good, finally recovered from jet lag, I think.
  </li><li>We've been off the air for.
  </li><li>A month?
  </li><li>Maybe three weeks, four weeks?
  </li><li>Yeah, a while.
  </li><li>And I felt really bad because remember before
 when I said everybody sick, but I escaped it.
  </li><li>He did not escape.
  </li><li>I was at the tail end and I got a flu.
 The week we were supposed to be flying out to Israel,
 I ended up in bed.
 Like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I had fever.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, you were sick for like four or five days, I think.
  </li><li>Of course we fly out.
 I did get better and I did want to record an episode
 before we left, but then my little MacBook Pro here,
 it's oh, an E-key, stop working.
 So I took it to the Apple Store to get repaired
 and the genius, God bless him, I appreciate it.
 He just said, look, we could replace it, oh, in the E-keys,
 but you'll be back here in a couple of months.
 We need to actually completely replace the top case.
 And I was like, if you replace the top case,
 you're gonna have to replace the SSD,
 hard drive because it's tied to the kind of fingerprint.
 You know for most people this is all like, yet issue, right?
 My point is SSD.
 It wasn't just a simple two key replacement.
 They basically gave me a branding machine and they screwed up.
 So took them two weeks.
 So I couldn't have recorded a podcast because I need this machine to
 anyway, we couldn't do a podcast because I was sick and then I don't
 have a computer and then we went to Israel.
 And that basically does our weekly catch up because this whole
 episode is about Israel. I kind of feel like I need to give you a heads up that if you're not into
 listening to people talk about their vacations this might not interest you. However, I had enough
 people come up to me and say when you're going to talk about Israel that I thought we'll put on
 a podcast and then you can tell us what you think. And it probably needs to be said that historically
 we're not the the Israel type. Did you know what I mean? Like the
  </li><li>No, no, no.
  </li><li>But you know how like there's some people
 that are like, I love Israel,
 and then there's like the I love Israel.
 And we're like the, I don't know if I love Israel
 'cause I've never been.
 So that was us.
  </li><li>You're talking about,
 you don't even love Israel in the nation.
  </li><li>Yes, yes, not the Jewish people of course,
 but just like, you know.
  </li><li>We just opened this one, bang.
  </li><li>You know what I'm saying?
 When I grew up, there was a guy on my street
 who was a Roman Catholic.
 And so we both believed in Jesus,
 but his expression, and by the way,
 "We're gonna fend the Jews, we're gonna fend the Catholics."
  </li><li>I'm sorry.
  </li><li>Anyway, my friend, he grew up as a Roman Catholic,
 and we both loved Jesus, but his expression
 of his love for Jesus looked nothing like my expression
 of my love for Jesus.
 And so, I'm not gonna try and speak for A.J.
 'cause I'm not sure what she's trying to say.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I've got lots of friends who like,
 I've always wanted to go to Israel,
 I've always wanted to walk where Jesus walked.
 And for me, that was never me at all.
 Not that I had anything against Israel,
 but my faith has never been about things or places
 or so while I was exceptionally grateful
 for a trip to Israel, it's never been a burning desire.
 But for you, it was a life during come true.
 Wasn't it?
 You've always wanted to go to Israel.
  </li><li>I've wanted to go for the last little while,
 just because I've met enough people, mostly at Grey Center,
 that had a passion for it,
 that I started to kind of catch something,
 but it wasn't until I had the dream that I was in Israel
 that I woke up totally confused.
 'Cause I-- - That would be
 a dream. - So I, well,
 I mean, the short version is I had this dream
 that I was planning a year two alumni trip in Israel,
 and I was in Israel in the dream,
 interviewing tour guides and coming up with like,
 We do this and where would we go and all that kind of stuff.
 And when I woke up from having the dream,
 I was totally confused how I was in my bed
 and I couldn't remember when I had flown home.
 Like it was such a vivid dream
 that I spent about the first five minutes awake,
 really confused as to how did I get my bed.
 And since having that dream, I started thinking,
 oh man, I really, really wanna go to Israel.
 I felt like I was there, like I could smell it and taste it and see it and now I want to go back.
 Right. Whereas I was like, "Oh, we're going to Israel." And God bless AJ. She planned everything.
 I mean, everything. I had this girl. Literally, nothing to do with the trip. People come up to
 be like, "It's said about Israel." I'm like, "I don't know what we're doing." Over like,
 "Where are you going?" Again, I don't know where we're going. So the day before we left,
 I just sat down with AJ and I just said, "Can you give me everything?" And let's put it in our
 calendar, so at least I know where I'm going. And then I bought a book on Amazon that told me where we
 like what Christian should see in Israel or something. Yeah. So what you're about to listen to,
 and if you're watching on the video, what we are about to see is our quick recap. It's not that
 quick. Our quick recap of Israel, of where we went, what amends to us. And it's probably easiest to
 to do chronologically. Yeah, so do you want me to start? Yeah, start, take it away. So,
 we horse flew in at Tel Aviv, but we stayed two nights in Jaffa, also known as Japa or Yafu.
 You just make that last one up? Nope. Okay. So, before Asia continues, this is what we did.
 Well, this is what she planned. So, Israel's a pretty small nation, like, really small, like,
 we drove the length of it in a day.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so we didn't want to do the tour bus thing,
 nothing against people who like to do tour buses.
 We do our kids with us.
 I wouldn't handle a tour bus, now mine my three kids.
  </li><li>Yeah, but the kids definitely wouldn't tolerate that.
  </li><li>So, as you basically did some research
 with some friends of ours who are really, really good
 at Israel stuff and worked out where the hotspots were.
 And then we booked three Airbnb's like here, here,
 and here, is that right?
  </li><li>Pretty good, yeah, pretty good.
  </li><li>And then using those little hotspots,
 we just drove out and did field trips.
 So the idea behind Tel Aviv or Jaffa or Jappa or...
 (laughing)
 What was the point of this?
  </li><li>Well, basically one of our friends had said,
 "Hey, just take a day or so to get acclimatized
 to being there, let the kids sort of recover
 from the flight, all that kind of stuff."
 And so that was the idea is to be in Jaffa
 and just be able to explore a little bit during the day
 but not have to go too far,
 go to bed when we need to go to bed, that kind of stuff,
 and not head north until we'd gotten a good night's sleep
 or two.
  </li><li>So, land of the airport, pick up a rental car,
 drive to Airbnb, work out some food, go to bed.
 Next morning, wake up, I'm honestly not gonna do day
 by day, I promise you.
 Wake up, go to the bakery, wander around.
 I have a clue what's in Joppa.
 So we're walking around, and I'm like,
 "Pib, where are we and why are we here?"
 And we get to this photo, we walked down by the beach
 and do you remember this little thing?
  </li><li>Yeah, so this is actually the old port of Jaffa,
 which is where Solomon brought in the cedars of Lebanon
 to build the temple through this particular port.
 And also Jonah got an abode to escape God and went to.
  </li><li>Torsesh. - Torsesh.
  </li><li>So she tells him that and I'm freaking out
 And suddenly, the magic of Israel hits me again, by the way, I spent my childhood.
 This is my, on Instagram, I was posting all my pictures of my sisters, like, "Oh my gosh,
 you've turned into mom."
 So as a child, my whole childhood, every summer, me and my three sisters would be dragged around
 Europe, which to American sense glamorous, to people who live in Europe is not that glamorous,
 especially when, you know, the six of you squashed in a Fier uno, you know, or a Fier
 a panda, this small scar.
 Anyway, I was dragged around Roman burial sites
 and one of those big amphitheaters and so I hated it.
 And so I've never been one for history,
 you did history, university, so you love it.
 But when Asia tells me that,
 and I'm looking at the place where Jonah the prophet came
 and tried to rebel against God,
 I'm like, I'm here where he was.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And something about that just freaked me out.
  </li><li>And then we also got to walk through old Jaffa
 the old city of Jaffa and see Simon the Tanner's house.
 And so there was like,
 there's a whole bunch of really cool things.
 I mean, we really didn't know where to go.
 So we did a lot of like backtracking
 and going forward and upping and downing stairs.
 And the kids were like,
 "Just give me another obstacle and I'll keep going."
 So yeah, it was, but it was really fun.
 It was an adventure.
  </li><li>And no, the book that we picked up did a great job
 of differentiating between what is a traditional site
 and what is a historical site.
 The difference being a traditional site is thousands of years have passed.
 Traditionally people have said this is where it is, but there's no archaeological or
 historical evidence to support this.
 But traditionally this is where people think it is.
 Versus historical sites where we know to a certain degree of certainty that this was
 the actual place that this event in the scriptures happened.
 So Simon of Tanner's house was a traditional spot, not a historical spot.
 Nevertheless, if you open up your Bible and you read about Cornelius having his vision and the Lord
 says, "Hey, go send people to Simon of the Tanner's house in Japa by the sea." You'll find a man
 called Peter and Tom will come back with you. That's the one where Peter goes up on the roof to pray,
 falls into this trance, sees the thing from heaven come back with all these unclean animals.
 And whether this was the actual spot or not, it was close enough for me to just be like,
 "Oh my gosh, that was the house. That could be the house where that happened."
 And I don't know, it did something for me. Yeah. Fricked me out. Was there wrong sense?
 Yeah, but it was mesmerizing. I think it was like just walking around. It was, I just kept going,
 "Wow, like, I think nothing was what I expected it to look like either." So, I mean, I just... Talk about
  </li><li>What about that?
 'Cause what did you think Israel was gonna look like?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, particularly, we haven't gone there yet,
 but particularly we went into the North.
 I didn't expect it to be green and less beautiful.
  </li><li>One of my questions was what did you think it would be like?
  </li><li>Desert.
  </li><li>Desert.
  </li><li>Like desert, rocky, ground, kind of scrubby bushes.
  </li><li>Not very well developed.
  </li><li>Not very, yeah, like, so I didn't expect what I saw.
  </li><li>And what you saw was?
  </li><li>Well, you know, it's a mix of really old,
 but well-kept, you know, like the old part of Jaffa,
 or the old city of Drew.
  </li><li>Well-kept.
  </li><li>Well-
  </li><li>Nothing is symmetrical in Israel.
  </li><li>Well.
  </li><li>There's nothing even-
  </li><li>But they've kept that part well.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I can get over the,
 (laughs)
 look at these like thousands of year old beautiful buildings,
 and then someone just tacks on on their conditioning unit
 and doesn't bother to hide the cables.
 So it's a very kind of pragmatic.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But the doors, remember the doors were amazing.
 We kept stopping and looking at the doors like wow.
  </li><li>Not one door the same.
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>So anyway, that was just cool to kind of hang out there
 and you were genius or whoever told you was a genius.
 We acclimated or climatized.
  </li><li>Yeah, and our luggage didn't come.
 So we bought some Israeli clothing.
 Yes, are you excited?
  </li><li>Yeah, we won't get into Israeli underwear.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>I think the into Israeli underwear.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>And got a shock, but.
 (laughing)
 Anyway, the next day or the day after, I forget when,
 we jumped in the car and we head north to Galilee,
 but we stop. - Okay, but wait,
 because we always talk in the podcast about food.
 Talk about the old man in the sea,
 that first restaurant that we went to in Jaffa.
  </li><li>So we're standing at an Airbnb, we ask the guy,
 like, where do we need to eat, what do we need to see?
 And he says, you need to go to the old man in the sea.
 And so we're like, okay, so it's a restaurant right.
  </li><li>Right in the old port.
 Yeah, you sit at a table and you could throw a piece of bread and there's the water.
 Yeah.
 So we sit down and it says, oh, you know, with your, with your meal comes 20 salads.
 I don't think a choice of 20 salads, 20 salads, like a big jar of lemonade, lemonade, by the way.
 It's like the national drink or something.
 Yeah, like as sweet as the south lemonade is to Israel.
 But it's really good lemonade.
 And so they bring out, I think we've got a photo somewhere.
 I'll show this photo of, they bring out these like mini
 saucers of right enough 20 different salads,
 all of them delicious.
 I'm gonna say salads, some of them were hummus,
 some of them were pickled.
  </li><li>Full of apples, like there's, oh okay,
 oh the full of apples at that place were so good.
  </li><li>Peter bread, and I ordered fish,
 'cause I thought if you're a restaurant
 by the sea should order fish.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Wasn't prepared for the bad day, it was just a whole fish.
  </li><li>With like the head and the bones and everything.
  </li><li>It's tossed on a fire.
  </li><li>There you go.
  </li><li>But in front of me I was like,
 I was happy in that moment I did not order fish.
 Yeah.
 And the next day we drive to Galilee, but before we get to Galilee, we stop off at Caesarea.
 Caesarea.
 There's two Caesarea.
 Caesarea, Caesarea Philippi up in the north, and then there's Caesarea, I forget what
 it's called, something with an M beside the ocean.
 Yeah.
 And that was where Cornelius was.
 Yeah.
 The aforementioned centurion.
 And so we drive to Caesarea and the significant thing about Caesarea, Paul was jailed there
 for two years when he appeared to appeal to Felix and it was jail for two years.
 Can you grip it?
 I don't know.
 Okay.
 Should have written it down.
 I don't know.
 I just wrote down Paul and prison there for two years.
 We'll look up.
 Okay.
 And but that whole thing was the brainchild of Herod.
  </li><li>Herod, yeah.
 So much of what we saw that is still standing
 or that they've excavated was built by Herod.
  </li><li>Herod the Great, he was the Herod
 that killed all the babies under two and Jesus was born.
 What I learned is this guy was plain psychopath
 but a brilliant architect.
  </li><li>Very insecure psychopath.
  </li><li>Oh, just not so, but a visionary
 and an astonishing architect.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So Caesarea, it has a, what did they call that,
 Hippodrome, it's the only Hippodrome
 that they've excavated.
  </li><li>And a Hippodrome is?
  </li><li>A Hippodrome is where they would have raced chariots.
 It's like a long oval kind of thing.
 And then they also have a huge amphitheater there
 that is, it's just, I mean, you're sort of standing there
 going, wow, it's huge.
  </li><li>So maybe think about the slaves who built it.
  </li><li>It's been really sad.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>I was out of breath walking up it,
 never mind carrying stones to build it.
  </li><li>I think what made me sad was more thinking about
 probably the Christians that were fed to lions
 and things like that.
  </li><li>Sure she out-satted me.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well I did, I mean I literally walked in.
  </li><li>You're not a composition.
  </li><li>I walked in and I thought,
 oh, like this would have started being used for entertainment
 and plays and ended up with a very different kind of
 entertainment. - What Christian
 from fed to lions for entertainment.
 So anyway, what is this picture I'm looking at?
  </li><li>That picture is still Caesarea on the right there
 where you can kind of see people in an outcropping,
 Herod built all of that
 and that's where his palace would have stood
 all the way out into the sea.
  </li><li>That was a cool thing for me
 and kind of a grim sort of reality
 was you're looking at an egotistical maniac's vision
 for building, you know, I mean, it's just this massive,
 he created something out of nothing.
 And it was just this, you know, wonder of the world,
 a big metropolitan hotspot and now it's nothing.
 And you see the hand of God, everywhere we went,
 we saw basically man's way of trying to accomplish something
 and God kind of like, okay, I mean, I guess.
 And then thousands of years later, it's come to nothing.
 And that was a repeating pattern that we spotted.
  </li><li>I mean, it is an amazing sight in terms of what they've
 been able to excavate is remarkable.
 and there's really complete Roman Bath.
 I mean, it's pretty impressive.
  </li><li>Okay, a common theme that you're gonna hear me talk about
 is the Legend of Zelda, which takes place
 in a fictional place called High Rule.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>They must have used like Roman ruins
 because everywhere we went, me and the kids were just like,
 let's go hunting for car ox seeds.
 This is just like this place here.
  </li><li>It does look like that, yeah.
  </li><li>But beautiful to go across, you know, to the Roman Baths
 and look down and you just see all the mosaics
 and thousands of years ago.
 Anyway, beautiful, what is this?
  </li><li>This picture is of a aqueduct
 where they would feed water from the north of Israel
 down into Caesarea.
 So it actually ran--
  </li><li>Swimming for the nation.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's at the very top of it.
 It's like a V and--
  </li><li>What are you?
 Yeah, it's sort of like a VSU channel.
 More of a U-S-V.
 Oh, okay, U-S-V.
 And apparently it's only like a one or two degree of a slant so that the water always
 just kept running, which is, I mean, it's amazing.
 Apparently it ran for, I think, 30 to 40 kilometers.
 And that's just a section of it.
 But that's a pretty miraculous thing.
 And so we were down in Japa, we drove up to Caesarea and then kind of over and north to
 Galilee.
 Talk about the Sea of Galilee.
 The Sea of Galilee is beautiful.
 It's not a sea though, it's a lake.
 It's a lake.
 It's not big.
 I thought it was going to be bigger.
 You can see it across it.
 Yeah.
 And when you're looking across, you're actually looking at Jordan.
 So it's like, wow.
 You know, it was super, super green.
 It was very calm.
 It was pretty calm every day we saw it.
  </li><li>I have a picture where it doesn't look,
 it looks kind of more gray there.
 The day that we went out on a boat,
 there's somebody there called Daniel
 and he takes you out on the boat
 and then he just sings live worship out on the boat,
 which was pretty cool.
 I was kind of, I took a lot of drone footage,
 I'll show you some drone footage.
 So I was kind of more interested in making sure
 my drone didn't land in the Sea of Galilee.
 But it was a pretty cool experience.
  </li><li>It was great.
 He's a believer and he's apparently the only believer
 that runs a boat onto the Sea of Galilee.
 So it's like a worship boat.
 And then he sings in Hebrew and in English
 and you sing with him and stuff.
 And we had communion out on the boat.
 And it was great.
 It was, I loved it.
  </li><li>Again, you're caught in like,
 have my kids drowned?
 Are they overboard?
 Wait, where's my drone?
 Wait, what's happening?
 Okay, we're doing communion.
 Wait, this is where Jesus walked on the water.
 There's so much stuff going on in your head space
 where you're trying to be in the zone,
 you're trying to appreciate the moment,
 you're also trying to get a good video or a good photo.
 I'm glad we went back to Sea of Galilee several times.
 I mean, we lived.
  </li><li>We went back by four days in a row
 'cause we just loved the Sea of Galilee.
  </li><li>We lived about 20 minutes away from the Sea of Galilee
 and we'd drive past all the time
 and so we stopped and took photos, lots.
  </li><li>I wasn't worried that the children had drowned
 'cause there's some railings
 and I wasn't worried about the drone.
 And so for me, actually, it was super peaceful.
 I loved it.
 I just, I couldn't get over,
 wow, this is what Jesus looked at.
 Like this, this landscape, this, I mean, I just,
 I don't know, the whole thing felt super surreal.
  </li><li>Must be so nice to not prioritize responsibility
 of your family.
 Love that.
  </li><li>Well, I did know where my family was
 and I didn't care about the drone.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>See, galley, yeah.
 I mean, it didn't even went out cloudy, but still cool.
 Shocked by how small it was.
 That was--
 Do you want to say your inappropriate comment?
 Well, don't.
 Uh-huh.
 Are you sure?
 I'm positive.
<strong>[LAUGHING]</strong>
 I was just shocked how small it was.
 Yeah.
 Again, when you drive around the Galilee area,
 it was-- Israel reminded me of a mashup of whales and of Iceland.
 Yeah, it's--
 Rolling Hills.
 Rolling Hills.
 and then some jagged cliffs and that kind of stuff
 and super green, lots of flowers and stuff.
  </li><li>The whole nation is hilly.
  </li><li>It's beautiful.
  </li><li>Up, down, up, down, up, down.
  </li><li>Beautiful.
 I mean, the whole time we're in the north,
 I don't know how many times a day,
 Alan and I would look at each other and go,
 "Did you expect it to be this pretty?"
 Like it was so pretty.
  </li><li>Really, really pretty.
  </li><li>Now I know they'd had tons of rain
 and we did go in March and not in the summer
 when it's dried out and I get all of that.
 Even with all of that, I just didn't expect it to be that green and that pretty.
 So we then spend five days, six days in the North.
 In the Galilee region.
 In the Galilee.
 Because we had a car, so everything we wanted to see up in the north part of Israel
 was super easy just to do a day trip and drive out to.
 And so that's the way our day would work. We'd wake up.
 Our bed and breakfast was on a vineyard with an orange grove
 and a lemon grove. And every morning our hosts would bring us freshly baked bread, freshly squeezed
 lemonade and a selection of homemade cheeses. And we would just... And all lives. And I was...
 Cinnamon rolls. We'd eat that. And then we'd plan our day and we'd drive out, see something, come back.
 Honestly, I would highly recommend the place that we stayed. It was amazing, wasn't it?
 Yeah, I'll put a link to it in the show notes if you're... I've actually collected a bunch of
 thoughts that we may or may not fully talk about, which I'm going to post on our website.
 I'll put a link to it where you can, when we were planning our trip, or when you were planning
 our trip, I tried to do some research, but it was all geared around people who were going to go
 on a tour bus, which is great. I could see why you'd want to do that. That would not appeal to me
 at all. So trying to find information on how to travel and like, what do you do about car hire
 and what about internet and this, that, and the next thing?
 Yeah.
 We kind of stress tested that for you.
 So we'll write that up and put a link in the show notes.
 So we're living in this beautiful, beautiful guest house,
 and then we're traveling out to different places.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We went-- sometimes we got places that didn't really
 feature in the Bible, or they nominally
 were featured in the Bible.
 One of the big places we went to was a place called Bech
 Sheann.
 Bech Sheann.
 Yeah.
 But the only claim to fame in scripture to pretty grisly one, it's where the dead bodies
 of King Saul and his son Jonathan were hung on the city wall.
 So that's because...
  </li><li>Cheery.
  </li><li>That's his claim to fame in the Old Testament.
 The reason we went to see it is the most complete.
 How did we put it?
  </li><li>Roman excavation, isn't it?
  </li><li>Bethgia National Park has the best preserved remains of an ancient Roman city in Israel.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That's why he went to see it.
  </li><li>And it is, it's remarkable.
 As somebody who's not interested in Roman ruins,
 here's what happened.
 You pay to get in and you kind of walk through
 the visitor center and it's all level ground.
 And then suddenly you get to the edge of a,
 not really a precipice, and suddenly in front of you
 is this valley, this vista of Roman ruins
 that are so complete it takes no imagination
 to see what it was like.
 And it was like going back in time.
 I was flabbergasted.
 I could not believe it.
 You're standing and it would take you to kind of turn your whole body to take it all in this big amphitheater
 There's a big main city square a big main road
 They would call the they call those main roads the Cardo didn't they because there's there's one in in
 Old Jerusalem as well and it be where they
 They would sell all their wares and have all their stores and all that kind of stuff so there it's it's
 Remarkable. I would have liked to spend there's the card. Oh there it is
 Yeah, that's the main street and on the right you'd have on the left you have these big pillars and behind those big pillars would be the shops
 Wherever you would go to this was the big amphitheater just to give you an idea
 That's do you see that green mound in the background there?
 You can't if you're listening to this bit if you're watching a video you can't that big green mound
 Remember in the Old Testament the Bible would talk about the high places
 That was the high places where people would go and make their pagan sacrifices. We walked all the way up that yeah
 And there's ruins up there as well. Yeah
 Yeah, as well as an Egyptian governor's house from when the area was taken over by Egypt.
 So there's lots of really cool stuff. There's also mosaic flooring that they found that you can
 see like ancient mosaic flooring. It's there, you know, it's it's remarkable. The other reason
 we went to see it was it gave you a understanding of what the gospel faced. So Beth Shan was the
 the lead city of the Decapolis, which was the 10 most influential Roman cities of the
 time.
 So here you've got some fishermen with a revelation of the Messiah and they're bringing that message
 into these Roman cities who are affluent, who've got everything, they've already got
 pagan gods.
 Yeah, they're designed to intimidate, aren't they?
 Oh, designed to intimidate.
 Like, you know, walking in and then here's these uneducated fishermen coming in and saying,
 "I got the answer."
 Yeah.
 And so it's amazing, just in natural terms, it's amazing that the gospel flourished in
 an environment like that.
 Yeah.
 That was really worth going to see.
 Yeah, it was.
 I loved it.
 Even though it didn't have really much biblical.
 Yeah.
 It just gave you a great perspective on what it must have felt like.
 So that was pretty cool.
 And then we did go to that little, that natural spring, which was...
 I swear, a slice of paradise.
 shocking again. Talk about that. That was amazing. So at the bed and breakfast that we were saying.
 I'm going to bring, keep talking. Okay. So at the bed and breakfast that we were staying at,
 there was another family there that was from Canada, I think. And they were saying, hey,
 have you gone to Betts' Chan? And we were like, no, what's that? So they were telling us about it.
 And we weren't even thinking of going there. And they said there's also this natural spring
 with these pools and all this kind of stuff that you can take the kids to.
 And we thought, okay, I mean, the kids would love that.
 Like the kids would love to go and swim and, you know, be in some sort of natural pools.
 And we arrive and it's like a garden oasis.
 Like there's palm trees everywhere.
 It's stunning.
 The water is like this aqua bluish greenish color.
 I mean, it was...
 Fish swimming.
 It was shocking.
 Fish swimming pools.
 It's all just natural fjords is the wrong word, but just naturally occurring hot spring
 pools with lush green grass and palm trees and
 And it's warming but it's not hot and it was just it was
 Technical garden that you can swim in and that's what it was like. Yes. It was out of this world
 I was like is this with a garden of Eden was like yeah
 It was through and then they had little fish that would eat your feet
 Yeah, well in the shallow areas like if you stopped these fish would come neat like the dead this stuff off your feet
 Which I could not take the feeling of it was awful who wouldn't come near my
 All I said on my feet are but the Israeli fish would not every time I stopped it would come near
 So you had to just sort of get into the deep quickly and then come back in or wear water shoes because otherwise they want to eat you
 And one of the things I've been asked the most is was there any places that you went which just totally?
 like kind of blew your mind. Yeah. And so this is where it blew my mind. So remember
 that passage in the Gospels that if I was smart enough I would have looked at
 them giving you a reference where it says that Jesus and his disciples entered
 Caesarea Philippi and Jesus turned to his disciples and said who do men say
 that I am and the disciples are like some say Elijah some say a prophet and he
 turns to them and says yeah but who do you say I am and Peter says you are the
 Messiah and Jesus like this is amazing and this was not revealed to you by man
 but my heavenly father and on this rock I'll build my church and the gates of hell will not overcome it
 We're familiar with that passage. Yeah, so I've grown up. I've heard that passage. Yeah, and I'm just thinking wow
 That's amazing and you know Catholics. That's where we get you know
 St. Peter because they think about the rock but completely different Greek word
 Petra versus pet Ross and had a big arguments about it and oh yeah
 We think about in terms of spiritual warfare. Yeah, the church gates of hell will not overcome it
 So we're thinking about that and we're driving up to Caesarea Philippi. I'm excited to go see it
 Which is which is called now if you were to go Benias, but it's Benias Caesarea Philippi
 So I'm reading my little book and
 Lo and behold, I mean this blows my mind first of all I need to show you a picture
 So do you see this rock and for people who are listening on the podcast?
 You don't have a picture in front of you what you what this picture doesn't really show is this a giant rock face
 Giant it's the side of a mountain and at the bottom of the mountain is a massive opening maybe
 I don't know 25 feet high 50 feet wide. Oh, yeah, at least just massive opening
 That opening has always been known as the gates of Hades or the gates of hell
 And it's where pagans would go make their offerings to pam
 The the god yeah, they throw children in there and see if they floated in all kinds of cheery things
 So that was known as the gates of hell.
 And in Jesus' time, what you're looking at here is just basically an open formation with still water.
 But in Jesus' time, there was 1500 gallons per minute, per second water,
 flowing out this huge torrent of water coming into this dark pool.
 This huge powerful thing, a very pink hole in this big rock that everybody in the region knew was the gates of hell.
 And so he's in this region, wherever he knows the gates of hell, and he's talking to them.
 And when Peter makes his declaration of who Jesus is, he's like, "Yeah, that revelation is amazing.
 And on that rock, and he's standing in front of, one might imagine, this massive rock face."
 And you get an idea of the size, the immovable nature of this rock to mount in.
 That's the strength of this revelation. It's steadfast. It's not going anywhere.
 And he says, "And even the gates of hell will not overcome it."
 And I'm just imagining the disciples looking at this torrent of water that could not be
 capped, that could not be stopped. And Jesus is using that as a teaching illustration to say,
 "Yeah, even the gates of hell will not overcome it."
 Yeah, they were saying that the pagans and the people of the day were fascinated
 by the amount of water that there's no place else that this sort of phenomenon was happening.
 And so it was almost like magical, otherworldly kind of thing.
 And he said...
  </li><li>They generally thought it was the gates to the other worlds.
  </li><li>Yeah, this powerful thing that you're looking at, even it's not going to prevail against.
 You know, it's just like...
  </li><li>What's interesting is in the years since Jesus and disciples were there, due to tectonic
 shifts, all of that water just dropped below, and now the water comes out as a waterfall
 underneath the ground, which you can see.
 And this, you're just looking at a dead, stagnant pool.
  </li><li>Nothing impressive.
  </li><li>The gate of hell is just this kind of one.
 nullified, musty, dead water.
 Yeah.
 And I just thought that wasn't lost on you either.
 So it got me thinking, how much else in the Gospels have I interpreted just as, I've added
 my own like kind of like Western overlay to what God was talking about when Jesus and
 his disciples were probably talking about very practical, literal things right in front
 of them. So for me, that was both the starting and scary because it was a pagan ritual site
 and you can see little altars all over the place.
 Yeah.
 And God.
 It doesn't feel great there.
 It feels...
 Then we also went up into the Golan Heights.
 I don't know how many pictures of this.
 Well, this is in the Golan Heights, technically.
 But we went up to Nimrod's Fortress.
 Yes, we did.
 Yeah.
 Nothing to do with the Bible, but just a really, really cool one.
 Really cool fortress did look a lot like Zelda.
 Lots of like dungeons and things that you can still walk through.
 It's an Iron Age, you know, medieval fortress.
 And it's pretty impressive actually as remains, you know, ruins go.
 After we visit that on our way home, we realized we nearly drove into Syria, which wouldn't be good.
 I mean, as I think you could accidentally drive into Syria, given the point of check.
 I'm pretty sure they'd stop us, but we were like, we were really cool.
 Probably going to throw stones into it, maybe.
 Okay. Nazareth, when Mary was expecting Jesus, Nazareth was a town of about 500 people.
 Well, I think he said 400.
  </li><li>Nazareth, the time of Mary's pregnancy,
 was a town of about 400 people.
 Point being really small, everybody knew everybody,
 kind of awkward that she's pregnant at a wedlock.
 So we thought we'd go to Nazareth.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Nazareth.
  </li><li>Well Nazareth now is quite a big city.
  </li><li>It's bustling.
  </li><li>It's bustling, you know, bless them,
 but the Israeli drivers are, wow, I mean, crazy.
  </li><li>It makes Italy and Brazil look calm.
  </li><li>Sedate, yeah, I was just like,
 I had to like muster up all my Toronto aggression.
  </li><li>She did great.
  </li><li>To get in places, I did all the driving.
  </li><li>I was a navigator.
  </li><li>And people like bikes come out of nowhere,
 people step out on highways and just start walking across.
 I mean, it's crazy.
  </li><li>Speed limits are mere suggestions.
  </li><li>Everything's a suggestion.
  </li><li>Anything could be a parking space.
  </li><li>Seriously, it's crazy.
  </li><li>Nazareth especially was pretty crazy.
  </li><li>Nazareth was really bad.
 And then we, Google Maps took this back way out.
 And I was, there was potholes that were like big enough
 to swallow the car.
 Like it was just like, what?
  </li><li>In Kansas anymore.
  </li><li>Yeah, no, it was crazy.
  </li><li>But in Nazareth, they have this thing called
 the Nazareth Village where they've taken huge efforts
 to painstakingly recreate what a village
 or what life in Jesus' time would have looked like.
 It was really cool. They actually did uncover a first century tomb there. So you can go in
 one and see what it's like I went in. That was really cool.
 Yeah, Nazareth Village has the only reconstruction of what a synagogue would have looked like
 at the time of Jesus. They've recreated everything down to the lime paint and all that kind of
 stuff. I got super emotional sitting in there just being like, "Wow!"
 this is the kind of environment he would have stood up and he would have taught and he would
 have challenged, he would have said the things that he said. Anyway, I was, I loved it. I
 have some pictures of that that we could put up.
 Yeah. That was Nazareth. Capernaum is where Jesus spent a good bit of time. Capernaum
 is unique in that you can absolutely guarantee that the stones you're at, because a lot of
 stuff in Israel has been destroyed many, many times, not least of which, you know, it's
 certainly Jerusalem 87 day with a destruction there, but even before then, but Capernaum,
 you can absolutely guarantee that the stones in Capernaum are the same stones that Jesus
 would have walked on, the same stones that would have heard Jesus' voice.
 Yeah, it didn't get built over.
 Kind of surreal to be there.
 You can see Peter's house.
 Yeah, you can see Peter's house.
 And of course, we don't know where Jesus lived in this scenario, but you're looking at this
 village that maybe had about 1500 people total in it and just yeah I mean it was
 super overwhelming wasn't it like it just and it felt it felt really peaceful.
 There's a really nice part where you can go kind of out the back and it
 Capernaum is right on the Sea of Galilee so you can just kind of walk down
 the beach and then I'm reading the gospels where it's like Jesus you know
 went to Capernaum and then one day walked down by the Sea of Galilee and
 called as disciples and I'm like, oh, this is literally where I am.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And we just stood on the beach with the kids and skipped some stones and stuff.
 And it was great.
 Part of the-- this is kind of a first world drone problem.
 Part of the problem with taking your drone to Israel is that all of the major sites
 that you go to see are Israeli national parks.
 And you're not allowed to fly your drone anywhere in Israeli national parks.
 And that's kind of on the honor system.
 I saw some people doing it, I never did,
 just 'cause I wanted to honor what they'd asked.
 You could get some amazing footage.
 If you're a commercial drone pilot,
 you can write an ask for permission, I'm not, so I couldn't.
 And then the other part, which I found out is,
 there are certain parts of Israel that are geofenced,
 which means if you start up your drone
 when your drone communicates with your phone,
 your phone has got GPS,
 if you're inside one of those geofenced areas,
 they're just plugging map coordinates
 you cannot take off, your machine is grounded.
 So even if you wanted to be sneaky, you can't.
 So I got on Jerusalem was like that, wasn't it?
 You couldn't fly it in Jerusalem.
  </li><li>Yeah, you'd get in huge trouble,
 which makes sense, you know,
 they're a nation facing being bombed and rocketed.
 So the thought of like having unmanned aerial aircraft.
  </li><li>Sure, yeah.
  </li><li>Into a little bit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But that was Capernaum.
 Then we left the Galilee area
 and we drove all the way down to Jerusalem.
  </li><li>Well, we tried first to find Mount Carmel.
  </li><li>Well, we found it.
 We found it, we drove all over it.
 We just didn't find what we were looking for
 to stop and have a moment there
 because there's like eight national park sites
 for something. - Different entrances.
  </li><li>We just didn't find it.
 So that's for the next trip.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yep.
  </li><li>So Jerusalem, Jerusalem's a huge city,
 like many kind of major metropolitan city in the world.
 You know, really modern five star hotels, you know,
 the UN's there, yada, yada, yada.
 We skipped all of that and we stayed in the old city.
 So how would you describe the old city?
 Um, it's the tight.
 I mean, it's the...
 It's the original, well, it's, you know...
 The city of Jerusalem kind of grew in scope, depending on who was leading it.
 So, you know, Solomon, David, Solomon, Hezekiah, they all kind of expanded the boundaries of
 Jerusalem. But where you are today, when you go to the old city...
 So this is really Herod's... A lot of it is Herod's walls and all that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah, right.
  </li><li>It was my favorite part of Israel.
 But because I hadn't done my research
 and because we'd rented a car
 and because we were staying at like a boutique little bed
 and breakfast hotel there, not even a bed in breakfast,
 just bed.
  </li><li>Just bed.
  </li><li>I was like, babe, you know, we got our luggage,
 why don't you just drop us in?
 She's like, no, no, two reasons.
 Like one, you cannot drive in the old city.
 Like you just can't.
 It's all the roads were made by donkeys.
 This hasn't made the roads.
 You get donkeys, you put a load on a donkey
 and you let the donkey loose.
 Because a donkey's always gonna take the path
 of least resistance, that's how the street came about.
  </li><li>And that's about the width of it.
 Like you feel like you could walk down the main streets
 like this and hit the walls on either side.
  </li><li>And so these kind of like little winding things.
 And so we drop off our car at the rental place
 and they said it's a 10 minute walk, which is true,
 13 minute walk.
  </li><li>It would have been.
  </li><li>It would have been if we knew what we're doing.
  </li><li>Yeah, it would have been.
  </li><li>But it's an hour.
 and you should've seen us like, we're like,
 "Hello, can you spot, we're American tourists
 "because we have our Samsonite rolling suitcases
 "and we're dragging them through the old city of the cobble
 "street." - We're both rolling these
 huge suitcases on cobble streets, like going down.
 And if you've ever seen pictures of the streets,
 like we were on David's street for a lot of it,
 which is like the famous street
 where you just see there's vendors on every side.
 It's a really compact street
 and there's tons of people in there
 and hustle and bustles, yes.
 That's where we were with three children
 who kept asking us if we were lost.
 And-- - Which we were.
  </li><li>And we were following Google Maps,
 but we didn't know it wasn't updating.
 And we just, it took us an hour,
 and we essentially walked in a huge circle.
 And if we had known we were going,
 it would have been a 10-minute walk,
 not an hour walk with suitcase.
  </li><li>Wonder of wonders, Apple Maps saved the day.
  </li><li>It was, yeah, it was Apple Maps that did it.
 and you're back because I got to where I could no longer lift the suitcases up the stairs.
 So sweet Alan would.
 It was all adrenaline.
 He would bring one set up all these stairs and then he'd come down and he'd help me with the next
 because we did two suitcases for five people and they were pretty loaded down.
 Yeah, baby.
 But old Jerusalem was my favorite part of all of Israel.
 Yeah, it was beautiful.
 I love being there.
 And then we got to know it.
 Yeah.
 So then we got to know where we were and yeah, I can navigate pretty well in there now.
 It's on the best bagel shops and we did.
 We did.
  </li><li>We did fantastic. - Again, everything's small,
 so you can walk everywhere.
 And so we spent five days.
  </li><li>Five nights, yep.
  </li><li>Five nights, six days in the old city of Jerusalem,
 which meant you could walk to see all the things
 you might traditionally associate with Israel.
 So the Western Wall, the Temple Mount,
 which is the Dome on the Rock, the city of David,
 which I didn't know that the city of David and Jerusalem
 were two different things, but they're kind of not.
  </li><li>Amazing, are we talking about all those things?
 Or just like, well, yeah, we don't wanna kill you.
 It was amazing.
 It was-- - Kill you, hezekiah's tunnel.
  </li><li>Oh, hezekiah.
  </li><li>Keep that in a second.
 Anyway, you're surrounded.
 People asked us, did you feel safe?
 Absolutely.
 Felt super safe the whole time.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Felt safe for my kids.
 Didn't feel like my kids were in danger any time.
  </li><li>We would see like six and seven year old kids
 just walking around by themselves in old Jerusalem.
 And we saw two, I would say seven at the most,
 two seven year old kids pushing a baby that was a one year old
 by themselves, like just down the street.
 whatever I was like, okay.
  </li><li>It felt super safe like I wasn't gonna get picked pocketed
 or anything was gonna get stolen from me.
 Didn't worry about bombs or anything like that.
 There's visible security everywhere.
 So the old city Jerusalem has about a network
 of 2000 closed-circuit TV cameras.
 The military police were right next to us.
  </li><li>And they're all like super armed.
 So it is a little weird because the army there
 starts at age 18, right?
 So it looks like they're armed children, essentially,
 in army outfits, but like, wow.
 Just walking around with semi-automatic weapons
 and I'm just going, how old are you?
  </li><li>Well, what was surreal to me is,
 when you're standing there all city Jerusalem,
 it is home to people, like people live there.
 So just like a tourist.
 It's not filled with tourists,
 it's filled with people who call it home.
  </li><li>That's where they do their way.
 Yeah, they're going to work, coming home from work, going to their stop.
 Just normal stuff and all around them are all these historical sites of where Jesus was.
 It's just crazy, like some of the pull of Bethesda.
 You can go to the pull of Bethesda.
 That was one of my favorite places to go.
 You could go to the pull of Salome, where I remember Jesus made mad and put it on the
 the black guys eyes and just go washing the pool of saloon.
 You're there.
 You can go to where Jesus was buried,
 like all these places and it's just like
 kind of nonchalant for people.
 And that kind of threw me.
  </li><li>I mean, some of the big sites have a lot of tourists
 in them and stuff like that.
 And so you can see that people are trying to see the things
 and whatever, but just, you're just surrounded by history.
 Like, oh, wow.
 You know, anyway, yeah.
 And we went down to the Western world, didn't we?
 And both of us.
  </li><li>Well, that's top of the Western Wall.
 So the Western Wall, which I don't know,
 is the retaining wall of the second temple.
 So the temple that--
  </li><li>Solomon.
 No.
  </li><li>Yes, the Solomon of the Bill.
 And King Herod extended.
 So to curry favor with the people,
 he again, in a marvelous feat of engineering,
 he extended, and then the temple was destroyed in 8070
 when the Romans overthrew and Jesus prophesied that.
 But the Western Wall is pretty much
 all that remains of that original temple.
 Of that original temple.
 And it's where the Jewish people believe
 that God's presence has never departed.
 And so you know us, we love the presence of God
 and you can see it from ages away.
 Again, because the whole city is hilly,
 as you approach it, you're, I don't know,
 a couple of stories above it
 and you're kind of looking down on this huge plaza.
 It's filled with people from all different faiths.
 You've got Catholics, you've got evangelicals,
 You've got Jewish people, you've got Muslims.
 Everybody's going there.
 It's a holy sight for everybody to go to.
 And honestly, I'm kind of like,
 you know, I wanna go see it and maybe take some pictures.
 I'm kind of indifferent.
 I'm fully functional.
 I'm thinking you have to go through like airport security,
 the men and the women split up.
 It's just, it's a lot of energy, chaos going on.
 And you know, you know, I'm a grace runner.
 I feel the presence of God all the time.
 So that sounds hot to you.
 It wasn't a hot day in my heart.
 I was just thinking, sure we'll go, you know?
 but it's like everything else.
 I'll go, you know, get a photo, get a t-shirt maybe.
 So we get through security,
 and as soon as I step onto the land of the Western Wall,
 that kind of plaza, I just burst into tears.
 A damn like, I'm overcome with,
 and I wouldn't even say I was overcome with the presence
 of God, I've just overcome with emotion.
 I went from where my kids were, my camera,
 okay, what time is it, when we do lunch to,
 (imitates
 I'm just standing there weeping and I look over AJ and I'm crying.
 And she's doing what she's saying.
 I mean, when I went up to the wall, you know, that happened again.
 I just put my hand in the wall and I just, I could feel the presence of God.
 It was, it was lovely.
 I mean, you could feel it in the city in general, really, but just the amount of faith that
 you could feel in that little place.
 And it needs to be said too that with the Western wall or what we would call the whaling
 wall before.
 The Muslims aren't owning that section there.
 Like you didn't really see Muslim believers in there.
 It was just Christians and Jewish believers.
 They were up on the Temple Mount,
 but they weren't down against the wall.
  </li><li>Men and women have to be split up.
 And so, yeah, it was, well, you'd asked,
 somebody, I think it was Will on my Instagram was like,
 "Hey, what did you feel there?"
 I felt the, like you said,
 I felt the Holy Spirit a lot of places in Israel,
 but I really felt very, very moved on when I was there.
 I would have loved to have gone back.
 And we could have, I mean, it was like a stone throw
 from our hotel.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, we could have.
  </li><li>It's the stairs.
  </li><li>The kids poured tea at one point.
 She said, you know, if anybody's going to Israel
 and they don't know what it's like,
 they need to know there's so many stairs,
 just lots and lots of stairs.
  </li><li>To put it in perspective, we walked 63 miles
 250 stories. Yeah, we went up or down 250 stories. Yeah, and then the kids did great.
 But yeah, tons of stairs, lots of up and down. We did see what we thought was the
 beautiful gates. Yes. That's on the other side of the Western Wall. Yeah,
 when we went to the city of David, you could go up to a lookout point on
 there and look towards the temple and see what they believe is the the
 beautiful gate. Where Peter and John went to pray and then met Lee Mann on his way.
 Yeah and then the city of David is amazing. The excavation that's happening
 there you can see parts of David and Solomon's temple that er, sorry, they're
 dwelling. David and Solomon's dwelling and then this picture here, this is a
 a corner of Nehemiah's wall.
 So that's actually the wall that Nehemiah rebuilt,
 which that blew my mind as well.
 Like I was just like, say what?
 It's pretty amazing.
 We went down and went down through Hezekiah's tunnel,
 which is another feat of engineering.
 I don't recommend going through Hezekiah's tunnel.
 If you have ever in your life had a panic attack,
 if you don't like closed spaces,
 if you don't like the dark,
 if you don't wanna be cold.
 So, MJ and Tia's were sort of ahead of us
 and MJ saw, you know, where you stepped down into it
 and went, no, we're out.
  </li><li>And I was like, I'll take him.
 I know it's disappointing that I can't go through it.
  </li><li>I couldn't see what they had seen.
 So all I saw was MJ turn around like,
 "No, no, I'm not doing it."
  </li><li>I saw a sign that said you're about to enter
 a one-way tunnel with fast running water in darkness
 that lasts 40 minutes.
 If you get in, there is no turning around
 and I was like, I'm out.
  </li><li>I did not see this sign.
 I did not see this sign.
  </li><li>So I went through the dry tunnels
 where there's no running water.
 And I'm fairly broad, like I have wide-ish shoulders
 and a backpack and there was places where I,
 there's two or three places where I got stuck
 and had to wrestle through.
 And there was running electricity there.
  </li><li>And you have light and stuff.
 So I end up going down in this tunnel.
 Abby really wants to go.
 Like I sort of, when I got to the thing, I went,
 "Oh, I don't know that I need to do this
 "'cause I really don't like closed spaces.
 "It's a thing, I don't like it."
 But Abby was like, "No, I wanna go, I wanna go."
 And I'm like, "Okay."
 And I didn't think it would be okay
 to just leave her with the guide.
 In case Abby had a moment,
 I didn't want her to not have her mom
 or her dad with her, you know?
 So I stepped down first.
 Abby behind me are guide with Sarah
 who was amazing and Giddy up.
 It was dark.
 It was tight.
 At times I was crouched almost like all the way over
 and we did that tunnel in under 20 minutes.
 I was like, "Giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy, giddy."
  </li><li>Our tour guide was like, "I've never done it so quickly."
  </li><li>The tour guide at one point I was like,
 "So, Sarah, how do you think we're doing?
 "Do you think we're almost done?"
 And I'm literally having, I'm praying in tongues
 And I've never felt like this panicked before.
 I thought, I cannot have a panic attack.
 My daughter is behind me, but I'm about to lose my lunch.
 Like I am, I'm totally panicking here.
 And I'm just like walking as fast as I can.
 Anyway, I said, do you think we're about halfway?
 And she goes, well, we probably are.
 I've never done it this fast before.
 So it was kind of, I was really happy to come out
 the other side.
 And I don't believe I'll ever do it again.
  </li><li>Lastly.
  </li><li>We're kind of skipping.
 If you wanna know more, you can like reach out, ask us.
 But lastly, we did a day trip out of the old city
 to go down to the Dead Sea, which was spectacular.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Spectacular.
  </li><li>Amazing. - It is this beautiful,
 I mean, look at it, it's beautiful, lush,
 in the middle of a desert.
  </li><li>Again, I didn't expect the Dead Sea to be that color.
  </li><li>Or that beautiful. - No.
  </li><li>So we drove down, on the way we stopped
 at a place called Engeri. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Remember the story about where David
 is on the run from Saul and David's hiding in a cave and then Saul comes into the cave
 to use the bathroom and Saul goes up, sorry Saul goes into use the bathroom and Dave goes
 up to him and cuts off a corner of his robe. That was in that area there. And that was
 stunning. Yeah David hid out there. It's funny actually because going there you could understand
 how he could have hid out there. There are little animals and goats and things like that
 that he could have eaten or whatever.
 There's fresh- - Right, right, right.
  </li><li>There's fresh-witting water.
 There's caves, like huge caves to hide in and stuff like that.
 So-- - But it's in the middle of nowhere.
 I mean, literally nowhere. - No where.
 Yes.
 In the desert-e section of Southern Israel,
 and then you're in this, again, in oasis.
 I mean-- - And then what's crazy
 is there's this place called Masada.
 Now, Masada again doesn't appear in the Bible,
 But Masada was one of King Herod's palaces.
 It's where they believe Herod was when he heard about Jesus.
 It is hard to wrap your head around.
 The sheer audacity and genius and execution will power to pull us off.
 Yeah.
 It is in the middle of the desert.
 there is this huge flat-topped mountain.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>That's what, how many feet up?
  </li><li>About 1400 feet up. - Five and nine.
  </li><li>Five and nine.
  </li><li>And he decides to build a palace,
 not just a, but a luxurious palace with swimming pool.
  </li><li>But there's a southern palace and a northern palace.
  </li><li>Yeah, northern palace, nobody got to see it
 if it's his house.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, just like--
  </li><li>But he lived in luxury. - And he'd be crazy.
  </li><li>But to get up it, like the path which we could have had
 the option, but we went and I think it would take
 a cable car.
 It's called the Snake Path.
 But just to get from Jerusalem where he was out to here.
  </li><li>Can't imagine.
  </li><li>I can't even imagine how you would do it.
 And when you see it and you wrap your head around,
 you can't fathom the cost.
  </li><li>I can't answer to that on Apple Watch.
  </li><li>Me neither.
 You can't fathom the cost of building it.
 You can't fathom the logistics behind you.
  </li><li>How they got even everything up, I don't know.
  </li><li>How you would have running water or fresh water.
  </li><li>They had to bring water up and fill this cistern
 And the water would have come from Engetty.
 So they would have had to go down to Engetty
 and then bring it up the snake path
 to fill the cistern so that he heard it out of water.
 I mean, just sort of think like, yeah, it just, wow.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was a manger maniac.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 What else?
 I mean, that's a lot.
 I hope this has been interesting to you.
 It was super interesting for us.
 Overall, I was not ready for the beauty.
  </li><li>I wasn't either.
 the effect it had on me. No, I was trying to explain to somebody and this isn't a good word but I
 need a good word and I haven't come up with it yet but I feel kind of haunted by it. Like I feel
 like there's this residue in my heart of having been there and there's something in me that is just
 like I can't wait to go back. So, so I'm planning a trip back. Here you are. Yeah. Yeah. So. Well
