<p> I live in a days but got for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is mr jones mrs hot stuff aj jones how are you i'm well let's talk about how well you weren't at the beginning of the week because.
 Despite the fact that you were very very sick there was a comedic side to it for you or for me well not for you but for me it was quite funny our doctor did say aj if i did not know you i would think you're on drugs.
 Well yes because I looked like I was stoned.
 You had vertigo.<br/>
 Very bad vertigo, yes.<br/>
 So what would happen is if your neck turned off axis,
 your pupils would dilate completely,<br/>
 and then your eyeballs would shake left to right,
 and then you'd throw up.<br/>
 Rapidly.<br/>
 And I would feel like my whole world was on a record player.
 For those listeners unfamiliar with a record player?
 It would spin.<br/>
 Like the whole room.<br/>
 Like the whole room.<br/>
 And so I would just randomly fall over or vomit or both.
 So I spent Monday and Tuesday with the room spinning, no matter
 whether I was upright or lying down and throwing up because I was
 nauseous from spinning.<br/>
 So you're completely disoriented.<br/>
 You can't tell which way is up.<br/>
 Not when it's spinning like that.<br/>
 So when you because you fell on the floor out of the shower, which was funny,
 but you you handily caught me.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 I'm always there to catch you.<br/>
 Well, sort of.<br/>
 I kind of hit the floor anyway, but you softened the blow.
 That's right. So you're lying head down. What's happening at that point? The whole room is just,
 you can't tell what's up. No, I can't. I can't. I can't tell which way is up. I just literally feel
 like it's the whole room is turning around and around and around. And so I had to throw a glass
 of ice cold water on and it shocked you back to reality. That's not what you did. No, I wish I
 had though. I would have loved to see what I would have gotten you back. So that stayed like that
 for two days. You had to do the Epley maneuver. Yeah. I think Ronston did it like four times total.
 And the athlete maneuver looks like someone's trying to unscrew your head off your shoulder.
 That kind of does, yeah. And it feels horrible because basically he's trying to get the crystals
 that are in your inner ear back where they're supposed to be because that's what's producing
 that type of vertigo. Now, as Christians, do we believe in crystals?
 We believe in the ones that God put in your ear, you know, because, well, God put them there.
 And that's the thing that gives you equilibrium. And is that equilibrium the right word?
 That's the one that gives you balance. Yeah. It somehow floats in your inner ear
 and it's what sends the message to your brain
 about how to balance for different slopes
 and if you're on a boat or all that kind of stuff.
 So mine were in the wrong place, which is why.
</p><ul>
  <li>So you've got better?
  </li><li>Yes, but what I have remaining is still a type of vertigo
 which is from my C1 being out of place.
  </li><li>Which is your vertebrae?
  </li><li>Well, baby, I'm so sorry.
 It's been a rough week for you
 because you like to be active
 and really for Monday and Tuesday, you were out for the count.
 Yeah. And, yeah. And Wednesday I went to work, but then I was useless at night.
 I was just so tired and...
 And strangely, you couldn't sleep in bed because if you lay down,
 like you went through the center of your gravity, everything got woozy.
 So you had to sleep upright on the sofa.
 Mm-hmm. For four days.
 That's not fun. That was not good sleep.
 So it would be fair to say this has been a fairly tiring week for both of us.
 It's been an exhausting week.
 You, because you don't know which way you're up and me, because I'm trying to compensate for...
 you being sick and you're unable to do a lot of stuff that you would normally do,
 but you gave me a fresh appreciation for all you do.
 Oh, let's talk about that. What do you appreciate?
 You're in a words of affirmation.
 No, yes, I am. Go ahead.
 No, but you are words of affirmation.
 Everybody likes words of affirmation. Everybody likes to feel like they are appreciated and needed
 and somebody notices what they do.
 Baby, you know what I appreciate? I appreciate every Tuesday you get up super early and you take
 Abigail to the choir practice. I have never appreciated how fatiguing that is. It's exhausting. It's totally exhausting. What else do you appreciate?
 I appreciate that every morning. Without fail, you make the kids pack lunches. Yep. And you do so when there's not always the food in the cupboards that needs to be.
 Yes, I'm a guy for them a lunch every morning. You do. I'm a guy with them an interesting one. They had like uncooked pasta. I don't think I want to know. Don't tell me. Just don't tell me.
 I thought they'll D for Austin. Oh, dear.
 They'll be fine. Yeah. They didn't complain.
 So anyway, that kind of overshadowed the week.
 How do you feel about ballet class?
 Are you appreciating me taking them to ballet class?
 So what's funny is three weeks ago, yeah, you normally take them to ballet class.
 Yes. Because the last place I want to be is in ballet class with just the estrogen.
 It's like the high pitched estrogen.
 So these are all these prepubescent little girls running around super excited about being
 Are kids forget any basic social norms and they're running around screaming and I'm basically the only dad there so it's all women and all girls and it's rush hour cool spring traffic to get there and give eyes.
 So three weeks ago i was like babe i am never taking them to ballet class again and i said and i made an interview i have that worked out for you every week since i've had to take them because you can't drive nope not yet.
 hope he didn't milk it until Friday. No way. No way. That'll be fine. All right. Rest of the week.
 I went for a walk at Radner. That's how exciting our life as you actually went outside. A couple
 of times I had to hold on to a tree. What other than that? Haven't we all, baby?
 Other than that, it was exciting. Yeah. My Monday was interesting. I taught on women in
 ministry and hell. You did both on Monday? Yeah, I'm four students, man. That was a heavy day.
 I thought you were just doing movement of ministry.
 No, I did hell in the afternoon.
 Because there's this growing fashionable trend to get rid of hell.
 Hell seems to gruesome.
 Hell is certainly gruesome.
 There's a growing trend of people, quite respectable leaders, to talk about universalism.
 What's the other thing that's?
 Annihilationism.
 So I was just talking to the students about why annihilationism and universalism.
 though they seem much more palatable, just aren't supported in Scripture.
 And talked about hell and the realities of it. It's so sobering.
 It is. When you talk about hell, it's so sobering. And the couple of times I've taught it,
 I've tried to be lighthearted about it. And that topic just does not work. It does not suit
 lighthearted. No, there's just not much lighthearted information.
 It's so sobering. And so, so there's just nothing lighthearted about hell at all.
 It's a real place.
 It is the destination of those who are not in relationship with Jesus.
 And if you listen to this and you've never given your life to Jesus, I, I implore you to call out to Jesus to save you.
 The promise in scriptures, anyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.
 So if you maybe been in church all your life, maybe you've heard the message, but maybe you don't actually have a personal relationship with Jesus.
 just acknowledging that you have done wrong things in your life,
 acknowledging that Jesus came to pay for those sins,
 and that he died a gruesome death on the cross,
 and that God raised him up again,
 and believing in him, and just saying,
 "Jesus, would you save me from my sin
 "is enough to change your destination from hell to heaven?"
 And I would really encourage you,
 if you haven't done that, please do that.
 All right, from how what else happened this week?
  </li><li>We had great weather.
 If we did, what's I love it?
 I'm in shorts.
 As we record this, I'm in short.
 Which is very distracting for me.
 I don't think it's a good idea.
 You know, a baby's here cross to carry.
 I know. I know those nice furry legs.
 So this afternoon when I first bike ride and then I took the kids to the park
 and it was as gorgeous 5 p.m.
 Some was setting.
 I was like, I love it.
 Amazing. I made roast chicken.
 Yeah. We've hit the ball on the barrel for him.
 We kind of have. Yeah.
 I'll have to come up with something new for next week.
 You finished your series on blessing this morning.
 Yeah, I did.
 Was excellent.
 You kind of have to say that.
 Give me your marriage.
 I don't.
 I don't.
 I, babe, I tell you all the time if I don't think something was done very well or.
 You know, all the time, all the time you tell me if things are.
 No, but I mean, if, if we do candidly talk to each other about, you know, that is for certain.
 Right.
 So I wouldn't actually say that it was really good if it wasn't.
 Well, you know what?
 I appreciate that.
 You're welcome.
 It was, it was hard work.
 I'm not going to lie.
 It was great though.
 Speaking for service, I've learned to ignore the lack of feedback in first service.
 I think that there's got to be a lot of contemplators in first service.
 Well, I think so.
 And it's really early if you think about it.
 We should just hand out free espresso.
 We'd probably get more of a reaction.
 Yeah, or donuts.
 Something like that.
 So anyway, that's our week.
 You've been sick.
 I had a lot of teaching and I'm glad that week is over.
 I feel like I've caught up a little bit on sleep.
 And I'm excited about this week.
 You don't?
 No.
 I'm sorry, honey.
 That's OK.
 Well, since we're done recording, you can go sleep.
 OK.
 Our topic this week comes from one of our listeners,
 one of our favorite listeners, Becky Pendergrass,
 wrote in and said, hey, have you guys
 talked about negotiation?
 I was just thinking.
 I would say something like, what up, Becky?
 Just have tired, are you?
 So Becky wrote in and said, have you guys
  </li><li>I've never done a podcast on negotiation
 and I don't think we have.
 So here we're gonna talk about negotiation.
 Where do you wanna start with negotiation, babe?
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>Talk about your love, hate relationship with negotiation.
  </li><li>You're the negotiation king.
  </li><li>I'm not sure I'm a king, love.
  </li><li>You are a king.
  </li><li>I think I'm a king compared to you
 because you don't really negotiate.
  </li><li>Well, so I know you have the thing of like,
 you should always ask for a discount
 because you can always get at least 10%.
  </li><li>Right, well, my golden rule is anybody can get 10% off
 of anything pretty much anytime.
  </li><li>But I sometimes feel like, for me,
 it feels really cheap to be like,
 "Hey, that's a nice latte.
 Can I get 10% off that?"
 Or, I know it doesn't really work with latte,
 but you know what I'm saying.
  </li><li>Yeah, but that's not how you would do it.
 So, I mean, I should qualify that.
 I don't go on a whole food and go,
 "Hey, this is really good.
 How about you give me 10% off my bill?"
  </li><li>Right, that's true.
  </li><li>I'm not talking about your day-to-day stuff,
 but I'm talking about a larger purchase.
  </li><li>Yeah, or if you're like Craigslist-ing
 Or, well, you do it every time we go to the garage
 whenever we get the car fixed,
 you always end up getting some sort of a,
 at least 10% every single time we go.
  </li><li>Right.
 And here's why I know that's gonna be possible.
 Is because if you're signed up to their email list,
 they're constantly sending you,
 "Hey, we're doing a winter special,
 "or we're doing this, or we're doing that,
 "or we're doing something."
 I've got better things to do in my life
 than keep track of what promotions are going on.
 So I just say what promotions have you got going on?
  </li><li>Right.
 And you know, if they don't have one that's going on, I put it to them our service history
 and just say, well, you know, given where anyway, we're jumping ahead, I think it would
 be fair to say that you have got more comfortable with the concept of negotiation in the years
 that we've been married. True or false? True. And your initial awkward relationship with
 negotiation came from where? I don't know. I guess I'd never, ever done it. Like my
 family. I don't ever remember asking for a discount for anything. Right. But I think
 asking for a discount and negotiation to completely different things.
 Okay.
 I think negotiating is a business practice where you're trying to create a win-win environment.
 I think asking for a discount just sounds like you're cheap.
 Okay.
 So while asking for a discount is part of negotiation, I think negotiation is a way broader topic than
 just, hey, I don't want to pay for this. And that's not what you're coming from at all.
 Right. Okay.
 So negotiation for me is trying to create an environment that is win-win for both the seller and the buyer.
 Because in an ideal situation, whether I'm the seller or whether I'm the buyer, we both want something to walk away happy.
 Like if I go buy a car, the car salesman literally wants to sell me a car.
 It's in his job title.
 Right.
 And I'm a buyer.
 So if I can buy a car that's within my budget, I'm happy.
 If he can sell a car within my budget, he's going to be happy.
 It's just, it's just finding that common balance.
 Right.
 Right.
 Right.
 So what has been your problem historically with what I've just said there?
 Um, I honestly don't know.
 I would say historically I would just get embarrassed.
 And I was happy for the benefit of it.
 Like in that you would be able to negotiate, spending less or getting
 more for what we're already spending or whatever.
 Right.
 But I just felt really uncomfortable to be there.
 In fact, sometimes I would just sort of wander away
 while you were doing the negotiation fact.
 That's fascinating.
 Why?
 Because what did you think was happening?
 I don't know.
 But now?
 Now what's it like?
 Well, now I have benefited from it many times.
 And so when you say something like, hey, babe,
 when they call you about the car or whatever,
 make sure that you ask them about negotiated discount
 or whatever.
 Yeah.
 Now I can go, "Okay, I'm okay to do that," but I still have to kind of work myself up
 to it.
 But for example, if you're next to me and we're talking about a discount for a washer
 dryer that we've just bought, or do you feel uncomfortable, or do you feel like, "Oh,
 this is just part of the process," or...
 I'm starting to feel like it's part of the process.
 And do you...
 Like, did you use to feel...
 I'm fascinated by the fact that this was an awkward thing for you.
 Why was it awkward?
 Do you think I was making people feel awkward?
 No, I think that you are, I don't know. I don't know. Look, I, I, I think that you're
 great at it. I just sometimes, I feel like it's putting somebody in a difficult position.
 Of course, they can always say no, but I guess because I feel like most people don't
 realize they can say no.
 Right. But anybody who's a salesperson for the living has been taught sales techniques.
 right so I'm just using the same techniques it kind of as a defense like
 I have this impenetrable shield like your Jedi mind tricks will not work on me
 And so I don't want to deal with sleazy sales people any more than anybody else
 Right. I just I'm not interested in playing that game
 I want to find somebody like the best sales person to deal with is somebody who wants you to be happy
 Right, and that's why I love
 You're not gonna get a discount of Apple, but that's why I love Apple people. They're not on commission
 They are they're gently trying to probe what is it you're looking for and how can we help you get there?
 And so there's this sense of trust when you're speaking to somebody say from Apple or when you're speaking to you know
 Somebody who has a passion about what they're doing like I love I don't know how many Apple products
 I've sold to people I don't work for Apple in any capacity whatsoever. No, but you should know
 But what I mean by that is I'm listening to people and I'm helping them pick what they need right when I find a sales person
 and wants to do that, oh, I just, I love the ride.
 And then you get a sense that there, that you can work together.
 Right.
 But the same thing, you know, whether I'm buying or whether I'm selling, like whenever
 I'm selling anything on Craigslist, I know people are going to want to negotiate with
 me. So I'm fine with that. I have verbal judo.
 And I get that. Like I get that because I think in Craigslist, like if I put something on Craigslist,
 I'm kind of expecting that somebody's going to try and negotiate me down.
 But do you feel confident to navigate that?
 Well, I do now, but I sort of have in my head like I won't go below X.
 Right, that's a good thing.
 Yeah.
 All right, well, let me give you the basics of what I was taught.
 Okay, go.
 So I think this came from Dave Ramsey.
 I think when we're doing Dave Ramsey's financial piece university,
 which if you haven't done already, I highly recommend it.
 He gave us three rules of negotiation.
 I love this.
 He said, the first rule is never misrepresent the truth while negotiating,
 which is a really big deal.
 I mean, of course it's wrong, you never wanna lie,
 but it also weakens your stance,
 because generally speaking, we can tell
 when somebody else is lying.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Number two is never have intentions to harm the party.
 Right?
 And I think this is where people don't like to negotiate
 because they think, oh, you're out to rip off the person.
 I'm like, no, I'm not.
 I'm acutely aware of the law of sewing and reaping.
 I actually, I want to create a win-win environment.
 Like when we've bought our cars in the past,
 or when we've gone to set up the purchase of a car
 or a lease of a car,
 I'm not going in to try and drive a hard bargain.
 I'm saying, this is my budget.
 Do you have a car that fits in that budget?
 And if they don't have a car that fits in that budget,
 no hard feelings, I'll go look elsewhere.
 I think some people think, oh, you're playing hardball.
 You're like, no, I just don't want to overspend.
 So number one, never misrepresent the truth.
 Number two, never have intentions to harm the other party.
 and number three, create a win-win deal.
 Like that sounds blindingly obvious,
 but again, you wanna find somebody
 who wants to sell something and you wanna buy it,
 if you can find a price that works for both of them,
 you got a win-win deal.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>There's your three guidelines.
 The four stages of negotiating, this is how I do it.
  </li><li>Wow, there's three guidelines and four stages.
  </li><li>Let me tell you, baby, I've got a sprint in time.
 The first step is, which nobody does,
 is I just ask for a better price.
  </li><li>Yes, which you always do.
  </li><li>You'd have no idea how often,
 you don't even need to do anything past that.
 People are like, yeah, I can probably knock 10% off.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Or 20%.
 I mean, how many times have we,
 when we were buying our first house, do you remember this?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The banker calls us and says,
 okay, we're ready to lock in your interest rate.
 And I was like, I don't understand what that means.
 So they said, well, you know,
 you're gonna be borrowing at a set interest rate.
 And today's the day that we're gonna lock it in.
 And I was like, okay, and what is the interest rate?
 And I forgot what they said, 3.75%.
 And I was like, oh, great.
 Is that a good rate?
 And they were like, yeah, it's a good rate.
 I said, where do you come up with that rate?
 And they said, well, we're fed these rates.
 I said, how would I get a better rate?
 And they were like, well, varying number of factors.
 I said, do you think you could ask?
 And they were like, yeah.
 So you put me on hold for like five minutes
 and then came back and was like,
 hey, I've got you a better rate.
 I've got you three and a half percent.
 So just by me asking, what do we shave off like 15, 20,
 thousand dollars over the course of our mortgage
 just by asking?
  </li><li>Huge, yeah.
  </li><li>Out of innocence.
 So just ask, ask for a better price.
 And that's where I say generally speaking,
 you should be able to get 10%,
 generally speaking, you should be able to get 10% off
 of everything every time.
  </li><li>All right, well, what if they say no?
  </li><li>Then stage number two is you just say,
 oh, that's too bad, or oh, that's not good enough,
 or oh, that's unfortunate.
 And then step number three is you wait and say nothing.
 It's butt clenching the awkward.
  </li><li>It is.
 That's what I don't like about the negotiating is the butt clenching the awkward right and you can't fake it
 You have to show utter disinterest. Yeah, you can't be like you know stroking your chain like I'm thinking about it
 You're just like oh, okay. Well, that's a sign of the word for me
 Right see
 I'm trying to be quiet and you have to break the silence because it's about cleanse
 But that's what I'll do it this time
 See impressive you still broke the silence
 Thing is don't shift your body language. Don't speak don't make suggestions
 Here's the number one thing I see people go wrong when they're when they're learning to negotiate
 They say hey is there a better price or can you not do that?
 I'm like why have you softened the blow for them drop that or can you not do that if you say?
 You know is there any way you know
 Is there a better price or is that something you can do for me?
 They're just gonna say they're just gonna repeat the last thing
 "Oh, that's not something we can do for you."
 Don't give them the easy out.
 Just say, "Hey, is there any way you can do it?"
 So I wait, I just, it's awkward,
 but I just wait it out and I let them come back to me.
 If they come back to me with an option and I like it,
 great.
 If they come back to me with an option and I think,
 well, maybe not, I try some other things.
 Well, okay, if you can't deal with a price,
 could you do free shipping?
 Or if you can't do free shipping,
 could you cover the sales tax?
 or if you can't do that, could you throw this in as well?
 Or I just throw things around.
 Again, I'm just exploring the options.
  </li><li>I remember when we got the girls bunk beds.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>They were willing to give 10%,
 but they were quite expensive, the bunk beds.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so I remember you talking to the guy and just saying,
 you know, is there anything more you can do?
 And he said, well, not really on these beds.
 Like I can't really do anything on the beds.
 And there was a lamp that you wanted.
 Which wasn't true, by the way.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Well, if you remember, I, you know,
 especially on bigger purchases in big bulk stores,
 I usually just for the fun of it,
 just drop the price by 50%.
 So, you know, if the beds were $1,200,
 I'm just like, "Is there only a do them for 600?"
 Now, nobody should be doing them for 600.
 So they're gonna say, "No, but then they're gonna make
 "a counter offer, which is gonna be better."
 And they're probably gonna counter with,
 say, "Well, can you do it?"
 You know, "Well, probably what best I could do
 "is not 200 off as a thousand."
 like, you know, I was really hoping for 600 and they might, you know, nudge it down to maybe 900.
 So what happened was he said, no, I can't. And this is key. You have to be able to walk away.
 Right.
 You have to be. And really, it's as simple as being like, oh, you can't. Oh, okay.
 And here's the thing. If you don't have $1,200, don't buy the bunk beds.
 Right.
 So you just, that's what we said. We said, oh, okay. Well, thanks so much for your time.
 And we left, but he walked us out the store.
 Yeah.
 And as we were just leaving the store, the door was open.
 As I was walking out, the man said, let me give you my card.
 When anybody says, let me give you my card, they want you to call back and make a deal.
 Right.
 So he said there was nothing that could be done, but we'd call back and said, well, you
 know, what about this?
 What about that?
 And eventually I forget what he did.
 Well, he did drop it by a couple hundred dollars.
 Yeah.
 And then, but you also had seen this lamp.
 Yeah.
 That was sort of in their sales section, but you just really liked it.
 but it was supposed to be like a $200 lamp.
 He gave it a $300 lamp.
  </li><li>Okay, but he gave it to us for like 30 bucks or something.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
  </li><li>So there's so many different ways that you can do that,
 but you have not, 'cause you ask not.
 The number of people who will just not ask,
 I don't understand why people don't ask,
 but just asking a loud saying, "Hey, is that possible?"
 Dave likes to say, "Cash is king,
 "so you take your cash with you
 "and you start fanning the cash out."
 I've never actually had to do that,
 but that's one of the things he talks about.
 I just, I find that a little gangsterish.
 But we did that when we bought our first house,
 if you remember.
 I could tie a bandana on my hair backwards
 and then we could go in with our cash.
 I like that baby.
 Yeah.
 I'd love that.
 Let's do that next time.
 Okay, great.
 Okay.
 Tell everybody the story about buying the house
 when you almost burst into yours.
 Oh, well that was, of course not this house,
 but the last house.
 And the person who was selling us the house,
 she was amazing and we'd met with her several times
 and stuff like that.
 And, but somebody had ordered the exact house
 that we wanted in this area that was getting built.
 And so when we came in, she said,
 it's amazing you can actually have the house that you wanted
 because somebody started the build on it
 and then now they've canceled out of it.
 And so, you know, it's perfect, Bob's your uncle kind of thing.
 But it didn't have the kitchen that I wanted
 and like it didn't have sort of the gourmet upgraded kitchen
 and whatever.
 And so you had said, well, can we upgrade the kitchen
 because that's what AJ wanted
 and can we change some of the colors and whatever?
 And so to begin with, the lady was like,
 "No, you can't change anything
 'cause everything's already ordered."
 They said, "No architectural changes."
  </li><li>Right, and we're like, "Okay."
 So Alan's like, "Well, okay, I guess that's it then.
 Okay, thanks."
  </li><li>Well, I wasn't as abrupt as that.
 I was like, "Well, hang on,
 "the house hasn't been built yet."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I understand that you've put in these orders,
 but you're making a hundred of these houses.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Surely you could recycle our kit,
 nothing's been delivered yet.
 And they were like, "Nope."
  </li><li>There wasn't even walls.
 There was a concrete slab
 that the house was gonna sit on, that's it.
  </li><li>And I was like, "Well, if we're gonna spend
 hundreds of thousand dollars on a house.
 We'd love it to be the house that we want.
 And they said, you know, I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do.
 And I said, you know, we totally understand.
 Thank you so much for your time.
 And we go up and walked out.
 And when we got said, you were like, what are we doing?
 What are we doing? What are we doing?
 I'm like, just just breathe.
 Just that calm.
 Just getting the car.
 Just getting the car.
 And we drove away.
 And a couple of hours later, they called us a home.
 And we're like, well, you know, I spoke to my manager and we could make
 some architectural changes.
 You're like, they let us change pretty much everything we wanted to.
 Right. But the point is you have to be able to walk away.
 Yeah.
 And you know, if, if you can't, it's already owned you.
 It's already named its price.
 Right.
 So there's your first steps to negotiating.
 Ask for a better price.
 If they, if you get it, it's a one step process.
 If you don't, you just say something like, well, that's not good enough.
 Then you wait.
 Right.
 And then you buy or you can't offer.
 You were waiting for me to interrupt you.
 I knew it.
 (laughs)
 But again, if you're not out to be sleazy or difficult
 or obstinate or prideful,
 humility will open doors
 that you might never realize are there.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I think the thing is too,
 is we'd probably have a lot less,
 I mean, I don't mean we, you and I,
 'cause we're fairly good at sticking to,
 you know, whatever budget we're inside.
 But I mean, I guess I've been watching a lot of HGTV,
 you know, and there's all these people who are like,
 Our budget is $300,000 for a house.
 And then they get shown like $450,000 houses or whatever.
 And in the end, they're like, well, I guess, you know,
 I guess that's what we're gonna do.
 And then they end up in a place where they probably
 didn't make the best decision for the rest of their life,
 if that makes sense.
 So if you can actually go into it going,
 this is what I know, I have this much money.
 This is also what I know.
 I'm not going into debt for this.
  </li><li>Right.
 and just be honest about it.
 I think most people can appreciate that.
  </li><li>I find it fascinating when you combine favor
 with negotiation.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So when you add in favor, favor is a gift
 that God gives somebody else for your benefit.
 So you meet somebody and they like you.
 You know, you find favor in their eyes
 without doing anything and they're kindly disposed
 towards you and they want to help you.
 Man, the number of times in our life that we've just seen favor work on behalf of us in terms
 of upgrades, in terms of opportunities, in terms of bonuses.
 Do you think of anything that recently that we've negotiated on?
 You've negotiated every piece of furniture we've ever bought in this entire house.
 I don't think that's true.
 It absolutely is true.
 Really?
 Yes.
 Bookcase in our bedroom, you negotiated that.
 All of this furniture in the podcast studio,
 well, I negotiated that, but because you made me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But we got a discount on that, our couch.
 You negotiated that.
 Yeah, I think, I mean, the Breville food processor.
  </li><li>I didn't even remember that.
  </li><li>We went in to Macy's.
  </li><li>Go Macy's.
  </li><li>Go Macy's and got the Breville Soushev,
 which was, I had been saving up all of my birthday money
 and Christmas money and whatnot.
  </li><li>Right.
 And so we went in and at the cash register, the lady said, "Oh, it's already on for 20%
 off or something like that."
 And then she said, "But if you want to open a Macy's card, I can give you an extra 20%
 off."
 Which we do not.
 Which we do not.
 But you said, "Well, if you can actually just give us an extra 20% off for opening a
 credit card, then you could actually just give us an extra 20% off."
 Well, I don't think I said it quite like that.
 No, no, no.
 But you said it much nicer than that.
 made some comment about, do you have any 20% discounts for people with awesome Scottish
 accents?
 Which in America often works.
 And they're like, you know what, we do this Tuesday.
 We have a, and you know, we struck up some banter and yeah, by the way we went.
 So we ended up getting the, the Sue chef and a kettle for like $220.
 It should have been like $500 altogether.
 Well, I mean, it was something crazy like that.
 Yeah, I don't know where I learned my love of negotiation.
 You're Scottish.
 I think I saw my dad do it, but I don't know.
 I've always enjoyed, I just enjoy the banter
 and everybody loves a good deal.
 Yeah.
 There's something wrong with you if you don't.
 Well, I kind of use it as a verb or an ad verb
 when it's an action thing.
 It's a verb.
 It's a verb because whenever I explain to somebody
 when they're like, how did you get that for that?
 I'm like, "Alan Scottish them out of it."
 (laughs)
 Oh, well, that's very kind of you to say.
 So Becky, I hope that's helpful.
 That's how you negotiate.
 If you have any questions about negotiation,
 hit us up, we'd love to answer them for you.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, I won't be answering them.
  </li><li>Oh, come on, you're agreeing to go share.
 I've told you through it many times.
