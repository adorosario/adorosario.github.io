<body>
<p> Hello.<br/>
 That's a very good radio voice.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Thank you very much.<br/>
 You look very delicious.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Why do you look so good?<br/>
 I feel delicious.<br/>
 That's so terrible.<br/>
 Why do you look so normally you look horrific, but at the moment,
 not what I meant.<br/>
 Because I went to a wedding.<br/>
 We went to a wedding.<br/>
 Well, we did, but we last separately.<br/>
 We did because you like to leave early and I like to stay and dance.
 That's right.<br/>
 but I decided once the dancing started that actually I had very little energy on reserve so I danced one dance and then I left.
 It would be amazing.<br/>
 You came home early to record podcast I did.
 Thanks for coming.<br/>
 How was your week.<br/>
 How was our week? Oh my gosh it was a great week it was a really good week.
 Yeah with tons going on.<br/>
 Yeah with David Wagner in town at the beginning of the week.
 D wags.<br/>
 D wags.<br/>
 So he.<br/>
 How do you describe David Wagner to somebody who's never met him?
 He's a very lovely prophet.<br/>
 He's lovely.<br/>
 He has very kind eyes and he's got a very soft voice and he's very generous.
 Generous with his time, generous with his money, generous with his gift, generous with his self.
 He's lovely.<br/>
 So he was here.<br/>
 He's amazing.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So it was great.<br/>
 He gave us a prophetic word on Monday night, which is always good and encouraging.
 Um, yeah, he did.<br/>
 He gave lots of people prophetic words.
 You know, whenever broffits start prophesying, I start crying.
 Really, I do.<br/>
 I just think it's the kindness of God in action.
 I was going to say you should get that looked at.
 No, I really do.<br/>
 I just think it's beautiful, especially as a pastor, when you're watching the
 people that you know and the people that you pastor get picked out of a crowd by
 somebody who doesn't know anything about them and just zero straight in on
 whatever they're going through and just give and breathe life and hope into it. I
 just think it's the perfect example of Father's Heart. I love it. I love it.
 To David and all the prophets that we know we're very very grateful for you.
 We kicked off the school this week. We did. Yep, we met all the new students. We
 did orientation, which is always weird.
</p><ul>
  <li>Which is, it is weird, but it's fun too.
 They're so excited.
 There's so much excitement in the room.
  </li><li>Well, we're so excited too.
  </li><li>And then we get to eat food.
  </li><li>Right, we're all gonna meal together.
  </li><li>So that was, you know.
  </li><li>And we kick off proper this week.
  </li><li>We do.
 You're teaching this week.
  </li><li>Well, you're teaching too,
 'cause I have a daughter's appointment
 halfway through my teaching.
  </li><li>Well, so we're doing it together.
  </li><li>It's all good. - Yeah, we're teaching
 and how to hear the voice of God, it was awesome.
 What else happened this week?
 I feel really social this week.
 You do?
 No, I feel like we were.
 Oh, no, we were.
 We were social.
 We we had people over for the new direction party.
 It's not new direction.
 It's one direction and we are now official fans of one direction.
 One direction.
 I think it's funny that there is a global phenomenon called one direction,
 which is essentially a buy band who don't want to be called a buy band,
 but thus they are a boy band from the country I grew up in and they're all over the world
 and everyone knows about them except us.
 We found out about them last week when they came to Nashville or two weeks ago.
 Right, but we didn't find out even that.
 They came and we didn't even pay attention to that.
 But then we just found out their name.
 We did and we watched videos.
 So we ordered the documentary because we liked documentaries in general.
 Yes, we do.
 And it was just to me, I just love watching Destiny unfold.
 And so here's these five kids that go on a talent show individually and then get picked into a band and then their life changes and you just see them fly all over the world and.
 Also my love the assignment guy with the same guy's name Simon Cowell,
 so cat Simon Cowell picks them out and puts them together.
 Yeah, I went to school with Simon Cowell.
 Sure you did.
 No, I didn't.
 Moving on.
 Simon Cowell looks much older than you baby.
 You're way too hard to be the same age as Simon Cowell.
 love you. You're amazing.
  </li><li>Just let it clear.
  </li><li>Why did you make me start hole 13?
 Can we talk about hole 30 for a second?
  </li><li>Why did I make you start?
 That doesn't sound very powerful, darling.
  </li><li>I don't feel very powerful.
 I feel like I want to eat carbs immediately.
  </li><li>But I...
  </li><li>I'm using all my power, not eating chocolate.
  </li><li>I decided to start hole 30
 because Charlene and Shannon were both doing hole 30.
  </li><li>Tell me about hole 30.
 I know I'm on it, but what's the premise?
  </li><li>The premise is it's anti-human.
 like and don't eat it for a month.
 Yes.
 It's an anti-inflammatory diet.
 So basically, it's to bring inflammation down in your body in any gut issues or thyroid
 issues or whatever that might get triggered by just things that we eat are removed.
 So you're doing a lot of whole foods, raw foods, nothing packaged, nothing, no grains,
 no sugars, no sweeteners, not even honey or maple syrup.
 Do you hear that?
 That's my little tummy crying huge tears because you said no honey, no sugar, no carbs.
 I know honey.
 You're doing so well, 60s and darling.
 I haven't complained once.
 Okay.
 No.
 You haven't complained once.
 I'm proud to have the definition of perseverance.
 No.
 Right.
 But in the midst of you removing all the foods I'd like to eat, there was some amazing
 high points this week. Yes, there was. I've had some
 planning moments with spaghetti squash, which I didn't know that you could grow spaghetti
 inside of a squash, but you can. It's amazing. With a tomato basil thing that you just made
 up. Do you know basil garlic? Here's what I've noticed is generally speaking, when you
 follow recipes, it's not as good as when you just decide to free will your makeup stuff
 as you go on.
 Well, I have more fun making up stuff, but I have to say like some of the recipes that
 I have followed like the one from against El Green, the Korean beef noodle bowl, I never
 would have come up with that on my own.
 And I love that.
 Ranted.
 So, but you're right.
 I liked it.
 I will take back that statement.
 I tend to do better freestyling than falling because I followed a recipe this afternoon.
 It was horrific.
 It was horrific.
 But then maybe it's just that that person happens to like horrific food and that's why
 they thought it was a danger you run into.
 Right.
 problem, just having us problem with user aggregated reviews, such as Pinterest. Hey,
 here's some stuff I like.
 That's a big word.
 Or Yelp.
 I hear some reviews that just because 500 people say this is like the best Thai food
 I've ever eaten, they may not have eaten very good Thai food.
 Right.
 And that's the problem with these things. I would like to find a user review site from
 people I actually trust.
 So you could like friend reviewed.
 Well, not necessarily friends because not a lot.
 Not as I was saying, not a lot.
 What I meant to say that is some of your friends
 won't even have the same taste as you.
 What I like to be able to click on a person
 and see what they like.
 So I get, you know, you can build up a bunch of people
 that you follow who like the same stuff as you
 and you can assess, oh, they got similar taste as me
 and then follow their recommendations.
 I'm sure something like that exists.
 If it does, and I've been hiding a rock under a rock
 somewhere, please let me know.
  </li><li>Yeah, rock.
  </li><li>And you also, speaking of food,
 made these things you call chicken poppers,
 which sound like drugs for foul,
 but tell me what chicken poppers are.
  </li><li>They're basically flattened chicken meatballs,
 but they're made with--
  </li><li>They make them sound so appetizing.
  </li><li>They're made with ground chicken and zucchini,
 and cilantro and green onions.
  </li><li>We probably need a place on our website
 where you can post your recipes.
  </li><li>We have a place on the website.
  </li><li>I don't.
  </li><li>Really?
 Under love mummings, sometimes I put them.
  </li><li>Right, but that's kind of baby recipes.
 We need like a separate place for awesome recipes
 that are Allen approved.
  </li><li>Awesome Allen approved recipes right there.
  </li><li>Like I ate them and I give them the thumbs up.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, you seem thrilled with that idea.
 (laughs)
 You, it's been a food you got a cookbook.
  </li><li>I did.
 Danielle Walker released her second cookbook,
 which she's the against all grain chick.
 And it's called Meals Made Simple.
 So I'm currently, you can't tell,
 but right now, even as we speak, I am making almond milk.
 Dun, dun, dun.
  </li><li>Do you know how food sells almond milk?
  </li><li>Yeah, but they sell almond milk
 for a whole bunch of junk in it.
  </li><li>Yeah, but they also sell the orange one
 that doesn't have a junk at all, apparently.
  </li><li>It has some junk, still has a couple junk things.
 Some junk.
  </li><li>Okay.
 I don't know how you can milk almonds.
 They must have really tiny nipples.
 (laughs)
 very carefully.
 Okay, move on.
 Am I going to a haircut?
 You did.
 What's the problem with my haircut?
 Well, right now, right now you've been playing with it and it had wax in it, so it's standing
 up a bit like Bart Simpson.
 What's the problem with my head in general?
 Well, it's large.
 We should probably start and talk about the time you got me a baseball cap for my Christmas,
 people who have seen me realize I've pretty much now where baseball caps non-stop and this
 is the reason my whole life for 39 years I've never found a baseball cap that fit me.
 This year as you found too and saw where they're pretty much non-stop.
 So I was like, babe, these are awesome.
 They fit me.
 Where did you get them?
 And you said.
 It was like great big head.com.
 No, you said I googled big fat head.
 big fat head. But they're great hats.
 Right. Forget all of that.
 You can't be as smart as you are not. Have a big head.
 I'm so bored of everything we've talked about for one reason.
 Why? New iPhones get released this coming week.
 Tuesday.
 And the trouble is I'm teaching all day Tuesday and everyone's going to be live
 tweeting what's going on. So I'm turning off Twitter.
 I'm turning off notifications. Please don't text me anything because Monday and
 I'm going to go to his damn teaching all day.
 I'm going to come home Tuesday night.
 I'm just going to sit down and I'm going to watch the keynote as if I know nothing
 about the fact that you can text me things.
 It doesn't bother me at all.
 OK, text, AJ.
 But we go through this every year in September.
 You have to have a day of no contact.
 Well, it's a good idea.
 Well, it's all right.
 Let me tell you some listeners questions.
 Got a brilliant question here from Angela.
 Angela said this.
 Let me read it.
 And then I'll tell you what I think it means.
 One thing you didn't address was age.
 The grandma in the article said start young.
 Courtship typically requires full adulthood.
 What do you guys think?
 Oh, you're talking about courtship.
 Okay.
 So what do you think a good age for dating done right is?
 In your twenties?
 Why?
 I just, I don't think you're mature enough when you're below that to be messing around with it.
 And I think I know what to her 19 year olds.
 Okay.
 Name one.
 No, that'd be embarrassing.
 No, I just.
 I think you Maggie Simpson.
 I think we'll be mature Lisa Simpson is already mature.
 She's only like eight.
 Who are you talking about?
 Do we know what's the name?
 The Simpsons.
 Oh, damn.
 Oh, they're not real.
 Oh, actually now that you mentioned the Simpsons, I am.
 I just need to do something for just a second.
 I might be slightly addicted to tapped out.
  </li><li>Adj
 relationship with the Simpsons.
 She hates the TV show.
 I mean, it is too weak a word
 for her absolute revulsion for the show.
 And yet she is non-stop playing the Simpsons
 tapped out on her iPhone.
  </li><li>Because I have my own barbarian nerds.
 I have a horde of barbarian nerds
 that I get to use to attack other people like Chris McClarney.
  </li><li>But doesn't, yeah.
  </li><li>Let's see.
 maybe could we do this later so you can finish the podcast sorry sorry I just need to collect
 them because otherwise it they don't continue to produce barbarian nerds for me.
 Okay let's get back to Angela's question oh yes mid 20s mid 20s I don't think there's an age limit I
 think it's stage no age yeah I'm just sort of I thought she wanted an actual age oh sorry so I
 thought I'd throw out a I just I think dating or whatever you want to call it
 before then even if it's courting type dating before you're 20 you probably it's
 probably gonna not end up I don't know great I just I would love it if people
 would not go through the amount of heartache that they go through so that when
 they actually do find the one they don't have so much baggage okay I suppose
 that's more my angle. There certainly could be 18 and 19 year olds and whatever that are
 mature enough. I think about in songs, I says, do not wake in love until it's so desired.
 I think the best way forward is to let your heart be awakened by someone, rather than you
 going to find someone too awake in your heart for you. So I think about you, like I hadn't
 date anybody in eight years. Sounds so weird when I say that now. But anyway, that was
 true. I had dated anyone for eight years.
 Me neither. Eight years.
 And then when I saw you, at first, you were my teacher on school, so I don't think anything
 of it. But when I saw you outside of that context, something happened without me doing
 anything. And I couldn't backpedal fast enough to get it to stop doing like basically my
 heart was awakened by you. I saw you and I thought, there's some fine pieces of Canadian
 engineering and febricels.
 You do this up, you baby.
 You've been doing it.
 Wow.
 It's there.
 It's here.
 It's there.
 Okay, you can stop now.
 But my point was I didn't think anyway, I don't want to get into this whole topic because
 we did a whole podcast on it, but I think stage not age.
 I hope that helps Angela.
 And by the way, you're accent when we first met fantastic.
 Thank you.
 Just saying.
 Oh, here's an interesting thing Blake, our producer pointed this out.
 So last week we talked about my accent fading.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And this week, David Wagner gave me a prophetic word
 about my accent, about how my accent was gonna be used
 to open doors, is that what he said?
 I didn't even listen to it,
 but he said something about my accent would grant me favor,
 which, let's face facts, I get away with murder.
  </li><li>You totally do.
  </li><li>Not quite literally.
 Well, not even remotely literally.
 But I get away with a lot.
  </li><li>'Cause we're just not out there trying to find my accent.
  </li><li>All right, we're done.
 Let's talk about this week.
 Let's talk about this week.
 I want to talk about work, life, balance.
 Work, life, balance, go.
 I think it's very important that when we talk about any topic, it should be clear that we
 are by no means experts at all.
 We don't talk about these topics because we've arrived and behold, we will disperse our wisdom
 to poor peons and minions.
 Behold, listen to our...
 It's not that at all.
 I think we are constantly thinking about a lot of these topics and when we're with our
 friends and the people we admire were picking their brains about how to do things better.
 But let me start with this.
 H.H. Jones, you work.
 My question to you is do you have to work?
 Do you like to work or do you love your work?
 I love my work.
 What do you love about it?
 I love the people.
 I love that I get to shape things.
 What does that mean to people who don't understand?
 I'm a builder type person.
 I like to get a vision, make a vision a reality, get a new vision, make that vision a real.
 I like to build things.
 We have huge latitude to do that.
 We do.
 Which we're very grateful.
 Because Jeff and Becky are amazing.
 Their whole approach to their staff is there's 40 acres, go build it, cause if you need help
 or money.
 Right.
 Which is just remarkable.
 Right.
 Works really well for our personalities.
 So I love that.
 I love that we get to watch lives get transformed by God.
 I mean, just like the coolest thing ever, I could be, I don't know, working as a photographer,
 you know, doing something different.
 And I wouldn't see the impact that I get to see.
 Right.
 Here's my observation based on you, that I have observed you for many years now, is
 I would imagine that you are probably wired fairly similarly to me in that we both like
 working.
 We like the process of starting something, of wrestling through how stuff works.
 We actually enjoy putting energy, thought and intent behind what we're doing.
 Right.
 And for me, that's normal.
 But I guess, speaking to lots of people, some people, their approach to work is us just
 9 to 5, it's just the JOB.
 I guess we've been very privileged in that, well, we had a fair share of JOBs.
 I don't know why I really enjoy working.
 I enjoy the whole process of being on and working almost as much as I enjoy the process
 of being off and just switched off.
 Right.
 Would you say it's true about yourself?
 Do I enjoy working as much as I enjoy being off?
 Well, forget that.
 Do you enjoy work, like the actual process of working?
 Whether that's...
 Yes.
 I love it.
 I love you, answer to question.
 Okay, good.
 So, I don't need any call for it.
 Where do you think you learn your work ethic from?
 my dad, well both of my parents worked. My mom was a high school teacher, she still is,
 she's 77 and she's still the supply teaching. But my dad, I would honestly say it was a
 workaholic, but he was all about excellence and we just sort of grew up understanding
 that you work hard. And you work hard in school and you work hard wherever you're working
 because basically it's a privilege to have a job and you know that kind of stuff.
 So how do you know you're not a workaholic?
 I suppose that you can rest, that you can.
 My dad wasn't great at resting.
 Not never getting to meet your dad was you would you say based on your understanding
 of your dad then and your understanding of what we you know process on a daily basis.
 Now, would you say your father's identity was wrapped up in his work?
 Like who he was was what he did.
 Um, I don't know if it was, it might have been a little bit that I honestly
 think that my dad just couldn't cope with life.
 And so he kept himself really busy.
 Right.
 I think he had so much unresolved hurt that he just stayed super busy.
 So if he wasn't working, then he was at the pool.
 was swimming, he was competing, you know, he just was always busy.
 Yeah, I would probably say I learned my work ethic from my dad too. And my mother, my, you know,
 my mom, though she was a stay-at-home mom and at a job before we arrived on the scene and
 in our later years, we do supply teaching, lecturing universities and whatnot. She, you know, whatever
 she was doing, whether it was looking at the kids or housework or, I mean, my mother's just an
 incredibly productive person. But I think I probably learned my work ethic from my dad.
 I think my challenge was I never found anything I like to do until I went to my second university.
 As an all through school, I never applied myself because I wasn't interested in any of it. And
 today, even as a fully grown mature adult, I find it very difficult to do things I'm not interested
 which I'm sure is not uncommon. But the whole extrinsic motivation to do something for a reason
 other than you want to do, I was just never motivated to do that. And so if you imagine going
 through school and high school and even my first year university I was like, "Oh my gosh, it's so
 boring." I think once I went to my second university and found something I actually loved and was
 interested in combined with my love of being diligent and working, that was catalytic.
 And I think now that we are so fortunate to be doing what we absolutely love to be doing
 and take tremendous joy in it, I can't believe we get to do what we do.
 I love our job.
 I love our people we pass through.
 I love the people we work with.
 They're such an incredible team.
 I love where we live.
 I love where we work.
 And so why wouldn't you want to just give your all?
 I love that process.
 Right.
 So that's the work part.
 What about life?
 What brings you life?
 What brings me life?
 I think I'm still in the process of figuring that out.
 I'm figuring out little things.
 Basically, creative stuff.
 I tried something new this week.
 I went to Zumba.
 I've never, ever been to Zumba.
 tell me what the zumba is.
  </li><li>Well, there's a lot of pelvic thrusting
 and things like that. - I think I like it already.
  </li><li>It's like a mix of, I don't know,
 it seems like salsa dancing and stuff like that
 with aerobics. - Less interesting.
  </li><li>With even less interested.
  </li><li>You know, basically you are moving for an hour straight
 and somebody's smiling and you go in,
 you're doing awesome, keep going, just 17 more songs.
  </li><li>It's like one of the lower levels of hell to me,
 but you enjoyed that?
  </li><li>Yeah, I went with my cousin Holly and it was...
  </li><li>Did you enjoy it 'cause you were with another person?
  </li><li>Probably I would not go back
 if it wasn't for the fact that I would go back with...
  </li><li>Let me ask you a question.
 Keep the variables the same.
 You are with Holly, your cousin.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Who you enjoy being with.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You can either spend an hour in a coffee store
 or you can spend an hour at a Zumba.
  </li><li>Well.
  </li><li>Which one did you enjoy more?
  </li><li>I would probably enjoy the coffee store more,
 but my mind says I need exercise and be better for my body to do the other one.
 You're an example to us all, Darnit.
 I'm going to email the Pope right now and see if you can get sainted.
 That possible why you're still alive.
 I don't know.
 I'll Google that.
 I never mind.
 All right.
 So clearly being with other people clearly is interesting.
 You put Zumba under creative stuff.
 Well, I didn't.
 I said creative stuff.
 Oh, and I tried zoom at this.
 I wasn't suggesting that.
 What sort of creative outlets do like love,
 photography. And I used to like painting, but not so much anymore.
 Well, I don't even love it so much anymore.
 Well, because I picked up trying to do visual arts again, which is what I went to high school
 for because I went to a creative arts high school. And one of the first things I painted
 when I started painting again was a lion, which happened to be slightly smiling. And so you
 i call you the smiling lion and i feel like i have to i refer to as the happy line
 i'm whatever i said baby if you can find a market for people who want happy jungle animals who you
 could make bank and rather than take that encouragement yeah you just decided well the knee looked at me
 in horror when you said what are you gonna do with that smile like flying where you gonna buy this
  </li><li>It's panicking that you would want to put it up somewhere.
  </li><li>Well, I know.
  </li><li>I'm still sorry, I'm in the discouragement.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, it's too late now, forget it.
  </li><li>We could try body paint.
  </li><li>Ooh.
 Can I do it with a smiley lion?
  </li><li>Do you get joy out of cooking?
  </li><li>I do if there are not anybody hanging off my pants.
  </li><li>Don't know, that was one time and I'm four hundred Jesus.
  </li><li>You used that funny.
 So he's MJ right now, he's so clingy
 and he's always hanging on to my pants.
 I'm trying anything up, but he says it really clearly,
 up, up.
 So how could I have to pick him up?
  </li><li>Okay, so if you get to cook
 but you don't have to cook for the kids,
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Then that's...
  </li><li>If I get to cook like just,
 and then I wouldn't want to use a recipe,
 I wouldn't just cook and be creative
 'cause that's when it's life to me.
  </li><li>Is it more life to you when this people coming over?
 We have some good friends coming over,
 we're all gonna have food together.
  </li><li>Yeah, that would be fun.
  </li><li>Are you stressed about cooking for them,
 or does it up to you for the show?
  </li><li>I'm never stressed about cooking.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>'Cause I love to cook.
 And I think I'm pretty good at it.
 So I think that's why it's not stressful for me.
 But the thing is, if people come over,
 you host them, I cook.
  </li><li>That's right, I show them my juggling,
 I do some ventriloquil.
  </li><li>No, but I mean, you tend to put out all the pretty plates
 and make sure everything looks gorgeous and whatever
 and put everything in nice little containers
 that I make and all that kind of stuff.
 And I just have to do the food.
 If I had to do all the make the thing look pretty,
 that would, I don't have that thing.
 I don't have that gene.
  </li><li>Right.
 Which is funny, isn't it?
  </li><li>It's funny because a whole bunch of people,
 a whole bunch of ladies that I know recently are saying,
 "Oh, we're decorating for a fall."
 And I totally admire people that decorate for a fall.
 I just, there's nothing in me that is like,
 I must decorate for fall.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm not aware of that.
 I mean, I'm aware that it happens.
 You know what I'm aware of?
 I'm aware of, so I wanna round say pottery barn,
 Williams and Sonoma, and apart from the large,
 functional objects in there, like sofa, bed, duvet,
 curtains, you know how there's all that neck-neck stuff?
 And you're just thinking, why would I buy bronze doubt,
 antlers?
 Why would I buy two doves in crime?
  </li><li>Why would I buy that last jar?
 And to me, it just looks like insane nonsense
 that nobody in the right mind would buy
 until I go to people's houses who've bought that
 and say nonsense and it looks amazing.
 And I just think, wow, that's a skill set.
 Like when we walk into the cafe, I know Jenna
 and some other ladies went into the cafe
 and made it look nice, but by making it look nice,
 they had like dried reeds and obscure red plates.
 And never in a million years, but I think I'm going to buy this box of potpourri read
 spheres and I'll put them in this vase that I just bought.
 I would never think that.
 Right.
 Yeah, it adds something to the room.
 We need to find people who are good at that and then let them loosen our house.
 Let's clean it first.
 We need to find people who are really good at cleaning and love cleaning.
 And the one that can let them clean our house.
 We have a plan.
 If you're out there, call me.
 There are a large number of people that I have noticed in my observations that seem
 to love the great outdoors, they love nature.
 I love nature.
 Well, okay.
 Okay.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 There's no need for any build up.
 You've already answered my question.
 Next, I was going to say, how to understand why you like nature and what it does for you.
 I feel like I can breathe.
 I just like being outside.
 We have air purifiers in our house.
 They're from Switzerland.
 I understand.
 It's just different.
 Outside fears feels beautiful.
 I feel closer to God.
 And I probably doesn't make any sense.
 I literally feel closer to God when I'm out in beautiful nature and there's not buildings
 around me or whatever.
 I just...
 And that's the experience when I'm in an apple store.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 It's almost the same thing, baby.
 So, no, I go on.
 I'm being serious.
 No, so...
 Do you like being outside?
 Uh-huh.
 So, a couple of weeks ago, we took the small group leaders away and we spent a good chunk
 of time floating down a river in an inner tube.
 And so many people were just loving it.
 I was just waiting for it to be over.
 Right.
 So tell me what's that process?
 How does that bring you life?
 I don't.
 I just I enjoy it.
 It makes me happy.
 I feel my love tank filling up just by being outside, surrounded by beautiful things.
 And I mean, added bonus was beautiful people with us.
 So both got like quality time and having fun and stuff plus on this river.
 Yeah, it was great.
 So I'm just thinking in terms of work, life, balance, we rarely go outside.
 Right.
 Other than to our car.
 Well, I that's part of why I started running.
 I lay into a little secret.
 One of the day we took the family to was at Radner Lake.
 I secretly enjoyed that.
 You heard him, folks.
 I did.
 I it's what I enjoyed.
 I was immediately frustrated that you enjoyed the children whining and asking
 how much farther they had to go.
 But the children will whine wherever you are.
 That's very true.
 So you may as well pick a context that you actually like.
 Yeah.
 It was a little too far, let's be honest.
 You know, you look at the trail thing and you're like, oh, it's totally doable.
 That's just, you know, up and around and down.
 But no, it takes way longer than that.
 You actually have to use your legs.
 But once I go over the shock that I had no LTE or 3G or actually any cell
 from signal at all.
 And once I kind of gave myself to the process that, okay, I'm outside and I
 knew that I had snacks with me.
 I actually quite enjoyed being with the family and I quite enjoyed
 the whole walking process.
 I just find like a buggy, like an adult buggy I could send someone who could push me.
 I'd probably like it.
 But no, I did.
 And that was probably my first glimpse.
 Oh, yeah, I could see why people do this, but never in a million years.
 If I have a day after, I think, you know, I want to do this.
 I want to go riding or like.
 But once I'm there, I actually wanted to go like every weekend since we went.
 I think, oh, it'd be so nice to go back.
 I'd love to go back.
 Especially since it started in the cool off now and it's not in the high.
 90s. All right. Talk to me about this. Where do you think our life needs balance?
 Well, I think because we work a lot and we're trying to spend every moment that we're home,
 that the kids are home focused on them. I think which is an exercise in character growth.
 I think we need to do better at focusing on one another. Like we used to have date nights once
 once a week, we don't really get to do that anymore.
 I mean, that happens like once every six weeks.
 Yeah, but see, I tend to think that when I can see to having people over to the house,
 that that's kind of like a date.
 That's not a date that is not a date.
 So gonna wedding, which isn't something I like to do that in my head is like a date.
 Oh, OK.
 I'll give you like a third of a date point for that bonus.
 I will redeem that third of a date point.
 when this podcast is over. Yeah. So I think that the we end and like I said earlier, our
 I mean, our house is a disaster because we're trying to prioritize the kids and
 fleeing my homeland. Look to baby, you suggested burning the house down today and starting
 Oh, because there's no possible way we could get it clean.
 Well, here's what's happened is we go through phases where we don't
 notice how bad the house is because we're running around frantically.
 Right.
 And then we stop and we look at the house and go, dear, God, this is just
 horrendous.
 Yeah.
 And then what happens is we may use a whole weekend to clean a section of the house.
 Right.
 But we never get the whole house done.
 And yeah, it's a.
 This is why we need minions.
 But you know what?
 Our floors look amazing.
 They do the little robot is doing is working.
 Yes.
 Blessed assurance off.
 I love that little sucker.
 Just charge up, let it go.
 Our floors, I would argue, have never looked as good as they do right now.
 They look fantastic.
 I've only the rest of the house looked fantastic.
 You know what?
 I'm just waiting on people to invent robots to do that stuff.
 Right.
 OK.
 Maybe it was a new iPhone six.
  </li><li>Well, how tidy your kitchen robot.
  </li><li>All right, so we've identified some areas
 our life needs balance.
 What do you think are,
 in the areas that we do have balance, right?
 So yes, we need to tweak some stuff in our life.
 But there's a lot that we do have kind of in balance.
 What do you think are some of the keys
 to us finding that balance?
 Like over the years, we've gotten into a routine,
 and a rhythm.
 What do you think are some of the things I've contributed to that?
 I think we try and play to each other's strengths.
 So for example, our rhythm right now is when the kids get off the bus, you take apart their
 lunch bags and then you do their homework with them.
 I start the dinner right now making two different meals because something for the kids, something
 for us.
 But that's kind of typical.
 So we just have our ways that we sort of cross over and get stuff done.
 All right.
 I was thinking that you're absolutely right.
 That's a very granular level.
 I was thinking, I was thinking higher level, what are some of the principles that we've
 learned that have helped us maintain some level of balance?
 I'm sure if Jeff Dollar was on this podcast, he'd laugh at the notion that we even think
 we have balance.
 I'm sure he would.
 I think we're doing a pretty good job.
 aside the areas that we need to improve on.
  </li><li>Don't add a higher level.
 I don't know, what do you think, Pam?
  </li><li>I don't know, I think,
 I think of course learning to say no really helped us.
 Like we could be way busier than we are.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The demands on our time could pull us into areas
 that we don't want to go.
 So we're pretty good at saying no.
  </li><li>Yeah, my more recent revelation though,
 from like a month ago,
 I also need to learn to say yes, because I need more people contacting.
 Right. But there you go. You learn to say no to some things that you can say yes to other things.
 Yeah.
 I think we've found the beauty in help. We have a plethora of people who come help us with the kids,
 whether it's babysitting or watching them or just helping us.
 Yeah.
 And we have amazing sitters that when the kids are asleep, they clean and they do
 whatever. So I mean, it's just such a huge help.
 But actually not trying to do it all on your own is a huge, is a huge key.
 Yeah.
 And then honestly, I think I know we talked about this before, but I think we do
 brilliantly when we have systems and well, some of the we when we have systems
 when we stick to the systems, right, when we put stuff in place, like when we get
 into a rhythm, like you said earlier, it's just there's a lot of stuff that just
 works like clockwork, which is amazing.
 I think I'm very fortunate in that I can get large portions of my life balance from just being alone,
 which works well because he'd like to be out a lot.
 So, for example, today was mostly spent tinkering on the website,
 which some people would say, "Well, that's work."
 But for me, it really isn't.
 It's, I think that's probably like, you know, we got lots of positions.
 No, you're winding down if you do that.
 Yeah.
 You know, so Ben Hausen, for example, who's a professional musician who's always on tour.
 So he's playing his guitar a lot.
 I bet when he comes home,
 he will idly plays guitar and some people say, oh my gosh, you're all playing a guitar.
 You know, why don't you turn off?
 But for him, that is unwinding and that is life to him.
 It's just in a different context.
 Right.
 All right.
 Something I'm actually, I mean, we talked about tapped out already, but something I'm
 trying to work on is having little things that help me unwind like you can
 tinker on the internet.
 Right.
 And you play as a Simpsons tapped out, which is
 I do at the moment.
 And you love it.
 But in like 10 days, the barbarian nerds are going to go away and then I'll
 probably stop playing it. So that's the cross you have to bear
 down. You know, two thoughts for you. Yes. As we close. Oh,
 first thing is we have just launched, we being grace in
 her just launched information about the heaven declares
 conferences happening in October. And I am so excited. I may
 squeal like a little girl. Because we are three of my favorite
 people coming with arty Kendall, world renowned theologian
 an author of I don't know how many books. He's going to be speaking. John Paul Jackson,
 who pretty much taught me everything I know in many respects about the prophetic. He was
 useless in John Paul's teaching all the time back in Scotland. I'm really excited to have
 him here. And Bobby Conner, our favorite Texan Southern Baptist who turned into a prophet,
 they're all going to be a great center. I would really, really encourage if you can
 get to Nashville to be in this conference, please come on over. All the information
 is over at the website, heavendeclares.info. Not heavendeclares.com, heaven declares all
 on word .info, I N F O. Babe, I don't know if I've read this to you, but I want to read
 you a little review that we got this week on iTunes. This made my week. I just loved
 it. This is from Amy Marin. I hope I said your name right. Thank you, Amy, for this
 beautiful comment. She said, I stumbled across this podcast 100% on accident and I've been
 been hooked ever since. Alan and A.J. delivered their teaching in such an everyday normal
 way that anyone can listen easily to the message and feel closer to God. I found the first
 episode at a time in my life when I was really struggling to feel a connection to God and
 I instantly felt a connection to A.J. I'm planning a trip to the church soon.
 Well, anyway, I bring that up because not only was it a huge encouragement, but I'm
 not quite worked out how iTunes ranks podcasts. It seems to be a bit of a dark arts, but what
 I have noticed is that when people leave positive reviews, we tend to go up in there, not necessarily
 their charts, but in their new noteworthy and in their featured area. So can I ask you a favor?
 If you are loving the podcast, can we ask you to take some time this week, just a minute or so,
 just go over to iTunes, leave us a review. We super appreciate that. And the more positive
 of reviews we get, the more exposure we get on iTunes, which means people are going to
 randomly find our podcast just like Amy Marand did, and we want to bless people.
 Cheers, Amy.
 Thanks for the review.
 Well, listen, I hope you have an amazing iPhone 6 week.
 Well, I actually have an idea, babe.
 What are you doing?
 I have two ideas for a podcast that maybe we should get them to vote on whether we should
 do them or not.
 Go for it.
 So the first one is, we'll just try and do sound effects,
 throughout the podcast,
 and we'll see who does better sound effects.
 Good idea?
 Yeah, I think it's gonna be awesome.
 And then the second one is to talk about stuff
 like when you're completely bored,
 where do you go in your head?
 And that'd be interesting.
  </li><li>Nobody wants to know the inside of my head when I'm bored.
  </li><li>Like for example, like if I'm bored,
 I start putting people's features on a potato in my head,
 and that just makes it so much easier to pay attention,
 'cause I think I'm looking at a talking potato, right?
  </li><li>This is terrifying.
 Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us this week.
 We hope to return to regular programming next week.
 Have an amazing week.
  </li><li>Bye. - Thanks for tuning in.
