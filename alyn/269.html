<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes sir.<br/>
 Episode 269.<br/>
 Woohoo!<br/>
 Of keeping up with the Joneses.<br/>
 A very warm welcome if you're just joining us.
 My name is Alan.<br/>
 My name is AJ.<br/>
 And we usually start with a weekly catch up.
 We do.<br/>
 Weekly catch up?<br/>
 Not sure how much happened this week.<br/>
 We went to work.<br/>
 You spoke.<br/>
 I spoke and I don't remember the last time I spoke on a Sunday morning, but I haven't
 built up speaking stamina.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And I probably had a speaking hangover most of Monday and Tuesday.
 And what I mean by that is I think I was so excited to come and speak.
 And I was so excited to share what I felt the Holy Spirit put on my heart.
 I was so excited to just, yeah, to be with people and teach that I don't think I allocated
 any time or energy for after I spoke.<br/>
 And then I probably had a adrenaline fatigue because I remember after second
 service, getting off the stage, you were seeing.
 So you were wrapping up.<br/>
 And as soon as my bum hit the seat while you were wrapping up, it was like
 somebody unplugged me and I was like, yeah, I'm done.
 I need to get out of here right this instant because I'm so frazzled and so
 drained.<br/>
 And I wasn't prepared for that.<br/>
 So I'm trying to be better gauging my energy for this week.
 And it's funny because it's not like we don't speak a lot, but it's mostly on the school and that's different like it.
 Holy different rhythm.<br/>
 It it it. I mean, by the end of Tuesday, you're exhausted and you've certainly spoken for more hours, but there's something about Sunday mornings.
 Well, there's also like on the school, there's a rhythm.
 Yeah.<br/>
 There's an eruption.<br/>
 There's pause.<br/>
 There's questions.<br/>
 There's a relationship that's been growing and growing and growing.
 Whereas on Sunday morning, especially I was teaching on money.
 And so a topic like that, you're already, you've got your work cut out for you.
 Yes.<br/>
 Because people, everybody's going to come with their preconceived ideas.
 Everyone's got something.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 And I think part of the part, I'm going to talk about this on Sunday when I speak,
 but part of the problem, especially for me as a teacher, is I never like unresolved ideas.
 Yes.<br/>
 So for example, with something as large and as potentially controversial as money,
 You can say something that's true, but there probably needs to be about 92
 asterisks with what you're saying.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 In this context of this time, yes, I'm aware that this Bible verse says this, but this
 verse says this and considered this context.
 Yes.<br/>
 And you don't have time to do that.<br/>
 And I'm not anymore.<br/>
 So I leave a statement out and sometimes I'll do that so that people will ponder it.
 Or it's a, you know, it's a sledgehammer of a thought.
 Well, you did assign pondering homework.
 I did assign homework.<br/>
 What can we get into our main topic?<br/>
 But the reason I love assigning homework is I was actually I was meeting with Jeff earlier this weekend
 We were just I'm sorry earlier today<br/>
 And I was talking to him about I went to school to be a teacher. Yeah, and one of the things I learned is
 kind of sad, but the methodology that most
 Preachers in America used today is actually the least effective form of teaching. Oh, so
 you know<br/>
 me standing at the front and speaking at people for 20 to 40 minutes is a really inefficient way of communicating.
 Yes.<br/>
 And retention and stuff like that is lower.
 Oh, so that's for retention.<br/>
 And actually for transformation.<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 So there's got to be better ways and there are better ways, but they're very hard to do on mass.
 Yes.<br/>
 But that's why I gave people homework to do because hopefully people will think about it,
 be engaged with it all week and process it and work it through.
</p><ul>
  <li>And have questions and yeah,
 there's something beautiful about that.
  </li><li>How are you not freezing to death?
 I'm wearing four layers, literally four,
 and I am so cold.
  </li><li>And I am barefoot.
  </li><li>I, well, I have skinny socks on.
  </li><li>Yeah, but you, I don't know, I feel great right now.
  </li><li>Oh, it's so cold.
  </li><li>As previously profs signed in previous episode,
 you will hear a jic and something that's cold.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm so sorry.
  </li><li>I'm revising till about me.
  </li><li>I'm gripping my hands under the table like,
  </li><li>My nose, I can't feel my nose anymore.
  </li><li>I thought that was hungover Monday and Tuesday.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You, all the students taught this week.
  </li><li>Well, I think hungover is a really bad way of putting it.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Because people are not gonna.
  </li><li>The reason I say hungover is people go out and drink
 and have a great time and then it comes at a cost
 the next two days.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I had a great time teaching and then it came
 at a cost the next two days.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's kind of the lag, like the jet lag.
  </li><li>It's, yeah, it's, yeah, it's, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, but yeah, let's say teaching lag, right?
 And I was like, whoa.
 And part of that is just out of practice.
 If you're used to running and then stop running
 and then go for a run, you don't have the same legs
 as when you did it.
 Anyway, I think you get the point.
 I don't even get any more analogies.
  </li><li>And then--
  </li><li>Our students were teaching.
  </li><li>Yeah, our students taught this week.
  </li><li>I didn't get to sit in this year.
 How did they do it?
  </li><li>They did a wonderful job.
 Very, very, very impressive.
  </li><li>Yeah, I heard great things from the staff too.
 Well done students were teaching that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The rest of the week's a blur, I'll be honest with you.
 And you're right, we're not like fully through the week.
 No, we're not.
 So we still have things to do.
 You painted a room or yes, I started painting Abby's room.
 What was the look?
 Cause I went, yes.
 No, no, I was pondering.
 It's chalkboard paint.
 So she wants two of her walls done with chalkboard paint.
 We're trying to be a graffiti artist.
 Well, the thing is she is an artist.
 She draws non-stop all the time.
 She's very, very good at it.
 And so it made sense to me when she was like,
 I want a chalkboard wall so that I can draw my characters
 that I make on it and make massive cartoons
 and all that kind of stuff.
 And I was like, yes, I get it.
 So the tricky bit with it is because it's chalkboard paint
 and you want it to be really smooth,
 you have to put it on with foam rollers
 because if you have a nap,
 then it's too bumpy.
 But that also means that it's taking like four or five coats.
 Ever.
 Yeah, to layer it on there and have it smooth
 and have it with no nap.
 And it's also black and black is hard color
 to paint with anyway.
 Yeah, and Abby was like, can I do it?
 And I was like, oh, I mean, this stuff doesn't even go on great.
 And I love painting and have a lot of experience with it.
 And I'm like, wow, this isn't that much fun.
 So I was like, babe, I think I'll paint it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, we're good.
 So, but she'll get to draw on it.
 So that's about it.
 That's it.
 That's our week.
 That's our week.
 We have had tacos twice this week.
 That's all that really matters.
 Well, when you say tacos, what we're actually saying is fajitas.
 We're not having ground beef tacos.
 That's what most people think of.
 I don't know.
 When does a taco become a fajita?
 When you're using steak or chicken instead of ground beef or ground meat.
 But what happens when I have cannella sadder tacos?
 That is not ground beef.
 Well, that's true. I don't know.
 Or tacos.
 Or fajitas, because we have them with onions and peppers that are sauteed along with it.
 Can I have tacos with onions and peppers?
 No, that's when it becomes a fajita.
 We need somebody with authority to speak on this.
 Well, this is a very scary.
 Because I'm not sure Canadian and Scotsmen can lend much way or credibility.
 Yes, we call all of them tacos, but we had, I think, those are fajitas.
 But yes.
 I kind of want to boast on the sous vide.
 So for those of you don't know, a sous vide is so wonderful.
 It's, I don't know, it's French for something, but basically a sous vide is a giant stick.
 It's got a heating element that plugs into an electrical outlet,
 and you stick in a cup of water, which sounds terrible, not a cup, a bowl of water.
 And then you vacuum seal whatever you're going to cook, and you put it in, and typically
 cooks at a very low temperature for a long time.
 And it comes out fully cooked, but looks disgusting, because it hasn't been seared to
  </li><li>It looks great, some version of gray.
  </li><li>But if you're patient.
  </li><li>And you just sear it.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>If your patient is probably the best chicken I've ever had,
 the best salmon I've ever had,
 the best steak I've ever had.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>You just have to think ahead
 because it needs to be in the sous vide for a couple of hours.
  </li><li>So this flank steak,
 which would normally take about eight minutes on the grill,
 four minutes aside or six minutes, one side,
 two minutes on the other,
 took two and a half hours to cook.
 I'll be it from frozen, don't you?
  </li><li>Yes, and we're defrosting a brisket right now.
  </li><li>The first in brisket that's gonna go in for 50 hours.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm so excited about that.
  </li><li>And then you finish it on the grill,
 but the, ah, just the,
 the texture of the meat is unbelievable.
  </li><li>It really is.
 We love meat in case you haven't figured that out.
  </li><li>And then you found me some great fermented cheese.
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>Which I had on my tacos.
  </li><li>And it is good.
 You do like it?
  </li><li>Oh, it's really good.
  </li><li>It's excellent.
 I had it for breakfast this morning.
  </li><li>I know.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm sitting on the couch
 And I see Alan walk by with a spoon and it's from Costco.
 It's basically a bucket of cheese.
 And I was like, I'm sorry, hang on a second.
 Are you just going to eat that with a spoon?
 And he goes, no, I have crackers.
 But of course there's no crackers in his hand or anything.
 Yeah.
 So I don't know.
 What's that?
 Eight thirty in the morning?
 I'm smearing.
 I'm on my keyboard eating crackers and pimento cheese.
 Yeah.
 Not bad.
 I'm starting the day.
 Let me tell you.
 I'm just not a pimento cheese fan.
 Well, it's probably your only flaw, if I'm honest.
 Okay.
 Well, I have to have one. Otherwise, you know, I'm just all right.
 Take me home, baby. We're talking about main topic.
 You're taking me home. I took you home last week.
 We started to use some for something.
 I didn't do you know, my sweet.
 But I came up with the topic and everything
 blushing a little bit.
 And now it's your turn. This is this is your show.
 No, no, no, I'll be honest with you, everybody.
 I know it's been a week where we haven't said we've done much, but it's also been a very busy week.
 It's been a lot of stuff.
 Super busy.
 Yeah.
 And I don't think I'm being lazy.
 I'm kind of being lazy.
 I remember being a school teacher, and I remember the person who taught me how to teach Dr.
 Tom Conlin.
 He came and reviewed me.
 He was my reviewer as I was being certified to teach.
 And I think he reviewed me three times, and he took me science at
 down, you did a great job. I've now watched you teach three times, you've done a great
 job. Here's my worry. What you're doing is unsustainable. And I said, what do you mean?
 He said the level of teaching that you're doing is unsustainable for life. Sometimes
 the kids need fish and chips as well as champagne and caviar. Yeah. And what I'm trying to say
 is tonight is not going to be a champagne and caviar. That's okay. I don't like either
 champagne or caviar. Really?
  </li><li>How are you trying to champagne?
 Can I have your, I don't think I've ever had caviar.
  </li><li>I have, it's okay.
  </li><li>But have your just like roll
 that they put on top of the sushi?
  </li><li>No, I mean, I suppose that could be
 in the same category, no, it doesn't take like--
  </li><li>Try with some fermented cheese,
 it'll probably be perfect.
 My point is like normally we like to come
 and we think about what we're gonna talk about
 and I was just like, baby, my week is just jam packed.
 I think what I'd like to do is unpack a little bit
 about what I was talking about on Sunday.
 Part of that is maybe laziness, but part of it,
 it's like it's a readily available, it's fish and chips.
 And I'm gonna get used to all the works
 and I'm just gonna ask you some questions.
 Plus I've got some great listeners questions
 all about finding father.
 So we'll get to those in a second.
 So I started a four week series all about money.
  </li><li>And blessing. - And blessing.
 And you know, what do we do with that?
 And on Sunday last week, I was introducing
 the concept of blessing and really identifying
 our relationship with my David Wagner is a dear friend being on the podcast many times.
 Kim profs at our church and he gave us that verse Sam 61 verse 11, I want to say.
 It says, "You crown the year with your bounty and your carts are overflowing with abundance."
 I think that's what it says.
 Let me just kind of quickly look up because I don't want to...
 Okay, look, so Sam 65 verse 11, "You crown the year with your bounty and your carts overflow
 with abundance."
 I don't think David knew at the time was over the Christmas break, we got a text.
 We're part of the senior team of Grace Center and Jeff texted us to say, "Guys, brace yourself."
 I think for the first time in Grace Center history, we received offerings in December
 that totaled $1 million in one month.
 Now, are average offerings or like 50,000 a month?
 No, they're 50,000 a week.
 Yes.
 Woo!
 50,000 a week.
 So we've never to my knowledge had a million dollars.
 So I was like, okay, that's significant.
 And we'd also received a prophetic word a couple of months earlier from Bishop Joseph
 Garland and his wife Barbara gave Grace and her prophetic word about four things exploding.
 One of them was finances and resources.
 So we're like, okay, Lord, we're beginning to see stuff happen.
 What does that mean for us and how are we prepared for that?
 Yeah.
 How do we partner with you?
 Right.
 brings up this tricky thing about Christians and money.
 Yes.
 I remember before I ever moved to America, reading an interview with Martin Smith from
 Delirious in a Christian magazine back in Scotland.
 He was talking about money and he made a very, very interesting observation, which I didn't
 know enough then to know if I agree with him, but now I do and I would agree with him.
 He said, because obviously he did ministry in both Britain and America, he said the general
 sense in Great Britain is that if you're a Christian, you have money, your character's
 pretty shady.
 You've done something wrong and it's a mark of probably a lack of holiness, certainly
 unscrupulousness.
 But in America, to have money, it's a mark of blessing.
 I was like, wow, that's so interesting.
 week, you know, so as well as putting out questions to our congregation, I went on social media
 and I wanted to hear from our people like, what comes up when you start thinking about this? And I
 actually wrote something down. I asked for permission to share. I'm going to keep it all anonymous,
 but I'm not sure I asked everybody that I'm sharing. So I'm extra keeping it anonymous.
 Okay. If you can do such a thing.
 Extra anonymous.
 Extra anonymous.
 Okay.
 But people said to me things like, so I asked about some of your pre-understanding. So your
 pre-understanding is something you don't know that you know or you probably don't know that you
 think and so when you read scripture you color what scripture saying through that lens of your
 pre-understanding. So for example if you have a pre-understanding that women should not be in
 ministry you pay really close attention to the verses that seem to support that lens and easily
 gloss over the verses that would seem to contradict those verses. And so I was asking like what are
 What are some of the pre-understandings you have about money?
 And so some people wrote to me, reached out to my social media.
 And one of the things they said, it's really hard for me to reconcile large amounts of savings
 and being a Christian once you've met your immediate needs.
 So it's kind of like I can see, I could probably forgot to meet my needs, but beyond that seems...
 I wrestled with that. What does that mean?
 They also said, "I have difficulty reconciling surrendering to God, but also having an emergency savings fund."
 I can recognize that they're probably friends, but I just struggle with, "Am I actually trusting God or am I just depending on myself?"
 And I was like, "I love hearing unearthing these latent struggles that are probably there, but we probably, certainly speaking from my history, we don't spend much time in that area because
 It feels like we're on shaky ground.
 How about this one?
 I struggle with the concept of blessing.
 Growing up in a religious family
 kind of distorted my view of what it means to be blessed.
 I was taught blessing in kind of a hyper-spiritual sense
 that was completely disconnected from money
 or health or relational wholeness.
 I guess the idea was that
 blessed meant you weren't going to hell
 and that should be enough for you.
 And to be sure, not going to hell is absolutely a blessing.
 Yes.
 All right.
 Or how about this?
 I do think this is somebody else.
 I do think I have some kind of deeply held belief that money is evil and dangerous.
 It's possibly why I tend to give away or spend it as fast as possible instead of saving.
 Wow.
 So I thought it would be interesting to explore our history with money and then maybe ask
 our listeners what's coming up for them as they listen.
 So you and I grew up in very different backgrounds.
 Yes.
 My difficulties, whatever you grew up with is normal.
 So probably your normal was--
 Yeah, I thought we lived in a normal neighborhood.
 You thought you lived in a normal neighborhood?
 I grew up in what I thought was a normal Scottish neighborhood.
 You know, mom, dad.
 Yeah.
 Three sisters?
 Yes, I--
 Yes, you still have three.
 Yeah.
 My dad worked.
 My mom did not work.
 I didn't think we were poor, but I knew we weren't rich.
 Yes.
 And instantly we're in trouble.
 'Cause how do you define poor and how do you define rich?
 Right.
 'Cause I knew people who are richer than me.
 Sure.
 And I knew people who are poorer than me.
 Yeah.
 But we were neither one of them.
 Yeah.
 But my family certainly didn't do abundance.
 For example, this true story, family story
 that we'd all laugh about is we're in Switzerland,
 which sounds glamorous, but my father speaking at a conference
 and getting to Switzerland on a budget is not glamorous at all.
 We're in a rented Fier uno driving through the south and we get to
 Chamonix and there's Mont Blanc and we take the cable car up and we get to the top.
 And of course, it's the tallest mountain in Europe.
 We're freezing the snow everywhere and my mum sees a cafe and so my mum goes up
 and she asks for five hot chocolates.
 Right, and then she realizes the price of them and she says one hot chocolate five straws.
 Two story two story.
 Now, in one sense, like what I was raised with, that's commendable.
 That's been a good steward.
 And also I understand was like, I've like, we've got a family of five.
 Yeah, it's expensive.
 So I get that too.
 Yeah.
 But my mom would also bring snacks on the road, which again, I understand.
 But she would bring fun size.
 And it wasn't that we'd each get like a fun-sized Mars bar.
 We'd get one fun-sized Mars bar split and share.
 Like, I do remember going places with your mom when they would give you like free
 biscuits on the table or whatever.
 And if she really liked the biscuits, she would wrap it up in an napkin so that
 she could save them late for later.
 My whole life when we would go to.
 And she would eat them later.
 When we'd be in hotels on the buffet, my mom would coach us to take stuff and
 I'm an African and put it in her handbag for later.
 Now, depending on your viewpoint, that's really like frugal and responsible.
 Or it's an absolute poverty mentality.
 But then also growing up, like I'm trying to think about what my mom grew up with.
 Like her dad was in the mines at age 14.
 Sure. Her mom was a nurse.
 Yeah.
 And I so like already you can feel me tensing, like trying to justify my mother's behavior.
 normalize my childhood, but also recognize that such strange behavior for how we live now.
 So it gives you an idea of what I grew up with. That was our outlook.
 What did you grow up with a completely different family environment? Describe your family from a
 relationship with money. A financial perspective.
 Yes.
 I mean, I don't ever remember thinking that we were wealthy.
 And yet, we were wealthy.
 I mean, we lived in a really wealthy neighborhood.
 How do you describe your neighborhood in your testimony?
 Oh, well, people would drive through our neighborhood on Sundays and look at the
 houses, which is so funny because we've been those people that have gone
 and driven through nice neighborhoods to look houses.
 Yeah.
 But that's what people would do.
 Yeah.
 They'd stop in the middle of our houses.
 And yeah.
 And it, you know, it probably didn't have the absolute biggest houses in, you know,
 in the Toronto area, but we were, you know, they were large.
  </li><li>How many square feet?
  </li><li>Oh, our house was 8,600 square feet.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, that's a big house.
  </li><li>That's a big house.
 But because most of the houses around us were, you know,
 large houses, and so going to your friend's house,
 their house was large, you know.
  </li><li>So it was a normal for you.
  </li><li>Yeah, I thought we lived in a normal neighborhood.
 I obviously don't remember ever worrying about money.
 But you had a governess and a maid growing up.
 Well, I mean, when we had a governess,
 the governess really did the mating as well,
 if that makes sense.
 Oh yeah, well, I mean,
 but then when we stopped having a governess week
 for a while had, yeah, made the human.
 Yeah, and you had a pool growing up?
 Yes.
 Yeah, but I don't remember,
 like I obviously was never afraid we weren't gonna.
 Yeah, and your father was a prominent architect in Toronto.
 He's well known.
 Like when we go to Toronto today,
 we can identify the buildings that he built.
 This guy's a great person.
  </li><li>But I remember my mom saying there were seasons
 where she had a teacher's salary,
 where their teacher's salary was actually
 what was buying us food and things like that
 because architects work on contract
 and so sometimes there's a few months in between.
 And my dad had 26 draftsmen that worked for him.
 So he had a pretty big, anyway, yeah.
 I mean, I don't ever remember even having to think about
 money, we certainly didn't share hot chocolate
 with straws or something like that.
 But then, you know, yeah, I don't remember,
 other than at Christmas, my parents would obviously spend
 a lot of money.
 I don't remember there being excessive amounts
 of things around either.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yes, but you also grew up in a not a Christian environment.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So I'm curious about you get saved.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like I don't ever remember ever,
 to try to get them if that's true.
 I don't think I ever remember any messages on money.
 I don't remember a message on money.
 I don't even remember them teaching me on tithing growing up.
 I remember by osmosis somehow learning about tithing.
 Maybe my parents told me about tithing,
 but I don't ever remember money being
 addressed as a matter worthy of teaching.
 I mean, I'm adding a value statement to that.
 I just don't recall ever being heard
 having teaching on Toronto, teaching on money until I got to Toronto.
 Yes, I didn't either.
 So, but I arrived.
 But I didn't get saved until I was 15.
 Okay.
 And I probably didn't hear anybody even talk about, "Yeah, money or tithing or anything like
 that until I started going to TACF."
 So years later.
 So now you're saved.
 Now you're working.
 What was the general vibe around money?
 I knew because my cousin told me, you know, being a good Baptist, "Hey, you give 10 percent."
 Right. So automatically you knew that.
 I knew that.
 But I also most of the time my job was serving.
 And I remember asking a couple of different people.
 So like 10% of my paycheck or 10% of my tips.
 And they're like, well, it's hard to track your tips just to your paycheck.
 So I just gave 10% of my paycheck for ages.
 And then it wasn't actually until, you know, I switched to TACF and somebody
 had said, actually, your tips are your biggest income.
 You should be giving 10% of that.
 And so I was like, "All right."
 You didn't mean like I was like, "Okay, start doing that then."
 Which was amazing, 'cause I realized
 I started getting better tips.
 Yeah, I don't ever remember it.
 Money wasn't a big thing one way or another.
 There was no evil attached to it.
 There was no awe attached to it.
 It was just something that you used to pay bills
 and you work hard to get so that you could pay your bills.
  </li><li>Do you remember where you learn
 about a healthy relationship with money spiritually?
 So like you're talking about like just growing up,
 it was like not a good nor bad,
 but I'm curious about when did you start being introduced
 to money and blessing and like a redemptive side of that?
  </li><li>I'll just go back a second.
 My dad was good with money.
 And he always said to me, don't ever have credit cards.
 Don't go into debt, pay everything cash.
 If you don't have the cash to buy it,
 then you can't buy it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But he'd also tell you that about a restaurant.
 If you don't have money for a tip,
 you don't have money for the meal.
  </li><li>Well, no, he would say,
 if you don't have money to spend 20% on a tip,
 then you shouldn't be eating in that restaurant.
 'Cause he said, if you have good service,
 20% says I had good service.
 And so he's like, you go in
 And if you know how much money you have and you decide, I'm going to order that.
 If you don't have enough to tip 20%, then don't order that.
 Okay.
 So you got some coaching.
 Yes.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And then do you, so like now fast forward, do you remember how it was you started learning
 about money?
 I think just through like different offering talks, a church, you know, different people
 saying different things about money.
 That was the most radical thing I noticed about Toronto.
 Yeah.
 there was a lot to pay attention to.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like one, every single service people got saved
 and healed.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like I don't remember a service I went to
 when somebody didn't respond to an old call
 and get saved and somebody didn't get healed.
 Like there would always be an offer call.
  </li><li>It was an offer call, yeah.
  </li><li>There would always be ministry time for healing.
 And also there would always be an offering talk.
 And by an offering talk, I mean like a 10 minute
 sermonette, a vignette on...
  </li><li>Well, I wouldn't say they were always 10 minutes.
 Sometimes they were more like five, but yeah.
 I mean, that's where I started.
  </li><li>Maybe going from nothing where it wasn't mentioned.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like in the church I grew up in,
 there was no act of offering.
 There was a plate that when you would walk in,
 you would put something there.
  </li><li>Oh. - That was it.
 There was no offering time.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm pretty sure when I was,
 'cause I was with those lovely Baptist for four years,
 they passed a thing along.
 and usually somebody would say something,
 but it usually was, I don't wanna sound judgmental,
 it was sort of like more felt very religiousy,
 which usually turned me off of listening.
 So I remember that it would go by
 and I would stick whatever I had in it.
 But I mean, to begin with, I was sort of like,
 why are they passing this way?
 And because they didn't really explain it,
 it was, you know, Janet had explained to me
 what was going on.
  </li><li>So for you, it was the cultural norm
 of being in TACF and hearing.
  </li><li>Just regular little teachings, little encouragement
 and testimonies, hearing people's testimonies of,
 I started tithing and this is what shifted for me.
  </li><li>One of the most stand out moments on that matter was,
 I remember shortly before we moved from Toronto to here,
 was Steve Long stood up at the start of one year
 and just said, I've got this approved by the board.
 We're gonna give you a money back guarantee
 that tithing works.
 So here's what I was going to do.
 We're going to ask you to commit to tithing,
 that the full thing, 10% of your gross salary.
 And if by July in those six months,
 you haven't seen a return on what you've invested,
 we'll give all of your money back.
 And I was like, I mean, Steve is known for being like,
  </li><li>Yes, like just out there on that.
  </li><li>Just the second person in the room,
 let's heal you and then everybody else should be easy.
  </li><li>Yeah, I love it.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, like turn this, okay, now we'll do deliverance,
 breaking the pairs and casting them out of each other.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I was just like, wow, like that is amazing.
 Do you remember some of your first financial miracles?
  </li><li>I mean, I remember the big one when we were pregnant
 with Abby.
 No, we just, we'd had Abby, hadn't we?
 And we had, because we were traveling full time
 and all of our income came in that way.
 And I already had debt before we even got married
 from traveling and ministering and all that kind of stuff.
 And so we couldn't work,
 like we couldn't travel for about five months.
 So we built up quite a lot.
  </li><li>Yeah, I can certainly want to do that.
 And people were calling, like credit card companies
 were calling it was super stressful.
  </li><li>It was horrible.
 And I think, first of all,
 I want to take full responsibility.
 Like we want to take full responsibility.
  </li><li>We made bad decisions.
  </li><li>For the level of debt we're in.
 But also looking back,
 I realized this is not a blaming statement at all.
 Let me give you the contrast.
 when we moved here into Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University, I remember thinking, "Where
 was this?"
 Yeah, I didn't know any of this.
 I didn't know any of this.
 So I think we were living the way we thought.
 And part of the problem is in a lot of Christian circles, when it comes to money, faith is
 spelled V-I-S-A.
 Yeah.
 So probably we were making a lot of decisions that we thought were faith that were actually
 just reckless.
 Yes.
 And putting on a music card.
 I think so.
 I think we were just like, "Okay, God, we trust you."
 And then we put it on a music card.
 Right.
 trust at all.
 And the problem with debt is it's really innocent.
 Like you can carry a lot of debt
 for a really minimum monthly payment.
 So you can be thousands of dollars in debt
 and your minimum payment is, I don't know,
 like a couple hundred bucks.
 I don't know, we haven't had credit card statements in a while.
 So what's crazy about that is you can live
 without any of the pain of the debt you've accrued
 until you can't make your minimum payments.
 And then you're like, holy mover of pearl.
 And we were in debt tens of thousands of dollars.
  </li><li>So much money.
  </li><li>And I'm feeling like an abject failure as a man,
 as a husband and as a father.
 And I remember one day I stopped and I calculated
 because all we could pay was our minimum.
 And there's sometimes when we couldn't even pay our minimum.
 And I remember calculating like how long would take us
 to pay off our debt if we just made minimum payments.
 And it was something like 22 years.
  </li><li>Oh my God.
  </li><li>And I remember just being so heartbroken
 and sad that I'd got us, we'd got ourselves
 into this situation.
 Yeah, and what are you gonna do in that situation?
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, we were so far in debt,
 there was like, there was no,
 it felt like there was no hope of us getting out of it.
 And then we just had some friends of ours emailed us and said--
  </li><li>Who that boy?
 We barely knew.
 Yes, that's true.
 They were more acquaintances.
 We were getting to know them.
  </li><li>The sequence was, "Mar du Pont"
 gave us a prophetic word.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Do you remember this?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>When he talked about Elijah or Elisha.
 Remember the woman who says,
 "That prophet comes and stays with us.
 We want to do something nice for him.
 We want to build a house for him."
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>When he comes and stays.
 Remember that?
 And so, Marq gave us a prophetic word that said,
 "You're about to be connected with people of means,
 and there's going to be an opportunity
 where they're going to ask you,
 what can we do for you?
 Their prayer, their posture is gonna be,
 what can we be do for them?
 And the Lord wants you to know that's him,
 but not to take advantage of them.
 So don't live with, he called it faith without hints is dead.
 Where you hint at things, if they ask you to be direct.
 'Cause it's the Lord.
 And so in that season of our life,
 we went from knowing no millionaires.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>To that we were aware of at least.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>To, I don't know, 10, 12 millionaires in one year.
  </li><li>Yeah, I thought it was eight, but anyway,
  </li><li>It was a lot of millionaires.
 And maybe I'm lumping in like 10, 12 over a series of years,
 but within one year, yeah, we met so many.
 And these people were acquaintances
 that we didn't really know.
 And they just asked, what can we do to help?
 And I remember that word.
 And I don't remember going,
 "Can you pay all of our debt, please?"
 But I remember just being vulnerable and saying,
 "Hey, you clearly know about money.
 "Here's the situation in.
 "This is the best I can come up with math-wise.
 Is there a smarter way of doing it?"
 I think we just kind of laid bare naked financially
 and just said, "This is a situation we're in."
 And they never answered us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And instead sent us a check that was,
 I think for $76,000?
  </li><li>Yeah, maybe a 72, somewhere in there.
 Anyway, it's over 70.
  </li><li>And I was just like, "Who in the right mind?"
 Like, here's me thinking,
 "I can't write a check that isn't gonna bounce."
 It's like that that's more than $200 $76.
 How?
 Like I was just even,
 yeah, but how is this even possible?
 So, you know, we were dumbfounded.
 We were just, we didn't even know what to do.
 I mean, arguably that would be one of the standout moments
 in terms of financial miracles.
 And that's when I called them to say,
 I was too scared to cash it.
 Like, are you on drugs?
 Is this for real?
 Is this for real?
 You know, and then I have this huge shame hangover of like,
 oh, did you feel manipulated into it?
 And so I call him and said, like,
 how on earth do you write a check for $76,000?
 And he said, well, it's really funny
 because we were in the same situation as you were.
 And I was like, what do you mean?
 He was like, we just got notified.
 We got an unexpected tax bill
 for I think it was like quarter of a million dollars
 that they had to pay.
 And it was on some, I don't know,
 some unrealized tax gain or something like that.
 Anyway, the IRS had written to them and said,
 "Hey, you lost $250,000."
 and they were like, you know, we didn't have $250,000 liquid at the moment.
 We could of course get it.
 We could liquidate some assets or sell some shares.
 But also we didn't think that was right, but we were like, they want that money.
 They want us to pay it.
 That is going to be a major inconvenience.
 Slightly different.
 Like they could pay it.
 We could.
 But they were in distress and so they went to the Lord and they just prayed and said, Lord, this seems, you know, unjust.
 I don't know what to do about it.
 Like, would you please help us?
 Would you please resolve this?
 And so, I don't know, their CFO or their accountant
 reviewed everything, petitioned IRS, they reviewed the case
 and what happened was they didn't owe $250,000,
 they were given a rebate of something like $76,000.
 And they just were like, Lord, you did it!
 Like, thank you so much!
  </li><li>You reversed it up!
  </li><li>You're so good, what should we do?
 And they said, in the day that we were praying,
 we got your letter and I think then the amounts match.
 Something like that, I don't wanna make it too romantic,
 but it was something like that and they were like,
 we know exactly what to do. Yeah. And they were like, they just sent it to us. Yeah.
 What do you remember what that did to you when you got that? I remember I was in the bath and
 I remember I just started bawling because we were literally literally like avoiding phone calls
 all the time. And I also remember that having like this moment, and this is like awful, but this
 moment of like this pays off all our debt but if we tithe on it then it doesn't pay off our debt
 and that means we still have a remainder of debt and if I remember correctly this was all happening
 around August and so you know the temptation is like no but they gave us this and it's the perfect
 for the dead and then we could be debt free.
 God wants us to be debt free and whatever,
 but we were like, okay, so anyway, we tithed on it,
 but then the Lord also challenged us to give
 on top of that, which you're way better at that than I was.
  </li><li>I don't know if I'm way better than we--
  </li><li>I was like inside, I was like, no!
  </li><li>Well, let me pause so every catches out.
 So you're saying, we've been praying for a miracle.
 To be honest, I had no faith for a miracle.
 Like I remember Isabelle Allen profs saying over,
 "You're right, it would have been about August
 because I-- - Yeah.
  </li><li>She said by the end of the year,
 you'll be out of, you'll be debt free.
  </li><li>And I remember thinking, "I love you,
 but you just totally missed it.
 There's no way."
  </li><li>Well, and we also nobody knew how much debt we were in.
  </li><li>No, yeah. - Part shame.
  </li><li>Right, right, so we were just--
  </li><li>So we get this, we're like, "Day!"
 And then at the back of my head, like you're saying,
 you're like, "Do we tithe on this?"
 No, we don't tithe on this 'cause God gave us in.
 And we shouldn't have to tithe.
 Consider the lunacy of that.
 God just provided 76,000 and we don't want to give away 7,600 because then that will be less.
 Right.
 So there's that.
 Then we make peace with it.
 But we make peace with that.
 And then the Lord's like, actually, love you to give.
 I'd love you to give to others who are in the same situation.
 Others that need blessing.
 And that was another 10% we were like, Oh, so.
 Oh, I remember that being horrible.
 Hey.
 And anyway, so we, we did that.
 And I remember it's December.
 It's, you know, the years almost done.
 We're still carrying, I forget, like 16 grand worth of debt on credit cards.
 And of course that's better than 76, but it was like a lot.
 And wake up one morning and we have an email from another friend, different
 people that say I had a dream about you last night.
 And the Lord said to send you a check for $20,000.
 So how do we how do we send you $27,000?
 And we were like, what?
 And we realized if we tie and give on $20,000, there's $16,000 left, which wiped out our debt.
 So by the end of the year, we were debt free and we'd been able to give.
 Yeah, tie then give.
 So I'm just thinking that you're talking.
 Yeah, I remember all that and just the deep sorrow of where we were,
 to the utter satisfaction, gratitude, mind blown of what God has done.
 Mind blown.
 And I remember that, like, when you go through something like that,
 like, we haven't even talked about tithing, but you can probably guess we're pro-tizers.
 Yes.
 But the debate of whether you do tither, you don't tithe,
 can be settled intellectually, but it is reinforced in experience.
 Yes.
 Like you have you have a test me like that. You can't talk me out of tithing and giving.
 Yeah. And yeah, yeah, the irony like when you say, oh, you're really good at that is that thing
 of mammon, I believe we'll be tested for the rest of our lives where God does something and we're
 like, oh, I have to tie. And you know, we'll probably talk about tithing in subsequent weeks, in future
 weeks about that. But yeah, that was that was bananas and bonkers.
 Yeah, I was thinking I thought of another strike as you thought have you thought you know
 Mm-hmm. It always takes me a minute to come up with stories, but I remember in my first year of
 Being in full-time ministry this before we ever met before we ever met and
 I was living in this little cottage in the woods that had you had to buy propane heat
 Or you had no heat like there is like propane cans like for barbecue
 I had a big propane tank and they were coming full up that sat outside the front door.
 That's in healthy.
 Yeah, really safe. And so then there was this heater that would go click the click, you know, and, and heat the, uh, heat the cottage.
 I should say heat the cottage and quotation marks. The heat amount of heat was questionable, but that's how you didn't freeze to death in said cottage.
 Anyway, it was winter and I had come back from a ministry trip where they just
 really hadn't, this church hadn't been able to essentially give me anything for having
 been there or was less than what you needed.
 Yeah, it didn't cover the flights or anything.
 And so I came home realizing I have no propane heat and I live in Canada in the winter,
 have no food.
 You were exaggerating, you had half a lemon.
 I had a half a lemon and I had a sachet of ketchup in the fridge.
 Then you're fine.
 And anyway, so I came home and I thought, well, this, the lemon in the, and the ketchup were
 actually about a month before this story.
 Oh, I digress.
 So that was, that was, but another huge blessing.
 Like that was, I came home to say that I was going to, I knew I was leaving in four days
 to speak in another church.
 So I'd get food then.
 And so I decided I was going to fast for four days because that way I wouldn't be sad about
 but not having food.
 And when I got to this new church,
 I would get fed again.
 I didn't tell any of my friends or anything.
 Like I was like, no, you know,
 God provides and I'm not telling anybody the truth
 about what's in my fridge.
 So the first day that I was home,
 my friend Jenny had said,
 "Hey, do you wanna go to the movies?
 "We're going to whatever."
 I had no money at all.
 Then the next day, she's like,
 do you need to borrow my car to go to the laundry mat?
 'Cause I usually, when I would home,
 be home, I'd borrow her car for a day
 and go and do my laundry, but I had no money to do laundry.
 And so I was like, oh yeah, no,
 I mean, my clothes are pretty clean, you know, like just kind of,
 and she was like, huh, and then she asked me
 if I wanted to do something that evening,
 and I was like, no, I think I'm just gonna stay home,
 and she had a key to my house.
 And she, anyway, so she just came over,
 unlocked the door, came in, opened the fridge,
 and looked at it, and then she looked at me,
 and she shut the door to the fridge,
 and just stormed out of my cottage, and she was mad.
 I mean, so mad.
 And I was sort of not really knowing
 what she was that mad about.
 Anyway, she reappears but an hour later
 with all these groceries.
 And she was crying.
 I mean, she was mad and crying and passionate
 about the whole thing.
 And she was like,
 "Hey, part of being in community
 "and part of being family
 "as we get to help one another.
 "And what is happening right now?"
 And so I burst into tears and I was like,
 "Well, you know."
 I was like, "I paid rent, but I don't have money for food.
 So I just decided it's going to fast and it's okay.
 I fasted for longer than four days before and blah, blah, blah.
 And she was just basically like,
 that's not how being Christians, living in community works.
 Like if you have a need, then you, you know,
 so I learned some there about like,
 I was probably pride and fear and shame and.
  </li><li>Oh, so much.
  </li><li>Oh, those kind of things.
 But anyway, I.
  </li><li>That's the propane story.
  </li><li>Brought to the propane story.
 I knew I was, you know, gonna run out of propane.
 Anyway, go to another church and,
 And, you know, some churches would blow your minds.
 They'd bless you really well and other churches didn't.
 And so it was sort of one of those situations.
 And I ended up having to cover the flight
 or part of the flight myself and ended up with nothing.
 And I had no propane.
 And I was literally like, my propane is gonna run out.
 Like I haven't filled it.
 So it's gonna be gone in a couple of days
 and I'm in the winter.
 Again, I'm not gonna ask anybody for help, of course.
 And I'm just like, I don't know, I'm tired.
 That's all I know.
 Anyway, I signed into my bank,
 and of course there's no money in my bank.
 And the next morning, I felt like the lawyers
 had just signed into your bank again,
 again, all online, so signed in.
 And it says there's $2,000 in my bank account.
 I mean, that for me was a huge amount of money.
 And a propane tank was $800.
 I was like, oh my gosh, where did this $2,000 come from?
 And then I'm like, no churches are owing me money.
 Like I'm up to date.
 I have no idea.
 My family doesn't have money.
 Like I have no idea where this money came from.
 I call my bank person, like the, my manager person,
 the bank and I was like, hey, I think there's a mistake.
 I noticed there's $2,000 in my bank account.
 And I think it's been put there by mistake
 and I'm worried that I'm gonna spend it and then owe money.
 And she was like, "Oh, no, it looks like it wasn't directly
 to your name and, you know, blah, blah."
 And I was like, "No, nobody owes me money.
 Can you do some research?"
 So she's like, "Sure, I can find out where it came from."
 So she calls me back a couple of hours later
 and she's like, "You know, it's really strange."
 She's like, "I don't even have an address for the account.
 It just says, and I can't remember the exact wording,
 but it was something like the family of God
 or the church of God or something."
 And it was $2,000 and she said, "It's direct deposit.
 If you spend it, you know, it's yours.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I remember just being like,
 (humming)
 I can buy heat, I can pay rent, and I can buy food,
 and I'm okay now for like, a month, you know.
  </li><li>My question for our listeners today is,
 what comes up as you hear us talk about,
 sir, childhood, and our money?
 What comes up for you?
 What are you feeling when we talk about
 the testimonies that we experienced?
 Where do you find your story in the midst of us telling our story?
 Where are you right now?
 Like, what is your relationship with, with money, with blessing?
 What do you instinctively think of?
 What are you instantly suspicious of when you think about the church?
 You think about the Bible and you think about money.
 Play around with those ideas because for the next couple of weeks,
 we're going to be exploring some of these things.
 And if you would like to hear the message that I preached last Sunday,
 You can go to youtube.com/gracenertv
 or I'll put a link in the show notes too.
  </li><li>That would be easier.
  </li><li>You can follow along.
 It's gonna be a four week series at Grace Center.
  </li><li>And send us your comments and your questions.
 Go to alanah.com/ask
 and then we can sort of explore it all together.
  </li><li>Yeah, if you've got questions about that.
 Also, I'm about to launch a course all about this topic
 in way more depth.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And if you would like to explore your journey
 with finances,
 If you would like to explore what scripture says
 about thine answers and blessings,
 if you would like to have a different relationship
 with money, then go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/more
 and you can pop in your email address
 and I will email you as soon as the course is ready to sign up.
 It's, there's gonna be nine different lessons
 covering all facets of money, of blessing, of tithing,
 of stewardship, of partnering with a supernatural
 resources of heaven.
 And I'd love you to join with me.
 You'll meet with me each week
 where you can live, where you can talk about questions,
 ask clarifying questions, share your story.
 But I'm really excited about that.
 I can't wait.
 Alan and Adjie.com/more.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Let me ask you some questions.
 And this week, unlike last week,
 I'm gonna ask the question and let you answer it.
  </li><li>Okay, but I just want you to know
 that both my nose and my lips are frozen at this point.
  </li><li>Well, we'll see how it goes.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>This question is from Grace.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I've got two questions, so this is question number one.
  </li><li>Okay.
 says, "A friend of mine gave me a copy of Finding Father." That's a good friend right
 there. And I've been learning about and trying to practice soaking in God's presence. I have
 an app called Dewell that is an audio Bible with background music. Can I listen to the
 Bible while soaking? Or is it better to have music only? Thank you for your podcast. It's
 been helpful as has the book.
 Sure, you can grace you can I mean if people listen to techno while soaking techno tech. That's what it's called, right?
 I'm looking at you the hip is 50 year old. I know I
 Know people that spoke to all kinds of different things and I for sure you could soak to the word of God
 I didn't know there was one that had
 Music behind it. That's that's brilliant. Yeah, you can I would say like I
 what I choose to soak to
 changes usually based on my mood. If I'm very like kind of distracted and like how am I even
 going to like calm myself down? Then tech now is not what you usually talk about.
 No, I'm you're more of a dubstep person. Yes, that right. The dub, I will usually listen to
 something like the Rivera's or Laura Woodley where they are, they are praying things and they
 are singing things and that helps me focus on what they are praying and singing and it helps me
 any sort of settle. If I'm already kind of in the zone, I'm usually going to actually
 soak to stuff that doesn't have any words at all. But that makes me want to try to soak
 into the develop is good. I had it for you. This question. Thank you. Grace for your question.
 This question is from Alyssa. Will there be a guided finding father class anytime or a
 book study group on it that we can pay to join? We've been talking about that. Haven't we?
 we're talking about doing another one course, as you guys know, we're in this full process
 of adoption. And so like, but part of me just struggles with scheduling anything, not knowing
 when life will change.
 And you might be thinking about Alan's running the course. Alan's comfortableness with, first
 of all, speaking about himself in the third person is astonishing, but also with Jerry
 rigging a video thing so I can be live with my people no matter where I am in the world.
 It's substantially easier for me to do and that doesn't intimidate me.
 That's not stressful.
 It's kind of adventurous for me.
 Where's for age?
 It would be like, okay, no.
 Yeah, if we end up having to be, which at some point we will in a different state, having
 a Zoom call from a hotel room and Alan weren't there, I think I would just feel super stressed,
 super, you know, whatever, we're for Alan.
 He would just.
  </li><li>For something you want to do, why do?
  </li><li>But you can't commit to doing well until we have a baby.
  </li><li>Or at least timing on something.
 And I was thinking, how's this for putting you in the spot?
 I was thinking-- - Your hands are freezing.
 (gasps)
 Holy mother of pearl, do you have a soul?
 (laughs)
 I'm so glad!
 I don't know where your warm blooded.
  </li><li>You should build my feet.
 I'm gonna work with you later.
  </li><li>A reptile.
 Let me see, do you have a four ton?
 Okay. All right. You freak of nature. I was thinking like, you know, the last time we ran
 finding father, which, you know, this wasn't ideal that this happened, but I ended up getting
 mono in the middle of it. Oh, yeah. And then I took over. You took over for four weeks.
 We made it work. So I mean, partially in the back of my head, I'm like, I wonder if we just
 pick dates and we'll, if there's a couple of weeks where it's you on the line, because I'm
 in some other state than great. I just don't know. I don't know. I want to though.
 And for people who are new to the podcast, you don't know what Finding Father is.
 AJ wrote a book called Finding Father. Yes.
 And you can do the book, but Alyssa's also talking about an online group.
 And here's the thing, you could right now go and do an online study. AJ teaches,
 pre-recorded, AJ teaching every chapter of the book. So you could buy the book,
 you could buy the video course and work through it yourself. But what Alyssa's asking about is,
 we have in the past done like a group where everybody goes through at the same time and age
 it will get on in addition to the pre-recorded videos because you each Saturday.
 And the last one was so fun. We had like 70 people and it was just so fun. So that
 do I want to desperately want to? Probably more Alan and I figuring out when we could make it work
 and as you know if we're comfortable with the switch-in switch out nature of what our lives
 might be like to pull that off soon.
 But you've already told people where they can ask questions.
 Yes.
 Alanaj.com/ask.

 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Paleotronuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin, Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
