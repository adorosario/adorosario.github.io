<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones.
 AJ Jones were back.<br/>
 We are back, baby.<br/>
 You would even believe we've been away.
 Yes, I would believe we've been away.<br/>
 Me too.<br/>
 I really miss not recording a podcast.
 Oh, that's not so much what I meant is more the jet lag.
 Oh, I didn't get any jet lag.<br/>
 That's not true.<br/>
 Day two on the way back.<br/>
 Day two being back.<br/>
 You were like, oh,<br/>
 I feel tired.<br/>
 Well, I was like a Tuesday afternoon.<br/>
 I'm tired on a Tuesday afternoon anyway.
 Well, that's true.<br/>
 Generally speaking, no jet lag on the way back, a little bit on the way there.
 Yeah.<br/>
 But we weren't here last week.<br/>
 We were in Iceland.<br/>
 We usually record our podcast Sunday night.
 We didn't take any microphones with us, which is why there wasn't a podcast.
 But for me, I felt out of our weekly rhythm, not recording a podcast.
 And I got some communication from a bunch of listeners who were also like, it was weird
 not having you to listen to on a Monday.
 So we are so sorry.<br/>
 fear not we are back from now on we'll just record on the planes though love it yeah everybody
 would love that we'll talk about Iceland in a second but we left Wednesday got their
 Thursday morning and then came back Monday yes thus fulfilling a prophetic word that
 David Wagner gave us enough four years ago where he said you will ask yourselves can
 I go to Europe for the weekend and the Lord says yes oh wow and he talked about us going
 to Iceland. Do you remember that? I do now. I hadn't thought about it. Uh huh. Go David Wagner.
 Go David. So we got back Monday. And while we were gone, Ray Hughes was here. Oh my gosh.
 Yes. I knew of Ray Hughes. And this is what I knew of Ray Hughes is everybody who listened
 to Ray Hughes said, Oh my gosh, I love Ray Hughes. Yes. But for some reason, I'd completely missed
 him. Me too. I'd never heard him before. If you don't know who Ray Hughes is, he talks like a red
 neck, but sounds like Bill Johnson.<br/>
 Yeah, like the wisdom of Bill Johnson.
 But he's an amazing storyteller.<br/>
 Oh, he's an unbelievable storyteller.<br/>
 But he believes that's his calling to be a storyteller, isn't it, to guard the memories
 and stuff.<br/>
 Yeah, he's got, I mean that in the kindest of ways when I talked about him sounding like
 a redneck, he's got the best southern accent ever.
 He really does.<br/>
 And he's, it's like listening to your papa, isn't it?
 Totally.<br/>
 It's like you're such a wise dad in the faith.
 tell me anything I'll listen to it.<br/>
 You know, I had this strange experience because on Wednesday he came to the pastors meeting
 and he was sharing and he was talking about the rhyming auditorium.
 I have no emotional connection to the rhyming auditorium whatsoever.
 I've only been there a couple of times to listen to a comedian and I didn't really see what the
 big fuss was about. Super uncomfortable seats and looked like a terrible venue.
 And so, you know, I've got no vested connection to it whatsoever. But as he was telling the story,
 I was brought to tears.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And that I think that's the power of his storytelling.
 Yeah, because that was a story that you've actually heard before.
 What really?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I don't recall it.<br/>
 When we went and toured the rymen.<br/>
 I never turned around.<br/>
 Do you really think I would tour the rhyme?
 You did.<br/>
 There's no way.<br/>
 The whole staff went and toured the rymen.
 I don't think I went that day.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 I remember you grumbling.<br/>
 Well, it is effectively removed from my mind palace.
 I have no regulation of that.<br/>
 But we need to work on the massive holes in the walls of your mind.
 He's probably so.<br/>
 But yeah, having Ray here was amazing.
 He's like the human Wikipedia.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 He reminds me a lot of my mom and your mom.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Just storing information.<br/>
 His mind palace has got no holes in it.
 No.<br/>
 He knows seemingly everything about everything.
 Yeah, it's amazing.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So Ray Hughes, if you didn't get to hear any of Ray, I'll put links in the show notes
 to all the sessions that he did at Grey Center and buckle up Buttercup.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, you have to listen more than once, it's one of those.
  </li><li>And then as soon as we got back, it was Tia's birthday.
  </li><li>It was, so we had a bunch of...
  </li><li>You're very excited about that.
  </li><li>We had a bunch of very loud children at our house
 who mostly stayed outside praise the Lord.
 And we did like water things.
 She just wanted to have a sprinkler and a kiddie pool
 and things like that and pizza and cupcakes.
 I was like done, that sounds like the easiest party ever.
  </li><li>She's got simple tastes like girl.
 Yeah. So we did that. It was very good.
 And that means that all day yesterday and today,
 after we're done doing the podcast, I will be doing what?
 Putting together Lego.
 Oh, that's right.
 Her birthday wishes were for Lego.
 Yes.
 And then on top of everything else, we're getting ready to move the house.
 We really are.
 Well, we're not getting ready to move the house.
 No, we're going to leave the house where it is.
 We're going to move to a different one.
 Yeah, which is an operation that needs to be planned with military precision.
 It's true.
 All right. Let's talk about Iceland.
 Yes.
 We've talked about Iceland here and there, but this was our sixth visit and our first
 time there in how many years?
 I think we said six.
 It's funny that we used to travel the world and then we haven't traveled in for such a
 long time.
 Yeah.
 How much easier is it without children?
 It's so much easier.
 It's unbelievable.
 We don't even have to talk to each other.
 We can just sit there and look at our devices and just enjoy the silence.
 Tell you what I was super impressed by and I never thought I'd say these words.
 I was super impressed by Delta.
 Yeah, I was too.
 They were great.
 They were astonishing.
 Yeah.
 We had, and I think I probably liked them because we had internet there and internet on the
 way back.
 Yes, it makes for happy Alan.
 But super comfortable seats.
 It's true.
 Great service.
 I've already we spoke to with phenomenal.
 Yeah.
 And I got to troll Pinterest all the way back.
 So you did, you were in Pinterest, heaven.
 What was the most staggering thing for you by Iceland?
 I forgot that the sun basically never goes down.
 It's not technically true.
 Not technically true.
 It goes down around midnight and it comes up around 3.30.
 Yeah.
 So those three hours didn't make much difference, didn't they?
 Well, it never really felt dark, dark.
 No, we'd get home about 11.30 at night and it would feel like about 5 p.m.
 Here.
 Yeah.
 So I'm like, why is my body so tired?
 Then you'd look at your watching out.
 Oh, it's because it's 11.30 at night.
 You know what I missed?
 What?
 Well, I've forgotten that in Europe, I've just made a blanket statement about many, many, many different countries.
 I forgot how nice it is to sleep under a down duvet.
 We don't sleep under down because you have an allergy.
 Yes.
 And oh my gosh, it was so super comfortable and warm and light.
 Was it?
 That's so nice.
 And my pillow.
 We can move to having separate comforters again.
 Remember when we first married, we had that queen size bed and we each had
 single comforters so that we didn't have to have the comforter war because you
 would still cover us all night long.
 There was no warm my side.
 You're just highly intolerant about my duvet habits.
 Because you'd roll yourself up in it like a burrito and leave me freezing cold in Canada with no cover.
 That was part of my plan that you would rag yourself around me and I would warm you.
 But instead you just hit me in the face.
 So for my own safety.
 We went to IKEA and bought two single duvets.
 Single duvets.
 And we got that idea from Europe too when we stayed in Germany.
 It's true.
 It's true.
 I quite liked it actually.
 Yeah.
 Anyway, why are we talking about duvets?
 I had horse meat for my first time ever.
 You did and it was my first time ever to and it tasted great.
 Yeah, if nobody told me it was horse, I would have thought it was filet mignon.
 Yeah, I just felt disturbed afterwards.
 Like I was like, "Of course I'm going to try it."
 You ordered it.
 But then afterwards I was like, "Mm, does this eat somebody's friend?"
 Well, afterwards the side effect was you were like, "Mm, mm, mm."
 She cows, not cute. Horses, beautiful.
 No one eats.
 Like horses are beautiful.
 Oh, they're stunning.
 So you're getting ready in the morning and you're like only the horse today.
 I want to look stunning.
 Not an animal.
 But it's one of the most beautiful animals.
 You have a beautiful man.
 But I don't have a problem like eating penguin, for example.
 They're not that cute.
 How was the coffee?
 The coffee was superb.
 All the time.
 All the time no matter where we went, superb coffee.
 So let's talk about what Iceland means to us.
 Well, I mean, at one point, we considered moving there.
 We were, you know, they chatted with us and asked us if we'd moved there.
 And but we'd already moved to Nashville by that point.
 So we were like, um, no, we just moved.
 Um, but, uh, I love Iceland.
 I love the people.
 And I love, I think because we went so many times in a five year period
 that I feel invested there.
 I feel like, you know, we really know people fairly well and, um,
 I feel like I have a part of my heart there.
 I think for me that Iceland in one sense was the pinnacle of our travels.
 And that I can't think of a nation that we visited that was so open to the supernatural.
 Right.
 Like in the countries that we would go to and the miracles that we'd seen, you know,
 we would have seen healings and we would have seen salvation and we would have seen the
 supernatural and we would have encountered prophetic revelation and have dreams and
 all that sort of stuff. But it felt like, especially the first time we went to Iceland,
 all of that got turned up to 15 on a scale of one to 10.
 Right. Like, I remember the first time we landed in Iceland, as soon as we got off the
 plane and we were being picked up, I just looked up at the stars and the heavens were
 open and I could just see all the angels and all the heavenly lights and I, you know,
 then I didn't really clue into that. And then the first night that we went to a meeting,
 we weren't really sure if they were used to us or what was in norm, but it became very,
 very apparent that God was doing something unusual that was far beyond what we were used to.
 Yeah.
 And the level at which the Holy Spirit was moving and the miracles that he was doing,
 we got in touch with it, but we didn't really realize what had happened until the second time
 we came back and heard all the testimonies. Right. Well, we knew about the deaf people.
 We did, but there was just so many different words and stuff that they disintegrated in those
 meetings. So many testimonies and still even going back this time hearing people tell stories
 and like for us, it felt like we were a front row seats of what God was doing. And to be sure,
 it had nothing to do with us. It was just that we were there at the right time. Yeah.
 the Holy Spirit was doing something and we got to be in the room when he was doing that and it was
 amazing. Astonishing really. I remember one of the times we finished the meeting, we were driving
 home. I don't even know what time it was. And all of us had to pull off to the side of the road
 because we all saw with our open eyes a village on fire and we were so arrested by the site
 that we had to pull off to the side of the road so that Johannes could call people in that village
 to check they were okay.
 Yeah, it was the Westman Islands, wasn't it?
 It was either his aunt or his cousins or something because it literally looked like the whole thing
 was on fire.
 Yeah, the sky was all orange. You could see the haze of the heat of the fire.
 It was unmistakably the whole village was on fire. And we later learned that that was the gateway,
 that village there, or sorry, that island was the gateway for the Holy Spirit come to mainland
 in Europe. So for us, it was just this special place. And you know, we're in Nashville in
 one sense, because I had the most profound dream I've ever had in my life in Iceland.
 And we've got so many relationships with people there who changed our lives as well. And it
 was fun this trip getting to meet up with them again and catch up with them and hear
 their stories.
 Yeah, it was great to see them.
 So we love it. So this year we went over, we sent a team over in March from the school
 and the school students fell in love with them and they fell in love with the school
 students. And while we're there, our good friend Baldur has been asking us to come for
 a few years now, but with our schedule here and with kids, it just wasn't feasible or
 possible. But we eventually did. We went last week.
 And I don't suppose we ever thought about going for a weekend.
 I mean, that didn't really enter my, the possibility of something I would have thought of.
 But then David Wagner gave us a prophetic word.
 Yeah.
 Did we know that though before we scheduled for a weekend?
 Well, I think the two happened simultaneously.
 Like David told us years ago, we forgot about it.
 We scheduled the weekend and then we're like, I was listening back to my prophetic words.
 I was like, Hey, look at that.
 David's a prophet who knew who knew.
 So we got to hang out with Baldur and Barbara, his wife.
 And Baldur said, would you come over and do a conference?
 And we really didn't want to do a conference.
 We thought if a conference is what's needed to impact that nation, I mean,
 how much better does a conference have to be than the ones that we were at before?
 Right.
 So really we wanted to just be with Baldur and Barbara and hang out with them.
 And I think the thing for me that we've benefited from most is when leaders
 from other places come to Gray Center. I love their teaching and I love their meetings.
 But what's been most valuable is getting to pick their brains.
 Yeah, ask questions.
 Terrible expression. But yeah, ask some questions, clean from their experience.
 So we went over there and ate lamb and cow and horse and met with their leaders and just talked
 and we did a couple of meetings here and there for the most part of just trying to impart any
 wisdom God's given us about leadership over the years.
 Yeah, it's funny. I don't, I suppose I sort of live in the moment, you know what I mean?
 And so when we went, I mean, I was super looking forward to going, but I just loved being there.
 And I mean, Iceland appeals to me anyway. It's absolutely beautiful. The food is amazing and
 the coffee is great. What more could you want? But then add to that all the people that we love
 And just getting to watch God change people again.
 Um, I love it.
 I just love it.
 You, you also got to fulfill one of your photography dreams, which is go off
 and shoot photographs of the landscape.
 Yeah, Barbara and I went off for, I don't know, four hours or something.
 And I just got to shoot a bunch of stuff, the lovely Trent, uh, let me his
 camera body.
 And so I could go and shoot some stuff.
 So it was great.
 And while you were out shooting the landscape, Baldur and I sat down and although we didn't
 bring any microphones, he had access to a studio.
 So we went in and I did an interview with Baldur.
 And Baldur has got to be one of the most fascinating people we know.
 Yeah, for sure.
 With one of the most amazing testimonies of a life changed by Jesus.
 Yeah.
 So I want to introduce you to Baldur.
 Here is an interview that we recorded while we were in Iceland, where we just talk
 about Baldur's encounter with Jesus and how it changed his life. Enjoy.
 Baldur, say hello to everybody in Icelandic. Hello, come on.
 Come on. There, I'm good. I thought you were just going to say hi-hi,
 but that sounds way cooler. I wanted to sit down and interview you because
 we first met you in 2007. Yeah.
 A.J. and I came over to Iceland, not sure what we were going to do. And as soon as we got here,
 everybody said, "Oh, you need to meet Baldur." And we're like, "Who's Baldur?" And this guy,
 this hugely muscular guy who's covered in tattoos, bounded up to us. And you were super,
 you know, bright eyes, super keen. But, crown me if I'm wrong, you just recently got saved
 that year. And you have a pretty crazy background.
 Yes.
 And anyway, I think probably it's easy just to say, start at the beginning. Talk to us
 about how you got saved, what your life was like before you got saved.
 Okay, I mean, I'm raised in a violent home and really what, and I started to use violence
 at a really young age.
 Violence.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's what I was taught.
 So I mean, I start drink, I think I drank for the first time when I was 10 years old.
 So me and my friend, we stole some liquor from my mom, one beer and a little bit of
 vodka.
 And then we went to this birthday party at 10 years old and we were thrown out for being
 drunk.
 It's his circle, isn't it?
 But like for me, I was really hooked on just getting away from myself because every time
 my drink or we would sniff glue or we would just do whatever just to get out of, take
 this like I had this heavy stone in my stomach and I was raised to that and it was just
 fear and anxiety. So like using something that would go away for a small time. So I
 think I was not in the beginning, it was not the drugs that I was addicted to. I just got
 addicted to running away from myself. So, I mean, when I'm 22 years old, I am sentenced
 to jail for six brutal assaults, one leading to death. I mean, I've been selling drugs
 and running the streets or a kiwi. I mean, I think I must have been one of the most feared
 guys here in Iceland.
 Because at one point you were you were managing all the import of all the drugs to Iceland.
 I was managing like the best cocaine that came here. Yes.
 Okay. So you're special.
 Oh, no, no. You want to specialize? Yeah.
 Neishmark. Yeah. Okay. So we were doing that and that's after I come out of the prison.
 But I'm just selling a lot of drugs and beating people up for hire.
 I mean, I've had so many fights, I don't even remember the count of it.
 It's almost daily.
 I was into some kind of a shakedown.
 And I was really, like when I was 19 years old, I decided to take over Reykjavik.
 I wanted to be a kingpin there.
 And Reykjavik is a capital city of Iceland, so those of you who don't know your geography.
 So your early 20s, you decide I'm going to make something on myself, I'm going to be
 the kingpin of Reykjavik.
 So I'm at this rehab station and they tell me that I need to go for a year in rehab.
 And I'm looking at it.
 I'm not even 20.
 Why do I need to go to this one year rehab?
 So I just screw you guys.
 Can I say that?
 I'm sure you can.
 I think you just did.
 I just run out of the rehab station and go up.
 We're not living now actually, I'm looking over at the tanks and I'm looking over again.
 I'm just deciding that I'm going to take over.
 So I started to make a name of myself in the underworld and I did that with a lot of
 violence and stuff like that and did up in prison.
 If I would beat someone up, the police would tell people not to press charges because they
 knew I would just beat them up again if it was not serious and they knew that I wouldn't
 get sentenced for it only a fine. So they would actually advise people not to press charges
 against me. So, but when I got when that young man was in a coma and they picked up a lot
 of people that had I had beaten up and was getting them to press charges. So they got
 six charges against me.
 So you got a person.
 Yeah.
 And when did you meet Jesus?
 So you got a person then after you come out of prison.
 That's when you really get into doing cocaine.
 Yeah.
 Then like then, and then I start the import and I really believe that I'm like,
 I'm in the top of my game now, because unlike the dream, I have, uh, I have
 everything running a brothel, making money out of that, running the cocaine
 business making money out of that. So money was flowing. I could have everything I wanted. I had
 power. I had everything. And I, I felt so empty anyway, do you know what I mean? Right? It's kind of
 my dream had come true. And it wasn't my dream. Because I didn't, I was asking myself, shouldn't I
 feel better now? You know, I should not be happier and stuff like that. So in 2007, in January,
 something happened and I know now what it was but I was I got so scared I was just scared of everything and
 and
 Every time I was alone. I would just get scared. I didn't know what it was. I didn't know why I was scared and
 So I would wake my girlfriend up in the middle of the night and ask her to pray for me because I
 Couldn't be alone like every time I was alone
 This just presence came on me and I I was so afraid and I was not used to that because I wasn't afraid
 or anything. But why would you ask your girlfriend to pray for you? Was she a Christian?
 No, because like when I was 17, I got introduced a little bit to the gospel.
 Okay. So I went into this church for a season in my life. And then after a year and there
 was something they came to me and said, if I wouldn't wear a suit and a tie, I got within
 blessed me anymore. So how about that? Yeah, exactly. So but your girlfriend knew to pray
 or does she think you're not?
  </li><li>But I mean, all of Iceland just know the Lord's prayer.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Do you know what I mean?
 It's the Christian nation.
 So she's praying for me and nothing is happening.
 And I tried everything.
 You know, I had all kinds of meditation, CDs,
 and I was trying to meditate the fear away
 and stop using drugs.
 I even stopped using drugs and the fear didn't go away
 because I thought it was the drugs messing with me.
 But nothing really worked out
 until I gave my life to Jesus.
 After I gave my life to Jesus, I had this peace,
 but it was not like it would come on me every now
 and then the fear and anxiety, but anxiety.
 But it wouldn't be the role lead in my life.
  </li><li>But how did you end up giving your life to Jesus?
 You just casually said, after I gave my life to Jesus.
 How does the drug kingpin of Iceland meet Jesus?
  </li><li>Okay, so what I do is I go to a 12-step program
 to stop the drugs.
 And I was, I was so prejudiced about,
 about the rehab station here that I went out of
 that I didn't go to rehab.
 So I just cold-turkeyed everything.
 And it was, I should have gone to the hospital afterwards
 because my life, I was crazy for the first month.
 I was just like hearing voices,
 knives were talking to me, like,
 cut yourself, cut yourself, cut yourself in.
 And I really saw the demonic in the last like three months of my, uh, in, in the drug world.
 I started to see into the spirit and seen big people telling me to kill myself and, and, and
 must have been demons or something.
 But then I go through the steps and in the third steps, my, uh, my sponsor says to me
 that I need to find some God and I'm like, Oh, that's not a problem.
 We're a Christian nation.
 I'll just ask Jesus to be my God.
 And so I go on my knees and give my life to Jesus.
 And nothing really happens.
 But few weeks later, I mean, why did to this home group?
 So maybe three, four, five, six weeks, I don't know.
 Maybe at most two months went by.
 My memory is not that clear at that time because I was really not with myself.
 And so I am asked to come to this home group and I come to this home group and they asked me to sing a song there and I used to write songs.
 And so I'm I'm there do my song and then we have this home group and I say the Lord's prayer there like like ask to be my guide and then in the end of the meeting she says,
 Oh, I mean, I there won't be any more home groups. I'm losing this house. I'm moving back to my mom and daddy. So this is the last thing.
 And I'm like, I can have a home group.
 I have a brothel.
 So next Wednesday, I think it was, or Monday,
 we have a meeting at my place and it just packs out.
 First day, I mean, it was just full of people.
 And I mean, people were sitting in the windows and...
  </li><li>So you were a baby Christian hosting your first home group.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And what was previously your brothel?
  </li><li>Yeah, and it's already packed.
  </li><li>It's packed.
  </li><li>And who's coming to this?
  </li><li>Just an old friend of mine, people that,
 in the drug business.
  </li><li>And nobody thinks it's a little weird
 that the cocaine dealer of Iceland
 is now hosting a Bible study.
  </li><li>I think what's like my girlfriend at that time,
 I think she had the most, she was dating
 the most of the, one of the most dangerous guys
 in Iceland who had everything.
 And now I'm like telling her I need to move
 into the living room because I can't be sleeping in the same bed as she is.
 So I think she, I heard her, I think.
 Right.
 Because being also a baby Christian and like, I maybe took her wrong advice, but I've talked
 to her after that and I could forgive us about that.
 And of course, everything that happened before I got saved.
 So there was a lot of, like I was, I was not a good man.
 But yeah, I mean, we were seeing, we were just reading the Bible and it says, oh, tell
 people to get healed, go and heal them.
 So we were like between smokes, we were healing people and seeing miracles happening.
 And so when I preached for the first time, it was just even the pastor that came in and
 was trying to help me with it.
 He was just like, "What's in me?"
 Because he's who taught you how to preach.
 And I'm like, "I don't know."
  </li><li>So when we met you, how long have you been saved?
 We met you in November.
  </li><li>Yeah, probably, I think I quit selling drugs
 in the end of August, September, somewhere around there.
 But I have had the home group, maybe then,
 for two months.
  </li><li>Right.
 So we meet you in November.
 You've stopped selling drugs in September.
 Yeah. And, you know, we hear about this guy who just got saved and you'd let, I don't
 know how many people to the Lord by that point. Yeah. Many, many people. And, I mean, people
 who just drawn to me and God was just doing amazing things in our lives.
 But you'd never heard the message of the Father's love. No, I know. I was, I was actually
 laboring for love all the time and I had two meetings a week. I went to every jail once
 a week. So five days I'm doing ministry. And then, um, and that's all out of a place of
 trying to earn God's love.
 Yeah, I mean, I knew God should love me because it was
 word, but I knew that he couldn't like me because of who I was.
 So I thought if I could just work, work, work, work, then one
 fine day, he would look at me and say, okay, you can come and sit
 here or something.
 And but then I went to Toronto.
 And my friends invited me to go there and it totally transformed
 my life. But I think if I was if I wouldn't have gone there, my life would have been a mess and I
 would have like it's been a mess already. But it I would have burnt out.
 You would have just transferred all that energy and running drugs into running the kingdom for the
 wrong reasons. Yeah. I mean, I was gonna build the church for the drug money even.
 Yeah. I remember that you're like, what do I do with all my drug money? Do I tithe on it?
 Should I give it away? I don't know.
 So, yeah, so I just walked away from that business. Thank you,
 Jesus. But yeah, it's January 2008. I'm sitting in the
 school of ministry. Yep. There's a guy there in the HaVian
 shirt. I think he had shorts on, probably. Yeah. And older
 guy. And I'm sitting there listening to him. And he's
 talking about this message of a father and he's talking slowly and like it wouldn't be my like
 wouldn't be what I would choose as a preacher. So I'm listening to him and all of a sudden
 something happens in my heart and I just love this guy and there's so much love like on the inside
 of me and I just run to my room asking God if I'm turning gay. I'm like, I'm just like,
 what's wrong with me? I really, it was, it was, it was just, I didn't understand all
 these feelings that were coming up. So I go back down in the afternoon session and,
 and it just hits me. It's the father's love. And for the first time in my life, I can feel
 really love from a man. Right. And the father speaks into my life. And I'll tell you this,
 you know me, I was silent for a weekend. I didn't say a word for a whole weekend.
 So I stayed with two friends and they were just like, what happened to you? But I was so amazed
 that someone could just love me the way I was. And it totally transformed me in so many ways.
 Yeah, the father's love, it's the best kept secret in the church, isn't it?
 That he's kind and that he's loving and that he's a father and he's for you.
 He's not against you.
 It's all the stuff that's written in the Bible.
 Yeah.
 But somehow we missed that message for most of our lives.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it's incredible.
 And so we've just watched you over the years get transformed by the love of God.
 I remember the first time we came to Iceland, we taught how to heal the sick.
 Yeah. And I remember you sitting on the front row, like with your elbows and your knees, just like
 wide-eyed. And as we taught you for a four-line prayer, to get the sick healed. And then you left
 a conference immediately. You went to a football match. And you braid for, I don't know how many
 people in the L got healed. And you came back, you're like, it worked. I mean, that's, it was so
 simple. You know what I mean? And that's what I love about the kingdom is the simplicity of it.
 really, even though it can be complicated. But I just, I just, I just, yeah, we saw so
 many healings. We were seeing crazy things happening, like in the swimming pools, just
 out in the, yeah, everywhere. And, and, well, I remember that conference. You correct me
 if I'm wrong, because I only remember the stories, but you know the details that we
 had two loan shark debt collectors come to be up somebody at the conference who owed
 the money.
 Yeah, so they had to tell us that story.
 Yeah, so they were going to come to the, it's out in the country, it's like, and they were
 going to come to beat up this guy that owed the money.
 They even had like bats in their car.
 So they were driving to a Christian conference to find a guy who was there.
 Yeah, who owed the money to beat him up.
 Yeah.
 And so they came to the meeting and they ended up on the floor.
 I mean, they walked in and they just got wrecked by the presence of God.
 the presence of God.
 So they're just there lifting their hands
 and falling to the floor over and over again.
  </li><li>By the end of the evening,
 the guy they're gonna be up,
 plus these two guys were lying on the floor
 soaking in the presence of God.
 Just racking, just laughing their heads off.
 Of course, I don't know any of this back story.
 I'm just like, oh, it's great.
 Everybody's being touched by God.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah, but people were really like, yeah,
 it's transformed a lot.
 I mean, I remember this one thing when it was like
 six o'clock on a Friday. And this was when I was getting out of the drug business. And
 this guy, guy comes and he wants to like he owned something in one shipment that was
 going on. And he was really high on drugs. And I think he was really possessed. And he
 was drooling wide. And he was just shouting at me. And I'm like, I'm prison in two hours
 in this building. And this guy is here shouting. So I mean, I lean a little bit back. And I'm
 gonna punch him in the face like just knock him out cold. But as I'm doing that, I just
 see this vision of David Wilkeson. And when the guys are gonna steal the money in the
 movie, he's just like, if you're gonna cut me every piece is gonna shout to you. Like,
 I love you. Jesus loves you. So what I do is I just put my hand on his chest and I just
 start praying and tongues. And he just limps down and he ends up like hugging me and going
 way. I mean, it's so crazy when you're so new to all this, and God makes all these crazy miracles
 happen, and you're just amazed by it all. You know what I mean? Because I was going to punch
 him in the face. That would have probably ruined the meeting.
 But what about then? I forget the timing of it, but I remember you had a not church. It wasn't
 the church. It was a place where people would come and you had people who were strung out on drugs
 just show up. Soak for, I don't know how long, and then they would be completely off drugs.
 No side effects. Talk about that. Yeah, so I was still a bit controlling at that time.
 I mean, I was used to just say things and people would just do that. And so they would come into
 church and I would just look, lie down, lie down, right beside the altar. So we had soaking going on
 and people would just, no withdrawals, they'd throw their drugs away. How long would I take them to
 get clean? Just a day, day on the floor, it was just, and if they would start to sweat or anything,
 they would just lift their hands up and start to worship God and we'd just go away. It was really
 crazy. I mean, we were taking people that were just shooting daily drugs. They need months in
 rehab, these guys. But they were, we just took them on the floor for a day and then just in the
 halfway house and it was crazy times. Did you start your own halfway house? Yeah, yeah, of course.
 So I turned what I used for the church into a halfway house when I moved when the church got
 a new building. So you obviously have a radical salvation story and salvation is incredible.
 But the whole process of what happens after you're saved because I think so many people think that
 we just need to get people saved, but we also need to disciple people. Like salvation is obviously
 super important, but turning people from lost souls into sons of God takes time. So talk to me
 about your journey post salvation and the things that you've learned.
 Three years into my story after I got saved, I have a horrible year and actually got a
 prophetic word from Isabelle allum and she said to me that next year is going to be the
 toughest year you're ever going to go through.
 Wow.
 that to a guy like me who's been raised in all kinds of stuff and being in jail and taking somebody's
 life. I was like, I was terrified. But that word kept me alive through the year, though, because
 she said I would come through it. So I'm married, I have a young son. I get married for the wrong
 reasons I start dating a girl sleep with her, she gets pregnant and I get married to her
 because of that. And our merits, we were never happy.
 Right. So with a chat like Faith, I'm like, I think everything will be better if you just
 get married and it's just a curse. It's not going well because we're breaking the loss
 and stuff like that. Like she's kicked me out probably 50 times by then. And so, and
 And then she sues me for custody.
 With my background, you know you're going to lose.
 So my life was falling apart just by that.
 I was just super scared and I knew that I was going to lose my son and then my little
 sister dies.
 And this is all in 30 or 60 days.
 My life is a total mess.
 I mean, we tried to raise my little sister and we sit there for like six hours praying
 for her and I get like all the people I know have faith to pray for her.
 And we stop when I see bleeding coming from her nose.
 I'm like, "Oh, this is enough.
 I don't want to do anymore."
 And so that's...
 And I was wondering why she didn't wake up.
 And the devil told me that like you're fighting this drug thing and he can't even save your
 own family.
 Right.
 And so that's a big lie that like sneaks in there and I start my life has fallen apart.
 I go to my home and my old friends come to me.
 So they just say to me, but we just want to take care of these guys that gave it to her.
 So the guys got arrested because they gave her drugs
 and then they cleaned out the house
 before they called the ambulance even if she was dying.
 So one of them got sentenced for it.
 So my friends just tell me that
 they wanna take care of this for me.
 They even have to say yes, they say to me,
 "Just nod your head and we'll just
 "would take care of these guys.
 "We have some foreigners that would just go
 and really make a damage on them.
 I just knocked my head.
 I'm like, yes.
 And still after three years of preaching, forgiveness,
 preaching the love of God, preaching like who we are in Christ
 and how everything he has done for us,
 there was a still, if you come close enough to me,
 the old man will wake up.
 So the old man was there and I go out running the day after
 and I used to do that with my sister.
 And all of a sudden, it feels like she's running with me.
 So I'm running there.
 I just feel like she's there.
 And I mean, my heart just starts pumping.
 And then I just hear this sentence.
 And it's just like, how do you want to remember me?
 And I just break down in tears.
 Because obviously, if I let the guys do this,
 this will be a black thing on her memory.
 So I call the guys and I just tell them to not to do anything.
 For one day at a time, I'm saying,
 okay, I'm not gonna do this, I'm not gonna do this.
 And I'm fighting this angry man on the inside of me
 and wants justice for this.
 So, I mean,
 I really believe that this was the mercy of God.
 And this is really the story of my life.
 I mean, even though I make mistakes,
 even though I do things that I'm not supposed to do, the mercy of God just goes after me.
 And that's, I have so many stories of that. When God just goes after me, even though I
 don't take the right decisions. But it ended well, I went to prison, I forgave the guy,
 I told him that like, I loved him and I just want to bless him and forgave him totally.
 And yeah, but it's funny that a year later, I got full custody over my kid.
 And for me, that's such a miracle, you know, because I knew I was going to lose everything set.
 I was going to lose.
 I mean, right, having a sentence then, and the court and the judge, he said that I had
 I accident a few years ago that a young man died because of that.
 When I got sentenced, they said I was a felon with no remorse and they should double my
 sentence.
 But now it was an accident.
 That's really the process because when I came out speaking about forgiveness, I started
 to forgive people that have done things to me because I had a list of people that ruined
 my life.
 Of course, I did it myself, but that's what I thought.
 So I started to forgive people and as I started to forgive people, and like Jesus told me
 that I was innocent when I got saved, but I started forgiving.
 As I started to forgive, I got opportunities like I have been totally forgiven of like
 what I did.
 I have spoken to the mother of the guy that died and she had, okay, this is crazy.
 We're at this conference and she has a dream.
 And her son comes to her in a dream.
 And he says, "Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, back up."
 So you're at a conference and the mother of the man that was killed because you beat
 him up has a dream.
 Yeah.
 Okay, is she a Christian?
 She's a new Christian.
 She's just started to come to one of the big churches.
 Okay, so she's just and she has a dream.
 Go on.
 Yeah.
 And she has a dream about her son coming and he comes to her and just he looks at her
 and he says to her, "You need to release this man. You need to release this man from everything
 that he has done and totally forgive him." This is her son who's died at your hands.
 Yeah. And he in a dream is coming to her saying, "You need to forgive Baldur."
 Yeah. Okay. And so in front of 3000 people, like up in the 2000 people up on the stage,
 like we just so she comes to the conference and finds you.
 Yeah.
 And says I need to forgive you.
 Yeah.
 And chooses to do that in front of thousands of people.
 Yeah, it's crazy that, but this is the grace of God.
 I mean, if you give everything for God, this is what you get.
 And I'll tell you this, when I was in jail and I got the phone call about
 Like the lawyers calling me and because the guy was in a coma for 12 days and he's like, the guy, the guy has died.
 And I just throw the phone away and I just break down, you know what I mean?
 I knew at that point, I could never ever put my head up again.
 Like I need to go deep into drugs and stuff like that because that's that's my future now.
 Right.
 I don't have a chance to do anything else, but but God had another plan for my life.
 So she forgave me, her sister forgave me, his brother forgave me.
 And, and now even the president has given me full pardon.
 The chief of police has written your letter and gave me full pardon.
 Chief police told like the, the committee, like there's a few people that take these
 cases, the chief police, he wrote a letter to them to like release me from my past.
 I remember me and you went to prison one day.
 Yeah.
 You remember that day?
 Yeah.
 We were in one of the time food visit here and you said, you want to go
 prison today?
 And I was like, yeah, I do.
 And so we went to prison.
 Of course, everyone knew you.
 Yeah.
 All the prison guards, all the prisoners.
 Yeah.
 And yeah, talk about that.
 Talk about that was like going back into prison.
 I mean, it was, it was crazy.
 We saw so many healing cells.
 We did.
 I think guys were just amazed by the power of God.
 And I mean, I did that for a long season of my life.
 Like I was in every jail always talking to the guys.
 But there's something about going to places where people know they don't deserve.
 Yes.
 That the grace of God is readily available.
 I mean, the grace of God is readily available period.
 Yeah.
 But when you go there, they're not, they're not confused about, they're definitely not
 trying to earn anything.
 No, they think they're worthless.
 Yeah.
 And there's something beautiful about God's kindness in broken situations.
 Yeah.
 But I think, correct me if I'm wrong, I don't think I'm exaggerating, but every single person who wanted healing got healed.
 Yeah, they all got healed.
 It was funny because to begin with, none of them would admit that they needed healing.
 And they were all strong.
 And I was like, but then we got some words of knowledge about who had and then after that, everybody who wanted healing got healed.
 Yeah, it was crazy.
 And a bunch of them got saved.
 Yeah.
 That's just the power of God.
 I like when you bring light to this kind of darkness, it's bright.
 And these guys see hope.
 So yeah, I actually just, I have been talking to the chief of prison.
 No, right.
 And emails and I've been asking him if I, if I can help him to rehabilitate the prisoners,
 I think they don't trust me yet.
 (laughs)
 But I mean, I know that I have something to give them.
 So I will keep punching that back until that opens up.
 But because these guys, they have no hope.
 I know how it is to have no hope
 and know that you're just a trash.
 So nothing matters really.
 You put on a show for good behavior, you know,
 and then you go out.
 I think if you're in prison for three years or longer,
 in Iceland, 80%, they die in prison
 on the way to prison or just got out of prison.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>So they get stuck in the system.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So yeah.
  </li><li>But you found the kindness of God.
 Oh, the kindness of God found you?
  </li><li>Yeah, it found me.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, I wasn't looking.
 So the fear of God that came on me,
 I forgot to tell you about that.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, so well, let's recap though.
 So you were saying in early in January 2007, all of a sudden you started getting fearful
 and you were trying to work out is it paranoia from all the drugs I've done?
 What is it?
 So now fast forward, I don't know, six or seven years and you find out what?
 I mean North Carolina, I'm talking to my friend there and he's telling me about this trip
 that he and three other people from a house of prayer took.
 So they're driving down.
 And these are Americans who came to Iceland on a prayer trip.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So they wanted to, they wanted to pray for Iceland.
 And so they're driving down my street and this girl's the, she just gets slain in the
 spirit.
 Right.
 So she's like, stop the car.
 We need to pray here.
 And they didn't know I lived there.
 Right.
 But they stopped right outside my house.
 So she started praying like God, give us a, give us a drug dealer.
 someone to offend the religion in this nation, give someone that can break off religion.
 And so she's praying like this. And from that time, I couldn't sleep.
 So you didn't know any of this many years later. Many years later.
 But team from America come for whatever reason, they stop on your street led by the Holy Spirit.
 They pray for a pimp, a drug dealer, somebody who will break the shackles off religion.
 And from that point on, the fear of the Lord comes on you. And that's how you end up getting saved.
 Yeah. You can't make the stuff up. So it's crazy. So what are you doing now, Baldur?
 Now I have a wonderful, wonderful life. I have a amazing wife called Barbara,
 and I have eight kids. Yes, you do. I'll tell you this. Like when I entered the room before I got
 saved, little children would cry. When I come home from work today, eight kids. Okay, we
 have six living with us. And I mean, they run to me. Yeah. God trust me with eight children.
 And that's crazy. So I finally found the right wife and got my heart healed up before. Thank
 Thank you, Jesus.
 And so she's so amazing.
 I love her so much.
 And she's totally transformed me in a way and she owe me kindness and love and really
 what relationships are all about because I didn't even know that, obviously.
 But when we are pastoring a church together called Cats the Fire, Reykjavik, and I mean,
 Yeah, we are, we're going to see the nation saved for Iceland.
 So from drug dealer and Pimp to pastor and father.
 Yeah.
 That's just the work of the kingdom.
 It's crazy, man.
 And I really, really like, I'll tell you this, if I was in a line,
 if there would be a hair in my food or something, I would slap people, throw
 I would get into fights in lines.
 I was so angry all the time.
 But today I am so loving all the time.
 It's like for a man like me knowing who I was
 and who I am today, it's sometimes I just sit down
 and I just, it just amazes me even today,
 nine years later, just how did all this happen?
  </li><li>Gosh, Robert, I will love you.
 you. Thank you for taking time out your schedule to come and tell some of your story. We love your
 nation. We love your family. And we just can't wait to see what God does with you and your nation
 in the coming years. Love you too. Thank you so much. Oh, Baldur, we love you. You are amazing.
 I miss you already. You and Barbara, just, yeah, it was so great to get some time with you.
 Yeah. And thank you for sharing your story with our listeners.
 Yeah. Thank you.
 Speaking of listeners about listeners question, this is an anonymous question.
 And it says this, "The biggest struggle I'm having is that even after so many encounters and
 experiences with God, I'm still falling back and fighting with my struggles with sexual
 defiance. I love God, but it's been so difficult to stay pure in life. I got a revelation that I'm
 a child of God and yet loneliness cripples me and I derail. It's like get a revelation,
 testing gets more intense. The main reason I think is because I don't trust that God will be
 faithful to bring His call and promises on my life. Also, it's been the hardest three years
 where I feel so lonely even after having a great God time or a week or being in His will.
 I often see other people do their lives outside of the will of God or even openly against Him and
 think, "Why am I trying to do it God's way? If I just walked away, I would get everything I ever
 wanted the other seem to have. There seems to be some loneliness and trust in God. Is that normal?
 I can't share everything that God is doing in my life either with others because people would
 think I'm crazy. Though I do lead worship and encourage others, I find myself discouraged.
 I am not in such a great church, but God has called me to be there and pray and lead worship,
 and I am seeing things slowly shift, but I still feel lonely.
 Well, I am so sorry that you feel lonely that sounds super hard. Sounds very, very difficult.
 You've covered a huge range of points that we'd like to touch on and try to answer your question.
 One of the things that I want to start with seemingly has nothing to do with
 the problem of sexual sin, but I think it's connected. So you're talking about when you
 ask the question, is it normal for me to look at other people who are not walking with God and
 seemingly getting their own way and feel like I'm wasting the best parts of my life trying
 to follow God. I think that is a very normal feeling for people to go through. In fact,
 David in Psalm 73, his whole lament to the Lord is exactly the same thing. He talked about,
 this is Psalm 73 verse 3 says, "I envied the proud when I saw them prospered despite their
 wickedness. They seem to live such painless lives. Their bodies are so healthy and strong.
 They don't have troubles like other people. I mean, if you read Psalm 73, it's exactly what you're
 describing, the difficulty in the pain of serving God and not seeming like you're getting what your
 heart desires, while people who are completely against God seem to be prospering. But the whole
 some changes at some point where it says in verse 17, "Then I went into your presence
 of God and I finally understood the destiny of the wicked." There's something about eternity
 that sets what we're going through right now in its proper perspective. And so I want
 to encourage you, you will never go wrong trusting God. And I think it's interesting
 that you said that the main reason is that you don't trust God to be faithful to his
 call and promise on your life. That would be whether or not that's tied to the problems
 you're having with sexual sin. That would be a great place to sit down and just journal
 with God. Like, "Lord, can you help me understand? I'm realizing I don't trust you. That's not
 the way I want to live, but can you help me understand why?" And the Holy Spirit is so
 good that He will always want to reveal strongholds that are keeping you from a greater revelation
 of him. So that would be the first thing I would say, and it seems like it has nothing
 to do with sex, but go after that, go after the lack of trust you feel in your heart.
 Yeah, anonymous. I actually remember having seasons where I felt exactly like that. Like
 I felt like, gosh, I'm pursuing God and there's people around me who definitely are not and
 seem to be prospering. And I don't really understand it. And I would say exactly my
 issue was trusting God, which was a huge one for me for a number of years.
 And I mean, when I look at those people now that I was feeling like they were prospering
 and I wasn't, I would never trade my life for theirs at this stage, because there's always
 the consequences of how anybody lives and they may not come up at the time.
 Well, it's that whole thing of seasons, isn't it? And lifestyle that when you're in a season
 where it doesn't look bleak, you think that's the rest of your life. Yeah.
 Because you haven't realized it's a season. Yeah. And so there's a temptation there to
 shortcut what God's doing for the results. I mean, Ray was talking about that this morning
 with Jesus in the desert. He was hungry and the devil was just like, "Ah, you know what? I'll
 I'll just give you a shortcut to what you want.
 And that's the greatest ploy of the enemy, isn't it?
 A short circuit what God's doing.
 Yeah.
 So, so one of the things that God had me do during that season was go through
 and find a whole bunch of scripture verses about trust.
 And I'm not necessarily a name and claim person, but I started proclaiming
 over myself the promises of trusting God and that I would be able to trust him.
 So I literally would just pray out loud over myself versus about trusting God.
 And I would say, I will trust God.
 I will be a person who's able to trust God and whatever.
 And something really shifted for me.
 And I did pray those prayers for quite a while.
 Um, but I started actually believing what I was saying.
 And there was a, there was a huge shift.
 The same thing you talk about is the sole issue of loneliness.
 And I think loneliness is one of the most devastating things
 a human heart can endure.
 We've got a great friend who is one of the wisest people I know.
 And I remember one time the Holy Spirit was really moving on him,
 and he said, if I could have things my way,
 I would eradicate loneliness from the lives of others.
 I wonder if a root cause of you falling into sexual sin
 is the need for comfort because of the overwhelming loneliness.
 There's a couple of routes or a common routes that you find in sexual sin.
 And one is that whole issue of self-come for,
 of, of trying to meet a need that your heart is desperately aching for.
 In this case, connectedness or loneliness would be the, uh,
 the thing that you're trying to fail.
 What I found is that when we focus on the thing that we're doing wrong and try
 not to do those things, we inevitably fail because if we could buy our own
 efforts, stop sinning. We wouldn't have needed Jesus.
 Right. Exactly.
 So don't focus on sin management. Focus on any area of your life that
 God that you feel lacking, because that's actually the next landscape that God's
 going to do a miracle in your life. So if you're feeling loneliness, and you're
 talking about how you can't connect with other Christians or the church that
 you're in isn't meeting your need, then then ask the Holy Spirit to be the
 comforter, asked the Holy Spirit to be the person who will make his presence very, very
 apparent to you, because he did say I'll never leave you. He did say I'll never forsake you.
 But sometimes we're not aware of his presence and we can fall in the trap and thinking that he
 has left us or that he has forsaken us.
 Right.
 So, you know, sin management, either we end up in defeat or we end up in pride because,
 well, we think that we're being super successful and not looking at porn or
 those sorts of things. But the trouble is, when we do things in our own strength, failure is inevitable.
 And then we feel worse, worse off completely. So don't focus on the sin, focus on the Lord.
 1 Thessalonians 4 verse 3 says, "It is God's will that you should be sanctified,
 that you should avoid sexual immorality." Listen, God doesn't order what He cannot pay for.
 So it's his will and he will empower you to do his will.
 I think having that revelation, the sexual purity is God's will for my life.
 And if it's his will, then he will empower my will to come into alignment with his
 will was the thing that that transformed my life.
 Here's four things that I found in my life that helped me get free from, from my
 struggles with sexual sin and and Agee and I have a taught on this extensively. We have
 a teaching on our website islandag.com all about sexual purity. But here's the four things
 I found really, really helpful. The first thing was getting free from the effects of
 generational sin. Yeah. There's an obscure verse in scripture that talks about the effects
 of sexual sin and your relationship with God going back to the 10th generation. That's
 2046 ancestors that you could be reaping the results of their sin.
 So dealing with that is super helpful.
 The second thing is actually walking in the light, finding somebody who has got victory
 in their own life and confessing to them what's going on in your life.
 In Scripture it says, "The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
 My testimony is I just found the godliest man I could think of and humbled myself and
 just went to him and said, "This is what I'm struggling with. Would you pray for me?"
 And God bless him. He did. And I felt an immediate shift in my life. And then actually having
 accountability in your life to keep you from going back to where God rescued you from was
 super important. And then lastly, just having that vibrancy of relationship with God that
 meets the aches in your heart that cause you to self comfort.
 It was just huge for me.
 You can listen to our teaching,
 like I said, I'll put a link in the show notes
 and hopefully that would have been some help for you.
 But so we'll be praying for you
 that the Holy Spirit would meet you
 in the midst of loneliness.
 But why don't we pray for everybody right now
 who's feeling isolated or lonely?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Father, I ask that for every single person
 is listening to this podcast, Lord, that you would come and you would be so real right
 now wherever they're sitting. Holy Spirit, I ask that you would come and you would surround
 them with your presence. And you would show them just how not alone they really are. Lord,
 ask that you would bring about things in all of their lives and their circumstances and
 their relationships that would shift loneliness to the background
 ground. And Lord, that they would just really have a real and
 vibrant relationship with you where they would feel connected
 and they would know how loved they are and how chosen they are
 and how accepted they are, and that they could live out of that
 place. But I ask that you would come and you would just do what
 only you can do and love us back to life. Amen. Amen. All right,
 Wednesday, June 15th is coming up quickly.
 It's our deadline for applications to be in for the School of Supernatural Life.
 Whoop, whoop.
 I'm sure you've heard us talk about the school, but if you want more information, go to Alan
 and AJ.com/SOSL and that will take you to the link of Grace and her School of Supernatural
 Life.
 And there's plenty of videos and information there for you.
 There's new videos every year, of course, so there's videos from all different years
 and stuff, but we'd love to have you join us on the school.
 And if you want show notes for this episode with links to everything we talked about,
 go to allen and ag.com/106. See you next week.
