  <li>Oh yeah.
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses, sharing their life, experience it.
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses.
 They talk about faith in God and everything under the sun.
 If you are a human being, there's something here for everyone.
 Mrs Jones. Yes, sir.
 Would you like to talk about supper tonight?
 It was a fail.
 It was a risotto fail.
 Well, it was only a fail if it was supposed to be risotto.
 It was only fail if it was supposed to be edible.
 If it was like cement, then it was just complete success.
 I just don't know what happened.
 No.
 I've never had a risotto so bad.
 Well, I've never made it risotto so bad.
 OK, that's much better.
 But you know what?
 What?
 Ice cream redeems everything.
 Doesn't it though?
 Yeah.
 Or donuts.
 We don't have any donuts, but we do have ice cream.
 Oh, let's make this quick then.
 We've got raspberry sorbet.
 I know there's no dairy in it.
 And it's made out of raspberries.
 If you ignore the sugar, it's practically a health food.
 Well, sugar is a natural thing.
 Well, not the sugar is added to the stuff I can guarantee you.
 Do you have a good week this week?
 I did.
 I know you did.
 Why?
 Because you were with me every moment of it.
 Because we're basically inseparable.
 And I like that.
 I do too.
 Most of the time.
 Money and Disney, we talk to the school on prophetic ministry.
 Yes.
 Didn't our students do good?
 They did awesome.
 Wednesday, we took a day of work.
 We did.
 Why did we do that?
 Because your dad was in town.
 And what do we do with my dad all day on Wednesday?
 We ate things.
 Yeah, we started out with a croat.
 We did.
 Which he loves.
 He does love them.
 Yes.
 Well, I come by my sweet tooth, honestly.
 You definitely come by your sweet tooth, honestly.
 So we had a, we had a donut that girls, our girls are eight year old, our six year old,
 we're at school and they missed grandpa. So they made us take their dolls with us everywhere
 to take photographs of grandpa and the dolls, which we did. We chronicled our whole day with
 two dolls, much of the amusement of everyone.
 And I think you both did really well. I never carried the dolls. It was always you and your dad.
 And then your dad made them look like they were eating french fries and drinking drinks and all
 kinds of things. So they were thrilled.
 very creative yes i was very clever yes we have to post on the photos online.
 So if you go to the show notes you'll see photos of my father.
 You can't do that now asking for permission of the he'll care okay i think they're adorable so i know we had cronuts and then he had what he calls a mocha.
 That we call a mocha i don't actually know how to pronounce but he declared it the best mocha he'd ever had well that's good way to go on his rosters way to go and then we just took him on a culinary tour of our favorite places we did we took him for sushi.
 Mm-hmm. I wish she had a salad instead and we ate sushi at wild ginger. That's very true. And then we drove all about to
 12 south and got the Chinese ice cream. We did. What was the problem with doing all that driving in electric car?
 Well, apparently it has a limited range and we decided to surpass
 the limited range of our electric vehicle. And how did we solve that problem? We floated on air
 into Whole Foods and plugged it in. We made it with zero percent on the charger and zero miles left
 and then we just kind of charged up for a bit, enjoyed a mocha and then drove home.
 Yeah, just in time to turn around and...
 Well, it doesn't time to come home and find out that the starter on our minivan had died
 and so we couldn't drive my dad to the airport.
 Yes.
 But thankfully, Shannon Macleard came to our rescue and rescue us.
 On the topic of amazing food, do you know what I discovered this week?
 What?
 Possibly the best fish tacos I've ever had in my life.
 Really? Where?
 Well, Bill Butler, being the genius that he has said, if you want good fish tacos, why don't you come to the
 the fish dealer at the factory and I said I do not know which dealer you speak of.
 As you don't deal in fish that often? No but hidden in the factory is a little restaurant
 called Gulf Pride and it's just a seafood store. They sell seafood wholesale to a lot
 of restaurants but they also have this tiny little restaurant and I had these tuna fish
 tacos and they were delicious. There were three dollars each. That's amazing. Unbelievable.
 If I could eat tuna I would go and eat those. Well here's the thing I found out they changed
 the fish every week this in the tacos. So last week it was sea bass. Who has sea bass
 tackles? I was during the master of the word tacos. See tacos, darling, not tacos. Who
 makes sea bass tacos? Well, I just don't know. That reminds me that's like the verbal
 equivalent of the time we got those DVD exes. The like, Slim and Six. Was it South Beach
 He was a little bit sick, something, I don't know.
 And we had to do an exercise where you curled your arms up and then you kick your heels back.
 Or something?
 I just could not do it and you would die laughing and I would get mad and turn off the DVD.
 It's true, but it was so funny.
 Clearly coordination in some areas is not my high point.
 No, but you're adorable.
 Thursday night we made the escapade to East Nashville.
 We did and we went to the little octopus.
 Well, first we went to Burista Parlor.
 Have you been there before? Once. The last time I went, the people didn't seem like they wanted
 outside people there, but this time the staff were amazing and very welcoming. Well that's because
 we knew them. Well even the ones we didn't know were friendly. That's because one of the staff that
 didn't know us gave them the secret knowledge that said these are outsiders but they're okay.
 Okay well whichever way it was a much better experience. And I had delicious tea there.
 Yes, it was great tea.
 And then Saturday, what do we do Saturday?
 Well, we didn't finish talking about little octopus.
 Oh, yeah, we ate a little octopus on Thursday night.
 Good heavens, the food. It was so good.
 What was your favorite thing you ate?
 The avocado thing.
 The avocado thing.
 The avocado salad with the...
 I don't know what they put in it. I don't know. It had magic in it.
 I think that was unicorn tears. It's a unicorn tear avocado salad.
 Wow.
 It was delicious.
 But the fingerling potatoes were also good.
 I could go there and just be a vegetarian.
 all the vegetables were amazing. I had the shrimp something rather that wasn't as awesome.
 You just said I could go there via vegetarian, I had the shrimp thing that was quite amazing.
 All right, Saturday, what do we do Saturday? We went to touch a truck.
 And what is touch a truck for people who are not enlightened to the southern pastime?
 Well, it's weird. I heard about it last year, but I've never been to one. And they basically
 have every kind of truck you can think of set up in a church parking lot. And like, so fire trucks,
 with ladders and ambulances and cars. Everything to MJ was known by its rescue bot name.
 Right.
 Of course. But then they had like garbage trucks, recycled trucks, great big diggers,
 all kinds of stuff. And the kids can sit in the driver's seat and, you know,
 pretend to move things around.
 You know my favorite part?
 What?
 It was all the little children honking the horns of all the different trucks.
 That was the very worst part.
 Yeah.
 It was horrible.
 I think the worst was the police car because the officer that was standing with the car,
 she was letting them all run the sirens.
 So she'd be like, and I'll press this and the sirens and I'm like, don't do it.
 It was so loud.
 Well, it was.
 An accelerant to us leaving.
 It was.
 I was motivated to go, but it was cute because we, uh, we got to find out just how
 well MJ knows his truck names because we would call them all the same thing.
 And he would clarify.
 who say, oh, look, I'm good. There's a digger. And he'd say, that's an excavator, which he was correct.
 All those countless hours watching YouTube's kids channel is paying off. Right. He's practically homeschooling himself.
 Hmm. Only right now, he's found something where it's nursery rhymes, but Spider-Man is dancing around to nursery rhymes, and it's just hideous.
 It is confusing, to say the least. But he thinks it's awesome.
 Our main topic for this week is the language of heaven.
 Yes.
 You came up with that title.
 Yes.
 I don't know if I so much meant the language of heaven as building a language with God
 when you're learning to prophesy.
 Right.
 But building a language with God was too big for the title.
 So I shortened it to language of heaven.
 Okay.
 Oh, yes.
 So we're talking about the language of heaven.
 Well, basically the premise is that God's first language is not English.
 Correct.
 You don't realize that you'll be waiting a long time for God to speak to you.
 Yes, apparently God's first language is actually Finnish.
 And theologically, that's how?
 Well, when I was in Finland, they explained to me that when Jesus was on the cross, he
 said it is Finnish.
 And so that's how they know.
 That is terrible.
 Yes.
 My point though is if you think that God speaks to you the way that you speak to other
 people, you might be missing what he's trying to say.
 Okay.
 Well, my big revelation was that I had to learn to hear God the way he speaks, rather than the man that he speaks the way I listen.
 Because I was thinking, well, you know, God, I pray and I fast and I read the Bible.
 So surely you'll just speak to me.
 And I had to learn that God had been speaking to me for a long time, which is that I didn't recognize it.
 Right.
 Because he chooses to speak in ways I wouldn't choose to be communicated to.
 And in all different ways, even if you're one person.
 Well, first of all, Job 33 14, one of my favorite verses says,
 now God does speak now one way, now and other.
 The man may not perceive it.
 So the point is that God's speaking, but we just have difficulty perceiving what he's saying.
 Right.
 And the primary reason for that is we want to speak English.
 And he loves to speak in parables and riddles and.
 Well, we want we want him to draw a blueprint.
 Right.
 And he wants a relationship.
 Yeah.
 What's that verse?
 It's in Proverbs.
 It says it's a glory of God to conceal a matter.
 It's a glory of Kings.
 The search matter.
 Right.
 So rather than him just telling something straightforward, he gives you a riddle.
 Yeah.
 So that he gets to double the time he spends with you.
 He gets to spend time with you, giving you the riddle.
 And then he gets to spend time with you when you come to him to say, could you help me search this matter out?
 And he's like, Oh, I'd love to.
 Right.
 And you're like, this is fascinating.
 Once you understand it, it's frustrating when you don't.
 Numbers 12 or six, listen to this.
 It says, listen to my words.
 When there's a prophet among you, I, the Lord, reveal myself to them in visions
 and I speak to them in dreams.
 So by God's own admission, he actually favors dreams and visions.
 And this whole aspect of spontaneous flow of the Holy Spirit is great, but I never
 heard anything in my whole Christian walk really about teaching on dreams
 Yeah, well, I mean, obviously I was sort of in a different background once I made it
 to Toronto.
 So I would hear some stuff about dreams and visions.
 And I experienced tons of dreams.
 I just didn't really understand what was going on at the time.
 Well, my problem was I don't know what a vision looked like.
 And I just chalked up all dreams to pro-food choices the day before.
 And I've told a story before about when God gave me a really radical dream that came to
 past several weeks or maybe months later. And that got my attention to the fact that God
 speaks in dreams, but still, knowing that God speaks in dreams and knowing what he's
 saying in your dreams is two different things.
 Yeah, for sure. I often wonder if part of why God likes speaking through dreams is we're
 not as in control of blocking the revelation.
 Oh, absolutely.
 Like, you know, what was amazing to me is I would say a lot of contemporary Christians
 wouldn't think that God speaks through dreams. Really? Well, maybe not in the circles we
 move in, but the circles I used to move in. Right. I think if you went to several of
 the mainline denominational churches here in town and just said, "Oh yeah, God speaks
 in dreams," people wouldn't believe me. Yeah. But they'd be content to believe that God
 did speak in dreams. Right. So it's funny how we're comfortable with the way God is when
 we look at it in the Bible, but we're not comfortable about the way God is when it relates to us.
 So for example, we read the stories of Joseph and Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar's dreams and
 we can clearly see that God was speaking.
 But the way he was speaking was still symbolically and it still needed somebody to interpret it.
 You had this in the case of Nebuchadnezzar and unbeliever so impacted by what God's
 saying that today we'd probably just throw it out.
 So it's amazing that God places a high value on things that we might not.
 How did you learn to understand what God was saying, especially when it was in, I don't
 want to say riddle form, but not the most obvious form?
 You mean in terms of dreams?
 Or visions.
 I think it's a little different for me with dreams because I don't usually dream the kind
 of dreams that require interpreting.
 Oh yeah, you cheat.
 Yeah, I'm a cheater.
 I'm a dream cheater.
 But learning what he's saying through visions, I mean, I think that's where what I was talking
 about, "Hey, let's talk about building a language with God."
 When you're talking to him a lot about different things and he's giving you pictures and you're
 asking him questions about the things that he's showing you, you start to build a language
 and you start to realize that, for me, certain pictures mean certain things.
 So I know if I see this one certain picture that it's a thing about mentoring and pastoring.
 And I know as that picture changes when there's different elements involved, what age it is
 that they're mentoring or pastoring.
 So like there's you, I've built a visual language with God.
 Like in you, I know you have like different colors mean different things to you.
 I have some colors that mean different things to me, but ours are not the same.
 Right.
 The point is we're cultivating our intimate journey with the Lord.
 You know, what means stuff to us.
 So for example, if people to look at our emoji chats over text, me and you, that is,
 AJ and Alan, sending stuff back and forth, there's a whole of in-jokes in our texts.
 One word references play on words, jokes that we've had for 10 years of being married that
 other people wouldn't necessarily get because they're not asked.
 We often joke about playing picturing with a married couple, for example, what a nightmare
 that is, that they might pull up a card and they very quickly draw a frying pan and the
 The spikes was like, "Romeo and Juliet!"
 And you were like, "How the heck did you get Romeo and Juliet from a frying pan?"
 But what we're not privy to is, on their honeymoon, he was going to make our beautiful
 meal.
 He dropped a frying pan on her toe.
 They were scheduled to go see Romeo and Juliet, but they had to spend the night in the emergency
 ward getting her broken toe fixed because he was a clots.
 And for them, frying pan, oh, it totally means that time that we missed out Romeo and Juliet.
 And so that's a great example of this rich history that they have together.
 It doesn't mean that frying pans universally mean Romeo and Juliet.
 Right.
 And that's where it gets a little bit dangerous, saying, this always means that and this always
 means that because even when we've sat down before, even when we've sat down before with
 Gary and said, "Hey, what does this mean to you?
 What does that mean?
 It's different from how you see it and it's different from how I see it as well."
 Well, even the Bible isn't consistent in some of its symbolism.
 So the classic one is what does a serpent mean?
 Satan.
 Right.
 But there's also that time in the Old Testament where Moses fashioned a serpent and everyone
 who looked at it was saved and it was of course a type of Christ on the cross, the sin that
 he bore.
 Right.
 And then there's the lion.
 Which of course is the lion of the tribe of Judah.
 Except when it's not and it's the lion, your enemy that's probably like a lion.
 So even in the Bible, you have to have a relationship with the Holy Spirit, you have
 to have context to work out what symbol he's talking about.
 I can just imagine some people listening to this going, "What are you guys talking
 about?"
 And yet, it's important to understand that actually Jesus ministered out of vision.
 So in John 5 verse 19, Jesus said, "I only do what I see my Father doing."
 So how did he see what his Father was doing?
 I mean, Jesus was on earth, his father was in heaven.
 Right.
 And he quite clearly says, "The Son of Man can do nothing on his own.
 I only do what I see my father doing."
 So he'd learned to see either in vision form or through a dream what his father was doing.
 And that's why he had such success in ministry.
 Right.
 I think it's funny that Jesus, the Son of God, learned to depend on hearing from his father.
 But somehow, certainly for large periods of my life, I was like, "No, I don't need all
 that stuff.
 That's all fleek.
 Jesus does. I don't. Yeah, I work for you.
 Perhaps very well. You know, it took me a while to grasp the fact that God actually loves,
 even though says so in the Bible, that he does love dreams and he does love visions.
 But I think the most alarming thing for me was the passages in Matthew concerning the birth of his son.
 So here's Jesus, the most precious thing to the Father.
 and he entrusts his welfare to communication via dreams. Look at this. In Matthew chapter
 1, Joseph finds out that Mary is pregnant and he has enmined to divorce her. But instead,
 it says this in verse 20, when he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph
 in a dream saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife
 for the child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
 And you're like, well, yeah, we know that story.
 But what's interesting is God didn't need to speak to him in a dream.
 He could have simply brought Isaiah 714 to Joseph's consciousness, which says,
 the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him a manual.
 So rather than speaking to Joseph on the Sabbath, maybe in a synagogue and having somebody read out
 that verse from Isaiah, he chose to speak to him in a dream. I think it's remarkable.
 And he just again, if that wasn't enough, the wise man would come to visit them. Herod is on
 the rampage. And an angel of the Lord comes to Joseph in a dream and says, "Get up,
 flee to Egypt with the child and his mother. Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod
 is going to search for the child to kill him." So again, ensuring Jesus stays alive is entrusted
 to a dream. So that's the value that God places on communicating to his children through dreams.
 He trusted his son's life. Again, he didn't actually need to give him a dream. He could have
 just given him Hosea 11-1 out of Egypt. I called my son. So he could have again, Joseph could have
 just gone to synagogue, heard the rabbi teaching that and really been impacted by the Holy Spirit,
 but he chose a dream. Give me an example of some of, if you feel comfortable, give an example of
 of some of the times you've had a dream or a vision that doesn't make sense until you
 had it interpreted.
 Well, I can't actually, I can't remember this particular dream, but I remember having a dream,
 and it was the first time that I didn't have the typical kind of dreams that I have.
 Right.
 So it was the first time that I was like, "Oh, this is totally from eating pizza.
 You know, like this is, this is not a God dream.
 It's so random."
 And, you know, there's all these different weird things in it.
 But I remember, you know, going out for lunch with Sarah and saying, "Hey,
 you know, I had this dream and whatever." She's like, "Oh, tell it to me." And I'm like, "Oh, I don't think it's a God dream."
 She's like, "Oh, just tell me." So I told her this whole dream. I mean, totally random dream.
 -Right. -And- -And- -I think it's time to be.
 -Yeah, and like, whoa, I don't, you know, because I don't have those kind of dreams very often. It seemed very strange.
 And there was like three different acts, if you will, like three different scenes or whatever.
 And at the end, she's like, "Well, I wonder if," and she totally read my mail, like all the stuff that I was
 processing with the Lord, but not talking to anybody else about, you know, and I was like, "Oh,
 okay, that might have been a God dream," you know, but it was so weird. I've often said
 that if people knew how we got the revelation we got,
 there would maybe question whether we're hearing from God. And I say that because
 Because when God started to be through dreams and visions, it took me so long to believe it was God because of the manner in which it came.
 I just thought this is so flaky, it's so subjective, there's no way this can be God.
 And yet the fruit of changed lives and meeting people and people saying how did you know that and you're like oh my gosh if you knew how I caught on court knew that.
 you would laugh because most of the revelation i get is play on words it's pictures it you know without the holy spirit giving me an interpretation it means.
 I mean nothing so there's a whole story about bob jones who's a profit who's now with the lord and and he was at a meeting and somebody said do you have a word and so you grab the microphone he said sausage and beans sausage and beans sausage and beans.
 He sits down and everyone's like, "Oh, the poor man, he's lost his marbles."
 So that was his revelation.
 That meant absolutely nothing to anybody except a mother in the audience who just lost her
 son.
 She was just asking the father, "Lord, I don't know if my son is with you in heaven or if
 he just was lost to hell."
 The app comes Bob and says, "Sausage means sausage means sausage means sausage means."
 This woman, her son drove a van with sausage and beans on the side.
 we did for a living deliver these things. And so it didn't mean anything to anybody else.
 It meant something to her and it was an absolute confirmation.
 Right. And if you tried to interpret it, he would have ruined it.
 Right. So the interpretation process or rather learning God's language, learning the way he speaks
 is incredibly childlike, requires great levels of humility and meekness and huge amounts of
 faith that I actually mean stuff. So when I speak to, you know, prophet friends of mine who have
 got amazing revelation, I asked them, how did you know that? And when they tell me, I'm like, man,
 you guys took a leap of faith in saying that, like that's, that's unbelievable. Like Gary Morgan
 was ministering a church a couple months ago. And he said he saw a young man in heaven playing a
 guitar. And he saw Reese's Pieces everywhere in a little chocolates. So he turns to the woman and
 says, I see Reese in heaven. And I'm like, how did you know his name was Reese? He was like,
 well, there's Reese's pieces everywhere. So the woman who just has that revelation,
 knowing her son is in heaven by his name is astonishing. She doesn't care that the
 prophet got it by one of his favorite candy bars. But for me, I'm like, am I just hungry?
 Do I just have a chocolate craving? I would never think that must be the guy's name. But to Gary
 was like, Oh, well, you know, it was obvious. I remember a prophet friend of ours gave this
 this word, really accurate word about an earthquake hitting and the three different
 Richter scales in different parts of the world.
 And I was like, man, that word was so precise.
 It was so accurate.
 That was amazing.
 So I asked him, I said, you know, did an angel come and give you that?
 Like, how did you get that?
 And he said, no, I had a picture of a dartboard and three darts being thrown and where they
 landed was the numbers of the Richter scale.
 And I was like, how did you know that was an earthquake?
 And he was like, no, I just did.
 And again, he's built up this repertoire with a lord.
 If I see a vision of a dartboard, I really wouldn't know what the numbers are because I don't know what a dartboard looks like.
 But I would never think, "Oh, that's an earthquake."
 Right.
 So I guess what we're saying is in your journey with the Lord, that great place to start is read all the parables in the New Testament.
 Yeah.
 And read all the dreams in the Old and the New Testament because you will begin to get a sense of the flavor of the way God speaks.
 Here's a simple one in Jeremiah. He says, "What do you see?"
 And he says, "I see a boiling pot tilting away from the North."
 And the Lord says, yeah, you've seen correctly from the North disasters about to be poured out on the land.
 And it's not too hard to understand the visual play there or the play on words there, but God is just a genius.
 Yeah, and he wants to have a conversation.
 He wants to play a picture with you.
 Yeah, he kind of does.
 Well, you have to kind of undo your desire to intellectually grasp everything about God.
 where you have to be childlike.
 Oh, it's such a painful process to begin with.
 Yeah.
 Really is.
 So that's our rambling thoughts really on the language of heaven.
 Our point was God doesn't speak the way you think he will.
 He loves to speak in dreams and visions.
 If you're not fluent in dreams and visions, welcome to the club.
 But a great place to start is to be childlike, to ask lots of questions,
 to get around people who are older and wiser, to study the scripture and learn
 the parabolic language that the Lord uses. In fact, I said about Jesus, he said nothing to the people
 without using parables. He really loved using picture stories.
 Yeah. You also retain picture stories better.
 It's almost like he knew that picture is like a thousand words.
