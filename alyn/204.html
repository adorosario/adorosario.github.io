<p> I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 204 of Keeping Up With the Joneses.
 I'm AJ.<br/>
 And I'm Alan and we're here to kick off your week.
 Happy Monday everybody.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Which doesn't always work because you might not be listening to this on a Monday.
 But if it's not Monday, happy whatever day it is.
 Exactly.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 This week we're going to be talking about hearing God's voice.
 But before we do that, Mrs. Jones, let's do catch up.
 I like it when you call me Mrs. Jones.
 You do?<br/>
 Yeah, I don't know why.<br/>
 But I do.<br/>
 OK, what happened this last week?<br/>
 We had Jack Deere at the school following the conference.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And we had you at M.<br/>
 Nate, didn't we?<br/>
 Yeah, I talked about this thing that's been running around my head is
 the importance of what happens when we don't know we're wrong.
 And so I try to give like five litmus tests.
 Things you do when you know you're wrong and your wrongness is being exposed.
 Mm.<br/>
 Kind of ninja moves that we used to defend ourselves.
 So I'll put a link to that in the show notes if that sounds interesting.
 There you go.<br/>
 That does sound interesting.<br/>
 On Wednesday night, we had family fun night.
 Don't worry about that.<br/>
 Well, Wednesday night, of course, was October 31st, which is the devil's
 birthday, according to my children.<br/>
 Like, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what it is.
 That's not what it is.<br/>
 Um, yeah, never mind.<br/>
 But anyway, so we don't celebrate Halloween and I think a couple of weeks ago we talked about that and said we would post
 Something in the show notes. Did we did we I don't know I did a teaching recently on Halloween to just sort of explain where we're at with it, but
 So<br/>
 We had a family fun night so that people could come to church and have fun as opposed to dressing up and
 celebrating<br/>
 Halloween and so you filled out the church with
 inflatable...<br/>
 What are they called?
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, jumpy houses.
 And there was like a laser jumpy house.
 And there was all kinds of stuff.
  </li><li>Basically the church was turned into a carnival.
  </li><li>A carnival, indoor carnival.
 Everybody had a great time.
  </li><li>And there was cotton candy.
  </li><li>There was some, there was those big potatoes
 were so good with a chili.
  </li><li>Oh, chili.
  </li><li>Anyway, that was Wednesday night.
 Thursday, praise God was a day off.
  </li><li>It was.
 We had fun, didn't we?
 We had a big basically a big day off, which was really nice.
 I slept in.
 Well, I didn't sleep in.
 I went back to bed after the kids got on the bus.
 Right.
 Got up.
 Got the kids on the bus and you went back to bed and I played Zelda.
 I haven't played Zelda in forever.
 Really?
 I was pretty sure you played just the day before.
 Well, I mean, but forever I met it felt like forever.
 I should clarify.
 You should.
 I haven't played that game in Zelda.
 Breath of the wild.
 I've been concentrating on a different Zelda.
 which you've completed.
 The Twilight Princess.
 Yes, I have.
 Yes.
 And then we had a nice long day.
 It felt like we had a date all day.
 We did.
 Went to lunch, went to the movies, came home.
 And then Saturday was fun.
 By fun, I mean, lots of...
 Well, it was fun, but it was lots of hard work.
 Well, it was funny because you thought this was like a two or three hour thing.
 And it turned out being a seven hour thing.
 I was like, "Okay, bye!"
 Basically, a friend of mine is purchasing a sauna.
 Or I should say upgrading a sauna.
 and had asked do you want the old sauna i'm like yeah is that even a question never even thought
 about having sauna but it's not like a it's not like a finish water sauna with rocks or anything
 yeah it's not something you set fire to burn coals and throw water on is an infrared sauna yeah
 but it's made out of cedar and it's kind of like having for anybody who's from
 uh britain you'll remember like little garden sheds it's like having a little cedar garden shed
 inside your house that has infrared heaters in the middle of it.
 And so I actually, the reason I'm so relaxed as all our listeners can probably tell, like,
 Hey, Alan, why are you so relaxed?
 Why is your skin glowing?
 That would be because I just had a sauna session and it was amazing.
 Yeah, they're really wondering about why your skin is going for sure.
 I also had a needle incident.
 I try and give myself vitamin B shots once a week.
 And I kind of have to work myself up to it because nobody really likes to stab themselves
 with a needle, even though it doesn't really hurt.
 So I went for it and just, you know, quick job, well, it didn't really work.
 So then I tried it again.
 Still didn't really work.
 And I thought, I don't know what's going on, but this really hurts.
 And then I realized that the tip was kind of broken off of the needle.
 So I was like, well, what did you do?
 I like I depress the plunger thing and put it into the sink so that I could put it in with the rest of my needle in the casement thing.
 So you didn't get to use it.
 You just basically just threw it out and then I got a new one and that one went in first time, but I kind of mangled my tummy a little bit.
 I didn't feel good for a little bit.
 Poor tummy.
 Poor tummy.
 Let's end with that trauma.
 And then Sunday today, we went to church and Pastor Jeff just did a great job of like asking us to pause for a second and consider some of the things that's happened in our church.
 Babe, were you aware that we've had five deaf ears open in the last four weeks?
 I was aware. Isn't that awesome?
 And then our friend, Dabney.
 This is an amazing story.
 If you follow me on Instagram, you would have seen the Instagram story, but our friend, Dabney, broke both of her ankles, which is never good.
 like breaking one ankle.
 One of her ankles had a four inch break in it.
 The other ankle, I don't know how severe it was,
 but both of them, you know, X-rays, broken ankles,
 can't stand on them in a wheelchair.
 And six days later, she's standing up, no pain.
  </li><li>They've taken the cast off.
  </li><li>She's, yeah, so she was testifying this morning,
 just kind of wandering around and like,
 oh, yeah, this is what that was.
 And then David Wagner gave an amazing word of knowledge
 last week about somebody who sells within sales,
 being healed and somebody who was watching online was watching that, realized it was them
 went to the daughter and founder cancer had been healed.
 Well, and their whole family like that person went, "Oh my gosh, what he's describing that's
 me," right?
 And then their whole family that was there was like, "That's you!" and he stood up for
 receiving it online.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Amazing.
 So Jeff was just saying, "Hey, are you aware that all this stuff is happening in our church?
 Do you know that we should at least pause and say, "That's amazing," rather than just
 goes through it and I was like, yeah, that's absolutely amazing.
 So I forgot to mention we had lunch with Mr. Will from England, one of our dear friends
 and a big supporter of the podcast show.
 He was in town for the conference and deceased brother who's on the school.
 And it's such a highly relational week.
 It was.
 It was a great week.
 And then today we had all our small group leaders back for, well, not all of them,
 but many of our small group leaders back for Taco lunch, which was just delicious.
 Yeah.
 Blue Coast burrito dude love it knocked out the board. Oh, they do their catering is amazing. Yeah, fantastic. Yeah, all right
 Our main topic for this week is all about hearing God's voice
 Hey, just skip that number
 That's ding it. Oh, please don't die. I don't want to finish the podcast on my own
 Come out fell spirit. Are you better? Yeah, you're welcome. Our main topic this week is all about hearing God's voice
 It's actually the very first thing this topic is what we teach on the school if you come to school supernatural life
 Very first week we teach it's all about hearing God's voice. We've actually done this before I think episode 18
 Which was a long long time ago. We talked about the human God's voice
 I can't remember what we said on that episode because I didn't listen to it
 We just know we talked about it.
 Right.
 But obviously our relationship is better when we can hear the voice of the one we're in relationship with.
 But talk to me, Mrs. Jones, about your journey into hearing God's voice.
 How it all began for you.
 How it all began for me.
 That's a good question.
 I think I didn't even really realize that I was hearing God until somebody else pointed it out.
 And I didn't know about journaling or the way that we teach hearing God's voice now until probably a couple of years later.
 So I would say probably I entered into more of the prophetic than of hearing God's voice.
 Does that make sense?
 Like more makes sense to me, but might not make sense to our listeners to explain, explain yourself, woman.
 I would, I will.
 I would hear stuff for other people, occasionally hear stuff for me, but I didn't know that I could
 just sit down and have a conversation with the Lord and that he would talk to me about stuff.
 I was completely unaware of that until I did Mark Verkler's hearing God's voice.
 Yeah, God bless Mark Verkler. We'll talk about him in a second.
 Yeah.
 So when you said you could hear God's voice, but you didn't know you were hearing God's voice
 till other people pointed out you were hearing God's voice. Say that five times. What do you mean
 by that?
 Well, I mean, I just meant I would know stuff about people, that sort of thing. And then I started...
 All sounds really impersonal though. Sounds like you were gathering bits of data rather than
 hearing God speak to you.
 Well, it felt very random.
 And then I started getting training with the prophetic team before I actually ever did
 the Hearing God's Voice course.
 So again, you're getting information from the Lord to give to someone else.
 But the thing with Hearing God's voice is its information and relationship that is just
 between you and God for you, which is totally different.
 So talk to me about today, 2018.
 What's it like for AJ Jones to hear the voice of God?
 Great.
 Good.
 All right.
 Next question.
 I can hear his voice as often as I stop to sit down and journal with him and have a
 conversation.
 I think you can find that's my line and you just stole it blatantly from beneath my
 feet.
 I'm so sorry.
 No, it's okay.
 I'll take it back.
 But again, what does that mean?
 So I had somebody ask me yesterday, great question.
 They said, "You know, we often hear you in your sermons or when you're talking, say,
 "And then the Lord said to me, 'What is it like when the Lord says stuff to you?'"
 Describe that. If we were inside your head, how do you hear the voice of God for you?
 I would say generally it sounds a lot like my own voice, but it's a lot kinder. And typically,
 he just starts speaking about things before I've asked a question.
 So you mean you hear a voice?
 Yes, internally.
 Internally.
 Yes.
 and how do you know you're not just making up.
 That's a this is a great question.
 How do I know I'm not just making it up well track record maybe.
 [laughter]
 I was open for a.
 [laughter]
 A slightly more robust answer than that.
 But yes.
 Okay.
 [laughter]
 No, I'm worried you're making up.
 [laughter]
 I'm just realizing I'm super tired.
 Go ahead.
 Yes, no, I'm not making it.
 How do I know?
 Well, I mean, it's interesting.
 The Lord has never told me anything that disagrees with scripture.
 It's changed.
 Yeah.
 And you often doesn't tell you stuff that that, for example, my observation of your
 life and your history with the Lord is he never tells you things that help you
 win arguments.
 He never tells you things that forwards your agenda, like that just slowly
 benefits you.
 And he never tells you anything that exalts you over others.
 Yes, I would agree with all of that, but he also does tell me things that I can't believe are possibly going to be true.
 Like in terms of encouraging me and talking to me about, you know, destiny or things that he's going to do or.
 Yeah, but what I meant by that, sorry, I should probably clarify.
 Yeah.
 The fruit of the words aren't there to puff you up.
 No, never.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And it doesn't I I've never heard the Lord confirm your biases.
 I've heard the Lord correct your biases.
 Mm hmm.
 What does the Lord do with your biases?
 Well, I have none.
 So that's interesting.
 Yeah.
 That helps greatly.
 I was just thinking about how I know it's the Lord.
 I think your right is experience.
 Hebrews 5 14 says it's by constant use.
 The mature learn to distinguish good from evil.
 So the more you do it, the more you test it, you know, you get an understanding
 of when when you are off, when you are making things up, or when you think
 you're hearing God, but you're really not. But it is experience, but also understanding
 God's nature is hugely important. Understanding his nature's character as revealed in the
 word of God. He never says it in the contradict scripture. He'll never contradict scripture,
 but he's happy to contradict my understanding of scripture. That's always fun. But also
 all of his thoughts, to me, are way gentler than my own thoughts.
 Yeah, much kinder.
 Yeah, way kinder.
 But he does speak.
 People ask all the time, you know, what does God's voice sound like?
 And I say God's voice sounds like my voice to me.
 Because he speaks in first person, but it does.
 But it feels different, doesn't it?
 Like it's like there's a feeling or a peace that comes with it.
 Even when he's talking to you about hard things, there's like this, you know,
 the presence of the Lord kind of comes at the same time as the talking.
 Right.
 Well, sometimes for me, it doesn't.
 Sometimes for me, it's a bit like Jeff is talking about Moses and the burning bush that
 Moses spotted the burning bush, went over to see what is this bush that burns, and then
 God spoke to him.
 Sometimes God speaking to me, I have to do a double take because I'm like, wait, Lord,
 I think that was you.
 And then I kind of leave my train of thought, join the train of thought that just passed
 through my head and go, is that you?
 And then the presence comes and at that point, that makes sense?
  </li><li>I split in tears for lunch.
  </li><li>No, yeah, no, that's fine.
 That makes sense.
 I would say I most often,
 that sort of scenario happens for me most often
 when I'm driving, when all of a sudden the alert
 will just be like, well, or I'll have the thought of,
 hey, get off the highway here.
 Or, hey, go and do this.
 And I'm like, okay.
 And almost, you know, sometimes I have no idea why I did it.
 And if I was avoiding traffic or not,
 but sometimes I found out later,
 oh, wow, I wouldn't stuck in traffic
 or whatever the thing is.
 Those are the ones where I'm like,
 oh, I hear what feels like a random piece of information.
 And then go back to say, Lord, is this you?
 I mean, are you saying get off here?
 Or is this just a random thought?
  </li><li>I think it's interesting that one of them
 is Nomers that I had was that God speaking to me
 would always be at his initiative.
 As in, I'm just a passive recipient of God
 when he chooses to speak.
 If God chooses to speak to me in a dream, in a vision, then there's not much I can do
 to get him talking.
 I just wait for a message from heaven.
 Help for the best.
 I realized that is completely false.
 I realized that probably the number of times that God has spoken to me uninitiated, like
 I'm minding my own business and all of a sudden his voice interrupts my day, is easily
 less than I can count on two hands in my whole life.
 But in terms of how often I hear God's voices, literally every time I sit down to speak to
 him, in the book of James, I've drawn near to God and he'll draw near to you.
 If I will initiate a conversation with the Lord, I will hear him speak back.
 Like if I literally just sit down and just say, "Father, what do you want to say to
 me today?"
 Boom, I'll instantly hear his voice.
 Well, it's kind of like if MJ were just to hide in his room all day and not ask for
 conversation, he would get a lot less input.
 But if he comes down and tries to talk to you,
 it's not like you're gonna ignore him.
 You're gonna be like, hey, son, you know?
 So anyway.
  </li><li>I think for both of us,
 I'm just speaking for both of us,
 assuming you'll correct me if I'm wrong.
  </li><li>Maybe.
  </li><li>Probably the revelation that Mark Verkler gave us
 in his keys, four keys to hearing God's voice
 is the bedrock or the foundation
 of how we hear God's voice on a day to day basis.
 I'm not talking about dreams and visions
 and when we do prophetic ministry,
 I just mean in our own personal what with God,
 Dr. Marv Verkler's four keys
 is the foundational way we hear God's voice.
  </li><li>I concur.
  </li><li>Talk to our listeners about the four keys
 ever so briefly because again,
 we spend a week teaching this,
 but talk to us about the four keys
 and what they mean to you.
  </li><li>Okay, so the four keys to hearing God's voice
 as taught by Mark Verkler are,
 the first one is quiet yourself down,
 which just means find a peaceful space,
 sort of quiet your heart down,
 just get yourself into a good place to hear
 and to rest and receive.
  </li><li>Right, 'cause peace is the potting soil of revelation.
 Very hard to hear God if all your anxious thoughts
 are competing with the airtime for him.
  </li><li>Right.
 The next one is fix your eyes on Jesus.
 And that's just, you know, look for what Jesus is doing
 in the room or have a visual of what Jesus is doing.
 Now explain that one because that just sounds weird.
 Why don't you explain that?
 Okay, fine.
 I received that volley.
 Um, number 12 verse six says that God loves to speak to his
 prophets through dreams and visions.
 So God's first language is not English.
 So I had to learn the way God speak rather than demand that he
 speak the way I hear.
 So I speak in here in English and I just expected God would speak to me in English.
 Sometimes he does, but more often he speaks to me through imagery, what I mean by imagery,
 thoughts, pictures, objects, a past through my mind. And you think about Jesus said that Jesus
 said nothing to the people without speaking to them in parables. So God loves imagery, parables,
 play on words, all that sort of stuff. So when we are fixing our eyes on Jesus, we're actually
 determining to look for the language that God speaks, which is vision.
 And so I start literally just by asking Jesus, "Where are you in the room?"
 I close my eyes and like a little child, I play hide and seek with Jesus like,
 "Lord, where are you in the room?" And usually in my mind's eye, I get a sense of where he is.
 I see a picture of Jesus, or it might be like a first person picture.
 I might look out and I just see Jesus. Usually more often than I see Jesus's face,
 right in front of my face with this incredible grin on his face and sparkling eyes and he's
 just so happy to be with me. Sometimes I have a third person image where I see myself wherever
 I'm sitting and I feel the father standing behind me with his hands on my shoulders and
 just feel this tremendous peace and joy. But yeah, I, that's step number two. I'm looking
 for vision, but before I do, I fix my eyes on Jesus, the author and professor of my faith.
 Number three is tune into spontaneity.
 So don't you dare volley that to me.
 Oh, it's coming right back at you.
 So that just means you're tuning into the flow of whatever it is that God might be doing.
 So whether that's the pictures that Alan was referring to or just his presence in the room,
 like you're just sort of getting connected and tuning into what he's doing, what he's saying.
 And usually at this point, I'm asking him a question.
 Like hello, Valor, like what do you want to say today?
 Like what's the most pressing thing on your heart for me today?
 And then I've written that down and I'm listening to what he will say.
 And more often than not, I will begin to hear a sentence fragment.
 I hear off to the right hand side of my headspace.
 So do I.
 Yeah, I'll just sit and I'll just begin to hear like somebody dictating an answer to me.
 And as long as I honor that and write it down, that flow continues.
 If I stop as I did when I was learning this gun, this is so dumb.
 I can't believe I'm just making this up.
 That voice just drives up.
 Yeah, but just fades away.
 Yeah.
 But if I will tune my attention to the flow that I hear,
 believing it's a flow from heaven, I'll stay with it.
 Yeah.
 Which leads us to key number four.
 Number four, which is writing it down.
 Write it down.
 So the reason you write it down is number one, so you can remember it.
 But more importantly, number two, you can test it.
 Because you're not just assuming second Corinthians 10 says we're to take every thought captive to Christ.
 So it's not that we're just assuming everything that pops to our head is the Lord.
 So we're going to write everything down so that we can test it later.
 We can test in a way like the New Testament tells us to test prophetic words or into way prophetic words.
 You want to hold on to the good, eat the meat and spit out the bones.
 So, you know, I'm at that point, I'm not weighing it.
 I'm just staying in the spontaneous flow and I'm writing everything down.
 And then afterwards I can sift through it or I can email it to AJ or Jeff and say,
 Hey, I was praying this morning and I felt like the Lord said, what do you think?
 And that those four steps we have done over and over and over and over for years
 and years and years, probably I've been doing that.
 I want to say for 15 years easily.
 Yeah, maybe 18 years.
 I can't remember when I learned.
 I know I.
 I can't either, but being as for we're approaching our 14 year
 anniversary, definitely at least 15.
 Yeah, if not more.
 Oh, yeah.
 And so I've got books filled with just journaling with the Lord.
 Like I could stop the podcast right now and I could just don't put up my journal
 and I could just start asking the Lord some questions and I'd hear from them.
 And the amazing thing, and I want to encourage you, if you only know us as
 people you listen to on a podcast is the danger that you think that's because it's us. It's not,
 it's because that's what he's like. He loves to speak to his children. Jesus himself said,
 "My sheep know my voice." If you are a believer in Jesus, you can absolutely hear his voice.
 In Job 33 verse 14, this is God does speak now one way, now another, the man does not perceive it.
 God's speaking all the time. The problem is that we don't perceive what he's saying because we have
 like kind of one dimension of the way he should speak. Yeah. Yeah.
 I'll put links to Mark Verkler's website where I there's got to be a
 video of him teaching that he's just a great teacher and a great tutor. But
 again, it's it's one of the things that we do as part of our devotion. It's
 something we've been doing for years and years and years. And the more you do
 it, the better you get at it. And it has two mile markers in my walk with
 the Lord, one praying out loud to Mark Verkler's four keys to hearing God's voice.
 Anything else you want to say about hearing God's voice?
 No, I think you covered it.
 I think the longer that you do it and the more that you practice it, the less it
 becomes like a mechanism and the more it's just an easy flow.
 So true.
 Add some flow to your life, people.
 Add some flow, baby.
 I'm going to pray for you for an impartation for me.
 Nope.
 No, for you.
 You got plenty of the stuff.
 I'm going to pray for our listeners for an impartation.
 for them. We're hearing God's voice. Lord Jesus, I thank you for the joy and the privilege of
 being able to hear your voice. I remember as a little boy desperately wanted to be able to hear
 your voice. I see that same hunger in my children and I thank you that it's not difficult. I thank
 you that you're not locked in far away. I thank you that hearing your voice is not reserved for
 prophets. It's reserved for your sons and daughters. And Lord, I'm praying right now for every person
 who's listening, that you would give them ears to hear and eyes to see what the Holy
 Spirit is saying, that you would revolutionize all of our walks with you, that you would
 draw close as you've promised to do is we'd run near to you, that you would run near to
 us, and that you would give us experience in hearing your voice.
 Not just in the four keys that we've talked about, but in dreams and in visions, that
 Lord, you would increase the prophetic in our lives, and Lord, that you would stir up
 And you would activate the prophets who are around us.
 So we might not even know.
 And Lord, I thank you that prophets are a gift
 to the body of Christ and that they train us
 up to full maturity.
 And so I'm asking Lord, even if there's people listening
 going, I'd love that.
 I don't even know any prophets, that you would send
 prophets to them.
 And even in their dreams, Lord, that you would have a body,
 a family of believers who know how to hear Papa's voice.
 And I thank you that you love to do that.
 Holy Spirit, I thank you that you love to make known.
 things that are known in heaven here on earth.
 And Jesus, I love that you said that we,
 your sheep can hear your voice.
 And so I'm asking Lord, especially for people
 who think they can't, people who disqualified themselves.
 Because that was my story.
 I just remember thinking, I can't hear your voice.
 It's fine for others, but not for me.
 And so we take authority over that lie right now
 in Jesus name and we speak open ears
 to everybody who's listening.
 Amen.
  </li><li>All right, well, we have a listeners question.
  </li><li>Go on.
  </li><li>So this is from Karen.
 And she says, "I was at the conference this weekend,
 and on Saturday night, while David Wagner
 was speaking, odd things began to happen.
 My sister and I left, but was wondering what was decided.
 Was this a manifestation of the Holy Spirit or of the devil?
 My sister and I talked about it, and we were mixed.
 We both felt the peaceful presence of the Holy Spirit,
 so there was not fear, but it was really intrusive.
 What did the pastors who have more knowledge and experience decide?
 I'm looking at you, pastor, with more knowledge and experience.
 What did you decide?
 I think it was God.
 I think it was the Holy Spirit just moving.
 There was a whole bunch of different things happening in the room, but it was not
 unlike when the revival started in Toronto in 94.
 So there was people that were sort of sporadically yelling things like holy and
 whatnot.
 Those were mostly youth.
 What was interesting about that is from my understanding, the youth that came were actually sort of the quietest youth in our group.
 They're very, very shy, quiet kids who got hit by the Holy Spirit really on the Saturday night and started making a whole bunch of noise, which would be completely out of character for them.
 There was some spontaneous deliverance going on as well.
 So there was some of that going on because, I mean, I'm not really worried about that either.
 when the Holy Spirit shows up, sometimes, you know,
  </li><li>The demonic gets rattled.
  </li><li>The demonic gets rattled and then it leaves
 and we want it gone.
 So.
  </li><li>There was plenty of demonic activity at Jesus' meetings.
 Just a power encounter.
 So, you know, whenever demons show up,
 you wanna ask yourself, are they coming or are they going?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And hopefully they're going
 and I am speaking as a pastor.
 I'm not sure I've got more knowledge or experience
 but as a pastor, I love when the Holy Spirit shows up.
 know, if you know anything about grace in our, it's we will stop whatever we're doing
 to accommodate the Holy Spirit. And so we love when the Holy Spirit breaks in. And sometimes
 the Holy Spirit is broken in silence, like just led our congregation to just sit in silence
 because for a whole service. So sometimes God will have us wait in silence. Sometimes
 people will shout out it says in Scripture, you know, if you don't shout out the rocks
 will. So we're just preventing a natural phenomenon. Sometimes people are flailing
 I'm so happy in the presence of God.
 And that particular Saturday night at the conference,
 I had to drive one of our speakers home.
 I couldn't get back to the church fast enough
 because I didn't want to leave what the Holy Spirit was doing.
 So I love it.
 The Holy Spirit will stop at nothing
 to bring freedom to his children.
 Sometimes that freedom is really, really noisy.
 And so you were right.
 Yeah, there was demonic activity,
 but it wasn't that the devil was interrupting the service.
 was that the devil was being escorted from the service and he went quite nicely on that particular
 night. But yeah, lots of Holy Spirit activity. Yeah, I mean, there was people laughing, there's
 people crying. It was all sort of the things that I would expect when God shows up because he's an
 individual God and he's doing things in individuals. To some, he's releasing joy and it's bringing
 healing into other people. He's bringing their emotions online. So they're crying. And so
 It looks a little like chaos, but it's the best kind of chaos ever.
 I remember John Arnett saying you can choose the order of the cemetery or the order of the nursery.
 And if you go into a nursery like kindergarten, you know, there's it looks like chaos, but I promise you,
 there's somebody who knows everything that's going on and everything is running the way it's supposed to run.
 But it it looks a lot less organized than a cemetery with all of its stones in a row.
 You know, so I thought it was great.
 I thought Holy Spirit was doing amazing things.
 And I'm sure we're going to hear even more testimonies of what God has done than we have
 already.
 And Karen, it's a great question, really, really good question, really glad you asked
 a really important question to ask.
 And if you would like more information on things like that, we did an episode all on
 manifestations of the Holy Spirit.

 And we talk all about the odd things that you mentioned throughout church history and
 revival.
 And yeah, be super helpful to listen to.
 All right.
 Well, I think that's it, babe.
