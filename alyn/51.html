<p> ajjone yes sir how are you i love you i love it when you call me sir okay that's good.
 Tell me about this week it was a good week was that we had john and kirill here for a lot of the week and if you guys didn't get a chance to listen to their podcast last week.
 Stop doing those in their podcast and come back yes if you want to try boss you around.
 But kind of but kind of so we had them saying it's fun yes memories of when we used to live with them it was so good it was so chill.
 out. It was days filled with tech support and coffee, coffee and visioneering. Yes.
 In fact, we knew probably what it was going to be like. So we took Tuesday off of work
 and spent the day wandering around restaurants, coffee stores, Apple stores, downtown Franklin.
 He tried to get me to go to the Tesla store. He did. Which was an exercise in futility.
 Yes. Because I don't have $80,000 to spend on an electric sports car. That is correct.
</p><ul>
  <li>Did we eat anywhere special with them?
  </li><li>We went to graze.
 Went to-- - The Cheesecake Factory.
  </li><li>Cheesecake Factory.
 We sat out on the patio with the Cheesecake Factory,
 such a nice meal.
  </li><li>It was gorgeous to get a view
 of the Cool Springs car park.
 I mean, that's electric.
 You can't buy a view like that.
  </li><li>I mean, yeah, those fords and, you know,
 cries, lures, wow.
  </li><li>Am I gonna haircut?
  </li><li>You did get a haircut.
 Do you like it?
  </li><li>Yeah, I do.
 Haircuts are a source of friction in my life.
 Like, just gonna have to get a haircut, so hassle.
 You think that you getting a haircut like takes a lot of time?
 Mine isn't a hassle.
 I really enjoy it, but it takes a long time.
 Yeah.
 I don't enjoy it when you go away for a weekend.
 Like you're like, I want to get my haircut
 and you're like camping supplies.
 I see money.
 And I'm like for the kids for four days.
 But I have fantastic hair.
 But last year, you do.
 Last year, I bought 12 months worth of haircuts in advance.
 You did without checking with me.
 You were so stupid.
 But I'm actually really glad I did it.
 And here's why. Well, it just removes the what's one less friction step and getting your haircut
 But I'm not convinced that you go often enough that you've made it worth the amount of money we spent
 They never end. Oh, you have a certain amount of them rather than a years. Yeah, yeah, yeah
 They give you 12 haircuts. Oh, and I'm getting my haircut every month. Although I probably should
 because my hair grows ridiculously long. I kind of like it when it's like fluffy and carefree.
 Really? No. I didn't think you thought that. I just thought it'd be funny to say.
 I really like that shirt on you. Forget it.
 But the big event this week, yes, well, there was a couple of Mother's Day today. Mother's Day
 Mother's Day in America for our UK listeners. You might be like, what? Mother's Day here. Yes,
 And in Canada. Is it? Did you call your mother? Not yet. Wow, there's still plenty of time.
 I know, right? I mean, she's not going to bed until like three in the morning.
 I'm going to cook those pork chops first. My mother likes to stay up late and usually eat pork
 at strange hours. We got loads of time. We should redeem that description of your mother.
 Yes. There's amazing things to say about your mom. The fact that she stays up late and eats
 pork at about midnight while true is not the most amazing thing we could say. It's true.
 It's one of her eccentricies. Is that how you did? I don't know. I don't speak anything.
 Accentric.
 Accentric.
 Please.
 Well, let's just go with that. Third time's the charm. Make your words. So we had Mother's
 Day and then our good friends and the former producer of the show. Yes. Blake's friend
 and Elena Williams got engaged, which were very, very excited.
 We're so excited.
 And we get to do the wedding.
 Yes, we're so excited.
 I know, I'm very excited.
 I don't know if you saw my Instagram, you may or may not have,
 but Blake and Elena surreptitiously dropped off a box of donuts
 from $5 Bakery.
 They did.
 Which, you know, if you give me five donuts,
 I'll pretty much do anything that's legal or borderline legal,
 to be honest.
 And they were so sweetly just said,
 you know, we'd be honored if you'd do our wedding.
 And what they don't know was the day before I had just said to AJ, you know, Blake and
 Elena getting married is so awesome.
 I kind of secretly hope that they ask us to do the wedding.
 And then the very next day they sent us a beautiful card.
 So congratulations guys.
 You're amazing.
 We're so excited.
 And possibly the cute couple in the world.
 Oh, they're so adorable.
 They're absolutely.
 And he was wearing a bow tie the other night.
 She was wearing that cute little kind of 50s classic.
 Oh, stunners.
 Audrey Hepburn kind of looking thing.
 Guys you don't need to worry i've already full shot what your children look like and they look amazing they're fantastic yeah.
 The world wearing both eyes.
 What are the topic people get engaged the other big family had to get a wedding we did john and hope got married.
 Which was fantastic is beautiful on this private farm and there's a donkey that.
 All the time it was that loud it's true.
 It was worth during the rehearsal and it was at the wedding.
 He only made that noise once and it was when the music was on.
 It was just during worship, just three intimate times of praise in Jesus and a donkey just
 just...
 It would have been way worse if the worship wasn't happening though.
 Louder?
 No?
 I thought it was sent of drowned out.
 Anyway, it was a great wedding.
 It was fantastic.
 Very, very beautiful.
 And then the reception and everything was there as well in the barn.
 And astonishingly good food.
 Really good food.
 You know, wedding food is heteromisk, because it's hard to provide excellent food for hundreds
 of guests.
 Right.
 But my gosh, was that amazing exceptional food?
 It was really good.
 Yeah.
 And then the dancing was good.
 I had left by then.
 I know.
 What's my golden rule for being at weddings?
 Eat and leave.
 Oh, is that on it?
 That's nicely summarized.
 Bring another car so you can leave and I can stay and be social.
 Except for me, minus eat, dance, party the night away and then leave.
 Yeah, BCM.
 Not a good dancer.
 That is not true.
 You are a good dancer.
 I think you've been smoking drugs, true or false?
 Not true.
 I think you can groove.
 You're inner groove.
 It just needs to come out.
 Do you remember when we did ballroom dancing lessons together?
 Yeah, was your crazy idea fostering intimacy in marriage?
 Yeah, who would want that?
 No, I want the industry in marriage.
 I just don't want to be forced to go to the middle of a move.
 Well, the worst thing about ballroom dancing lessons, despite the fact we had
 an amazing ballroom dance teacher, is the room is surrounded in mirrors.
 So you look utterly foolish the whole time.
 I mean, there's very few men that look good doing the Fox Drop.
 I disagree. I think men that can ballroom dance very handsome.
 That's your key. My point is there's very few men who can actually ballroom dance.
 But if you do lessons, you could.
 I give both a very slow process with a miniscule reward of even being one of those people who can
 look good doing it.
 Babe, I think the Tony would agree that you learned very quickly.
 See, I think you're so encouraging. Your equal parts encouraging and delusional.
 I loved their ballroom dancing lessons. They were fun.
 So given that we've been, we're sort of in this season of weddings, we have another one in two
 weeks time that we're super excited about and the one that was yesterday and then one in a couple
 of months, we thought we might talk about getting hitched and marriage and just little bits of advice
 and musings. Muse away. I shall muse. Well, we, as we were preparing for yesterday,
 for a john and hopes we often think, you know, first of all, there's not much point in giving an
 actual sermon at a wedding. Well, like giving the address. Yes. The bride and groom. Yes, because
 they hear you like Charlie Brown's teacher. They're not, you know, they're not going to
 remember a thing unless it's been. I don't remember what John and Carol said hours.
 I don't either. I remember that he poked you in the stomach or in the chest with the microphone
 and you started manifesting.
 I thought I was going to fall over.
 Yeah.
 Well, I think what was the funniest part for me
 was at the end of our wedding is you thought you hadn't manifested.
 And when you look at the video, you're like--
 No, I knew I'd manifest.
 I just didn't think it was that noticeable.
 Oh, it was--
 No.
 Yeah, but to your point, I don't remember
 saying John Carroll said.
 Yeah.
 And I think if we'd go back and ask all the people
 who've done weddings for it, they
 wouldn't have a clue what we said.
 They won't remember.
 So really, you're talking to the married people that are sitting
 you're sort of reminding them, "Hey, this is what you were doing when you stood up here."
 And probably to the single people, "Hey, this is what marriage is about because you're not going to retain whatever you get on your day."
 Right.
 Don't you figure?
 What were the things that we say?
 Well, we kept it pretty short. We did five. Didn't we? Did five little pieces?
 You said, "Yeah, marriage is designed to kill you." You could hear everybody go, "Wait, are we at wedding or funeral?"
 Why is she starting with something negative?
 But that's the truth.
 It is the truth. It's designed, you know, well, they say it's designed to
 grind, but maybe are we ever designed to grind in more ways than one. But it does it. You see all
 the things in you that you wish were not there because they come up because you're living in somebody
 else's space the whole time. See, I don't think that's what happens. I think it takes a wise person
 to realize that it's your stuff coming up. I think when you're immature in your marriage,
 when I like so I remember being frustrated you for X and I remember thinking,
 oh, this isn't my problem.
 This is a jade problem.
 If she just stopped doing X, I wouldn't get angry.
 So I'm the wise one in this scenario?
 Well, I'm pretty sure you thought the same thing, but flipped.
 And I mean, it doesn't until later dawn on you that you're like, Oh,
 actually, I could just change my behavior.
 So their behavior no longer works on me.
 Yes.
 I think it's only like a year six.
 You realize, Oh, all my nagging hasn't changed this person.
 Therefore, I need to find a better solution.
 But I think it's kind of both and.
 You come into marriage and you both have stuff.
 No, no, no.
 I totally agree with what you're saying.
 I'm just saying the perception of the dynamic.
 I don't think you get married and think, man, I'm really messed up.
 Gosh, I'm overreacting to all these things my wife is innocently doing.
 I think you think, man, if only my wife wouldn't do x, then I wouldn't get angry.
 But the issue isn't whether you're doing x or not.
 The issue is whether I have an anger problem.
 Yes, but I do remember thinking, gosh, I never realized I was this selfish.
 Like whenever it would come down to making a plan for anything, I realized, I'm,
 I'm really used to running my life.
 That's true too.
 Yeah.
 And so I, I was having like for the first year,
 continual revelations of how selfish I am in terms of, I want to be able to do
 what I want to do and I want you to do what I want to do, which is selfishness.
 Yeah, you were so selfish.
 Thanks, baby.
 I was so patient.
 really. So what's the solution to marriage design to kill you?
 Well, it's the solution is to go after your own stuff. And I think we practice, we said,
 practice self change instead of spouse change. So deal with your own stuff. And then let God
 take care of your spouse. I remember Chester Kilt for saying to us or saying to me, Alan,
 if you don't like the wife you have, change the way you treat her.
 Yeah.
 It was brilliant.
 It is brilliant.
 All right. What was number two?
 Number two was your point, so I can't remember.
 Oh, yeah. Number two was the brilliant line from Chip Judd.
 Remember he said the goal of marriage is to see who can out serve the other.
 Yeah. Make your marriage about who can out serve the other.
 You made a great point when we were talking about this. You said serving one another
 keeps the focus on the right person in the marriage.
 Yeah.
 That's brilliant.
 Thanks.
 Would you go get me a cup of sweet tea?
 Sure, baby.
 Right after we're done this podcast.
 See, you're such a good server.
 Thanks.
 That was a test.
 Number three was Jeff Dollar's killer line.
 Yes.
 It was he who apologizes first wins.
 There's a little bit of an emphasis on he there, darling.
 Well, I must have been the Holy Spirit because I didn't mean to do that.
 Let's think of the individual.
 he or she who of all sizes first wins.
 And that's not to the would you rather be right or have relationship?
 Yeah.
 I'd rather have both and I'd rather be right and have relationship.
 Right.
 But that's not that wasn't really behind door number one or two.
 Stupid wisdom.
 Number four.
 Number four was the whole thing about.
 You know, often when we're doing marriage canceling with people, it's usually
 the complaint is I'm not getting my needs met.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like I have rights and they're not being met.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And to be sure there are rights
 and there are responsibilities in scripture
 laid out for a good marriage.
  </li><li>Right, but thinking in terms of rights
 is down to selfishness again.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
 So it's that whole thing of, you know,
 why submit to your husband?
 And husbands love your wife as Christ loved the church.
 So for a man, it's your quote, unquote, right to have your wife submit to you.
 Right.
 And for a woman, it's your quote, unquote, right to be loved like Christ loves the
 church.
 But actually, we don't get the demand that we get a right.
 That's, that's appropriate for a two year old who stands for fist down.
 That's correct.
 Or stands for foot down.
 And even then they'd end up on the naughty stair.
 They would.
 Yeah.
 And the goal is actually, let's forget whether I'm having a wife that
 submits to me and let me just focus on whether I'm loving her, like Christ loves the church.
 Right.
 That whole verse about, you know, wife's submit to your husband is interesting because the
 verse preceding it says submit yourself one to another.
 Right.
 Number five, what was your fifth point?
 It was about three quarters.
 Three corded strand.
 We talked about, is it from Ecclesiastes 4 verse 2, where it says a cord of three strands
 cannot be broken.
 about keeping Jesus in the center of your marriage, that there's you, there's your spouse, and there's Jesus.
 And if you spend time on your relationship with God, that is time spent well on your marriage,
 because it will strengthen your marriage.
 All right, it's got some questions for you.
 Okay.
 They have nothing to do with marriage or relationships.
 Oh, okay.
 Brandon said, "I feel like I'm stepping into the role or ministry of a prophet,
 but I'm not having the hesitation I hear that you guys and most other people have,
 Is that a good thing? Does it mean anything? How do I begin to navigate those waters?
 Gosh, I guess I'd have a bunch of questions about that. It sort of depends on how you're defining the role of a prophet
 and what you mean by you're stepping into it or other people calling you into it and calling you up to it or
 Bear in mind. We don't know you know your situation. We don't know your church background. So we're speaking entirely theoretically and so
 Take what's helpful and throw with rest. I like to rely on the wisdom that I heard from jonple Jackson
 He said if you have to tell people what you are people will never believe you
 But if other people tell you what you are you'll never be able to convince them otherwise
 So in my life, I have only met a
 handful of people
 Who knew at the outset that were called to prophetic ministry and actually are?
 the rest of the people I know who are in prophetic ministry kind of had to be called into even some of the most amazing prophets
 I know
 It was kind of a wrestling struggle
 And I don't think the rest on the struggle as a prerequisite for prophetic ministry
 But what I've noticed is a lot of people along my life's journey who have introduced themselves to me as hi
 I'm a prophet really or not
 there
 People maybe with a genuine prophetic gift
 But for example in the six years I've been at Grey Center. We've had probably four or five people
 Who've shown up at Grey Center and announced that they are God sent into Grey Center as a prophet and
 we're like well
 Maybe he has but could we at least get to know you and usually these people are
 Incredibly reckless
 They haven't had a strong track record in their prophetic gifting fairly wounded
 But you're fairly wounded, you know, could probably do with some help.
 So my advice in any sort of ministry, forget prophetic ministry is, in Proverbs it says
 "A gift makes way for it to give or an ushers them into the presence of the great."
 Well that means is your gift will make room for you.
 So a lot of the prophets I know they just got on with being something other than being a
 prophet and their gift, their anointing made room for themselves.
 So congratulations, like if you're not wrestling with a call, if you're not frustrated with
 a call, that's brilliant.
 There's a huge difference between the call and the commission, however.
 I think it was John Sanford that said, on average, it takes about 14 years for a profit
 to mature into their calling.
 Like that sucks.
 I remember reading that and thinking, are you kidding?
 It's going to take 14 years before I'm going to move into what I feel like God's calling
 me into.
 I remember the first time I met Gary Morgan, who is one of our dear friends, and a really
 well recognized prophet in many different nations.
 I met him for the first day and he was an enigma to me because he was someone who was
 clearly anointed but didn't wrestle with any of the baggage of being anointed.
 I'd spent a couple of hours with him, I asked him every question I could think of.
 As we were leaving the restaurant, I pulled him aside and quietly said, "Hey, do you
 wrestle with the thought that you're a prophet. He's like, no, I'm totally ease with that.
 I said, but do you understand your call, your sphere of influence, your dimension? He's like,
 no, I just, I'm content to be, you know, minister of the heart of God to everyone I
 meet. And I remember Isabelle Alom, another great prophet, just an amazing mom in the
 faith and a dear friend of our somebody we greatly respect. She said, don't worry about
 whether you're a prophet or not. Just exercise your gift and your gift will take you where
 you need to go. Find a great place to serve and don't be preoccupied. Not that I get from
 your question or your preoccupied. So please don't hear me say that. But resist the temptation
 to prove that you're a prophet.
 And resist the temptation to promote yourself. Let other people promote you.
 Your gift will absolutely make room for you. You just can't hide your gifting. I just
 even remember in my old church that we didn't have space for prophetic ministry. We didn't
 recognize, you know, apostolic prophetic ministry at all. I was just completely hidden. I wasn't
 walking in my gift per se. I mean, I was having dreams and I was having visions and a lot of
 speaking to me privately. And then one day, one of the elders in my church, you know,
 really one of the pastors in the church came up to me and just said, "Hey, what do you think God's
 called you to?" And I was thinking, "Man, if you knew what God's called me to, you'd kick me
 out of your church. And yet the Lord just said, "Well, why don't you just trust your
 leaders and just open up your heart and tell them what you think?" And so I'm, you know,
 really, really shy and thinking, "This is never going to work." But in doing so, you know, as they
 approached me and said, "What do you think God's called you to?" And I began sharing the inklings
 of my heart. You know, they confirmed it to me. They're like, "Hey, we don't know much about what
 you're talking about, but we do know that you love Jesus and we do know that you hear his voice."
 I was huge for a church that traditionally was steeped in cessationism.
 By all means, just thank God that you have clarity and direction, but there's so much more to
 being a prophet than prophesy. I would really encourage you to work on those things, work on
 things like people skills, working with leaders, not being weird. It's weird enough that you know
 that you can't plug in people's hearts. Yeah, get plugged in. Don't be a loose cannon,
 because that's the kind of stuff that gives the prophetic a bad name too. So get plugged in.
 And if there's anything that God's talking to you about in terms of your heart and things that
 He's going after, deal with them real quick so that your filter's clean and ready to go.
 And then also get lots of training from lots of different streams.
 Yeah.
 I hope that helps. And I hope you're taking comfort that we don't actually know you. So if
 we've said anything that has hurt your feelings, I'm so sorry that wasn't our intent at all.
 it wasn't.
 All right, darling, some closing thoughts.
 Closing thoughts.
 We have more conference this weekend.
 So excited, Graham Cook and Jonathan David and Melissa Houser coming to lead worship.
 It's going to be amazing.
 It's going to be amazing.
 I appreciate this is only going to apply to a small subsection of our listeners to forgive
 me.
 But if you're planning on coming to the conference we're really looking forward to seeing you,
 we have sold two different types of tickets, main auditorium ticket holders.
 They are completely sold out.
 seat guarantee you a seat in the main auditorium provided you are there on time. If you have
 not taken your seat 15 minutes before each session starts, your seat will be given away
 to somebody who is waiting in standby. To be eligible to be on our standby list, you
 need to have a video overflow ticket. That ticket guarantees you a seat in our video overflow
 rooms but also makes you eligible to wait in line for standby seats should some people
 not show up for their main auditorium seats. If you can't join us in person, we will be
 streaming the sessions live. If you go to musthavemore.com, you can find out how to sign up for that
 process. And we are really, really looking forward to this conference. It's going to
 be amazing. It's going to be fantastic. One other closing thought is next week will be
 our 52nd episode of Keeping Up With The Joneses. Amazing. That means we will have been podcasting
 for a year. Wow. We should do something fun. Like what? I don't know. Some sort of giveaway
 or some sort of something.
 Okay, let's think of something guy next week.
 All right, well, we hope you have an incredible week.
