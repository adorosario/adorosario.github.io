<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is jones yes we're back we are for episode one eighty seven.
 We're this week we're talking about nothing that's right absolutely nothing as we're exhausted not true we are tired but we're not talking about nothing.
 Yes. We thought we haven't been here for two weeks because last week we're away, which we'll talk about in a second.
 So it's been a two week break. We're glad to be back in your ear holes.
 That sounds weird. That does sound weird.
 We're glad to be back in your ears.<br/>
 We're glad that you're listening to us again after a two week hiatus. How about that? That's better.
 And we have this new rule. We haven't talked about this.
 We have this new rule where we're getting up at six o'clock in the morning,
 which means we need to be in bed by 10.
 Yes. And it's now 8.35 when we record this.
 And I'm thinking if we record a normal talky talky one,
 there's going to be a ton of editing, which means I won't be in bed by 10,
 which means I won't be up by six, which means our new game plan of being up super early.
 A six super early.<br/>
 No, that's probably not super early for a lot of people, but we're not particularly
 morning people.<br/>
 So six feels pretty early to me.<br/>
 Your chef, I'm loving getting up at six.
 OK, I feel like speak for you, darling.
 I feel like getting up early is my superpower.
 I remember I used to have a job when I was like thirteen thirteen years old I had a job where I would get up I think.
 Maybe around five in the morning and I'd go open a paper shop at like sometime between five thirteen six is the one where you eight candy all day long all day long.
 I would just work down the left side of the candy store and this is leaving.
 I'd work down the other side, but I used to love it.
 I mean, I would either cycle to work or walk to work or when it got snowy,
 my boss had come and put me up.<br/>
 But being awake at five o'clock in the morning, five thirty and walking around
 the neighborhood, I felt like I had a superpower.
 I was up before anybody else and it gave me a great start in the day.
 By the end of the night, not so good.<br/>
 But first thing in the morning, I love it.
 I'm really enjoying being up early.<br/>
 Oh, good.<br/>
 I have a technical question for you before we go into our catch up of two weeks.
 Go for it.<br/>
 What's your technical question?<br/>
 Should the microphone be sending little shocks into my face while I'm speaking on it?
 That's my new thing that I have that when you're like drifting off, I just zap you.
 How's it working?<br/>
 Well, yes, it's keeping me wide awake.
 Very good.<br/>
 Excellent.<br/>
 Well, it's been two weeks.<br/>
 The reason we weren't here last week was we were driving back from St.
 Louis, where we did a men's weekend and took a bunch of women.
 It's true. We did. Yes. It was the first men's weekend or men's retreat that I ever spoke at.
 Right. We've been at this church in St. Louis for how many years? Six, seven?
 Well, I think yes. I think I've been going for eight now or something like that.
 Yeah. And traditionally you've done the women's weekend. I've done the men's weekend.
 We've both done the youth retreats, which is funny. And this year they were like,
 "Hey, Ellen, would you come back for the men's weekend?" But we want to do our men's weekend
 all about women because we just realized our men don't know how to connect with their wives or
 their daughters or their girlfriends or their mothers etc etc. But would you and AJ come and
 teach it together and we were like yes and then you had a dream that's your cue to speak sorry
 I forgot to shock you let me try that again and then you had a dream. Yes I did. And what was the
 dream about? Well because we were praying about whether to go and do the retreat just because of
 of it being in March and school for the kids and all that kind of stuff.
 And by the time we get to March, we're pretty exhausted.
 We don't start recovering from the school until late May.
 So we were praying about that and I had a dream that in the dream, the Holy Spirit showed
 up while we were speaking at the retreat.
 So I woke up and I was like, babe, I think we're supposed to go.
 I was more thinking that in a dream, we took six people with us, three women and three
 men.<br/>
 Was that in the dream?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 three couples. Hey, do you write down your dream? I don't. I have an idea. You should
 start writing your dreams. Anyway, because of a dream, we ended up taking six people
 with us three women, three men. And I loved it. I think you're right, babe. I think I
 did dream that. Yes. That's why I remembered it. I think that impacted me the most about
 the dream was that the Holy Spirit had shown up. But anyway, yeah, I was more logistical.
 So what I loved on the Saturday night, we had a panel of women answering questions from
 men about women.<br/>
 I heard they just killed it.<br/>
 I thought it was amazing.<br/>
 It was really fun.<br/>
 Yeah, you had had them text in and they could text anonymously whatever questions they had.
 And so we answered maybe 10 questions or something like that, which was really fun.
 I loved it though.<br/>
 I love those guys.<br/>
 Those guys are amazing.<br/>
 It's such a great church.<br/>
 Was it funny getting to meet the husbands of the wives that you've missed?
 It was so fun.
</p><ul>
  <li>So fun.
 It was so fun being able to sort of connect the dots
 and be like, oh, yeah, it was so fun.
  </li><li>And then we got to take our kids with us as well,
 which they love it.
  </li><li>They do.
  </li><li>Yeah, if we could do more in ministry with our kids,
 that would make travel way easier.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's great to bring them,
 'cause then you don't miss them.
 They don't feel like they're missing out.
  </li><li>And they love it.
  </li><li>I had a big conversation with Tia tonight
 as I put her to bed.
 She was like, "Daddy, what do you exactly do for a job?"
 (laughing)
 So she wasn't impressed with the title.
 So she said, what does that mean?
 What do you actually do on a day-to-day basis?
 So I told her and that just made her ask.
 She said, how do you know how to speak for so long?
 Like she's died listening to you
 and you spoke for like over an hour.
 How do you know what to say?
 And I was like, that's a great question.
 I said, I sit and ask the Holy Spirit
 and he tells me what to say.
 So then she was like, well, how do you hear the Holy Spirit?
 What does he sound like?
 So I got to teach her how to hear God's voice, which was--
  </li><li>Oh, that was tonight.
 I missed all of that.
  </li><li>Well, that's 'cause you were downstairs just smoking cigarettes
 and drinking cheap beer.
  </li><li>Hey, I was cleaning the kitchen.
  </li><li>Oh, sorry.
  </li><li>So, you know, and then smoking cigarettes,
 and I was just kidding.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>So that was one of the things we did.
 And then our last week at the school,
 we sent out many of our students around the world.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>How many students do we have?
 About 70 gone out on outreach?
  </li><li>Between our small group leaders and the students,
 yeah, there's like 73 or 75 or something
 that are in seven different locations around the world.
  </li><li>Yeah, we've got teams in England, Scotland, Canada,
 Nashville, Australia, Romania, and South Africa.
  </li><li>Yeah, amazing.
  </li><li>If you want a little boost of faith,
 if you go to schoolsupernaturallife.org/blog,
 you can follow along with them.
 You can also find the hashtags if you're on Instagram
 to get real-time videos or photos.
 But just, I spoke with Pastor Surprise,
 I didn't speak to him, he texted me today.
 We've got a team in South Africa and he was just saying we've had many miracles, many
 salvation's, many healings.
 I'm like, I can't wait to hear this.
 So good stories.
 So, as students, if you happen to be listening to this and you're on outreach, I guess you're
 going to your second week.
 We love you.
 We're super proud of you.
 We're praying for you.
 We bless you guys.
 We pray that you're having an amazing time.
 And thank you.
 I know that as many people who are listening to podcasts who are hosting our teams, thank
 you for doing such a good job.
 We're hearing great things from our students about our host family.
 So thank you for looking after that.
  </li><li>It's so fun as well to just follow them on Instagram
 and see all the beauty, basically,
 that they're encountering in all kinds of different places.
  </li><li>I think it's funny because every time
 somebody from Team Scotland posts,
 it's like Zelda in real life.
 How did I not have an appreciation
 when I lived in Scotland for everyone that looks like Zelda?
  </li><li>I know.
 And I keep looking at, you know,
 they're posting on the side of a cliff
 and there's another cliff and I'm like, easy.
 Just jump off of that, press X X,
 your little wind guy comes up,
 go over the other clip climate, you're there.
 Yeah.
 I'm like, yesterday I was playing Zelda.
 I came outside and I was waiting for you.
 And I was like, hmm, I could just use Revaldi's gale and jump onto my roof to inspect the roof tiles.
 That was like a natural dick.
 Let's just use your drone.
 Every once in a while when I see things that are sparkling on the side of the road, I think,
 Oh, I should go over and pick that up.
 What this happened?
 I know.
 I know it's bad.
 Oh, what?
 You beat Clemente Gannon.
 You should report.
 I think we already told them that I beat Calamity Ganon.
 Well, it's worth going through that again.
 I did beat Calamity Ganon.
 I beat him.
 And then this bad guy comes out after him that you didn't know existed and you have to beat him too.
 That's right.
 We did talk about that.
 I can remember you did a spoiler alert.
 Sorry.
 That's the second time that happened.
 Anyway, I'm super proud of you, babe, for doing that.
 Thank you.
 I also got to speak this morning, which was really fun.
 Yeah, you did.
 Yeah.
 I was really good.
 I spoke on the faithfulness of God, which was, well, I thought it was good.
 I was really fun.
 I think I love anytime when you can remind people of the things that they know to be true about God, but sometimes we forget them.
 I also love any time we finish early.
 You're welcome.
 Yeah, thank you.
 You were funny.
 We had guests in town and we were taking them out for lunch today and you were like, well, time should I make a reservation for?
 I was like, I don't know.
 You're speaking.
 You decide and you decided wisely.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 We also announced our source conference this morning.
 We did.
 which I had a lot of fun because I was sneaky.
 So for those of you who don't know, we run two conferences a year at Grace
 Center. We've traditionally had the more conference in the spring and having
 declared conference in the fall.
 And so I went as far as making artwork for our more 18 conference only to announce
 that it had been canceled because we were coming up with the source conference.
 This happened maybe a couple of months ago.
 We were sitting down and as a senior team, we were praying through what God's
 been doing in our church and we're realizing that the presence of God obviously is a key
 part of our church. It's the DNA of our church really. And we were looking at all our prophetic
 words that we have over our church and how God wants to bring transformation to our city
 and we were thinking, "How do we do that?" And so we just started talking about, you know,
 one of the things that's important in life is understanding what you've got so you know
 what you can give away. And I think it's all too easy to just think that what you have
 is normal and that's not true, you're unique, you're brilliant. And that goes for churches
 Every church is unique.
 Every church has a part of the thumbprint of God on them.
 And it's only when you recognize what you have
 that you can understand what you can give away.
 So for Grace Center, we're realizing, man,
 we really value the presence of God
 and the presence of God is unto something.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So we just started asking ourselves,
 what would it look like to raise our families
 with a value in the presence of God?
 Or what would it look like if businesses were led
 by the presence of God or leaders were inspired
 lead via the presence. And we realized we're just talking about living life in the presence
 of God. And so we're just genius idea, which was all Holy Spirit. We're just, I remember
 we're at Jeff and Becky's house, weren't we?
 Yeah. We're all just sort of brainstorming over lunch.
 Sitting around their gorgeous dining room table. And before you know it, we came up with this
 conference that we think is going to be amazing. We've asked all the speakers that the conference
 are going to be from Grace Center. They're all Grace Center members, only a handful of them are
 on staff, the rest are church members who are experts in their respective fields, but
 they love the presence of God.
 And we have four tracks at this conference.
 So you can come and learn about, you know, marriage and kids, aka family life in the
 presence of God, business.
 We've got some key leaders in business who are going to be talking about their journey
 through their careers accompanied by the presence of God.
 We've got some experts in our church who are going to be talking to us about living
 a life fueled by the Holy Spirit, let's health and organization. And then lastly, we've got
 a track on leadership, both for church leadership and for business leadership. And so the idea
 is you come, you do one of those tracks, you get copies of all the other tracks that are happening.
 It's all bathed in the incredible worship that we so love at Grey Center. And we're excited. We'd
 love you to come as well. It's May 18th to 19th. It's a weekend before the Memorial Day weekend,
 if you were an American and you know what that means. And the reason we're telling you about it
 now is we have a sale on 48 hours. The tickets are going to be $48. And after Tuesday, Elan's time,
 it goes up to $60 pre-registration, $80 at the door. So with Love You Come, we think it's going to be
 an incredible weekend. It's going to be these workshop sessions, 30 minutes talking, 45 minute
 Q&amp;A with the audience. And we're really excited to just start giving away some of what the
 Lord's deposited in our midst. And we couldn't be more excited to host our region.
 So I think it's going to be amazing. Come on. Yep. What else happened, baby? You want to
 see Black Panther? I did. I want to see Black Panther. I thought it was
 good. I think I'd heard so many people that were like, "Oh my gosh, it's the best one yet,
 blah, blah, blah." And I really like the Avengers ones better, you know, where there's a whole bunch
 into the characters rather than just one, but it was good.
 Yeah.
 And then this week they dropped the new Avengers,
 speaking of Avengers trailer for, it's coming up quick.
 Isn't it in April? It gets released?
 I don't know. I haven't.
 I'm so excited.
 I haven't witnessed that, but I do know that the Han Solo movie is coming up in the spring as well.
 Do nothing for me.
 Well, you know what? Get over it because you're going to go see it.
 Little insight into our marriage right there.
 We're going to put on our Star Wars outfits.
 You can do your hair like Princess Leia and off we go.
 Sorry.
 Don't talk to me about your Leia outfit.
 All right.
 Like we said, we don't have a topic for this week because we're trying to get to
 bed early, but we do have two listeners questions.
 The first one is from Jill.
 Jill asked this question.
 She says, I've reason to be going through healing prayer training with a group
 from my church using the Kilsra's book.
 This is me jumping in here as Alan.
 The Kilsra's book she's referring to is Chester and Betsy Kilsra's book
 on inner healing, they're amazing inner healing experts and dear friends of ours.
 Jill continues, "I typically don't like to give the enemy credit for things or even
 really talk about him because I just don't care about what he's doing. I've heard you talk about
 not having faith for counter attack and I know you never put much emphasis on what the enemy does
 because God is bigger. I'm not trying to walk around with my head in the sand. Obviously,
 we need to be prepared to an extent. But all this talk about the enemy and going through this
 training has made me uncomfortable. I guess it would be curious to hear you talk a little
 more about your perspective on spiritual warfare and the enemy and inner healing.
 Thanks.
 Great question, Jill. We did a whole episode on this actually, which is episode 41. So it
 would be alanah.com/41 if you wanted to have a listen to that because it goes into a whole
 bunch more detail, but basically our approach is not to be impressed by the devil, essentially.
 We've met so many people who have a very big devil and a very small God, and they seem
 like they're only content to believe that they're doing something good for God if they're
 being harassed by the enemy.
 We think that fruit demonstrates fruitfulness, not warfare.
 And to be clear, Jill, that's not what we think you're saying.
 We think you're probably in a similar camp to where we're at.
 you may have already listened to Episode 41, but you know, when it comes to the whole
 topic of inner healing, I get uncomfortable and I have a very, very small view of what
 the devil's up to.
 But when I have to prepare because I'm doing research or teaching on some deliverance stuff,
 for example, or if I'm teaching about some aspects of inner healing and I'm listening
 to people's testimonies, or more recently, we've been looking at some specific aspects
 of warfare.
 It gets me really uncomfortable because I don't like looking at sin.
 I get very sad when I understand the depravity of sin and the trauma that it causes people.
 I remember the first time I heard your testimony, AJ, I just, I still weep when I hear your
 testimony and realize the suffering that you had to endure at the hands of sin.
 And so I think some level of uncomfortableness is really, really healthy.
 I think where we get into trouble is where we get a really big devil and a really small
 god.
 I mean, we go into in more detail like AJ said in episode 41, but in summary, my key
 verse for all this is first Peter 5.8 where it says, "Be alert and of sober mind your
 enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour."
 So it's not that we have our head in the sand and are like, "No, no, no, no, the devil
 doesn't exist.
 He's not out to attack Christians.
 That's not what we're saying.
 saying, "Yeah, no, he really does look for people." But the key is found in that verse,
 "Who is he looking for? He's looking for somebody who's neither alert nor sober-minded."
 I don't know if we told the testimony about one of our people that we were leading.
 I don't want to go into it because it's, on the one hand, a really humorous story,
 but on the other hand, a really tragic story. But basically, this person got stoned
 and had a serious demonic attack and called freaking out when I was like, "Oh, and he's like,
 like, if you ever heard anything like this, I'm like, yeah,
 why scripture says be sober?
 Because when we get drunk, when we get high, when we outsource our faculties,
 when we are not alert, when we're not self controlled,
 we actually give opportunity for the enemy to harass us.
 But I also think, you know, that, that verse is really interesting.
 I think there's some truths in there that you'd have to know things about lions
 to understand as well.
 Like I have a friend who grew up as a missionary in Africa.
 And one of the things that she said was that, you know,
 lions that are making noise, that are roaring,
 are older lions that are trying to scare you
 with their bark basically.
 And so, you know, this is saying it's prowling around
 and roaring, it's looking for an easy pick off.
 It's looking for somebody who's unaware
 because actually it's probably pretty old
 and not able to actually do the things that it says it can.
 Right.
 So I think that's interesting too.
 Yeah, you can seriously minimize the warfare in your life by being sober and being alert.
 Yeah.
 I think it was David Wagner who said this.
 I love this line.
 He said, "Before the devil can have a stronghold, he needs a foothold."
 Yeah, so good.
 And Ephesians 4, 27 just lists some of the things that gives the devil a foothold.
 Things like lying, sinning, going to bed angry.
 I don't know what, I learned that one as a child.
 Don't let the sun go down on your anger.
 frustrating when you're married, isn't it?
 Well, thankfully we don't get angry that often, but yes.
 But when we are, I'm like, and you're like, "Oh, gotta stay awake until we get this started
 out."
 I'm not repaying this time, but we don't go bad angry.
 And then in verse 31, you get the great list, getting rid of things like bitterness, rage,
 anger, brawling, slander, all those sorts of things give the devil a foothold.
 That's spiritual warfare for a second.
 I realize if I read WebMD, I become a hypochondriac.
 Yes, you do.
 You know what I mean?
 You feel like I found a bump.
 It's just a zip, babe.
 No, but so, you know, I've got that certain disposition where I tend to worry.
 And so I remember when I started in my journey of inner healing and deliverance, there's
 a danger that you think everything means something.
 And you know, it probably does, but it also probably doesn't.
 I found being led by the Holy Spirit brings huge peace to me.
 But Jill, I don't think you're alone.
 I think, like I said, when especially the kilterists are just experts and so some of
 the stuff that you're reading, you're hungry, you're trying to learn, there's a tendency
 to try and apply that to your own life.
 And my encouragement is let other people journey you through that for you rather than jump into
 conclusions.
 I don't know if we've done a good job answering a question, Jill.
 I think you know what we mean, but if we didn't do a good job, just contact us and we'll try and
 do a better explanation.
 All right.
 The next one is by Brian.
 And Brian asks, "I'm currently experiencing a new level of hunger to learn that I've never
 experienced before.
 And I finished more books this year already than I have in the past several years combined
 and I'm loving it."
 That's amazing.
 That's amazing.
 I'm wondering if you would both share five books apart from the Bible that have had a
 really big impact on your life.
 Thanks.
 So babe, do you want to go first?
 I will.
 I was, I mean, the easy top, top two books off the top of my head, surprised by the power
 of the spirit.
 I'm surprised by the voice of God, both by Jack Deere.
 The reason they were so impacting for me is I was raised in a cessationist church.
 So I was raised in a Bible believing church that taught that the gifts of the spirit were
 no longer for today, which made me really, really sad because I was hoping there's going
 to be some cool stuff in the kingdom.
 And when I began seeing some of the cool stuff in the kingdom, I was worried I was being
 deceived.
 I was taught that these were counterfeit signs and wonders that the devil was doing this
 to deceive the elect.
 And when I read, "Surprise by the power of the spirit," I literally could not believe
 that there was this brilliant theological treatise, really.
 This is a very accessible book written by a very, very intelligent man, Dr. Jack Deere.
 He was a professor at a cessationist Bible school, and he talks about his story of meeting John
 Wimber in the Vineyard movement and having his whole mind opened to this and basically
 talks from scripture about why he used to believe they're no longer for today and how
 from scripture they are for today, an incredibly thorough examination of the topic.
 And then the subsequent book, "Surprised by the Voice of God," is all about Jack's
 journey into understanding the gift of prophecy and dreams and visions and meeting prophets.
 And, you know, when I read it, I was just like, "This is like gasoline.
 I loved it and I try and make a habit of reading it.
 I don't read them every single year, but I do revisit them and I'm always encouraged
 when I read them."
 So, I'll put links in the show notes for both of those books.
 The third book I read, and I'm going back to pivotal moments of my life.
 These books I haven't read recently, but The Hidden Power of Prayer and Fasting by
 my Hesh Shavda.
 Again, just could not believe what I was reading in the pages of this book.
 If you want to understand the power of prayer and fasting, if you want to read some testimonies
 that you're like, "Wait a minute, I'd highly encourage you to read that book."
 In my last two, the Blessed Life by Robert Morris was given to me by our friend Lyle Phillips.
 Just as on the one hand the Lord was taking me hand by hand through this journey of understanding
 blessing, Lyle comes along, gives me a copy of this book, The Blessed Life by Robert Morris,
 Phenomenal Book, an understanding generosity in God's blessing.
 It had me face down on the floor several times.
 I could not believe what I was reading and it was a huge challenge to me and I loved
 it. I'm about to reread it. And then this one is a bit of a cheat because this is a
 tome. I have not read this book cover to cover. It is a book called Systematic Theology by
 Wayne Grudem. It's designed to be dipped into. So there's chapters on every major theological
 principle. And it is such a well written book. Again, it's not inaccessible. Everybody could
 read it is written by a theology professor. So you might be thinking, ah, this is just
 like high and lofty and I want to understand the terms, but he's done a great job of making
 accessible. So there's my five top books off the top of my head.
 Wow. I haven't really thought about my five. I mean, off the top of my head, the first one that I
 thought of was Grace and Forgiveness, which is by John and Carolina.
 I nearly put that on my lips, but I knew you would pick that.
 And it's just a really short book, but it's so impactful. And it just gives you some tools
 to work through forgiveness and why you're doing it and how to work it through.
 I was also thinking about, and this is a book for married couples, but I really like the book
 called sheet music. It was all, essentially, it's about sex and things like that, written by a
 Christian. Sex and things like that? Or some other things that are like sex? Relationship stuff,
 You know that kind of stuff, but it is it is literally like he says in the opening of it if if you're not married you can only read chapter one or something like that, you know,
 We read it together on honeymoon. We did. Yeah, they're gonna think we're like super nerds or something if I was driving he would read to me.
 It was lovely and his Scottish accent was very strong back then so it you know it was it was.
 Fine.
 It was fine.
 Look at that before it was very sick.
 I don't have like wearing glasses while you're telling it.
 No, we have to pay attention.
 Okay, keep going.
 Okay.
 So that, I thought of that one.
 I was super into all the books about revivalists.
 So God's Generals was one of the books that I read.
 And then John G. Lake, there's one about John G. Lake that is just amazing and just sort
 of fills you with faith for the kinds of things that God can do and can use you to do.
 So I think those are both fantastic books.
 I'm trying to think of something I've read recently.
 Needing one more book.
 You can't use the ultimate Zelda compendium.
 No, definitely not.
 Well, I can't even figure out how that thing works.
 So I mean, I've looked at it a couple times and I'm like, I don't know.
 I guess the last one I would recommend is a book called The Search for Significance.
 Now this book is a beast.
 Like it's a big book, but it's excellent and it's such a great foundational kind of book
 for inner healing and just really learning who you are and who the father is to you and
 all that kind of stuff.
 At one time it was required reading for people on the ministry team in Toronto.
 Yes.
 That's why I read it.
 That's why I read The Beast.
 But it's a big book, but it's great.
 All right, Brian, I hope that's helpful for you.
 Can I add one more book?
 I know I did five.
 Sure.
 Go for a bonus level.
 Just, I tend to read like sort of practical books.
 And I would honestly say one of the books that's helped me the most as a parent is a
 book called Baby Wise.
 So it's actually called On Becoming Baby Wise.
 But if you say Baby Wise, you'll be able to find it.
 it's excellent and just super helpful in helping new parents or maybe even parents that are
 like, "Wow, it was really difficult. The last info was really difficult. I wonder if there's
 a different way of doing this." There might be. It's a great book.

 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin, Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God and everything under the sun
 If you are a human being, there's something here for everyone
