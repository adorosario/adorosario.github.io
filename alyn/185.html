<p> I live in a days but got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode 185 of keeping up with the Jones is where this week we're talking about living a laid down life.
 But first a day Jones I was a week was a good week was it it is always a good week.
 It is always a good week, but it's the truth it's true and interest week in year 2 I was teaching a topic called the coming judgment.
 which as you can imagine had everybody excited.
 You know what's funny? They were excited.
 They were. They were still.<br/>
 It's funny because it was lots of really, really heavy topics,
 some with really big names.<br/>
 So we were talking about the sovereignty of God and Calvinism,
 Armenianism, predestination, hell, universalism, annihilationism,
 all that sort of fun stuff.<br/>
 We even got to talk about the Illuminati in there.
 That's so exciting.<br/>
 And the Catholic Church.<br/>
 Wow. Yeah, we covered a lot of ground, but I'll be honest with you, it was heavy.
 Like I came home Monday and I was wiped out.
 Yeah. When you're talking about the whole thing about the nature of sin
 and the eternal consequences of sin, hell.
 I mean, they're just like such sober realities. Yeah.
 And I was wiped out and didn't go to emanate, but you did.
 And I heard you did a killer job. I did. You did do a killer job.
 No, I mean, I did go.<br/>
 I suppose I did a killer job.<br/>
 I had fun.<br/>
 I didn't even remember that I spoke on Monday.
 Isn't that funny?<br/>
 Until you just said that.<br/>
 That's how it feels.<br/>
 Life feels so busy.<br/>
 But yeah, I spoke on help in asking for help.
 So it was fun.<br/>
 That's an important life skill.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Why do you suppose people don't ask for help?
 Well, probably a couple of things.<br/>
 Shame, pride, somebody taught them not to, that sort of thing.
 We looked at all that.<br/>
 And then we sort of talked about who do you ask for help
 and how do you ask for help and all that kind of stuff?
 And then the rest of the week was much the same as every other week, lots of meetings,
 lots of appointments.<br/>
 Friday, I got to do something that was a lot of fun.
 I got to go and speak at a local business here in Franklin.
 Yeah.<br/>
 One of our alumni from the school was like, "Hey, I work at this company and I think it'd
 be great if you'd come in and teach on boundaries and powerful communication."
 So I spent the morning with a company here in town and taught them all about what it
 means to be powerful, what it looks like to have boundaries.
 I had a lot of fun, including the fact they had donuts for breakfast, which is always good.
 So I'm sorry, Pardon?<br/>
 Yes, sorry.<br/>
 So you know how I had to bring up that card in pieces and confessed you that I'd
 ripped it to shreds?<br/>
 Oh, yes.<br/>
 Explain.<br/>
 So our friend, Danny, gave you this card saying thank you.
 And then he talked to me in the hall this morning and apparently the card was a joke.
 So it's supposed to once you press the button.
 It's supposed to never stop playing the song.
 And then just get louder and louder and that.
 So you had left the card in the, um, in the car.
 Yep.<br/>
 And so we switched cars and so I was like, oh, you know, he's left something in the car.
 And I picked up the card and I put like I squeezed it when I picked it up.
 And the song started playing and then I'm driving along.
 And by the third time it goes through and it's really obnoxious.
 I'm like, oh my gosh, it's never going to end.
 So I opened the card and try, you know, like, try opening it,
 try shutting it, whatever, nothing.<br/>
 And so I ended up ripping it to shreds and then pulling the
 wrist that like the receptors out of the battery.
 That's why you came in.<br/>
 You're like, babe, I need to walk in the light and I'm like, uh-huh.
 And you're like, I did this to your carton.
 You handed me this card that was in pieces.
 Yes.<br/>
 I was like, that's a really violent response until Danny told me, no,
 it's supposed to drive you nuts.<br/>
 There's no way of turning off until you destroy it.
 So I'm plotting his demise. I'll have to get back to him at some point.
 But yeah, then Friday we got to go celebrate a friend for birthday all last minute,
 including our favorite pizza place to sound us, which was just absolutely glorious.
 Whoop, whoop. And then Sunday church. Do you want to talk about this morning?
 Yeah, it was great. I was only at second service and actually it was supposed to be
 in children's ministry, but then they ended up having enough people. So I got to come in at the
 the end of worship.<br/>
 And basically, you know, Jeff is so good at being sensitive to what the Holy Spirit is
 doing.<br/>
 He's amazing.<br/>
 And he's not precious about he has to speak or it has to look a certain way.
 And he had a killer message because I heard it in first service.
 Right.<br/>
 It was a really good message.<br/>
 I'm going to have to go back.<br/>
 I came forward for the altar call for it.
 Oh, good.<br/>
 So you got saved.<br/>
 Again.<br/>
 That's fantastic.<br/>
 Um, so, uh, yeah, so he was just sort of following the Holy Spirit and then he gave
 of a prophetic word and the whole place went silent.
 And I mean, it was great.<br/>
 I mean,
</p><ul>
  <li>You should probably separate that.
 People didn't go silent because he gave a prophetic word.
  </li><li>No, no, that was, I mean, that was, yes, that's right.
 That's always part of it though.
 Like, I mean, he gave this word
 and then there was just sort of like a real piece
 that fell in the room.
 It was amazing.
  </li><li>And then we went back into worship
 and it felt amazing.
  </li><li>It felt really good.
  </li><li>And he said this and I tweeted it
 'cause I thought it was so good.
 He said, I'm not trying to make something happen,
 but I don't want to miss it if it does.
 And I was like, that absolutely sums up Jeff's approach to ministry.
 Yeah.
 But it was a really special morning.
 I love when Jeff goes off the reservation.
 I love that we have a leader who does that.
 Yeah.
 That's really good.
 Yeah.
 I just feel so content when that happens.
 Yeah.
 And it's really fun to partner with the Holy Spirit and just sort of follow
 what he's doing and, you know, see what happens.
 It's good.
 Yeah.
 So that was our week.
 I hope you had an amazing week to dear listener.
 Another major event happened this week that we want to talk about in light of
 our topic for this week.
 Take it away, AJ.
 So our topic is a life laid down.
 And sort of where the topic comes from is Billy Graham passed into eternity
 this past week.
 And so he's home with the one that he lived for.
 So that's very exciting.
 But just sort of pondering Billy Graham and pondering the kind of life that he
 led or, you know, from everything that we know about him,
 He seemed like he was just full of character.
 I never met him, but I did go to a Billy Graham crusade
 in the Sky Dome and he packed the Sky Dome.
 In fact, there was 15,000 people that couldn't get in
 and they just blasted it outside.
 And when they did the altar called thousands,
 I mean, more than 10,000 people gave their life to the Lord
 in the city of Toronto.
 It was amazing.
 So I remember that from when I was like 20 something.
 But his life was amazing and he just sort of lived it to the fullest.
 And of course he's got kids now in full-time ministry and all that kind of stuff.
 But you never heard about character stuff with him or any kind of falling, if that makes sense.
 Right.
 And then in addition, of course, he apparently was an advisor to most of the last presidents and all that kind of stuff.
 So yeah, he was an advisor to a bunch of them.
 I was reading it this morning.
 I forget how many of it.
 I think maybe it was like 12 in a row or something.
 I mean, it's what an incredible privilege.
 Um, and I was trying to find this that I had read something the day after he died,
 uh, where someone posted that he had preached to 216 million people in his
 lifetime is what they, you know, estimated.
 And I'm just like, wow, I mean, it's just amazing.
 Mm hmm.
 So in pondering Dr. Graham, I was starting to think, what are some of the
 things that we can do to live a life that is laid down to God?
 to finally down to God.
  </li><li>I mean, that God's the one that actually gets
 to call the shots, you know, like,
 that our lives are not only about our families
 and about our dreams and about all, you know,
 all those things, which are all good things,
 but also about obedience to him
 and the things that he's called us to.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's a temptation to give your life to Jesus
 fully at the point of salvation
 and then to slowly take bits of it back.
  </li><li>Right.
 I'm tired now. I'm going to let the 20-year-old be missionaries.
 Right. Whatever. I think that's... I mean, following the Lord looks like something.
 So anyway, we'll talk to you about what do you think living a laid-down life looks like? What's
 it marked by? Well, here's what I sort of thought is. First of all, I think it's marked by character.
 I think... Like when you think of, again, you think of Billy Graham, nobody can think of scandals
 that are associated with Billy Graham.
 And I think there's a reason for that.
 And I wonder if actually, it would be great
 if there was a higher standard that we held ourselves to
 in terms of what we think is okay.
 Does that make sense?
 So yeah, my thought was I think character
 is one of the things that would mark a life
 that is laid down because actually
 character takes work.
 You don't just come by character,
 you have to do feed character.
 and you have to choose to be a person of character,
 even when it's easier not to be.
  </li><li>It's like Bill Hybel says,
 characters who you are when no one's looking.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's all the decisions that you make for no other gain
 than building godly character.
  </li><li>Right.
 I think it was, I'm trying to remember who's Chip Judd,
 but I think, you know, one of our friends had said,
 "Whoever you are at home with your spouse,
 "with your kids, that's who you are."
  </li><li>So what you're saying is,
 I'm an unshaved lump that eats gummy bears in his box
 of shorts and plays Zelda.
 That's who I am.
 That is actually why orchestrated this podcast three years ago for this moment of confrontation.
 Wow, that's a lot of learning.
 Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty awesome like that.
 My other thought was, you know, to live a life that is given over to God fully, you
 need to actually work on your stuff.
 So inner healing, I think, is a big part of that.
 It's, you know, getting rid of all the owies and just, you know, working through your stuff
 instead of running from it or trying to shove it down.
 I think a lot of people don't think they need inner healing because they don't
 think anything bad has happened to them.
 Like we can see why you need inner healing.
 Like you grew up in a really abusive background and you know, you had alcoholic
 parents and a lot of abandonment and suicide.
 Yeah, you need inner healing.
 Yeah.
 But like most normal people don't need inner healing.
 What's your thought on that?
 I don't know anybody that doesn't need inner healing.
 I've never met somebody who doesn't need it.
 Right.
 Um, because the fact is we've all done life with other people and there's no perfect people.
 So all of us have got some things to work through.
 I think when we think we don't need in our healing, we've embraced major portions of denial.
 Yeah.
 And for that very reason, it's probably worth looking under the hood to see what you're in such denial about.
 Right.
 What, what, what is it that your heart wants to hide?
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And I love the process.
 It's basically sanctification really, isn't it?
 It's being made more like Jesus.
 And it's the largest point, his finger on it's that verse in
 is it Sam 139 search me of God, know my heart, see if there's any wicked way in
 me or is that some 138.
 It's one of the Psalms search me of God, know my heart, see if there's any wicked way in
 me.
 Lead me in the way of everlasting.
 And so it's allowing the Lord to search you, let him put a finger on your heart, see
 if there's any offensive way in us.
 And I think you get to a point in your Christian walk with the Lord where you
 stop sinning, as in, I'm not interested in doing wrong things. But we forget that a lot of our
 perfectly acceptable behavior is rooted in sin. Right. Like the most common response to control
 is rebellion. So if we feel controlled, we rebel, but we think we're justified in our rebellion,
 because we were being controlled. But rebellion is rebellion is rebellion. So all of our coping
 mechanisms, all of our defense mechanisms are usually just, you know, a pig with lipstick
 on it. You know, we don't, we don't want to call it a sin. Right. But we're just like,
 Oh, yeah, I'm just, you know, anyway, yes, I fully agree in our healing, not letting
 sin be your master, not letting sin crouch at your door, removing any area where the enemy
 may have a foothold is, is absolutely vital.
 Yeah, and maybe in addition to sin pain, not letting pain have a voice, not letting pain
 and fear get to make your decisions for you.
 I mean, all that kind of stuff, those are things that you need in your healing for to
 be able to make a better decision and respond instead of react.
 There we go.
 So my other thought was being part of a community of believers that helps you grow would be
 a great way to start heading towards laying down your life because you know if we're not
 in community there is actually nobody there to help you see the things that you cannot
 possibly see. So we just think you know we're trucking along I'm like oh yeah I'm great
 I don't have any issues and then you do community and you realize that person's rubbing me the
 wrong way or that person pointed out whatever but the point of community is actually to
 to bring health, right?
 So not only support for hard times,
 but people that will know you well enough to say,
 "Hey, you know what I mean?"
 Like your sin is showing or whatever.
 You know, so I think it's important to be in community.
  </li><li>Yeah, for sure.
 We grow a better in community.
  </li><li>I think we only grow in community.
  </li><li>It's very hard, you know, in scripture,
 Jesus said, "Let him who is ears let him hear
 what the spirit says to his churches."
 If you're not in church,
 you can't hear what the spirit is saying.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Just
  </li><li>Fastening.
  </li><li>I think too,
 one of the things I've noticed sometimes is some people,
 they will stay in community until somebody challenges them,
 or until something gets brought up in them
 that they don't wanna deal with,
 and then they switch to a new community,
 and they make all new friends and everything's hunky-dory,
 until those people also start to notice,
 whatever it is, and then we keep moving,
 And you never actually are going to experience freedom or growth or anything living like
 that.
 Stay in community.
 Let people say, "Hey, that thing there is going to rob life from you.
 Can I help you with that?"
 Because if you keep moving, you're going to find yourself in your 60s or 70s still getting
 dogged by the same demons following you around from community to community.
 It's just, it's not a great decision.
 I've also noticed when that happens, we rewrite history.
 Oh, yeah.
 So we rewrite a narrative that puts us as a hero.
 And the reason we've done all these churches is because of X, Y, and Z.
 It's never because of us.
 And sometimes I want to go, oh, what's the common denominator in all of those churches
 that you've done from?
 Right.
 Oh, wait, I know.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's you.
 So, I mean, that may sound kind of harsh, but I think as a pastor, I'd love to see people
 actually growing.
 Sometimes you see people leaving because growth seems harder, you know, or actually working
 through their stuff, but I promise you it's going to appear at the next place too.
 So deal with it now, and then you get to be free of it instead of keeping it as a pet.
 Anything else?
 Yeah, I also thought I'm sure that at some point in Billy Graham's life, there was open
 doors that didn't look like stadiums with thousands of people in it.
 I'm sure.
 At some point, he just started sharing the gospel with whoever was sitting in front of him.
 And so my thought was, I wonder if, you know, well, I don't think you have to be called as an
 evangelist to share the gospel. I don't think you have to, you know, be called as a pastor to be
 in ministry. I mean, I think we've made that clear from previous podcasts. But we all have
 opportunities as well to grow in our faith and to grow in our kingdom opportunities. Does that
 Does that make sense?
 So I think I was just thinking part of living a life
 that's laid down to God is saying yes
 to the opportunities that come your way,
 even if they're a little bit scary.
  </li><li>I would tell the story before,
 but I remember we were teaching on a school,
 a young man who said he was called to pass
 for a mega church, I was like, that's awesome.
 Like what are you doing in the meantime?
 And he just looked at us blankly and I said,
 "Do you have a home group?"
 And he's like, "No."
 I was like, do you help in the youth ministry or with the kids?
 No.
 And his whole expectation was, oh, there's not smaller doors.
 I have to open and walk through.
 Yeah.
 He's just waiting for those large wooden double doors to open.
 I'm just going to be handed the keys to a mega church.
 Yeah.
 And I'm like, no, it's a principle of the kingdom that God is looking for, you
 know, good and faithful servants in which he can expand their responsibility.
 Right.
 Not that would just go from zero to to 60.
 I think in a similar vein, sometimes you get to a stage in life where more doors open
 than you should necessarily walk through.
 True.
 So as well as considering the smaller doors that may not appeal to you, consider the
 larger doors that do appeal to you and is the Lord behind that.
 I think about some of the opportunities we've been offered that sound very appealing, but
 it's not the Lord.
 Right.
 Like before we moved to Nashville, there was opportunities that were presented to us.
 we've moved to Nashville, we've had opportunities presented to us. And we're not from the Lord
 given us a strong vision for our life of where we're going. We could have been derailed by glitter
 or other opportunities. So I think that's important. Things that might look better on paper or
 something at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. Beware, I guess, the emergency exit that gets you at the
 the pressure cooker God's put you in.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's a good tip.
  </li><li>Because all that will happen is you'll move
 to another pressure cooker.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I noticed that what God's trying to do
 isn't geographically dependent, like you can't escape it.
  </li><li>It's very true.
 I think too, if you're living in community
 like the previous point, then when opportunities come up,
 whether they're big or small, you have a community
 of believers around you that is praying for you,
 that wants your best interest.
 that's helping you hear God on big decisions,
 all that kind of stuff,
 because you're not living life in a bubble,
 but you're living it with a whole bunch of ears around you,
 if that makes sense.
 It's a lot easier to not miss things.
  </li><li>One of the many advantages of a healthy community.
  </li><li>Indeed.
 I was also thinking,
 with Billy Graham with a lot of people that you see
 in full-time ministry now that have been in ministry
 40 or 50 or 60 years. I mean, Billy Graham was in full-time ministry for 80 years.
 Isn't that amazing? He died at 99 and he was in full-time ministry for 80 years.
 He started when he was 19.
 Apparently he did.
 Good Lord.
 Isn't that crazy?
 Yeah.
 That's faithfulness. I'm sure there were probably lots of options open to him to do different things,
 but he just stayed faithful to what God had asked him to do.
 And my thought is just to stay faithful to whatever it is that God's asked you to do.
 And God may have asked you to be a doctor, a banker, a builder, whatever it is,
 but just stay faithful to what he's asked you to do.
 And until he asked you to do something different is my thought.
 Huge, huge thought.
 Yeah.
 Huge importance.
 I truly believe in the philosophy of blossoming where you're planted.
 Yeah.
 Where I think there's a danger that we live live out of the season we're in because we long to be in another one.
 I'm like man there's so much good stuff to mine in the season that you're in.
 If nothing other than cultivating a track record of faithfulness right.
 I somebody asked me the day like.
 You know your school teacher what was life like for you in those days actually it's one of our students they were they're asking hey.
 Can you describe what it looked like before you were doing what you were called to do and I.
 Said yeah, this is what it looked like I I thought.
 I didn't want to be a teacher. I was a teacher and after about four years, I said, Lord, if this is all you, not all, please, if you're a teacher, don't, don't hear that this is like a minimal calling.
 It's a huge calling.
 Oh my gosh, massive.
 But I felt like Lord, if you have nothing other than me being a school teacher, then I will be the best school teacher that I can possibly be for the glory of God. That's, that's what I'll give my life to.
 And no sooner had I come to that realization, that's what I want to do.
 I feel like the Lord offered me an opportunity to move to Toronto.
 And then that all changed my life.
 But there's something about proving yourself in terms of faithfulness.
 It's easy to be faithful in the things you want to do.
 Much harder to be faithful in the things that you don't want to do or things you
 think are beneath you, or any of those other negative environments.
 Yeah.
 So I guess summing it up, my thought would be to live intentionally.
 I think if we live intentionally towards the kingdom of God, then we don't end up in our, you know, 60s or 70s, wondering what we spent our lives on.
 But we can actually look back and go, yeah, I spent it well because I lived intentionally.
 And I think the Holy Spirit helps us with that.
 If we'll listen to him, you know what I mean?
 Like if we'll go, okay, God, what does this season look like and live intentionally in each season, then you're, you're building that
 road of intentional living.
 I've given a couple of prophetic words recently, and they're all around the same theme, which
 makes me think, "Hmm, I wonder if this is the season that we're in," but they're all
 about the Lord shifting gears in people's lives.
 And so I just wanted to pray for everyone who's listening, people who have been living
 faithfully.
 You know, the other element we haven't talked about is what happened when the Lord wants
 to shift seasons for you.
 So let me pray for you, and then we'll answer this question.
 Lord I thank you for everyone who's listening right now. I thank you for the season that you've had us in
 Well, it's been good or bad Lord
 It's been a season that you've been with us and which always makes a good season and Lord for the people who are listening whose lives are about to change
 Because you're about to shift gears for them
 but I ask that it would be a season of acceleration a season of excitement and a season
 Complete with confirmation that we would know without a shadow of a doubt
 That you're moving us into something new and what I asked for the smooth transition for that and for joy in the process in
 Jesus name amen
 I was thinking about when we were transitioning out of living in Toronto and itinerating around the world to moving to a
 Little town called Franklin, Tennessee
 About the everything you just said like we lived in community
 We had so many people to share that word with this is what we feel the Lord's doing even when we didn't feel really sure about it
 just receiving other people being like, "Oh, this is totally the Lord. This makes so much sense."
 And the excitement of being a new season that it brings. And so I'm just thinking about people
 who are in that situation as well. We're praying for you, and we're excited about what that will do for you.
 So what's the listener's question?
 Well, I got a great question for you.
 Okay.
 Oh, wait. Why is it for me?
 Because you're great at this stuff.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 This is anonymous. Somebody's just written in. "Dear Alan A.J., I really enjoy your podcast.
 Thank you for doing this. Please could you describe some of how you have handled discipline
 for your preschool age kids and then in their email to us they described some of the cycles
 that their five-year-old child is going through and help us break those cycles. And so I,
 just kind of your usual stuff, kids get kind of locked and then they escalate it rather than
 deescalate it and all your usual stuff doesn't work. What's your top tips, Adriana?
 Wow, what are my top tips? So I guess I have a couple of thoughts. In thinking about sort of
 parenting in general, Alan and I have gone with a fairly structured approach to parenting because
 that's what our lives are like. We're very planner type people. And I know I've mentioned on previous
 podcast that we did something called Baby Wise and that kind of stuff.
 And so the kids grew up understanding that Mummy and Daddy are Mummy and Daddy.
 And so there's a certain level of them getting that if Mummy and Daddy have said no, then
 that really means no.
 But all the kids, I would say, responded differently to different types of discipline.
 So with a couple of the kids, well with most of them, we would have to think about it's
 stair in our house or this to think about it's stool or whatever.
 And none of them really liked to be separated from us.
 So if there was extreme behavior or bad behavior, we'd be like, I'd like you to go and sit
 on the stair.
 And then when you're ready to apologize, you're welcome to come back.
 You know, and we would try not to get mad or escalate it, but just be really calm and
 be like, "Wow, you don't get to behave like that here. If you would like to behave like
 that, you can behave like that in your room or on the stair."
 Right. We try to separate the behavior from the child.
 Right.
 We are punishing your behavior. We're not punishing the child. That is bad behavior.
 You're not a bad person.
 Yes. It's funny, both Abby and Tia at different points when they were in the four, five, six
 area, every once in a while, they do something. We didn't even catch it and they go and sit on
 on the stair by themselves and then come back, which is quite cute.
 I think your memory might be a little off because if you think about it, this was
 all before five, like MJ's five, we never used to think about a step.
 So you're talking about three or four year olds.
 Yeah, not five year olds.
 Yeah, that's true.
 Yeah.
 I think about a step at a five year old stage is probably a little bit too
 late for that sort of stuff.
 I mean, I don't know.
 I think I think with MJ, because of his personality, that would still work.
 Because again, he doesn't like to be, he wants to cuddle with you every second of
 the day. So to have to sit on the stair by himself is like torture.
 I am a cuddled machine though. So that makes sense.
 It's true. It's true. And, and while I don't know if this would work for all
 kids, for our kids at varying ages, it's work to just sort of say, Hey, I don't
 want you to lose dessert. So can you choose a different emotion? You know,
 right. So dessert, you know, our preference seem to be sort of removing things or
 saying, "Hey, you need to go to your room and get your attitude sorted out, and when you
 are ready to come out and be nice to the rest of the family, then you're welcome to come out."
 Right. I think also, if you are, like your email suggested, you're in this unusual season where
 it's not normal. Some of the tactics that we would employ is heaping praise when they're doing it
 right and forming this great connection when they're doing the way you want it to do.
 So rather than the only time you react is when they're doing something wrong, react when they're doing things right and he prays upon the behavior that you're seeing that you love.
 And we would you know we would do discipline with our kids the same way we do public speaking you know tell people what you're going to say say it then tell them what you said.
 So with our kid we were like we're going to go for lunch today this is the behavior expecting from you when they're at lunch i'm loving you behavior this is exactly what i was looking for when we're driving home that was amazing what you did at lunch so that you're reinforcing.
 The expectations that you have sometimes there's just a temptation that we have by us most of some assumption of how we'd like kids to behave and just in distress when they don't.
 but actually kind of dialing it down a little bit and let them know what is and isn't appropriate
 is really really helpful without all of the, I mean, I remember, especially with our first two,
 because I didn't understand this principle yet, especially if we were out in public,
 my shame would be so high that I would overreact to what was going on. And so then you don't have
 like a stable environment for the kid to know what they've done, what's right, you have a slightly
 more erratic, because I'd fly off the handle because I'm embarrassed that they're behaving
 badly in public.
 Now you're going to come outside and have a talk with Daddy.
 Right.
 A couple of resources that I'd suggest to you.
 Danny Silk wrote a wonderful book called Loving Our Kids On Purpose.
 So good.
 It's basically a reworking of the love and logic parenting approach.
 You can look at love and logic as well, but Danny's book certainly is just a wonderful
 resource of explaining an approach to dealing with your kids, but like anything, you're
 going to read it probably.
 I think that's never going to work.
 It's never going to work because it's probably so far removed.
 I'm not speaking to you specifically.
 I'm speaking to most parents.
 By the time you're looking for books on how to help your child, anything they're going
 to suggest seems like a radical departure from what you're doing and you're thinking
 that's probably not going to work.
 and it probably isn't gonna work as a one-off solution,
 but as a completely new consistent approach to parenting,
 I'm sure it will.
  </li><li>I think two kids really do have seasons, don't they?
 So I remember Tia having a season where she went
 from being fairly compliant.
 I mean, she's got a lot of--
  </li><li>Sass.
  </li><li>Sass.
 But she would do pretty good.
 And then around the age of four or five,
 she threw down, didn't she, for about a year.
 Every once in a while, it wasn't on a regular basis,
 but about once a month,
 there'd be some sort of major throwdown
 where she would scream and whatever,
 and we'd be like, okay, you can scream in your room.
 And then when, you know, we did Danny's thing of like,
 we would love to be with you when you're done behaving
 like this.
 And I mean, she would give it.
  </li><li>I don't remember any of this.
  </li><li>Yeah, I do, because she would open the door and scream,
 and then I go and I close the door,
 and then she'd open the door and she'd stand there
 screaming. - I don't remember this.
 was horrible. But I mean, it was literally like, you know, Danny's thing was don't give
 into it. Don't escalate. Don't make it a bigger thing than it is. Just be like this,
 you know, because I remember Abby only doing that once and I failed in my approach to that
 because she did you escalate? I totally escalate. Where was I in the moment? You weren't there.
 Now, that's the only time it ever happened with her. But honestly, I think I was, I was
 more traumatized.
 You were a mess afterwards.
 I was a mess afterwards.
 And so I was like, okay, I don't think I'm going to do that one again.
 The thing of just saying, hey, I love you, but you don't get to behave like that.
 So you need to go in your room if you're going to behave like that, and you can come out
 when you're ready.
 That worked a lot better.
 But it also took a little bit longer.
 Abby only threw down once.
 Tia threw down probably six times that year before she sort of stopped doing that season.
 So MJ hasn't thrown down.
 So he's a cuddler, not a fighter.
 And so as long as he's got cuddles, he's pretty happy.
 So I think enough of our rambling.
 I think the short solution is go read Danny's book because he's far smarter than us.
 And it's way more experienced than I'll put a link to in the show notes.
