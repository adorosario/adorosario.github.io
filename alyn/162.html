<p> I live in a days but got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 162 of keeping up with Joneses.
 With this week we're talking about how to steward the prophetic words of your life.
 We're answering questions on married life, church and fivefold ministry.
 And most importantly, a snake update.<br/>
 But first, AJ Jones, how the heck are you?
 I'm doing pretty good.<br/>
 How are you doing?<br/>
 I am doing good.<br/>
 It's been an interesting week.<br/>
 It has.<br/>
 because for the first two days of the week, you were sick.
 Like a dog.<br/>
 And then for the last two days, you've actually been sick in bed.
 Like a dog.<br/>
 Like a dog.<br/>
 So everything in moderation.<br/>
 Yes, and we each got our turn.<br/>
 So that's all that really matters.<br/>
 And it's totally thrown us because last week,
 we recorded it on Friday instead of a Sunday.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Because the Sunday was going to be crazy.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So it's been 10 days, which feels really long.
 Right.<br/>
 And in the midst of that, we've been away.
 Yep.<br/>
 So let's recap the week.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 So Sunday, Michelle spoke at church actually.
 She did.<br/>
 And she did an amazing job.<br/>
 Really great message.<br/>
 I'll put a link in the show notes.<br/>
 And then Sunday night, you spoke at the blind.
 That's right.<br/>
 It's our church run by our friends, Alex and Henry Cooley.
 If you haven't listened to their podcast, I'll link to that as well in the show notes.
 Great church.<br/>
 Love that church.<br/>
 Got to speak there Sunday afternoon and Sunday night.
 So that involved me pulling my influencer for a solid.
 Seven hours.<br/>
 Got there at three.<br/>
 You didn't leave till about 10.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Yes. And we did in the midst of all of that manage to go to Desanos.
 So that's all that, you know, really matters.
 Yeah, my message was fueled by Desanos.
 Filled by Desanos.<br/>
 Yeah, I think part of the reason we decided to record early was actually
 because my cousins were coming in town for the weekend.
 Right. So it was a great weekend in that I got lots of quality time
 with my cousins and they got to see our snake.
 So do you want to jump ahead and just just make update?
 The snake update is that the snake did definitely die.
 Paul went out on Saturday and put a stick underneath its head
 and like lifted its head up sort of, you know,
 up a couple feet and then pulled the stick away
 and it just flopped against the tree.
</p><ul>
  <li>Paul being your cousin's aforementioned.
  </li><li>Yes, the aforementioned cousin.
 And so we decided it was most definitely dead,
 although I still didn't want to get very close to it.
  </li><li>And then I just took care of it like a man,
 I just went down with my bare hands, took it off, shoved it in the trash.
 Is that how you want to play this?
 Because the truth would be that neither of us wanted to touch it.
 The truth would be I turn in a little girl and just squealed at the thought of touching it.
 Right.
 And then we forgot to put it because I got sick and life got busy and then Wednesday
 rolled around.
 And Kate mentioned that soon,
 Vultures might arrive to visit the snake and then we would have to figure out how to get rid of vultures.
 And so which below I was fine with that.
 We did what brave people do, didn't we, baby?
 We called our neighbor.
 Yeah.
 Miss Deirdre who got blessed or came over armed with two plastic bags, some like gloves
 and some sort of strange tool for picking things out of trees.
 Well, I think it's for picking up litter off the grounds.
 You don't have to bend down.
 Oh, and she just used that.
 But the snake had decomposed so badly.
 It was coming off in pieces.
 So disgusting.
 Oh, so gross.
 So gross.
 And she was just like, "That's happy as could be."
 I don't know that she was really enjoying it,
 but she was lovely and she took care of it.
 She was calm.
 Yeah, she was calm.
 I was grossed.
 I was so grossed out.
 I was never happier to shed my masculinity in that moment.
 I'm like, "You know what? You knock yourself out.
 I'll configure your Wi-Fi router.
 You just remove snakes from a tree."
 Yeah, we'd probably need to see if they have any technical needs
 that you can take care of this week.
 I'm going to go over and break stuff in their house.
 And then fix it.
 Just appear the hero because at this point,
 We're so in debt to the number of things.
 It's ridiculous, the amount of things
 that we've done around our house.
 Yeah, it's unquantifiable.
 So the snake is dead. Yeah.
 It is dead and gone now.
 And then so rewind that Monday you got sick.
 I got sick.
 Which means I got to speak at M&amp;A.
 You did. I was supposed to speak.
 And I got to teach on dreams again.
 Yeah.
 I'm loving this.
 For those of you who weren't at M&amp;A,
 I've been studying dreams and scripture.
 I've read every dream and every interpretation
 in scripture. And my gosh, the amount of revelation the Holy Spirit showed me, I'm just loving it.
 So I'm loving dreams at the moment.
 I love how thorough you are in seeking understanding when the Lord is
 knocking on your heart about something.
 Well, I just think the Lord is so good. He always gives me a promise like, hey, if you'll do this,
 I'll do this. And I'm like, yes, I'd be very interested in what you have to offer.
 Right.
 And plus it's a fascinating topic. So I love it.
 For sure.
 So that was Monday.
 That was Monday.
 Then Tuesday I went back to speak at the Belong.
 You did tonight. Stay in bed.
 like yeah, moaning.
 And then Wednesday you convinced yourself you were better.
 And I said, don't come in.
 You're going to get me sick.
 No, I had quarantined myself.
 I was living upstairs.
 No, you weren't though.
 You came down and used my bathroom and shower in the same room as I was in.
 So, you know, you think that's what did it.
 I think so.
 I think it was your lack of self control and wanting to be in my bathroom.
 But what if you need to tell yourself, be born and play girl.
 Yeah, whatever. Thankfully, the kids didn't get it. So that's very good. And yeah, and then
 Thursday, we left our kids in capable hands and headed off to do the small group leaders retreat
 for the School of Supernatural Life, which is starting in a few weeks.
 This is where we take away all our new leaders or some returning leaders off to the Smoky Mountains
 for taking away for a weekend and teach them how to lead and do a bunch of training. And I say we,
 but this week I got sick. So having arrived there, I was just sick as a dog for the whole time.
 So I actually contemplated looking up Uber to see how much it was to get driven back to Franklin
 because we were the loudest cabin I've ever been in. It was so loud. And it wasn't loud
 because of the people. No. Because we've been away with similar sized groups before.
 This was a cabin with zero insulation. No sound insulation whatsoever.
 Every hinge, every bed spring, every door.
 -Creeked. -Made a noise.
 Yeah. Adam and Anna had the bedroom above us,
 and I kept thinking, like, if they got up in the night to go the bathroom,
 that somebody was walking through our bedroom.
 So I kept waking up like, "Ah!"
 You know, and then I'm like, "Oh, it's them above us."
 You know, and it's just because we could literally see the light on
 in their room through the boards above our head.
 Yeah.
 It was just like, "Oh, my God."
 The ceiling was literally the floor.
 There was no concept of a subfloor or sound installation or it was so noisy.
 So loud.
 And every time you drill over in bed, you'd be like, "Okay, guys, I'm just rolling over in bed.
 I'm not doing anything else."
 There's nothing else going on here because it was so loud.
 Oh, good Lord.
 Yeah.
 So I was sick.
 How was it?
 I didn't see any of the weekend.
 I mean, wow, we have an amazing team.
 Who was my stand-in for the speaking?
 I was.
 Oh, so they got the better half.
 Yes, they got the better half.
 Yes, so I just did your sessions and then of course you know Shannon and Matt teach some of it and then Sarah Pape makes us all look good.
 So it's a great team.
 It was easy enough to let you rest.
 And the scenery was amazing.
 Beautiful.
 Like this is when I like nature from the inside of an air conditioned cabin.
 Well, you did go out on the porch to fly the drone.
 I know, but it was super cool.
 It was hardly any humidity.
 Yeah, it was beautiful.
 And it was gorgeous at night.
 Yeah.
 And I got up early one morning to try and get the sunrises before I got sick, but I didn't do a good job.
 I don't think we were facing the right way for the sunrise.
 No word of a lie.
 We certainly got a good sunset.
 No word of a lie.
 I had to Google what direction the sun rises in.
 And I'm sure like this is common knowledge.
 And then I had to pull up the compass on my phone to work at which we East is.
 Okay.
 But you know it always rises in the East and all the sets and all that.
 It always does.
 Is that the same in Australia?
 Or does it get reversed?
 Well, that's an excellent question. I really think about that.
 Don't think about it. Just Google it. Oh, all right.
 Okay. This is what Google says. "In the southern hemisphere, the sun still rises in the east and
 sets on the west. This is because the movement of the sun in the sky is caused by the earth's
 rotation and the northern and southern hemisphere are obviously rotating in the same direction."
 Yes. That would make sense. Yeah, but you didn't know it.
 Well, I was wondering, because I know it's because of the way the earth rotates, why it would be any
 different. But then they're all, I mean, I'm thinking about like the toilets flush different
 ways down there and whatever. Maybe I'm missing something.
 All right. Yeah. I'm glad we have that sorted out. I can sleep now.
 Well, now I don't feel so bad for having a Google, you know, what direction it rises over here.
 I do know what's when it rises and sets in the country I live in without Google.
 I'm pretty sure nobody ever told me that.
 Yeah, so it was a great, it was a great weekend.
 We got to float down the river, which of course you didn't get to do because you were in bed.
 Nope.
 And somebody left a dead possum that was disintegrating by the place where you jump off on the rocks.
 So that was lovely as well.
 Did Hunter deal with that?
 He said he doesn't deal with dead animals.
 If it was alive, he would have taken care of it.
 But because it was already disintegrating, it was avoided.
 What else happened?
 Um, all the eclipse.
 Yeah, the eclipse.
 You didn't get to see it because you were sick.
 No.
 I mean, I went out on my friend step and saw what I could see from our house.
 But we weren't in the path.
 No, we were like a couple miles off the path.
 So I didn't see total darkness.
 It got dark, but not like total darkness.
 Did you see the video I filmed?
 By the way, I posted it on Instagram.
 Yeah, I saw it.
 It was pretty dark where we were.
 It looked dark.
 We were in the path of total...
 Total...
 ...totally.
 Was it total?
 As that what they said?
 Total...
 ...totally.
 It was so weird because as it was fading out,
 Like it took a long time to fade out.
 I was like, this is taking way longer than I was anticipating.
 But when it actually gets to the point where it's just about to reach totality,
 it totally looks like a weird Instagram filter has now affected all of life.
 Yeah, like a greeny kind of color.
 Yeah.
 And then it went pitch black.
 All the streetlights came on.
 The cicadas.
 Is that cicadas?
 Is that what they're called?
 Well, probably it's crickets.
 Crickets.
 It's probably not cicadas.
 They started doing their thing and it was so weird.
 and for two minutes were in till darkness and then very first.
 Yeah.
 So I had all of that, the weird green filter and all that, just not the total darkness.
 You missed that, baby.
 It was amazing.
 I was sad about that.
 You know what else happened?
 That was almost as big as the eclipse.
 What?
 This week we opened up our listener survey.
 Oh, yes, we did.
 If you go to alanaj.com/survey, we are collecting feedback from people just like you
 who are listening to this podcast.
 And it's great because you get to speak to us about what you love, what you would
 like to change, how we can make it better for you.
 We get to know a little bit about you.
 I have read every single bit of feedback that came in.
 Oh, wow.
 Every email that comes in, I read it personally and then I will share with you
 the aggregate data already.
 I've been super encouraged and you guys are giving me some great ideas.
 In fact, the topic for tonight is from somebody who said I would love it if you
 would teach on this.
 So congratulations.
 Whoever sent that in.
 And even how you opened the episode was for some feedback as well.
 Yeah.
 Somebody said, "Hey, it would be really good because when we listen to these back-to-back,
 we can't really tell when one has finished in another start."
 So if you could tell us the topic that you're listening to, it helps us work out which one
 you're listening to.
 So I'm like, "I can do that easily."
 So I'm trying that.
 So anyway, if you could take the time, go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/survey.
 We would love it.
 It also gives you an opportunity to win $100 worth of prizes, some Amazon vouchers or iTunes
 vouchers, whatever you'd like.
 So please, if you haven't already done that, it's going to stay up for another week.
 We'd love to hear from you.
 All right shall we talk about our main topic let's talk about main topic baby so our main topic is stewarding the prophetic words over your life as in so you got a prophetic word.
 Now what right right what do I do with it now that I have it so we have a couple of suggestions for you maybe a little a little less of things to do with your prophetic words not necessarily any order.
 Yes, but at some point probably do all of these things.
 All right.
 The first thing that we would suggest when you get a prophetic word, doesn't matter who it's from is you want to test the word you want to weigh the word.
 In the New Testament, we're told to do both of those things.
 For example, in first Thessalonians 5.20 says, do not treat prophecies with contempt. That's a good one.
 But test all things, hold fast to what is good. Basically, any New Testament prophet or anybody who's prophesying,
 It's really, really clear that they know in part, they see in part, and so they prophesy
 in part.
 What that means is part of the word is going to be really, really good, and part of the
 word is possible.
 They've made a mistake depending on the maturity of person, depending on the gifting level.
 No profit is a hundred percent accurate.
 So you want to eat the meat, spare the bones.
 The most obvious test is to filter and sift the word through scripture.
 Yes.
 prophetic word that says, "You know what, the Lord really says that you are to divorce
 your wife and marry a younger model."
 That's not the Lord speaking because it's really clear in Scripture what he feels about
 that.
 So you can know that's not the Lord.
 Right.
 So if there's kind of weird stuff in there, if there's not Scripture stuff, throw it out.
 But let's say it is Scripture.
 Let's say it's really, really good.
 What would weighing and testing look like in that scenario?
 Well, I think it looks like a couple of different things.
 I think it looks like inviting people into your journey with you to help you weigh and
 test it.
 So people that you know that are in relationship with you, maybe people that are a little bit
 further down the road, invite them into the word and ask them to help you sort of weigh
 it.
 Sure.
 Play it for them.
 Yeah.
 Let your leaders hear it, get your friends in and pray through it.
 And you get to have a sense of, does this feel like the Lord?
 Is this, what is it?
  </li><li>Maddy's bringing me chocolate.
  </li><li>Excuse me, my wife is just getting chocolate
 handle liver to her while I'll just sit and watch.
 I'll get my own back.
 There's some lemon sorbet in the freezer.
 She knows nothing about this.
 Hey baby, what have you got there?
  </li><li>Chocolate.
  </li><li>You just had somebody hand deliver chocolate to you
 and you're gonna eat it in front of your husband
 who's not eating chocolate.
  </li><li>Yeah, these are extreme days.
 These are extreme days they call for extreme measures.
 I, uh, we're going to go back to eating healthy tomorrow.
 And so I was like, through a crash into the wind, I really want some honeycomb covered
 in dark chocolate.
 And I happened to know that my neighbor bought some because she sent me a picture
 of it two days ago.
 So I just texted her and said, Hey, are you home?
 Can I have some chocolate?
 So she sent one of her sweet children up with a, uh, an offering, a chocolate offering.
 One last great hurrah.
 Do you want to hear how crunchy it is?
 Yeah, sure.
 I mean, it's fantastic.
 OK, that's going to be gross for anybody listening to that tomorrow.
 So OK, I'll do the talking in your microphone.
 All right.
 So the first thing you've done in is you've weighed the word.
 You've tested the word.
 So the second thing, and not a lot of people realize this, but most new
 Testament prophetic words are invitations from the Lord.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 They're not declarations like this is going to happen.
 some of them are, but the vast majority of them are invitations.
  </li><li>They're, "Hey, do you wanna?"
  </li><li>So at some point, it's the Lord saying,
 "You've been asking me what do you have for my life?
 "This is me showing, now I need a response."
 So it's good to actually say yes.
  </li><li>Yes, yeah, and I think,
 you know, that was one of the things
 that I spoke on a few weeks ago is,
 I think there's even stages of your yes sometimes,
 you know, where there's sort of a--
  </li><li>A begrudging, yes.
  </li><li>Begrudging or reluctant, yes.
 And then sometimes there's a resigned yes.
 But hopefully eventually we get to an excited yes, where it's a wholehearted thing.
 Right.
 Um, but that's what he's looking for.
 Is that wholehearted?
 Yes.
 All right.
 Third thing, baby.
 Now that your mouth is free of chocolate.
 Well, it's still got someone on the outside, but it's all good.
 Um, the third thing is that prophetic words really are a diving board
 into a pool of prayer.
 So the, the deal is you want to keep them before you and then just pray them
 back to the Lord, you know, let them fuel your journey with the Lord.
 Um, there's a great example of this in scripture in 2 Samuel seven.
 This is one of my favorite passages of scripture.
 Yeah.
 It's amazing.
 Basically, Nathan comes in and gives David the best prophetic word ever.
 Right.
 And then look at what David does.
 Yeah.
 David turns around a couple of verses later and he actually speaks the
 prophetic word back to the Lord.
 I love it.
 Yeah.
 It's like he receives it from the Lord.
 It's mind blowing.
 And then it says, like in verse 18,
 he goes in and sits before the Lord
 and just reads the word straight back to him.
 I've done that so many times.
 I've taken the prophetic words that Lord's given
 and I've just said, Lord, you said,
 not like in a challenging way,
 but like just reminding the Lord
 and reminding myself really of the words
 that the Lord's spoken.
  </li><li>It's kind of like using your words
 to fight the good fight, isn't it?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's just like, okay, actually.
 And especially when, you know, there are seasons
 where you have a word that is, seems so contrary,
 or so much better than actually what you're living in
 at the moment.
 Well, let the hope rise up in you
 and fight a good fight with that word.
 Partner your hope and your faith
 towards God actually telling you the truth.
 Yeah, so quite fun.
 All right, give me number four.
 Number four, believe it or not,
 most prophetic words take a while to come to fruition.
 right. And whereby a while you mean a lot longer than you or I would think or want.
 Right. Well, we're a fast food generation, right? So we want everything fast. And we're
 annoyed if we have to wait for any length of time. So sometimes, you know, you get a
 prophetic word or in your, or you hear somebody get a prophetic word. And two weeks later,
 they're like, well, hasn't happened yet. And you're just like, are you joking?
 What year did we first meet David Wagner?
 Oh, um...
 Well, what year was MJ born in?
 And then take...
 2012.
 Was... Oh, wow.
 So we went David in 2011.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 So the first time we meet David Wagner,
 actually, it wasn't the first time we met him.
 He spoke Sunday morning.
 We said hello.
 And then that night he was speaking at Iris National now,
 Legacy National.
 And he was ministering there and we went to hear him.
 We didn't know him really at all.
 Like I said, we'd met him that morning.
 and he was prophesying up a storm.
 At 10, 30, we need to get home to get, you don't release our babysitters.
 And so we just try to sneak out the meeting.
 Right.
 And he stops us and he just says, "Allen, AJ."
 And he gives us this huge prophetic word.
 But in the prophetic word, he says, "The Lord's given you Iceland."
 Yeah.
 "The Lord is going to take you back to travel.
 I see you going all over the world.
 I hear you saying to yourselves, 'Can we go to Europe for the weekend?'
 And the Lord says, 'Yes, you can.'
 Now, I get that word, 2011.
 Yep.
 I came home that night and I did a research on all the frequent flyer programs based on
 America's, we'd stop traveling.
 Yeah.
 So I did all my research on, should I be with United?
 Should I be with American Airlines?
 Should I be with Delta?
 I made sure my passport was up to date and I had it written, not because I thought the
 next morning I want to start traveling the nations, but part of me wanted to show the
 Lord, Lord, I'm taking this seriously.
 I'm saying absolutely yes.
 Yeah, you're partnering your faith with action and saying, I'm going to prepare my life
 to be ready so that when the go time comes, I'm ready to go.
 I don't have to get the stuff ready.
 I should have been getting ready already.
 And then for the next four or five years, we didn't travel anywhere.
 That's right.
 When did we go to Iceland?
 Actually, we went last summer, so 2016.
 So 2016, so five years past.
 Five years.
 We go to Iceland for the weekend.
 For the weekend.
 And we say to each other, can you believe we're going to Europe for the weekend?
 And we remember David's word over us.
 So I mean, all that all our prophecies would come a passing within five years.
 My point was that night when I went home to get everything ready and, you know, we
 weren't bought luggage.
 Do you remember that?
 I went and bought new luggage.
 You did too.
 My little to me.
 Oh, yeah, you did.
 Yeah.
 So when got luggage, I researched the global visa entry program or if that's called, you know, I, I just
 researched everything because I was like, Oh, I want to take this.
 And I knew not to think this, this is a tomorrow word, but at the same time, you
 You know, the word hasn't come to pass.
 I mean, it has in a par.
 I'm not down with David's prophetic pedigree by any stretch.
 I'm just saying, it always takes way longer
 than you think it will.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And you can't get discouraged about that
 because you actually do want God's timing for things
 'cause that's when it's gonna be best.
  </li><li>Right.
 If the spirit of prophecy is the testament of Jesus,
 remember that Jesus himself in Revelation says,
 "Look, I'm coming soon."
 And it's been several times in Christ's life.
 So there you go.
 Number five.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Sometimes, and you touched on this earlier,
 sometimes your prophetic words are given
 because the season of life that you're about to enter
 are gonna look like the total opposite
 of the prophetic word that you got.
 And the reason that the Lord does that is he's so kind.
 He knows this season is coming,
 and he knows if you didn't have a prophetic word
 to hang on to it, you'd be like,
 what the heck, Lord, what just happened?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So you get the prophetic word,
 and then it seems like the exact opposite happens,
 And you're like, gosh, I guess the prophet missed it.
 No, it's the kindness of the Lord.
 Hold on to that word to get you through the season.
 It looks like the opposite.
 Because when you get out on the other end,
 you'll be thankful you had the word.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I've honestly used lots of prophetic words
 over the years that have been given to me
 as a lifeline in a dark season.
  </li><li>Because the season looked like the opposite
 of what your word was. - As the opposite.
  </li><li>Isn't that so funny? - Isn't that so funny?
  </li><li>Did you think the prophet had got it wrong?
  </li><li>I did.
 You know, at different times I really did.
 because it's easy to get discouraged.
 But yeah, I mean, I would have this sort of reoccurring
 visual of just sort of hanging on to God
 and just keep pushing towards the end of the tunnel
 kind of thing.
 So yeah.
  </li><li>It was funny because I was teaching at the belonging
 this week and I was teaching on the whole thing
 of you've got to believe God.
 You've got to actually say yes to what he's saying.
 You've got to agree with him.
 And I was talking about how many years ago
 I lived in Scotland, I was a school teacher.
 all of the prophetic words that the Lord would give me in private. Many of them have come to pass,
 but they seemed unimaginable when the Lord would speak to me. I'm a school teacher. The most
 pressing thing in my life was a PTA meeting. And yet the Lord would be saying, "I'm going to send
 you to the nations. You're going to see deaf ears open. You're going to teach people to hear
 my voice all over the world." And I was like, "Lord, how is that ever going to happen?"
 And then within three, four, five years,
 exactly what the Lord had prophesied had come to pass.
 Now, I can't imagine my life without prophecy.
  </li><li>Right.
 I can't do that.
  </li><li>I wouldn't want it.
  </li><li>No.
 All right, number six is take the doors
 that lead towards your prophetic words.
 So in obedience, respond to doors that are opening
 that seem to align with your prophetic words.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But that doesn't mean force them open.
 That means in obedience, when they open,
 you start to walk through.
 Right, because we've done that in our life.
 We've seen that in the lives of the people we lead.
 They get a prophetic word.
 Hey, you know what the Lord's called you.
 I see a great anointing of worship on you.
 And then they're frustrated that next week the pastor
 hasn't made them the worship pastor.
  </li><li>Right, but there's other opportunities
 that are given to them, hey, you could help
 with worship for the kids or you could help
 with worship for this small group or whatever,
 but because it doesn't look like the grandiose-ness
 yet of the word, they don't see the baby stages
 of the word and the opportunity there.
 I mean, my example that was I felt like the Lord said I was going to be a teacher.
 I didn't know how that was going to work.
 You know, I wasn't a public speaker.
 I didn't like children.
 I didn't really like humans.
 And yeah, in the midst of that, just shortly after receiving that word, I got asked by
 my church, "Would you be a speaker at a youth camp?"
 And again, I was like, "No, like, what?"
 I don't like youth.
 No.
 You know, no.
 And then I was just thinking, "Well, actually, the only prophetic words I've got are
 Be you know i want you to be a teacher so that while try right and that was you know that was my first ministry get ever is that the one where you dressed up like an angel yeah that that was that season yeah dressed up like an angel i need to find that video.
 It's a great thing double oh heaven.
 Double oh heaven yeah license to fill that's what i should start calling you hate double oh heaven.
 Yeah, you should.
 So yeah, the road to destiny is marked by many steps of obscurity.
 It is indeed.
 All right.
 Seventh and final thing.
 Go for it.
 You've got to understand that your prophetic words are easier to understand in hindsight
 than they are in foresight because if you try to guess what they mean inevitably, you're
 going to miss it.
 So you, you know, the classic example, classic biblical example is Abraham with Isaac and
 the Lord's going to give me a son. Oh my gosh, it's taking forever. He obviously just
 meant sleep with my wife's handmaiden. Let me help him. Totally. So I think about the
 prophetic words that we've received. Like I remember the word that got us here, all our
 words talked to us about church planting and pestering. Right. Right. Now those were the
 words that got us to move to Nashville. Since we've moved to Nashville, we have not
 church planted. Nope. We have not planned any church. Nope. But that language got us here.
 Yes. So is the word wrong? No, because like we planted emanate, we've planted eso asal.
 And the church we came to was a church plant.
 But what I mean is like if the Lord had been more specific, I mean, the amazing thing about
 the Lord is he loves to speak in vagueness so we can explore possibilities. Right.
 If you think about like a pastoring, would you say that we're pastors today?
 I know. No, in the eyes of the church, though, that we would be considered pastors, but
 we didn't have the revelation of the fivefold until two years ago.
 So almost 10 years ago when the Lord started speaking to about this, he had to use the language
 that was familiar to us. So the word, "Hey, you guys are church planners and your pastors,
 help us arrive here where we have planted stuff and we have helped pastor." But what we tend to do
 is certainly within the confines of that word, but is different from that word.
 Right.
 And you'll find too that your word isn't probably finished yet.
 Right.
 Often the Lord gives us a portion of a word to help us move in the right direction.
 Because if he told us the whole thing of what, you know, the grand destiny that he has for us,
 probably we'd all just freeze and get, you know, freaked out.
 So in his kindness, he leads us with language that we understand and opens doors to start to nudge us towards actually what he has for us.
 So it's very cool.
 All right.
 Anything else you want to add on stewarding your prophetic words?
 I don't, I don't think so.
 I think, I think the main thing is just keep saying yes to God.
 Right.
 You know, that because it is an invitation and it remains an invitation that you keep saying yes.
 And as you go to deeper levels of sometimes the exact same prophetic word, just keep saying yes.
 I think also the most practical thing I'd encourage anybody to listen to this is get your
 prophetic words out, re-listen to them, type them out so you can read them. Because you can read
 fast and you can listen. Keep your prophetic words in front of you, review them, write them on your
 mirror, use them to challenge your environment. And that alone is one of the best steps you can have
 and stepping into your destiny.
  </li><li>Yeah, or highlight and circle things
 that appear in more than one word.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, start to pay attention to,
 wow, I heard that, you know, two years ago
 and again there and again there
 and start to talk to the Lord about those things.
 You know, okay God, you keep saying this,
 can we talk about that?
 What do you, you know, how do I prepare for that?
  </li><li>All right, you look like you're ready
 for some listeners questions.
  </li><li>I'm so ready for a listener question.
  </li><li>What's interesting is all three questions this week,
 We're all sent in anonymously.
  </li><li>Does that mean we're scaring people now?
  </li><li>No, I mean, it will kind of make sense
 when you read them, but I was like,
 "Oh, this is interesting."
 All right, this first one, now listen, I apologize.
 This is a longish question, but it's such a good question.
 I'm gonna start, I'm gonna read a bit,
 we'll answer a bit of it, read a bit more,
 answer a bit of it, but I think it's gonna be super helpful.
 All right, this is the question from
 anonymous listener number one.
 Dear Alan and AJ, my question is about being part
 the local church body in a small town. Part of the context is that my wife and I are
 having very serious marriage problems and my wife has resisted any marriage help beside
 her parents. My wife is a believer but does not want to go to a local church, though I
 really do. Her parents who live in our town like the idea of being part of a local church
 but seem to find something wrong with most churches they have visited over the years
 and feel they are all too religious among other things. Let me just stop there.
 The first thing I want to say is if you go to church to spectate, you inevitably become
 a referee.
 Yeah, there's no perfect churches.
 You're not going to find one that doesn't have stuff that you could criticize or focus
 on negatively.
 Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 And not doing something against a clear direction of Scripture doesn't actually make you more
 spiritual.
 Right.
 So, okay, we continue.
 There are a couple of churches within a two-hour drive of a similar to Grace Center, but that's
 not feasible for us.
 And I don't think they would like that church anyway.
 There are a couple of local churches I'd like to check out that they're not nearly
 as holy, spiritual, or prophetic, etc.
 But they are active in the community and they love Jesus the best I can tell.
 Recently, I tried to bring up the subject again when my wife and I were together with
 her family and said how much I'd like to go to a local church, even if it's not perfect
 and just be part of the solution, as opposed to just avoiding it, to get involved and serve
 where we can.
 Her mum told me I was wrong in this thought that most churches in our town are not following
 the Lord and would be unhealthy to attend and that until we get our marriage right,
 we can't really plug in anywhere even in a good church because we would be hypocrites.
 I disagree.
 I'm just going to leave a really long pause here because that's got to be one of the
 most insane statements I've ever read.
 I'm shocked by that.
 Right, because I'm totally shocked by that.
 The notion that you can't go to church until your marriage is right is crazy.
 How are you supposed to get your marriage right if you're not getting input?
 That's like waiting till you feel better before you go to a hospital.
 Wow.
 I forget who it was.
 I should have looked up the quote, but there's a brilliant quote by a really wise old man
 who said this church used to be a lifeboat rescuing the perishing, but has become a cruise ship
 attracting the promising.
 So I can see where you might come up with this weird twisted thing that, you know,
 if I'm going to church where every shiny and happy, I need to be shiny and happy,
 but that's really not the reason you go to church.
 Well, and hopefully you're not choosing to go to a shiny happy church,
 but you're actually choosing to go to a church where you could potentially get
 some healing. Right. Well, the point is you go to church out of obedience to Jesus
 is teaching. Right. Because if we all stayed away from church until we were to send
 free, we'd never go to church. Right.
 So with all due respect to your mother-in-law, she's absolutely incorrect about that.
 Yeah.
 So let's keep reading.
 Anonymous writes, "My options are to stay compliant or to visit some churches on my own,
 though this would be seen as being defined of my wife and her parents, who also claim
 spiritual authority over us both.
 I recently read the boundaries in marriage book, but I'm struggling with how to apply it right now."
 OK, this is my second great pause.
 Because there are so many things wrong with that sentence.
 First off, your parents don't have spiritual authority over you guys.
 But that's totally backwards.
 Now that you and your wife are married, you're your own unit.
 Right.
 So all the way through scripture says, for this reason, a man should leave his
 mother and father and be united with his wife and they should become one flesh,
 I.e. one operating unit.
 So it sounds like either you or her haven't left.
 Yeah.
 And you didn't do the leaving or the leaving.
 Yeah, well, hopefully you've done the cleaving part, but you haven't done the leaving part.
 So, when you say, "Hey, we're having marriage difficulties," and I don't know what they
 are, I would imagine just that dynamic right there would be feeding some of your marriage
 difficulties for sure.
 Yeah.
 Any comment, Aja, Joey?
 Yeah, I just totally agree with what you're saying, babe.
 I don't think, like, I think it's wonderful to have parents that are believers that can
 give you input, but not parents that direct to you or control you. Does that make sense?
 Right.
 So, in particular, when it seems like what we're talking about is you're wanting to go to church,
 and they're not seeming to want you or your wife to go to church, it's not like they're
 directing you in a way that would be scripturally sound.
 Right.
 So yeah, I just, I mean, just the thought of like, wow, okay, so this is, yeah, boundaries are so
 necessary in marriage. Right. They're so necessary. Everybody wants to have an opinion or have a say
 if you let them. Right. But you kind of can't if you're going to have a healthy marriage.
 One of the factors in the health of our marriage would be that we have upheld boundaries. Yes.
 that both of us it's not like i think there's a misconception that people think cuz i teach on boundaries i'm the boundary person in our marriage right but heck no i mean and here's the difficulty it sounds like you sir.
 Are spotting some of these problems but it sounds like perhaps your wife isn't that's unfair cuz i heard from your wife right but for example it is my job to protect our marriage from my side of the family and it's a job to protect our marriage from her side of the family right.
 and we're in agreement about that yeah and so.
 Here's a difficulty if you agree with us but your wife doesn't it's difficult to see how you can actually set up the boundaries unless you're in in one accord and probably one of the reasons you're not in one accord is she hasn't left.
 Her parents authority and her parents are asserting authority over you guys which is a whole web of and maybe her parents parents did that to them so they all think it's normal right yeah.
 So have them listen to this podcast accidentally and have fun with that anyway that it continues any thoughts for those of us who only have a small church to attend but would love to attend a place like grace and if it were closer,
 though it may be far from perfect and doesn't have the same level of resources or prophetic etc as grace or somewhere like battle and any thoughts on my situation.
 I don't want to make things worse in my marriage, but it feels very one-sided and controlling for my wife to be so against me even visiting a church,
 and there could be many good reasons to go with or without her.
 I mean, I think just as an aside, I'm wondering if maybe your wife and your wife's parents have been really hurt at a church,
 and maybe that's more what's going on than anything else.
 I'm just wondering if there's some level of pain associated with church, so the risk for them
 just feels like it's way too much. So it's just easier to say, well, that's not a good church.
 Oh, and that's not a good church. I think your situation is, it's really difficult.
 Yeah, we're really sorry. But it sounds very, very hard. I think you touched on this earlier,
 babe, where you said no church is perfect. There really aren't perfect churches.
 but for me like we're blessed we go to an amazing church like we love grace center.
 It's an absolute joy to be there we absolutely love it and grace and isn't perfect there's things that we staff would love to do differently there's stuff that there's lots of room to grow for sure yeah,
 but when picking a church for the bare minimum you want a church that loves Jesus,
 Preaches the gospel teaches the word.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Those three things are non-negotiable.
 Everything else is preferential.
 Right.
 So the vast majority of my Christian life has not been spent in a church like Grey Center.
 It was spent in a small local church with none of the propheticness, none of the Holy Spiritness,
 but they were all churches that loved Jesus, preached the gospel, taught the word of God.
 in you found community there and you grew.
 You know, I'm the man I am because of the church I went to.
 Right.
 Like the, the, the foundation of everything I have is because of the churches I was raised in and I'm super grateful for them.
 Did I want to leave when I found out more about the charismatic churches and these didn't seem open to sure?
 Did the Lord say stay put?
 Yeah.
 Am I glad?
 Yeah.
 I've got some of the longest long lasting friendships in my life because of my, my church I'm bringing.
 So my encouragement is Scripture is so clear about believers attending church.
 So if you can find a church that meets those three things, then you really need to be there.
 It's a biblical instruction. It's an expectation Jesus had. We've covered this a lot in episode 65,
 episode 142, and probably in every other episode because we're huge believers of the local church.
 Yes.
 I was talking to Matt on the way home in the car as we're driving home from our
 smoke when they're training. And I was saying, do you remember when I've
 teach you on finances and tithing? And I think I had a dream and in the dream,
 the Holy Spirit said, stop asking me to rebuke a devourer, you keep feeding.
 Right. And it's that whole thing of, it's funny how people will ask God to bless them financially,
 but won't obey what he said in order to achieve the blessing. Right. Right. So we are disobedient
 and we don't factor our disobedience in, we just ask for more blessing.
 Right.
 We'd rather more blessing than have to be obedient.
 Well, it's funny because in this is another situation of that, you've got believers all over the world
 asking God to bless them without them having to be obedient.
 So we ask God for a great church, for example, but we don't go to any church.
 I'm like, be obedient, first go to a church and then ask for a blessing on that church.
 It's like, hey, God, I'd really like to be obedient, but I won't be obedient until you give me my preferences.
 Right.
 That's mental.
 Yeah.
 So, yeah, I mean, I spent the vast majority of my Christian life in a church that didn't
 meet my preferences, but it was good for me.
 So what are you doing in your situation?
 Bro, your situation is so convoluted.
 Yeah, there's a lot going on there.
 It would be foolish of us to just jump in and expect to have answers, but a few thoughts
 for you.
 Sounds like your wife and you are going to need to set some boundaries with your parents in law,
 which could be interesting because your wife might quite like the way it's set up.
 So explore that with a wisdom.
 Or maybe she doesn't. Maybe she just doesn't know it can be set up differently.
 Right.
 Next thing is you guys really need to be part of a local church.
 Yeah.
 If your wife doesn't want to go, at least you go.
 Yeah.
 Because you'll be blessed for that and good fruit will come from that for sure.
 And then number three, I guess I'm preaching to the choir here.
 You're going to need some help in your marriage.
 And it's not going to be helpful to come from your parents in law.
 Because if it was your marriage, it would be better than it currently is.
 So oh, yeah, your in-laws can't be your counselors.
 I mean, I don't care how healthy they are or how healthy your marriage is.
 That's probably never going to be a good scenario.
 That's a very strong reaction.
 Well, yeah, I can't.
 You wouldn't want to land on typing to talking to you about sex or finances?
 No, why?
 So strange.
 Yes, you did.
 Yeah, you absolutely did.
 So there's not a lot of help that you can get for yourself.
 God doesn't design us to thrive in isolation.
 We're designed to be in community.
 So we're, I hope that's helpful.
 Probably all the stuff you already knew that you needed to be doing.
 So hopefully hearing a confirmation that would be helpful.
 All right.
 I've got a question for you, AJ, are you ready?
 Okay. This is another question from another anonymous person. Okay.
 In regards to the fivefold ministry in figuring out direction,
 as what I like to think is being a mature Christian, how would you respond to church leaders
 encouraging people to step out of their comfort zones versus leadership trying to push a square
 peg into a round hole? If you really don't think a ministry is for you, should you still step out
 of your comfort zone to try knowing that God has your back anyway? I think what this question is
 asking is what are you doing in a situation where your leaders are giving you opportunities
 that don't necessarily fit your gift mix or you don't feel like this is what you're
 called to?
 So I guess honestly in that situation, I think if your leaders are offering you to try something
 in there or they're just saying, "Hey, could you help us out with this?"
 I don't think it has to be your calling to help out your leader and actually just go,
 "Yeah, you know what?
 I can help with that or I can try with that."
 I, in Toronto, I served in so many different areas that I wouldn't have said or my calling,
 but because they asked me to, and there was a need there, I was happy to help because
 that's the church that I go to.
 And really, honestly, I didn't even think I was called to speak or to minister, but I
 only ended up doing it because John made me.
 Right.
 in your current life, you didn't think you could do what you're so clearly
 to do. Right. So I would say, yeah, try it. What, I mean, how could it, how it's not gonna hurt.
 There we go. Right. So you'll learn things about yourself. You may learn that you don't like it.
 You may learn that you do like it. You may learn that it's part of whatever you're called to. But
 I always think, you know, if you have healthy leaders that are offering something to you and
 and saying, "Hey, would you try this?
 I think this might be something that you're called to."
 Or even if they're just saying, "Hey, we need help."
 I would say try it.
 I think I don't think you can lose in that situation.
  </li><li>Very good. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, I agree.
 All right, our third and final question.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Again, it's about fivefold.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
  </li><li>Why'd you say, "Oh dear."
  </li><li>Well, because you're the guy that knows about the fivefold.
  </li><li>Oh, sure, I'm the fivefold guy.
  </li><li>You're the fivefold guy.
  </li><li>Right.
 Go on and ask me the question.
  </li><li>Okay, so it says, "I listened to your podcast
 and it's been incredibly encouraging.
 My question relates to your sermon series from a few weeks ago in the five-fold ministry.
 My wife and I recently became elders in our local church and we co-lead it with other
 couples.
 It's clear that the gifts you talked about are evident in their lives and while I can
 see some of the gift of prophecy in my life in particular, I don't think it's my primary
 one.
 believe that my primary gifting is administration, management and organization.
 And I wondered how that fitted with your description of fivefold ministry.
 You hinted at the gifts of administration in one of your talks, but didn't elaborate.
 Thanks for any advice and guidance you can give.
 All right.
 Well, briefly, the fivefold, I think, is like the spokes of a wheel or like the hub of the
 wheel.
 I think there's clearly more gifts mentioned in the scripture than just the five gifts
 of Apostle Prophet Pastor Teacher Evangelist.
 Right.
 So in 1 Corinthians 12, for example, Paul writes when he's talking about the order, he says,
 "First are apostles, second are prophets, third are teachers."
 And then he goes on, "And evangelists and pastors aren't even mentioned on that list."
 So it's not that pastors and evangelists aren't important, they're just not mentioned on this
 list, but the other gifts that are mentioned would be those who do miracles, those who
 of the gift of healing, those who can help others, those who have the gift of leadership,
 those who speak in unknown languages.
 Well I'm reading there from the New Living Translation.
 If you look at it in the NASB says God's appointed in the church, first apostle, second
 prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gift of healings, helps, administrations,
 various kinds of tongues.
 So it's clear like there's a huge scope of gifts within the church.
 You don't need to be one of the five.
 the big five that's mentioned in the five-fold ministry
 to have a place in the life of the church, for sure.
 And the other thing is you tend to grow
 into an understanding of your gifts.
 Like, clearly one of the strongest gifts
 of my life is that of the teaching gift.
 Well, I didn't know that originally.
 It took other people to tell me,
 hey, when you teach, I learn.
 Like there's something on your life that when you teach,
 I find it really easy to follow that.
 Well, I didn't walk in and go, "Hey, guys, I'm kind of a big deal here.
 I'm kind of a teacher. If you just sit down, let me just wow you with my teaching gift."
 It's not the way it worked.
 Like, I just practiced things and then people began to tell me what it was.
 So, no, you don't have to have one of the five.
 You can have any of the myriad of gifts lifted in Scripture, including some that aren't even listed.
 But for example, you mentioned there that you think or you would identify that you have a strong gift
 administration or organization or oversight. That's a genuine gift. There's people in our ministry
 that the Holy Spirit has anointed them in this area. Daniel Halson, who's talked about, who
 worked with us for years, still works with us. She's our chief administrator at Gray Center.
 I mean, there is an anointing of the Holy Spirit on her to administrate. She can do it with ease,
 is order, there is structure, her being connected to Jeff as an apostle is just the best version
 of her gift in operation. And so you may find that that's your gift, but honestly, part of
 Christian life is walking out and seeing what you are. I think we've dabbled in a lot of them in
 our lives. I can think of times where the most dominant gift in my life was evangelism.
 Yeah, more so than teaching. And so, you know, it's, it's not that it's ebbs and flows, but I,
 I think the Holy Spirit will work in you, whatever's needed in that season. And then eventually,
 people begin to look at you and call it out. Church leadership begins to recognize what it is.
 And before you know it, you recognize, oh, I'm moving in one of these gifts. So,
 I don't know if that's helpful. I think, see where your gifts take you. Like, you know, my big
 journey in life is like how do I know from a profit or how do I know from a
 puzzle or how do I know from an evangelist.
 My advice is just see where does your gift take you?
 Yeah.
 Keep prophesying and others will tell you to.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And see how far your gift takes you.
 Yeah.
 Good, baby.
 All right.
