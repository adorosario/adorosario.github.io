<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is miss Jones yes sir is it true statement that we're the best we've ever looked while recording a podcast yes it is and why is that
 Because we were just at Blake and Elena's wedding.
 We were, which we're going to talk about in a second.
 Looking good takes a lot of work.<br/>
 It does.<br/>
 And you tend to be quite uncomfortable.
 Yes.<br/>
 I mean, depending on what you're wearing, like, well, I'm wearing shoes I never wear.
 And there is your spanks.<br/>
 I mean, they're pretty uncomfortable.<br/>
 Takes me ages to get into those.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 So worth it.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 No, but for real, I took in a shirt.<br/>
 I never wear a tucked in shirt.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I put a tie on.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I wore heels.<br/>
 Yeah, we're just making sacrifices for everybody.
 I know.<br/>
 East National, you are welcome.<br/>
 We'll talk tonight.<br/>
 You know what?<br/>
 I don't often get to say what feels like we talked about sex a lot this week.
 Well, yes, I suppose we did speak about sex a lot this week.
 I was teaching on the school this week about sex.
 You were.<br/>
 And the full spectrum of sex.<br/>
 It was our sexual healing week.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 thank you for clarifying with the full spectrum of sex.
 Well sex, sexuality,<br/>
 God's design for sex, sexual sin, sexual demons, homosexuality,
 deliverance, the whole shebang, the whole shebang.
 It was a lot of fun. I love it.<br/>
 I'm not sure how our students survived.
 They always do survive though.<br/>
 Yeah, it's rough going through it, but once we're done with the week,
 everybody looks much brighter and happier.
 It's true. Meanwhile, while I was teaching on sex, you got what?
 Meanwhile, back at the ranch, I was speaking on the sunship.
 How come you got sonship and I got sex?
 Because I'm the one that does the scheduling.
 Two shade.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Well, I had fun listening to all the students talking about how awesome your
 sonship talk was this week.<br/>
 Yeah, I had, uh, it was all new material.
 And, you know, of course we've spoken on sonship before, um, but I just did an
 enormous amount of research last week.
 And the Lord showed me all this stuff that I'd just never seen before.
 So it was quite funny because a number of the students were like, Oh, man, it
 blew my mind and I'm thinking, "Blue my mind." I spent the week going, "Oh, that explains
 so much, God."<br/>
 Those are the best weeks, aren't they?
 They're so fun to do.<br/>
 You know what it feels like to me? It feels like one of those rollers that you kind of
 roll on your sweater and get rid of fuzz.
 A lint roller?<br/>
 A lint roller. That's what sometimes teaching is like for me. You have a lint roller, which
 is a collective body of work. And then you go through the week just praying and asking
 Holy Spirit and it feels like you pick up revelation on your lint ruler.
 It's a terrible analogy.<br/>
 I'm like, okay, sure.<br/>
 I mean, I am apparently not the analogy king tonight.
 It's all right.<br/>
 And happy.<br/>
 It can't be that good looking and be the analogy king.
 It wouldn't be fair.<br/>
 No, it would be wrong.<br/>
 You have to have proportional distribution of all.
 It's true.<br/>
 And right now it's just my hair and my shirt, my tie.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I mean, wow.<br/>
 I'm surprised I'm even sitting upright.
 It's quite amazing.<br/>
 I'm going to mess my hair up and see if my vocabulary will come back.
 In other good news, yes, I have to intend the things to report on.
 The first one is I can hardly wait.<br/>
 The first one is I love to complete games before moving on to new games.
 And I have, as you listen to the show, well, I already know I have finished
 the super mario 3D world and I finished.
 I realized that there's different ways of approaching games.
 There's the way that I approach games, which I thought everybody did,
 which is if you're going to finish the game, you got to complete every task, pick up every
 extra, pick up stamps, golden flag poles, you know, do everything to the nth degree and
 then you can call it finished. But then there's people who don't play it properly.
 Well, or maybe they're just people that play it for fun.
 Nope. Nope. They're weirdos. But anyway, this week I finished new Super Mario Bros.
 You. And when I say I finished it, I mean, there is no way I could have finished it without
 the supreme help of our friend Will Law. He is the Luigi to my Mario.
 Oh, okay. And so me and him sat and played that for hours. Yes.
 And it was incredibly satisfying to finish. Oh good.
 On the other hand, I'm so proud as a father because my daughter, Abigail, has pretty much completed
 Super Mario 3D World. She has gone through the whole game and collected all of the star coins,
 collected all of the stamps, all of the golden flagpoles,
 and done it without infinisibility.<br/>
 -Amazing. -Perhaps we should bronze her.
 -Oh, I just like, I'd keep her in carbonite,
 if I could, that was a Hansel reference, baby.
 -That was excellent. -Thank you.<br/>
 -That was very good. -Yeah, I'd keep, you know,
 I was so proud, I don't know.<br/>
 -See, and I was proud of her for, like, her amazing report card
 and for almost 23 miles and 30 minutes.
 -That's not really achievement. -Oh.<br/>
 [laughs]<br/>
 -Anybody can do that. -Get to know.<br/>
 But anyway, yeah, seriously, just do nothing in class and don't say anything wrong and you'll get good report card and then just keep it one foot in front of another a slightly faster pace big deal.
 This kid is Nintendo magic.<br/>
 Okay, what do you think podcast people should we film Alan running three miles in 30 minutes and just see how easy it is to do it.
 Why did this get personal?<br/>
 Let's see you play Super Mario 3D World.
 No.<br/>
 an apple store appointment yeah that isn't very interesting so i'll talk about it okay
 slightly more interesting but not really that much you ate at a let me get this straight
 a vegan restaurant i have to wonder what's the point raw vegan oh dear god i got worse i was
 really excited because i was like oh good i'll get some new recipes there's nothing i ate that i
 want to reproduce like it but what did you really say it wasn't very good it wasn't good honestly
 And why would you think it would be?<br/>
 It's a raw vegan restaurant.<br/>
 That means what they're basically going to offer you is grass or carrots.
 Yeah, but remember that place that was in the factory?
 There there's was like raw vegan stuff and they had great food.
 I did not like that restaurant either.
 Well, I was disappointed to say the least.
 And I never need to go back there.<br/>
 It was a raw vegan restaurant that was in a storage container, like just a massive
 storage container that kind of flipped on its side.
 The hits just keep coming.<br/>
 I know it was very strange, but the company was amazing.
 So it was well worth it for that.<br/>
 I just next time I'll go and drink coffee.
 Good thinking this Sunday we had brother Yoon.
 We did.<br/>
 Some of you would have read his book, The Heavenly Man.
 If you haven't, I'd really recommend you read it.
 Brother Yoon is from China got saved very early on.
 His book is all about being his book is all about the faithfulness of Jesus
 amidst incredible persecution. It's a story that's kind of like the modern day
 acts. He was telling stories today that I was like, this is kind of like having the
 Apostle Paul here with us. Like the stories that he was telling were of such enormous
 magnitude and he's a very humble man. And there's a second time at Grace Center, but
 he was exceptional. I'll put a link in the show notes for you to watch the second service
 that he spoke at Grace Center. It was exceptional. And if you haven't read the story, I'll put
 a link to his book as well. Do you know what I'd like to talk about this week?
 What would you like to talk about?<br/>
 Well, I was all inspired by Blake and Elena's wedding. Yes.
 Let me pause there because not everybody will know Blake and Elena, which is a tragedy for
 you guys. It is. Blake and Elena, how would you describe them? They're both incredibly
 good looking. They're very, yes. They're, they're super creative, trendy, super creative,
 fit, lovely, love Jesus. Really in touch with their emotions.
 very in touch with their emotions and their words.
 They're great at friendship.<br/>
 They're just very intentional, wonderful human beings.
 Blake is part of the reason that we started podcasting.
 It's true.<br/>
 He helped us on the whole podcast journey.
 And Elena, we got to know on the school, she came and did our school and we
 fell in love with her and she did first year and then she came back on
 staff and staff to our school and she's currently going through second year.
 And they're just two delightful people in our community and they got married.
 And I was really impressed.<br/>
 I was we did their wedding, which was a huge privilege,
 all was a privilege to be asked to do people's weddings.
 And so we were going through their wedding,
 and so they sent us their vows,<br/>
 and actually reading their vows caused me to step back.
 Because I was like, how do you have this much wisdom this young?
 Yeah, it's amazing.<br/>
 And so the premise of what I want to talk about
 is future proofing your marriage.<br/>
 Now, I realize not everybody listened to this as married.
 So hopefully this is, well, it's called future proofing your marriage.
 So store up now.<br/>
 It's marriage in your future.<br/>
 Then it should work for you.<br/>
 And if it's not, send it to some friends of yours, there you go.
 We're married and encourage them.<br/>
 Here's the premise I was thinking of.<br/>
 When preparing to get married, nobody's simultaneously preparing to get divorced.
 Yeah.<br/>
 That sounds blindingly obvious.<br/>
 But like divorce shouldn't exist.<br/>
 And yet the divorce rate in and out of the church is 50%.
 Yeah, I mean, it seems like very much divorce is still on the table for Christians,
 which is bizarre to me because if you weren't planning on getting divorced and you spent all
 this time planning on getting married, what changed? At some point, people stop preparing to stay
 married and start preparing to get divorced. Yeah, or they give up. Yeah, so I was thinking
 about this. And when I was thinking about Blake and Elena's vows, because often when we're doing
 doing like marriage prep or encouraging people like,
 "Hey, these are the things to look for, blah, blah, blah, blah."
 But their vows were just action-packed with wisdom.
 And I thought it would be fun to,<br/>
 and ask their permission us to take,<br/>
 could we read some of your vows out on air?
 And they were like, "Yeah, absolutely."
</p><ul>
  <li>Oh, that's awesome.
  </li><li>So I've got their permission.
 And I wanted to share with you some of their vows
 and see if we can pull out some teaching notes on this.
 All right, here's Blake's opening line.
 So he says, "Alena, I choose you today."
 Danny Seltz says this great thing.
 most people spend more time planning their wedding than they do planning their marriage.
 And so it's easy on a wedding to say, "I choose you."
 It's much harder in your marriage to say, "I choose you every day."
 And yet right there, his first line, he says, "Alena, I choose you today,
 and I vow to choose you every day for the rest of my life."
 Dear Lord, if we would just practice choosing one another each day,
 the divorce rate would drop. Sounds an oversimplification, I know.
 but somewhere along the line, we stopped choosing one another.
 Yeah, and I mean, obviously when you choose someone, then you put your will behind it,
 and you're more willing to extend grace, you're more willing to, you know, navigate whatever the
 day brings and be thankful for that person rather than feel like you're a victim of that person.
 It's brilliant. He says, "I will prioritize receiving the father's love continually,
 that my heart would be filled and overflow to you and our family."
 Perfect.
 It's amazing. He's purposing to be a receptacle of God's love so that he has enough to give away.
 Jack Frost used to say, "Most marriages are like two ticks and no dog."
 "I'm going to try and get all my needs met out of you while simultaneously you're trying to suck all your significance out of me."
 Right.
 "You need a source and it has to be the Father's love."
 I was like, "Blake, this is amazing."
 I vow to pursue with all I have connection with you will always trump logistics.
 Well, what do you what do you mean by connectedness? So connectedness is making and creating and
 maintaining a heart to heart connection. So what I mean by that is me actually honoring you.
 You start speaking to me, me actually giving you eye contact me meeting you where you are at,
 me valuing the things that you value me, creating an environment where you feel cherished and
 and loved and adored, you creating an environment for me where I feel loved, welcomed, valued
 and honored.
 It's just basically maintaining and prioritizing that intimate heart-to-heart connection.
 And a lot of people just, I think they think that that should work automatically, but the
 truth is it's sometimes hard work.
 Because God made the opposite sex with completely different motivations.
 Very true.
 And completely different interests.
 the things that you're naturally interested in, I just don't care about.
 Like, I really don't care about advice of versa.
 But if I just maintain, I don't care about it, then our marriage or our connection
 in our marriage is going to deteriorate really rapidly.
 Right.
 Like, if I'm only interested in the things that I'm interested in, then I should have married myself.
 Right.
 Which is tricky to do.
 Well, yeah.
 I mean, yeah.
 So for example, you come in and tell me about something that's significant to you.
 It might not be significant to me, but because it is to you, I make it to me.
 Right.
 Just as they connected.
 Yeah.
 And that could be anything from, Hey, babe, you know, you would not believe that
 Williams's mom has the sale and there's these new frying pans and I really love them.
 And so I'm going to be engaged.
 I'm not going to look at myself.
 Well, I'm going to, it's important to use.
 It's going to be important to me.
 Just sometimes it's as simple as that.
 Yeah.
 And like you're really good at, I'm, we joke on AR about Nintendo, for example.
 but you're very, very good at realizing, oh, you playing video games once or twice a week
 actually nourishes you. I'm going to give you space to do that. I understand that you need time
 to potter and you might not even be doing anything in those hours, but I'll watch the kids so you
 can go out with Shannon, for example, and go buy a new top or potter round or just kind of browse
 TJ Maxx. Whatever it is you want to do that just de-stresses you. Creating space for one another
 fosters connectedness. Yes. Ridiculing other people's interests basically reduces that connection to
 tons of static. And then basically instead of maintaining the connection, you're kind of
 disinterested in the connection. Yeah. And that's when marriages are in real danger.
 How about this line? Somebody taught this boy something. He said, "I will listen to you for the
 sake of just knowing you before I try to fix any problems. Talk about that dynamic,
 as you.
 That's perfect. Well, you know, guys like to fix things. They think that, I mean, I
 think men are wired to want to fix things, but there's the whole thing of sometimes
 as a woman, I don't want you to fix it. I want you to just hear me, meet me where I
 met, you know, be able to recognize, oh, yeah, I could see where that's hard without having
 to fix me.
 Which to begin with in our marriage of like what is the point of that?
 Like we could just, you could tell me this conversation fast and I could have a fix and
 we never need to talk about this again.
 Yes.
 And now I don't think that.
 No.
 Now I understand you just, you literally need me to connect with you.
 Yeah.
 Well, you learned something really early on.
 I think when we were engaged actually that whole thing about, you know, do you want me
 to listen like a man or listen like a woman?
 Right.
 So if I were upset about something and I don't think I'm a particularly emotional person,
 but everyone said, "Well, I get upset about something," you would say, "All right, well,
 do you want me to listen like a man or do you want me to listen like a woman?"
 And depending on the thing, sometimes I want to just listen like a woman and say, "Yeah,
 that's really hard.
 I'm really sorry about that."
 And sometimes I'd be like, "No, listen like a man.
 Okay, well, this is what we're going to do.
 We're going to love a lot."
 And sometimes they'd be like, "Listen like a woman first, and then afterwards you can listen like a man."
 Sometimes just doing reflective listening is the key.
 I did that with T the other day, T is our six-year-old.
 And we had a not very good situation where I did not handle it brilliantly.
 She burst into tears.
 And, you know, in my effort to restore that, I just cuddled her and just said,
 "Can you tell me how your heart feels?"
 And whatever she said, I just repeated back to her.
 I didn't try and qualified and try and say it was silly.
 I didn't try and fix it.
 I just said, I just repeated exactly what she said.
 And I must have done that for five minutes.
 And at the end of that, I said, how does your heart feel now?
 And she said, I feel less sad and I feel like I have a little more joy.
 And I said, well, what would bring it?
 What would bring you more joy?
 And she said, if you sang to me, so I made up a song about how
 daddy was a poopy poop head.
 It's going to be a hit.
 And the sadness when enjoy returned.
 But yeah, sometimes women, especially just speak to be heard.
 And that's foreign for a man.
 How about this line?
 I will let God continue to heal my heart to drive out fear and cast off shame.
 So good.
 Basically, he's placing a high value on inner healing.
 But I think I honestly don't know how anybody makes it through marriage without
 inner healing. Like if you have no grid for inner healing and you have no way of,
 or you have no knowledge of those kind of tools to help you deal with things,
 I'm not surprised to divorce rate as high as it is.
 Right. I don't know how you'd handle pain without Jesus.
 I don't know how you'd handle the other dysfunctions of the other person. Forget the other person.
 I don't know how you'd maintain or handle the dysfunction or the shame and just inside of yourself,
 which is probably why people run to drugs and alcohol and addiction and pornography and you know, to mass that pain.
 But if you don't understand, if you're married and you don't understand that you have, you often have significant issues that are feeding one another and all that kind of stuff and how to dismantle it and get free of that stuff.
 So it's not robbing your marriage of life, even with Jesus.
 If you don't have the tools, it can be really grim.
 Totally.
 Yeah.
 And you can fall into hopelessness real, real quick.
 Yes.
 But you need, you need, you constantly need the encouragement, the Holy Spirit.
 It's great to remind yourself when things are hard in marriage, that marriage is God's idea.
 Yeah.
 And then he knows what he's doing and he knows how to help you through what you're going through.
 Yeah.
 And but also get help like, you know, get help from other people who are further down the road,
 who maybe do have a grid for interhealing and or a passion for, you know, seeing marriages healed
 or whatever and get them to help you get the tools.
 Absolutely.
 Take the light off the dark parts of your marriage.
 Like, just let somebody else into that hula hoop for a second say, "Okay, if we're honest,
 this is what we're struggling with.
 We don't want to tell anybody about it because we've got this reputation or I don't want
 to uncover myself or my spouse or whatever."
 But actually, sin grows in darkness.
 Darkness is a breeding ground for sin.
 it bring it into the light, get some help from really trusted wise people.
 And oh my gosh, your marriage will be all the better for it.
 Yeah, I mean, I love Delana's vows as well.
 One of the things that stood out to me at the very beginning, it says, "I will approach
 you with compassion, kindness, acceptance, and patience.
 I will be an active participant in God's plans for your life.
 I will believe in you, encourage you, and believe with you for the promises God has made to
 you. I just love that, like even just from the very beginning. It's a team sport and
 they're setting themselves up to be each other's cheerleaders and, you know, being this as
 a team together. I love that. One of them said, I'll, I'll honor you for who you are without
 stumbling over who you're not, which I thought was a really precious line. Yeah. Yeah, because
 we do that way too often, don't we? Like in marriage, it's so easy to stumble over who
 who your spouse isn't as opposed to being able to be thankful for who they are and the
 stuff that is going really well.
 And sometimes in our distress, we stumble over what they're not what we want them to be,
 which is entirely unfair.
 It's like, oh, I'm sorry.
 I didn't realize it was my job to live up to your crazy expectations of me.
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 I just heard that from somebody else.
 It was somebody else.
 It was definitely somebody else.
 I liked as well a little further on in her vow.
 He says, "I commit myself to experience God's abundance, his joy, and his peace.
 I commit myself to partnering with you as we partner with God to see his promises over
 us come into fruition."
 So good.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I love the wording of that, but I mean, you do have to commit yourself to partnering
 with his joy and his peace.
 You do have to...
 Oh, totally.
 marriage is as much about being committed to God in the midst of it as it is to the other person.
 You're making a promise in front of God and God is part of your marriage. So it's a commitment
 and a belief that God can do what he said he would do and that he can support you through this thing
 and that the three of you were in it together. I just love that line. I commit myself to
 experience God's abundance. It is interesting to note that the people who are experiencing
 blessing and abundance from God have pursued blessing and abundance from God.
 Like I often talk to people and they're like, "Oh my gosh, you guys are crazy
 blessed. That never happens to me." And I'm like, "Do you expect it to happen to
 you?" And they're like, "Oh, I get, no, I guess I don't." And so somehow I think
 somewhere along the line we've thought that God's blessing is like the lottery.
 Some people are favored and some people are not. And that's just not the truth.
 Right. But part of it is aligning yourself to believe about God, what He says about
 himself. And so I love that right at the outset there just saying, Hey, in our
 marriage, we're actually going to commit to experience God's abundance.
 Yeah. Bill Johnson puts it this way. He said it's responsible Christian living
 to pursue the blessing of God in every area of your life.
 Right.
 Just don't be passive when it comes to God's blessing.
 No, I love that.
 Be intentional. Yeah.
 Anything else you want to comment on their vows?
 No, I mean, I just thought they were beautiful, just really beautiful.
 and they obviously really thought through what they were committing to.
 Oh, and such powerful communication as well. Absolutely.
 Amazing. No victim, no passivity, just totally full of intention and power.
 And that's one of the reasons we love those guys so much that are super like that.
 Yeah, so good.
 You know, in addition to that, and if we're going to be talking about future proof of our marriage,
 you know, the whole issue of connectedness is super important. We'd highly recommend Danny
 Silksbook, keep your love on. Excellent book. And one of the greatest things you can do is learn
 your spouse's life language and love language. And in the coming weeks, we're going to talk about
 life languages, love languages you've probably already heard about, Gary Chapman's book, The Five
 Love Languages. If that's new to you, please do yourself and your spouse a favor, read that,
 grab a copy for them. And then also don't be surprised if in marriage you're dying.
 Part of the process of marriage is killing off the stuff about you that doesn't need to be
 hanging on anyway. And some people confuse that with like, Oh gosh, my marriage is really
 hard. And you're like, is it hard because God's trying to kill something that you keep trying to
 resurrect? Right. And if it is just die faster, and it will produce much better results.
 This week, we're very excited. We have Dr. Brian Simmons, the author and translator of the
