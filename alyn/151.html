<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to very special edition keeping up the jones is it's more keeping up with the Jones because the other half.
 The prettier half it's mother's day to date when we're recording in the United States and she was like I would like a night off.
 So she's having a night off with her friend but I brought in a worthy co host mr. Gary Morgan have the heck are you good you know.
 You can expert podcasting is there a reason for that what the world is no long before we ever start keeping up the jones is my first foray into podcasting with you was we we had a podcast that was very short lived it was very short lived separated by a continent.
 Are several really yeah we record one episode of the twenty twenty show which i probably have my hard drive somewhere i have the photos.
 Yeah, okay, well then, you know, maybe maybe one week, if like if I get sick or we're too
 tired to do a podcast, I can have your permission to substitute an episode of the 2020 show
 instead of keeping up with the Jones's show.
 Absolutely not.<br/>
 Okay, perfect.<br/>
 If this is the first time you've heard of Gary Morgan, I'd encourage you to stop this
 episode and go listen to episode 90 where we interviewed Gary and his very sweet wife,
 Sarah, and you'll hear the whole story, the whole backstory.
 For those of you who do know Gary, you'll know that he's a prophet.
 And I loved last week at church, Jeff was trying to tell the people like, oh, we've
 got a guest speaker next week is Gary.
 And he looks at me and he says, what would you say Gary is Gary's a prophet, right?
 And we're like, the whole church is like, yes, Gary is a prophet.
 What I thought would be fun.<br/>
 You've been with us all week.<br/>
 We've been hanging out catching up, which is absolutely wonderful.
 But then this morning at church, you you ministered.
 depending on when you tuned in, it would look like a normal church service. You gave a prophetic
 word to the whole church, which basically looked like a sermon, and then you switched gears and
 went into prophetic ministry. You used to just pick people who'd stand out, and now you pick people
 out by words of knowledge. And for people who are unfamiliar with that term, word of knowledge is
 when the Holy Spirit tells you something about a person that you've got no way of knowing in the
 natural, and it's typically about their presence. It's something they can easily verify. It was
 It was about their present, like their name or their past, their date of birth or something
 in their history.<br/>
 It's usually quite specific.<br/>
 And then once you have that, then you give them a prophetic word, which is about their
 future.<br/>
 Is that a good description?<br/>
 Yeah, totally.<br/>
 So when did you switch from just calling people out that you would see, you know, you would
 usually stand out to you.<br/>
 They would light upon them or they would just stand out.
 You'd call them out.<br/>
 And now you start calling out people by their, sometimes their phone number or their name
 or a date of birth, like when did that switch for you and why?
 I think it was 2011, 2012. There was a few trips the Sero went on that I realized that
 I was getting details and stuff like that. And so I would just write them down in a book
 or sometimes on my iPad and just run with them. And usually some weird things that didn't
 make sense to me, but I realized the Lord wanted to speak.
 Like what do you mean, weird things?<br/>
 Well, one of them was, um, while shepherds washed their socks by
 night, and then I'd see the ninth of January.
 And so I was at a church once and, um, I had this word while
 shepherds washed their socks by night and the ninth of January.
 And this lady, I didn't realize the three rows back actually broke
 her leg and she had a sock on that was a sheep, her surname was shepherd and her birth
 their anniversary was the ninth of January.
 And so I just realized, you know, these things are starting to connect.
 Right, which is crazy because I'm not being rude, but like a normal, literally minded
 person would just dismiss that as, oh, that, you know, bad pizza or something.
 Even if you're prophetic, I'm not sure that you would automatically go, "Oh, the Lord
 must be speaking to me," because we tend to think, "Well, the Lord's first language
 is English."<br/>
 So he would say, "Hey, Gary, there's a woman three rows back or last name shepherd."
 She's confused about that.<br/>
 She's actually got a funny socks on with...
 But he doesn't do any of that.<br/>
 He just gives you a random picture.<br/>
 And for some odd reason, you go with it.
 Yeah, and it's not odd because if you look in the books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel and Revelation,
 The Lord asks the question, "Son of man, what you see?"
 And usually it's an obscure image.<br/>
 Like, you know, I see a plumb line or I see a--
</p><ul>
  <li>Boiling pond, til the way from the north.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 So what the heck does that mean?
 And then the Lord brings the interpretation.
 And so, you know, I think he would be detrimental for us
 to put into a logistical box
 the way the Lord wants to move.
 And so, you know, both of you and I know this quote,
 You know, sometimes we demand God speaks in the way we understand instead of understanding
 the way God speaks.
 Right.
 And I don't know anybody, I'm not trying to flarry you, but I don't know anybody better
 humbling themselves and taking a risk.
 It's worth noting that you will regularly, especially when you're staying with us, you'll
 get up in the morning and you'll say, "Hey Al, for integrity sake, here's my words."
 And I often wonder like, "What are you talking about for integrity sake?"
 And one day you said to me is, I get my revelation in the morning, typically for the day, I
 write it down so that if we meet people, you can see that before I met them, I had the
 words of the people we were going to meet today.
 And again, in worship, I saw you writing down, you know, all the words that you called out.
 And it's such an encouragement.
 It's an absolute encouragement to see what you have and where you go from it.
 It's staggering.
 morning, you called out nine words over two services, half with dates and half with names.
 And when, you know, we're going to actually listen to some of them. And then I'm going
 to ask for a little bit of a director's commentary behind the scenes, so to speak, which I think
 is fascinating. Guys, if you haven't watched this morning's services, I'm going to put
 a link in both to the show notes. Again, I'd encourage you to watch them. I do want to
 say that for the purposes of time, and you're kind of listening pleasure, I have absolutely
 cut up the words and I've trimmed some of the gaps and stuff like that.
 I don't mind doing that because for Integrity Sakes, the whole unedited video is available
 on YouTube so you can watch it.
 But just for the purposes of this podcast, I've cut some arms and arms and some gaps
 out and jumped around just to make it a little bit more concise for the purposes of this.
 All right, so what I've done is I've gone through both services, I've cut out the words
 of knowledge and I've skipped the prophetic words just out of honor for the people.
 you can watch and to be honest I can't corroborate all the prophetic stuff with the people,
 even though I know many of the people that you called out, but what we do know for certainty
 because you hear their testimony on the tape is that the words of knowledge were pinpoint
 and hysterical in many ways.
 So here you go.
 Here is the first word that you gave this morning.
 This is going back several hours today.
 Right in front of my hand, I'm just seeing the 27th of January.
 Who's that please?
 Yeah, come on, why didn't you stand?
 What's that mean to you?
 Beautiful.
 All right, now we didn't have those people miked.
 You can watch them on the video, but talk me through that.
 You're standing at the front of the church, and I see you point out your hand and you
 say, yeah, right in front of my hand.
 One of the things that I've been just genuine with the Lord is actually to get more specific,
 You know, a great hero of the faith for me is Clark Taylor and God used Clark, you know,
 back in the 70s, 80s, early 90s in words of knowledge in Australia.
 And I've never been in a meeting where I've experienced the presence that Clark carries.
 And so I had the privilege of doing a conference with him and both, you know, endearing of
 each other.
 I said to him, Clark, you know, I'd love you to pray for me.
 I just love what's on your life."
 And he said, "Well, Gary, I want you to pray for me.
 I love what's on your life."
 And Clark, you know, very, very often will move in
 right in front of my hand and God uses him
 in words of knowledge for healing.
 And so I said, Lord, I said, Lord, I'd love to see that
 for the prophetic, for words of knowledge, for, you know,
 the prophetic.
 And so this time's when I'm like, okay,
 I'm, Lord, I'm gonna step out in this.
 And so today I saw a couple at the back
 with the 29th of January just flash over them.
 That's a lot of gives me words.
  </li><li>Now, how many understand flash over them?
 What do you mean by that?
  </li><li>When someone takes a picture of you,
 you see the flash.
 And so that's how for me I see, not all the time.
 Sometimes I hear, sometimes I feel, sometimes I sense.
 But a lot of times it flashes like a camera.
 And I can still see the outline of what's flashing.
 And so as I'm looking, all of a sudden I see over this couple.
 And so I point my hand right in front of my hand,
 29th of January, and this couple responds,
 it's actually their anniversary.
  </li><li>And they're right at the back of the church.
  </li><li>Right at the back of the church.
  </li><li>Right at the back.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so it's their anniversary.
 Now let me ask you this, did you know it was their anniversary?
 Did you know what the date meant?
  </li><li>I just went with the date,
 and that's why I asked them,
 what does the 29th of January mean to you?
  </li><li>And that's important because people think
 you know everything all the time.
 And it's just the Bible tells us that's not true.
  </li><li>We see imparted, no imparted.
  </li><li>And that's absolutely true.
 like I've spent the week with you
 and there's been some things you've been asking me,
 like, hey Alan, I don't know if the Lord's saying this
 and I'm kind of chuckling 'cause I'm like, dude,
 how is it on the one hand the Lord
 can tell you the phone number somebody
 but you don't know the answer to this question
 and you're just humble enough to go,
 you know, it'd be preposterous to imagine I know everything.
 So I love that, your humility, you call them out
 and it's their anniversary
 and you're giving this huge prophetic word
 and again, people can go listen to that.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Amazing, love it.
 All right, then the next word,
 went straight from that into you got a name. And so you asked the Lord for the for a name,
 presumably. So I had this I didn't have this in worship. I had this literally on the spot. And
 just as you're walking back as I moved from the people, I turned and I get a picture of actually
 Dennis the Menace. And you know, for American listeners, you might not know who that is.
 It's a comic character, but I saw Dennis the menace and I saw wisdom as two people stand
 up who's called Dennis and I'm like, "Okay, Lord, you need to drill down in this."
 I've got this on tape, so this is how you differentiate between which one is. It's brilliant.
 Thank you. Who's Dennis? Dennis?
 You're named Dennis, anyone else? Dennis is two Danises.
 Why don't you guys stand, anyone else? Two Danises.
 And what are you thinking at this point? How am I going to work out which one to it?
 Yeah, but at that point I see the W.
 You send him begins with the W. Who's there? Okay.
 Oh, Wayne's your milli, no, you're last name. What's your last name?
 Well, one you sit down my friend is you.
 Awesome.
 Thank you Lord.
 Wow.
 Blessed Dennis.
 And just like that.
 Now you said you saw a double you.
 How did you know the W with the last name?
 But I just saw the W and so I went with the last name.
 Amazing.
 It could have been the guy with the middle name, but I just
 I'd already called it as the last name.
 And so I just went with that.
 I think this is just journey with God.
 But what was amazing is I know the other down is who sat down
 And I was like, man, the word could apply to both of them.
 Beautiful.
 Just I've watched you time and time again.
 You know, when you when you call people out and there's a couple, you just go down this kind of like decision tree of who it is.
 I don't know if you remember the people I think with last time, maybe that you were here.
 There's two girls from two girls stood up and then you said, which one of you from Florida?
 They were both from Florida.
 So then you had to work out the panhandle or the, you know, eventually you got there.
 And it was just a wonderful exercise of watching you.
 interact with the Lord.
 So again, it's only you're just calling these people out.
 You call them out and then you give them a prophetic word.
 And it just, for me, prophetic ministry is one of the greatest displays of the kindness of God.
 I just think it's beautiful.
 So now I had to leave.
 I had to go pick up my kids.
 I didn't hear this one until I watched the video again.
 But you finish prophesying over Dennis.
 You turn around and you get the date 29th of April.
 I'm going to want more.
 I saw one flash.
 This section here.
 Who's the 29th of April?
 Okay.
 Why don't you stand?
 Oh, you're a babysitter.
 Just hold my hand.
 Thank you, Lord.
 Wow.
 So how do you get?
 You said, oh, it's another flash.
 Same thing.
 Yeah.
 So same thing again.
 But the interesting thing is I didn't see it above a person.
 I saw it above the section.
 And so four rows, like the way Grace said this section, I saw towards the front part
 of that section and it turns out the girl was in the second row.
 And not to be left brain here, but when you see 29th of April, do you see 29/4? Do you
 see the word April?
 Like 294.
 That's 29th of April. So you just, and that's it.
 Yeah.
 It's amazing.
 And this time is what I've called, you know, February 94.
 Okay.
 And so...
 But again, you're going with what the whole story is.
 Yeah, I really feel what I go with. And it's amazing when you step out, God steps in.
 And so it's that place of just risking.
 And sometimes you don't always hit what you think is the buzzer, the word.
 Sometimes the Lord is showing you other things that you can interpret how you see it,
 but actually the Lord wants to say something else.
 You were telling me earlier, you did a conference with Graham Cook,
 you were telling me that Graham was telling you a story about another Hero of Hours,
 Paul Kane. Do you want to share that part? Because I thought it was fascinating.
 Yeah, it's amazing. I was talking with Graham about how, you know, you don't always hit it.
 And sometimes, you know, you just feel like the word is just, you know, not hit anywhere.
 And he said to me, Gary, you know, the Lord reserves the right to humble you.
 And then he said, you know, one day I met with Paul Kane and I said, Paul, you know, when you're
 on, you're amazing." And Graham said, "When you're off, it is painful." And so Graham said,
 "Paul, can you tell us about that?" And Paul said, "When I'm on, it's God's grace. But when
 I'm off, it's just God reminding me I'm a fat old man." So I thought that was just amazing.
 You've got to have a value on risk. One of the things we teach in our school,
 It's for people to embrace failure. Go on. One of the things I've learned is people don't risk
 is because they fear failure. When you get used to failure, or when you take away the fear of failure,
 people will risk because risk is the absence of fear. Risk is the absence of fear.
 But you have to work hard to not let fear be a louder voice than what's on the other side,
 potentially of risk. And that's why you fall in love with not just what the Lord's doing.
 but you fall in love with who the person God wants the minister to. So whenever I'm with people,
 whenever I'm in a meeting, I always ask the Lord, "Give me a love for these people."
 Like you love them. And the Bible says, "Perfect love casts out all fear."
 Therefore, when you find a love, and sometimes you could be in a room of 100 people, and
 you might not connect with 99, but there's one there the Lord wants to speak to.
 There's one there the Lord wants to demonstrate his kindness to.
 And so for me as I just try to find that one, and you know, a lot of times it's more than the one,
 but it's that one that I just go after. I tell you, I make no apologies for this.
 I'm addicted to seeing God's kindness wreck people.
 It's true. We moved now to the second service. You finish ministering and you wrap up and you
 you go for it and this is the first word you give.
 I got the name Jonathan.
 Who's that?
 Okay, it's one.
 Thank you Lord.
 But the Lord's going to unfold and unpack time in your life in such a way that what you're
 going to step into is beginning to create areas for other people to occupy.
 I see architecture all over your life.
 Now, before we go any further, what's funny about that is this was a young kid that you called
 that, well, not a young kid, a young adult, really, a 17 or 18 year old guy I would imagine.
 And after the service, his dad texted me.
 And this is what he said.
 He said, Jonathan is going to architectural school at university this summer.
 Wow.
 So, not only did you get this kid's name right, the only one in the room called Jonathan,
 you, I mean, you called it a ton of stuff in the prophetic word, but the architecture was a word
 of knowledge that you maybe didn't know. I mean, you obviously knew, but maybe didn't know where
 landed because sometimes when we're speaking, we don't know if it's poetic or metaphorical or
 whether it's literal. But how did you get the name Jonathan? You got that in worship?
 Yeah, go that in worship and again, what I love about God in, you know, and I have people come to me and said, you know, Gary, you know, when you get names, you know, you realize the odds.
 There was an amazing time when I was in Dubai. There was a pastor who was an accountant and he said to me, Gary, you realize the odds you're working with you.
 And I said, I don't work with arts. I work with God. But in an art level, he's like, hey,
 there's this amount of people for you to get that name and there to be one of them people in the
 room. And he started courting arts. And I said, I don't work with arts. I work with God.
 And that's what blows me away. Unless what keeps the wonder is that God would be so intentional,
 that God would be so kind to give us a name that just singles out one person.
 Right. And that's what blows me away.
 And then goes in further because the prophetic word was very detailed too.
 And so I saw him stand in front of a drafting board.
 And so that's why I knew it was architecture.
 And so...
 Well, it was also interesting because before you said architecture,
 you said you're going to be involved in creating spaces for people to fill,
 which is literally what an architect does.
 Did you know at that point it was architecture or did that come as you're speaking?
 As I was speaking, I began to see the plans. Talk to us about, because people who haven't watched
 the video about this in the podcast, you hear the piano playing in the background, talk to us about
 that. So for me a couple of years ago, the Lord started speaking to me about the key of David.
 And I personally believe in, and this isn't something I've taught extensively, and really,
 it is a revelation that's unfolding in my life. And one day, I hope to release it in full measure,
 But a couple of years ago, the Lord started talking to me about the key of David.
 And I believe the key of David isn't just a physical key, but it's a musical key.
 David, unlike Moses, was able to have unveiled glory in his midst.
 Why? Because he established an atmosphere, and that was done through worship.
 And so for me, the key of A, the key of D, this key of E is so important to me in establishing
 atmospheres where God can unveil his glory. And so I'm intentional when it comes to
 sitting keys being played. And I've been in meetings where I've literally asked the keyboard
 player, can you actually switch keys? Because it's not resonating with what the Lord wants to do.
 And then there's times I've asked for particular keys because sitting keys been sitting things to
 me, which maybe in another podcast or maybe in a message I'll release one day.
 Right. Yeah, it's fascinating. Of course, as soon as you start speaking about that, I think about
 Elisha where the king comes to him and says, "Hey, I need a word." And Elisha says, "Bring me a
 minstrel." And then as soon as the guy starts playing music, he begins to revelate.
 Yeah. So yeah, there's biblical precedent. And again, I've seen it. I've seen you switch when
 when the music begins to play, boom,
 revelation begins to flow fastening.
 And then you came up with one of my favorite words,
 and it was favorite because it was so out there.
 And you actually got this in the first service.
 You leaned over to me, it was like,
 "Bro, I just got the strangest word."
 And I was like, "What was it?"
 And well, I'll let you use your own words.
 Hold on, here we go.
  </li><li>Thank you, Lord.
 I had this word, I don't know if this means anything.
 I saw Cindy Crawford with a tiara.
 Does that mean anything to anyone?
 Now at this point, nobody responds.
 Well, a few people respond.
 I'm not saying they're trying to massage it, either trying to help you out or genuinely
 trying to connect the dots.
 What's going through your head at that point?
 Because nobody's responding.
 Yeah, again, it's such an obscure word.
 And so I'm really wanting to put it to connect.
 And so for me, when I call a word of knowledge, there's a resonance that happens for me.
 There's an agreement in my spirit.
 And so, you know, there's many times where God connects the dots to the point I see the
 picture.
 Right.
 And so I know again, and that's why I purposely take patience and discover and dig deeper.
 Or as I say, let the law drill down because I know there's more to be discovered.
 So particularly with this one, I really didn't sense it was connecting in the room.
 And so as you'll see on the video, I went down the camera and spoke it out because I
 actually had it in the first service.
 But because it was so obscure, I just didn't go with it.
 I mean, a couple of comments there.
 One, I love that you're not flustered.
 like you've absolutely removed your performance
 from the prophetic.
 Like you don't look visibly shaken at all.
 You know, on the one hand you're like,
 I'm fine to miss it.
 On the other hand, maybe it's, you know,
 maybe it's somebody on the online stream,
 which, you know, to critical people would be like,
 "Ah, well, you know, you missed it."
 And, you know, of course, yeah,
 you'll just say it's on the online stream.
 But to those people I would say,
 it's funny because last time you were here,
 you had a similar occurrence.
 got a word in the first service that you released in the second service.
 And the word, if I remember correctly, was, and you left it, I think, towards the end,
 because you're like, okay, this is a little out there.
 But I heard the phrase, Rudolph the Red Nose reindeer 911 and the room was silent, like
 nobody's responding to it.
 And you're like, it's okay.
 And then again, people are trying to, and what I love is that you're refusing to massage
 the word just to appease people's awkwardness.
 So you're like, I'm just going to give it down the camera, the online stream.
 You're like, okay, it's a girl.
 Your first name begins with K and you just give this prophetic word.
 Well, what nobody knew is that at the first service when you got the word, there was a
 girl called Kristen Rudolph.
 And she said later, she said, oh, when I introduced myself to people, I say, my name's Kristen
 Rudolph, like the reindeer.
 She was born on 9/11, but she also works for a company that sells products to emerge
 which again in the US 9-1-1 is the emergency services number.
 So there's an example where the word was on.
 Oh, and Kristen listened to the word
 and obviously was encouraged by the word,
 but nobody heard it.
 And so what is that?
 Is that the Lord just doing a heart check on you?
 Is that you just quote, unquote, missed it.
 You didn't miss it, but you missed the timing.
 I mean, what do you learn from that?
 Or what do you think about that?
 I think for me it's again the currency of trust is the biggest transaction that you have with the Lord in their moments.
 And one of the things I love with the Lord is he's intentional.
 And I'm happy to put my hands up and say, you know, I missed it.
 Or, you know, maybe it's for another time or maybe it just didn't land.
 The one thing I've learned is, and this happened at a church that I released a word and no one
 responded.
 And so I decided to release it down the camera.
 And literally a year later, I get a message from a guy who'd been serving in Iraq.
 And he said, I've just come back off active duty.
 And I've been catching up with my church's podcasts and the word you released.
 He said, that's me.
 If you had given me that word a year ago, it would not have made sense.
 But the word I just listened to was like you, it's just prophesying right into the moment right now.
 Wow.
 And so I've realized that, you know, it's it takes it takes courage and trust to step out.
 But, you know, the Bible says his word does not return to him void, but accomplishes everything it was set out to do.
 And so sometimes it's not in our timing.
 And so with today's technology, I realize, you know, you can record a word today that can be heard 10 years from now.
 Right.
 And God's word is ageless.
 You were telling me earlier this week that a similar story that happened to Sean Bowles.
 You want to tell us that story?
 Yeah.
 And so I love what Sean's walking in.
 It really, it really just, you know, blows me away.
 Yeah, he's amazing.
 And I love how that's just unfolding in, in training others.
 And so, Chao was telling the testimony about he was at a church in Australia and he, you know,
 the Lord given this list and he goes through the first one and no one responds.
 He goes through the second one, no response. And so he goes through the list and no one is
 responding. And so it was just like a nose dive. And you know, everyone was like, okay, wow.
 And Sean, you know, even himself was in a place of like, okay, Lord, you know, again,
 like what Graham said, he reserves the right to humblest.
 And so whether it was a couple of months later or a year later,
 he was at another church in the States.
 And for some reason, during the service, the Lord said to him,
 "Hey, Sean, why don't you pull out the list
 that I give you in Australia?"
 And so he's like, "Okay."
 And so he gets up and calls the first name,
 that person's in the room, calls the second name,
 that person's in the room, third name.
 And so everyone on the list is in the room,
 in this church in America.
 And so again, that just blows me away
 how God is so intentional.
 But yet if we try to work him out,
 he becomes an equation.
 If we walk with him, then he becomes a delight.
  </li><li>And again, if people are sitting listening,
 thinking, oh, this seems a little bit sketchy,
 you have to remember all of that is entirely biblical.
 Isaiah in Isaiah 61 prophesied about
 the spirit of the sovereign Lord is upon me.
 And for hundreds of years, that word never came to pass.
 And then Jesus one day walks into the synagogue
 and the attendant hands him the scroll
 and he reads Isaiah 61 and says,
 "Behold, today in your hearing,
 these words have been fulfilled."
 And so again, God's word is ageless.
 And if you're content to be humble,
 if the whole goal isn't for you to look good,
 you get to play in the prophetic.
 All right, beautiful.
 I'm loving this, Gary.
 I hope our listeners are loving this.
 I don't know whether it's just
 such a rich fascination with the prophetic.
 But I think it's so precious and very, very rare
 that we get the opportunity to hear the behind the scenes
 of how a prophet works.
 And so thank you for taking time to do this.
  </li><li>My pleasure.
  </li><li>All right, so this next one turns out to be names,
 but it doesn't start that way.
 Tell us what you got.
  </li><li>So I get the, just B and B.
 And so for me is again, the picture I get is just a cottage
 in the UK, which we use for B&amp;B, which means bed and breakfast.
 Right.
 And so I get bed and breakfast and the month of June.
 And so I think OK, because that's when people take their holidays,
 usually in the UK, is in that summer time.
 So June, I thought, OK, I'm going to go with this.
 And you have no clue what it is.
 I'm going to clue.
 No, but you just, in humility, say, does B&amp;B mean anything to anybody?
 Yeah.
 All right, let's listen to what happens.
 This is something we do in a straight in UK, I'm not sure you.
 but I had B and B, which is bad in breakfast,
 but I thought like the Lord wanted to speak to B and B.
 Does that mean anything to anyone?
 Oh, we got two.
 B and B, so what's that?
 Brian and back, what?
 Betsy and Brian, oh, wow, come on.
  </li><li>It's a friend of, thank you Lord.
 Does the month of June mean anything to any of you?
 (audience laughing)
 Woo, one of the odds.
 Oh, Jesus.
 Anavistic and anniversary, the June.
 It's the sixth of June.
 That's you.
 Okay, you keep standing.
 I'm going to come with you, but let's start with these.
 So the sixth tune is your anniversary.
 Wow, okay.
 Thank you, Lord.
 So similar to the dentist situation, you got, now you've got four people, two couples,
 B and B, Brian and Beth, Betsy and Brennan.
 And so you think, oh, I know how I can start this out.
 I'm going to say, does June mean anything to you?
 and lo and behold, both of them have their wedding anniversary in June.
 So now what are you thinking?
 And so I'm like, Lord, what is going on?
 Because I thought, you know, you've given me B&amp;B and June.
 So that's going to distinguish.
 Right.
 But they both got their anniversary.
 So I'm standing there.
 So I keep, I go back.
 One of the things I've learned in the prophetic is your next revelation is found in your last.
 And so for John in the book of Revelation, his next revelation,
 which was John chapter 4, 1, he saw an open door, is connected to his last revelation,
 which is Revelation 320, behold, I stand at the door knock. So both them pictures,
 which are doors, took him further into greater revelation. And so I went back into what I saw,
 the flash to saw, which was the number six, which for me, I thought, okay, June, because June is
 the sixth month. And so I went back there. And as you know, you heard for the sake of the listeners,
 you spliced that long sort of pause. Because I did, I waited in patience to see. And I kept
 seeing the six. And so I thought I was still seeing June, but I didn't realize then, oh, wait a minute,
 it might be the six of the six. And so that's when I went with it and said, okay, does the six mean
 anything. And it was the couple on my left.
 And so you profiled over them?
 Yeah, profiled over them. But I really
 you honored the people. I really wanted honor them because
 there's something in my heart, you know, I was drawn to with
 that couple. And so, yeah, God was so kind to to bless them to
 all right. Now, this is this is a great combination of a word
 the Lord gave you. And then the word the Lord kept giving you.
 So let's play this this next one.
 But there's a town when you go from England into Wales.
 You have to go through a city called Bristol.
 Doesn't mean anything to anyone.
 That's your last name.
 Your Bristol is your last name.
 Okay.
 You go five children?
 Okay.
 3 boys and 2 daughters?
 Okay.
 Sir, the Lord says every thing that you've put your hand to, that you feel is failing,
 the Lord's injecting with favor.
 Now, talk to us about that one, because you start with what you think is a play-stain,
 it turns into a name. Yeah, just talked with the whole process.
 So talking with a good friend who is there today, so good rihus, we were talking about
 his recent trip to Ireland, the UK, or to England and Scotland. And while he was talking,
 you know, I'm, he's mentioned in different places and Bristol, for me is a key place
 the UK. And so I sort of in talking with him realized, you know, Bristol was highlighted.
 And so I just sort of put a mental tab in my, you know, my head to say, okay, Bristol
 means something. And so in worship, then I'm like, okay, God, someone here from Bristol.
 And so I'm going to go with this. And so it wasn't actually a place. It was a person.
 And so again, Bristol could mean anything and a few people responded, "Yeah, my auntie
 or my mother lives in Bristol.
 My friend lives in Bristol."
 But this particular guy stood up and said, "My surname is Bristol."
 And as he stands up, he says, "What you don't year on the mic?"
 He says, "Oh, my wife's taking care of my children, but my son is here."
 And as soon as he said that, straight away, I just saw the number five.
 And so that's when I asked him, "You have five children."
 And he says, "Yes."
 And then I saw five divided by two numbers, which is three and two, three plus two equals
 five.
 And so I went with three cents, you know, or three boys, two girls.
 And again, he's like, yeah.
 And so I love again, it, my heart is pounding.
 I'm like, God, this is crazy.
 But again, God is so intentional of, of not just pointing people out, but actually
 drilling down into their lives to reveal to them that he is intentional to them as anyone
 else wants to be.
 Right.
 And we're losing a little bit.
 You know, here we are in our room talking about something.
 We're almost doing a post mortem, which on the one hand, I really appreciate it.
 On the other hand, I don't like because you're dissecting something that was incredible.
 Because if you were in the room that morning, when you were witnessing, you could just feel
 the presence of God as you're navigating this and it's so clear that the Lord knows these
 people and who they are. But one of the things I loved about that Gary was you gave what
 you had. You were a little boy with five loaves and some fish. You know, you're like,
 I got Bristol. You weren't pretending you knew what a man. You weren't pretending where
 it went. You just were obedient with what God gave you. I remember watching Jack Deere
 in Scotland. He was a minister in Scotland. He was doing words of knowledge and he taught
 about the importance of just don't try and elaborate on what you have. Just give what
 you've got and see where God goes. And he said, I learned this the hard way. He said, I was in a
 meeting and I called at high blood pressure and nobody responded. And he was like, but I, you know,
 I heard it from the Lord. So he's standing up there panicking because there's all these people
 and nobody's responding to it. And she said, Lord, you know what's going on? And the Lord said, I
 didn't say high blood pressure. I just said blood pressure. So Jack stops and says, actually, hang on,
 I made a mistake. Lord and say high blood pressure. He said blood pressure. Is there anybody here
 with an issue regarding blood pressure and there was one person there with low blood pressure.
 Now he said never in a million years would I have thought, because, you know,
 medically speaking, most people suffer from high blood pressure. And he said, and so I missed
 the word because I got ahead of the Lord. And I've watched you time and time again, just be
 faithful with a little that you have, no matter how foolish it makes you look.
 Well, I remember being in a conference and the Lord gave me a name. He gave me a date and also
 as well, the job of this person and the guys was a paramedic. But in the word, I got ahead
 of the Lord and connected trauma with the name and the name turned out to be their daughter.
 I connected trauma with their daughter instead of connecting trauma with his job.
 Wow.
 And I remember flying home from that conference and as I came into land, the Lord says,
 son, I need to talk to you about that word. You missed it on that word. And I'm like,
 so I found the pastor straight away and said, hey, I just want to be integral that I feel
 I've missed it with that word. And I want to make restitution and actually speak to these people.
 And the pastor said, you don't you don't need to do that. I said, no, I need to do that. And
 it turned out that they were gracious enough and said, no, no, we we totally, you know, receive
 your apology. And so the next time I was at the church, Logan Behold, the first person
 that the Lord had me call out, turned out to be their daughter. And it wasn't through anything
 the Lord gave me in worship. It was literally, I felt drawn to this person the whole time.
 And I called this person out, I called her out and gave this prophetic word, which actually
 was recompensed in a redemption to the first word that I missed. One of the things I've realized
 with the Lord. If we just allow him to be him, he allows us to be us. But the moment that we try
 to be him, we lose us. Wow. And so yeah, I've just realized I can't get up in the morning trying
 to be God because God doesn't get up in the morning trying to be Gary Morgan.
 Right. That's some severe pressure. I think I'm trying to be the Lord Almighty to do this.
 Amazing. All right. We've got two more ago. This one was brilliant. It was broad and it ended up
 being super specific and you got some test reads from the guy afterwards. So let's listen to this one.
 I did just this phrase. I don't know if this means I did knock on wood. It's a song from the
 70s knock on wood. I had the month of January, but I didn't get a date. I just saw January and
 knock on wood.
 Does that mean anything to anyone?
 You born in January and your nickname is Woody.
 Woodrow, I think Woodrow Wilson.
 Awesome. Just put your hands like this.
 And again, I want to I want to make it clear.
 This is just the initial invitation to get people's hearts to respond.
 Then you go in and sometimes you're giving 10, 15 minute prophetic words.
 You're ministering to them.
 None of that is included on here.
 I mean, go watch the video to see this.
 This just isn't.
 I don't want people think this is a parlor trick where we just call people out
 and we, you know, we rejoice that God knows people's names.
 You know so much more than that.
 Um, but talk to us about Woody, because this was amazing, especially
 because you got to meet him afterwards.
 So the guy comes up and, and you know, I keep getting this phrase knock on wood.
 And, and as you'll see in the prophetic word, the Lord, the Lord, um, reveals to me,
 you know, he's a caretaker.
 And again, I think caretaker is someone who looks after a place, but he comes up to me
 and after and said, "Brother Gary, I just want to let you know how spot on your word
 was."
 And I'm thinking, "You're born in January, yeah, that's pretty spot on."
 He said, "No, you need to realize something.
 My friends use that phrase to me whenever they want something or whenever they have
 something they need for me, they always say, "Oh, just knock on wood. Just knock on wood."
 And he said, "I'm a policeman, and so I'm a caretaker of my community."
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And so he was weeping, and he said, "You don't realize my friends use their phrase to me all the
 time." And God just saw pinpointed, God saw pinpointed that into my life. And so it was just
 just beautiful. It makes me cry because it just, I just realized how intentional and kind God is.
 And that's the thing that people don't get to see is you are as in all of God using you as we are
 in all of God using you. I mean, you are, I don't mean freaked out, but you are as astonished at times,
 like the creativity of God or the astonishment that God would do that. I mean, and that's what I love
 sick next to you is you're just there's no sense of ego with you like check me out
 I'm the man of power for the hour. It's like did you see that? Do you see what the Lord just did?
 Yeah. And you know that whole side of Gary is so contagious and we I think that's why you're
 universally loved not only for your ministry but for your personality which is lovely. All right
 we come to the last word which which is just wonderful I'm not even going to give it an introduction
 and I'm just gonna let you speak for yourself.
 Here you go.
  </li><li>I leave the scary once to last
 'cause I'm gonna go out with this.
 This is a six-digit number which,
 it might mean something, it might not,
 if no one will go have coffee.
 But I saw one, one, two, six, seven, eight.
 Dang, one guy stands.
 Shoot, that was quick.
 1 1 2 6 7 8, what's that soon?
 Shoot.
 1 1.
 78.
 Good night.
 So you get this number 1 1 2 6 7 8.
 You don't have a clue what it is.
 I think it's a pin number.
 I think it means something to someone because again, it's for me, a birthday would be that
 would have been two, four, one, one, seven, eight.
 Right.
 Um, because in, in Britain and Australia, we list our days first, then the months, then
 the year, whereas in America, they do the month first, then the day, then the year.
 And so it's just a don't on you.
 No.
 And so that's why I really kept it because I'm like, okay.
 And I literally went to wrap up the meeting.
 And again, the Holy Spirit's like, do you trust me?
 And I'm like, I can't go for this.
  </li><li>Because you've had pin numbers,
 you've had phone numbers before,
 so you're thinking it could be anything.
 You just thrown out there hoping that six digit
 random string of numbers means something to someone.
 And it's Neil's birthday.
 Every in our community knows and loves Neil.
 So as soon as he stands up,
 that's why he or Ratcher applause.
 A, for the fact that it's his birthday.
 but B, he's just the best target for the affection of God because he's just the sponge to receive
 the affection of God. It's wonderful. We love it. He's just finished the school.
 We just love watching him get read by God. So then you go on and you give this amazing
 prophetic word that just wrecks him. So again, how did you get that sixth-digit number?
 So yeah, I get 1-1-2-6-7-8. And I'm thinking, okay, a lot of this random.
 Do you see that or do you hear it?
 I mean, this, this was again a flash.
 And so I think, okay, I'm, I'm just going to go with this.
 Right.
 And because it didn't make sense.
 And because again, a lot of times I'm like, I trust and think, okay, you could
 probably connect this with something.
 But this one was just out there.
 I just, for me, I was thinking, okay, this is a pin number or it might be, it
 might be again, a group of numbers that mean something.
 It's interesting. I was at a conference in Sydney and the law give me these eight digits.
 And the first four digits were the woman's, the first four numbers of her four number when she was a child.
 Wow.
 The last four were her zip code or post code where she grew up.
 And so I'm just like, this is crazy.
 And so she comes forward and I said, Lord, I really want to drill down in this
 because there's 13, 1400 people there and the Lord pinpoints who.
 And I really felt the Lord really wanted to make it extra special.
 So I'm just praying.
 Well, give me something else.
 And as she comes, I take her hand and Lord says, Catherine.
 And so I ask her, I said, who's Catherine?
 And she said, that's me.
 And again, I'm just, I'm just amazed how God does this.
 So you stand up, you call out one guy response.
 Now, let me ask you this because we've talked about how you've got the
 revelation for the word of knowledge, but you're then going on and given
 five, 10, 15 minute prophetic words.
 Where are you getting that revelation from?
 Just to strengthen the Lord, just flow, just flow there and then.
 And again, peppered through that word.
 And again, this is what I've discovered with the Lord is the Lord will pin point
 people in word of knowledge, but then he'll pepper words of knowledge all throughout
 the word.
 So the whole time you're going, you're getting like that guy with you got five kids.
 Yeah.
 Just you're just constantly getting full.
 Just flow.
 Because one of the big misunderstandings is that people think that profits have
 everything they're giving before they give it.
 And it really isn't on demand, isn't it?
 So what you don't know is I called Neil earlier and said, look, Neil, I'm
 Azure Corner podcast with Gary.
 Can you give us your side?
 Like how were you impacted by that word?
 And this is what Neil had to say.
 So this morning, while getting ready for church, I was having a
 conversation with the Lord, which was really me pleading with the Lord.
 And I was like, God, I, I would love a word from Gary today.
 Um, but it doesn't have to be public or anything.
 Like I can just catch him after the service and it doesn't have to be a big
 deal. It may be, you know, he could call me out, you know, by something, you know,
 like my birthday or something crazy like that.
 But then I dismissed it because in my mind, there are probably hundreds of
 other people there who are asking the same thing. And by all means, they should get a
 word. We're sitting in the service and Gary's prophesying. And so he says, the six digits
 of the day I was born month, day, and year, and I shot up, I shot up like a rocket. Because
 I was like, that's me.
 The first thing that Gary says, he says, the father says, see, son, I'm real.
 In that moment, I have never felt more seen and more loved by the father.
 I think because not only did I feel like I threw up a Hail Mary past heaven
 and the most orphan of spirits to hear from the Lord.
 But he went above and beyond what I thought he would do.
 And Gary, in his word to me, actually repeated words that I have gotten in the past, almost
 verbatim to what other people like David Wagner and Becky Dollar.
 And even Alan, but what you've said to me, I'm just undone.
 I'm undone by the kindness of the Father that he would use a dude from all the way across
 the world to show up and speak into my life.
 I don't even, I don't have words.
 I don't have words.
 I'm still in awe.
 I've listened to the word like eight times today already and every time I hear something
 new.
 So I don't know how to end this, but Gary, thank you so much for being obedient and just being an awesome man of God.
 And I just thank you. I can't thank you enough for today.
 So so funny when you get to hear the other side. Wow. What are you thinking?
 I don't know. It's so precious.
 That he was asking the Lord, Lord, I love a word.
 And he just throws out this like, I don't know, maybe if you're to call me up on my birthday, that would be cool.
 Now that's ridiculous.
 Again, it's one of those ones that I would cherish.
 It's like Alison Hendrickson's word last time.
 Tell us the story.
 So, again, I think we were rushing to get to school and I love to be in the worship
 because that's what the Lord usually speaks to me and for whatever reason, I think it
 was traffic we were late.
 Right.
 And so, remember getting into the fire building and sitting down and just saying, "Lord, if
 If you got something, then you better be quick giving it to me.
  </li><li>'Cause worship's running out.
  </li><li>Yeah, worship's running out.
 We got like three minutes and boom, straight away,
 I just saw this number.
 And so, you introduce us and we get up
 and we, you know, taught and then I said,
 "Okay Lord, I'm just gonna go with this."
 And so I caught this number and all of a sudden,
 I hear a person at the back of the room
 finish the last four digits
 and it turns out to be Alison Hendrickson.
 So she comes forward.
  </li><li>But wait, you've called out her phone number.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The 10 digit number the Lord gave you in worship
 was her personal cell phone number.
  </li><li>It was her personal number.
 And so she comes forward.
 And she's like, you just don't understand.
 And I'm like, yeah, I don't understand.
 This is crazy.
 And she said, so we give her a word
 and then she says, can I say something?
 And I said, yeah, go ahead.
 She said, "Last week," and she points to Matt, one of the pastors, and said, "I was
 telling the staff last week that I had a dream, and in the dream I'm calling Gary Morgan
 on my cell phone, and as I'm calling it, I hear the Father say to me, 'Don't leave
 a voicemail because I've already given him your number.'"
 I'm like, "What?"
 And so in there, I can't and the Lord gives me her number.
 And so again, just like Neil, it's like it comes out of that place of God is so kind
 that we in our false humility think that our prayers are too selfish.
 When I believe, you know, he used the desires of our hearts.
 It's amazing.
 I'm speechless.
 You know, I don't know if we ever mentioned this.
 The last time you were on the show, episode 90,
 we were recording and then I,
 we had some sort of power failure.
 Do you remember that?
 Just in the middle of it
 and everything just shuts down.
 My computer, the recording system, everything just,
 and I'm like, what?
 And so I'm panicked, I'm trying to get all up,
 I'm hoping I haven't lost everything.
 We start up and I'm running and we're like,
 okay guys, we're good.
 And you were like, ow, like the craziest thing that happened
 when the power went out,
 I think I got a word for somebody.
 Do you remember what you had?
  </li><li>Yeah, I think it was a name, a date
 and an occupation.
  </li><li>And so we leave it in.
 And the next day, Heather from Scotland says,
 "I'm listening to your podcast as I often do,
 "and to my absolute surprise, I hear my name called out,
 "my date of birth, where I live and what I do."
 And do you know that she just landed today in Nashville?
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>She's over here for the more conference.
 But dude, all these things.
 Guys, if you haven't, do me a favor.
 Go listen to Alan and AJ.com/90
 to listen to the Fuller interview with Gary and Sarah
 just about their journey together.
 Watch the episodes this morning from Grace.
 The links are gonna be in the show notes.
 Gary, how do people get more information about you?
 How can people follow around your trips all around the world?
  </li><li>Social media is the best.
 So on Facebook and Instagram and Twitter,
 it's while Sheagle on all three.
 Or they can check out at schoolofprofits.org.au.
  </li><li>Talk about the school of profits for a second,
 'cause I think it's amazing.
 I wanna do it.
 So the school has really been a dream in my heart.
 I had a school in Wales back in 2000.
 And it's really been a dream in my nan, Sarah's heart.
 And I just love seeing people come alive,
 not to just to who they are, but who they are.
 And so when Tink and Sam came out to be in Australia,
 they really said, "Guys, what's in your heart?"
 And really what was in minus era's heart was the school of
 prophets.
 And so they're just amazing in helping formulate and out of
 literally overnight, this school came about.
 And one of the things that's the foundation of the school is
 what I call Matthew 1234 or Matthew 1234 that out of the
 overflow of the heart the mass speaks.
 And so we really focus people on not getting professional
 with their mouth, but actually powerful with their heart.
 And a lot of people do prophetic training to your God's voice,
 but they never discover their voice.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And so we just equip people
 in hearing God's voice, discovering their voice.
 In speaking from their mouth,
 the source becomes their heart.
 And so I realized that when the heart's right,
 what comes from it is gonna be life giving a life change.
 And so yeah, that's School of Prophets.
 and it runs where?
  </li><li>And so it's based in Melbourne, Australia,
 but we also have an online component.
 So currently we have just over 30 students
 in four continents.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>It runs from March to October
 and the applications open in
 to September beginning of October.
 And so if you want more information,
 you can check at schoolofprofits.org.au.
  </li><li>Amazing.
 Well, Gary, thank you so much for taking time
