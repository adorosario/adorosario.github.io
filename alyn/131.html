<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones hello i think it's only fair that we tell our listeners right off the bat.
 This is going to be a short episode it is going to be a very short episode well the technical people among us have already seen it's a short episode because when they've looked at it they saw the time stamp and they're like wait how can we get gypped out of a normal episode well it's because this week was crazy.
 What was crazy cultured.<br/>
 It was crazy cultured.<br/>
 Don't ask that like it's a question.<br/>
 You remember the cultural highlights?<br/>
 Oh, yes.<br/>
 We went to the choir.<br/>
 Yes, Abby's fourth grade choir.<br/>
 I was going to have a yes.<br/>
 Oh, OK.<br/>
 It was Abby's fourth grade.<br/>
 And the fourth grade was a hard grade.
 It was Abigail's fourth grade program.
 Yes.<br/>
 I would like to pat myself on the back because.
 You stayed there.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 You did, but not without complaining or playing on your phone through most of the
 recital.<br/>
 Well, if you consider the other two recitals that we went to this week, I didn't
 last as long.<br/>
 No, you didn't.<br/>
 We had Tia's musical recital, which she had a speaking part in.
 She did.<br/>
 And she did awesome.<br/>
 Yes, she did.<br/>
 She did.<br/>
 She did.<br/>
 Her speaking part.<br/>
 Awesome.<br/>
 But yes.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I mean, she stood up and said words.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And then we left.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 We snuck out because we were like, all right, we have the next thing to go to tonight.
 It has been a busy week from that perspective.
 It was.<br/>
 There was something every night of the week.
 The piesta resistance, however, was the ballet recital on Saturday.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, the rehearsal was pretty fantastic on Wednesday.
 I scaped that.<br/>
 So it's not on my horizon.<br/>
 I felt that.<br/>
 It's not my landscape, but yes.<br/>
 How many dances were there in total?<br/>
 Forty five, I think.<br/>
 This is how I know the Lord loves me.<br/>
 Yeah, because it was forty five dances.
 Yes, our daughters were in dance number three.
 Yes, and dance number six.<br/>
 Yes, at which point I left and then you left.
 Yeah, I don't know how people do it.<br/>
 Yeah, poor Elizabeth willard her.<br/>
 Her mercy was in the very final dance.
 So she had one at the very beginning and one at the very end.
 I was like, oh, babe, I'm sorry.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Well, we had people saying, yeah, wait till again, to go up the dishes,
 'cause then it's worse and it's like, "Oh, we can't advance."
 I was like, "No, I'm gonna..."<br/>
 I don't think there's much risk that our kids are gonna be getting in there.
 [laughter]<br/>
 Based on this risk, I don't think we...
 Babe, that's a horrible thing to say.<br/>
 [laughter]<br/>
 I mean, terrifyingly accurate, but horrible.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I'm thinking they might have to turn their competition skills to a different area.
 Oh, babe.<br/>
 But they were very cute.<br/>
 and they loved it. They did love it. They absolutely loved it. Yes. So yes, that was our highly
 cultured week. On top of that, we also had the first of our, probably many Christmas parties.
 Yes. We had our school Christmas party, which was wonderful. Good fun. It was great fun, wasn't it?
 Oh, yeah, it was tremendous fun. I always enjoy all the little skits and plays and that every year
 somehow, they, you know, each school year comes up with new things that are just humorous and
 brilliant and imaginative.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And then we had visitors in town.<br/>
 We had friends in town, Mark Jupont, who I'll put link in the show.
 Now, if you haven't heard Mark's podcast, he's got the deepest voice in the world.
 He does.<br/>
 And he doesn't sound like that, but he doesn't sound like this at all.
 He's a friend of ours that we've known for many, many years and is a.
 I introduced him once as the prophet.<br/>
 I'd most like to be in a bar fight with, like if I'm going to be in a bar fight,
 you don't mean against him.<br/>
 You mean with him against others.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah, I don't want him to have my back.
</p><ul>
  <li>Right, okay.
  </li><li>I think he'd know what to do,
 'cause he looks like a biker.
  </li><li>As far as fighting profits in bar fights,
 nevermind.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It sounded better in my head.
  </li><li>And then our friend Hugh from Australia came
 to stay for a few days.
 That was fun to catch up with you too.
  </li><li>It was very fun.
  </li><li>All right, look at that.
 We're through our week in less than five minutes.
  </li><li>Look at that people.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Check that out.
  </li><li>It's also 10 p.m. at night.
  </li><li>It is.
 I've had a long day at work and you stayed at home with the kids because they're not well yes MJ i'm sorry is the cutest little sick kid ever he is so adorable so he's not sick enough.
 To be more p and in pain but he is sick enough to have complete congestion and a very croaky voice yes and he doesn't have a fever and he's not coughing anything he's just adorable everything he says sounds cute i wish i wish i got on the podcast.
 Yeah, if he wakes up again, I'll record something with me already will three times.
 I don't think he's been asleep yet.
 All right, our main topic for tonight, you have to be very careful how you say our main topic.
 Yes, you do. You definitely do.
 So you say, all right, the main topic is big asks.
 Why did you make that the topic title?
 Well, I was thinking about how do you summarize what we're talking about.
 Okay. And it is for asking big things from God. It's having like a big expectation. So then I
 tried to, whenever I'm thinking about the topic, I'm always thinking about how to, you know, title,
 like, it's easy to find artwork, although it's going to be difficult to find something for big
 asks. Yes, probably. I have to be careful how to type that into Google. But it's more about how
 I actually put the text on top of it. And so you don't want something long. So I thought about big
 asks.
 Ah, okay then.
 So this all came about because more DePont, who we previously mentioned, was at Emony.
 And I'll post a link to that message that he did.
 It was a great message.
 He did a couple of things, talked about signs, wonders, miracles, and then talked about this
 whole premise of actually asking God for more vision.
 Do you remember this?
 Yeah, it was amazing.
 Yeah.
 One of the things that he talked about was that most times that we ask for vision, we're
 asking for an extension of what God's already doing in our lives as opposed to actually having
 a vision for what God can do.
 Right.
 He came up with this great line where he said, "Why don't we ask provision based on how
 God operates, not on what we can understand?"
 Right.
 We're just so true.
 We do that all the time.
 Totally.
 And we don't even realize that we're boxing God in.
 We're just thinking, "Lord, how much more do you want to add to what I'm already doing
 rather than perhaps change the direction of what we're doing?"
 I don't know, maybe not even changing the direction, but having, having a much larger vision and his challenge was that we would get to the end of 2017 and having seen what God's done, remind ourselves that we would never have believed it if we found out in 2016.
 Right.
 I think some of 2016 seems to be like that for us.
 Oh yeah, a lot of it's been like that.
 where I'm like, are you kidding me, God? Right now, like, are you kidding me? Like, what you've done,
 are you kidding me? And so I was thinking when he was sharing all that, like, oh, my gosh,
 when I have to up my expectation level more. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think,
 I mean, I think we've shared this before, but I remember in January, going into January
 of this year and the Lord just saying to me,
 I need you to work on your joy capacity,
 because what I'm gonna do this year
 is gonna blow your mind.
 And I was sort of like, huh, that's weird.
 And I would say, I would safely say
 that God has done a lot of that.
  </li><li>Right, it is crazy that he really is God
 and he really does know what he was doing.
 I feel like a bit like that.
 Like our summer was so awesome.
 We were telling you about it when he was here.
 our summer with moving house with getting this house,
 which is just a ridiculous blessing,
 with going to Disney with just,
 like our summer was just like the best summer
 I could possibly imagine was such a great summer.
 And I think there was some sense that once we got
 into the fall routine, I was like, okay, well,
 you know, summer is over and done with
 and now it's back to normal life.
 And I had, we haven't talked about this,
 maybe we'll talk about this subsequently,
 but I had a bunch of heart sink appointments,
 a horse sink. We need to talk about horse sink because it's awesome. But anyway, I went and got four ministry sessions. And in the middle of the ministry sessions, the Lord was speaking to me. And he was like, Alan, why have you relegated the way that I want to treat you with peaks and troughs? Why do you have this understanding that there are seasons of me blessing you? And then there's just seasons of like, just get back to life as normal.
 right or absence of blessing or whatever.
 Yeah, right. Why isn't life... I felt like the Lord wanted to just really challenge the way I
 thought about seasons and perhaps consider lifestyles. Like, I honestly felt like the Lord
 saying, "Honey, I have not reduced you back to mundanity and you can expect another breakthrough
 maybe next summer. I actually want to call you to a new level of expectation of thinking." So,
 Mark's word was just right in line with where we've been this year. At church this morning.
 Yep. There was this incredible testimony. Oh.
 And I tell you, the guy who gave the testimony was an excellent communicator.
 I mean, I don't know if he's used to public speaking, but he was a very engaging speaker.
 I'll put a link again on the show notes for people to be able to watch this testimony.
 Somebody in our church who had a $380,000 negative cash flow.
 wow he's a small businessman right and he's 380 thousand dollars in the hole and he's obviously
 naturally worried about how that's going to happen he's a commercial landscaper and he's asking the
 lord was doing the lord's attempt son you don't have a money problem you have a trust problem
 and he said well it sure feels like a money problem right but the lord was like you can trust
 me for $400, but you won't trust me for $400,000. The reason for that is, if I don't come through
 for $400, you can get the $400 yourself, so you never really had to trust. But if I don't come through
 for the $400,000 that you're trusting me for, you're disappointed, so you don't put any hope in it,
 you don't put any trust in it. And so he was talking about in this climate, our church takes up an
 offering and he was like, "Yeah, Lord, yeah, maybe offering would be good, but not in this
 season." And he felt like the Lord said, "No, well, why don't you actually practice trust
 and why don't you give this amount?" So he said to his wife, "I got an amount, what did
 you get?" She gets exactly the same amount. He says, "I wrote the check wondering if it
 would even cash." It's just like, "Oh God, I hope this goes through." And then nothing.
 Like no breakthrough. And so he was like, "Are you kidding me?" He said, "The last glimmer
 of hope that he had was sometimes in the winter because he's a commercial landscaper in the
 winter. He would also do snow and ice removal, but he said on December 26, the day after Christmas,
 it was like 75 degrees. So he was like, how's that ever going to happen? So he's thinking,
 there's no snow coming. Then all of a sudden, the snow shows up. And he said, in the first,
 I think he said first five days or the first week, he made $580,000.
 Which is amazing.
 This is ridiculous.
 Yeah.
 I think the trouble is often when we are looking for God to do a breakthrough, we are looking
 for explanations for how it's going to happen instead of actually having expectations that
 it's going to happen.
 Right.
 Have you ever fallen in the trap where you look back on a time when God's met you and
 then you start looking for the way that God met you in your present circumstances?
 You mean like to form a method.
 Exactly.
 Right.
 I had this need. So where is it? Where is it?
 This is how it's going to be this time.
 And you totally put God in a box forgetting that he's super creative and super imaginative.
 Right.
 I think the biggest difficulty living in that tension is actually having an expectation that
 God is going to be good without trying to attach how his goodness is going to come.
 Right.
 So I don't know who that's for, but I hope that's helpful for somebody today. Anyway,
 I guess in summary, God is in the business of doing more than we ask or imagine.
 Indeed.
 And Mark challenged us to take five to 10 minutes for the rest of December a day to just ask the
 Lord, Lord, what is it you want to do in 2017 that I can partner with you in excitement and
 envision? Yeah. And that was it. We said it would be short and it was short and sweet.
 Yes. Well, hopefully it was sweet, but was definitely short.
 Just in wrapping up, we want to let you know that our final podcast of the year will be up on
 Monday the 19th, which is next week. And then we're going to take a couple weeks off to just have
 time with our family and have a bit of a break. So the first podcast of the year will be up on
 January 9th. I figure that gives you guys a week to roll into it because I looked at the calendar
 and realized the first Monday was the 2nd of January. Yeah. I will not be in a swing of things.
 No. We'll still be in party season. Party season. Yeah. Because we are party animals.
 Yes, come January 9th, we'll do a full recap of the Christmas festivities and hopefully you guys are ready for the new year in 2017.
