<p> Mrs Jones yes sir beautiful time thank you darling.
 You look very handsome yourself.<br/>
 I feel very handsome sure talk to about this week.
 Wow i was a good week.<br/>
 You went camping.<br/>
 I did much to the shock of it would seem everybody on facebook including me everybody on the internet.
 So for our listeners, our church does something called a dad in me camp out run by our amazing children's pastor, Marty Curly.
 And so the idea is that dads take away their kids for a weekend, live in the wilderness, all bond and it was, it's very, very important that you understand this was an amazing weekend.
 And my difficulties with it have nothing to do with the weekend in and of itself.
 it has to do with the fact that it was camping and i have a hate hate relationship with camping
 in that hate camping and i hate every time we have wrong i am to hate camping because it's
 apparently awesome i think the only reason you ended up going was you had to announce it at church
 and you buy accident said i'll be going with the girls after you told me that you didn't want to go
 camping well i just you know you i think for me i go through life and i have decided that i don't
 like X, for example. But I'm also aware that I'm a very different person now than I was
 when I decided that I didn't like X. Does that make sense?
 Yeah, yeah.<br/>
 And I'm aware I've had some inner healing. And so I don't want to live my life based on
 a history of me liking or not liking something.
 Right.<br/>
 I'd rather have a present day experience.
 So you can try camping again in a couple of years?
 Yeah, sure.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Maybe I'll have had a lobotomy by now and actually find sleeping on the ground enjoyable. And
 So I say all that to say that there's a lot of people I greatly respect who love camping like myself
 Yes, but I mean I do respect you but you don't really talk about camping and I think people have you know
 It's probably my own fault, but I actually
 Well, it's I really like the outdoors. I was like no, I don't I like looking at scenery from the inside of an air-conditioned house
 So I would actually love to have a log cabin or a beautiful mansion in the middle of nowhere. I think that's lovely
 But actually going out and experiencing it the humidity and the bugs and the it's just not my cup of tea
 So I went and I we have two daughters. We have a seven-year-old and a four-year-old who's now turned five
 So I guess she's a five-year-old. I say that because today is her birthday. That's why it's confusing me and Abigail the seven-year-old
 She's up for anything. She loves everything and anything everything is awesome. Everything is a dance
 Everything is a song.<br/>
 Tia is like a four-year-old female version of me.
 So on the first night we get there,<br/>
 they're doing a treasure hunt and<br/>
 we're running around the middle of nowhere in the dark.
 And Tia, my four-year-old's like, daddy, this is so dumb.
 And I've been careful not to influence my kids either way.
 I've been high influencer.<br/>
 This is awesome.<br/>
 We're gonna have a great time.<br/>
 But Tia's like, daddy, this is so dumb.
 And every time we'd pick up a price,<br/>
 she'd be like, are we finished yet?<br/>
 And when we got back to where we started from, she's like,
 are you kidding me?<br/>
 We're back where we started.<br/>
 What was the point of this?<br/>
 And so then we went to sleep.<br/>
 And I'm not sure if this is campground protocol
 or what do you call it, campground.
</p><ul>
  <li>Edicate. - Edicate.
 But tents aren't actually soundproof.
 So it's just a thin piece of nylon
 that's separating you from the outside world.
 So I'm lying awake with my kids who are lying awake,
 sweltering heart and you know, they've given me a cop,
 which apparently is an upgrade from sleeping on the floor.
 And I can hear everything that's going on in all the tents.
 So people singing, people with guitars,
 people playing music, people talking.
 And I'm like, guys, it's like midnight.
 What's going on?
 And I'm thinking, do I practice powerful communication
 at this point?
 Or do I just go on a rampage with a baseball bat?
 I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do.
 We have a pastor, okay.
 Me and you, Jesus, me and you.
 But I guess, you know, every the next one was like,
 How did you sleep? And I'm like, I said like a peasant, like, why would I volunteer to sleep on the floor? I don't, I just don't understand this. I have a perfectly good bed at home. We have the West in heavenly bed. It's delightful.
 I have it's not that delightful.
 I have air conditioning. I have a German made air purifier and I abandoned all those things for what. So for camping, I love camping.
 Tell me about such high hopes of you liking camping.
 Tell me why you love camping.
 I love, I like getting out and away from everything
 and cooking my own food over the fire.
 I like the challenge of cooking healthy food over the fire,
 which you didn't get to try that really
 'cause all the food was provided.
 But I just, I like that stuff.
 I love the quiet of it.
 I mean, I haven't camped since we've had kids,
 but when I was single, I used to go camping.
 I mean, I went camping by myself, you know,
 just disappeared for a few days in the woods,
 which is dumb, but I did it because I loved camping.
  </li><li>Yeah, but you're starting to tell me
 what you love about camping.
  </li><li>I like the solitude, which you wouldn't have solitude
 with at a church event probably,
 but I just like that.
  </li><li>Or with children.
  </li><li>Solitude.
  </li><li>Maybe you need to revisit camping with your own children.
  </li><li>Well, I'll have to wait 'til I'm J's a little older,
 but yeah, I'd love to.
  </li><li>I like the solitude part, but I would go off
 and you know, would go stay at the Sheraton,
 you know, or just book out a room and just go away.
 and I'll have the salted part and just go and be with Jesus
 for like a couple of days in a hotel with a bed,
 without bugs, where I don't have to challenge myself
 to cook food, I can just eat food from room service.
 I don't understand why you wanna make things more difficult.
 That's what I understand.
  </li><li>Well, it's considerably cheaper to camp.
  </li><li>Yes, because you're living like a big rip.
  </li><li>And so you feel like you're being,
 (laughs)
 you're being thrifty as well as having all of that.
  </li><li>Well, it's confusing for me,
 clearly I'm in the minority because everyone was having an amazing time, which if I'm honest,
 actually just makes my issue harder because I'm like, clearly, I'm the odd one. I hear everybody
 else is ecstatic about being one with nature. And I can't wait to separate myself from nature and
 get into an air condition place with a reliable Wi-Fi signal.
 Well, there you go. Right.
 Rant complete.
 Yes. Why?
 I didn't want to be negative about that. I really enjoyed being with everybody.
 i'm just glad i came home early i bribed my children in the morning i'm not ashamed to say i woke up and i just said girls.
 We could stay here or we could leave now and daddy will buy you a toy at walmart and will go for dinner and then abigail was like but they're gonna have a movie and i will take you to the movies.
 The love of all that's holy i'll give you half of my kingdom if we can leave right now.
 and they were fine.
 Yeah, but they didn't want to stay baby.
 They told me the next day in the car, I was like,
 "Hey, how did it was camping and everything?"
 They're like, "It was fine.
 I'm like, did you like sleeping outside?"
 No, I didn't sleep.
 Mike, do you want to camp outside again?
 Not really, not if I have to sleep on the floor.
 I'm like, oh.
 They're probably too young.
 I think next year, you can just go into skies as a daddy
 and they'll probably have a much better time.
 I'll grow some fake facial hair and yeah.
 Yeah, I think that's the thing to do.
 Talk about Tia's birthday today.
 Well, Tia, well, Tia turned five today.
 And so she got her family presents this morning and had breakfast in bed.
 And she requested a gluten free banana and chocolate chip muffin, which is what she got.
 Pretty specific.
 Yep.
 And yeah, and then we went to sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.
 And I'm currently the party is two days away.
 So I'm currently working on all of the rainbow things that need to be accomplished before the rainbow party in two days time.
 So I've been trying to each night do one thing that needs to be done towards a party. So I'm not stressed on Saturday.
 And we have some spectacular rainbow jello desserts, which I was, you know, when you go to Pinterest,
 there's a great meme going around the internet called Pinterest fails, where you have the picture of what people were trying to achieve.
 and then what people actually produced and you know they're on two ends of a scale.
 And so I looked at this Pinterest thing that you wanted to do these Jello rainbow cups.
 And I thought there's no way that's going to work, but they have the spectacular,
 well, check our Instagram to see these works with beauties.
 Yes. And then you're also making a rainbow cake.
 I'm making a rainbow cake. So it's got six layers, six different colors of rainbow in it.
 And then the outside is six different colors of buttercream.
 So it's your lord.
 It's going to be quite the beast.
 Yeah.
 You said buttercream icing.
 I forgot how good that tastes.
 No, I think I'll have buttercream just breakfast tomorrow.
 No, on the topic of you making things, you made some delicious fish tacos.
 I did.
 I really did.
 I feel like my desire to find amazing fish tacos.
 I winged it today.
 I used cod and I used coconut
 flour, almond meal, and a whole bunch of spices.
  </li><li>Talk about your baja sauce.
  </li><li>Oh my baja sauce.
  </li><li>Well, let's pre-fix that by last night.
 We didn't, we were at youth and we hadn't eaten
 and so we thought we'll have fish tacos for dinner at 10 p.m.
 We got home and realized that was a particularly dumb idea.
 But while in Kroger's, we were trying to find
 all the ingredients for fish tacos.
 And I was sure I'd be able to buy off the shelf baja sauce,
 but looking through all the Mexican food, you know,
 there was no such thing. So I wandered around Kroger's was having a Mexican week. I'm sure they
 were gonna have a real life Mexican I could actually ask, but they didn't. And so I was just
 like, well, I guess we're gonna have fish tacos without baja sauce. But Jesus, the great providers,
 were checking out. There happens to be two people who are wearing the taco t-shirts because they
 work at one of the taco stands. So I ran out and said, look guys, I'm so sorry. I know you finished
 work. Where would I find taco sauce?
 Like Baja sauce for fish tacos.
 For fish tacos, and they looked to me, they're like, we just use ranch dressing.
 So I was like, really?
 My world kind of came crashing down.
 But you made your own Baja sauce.
 I talked about that.
 I mixed veganies or vaganies or however it's pronounced.
 Anyway, it's not actual mayonnaise.
 It's like a healthier version and an avocado and garlic and
 cilantro and a little bit of onion and then some garlic salt and salt and pepper and
 whatever made my own schnazzy sauce.
 But it was legit.
 Oh, so good.
 So it gluten-free shells and then your coconut flowering, crusted cod pieces, cod pieces,
 that sounds terrible.
 We had pieces of cod that were pan-fried in coconut flour, fried in coconut oil, dress
 with some raw cabbage, your baja sauce, some chopped tomatoes.
 It was yummy.
 It was legit, so well done on that one.
 I kind of want to make it again tomorrow.
 And on the topic of food, Master Chief, Master Chief.
 The heck is Master Chief?
 The French version of Master Chef is back on, which we both love.
 Yes, and Abigail is really into it now too.
 Which is great because we've told her a lie that if you want to be on MasterChef, you
 have to try lots of new things.
 That is not a lie.
 She wants to be on MasterChef Junior.
 I said to her, "You don't like food enough to be on MasterChef Junior because to be on
 MasterChef Junior, they actually, you taste the food as you go along and they can make
 all these different things.
 If you want to be on it, I'm all for teaching you how to cook honey, but you have to actually
 try new stuff."
 is fantastic because she's now empowered to try everything we put before her.
 So she tried three new things today and she was so excited. Mummy, I tried three new different
 foods today. So parents, lied to your kids and get them to eat a wonderful thing.
 It is not a lie. All right, our topic for this week. I wanted to talk about dads. It's Father's Day.
 Oh, by the time you guys listen to it, it will have been Father's Day, but
 we record these on a Thursday. So it's going to be Father's Day this Sunday. And so, obviously,
 have been thinking about thinking about that and got to speak to my parents today, got to speak to
 my dad and my dad's finally got an iPhone which is a sign and a wonder in and of itself. So we
 were faced with them while they were out. But I wanted to ask you, you know, lots of people have
 heard your testimony, the heard our testimony is teaching on the father heart of God. But I want
 to talk about what are some of your favorite memories of your dad?
 So most of my favorite memories are going to be from when I was like a little older, like a teenager.
 I mean, I have one good memory from when I was little. I was sitting on dad's lap,
 I'm maybe six or seven years old, and going through the Christmas wish book,
 which was out from Sears or whatever, and just writing a list of like potential things I might
 like for Christmas. I have that. But other than that, the rest of them are all from when I'm a
 teenager. But I remember lots of times sitting on the couch with my dad and he
 would be in the corner and I'd lean up against him and sometimes fall asleep on
 him and watch football together. And I never was into football but it was fun
 to just sit with my dad and watch it. I was thinking about this earlier my we
 were not a movie-going family at all. Like I can probably name on one hand the
 times we went together to see a movie theater, to go to a movie theater to see a movie at
 Beggaborn.
 So I was thinking about my favorite times was actually when my dad took me to the movies.
 I remember two distinct things.
 I remember three actually.
 It took us the whole family to CET.
 So the whole family we went to go to CET, which was amazing.
 But before that, or maybe not, we'd have to look at IMDB to see when these movies came
 out.
 But I remember just me and him went to go see Raiders of the Lost to Arc.
 No, not Raiders of the Lost Arc.
 Indiana Jones on the template doom. Oh, cool. Which was just amazing. I remember, I just
 like, I just thought, this is incredible. I'm out with my dad. We're going to see a
 movie. This is so awesome. And then he also took me to see Return of the Jedi, which was
 again amazing, you know, just so fun. But I think probably the most defining moment,
 or not defining moment, but one of my best memories was I didn't really get an allowance
 as a young child, I don't at least I don't remember getting an allowance.
 And I don't remember presence being a normal thing.
 You know, I've said of birthdays and Christmases, of course, but it wasn't normal to get presence.
 But I remember one day my dad and I had gone downtown and there was the big store that
 we would go to.
 It was called John Menzies and no longer exists, but it would probably be the equivalent, I
 don't know what it would be equivalent of, but it was a toy store and a bookstore and
 a new agent, and I remember it was the time when Return of the Jedi had just come out
 and one wall was absolutely devoted to these Star Wars figurines that you could collect.
 And I remember just looking at the wall and I wasn't wanting one of them because it wasn't
 normal for us to ask, "Can I have one of those things that wasn't what we did as a
 family?"
 But my dad, he'd gone looking at things and he found me looking at the wall and he said,
 "Do you want one?"
 And I just did not know what to...
 Are you kidding me?
 Yes, of course I want one.
 So I remember picking up one, I picked up one of those guards, you know, with the big
 tusks.
 Remember the beginning of the movie?
 I forget what their name is, but I remember picking up one of those and I picked up.
 Yeah, I just think this is the best day of my life.
 And then my dad said, why don't you get two?
 And I was like, the return of Jesus is imminent.
 It must be coming.
 It cannot get better than this.
 I'm sorry.
 I remember picking up another character.
 I don't remember what it was, but I just remember my mind being blown that I don't know
 whether it was my dad had this power that we could get things, you know,
 learned that that power was called money.
 But I just remember that being just, just something that sticks out in my head,
 even today, just in terms of the whole thing of generosity.
 And then the last one, which the girls always asked me to tell the story when
 they're in bed.
 As I remember as a young boy, we had a fairly large garden for the house that
 we grew up in.
 And there was a couple of major trees, really, really tall pine trees,
 since been removed because they were a bit of a threat to the house.
 And I remember climbing up one of their trees, I must have got really, really, really, really
 high.
 And then I remember getting stuck at the top of the tree.
 And I remember my mom calling us all to come in for dinner and here I am stuck at the
 top of the tree, freaking out.
 And I'm scared for a couple of reasons.
 I'm scared that I can't get down.
 And then I'm scared that my parents are going to be mad at me for going up there in the
 first place.
 And so my dad came out and I remember my dad climbing to the top of the tree and he wasn't
 mad. He wasn't angry. And I remember just putting my arms on his neck and then him climbing
 down the tree with me on his back. And I never remember getting reprimanded for it. You know,
 nobody was mad. But I just thought, gosh, that's such a great prophetic picture of my
 subsequent relationship with daddy God, you know, just just absolutely incredible.
 Yeah.
 When he comes to rescue, when you teach and you talk about, you know, you're talking about
 your journey with your dad, you tell some amazing stories when your relationship was
 restored with them. I think my favorite one of which is the chess story. Okay. Tell that
 story and set it up. Tell him about how smart your dad was.
 Oh yeah, my dad was like super, super smart. So I'd have to check with my mom, but he was
 like genius levels in terms of IQ. And he would read the Encyclopedia Britannica just
 for fun and just was always whatever he did.
 He did it with a level of excellence
 that he had scholarships all the way through,
 getting, he had three different degrees from university
 and he got scholarship 'cause his grade point average
 was always like--
 Insanely.
 It was insane.
 He was always top of the top.
 Right.
 So really, really smart and love chess.
 He was part of the chess club for the University
 of Michigan when he was there.
 And so we used to have Friday night dates.
 And I worked for a restaurant called the Keg.
 And he came and picked me up from the Keg.
 And we hadn't really decided what we're going to do
 necessarily.
 We either went to movie or we got food or we went bowling
 or we did something.
 And so he picked me up and we're walking through the mall.
 And there's a guy sitting there that plays chess.
 And this guy, what he does to make money
 as he sets up a long table with 10 chessboards and you pay $10 to play chess against him.
 And it's all timed through his old timer, so it doesn't take very long.
 And then if you win, he'll pay you $100.
 But I mean, obviously this is how he makes his money.
 Right.
 So he's playing 10 people at the same time.
 If you happen to win one of the games that you're playing him, he gives you a hundred
 bucks.
 Right.
 What do you pay to play?
 Ten.
 You pay ten and you can win a hundred.
 So at the time, I think there's only three or four other people playing, but my dad sort
 of saw him and kind of lit up a bit because he loves to play chess and basically whenever
 we would play, I just lose.
 So, you know, so he says, you know, do we have time?
 And I was like, sure.
 So he sits down to play and plays the guy and he wins.
 And so the guy says, you know, you can either hide your hundred dollars or if you will wait
 until these other two games are done,
 then, and play me one on one.
 If you win, I'll give you a thousand dollars,
 but if I win, then I get to keep the hundred.
 And so, again, my dad was like,
 okay, do we have time?
 And I was like, sure.
 So I just went to the food court and got a snack,
 and my dad ended up beating him.
 And so, he gets this thousand dollars from the guy,
 and my dad turns to me and he goes,
 let's go to New York City!
 And I'm like, when?
 And he's like, right now.
 I'm like, what?
 What?
 Because it's a 10-hour drive from Toronto.
 It's not like--
 Right.
 It's not close, you know?
 And he'd never suggested something like that before.
 And at the time, it's just he and I that live together.
 And so we drove home and packed a little bag.
 And he literally drove through the night.
 But he only usually slept like three or four hours a night
 anyway.
 And I slept in the car.
 And we went to New York City.
 And we stayed one night at the Waldorf.
 and we went to this big toy store that had two floors
 and that piano that you could walk on.
  </li><li>A few shorts.
  </li><li>Yeah, that one.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's a fairly famous toy store review.
  </li><li>I can't remember the name of it.
 And then, yeah, and we went and saw,
 I can't remember as a Lion King
 or it was some sort of Broadway show
 and just, I'm sure we spent well over $1,000
 but we had a lot of fun.
  </li><li>I think the moral of that story
 is I need to learn and play chess real good.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's definitely the moral of that story.
 It's actually a game I've never learned to play.
 I could teach you, but I pretty much can only teach you how to lose because that's what
 I'm really good at.
 We're not going to make our money, me losing chess.
 Probably not.
 I'll call Chris Locke and get him to teach me.
 Yeah, there you go.
 Tell me your best, the best qualities of your dad.
 As you look back in your dad's life, what were your favorite things about your dad?
 Why not he wise?
 Once he stopped drinking because he was a different person at that point, I would say
 he was very loving, really supportive.
 He liked, he just liked to be available.
 You know, I could go in and I could ball about something
 and he would just hold me and let me cry
 and not try and convince me not to.
 But he was also just very, very intelligent.
 And so when you needed the guy thinking
 and the problem solving end of that,
 he was available for that too.
 So, and he was into sport and so he was really fun.
 Like he just, he had a lot of energy
 and he liked to do crazy stuff at this period of the moment.
 So it was fun.
  </li><li>Did he have a sense of humor?
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, he was so funny.
  </li><li>He was?
  </li><li>Oh, he was so funny.
  </li><li>Like what sort of sense of humor though?
 Like what sort of funny was he?
  </li><li>Well, it kinda just depended where he was,
 but I say probably it was more sarcasm,
 but it wasn't quite as cutting as it was
 before he stopped drinking.
 Tell them about the tract he used to keep when people would come to the door to evangelize him.
 I don't think I can say those words on the thing, but he had made his own tract that said,
 "Jesus loves you on the front and you'd open it up."
 And it said, "But everybody else thinks you're an unpleasant word."
 And then he would just hand it to them and say, "Have a nice day."
 And he'd...
 For some reason, I find that incredibly funny.
 Yeah.
 He also made a little sheet that had a circle
 and the letters T-U-I-T in it.
 And whatever somebody would say,
 "Oh, I'm gonna do that as soon as I get around to it."
 Like around to it.
 He would literally go and stick it like in front of them
 and go, "There, you've got one now.
 Go get it done."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Maybe I made this up in my head,
 but did he also keep things in the car
 that he could leave when people
 swing shields when they'd part badly?
  </li><li>That was me.
  </li><li>Oh, that was you.
 Thank you, Barbara.
 I had, I had a father, a daughter, a family.
 I had cards about blind drivers of America and stuff like that that I would lead, you
 know, you've been nominated.
 This is before you met Jesus.
 I'd like to say yes, but I believe I continue to do.
 Before you had any real messages for people.
 Yes.
 If they don't be crazy.
 I was thinking about a sense of humor and I realized I developed my sense of humor by
 watching what my dad found funny. That was just my revelation tonight when I was thinking,
 you know, I was asking those questions. Because what he found funny, I so delighted in watching
 my dad enjoy himself or laugh or, you know, my dad's such an intelligent man. He's very, very
 intelligent. He's a PhD. He's now retired, but a world-leading scientist in his field. So very,
 very, very clever. And when we would see a movie or a TV show or a story that would genuinely
 evoke laughter, that was a magical thing for me as a kid to watch my dad be funny. And
 I think I probably paid close attention to what is it that makes my, what is it that
 evokes that reaction to my dad? And I'd say that we probably have very similar senses
 of humor, which is incredible. I was thinking about my dad, you know, the, I mentioned he
 super smart. He would probably be what we'd call very, very left-brained, in that he was really
 empirical, he was a research scientist, and so, you know, highly developed analysis and critical
 thinking skills. But at the same time, taught himself to play the guitar and taught himself to
 play the piano. So obviously, very musical, obviously, right-brain functioning really, really well.
 But aside from that, in terms of you build all the furniture in our living room, you know,
 the cabinets and the drawers and how we build a skateboard ramp. And yeah, and then the garden,
 you've been to our house, our garden is just incredible in terms of the way it's laid out.
 So just thinking about how smart and how creative my dad was.
 And the other thing that I loved about my loved, not past ends, the other thing I really love about
 my dad, but growing up that was really astounding to me was how well he loved my mom. It's really,
 really good at honoring my mom. And I remember all the weddings, I got three sisters. So
 watching them get married in my own wedding when he would give us speech.
 He'd always take time to honor my mom, which I just thought was amazing.
 I probably learned my work ethic from my dad as well.
 You know, he loved to work and everything he did, he found joy in, which I think I inherited from him as well.
 Talk about you and your relationship with then Father God.
 How did you, for those of you who don't know, I'll give you, I'll steal the show for a second.
 AJ did not have a good experience with her father growing up.
 Then through a series of fairly dramatic circumstances,
 ended up having a great relationship with her dad,
 which then turned out not so good.
 And so I'm wondering, AJ, how you ended up with such a rich relationship with the father,
 for which you're known around the world for.
 How does a girl who's got some really big daddy issues
 end up with an astonishing relationship with father God?
 Um, a lot of inner healing would be the really short answer, but I guess really the thing
 is I ended up being brought to a father heart church where that was really the message that
 was coming out of the church in Toronto.
 What do you mean the father heart church?
 Well, the message that God loves you, I mean, not just he loves you, but he doesn't like
 you or he loves you because he has to or he loves you but you have to perform like this
 but God loves you exactly the way you are.
 The message, that message of Father's heart towards his kids from the perspective of God
 was like the overarching message that came out of the church in Toronto that I got, you
 know, that I was part of for 20 years.
 So I was brought to that church when I was in a very destructive state.
 I was still very suicidal and it was maybe three months after my dad had killed himself
 on Father's Day.
 And so, you know, I was, I was a mess.
 And I came to this place that talked about a father who would love me, could love me back
 to life, wanted to heal me.
 And I was just desperate enough to say, "Okay, God, if that's who you really are, then I
 want to know you."
 But that process of knowing was probably a good 10-year process.
 I mean of God pulling little wounds out and pulling big wounds out and replacing ungodly
 beliefs about what he's like with the truth of who he is.
 many levels, it was very, very painful, but on many levels, it was absolutely amazing to
 partner with God in releasing pain to him and trusting him and then letting him bring healing.
 So yeah. I would say our relationship with the Father is the greatest thing about our life.
 Oh, yeah, for sure. I mean, as astonishing as our life in us and as grateful as I am for all
 of things I have in life, including you and the kids and our house and the church we get to live
 out and the fact I get to live in America and fish tacos and everything that's awesome in life.
 The relationship that I developed with the Father and that you have with the Father,
 I was saved for years and years and years before I ever met the Father.
 I just think the revelation of the Father's love is the good news, which Jesus came to proclaim.
 Yeah. I mean, Jesus came to reintroduce us to the Father to show us the way home.
 Yeah, I love that line was a Jack Frost. I would say that Jesus is the way, the truth,
 and the life for Jesus to be the way there must be a destination. Yeah.
 He pointed the way home, which I think is amazing. One of the things we're known for,
 if we're known for anything, is probably the Father's love and our experiences with the Father.
 and you probably know this already, but AJ wrote a book called Finding Father. Talk to
 me about how you wrote that book. I'm trying to write a book and it's, it seems overwhelming.
 So talk to me about how you got that written because you wrote the whole thing in 12 weeks.
 I did, yeah. Just astonishing. Well, I mean, I had taken previously, I had written or started
 writing it twice. So the first time I got in like six or seven chapters in and then deleted the
 whole thing. And then the second time I was like three or four chapters and
 then deleted the whole thing. Apparently you're not supposed to do that. I know, I know.
 Somebody told me that afterwards. Okay. But I was trying to figure out how do I write
 this in a way that it's going to be honoring and not shatter my family, but truthful and
 get the message out kind of thing. Right. Because you had a fairly horrendous
 background. Right. So I just started praying. I was like, Lord, I need a better way to do
 this and I ended up having a dream and in the dream I saw the title page of the book.
 I saw the words finding father.
 I saw the title page of the book and I saw it laid out as a 12 week book and I saw which
 verses like beside each.
 Now that's just cheating.
 I know it was really cheating and I remembered it when like when I woke up but I mean I have
 a photographic memory anyway but I mean I woke up and I could just write out and so that's
 what I did and there was only two days I couldn't remember what verse was there so when I went
 to go write those. I was like, okay, Lord, I can't remember what the plan was for this
 day. Right. Yeah. So that's how I wrote it. Okay. So I had a plan. It was easy to do.
 I need you to lay hands when we give me that impartation. Yeah, you know, I need a plan
 for book two because I'm stuck at chapter three. So if we in our talking about dads,
 evoke some nervousness, some anxiousness, some outcheese in your heart, I'd really recommend
 ages book. It's available in paperback, you can get it from our website at Allen and AJ
 dot com, or you can get it in Kindle version, or you can get it for your iPhone or your
 iPad. But it's an amazing 12 week study into the very heart of the father. It helps you
 understand some of the wrong thinking that you will have placed on God from your upbringing.
 And you probably haven't even realized you've done that. But I would really encourage you
 that everything in my life changed when I discovered that God was for me and not against me.
 And I knew that there was a verse in the scripture that said that,
 "Loving a real life, tangible experience with a father and his love and his affection,
 absolutely redefined everything in my life." Everything I approach and I was from the position
 of knowing that God is my dad and he's for me and I'm his favorite son. And it's just astonishing.
 I mean, the design of the book is to move head knowledge to heart knowledge, you know,
 so that it's not just something that, well, you know, I've been saved for X amount of
 years and I know this to be true, but when it's moved to your heart, you live like it's
 true.
 And so sons and daughters live like they know that they're loved.
 That's right.
 And it changes everything.
 If you're not a reader and you prefer it to be someone who listens or you learn better,
 you receive better through listening.
 We've also got the majority of that book in teaching on a CD.
 You have a CD set called Finding Father as well.
 You can either order the CDs or you can just download the MP3s off our website too.
 I want to pray for you guys, everybody who's listening, especially if you don't know your
 dad or you had bad experiences with dads, I'm just going to pray and ask that you're
 having to follow with introduce himself as the perfect father.
 And then we're going to wish you a great week.
 Father, I thank you for everybody who's listening right now.
 I want to thank you that you love them so much, that you dive for them to restore
 them to a relationship with you and Lord, you're the kindest person
 wherever you're going to meet.
 You're so astonishing in your love and in your gentleness and in your kindness.
 And I'm asking that right now that your love would go deep into the hearts of everybody
 who's listening to this, that you would lift off all the wounding, Lord, that perhaps
 We've accumulated through life from fathers or father figures,
 not from the ways our earthly fathers may have let us down or disappointed us,
 that you would come and reveal your fathering love to us in new ways.
 Jesus, I thank you that you came to reveal the father,
 that you came to show the way to the father.
 You came as an ambassador of your father's kingdom, just to say,
 he wants you as part of the family.
 And if you don't know Jesus, if you don't know this love,
 then he would love to bring you into his family. It's very simple. You just realize you're in need of
 saving that there's sin in your life. There's things that you've done wrong. There's things that
 you can't get free of. And that's the first step you just admit, "Oh, I actually need help. I am,
 I can't do this on my own. I actually need rescuing." The second thing is you realize that God's made
 provision for a rescuer and his son Jesus. And you just need to acknowledge that Jesus. I believe
 that you came from your father in heaven to rescue me and to save me by dying on a cross.
 And then third of all, you just need to ask Jesus to forgive you of the things you've done wrong
 and ask him to come into your life and to introduce you to the Father. And then you get to start the
 most amazing journey. By the way, you may be a Christian, you may have prayed a prayer like that,
 but you stopped at knowing the Father and never got to know, sorry, stopped at getting to know Jesus
 and never got to know the Father. Well, you've just got an amazing journey ahead of you.
 Yeah. And so, Father, I pray that wherever we are in our journey that you would come and bring
 greater revelation of your love and affection. And, you know, lastly, I'm just going to say,
 I'm a dad. I have three kids. And then I'm a spiritual dad to many more than that. But I wanted
 to stand in place of your earthly Father. If you've been abandoned or rejected or abused by
 your earthly father. I'm just going to stand in for a second and just say, I'm so sorry
 that that happened to you. And I'm just going to ask that in this moment right now, it may seem
 totally random. Would you forgive me? Would you forgive your earthly father for any way that he
 let you down? And in doing so, in extending forgiveness to your father, you open the floodgates for
 your heavenly father to come in with his love and his affection. So father, would you bless this
 week Lord of everybody who's listening and would you lead us into greater
 revelations of your love and your affection. Yeah. In Jesus name Amen. Amen.
 Well you guys are awesome. We love getting to invite you into our house on a Thursday night as we
 get to talk to people all over the world. We hope you have an incredible week filled with fun,
 filled with adventure and we will see you next week. Yeah we'll be back next week. Bye.
 Bye.
