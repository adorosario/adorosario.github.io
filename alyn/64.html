<p> Good evening Mr Jones Mrs Jones how the heck are you i'm well how are you i am.
 Ironically exceptionally well good i say ironically because i have been struck with the man called of two thousand fifteen you definitely have the man called of two thousand fifteen or the dreaded lergie.
 Day quill has been my friend and constant companion yes and i call has seen me through the night.
 Yes and then seeing you tonight is done me no favor.
 What last night i thought i was drowning in my own snot woke up gasping for air but you seemed
 unaware of my current plight well i had to drive myself to sleep so that i could get any sleep whatsoever
 with the amount of noise in the room i apologize no problem ladies and gentlemen welcome to episode 64
 keeping up with the jones is keeping up with the jones is well we had a very busy week we did the
 voice of the apostles were in time this week yes and their bodies as well not just their voices so
 The Voice of the Apostles is a conference that is run annually by Randy Clark and he booked
 out the Music City Centre, is that what it's called?
 Yeah, Music City Centre.<br/>
 It is a massive building.<br/>
 Enormous.<br/>
 Between the Convention Centre and the hotel is spent three city blocks.
 Yes.<br/>
 And we did an awful lot of walking.<br/>
 We did a lot of walking, but we got our rings.
 We did get our rings.<br/>
 If you saw on Instagram my phone, I just broke all the records this week from walking, walking,
 amazing. And we even found a plug to plug in our car. Yeah. So we would plug, you know, get into the parking lot and plug it in. And by the time we came back out, our car was fully charged. Bob's your uncle. Yeah.
 You know, if ever there was an opportunity for segue entrepreneurship, it would be renting out segues inside the music city center.
 Yes, my only possible concern with that would be segues and escalators.
 I think of the YouTube likes.<br/>
 I can't.<br/>
 I'm a mother.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Well, it was great.<br/>
 It was a great week.<br/>
 We had like eight, nine thousand people at that event.
 Yeah, they did.<br/>
 It was huge.<br/>
 And I mean, everybody was there.<br/>
 Bill Johnson, John Arner, Randy.<br/>
 Heidi in Roland, Reinhard Bonkey, Lafe Hetland.
 Yeah, it was just crazy. It was super fun. We loved it. Yeah, we also ended up with an unexpected house guest, which is really fun. Yeah, house guest slash friend. Yes. Somebody we never met before, but we heard a lot about Jamie Galloway.
 Yeah, it was very fun and he likes coffee. So that means he's welcome. We discovered an amazing app called Chore Monster. Yes. Parents out there.
 If your kids are struggling to do chores, go ahead and download Chore Monster.
 Enders and chores you would like your kids to do, attach points that you would value those chores for.
 And they will take great delight in taking off their chores in order to earn points, which they can redeem for rewards.
 Yes, that's what we're doing.<br/>
 Currently we have two rewards.<br/>
 Yes, because we're not that creative and the reward department.
 If you get 10 points, you can have your iPad for half an hour.
 If you get 50 points,<br/>
 You can have five bucks.<br/>
 Five dollar.<br/>
 But I'm pretty confident because my children have not yet grasped the concept
 of delayed gratification that will never be paying out cash.
 Yeah, we just saved ourselves an enormous amount of cash.
 You had an MRI this week.<br/>
 I did have an MRI for your shoulder.<br/>
 My shoulder.<br/>
 Yeah, because they don't know what's going on.
 They have no idea what's going on.<br/>
 And you won't let me operate.<br/>
 No, strangely.<br/>
 All those years at Harvard Medical wasted.
 Yeah.<br/>
 You just won't trust me.<br/>
 Nope.<br/>
 OK, talk about MRIs.<br/>
 Well, it's a very bizarre experience.<br/>
 You feel it a form that basically guarantees you have no extra metal in your body, which
 makes you really think about is there possibly some metal in my body that I didn't think
 about your adamantium bone structure.<br/>
 Oh, and then you lie in this bed and they stick you in this tube that is so close to
 your face.<br/>
 Like, I don't know if they just put the bed up like higher so that it's always really,
 really close to you.<br/>
 I have no idea.<br/>
 it was pretty intense. I'm a little bit claustrophobic, so they give you this panic alarm and they
 put on hearing protection, which was not enough hearing protection for me.
 Because the thing is super noisy? It's so noisy. And I have sensitive hearing anyway,
 but I was like this, I feel like somebody is doing a jackhammer on my head and you're in there for
 half an hour. So it was pretty intense. So I just ended up literally, I prayed for everybody I could
 think of while I was in there to just be like, okay, I'm just going to pray for other people
 so that I'm not thinking about the fact that I'm in a tube with a piece of plastic about
 an inch for my nose. So you get results of your MRI back tomorrow? Yep. All right.
 Our topic for this week is the joy of social media. It is. And I mean that quite sincerely.
 Probably the most open to apps on my iPhone and I suspect yours would be social media apps.
 Yes.<br/>
 Where do you want to start?<br/>
 Let's start with our favorite app.<br/>
 Well my favorite app would easily be Instagram.
 Yes, we do.<br/>
 And I looked at my first picture I've reposed to Instagram.
 It was not interesting.<br/>
 What was it of?<br/>
 It was a box of voice recorders from Profeding Ministry, which I clearly thought, "I don't
 know what this app is.<br/>
 I wonder how it works."<br/>
 Oh, you take a picture.<br/>
 There's a box.<br/>
 I'll take a picture of that.<br/>
 But I love that app.<br/>
 It's a perfect mix of creativity, expression, and windows into people's lives.
 And so I just love following my friends on Instagram and getting caught up on what's
 going on in life, whether it's videos or little snapshots.
 And there's a lot of cynicism around there that it's the best version of your life.
 But I don't care.<br/>
 I think it's just fantastic.<br/>
 I love being able to follow what's going on in people's lives.
 I know lots of people though that post the not best version of their lives just because
 I mean I posted a picture last week when I was in agony because I thought you know what
 most of my friends follow me on Instagram. Some of them are going to be awake somewhere
 in the world and I need prayer because I'm in so much pain. But I think that's true
 for the most part we do post the more of the successes than the failures.
 Yeah but I think that's true in life anyway.
 Yeah, sure.<br/>
 With people who aren't your close friends for dinner and people are like hey you know what's
 going to life, you tell them the best things are going on. It's usually with your close
 friends that you tell them the real stuff that's going on. So I don't think that's
 a fair criticism.<br/>
 Yeah. I mean, yeah.<br/>
 I'd say that Instagram is my favorite app on my iPhone.
 Oh, by far. It's the one that I open the most and probably enjoy the most. I think
 also I'm a very visual person. So, you know, I actually use it for praying for people.
 Yeah. Talk to me about that.<br/>
 Well, you know, I don't obviously for most of us, you don't tend to follow as many people
 as follow you.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And so I tend to only follow people that I'm really actually interested in their lives
 and what they're going through or whatever.
 And so as I'm going through, that's a horrible way of putting it right.
 It's kind of horrible way of putting it, but it's the truth, so move on.
 Okay.<br/>
 It'll make what I say about Facebook later seem really, really nice.
 Oh good.<br/>
 I wouldn't make you seem nice.<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 I use it to pray.<br/>
 Like I, you know, I'm looking through and,
 oh, my friends on the road to go see their parents in Maine.
 Oh, you know, whatever.<br/>
 And I'm, I just pray as I'm going through like,
 okay, father bless you, trip, help the kids.
</p><ul>
  <li>You're a spiritual giant.
  </li><li>You know, that's not a spiritual giant.
 That's just like, you know, I during throughout the day,
 I'll do, you know, pray for myself for different things.
 But this reminds me to pray for my friends.
  </li><li>I can honestly say that praying for people
 while scrolling through Instagram is not what happens in my head.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
 I would say every time I open the app, I'm praying for people.
  </li><li>That's what I mean, there's a spiritual challenge.
 There's a generation to me.
  </li><li>Oh, thanks.
  </li><li>I'm gonna try praying for people when I look at Instagram.
  </li><li>It's really fun.
  </li><li>Right, but what happens, you're like,
 "Mm, father, I just pray that they really enjoy
 "that 100 layer donut.
 "Mm, father, I pray that they really enjoy
 "that nice little latte."
 "Mm, what do you pray about?"
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I don't necessarily pray.
 Well, I do, I pray over like $5 break
 or pray for their business and stuff like that.
 So when I see those kind of postings and I'm praying for their business,
 you truly are a proverb 31 wife.
 You're so funny.
 You're amazing.
 But I mean, I'm mostly, it's mostly like, you know, because moms will post pictures
 like, Oh, my guns is sick.
 And I'm like, Oh, you know, so I'll, I do that kind of stuff.
 Or if somebody's not feeling well or I love you, babe.
 Thanks.
 Instagram for me is the perfect balance of what I love about Twitter and what I
 love about Facebook.
 Okay.
 Explain that.
 Well, let me talk about Twitter and let me talk about Facebook and it should
 become apparent. Okay. All right, Twitter. Yes.
 Twitter launched in July of 2006. Yes.
 I heard about it and joined about it in January 2007. Yeah.
 As soon as I heard about it, I loved the concept. Yeah, you were super excited.
 I was super excited. I remember where we were because we were in the London
 Sheraton by the by Heathrow Airport. Yeah. And I had just, at those days, you had to go up to
 the club lounge to get internet access and eat tapas. We would, we'd eat tapas and
 connect with the world connect with the world and then i come back and i did babe this is a thing called twitter
 and it's amazing it's a hundred forty characters and you talk about what you're doing it's like
 microblogging because at that point i'd kind of given up blogging i'd spent a couple years blogging
 but i didn't want to disconnect from people and from the world and this was just like
 who doesn't have time to write a hundred forty characters i thought it was brilliant right and
 the whole pitch of twitter at the time was what are you doing right now yeah so it was very present
 It was very short attention span geared.
 It was perfect for my personality.
 Right.
 What did you think right told you about it?
 It's like that'll never last like nobody's ever going to do that.
 Because I just was like Facebook.
 You can get more information in those pictures.
 And Twitter was just like, I mean, you can't even say in my mind, I was like,
 what can you say is valuable and 140 characters?
 And you held out for a good two years.
 I did. I resisted.
 You did not join until February 2009.
 Yes, and your first tweet because you're so excited and answering the question what are you doing right now was what am i doing question mark going to bed exclamation mark times three.
 I'm always very excited when i get to sleep yeah it's really it's a banner moment for me what i love about the twitter model is.
 It's this incredibly simple premise,
 but it actually gives you the capability of contacting almost anyone on earth.
 Like I could tweet the president of America tonight.
 I could send him. Yeah. At Potus.
 Okay. And somebody who works for him might know it says on account.
 He tweets from that account. Seriously? Yeah. And celebrities.
 and, you know, I mean, anybody, everybody who's on Twitter, you can directly reference them,
 and it will show up in their @ replies. That's an incredible concept. I don't know the email address
 of, say, Rick Warren. But I do know how to contact Rick Warren if I needed to. And he does reply to
 people on Twitter. That's an amazing piece of technology, an amazing facet. So what I love about
 Twitter is that I can follow anybody I would like, and I can also read anybody's tweets without
 following them too. So there's people that I don't necessarily, they may be like
 prolific tweeters and I don't want my timeline because I'm pretty much an
 auto-compleaser on Twitter. Like I want to read everything in my feed. Some people
 are, I'll just read whatever's there but... Oh I can't do that. I know. I want to go
 backwards and I want to make sure I've read everything. I need to do that in
 Instagram too. I need to make sure that I've caught up to the last picture that I
 saw so that I'm up to date. I'm the same. Which is probably why we have very, very
 few people we actually follow because we want to be diligent in how we approach that.
 Yeah, and I mean, I pray for those people too, so it takes me a little bit longer.
 You and your prey on social media. I just scroll in favor or like, "Yeah, babe, can I tell you what
 I'm doing while we're recording our podcast?" Yeah.
 "I'm flipping back through Instagram trying to find my original first picture."
 So you're currently researching your first picture on Instagram. There's better be worth it.
 I guarantee it's a child or a plate of food.
 Well, it isn't it's a tree.
 Well, I'm there.
 I found it.
 It's a tree.
 OK, I'm glad you took that effort.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's a pretty tree.
 What do you think about Twitter now that you've been using?
 I don't use Twitter really.
 So even that much like I might tweet.
 I was going to say, to it something.
 I might tweet something like once or twice a week if that, probably more like once a week.
 And it's usually just if I've heard some profound thing.
 Like you retweet something that...
 Yeah. Or I'm listening to a teaching while I'm walking or whatever. And I think,
 "Oh, that's amazing." And the thought has stuck with me all day, then I might tweet that out.
 that's that's one of the aspects of twitter i love is that we we live in a very twitter centric.
 Congregation so when i was a preaching it's amazing to get real time feedback while you're teaching to see your your twitter what hit the market yeah i think that's an amazing tool that was never there before you know the only equivalent would be somebody staying behind the shaking your hand on a Sunday morning.
 Thank you pastor i really appreciate this but now people can just tweet the stuff that impacted them and then retweet and you know run around it goes yeah.
 Yeah it's great i still like instagram better cuz i'm just so visual yeah you like the pictures but i like that on instagram i can hit post a facebook post to.
 Twitter that's the thing annoys me though i get frustrated seeing the same post on multiple networks.
 but i'm as guilty of that as anybody else i just try and space it out.
 But then you have to go back in a repost who has time for that i use an app called buffer which automatically.
 Yeah i'm sorry.
 Alright let's talk about the elephant in the room.
 Facebook i don't want to be negative about facebook.
 But i don't enjoy using facebook why.
 Well for starters i'm quite picky about my software and i really don't like the user interface and i really don't like their approach to for example the timeline confuses me the timeline in twitter and instagram makes sense to me.
 like i'm looking at things from now and then i if i scroll up i'm looking at things in the past right in on facebook.
 It seems to populate my timeline with stuff i'm not interested in nor is chronological right it might not be current it might be something that happened to weeks ago or maybe something i've already seen that it's repopulating is bubble back up and i'm like i already saw this.
 i will i usually think somebody's gone in for second surgery for the same thing you know because it doesn't occur to me that face book would pull something that they've already posted weeks ago and repost it right so i'm like oh my gosh the first one didn't work.
 The other weird thing about facebook and i i understand why they do this and it kind of makes sense is just not the way i live.
 In the with instagram and twitter you have a follow mentality and i know that face book is kind of introduced this.
 but basically you can follow me and I don't have to follow you or vice versa.
 Right. On Facebook, if somebody requests to be my friend, basically the way I interpret that is,
 is you're asking to see the content I've produced.
 Okay, I'll let you do that. But that automatically then says, "Oh, great, Alan, you get to see
 everything person X has produced." And I'm like, "That's great, but I might not be interested in
 what they're seeing." In fact, I can almost guarantee I won't be interested in what they're seeing,
 or I would have already friended them.
 Gotcha.
 That makes sense.
 Like I'm already following the people I'm interested in.
 Right.
 And so...
 But what if you don't realize that person's interesting?
 You may not know.
 That's true.
 But because of the way the timeline works,
 things there's no guarantee that the person I just followed,
 I'm actually ever going to see their stuff.
 That is absolutely true.
 So it requires an awful lot of curation to get your timeline
 to a state that I'm actually happy with.
 Which of course you can't do.
 Well, you can do.
 You can click this little drop down button
 that says, "Don't show me any more posts from this person."
 What?
 Yes.
 I didn't know this.
 Well, this is why I exist.
 Okay.
 This is why you exist to help me curate Facebook.
 Thanks, sweetheart.
 Right.
 Think of all the people who are not going to be getting your prayers after tonight.
 Do you pray on Facebook too, or do you just grown on Facebook?
 I do.
 I get more frustrated with Facebook because I think also because there's ads.
 So one thing I do enjoy with Facebook is sometimes there's like little clever videos,
 you know, where you're just like, oh, that was really funny.
 And I probably never would have seen that because it's not a, from a TV show that I
 watch, or, you know what I mean?
 So I enjoy those little like snippets of things.
 But then, you know, there's always the sponsor feeds and, you know, or the woman that's lost
 500 pounds while her husband was in Iraq.
 And it's always the same story, but different pictures of different females.
 I need to show you a plugin that will remove all the ads from Facebook.
 Yeah, it's true.
 Yeah, I need that.
 The other thing about Facebook that I've noticed is there's a higher level of crazy
 on Facebook than is apparent on Twitter and Instagram.
 Please define crazy.
 Well, what I mean is if I tweet something
 and you don't like it, yeah, you can either just ignore my tweet and it will
 just go by and you're likely not to see it again.
 Right.
 Or if you are really feeling passionate, you can reply to me.
 I tell you disagree.
 And I can either read that and choose to respond to it or not.
 But the point is your reply will only be seen by people who happen to follow you and me.
 Right.
 On Facebook, if I put the same post and you don't like it, you can make your feelings
 known on my post.
 And so what's happened is I'm leveraging other people's opinions to my audience, which
 I don't like doing.
 I'm happy for you to express your opinions to your audience, but I actually haven't
 invited you to share the microphone, so to speak.
 And some people have full on wars on their Facebook pages.
 Oh, for sure.
 Yeah.
 My dream when I'm feeling not very responsible as a leader is to post a slightly inflammatory
 post on Facebook arguing for or against circumcision, vaccination, gun control, my opinions on
 gay rights and my choice of political candidate just to see what would happen.
 It's like throwing a grenade into, you know, an already burning fire of kerosene.
 Right.
 And yet it seems to attract people who think this is the perfect venue for me to
 express my opinions in a sentence on this highly controversial topic.
 I wonder if those people just don't feel like they feel heard anywhere else.
 I don't know.
 I think it's like insanity.
 Yeah.
 It's not the great place to be expressing opinions on highly volatile topics.
 Typically, I don't I don't try and launch into highly volatile topics with the possible
 exception of Halloween because it's fun.
 See, but I think it's a fool's errand.
 I think if Facebook was available in King Solomon's day, most of Proverbs would be
 written about Facebook followers.
 Wow.
 I'm sure you could still apply all the verses about the fool and the folly to
 Facebook.
 I don't have a sermon illustration of that, so but I'd like to apologize for the stuffiness of my nose.
 I'm sure it's gross, especially if you're listening through headphones.
 I apologize.
 It's kind of cute though.
 It's a cute kind of stuff.
 That's not filling up all my breathing apparatus is cute.
 We can't hear that.
 You just sound cute.
 What about?
 Well, hang on.
 You haven't told me what you like about Facebook.
 I like pictures.
 I'm always about the pictures.
 The thing that I like better about Facebook than Instagram and that's probably
 the only thing is events.
 So for example, somebody gets married and they post their wedding
 pictures or whatever.
 And they got married in wherever New Zealand Iceland someplace where I, I
 didn't make the wedding.
 I can't make the wedding Instagram.
 Most people are only going to post one or two pictures.
 They don't want to blow up your feed.
 Hopefully, you know, so there's one or two pictures.
 Well, I can go to Facebook, look that person up, and maybe look at 20 or 30 pictures, and
 I can get an idea of what did the room look like and all that kind of stuff.
 And that probably doesn't matter a whole lot, maybe to you or to boys.
 That's astonishing insight.
 But for me, I'm like, oh, look, they had their whatever fairytale wedding, or they,
 this represents them so well or whatever.
 So I love that with like baby pictures or whatever that it's more than just one picture.
 And sometimes there's like little goofy pictures where you're like, oh, see good.
 They're happy or whatever.
 The other thing that's good about Facebook.
 Yeah.
 And I really applaud them for this is they have mass market appeal.
 Yeah.
 And by that, I mean, people from my mother's generation, they get Facebook.
 They understand how it works.
 My mom never understood email.
 She didn't understand Instagram.
 But boy, did she understand Facebook.
 She really did.
 She was great at it.
 And so I think the most alarming thing for us, I think the most alarming thing for me
 was when we started our efforts on alanajai.com, you know, publishing articles and doing the
 podcast is, you know, obviously we let people know on various social networks that hey, there's
 a new article or whatever. When I was looking at the traffic and where it would come from,
 overwhelmingly it was coming from Facebook, that was a shock to me because I hardly ever use Facebook.
 It was a shock to me that the rest of the world was. And so that really made me go, okay, you
 you actually have to get back into Facebook world
 and learn about it.
 Do you know the one redemptive factor about Facebook?
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>Is there a fantastic app called Paper?
  </li><li>They do or there is an authentic app.
  </li><li>Facebook engineers wrote an app called Paper.
 And it's their next generation browsing client for Facebook.
 It's really clever, it's really beautiful.
 It solves all my gripes about user interface
 and user interaction.
 And if you haven't checked out,
 I'd really encourage you to do it.
  </li><li>Can I ask a brief question?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How long have you had this app?
  </li><li>I don't know since it came out.
  </li><li>Which was when?
  </li><li>I don't deal in time.
  </li><li>Dude, I'm just hearing about this for the first time today.
  </li><li>You know what?
  </li><li>I sleep next to you.
 And Facebook is so frustrating at times.
  </li><li>I was scared that when I told you about Twitter,
 it took you two years to take my advice.
 I just kind of--
  </li><li>And that's what it is.
  </li><li>Yeah, I quarantined my input,
 lest you shun me again.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm so sorry, babe.
 I totally repent for that.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Okay, paper, got it.
  </li><li>Papi, if you're French.
  </li><li>I also like, I don't know if it's a social media app
 necessarily, but I love the yellow app with the dinosaur,
 the Time Hop app.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm sure the people who came up with that name
 was just thrilled that you've reduced it
 to the yellow app with the time of song.
  </li><li>Well, again, visual person, I love Time Hop.
  </li><li>This is what I understand Time Hop to be,
 is on any given day, it will flag a photo that maybe you took or a thing you posted two
 years ago, 18 months ago, you posted this.
 No, it's never going to be 18 months ago.
 It's always going to be on a year mark, so a year, two years, seven years.
 Right.
 So why do you care about that, given that's in the past?
 I think for, well, I love seeing pictures of the kids as they are growing up and it just
 reminds me of how cute and cuddly they were once.
 I'm not going to have ferocious.
 No, but I mean, I like that you get to watch them grow, but I think also you tend to because
 you tend to post the things that you're celebrating, which is what we talked about as a weakness
 of Instagram, right?
 Your time hop tends to be a reminder of those things that you have celebrated in the past.
 And therefore a reminder of things that God has done in your life, either through you
 or for you that you celebrated at one point and it reminds me to be thankful.
 So I like look back at those things and I think, oh wow, like, I mean, I've seen time
 hops over like when Abby was in the NICU and stuff and I remember how hard those days
 felt, you know?
 And then I think, but there she is and she's eight years old and she's really tall and
 you know, she's fine.
 And you know, so you just, it reminds me to be thankful.
 It reminds me that God's done amazing, amazing things.
 Even if this week it felt like ho-hum and just nine to five, God has throughout, you know,
 been doing cool things and it reminds me of that.
 You know what social media tells me?
 What?
 That you're a spiritual giant.
 You're either praying for people or you're giving thanks for things.
 It's amazing.
 Yeah.
 As we...
 Probably a lot of people are doing that.
 Maybe, as we wrap up our Facebook thoughts, before moving on to Pinterest, I wonder if
 I could do a public service announcement to people who post on Facebook.
 Please do.
 It's that whole concept that having a feeling is reasonable, but expressing it may not
 be.
 Yeah.
 It's not necessary that everyone knows about and treats all of our feelings tenderly all
 the time.
 Right.
 is that people often post things to Facebook in the hope that the people they're mad at
 will read rather than going to the person or the company that they're mad at and saying,
 hey, this is why I'm frustrated. So sometimes while scrolling through your Facebook feed,
 you accidentally get slimed by somebody who's super frustrated.
 Right.
 Yeah. So I don't know if that's just people need better tools or they've never been taught
 that that's, you know, that hey, the rest of the world can see that you're mad. Do you
 mean to both that deliberately?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Okay, that's I realized that I'm kind of guilty of doing what I'm complaining that are complaining about because on the podcast
 I'm telling people they shouldn't do this right and now you've trapped them. They have to listen to your your rant. I apologize
 Okay, all right other risk of sounding like my grandmother. I don't think I fully comprehend
 What Pinterest is or how it works? Oh, my man loves Pinterest. Okay, talk to me about Pinterest
 Well, so Pinterest is basically a site where you pin things. That's the name
 from other websites that interest you in whatever categories that you set up under your profile.
 So you do follow other people and people follow you and
 you might have, I mean depending on the person, some people
 have lots of stuff like fashion and you know whatever, I tend to have recipes in about 20 different categories and
 household items and
 Like a wish list of things you'd like to do to the house or buy for the house. Yes
 Decorating ideas or decorating ideas
 or things that like
 games to play with kids in the summer or you know like just
 stuff that
 inspires you to be creative and try something new so I've created lots of the
 Pinterest recipes which you have been the recipient of which way to go Pinterest because we had delicious chicken time to read tonight
 Yeah, so and it's great because it's not like you're finding anybody you can modify whatever you want
 But it's great inspiration
 Okay for anything that you want to do and then you know, I also pin stuff like I love that paint color or oh
 I you know, I'd love to make one of those one day or you know, but I'm I right in thinking that you can only
 pin
 Pre-existing content. Yes. Like you couldn't jump on Pinterest and say
 and start something original you have to find something on the internet that you can then yeah on a blogger website or something and then you would pin it kind of like.
 Book marking with pictures yes right.
 I'm not being sexist here but it sounds like things that chicks would love.
 I'm struggling to think of a purpose for me.
 Will you might like it for like technical gadgets or a cold Amazon wish list.
 Right. Well, think of it this way. It could be something where like some of the recipes,
 I pin them so that I'm going to go back and have a better look at them and see if I can
 switch the ingredients around to make it work for our dietary needs. And then I drop them
 if they're not going to work, stuff like that. So you might pin things that you're like,
 huh, I'm going to have a look at that later and that you might not remember to go have
 a look at.
 I tried to use Pinterest once, but my username that I like to use for everything wasn't
 available, which is just your name.
 Alan, at this point, I'd like to thank my parents for giving me a very unique spelling
 of Alan because so far I've very successfully obtained the username Alan on pretty much
 every site I use, which I can see why that would be an absolute necessity before you
 can possibly use a social media site.
 I can't detect whether the sarcasm and whether you agree with my principle.
 They're going to be a slight amount of sarcasm.
 -This week I was inspired by your love of Pinterest.
 -Yes.
 -I created an Allen and AJ account on Pinterest.
 -Oh, cool.
 -To try and post some of the stuff that we've got on our website.
 I'm not sure if I did it right.
 If any of you are on Pinterest, if you'd like to go and check Allen and AJ on Pinterest
 and see if I did it right and follow us and we'll follow you.
 Just to see if we're doing that right.
 -If it's empty, we didn't do it right.
 My initial things is the side types of people I guess would be on Pinterest like Shannon for example right when I went to Shannon's page.
 I was overwhelmed I was like there is so much stuff on here do you not get overwhelmed with it no.
 No because you know when you go to their actual page it's usually organized under certain categories and typically when I'm trolling Pinterest.
 I'm looking for specific things like i i rarely look at pinterest just cuz i'm waiting around doing nothing because i'm rarely waiting around doing nothing that makes sense right so usually i'm looking for lunch ideas for the kids that are gluten free or.
 You know paleo this or whatever so i tend to go through looking for what i'm looking for and so i guess i just skip.
 Am I right in thinking that Pinterest is the one social network that you use and you don't pray while using.
 That's correct.
 I'm okay.
 I don't think I've ever prayed while using a Pinterest.
 I feel better about myself right now.
 Other than I might have asked the Holy Spirit how to switch out a recipe.
 You're unbelievable.
 It's not the same thing though.
 Any other thoughts on social media before we finish?
 Yeah, I guess I was just thinking one of my favorite things about Instagram and Facebook, but I probably
 because I'm an Instagram more, I probably use it more for this, but just, it makes people that are
 far away seem closer. So for me, every day, I'm getting to see stuff from my friends in Australia,
 or Iceland, or Canada, or England, or you know, whatever. And again, it just makes me feel like
 I'm not completely missing their lives when we moved here. So I love that. I love that,
 even though we're not traveling anymore, there's little bits of connect and you can leave little
 comments. But I mean, typically, if I see something that I'm like, that's awesome. I'm going to
 text them and just say, Hey, I saw this on Instagram. So happy for you, you know, whatever. But it
 feels like I'm not completely missing everybody's life. Are you good? Yeah. So I love that part.
 Oh, you're so sweet. Do you want to listen to his question? Yeah, sure. This is from Scott.
 I said I did the finding father work a few years ago and it was great.
 Awesome.
 I love the soaking and journaling.
 To be honest that study really catapulted my journaling with the father.
 I did it in a group with two other guys and I still struggle with not acting like an orphan
 or orphaning out as you called it.
 On the chart of doom I would say I made progress but still the autopilot response tends to
 be orphan thinking not son or daughter thinking.
 Do you think going through the 12 week program again is a good idea and do you have a finding
 father part two or any other recommendations?
 Well, I don't have a part two yet.
 Do I think it would be great?
 Yeah, I think it would be great to go through a second time.
 I'm not joking.
 I've been through it more than two times and I wrote it.
 And I still get hit by stuff that I'm like, oh, I knew that once, but that truth, obviously,
 I've let go of because I'm not living that anymore.
 So I need to re-establish that truth in my life kind of thing.
 But don't be discouraged by orphaned moments.
 You probably have a lot less of them that you did originally.
 And we're all just heading in that direction of just letting revelation go deeper and
 let it bring us more healing.
 And so we live a little bit less to orphany, a little more like a son.
 I think that's very accurate.
 I mean, you've often said that you spent 10 years listening to the father-heart message
 over and over and over again.
 It took about that long before you got the message.
 took that long before I stopped hating it. Right. Yeah. And also, you know, our students go through
 finding father, go through a week with, you know, the father heart. And when we ask them to come back
 and be a small group leader, they'll hear that message for a second time. They'll inevitably say,
 Oh my gosh, I can't believe how much you added this year. And we're like, Nope, still the same
 stuff that we taught you last year. And what happens is the first time you go through something,
 you have no paradigm for any of it. Yeah. So it's all new. Yeah. When you go through a second time,
 you have a foundation and new stuff will start appearing to you.
 Sure. And stuff goes a lot deeper because you don't have the same walls up.
 And the other thing I want to encourage you with is Scott is you were saying that,
 you know, I am just noticing that my autopilot response is still like an orphan.
 Be encouraged by that because that's growth. Prior to you doing that course,
 you wouldn't even have known or recognized orphan-like tendencies.
 Right. So the fact that you're identifying means so you're going,
 "Okay Lord, there's an area of my heart that still needs a revelation that you love me.
 Would you help me with that?"
 And that's what you can do, Scott, is in that moment, whether you have a time right
 at that very second or whether you just sometime before you go to bed, say, "Hey Lord, I noticed
 this reaction that I had.
 Would you come and reveal to me what part of my heart doesn't realize how loved I am,
 what part of me is feeling insecure?
 Like what's missing?"
 Like Graham says, "What's missing from my experience of you?"
 You can do that in daily or in the moment,
 and that will also help sort of unhook
 some of those triggers of orphan behavior.
  </li><li>And if you're listening to us going,
 I don't have a clue what orphan-like behavior is
 or orphaning out or what the heck is the chart of doom
 and do I really want to know.
 All this is found in the book
 that Adrile wrote called Finding Father.
 If you haven't read Finding Father,
 we'd really unashamedly encourage you to read that
 because it's an excellent book
 in introducing the concept of the father's love.
 It is written as a 12-week study guide.
 You can go through it on your own,
 or you can go through it in small groups like Scott did.
 We're about to order our third run of books.
 We're almost sold out completely,
 which is really encouraging.
 But we also have electronic versions
 that you could download today.
 If you're a Kindle user,
 you will find Finding Father on the Kindle store.
 We also have a version for iPhones and iPads.
 And if you are an iPad user,
 we prepared a special multimedia enhanced edition
 of finding father, especially for the iPad.
 You can check this out on iBooks.
 We will put everything that we've talked about today in our show notes.
 You can get our show notes at alanaj.com/64.
 If you would like to follow us on any of the social media platforms we've mentioned before,
 we are available at Allen and AJ for both of us at Allen, ALYN for me, and at underscore
 AJ Jones for all of AJ's stuff.
 I know I think we should post in the show notes our first Instagram pictures
 You have a tree and I have a box of voice for a pretty tree. I wish I could say it was a pretty box of voice
 Alright, never mind. Let's not do that. We hope you have an amazing week
 Please get in contact with us over social media. We'd love to hear from you. Have an incredible week
 We'll see you next week. See you next week
