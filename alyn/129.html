<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Welcome back.<br/>
 Thank you so much to the land of the living and the upright.
 Right.<br/>
 You've had quite the week.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah, it was a pretty hectic week.<br/>
 Take us back in time.<br/>
 Well, I think you mentioned last week on the podcast that you had had to take me to emergency.
 I did. I was very surreptitious.<br/>
 Yes. So I was an agony and we went into the hospital and I had emergency surgery.
 Well, it turns out I had good reason to be an agony.
 And I should give some perspective. I've been married to you for what, nearly 11 years?
 Yes.<br/>
 And I've only seen you cry twice because of pain.
 Nearly 12 years, but whatever.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 Who's counting?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I've only seen you cry twice because of pain.
 Yes.<br/>
 Neither of which times include a childbirth.
 Right.<br/>
 The first time I saw you crying pain<br/>
 was when your L5 got jacked up, and you actually
 passed out because of the pain.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And when you--<br/>
 Repeatedly, I kept coming to you,<br/>
 and then passing out again from the pain.
 And you would have all the pain, and then you'd blackout.
 Yeah.<br/>
 This is the only other time I've seen you crying pain.
 Yes.<br/>
 And so we worked through all the drugs that were available in the house.
 I maxed out the max amount of Tylenol and Ibuprofen you could take in a day and still couldn't walk.
 And my narcotics.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And a Valium.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And so then I took you to the, well, then I called our emergency nurse and I said, oh, I've got some hydrocodone syrup.
 But they're like, sir, give your wife no more drug cocktail.
 Take her to medical professionals.<br/>
 So we take you to ER and they rush to in and kept you overnight.
 Yes.<br/>
 Now, do you want to talk about what was wrong?
 No.<br/>
 OK, we're just going to say that you were in pain.
 Too much trauma, too much.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Too much trauma.<br/>
 They kept you in and then you had surgery.
 Yes.<br/>
 How was surgery?<br/>
 Do you remember much of it?<br/>
 I don't remember thing.<br/>
 OK, well, lucky for you, I wrote down all the crazy stuff you said.
 You did.<br/>
 Wait a minute.<br/>
 We didn't talk about this.<br/>
 Nope.<br/>
 I've been holding on to this for a while.
 Oh, no, I'm terrified.<br/>
 You really did, right?<br/>
 This is amazing.<br/>
 When I was coming out of surgery.<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 When you were coming out of surgery,<br/>
 when they wheeled you up out of surgery,
 you were as high as a kite.<br/>
 Well, yes.<br/>
 And they put you out as a general.<br/>
 Yep, that's general anesthetic.<br/>
 And it took you good 12 hours to sober up.
 Oh, at least I still felt really wonky the next day.
 So for the whole afternoon,<br/>
 I think your surgery finished at 12.<br/>
 For the whole afternoon,<br/>
 I sat with you by your bedside.<br/>
 And there were three distinct personalities.
 Okay. Yeah.<br/>
 The three distinct personalities.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 That were apparent.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Was one that was completely delirium and confusion filled.
 Another where you were just passed out.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And the third one was what I would say would be just you.
 I'd recognize as my wife.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So see if you can spot which bits are with.
 Well, I kept going in and out too,<br/>
 because they would just give me more delotted.
 and then I would be.<br/>
 You would go in and out in the space of about 30 seconds.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So, for example, you would roll over very cutely and you would open your eyes and you'd look
 at me and go, "Am I in my room?"<br/>
 And I'd be like, "Yeah, honey, you're in your room."
 And then you would just be gone again.
 Yeah.<br/>
 There seemed to be a common theme though with furry animals.
 What?<br/>
 So one of my favorite things was you rolled over to me and you just looked at me dead
 in the eyes and you said, "If I'm in my room, I'm in my room."
 I ate bunnies, they'd be way too furry.
</p><ul>
  <li>Are you kidding me?
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>I was like, yeah, yeah, they probably would be baby,
 yeah, they would.
 And then about a minute later, you'd wake up,
 stone cold sobering and you'd say,
 babe, can you pass me on my phone?
 And literally, I would turn over to the bookshelf
 where your phone was, I'd pick up your phone
 and I'd turn back to give you your phone
 and you were out cold.
 So I would wake you up, you know, just shake you,
 like babe and you're like, "Huh? What?" And I'd be like, "Here's your phone."
 You're like, "Oh, I'm sorry. I was putting together a wreath." And I'd be like, "Okay. Here's your phone."
 And then you would just read them out to you. You would say, "Have you seen any stormtroopers
 in our room?" And I would say, "I haven't darling. Are you worried about them?" And you were like,
 Yeah, I saw two of them earlier.
 I was like, oh, okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 So here's another animal hair theme.
 Uh-huh.
 Not prompted.
 You just said to me, "We've never had cooked gopher."
 I did not.
 You did.
 I'm doing.
 This is a whole conversation.
 So we've never had cooked gopher.
 I think we'd eat too much hair.
 And that'd be like, "Yeah."
 And then you said, "I didn't eat it to me."
 You wouldn't know if spring was coming because we ate the guy that tells us.
 And you look so distressed.
 It's alright baby.
 Well no one springs coming.
 So again this is the whole afternoon you're just drifting in and out of consciousness.
 No you don't.
 You were concerned because you said is there a little Hispanic guy working at our house
 and I was like I don't think so and you're like Juan or something and I was like no.
 And then you said, "I think my nurse has all took a selfie before doing my surgery."
 So once I realized you're out of your tree, I just started asking you questions.
 Oh, no.
 Hey, that's taking advantage.
 Oh, believe me.
 I think my nurse has all took a selfie before doing surgery.
 So you ready for this?
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 I asked you a question.
 I said, "Do you have a favorite animal?"
 And you just answered immediately.
 He said, "Yep, a parakeet."
 (laughs)
 And I said, "Well, why is that?"
 And he said, "Because you can look at them and they're pretty."
 And when you're done looking at them, you can cook them.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I did that!
  </li><li>You totally did.
  </li><li>He says he's not making this up.
  </li><li>I'm not making anything up, that's just too good.
 And then I said to you, "How many children do we have?"
 And you said, "Three."
 And I said, "Which one's your favorite?"
 And you were like, "I love them all equally."
 I was like, "Oh, okay, good. We're having a lucid moment."
 So I took advantage of that and asked you,
 "What's your favorite thing being about married to me?"
 And the lucid moment passed because you answered chicken.
 You can't go wrong with chicken.
 And then, you know, you would also be interspersed with you,
 like, "What's wrong?"
 Maybe you're like, "Who are these guys?"
 And I'd be like, "Which guys?"
 And you're like, "The guys with the big truck."
 And then you just pass out again.
 But my favorite line was you rolled over and you whispered to me,
 we have to tell Sarah, babe, we're sneaking out so we can go dancing.
 And that was it.
 Okay.
 I've been holding on to those.
 You've done really well.
 I know.
 I've spent like a week in a day.
 I know.
 I've been so desperate to tell you about those things, but I thought I wanted
 to do a reaction to be genuine on air.
 So your hospital visit.
 So you were kept in hospital for three days.
 Yeah.
 Our friends, family, neighbors kept us well fed.
 Yep.
 And then you took the weekend to recover and then you were back up.
 Yep.
 Back up and running.
 Yep.
 So quick recap of this week, then.
 Yes.
 Monday and Tuesday, you lounged around like you're on vacation or something.
 Right.
 I know lazy, just lazy.
 You were on.
 What kind of drugs were you on?
 Delighted.
 You were on the hospital.
 That is that is a decent drug.
 I have to tell you.
 It is a heavy duty.
 It works fast.
 They would give it to me and I would honestly stay within about 10 seconds.
 I was like, OK, OK, I can cope with the pain now, but they wouldn't let you out until
 you're off the lot.
 What did they give you to come home?
 Demerol Demerol.
 That's a bit of a lightweight, but you still were.
 You were wrong.
 It's not a lightweight compared to the lot.
 Compared to the lot.
 Yeah.
 But the Demerol was making me spin as well.
 So I stopped taking that Saturday.
 So while you were launching around in bed.
 Yeah.
 I'm just enjoying life.
 We had Steve long at the school.
 Well, you guys heard Steve long on the podcast last week.
 He was amazing.
 And at the school, he's teaching on physical healing with a great time.
 Lots of people go to heal.
 So bomb, but I didn't get to see him.
 I know because you just love anybody from Canada and from home.
 Yeah, especially Steve.
 It's so fun when we have him down.
 So you didn't get to see him.
 No.
 And then I was in second, you're teaching on brain science, which we're going to talk
 about a tiny little bit of that later.
 All right.
 But you bounce back.
  </li><li>Did you wanna talk about how Instagram outed you?
 While you were teaching on brain science?
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, go on, you tell the story.
  </li><li>Okay, so I spent basically not a week in the hospital,
 but I was gone for three days,
 was, you know, arrived home, it was my birthday,
 we had birthday dinner, two days later,
 I'm in the hospital for another three days,
 so I was gone for a bit.
 and Alan's teaching on brain science
 and whoever is managing the school feed for us
 took like a little clip of Steve preaching
 and then you preaching and posted it
 for the, you know, for people that are following the school feed.
  </li><li>Yeah, these are brilliant people
 who are handling our social media account.
  </li><li>Yeah, and so, but the clip that they posted
 was you confessing to having gained seven pounds
 because you hadn't eaten well the week that I was away.
  </li><li>Well, for context, I was teaching on the brain,
 things that hurt your brain and its lack of sleep, poor diet and excess weight.
 Yes.
 And stress.
 So I was like, hey, this week, you know, age has been in the hospital.
 My sleep has been all over the place because just the crazy schedule we've been keeping,
 like I took you in a hospital at midnight, I think I'm home till 2.30, I got up at 6.30
 to get the kids, you know, all that sort of stuff.
 So then you're tired when you're tired, you eat more and so when you're stressed, you
 eat poorly.
 So I was talking about that.
 For example, this week, exceptional stress,
 and I've gone up seven pounds.
 And I'm thinking, I'm totally safe.
 I'm just telling the class,
 Aji's never gonna hear about this.
 And that's the flipping clip they use on social media.
 So you're like, what?
  </li><li>So I'm in the bath or something,
 and I'm just catching up on Instagram.
 And I see this clip go by, and I was like,
 "Hey, so baby, you gained seven pounds this week?"
 And you're all like, "Who told you that?
 "Was it Shannon?
 "Who blah, blah."
 And then I came out and played the clip.
 I just thought it was so funny.
 Yeah, so thanks Instagram for editing me.
 Yeah, thank you Instagram.
 And then by Wednesday, we were off work.
 We got Wednesday, 30, Friday off work for Thanksgiving.
 Yeah.
 Thanksgiving for non-North American listeners
 is basically, at least in America,
 is a precursor to Christmas, it feels like.
 Yeah, it's like the test drive for Christmas or something.
 It's great, I highly enjoy it.
 No presents, which kind of sucks, but lots of food,
 which is, yeah, awesome.
 Yeah, and lots of family time.
 It was basically four days at home with the kids just watching movies and cuddling and
 playing and eating food.
 It was super fun.
 I wanted to cancel Thanksgiving because I just wanted to collapse.
 Your point was we had to miss my birthday because as a hospital, I'm not missing Thanksgiving.
 We ended up canceling my birthday party because I was dragged out of my tree by the time I
 got home.
 It wasn't like we could have it.
 It's not realistic that we're actually going to be able to figure it out.
 I was like, "All right, I'm already not getting a birthday party.
 I don't want to miss Thanksgiving."
 Because you're a high quality time person.
 Yeah.
 So we had some people over for Thanksgiving dinner.
 Yeah.
 You didn't do turkey.
 Well, no, I mean, I don't love turkey.
 It's okay, but it's kind of a dry meat.
 Like I'd rather have chicken than turkey.
 And which explains why we had salmon?
 Well, we had salmon because you asked for salmon.
 You love my stuffed salmon.
 Just a minute.
 I did.
 predicted. And so we had invited a couple people over for Thanksgiving that didn't have
 family local. And they all like salmon too. So I made a stuffed salmon.
 And it was amazing. Which is basically food and more food.
 The twice baked potatoes.
 So good.
 Yes. And the gravy. I had to make gravy.
 Yes.
 Obviously.
 The gravy was delicious.
 And then Friday and Saturday was all outdoor work. I tried my hand to pressure washing.
 You did a great job.
 Oh, I don't know about that.
 The first day I was all eager, I was like, man, I'm going to brush, wash this deck.
 It's going to be awesome.
 And then I was out there for a couple hours.
 I was like, this takes forever.
 And so I quit.
 Yeah.
 And then came inside and watched YouTube videos and how I was doing it wrong.
 Oh, dear.
 And then the next day tackled it and it went much faster.
 Yeah.
 But you just get soaking wet.
 You were definitely soaking wet and it was around freezing.
 I mean, it was cold outside.
 My man, Stila, I don't care about the elements.
 Yeah.
 Pro athlete.
 Sure.
 Do you want to talk about the Christmas decoration gag that you had
 everybody on Instagram and trauma?
 So the subdivision that we live in, um, you know, our floor plan
 can be done in a number of different ways, but there's a couple of houses
 near us that look almost exactly the same as ours.
 You mean from the exterior?
 From the exterior.
 Yeah.
 And so I was out, uh, driving and I, well, I mean, I shouldn't say I saw it.
 I can see it from our backyard.
 It's so bright.
 And so I went over to have a look at it
 and it looks like our house.
 Like it's red brick.
 It looks the same.
  </li><li>And I will put a link in the show notes
 so you can see this video for yourself.
 Bless these people that have bought basically
 every inflatable lit up Christmas decoration
 and covered their lawn with it.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And do you know what I discovered today?
  </li><li>At what?
  </li><li>When we drove by, I took the kids by it during the day.
 It actually does have a radio station
 that you can tune into and watch all the different flashing things.
 Synchronized lights for the music that's playing.
 Yes.
 So yeah, these guys, I don't know how much money they've spent.
 Oh, got to be thousands.
 Decked out their whole house.
 It's all illuminated.
 The trees are all illuminated.
 There's candy cane.
 There's reindeers.
 There's Santa.
 There's presents.
 There's Christmas trees.
 All the windows.
 Nice.
 It's just an enormous amount.
 Conveniently enough, it looks exactly like our house.
 Yeah.
 So I took a video of it and then I posted something like,
 the kids asked us to go all out this year, dot, dot, dot,
 and posted it and because it looks like our house
 and it's on a hill like our house
 and it's red brick like our house,
 basically with some cropping, we made it look like
 it's our house.
 And so people are the comments for history.
  </li><li>Very polite in expressing their shock and awe.
  </li><li>That we had done this.
  </li><li>And then you very kindly put them out on the misery
 about 24 hours later.
  </li><li>And then I had people that knew us
 probably a little better that were texting us like,
 that's not actually your house, is it?
 Like it looks like your house,
 but you wouldn't do that would you?
 And whatever.
 So it was very funny.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 All right, our main topic for this week
 comes from teaching the sweetcomb brain science.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
  </li><li>And in our week on brain science,
 in year two of the school supernatural life,
 we look at five of the major brain systems,
 the first of which is the limbic system.
 So the limbic system in your brain helps set the emotional tone of your mind.
 Okay.
 It regulates your motivation, it promotes your bonding, controls your appetite and
 sleep cycles, which is why I was talking about putting on seven pounds.
 Right.
 And, and so we were talking about the problems with your limbic system when
 it's over, underactive and things to help.
 One of the things that we found that actually helps, this is from research
 with the limbic system is practicing gratitude
 or appreciation exercises.
  </li><li>Oh good.
  </li><li>When you find something you're genuinely appreciative of
 and you express that as gratitude,
 you get in touch with how did my body feel
 that time that something amazing happened to me?
 You know, what was my memory?
 When you get in touch with that memory,
 you bring a calming sensation to your body.
 Conversely, negative thought patterns
 change the brain in a negative way.
 When we practice gratitude,
 it literally helps us have a brain to be grateful for.
 So we looked at some brain scans of a patient
 who was in a negative swirl
 and looked at what parents of their brain lit up.
 And then we looked at when that patient
 was doing gratitude exercises,
 actually expressing appreciation and being grateful.
 And the changes in brain activity were just absolutely radical.
 So negative thought patterns changed the brain
 in a negative way, being grateful, being positive
 as a positive effect on your brain.
 Then I got a church this morning and Dr. Artie Kendall is with us and he's preaching on
 tithing actually. But one of the lines he said is the doctrine of sanctification is the doctrine
 of gratitude. All the things you do in the Christian life, none of them get you saved.
 The only thing gets you saved is your faith in Jesus Christ. But all these other things,
 praying, fasting, tithing, giving, spiritual disciplines are just a way of you.
 Overflowing and thankfulness towards the Lord.
 Yeah, it's a way of you showing gratitude to the Lord. And I love that. I love that line.
 the doctrine of sanctification is the doctrine of gratitude.
 So being grateful, we found literally changes everything in your immediate
 environment.
 Right.
 So my question to you, Mrs.
 AJ Jones, is what are you grateful for?
 Wow.
 I'm grateful for a lot.
 How did I do?
 I have like only a certain amount of things, or can I just start rhyming things off?
 You're going to rhyme?
 This is going to be awesome.
 Well, it is Thanksgiving.
 And one of the things that your traditions do,
 Thanksgiving is going on the table and say,
 what are you thankful for?
 Which we didn't do.
 So here we are on the podcast.
 What are you thankful for?
  </li><li>I'm thankful for you.
  </li><li>Yeah, you are, baby.
  </li><li>I am.
  </li><li>Watch me flex.
  </li><li>I think, wow.
  </li><li>There we go.
  </li><li>Look at that.
  </li><li>It's your little treat.
  </li><li>Thanks babe.
 Now I'm distracted though.
 So I don't know if I can really, you know,
 formulate a thought.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>Stay on target.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, I'm thankful for you.
 I'm thankful for our marriage.
 I'm thankful that, you know, we were,
 we went on a date the other night
 And I think it's--
 We found a great Vietnamese restaurant.
 We did.
 I'm thankful for that place too.
 I think you are so super sweet the way
 you take our relational temperature all the time.
 So I just remember walking in and you're like, babe,
 I love being married.
 I love being married to you.
 Are we good?
 And I just-- I love that you don't take anything for granted.
 and you actually effort this.
 We're not just, hey, you're stuck with me for life,
 but we are actually intentionally loving each other.
  </li><li>Well, I think it's the line that you taught me
 that we don't stay married because we're in love.
 We stay in love because we're married.
  </li><li>Yeah, I learned that at YWAM
 and I didn't understand it at the time.
  </li><li>Yeah, but it's such a great line.
 And I think because we've learned
 that when our connection is really, really strong,
 things are great.
 And when our connection is really, really bad,
 things are terrible.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then we've also learned that your connection
 isn't accidentally great.
 It requires focus, energy, effort and money.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>We throw resources towards our connection.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And your connection is primarily quality time and gifts.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 (laughs)
 The expensive ones, basically.
 Sorry about that.
 a minus quality touch in physical time.
 Yes.
 Very funny.
 Muh-huh.
 And words of affirmation.
 Yeah.
 Just lie on top of me and tell me I'm amazing.
 And I'm happy.
 We'll do that later.
 Yes.
 I know I'm grateful for.
 Just don't flex again.
 But what's something you're thankful for?
 Are we just going to go back and forth?
 Yeah, we can.
 OK.
 I don't want to be super spiritual.
 Yeah.
 But I was thinking this morning worship, like the songs you were
 and worship were amazing.
 And I'm just in touch with the truth of our salvation.
 I'm not trying to be a pastor and be all super spiritual,
 but Lord, I so love being saved.
 I so love having a great connection with you.
 You know, back to that whole thing of connectivity.
 I just love the connection I have with the Lord
 and the Lord has with me.
 I'm like, I feel like the wealthiest man in the world.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 and the Holy Spirit comes so close.
 And when the Father just begins to speak to me
 and I can hear Him, I am so grateful for my salvation.
 I'm so grateful for peace with God.
 I'm so grateful for being made right.
 I just love having my sin removed from me.
 That's such an amazing thing.
 I'm very, very grateful for that.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So I realize that sounds super spiritual
 and I'm not trying to say by saying that
 anything else is less because all good gifts come from God.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, whether it's, I'm sure I'm going to talk about some material items later because I love material items, but I wanted to throw salvation in there.
 I'm super thankful for three healthy kids.
 Oh my gosh, yes.
 And how cute and entertaining they are.
 I'm loving every stage that they're individually in.
 I was looking at Abigail when we were having family movie night last night and just thinking,
 "Wow, she's going to be 10 in a few months."
 It's wild.
 It is wild.
 She's so amazing with Tia and with MJ.
 She's helpful and she's sweet and she cares about everybody around her.
 If she notices somebody's hurting, she wants to help them.
 just I just love watching her grow up and it feels like it's happening super fast.
 And then there's Tia who's just she, you know, brown eyed wonder child.
 She is. She just says what she thinks and she has virtually no filter and she, you know,
 she loves you. She full on loves you. And you know, she's just, she's so funny.
 she's just so funny and then mj is in this stage where i remember both the girls going through it where they're
 vocabulary is just you know amazing the words that they come up with and you know and he's just very.
 Um he's wants to be with us every second doesn't he wants to play wants to be in your orbit he wants to talk to you about everything what's my orbit.
 Orbit oh my orbit yeah absolutely wants to be in the I don't think he wants to be in your orbit
 So what are you grateful for well, this is probably a really easy one. I'm so grateful for our home me too
 We're talking about this week not just the physical house and the blessing that is
 But the neighbors that we have
 We have amazing neighbors and we're not just saying that because some of them listen to the podcast right we just totally
 Foul out of the awesome neighbor tree and hit every branch on the way down for sure. I I think what's fun is
 you know the
 The last place that we lived we really got to know the neighbors across the road, but that's about it like we didn't really
 form relationships with
 anybody else in the neighborhood and everybody was pretty busy and kept to themselves and stuff and and here it's so lovely having the
 You know, Wes and Deirdre next door and then you know down from them Lauren and Britt and then Mike and came across the way like we're getting to
 Form friendships and get to know the people around us and stuff and and it's there's such amazing families
 So it's amazing. I love it. I'm super thankful and I our house to babe like I think
 Pretty much every day I walk out and I think
 Wow God
 It was especially nice hosting people.
 Yeah.
 I love having people over.
 Like I love when we have the small group leaders over.
 I love when we had people over Thanksgiving.
 I love that we're going to have people over Christmas.
 Yeah.
 I love the next week we're having friends to stay.
 Yeah.
 All of that's fun.
 I love that.
 So we're super grateful for that.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Last one for you.
 All right.
 If it's my last one, I would say Grace Center.
 I'm I'm thankful for our jobs and who we get to work with and the people we get to pour into.
 and the presence of God at our church and the worship and everything.
 I just don't want to be anywhere else. I love it here.
 And our leaders are amazing.
 Jeff and Becky, fantastic.
 God broke them all to make a name, but that's for sure.
 Yeah.
 The whole team is really amazing.
 Yeah. Our staff are phenomenal.
 Yeah.
 It's just honestly, at times, I think, is this my life?
 Really? This is my life.
 Right. Seriously.
 Do you have one more? I can't remember where we're at.
 You have one more?
 I would I've just been contemplating the future.
 Okay.
 And I don't know what the future holds.
 I have this incredible sense of hope and optimism that just keeps me buoyant about what's coming.
 And I'm grateful for that because I remember days when I wanted to end my life.
 I remember days when I couldn't see past the end of the darkness of today.
 Yeah.
 I remember despair and depression.
 And now all I see is excitement about what God's doing and
 And we're all going. Yeah, I love that. Yeah. All right. Some listeners questions. Oh, okay.
 Let's run us from Paul. Okay. I nearly asked Steve Long this question. I should have done,
 but we ran out of time. Paul's question is recreational marijuana is becoming legal in some
 states. Is there a scriptural reason for a Christian not to try this substance in moderation as one
 word with alcohol? Well, I don't think, so I'll say this. I have never smoked marijuana, but I have
 plenty of family that have. And I've seen the effects of clothes and personal. And I don't think
 it's the same thing. As you know, have, for example, having a glass of wine or half a glass of wine
 and smoking marijuana, they're not really the same thing and they don't have the same
 effect. I don't think you can moderately smoke marijuana. I mean, I'm not, again, I'm not an
 expert, but I think it opens you up. It would be equivalent to being drunk. I think it opens
 you up to a whole bunch of stuff that's just not a great idea.
 I also think about one of my favorite &acirc;€“ this is going to sound terrible. This is one of my
 favorite conversations I ever had with a young man a number of years ago.
 Basically, he called me and he said, "Ellen, I'm in the psych ward." And I was like,
 "Oh, I had to end up in the psych ward."
 And he's like, "Well, when I was some friends,
 "I started drinking and I was with a wrong group of people
 "and I ended up getting high.
 "And I got so convicted by the Holy Spirit
 "that what I was doing was wrong.
 "I drove over to my parents' house
 "to just ask them to pray for me."
 And he said, "When I got over to my parents' house,
 "I said hello to them, I said, I was gonna have a nap.
 "And that's the last thing I remember.
 "I remember going for a nap
 "and now I've woken up 48 hours later
 "and I'm in the psych ward."
 And I was like, "Okay, so what happened
 between you lying down and 48 hours later, he said, "Well, all I can go on is what my
 family have told me and what the police have told me." And I was like, "Okay." He said,
 "Well, basically I got up and was so violent and so aggressive that my parents had to call
 the police. And when the police came, it took three policemen to pin me down and I was effing
 and blinding and yelling at them. And the police said, "We're not going to press charges
 against your son because we've seen this before and we know it's not your son." And
 And he said, and so then they put me in the psych ward and do you know what?
 And so he was asking me spiritually, you know what happened because as most people know,
 recreational marijuana is not going to produce those side effects.
 So I said to him, oh, it's a past right now, exactly what's happened.
 And he said, well, what's happened?
 I said, oh, you were seriously demonized.
 And he was like, wait, what now?
 And I said, oh, yeah, like first Peter five eight says, be sober and alert.
 adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring line seeking someone to devour. I said, when
 we're not sober, when we choose to get drunk or we choose to get high, we are literally
 outsourcing our spirit, our soul, our mind, will and emotions to our adversary that the
 devil is prowling around like a roaring line, looking for someone to devour. The only people
 people he can devour are those who are not sober. So going back to you, I'm not an
 expert on marijuana at all, having never smoked any of the stuff. I don't know if there's
 a gradiation of it, but I don't think you want to have a gradiation of losing control.
 There are several instructions in the New Testament, mostly Paul where he's talking
 about, let us be alert and sober, be sober in all things, keep a sober spirit, have sound
 judgment and a sober spirit for the purpose of prayer. It's very hard to obey those verses
 and be smoking weed. It's a great question because previously when people would ask me,
 "Hey, what do you think about smoking weed?" I'd be like, "Well, it's a legal substance,
 so I think your answer is right there." But now that it's becoming legalized, I'm like...
 But you know, and then there's also that... I mean, I totally agree with what you're saying.
 an open door and it's a horrible idea, I think. In my opinion, but I also think there's lots
 of stuff that is legal in terms of government wise that is not legal, if you will, in quotation
 marks, in terms of Scripture wise. What are you going to live by?
 Right.
 So, yeah.
 Is there a scripture or reason for a Christian not to try the substance? Well, I've just
 given you a few verses off the top of my head there about it's very hard to be sober.
 Hi. And hi at the same time. So pick one and I'll probably lean with what the scripture says on that one. Sorry, I'm not trying to be smart.
 Alec with that. But I would, I would pass early suggest that nobody smokes marijuana. Yeah.
 All right, baby, let's wrap this thing up. So we've been thinking about gratitude, our encouragement to you guys is what are you thankful for?
 Spend some time just chewing over what you're thankful for and then practice being grateful because I found it
 gratitude looks fantastic on the outside. Like it's a great internal posture, but actually
 your gratitude helps change your environment when you spread it. So go find someone that
 you're grateful for and share your gratitude, express to them in word or action, let them
 know why you're grateful for them, and it will absolutely change the atmosphere around
 you.
 Yeah, absolutely. It's, I mean, encouragement is an amazing thing, isn't it? We'd also
 be grateful for something. We'd be grateful if you would leave us a review on iTunes.
 We read all of them, no matter what country they come in from, but we love the feedback
 and leaving a review on iTunes is great because it sort of gets the podcast seen by people
 that may be searching for answers, you know, and it'll shoot ours into their line of vision.
 Well, you know what it's like when you're trying to decide which battery-operated toy
 you're going to get from Amazon at this time of the year.
 You tend to read the reviews, and if people are leaving glowing reviews, you're more likely
 to try something you've never tried before.
 Right.
 Same with podcasts.
