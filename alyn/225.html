<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 How's my back?<br/>
 Smooth, like a baby's bottom.<br/>
 I had this disturbing experience last week.
 I don't know which disturbing experience are we talking about?
 Well, AJ told me I had a pelt on my back.
 It's a soft pelt.<br/>
 And not being somebody who can see his back,
 like you don't need to know this,<br/>
 but I'm not a very hairy person.<br/>
 Like I don't have a hairy chest or,<br/>
 it's one of my great disappointments.<br/>
 I'm 45 year old.
</p><ul>
  <li>Oh, I'm not disappointed at all.
  </li><li>Oh no, I always wanted a hairy chest.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm so thankful.
  </li><li>So I don't really have a hairy chest.
 And like my arms are not particularly hairy,
 but apparently that's because all my body hair went
 to my back, which by the way--
  </li><li>That's an overstatement.
 Unfortunately I've seen many men with much hairier backs.
 But apparently none of them have a soft pelt.
  </li><li>No, yours is like really fine,
 just a fine frosting of hair everywhere.
  </li><li>My grandfather on my mother's side was completely bald,
 but had a hairy back.
 And I remember being a kid, probably MJ's age,
 just being fascinated at this, like this man's hairy back.
 So apparently I've reaped his hairy back.
 Anyway, you spent this afternoon waxing my back.
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>By the way, this is the podcast gold that you signed up for.
 (laughing)
 And it wasn't you squeaked a cup of it.
 Well, I did.
 The top part and the bottom part of the back is really sensitive.
 They're kind of like the main part of the back.
 You were like the top part and the bottom part and the sides.
 No, it's just like there's no hair in the middle.
 I didn't wax the middle of your back.
 Anyway, my hair cut, my quarantine haircut.
 The second one of the quarantine is from AJ Spa.
 Thank you.
 Now she's opened up to back waxing.
 I don't know that I've opened up to that.
 I've done it once. I think I'm good now. You got bored halfway through. Which is totally
 anything to do. Just getting the shower and I'll shave you. Yeah, marriage is so glamorous.
 It's so great. Do you remember when I had a frozen shoulder for a year and a half and
 you had to shower me? You didn't have to wash my hair because I couldn't lift my arm.
 I remember you not being able to lift your arm. I don't remember that in great detail.
  </li><li>Thanks a lot. (laughs)
  </li><li>Don't feel bad.
 We had friends who lived with us for a while
 and a couple of years after that,
 they came over to our house where I haven't dinner
 and they were talking about,
 they were reminiscing about when they lived with us
 and I was like, "You lived with us?"
 And they were like, "Yeah."
 And I thought they were joking.
 So I was like, "I had no memory that they lived with us."
 And then eventually it clawed back.
  </li><li>What's it like in your brain?
 Carol called yesterday and she was like,
 Hey, do you remember this obscure fact about this person?
 And I was like, no, I really don't.
 Just like, good to check with Alan.
 I was like, there's no way, Carol, that Alan stored that in his mind palace.
 Yeah, the stuff I keep in my mind on hand and the stuff that you think I need
 to keep in my mind on hand, two different things.
 Well, yes, I have some concerns about the palace as it stands.
 Hope you guys had a great week.
 Has our sucked.
 Is that is that the professional term?
 Yeah, it was it was a rough week.
 It's funny.
 There's nothing funny about this week, but it is funny doing all of this stuff on
 feelings and then having a week where your feelings are like in a corner tapping
 out going, please have mercy.
 Yeah.
 So it's been a rough week.
 I don't know what it's been like for you.
 We pray it's been really, really good.
 We pray if it's been a rough week, you'll find some help in what we're going to talk
 about today and we pray that the rest of your week is going to be better.
 There's like some sort of weird arctic polar wind or something that's coming.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 It's going to be like freezing tonight or something.
 That type of thing never makes it into my mind palace.
 No, a lot of stuff doesn't make it to your mouth.
 But Apple did release a new 13 inch MacBook Pro.
 Yeah, that somehow made it into my mind house.
 Even though I don't need one.
 Well, this week we're going to be talking about the feeling of anger.
 Ah, the feeling that all of us good little Christians were told we're not allowed to have.
 Yeah, if you were raised in a nice Christian home, you're probably not allowed to be angry.
 Again, we're talking about like your families of origin, how fluent were they with their feelings,
 or well, in your house, it was slightly different.
 Yes, I lived in the house where anger reigns supreme or rage, really.
 Right. What did that look like?
 Uh, wow. It could look like flying utensils, knives, uh, anything.
 Please happen to be called. Please happen to be called people being choked. Yes. Yeah. Or you could live in a more appropriate home
 Where like all of that rage just simmered underneath the surface and it was present and nobody talked about it
 But it was there and it was you know if you got too close you were
 Right, you never knew when the explosion would come the sad thing about no matter what kind of background we came from if we were taught
 out of feeling our anger, that's really a tragedy because
 Probably anger is the most important feeling that we as humans need to feel
 Why the reason for that is going to become apparent as we unpack it
 But but largely anger is the first step that we take into full life because our healthy anger shows that we actually have
 Something more than just a pulse. Okay. We're not just physiologically alive
 But we're emotionally alive and there's a passion burning in us
 which I'm going to unpack right now because probably we've confused some of you,
 especially if you grew up in backgrounds like AJ's or in backgrounds like mine,
 where we're taught not to be angry, you're probably thinking of how on earth can anger be something good.
 Well, the first thing I want to clarify is what AJ was talking about is rage is not anger.
 So that big scary display of like rage, you know,
 loud voices, physical, you know, threats of violence, that's not actually anger.
 That's that's rage, which is actually impaired fear when we talk about fear.
 Uh, I think next week we're going to be talking about fear.
 None of that is anger.
 That's just fear refusing to be felt on display.
 It's somebody's attempt who's very scared to get really, really big to get
 other people to back away from that.
 It works.
 So that's not anger though.
 Yeah.
 No, it's not anger.
 Not what you're talking about.
 Not the kind of anger that I'm talking about.
 For sure.
 The anger that we're talking about today could probably be better described as
 yearning or longing or wishing or hunger or desiring. Yeah. That kind of like I am angry for,
 I'm reaching out for something rather than what we've been taught to believe is anger, which as
 you talked about is rage. Yes. So when you were talking about anger being important for us in
 terms of feeling alive, what do you mean by that? Right. So anger is this fuel that gives us passion
 for something. Right, okay. As I was learning this new language and you would say, oh, I'm angry
 for something. I'm like, that doesn't, that doesn't compute for me because anger is a scary thing.
 But what you're actually saying is I am passionate for X. I'm either passionate for something to change
 or. Yeah, anger shows us what we care about. Right. Anger is the thing that makes us come alive
 for a yearning to be fulfilled. Okay. So basically anger tells us that something matters.
 Exactly. Anger is what gets you to move out with your comfort zone, to go get the thing that's
 important to you, or to fight for the thing that matters. Anger is this beautiful, beautiful gift.
 Again, a lot of what anger is has been robbed from us. It shouldn't come as a surprise.
 When we define anger as this longing for something, this yearning for something,
 I like to think about it or the way that we were taught about at Sage Hill is think about what
 are you angry for, not who are you angry at. When we think about that, it comes as no surprise that
 the gift inside of feeling our anger is. Passion. Exactly. Right. So sitting with our anger actually
 leads us to know what we are passionate about, what we will fight for, what is important to us,
 what matters. Yeah. So good. This is totally dating me. Oh, I thought I was dating you. No,
 No, this is very good.
 This totally didn't mean a bit live aid, 1985, I think.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So major event, a global event,
 like all these rock stars and pop stars from around the world
 putting on a huge concert, one in Wembley,
 one in, I think, Philadelphia in the States,
 raising money for Ethiopia, for the famine that was happening.
 What, that was newsworthy enough,
 but what was really newsworthy for me
 is a little boy in Great Britain.
 I was 11 at the time,
 is Bob Gildoff drops the F word on BBC Live TV.
  </li><li>I don't know who that is, but okay.
  </li><li>Okay, it's Bob Gildoff is the person
 who masterminded the whole thing.
 He was the lead singer of the boomtown rats,
 but he's on TV.
  </li><li>They are, okay.
  </li><li>This is totally taken.
  </li><li>I'll just behave shocked.
 You're kidding, he did?
  </li><li>He's on British TV.
 I've got the video.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But what you see is his anger on display.
 Basically, he's banging the table
 and he's saying, "Give us your money."
 And he just says, "Give us your effing money."
 And of course, everybody was kind of shocked,
 but at the same time,
 everybody was like, we understand why you're angry.
 You're trying to save millions of people from dying.
  </li><li>You're angry for something,
 your anger has changed.
  </li><li>And it's on display, his passion was fully on display.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So not that I'm saying everybody just gets to go around
 running their mouth off and just saying,
 oh no, I listened to Alan A.J's podcast
 and they called Bob Galdov and so that it's okay.
 But that point was that none of Bob's anger was scary.
 Bob's anger moved a nation to do something.
 Right. Gotcha.
 So, the chip in his book and the chapter on anger, he says this.
 Anger is the feeling that clarifies who we are and who we are not.
 By making us known, anger pushes us to be truthful and therefore trustworthy.
 Our ability to show our true identity makes us available for relationship.
 In fact, anger reaches out for it.
 And when we reach out in truth and the reaching is met by another in truth, we build authentic
 relationships.
 Isn't that beautiful?
 Yeah, it's amazing.
 Yeah.
 So, Angers are real gift in relationships because angry people refuse to hide.
 So if you think about some of our friends who are angry in this sense, like when I think
 about Krista Wendell, like she is angry for things, like when you're around Krista, you
 know what she is living for.
 There's no shadow of a doubt.
 But I think about Shannon Macleard.
 Shannon is an angry person.
 Again, if you've only thought about anger is this big scary thing.
 I'm not saying Shannon scary.
 Yeah.
 Although Shannon probably is scary to some people who don't want to be fully alive,
 but Shannon's passion for righteousness, for things to be other than they are,
 for people to be free.
 When you get around Shannon, you get in touch with her anger.
 But I'll be honest with you.
 Again, coming from my background, even though I've been using this language now
 for nearly two years, I still have to translate anger for passion every time you say it.
 Really? Every time you say, "Yeah, Shannon's an angry person." I think, no, she isn't.
 Oh, he's talking about passionate. Yes, she is. She's passionate.
 Like, I literally do that every time you say it because that's not the word I use for that.
 Yeah, no, that makes sense. But you see, but seeing the Shannon is passionate,
 Shannon is passionate, but for me, like anger contains so much more than just passion.
 It's not just a passion for, but it's a yearning.
 It's like like Shannon's anger moves her to see the thing that she's passionate
 about come to fruition.
 I get it.
 I'm just saying I still have to do the entire translation every time you use the word.
 I'm totally with you.
 Totally with you.
 And I have to be careful because I use that word a lot.
 Like I'm angry to know this and angry for this.
 But I think what I love about anger is I wouldn't say I'm a terribly passive person
 In relationships, I would say I'm a fairly confrontational person and I wouldn't say you're a passive person at all.
 But in the areas where I have been passive, my anger for truth, my anger for connection is what drives my confrontation.
 So if you're in relationship with me, you know that I will get my needs met by finding out what it is I need.
 So if I feel disconnected from you, if I feel disconnected from my friends, I'm going to pick up the phone and my passion to be connected is what it's going to prompt that phone call.
 more than the fear that, oh, this could get messier, could make things worse.
 Right.
 That's not a thought for me because this anger to be connected, the anger for truth to be known,
 anger for the storyteller that I have in my head to be silenced pushes me forward in relationships.
 Yeah.
 I'm angry right now.
 I can feel all my passion.
 I can feel it too.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 When I think about my angry friends, they're like gift to me because I don't need to guess what
 they're thinking. Like their passion for life is on display. I know who they are.
 I know where they're going and there's something joyful about that.
 Yeah.
 And conversely, when I'm around people who are not in touch with their anger for living,
 I'm so curious to know what makes them tick.
 Like I just think about lunch that we had a couple of months ago.
 Yeah.
 And I know they listened to our podcast and I'm not going to say your name just out of
 honor for you, but you probably know who you are.
 We were having lunch at Burger App and I'm sat with this beautiful couple who are beginning
 to get in touch with their passion, but I'm also noticing that years and years and years
 of not being allowed to be passionate because of their culture. And I just want to chip away
 that thing like, no, what makes you come alive? Not what should you do? Not what I've been told
 to do? What is the Lord put on your heart? Or actually what's in your heart that's
 learning to come out? What do you want to do with that person? And that's one of the gifts of
 healthy anger. Can I just tell you in fairness, we've had that discussion with a number of people.
 So I wouldn't actually be able to identify what couple it is that you think you're talking about because I'm like we've had that
 Probably one of our gift our community is being angry enough to care to dig out to make not make people
 But kind of like to salt the holt so that people are hungry to drink
 And find their anger. Yes. I mean at least I hope that's one of our gifts
 If it isn't we're just annoying people over there. Yeah, so sorry about that at least you got a free lunch over it
 So there's that fine. Yeah, so that's the gift if we feel our anger then the gift of it is that we actually move towards passion
 Yeah, however if we refuse to feel it then actually the impairment is depression the crazy thing about
 That dynamically you just explained is the depression comes about from us literally trying to depress our feelings
 Like so it starts with anger like I don't want to be alive about this thing for whatever reason because you'll never come to pass
 I don't have enough money
 Like nobody else's with me whatever some way it feels too big to handle on your
 Passion yeah, and we use all of our energy to deny the way we're built. Yeah, which is fatiguing. It's it's exhausting
 Worse though, we end up with contempt for who we are and how we're made
 Because that passion that's inside of us won't go away
 so now we have
 anger about our anger like like who I am and how I'm wired and what I'm built for won't go away despite my efforts at
 depressing this thing and
 It's just not pretty yeah, so when we have contempt for ourselves like we're literally moving against ourselves
 We're denying the passion that we have. We hate that that passion is there. We're depressing it.
 All this energy that's supposed to be making us come alive and fuel our passion. We're working hard to suppress it.
 Yeah, and that's what leads to our depression. Yeah, and then when we're depressed, we actually close off our desire for life.
 Right.
 And then that closes off our desire for all the other feelings.
 Right. So we stop feeling our sadness.
 We stop feeling our fear. We stop feeling our loneliness.
 And as we know so far from looking at those feelings is when you feel those feelings,
 actually brings us to life.
 So we end up even more depressed,
 even more removed from full-hearted living.
 Right.
 Little hard-hearted, numb individual.
 Really important that you learn to find your anger
 and deal with it appropriately.
 Yeah.
 Chip says that all desire is rooted in the feeling of anger.
 Wow.
 I'm so angry at you.
 Now I'm scared, but we can't talk about fear until the next week.
 That's next week. Sorry, folks.
 I think when we did the training, they said that the anger is like the check engine light,
 you know, for your, for your person.
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. Like the check engine light in the car, which the check engine light doesn't actually tell you what the problem is.
 It just tells you is there's other problems under the hood.
 Yeah. And because anger is rarely ever felt on its own, it usually is a good thing.
 If you're feeling, if you're in touch with your anger, what else are you not yet in touch with?
 Right.
 But probably there's some sadness, some fear, some loneliness, you know, and other feelings
 lurking around there.
 There's stuff leaking under the hood.
 Yeah, that's good.
 Yeah, I forgot what that anger is the check engine light of your heart.
 You bring up the check engine light.
 I was thinking about groups this week.
 Like, so I do group on Tuesdays and I'm sitting in group and I'm listening to other people
 speak and they're like, who else needs some time this week?
 And I'm like, I'm super angry.
 Like I went to group really angry.
 And in my head, I'm just thinking, I know I'm angry, but I know talking about my anger
 won't change anything.
 Like what I'm angry about, me bringing to group, their responses won't change the things I'm
 angry about.
 Gotcha.
 Because I'm angry at COVID.
 Yes.
 I'm angry at people's reactions to COVID.
 I'm angry about all the misinformation that's being spread.
 I'm angry that I have to wade through utter nonsense to even find truth.
 I'm angry that people don't believe the truth that's out there.
 I'm just like angry, angry, angry.
 And I'm thinking, how on earth is sharing this, like going to fix anything?
 I got to fix people.
 And so then I have this thought,
 all this work I'm doing on my own
 to keep my anger away from the group
 means I'm not present with group.
 And I'm actually here for me.
 So I'm actually denying what I need
 by managing what I'm feeling.
  </li><li>Gotcha.
  </li><li>Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Right.
 So if you're sitting with me,
 and you're feeling really angry about stuff
 that has nothing to do with me,
 you're still keeping yourself from me
 by not sharing it.
  </li><li>'Cause I'm off in my own little therapy session
 on my own going, "Oh no, that's not appropriate."
 or, and I'm not being present with people.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so I think, well, what the heck?
 You know, this is what I'm here for.
 So I just start talking about my anger.
 I just start talking about anger about this
 and they're just listening to me
 and they're just letting me talk.
 And what I realize is the more I talk,
 the more I realize, not only am I angry,
 but I am deeply afraid.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm really sad.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm really lonely.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like I'm lonely because I'm thinking,
 maybe I'm the only person that thinks like this.
 I'm deeply fearful that maybe everyone's right.
 Maybe I'm wrong.
 And I'm really sad that like, I can't change anything.
 And so you think, well, what did you get out of that?
 Well, what I got out of that was feeling my anger,
 led me to all these other feelings.
 I didn't know was there back to your check engine thing.
 And then yes, sharing those things didn't change COVID.
 I didn't come out with that group and COVID had vanished.
 I didn't come out of that group.
 And everyone was like, yeah, okay,
 here's some great protocols to follow.
 People are still making the decisions
 they're going to make. But what happened was I became more alive, less fearful, less lonely,
 less scared just by talking and processing and being with my feelings.
 Right. And when you talk and you process and you are with your feelings, it also stops the
 pylon effect of, you know, it's just getting more and more and more of the same.
 Yeah. And also I am now with people. I'm not just over here,
 retreating, trying to sanitize what I'm feeling. You know, because there's also some shame and
 some guilt like, well, you know, I'm a pastor, I shouldn't be thinking things about people
 like that. I have shame that like, you know, how dare you think that you know all the answers,
 you know, and so, and I'm trying to talk myself out of my feelings. And it's so beautiful
 just to let your anger run free and be with people in your anger, in your passion.
 In your passion. Yeah. Yeah. Is it scary when I say in your anger?
 Still, I'm still trying and setting like, it's beautiful in your anger. He means passion.
 Passion, yes.
 You know the other thing upon reflection, I found that talking about what I was angry
 about revealed my passion.
 No surprise, my passion is to teach.
 But what brings about me is like, I want to teach and I want to educate and I want to
 encourage and I want to rebuke and I want to bring correction.
 Like I come alive as a teacher, like I love the whole teaching process.
 And I think probably what my sadness was is I don't know if anybody even listened to me
 if I start teaching about this stuff,
 'cause I'm not a scientist, I'm not a epidemiologist,
 or I can't even say the word,
 like who am I to say anything on this?
  </li><li>You have to be able to say the word first,
 I'm pretty sure, yeah.
  </li><li>But it helped identify my passion.
 One of the other things I felt really angry about this week
 is about halfway through the week,
 I read about Ahmad Arbery, the young man.
 For those of you who are not in the US,
 I don't know if this story has made it outside the US,
 but it's a 25 year old black man who was just jogging.
 and was murdered by two white men.
  </li><li>A father and son in Georgia.
  </li><li>A father and son in Georgia.
 And I read about it midweek and was just like so sad.
 Like, are you, like, are you just, I felt sad,
 I felt angry, I felt lots of fear that like,
 nothing would be done.
 And then I realized as terrible as that is,
 it's worse because it happened in February
 and no charges were ever pressed.
  </li><li>Oh, I didn't know that.
 Oh yeah, it happened in February.
 And no, the police showed up and took a statement.
 And then if you read, I don't wanna miss cool articles,
 but if you read it, basically people recuse themselves from it,
 and no charges were ever pressed.
 And so then a video was released
 that showed this young man getting shot.
 And so like, I'm angry and I'm like, I'm angry that it's happened.
 I'm angry that this man lost his life.
 I'm angry that there's gonna be sides drawn up.
 I'm angry that there's going to be endless discussion.
 I'm angry that it's going to be politicized.
 I'm deeply sad that this young man's lost his life.
 I'm deeply sad that there's a family
 who's grieving the loss of a son.
  </li><li>And that it looked like people had gotten away with it.
  </li><li>Ah, and I'm so angry because if the roles were reversed
 and it was a one white man running
 who was killed by two black men,
 it would be a completely different story.
 And so I'm angry and I'm sad.
 I don't know what to do with it.
 And so I, and I'm angry that I don't know what to do with it.
 just like, so I'm trying to write my feelings a little better.
 So I get on Twitter and I just, I just express my sadness, I express my anger.
 And I end my tweet with this real statement.
 Like I am sad that my only response I know to do is retweet this news article.
 Yes. No sooner did I hit send and just in that moment of feeling my sadness
 of enough to write 280 characters, I'm now in touch with my,
 with my anger and I'm in touch with my passion and so I then formulate this next
 tweet where I'm like actually now I felt my anger and my sad I'm realizing
 actually I can do something other than just retweet I can pray like I am
 angry about justice being done and my father my heavenly father is a righteous
 judge yes that's right I can pray and so now I'm like now I'm feeling the
 passionate. Yeah, I can pray. And then I'm like, well, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. All my
 fear that this is just going to be another politicized debate that's really going to go
 to anywhere and the sides are going to form and empty rhetoric is going to be spoken left
 right and center. I'm like, actually, I've got a gospel message that I can preach that is far
 more powerful than policy. And so I'm realizing, okay, passion is arising for the kingdom of God,
 for the for not only justice to be done, of course, I want justice.
 But I'm also a believer in God who brings redemption.
 And so I've got confidence that knowing God, knowing what God who God is,
 knowing what God is like, he can bring redemption from this horrible situation.
 So yeah, I'm going to pray for justice, but I'm also going to pray for redemption.
 Now my anger and my sadness at feeling helpless is turned to the anger of passion of
 like, this is actually what I'm built for.
 this is who I am, I can actually pray and see the kingdom built so that we have different
 options available to us than what we've had in our history, which is all the stuff I talked
 about before, politicized, debate, and nothing really changing.
 Right.
 I mean, those are two real-time examples of where my anger felt like it was taking me
 to a cliff of frustration, but sitting in the anger led me to other options I didn't
 know was available, that all pointed to the passion of who I'm and how I'm built.
 Yeah.
 I think that that is really, I guess, handy isn't the right word, but I'm just thinking,
 I have loved since getting the language of anger being passionate and all that kind of stuff
 to realize when I am angry about something, to then go the step of saying, okay, I'm angry because
 what? What am I angry for? What do I want to change? What is it that because actually that
 will probably point me towards something that God's talking to me about. Exactly. God put the passion
 in you that is now being stirred up in you for something.
 Yeah.
 And God's always in a partnership.
 So what is that that your anger is leading you to partner with God to do that you couldn't
 have done before?
 Yeah.
 So we're recording this Friday night.
 I think it was this morning all the days blur into one.
 The two men that that murdered Ahmad have been charged with murder.
 Yes.
 And I think really we saw two or three days of everybody posting about and saying this
 is not okay.
 I'm feeling their anger about it.
 feeling their anger and being passionate about something,
 he didn't change.
 Yeah.
 And I know there was a petition that went around.
 And but it seemed like because a bunch of people got passionate,
 something shifted.
 Right.
 Yeah, which brings up more feelings of sadness that a bunch of people,
 I saw someone tweet a brilliant thing that they just sad, brilliant thing.
 They said just a reminder that they, these people were charged with murder
 because you saw the video, not because they saw the video, like that video had
 already been seen and nothing being done.
 It was when the public at large saw the video and got like you said got passion. Yeah, so anger
 It's a good thing. So often when we teach this
 People will bring up different passages from scripture about anger. So like when Paul says to put away anger, right?
 Or the anger of man does not work the righteousness of God
 So what do you do with those passages? Right?
 I think what you do about it is you look at what else does the scripture have to say about it?
 Yeah. And you know, my favorite verse on this topic is Ephesians 4, 26,
 where it says, "Be angry and do not sin." Right. So the same person who said,
 "Put away anger." Is the same person that also said, "Be angry and do not sin."
 And I think that's the key because we know that Jesus was a really angry person.
 And we know that our instruction was, "I'm transiting in my head. Jesus was a really angry person,
 i.e. He was very passionate. Yes, he was okay. We can keep going."
 It's also important to note that the verse you quoted about the anger of man does not work the
 righteousness of God begins with be slow to anger. So like it's not like don't be angry. It's like
 hey in your anger be slow in your anger be when you're in your anger be slow with what you do
 and the verse I just quoted there is like be angry but do not sin because when you're angry
 your passion is on display. So Bob, it's not wrong for Bob Galdoff to be angry about people dying
 and wanting to motivate people. It wasn't helpful that he said dropped an f-bomb on live TV in 1985.
 Yeah, yeah. So and the same for us, you think about the times when your passion gets stirred,
 like even in group, like even in group this week, I'm angry and I'm my passion was on display and
 Somebody said something to me and I quipped at them.
 Right now my quipping was wrong, my being angry was not.
 Gotcha.
 What about that part in the gospel?
 I forget where it is where Jesus heals on the Sabbath
 and he knows that the Pharisees are angry
 and he says he's angry because he knew their heart.
 Yeah.
 Right. So there's an example of Jesus angry or,
 you know, turning over the money changers tables in the court.
 He was angry, but we also know the book of Hebrews says
 that he did not sin.
 Right.
 So there is Jesus' anger, his passion on display, and he didn't sin.
 Right.
 So anger isn't a sin.
 You're on good biblical ground.
 Like your anger can lead to, can be fertile ground to sin, but this is why we need to get
 good at feeling our anger and making room for our passion and for anger and understanding
 us what God put in us and he wants it to come out.
 So you've got Jesus being angry.
 You've got lots of other people in the Bible and throughout history who are angry.
 Yes.
 Like passionate to see change.
 Who who like Moses, right now again his anger got him into trouble.
 Yeah.
 So he killed an Egyptian for oppressing the Israelites, but you saw his passion
 for the people of God to be treated well.
 A passion, by the way, that was later fulfilled in his prophetic destiny as
 somebody who brought them out into freedom on God's timing.
 But you see his passion trying to achieve those means by himself, which led to murder.
 Yes.
 Again, murder bad passion.
 Good God used and partnered that passion with his divine providence.
 to set people free.
 Right.
 How about Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?
 Yeah.
 An angry person for racial equality
 and for an end to injustice,
 that his passion was on display,
 a man who was very, very measured in his anger,
 but his anger drove him to do say things
 that were not popular at the time.
 Right.
 For a greater good.
 And absolutely bring change.
 Yeah.
 Mother Teresa.
 Yeah.
 Heidi Baker.
 Yeah.
 Like, now, Heidi.
 Heidi does not strike you
 She is an angry person in the rah, but no, she's passionate though.
 Something is fueling her to live among the poorest of the poor.
 Yeah.
 Not just for like a three week, you know, short term mission strip, but to give her life over
 to that.
 There's anger.
 There's passion.
 Um, and it's beautiful.
 So that's our fourth feeling, anger.
 So the gift of anger, remember, is passion and the impairment is depression.
 And so we don't want to actually live from depression.
 No, we don't.
 Next time you're feeling angry, ask yourself, "What am I angry for? Not who am I angry at?"
 Yes.
