<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the chances.
 Lord of Catan.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Happy New Year to you, Sire.<br/>
 Thank you so much.<br/>
 Wait, what's the female Lord?<br/>
 A lady, maybe.<br/>
 Lady Catan.<br/>
 Lady of Catan.<br/>
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 Do you want to talk about your Catan?<br/>
 Nest.<br/>
 Addiction.<br/>
 Well, it's not an addiction.<br/>
 Oh, sure.<br/>
 No, no, that's the first indicator it is an addiction.
 Well, it's actually Brett Radliff's fault.
 If you're going to blame somebody, blame Brett Radliff.
 Yeah, he's got wide shoulders.<br/>
 He can take it.<br/>
 I've been playing, you know, just normal cattan on my iPad.
 And then he said, have you tried the upgrades like the seafarers
 or the Knights and cities?<br/>
 See, I knew it was a gateway drug.<br/>
 worth problems.<br/>
 And I was like, no, I haven't tried it yet.
 So I thought, okay, I'm going to spend some of my Christmas money and upgrade my game.
 Well, it's so much more fun because I just always won.
 Is there any way to explain what Settlers of Catan is?
 Now, bear in mind that I've been married to you for a long time.
 I've watched you play Catan a lot, still haven't a clue what it's about.
 So there's an island.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 And on the island, there's a bunch of settlers and you're one of the settlers.
 So there's either three or four settlers.
 And you get to build cities and build towns and trade resources and build roads.
 And basically the first person to kind of take over the island, like build the most
 stuff while sort of keeping their other settlers at bay, they win.
 Sounds quite similar to Mario.<br/>
 If you add some mushrooms, bowser.<br/>
 No, Luigi, no, it says to save you have to think and strategize the whole time.
 Uh huh.<br/>
 Yeah, I didn't think I strategize once while playing.
 I know.<br/>
 You just run off of things into your death.
 Well, there you go.<br/>
 Getting your bubble.<br/>
 Yeah, I know.<br/>
 Well, happy new year, darling.<br/>
 Thank you, darling.<br/>
 Do you want to tell the people what we did for New Year's Eve?
 We cleaned and organized.<br/>
 Well, I mean, that's what we've done all vacation.
 What do we do New Year's Eve or Hogman is?
 It's called in Scotland.<br/>
 I played Catan on my iPad.<br/>
 But you're not addicted.<br/>
 That's, we must stress, totally not addicted.
 With the fire on and the age chocolate.
 And I set up our new budget for the year in YNAB, my software of choice.
 Yeah, that's pretty much what it was like all night.
 It was very quiet.<br/>
 It was blessed.<br/>
 We put our kids to bed.<br/>
 They're like, can we stay up to?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 And they went bad.<br/>
 And then we went about our ways.<br/>
 And we did stay up until midnight, but not on purpose.
 No.<br/>
 In fact, we didn't even say happy New Year's to each other, even though we went to bed
 after midnight.<br/>
 I said it to you when I woke up.<br/>
 Oh, you did.<br/>
 But yes, tidying our house.<br/>
 We've had a revelation.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Revelation is I've realized what our house needs in order for it to stay tidy is us at home died. Yeah
 It's us at home. It's amazing how much stuff you can get done when you're physically at home
 We will have tidied and organized every room in our house. It's a room by room purge
 But it's so nice it's so nice to have<br/>
 The rooms clean things put away so you know everything goes
 It's easier to keep clean that way the trick is maintaining that
 Totally, but it's a nice starting off point. We haven't actually had it this clean ever
 And I've purged like boxes full of the kids toys out you but we do that at night when they can't see yeah
 So they never notice no I've done that with your canvas a swagger
 What never mind let's move on what?<br/>
 You took my Canada sweatshirt<br/>
 Maybe I am checking the closet as soon as we're done. The thing is it was a sweatshirt
 I'm in a tar and feathery pillow with honey and saltine crackers if my sweatshirt is missing it hasn't been a sweatshirt for many years
 It's a friend<br/>
 If it's a friend, it's a wino that's sleep
 All right, let's go get onto important stuff, okay our friend will yes who is of English descent
 Yes indeed known as mr. Will to all our kids most you will went home to England for Christmas yes and.
 He said you want anything when i'm in England which is a foolish thing to ask.
 Because of course you do of course i do i always want something so i gave him a fairly extensive list not limited to but certainly included monster munch more might.
 Terry's disgusting.<br/>
 Terry's chocolate orange better.<br/>
 Marks and Spencer's prong crackers they're good to you yeah I ate the whole bag to me.
 What you said you started paleo and I was helping us I finished.
 Maybe it's marriage support.<br/>
 Thanks darling I so appreciate that and so much Cadbury's minstrels curly whirlys and the list goes on on on on absolutely delicious.
 And so thank you will for doing that our kids were thrilled to see mr will yesterday when he came over to help me finish another mario game which i digress he looked like.
 Santa claus with this massive stack of stuff that he brought i didn't expect to bring the whole list however wasn't enough that will brought us back up with the of british surprises.
 But his parents got in on the action to and so we just want to stop and say thank you to Edward and Catherine for popping in some dark chocolate mints as recommended by the queen.
 Really and some of your favorite soap yes thank you very much yeah thank you for doing that and by the way you did a great job raising a brilliant son who's excellent at mario games i'm sure that's all they ever wanted.
 So baby excited for the new year i am super excited about this year me to like 2015 was awesome it really was but i feel like 2016 is just going to be an incredible year.
 Yeah, I forget who it was, but I thought I'd heard somebody talk about the year of unspeakable
 glory. It might have been Mark DePone. No, I asked Mark and he said it wasn't him.
 But it would be great if this year was a year of unspeakable glory.
 Yeah, come on. Why not? Why not?<br/>
 Do you make any resolutions? I have, yes. I've made some resolutions,
 but I don't know if I want to share them because I made a lot last year and I only
 actually did a few, but I actually did them. So I want to be more strategic.
 aren't resolutions like wishes when you blow up candles on the cake that they don't come true if you tell them what they are.
 Oh yeah that's right okay good absolutely got my theology straight.
 Would you like to know what our topic is for this week I would well I've been reviewing the year like a good contemplating and I've been thinking about 2015 and thinking about the things I learned.
 Think about the things I'd like to do differently this year yeah and it all stems out of two messages that were preached at grace and when passed a surprise was here.
 He kept saying this great phrase over and over and he and i can't do surprises accent.
 If you haven't heard surprise i'll put a link in the show notes to when surprise was on the podcast.
 And i guarantee your mind will be blown let's just say that he has lost count the number of people he's raised from the dead so let's leave that there but when surprise was here he had this phrase he kept saying don't spend time at the table of reasoning spend time at the table of obedience.
 Right. And it stuck with me. I was just like, that's, you know, first, I was like, what does that even mean?
 And then more and more, he shared and the more stories he shared and, you know, just getting to ask him questions,
 that more became apparent of what he was talking about. Basically, the premise is
 God meets us with something.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And then we present to him all the reasons why that won't work and ask for answers to our questions, but don't obey.
 Right.<br/>
 And he was like, actually, just follow the Lord and the answers will be given.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then a couple of weeks ago, Dr. Artie Kendall, who I gave him was proper title.
 Yes, he'll be very pleased.<br/>
 He came and spoke at Grace Center, an amazing message, really, out of the book of Luke.
 And it was Christmas times who's talking about the angel coming to John the Baptist's dad.
 What was John the Baptist's dad name?<br/>
 Zachariah.<br/>
 Zachariah, thank you.<br/>
 And basically the premise of Artie's message was, are you ready for answered prayer?
 Right.<br/>
 Well, you put those two together and I began thinking about a situation pertinent to my heart and began thinking about the patterns in my life where God speaks,
 and historically I've been very slow to follow God.
 And it's not out of arrogance or I wouldn't even like to think it's out of disobedience,
 but I think it's actually in retrospect out of unbelief.
 Yeah.<br/>
 We mean, yeah, you just agree with that.
 I'm sorry.<br/>
 Would you like me to take longer?<br/>
 Well, the thing is, I think God comes and tells us something, gives us some revelation
 or a direction or a place to go.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I've been thinking that my thinking about what he's saying is wisdom, but actually,
 it's just fear.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Let me give you an example.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 When we started thinking about moving to Nashville, we weren't thinking of moving to Nashville
 at all. We were with John and Carol. We'd gone away with them for a couple of days to pray about
 what happens next. And out of the blue, Carol shares this vision and happens to mention Nashville.
 We don't know where Nashville is on the map. Literally, we don't know.
 And it's not anything. No clue. Couldn't point it out on a map of America.
 And as soon as she said Nashville, the Holy Spirit just dropped a bomb in all four of our hearts.
 right there and then we both just let up well four of us did john and carol were sad because they
 realized oh you guys are moving to national we were excited because we thought we're moving to
 national and there's no explanation for that there's nothing rational about that at all but
 there was just this holy spirit jump in our hearts right and rather than following that
 i think i just dismissed it you didn't you held on to it your heart percolated about it
 Yeah, since that point and I like to percolate.
 Yeah, but you know, I don't know if it was my content player.
 I'm not going to assign blame.<br/>
 I, I just dismissed it and was like, well, you know, what would we do?
 Let's wait.<br/>
 I remember saying, well, what would we do?
 How would we get there?<br/>
 How would we live?<br/>
 Just all the who, how, where, when, why, why?
 The table of reasoning.<br/>
 Instantly the table of reasoning.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Kicks in.<br/>
 And I should point out that when I talk about reasoning, I'm not talking about.
 seeking counsel or making plans or weighing decisions. I'm not talking about that at all.
 I'm talking about a hard attitude of how can that be God? You've instantly dismissed what God's
 trying to birth because it doesn't make sense to our finite minds. Or it doesn't seem logical.
 Totally. So we go from that meeting and it's not as if it was just that. You actually got
 several confirmations. I had a dream, the most life-changing dream in Iceland about moving to Nashville
 was a direct instruction to call Jeff dollar who we didn't know. I had an angelic visitation.
 Like all these things, when I tell the story, people were like, man, I wish I would get all that
 sort of stuff before I needed to move. But even with that, I'm still incredibly slow
 to take it seriously that's wrong way of saying that still incredibly slow to actually think about
 moving on it and you're incredibly patient at watching me in analysis paralysis what was going on
 your heart when all this was going on by the way just for free i mean i just did a lot of
 praying and saying lord i really believe this is you we speak to alan's heart i mean from literally
 from the time that we were in the car with john and carol because i just knew and then once we came
 I knew that I knew.<br/>
 And so...<br/>
 The joy of being married to a prophetess.
 Well, but I mean, we never do anything unless we both know and we never try and make the other person know.
 Right, you're really good at that.<br/>
 So, I just waited and I prayed and sometimes I felt a little frustrated.
 If you know, if I'm honest, but I'd just be like, "Okay, God, I need you to help me with this.
 I feel frustrated."<br/>
 You know, but it was fine.<br/>
 And the funny thing was, once the thing got through to my head, our move here was just
 rapid.<br/>
 I mean, unheard of rapid.<br/>
 Yeah, really fast.<br/>
 We got our US visas in one day.<br/>
 One day.<br/>
 And we came and visited in October to just speak to some people.
 And then we moved here December 16th.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Like that's insane.<br/>
 You don't move countries in two months.
 Yeah, I think it was more like six weeks, but yeah, it was crazy.
 Yeah, totally crazy.<br/>
 Here's a contemporary example that actually happened this year.
 I remember Graham Cook saying, "I think that generally in the body of Christ, we're way
 behind where we should be in the path that God has for us, like individually and corporately."
 And I was like, "Okay, yeah."<br/>
 So contemporary example, two years ago, I'm just with the Lord, I'm journaling, and the
 Lord speaks something to my heart.<br/>
 The next day I go to church and David Wagner picks me out the crowd and tells me the same
 thing I just heard the Lord say the day before.
 And rather than going, man, I need to get on this.
 I was just like, that was amazing.<br/>
 Full stop.<br/>
 Hey.<br/>
 And now what's for lunch?<br/>
 Like, yeah, totally.<br/>
 That's just crazy.<br/>
 And to be fair, I stepped out a little.
 But early this year, the Lord speaks to me about it again.
 And it's like, hey, Alan, that thing.<br/>
 What do you think?<br/>
 So earlier this year, at the start of 2015, the Lord's like, "Hey, remember that thing?"
 And remember how David confirmed that?
 Yeah, I was serious about that.<br/>
 And I instantly met God with all my questions, a table of reasoning.
 Yeah, but how's that ever going to happen?
 And how would we afford that?<br/>
 And what would we do?<br/>
 And where are we going to find time?<br/>
 And what are people going to think?<br/>
 All of the questions, you know, meeting God with who I'm not, rather than saying, "Okay,
 God, let's look at who you are."<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And the thing is, it's not that I'm going in the opposite direction.
 It's not that I'm being stubborn.<br/>
 There's just no movement because I'm busy doing what he told me to do,
 but not what he's telling me to do.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 You're being faithful in the things that we currently have, right?
 But almost putting all dreaming and everything on hold
 because it feels difficult to stretch like that.
 Right.<br/>
 I'm carrying out yesterday's vision, thinking and being faithful
 while ignoring tomorrow's call.<br/>
 Well, and you are being faithful.<br/>
 Oh, it's important to be faithful in the vision that is today's vision.
 But if you don't actually start walking towards tomorrow's vision, when you get to
 tomorrow, you've got nothing to do.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 I was thinking about this earlier when we were thinking about what we're going to
 share.<br/>
 And I thought of that verse in Matthew 4, where Jesus said, man does not live on
 bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.
 Right.<br/>
 And it's that constant proceeding.<br/>
 The constant revelation is where you get fed.
 Right.<br/>
 You know, you don't want to be stagnant.
 So that's early 2015 by August of 2015, the Lord brings up again.
 And this time gives me some specific steps like, Hey, you know, follow these things.
 And still I didn't do anything with it.
 No, because I'm busy, frightened.<br/>
 I'm just, you know, I'm thinking, what are people going to think?
 Bob, Bob, Bob, you know, whatever.<br/>
 And also one of the big things we get saying is when we have the time, when
 when we have the time because with launching year two and stuff, our time really got used
 up a lot. So it seems logical to reason.
 Right. But God's not asking for our input. He's asking for our obedience.
 Right.<br/>
 When we were away this Thanksgiving at my sisters in North Carolina, we went to Elevation Church
 and the pastor who's speaking there said this great line, he said, "Delayed obedience is disobedience."
 And man, that was, you know, that was surprising.
</p><ul>
  <li>I remember you wrote it down, didn't you?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I was just like, okay Lord, I'm hearing you.
 I will obey.
 Well, and then come to December, I'm thinking,
 you know what, Lord, I'm not gonna end this year
 in disobedience.
 So I just do the steps that he's given for me to do.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause I think we get overwhelmed with vision, like,
 Lord, how are we ever gonna do that?
 And Lord's like, we'll just do this.
  </li><li>Do the thing that's right in front of me.
  </li><li>Right, so I did the thing that was right in front of me.
 And all my fears vanished.
 Bing Bang Bob, it all got worked out.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'm like, God, why did I delay
 what you were doing for a year?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Are you kidding me?
  </li><li>Bummer.
  </li><li>Why?
 Or even why not do that two years ago?
  </li><li>Right.
 Well, yeah.
  </li><li>What are you gonna say?
  </li><li>I was gonna say, well, I don't know if he fully told you
 that two years ago, and he sort of gave you the blueprint
 for how to do it more in August than me.
  </li><li>Right, but I'm pretty sure.
  </li><li>But you probably could've asked him for that earlier.
 Yeah.
 Totally.
 Yeah.
 So this year, I'm asking the Lord.
 I'm just saying, Lord, by your grace, I want to be obedient.
 I want to bring up my doer in response to what you're asking.
 I actually forsaking everything else, reputation, fear of man.
 I just want to be totally obedient.
 And the time between you telling me something and me doing something,
 I want to be ridiculously sure.
 Yeah.
 You know, one of the strategies the Lord gave me?
 What?
 Because I just said, would you help me with that?
 Because I'm even anxious with the stuff you've asked me to walk out in 2016.
 Right.
 Well, first of all, anxieties and never fruit of the Holy Spirit.
 So okay, Holy Spirit, how many of what's going on there?
 And the Holy Spirit said, actually, Alan, I've put amazing people around you
 who will call you on your stuff.
 So why don't you just move forward and everything believing it to me
 and trust that I've put great people around you and listen to them when they go, Hey,
 Well, that's the thing. You do listen. You do stop and listen if somebody calls you up on something.
 Right. I think I try and preempt it. Yeah. Though, I think I'll try and live with wisdom and caution,
 but not realizing that that's just to actually fear and insecurity. Right.
 Like amazingly enough, as I've been reflecting on this, I was like,
 "Lord, there's an awful lot of fear motivating me to stay put." Right.
 I thought it's prudence, but actually it's just ugly fear.
 And God uses things way better than fear to motivate you.
 Absolutely right.
 So what do you think about all that?
 I mean, obviously you've been, you've had a front wheel ticket to all this going on in my life.
 But how do you feel that applies to your life?
 I don't know.
 Like I, I don't feel like I don't have any big vision type things that God has given me that I haven't
 pursued at the moment, other than the books.
 Like, so I feel, I feel some pressure to finish the books that he's given me vision for.
 Um, but I know he's not, I know he's not mad.
 So that is not about whether he's mad at me or performing or anything like that.
 It's just like, God, if you're asking me to do something, then there's going to be
 life at the end of that tunnel and I want that life.
 So, you know, how do I do that?
 So I think that's part of my resolutions that we're not talking about.
 You know, it's like, oh, I see I'm probing where I should not be probing.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Um, yeah.
 So I mean, it's things like that where I'm like, okay, God, help me to be obedient.
 Um, and know that you can help me figure out the timing of it.
 Or even where to get the time to do it.
 So that's what's going on in my life.
 How are you doing, dear listener, with your following the dreams of God that he has for your life?
 Yeah, and not reasoning it away, but actually stepping out in faith and obedience.
 All right.
 I've got three things to share with you as we wrap up.
 Okay.
 Three recommendations.
 First thing is RT Kendall, who we mentioned earlier, wrote an amazing blog post about reading the Bible.
 Uh huh.
 And there was a couple things that jumped out of me he was like we've got to stay where many Christians can't discern error because they don't know truth right and i was like that that's amazing so i'll put a link to that in the show notes go have a read of that.
 Today all day i've been listening to amanda cooks album with came out of good it seems like a while ago i don't know how i missed it yeah.
 It's called a brave new world it is if you're in the mood for some sort of mellow.
 Holy spirit infused music it's not like a live worship album which you would know a man therefore from battle music.
 So studio album but it is amazing just put that on.
 Set fire to something i don't set fire to something turn on your fire that's the phrase i was looking for.
 And it was just awesome. I've had it on repeat pretty much all day. Love that too. So I'll put a link to that in the show notes.
 And then applications for Grace and her School of Supernatural Life will be opening shortly. We'd love it if you would consider coming and spending eight months with us at Grace and I have your life changed.
 We'll talk about that in the coming weeks. Just about that bug in your ear. The school starts in September. So you've got plenty of time to start thinking about it. Application will open in a couple of weeks.
 Yeah.
 Anything, baby?
 Yeah. I just want to pray for everybody for the year.
 Oh, go for it.
 All right. So Father, I thank you for every single person that's listening. And Lord, I ask that this
 year would be a year for each one of them that is marked by incredible favor and breakthrough.
 Lord, that their intimacy level with you and just their closeness with you would
 increase the things that they have been longing for, that they would see those things come to
 fruition. And yeah, Lauren, I just asked this would be the best year yet in Jesus' wonderful name.
 Amen.
