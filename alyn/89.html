<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is hey baby you've been watching the
 Super Bowl haven't you I have I can tell it is Super Bowl 50 I feel more American when
 I watch the Super Bowl you cried when they say the national it's absolutely true I cried
 when they sang the national anthem I love you you're adorable and I cried at the Cold
 play halfway through.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 Yeah, just when it ends and I thought it was excellent.
 I loved it.<br/>
 It was very good.<br/>
 It's still going right now.<br/>
 We'll record this podcast currently.<br/>
 Denver is at 16 and the Panthers are at 10.
 What do you need to win it?<br/>
 Well, I don't know.<br/>
 Do you need to get to like the 21 or 50 or something?
 No, I think you just have to be ahead of the other guys by a certain amount of points.
 I don't know.<br/>
 I text Brett and Shaley all those questions.
 on standby for all of my texts.<br/>
 Yeah, we have a friend, Brett Rallif, who was an NFL quarterback.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And he is very patient with us, ignorant lumps.
 I'm like, what is taking a knee?<br/>
 What is HGH?<br/>
 What is, I'm like texting them all these questions and they just sweetly answer everything, but
 I'm pretty sure they're laughing.<br/>
 I wanted to know how you got a Super Bowl ring because a friend of ours has a Super Bowl
 ring.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And it turns out you actually have to win to get the ring.
 not just play, but win.<br/>
 And does he have one or two?
</p><ul>
  <li>I don't know.
 I thought you would at least get something
 for showing up maybe like some cufflinks.
  </li><li>Super Bowl cufflinks?
  </li><li>Yeah, or type in.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah.
 'Cause you wanna wear that proudly.
  </li><li>I hope there aren't Super Bowl related questions
 in our citizenship exam.
  </li><li>I know, 'cause we will be toast.
  </li><li>I was speaking to our friend, Bill, the other day,
 and he was in the he used to coach,
 what's the other sport of the Americans love?
 baseball. I thought, what if MJ shows interest in any sports? I mean, I'm doing my best to
 steer him away from that. But what if he does show some interest? I'm going to have to be
 pulling out a lot of favors from friends who are athletic in nature.
 But we have tons of athletic friends. So we should be able to do
 should we tell you fine? Yeah, perfect. Yeah. All right, this week was
 ascended brilliantly and was thoroughly enjoyable the whole week.
 It was you, John Romans.
 I did verse by verse three Romans for the first eight chapters.
 How did that go?
 Any, any standout points that you want to comment on?
 Oh, I'd probably have to think about that, but it was good.
 It was very good.
 I mean, it's, it's amazing how.
 Wait, what are you saying?
 You were very good.
 I love your confidence.
 I just mean, I just mean looking at it together with the class.
 Like it's amazing how something that was written 2,000 years ago is still
 applicable, you know.
 Um, anyway, I, I think there's so much goodness.
 in those first eight chapters that we all left very full.
 And I was just teasing. I know you were good. All the students said you were good.
 Oh, good.
 I was just teasing you and poking fun at your great self-confidence.
 Oh, thank you.
 While you were teaching Romans, I was teaching on practical life skills, like how to organize
 your calendar and budget money and be brilliant.
 Right.
 I think it might have overwhelmed some of the students when talking about the lengths I've
 gone to to automate our life.
 Like how everything is controlled from your phone in our house?
 Yeah, and on a schedule.
 So.
 Except for that stinking vacuum cleaner that just randomly comes on.
 Everyone's well, it doesn't randomly come on.
 It's programmed to come on and I need to program it to not come on.
 So you programmed it to come on at 6 30 in the morning.
 When I got her name, I accidentally touched a button that did.
 Yes, program it.
 So I need to unprogram it.
 Yeah, you do.
 Did you know that that we have a Roomba, like a robotic vacuum cleaner?
 Yeah.
 I did know that.
 No, no, no.
 I know you knew that I've done the listeners.
 But did you, AJ Jones, know that it came with a remote control?
 No.
 So you can send the sofa that has a little joy pad and you can control where it goes.
 You're kidding.
 Now we could chase the kids.
 You know, MJ is already terrified of that thing.
 But if we had a cat, that would be awesome.
 Or it was on Parks and Rec.
 I'm going to need some better reasons to have a cat.
 DJ Roomba.
 He could just, oh, there's so many options.
  </li><li>You could put a bowl of guacamole on it
 and it parties just pass it round to people.
  </li><li>Yes, now you're thinking,
 at least then it would be useful.
  </li><li>It's very useful.
  </li><li>It's useful, I suppose.
  </li><li>It's random.
 It's, if you need to have your room cleaned
 in a short period of time, do it yourself
 because it may never get to the areas that you wanna do.
  </li><li>Hey, you take that back.
  </li><li>No.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yesterday, let's just say that vacuum cleaner
 does more vacuuming than you do.
 It does not.
 So does it.
 When was the last time you vacuumed our bedroom?
 Our bedroom?
 Yeah.
 A couple of weeks ago.
 Okay.
 When was the last time it vacuumed our bedroom?
 Well, yesterday, but it hadn't vacuumed anything successfully in weeks before that.
 Let's get started on.
 That's because it's random.
 It is random in its nature.
 Yes.
 But the reason...
 No, you can just stop there.
 Just you've agreed with me.
 You've moved on.
 It was a great week.
 You said you taught up a practical life skills.
 All right.
 I love you.
 You're very cute.
 Should we talk to the people about our argument first thing this morning?
 Uh, sure.
 I loved it.
 I didn't.
 We were so bad to you this morning.
 Me somewhat more petty than you.
 Yes.
 So every Sunday morning we get up at six.
 Yes.
 And no, we don't.
 Don't wait.
 We don't.
 We don't get up at six.
 No, we're supposed to get up to six.
 Yes, you make the lights kind of come on at six,
 but you still snore right through that, but it wakes me up.
 Nobody enjoys getting up to six.
 Yeah.
 No, you have it in your head that every Sunday morning,
 you're the first person to get out of bed.
 I am always the first person to get out of bed Sunday morning or any other morning.
 That may be true, but why is that a bad thing?
 It is true.
 It's a bad thing.
 I remember telling you like two years ago on our anniversary, like, babe, I love being
 Mary to you. Is there anything I could do to change? And I was like, yes, could you get up in the morning?
 Okay.
 Could you be the first one up? Or could you at least get up when I get up?
 Can you explain to me why that's important?
 It's just important. I'm not in this by myself.
 And I don't always want to be the first person out of bed in the morning.
 And so what happened this morning?
 Well, I ended up getting out of bed.
 No, no, no, you've jumped to the end of the story.
 What happened this morning?
 I refuse to get out of bed first.
 like Corona dolls and you refuse to get a bed like grown adults who are about to go worship the Lord.
 We literally turned our backs on each other and refused to get a bed.
 But then eventually I had to go to the bathroom. No, no, no, no. How did it happen?
 Because it was a brilliant piece of maneuvering on my part.
 How do you figure brilliant, the highly frustrating? I had to go to the bathroom.
 No, you handed me your phone. And what did I do with your phone?
 I only handed you my phone because I already had to go the bathroom, but I showed you my
 phone a picture on my phone and you snatched it out of my hand and threw it on the floor
 so that I couldn't look at my phone anymore.
 And then what did you do?
 I stripped all the covers off the bed and left you naked.
 Oh, we're spiritual giants.
 And then as I'm going to the bathroom, you're like, "Can you turn the hot water for me?"
 And I was like, "No."
 So you had to get out of bed, which are no longer warm and snugly in and wait for that
 Oh my gosh, I love you even in those early mornings when we're both being as petty as
 each other.
 Well what you don't know is when you went into the toilet I was just about to open the
 shower and turn it to freezing cold because I thought you probably wouldn't check but
 you opened the door.
 See folks these are the things that a solid marriage is made of.
 It was just a little piece of revenge for the phone throwing.
 How will you enjoy my new beard?
 My mother said if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything.
 Okay, so what is it about the beard you don't like?
 It spikes me in the face every time you kiss me.
 Okay, but this is just the growing pains.
 My beard isn't puberty, right?
 No, it doesn't.
 Once it goes into full growth...
 You've done this before.
 It never gets to the point where it's nice.
 I'm feeling defeated.
 I need some support.
 I just want to be honest.
 So...
 I like the way...
 I like the way you're trying to convince the kids that they like it and they're like,
 no, and you're like, yes, you do.
 No, they didn't like it.
 No, they don't.
 If I give them tic-tacs, they love my beard.
 Right.
 Okay.
 You're bribing the children to like your beard.
 I like the way I say that I'm growing a beard because it sounds like I'm achieving
 things when in reality, I've actually just given up shaving.
 Right.
 But I quite like it.
 I'm growing under here.
 Okay.
 I just throw up a little.
 I'm not really, but I mean it, let's do it some point.
 It's not.
 Can we move on?
 Suddenly I've lost the interest of our cast.
 I'll tell you another highlight this week.
 We had our friends Tinkinsam here from Australia.
 We do.
 If you guys have no med Tinkinsam, you can hear their story.
 Go to alanonagia.com/58.
 They are currently in Australia.
 Well, currently they're in Nashville, but normally they're in Australia with our friends
 Gary and Sarah Morgan. And they are doing a phenomenal job there here for a couple of
 weeks while they start out some visa and immigration stuff. So we got to catch up with
 them. They're doing so well, aren't they?
 They're doing awesome. And they pulled off the most awesome surprises. So we kept watching
 their Instagram feed for all the people that they shocked who had no idea that they were
 here. So it was very sweet.
 On the topic of not getting a bed this morning, Mr. Glorious opportunity to tell the test
 of any of God's goodness. Do you want to talk about the mattress?
 Yes, well, so we've needed a new mattress for a long time, a couple of years.
 Why is that?
 Well, we bought a good mattress when we moved here.
 Yeah.
 But it just didn't hold together very well.
 No, I didn't know it was an expensive one.
 It looked like it was the floor of an abattoir.
 What's an abattoir?
 A place where you slaughter cows.
 Oh, dear God.
 OK.
 We see we got the mattress, but couldn't afford a mattress cover.
 That's right.
 'Cause we didn't pay for the mattress.
 There was a great life lesson right there.
 All was by mattress,
 'cause especially when you have kids.
 Yes.
 And you didn't quite give birth to the baby in the bed.
 No, I didn't.
 But there's lots of leaky diapers and all kinds of--
 Well, breast milk stains a mattress
 like you wouldn't believe in. Yes.
 It was splotched in yellow stains from top to bottom.
 This is gonna be the grossest podcast
 we've ever recorded.
 And then there was also two divots
 where like two horses would sleep each night.
  </li><li>Well.
  </li><li>This is a ditch that would not,
 so that's why we needed a new mattress anyway.
 So we needed a new mattress.
  </li><li>What was not supportive and we were in pain a lot.
 So yes, so needed a new mattress about,
 well, I think it was in the summer,
 I saw this thing on Instagram.
 So apparently those little advertisements work
 for Tuft and Needle.
 And so I followed that and I watched this whole video
 on these Tuft and Needle mattresses
 and how they get mailed to you.
 And they expand once you open the bag and blah blah blah.
 And they're much less expensive than--
  </li><li>Made in America. - Yes.
  </li><li>Great reviews.
 Apparently it's the highest rated product on Amazon.
  </li><li>Wow, yeah, they have amazing reviews.
 And I just liked their website too.
 It was really clean and like all the visuals of it.
 It appealed to me.
 So I was like, you're a sucker for good marketing.
 Yeah, maybe.
 Yeah.
 And so anyway, I'd seen them in the summer
 and I was like, oh, I'd love to get one,
 but it's still like $800.
 So I was like, forget it passed.
 Right.
 Then on the weekend, I had seen a picture of them again.
 I don't know where I saw it.
 And I was like, Lord, I'd really love one of those.
 Like I'd really love to replace this mattress,
 to not be in pain at night, and to have a tough
 to needle specifically, because I just,
 I liked their website.
 Right.
 And then on Wednesday, we're in the factory for our regular meetings.
 And one of the guys from Lonely Planet came up and talked to me.
 And we'd met the, you know, this group of guys that all were for Lonely Planet, they
 came in December, early December.
 Yeah, our friend, Michaela, from Norway, not actually from Norway, American, but lives
 in Norway.
 Yes.
 of lots of our friends and
  </li><li>And her brother works there.
  </li><li>And her brother works for William Platt.
 So we met, we were having coffee with Michaela.
 Michaela's brother walks past
 and some of his colleagues got past
 and we get introduced to them.
  </li><li>Right, so one of his colleagues says to me,
 "Hey, I just thought of you the other day."
 And he said, "I have this mattress."
 And I was just wondering if you guys
 would know anybody that needs it.
 It's a king-size, tough-to-needle.
 And I was like, I think, I think I was in so much shock
 that I didn't really respond that well.
 I was like, okay, give me your number and I'll call you.
 So he, I gave him my phone, he put his number in
 and everything and I shot him in text.
  </li><li>So basically the story goes that he and his wife
 had ordered a mattress and two of them arrived at their house.
 And when they called the companies and said,
 "Hey, we've got two, how do we send this one back to you?"
 They just said, "Oh, give it to somebody."
 And he thought of you, which is somewhat random.
  </li><li>And that's what I said.
 When we were telling him the story,
 I was like, "It's so weird that you thought of me.
 "I've met you once."
 And it was like, six or eight weeks ago.
 And he's like, "Yeah, but you're who came to mind?"
 So I was like, "Jesus, you're so good."
  </li><li>So yesterday we borrowed Bill's truck.
 And with the help of some friends, managed to move it.
 And we now have a brand new mattress.
  </li><li>We do.
  </li><li>How excited are you?
  </li><li>I am super stoked.
 We slept on it last night and it's definitely much firmer than our previous mattress.
 Yeah, it's like sleeping on a giant block of cheddar cheese in that it has the...
 I don't understand.
 Kind of sweaty.
 Kind of.
 What do you mean?
 I mean, if you get a giant block of orange cheddar cheese, if you put your thumb in that,
 it will give, but not really.
 That's how firm that bet is.
 It's very firm.
 But apparently, it takes a couple of days to break in.
 Well, I think you're breaking yourself in and we've had such a previously soft, unsupported
 mattress that I think it's going to take us a couple days to get used to it.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 I'm so excited.
 You are very excited about it.
 Yes.
 I feel seen by the Lord.
 So there was our week, great week.
 Great week.
 Really glad to have lived it.
 Our main topic for this week is a topic that's so important that nobody really talks about.
 Okay.
 I realize people talk about it on the other side of it.
 People talk about it from a victory place rather than a hardship place.
 Right.
 I'm going through it and this is what it feels like.
 Right.
 Our topic this week is all about persevering.
 Yeah.
 You know, when we start talking about perseverance, it's important to note there are Christians
 facing genuine threats for their lives and horrible persecution for their faith.
 And it seems a little trite for us to be talking about the things that we're persevering in.
 Nevertheless, there are things that you and I and our listeners face every single day
 that we want to quit on.
 And quitting is actually the opposite of perseverance.
 Yep.
 So, perseverance is essentially just not giving up.
 Right.
 And if you read through scripture, God places a really high value on people who persevere.
 The good thing is it doesn't always say what you have to persevere in.
 No, there's no heads up on that.
 Yeah, our friend David Campbell said to us when we were pregnant with our first child,
 he said, "I'm sure everybody's giving you advice, but if I could just give you two pieces
 of advice," he said, "When they're new, you'll be like, 'Oh, they're so cute.
 I could just eat them up.'
 And when they're teenagers, you will have wished you had."
 He said, "When they get older, just remember one thing.
 The Bible says, 'Thou shalt not kill.'"
 And so there are different things that we're all persevering on.
 But basically, perseverance is simply not giving up.
 Yeah.
 It's the relentless attitude of showing up every day.
 And it's an absolutely essential life skill.
 Yes.
 Do you have any stories of times you had to persevere?
 Plenty, I think.
 I mean, I had to persevere through lots of sorrow and different seasons of my life.
 and still in the midst of mourning,
 believe that God is still good,
 that there's a light at the end of the rainbow,
 all that kind of stuff, you know,
 where it feels like, really,
 I feel like I'm in a dark tunnel.
  </li><li>Isn't it light at the end of a tunnel
 and a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow?
 I just don't want you to mix your amount of force.
  </li><li>Well, they understand.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>All those things, I could neither see pot nor rainbow.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>These were your drug days or?
 In fact, I remember Isabelle Ilem giving me a prophetic word about, I'm about to be able
 to see the light at the end of a tunnel.
 And the reason that was significant was the Lordhead.
 I was talking to the Lord about how I felt and I had a picture of me in a tunnel and
 I couldn't see anything.
 So it was really cool that she gave me that word.
 But yeah, I mean, and then also just working in different jobs where you know you're not
 in the job that you're called to or where you're going to end up, but it's where you
 are now.
 And there's levels of uncomfortableness and persecution.
 I mean, I serve tables for 14 years.
 So I mean, I loved it on some levels, but you are in an environment where it's pretty
 fierce, you know, people yell at each other, no problem, they're swearing.
 There's all kinds of stuff going on and...
  </li><li>Why don't you sexually abuse at work one day?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>No, the guy grabbed your bat.
  </li><li>No, he grabbed my front.
  </li><li>And what did you do?
  </li><li>I punched him in the face.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I love that story.
  </li><li>Yeah, but he went to punch me back and he was way bigger.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, so I mean, I had all kinds of stuff like that
 where you're like, okay, Lord, I know I'm called,
 What am I going to see that happen?
 Can you finish the guy that grabbed you and you punched him in the face story?
 Because people will probably be left wondering what happened.
 I think we've told that story before.
 Not in the podcast.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 Well, the background is he had grabbed several of the women at work before and kind of felt like he was allowed to do whatever he wanted because he was six foot four and real stand up.
 Go.
 Yeah.
 Awesome.
 So I told him if you ever touch me again, I was going to charge him and my,
 I had a letter like from a lawyer saying, you know, if you charge,
 if you touch her again, we're going to charge you and you know, whatever.
 And I'd given him that letter at the beginning of the shift.
 And so he came out to the front.
 I was hosting at this point and he grabbed my chest.
 So I put both my hands together and just swung up as hard as I couldn't
 and knocked him in the face.
 And then he went to punch me back,
 but a manager came around, had seen me punch him.
 That seemed like the whole thing.
 Him grabbed me, me punch him.
 And so he started running towards the front
 and he grabbed him and took him in the back.
 And then he fired him, but he waited by my car
 for three weeks.
 So every shift, I had to have at least two guys
 walk me out to my car, 'cause he waited by my car
 for three weeks.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 He was a real standup kind of guy.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
 I was so smart to punch him, not so much.
 He eventually came up though.
 Oh my gosh.
 I remember starting my postgraduate in teaching and I
 read and want to be a teacher.
 I'd felt like the Lord said go back to school and be a teacher
 and I was not thrilled with that premise.
 And so I obeyed the Lord and went there.
 But I remember within the first couple of weeks, I was just like, what am I doing?
 Like I'm facing a year of an uphill struggle of doing something.
 I'm not interested in.
 I'm not even sure I can do.
 I have no energy for, no passion for.
 And I remember I actually got quite sick and I was probably sick because of anxiety.
 And I remember I drove up to my parents house and one Sunday morning I got up very, very early
 and I drove up to my parents live on a hill and there's a beautiful graveyard.
 It's a park.
 There's some words you don't usually knit together.
 No, it's a beautiful graveyard.
 It's an enormous park built on a hill.
 It's not quite a mountain, but it's larger than what you would imagine a hill.
 Right. One side is parkland, the other side is a graveyard. And so it's obviously very peaceful,
 but it also faces the river where the sun was coming up. And so very early in the morning,
 I went up and just sat amongst the tombstones with my Bible and just said, "Lord, I need some
 encouragement. I don't know if I can do this." And I ended up reading through revelation,
 you know, in a graveyard reading revelation summed up my life.
 But remember all these things seven times it mentioned to him who overcomes Jesus said that
 he would give you a bunch of things if you'd overcome right and I was like, oh wow, I get to eat
 from a tree of life, not being hurt by the second death. What now I get hidden manna,
 I got a white stone with a new name, a authority over. I was like, this is amazing.
 Right. And I just said, you know, Lord, I feel like you called me to do this. I don't want to do
 it, but I'm going to be obedient. I'm going to need you to give me the strength to do it."
 You know, that in hindsight wasn't a huge thing, but it really was. And I'm fairly confident I
 wouldn't be who I am today or where I am today had I quit or dropped out. And just that encouragement
 from the Lord to keep going was huge. Right. And that, I mean, that's a really great example of
 pushing into Scripture and letting the Lord give you encouragement and an answer to help you keep
 going, isn't it? Yeah, it is. For anybody who's in a situation where you want to quit,
 and we've all been in situations where we're just like, "I am done." And that could be anything
 from a workplace. It could be even your marriage where you're just like, "Man, I am done being
 married. I really hope it's not." But we've walked through people and in our own lives,
 we've all faced situations where we're like, "Lord, I'm finding it difficult to endure
 X. We want to leave you with a couple of things of how to bolster yourself with power from God to
 endure whatever it is you're going through. Number one, AJ Jones. Find a different reason for showing
 up. If you're just showing up for promotion or out of duty or obligation or whatever, that's all
 going to wear you out thin. If you're showing up for the Lord, that's actually an incredible source
 of endurance for you. Like if you're like, okay, God has me here right at this very moment,
 and I'm going to be in the game as it were, and be present for the people that are here.
 That's actually a great sort of bolster for being where you are. And I would say that
 would be the thing that I did the most in all those different environments. It's like,
 okay, Lord, this is where you have me. What are we doing today? Because otherwise you
 you start to look at the details around you and you realize, "Gosh, this isn't the dream."
 It may not be the dream, but you might affect somebody else while you're there if you just
 would be in the game.
 It's back to that whole thing of "You've got to look past the immediate to see the important."
 Like what is God doing in this situation?
 Hebrews 12 or 7 says this, "Endure hardship is discipline."
 What's interesting is hardship, that translation there, hardship isn't in the Greek.
 Pomino is the word and it simply means to persevere. So it's saying, "Treat endurance as discipline."
 Basically, God is treating you as his child and it goes on and says, "For what children are not
 disciplined by the Father?" So the great thing is, whenever you're having to endure something,
 God is in the midst of it with you. As a father, he's watching you as a child face endurance.
 Hebrews 10 verse 36 says, "You need to persevere so that when you've done the will of God,
 you will receive what he has promised. I think we all love to receive what God promised. Some
 of us don't like to endure it long enough to get it. Oh yeah, for sure. And you have to think
 endurance always produces fruit. So pressing into God and enduring anything is always going
 to produce fruit in your life. And again, if you're in the game and you're saying, "Lord,
 while I'm here, what do you have for me to do?" You're also going to have the fruit of other
 people's lives changed. Right. Second thing, if you are needing a
 bolt of encouragement to endure is find a tribe to encourage you.
 You know, we were laughing with Passage F the other day about some of the stuff that we've just
 faced as a staff in the last couple of years. The, you know, pastoral situations or challenges
 and leadership where you're having to endure things and yet ironically, at the same time as
 as you're enduring really difficult things, there's incredible joy because of such
 camaraderie.
 Yeah.
 And our team at Grace and our artist, absolutely incredible.
 And if you can find genuine ways of laughing, even as bad as situations get, joy is great
 fuel for endurance.
 Yeah, sure is.
 Number three, strengthen yourself in the Lord.
 So that means more like find encouragement from testimonies or from others.
 There aren't any shortcuts for greatness.
 Greatness you earn greatness.
 You push in for right.
 And so recognize that you're in this thing for the long haul and pray and delight
 yourself in the Lord, like remind yourself, listen, other people's testimonies,
 let them encourage you.
 Listen to your own testimony of times that God has broken through for you and
 remind yourself, this is the God that you still serve.
 He knows where you are and he has GPS on you.
 and you have nothing to worry about.
 All you have to do is be the best you can at this very moment.
  </li><li>That's brilliant.
 One of Passagest great things is delay
 is one of God's most effective tools
 in his toolbox for developing character.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>God pushing delay on what you want and you persevering.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh. - Totally true.
  </li><li>So number four, this is the last thing I was thinking about
 and it sounds over simplistic,
 but simply show up and refuse to quit.
  </li><li>Yep.
 remember we were going through our RTF week, we'd gone away for a week of intense ministry.
 And I got to about halfway through the week and I just didn't want to cry anymore.
 I was, I just didn't want to go into a room and spend another three hours crying and dealing
 with all the stuff that, you know, I'd been so successful at pushing down and actually
 forgetting and not having to deal with.
 And I remember the Holy Spirit saying,
 "Ellen, if you will just physically show up,
 "if you will just move your body from the room that you're in
 "to the room where you need to be, I'll do the rest."
 And so I was like, "Okay, Lord, I'm not gonna shut down.
 "I'm absolutely gonna be willing.
 "I will position myself where I need to be."
 And sometimes physically showing up
 is one of the greatest keys to persevering.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I mean, I suppose when you get there,
 you can't just sit there like a lump
 if you're going to work, but--
  </li><li>Right.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>But getting there will help you actually get in the game.
  </li><li>Correct.
 I think what happens is we talk ourselves out with things.
 Like we think, I don't have passion for this.
 So then we begin to question,
 why don't I have passion for this?
 You don't have passion for this
 because life isn't made up of 100% passion.
  </li><li>Good heavens, no, I have no passion for cleaning
 or for changing diapers or for,
 but if I don't do those things, we're gonna be in trouble.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So stay where you are, keep showing up,
 keep getting out of bed, keep persevering.
 you'll see incredible things.
 Do you want to bonus thing?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I just realized that some prophetic words
 point to your next place of perseverance.
 Like we hear a prophetic word about,
 you know, God's going to promote us
 or this is going to come our way and we think,
 "da da!"
 But we actually realized he's told us the reward
 so that we can head towards it and endure what comes.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I don't have a theology that everything,
 you know, is hard work and you just have to
 grit your teeth and you know,
 That's not what life is about.
 Life is about walking with a heavenly Father who's good and who's kind and who never lets you go.
 But sometimes the terrain is a little rocker than we'd like.
 Yeah.
 And sometimes in life, hard work just is required.
 That's life.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 First Timothy 4 16 says this, what's your life and your doctrine closely persevere in them?
 Because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.
 And that's cool.
 Yeah.
 So my mom used to say, be careful little years, what you hear, be careful little eyes, what you see.
 And so watch your life, watch what's going into your life, watch what you're listening to,
 what you're reading, watch your doctrine really closely, persevere in the hard stuff.
 Don't create any theologies to explain difficult parts of God.
 Yeah.
 He's majestic and big.
 Yeah.
 And you're not going to understand everything he does.
 So don't minimize him.
 Yeah.
 All right, keep showing up. Perseverance isn't always easy, but its rewards are fantastic.
 Yeah, they are.
 You know what I want to do? I want to pray for everybody.
 Okay.
 So Holy Spirit, I just ask that right now, wherever our listeners are today, that you would fill them
 with your wonderful presence, that you would encourage them, that where they are right now
 is nearly a season. It's not the hallmark of the rest of their life, that you would give them
 perseverance, you'd give them a pioneering and a breakthrough spirit and that you would
 point them to the great reward that lies on the other side of perseverance.
 Yeah, Father, I also ask that you would just really show them that you know exactly where
 they are, that you haven't lost sight of them or their circumstances or the challenges that
 they have, that you would send little messages and little ways to make sure that they know,
 Hey, I've got this. I know you and we're going to come out the other side of this together.
