<p> I'm in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one seventy three of keeping up with the jones is worth this week we're talking about cultivating an exceptional spirit.
 But first,<br/>
 a j Jones tell me about your week was a good week I got a year older I was that few I was good I decided that this year I turned forty five again.
 Because last year I spent my birthday in the hospital and I didn't get to celebrate so i'm celebrating 45 this year but only 46 i am.
 I'm just gonna skip 46 and go straight to 47 next year i think it seems interesting theory okay so i'm 46 but.
 Yeah i'm celebrating both years yeah that's it and you had mam and papa and time mam and papa were here yeah it was so good.
 Was five glorious days it went by very quickly yeah with john and carol steamer the bespoke school supernatural life.
 And so that was the inevitable fun yes,
 but i think the thing you're super happy that was there in time for your birthday.
 Yeah and i think it's the first time i've actually.
 Like had my birthday dinner with them.
 On my birthday in probably.<br/>
 Two eleven years twelve years like that so.
 Mm-hmm. So that was really, it was super special.
 And I got to order some new clothes from the cap.
 Oh, you're so happy.<br/>
 Yes. And they arrived in the mail today.
 They did. So I came home to new clothes.
 I don't understand why you buy clothes via the mail.
 Well, I got one shirt that I really liked at the store,
 but they didn't have any more in my size.
 And so they said, you could see if they have any left online,
 which they did. And then it was on sale plus it was 40% off.
 So I was like a bonus.<br/>
 So I ordered them online.<br/>
 Look at you, little producer.<br/>
 And I don't like shopping anyway.<br/>
 So find out my size.<br/>
 I'd much rather just buy it online and not have to go to them all.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I'm with you.<br/>
 I try and do shopping like what once a year.
 Yeah.<br/>
 If you have to.<br/>
 Well, my clothes were out.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 Well, that's what happened.<br/>
 I had three pairs of jeans, all burst holes in them all in one week.
 So, but I mean, I haven't bought jeans in a couple of years.
 So there you go.<br/>
 But no wonder because you buy a bunch of jeans at the same time.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I find a pair of jeans that fit by two pairs.
 That doesn't mean a year.<br/>
 But these, this is my last pair.<br/>
 They're, they're, we'd probably use by more expensive jeans if we're going through
 them in a year.<br/>
 I wonder if we're strange creatures.<br/>
 Like I wonder if other people live like that or if it's just us.
 I think it's, you know, there's people who probably treat their iPhones.
 Like I treat my jeans in that they just buy an iPhone, they use it and
 wears out, they'll get a new one.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Whereas I get a new iPhone every year because that's why I'm interested.
 There'll be people who are interested in fashion and so they buy clothes like maybe every season.
 Whereas I just make sure all vital parts of my anatomy are covered and then we're good to go.
 Yeah, I think the world is thankful.<br/>
 So yeah, I got to get some clothes, so that was exciting.
 That was Monday, Tuesday.<br/>
 Monday, Tuesday.<br/>
 They flew out Wednesday and we had a couple of birthday dinners.
 We got to celebrate with John and Cara, got to celebrate with the kids.
 Yes, that was really fun.<br/>
 The kids could not understand why we were having a birthday celebration without them.
 No, poor duckies.<br/>
 They looked shocked, but they go over it.
 They did.<br/>
 Well, Cheesecake makes you get over things.
 Oh, it does.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then this weekend, we're in St. Louis for a youth retreat.
 Yes.<br/>
 The difference being this one, we tried something different.
 Normally, when we're ministering, like, I'll go away and you stay home with
 the kids or you go away and I stay home with the kids.
 This time, the church was very kind and said, why don't you actually bring your whole family?
 So we did.<br/>
 How do you think that went?<br/>
 I think it went really well.<br/>
 I think the kids loved it.<br/>
 So they gave us a nice cabin that had three bedrooms and so that, you know,
 everybody got to go to bed at the right times and all that kind of stuff.
 But there was parks at this camp.<br/>
 So then an indoor pool.<br/>
 So they had a good time.<br/>
 That's the winner for them.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It was a little distracting for me because usually when I go away, I'm just in the zone.
 And then when I come home, I'm out of the zone and I'm bad being a dad.
 It was weird this weekend because, you know, at lunch times and dinner times,
 I was having lunch and dinner with you guys rather than with all the people I'm trying
 to connect with.<br/>
 To be honest, we just got a car.<br/>
 We literally just literally...<br/>
 Literally.<br/>
 We got home at Chipotle, put the kids to bed, and they're recording a podcast.
 So my conan player hasn't had time to think, but they were amazing.
 They were...<br/>
 Yeah, they were great.<br/>
 It was like five and a half hours in the car.
 It is, but again, they did great in the car, and there's probably something nice for them
 and every once in a while seeing what it is that we do.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I mean, Abby was riveted this morning.
 I mean, the two little guys just played on their iPad at the back of the sanctuary,
 but Abby was just listening everywhere that you said.
 Well, they had a great speaker this morning, so that makes sense.
 Yeah, I mean, so handsome too.<br/>
 Stop, oh, stop.<br/>
 And shock exclusive.<br/>
 This was the first week in September that we haven't either of us have been teaching at school.
 I know it was so strange.<br/>
 Yeah, it was really surreal.<br/>
 Yeah, kind of nice though.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 But throws you for the look.<br/>
 Does.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Well, our main topic for this week is this kind of like strange title of living with an exceptional spirit.
 So what are we talking about again?<br/>
 Well, it's really more of a discussion.
 Normally when we come to talk on the podcast, we actually know what we're talking about.
 Yes.<br/>
 But this is a thought I've been thinking about.
 I mean, having a number of thoughts around the topics associated with having an exceptional spirit.
 But I haven't actually thought about the topic in hand.
 So this is kind of like thoughts off the top of my head.
 Okay.<br/>
 Buckle up.<br/>
 Oh, dear.<br/>
 So it started this week, babe, with John and Carol Pegan Town, the four of us.
 We were all talking about a mutual friend of ours.
 Yes.<br/>
 And as we were talking about this person, we all remarked on like how exceptional
 this person was.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And it just got me thinking about that person and I'm thinking, how do you end up like
 that?<br/>
 And then this weekend, as I've been dialoguing with the Lord,
 The Lord was talking to me about how that quality that I so admire in this person is
 actually in all of us, but we need to learn to live toward it.
 Right.<br/>
 So that's good thinking.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Stay with me on this thought then, right?
 If the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is living inside of us, how much more
 of an exceptional spirit can we actually have?
 Mike drop.<br/>
 If these weren't hanging from this thing, I would drop it on the floor.
 I mean, I know it's expensive and everything, but I would.
 That was great.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 But I'm thinking we can't have a more<br/>
 exceptional spirit than the Holy Spirit.
 So why is this friend that we're thinking about?
 You know, the quality of their life is, I don't mean the quality of their life
 by like the luxury they live in.<br/>
 That's not what I'm talking about.<br/>
 I mean, they're, they're approached to life is way more excellent than our approach to life.
 Wouldn't you say?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So I'm thinking like why?<br/>
 I started thinking about, I wonder if the answer to that question is directly related
 to how much we yield our life to the Holy Spirit.
 I mean, probably it can't just be how many vegetables you eat or anything like that.
 It's got to actually have something to do with the Holy Spirit, isn't it?
 Right. Well, we're told to walk with the spirit.
 And I think if you look at the seasons of your life where you're most committed to
 of being the Holy Spirit. Your life is marked by this characteristic of, of excellence and
 diligence and godliness. Right? Yes. But I also realize I can choose to ignore the Holy
 Spirit. It's not just that the Holy Spirit's in me. I actually have to partner with him.
 Yes, every day. So I think I get lazy and maybe I only partly obey the Holy Spirit.
 I think that's probably right. Maybe I think we all did that.
 Right. So I started thinking, what would it look like if we yielded ourselves fully to the Holy
 Spirit's wisdom? It probably looked like our friend. Right. So here's the thing. I know only a
 handful of people who I would say are living with what I would call an exceptional spirit,
 where this fruit of a life lived with God has produced the quality of life I would love to have.
 That don't get me wrong, I know lots of people who live in obedience to God,
 But i've realized if we're not careful we can set the parameters where we allow the holy spirit to lead us.
 So for example i'm fine for the holy spirit to lead me in what should i preach on monday night at emonay right but i don't think to consult the holy spirit what should i watch on tuesday night.
 When comes to tv right now i'm not trying to make this all legalistic i'm just giving you an example there that there are probably very conscious areas of our life that we yield to the holy spirit.
 Right as opposed to every single area right and there's probably other areas where it's not that we need to yield this air to the Holy Spirit
 It's that are we even open to inquiring about the Holy Spirit's perspective on that?
 So for example just outing myself here
 I think the Holy Spirit would probably have a lot to say to me if I chose to listen to him about the rewards of physical exercise
 Yes, but because I'm really not interested in that I
 I don't bother asking him and then I'm reaping the effects of that in my life.
 Right.<br/>
 And so I just started thinking, wait, what are the pockets of my life that I
 allow the Holy Spirit influence in?<br/>
 And am I seeing corresponding benefit in that?
 And the answer is yes.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 So then I think, why don't I actually yield all of my life?
 And I thought I had till I started thinking about this, but I mean practically.
 Yes.<br/>
 So anyway, that's the main gist of my thoughts as we can.
 What would it look like?<br/>
 What kind of fruit would we produce if we were fully yielded to God?
 And and how does one become that?<br/>
 Listen to this description in Daniel, because if ever there was somebody
 with an exceptional spirit, it would be Daniel.
 So this is the context here is this is the passage of a motor
 read is about the third king that Daniel served.
 Nebuchadnezzar was the first, then Nebuchadnezzar, some Balschasar,
 then Balschasar gets killed by Darius, the Mede,
 which is a great Instagram handle, by the way.
 So there is the meat kills Belchasar, takes over the kingdom, rather than reinventing the wheel,
 takes 120 of the brightest leaders, puts them in charge, and then sets 3 brilliant people over the 120 people.
 Right? Daniel is one of those top three. He's literally the top three of the whole country.
 Right.<br/>
 And yet look at what scripture says about him.
 It says this is Daniel 6 verse 3.<br/>
 Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps
 by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom.
 At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel
 in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so.
 They could find no corruption in him because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent.
</p><ul>
  <li>Ma'am. - That's what I'm talking about.
 I don't think that Daniel's excellence just applied to his job.
 i bet if you went and stayed with daniel for a weekend i bet you his home life reflected that same sort of exceptional spirit.
 Oh yeah i'm sure i don't think you can turn that on and off right and i also don't think.
 That daniel was a type of person i can't prove this in scripture but i don't think daniel woke up in the morning like you know what i'm going to be better than all the hundred twenty two top people i just think he.
 so lived a life yielded to God that the byproduct of it was living an exceptional life right and surely living an exceptional life also.
 Attracts the favor of God yeah, I bet because because God is wise in a stewardship yeah and so if you think about the parable of the talents you know that the one who had 10 talents and.
 you invested he was like well done good and faithful servant and there was the five and there was the one that did nothing with it that was given to the other guy and so.
 Yeah so i'm now like okay what does this mean for me what does this mean for us how can we be exceptional.
 So when you're talking about that i was thinking about the song that's been playing in my head in my spirit like for the last week.
 Black and Black by AC DC. No, that's not the one. I'm close though. Just a little bit different. It's actually
 I think it's called so will I by Hillsong United
 Can I read you a couple of the the lyrics?
 So I like that it there's a whole bunch of things that it covers one thing is sort of the bigness of God, but the second
 verses. And as you speak, a hundred billion galaxies are born in the vapor of your breath,
 the planets form. If the stars were made to worship, so will I. I can see your heart in everything
 you've made, every burning star, a single fire of grace. If creation sings your praises, so will I.
 And it keeps like it goes through all the different things that God has done. Like it says, and as
 As you speak, 100 billion creatures catch your breath, evolving in pursuit of what you said,
 if it all reveals your nature, so will I.
 I can see your heart in everything you say, every painted sky, a canvas of your grace,
 if creation still obeys you, so will I.
 And so just keeps going through like all the different things of, you know, creation and
 just saying, I'm going to choose to exalt you.
 I'm going to choose to worship you.
 I'm going to choose to obey you.
 I'm going to choose to be laid down for you.
 And it's just been hitting my spirit.
 Like it's, it's just, it's an amazing song, but you can't miss the
 bigness of God.
 I don't know.
 Like I, I get so distracted when it comes on because like my spirit is listening.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Yeah.
 I've noticed that you've been playing it on stop.
 You know, it says stuff like if everything exists to lift you high, so will I.
 And, you know, if the wind still obey you, so will I.
 And in just, and so I've just been like, Oh God, like again, sort of the same thing
 as what you're saying earlier, like what parts of my life don't reflect that I belong to you?
 Hmm.
 You know, what parts of my life, am I still living like it belongs to me?
 It's a fascinating concept, doesn't it?
 Yeah.
 Because I think, I mean, prior to me thinking this, I thought I was yielded to God.
 Right.
 But I'm realizing there's just areas I've given them attention to.
 I'm sure the Lord loved to speak into every area.
 Yeah.
 I just wanted to read you one more little snippet of it.
 It says, and as you speak, a hundred billion failures disappear where you lost
 your life so I could find it here.
 If you left the grave behind you, so will I.
 Oh, I love that line.
 I know.
 It's just like, whoa.
 So it's just, it's beautiful because it's a song of surrender and worship, but it's a song that's
 so full of the truth of his pursuit of us and our ability and an invitation to respond,
 which I think, you know, when you talk about our friend or you talk about
 our, you know, the five people you can think of that live from that fullness, I think they've
 probably accepted the invitation, you know. Yeah, I was trying to think about flashing this thing
 out because to say someone has an exceptional spirit isn't that helpful. And I was thinking,
 I was just thinking of some other examples in the Bible, like Solomon was another one,
 well, until he screwed up. But like when the Queen of Sheba heard about Solomon's fame,
 she comes to him. Listen to her reaction. This is from 1 Kings 10. It says, "When the Queen of
 Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, which brought honor to the name of the Lord, she came to test
 with hard questions. When she met with Solomon, she talked to him about everything she had
 in her mind. Solomon had answers for all her questions, nothing was too hard for the king
 to explain to her. When the Queen of Sheba realised how very wise Solomon was, and when
 she saw the palace he had built, she was overwhelmed. She was also amazed that the food
 on his table is the organisation of his officials. And their splendid clothing, the cupbearers
 and the burnt offering Solomon made at the temple of the Lord. She exclaimed to the king,
 everything I heard in my country about your achievements and wisdom is true.
 I didn't believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes.
 In fact, I had not heard the half of it, your wisdom and prosperity are far beyond
 what I was told. And so I was thinking like, okay, she's a queen.
 She's royalty.
 She's already used to royal splendor. Yeah.
 Like I can imagine me going and going, holy mother of pearls, this place is enormous.
 Right. But she's a queen of sheep. Right.
 And she's astonished, not just as wisdom,
 but she's also astonished at the stuff
 that should be normal to her.
 Like the palace sounds palace, it says,
 caused her to be overwhelmed.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I was thinking about that.
 I was like somebody who owns a palace
 shouldn't be overwhelmed by somebody else's palace.
 The food he provided for her amazed her.
 The organization of his officials amazed her,
 as did their uniforms.
 I'm thinking this whole topic
 of having an exceptional spirit overflows into everything around you.
 Yes.
 But I also think quite a few of the things that probably would have been the
 overwhelming things for her were actually things that, that were designed by God.
 If it were like, Hey, do this like this.
 Right.
 And when we do this like this, it ends up having the effect it's supposed to have, you
 know, so it's, it's getting the blueprints from God for whatever things are,
 things that he places in our hands and doing them like that so that the world notices that
 something's different.
 I think we touch parts of the exceptional spirit when we're around people who are gifted
 in their area of expertise.
 So if you're ever around a skilled musician or an amazing artist or a brilliant cook or
 whatever, that is them in their gifting.
 not necessarily them with an exceptional spirit, but the same way that you see their brilliance
 manifest in that one area, when we let that brilliance, I think affect our whole life,
 then we're walking with an exceptional spirit. I really don't know what I'm talking about other
 than these are like my first thoughts on this topic. They're pondering. We'll probably have
 to revisit this at some point. I think some of the hallmarks of someone with an exceptional spirit
 it would be just looking at say Daniel and Solomon, for example.
 I'd say they lead well.
 Yes.
 And they have wisdom that is staggering.
 Yeah.
 I mean, that's true.
 Those guys, their wisdom was astonishing.
 Yeah.
 What about them?
 They're not just stewards.
 They're excellent stewards.
 Like everything is managed well.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And excellence is really synonymous with everything that they do, isn't it?
 Right.
 So the huge value for quality.
 There's this whole aspect of intentionality and thoroughness.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I was even thinking, you know, you're, you're speaking of, of Daniel and
 Solomon, but I was even thinking about Joseph, like he would have been exceptional
 as well.
 And I think with all of those guys, they navigated super difficult things and kept
 their hearts turned toward the, the Lord instead of getting bitter.
 Yeah.
 That's, that's interesting.
 I was thinking that people with an excellent spirit
 don't lower their standards because of the climate.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right, they're consistent in who they are
 when no one's looking.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So there you go.
 I mean, I'm inspired.
 I feel like the Lord's leaving breadcrumbs
 for me to think about and meditate on this whole topic.
 And I'm like, Lord, I want, I want, I want, at the end
 of my life to be considered as someone
 who had an excellent spirit.
 Like, I know that's gonna take years to cultivate,
 But that's something I would love to learn more about and surround myself with people
 of an exceptional spirit and begin to think like that.
 Think about Jesus.
 I mean, if anybody is the benchmark of a man with an exceptional spirit, it's Jesus.
 Yes, good point.
 But think about the first coming of Jesus.
 He came in meekness, right?
 Didn't come in splendor was born in a stable in an obscure town and an obscure country
 Didn't didn't raise his voice didn't draw attention to himself didn't post
 Access none of the splendor that was his you know he could have called on all these angels
 but didn't and I think like some of the world missed him because of that yeah, but those of us who know him and
 realize he just walked in humility. When he comes for a second time, we're going to understand that
 his deliberate choice to come in meekness the first time is actually just a reflection of his
 heart. We'll see him in glory and in splendor, but we'll remember that he chose meekness the first
 time he came. I think humility is such a key part of having an exceptional spirit.
 Well, interestingly enough, when you talk about our friend and a couple of others that you can
 think of, all of them, I would say, are totally marked by meekness and humility.
 And by that, I would say that when you interact with them, it's like an iceberg.
 As in the bit that you see of their life is like you're impressed by, but actually the meat of who they are.
 Yes, there's a well hidden.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's, it's, yeah, it's a different way of living.
 So anyway, I hope our rambling tonight is of some inspiration.
 If you have any thoughts on that, please shoot us an email.
 Or books or people you know who you would count us having an excellent spirit.
 We'd love to know about it and love to hear more.
 Well, babe, it sounds like you have a sermon brewing.
 Well, I hope so.
 It's the stuff that's been on my mind all weekend.
 I've been pondering it and I really want to learn more.
 Yeah, but wrap is up, baby.
 All right.
 Um, what could I let you know?
 I know the School of Supernatural Life has their applications open now for next year.
 So that would be school starting in September 2018.
 I know we already have a bunch of applications.
 I'm super excited.
 I love it.
 I know.
 So exciting.
 So yes, both year one and year two applications are open and we would love to hear from you.
 To apply you would go to greycenter.us/school.
 You can see all the information there and there's videos and stuff like that.
 So if you have no idea what we're talking about, but your heart just leapt in your
 chest while we were just mentioning it, go ahead and go over to the website and you can
 get all the information you need and all the dates that you need.
 But also there's some lovely testimonial videos and stuff like that.
 Yeah.
 And with Chris was coming up, I want to recommend A.G.'s book called Finding Father.
 It's a 12 week devotional study that you work through every day.
 It is a fairly big book, but it has a little section that you read every single day with
 activations to do each week, and it's completely designed to take you into close relationship
 with God.
 There are a ton of five-star reviews on Amazon.
 It's changed lives all over the world.
 We meet people all the time who are like, "Oh my gosh, I read your book.
 I totally changed my life."
 And if you've already read it, you know what a life-changing resource it is.
 Why not pick up some copies for some of your loved ones?
