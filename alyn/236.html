<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end an AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 236 of Keeping Up with the Joneses.
  </li><li>Time for our weekly catch up.
  </li><li>Yes, what do you wanna catch up about?
  </li><li>Well, I'm weak ostensibly,
 but I know what you wanna catch us up on.
 Do you wanna start with them?
  </li><li>The Great Bath Debate?
  </li><li>Well, I was gonna phrase it as the great smearing
 of my name and healthy practice.
 We're gone.
 You can't smear another person's name with truth.
 OK, if you're just joining us on the Great Bath debate,
 Asia has such a strange reaction to the way I have a bath.
 OK, I am OK.
 I run a hot bath.
 I have a bath and I eventually go to the bath.
 No, no, no, no.
 OK, folks, if you missed it somehow on the podcast that we talked about it,
 that's not accurate to what you do.
 You have a bath.
 That's true.
 and watch your videos in the bath.
 And then you pull the plug,
 stay in the bath while it's draining,
 then continue to sit there in a cold, damp, wet environment
 until you air dry and then you get out of the bath.
  </li><li>Like a boss.
 Do you wanna talk about the results
 or should I talk about some of the feedback that we got?
  </li><li>Well, are you gonna make up feedback?
 I think you look like you are up to something over there,
 Mr. G
  </li><li>I'm going to get feedback sent in from our members.
  </li><li>Oh, well-- - So these are committed people
 who are invested in the podcast.
  </li><li>Well, let's talk about the overall results of,
 I did a survey.
  </li><li>Well, let's not go there just yet.
  </li><li>Because it doesn't look good for you.
  </li><li>Okay, go ahead, give me the feedback.
  </li><li>Okay, so, you know, just to be a representative
 of both sides of the argument,
 Shannon wrote and clearly she was deluded at the time,
 but she said, "Alan, you're insane.
 "Air drying has to be the least efficient way to get dry
 and you end up freezing in the process.
 Don't you sit in the tub long enough for the water to get lukewarm anyway?
 Your body would have already adjusted to now colder water and would want a towel ASAP.
 Thank you!
 Your method...
 Thank you, Shannon!
 Your method sounds more like a weird version of self-flagellation.
 Jesus sets you free, dude.
 Well...
 Shannon!
 Shannon, you're on to something.
 Shannon, like you, is mistaken about a number of steps in the process
 Because of course I don't sit in a tub until it gets lukewarm.
 Haven't you read the book of Revelation?
 I wish you were either hot or cold because your lukewarm will spit you out in the mouth.
 Lukewarm is the worst situation to be.
 And so I never let the water get lukewarm.
 Oh.
 I stay in the water until it's really, really hot.
 And then I let it out and it slowly drains.
 I had to say, I don't think that that's accurate.
 Your process is wrong.
 OK, a much more representative comment, which I think is very well-balanced,
 comes from Mr. Will, who said,
 I also enjoy letting the water drain before I get out when I have a bath.
 My question is, who doesn't like that AJ?
 It's the only way to get the full experience out of bath time, you bath time peasant.
 Oh my goodness.
 Okay, first of all, I will take you down.
 A well-balanced response and a nation divided.
 No, no, but this actually reinforces my current theory, which is because when we shared this on the podcast,
 of course, Chris, who edits a podcast for us, said he also does that.
 And now Will, who is his brother, also says that he does that.
 And here is my theory.
 Maybe it's a British thing.
 It is a British man thing.
 And it's because y'all are used to being cold and wet for no good reason because you
 don't eat your houses properly either.
 And so you think, oh, this is just, I mean, this is an appropriate way to live.
 And you don't realize that the civilized world has advanced beyond.
 Do you want to talk about the Instagram results?
 The sort of environment.
 Which I feel like I was robbed in.
 Well, you weren't robbed.
 I was vindicated.
  </li><li>I was.
  </li><li>Yes, so I did a poll on Instagram.
 Hasn't even been 24 hours yet.
 211 people have responded already.
  </li><li>Which is my first qualm.
 It's 211 people, it's not a large sample size.
 Statistically invalid.
  </li><li>Oh, really?
  </li><li>Yeah, we should get George.
  </li><li>Except that if it was going in your direction,
 it would be like.
  </li><li>No, no, no, we don't know that, Dari.
  </li><li>Yes, we do.
  </li><li>Oh, we know this.
  </li><li>For sure.
  </li><li>First of all, your sample size is tiny.
 So statistically. Okay. Okay.
 Second of all, your questions were so loaded that I don't think we, you know,
 we got an accurate representation of the truth, but nevertheless,
 you're right. 82% of people said I was odd. Yes.
 82% darling. And then the remainder, however many
 remainder, I'm pretty sure are lighted and righteous and wise.
 So their end is the great bath debate of 2021. And I won. Okay.
 What else happened this week?
 What else happened this week?
 I still have that song in my head that I can't get out of my head.
 Tell us the song.
 Um, I think it's by Katy Perry and I don't know.
 It's not by Katy Perry.
 Oh, isn't it?
 It's about fish.
 It's also not about fish.
 You sing.
 Don't be afraid to catch fish.
 Okay.
 And so then I will send a sample that Chris can edit in.
 Okay.
 Chris, play that clip.

 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Don't be afraid to catch fish &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Run your cup and chase the &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
  </li><li>And you'll see that she doesn't talk about fishing at all.
  </li><li>It's a, it sounds like she's talking about fish
 and not being afraid to catch fish.
  </li><li>Maybe she baths the wrong way too.
  </li><li>And then she says fish with me.
  </li><li>Fish with you, okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>A couple of years ago, for our members,
 we released a genius moment of AJ sound checking,
 hip-hopping, hip-hop rapping, which was about a spectacular
 silence. It was an unknown gift. But our different
 Kate who lives with us said, "Hey, you know, maybe you should offer a bonus
 extra of AJ singing contemporary versions of songs that she thinks."
 And I don't know if that's a good idea or a bad idea, but... I admit that I have
 some songs like "Ice Ice Baby" where perhaps I don't actually know the words
 and so I have my own... There's no perhaps about a bit. I've shown you the lyrics
 the vanilla ice. I'm telling you the lyrics that I sing we're in there at some point. Yeah, maybe only in Canada. You're adorable. I know the Canadian version.
 All right. What else happened this week? Give me my misery. I'm trying to think it's what you have graduation. Yeah, I was trying to feed you that line. I know. I'm I think I'm still my heart is in recovery. I can't believe the year. The year both went slow and really fast.
 And it went slow because of just how much content we were trying to film and the
 extra effort in that. You know, it felt pretty exhausting just week after week after week of
 filming. Yep. And and running different schedules like, you know, you're filming one thing one week,
 you're you're commenting on comments on the school from something previous. And then you're
 having a live call from something different. So it was like you're, you're always living
 in three different weeks worth of content for eight months. Well, across three different
 years. Yes, felt intense. But a big congratulations to all of our students who graduated like,
 well done on pivoting with us. Amazing that they signed up for one thing. And then the
 last minute we changed the school to an online school only, which had, you know, pros and
 cons, the pros were we got to have students from all over the world, which we've had before,
 but they didn't have to leave their country.
 They could work on it.
 One of the funny feedbacks was the student saying,
 I was really grateful for having a pause button this year
 where I could pause, take notes, continue,
 or if you said something that I didn't understand,
 I could rewind it.
 And I was like, yes, a live DVR.
  </li><li>And specifically people mentioned you,
 like a pause button to use when Alan was speaking
 'cause Alan gets excited and then he speaks like super fast.
  </li><li>You probably haven't noticed that.
  </li><li>And then we would always have on,
 like in the live school people would say,
  </li><li>What did you say?
  </li><li>Wait, what did you say?
 Or could you repeat that in half the time?
 Not half the time, but quite often I'll be like,
 "Oh, actually I don't know what I just said."
 And you know, so yeah, they loved the feature
 of being able to pause Alan or even slow him down
 on the actual listening.
  </li><li>Yeah, one student said, "I listen to every teacher
 "like 1.75 or two times, and with you,
 "I dropped it to 0.75."
 So I don't know if that was good or bad,
 whether that was my accent or whether that was my speed.
 I don't think you have an accent anymore, darling.
  </li><li>It's great to be.
  </li><li>It's not really, it's gone.
 False advertising.
  </li><li>I think you did an amazing job.
 You pivoted brilliantly, darling.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>And your team did a phenomenal job
 in making that happen,
 so thank you to everybody who's doing that.
 This year you're running the school again online?
  </li><li>Yes, both.
  </li><li>Yes, both online and in person.
 So we will have an on-campus,
 which is traditionally how we've run the school
 for the previous nine years,
 but then we'll also be running it online.
 So we'll have those.
  </li><li>And that's for all three years.
  </li><li>All three years.
  </li><li>Yeah, so if you've done the school.
  </li><li>Well, that is not accurate.
  </li><li>Oh, why not do you, son?
  </li><li>You cannot do year three online.
 Year three is only offered on campus.
  </li><li>So if you've done year one
 and you wanna come back for year two,
 you can do it online or in person.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And year one, if you're listening to this
 and you would love to get more of God,
 you would love to get transformation for your life,
 Go and look at grace.net.us/school
 to learn all about the school of supernatural life.
  </li><li>Yeah, you won't regret it, it's great.
  </li><li>Anything else this week, I mean, graduation,
 you were wrong about the bad thing.
 That's a big recap.
  </li><li>You may have put in a mistruth in there, sir,
 where I was not wrong about the bad thing.
  </li><li>We'll never know.
  </li><li>I've also, you're gonna single-dad it
 for a couple, for five days.
  </li><li>Is it five days?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yes, I'm going to the beach.
 You are going to the beach.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Have fun, darling.
  </li><li>Yes.
 I'll send you videos of the beach.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't wanna know them.
 I don't wanna know about it.
  </li><li>All right, so we're gonna be talking
 about boundaries this week.
 And this topic actually comes from that crowdsourcing list
 that you did.
  </li><li>That's a very generous way of putting it.
 Yeah, it was my lazy market research.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I realized it was genius because not only did I get
 a wealth of topics, I put out on Instagram, you know,
 if I was to write a book, what would you wanna read a book
 about?
 And people gave me a bunch of topics.
 like, "Well, I'm not going to write a book right now, but this has given us the next couple
 of months of podcast topics."
 Right.
 But here's what else I can do is I can gauge not only market research, what are people
 interested in, but market response, because we can see how many people download the podcast
 by topic.
 Oh, that's clever.
 I know.
 So I'm like, "Okay, yeah, this is great.
 The double win."
 Dual win, yeah.
 So we are talking about boundaries, but what's funny, that was on the list, but also simultaneously,
 for the last couple of months,
 I've been hard at work with Mr. Chris
 in our studio recording,
 I don't wanna make it too big,
 but literally it's the ultimate boundaries course
 that I can create.
 Like I-- - That was so funny.
 I don't wanna make it too big,
 but literally it's the ultimate boundaries course.
  </li><li>I don't know how-- - They ultimate.
  </li><li>I don't know how to make a more thorough video course
 about boundaries.
 I've brought my A-game,
 I brought everything I know about boundaries,
 including stuff that I teach in disparate years.
 Like the stuff I have never taught
 as part of my boundaries teaching
 that I include on this boundaries course.
 So behind the scenes, last couple of months,
 I've been working really hard on producing material.
 It's now finished.
 We're gonna talk about the boundaries course later.
 But because I've been working on all the boundary stuff,
 it's fresh in my head.
 So when I was looking at the list,
 what do you wanna talk about this week?
 I was like, let's talk about boundaries.
  </li><li>I love that your accent just came out
 for a split second there when you said thorough.
  </li><li>Thorough. - That said a thorough.
  </li><li>Oh. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Very good. - The thorough.
  </li><li>Boundaries, I was thinking last night
 when I went to bed, I was thinking about recording
 the podcast today and I had that thing
 that I often have when I'm falling asleep.
 I see myself speaking or recording a podcast
 and I just, I watch and I think,
 "Oh, that's a great point, I'll make that point."
 I was thinking about, I was gonna tell how I first
 counter boundaries and why I hated it. I mean, I think our title for this week is Boundary's
 Blessing or Abomination.
 Is that a title?
 And I think it is like I wrote it down.
 Is that what we're calling it?
 I mean, yeah, boundaries, brilliant or abominable.
 So I was thinking about the why was it such an abominable topic to me when I first heard it?
 And I'm kind of stealing from my story.
 But we need to think a little bit about how we are raised.
 So bear with me while I do a little bit of childhood development.
 It's all the psychology. Oh, excellent. Yes.
 But when you're born, when you're a child, you are utterly helpless.
 You can't do anything and you're very small and you need your mom and your
 dad to care for you. And that bonding experience, the co-regulation,
 where you're in distress, you need fed, you need change, you need to be put to
 bed, you need to be cared for that co-regulation, where your parents soothe
 you, you know, you're crying and somebody comes along and feeds you or
 talks to you or nurtures you, that is essential, right?
 That's a really, really healthy part of growing up.
 A baby and infant is supposed to require co-regulation from their parent.
 But just take, you know, as you get older and older and older and you reach adulthood,
 you, a healthy adult does not need that.
 Right. You're not doing skin on skin cuddles anymore at that point.
 That's awkward and weird.
 I don't need you to come like my butt.
 Right. Right. Yeah. You advanced.
 You've differentiated.
 You realize, okay, in order to feel safe, I needed this.
 And now that I'm an adult, I can feel safe being differentiated
 from other people.
  </li><li>Yes, good.
  </li><li>And there's, you know, there's several stages of development
 where that process of learning to leave the kind of
 co-regulate stage and move to, I am a differentiated adult
 and I'm okay that I'm different.
 But one of those stages, people talk about the terrible twos
 is individuation around two years old, the child learns like I can use the magic word
 no.
 Oh, it's a great word.
 And depending on what your family environment was like, whether you're no was respected
 or you're no was honored, that sets up in motion a bunch of behavior.
 I remember he listened to one that was an inner healing person.
 And I think it was John Sanford, one of the grandfathers of the inner healing movement.
 And he was saying that his experience, people who end up having midlife crisis is crises.
 People who end up having a midlife crisis.
 Often they found that they weren't allowed to individual when they were two.
 There was no one answered.
 And so they put up, put up, put up, blow up.
 Like, I want to be my own person.
 So they, you know, have an affair or, you know, buy Harley Davidson or make some a rash
 decision because they want their freedom.
 Right.
 Because freedom is, you know, what we're created for.
 So I don't know why I was thinking about that last night, but I was thinking about that
 process and the oh, here's why I was thinking about it.
 Because we make meaning out of the environment we're raised in.
 So whatever we were raised with becomes our norm.
 So the behavior that we experience, the home life that we have, that is normal.
 And we assume that everybody's houses like this until we encounter somebody else and
 be like, wow, your family so odd.
 They don't do things.
 Right.
 And really we're saying our normals are completely different.
 normal for completely different, but we don't know it yet. Yes. So that normal process going
 from co-regulation to differentiation, differentiation, you know, and individually, at one point,
 understanding I'm okay to be my own person. And I have my own responsibilities can largely be
 summarized as I remember Chip, who I'm going to talk about in a second, he said a good parent
 trains their children to no longer need them. So it's good parenting, like as you get older and
 older and older, your parents teach you about responsibility and hand more and more over
 over to you so that as you become an adult, you learn to be an independent, fully functioning
 adult. It doesn't mean you don't need anything. That's not the point. But the point is you
 learn to identify that I am myself and these are the things I need to take responsibility
 for. Along the way, however, if there's any trauma, and when we talk about trauma, there's
 big tea trauma, you know, plane crash, bombs, terrorist attack. There's also little tea
 trauma, which could be a variety of things. The body doesn't really differentiate between
 big tea and small tea. Like when we have trauma. So one sort of trauma could be nervous parents
 have difficulty co-regulating a child. Okay. So the child needs to be cared for. The parent is
 nervous, you know, frantic, they're not doing it right. The limbic resonance between what the
 the mom is feeling and what the baby is feeling,
 which if not communicated verbally,
 is picked up by the child and it gets a feeling of like,
 "I'm not okay."
 That's true. - I'm not safe.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>When we are growing up and we have a fear
 that we could be abandoned or rejected,
 which is two major roots of trauma,
 we begin this new cycle that is almost automatic
 where we begin to monitor the faces
 everybody who's important in our life to make sure that they're okay. So I'm okay.
 Yes. And instead of co-regulation, we end up in codependency.
 Right. And codependency, I heard Stephen James, who's one of the therapists at
 St. Shelley said this brilliant description of codependency, which I love.
 He said codependency is saying whatever you have to say or doing whatever you
 have to do to not be rejected. So when you're codependent, you can't be your
 own person because it's scary out there and I need you to need me so that we're okay and so I
 will never feel alone. So I was beginning to think about like why did I have such a strong
 reaction to hearing boundaries? And it's because the environment I grew up in, a lot of what was
 demonstrated to me is care was actually control. If I can control you so that you don't end up in
 trouble, then I won't have feelings about the trouble you're ending up in. So it's just
 good if you just do this. And I learned that control feels like care. So I learned that
 controlling and managing other people is actually a form of love and it's Christ-likeness.
 And so here I come and I hear the boundaries teaching which we haven't even defined yet,
 but we'll get to it ran right across that. And I remember thinking, this is the most
 ungodly teaching I've ever heard of.
 Well, I think it's not only control or care, but it's also that thing of, you know, you
 become a carpet that everybody can run across like everybody else's needs because I'm a
 Christian.
 Everybody else's needs matter more than my needs.
 And so because I'm laying down my life.
 That's right.
 And so what we actually become is again, co-dependent with other people's needs and totally unaware
 of our own because we're being Christ like.
 it's easier for me to leave my pain that I don't want to that
 by the way, I'm not even aware of.
 Right.
 So he's asking me to leave my pain in my heart and focus on yours.
 And Jesus even teaches about this.
 Like, you know, you know, why are you concerned about the spec
 and their eye when you got a huge log in your own?
 But we're often not aware of the logs in our own eyes.
 So let me be a super Christian and fix you.
 You absolute mess.
 So I don't have to be present with my own pain.
 And my absolute mess.
 Right.
 And I, you know, so.
 Yeah, how I came across boundaries 2003 I got to the school of ministry. I don't know anything that I've just told you
 I know nothing because again
 Everything is normal to you till you hear somebody else's normal right which by the way
 Do you remember when we went into the inner healing week? Yes
 I was just I was thinking about that such a beautiful picture
 So I don't know how much you know of AJ story
 But it would be fair to say that your life has been marked by big tea trauma sure all right lots of with some sprinkling of little tea trauma
  </li><li>Right, but majorly, like if you were to compare on paper,
 my story and your story, like Arab bringing Maya bringing,
 I had good Christian parents who stayed together,
 never got divorced, were never addicted to alcohol or drugs.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Didn't come from a broken home.
  </li><li>So the opposite of my story.
  </li><li>And your story is abuse, alcoholism, et cetera.
  </li><li>Drug addicts. - Suicide.
  </li><li>Trauma everywhere.
  </li><li>All the stuff, yeah.
  </li><li>And so we know AJ's obviously the damaged goods
 and I'm okay, I just, you know, maybe got a few rough edges.
 So we go and do this work, this week of Inner Healing,
 and it was amazing.
 And at the end of it, they're doing this debrief,
 and I remember them, Chester and Betsy,
 who just, wonderful, delightful, lovely people.
 They look at me and they're reviewing our week,
 together, and they're like, "Now, Alan,
 "when we spend this week with you,
 "your life and your story has all the hallmarks
 "of a childhood that's littered with trauma,
 And I burst out laughing thinking,
 you've confused our files.
 Like, no, I don't have any trauma.
 Like I was never abused physically, emotionally, sexually.
 I had parents who didn't go through divorce.
 What are you talking about?
 A great, like, my story is fine
 because my story was normal.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you could see them like going, oh, oh dear.
  </li><li>It's gonna be a fun week, friends.
  </li><li>Yeah, he's, you know, he's not able to hear.
 And I just didn't understand why your big tea trauma
 was not a deal and my little tea trauma,
 you know, 'cause we'd even laugh about it,
 the stuff that I'd gone through,
 you'd be like, "Aww."
 I mean, not that you were like,
 you didn't have compassion on me,
 but it just doesn't seem to compare,
 and that's one of the dangers we get into
 comparing our trauma.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
  </li><li>What were we talking about?
  </li><li>Trauma.
  </li><li>Trauma boundaries, 2003.
 I don't know anything about this.
 I don't know anything about feelings.
 You know, I don't know anything about boundaries.
 I don't know about leaving yourself.
 I don't know anything about inner healing.
 I turn up and this guy called Chip Dodd,
 Chip Judd, sorry, there's two chips now in our lives.
  </li><li>Two chips that we love very much.
  </li><li>Chip Dodd who wrote the book, "The Voice of the Heart"
 that we did a 10 episode, 12 episode thing, different man.
  </li><li>Different man.
  </li><li>Brilliant different man.
 Chip Judd is a pastor from North Carolina
 who came to Toronto to the school that I was doing,
 a bit like our school's supernatural life.
 And he was doing our boundaries a week.
 Everyone who is excited about what you hear about me
 is going to change your life.
 It's amazing.
 I was like, I can't wait.
 In worship, I'm aware that, oh, that guy must be chipped.
 I haven't kind of put two and two together,
 but there's a new person.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm betting it's chipped.
 But when I see chipped, this thought goes through my head.
 And the thought that goes through my head is like,
 I don't know who you are, but I want to be just like you.
 It's that little thought.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Don't know who you are, but I want to be just like you.
  </li><li>Well, he feels safe.
  </li><li>So safe.
  </li><li>And wonderful and solid.
  </li><li>Kind and wise.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Humorous and down to earth.
  </li><li>And he is, he's all those things, he's amazing.
  </li><li>Not super religious. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And what's interesting about Chip is,
 he is a counselor by training.
 And so he was for many years.
  </li><li>Yeah, so fantastic. - A pastor
 who in the same local church, right now, 20 plus years,
 but during the week he did family and therapy.
 He did, you know, he's a counselor or therapist.
 So he's so well versed in this and he's a pastor.
 Anyway, he's here to teach us on boundaries
 and he starts teaching.
 I really like what he's saying, he's funny, he's engaging, he's got great handouts, he can teach.
 I'm like, "I love this guy." It's just amazing. And then he starts introducing this concept of
 boundaries, which in a summary, if you don't know about boundaries, boundaries is, this is a really,
 you know, elevator pitch. Boundaries is the ability to say no and hear no without debilitating fear.
 Yes.
 Right?
 It's more than that, but he introduced this concept of a hula hoop.
 Well, that's not a concept.
 He brought a hula hoop with him and put himself inside the hula hoop and said,
 the hula hoop is one of life's greatest filtering systems.
 And he said the number one thing that God wants you to control
 is everything inside your hula hoop, namely yourself.
 Well, this was a shock to me because, like I said, I grew up in an environment
 where we would control one another and your responses and reactions and feelings.
 are my whole outlook in life was to make sure that you're okay. So I can be okay. Like I'm a good
 Christian. I don't want to hurt your attention. By the way, I've got Bible verses for this. Right.
 So my whole job is to live with an outward focus. And you have to perform. So I'm okay.
 Is everybody okay? And if they're not, what have I done wrong? So I can make you feel better. Yeah.
 And conversely, it's your job to make me feel better. Yes. That's how I live. What do I see?
 that was my normal. And along comes Chip saying, actually, no, like that's not what you were called
 to do. Because actually, you can't control anybody else. I'm like, excuse me, I have a PhD in the
 subtle art of care. You call it control, but I call it care. And I'm in sense, because it sounds
 like he's saying is like, Hey, if you'll just take care of what God's asked you to take care of,
 that which you're responsible for, life will go a lot better for you. But I'm like, but what about
 all the people that I can literally see making terrible life choices.
 They need me to control them.
 They need me.
 And let's not use the word control.
 Care.
 They need me to care for them.
 And if I can limit the choices so that they can make last bad decisions, it's a win for
 them and a win for me.
 I'm being a good Christian.
 Like I remember one of my earliest childhood traumas was being bullied by a guy called
 Christopher Bennett who would chase me home from school.
 And I remember my mom sitting me down when I was trying to chase me all the way home
 from school.
 I had to hide in my bin area, the outside bin area because I was frightened he was going
 to beat me up.
 And when my mom got home, I told her what happened, I remember my mom sitting down and going,
 "Well, you know, Christopher's from a broken home."
 And I remember thinking, "Yes, yeah, you know, his mom and dad have gone through a divorce
 and put Christopher, you know, it doesn't have his dad."
 And so he's probably just lashing out with that.
 So, you know, the good Christian response would be to show love to him
 because the Bible tells you to turn the other cheek.
 And I'm thinking, that sounds like the what that sounds so.
 And I remember having deep compassion for Christopher.
 And so like my response should be not, not care about him beating me up.
 He's just misunderstood.
 No, he doesn't have a loving father like I have.
 And so I've got nothing to complain about.
 Like now for those of you who are thinking, that's right.
 No, that's not right.
 Like one of my favorite moments, by the way, in group therapy.
 Yeah.
 is I don't even know how we started talking about that very story.
 Christopher Bennett.
 But they're talking about something.
 And they were like, hey, do you know where that started?
 Do you have a memory that comes with that?
 And I tell them that story.
 So I tell that story, albeit in a bit more detail.
 And at the end of it, the group leaders like, hey, so does anybody have any
 feedback that they want to share about Alan's story?
 And the guy sitting next to me blurts out,
 "F Christopher Bennett!"
 But doesn't actually say the F word.
 And I had never considered that that could be a response.
 This guy was so mad so mad at my mother talking me out of my need for care
 Yeah, and I was like I'd never even considered that until this this guy shared them
 Anyway, this is like the cross cultural like chip
 You know I trusted you but you're a liar and the stuff you're teaching is irresponsible
 And I remember saying you make me so mad like you're making me mad
 This teaching is making me mad and he's like yeah
 I don't have the power to make you mad, which made me even mad.
 What like when you just said that got me even more mad and he said, well,
 if I've got the power to make you mad, then I've got the power to make you glad.
 So is it my job to keep you happy?
 Oh, I don't know.
 I don't know.
 This feels like a trick question.
 I had never considered a paradigm other than it is my job to run around
 and make sure everybody in my life is OK with me.
 Yes.
 Rather than trusting that people are going to be powerful and
 Actually, I can't manage what they're feeling now, you know chip tempered that and I agree that
 Jerks or anything like that. That's not what this teaching is not a license to be a jerk. Yes
 Understanding that I can't control you. I understand I can influence you like I can like imagine you mad yet
 I imagine you mad yet, you know, I can't make you mad
 Like I can help you get there, but you don't want to do that. You know, we don't we don't tend to have
 I hated that week.
 I hated that week of boundary teaching.
 I thought it was so irresponsible.
 I thought, I mean, I was so offended by it.
 And worse, I was really offended
 that Gordon and Kathy would allow this in.
 And it just didn't seem like it had any value.
 And what shifted for me was living in a culture
 where people had healthy boundaries
 and watching them say no with care.
 Because I think no was such a strong word
 that you should never say.
 Like no felt like on Christlike.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, if you have a need and I say no,
 then that's on Christ's life.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Jesus literally says, you know,
 "Carrie, it's the centurion, I ask you,
 "Carrie, two miles, one mile, does he know?"
 You know, it was just such a foreign concept.
 And I had tremendous fear that the boundary teaching
 was just about permitting people to be entitled jerks.
  </li><li>Right, which it isn't at all.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>But the thing is, if you don't understand boundaries,
 then people can should on you
 and you will continue to respond to that
 to fulfill other people's needs
 when really the wisest decision for you
 might have been to say no.
  </li><li>Right, well, if you don't learn to say no,
 you will never individual it.
 You'll never be your own person.
 And that's why that whole thing about boundaries
 only work when you're full, as in full of love
 so that you can risk separation.
 'Cause for example, if Chris is like,
 "Hey, Alan, I'm moving this weekend, can you help me?
 "If I need Chris to like me, I can't say no to Chris."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, Chris saying, "Hey, can you help me move?"
 Even though I wanna say no, or even if I can't,
 I'm worried that my can't will hurt him
 and maybe he'll leave me and separate from me.
 So I end up saying yes, and then resenting Chris
 for making me move.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I'm resenting Chris for him being powerful enough
 to ask me to meet a need, but because I'm--
  </li><li>Not powerful enough to say no.
  </li><li>If you think about that, the only way your schedule
 is ever free is if people haven't asked you
 if you can do something.
 So then you start living in a place
 where you start avoiding people in case they ask something of you.
 And people can feel that.
  </li><li>Or you're living like a martyr.
  </li><li>Living like a martyr, thinking what's wrong with you people?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Why won't anybody help?
 And that was me, that's why I had my breakdown when I was 21.
 Like it was literally my job to be Jesus to everyone I meet.
  </li><li>To say yes to everyone.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I have no limitations,
 are you kidding me?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It's pretty God.
 In my weakness, his friends have made perfect.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so you know the worse I am,
 like the stronger God's glory is,
 I'm like, no!
  </li><li>Yes.
 You actually, when you were,
 I can't remember what part of what you were just sharing
 reminded me of that story that I remember
 on one of the leader schools in Toronto,
 you and I were serving as small group leaders.
 And Kathy had told us a story about a Wednesday night meeting
 or something and one of the leaders had come up and said,
 "Hey, are you, you know,
 "are you coming, are you guys coming to the meeting tonight?"
 And they said, "No, we're gonna stay home with our kids."
 And they're like, "Oh, well, if there's a meeting on you."
  </li><li>They said shame on you.
  </li><li>Oh, that's right, shame on you.
 You should bring your kids.
  </li><li>You can have your shame back.
 I don't want your shame.
  </li><li>Yeah, and if the church is open,
 you should be at the meeting.
  </li><li>Yeah, and so her response was like,
 actually you can keep your shame and don't shut on me.
 I'm actually gonna value time with my kids.
 You know, I'm gonna spend time as I feel like
 I'm supposed to spend it.
  </li><li>But there's a way healthier.
  </li><li>The hula hoop, you know,
 and said the hula hoop is my time and my kids.
 And this person is going,
 Now let me manage your hula hoop for you.
  </li><li>Right, and your opinion is not inside of my hula hoop.
  </li><li>Actually, your freedom is threatening my control.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Like what does it say about me,
 if you, the leader of the school,
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>gets to make a decision I wish I could make.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But for whatever reason, can I?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>What about like your experience of boundaries?
 'Cause one of the things that really attracted me to you,
 is that the right we're seeing?
 Me too.
  </li><li>Well, I hope so.
  </li><li>I would try it to you,
 was because of your powerfulness,
 Like you were one of the most powerful people I'd ever met
 in terms of you were like knowing who you are,
 knowing whose you are,
 and the way you lived your life was incredibly powerful.
 I was so attracted to the freedom with which you operate.
 Not the carelessness,
 not that you didn't care about what people thought
 because that-- - Wasn't that.
  </li><li>That's, you know, a counterfeit.
 But you had this piece about who you are
 and what you're called to,
 and you could say no one.
 I like where did you understand boundaries?
 Where did you learn boundaries?
 What's your history?
 Well, it's funny.
 I don't know.
 I know where I didn't learn it.
 I didn't learn it at home.
 And I can talk about that in a minute.
 But for me, I think the more inner healing I got,
 the more I understood my identity as a daughter,
 how loved I am, the more I was able to say no,
 and still feel loved and still feel fine.
 and still feel that the Holy Spirit is still on good speaking terms with it?
 Yes, and again, I'm living in this community where this is our norm, that it's fine to say no,
 and it's fine to say yes, but there isn't that shudding on one another and whatnot.
 And so I would say I did fairly well with boundaries with, you know, church things and friend things
 and all of that kind of stuff, but still pretty terrible with boundaries within my immediate family.
 And again, a lot of that's going to go back to most of my family then.
 And even now, I have an enormous amount of trauma going on.
 And I had always been told as a, as a teenager.
 I mean, my mom used to say, Oh, yeah, you're seven going on 21.
 Like I was never a kid.
 It was never allowed to be a kid, but I also was told my role as family
 glue, make everybody feel better.
 You keep the family together.
 Fix it.
 Um, yeah.
 And I was the only sibling that really I didn't have ongoing fights with the other siblings, if that makes sense.
 Like I got along with all three of the of the others.
 And so you learn peacekeeping real quick.
 Oh, yeah.
 And so but but that also meant like even, you know, here we are in the midst of a revival and I'm traveling and I'm doing all this stuff.
 But I'm also getting phone calls from my mother saying your brother just got here.
 He stoned.
 He said he's going to kill himself.
 this is where he said he went and I would drive across the city and try and find my brother,
 you know, and because that was my role. You know, I'm 20 years old and I need to stop my
 brother from killing himself. You know, I need to, I need to fix this rift between, you know,
 my brother and my sister, I might, you know, and you'd be pulled into triangling all the
 time. Yes. So one, that's so, so, so, can you go speak to them? Can you go fix it? And you're
 like what like what is that about? Yeah. But again, normal.
 Yes, it was my normal. It's so normal till you hear a different
 way of living that's available. Right. And so you, you know, you
 heard the boundaries teaching, hated the boundaries teaching, then
 took it on board and started living. Because it was modeled
 beautifully to me in the environment I lived in. Yes. And
 I began to watch people care for one another through boundaries.
 But you almost developed an aggressive no for a while as
 you're learning.
  </li><li>And I think I know.
  </li><li>Yes, I think I don't want to justify that.
 But yes, I did.
 And I think part of what happened was the pendulum
 was so swung over here.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That in order for me to get my no back,
 I couldn't, I didn't have the vocabulary to say,
 "Oh no, thank you."
 It had to be, no!
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then be terrified.
 And then watch that, "Oh, people didn't abandon me
 or leave me when I said no."
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I was so grateful to live in a culture
 where people were like, "Look at you,
 you turn out your new boundaries,
 that wasn't shaming, it was like good for you.
 Like we know where you stand.
  </li><li>So if we come back to me and my family,
 I would say I don't think I was aware
 of how little boundaries I had
 or how much control was an operation
 inside of my family unit.
 I mean, I knew there was tons of dysfunction,
 but specifically that whole,
 how much I needed to fix everything for everyone
 until we got married.
 And I, one of my members, I mean, I probably have several,
 but there was, certainly when we had kids,
 we had to put down really intense boundaries
 and hold to those boundaries,
 and they eventually got used to it and, you know, whatever.
 But I remember in our first year of marriage,
 my mom had called, and it was like,
 I wanna say one or two in the morning.
 It was a really weird time,
 and she called me and said,
 "Hey, this sibling is stuck at this parking lot,
 doesn't have the money to pay to get their car out of the parking lot.
 And so can you go and get money out of your bank and drive up there and pay for
 their parking so that they can get out of the parking lot.
 And, and I was like, yeah, I guess I can, you know, because that's, you know,
 I didn't even think about it.
 There was, there was no like, like, oh, this is what I need to do.
 Yeah. Cause this is what you do.
 And I was like, where are we going?
 Everybody else's problems.
 Yeah.
 And you were like, babe, you're not going.
 It's a 45-minute drive there.
 It's they can actually hop on a bus
 or they could call someone or get a cab to their home.
  </li><li>Or walk to an ATM. - Or walk to an ATM.
  </li><li>Or, you know, they're, I mean,
 we're not talking about kids here,
 we're talking about 40-year-old adults
 who could actually solve this on their own.
 But typically my mom would phone
 and I would go and sort it out.
  </li><li>And rescue. - Rescue.
  </li><li>And so you train people,
 this is how you can treat me.
  </li><li>Yes. - This will be my role.
  </li><li>So I had no no. - Right.
  </li><li>I didn't even know to say no.
 I remember you being panicked
 that you were gonna be late for the sibling.
  </li><li>Yeah, and when you're talking to me,
 I'm now getting mad at you.
 How can you be, this is my job.
  </li><li>Well, your eyes are darking everywhere.
 Like the whole time we're talking
 is the last time I can be going and this.
  </li><li>I could be there back right now.
  </li><li>These, where people are stuck.
 And I'm like, let's back this up.
 They willingly chose to park in a parking lot,
 knowing they had no money to get out.
  </li><li>Knowing they could call you to come and sort it out.
  </li><li>This is called a consequence.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Like you said,
 this is a grown adult who has made this choice
 more than once. - Yes.
  </li><li>Why don't you...
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Let them roll with their own consequences.
  </li><li>I was speechless. - Yeah.
 And so I ended up phoning my mom back and saying,
 "I'm not going."
  </li><li>That's insane.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I mean, she wasn't happy about that.
 And I'm, you know.
  </li><li>Everybody wasn't happy.
  </li><li>No, everybody was.
  </li><li>Because you've changed the norm.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That to everybody else seems normal,
 but once you get an outside perspective.
 Yeah. It's like, it's, it was bizarre.
 So I mean, I would say, you know, we, we had Abby pretty fast also when we got
 married. So we ended up having to establish a whole nother set of boundaries.
 This, this is our baby that we're going to raise the way the Holy Spirit told us
 to raise her. And, you know, all those kinds of things.
 I would say we spent years laying a foundation of boundaries and, and having to
 hold them at times they held okay.
 And then at other times we had to sort of
 rebuild those boundaries and re-establish things.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>That's why I'm thinking like, you know,
 if you don't have a framework,
 like going back to that childhood development,
 if you don't have a bucket to put somebody's no into.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like if your only bucket for a no is your abandonment,
 your rejection, then boundaries are just
 this horrible, abominable topic.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But if you understand that, oh, like you can say no,
 and I can say no, and that's okay,
 we still be okay, then it gives life.
 Now, I'm gonna tell you a story,
 but I texted with Lyle.
 So Lyle thought it's one of our dear friends
 who's a pastor in our church, in our city,
 a big apartment in Nashville.
 Amazing, amazing young man, amazing.
 I call him young man.
  </li><li>Well, he's younger than us.
  </li><li>He's younger than us.
 He's amazing, a great leader.
 And so I text him and said, "Hey, Lyle,
 "I'm teaching on boundaries this afternoon.
 "We're gonna do a podcast on boundaries.
 "You okay if I tell the story?"
 And he's like, "Absolutely."
 Here's, this is such a simple example
 of misunderstanding because you don't have boundaries
 or don't understand boundaries.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>By his own admission.
 So we first met Lyle when Heidi Baker came to Grey Center.
 He came as one of Heidi's, you know, prayer people.
 It's for Heidi's first time,
 not I just first time I beg your pardon it was Lyell's first time with Heidi so Heidi comes and and Lyell meets me and you and he says
 Oh, I'm so glad to meet you when I was out in Pemba when I was doing the school
 Somebody handed me a walkman not a walkman on an iPod with the father heart series
 And it was you teaching and so I'm so glad to put a name to a face and we were like, oh, it's so, you know
 Good to see you where do you live and he didn't yet live in Nashville. Hey, he said I'm thinking of moving here
 So when you move here, you know, hook us up, you know, we'd love we'd love to meet you
 you know, look us up when you get here.
 Yeah.
 So he does, a couple of months later, comes to emanate.
 And after the service, he comes up and reintroduces himself.
 And, you know, and he was like, hey, you know,
 I've moved to town and you would love to get to coffee with you.
 And I was like, great, you know, here's my assistance,
 email address with you, email my assistant,
 and we'll make it happen.
 Now, I only know this story years later when Lyle and I
 became good friends.
 Yes.
 And he confided in me.
 But that interaction with him was so hurtful.
 Wow. - Wow.
  </li><li>Talk to me about why that was so hurtful
 because from my perspective, I'm like,
 here's somebody who wants to get together,
 I would love to get together with you,
 which is why I said email my assistant.
 Like if I-- - This is who makes
 that happen for me.
  </li><li>Right, and I know me, I've just finished speaking
 and I know I'm an influencer, I'd be like,
 "Yeah, I'd love to connect with you."
 And I will then forget.
 It's like when you get a text message and you read it
 and you're like, "Oh, I should reply to that person."
 And then three days later,
 because there isn't a little red dot saying
 you have a new message.
  </li><li>It happens to me all the time, still.
  </li><li>You forget that you said.
 And I, so because I know that's my brain,
 that's why I have an assistant, one of the reasons.
 And so I said email my assistant,
 and so my assistant will put it into the queue
 and show schedule.
 Anyway, Lyle doesn't do that because Lyle heard me say,
 "Yeah, whatever email my assistant,
 I've got no interest in being with you."
 Even though my words were, yes, I'd love to get with you.
 You know, let my assistant know,
 but he had a normal that this is what pastors do
 when they want to get rid of you.
 Whereas my normal is if I don't want to have dinner with you,
 I'll say, I don't want to have dinner with you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like I'm very, very direct about what I will
 and won't do and I don't hit and I don't drop,
 you know, sort of, I'll just speak it out loud.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So I'm waiting on Lyle's email and I'm thinking,
 well, I guess he didn't email,
 I guess he didn't want to hang out.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I mean, I don't even remember thinking that,
 to be honest, I just got on with the rest of my life,
 but he said, I just went away in a funk thinking,
 you know, Alan, AJ, they're all like their peer friend
 like with anyone I meet and you know.
 And so I don't know this, but he's all heard.
  </li><li>That makes me sad.
  </li><li>I have no clue, but he calls Gary Morgan.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 knows us. And it's like, and Gary's like, Hey, have you
 carried with the Joneses? Yeah, it's like, well, no, they kind
 of blew us off. Gary's like, that doesn't sound like the Jones
 is like what happened. So Lyle tells the story and Gary starts
 laughing and go, no, like, if they said they want to get with
 you, they want to get with you email their assistant. And so he
 emails the assistant, we connect and here's later, we're
 really good friends. And we laugh about that. I would never
 have known that my clear communication meant something to
 him because we all speak in codes and riddles. Yes. You know,
 Lyle's norm was that pastors, you know, will, right, you know, he doesn't mean it.
 Whereas my norm was, I mean, while I say, and I say what I mean, and I'm trusting
 you to say what you mean.
 And you said you would email me.
 Well, I think often, even if we've grown up in families with really clear
 communication and maybe even healthy boundaries, many of us have learned our
 really horrible boundaries at church under the guise of being spiritual.
 You know, really.
 I think so.
 I think we've learned, you know, just basically that whole thing of like, well, you're supposed
 to lay down your life for one of the, I mean, you're supposed to become a doormat for everybody
 else.
 You're, you know, you should never say no.
 You should always say yes to everything.
 And, you know, and then you have a whole bunch of bitter people serving in places that they
 shouldn't probably be in the first place because they didn't know that they had a no to give.
 People feeling like they should do something.
 Yes.
 And your should is just a, is a gnawing death now.
 Oh, it's just small.
 Yeah.
 Whenever you feel like you should do something, your language indicates that the power is elsewhere than in your hula hoop.
 Yeah.
 Like, "I should wear a tie" means "I should wear a tie for my boss" or "I should wear a tie to keep my mom happy" or "I should go home for Thanksgiving."
 And that should is not in your hula hoop.
 You know, if you've never heard about boundaries before, I'm not sure this is the best introduction to boundaries at all.
 We have talked about boundaries before on the podcast.
 Yes.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I forget what episode that is,
 but if you look in the show notes,
 I'll tell you what episode it is.
 I'll link to us talking about it before.
  </li><li>Right, but the other option is you're about to do.
  </li><li>Well, yes, yes, I have.
 That's the other thing, thank you.
 Yes, I have just built something called the boundary course.
 It's a course that you can work through
 at your own schedule.
 It assumes that you know nothing about boundaries
 and starts from the very foundations
 of how relationships are built,
 how relationships are designed in scripture,
 And we'll take you through, I think there's like eight different lessons,
 all in bite size, easy to digest video material.
 Well, you just watch at your own pace.
 I've got questions in there to help you process that.
 And, you know, we're launching that.
 But the thing I'm most excited about is we're about to do something,
 or I'm about to do something called the Boundary Summer School.
 It's built around the course that I've just created.
 But the Boundary Summer School is me guiding you through the whole process.
 registration for the summer school opens today.
 The day this gets released.
 Made it.
 And it closes Wednesday, May 19th.
 So you only have, what's that?
 Nine days.
 Yeah.
 Or 10 days, I guess, to register.
 It closes Wednesday, May 19th at midnight, our time.
 And if you sign up for the Boundary Summer School,
 not only do you get everything in the Boundary's course,
 but you'll also get me each week meeting with you
 in a live group call to help answer your questions,
 But I also help you process, how does what you just learned on the boundaries course apply to your specific life?
 In addition to that, you're going to have this private forum where everybody else was doing the boundary school.
 You can write questions, you can share your story, you can learn from other people doing the summer school.
 And also you'll get weekly emails while you're on the summer school to help you stay engaged, to help you process what's going on.
 It is a five week school.
 Yeah.
 And it only requires two hours a week, one hour for you to watch the material on the boundaries course that I've prerecorded and one hour for you to meet with me on Sundays over zoom as we process that we together.
 So two hours a week for five weeks for a glorious transformation.
 Right.
 You said, though, if you're new to this whole boundaries teaching or you haven't heard it before, I have this course.
 And I would say the course is useful even if you have heard it be like, so I do think you need to hear something multiple times.
 before you get it. And with this kind of stuff, because you're not trying to just get it,
 but actually live it. Well, that's the thing I'm most passionate about.
 I'm most passionate about it. And I think the advantage is being able to actually ask
 you questions about, but what about this? But what about that is super helpful, and it's
 not an opportunity we often get when we listen to teaching.
 Right. So if you, in fact, I'm working with a market consultant just talking about, how
 How do I communicate this?
 How do I help?
 And they had done, they'd heard my boundaries teaching,
 so they'd done some of the boundary stuff.
 Some of the stuff that I'm gonna teach on this,
 if you've done SSL, if you've heard me speak at Ammonate,
 you will have heard some of the stuff.
 There's brand new material in there too.
  </li><li>Yes, yeah.
  </li><li>But they were listening to it,
 and they were saying, oh my gosh,
 I forgot how much I need this.
 Even though I've heard this before,
 I'm listening to it again, and it's ringing my bell.
 I absolutely need to put this into practice.
 because there's a big difference between listening
 to understand and listening to apply.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And the whole emphasis of the Boundary Summer School
 is to get you ready for a summer of freedom.
 So if you're feeling trapped in your relationships,
 for example, do you ever feel like you've got relationships
 where you don't feel like yourself when you're in them?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Where you feel like you have to dumb yourself down
 in order to be with this person
 because perhaps you're too big for that person
 or perhaps you've, oh, maybe I'm too intimidating
 for that person.
 And so you suppress yourself for the sake of the relationship.
 That's toxic.
 Like that is not healthy.
 That is unkind to you and unkind to them.
 We get into all that sort of stuff.
 We talk explain fully about the hula hoops.
 We answer the most common questions about that.
 We talk about a dynamic that shows up in family relationships.
 Like you talked about it at all.
 The whole dynamic that you were going in.
 But the thing is, it's not just theory.
 it is me helping you walk through
 and apply the boundaries teaching to your life.
 And I'm really, really excited about it.
 If you can't tell, like I love to teach,
 I love to spend time teaching,
 and I love to watch transformation happen for people.
 So if you would like to join me
 for the Boundary Summer School,
 it lasts five weeks, register today,
 because you know what life happens?
 It's like those text messages where you're like,
 "Oh yeah, I'll totally do that."
 And then you'll forget,
 and because I am a boundaries person,
 Well, once that deadline hits on Wednesday 19th at midnight,
 I will not be opening up again because I want to provide
  </li><li>He is a boundaries person.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>An excellent experience for everyone
 who does the Boundaries Summer School.
  </li><li>So on last week's recording when we said,
 "Hey, we have a surprise next week."
 That is the surprise.
  </li><li>The surprise is not only is the Boundaries course created,
 but the Boundaries Summer School is released.
 I'd love you to be on it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>If you've been listening to us and think,
 I would love more access.
 I would love a guide to help me through this stuff.
 I don't just want to be thrown into it and listen to it
 and hope it makes sense to me,
 but I would love somebody to help me go through this.
 Then I would love to do that.
 The school is going to run in May and in June,
 like five weeks long, and I am really looking forward to it.
 We did something similar last year
 for the finding the father heart.
 The father heart summer school.
 This year we're going to do boundaries.
 So if you want to learn more about it,
 if you go to allen and ag.com/boundries,
 you will learn all about what's in the course.
 And there's a link on there that talks about the summer school.
 Go to the show notes,
 I'll put a link to both the boundaries course
 and the boundary summer school.
 So you can reach out, I'd love to have you with me.
 It would be my joy to get you ready
 for a summer filled with relationship freedom.
  </li><li>All right, well for now,
 if you want the show notes for this show.
 Oh, come on, are we not?
 Oh, you have repentance to do, don't you?
 You do because earlier in the recording, we had a little break in the middle and earlier in the recording, I had said it's a song, the fish song, and that Katie Perry sings it and you, it's not Katie Perry.
 So what would you like to say, darling?
 What I wanted to say is I have a great listening question for you.
 I recorded Chris.
 Yeah, I was totally wrong.
 It is.
 One more time.
 I was totally wrong.
 Just just that clip because I want to ringtone.
 I want.
 I was wrong and you were right. Thank you. It was Katy Perry. It was on a for all track. Okay, but she's singing. Yeah, no, no, you were absolutely right. And I was absolutely wrong. Okay, good. What I'm looking for is the listeners question this week. Oh, this is a listener's question. It is an anonymous question. Yes. And the question is something I'm curious to hear your perspective about is women in church leadership.
 I personally have a lot of respect for and have experienced incredible fruit from women
 and leadership, especially in tandem with male leaders. However, I sometimes struggle to reconcile
 this with New Testament verses like 1 Timothy 2 12 and 1 Corinthians 1434. Do you think these
 instructions were intended for the culture at the time? They were written and no longer apply.
 Does this seem to be Paul's opinion versus a command from God? Or is there another piece I
 I am missing and for the record, I'm genuinely curious and open minded about this.
 Yes.
 Go.
 Well, I don't want to answer that other than to say you were a woman in church.
 I'm a church.
 I'm a woman in church leadership and I feel good about it.
 No, I do.
 But you actually do a whole teaching on women in ministry.
 I do.
 I felt positive that we had done a podcast episode on women in ministry and we have
 not.
 What we have done is we've had this question answered before or sorry, asked
 before. And I did what I'm about to do now and say that we have talked about it.
 And actually the person who asked this question has done SOSL.
 But what I want to say is we do a whole week in SOSL year two,
 where we talk about the specific topic and actually discuss those verses.
 Here's why I'm not able to answer that question right now.
 I am able to answer the question and have done so at length,
 but it requires about an hour of systematic teaching,
 which I'm happy to do. But here's what I'm going to do just now. I'm going to do two things. One,
 if you go to the show notes of this week's episode, I'm going to put a link to me teaching an hour
 answer to that question. And I'm going to put a book, a link to a book that has been so helpful.
 It's called Why Not Women. And I'll put a link to it in the show notes where you can pick up. But
 yes, your question is beautiful. Yes, we believe in women in ministry. If we didn't, that would be
 kind of awkward for you. When you say, is there another piece I'm missing? There is another piece
 I'm missing. I don't say that in a shameful way at all. It is a deeply complex topic where
 brilliant minds, far brilliant minds than me, have debated this endlessly. And we have talked
 about it and can answer the seeming opposition that Paul's writing in First Timothy and First
 Corinthians answers. So if you are doing year two, you will answer that. If you're not,
 Go read that book, Why Not Women, or watch that, um, our teaching where I talk about women in ministry.
 Yeah, perfect. If you've got a question that you want us to ask, answer, or at least partially
 answer and direct you to other resources where you can get an answer, go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/askandfillitin.
 Now, Agee Jones, if they want show notes, where do they go? If you want the show notes, go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/236.
 boom and just like that we will be back next week. Peace friends we're out.
