<p> I'll in an age is got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is welcome to episode one eighty six of keeping up with the Jones is where this week we are going to talk about the presence of God.
 Before we get to the presence of God.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I think I listen to know that you reached a major milestone in your Zelda career this week.
 Oh, in my Zelda career.<br/>
 Yes, I did.<br/>
 I beat Calamity Gannon.<br/>
 and dark beast get in yes which is another secret can and that you don't even know exists until you beat the main bad guy and some other bad guy appears who's supposed to be worse or you listen to this podcast you find out sorry if that's a spoiler sorry the game's been out for you know a year so.
 Yeah well I didn't know you know you didn't know that's gonna happen well I knew I knew like a week or two ago when you beat him right but I was like what.
 What you know the whole time you just like okay i have to finish all these things and then be coming again and what made you want to go to the end and be the bad guy.
 I did i did i did i accident i did too i mean you're in the castle.
 Only right your in the neighborhood you go visit the bad guy was exploring the castle and i had just recently figured out how to beat line also is trying to harvest line also.
 For parts basically because you get to upgrade armor it's the strangest thing anyway so we never played zalda i apologize.
 So i just want to beat some bad guys and i ended up like five steps from work and again i was in the kids like beat him beat him beat him i thought why not so i did.
 Like a boss actually he was easy to beat them some of the other bosses if you ask me is true yeah.
 All right this week you turn asked a verse by verse i did talk me through that.
 verse by verse. It's going to take a while. There was boas and feeds and it looked like
 Mardi Gras gone wrong. Talk to me about that part. No, no, it's Mardi Gras gone right. Oh, I see.
 The Jewish believers celebrate a thing called the Feast of Perim, or Perim, however you want to
 pronounce it. And they still celebrate it to this day. And it's the feast that Mordecai and Esther
 put in place after the defeat of Hammon and their people get saved.
 So they celebrate Perm every year and it's a feast that's about thankfulness and gratitude
 and for having avoided genocide basically.
 Do you think to have a feast about?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So they pray prayers of being thankful and celebration and it's a big party and they
 they dress up.<br/>
 And the reason that they dress up is to symbolize
 it looking like circumstances were gonna go one way,
 but God had something hidden underneath to turn it around.
 So they dress up as a symbol of God is always working
 behind the scenes of what you see in front of you.
</p><ul>
  <li>Amazing.
  </li><li>So it's kinda cool.
 So we did that and we ate a whole bunch of perm food
 and we took up an offering and gave it away.
 And we just did the whole, we did a perm celebration
 after reading verse by verse through Esther.
  </li><li>So Hala, every year.
  </li><li>I love it, it's so fun.
 And everybody seems to really enjoy it, so it was great.
  </li><li>What's the Jewish bread that I love?
  </li><li>Hala.
  </li><li>Oh, so good.
  </li><li>Oh, it's so good.
 Yeah, we have our friend Betsy makes it for us every year
 and it's just addictive.
  </li><li>And we're their friend David Wagner in time?
  </li><li>We did, and it was lovely to have him here.
  </li><li>I can't remember which episode David was on,
 but it was a killer episode.
 was great. His testimony is amazing. Unbelievable. David's a prophet from Florida who's just super
 kind, super gentle, loves a father, father loves him. And if you haven't heard David's story,
 you, I would really, really encourage. I'll put a link in the show notes to it. It's,
 it's going to be easily one of the most encouraging things you ever listened to.
 Yeah, it's really, really good. And you went to a movie without me this week.
 with your permission and street did you have my permission i haven't actually even heard from you
 how did you like black panther i really enjoyed it i think it was a departure from
 the marvel cinematic universe in much of the way that spider man was a departure and the part
 isn't bad at all it was just in a stand alone movie it was really really good very powerful
 great storytelling some amazing plot developments and some great character banter.
 You know how marvels really funny and witty yes they add some of that there but yeah i really enjoyed it some of the fight scenes were a bit fatiguing for me but you know i have battle fatigue.
 It's just like we know how this ends because we know he's in the new avenger movie so we know he wins don't know right spoiler he does win but yeah i really enjoyed it it was really powerful is made all the more powerful the i watched a friday night saturday morning.
 I was on youtube and i was watching.
 Jimmy Fallon and Chadwick.
 What was that name i have no idea the main the main actor okay i was back and they were
 the i put it on twitter is really moving and it was a bunch of people from the black community who
 were just commenting on what impact it was to have a black super hero and the impact that i made on
 them and just the story and i was in tears watching it so basically what they have audience members
 come out and just you know really honor Chadwick for his role and honor the cast that hey this is
 is what the movie meant to me. This is how powerful it was. This is because there's huge powerful
 messages in there, not only for the black community, but also for women as well. They portray women
 in a very powerful way, powerful, not out of anger, powerful, not out of rebellion, just powerful
 because women are powerful. And so they're honoring him and they just think they're doing like a
 video segment, not realizing he's actually behind the curtain. And then he steps out. And it's just
 It's a beautiful, very moving.
 Oh, wow.
 I have to look for that.
 Yeah, I've watched a movie first, then watched that.
 Okay.
 Really impacting.
 And you had a very interesting dinner with the children as well this weekend.
 I did.
 I was trying to teach Tia how to ride a bike.
 Yes.
 I taught Abby how to ride a bike.
 The trouble is I can't remember what I did to teach her.
 Oh.
 It's a bit like swimming.
 You know, you think they're going to drown and they flail ungracefully.
 And then eventually, without your help, they start swimming.
 i think with abby we took the pedals off and she just pushed it until she got all of her balance
 i want to try that too with with tia and the trouble is i'm so out of shape that pushing my
 door you know i'm like okay we're done and we live on hills so that doesn't help either yeah but
 she loved it and then each of the kids want to go out for bike ride with daddy because t
 got to go for us anyway i had a great bonding and then saturday i took them all out for dinner you
 you were heading out for dinner and so mean.
  </li><li>And do you want to confess what you fed them?
  </li><li>I don't think that matters.
 I don't think the audience is interested in that.
  </li><li>I think it's important to bring to the light
 that you gave them milkshakes.
  </li><li>I gave the kids milkshakes, that's right.
 'Cause I'm the fun parent.
  </li><li>You know, we need to talk about this
 because they're actually starting to say that now.
  </li><li>Baby, it's true.
 It's like, I think every relationship
 is a good cop, bad cop.
 I'm clear that it's a good cop.
 you're the bad cop.
  </li><li>Okay, but I don't get to be the good cop
 because I do like their laundry and feed them and things.
  </li><li>Well, kids don't value that at this age.
 In time they'll look back and realize,
 I have cavities because of daddy,
 but a tidy bedroom because of money.
  </li><li>And there you go.
  </li><li>And they'll all even out in the end.
 But on the way home, me and the three kids
 had a fascinating conversation about where babies came from.
 And I just thought, I'm just gonna take the opportunity
 to just as nonchalantly as I can,
 explain where babies come from and much hilarity ensued,
 which I then I thought,
 I don't know if you wanted to be there for that conversation.
 I mean, it's not like it's the only conversation
 we're gonna ever have.
  </li><li>Well, heavens no, we had one this morning.
  </li><li>It was just the first pass at the conversation.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And T was like, "By special cuddle, you mean this goes there?"
 And I'm like, "That's right, darling."
 And then I had to explain to them that,
 Hey, in the same way that we told you that Santa doesn't exist and the same way that we told you
 Like why we don't celebrate Halloween
 There's gonna be lots of your friends who do believe in Santa or lots of your friends who do like Halloween
 And we're not gonna ruin what they do or don't know and you know something like where babies come from is something that mummies and
 Daddy's get to tell their own children
 So even though you know don't lord that over your friends and they're like yes, daddy
 And then I have to go through them one by one T. Yeah, do you understand? Yes?
 Do you understand and then of course MJ wants to go through every variation of every variable of what it what he could say and what he couldn't say
 I'm like honey. Stop looking for a poll just so no
 This is fair warning to all of our friends who have kids who are friends with our kids
 You might want to have that talk faster rather than
 Then later unless you are my kids version hopefully they're not gonna shatter your children's perceptions of things
 I do like though that even though they're, I mean, I think MJ is kind of young to know that.
 I, you know, but, but I do like that there's, it's not something that shrouded in mystery
 or shame or anything else because I think that was part of my reason.
 I just thought like, hi there, we just make it a big deal where we like, now you get the
 talk or I mean, everything we've taught them has come out of relationship.
 It's not been like, now we're going to have this awkward conversation.
 It's been this back and forth banter.
 They ask us, I mean, I remember Tia saying, tell me everything you know about the glory
 of God.
 It's not like you sit down and go, okay guys, now I need to tell you about the glory of
 God.
 But think about how they got saved.
 Think about, you know, all of our conversations have all the difficult ones we've had.
 I've all just come out of them asking questions.
 And I actually, I love it.
 I thought, if we just treat this as normal as it is and then add why it's special but
 not shameful, hopefully, hopefully this will set them up well.
 And again, it wasn't graphic.
 You know, I just used proper terms, which they all know because they've always referred
 to their genitalia by this proper name.
 We've sex-proofed our kids.
 We've told them, you know, people are not allowed to touch or look.
 And if anybody tries, you scream, you scream out, "No, that's my body!" and you come and
 tell a parent.
 So we've been very, very frank with them.
 And I think this was just an extension of the frankness.
 And at later stages, we'll have a more detailed conversation.
 There was enormous amounts of giggling this morning at the breakfast table when
 Tia and MJ were retelling about the conversation.
 Tia retelling the conversation, MJ giggling and Abby just looking at her
 cereal with her head down eating and saying nothing.
 So we might need to circle back with that.
 Well, the most amazing part was when I explained to my babies for me, they were like, wait.
 So you and mommy, yes, three times. Oh, honey.
 Yep. Just three times.
 So good times, adventures in parenting.
 There you go.
 Our inspiration for our main topic this week comes from being a grace and
 another this morning, we went to church as normal and worship,
 mountain to Fanny Krauss from were leading worship and there was an unusual anointing
 on worship for service. I was like, this kind of feels like second service worship.
 And then just the sweetest presence of the Lord came down and we just worshiped through
 the whole time. In fact, went almost into the second service, but Jeff stopped the service,
 which I'm sure the musicians were thankful, not only their fingers. I'm sure they're
 embarrassed, but also their bladders. Right. And you know, we got to quickly grab some
 in a cup of coffee before we did it all again in second service.
 And again, this beautiful presence of the Lord.
 And I just thought, I love this.
 This is what we live for.
 Yeah.
 And I thought it would be fun to talk about the presence of God.
 And, you know, often when we're recording these podcasts, I have me as an audience
 member in mind, me 20 years ago, me wanting to know about the stuff that is so normal
 for us today, but seemed so far off and mysterious back then.
 Right.
 I don't know why you're listening, but hopefully this is helpful.
 Hopefully we're just really trying to demystify and explain some of where stuff is in the
 Bible.
 We never try and teach on the podcast.
 We teach for a living.
 The podcast is more conversational, but I digress.
 We're talking about the presence of God this evening.
 So when you're talking about the presence of God, why don't you explain what you mean
 by that?
 Yeah.
 I think, you know, one of the facets of God that we're all familiar with is his omnipresence,
 the notion that God is everywhere.
 Right.
 So I remember, for example, when Toronto happened, when the outpouring happened in Toronto,
 I remember one of the criticisms that I heard from people was like, "Well, God's everywhere.
 Why would I need to go there?"
 Right.
 And I'm like, "That's a logical argument on paper.
 It's really poor in experience."
 Right.
 Well, it's the difference between the omnipresence of God, isn't it?
 And the manifest presence of God.
 Right.
 being the fact that God is everywhere, but the manifest presence is where God is here,
 where God manifests His presence, God shows up. And tangibly, there's an experience as an
 encounter of God. It's remarkable when, not to be too poetic, but when heaven kisses earth.
 Something happens. Yeah, for sure. And I'm just thinking about, I have experienced the presence
 of the Lord both privately and corporately, privately, meaning in my own devotional times,
 in my own quiet times. I was just thinking this morning in the middle of worship, in the middle of
 this amazing presence of the Lord. I remembered I would have this in my bedroom at home when I
 lived in Scotland. I would remember just waiting on the presence of God and the presence of God
 would show up and I would literally commando crawl underneath my bed and not hide from it,
 But it just felt so intense.
 I just thought, Lord, if you don't lift off me, you know, it's funny.
 I'd ask for the presents to come.
 And then when the presence of the Lord would come, you'd hide under your back.
 I'd ask him to take off me because I thought I'm going to die.
 I don't think this moral frame can sustain the weight of your glory.
 So there's the private in my experience presence of God, but then there's this
 corporate manifest presence, which is amazing.
 It's going to group of people come together and there's this increased awareness
 that the Lord is here. He's in our midst. There's a sense of awe. There's a sense of his presence.
 You can feel hope rising. You can feel faith rising. Yeah. And it's astonishing. Yeah.
 So I thought tonight we could talk about things that help cultivate the presence of the Lord
 and things that hinder the presence of the Lord. All right. Well, give me a list of things that
 help. Your all right, it sounded very Scottish there. It did. All right. All right.
 Well, I was thinking it's no surprise that for us the presence of the Lord is usually ushered in
 in worship. I don't think it always has to be that way. But there's something about worship
 that brings about the presence of God. Oh, for sure. And it's also in the Bible.
 Well, that's helpful, isn't it? Like in Psalms 100, it says that we enter as gates with thanksgiving
 in this court with praise. Like, we literally enter into the presence of the Lord through
 thanksgiving and through worship. And there's something super powerful about proclaiming the name
 of Jesus and worship and adoration. And there's a verse that everybody, I don't think they
 misquote, but they quote an old version of it. It's Psalms 22 verse 3, where it talks about
 the Lord is enthroned on the praises of Israel. So we often quote it as the Lord
 and habits the praises of his people. I think that comes from Psalm 22 verse 3.
 But there's a sense where God is enthroned on the praises, says there in praises of Israel.
 But when we worship the Lord, we're just like, "Ah, and I think it's when we're not going through
 the motions, when there's a genuine heart to connect, the Lord loves to respond to that."
 Yeah, for sure. I think, yeah, it's a difference of coming to church, expecting something,
 and in unexpected hope or sort of coming and punching your time clock with God.
 Do you know what I mean? Like I punched in a church today. So check, I've done that thing.
 I think along with worship is also hunger, probably pretty much what you were talking about.
 We would notice that like in Toronto, there was always, when we were there,
 I remember there was always the presence of the Lord. You could go in the sanctuary and be empty,
 and you could feel the presence of the Lord on Sunday mornings you feel the presence of the Lord but when conferences happened.
 It was that's what we just increase and i think because you've got a room full of really hungry people who have in one sense.
 I don't mean to be controversial but one sense they put their money where the mouth is they have yes they have paid money to fly some time from the other side of the world.
 they've paid money to come to a conference they've placed a value not that you can ever place a value in the presence of lord but it's not something they're taking for grand they're not coming out of habit.
 They're coming with a purpose and that purpose is they want their hunger field right and this is so powerful about that totally agree.
 James for verses is drawn here to god and he will draw near to you i think that is one of the most profound verses in scripture yeah you can move.
 the Lord of the heavens towards you by simply moving towards him.
 I took that verse super seriously. I still do, but I remember when I read that verse and
 I was just thinking, wait, if that's true, that started my Thursday night date to the Lord.
 I used to take Thursday night from seven to nine, I'd cancel out my calendar, and I would just block
 off that time. I don't know what it looks like to draw close to the Lord, but I'm going to do
 my best. And that's when the presence of the Lord started showing up. I just was like,
 "Lord, this time is dedicated to you." And I would come and I would soak and I would journal
 and I would just say, "Lord, I just want to be with you." That's all the only reason why I'm here.
 This is not out of duty. This is not out of religious observation. This is about me wanting
 my heart to be satisfied by the things I know it's crying out for. And the Lord would show up.
 And I think this list that we're coming up with is works for both corporate and private
 encounters with the presence of the Lord.
 Yeah.
 Oh, for sure.
 I think, yeah, exactly.
 Coming hungry and coming from a place of thankfulness.
 I think whether you're doing that on your own in your, you know, in your house or whatever, whether
 you're doing that corporately, I think the difference with corporately is when you have a couple
 hundred people coming together hungry.
 Uh, again, it, it, the atmosphere just shifts really fast.
 I have a friend who's a conference speaker and he said, there's stories he only tells
 at conferences because the faith level on Sundays is so low.
 Oh, that's sad.
 He says, there's only stores I can tell at conferences because people have
 placed a value on being there, right?
 The Vin convenes himself.
 So their faith to believe the test of an is much higher.
 Yeah.
 And I was like, oh, that's a sad reflection on our Sunday services.
 Yeah, it really is.
 All right.
 My last suggestion on things that help in countering the presence of the Lord is
 humility.
 Good.
 When you think about the presence of the Lord and you think about your encounters with the
 presence of the Lord, no matter how strong they are, they all pale into comparison with being
 overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and becoming pregnant with the Messiah. I think we could agree.
 Yes.
 Right.
 Yes.
 So, I mean, you talk about experiencing the presence of the Lord, that just takes it to a whole other
 level. So I've often thought about Mary.
 I've thought about like, why why Mary?
 You know, why not her next door neighbor, Rhoda?
 You know, why not the girl in the other village?
 Rhoda, that well-known.
 No, I mean, I'm just saying like, why, what was it about Mary?
 Right.
 And I think there's something in Luke chapter one, you see,
 after Mary finds out what's happened in response to this, her prayer is,
 says this, "For God has been mindful of the humble state of his servant,
 and all generations will call me blessed from now on."
 I'm like, yeah, they, they really will.
 Yeah.
 But there was something about her humility, I think, that the Lord was like you.
 You would be an amazing incubator of the presence of the Lord.
 Right.
 And I'd actually trust you to raise the manifest presence of the Lord.
 I mean, it's phenomenal.
 Yeah.
 There's something.
 There's something so beautiful about the loneliness of the Lord.
 Do you think about God?
 Like how?
 I mean, literally he's the God of the universe.
 and yet he loves to dwell among the lowly. There's something about humility.
 And we're all beneath him. We're all beneath him. We're just, we're nothing. What is man that
 you're even mindful of him? And yet the lower we go in humbling ourselves, the more attractive
 we become to him. It's just mind-boggling. It really is. And I think that there's even
 something in that in terms of, I think where sometimes we go wrong or we miss it is God
 is doing something and we think somehow it's about us.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Yeah.
 So the Lord shows up in a service or whatever and it's about, oh man, God used me to do
 X or, you know, whatever.
 And I don't think it can be about that.
 I think it just has to be about God being God and bringing transformation and we just happen to be there.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah.
 There's three things that help.
 Give me two things that hinder the presence of the Lord.
 Well, I was kind of kind of edging towards that.
 I think one of them is control, like wanting to control the way God's moving or wanting to control what it looks like.
 Right.
 which, you know, it's just really funny, but we do try and control God or box God all the time,
 don't we? Right. And often that's just our fear of looking foolish or, you know,
 what would happen if God gets out of control? So we kind of want to maintain control.
 What would happen if God got out of control? Right. As if we could actually control him anyway.
 But yeah, totally. Yeah. What is control like in your own personal life? Like,
 I can think of control in a corporate sense that you got a pastor who, like Jeff said,
 one of the difficulties with the morning like this morning is we have confines in
 structures called church services. They're designed for our good, but what about when the
 Lord shows up and is like, "Hey, would you adore me for a little longer than you were planning?
 What are we going to do? What is having control issues look like in your personal life that would
 hinder the presence of the Lord?" Well, I suppose it's anything from even
 You had a plan for what the day looked like and the Lord's like, "Hey, come spend time with me."
 And it's like, "Oh, but I had this day perfectly planned and you fit in this nice little box over
 here on the left and giving that up." Sometimes it's dictating the terms of God's appearing.
 Like, "Lord, I was actually hoping that you wouldn't manifest to make me cry. Perhaps you could
 manifest and make me wealthy. That would be great. Our old Lord, you've shown up and you're
 bringing conviction. I was hoping you'd bring the prophetic. Yeah, you're talking to me about
 stuff that you want me to deal with, Drat. All right, so that's control. That makes sense.
 What's your second one? I think the second one is hotiness. Like just pride.
 Pride is really, it's really ugly to God, right? Psalms 138 verse 6 says, "He knows the proud from
 afar. It's interesting that he's far away from the road because he knows them from afar.
 I mean, the harshest words that the Lord spoke were reserved for the religious leaders of the law,
 the people whose knowledge had puffed up. I mean, one of the saddest verses in all the
 scripture is Jesus standing before the Pharisees and you study the scriptures in vain,
 and yet they testify about the one who's standing in front of you. They prided themselves
 in knowing the scriptures, but missing the one the scriptures testify about.
 Yeah.
 I'm just like, Lord, you know, I think the difficulty with both control and
 haughtiness is they're both the things that pass for decently in an order in
 most churches today.
 Oh, yeah, for sure.
 I mean, you put a shirt and a tie on control and haughtiness and it looks respectable.
 Yeah.
 I mean, yeah, I'm sorry.
 That's that's a great visual.
 Right.
 It's just fear.
 Just as fear masquerades as wisdom, so control and haughtiness masquerade as, you know, decent
 and in order.
 And I don't know.
 You know, I never like being critical about the church, but I just, I wonder what we're
 aiming at.
 You know, recently we got away as a senior leadership team just to think and pray about
 about grace in or in some direction.
 And I loved our time away.
 I loved our time of reflection.
 We just rolled some of that stuff out with our staff.
 We'll be rolling out to the church later.
 Just this whole value that we have on the presence
 of the Lord makes me so happy.
  </li><li>Yeah, me too.
  </li><li>Because it means the reason we come to church is for him.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Again, no disrespect to churches that have another vision.
 I think you need all sorts of churches
 to make the body full.
 But some people go to church because they want to be taught well.
 Some people go to church because they want to enjoy their worship.
 Some people want to go to church for the community or some people want to go to
 church for the outreach.
 None of those things are bad at all.
 That's just really not our focus.
 And I'm not saying we're better or worse.
 I'm just saying our goal and the reason we go to church is for him.
 Yeah, just to meet with him.
 It's primarily for him.
 And sure we benefit from that encounter with him.
 But our primary goal is to go and adore the Lord and out of that, everything else flows.
 Yeah.
 And I love that.
 I, that makes me feel like this is what I was built for.
 Yeah.
 Abandonment and adoration.
 So good.
 We don't want to just talk about the presence of Lord at Grace Center.
 We actually want to encourage you that the presence of the Lord is to go.
 Like you can take away.
 Take away food.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like the same presence I encountered this morning was the same presence I encountered
 20 something years ago in my in my apartment in Edinburgh.
 And I want to encourage you the things that I think just like three steps into the presence of the Lord.
 Number one is place of value on it.
 I know that sounds dumb, but I remember being at a conference.
 I remember I'm a part of this church back in Scotland.
 I remember going to a conference with friends of mine from the church that we were part
 of that wasn't pro-holy spirits.
 Now they were against the Holy Spirit.
 I just don't think they had a revelation of the stuff that we're talking about.
 But anyway, me and a couple of friends who go to this conference were John and Carolar
 there and the presence of the Lord is amazing.
 During ministry time, they're offering prayer for everybody.
 I say to my friends, "Are you going to come up and get prayer?"
 Their response shocked me.
 Their response is, "Why would I want what they have?"
 Wow, and I just realized oh you don't have a value on what I'm seeing yeah now I understood it probably look weird to them
 I probably looked strange. It does look weird sometimes for sure it does
 For sure absolutely, but lots of things in the Bible look strange. Yes on one side of Revelation
 Yes, like the king who had to go dip in the the Jordan seven times right?
 I'm sure that looked funny
 On that side of the revelation, but once he had dipped in the Jordan and brand new skin, it didn't look weird at all.
 Everything on one side of a revelation, I think is built to test the mind.
 God offends the mind to reveal heart.
 I think once you step over that, the trick is having a value for what's on the other side without objecting to the journey.
 Right.
 Right. Yeah. And just keeping your heart open to whatever it is that God is asking.
 I have a value and the value has to be on the Lord himself. I was thinking about all the times
 in scripture said in the power of the Lord was present to heal the sick. I love healing. You know,
 I love that. I love signs and wonders. I love prophetic ministry, but I never want those to be
 idols in place of the presence of the Lord. So yeah, all those things come out the presence of the
 Lord. But if we can desire the Lord's presence for the Lord, that's a great value to cultivate.
 Second thing, this escaped me for a long time is you can ask for his presence.
 I thought I was never going to experience the presence of the Lord because I couldn't afford
 a flight to Toronto. Right. And your church didn't look like that.
 Right. I thought there was this huge party over there and I can't go to it.
 I'm invited, but I can't get to it. And therefore I'm going to miss out on it.
 Right. And that's just not the kingdom of God at all.
 And in one sense, the Lord is not hindered by geography in another sense.
 He really loves geography.
 But I found that the Lord would come to me in Edinburgh and I had
 had incredible encounters.
 That's not to say I didn't get an impartation when I went to Toronto, but it is to say you
 can ask for his presence and have an expectation that he will show up for you.
 Yeah.
 And then number three, out of the expectation, create space for his presence.
 I think sometimes we ask and just think that God's just going to fit into our
 schedule. I think when we stop and create space, we make room for the answers we've asked for.
 Yes. So it's like, Lord, I'm going to ask for your presence. Okay, Lord, this Friday morning,
 we're just going to spend with you. Carve at the time, just soap, just pray, just rest,
 just be with him. And you will be astonished at what happens.
 So good, baby. Do you want to listen to this question? Sure. All right, this is a great question.
 This is from Katherine in California.
 She asks, "Dear Alan H.A., I've been listening to your podcast for a few months now,
 and I've enjoyed it so much and shared it with my husband.
 Your tales of the switch and everything Apple have been so fun,
 as I share all of those interests too.
 My husband even got me into Zelda Breath of the Wild.
 I'd just like to say, Katherine and Katherine's husband,
 you guys are clearly people gifted with brilliant tastes."
 Yes, indeed.
 Katherine continues, "I enjoyed your recent podcast on praying in tongues.
 My question is, how do you pray for someone in tongues?
 Do you just think of them and start praying in tongues?
 Do you say their name out loud and then start praying in tongues?
 Maybe these are silly questions and I'm getting wrapped up again in the left brain mechanics.
 Thanks so much for your advice with love from California, Kathy.
 Well, that's interesting.
 I don't know that I pray for other people in tongues.
 Really?
 Yeah, I usually pray for them in English.
 Do you?
 I pray for people in tongues all the time.
 Do you?
 Yeah.
 I don't know that I do. I pray on my own intungs. You know, I pray when I'm driving the car or
 during worship service or whatever. I guess I've prayed for the kids in tongues. I don't say their
 name though. I just pray in tongues. What about your when you're on prayer ministry team? I mean,
 I know we don't pray out loud in tongues because that's just, you know, weird, but often when I'm
 praying for some of the lay hands on them and I'm just praying, I'm praying in tongues,
 just gently beside them. Do you ever do that? No, not really. No, I usually pray in English.
 Well, given age, you can answer it.
 Go ahead, babe.
 Let me give you an answer.
 I literally do that.
 I just tend to think of the person.
 If I'm lifting them up in prayer and I just think of this person and usually
 start in English, Lord, I thank so much for Kathy, Lord.
 I just thank you for who she is and what she's going through.
 And then I'll just switch into tongues and in her seed for who, you know, you in this case,
 I'll just, I'll just start praying in tongues.
 And that's pretty much how I do it.
 I don't think I've given any other thought to it.
 I just trust that given God knows what I'm saying and God knows my heart and intent.
 I hope it's reaching the right destination.
 Okay.
 I think the kingdom is way simpler than we might imagine.
 Yeah.
 And I don't think that the Lord is sitting up there going, well, you did it this way and you did
 that way and I'm only honoring it that way.
 I think I just think God's so much bigger than that.
 He really is.

 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin, Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, an A.J.
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
