<p> AJ Jones.<br/>
 -Mallsier Jones.<br/>
 -Look out of our window and tell me what you see.
 -Oh, it's so beautiful and sunny and it's like 70-something degrees, like 72 or something.
 -This is what spring and Nashville should feel like.
 -This is what spring and Nashville feels like.
 -Yes, but last couple of weeks it's not felt like that.
 -Well, maybe it hasn't technically been spring.
 -I know, but look at this gorgeous, clear blue skies.
 -Sunny, sunny.<br/>
 -Right, sun.<br/>
 nice breeze. I love it.<br/>
 I'm considering camping with the children in the yard this evening.
 I'm not going to fight you for that.<br/>
 You mean you don't want to camp?<br/>
 Never.<br/>
 So strange.<br/>
 Are you not worried about coyotes knowing you to pieces a night?
 No.<br/>
 Why?<br/>
 How would they get in our tent?<br/>
 Well, isn't your tent just like thin mesh?
 What makes you think a coyote wants to come and not meet the pieces?
 I don't know.<br/>
 These are the things I think about when I think about
 the Grey Outdoors.<br/>
 (laughing)<br/>
 Not that suburban Tennessee is the Grey Outdoors,
 but you get my drift.
</p><ul>
  <li>How many coyotes have you seen in our backyard?
  </li><li>In my imagination, tons.
 And they all have M16s.
  </li><li>Oh, very creative.
  </li><li>Talk to me about this week.
  </li><li>It was a great week.
 We had Christupre at the school, which was lovely.
  </li><li>Love me some Christupre.
  </li><li>Really, really good.
 And then what?
 We just had a whole bunch of meetings.
  </li><li>So it was a relatively low, like low traffic, low activity.
  </li><li>It was.
  </li><li>Nobody in town.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Run off the mill week.
  </li><li>It was really nice.
  </li><li>Kids were in school.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And then you took the girl from C Cinderella.
 Talk to me about Cinderella.
 What did I miss?
  </li><li>What did you miss?
 Well, it was, it's, I was surprised at how good it is
 'Cause I feel like usually Disney tries to at least have some aspect of it that's really dark.
 Isn't it probably it's very nature a dark story?
 Well, Cinderella has no parents, but then no Disney princess has a mother.
 Go ahead and try and think of one single Disney princess that has a mother.
 They're all dead.
 And then the majority of them, their dad is dead too.
 But a couple of them have dads.
 So, you know, also in the, in the, I just made up those names.
 They had a mum and dad.
 Yeah.
 Who died at the beginning of the film.
 Well, that's true.
 There must be a Disney princess with a mother.
 Think of one.
 You have to the end of the podcast to come up with a Disney princess with a mother.
 All right.
 I'm feeling pressure.
 So anyway, you know, we obviously knew that going in, but, but great theme in it of courage and kindness.
 were the main things.
 And forgiveness, really, really good themes going through it.
 And really not dark.
 The girls were fine if the movie is at all dark.
 They'll both be in your lap and whatever they were fine.
  </li><li>They did not handle Nightmare on Elm Street,
 Parts 137 at all. - No, it was horrible.
 I mean, you should've seen them a little wimp still.
 (laughs)
 Abby, or Tia, did at one point when the Dad dies,
 when Cinderella's dad dies. Sorry, spoiler alert. But you knew already didn't you? Come on people.
 She looks at me and she goes to mummy. I think I might need to cry, which reminds me of when
 you say I think I might emote. So I was like, "Baby, do you need to sit with mummy for a minute?
 I think so, but I might still cry." And I was like, "That's okay, baby." So she cried.
 And then at the end, somebody else dies.
 It's like a diaphone.
 Well, Abby at the end said, why did all the adults die?
 And I was like, yeah.
 So I said to her, well, you know, no Disney princess has a mom.
 And often they don't have dads for some reason.
 That just seems to be a theme with the Disney princess stories.
 And Abby goes, why would they do that with kids stories?
 I was like, excellent point.
 I'm well made.
 Seven year old.
 So it was kind of funny, but anyway, very well done.
 Um, clever.
 It was just really good.
 And then we tend to tidy our house.
 Well, that felt like too much like hard work.
 So we just left it in the squalor that we found it.
 Well, it's not quite the squalor that we found it.
 You did a great job of tidying away a bunch of stuff that has basically been
 sitting on our counter for like two months.
 Say that again, but louder.
 You did a great job.
 been down. So that was great. You know, less clutter, more better.
 So less clutter, more better. Okay, I'm going to gloss over that grammar.
 You spoke at church this morning. How did that happen? I did. Well, poor
 sweet Jeff called yesterday and wasn't feeling up to snuff. And
 what's it like coming up with a message in less than 24 hours?
 It wasn't hard because I already had something that the Lord was sort
 of brewing in my heart, although I was going to speak at an emanate tomorrow. So I might
 have to come up with something new for tomorrow. But yeah, so when he phoned, I was like, oh,
 I could easily do that. I mean, if that would be helpful. So yeah, it was, it wasn't hard.
 I didn't feel stressed about that at all.
 I'll put a link to your sermons so people can watch it if they want it on YouTube.
 Cool.
 And then all our awesome students left on average this week.
  </li><li>They did.
 They're doing this stuff all over the world.
  </li><li>No, no, we have a team in Nashville
 that stayed behind to bless our city.
 We have a team in Georgia and Mississippi.
 We have a team in Scotland.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And a team that just arrived in Uganda.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Which is amazing.
 If you would like to follow along with our students,
 if you go to schoolsupernaturallife.org/blog,
 you can read all about their stories
 and I'll put a link to that in the show notes as well.
 That was fun sending our students off.
 Yeah, and they were so stoked to go to and it was great because all of their
 travel worked out great, no trouble with customs or anything like that.
 So they're good to go.
 So what do we do while the students are on outreach?
 We try and get caught up on all the things that haven't been getting done
 while they've been here.
 Like reading applications.
 Like reading applications.
 Yeah, so we're going to get out a whole bunch of acceptance letters this week and that kind of stuff.
 So if you've been thinking about putting an application, put it in now, you'll hear back faster.
 Finish those apps, people.
 I have started drinking something called Slim and Sassy, which is an essential oil that you put in your water.
 It smells like greeno.
 It tastes like greeno.
 I mean, it's just hideous.
 I basically taste feel like I am drinking hippie toilet cleaner in my water.
 So how's lemon sassy going?
 I can tell the sassy part is working.
 The sassy part is definitely working.
 It's supposed to like bump up your metabolism or something.
 And do you know any difference?
 Yeah, I do.
 Cause I need to nap last.
 I should probably confess that I ate some things yesterday.
 I shouldn't have, but somehow I still lost weight.
 We were at the theater.
 It was unavoidable.
 It was my destiny.
 It was your density.
 It was my density.
 I have a twizzler weakness.
 You know, this was an interesting week in terms of like Monday.
 I started watching John Paul Jackson's memorial service.
 And then I went straight into the Apple Watch announcement.
 So it was like Monday was a roller coaster of emotions.
 So for those of you who don't know, John Paul Jackson,
 John Paul Jackson lived here in the States and was part of the Kansas City Profits in
 1984, kind of the prophetic, broke back onto the scene and Mike Bickle had joy of
 pastoring all these prophets over in his church.
 John Paul was one of them.
 He later moved out to Anaheim, California, where he traveled and worked alongside John
 Wimber of the vineyard movement.
 And then later was in Dallas, Fort Worth, spent some time in New England and then went
 back to Dallas, Fort Worth.
 But Jampo is one of the best teachers on the prophetic, the Art of Hearing God's voice,
 and on dream interpretation, a remarkable gift set with a huge emphasis on godly character.
 And one of my biggest inspirations in the prophetic, so watching his memorial with people
 saying amazing things about them, gave me a lot to reflect on really.
 Start thinking about legacy, start thinking about the impact that we have on people's
 start thinking about the impact he had on my life, for example, and we only met a few times.
 But all the impact I received from him was not from me meeting him. It was from listening
 to his CDs, his tapes, and reading his books.
 Right.
 It makes you think about how important that stuff is. It can feel like publishing your
 stuff is self-important, but really it's resourcing people that could never possibly
 get to where you are.
 Yeah, it isn't an interesting battle, isn't it?
 Whenever you write anything, whenever you release a teaching, whenever you write an article
 or a book or invite to speak somewhere, there's always that little thing in your heart where
 you're like, "Why am I doing this?"
 And I think probably to be effective in ministry, you have to get over that thing and settle
 it once for all and just be obedient to God.
 I'm just listening to people reflect on John Paul's life.
 The thing that caught my attention was how his friend said for years,
 John Paul didn't think he was prophetic, which is hysterical when you think
 he's one of the most prophetic voices of, you know, our generation.
 And yeah, somehow the devil managed to convince him he wasn't prophetic.
 Right.
 And so I was thinking about that in our lives, you know, how the devil will often
 come along and convince us that we're not what we clearly are, which is why you
 need community around you, so that other people can tell you what you are.
 Exactly.
 John Pollard does great saying he would say if you have to tell people who you are, they'll never believe you.
 But if they tell you who you are, you'll never convince them otherwise.
 I think that's one of the beauties of living in community and the joy of the local church.
 Being able to call each other to life and that kind of stuff.
 For sure.
 For sure.
 What do you think about the Apple Watch?
 It's beautiful.
 Be out of it.
 Be out of it.
 Are you having a stroke?
 It's so pretty.
 Yes, I very much like it.
  </li><li>It's funny, you know, watching lots of people's opinions
 on it, it's remarkable how similar people's reactions are
 to the first iPhone.
 You know, there's one group who are like,
 you're just gonna have so beautiful,
 it's gonna be amazing, another group who are like,
 "I don't really get it.
 I already have a watch."
 It already does everything my cell phone does.
 And that's pretty much what people said
 when the first iPhone came out.
 They're like, "Eh, pretty much does what my Palm Trio does."
 Do you remember Palm Trios, incidentally?
 No.
  </li><li>Right.
 (laughs)
 Do they still exist?
  </li><li>So it'll be interesting to see what happens
 when they come out.
 No, they don't.
  </li><li>I, well, you know, I've wanted a watch since last fall.
 So, and then right before I was gonna spend
 my birthday money on a watch,
 they announced the Apple Watch.
  </li><li>Right.
 And I'm glad you waited.
  </li><li>I'm super excited about that watch.
 Yeah.
 I love it.
 I love so much about it.
 I love that you can change the face.
 I just, I love that you can draw little pictures on your phone and send them to people.
 I love everything.
 I love the health and fitness stuff of it.
 I wonder if you'll answer your phone more.
 Well, I think because my wrist will ring probably, it's probably going to,
 it's probably going to be really good for our marriage when I'm walking around in
 grocery stores and don't feel my butt vibrating with my phone in my back pocket.
 Speaking about your butt vibrating, I'm talking about some of my favorite things.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Naughty.
  </li><li>This week we were gonna talk about happiness.
 And I don't know whether it just goes to the sun is out.
 And I've been singing Pharrell's "Happy Song."
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; 'Cause I'm happy &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Thank you &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; You have to sing every episode &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Doo doo doo doo doo doo &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 Go ahead, I'll be the background singer.
  </li><li>And we're done.
 But I wanted to talk about happiness.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So, talk to me about what makes you happy.
 My kids make me happy now forgive me for selling like a robot but why do your kids make you happy.
 Because because they just do they're so cute and they're adorable and they just.
 I don't know they're just living life I think I can learn a lot about happiness from them they don't get thrown by the details they just sort of.
 Shift and then they find out something else to play with.
 Let me ask you a question.
 Yeah.
 Are you, do they give you happiness in the moment or do they give you happiness upon reflection
 of the moment?
 It depends.
 Some moments they don't give me happiness.
 Some moments I'm just exhausted.
 But overall, yes, I'm absolutely happy thrilled.
 Were you as happy before you had children?
 Um, probably in different moments.
 I suppose it's a different kind of deal.
 I don't know how to explain it.
 I have a different kind of joy in watching them than, than in just like other aspects
 of life.
 But I don't remember being unhappy before I had kids.
 No, I wasn't unhappy.
 So it's not like there was us, you know, a joy component missing from not having kids.
 Right.
 But when you had kids, another level of joy came along,
 is that what you're saying?
  </li><li>Yeah, I think because it's another level of love
 and therefore another level of joy.
  </li><li>What else makes you happy?
  </li><li>Sushi.
  </li><li>Wait, let's just pause right there.
 You go from the joy that the children bring you
 to dead fish.
  </li><li>Forget about raw fish, you, you baby,
 you're the one.
  </li><li>Then what we're talking to Sushi,
 where did your love of Sushi come from?
  </li><li>Oh, I had some friends
 when I was a lot younger, like 1920, that sort of in that age group that loved sushi.
 And so I started going and having sushi with them.
 And it became like a, I mean, really for many, many years, I would have sushi two or three
 times a week.
 I made my own sushi at home.
 Well, if our listeners have never eaten sushi before, what do you suggest they start with?
 Well, first of all, go to a good sushi restaurant.
 a gas station or a grocery store. You will not get good sushi. No, I mean, you know,
 Whole Foods has relatively okay sushi, but I think people who already like sushi eat
 it and enjoy it. But if it's your first attempt at sushi, good heavens no, like go to a great
 sushi place. What do you suggest they start with?
 You mean if they want to do raw fish?
 Yeah.
 Something like a...
 Salmon roll?
 A salmon roll or a tuna roll, nothing like killer spicy.
 But it is the thought that freaks you out.
 Yeah, sometimes people get freaked out over the texture.
 Oh no, the texture is amazing.
 I know.
 But I mean, that's the thing.
 If you have high quality fish, like if you're at a good place, the texture is great.
 Are you not having good sushi?
 Chewy sushi.
 Run away.
 People run away.
 Our first ever date was a sushi.
 Well, not that's not true.
 Our first ever date was at some--
 A Thai place.
 A Thai?
 With Mother Cafe, yeah.
 No, no, no.
 That wasn't our first date.
 With Stuart and Lily.
 I'm not coming out as a date.
 That was a chaperone event that was a train wreck.
 Our first date was on Valentine's Day.
 But that was at Thai places, while at Jasmine.
 It wasn't Jasmine's.
 It was right next to on the Queensway.
 It was right next to where Starbucks and chapters was.
 That was Jasmine's.
 But it wasn't Ty, was it?
 It totally was Ty.
 OK.
 I'm not going to argue with it.
 Our second date, then, was sushi.
 It was.
 And I didn't know what to do.
 You didn't pour a little love.
 I think I ordered your food, didn't I?
 Right.
 And then proceeded to show me how to mix the wasabi into the--
 Into the soy.
 And then proceeded to show me how to eat it.
 Yeah.
 I don't have a paper.
 I always feel bad for people that try and bite sushi rolls in half because the whole
 point is that you're trying to get all those flavors together.
 So you just have to not care about what it looks like and try and get the whole thing
 in it once.
 But you're also telling me that raw fish makes you happy.
 Oh, I love sushi.
 It makes me happy.
 If I think about sushi, I just get happy.
 I might be a little bit.
 Do you think that it's the sushi itself or the memories associated by eating good sushi
 with good friends or a suggest sushi on its own.
 Well, I suppose it could be both.
 I don't typically go and eat sushi with people I don't want to hang out with.
 True.
 So, yeah, what makes you happy?
 While I have a sneaking suspicion as to what your answer will be, surely there's other
 things you could talk about.
 That's exactly what it's thinking.
 Yeah, I think there's so many things that made me happy.
 I have an enormous joy bucket and lots of things can go in that joy bucket.
 So I love when things are done excellently.
 So I love being around people of excellence.
 I love being in environments that are crafted excellently.
 So some of my happiest moments have been staying in exquisite hotels.
 Yes.
 Like just the atmosphere of being in a lobby or in the suite or you know of a really beautiful
 hotel.
 And I'm not doing anything that makes me happy.
 Eating at a really fine restaurant that has thought behind it.
 Honestly, that's why I get so much joy from using Apple products because everything about
 all of their products is intentional.
 I feel that when I use them and so there's a joy there, a genuine joy.
 I love, I drive great satisfaction and great happiness from finishing tasks.
 I drive great satisfaction, happiness and joy from being with people I love, people who
 who are not a draw, but people who are life giving.
 So I just, I love that.
 I love some of the times I've cherished the most
 of being with friends that you, you know,
 just love to be with and you may be catch up with
 and you haven't seen in a while, that's just joy.
 And then being alone, I love being alone.
 Well, no, let's change it from being alone.
 I love uninterrupted time.
 large expenses of time that are not going to be interrupted.
 I do too.
 If you can add a latte into there as well.
 Right.
 The my only problem with large, uninterrupted amounts of time is I miss
 muggins within about an hour.
 You know, I also love what airports.
 Yeah, you're strange like that.
 I really am.
 I love always like them.
 Always love the airports.
 just happy in airports. I don't know why.
 You used to drive great joy out of knowing how everything worked for us to
 travel the way that we did, you know,
 upgrades and the different points and, you know,
 basically knowing how to work the system and all that kind of stuff.
 You know,
 after I was me, I joy is teaching. Yeah.
 I really enjoy teaching. Yeah. Me too.
 I was thinking this morning, I'm like,
 I think the reason it's not stressful to find out the day before that you're
 going to teach is I have so much fun doing it.
 Right.
 So it's not.
 It's just like, okay, God, I know you're always talking.
 I know you want to say something.
 So this is fun.
 You know, there's a brain exercise you do.
 And Christine will be able to tell us more about this.
 But when you remember or when you talk and express about things that give you joy, it
 activates joy in the brain.
 So I feel really joyful right now.
 Perhaps my voice doesn't suggest that.
 I feel really joyful right now.
 I love having one-on-one conversations with my girlfriends and stuff like that.
 I love double dates.
 I love when we go to Wild Ginger and have sushi and play Monopoly deal.
 I love hosting people at our house.
 Yeah.
 I love cooking for people.
 I love cooking for people.
 Do you really?
 and I love teaching people to cook.
 Everybody are house tonight, dinners on AJ.
 No, but I mean, I get really excited about being able to pass on something that's a passion,
 but it's also a fun passion and knowing you're equipping somebody to be able to do something.
 So I love teaching people how to cook or just having people over and cooking them something
 that would speak to them that I thought about them, got anything.
 I love technology.
 Yes, you do.
 I, you know, what I, I don't know if this is perverse, but I love the fact that the nicest piece of technology you can buy today will be redundant within five years.
 Why do you love that?
 I don't know why I love that because I know that in five years, the amount of joy I'm experiencing now will be replicated in five years time.
 So I, you know, I need a new laptop.
 I'm thinking to get a new laptop and I'm realizing that no matter which laptop I buy.
 It's absolutely in five years.
 And the one I'm going to buy five years later is going to be so much better.
 Right.
 I just love the constant rate of change and I love all that stuff.
 That's really interesting, babe, because most people don't actually enjoy change that much.
 I think we quite like change, don't we?
 I do.
 We've had a lot of it in our life.
 But it's probably either have to like it or you're just going to not like a whole
 bunch of stuff about what God does and how he does it.
 You know what else makes me happy?
 By seeing the genuine anointing of God operating people's lives.
 Whether that's someone dancing or somebody speaking or somebody prophesying
 or somebody performing miracles.
 I just love that.
 I love seeing the kindness of God at work in people's lives.
 Yeah, same.
 You know, we've got friends who you can see, they know they've got to operate in their
 life when they have people over for dinner.
 They've got a real gift of hospitality.
 Mm-hmm.
 And it's amazing to watch that.
 Yeah.
 I drive as much joy from that as watching somebody call it the secret to somebody's heart.
 I love it.
 Yeah, because they're operating in what they're meant to do.
 It's quite amazing.
 You know what else I love?
 What?
 I love being still.
 Oh.
 Of course I love you.
 Yeah, I love you.
 Thanks, baby.
 But I love being around people who are still and I love being still.
 And by that, I mean people who are content to be themselves and are not trying to fake
 a version of themselves.
 I just love the piece that comes with that.
 It's amazing.
 Do you know what I'm happy about with this weather?
 Are screened in porch?
 -Mm-hmm. Coffee and a screen in porch. What could be better?
 -What are some of your go-to things to do to raise your
 joy level when you're not feeling joyful or happy?
 -If there's an ability to be creative, that would help me a lot,
 like draw or even if it's on my iPad or, you know,
 whatever, some sort of creativity or go for a walk,
 Going for a walk helps me a lot.
 Does it really?
 Yeah.
 Just getting moving.
 I don't know why.
 It just does.
 I think probably exercise, though,
 does something with your endorphins.
 I'm sure that's written somewhere.
 I'm sure.
 Somewhere it says something about that.
 I find that if I can get away and be quiet
 and connect with God, my joy level returns.
 I find that being created doesn't help me
 because I just get frustrated at how uncreative
 I feel at that point.
 Oh.
 Well, it makes sense.
 What about people?
 Don't you find that people are a great source of joy?
 Yes, I do.
 So if you need joy, do you not find that connecting with people brings you joy?
 Sometimes yes and sometimes no.
 If I'm depleted, like depleted, depleted, I just need time with the Lord so that I can
 get back to being buoyant. Right. And then then people are good. But yeah, if I'm just sort of
 not joyful slash board, do you know what I mean? Like just at that like, oh, I don't feel like
 down in the dumps, I just feel like meh, then yeah, if I can get around some friends, totally,
 I love it. Makes me feel full. I'm right on the border between an extrovert and an introvert.
 sometimes I don't know what I am.
 You're a fine piece of Canadian engineering is where you are.
 Right, baby.
 We have two things we'd like to leave you with.
 First thing is our school is supernatural life.
 Yes.
 Talk about joy.
 One of the most joygiving things is being able to impart to other people.
 All the gods given you.
 And we have a two year school.
 First year, both years run eight months long.
 They start in September.
 We graduate our students in April.
 And the first year, it's just an incredible opportunity for you to come and learn all about the love of God.
 His excitement for you, his love for you.
 It's an amazing opportunity to set aside time and receive healing, even in areas you didn't know you needed healing.
 They're the best types.
 It's a great time to get eight months of training into you, will teach you how to prophesy, how to hear God's voice,
 how to heal the sick, how to preach, how to be powerful and courteous at the same time.
 And then we'll send you an outreach somewhere in the world.
 Well, and you also build incredible community going through a school, you know, with all
 these other people, but you know, typically the schools range somewhere between, you know,
 40 to 70 students.
 So it's not a massive school and it's funny watching now.
 You see them, you still see students hanging out in friend groups from their, you know,
 schools, which is quite fun too.
 And then if you've already graduated school, you already know the joy of doing school
 and we'd love you to come back for a second year. Launching this September is our second year
 School of Supernatural Life. Come on, panel. And we'd love to bring you back for more of what
 you had and also drawn out the greatness that's in you as a leader. We'll stuck up a passion
 you to be a leader, someone who loves the word and is equipped more than you can imagine.
 If you, if all of that sounds fascinating to you, head over to schoolofsupernaturallife.org
 for all the information and how to apply on that. As you said, if you apply now, the chances are this week
 we'll read your application and get badges quickly as we can.
 If you started your application already, because I know you're out there, go ahead and finish it
 so that we can get those read and get some information back to you.
 The second thing we'd like to talk about is the more conference. Running May 15th to May 16th,
 as if Friday night all day Saturday, we have the joy of hosting Graham Cook and Jonathan David and
 Melissa Helser. Graham Cook is just one of the most prolific writers out there today,
 originally hailing from Southampton, England now lives in California with his wife Teresa.
 Those two will be here with us that weekend. Graham will be ministering. Graham is a prophet,
 a teacher, an author, a man of incredible wisdom. He was here at our church five years ago and was
 absolutely astonishing. We'd love you to come and spend a weekend with Graham. Jonathan David and
 Melissa are from North Carolina. They're worship leaders. They've just been signed to Bethel music
 and they have penned some of the great worship anthems of this season and we're excited that
 they're coming to lead worship. You can find information about that at musthavemore.com.
 Yeah, it's going to be amazing. And it is filling out pretty fast. We're already close to half full
 because our sanctuary is not huge. So if you're thinking about coming, now is a great time to
