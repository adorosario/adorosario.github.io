<p> AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Episode 56 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Let's keep up with them.<br/>
 What did we do this week?<br/>
 Well, let's see.<br/>
 Aminate got canceled on Monday.<br/>
 Let's talk about canceling Aminate.<br/>
 Okay, it was raining.<br/>
 Which coming from a land where all I knew was rain sounds preposterous.
 Rain.<br/>
 But here's what we've discovered from living in Nashville.
 Roads flood.<br/>
 Roads do flood.<br/>
 So we're not used to rain or any heavy weather.
 We're just used to sun.<br/>
 So when it does rain or when it does snow--
</p><ul>
  <li>We meaning, "nash-viliens."
  </li><li>Yeah, there's no infrastructure to cope with those things.
  </li><li>No, but then there's also lots of low spots and roads
 that become more passable by canoe than by car.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Quickly.
  </li><li>We hate canceling anything.
  </li><li>Yes, it's very frustrating.
  </li><li>But when the national weather system states
 that it's a flood advisory, it just seems sensible
 that we listen to the Uber geeks that are paid by the government to watch the weather.
 Say National Weather System again.
 National Weather System.
 Well, hi.
 I don't know. It just sounded very ScottishWell, 
 the reason I'm doing it like that is I'm worried I'm going to say Nashville Weather System.
 Oh, so I'mSo 
 I'mI'
 mI'
 m announcing it.
 Okay.
 Announcing it.
 You're pronouncing it.
 Is that right?
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 Now, Zebra's all conscious.
 Let's talk about something closer to my heart than the weather.
 Let's talk about apple watch apple watches.
 I got mine first.
 It's very important world that you know that age you got her apple watch.
 And why because the Lord loves me.
 Are you seeing the Lord loves me slightly less? Yes.
 Obviously.
 I'm secure in the father's love.
 You did.
 I think that's probably because your model was less popular than mine.
 I don't know how that's possible because my watch is really sexy no undoubtedly your watch is beautiful tell everybody what kind of watch you got i got the.
 Sport one with the white band thirty eight millimeter yes and i got the forty two millimeter space grey sport and tell him how we ended up with them it turns out that with our hsa if you get a heart wait wait wait wait wait what's an hsa.
 Health savings account which is what we have through the work.
 If you're not American because we pay for our health care here even though we have insurance,
 some people have what's called a health savings account. It's a bank account that the IRS
 lets you put money in tax-free that you can spend on qualified eligible medical expenses.
 Well it turns out a heart rate monitor which the Apple Watch has a top line heart rate monitor
 qualifies as one. So we were trying to think like we had no room in our budget for an Apple Watch
 let alone two Apple Watches, but we have, you know, quite a bit of money sitting in our health
 savings account because we're fairly healthy. We don't tend to have surgeries or anything like
 that. And we put money into each one. But on closer look at the IRS guidelines, as AJ said,
 a health monitor is a qualified eligible expense. That's right. And consumer reports just rated
 Apple Watch as good as the top rated
 heart rate monitor, which is awesome.
 Which is awesome. So that's how we ended up with them.
 And what's your experience with them so far?
 Everybody's asking what I think about it.
 It monitors my heart well.
 (laughs)
 It's way more fun now that you have yours
 because we can send each other little
 tricky messages and draw things and send them
 to one another and send your heartbeat and all that.
 Because I was only able to do that with Carol
 before you got yours.
 Right. And I think I want to write something
 about this on the blog because all of that sounds frivolous and silly. But there is something
 incredibly intimate about doing that. I'm not making that up. I'm not, am I?
 No, it's quite cute. I like it when I'm running at the gym or I've been away from me for an hour
 an hour and a half and all of a sudden I can feel your heartbeat on my wrist. Like,
 "Oh, you're thinking about me?" And I was. See? It reminds me quite a lot of when I got the first
 iPhone. And when I got it, it wasn't available for sale anywhere outside of America. We lived in
 Canada. So having bought it, there wasn't much we could do with it.
 However,
 other than drive to the border with John and Carol,
 right. So you couldn't use the phone part of the iPhone,
 but all the other features you could. And even then it was very limited.
 The app store hadn't been invented yet,
 but the care that was taken in the apps that were on it was,
 was brilliant. And I also think that they,
 I don't know if this was their by design or whether this is just the way it
 happened. But because it was a new metaphor for interacting with computers and data and
 all that sort of stuff, there was no click, there was no right click, there was just all
 the swipe and tap and pinch and you know, pinch to zoom and all this sort of stuff. It took
 a while for your, what's it called? Muscle learning? Muscle memory.
 Muscle memory to adopt the new ways of interacting with device. I would say that's exactly what
 I'm going through with the Apple Watch. Like you get it, you think you know how to interact
 with it because you've been trained on an iPhone and iPad, but it is a little different.
 It is, yeah, it's more than a little different, but give it a couple of days and you're totally
 used to it and it makes sense.
 Yeah.
 You know, it's very, again, when you had the first iPhone, it was easy to see not only
 how cool it was now, but it was very easy to see how awesome it was going to be in a
 couple of years.
 I'd say that's the same thing with the, with the watch.
 Yeah.
 And then also the exercise app, those little rings, they definitely motivate you to move.
 Write the gamification of making you move i don't want to comment on that too much because i'm only seven days in.
 So i don't want to wax lyrical about how awesome is and how it's changed my life but it has changed last seven days yes right but you keep going out for a run so that you have all of your rings completed right.
 And that's just probably complete a finisher but it will be interesting how i can tell you i don't care about the green ring you're never gonna not care about the green ring because you always want all of your things completed.
 i'm a complete your finisher tia our five year old had a birthday and is now six year old she is
 and she's the cutest six year old ever she got a six year old tattoo for birthday the lord supper
 down her back looks amazing yes but like with little my little pony characters because there's rainbow
 bright yeah just sitting beside jesus beautiful thing i found six year olds is excited by anything
 in this case she was excited by having waffles and bed she was she normally like it's one of our
 traditions. We have a couple different family traditions. So you get to pick where you're
 going to go for your birthday lunch or dinner with the family and you get to pick what you're
 having for breakfast in bed. And so she the night before said, "I want you to make me
 a muffin." She pointed at me and then she pointed across the table at Daddy and said,
 "You will make me waffles and a strawberry and banana smoothie." And I was like, "This
 awesome because I'd already made them up and so I got to sleep in while you made breakfast.
 I got up early and made waffles.
 You did a great job.
 So that came up with a name I might.
 Cara Sona this morning was incredible.
 It was awesome.
 I was still going to talk about one more thing.
 Oh, cool.
 Sorry.
 I apologize.
 It's okay.
 We went to the Rainforest Cafe and you know it's really not the best food ever.
 You kind of could just go for the animatronic animals.
 MJ didn't enjoy the fact that we were sidded right next to the tigers.
 And so when they came to life, he dove into your arms and started screaming.
 So we had to move over by the fish tank so that we could eat without our son experiencing
 trauma.
 Yeah, he didn't get the thunder and lightning storm that happens every half an hour.
 No, he just totally, he kept saying, I scared, I scared.
 It was so sad.
 Very sad.
 It was, but the fish were a much better place to be sitting.
 taking a fish at amazing fish tacos twice this week.
 So you say?
 Yeah, you didn't like them.
 I didn't.
 I ate at Sapphire's on Wednesday, had their fish tacos, which were superb, influenced
 my wife today to go back and have them with me.
 Did they taste the same to you today as they did that you?
 Admittedly, they weren't as good as they were on Wednesday, but they were within 10%
 of their goodness.
 Did you want to comment about Grace and her this morning?
 Yes.
 Okay, comment away.
 So this morning was awesome at church.
 Jeff, of course, was speaking and, you know,
 first service was great.
 We went into second service and Jeff,
 when he was supposed to start speaking,
 just stood there and started crying.
 And was obviously just hearing the Lord on some stuff
 and waited and waited.
 And then he basically started addressing the group
 and saying, you know, I feel like the Lord wants
 to kind of administer to those of you
 that feel like you're lonely.
 And like God doesn't see you or man doesn't see you.
 Right.
 And so he explained the whole thing and then got people to stand up.
 And there was tons of people standing.
 It was really powerful.
 Oh, it was amazing.
 And, and then, you know, all the team just spread out and started praying for people.
 And it was great.
 And then Christine got up and sang opera over everybody.
 She did.
 She sang.
 And then you had type you started typing out declarations from Isaiah 61.
 I started typing furiously because I felt like the Lord said, "You know,
 be really good if you made some declarations about who you are." So I was like, "Okay,
 well, what do you want me to write?" And he said, "I say 61." So I jumped up and typed all that out.
 You're so speedy that you got all those declarations up and we did them as a church, which was awesome.
 And then we kind of did many fire tunnels as people left, like tunnels of blessing and everybody
 got prayer on the way out, which was so awesome. I love our church. It was fun. All right, our main
 topic for this week. I want to talk about favor. Okay, I thought it was going to be fish tacos again.
 Well, I want to talk about favor because of three things. One, listen to Josh and Sarah Parsons
 talk last week. And if you didn't get chance to listen to Josh and Sarah's message from last week,
 go to alanaj.com/55 and you can listen to their message. Incredible podcast last week. I loved
 interviewing them, but they were talking about the role that favor played in them stepping into
 their destiny. And then I was going to speak on favor, emanate, but I got canceled, so I never did.
 And then this morning listening to two people in our church, Tinkin' Sam, who are about to be
 sent out from our church to Australia, again, listening to them talk about favor. I was just like,
 "Man, favor is this incredible thing that attracts ridiculous blessing to you." And it opens doors
 that you would never dream existed. And it ends up giving you this success that's completely
 unmerited. You didn't do anything to deserve it. And anyway, I wanted to talk about that. It's
 long been a fascination of mine thinking about favor, talking about favor, listening to people
 teach on favor, that sort of stuff. And so that's what I wanted to talk about.
 Cool.
 How would you describe favor, H.E. Jones? What would you say favor is?
 I think it's like walking around with a light shining on you that highlights you to other
 other people all the time.
  </li><li>That's a good way of putting it.
 You know one of the biggest misconceptions about favor
 is that if favor is on your life,
 then your circumstances are always gonna be amazing.
  </li><li>Right, everything will be perfect if you have favor.
  </li><li>And if you think like that,
 you're always gonna think you don't have favor.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Because favor isn't dependent on your circumstances at all.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So if you look at Joseph, you look at Esther,
 you look at Daniel, you look at Ruth,
 Like the backdrop of their life was terrible.
 Yes.
 It didn't seem like favor HQ at all, but in the midst of the
 circuit circumstances, the light that you were talking about comes
 along, rests upon them and favor is given.
 Favorite follows them.
 So I want to encourage you that you're the circumstances, no matter
 where you are when you're listening to this right now, your
 circumstances are simply the background or the backdrop for God's
 favor to appear on.
 So don't discount favor not being available to you because your circumstances are difficult.
 Would you think it's true to say that favor is a positional reality, but I mean, it's something you have to step into.
 Like you as children of God have favor.
 Absolutely.
 But you kind of have to partner with favor.
 Absolutely.
 And believe that it's there as opposed to me.
 I'm mud.
 Do you know what I mean?
 I totally know what you mean.
 Yeah.
 Let me tell you how I understood favor.
 The first time I understood a favor was a listen to, and this must have been 2000, 2001 maybe,
 I listened to a word that Graham Cook gave to a church in Australia about the favorable
 year of the Lord from Isaiah 61.
 So I wasn't at that church, I wasn't there, I just found his message I think from the
 Elijah list or something and I was reading it and I was thinking this is the most profound
 thing I think I've ever read.
 Like, you know, it was Graham Cook just being Graham.
 So I read this prophetic word.
 It was so incredible.
 And I just thought, this is an entirely new way of living.
 And so I read it.
 I tried to practice what he said.
 And but basically it's exactly what you said that favor has always been there for us as
 children of God.
 It's just I never knew to look for it.
 And the Lord came to me and said, Hey, Alan, if you want to live, actually, the Lord came and gave me this
 prophetic word, one of the best prophetic words I've ever had.
 We said, Hey, Alan, just so you know, the rest of your life, all you need to know is that your life is marked by
 kindness goodness in the favor of God.
 So cool.
 I was like, that's amazing.
 And I was thinking incorrectly that that meant my life now would be
 completely free of problems.
 But actually in that month that he gave me that word, I had so many
 situations that just rose up.
 And in those situations, the Lord was like, this is your opportunity
 to look for favor.
 Like you can be overwhelmed by the circumstances have come up or you can
 say favor, where are you hiding?
 And you will find my favor.
 like in Psalm 23, it's a surely goodness of mercy.
 We'll follow you all the days of your life.
 Well, if something's following you, you can't see it.
 You actually have to stop, pause, turn around,
 look for it and then you see it.
 And that's what I learned about favor that,
 oh, actually God's favor is available
 in any circumstance to change any circumstance.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's really good, babe.
  </li><li>Thanks, that's how I got into it.
 I think when Graham was here a couple of weeks ago
 at the More Company, he happened to say something like,
 favor is just what you said.
  </li><li>Favorite supposed to be the norm for the children of God.
 It isn't meant as a season of your life,
 it's supposed to be a lifestyle.
 I think probably one of the biggest misconceptions
 that people might have,
 or maybe the second biggest misconception,
 'cause I've always said the first one,
 is that people think they can earn favor.
  </li><li>Right, and you can't?
  </li><li>No, and in fact, the more you try and curry favor
 with someone, the worse it usually gets for you.
 So I'm sure you've all had circumstances
 where you've been in an interaction with somebody
 that you really want to impress,
 the more you try and impress them, the worse it gets. I certainly have fallen to that mistake
 many times. In Galatians, twice Paul writes, and he basically says, "Stop trying to earn favor.
 You just can't." That begs the question, if you can't earn favor, where do you get a favor? I think
 I used to think that favor was like luck. It was random. It was like a lottery. Some people had
 favor. Some people don't. Did you used to think like that? Did I used to think that some people
 people had favorance.
 Well, yeah, I probably did.
 Or just from looking at the outside.
 Yeah.
 Were you ever in this situation where you felt like you didn't have favor and you could
 see other people being prospered?
 Yeah.
 What did that look like?
 Was that ugly?
 Well, I would say there was a fair amount of orphaning out going on.
 You know, yeah, for sure.
 I can remember seasons where I was like, uh, hi.
 Like, when did I become the ugly stepchild in this scenario?
 Where's my favor?
 Where's my golden ticket?
 Right.
 And what do you think that is just a misunderstanding of what favor is a misinterpretation of circumstances right you know it's it's funny in observing other people's lives you always think that.
 Will you only really see the good stuff because that's what we talk about and so great so other people talking about their lives it can seem like.
 Oh my gosh they're just jumping from one favorite floating stone to another and you don't see the behind the scenes stuff right you don't see process but in yourself all you see is the process and you know.
 rarely see or you know the other stuff seems fleeting.
 My definition of favor is a gift that God grants to someone else on your behalf.
 A gift that God grants to someone else on your behalf, please do explain.
 Okay, so let's say I started a new job and I'm working with a team of people I've never
 met before.
 I've got a boss who's interviewed me but I've been hired.
 For me to have favor means that God has to go ahead of me and grant me favor in the eyes
 of my boss and my colleagues.
 Yes.
 So as a gift to me, he gives me favor in their eyes, which is a completely different paradigm
 because usually gifts are given to us, but they're given to somebody else for our benefit.
 Yes, that makes sense.
 In Isaiah 61, and this is the best news ever, Isaiah 61 is phenomenal.
 It's pointing to a time that we now live in.
 basically Jesus, it's pointing towards Jesus. In fact, Jesus read it, I forget where in the New
 Testament, you know, that's the famous passage, he goes into the synagogue and says, today,
 in your hearing, the scripture's been fulfilled. But he talks about the favorable here of the
 Lord, about, you know, just the whole thing of exchange. But because of Jesus' death on the
 cross, that's why we have favor. Now, I want to distinguish because there's a fascinating verse
 that I learned as a young boy in the tender pads, not a feminine hygiene product. If you have the
 the boy scouts, you have the cub scouts, you have the tender pads.
 And so the, the verse I had to learn was look to verse 52, Jesus grew in wisdom
 and in stature and in favor with God and all the people.
 So you see there that favor, you have favor with God, you have favor with people.
 I think according to scripture, we already have favor with God because we're
 heirs with Christ and Christ is as much favor as anybody.
 So I think favor with God is is an absolute done deal.
 Yes.
 And Psalm 84 verse 11 says this, the Lord bestows favor and honor.
 So, you know, Lord, would you just bestow favor upon my life?
 It's a great thing to pray.
 The reason you pray that he's already done it, but it's actually a reminder for us.
 Right.
 Right.
 It reminds yourself of your position.
 Yeah.
 Same with Psalm 90 verse 17, may the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us.
 Well, they were speaking from an Old Testament mindset.
 we're in the new covenant, we already have favor resting upon us.
 So we pray it for our benefit, not for us.
 So you get favor because you're in Christ, but you grow in favor through maturity.
 And that's, I think what I'd like to talk a little bit about the whole thing
 about growing in favor with man, right?
 We've already got favor with God in your experience, AJ Jones, how have you
 seen yourself grow in favor with men?
 talk about like your life and ways you've seen the favor operating and how you've grown in favor.
 I was thinking about that one, you know, a little bit earlier when we were talking about
 talking about this and I thought, huh, I think that honor seems to release favor in the hearts of
 other people, especially those in authority above you. And I mean, I can look at my life and see
 over and over again with the exception of one job.
 And I've had quite a few jobs at me, I'm in my 40s.
 I've always been promoted and promoted
 and promoted until I left wherever it was
 to the next place and then I would continue
 to get promoted there.
 And I think that's because favors always
 gone ahead of me and made room.
 For me to flourish and to grow in places.
 But I've also always determined in my heart to honor those and authority in that place and to give my 110% and you know that kind of even though most of those jobs I wasn't in my calling per se.
 Right.
 But I was where God had me at the moment.
 But talk to me about how you know you end up in management at a large car rental company.
 But prior to that you were a waitress.
 Yeah.
 So talk to me about how you made that shift because that that's an example of favor and action.
 Yeah, I mean that starting to work there even the day that I got offered the job, I had really
 only worked at the restaurant that I was working in for about three weeks. And that particular
 restaurant, you know, took a long time for them to hire people because you made such great money
 as servers that people didn't leave very often. And so I had just started working there and it
 And it was one of these shifts where like everything was going wrong kind of around,
 you know, I had put in a pizza and said no mushrooms because of allergies and the pizza
 had come out with mushrooms.
 And so I sort of caught it on the fly and brought it back and you just stuff going on
 like that.
 And these two businessmen were sitting in the corner of my section that I was responsible
 for and they sort of just waited for lunch to be over, which that's not that normal for
 businessman. And at the end anyway, one of the guys who looked quite young just said to
 me, "Hey, I'd love to offer you a job in car rental." And I was like, "Oh, you know, I'm
 cool. I have a job and I like being here because I'm thinking you look really young.
 So I'm thinking he's a counter manager somewhere, you know what I mean? And you're not going
 going to be to server salary being behind the counter.
 And so I was just like, you know, that's cool.
 Thanks so much.
 And whatever.
 And he's like, OK, well, I'm just
 going to leave my card.
 If you change your mind, just call me.
 And I was like, OK, thanks so much.
 And he'd come in a few other times,
 but I'd never talk to him.
 So he left.
 And I went over and picked up his card.
 And he was the president of National Car rental, Canada.
 And I thought, oh, you're not a counter guy.
 You're the head of the company for the whole of Canada.
 And so I was like, huh, so I prayed about it for a while.
 And I didn't actually end up calling him back.
 And he came back in a week and a half later,
 asked for my sections that down again.
 And so when I went over to serve him, I'm like, oh, hi,
 car rental, and he sort of laughed.
 And he's like, I still want you working for me
 when you come in and talk to me and whatever.
 And I was like, yeah, I will.
 Okay, sure I will.
 So I went in and I talked to him
 and I talked to his VP of operations.
 And, you know, it was a good interview
 and they were sort of like,
 "Hey, where do you feel like your life is going?"
 And I said, "Well, you know, I don't know
 "what the next five years look like,
 "but I feel like the Lord said five years from now
 "that I'll be in full-time ministry."
 So I said, "So you need to know if you hire me,
 "you've got me for five years.
 "I think I leave after that."
 But if you do hire me, I'll give you 110% while I'm here.
 And so they were both like, okay then, you know?
 And they offered me the job on the spot
 and right into middle management and that kind of stuff.
 And-
  </li><li>Wait, wait, wait.
 So you went from serving their table
 straight into middle management?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 They wanted to train me to be a city manager.
 So that would, you know, that would put you over 40 or 50,
 depending on the size of your city,
 but in Toronto, you have over 40 managers
 and of different locations and that kind of stuff.
 So there was a program that they were just starting.
 I was one of the first people going into it
 and you basically trained to run every department
 at Head Office.
 So you had to know how to run the licensees,
 how to run distribution, how to run fleet,
 how to run all the different departments
 so that you could then run the city
 and know how every single thing was supposed to operate.
  </li><li>So then what happened?
  </li><li>Well, so I was in that program.
 And again, I was working for Vince.
 Everybody there was so intimidated by Vince.
 Vince was very, very intense,
 but Vince absolutely loved me.
 And so it was really funny
 'cause people would just leave me alone as it were
 because they knew that Vince had my back.
 At one point, about a year in,
 I mean, I got promoted, I think eight times
 in the four years that I worked there.
 But at one point, Vince asked me to come to his office.
 Well, the first time he did it,
 it was like after I even working there about three weeks.
 And when he called for me,
 he called the manager I was working for and said,
 could you send AJ to my office?
 And that manager was like,
 " AJ has been so nice working with you," and whatever.
 And I was like, "Why are you saying that, Andre?"
 And he's like, "Because if you get called to Vince's office, you're fired.
 Like you're done."
 And I was like, "Oh, I haven't done anything to be done."
 He's like, "It doesn't matter."
 And I'm like, "Okay."
 And I go to Vince's office and Vince, you know, I came in and he goes, "Shut the door,
 please."
 So I shut the door and I sat down and he goes, "People want to know why you smile so much."
 You know?
 And so I started laughing and I said, "Is this really the conversation we're having?"
 And he's like, "Yeah, why do you smile so much?"
 And I said, "Do you want a real answer?"
 And he said, "Yes."
 And I said, I love Jesus and I know that I'm loved.
 And he goes, I have to ask you a question.
 Now his siblings had just gotten saved.
 And he had all these questions about Jesus.
 And now he had somebody to ask about them.
 So it was really, really cool.
 So everyone so why he called me in his office
 to ask me questions about why was his sister leaving
 her amazing job and starting an orphanage in India
 and that kind of stuff.
 It was really cool.
 But anyway, I got promoted and promoted and promoted.
 And at one point, they paid me for a year and a half
 to just pastor all of the managers in the city,
 to meet with them, to talk to them about their dreams
 and hopes and all that kind of stuff,
 and then rearrange them into teams
 that would work better together.
 You know, I just, I had an enormous amount of fun,
 but I mean, even in serving jobs,
 I always got promoted to the serving,
 you know, the shift leader and then to the server trainer
 and whatever, I just, and I just, I loved working.
  </li><li>So humanly, right, so obviously the Lord's at work in that,
 humanly, what do you credit for that? Just hard work, honoring your boss?
 Hard work and honor. Be raised so you're going to be, don't call in sick if you're not sick.
 Give your all when you're there, don't grumble, don't talk about other people.
 Just be there and get the job done and be a great example.
 Improverbs 3, I'm going to paraphrase it, it says basically this, it says, "Honor the word,
 Practice loyalty, exercise, kindness, then you will find favor with both God and people and you will earn a good reputation.
 Yeah.
 And that amazing.
 That's really amazing.
 The first Peter 5.5 says this, God favors the humble.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, you already have favor in the eyes of the Lord because of Jesus,
 but our encouragement is if you want to grow in favor with people, practice honor, practice humility, practice kindness, practice loyalty.
 Practice not winching.
 Right.
 Here's another thing I want to talk about.
 So we talked a little bit about how your favor in God is already there because of Christ
 and how you can grow in favor with man.
 But I want to talk about cultivating the favor that's on you or following the favor on your
 life because one of the most confusing things to me is people who have favor but don't follow
 it.
 So for example, I understand why you are skeptical of this young guy giving you a business card.
 You may be thought he was hicking on you or he wasn't what he was, etc, etc.
 Ultimately, you followed the favor that was on you and it led you in a completely different
 career path.
 But if you have favor in an area of your life, be it an opportunity or a relationship or
 a deal, my encouragement is follow the favor.
 For me, it's relationships.
 Like I meet with a lot of people every week.
 You know, I meet with people, people are asking for input or wisdom or I meet with people
 just to train them or encourage them or bring an element of correction or whatever.
 There's a million reasons why I'm meeting with a million different types of people.
 But every now and then, I'll meet with somebody and I will just be amazed that this person
 has favor in my eyes.
 What that looks like is I'm having lunch with somebody and I don't really want the
 lunch to end.
 That's quite uncommon for me.
 I'm thinking, "I'll give you the shirt off my back.
 I will literally give you anything.
 What is it you need?"
 my life when I see favor on somebody like that, I go and pursue that. I think Josh and Sarah
 touched on that last week when they were speaking that their first time at Grace Center, they
 were just going up to get communion and they walked past me and I remember it. I just looked
 over at them and thought, wow, who's that? Now, I could have just thought, oh, I wonder
 who those are, maybe they're visitors, but I actually went and pursued it because there
 was favor in my eyes. Like, I noticed them and thought, gosh, I wonder who they are. And
 they reciprocated that. It went back and forth. I'm pursuing the favor I see on them. They're
 responding to the favor that they're receiving from me. I see lots of people abdicate the favor
 that's on their life. Just say no to it or for whatever reason. I don't know whether that's fear.
 I don't know what it is, but there's an element where we actually have to steward the favor that's
 on our life really, really well and cooperate with it. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I've seen people
 who have tremendous favor in other people's eyes. But for whatever reason, they end up staying
 stuck. And whether that's because they're fearful of success, or they're just comfortable with where
 they are, maybe they don't expect God to do something more. And so they never move forward,
 even when favors actually write their opening a door for them.
 And that's confusing to me. I guess it's sad. It is because it actually slows down what God
 God is trying to give you.
 Yeah.
 The thing is the favor that's on your life is ultimately used for other people.
 Like favor isn't just so that we can have a great life, but favor is on you for
 other people.
 It's in you for you and on you for many.
 Yeah.
 Like Joseph, the favor that was on Joseph got him to be the number two person in
 all of Egypt and in turn he saved a nation.
 Right.
 Esther, for example, she saved the whole Jewish people because the favor she had in the eyes of the king.
 Right.
 And so if you're listening to this and you're fearful of favor or you're fearful of opportunities that are coming your way,
 that's sad because it could be God's trying to promote you, trying to prosper you, trying to bring you into a new season.
 But it's also sad because the people who are going to be blessed because of your obedience are not going to receive it as quickly as God might like.
 Right. So we have some questions for you this week. So the first question is, who has favor in your eyes?
 And are you cultivating those relationships? Like are you pursuing those people?
 Right. Do a stock check in your life when you're interacting with people, who is it that stands out to you?
 Yeah.
 And what are you doing with those relationships? Second question, where is the favor pointing you in your life?
 For example, in your life, are you experiencing favor in a certain area or from certain people
 or in a certain direction?
 And are you actually following those opportunities or following those relationships?
 I wonder, you know that whole saying, you can't see the forest for the trees?
 Yeah.
 I think sometimes there's parts of our life where we cannot see the favor for the facts.
 Right.
 By that, I mean, there are situations in our life that suggest that favor is nowhere
 to be found. But actually, if we stop, if we look past the circumstances and we ask God,
 "God, what is it you want to be to me in this situation that you couldn't be in any other?"
 Favour is usually attached to that. So, you know, my question is what areas of your life right now
 are you looking at and it just feels favourless? Because that's not true, that's contrary to
 what Scripture says. And then the last thing I want to encourage you to do is to ask God for
 favor in the eyes of your superiors because you already have favor with God.
 Next, just ask God for favor with man. Daniel chapter 1 verse 9 says this,
 "Now God had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to Daniel." So if you feel like
 you're lacking favor in the eyes of people around you, ask God for it's a gift you want to give to
 others for your benefit. All right, let's just wrap this bad boy up.
 We would love you to come and spend eight months with us at the School of Supernatural Life.

 A couple of days left.

 And also I wanted to mention our good friend,
 Chris McLawney, just released his brand new album
 on Jesus Culture.
 It's called Everything and Nothing Less.
 It's an incredible album, it's incredible.
 I would say it's the first CD that's done a good job
 of capturing what Chris McLawney's like in worship.
