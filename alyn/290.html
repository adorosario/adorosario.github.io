<ul>
  <li>Mrs. Jones? - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>Episode 290 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This is take three of the podcasts.
  </li><li>I was having this discussion with a friend of mine this week
 who also has a lot of hair that's really long.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That I like plan to do my hair.
 So, 'cause it takes so long to like dry it
 and get it to look right,
 that I like plan for when I'm gonna do that.
 And then I also don't wear makeup every day.
 So Thursday planned, did my hair, did my makeup.
 And we didn't end up recording
 because just a whole bunch of--
  </li><li>Yeah, other stuff happened.
  </li><li>Other stuff happened.
 And then by the time we were like,
 okay, we'll record at night, we're both just trash.
 So you were like, all right, let's record tomorrow.
 I'm like, okay, all right, that's fine.
  </li><li>And I want to interject here because in order to record,
 you actually have to press the button that's marked record.
  </li><li>Okay, so now we're at Friday.
  </li><li>This is take two.
  </li><li>Take two and so now I'm like, okay, here's going up.
 Bangs were still working on Friday.
 Put on full makeup again.
 And we come down and you didn't press record.
  </li><li>I mean, in my defense, I pressed a button
 that I thought was record.
  </li><li>Yeah, the button next to record doesn't help us much.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>When.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So here's take three.
  </li><li>Yes, and now my bangs look chunky.
 Like there was no fixing them.
 I-
  </li><li>I didn't wanna say anything.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But the good news is that the vast majority
 of our people who subscribed to our podcast
 listen to the podcast they don't watch.
  </li><li>Yeah, in which case my bangs look perfect.
  </li><li>They look amazing.
  </li><li>So wonderful.
  </li><li>I tell you what though,
 your bangs might not be the way you want them.
 But your lipstick looks amazing.
  </li><li>Oh, thank you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, well that's a slight insight
 into our production schedule and our production problems.
  </li><li>Our lives, yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm fairly confident I've hit record on this podcast.
  </li><li>Oh, you better have hit record on this podcast.
  </li><li>I hear you.
 I hear you.
  </li><li>That sounded very threatening.
 It was.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Give the people a weekly update.
 Our weekly update this week is very, very short
 because by and large, every day,
 kind of, the same we met with lots of people.
  </li><li>Yeah, we just met with lots of people.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was very good.
 We had lots of relationship, lots of meeting with people,
 lots of being with people, lots of helping people.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then the only other thing that I am aware of,
 that's new, is you have a new office?
  </li><li>I do.
  </li><li>You wanna talk about that?
  </li><li>I'm so excited, yeah.
 Well, we've been keeping Abby's old room
 'cause Abby moved downstairs into Kate's old room
 over a year ago at this point.
 And we'd been keeping that just 'cause we know
 we're trying to adopt and whatever.
  </li><li>I was gonna be the baby's room.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it will still be the baby's room if--
  </li><li>But after a year and a half of it
 being MDSBabies room.
  </li><li>Right, and nobody's yet chosen us to parent for them.
 So here's the thing, I'm so easily distracted.
 I have been trying to work from the living room,
 I've worked from the kitchen, the dining room,
 like just different places.
 And on one level, there's no place I can go
 on the lower level where I can escape your voice.
 (laughs)
 You're so loud.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>And I have an office on the ground floor of her house.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I've offered to give it up and give it to you,
 but you said that you keep up.
  </li><li>Yeah, but it makes more sense,
 'cause you do all the podcasts at any time.
  </li><li>So I have an office I can go away to,
 and it's quite--
  </li><li>You can shut the doors and--
  </li><li>Unless my little space.
  </li><li>Right, I don't have that.
 And so most often I would use the guest room,
 but there's a bed in the guest room,
 and it's just, it doesn't feel like an office,
 it doesn't feel like a productive space,
 it feels like a resting space.
 And so anyway, you had suggested,
 just make this your space.
 And so I got a desk, I got a desk chair that I like.
 You're like, what is with a desk chair?
 And I'm like, it's perfect for me.
  </li><li>I unpacked it.
  </li><li>Well, you set the whole thing up while I was away.
 Which was very sweet to come back
 and like everything is assembled.
 But what were you thinking?
  </li><li>I'm thinking it's a cheap knockoff
 that's gonna be a horrible chair
 that you're gonna get frustrated with.
 But you also have a standing desk.
 So I don't know how much time you're actually
 spending sitting in it.
  </li><li>Right.
 It's like the Dell computers of chairs.
  </li><li>Oh, I like it.
 I sit up very straight.
 I like to sit very straight.
 I don't want to tilt back at all.
 And it's designed for that.
  </li><li>Maybe I'm glad you like it.
 I just, then we want to touch it or see it.
  </li><li>Okay, well you don't have to do it.
  </li><li>No, I know, that's what's beautiful about it.
 That's why I've made peace with it.
  </li><li>Yeah, so anyway, I've transformed this room.
 I painted the walls in the room.
 I've done it in colors that will work for a nursery
 in the future so I don't have to repaint it.
 But for right now, I have a little God space
 and then I have like a working space
 and there's no bed or anything in there that suggests,
 I don't know, sleeping.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Is that part of your distraction?
  </li><li>I'm like, you know, when you're tired.
  </li><li>You know when you're tired.
  </li><li>Yes, yes, right, you're tired.
  </li><li>Is that what happened this morning?
  </li><li>This morning we get up early, early, it's a Saturday.
 We get up early and we say, okay, are you ready to podcast?
 And she's like, no, I need some time.
 I'm like, well, then give me a time.
 And she says, well, we'll podcast at 10 a.m.
 So I'm like, great, no problem.
 So 10 a.m.
 At 9.56 a.m.
 No, no, no, it was 9.53.
 I hear, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no,
 and AJ running in in her pajamas.
 And what happened?
 I just said, come on, wait, come on,
 wait, wait, wait.
 It's like I ran into the closet to find clothes.
 Is it that you had a little-- did you get back in bed?
 Is that what the problem was?
 Well, yes.
 Yes.
  </li><li>With my coffee.
 So here's the thing, Saturday mornings for me,
 like the perfect Saturday morning is I can sleep in to like,
 I usually don't sleep that late,
 but like let's say eight o'clock,
 I didn't quite make it to A today,
 have a coffee and kind of sit in the dark in bed
 'cause our kids, like Abby's still sleeping,
 she's a teenager, she's not gonna wake up to like 10.30.
 Tia has like a standing date with her friends.
 So she has this online friendship thing
 that she's been doing every Saturday for years.
 And then so does MJ.
 And so they're all like,
 nobody needs anything from us.
 And so my ideal Saturday morning is,
 I get to get up late,
 err, and have coffee and just chill.
 Like there's no-- - That's all good and well.
  </li><li>Yes, yes. - But we had a deadline.
  </li><li>We had a deadline. - On the bed.
  </li><li>Yes, because somebody didn't press record yesterday.
 I just wanna say.
 But anyway, yes.
 So I was distracted.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Okay, so there's no bed in your office.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's no bed.
  </li><li>Which means you're gonna be a hive of productivity.
  </li><li>Yes, but to go along with what we were saying
 about the office this morning,
 because I've gotten into poor painting,
 I was watching poor painting videos
 and they're kind of mesmerizing.
 And then I get into like, oh, how would I do that?
 Do I have the things to do that?
 I think I do, what colors would I use?
 And then I realize I'm like, off.
  </li><li>On that topic, if we talked about your poor painting,
 all the podcasts.
 I don't think we have.
  </li><li>Tell the people about poor painting.
  </li><li>I've just started doing it.
 Well, I guess now it's been a little while
 I started doing it last May,
 I think is the first time that I--
  </li><li>Is that really true?
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>Is that true?
  </li><li>'Cause it was before we went on sabbatical.
  </li><li>Wow, we're time has gone.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>Okay, so poor painting.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Can I describe to the people
 the fastest for that?
  </li><li>Yeah, that would be interesting
 because I've had a couple of different people say,
 has Alan ever come down and tried it with you?
 And I just sort of like go fall with laughter.
  </li><li>Well, what's like a fall with a fall?
 I don't know.
 You haven't seemed interested in trying it.
 I would love it if you wanted to try it.
 I think you would find it as hypnotizing as I do, but.
  </li><li>I think probably I would run into the problem
 that you ran into initially.
 And it seems like in order to do it,
 you have to be comfortable giving up
 huge amounts of control.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm good, thanks.
  </li><li>But wouldn't it be fun for the podcast people
 to, if I filmed a video of you trying it?
  </li><li>I don't know.
 You can ask the people if that would be interesting.
  </li><li>You let us know.
 So, AJ, it looks like AJ gets a canvas.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then puts various obstacles in the way of the canvas.
 (laughing)
 Whether it's like an upside down cup,
 or I don't know, various objects.
 And then, pours paint on top of it.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it's very sort of liquidy-type paint.
  </li><li>And then you made a lazy Susan.
  </li><li>I did make my own.
  </li><li>Which is the spinny thing that she spins,
 and then the paint goes everywhere.
  </li><li>It does.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>And then sometimes uses a hair dryer,
 and I know that because my studio is unblocked,
 and a hairdoer is plugged into the head.
 And she uses a hairdoer to spray everywhere.
 And then somehow that produces a result.
  </li><li>It does, it does, yeah.
  </li><li>But somehow that costs lots of money
 based on my white bag.
  </li><li>It does, it really does.
 Well, the paint, and you go through
 an enormous amount of paint because it's--
  </li><li>I can tell it's all over our basement floor.
 If you can't move it on the canvas,
 you might go through less of it.
  </li><li>Shut up.
 And then the canvas is of course.
 And because I'm trying all new things all the time,
 some of them don't work.
 And then you've just that canvas and paint that's kind of
 wasted.
 I mean, you can repaint over to some of them.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So I've super gotten into it.
  </li><li>I'm just getting tremendous joy.
  </li><li>So much joy.
 And I've started like, I've had a couple of dreams
 about paintings and then come down and done those.
 Sometimes I just have a scripture verse in my head.
 So I come down and put that.
 And then I'm, it's just fun to put on worship music
 and just be like, okay Holy Spirit,
 what are we doing today?
 I feel very connected afterwards.
 I feel very like peaceful.
 So it's really great for me.
 I love it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So, but I've started telling them.
  </li><li>Let me ask you,
 you know, there's this thing called imposter syndrome
 that hits humans where we are terrified
 that we're going to be found out
 even when there's nothing to be found out about it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You know, so you start a new job
 and you have imposter syndrome.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Even though you've got the qualifications to do it,
 you're just like, I'm new.
 I don't know what I'm doing.
 Or we felt that when we started podcasting.
 Like, can we even podcast in our bio
 when we've only recorded five episodes, et cetera?
 So, talking about the vulnerability,
 I'm assuming that you would have experienced
 deciding to sell poor paintings.
  </li><li>Well, I think even in posting them to begin with,
 I felt super vulnerable.
  </li><li>Like here's my art.
  </li><li>Here's my art, on my Instagram feed, you know whatever.
 And because I have quite a few friends
 that are legit artists.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah.
  </li><li>Like amazing artists.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>You know, among them, the person who's teaching me
 how to do it, but like, like people who've been doing art
 for years and years went to school for art,
 all that kind of stuff.
 And here's me like, doo doo doo, hey, look at my
 happy lion, you know, or whatever.
 And so it helped super scary.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You actually explained the happy lion reference.
  </li><li>Well, a couple years ago, I guess it was like 15 years ago
 I thought I'm gonna try painting again because I used to do visual arts a lot
 Yeah, and so I painted this lion and basically I was like well. Oh, well. He's very happy
 Look like a lion
 I burned it. I was like let's get rid of the happy lion then I don't think it was so much happy as it was smiling
  </li><li>If it was a smiling line, it was my--
  </li><li>It was not a smiling line.
  </li><li>I was like, "That's what lions look like."
 Anyway.
  </li><li>King of the jungle looks like he's very happy.
  </li><li>He's not to be happy about it.
 He can eat anything he wants.
 So anyway, when I first started posting the pictures,
 a bunch of those people that, you know,
 I said our legit artists were like, "Hey, AJ,
 "it's so great, like super encouraging about it."
 And then a couple of them were like,
 "You should think about selling them."
 And then I had a whole bunch of other friends that were like,
 you should sell them.
 And then I realized how much it's costing
 and I should sell them because otherwise
 I'm gonna just stop painting.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm glad you came to that.
 I can't believe you before I have a date.
  </li><li>Yeah, I figured.
 And so I actually started a separate Instagram account
 because I'm kind of like most people follow me,
 they don't probably follow me to see my painting.
 They're following me because of church things or whatever.
 And so I kind of thought, I felt bad posting paintings
 all the time.
 And I actually had one person mention like,
 hey, are you gonna be posting a lot of pain?
 'Cause like, kind of not why I follow you.
 So, yeah.
 And I was like, oh, I didn't actually know the person.
 So anyway.
  </li><li>That's so funny.
 You're just like, you know, you can keep scrolling.
  </li><li>Yeah, like, you know.
  </li><li>You know my fetus for me, not for you.
  </li><li>And it cost you like two seconds.
 Like, just keep going.
 But anyway. - Wow, it's very powerful.
  </li><li>Yeah, whether I should have let that get in
 under my skin or not, I thought, oh,
 maybe I will just start a separate one for painting.
 And then also, if I'm posting them and saying this is for sale,
 the only people that are going to see that are the ones that--
  </li><li>They're already interested. - They're already interested.
 And so I started a new Instagram account called Painting With AJ.
 Yeah, so now I'm posting pictures there.
  </li><li>I'm sure smiling line is available. - Instagram handle.
  </li><li>Okay, thank you, darling.
 I'll just go and get some better healing
 if the line's fine. - I have terrible shame that you--
 I mean, I have a motorcom of shame.
 That's not terrible shame. - Yeah, like you did really.
  </li><li>You're like a powerful person, but-- - Thanks.
 I'm like, you know, I didn't realize the wounding I did.
 I'm sorry for the wounding of your heart.
 I've survived.
 So people and then painting and then poor painting.
 That was our weekly update.
 Yeah.
 Was it good week?
 Yeah, great week.
 In this coming week, we actually have the final week
 to register for doing the Finding Father course.
 Yeah, registration closes Monday 20th.
 Yeah.
 So depending on your listeners, you have about a week.
 Yeah, I'm super excited to take another group through the material.
 And if you're interested in coming through Finding Father, you would just need a book
 and a copy of the teachings and then you'll come online for some calls with me every
 other week where we're just going to work through the material together and see it.
 You know, if anybody stuck, you know, sort of process together and go on a journey
 together, but tell me about the journey.
 What was in your heart when you wrote the book?
 The point of writing the book was to tear down, you know, any sort of barricades that we have
 up between Father God. I had plenty. And so a lot of it is, is again, out of my journey into
 understanding God's heart for me, to equip people to hear God's voice, to know what soaking is and
 how to do it and how does that connect them to the Lord and then tear down all the things that we
 think about God that aren't actually who he is and then and then build a correct understanding
 of who he is, how much he loves us, how he sees us, you know, all that kind of stuff.
 So it's a 12 week devotional and it's really taking somebody on a journey through that
 process.
 And so the fun part of doing the live calls and doing it as a group together is getting
 to help people steward that and coach them through a deeper relationship with the Lord.
 So when people sign up, they get a copy of your book and they read a little bit of your
 book. It's like a devotional every morning. And then they watch some teaching that you've
 prerecorded. Yeah, so they'd be one teaching per week about what they're reading in the book.
 Yeah, and they just watch it whenever it fits in their schedule.
 And there's lots of exercises in the book. It's a very interactive book where there's
 exercises to journal and to soak. And then on Saturdays, you'll meet with people
 live to talk about what came up this week, what are your testimonies, one of the things you need
 help with what questions do you have, what curiosity is do you have?
 And it's fun because in a group, what happens is people hear somebody else's what they choose
 to read from their journal or whatever, and you start to go, "Oh, mine sounds really
 similar to that.
 Like I am hearing the words."
 So there's like just a real encouragement in that, but also like, "Hey, I'm stuck over
 here.
 Hey, I'm stuck there too."
 Being able to work that through together makes people feel less lonely.
 And what can people expect to come away with after they've done 12 weeks?
 Well, like what, what can they expect to find in their life that they didn't have
 before doing the course?
 A confidence that they hear the voice of God because it's so important.
 Right.
 And it's something you're going to practice every day while going through it.
 And then, you know, again, get help on the live calls, but a deeper relationship
 with the Lord in it and a deeper understanding of how loved that we are.
 I think we actually live out of our understanding
 of who he is and who we are.
 And so if we can transform that into a more accurate
 representation of those two things, we live different.
  </li><li>I think it was Tozels that said,
 the most important thing about you
 is what you think about God.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That's been my experience.
 Like my life changed as I began to understand
 what God's really like.
 Because if you think God is angry and mean,
 you're going to live far away from an angry and God.
 If you think he's distant and interested,
 you're not gonna bring the parts of your heart to him
 that you think he won't be interested.
 But if you believe he's an intimate father
 who is intimately acquainted with all your ways,
 that if it matters to you, it matters to him,
 that he loves you, he delights in you,
 and actually wants to satisfy your heart with good things.
 Now, that's a God you're not only gonna wanna love,
 but you're gonna wanna serve with all your heart.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>And I think that's, I mean, you taught me
 the revelation of the father's love.
 I got to do a version of what you're about to do in 2003.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I still remember thinking, I can't reconcile the woman who's here today talking about her
 history with God.
 And I love it.
 I think it's an amazing school.
 So if you're thinking about doing it, don't put it off.
 Don't delay.
 Register today.
 Go to findingfather.school to sign up.
 Yeah.
 I think what I'm also excited about is we have some people that have signed up that have
 done it before and they're doing it again.
 And I know it's because they know they'll get something more out of it, but I'm just excited
 to see those faces as well because, you know, I like people.
 I miss people.
 Also wanted to mention that if finances are an obstacle, if you're looking at it going,
 ah, I would love to, but I don't have enough money, we have got an installment plan where
 you can split up the cost of the school over three months because it's a three-day school
 12 weeks.
 Okay.
 Great.
 So yeah, finding father dot school for all the information, I'll reach out to us on social
 media if you've got any questions.
 Perfect.
 Our topic for this week.
 Yes.
 from my journal entry 10 years ago.
  </li><li>Wow, is that?
  </li><li>And this is one of the things
 that you're gonna teach people on the school
 is how to journal.
 And by journal we mean, you write out your prayers to God
 and then you write back what he's saying to you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And one of the things I love about journaling
 is I now have a 10, 15, 20 year archive
 of my personal prayers and answers to prayers
 that God's given me.
  </li><li>And your archive is actually easier to access than mine
 'cause I tend to do paper and you--
  </li><li>But it didn't start out that way.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Pre-2000s, I still have all my paper journals over there.
 I've got all of my journals from like--
  </li><li>No, I know, we have boxes of them.
  </li><li>And I would write them out.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Partly thinks I should digitize.
  </li><li>I'm like, but you're saying pre-2000,
 you realize it's 2023.
  </li><li>Right, yes, yes, I'm just good about it.
 I have over 20 years of digital searchable archives
 of all my dreams with God, all my prayers with God,
 all my tests with God, all my journaling.
 But I was thinking, I was thinking this week about like,
 what are we gonna talk about in the podcast this week?
 And I, because we try and do our podcast out
 of where we are right now, I'm in a season of life
 that was like, man, this season is so familiar.
 And I dug out my journal and I remembered,
 oh, so we're gonna talk about something today
 that is unique to everybody.
 Is it unique if it?
  </li><li>Is that to everybody?
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>We're gonna talk about something.
  </li><li>It's common to everybody, isn't it?
  </li><li>It's common to everybody.
 There we go.
 That shows up a lot.
 And the title of the topic,
 'cause you've already clicked play on this episode,
 is using your past to pioneer your future.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And my point is that often when you're with the Lord
 and he's asking you to move forward in an area,
 it can feel overwhelming.
 It can feel--
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>You can feel ill equipped for it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And part of the beauty of journeying with God
 is he prepares you for today by doing,
 John Paul Jackson would talk about
 you would get private victories
 that prepare you for public victories.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So that you would practice all the stuff
 in your journey with the Lord,
 so it's cumulative, so you need him.
  </li><li>So it becomes your natural response, like to--
  </li><li>I'm not there, a natural response yet.
 But it allows me to trust God by looking back at,
 oh, you were faithful there.
  </li><li>Right. - And there, and there,
 and you're gonna be faithful now.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 There's a big difference between looking backwards at God's faithfulness and looking forward where he hasn't been faithful yet
 Yeah, oh, that's the battle ground. Oh, yeah, absolutely. So what was it in your journal then that sparked this?
 Yeah topic says journal entry from about 10 years ago, and I don't I don't even remember what the issue was
 but it was it was 10 years ago and we were facing a
 financial need
 That was beyond our ability to meet that need. Yeah, I'm reading the journal and as I'm reading the journal
 I'm I'm basically praying to the Lord going Lord. Here is this financial need
 Yeah, that we need an answer to and it's outside of our
 capability to meet yes, and I'm I
 Guess as I'm journaling back. I don't remember precisely, but I guess as I'm journaling I start writing and I said Lord
 I'm remembering the story of David and Goliath
 And so we all know the story of David Goliath.
  </li><li>Yes, good story.
  </li><li>David goes to check on his brothers,
 bring them some sandwiches, et cetera.
 And Goliath is out terrorizing everybody.
 And David's just like,
 "Why won't anybody deal with this?
 "Uncircumcised Philistine?"
 What's the problem?
 Like, you're the army of the Lord.
 And everybody thinks he's cocky and arrogant.
 And he's like, "Well, I'll go take care of him."
 And you're thinking, "Is that naivety?
 "Is that boldness?
 "Is that faith?
 "Is it a couple like what is that?"
  </li><li>Right, what is happening?
  </li><li>And of course you saw all,
 It's just like, you're just a boy, you can't go and do it.
 And he's like, oh, no, no, no.
 No, my God has saved me from the lion and the bear.
 Like I've tended my father's flocks
 and when a lion and bear would come
 and steal one, I'd chase after it,
 I'd smack it over the head and I'd rescue it.
 And my point was that I was saying 10 years ago,
 it's like David is looking backwards
 at his confidence with the Lord.
 I will, you're giving me--
  </li><li>I'm like, it was your visual of like,
 yup, if a lion or a bear comes,
 I'm gonna chase after him, I smack it over the head,
 I'm gonna take the lion back.
 I'm like, I doubt that's what happened, but okay.
  </li><li>Let me read the Bible.
  </li><li>Okay.
 I'm just trying to imagine running down a lion.
 Okay.
  </li><li>Where is this?
 I don't even know.
 It's 1st Samuel 17, verse 34.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Your servant has been keeping his father's sheep.
 When a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep
 from the flock, I went after it, struck it
 and rescued the sheep from its mouth.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>When it turned on me, I seized it by its hair,
 struck it and killed it.
 your servant has killed both the lion and the bear.
 I don't think I had to create a license.
  </li><li>You know what happened?
 I think I'm like, surely he used his slingshot
 to like strike it.
  </li><li>Grabbed it by its hair and then struck it.
  </li><li>Well, but also before that it struck it
 and took it out of its mouth.
 So I'm like, maybe in my head I was like slingshot
 'cause I already know this story.
  </li><li>In my head it's flying kick.
 (laughs)
 It's like ninja, straight up ninja stuff.
  </li><li>It's slow motion flying kick.
  </li><li>Absolutely, okay, I'm with you.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was watching your face.
 I'm like, do I have like someone hang on my nose?
 Like why is your face?
  </li><li>No, it's the visual of like,
 him running after the line.
 I was like, wow, he was fast.
 And you know, and then just being like, hey, cut out.
  </li><li>Correct, correct.
  </li><li>Yeah. - A larger point.
  </li><li>Okay, let's go back to your point.
  </li><li>A line and a bear is pretty terrifying.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>Like really terrifying.
 Like I wouldn't go fight a lion or a bear.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>But is confidence of God's provision then fueled,
 presumably is confidence of God's provision now.
  </li><li>Yeah, he's like, hey, I've done hard things before.
 Yeah, my God.
  </li><li>I've seen scary things.
  </li><li>What does it says?
 It's just beautiful.
 He says, yeah, verse 37.
 He says, "The Lord who rescued me from the paw of the lion
 and the paw of the bear will rescue me
 from the hand of this Philistine."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So basically David's using his testimony of God in the past
 to fuel God's breakthrough in the future.
  </li><li>Yeah, absolutely.
  </li><li>And that's what we, that's, you know, 10 years ago,
 we're not 10 years ago, I'm reading my journal
 just this week from 10 years previous.
 And I'm telling myself the testimony
 Because five years before I wrote that in my journal,
 so we're now talking 15, 16 years ago,
 we faced a bigger crisis than that.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>And we were praying.
  </li><li>I felt catastrophic to that.
  </li><li>No solution. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And we prayed for God to help us.
 And then one day we got a check for, how much was it?
  </li><li>$76,000.
  </li><li>$76,000.
 A check for $76,000 came in the mail to us
 and it wiped out all of our debt.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so I was looking at that going,
 Okay, Lord, you did it then.
 You can do it here.
 And obviously it was a very different situation.
  </li><li>Sure. - But still like God,
 if you came back through us.
  </li><li>We were needing a miracle.
 And we're like, okay, you're reminding your heart
 who God is and that he's still a God of miracles.
  </li><li>I was encouraged by that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because where we are right now is obviously
 we're seeking the Lord for our future.
 And we feel that the Lord's giving us some revelation,
 which is super exciting.
  </li><li>It's wonderful.
  </li><li>That's exactly what we asked for.
  </li><li>And so scary.
  </li><li>Would you give us revelation?
 I sure will and it gives us revelation.
 You're like, thank you for the revelation.
 Could you give us some confirmation on that revelation?
 Because I feel like what he's saying is out of my depth,
 out of my skill set, out of my ability to make it happen.
 And so I am pulling back going, ah, Lord.
 And this, again, this is beautiful,
 'cause I can go back to my journal of like 20 plus years ago,
 where I remember I used to be a school teacher in Scotland.
 I had a very, very normal life.
 I would get up, I would get dressed,
 I would go teach students, I would come home,
 I'd mark their homework, I'd go to bed,
 I'd wake up next day and do the same thing.
 Five days a week, right?
 That was a school teacher.
 But I would get right into work,
 but I would always walk home from work.
 And the walk home was maybe 30 minutes, something like that.
 And I'd have a Walkman, do you remember Walkman's?
  </li><li>I do remember Walkman's.
  </li><li>And I would buy all these--
  </li><li>I felt so cool with my Walkman.
  </li><li>I had an amazing Walkman.
  </li><li>It was bright blue.
 No, I had a silver Sony Walkman that was, I mean--
  </li><li>It was sweet, wasn't it?
  </li><li>Oh, it was the iPhone of Walkman.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I still have it, actually.
  </li><li>You do not.
  </li><li>I do have it, do you know why?
 Because it's on my, someday I will do this
 to digitize all the tapes that I have.
  </li><li>Yeah, when's that gonna happen?
 (laughing)
 Okay. - It will happen the day
 after I unpack our pressure washer.
  </li><li>Yeah, exactly.
  </li><li>Okay, honestly, Alan brought a, bought a pressure washer.
 He was convinced we needed this thing.
 What, like how many years ago now, two, three years ago?
 It's still in the box.
 It's still in the box.
 And when he bought, he was like, "Babe, like we need this.
 "Our driveway, our whatever."
 And I was like, in my head, I'm like, I can't imagine
 that we actually, and still--
  </li><li>I'm probably gonna need to use it to get all the paint.
  </li><li>We're using it as a table.
  </li><li>I'm gonna use it to get all the paint off the floor.
  </li><li>That's a great idea, actually.
  </li><li>You're welcome. - Okay.
  </li><li>However, I digress.
  </li><li>I'm so glad you brought that pressure wash.
  </li><li>Walking home from school.
 I would listen on aforementioned walkmen
 to all of these teaching tapes from America
 because we didn't have, we had the internet
 but nobody was producing NPCs.
  </li><li>They couldn't make tapes.
  </li><li>And be some of these have been invented.
  </li><li>Oh, okay, nevermind.
  </li><li>I actually probably had, doesn't matter.
 But I was, you know, I had tapes
 and I would listen to Jack Deere and Rick Joiner
 and John Paul Jackson and Paul Kane
 and Bob Jones and Mike Bickle.
 I would just, you know, so my heart is being fueled
 these things. This good brother and boy, listen to all those crazy people. And it's such a star
 contrast to my daily life. Yeah. And I had a habit on Thursday nights, I would have blocked off my
 counters 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. I would just spend two hours with Jesus. I would be my habit. And in those
 days, I would do what you're teaching us to do in the school. I would, you know, pray and I would
 soak and I would journal. And all my journal was filled with was things that frustrated the
 the life out of me because it spoke of a future I couldn't imagine but desperately wanted.
 Right.
 So my journal entries as I'm a teacher in Edinburgh would be like, you know, son, I'm about to
 send you to the nations.
 And I would be like, are you?
 Are you really?
 As you're working in some scary high school where the students are like, and gnawing at
 the bit.
 I wore them a nice high school with some scary students.
 Okay.
 But you know, the Lord's talking to me about like, I'm going to send you to the nations.
 I'm gonna have you teach people how your God's voice.
 And I'm like, I'm not even sure I'm hearing you right now,
 but like, you know, whatever.
 I'm gonna have you perform miracles.
 I'm gonna, you know, you're gonna teach people
 how you'll sick.
 You will see sick people get well
 at laying on of your hands in the praying.
 And this would be just like consistent.
 This is what I would get.
 And I remember thinking on the one hand,
 I wanna trust what you're saying.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I don't know if I'm making this up.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>On the one hand, even if I do trust you,
 How is that ever gonna happen?
 Like there was literally no way I could see
 that that would happen.
 And yet within the space of two years time,
 I've married this hot smoking Canadian bride
 and we are literally traveling the world.
  </li><li>That was me, right?
 Yeah, it was checking, yeah.
  </li><li>And we are teaching people how to hear God's voice
 and we are healing the sick
 and we are watching miracles happen.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That's great in the exams.
 I remember that season really, really well
 of like what you're saying is such a juxtaposition
 of how I'm living.
  </li><li>It doesn't look like my current reality, but...
  </li><li>But I've got confidence you did it then.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so I'm bringing that testimony to the past to today,
 like, okay, Lord, you've told us this stuff,
 I don't know how this will happen.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And to quote the great Rehues.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Re said, when talking about Moses,
 too often we think we need sea-parting faith
 when God's just asking us for stick-raising obedience.
  </li><li>Wow.
 I think God's not asking us to figure out how it will happen.
 God's just asking us to say yes, which is a parent of our life.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like we find ourselves doing things that doesn't make sense,
 but we just said yes to him.
 And on the other side of that is always satisfaction.
 But the precursor to that is, how are we going to do this?
 Yeah.
 And I would say, I think it's, again, common to human experience,
 little ways and in big ways, that exact process of,
 oh God, is breakthrough ever gonna come?
 Is this thing I feel like you're talking to me about,
 ever gonna happen?
 And then it does happen,
 and then when we hit a similar situation,
 we end up with that choice again, okay?
 And I would say typically I spin for a bit, you know?
 And then you go back and you remind yourself,
 oh, he did this, he did this,
 which I think is why throughout the Old Testament,
 He's having people set up stones of remembrance or alters
 and saying, remember what I did here,
 like they have a visual memory when they walk by that thing,
 hey, God broke through on our behalf
 and your journals become that.
 It's your visual memory of, hey,
 and you remind your heart and your spirit.
 He is a God of breakthrough.
 He's done a here, he's done a here, he's done a here.
 It doesn't matter what it looks like
 that just walking out an obedience
 you can trust God to meet you in that spot.
 So that, yeah, I totally get it.
 Tell me some of your stories of breakthroughs,
 of where you've used your past
 to break through into your future.
 You know, using the test
 have a son, but here I am,
 miscarrying and it's not going how I plan.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it feels like it's taking forever.
 But also when we tried to get pregnant with Abby,
 we didn't have a miscarriage before Abby,
 but it just, nothing was working.
 We were doing our part just fine in my opinion.
 It took us ages to get pregnant,
 but I felt like the Lord had really clearly said,
 like, hey, start now.
 And I'm like, why would you tell me,
 Why would you tell us to start
 and it's taking so long and blah, blah.
 And so I remember when we were trying to get pregnant
 with MJ, just going back and going,
 okay, Lord, you were right about Abby.
 You're right about, you know, Tia,
 'cause we, again, I'm miscarryed between Abby and Tia.
 And I'm gonna hang on to you now, you know?
 And sometimes with super emotional things,
 it's a little bit of a harder process.
 And it also helps to have other people
 that are hanging on with you in the midst of it
 and saying, hey, I'm believing God with you.
 And I'm going to remind you that he's broken through with you before,
 but also I was thinking about a big one for me was when my first husband left
 and I felt like my whole world blew up and all of a sudden, and it did, right?
 Absolutely.
 And all of a sudden I'm confused about how do I even head forward?
 I, I don't feel like eating anymore.
 You know what I mean?
 Like I just like everything just is like my, I don't want to be here.
 I don't want to essentially exist anymore.
 And I don't know if I would,
 I didn't get diagnosed with depression,
 but like just in a real depressive place
 where it felt like I'm never gonna feel whole again.
 I'm never gonna feel like myself again.
 God, you cannot possibly heal a wound that's this deep.
  </li><li>Wow. - Like you,
 I know you're good at the other things, you know?
 But I don't see how I ever walk out of this.
 Heeled, you know?
 But then, you know, after a season,
 starting to look back and go, actually God,
 you took me through this season with my dad
 where I felt exactly the same, you know?
 And it felt like the same things, my world blew up,
 incredible grief, incredible loss.
 And you have so fully redeemed that past anything
 that I could have ever hoped or imagined.
 Like what God did is just unbelievable.
 you'll do it again.
 I have to believe you'll do it again.
 And so I remember having this picture
 of being in this tunnel
 and literally grabbing onto Jesus' robes,
 like hands and teeth, like,
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'm not letting go &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 And going in this tunnel and I could see a light
 like really far away, but I was like,
 I'm not letting go and I'm heading that way.
 And I remember being at church one morning
 and Isabel actually came up to me and she started praying for me.
 And then she said, you know, I have a picture of you in this tunnel holding on to Jesus.
 And you're almost at the end because that was such a familiar visual that I kept getting.
 I was like, okay, God, you know, I'm going to go with what you're saying.
 I'm going to make it to the end of the tunnel.
 You're going to redeem this somehow.
 And of course he has, you know, so fully redeemed it.
 Talk about the full, full redemption.
 This wonderful Scottish man that is mine and mine alone.
 But like seriously, I mean, redeemed it to the point where,
 and we've joked about this on the podcast several times,
 but like I forget I was ever married,
 had somebody having a fair chief on me get divorced.
 Like I honestly forget.
 And so when people all sit with people and they'll be like,
 you know, this is what's just happened.
 I think, oh my gosh, I can't imagine how painful that is.
 And I realized, you know, like you had said to me once,
 babe, you went through that.
 Like you can't imagine you went through that, you know,
 but it doesn't feel written to my heart or my spirit
 or anything because God has so, like I haven't forgotten,
 but it's not part of how I process life.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>It makes perfect sense.
  </li><li>So there's like big things like that
 where you use your past testimony
 to remind your current heart that is in trauma or scared
 or whatever it's going through.
 Hey, bears and lions, like we've done this before
 and actually I can head into this with a confidence
 that it's gonna work out great.
 And again, little things, big things, whatever the things are.
 So I would say that I regularly navigate life like that.
 Like you have a testimony, not only for others,
 but to remind yourself when it gets hard
 that he still is who he was.
  </li><li>Well, that's the funny thing.
 We tend to think about testimonies
 as being something we share publicly in church,
 which of course, it includes that.
 We tend to think of our testimonies for other people,
 but actually our testimonies are for ourselves.
 like you say, "O through scripture,"
 we're told to remind ourselves.
 And Paul writes about the reason,
 we've got the Old Testament is so that we're reminded
 of God faithful.
  </li><li>And 'cause God knows how we're made up.
 Like in terms of you do need reminders.
 Again, it becomes a practice rather than an ups.
 Like, oh, I'm reminded of, oh, thank God he reminded me,
 but actually going, oh, I feel like I'm not doing okay.
 Okay, let me look back, let me make a point
 reminding myself of all the things that you've done is it's I think it's just a good practice
 to get into as well because you're not going to walk by some rock that you set up two years ago
 where you know in your life now does that make sense so yeah it reminds me of that verse in
 Revelation 12 where they overcame him the enemy by the blood of the lamb and the word of their
 testimony. When I'm with the Lord and when I'm reading the Word of God and when I'm declaring the
 promises that He's given which is one of our practices to speak back to the Lord what He's told
 us, I feel faithful, I feel confident, I feel unshaken. When I allow my attention to wonder to the but
 how, it falls apart. And I think that Revelation 12, 11 is so key that it's the testimony of your
 words, the blood of the lamb has already done it. But the power of our testimony keeps us where
 we need to do it. When we feel intimidated or overwhelmed by the enemy, the declaration, the power,
 the testimony of our words has incredible power to shift atmospheres.
 Yeah. I was also thinking when you say when you wander to the but how, that's when you start to go
 like, "But I wonder if," because I do the same thing, and I feel like I've gotten some level of
 of peace and realizing when it's time for me to understand
 the but how it's gonna have moved into the orbit of,
 of at least obedience, the but how is do this next?
 You know what I mean?
 Otherwise the but how seems like this big lurking thing,
 but then for it to be a big lurking thing,
 we've, we're taking God out of the equation.
  </li><li>I must be an absolute child because when you talk
 at your but how being a big lurking thing,
 it's everything I can do to keep a straight face.
  </li><li>Oh my God, I was like, what is happening
  </li><li>Keep your eyes right now.
  </li><li>I'm like stay on target, stay on target.
 But please don't say about how I get it.
  </li><li>Okay.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, you're so funny.
  </li><li>So that would be our encouragement for you today.
 What are you facing today that seems overwhelming
 or seems unlikely that seems contrary
 to the stuff that God's told you,
 what are the testimonies that you have in your life
 that you can look back at and tell yourself
 those testimonies.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And see what that does.
 just be present with the goodness of God,
 because he is not taking you this far to abandon you.
  </li><li>No way.
 No.
 So that's how we try and encourage ourselves
 and process and work through that stuff.
 And, you know, if you're finding yourself stuck,
 just give it a shot.
  </li><li>I have a list of questions from Sarah.
  </li><li>Oh, hi Sarah.
  </li><li>Hmm, Romans 1129.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This is a great question, by the way.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Romans 1129 says, "The callings of God are irrevocable,
 But just because you're anointed or called doesn't mean it's a given that you're full of character.
 That's correct.
 Let's just say from experience boy, howdy.
 It always amazes me to see ministers who operate in gifts of healing or words of knowledge,
 but can then turn and cut someone else down with their words or have prideful, selfish actions
 that cause some of the congregation members to walk away.
 I know God is the judge of the heart and loves giving people chances.
 I see throughout scripture how God uses the broken and praise God for that.
 I wouldn't be where I am today without His grace and mercy.
 However, what does it look like to honor those in authority who have an anointing and a calling
 but areas of their life which lack character?
 I know boundaries come into play, but my mind seems to get stuck at the disparity between flowing in the spirit
 and following your flesh when I know the Father's heart is for wholeness and full restoration to Him.
 Do you have any more insight into this?
 That great question, Sarah.
 Thank you.
 It's a good question.
 Yeah, I think probably a couple of different thoughts come to mind.
 Of course, they've just all escaped through my left ear or something.
 I feel like where'd they go?
 I was going to say something really intellectual.
 I think for one thing, we all walk in the revelation, like in the depth of
 revelation that we've received.
 So a lot of the church really still doesn't have a revelation of things like inner healing
 that would help with character things and competition and all those kind of things that
 are unfortunately also part of the church or just of life in general.
 Right.
 You mean you have deeply wounded people who are also deeply gifted?
 Yes.
 And because the church's self is gifting more than character, we'll overlook the character
 for the gift.
 And I'll be honest, I do want to honor the gift and I am hesitant about the character.
 And so it is. It is really tricky.
 I think your question is brilliant. I want to answer the power.
 Like, how do you honor somebody? Yeah.
 And we'll get to that. But I also want to give an example. I found super helpful to explain
 the disparity because it is super confusing, especially when you see tremendous displays of power
 and then incredible lack of character.
 Yes.
 Or another curious one is incredible displays of power,
 but incredibly wrong theology.
 Oh, yeah.
 Right?
 Yeah.
 So Derek Prince, one of the finest teachers
 the church has ever had, he would talk about two trees.
 He would talk about the Christmas tree and an apple tree.
 And he said, a Christmas tree just--
 you don't have to do anything to get the gift
 from a Christmas tree.
 You just wake up and there's gifts already wrapped
 underneath the tree, the tree didn't take a while to grow, it's just there.
 It looks pretty, it's amazing, you can just go grab it, you get a gift, you did nothing
 for it, it took no time, took no stewardship, no pruning, it's just there and did I get
 a gift? That's the gift of the Holy Spirit, that's the gift of the Spirit.
 You're just giving them, they have got nothing to do with your character, they're irrevocable
 by the way, so if you are mean and unkind, your gift still works.
 One of the greatest prophets, Paul Kane, Paul sadly, fell in a really bad way in sexual
 sin and in addiction to alcohol.
 And somebody who is close to him asked him, "Hey, when you were in the midst of your deception
 with those two things, did your gifts still work?"
 He said, "Indistinguishable from when I was..."
 Wow.
 So your gifts are right, that's what the script says.
 They work.
 Then Derek Prince would talk about the apple tree.
 And an apple tree takes time to produce its fruit.
  </li><li>Yes. - It needs to be pruned,
 it needs to be planted, it needs to be watered,
 needs to be nurtured. - Careful, yeah.
  </li><li>And even when you see the fruit, it often isn't ready yet
 and it has to grow and it has to develop
 and it takes time and then eventually it's ready for you.
 And that would be a representation of our character.
 We're not just born with kindness and gentleness
 and self-control and they're tested and they're matured
 and it takes a while and those gifts are constantly,
 those fruits rather constantly revisited.
 So that really, really, really, really helped me understand
 those two things, that we can have incredible gifts
 and still have terrible character, like how does that work?
 But to the point of like, how do you honor a leader?
 A couple of thoughts bring to mind.
 One is Bill Johnson's brilliant definition of honor.
 Bill, one of his definitions is,
 honoring to honor someone means to recognize
 who they are in God without stumbling over who they're not.
 Yes.
 That means you can recognize, man, this person is anointed.
 And, but this person is also unkind.
 Yes.
 And I think that's part of the call of mothers and fathers in the
 faith is to train up and to help refine and mature gifted people.
 But the trouble is often gifted people.
 People are scared to pray.
 And I think one of the things I loved about our time at Grace,
 and I can think about several situations,
 where as a leadership team, we would decide
 to not have somebody back to Grace Center,
 not because their gifting wasn't there,
 but actually because of their character,
 and the amount of mess that they would leave behind
 was larger than the blessing that they imparted.
 And so, we could still recognize and really honor the gift,
 and it might be like, you know, maybe their character
 needs a little bit more time in the oven.
 And I think as good shepherds, as good stewards,
 caring for our flock, we'd be like, yeah, let's just,
 maybe let's just skip on inviting this person back for a year.
 So let's just see what God does in material life.
 And I love that we valued character and we valued gifting to.
 I can think of it in extreme case,
 the only one that springs to mind,
 where we actually publicly warned people
 against somebody with gifting because we knew their character
 was so bad, they'd reached into immorality and we're a danger to people.
 And so it was all so responsible, but nobody likes having to do that.
 No.
 However, that didn't quite click close to Sarah's question because while we were in relationship
 with those people, we weren't submitted to those people.
 Yes, yes.
 So allow me to explain one of the most important verses in the Bible that I think is also misunderstood
 in the Bible.
 Okay.
 He was 13 verse 17, an important verse, misunderstood verse.
 It's misunderstood because we stop short when reading it.
 It says, obey your leaders and submit to them.
 For they are keeping watch over your souls as those who will have to give an account.
 So often we stop there and go, hey, sir, the solution is you just suck up, just obey them, just submit to them.
 Right.
 But if we keep reading, there's a really important part.
 And it says, let them do this with joy and not with groaning.
 Yes.
 So most of the time that we've gotten to trouble with this versus people focus on the first part of that verse,
 the obey and the submit part.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But they overlook the second part,
 which is let them do this.
 Well, that means is you and I have a say
 in who we let lead us.
 'Cause it says there, let them do this.
 If you have a leader in your life,
 regardless of how gifted they are,
 if they have repeatedly and demonstrably,
 if you've got history with this person
 and you recognize they are harming you,
 their leadership is harming you,
 then stop letting them do that.
  </li><li>So how are you saying to do that?
 Like how does stop letting them harm you?
  </li><li>Get out with their orbit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, stop following them.
 Stop letting them lead you.
 Now, let me balance this.
 Because if your history with leadership
 is that you're constantly switching leaders.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Because of what they're doing,
 either you're really bad at picking leaders
 and I don't mean to be insensitive there,
 or it could be something else going on.
 And that's important where we understand the difference
 between hurt and harm.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So remember, we get hurt all the time.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>We get hurt by.
  </li><li>People will hurt you all the time.
  </li><li>By preference.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>By communication styles.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>By your leader choosing something,
 choosing someone else to lead, you know.
  </li><li>Something or other?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you do the, so we get hurt.
 We get offended all the time.
 I'm not talking about switching leaders
 when we're hurt or offended.
 I'm talking about when harm has been done.
  </li><li>Yes.
 imperative that we stop lying that happen.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Now, what's important is that's also not a license
 to start trashing people.
 One of the clearest examples of this in scripture
 is King David, who's not yet King David.
 Because King Saul, who is arguably one
 of the worst leaders in scripture.
  </li><li>Yeah, he's horrible.
  </li><li>Complete psychopath.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And so when we are like, Alan, define harm.
 The guy is literally throwing javelins.
  </li><li>Harm, pray there.
  </li><li>It's out to kill him.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And several times in scripture,
 you know, the most famous one where David and his men
 are literally fleeing for their lives.
 And they're hiding in a cave.
 And in a moment of just comedic brilliance,
 Saul comes in and the scripture says to relieve himself.
 And while he's going about his business,
 David's man, like, hey, this is the Lord.
 He's handed him into your hands.
  </li><li>Yeah, get him.
  </li><li>Get him.
 And David doesn't.
 He just goes over and snips the corner of his cloth off,
 which is kind of interesting.
 But then David's racked with guilt.
 And so he confesses his sin.
 And he's like, my Lord, my King.
 What is he doing?
 He's still honoring who he is.
 And he's saying, why are you out to kill me?
 Like, you know, today I've demonstrated,
 I'm not out to kill you like, my heart is innocent.
 And Saul amazing, he's like, oh my gosh,
 you're a better man than I am.
 Like you, God put you into my hand and you spared me.
 You know, I, you know, I'm so sorry, please forgive me.
 And what's interesting is David still honors him.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But doesn't come back under his leadership.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it's just as well, 'cause a couple of chapters
 later, it says, you know, Saul is out, he's taking a band of men, 300 men to come out and
 kill David. And that's the night where, you know, David goes over and he's mad because
 Saul's bodyguard is falling asleep. I love David. He's so mad that the king's bodyguard
 is not doing his job, keeping the man who's trying to kill him alive. Right? And he takes
 him to task and the same thing. Saul is like, Oh, David, I'm so sorry. I'm cut to the core.
 You're an amazing man, I've got. And he says, come home with me. Yeah. Right? Cause David's
 like, "Hey, listen, I am running for my life.
 I can't even come home.
 I can't even worship my God.
 I'm over here in a Philistine land.
 You know, I have mercy on me."
 And he still refers to him as my king and my lord.
 He honors who he is.
 But it says that Saul went home and David went away.
 Like David still didn't trust him.
 So you can still honor the person
 without choosing to be under their leadership.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I think too, it's worth talking about,
 like if you think about, 'cause you're like,
 "Oh, I love David and here he is."
 And he's so good at honor.
 So he also made some colossal errors.
  </li><li>Talk about gifting and character.
  </li><li>Right, gifting and character.
 And so I think there's also a place to realize
 that there's no perfect leaders.
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>And have some grace for that as well.
 'Cause I think it's really easy, especially if,
 and I'm not saying Sarah that this is necessarily you,
 but a lot of people have been hurt by church leaders.
 And so we start to immediately write stories.
 When we hear something or we witness an action
 and we don't realize we've written a whole story behind that,
 that might not actually be what's going on for that later either.
 And so like on one side, I'm like, you can honor
 but also not be under influence, that would be safer.
 I think in some situations it's safer to just be completely removed
 from those people.
 And for me as somebody who,
 I haven't experienced extreme amounts of church abuse,
 but as somebody who's experienced extreme abuse.
  </li><li>Like in your home girl.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 I have a very high need to feel safe.
 And so I'm very sensitive as to whether I can stay
 in underneath certain leadership,
 because of a safety measure or whatever.
 And that's fine.
 like I feel a freedom to go,
 well, this person doesn't feel safe for me.
 And so I actually don't want input here.
 And because there's lots of other places
 that I can get input.
 But if every place I go,
 I keep having the same experience
 then what I'm gonna need to do is also look at
 where am I part of this story
 or a bigger part of this story than I think.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I think there's so much,
 can be so much involved
 in that question.
 And it is important to know,
 there aren't any perfect leaders.
  </li><li>And the dynamic you're seeing is real.
  </li><li>And it's real, and it's important.
 And also there are amazing, safe, wonderful leaders out there.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>I think one of the things,
 and I don't know what else you wanna say,
 but just to give an example,
 one of the things that I love about John and Carol Arnott
 is for me, they've been my best example of safe leaders
 because they are at home who they are on the stage.
 I mean, you know what you're gonna get.
 You don't, if you hear them in conversation
 with someone else, you don't get a different version.
 They're not, they're never what they're not,
 like who they are, who they appear to be
 is actually who they are.
 I think that's the definition of a safe leader.
 And then on top of that, they're incredibly anointed.
  </li><li>And though having said all that,
 you will find people in their history
 who have been hurt by them.
  </li><li>Sure.
 who are like, "Well, I wanted this from them
 and they couldn't give me that."
 Whether there's, you know, blame that can be attributed.
 And that's why you can go there.
 Sure.
 The reality is there are wonderful, safe leaders
 and people who have been hurt by that.
 Yes.
 And that, ah, it's like,
 that's why we have to do work in our own heart,
 keep short time.
 All the time, yeah.
 And recognize if we want mercy, we have to show mercy.
 Yeah.
 So you're not out to lunch there at all.
 It is a very, very real dynamic.
 And it's actually a very lonely dynamic.
 Yeah.
 because we are all more or less sensitive to certain things.
 So there's people who have got a higher tolerance for gifting
 and maybe less sensitivity to character.
 And they're like, "Oh, I love this person, they're amazing."
 You could be over here going, "Oh, yeah, I've got some level of...
  </li><li>Every alarm, well, every alarm bell is going off for me.
 I'm like, "Nope, nope."
 I remember that with John and Carol talking about John and Carol.
 John and Carol had a speaker in, a minister, into the church.
 And the overwhelming consensus was this person is amazing
 and they are wonderful and they are gifted
 and they are anointed.
 And I'm like, I don't want to end the deal with this person.
  </li><li>Run away.
  </li><li>This person is terribly unsafe.
 And again, I'm like, am I out to lunch?
 Am I just filled with judgment?
 What's going on?
 Well, it turned out, what, two, three years later
 turned out that the person was incredibly unsafe
 and had been an immoral leader
 and was having an affair
 with some of the people who were there
 ministering with them.
 Now, I didn't know that, I didn't know that's what was going on,
 but my little alarm bell in my heart was like,
 "Danger, will Robinson danger?"
  </li><li>And I think in those moments, again,
 you can protect your heart without dishonoring someone else.
  </li><li>Absolutely, yeah.
  </li><li>So you can go, "Huh, I'm gonna choose
 "to listen to my own discernment,
 "and so I'm not gonna open myself up."
 So I can appreciate their giftedness,
 but I'm not actually gonna take them in.
  </li><li>John Wember would say you eat the meat
 and spit out the bones.
 Ravi Zachariis would be an amazing example of that.
 So, Ravi, maybe one of the greatest apologetic teachers
 we've ever had.
  </li><li>For sure.
  </li><li>And then posthumously, we discover just ourrendous
 level of character in his life.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so then what do you do?
 What do you do?
 And that's part of the wrestle,
 because the Bible openly records amazing leaders
 with colossal failures.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And by the way, we can't be excused from that.
  </li><li>No, of course not.
  </li><li>We are aware of some of our incredible gifts
 and aware of some of our terrible weaknesses.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And we have to be honest and be also unaware of some of the things sure and that's where humidity comes to play like okay i want to move forward and i want to be humble gentle leader open to correction yeah.
 Great question so good so probably worthy of more unpacking than we did but that's our best thinking so far topic.
