<p> Hey baby. Mrs. Jones, how in the heck are you? I'm well. We shouldn't say heck because our children keep asking us if heck is a bad word.
 Yes. We're like, no, hell is a bad word. Heck is totally fine. And then you often say, dang it when you're playing video games.
 And so now MJ is saying, dang it. So I said to him today, MJ, we don't say dang it. And he said, oh my gosh. And I said, no, baby, we don't say that either.
 either. He said, "So what I say?" And I said, "Oopsie Daisy." So he looked at me and he went,
 "Oopsie Daisy, oh my gosh."<br/>
 That's like...<br/>
 Parenting fail. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Episode 65 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 I hope you have had an amazing week.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 We had an amazing week.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 Partly because our kids are back in school.
 Yes, it was a very full week.<br/>
 partly because you discovered how to make paleo crepes.
 Yes, and paleo crepes.<br/>
 Crapes.<br/>
 I can't even remember how you say in French.
 V.P.<br/>
 Almost certain it's not that.<br/>
 I'm sure it's crepes.<br/>
 You have always made bananas faster one of my favorite desserts.
 It's true.<br/>
 But you've never made it with the crepes.
 No, because it doesn't have to be with the crepes, but.
 OK, I've only ever experienced it with the crepes.
 So I married you.<br/>
 So all this time I've been thinking that you've been short changing me on dessert.
 Oh, no, I usually just served the banana and the sauce and everything over ice cream.
 But being as we're not having ice cream right now and I could make a paleo grape.
 Let's talk about why I'm not allowed ice cream.
 You're not allowed ice cream because you're bad.
 I'm not bad.<br/>
 I'm just kidding. Because we are back on paleo.
 And for those people who don't understand what paleo is,
 Give us a quick rundown on paleo.<br/>
 Paleo is no grains, no sugars, no dairy.
 And the advantage of this is we both feel much better, less grumpy, and like our brains are defogged when we eat this way.
 I don't feel that right now.<br/>
 Right now, all you can think about is the fact that you didn't get dessert.
 True.<br/>
 That's very true.<br/>
 And so that this advantage of eating a paleo diet is you can't eat whatever you want whenever you want.
 Correct but that's probably good for our bodies even if it's a disadvantage in terms of convenience.
 It is good for my weight.<br/>
 Yes, you lost like four pounds yesterday.
 I did. One day of paleo down four pounds.
 Seriously, I lost just over two yesterday. Crazy.
 We should probably keep track of our weight then and see how much we lose.
 How long are we planning on doing paleo for?
 That's insanity stop now you get behind me saying.
 On the topic of food we managed to eat up in Nashville this week.
 We did.<br/>
 We got to see our good friends Tyler and Analie.
 Which was awesome.<br/>
 And we ate at the butcher town hall.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 We've heard amazing things about it.<br/>
 It was good.<br/>
 I like it.<br/>
 Your license is yes, sick than I am.<br/>
 And yet you had better food than I did.
 I did?<br/>
 Well, you had a bigger portion and for me, bigger is better.
 Oh dear.<br/>
 Well, I think it's because I tried like three drinks and I didn't like any of them.
 Right.<br/>
 Did you like the inside of the butcher town hall?
 gorgeous. It's beautiful inside. It wants some architectural words. I think so. That's not surprising.
 If it hasn't issued a, it's beautiful. I think I heard that somewhere. And the brisket is phenomenal.
 Right. Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to go back and just get a big pound of meat. Give us an update on your
 shoulder. You had a name or I. I had an MRI. And you got it diagnosed. Yeah. So I have adhesive,
 capsulitis, which is frozen shoulder.
</p><ul>
  <li>Which is what I told you.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Frozen shoulder.
 And I have an impingement and I've also torn
 the labral ligament that goes in through the back
 of your shoulder.
 So I've done some damage somehow.
 And basically they're saying the only way to fix it
 is surgery.
 And I've had two now doctors look at it
 and tell me the same thing.
 But of course my problem is there are surgeons
 that are looking at it and surgery is what they do.
 So of course they're saying I have to have surgery,
 but it may be that it's true.
  </li><li>Right, just because their surgeons
 doesn't mean it isn't in need of surgery.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And yet to ham or everything looks like an ale.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So I'm just praying and we're looking at one other option
 to get somebody to look at my MRIs
 and tell me if they think their alternate method
 actually would do any good. And if they say no, then we might be looking at surgery.
 I still think it'd be awesome for you just to get healed.
 So do I am getting prayer every time I can get it.
 Because then you have the MRIs to prove what it was like before you got healed.
 Yeah, that'd be awesome.
 Let's just jump straight into our main topic this week.
 Okay.
 Are you ready?
 I think so.
 I want to talk about something.
 Yeah.
 Something that's very close to my heart.
 Yeah.
 I want to talk about the importance of church.
 Yeah.
 I've loved church. I was not true. I was going to say I've loved church on my life. It took a long
 time before I loved church. But I loved church before I worked at church. That's an important
 distinction to make. And I think this week, well, I've been chewing on this topic for a while,
 but this week brought it to a head because I had several conversations over email, over Twitter,
 face to face about people, Christians who've decided they're no longer going to church.
 Right. And because I see going to church as such a vital part of maturing and growth in your
 Christian walk, I have difficulty reconciling that life choice with being a Christian. It's
 almost like, you know what, the Bible, too many words, I don't really want to read it. And you're
 like, well, what are you going to replace that with?
 Right. I think for me, it makes me really worried. Like when I hear somebody is, you know,
 backing away from church or, you know, is just like, yeah, I don't, I'm not going to do church
 anymore. I'm going to church as me in a coffee store and whatever. It makes me super, super worried.
 I think because I've never seen it turn out well. Like I, I've never seen it turn out in
 healthy relationships, healthy marriages, healthy anything.
 Right. Yeah, you're going for coffee in a coffee store. It's called going for coffee,
 not going to church. Right. And it doesn't matter if there's one other person drinking coffee
 beside you reading their Bible. It's still not church. Yeah. I understand
 the concept of not having been a church because seasons change. You know, you moved to a new city,
 for example, you haven't found a church. You've just got married, you got back from your honeymoon,
 you're adjusting to your new life, you've had a baby, you've been sick or whatever. So I actually
 even understand people who have perhaps overdosed on church. And what I mean by that is perhaps
 you've gone away, you've just done a whole of emissions work, you've come back, you're on furlough.
 I understand taking a couple of weeks off just, I don't know, to recalibrate. I don't think
 that's wise, but I get it. Or maybe they've been in a church that's been a toxic environment for
  </li><li>Or whatever.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it's been unhealthy, really bad leaders,
 you know, whatever, you know, your worst case scenario.
 I understand people being like,
 I just need space to regroup.
 I get that.
 But when you made a major life decision
 to no longer go to church,
 I've got some questions for you.
 The first of which is,
 what makes you think you can do
 without the very thing that Jesus gave you?
 Because it's important we don't forget
 that the church is actually God's idea.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>The church is the bride of Christ.
 Right.
 It's kind of like saying, Alan, I'd really like to hang out with you,
 but don't bring that ugly hag of a wife, AJ, with you.
 And if you were to say that to me, hanging out with me
 would be a fairly interesting affair at that point.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 I recognize this is a huge topic.
 And actually, I think if the Holy Spirit's up for it,
 I'd like to speak on this tomorrow night at Emmonate.
 And so I'll do a teaching then.
 And so tonight we're having a discussion.
 Don't we want to do a teaching?
 Right.
 But can I throw out a verse for you that I was reading?
 Sure.
 Hebrews 10. Love the book of Hebrews. Absolutely love the book of Hebrews. It's amazing.
 Hebrews 10 is all about contrasting life under the old covenant versus life in the new covenant.
 And so, you know, paints a really bleak picture of life in the Old Testament and kind of explains
 in context the glory of what we've been given through life in Jesus Christ. And it starts in
 verse 19 where it says, "Therefore," right? So contrasting everything I've just described,
 think about everything that Jesus has done. Verse 19 says this, "So, dear brothers and sisters,
 we can boldly enter heaven's most holy place because of the blood of Jesus. By his death,
 Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the most holy place. And since
 we have a great high priest who rolls over God's house, and then he goes on and said, "Let us
 four times. So since we've got this amazing promise in Jesus Christ, and since we have
 this great high priest, which is Jesus, who rules over God's house, which is the church,
 let us do these four things. Are you ready for these four things?
 Number one, let us go right into the presence of God with sincere hearts, fully trusting
 Him. Next one, let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can
 be trusted to keep his promise. Number three, let us think of ways to motivate one another
 to act of love and good works. And number four, let us not neglect our meeting together
 as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return
 is drawing near. Yeah. Here's my point. Not going to church, which is number four, not
 going to church is as foolish as the first one, which is not entering the presence of God,
 or holding tightly to the hope that we have, or motivating one another to do the acts of love
 or good works. So, like, out of the four things that the promise of Jesus gives us,
 that we are able to do, why pick stopping going to church, especially when the Bible says,
 don't do that. Right? Right? What, you know, nobody's like, you know what? I'm done with
 entering the presence of God. I'm just so over the presence of God. Right? Nobody's
 like, you know what? As a Christian, I don't really want to hold tightly to the hope that
 I have. I'm not so much into motivating people to do acts of love or good words.
 Right. That's insanity. Right.
 The other thing that I thought of when I read this verse is that the church is the perfect
 context for entering the presence of God. It's the perfect context for holding tightly to our hope
 and for motivating one another to say that we don't need church is just absurd.
 Yeah, but again, I often wonder like when people say that they're not, they don't, you know,
 need the church or they don't want to go to church. Many, I don't know if I'd say all,
 but many of the people that I've seen make that decision, it seems to be a decision made out of
 hurt. So they've experienced some sort of hurt or disappointment with the church. And so as a
 result, they've decided to just back away from church altogether. But and then they start to build
 like a theology around why church isn't important and why you meet a coffee store as church and
 you know, why whatever, but any in any other area of our lives, if we were building a theology
 to support a hurt so that we didn't have to face that hurt and actually get healed of it,
 we'd be going, "Hey, that's not good theology." But in this area, it seems like it's becoming
 trendy to be the people that don't go to church. Oh, so trendy. I've lost count of the number of
 people. And this is all over the world, people I catch up with who've stopped going to church.
 And the only thing I can think of is, "Oh dear God, I'm worried for you."
 It makes me so worried. And again, all over the world, we literally have friends all over the
 world that are making that kind of decision. And they're paying for it. And it breaks my heart.
 When you say paying for it, you mean the corresponding fruit that you see,
 Often just a few years after their decision to no longer go church is calamity.
 It's horrible.
 And it's probably worth noting here.
 I'm not saying that and we're not saying that everybody who stops going to church ends up in calamity.
 Right.
 But what I am saying is every single person I've helped pass through calamity in the last five or six years,
 the thing they all have in common is that they all stop going to church.
 Yeah.
 You know, it's, I find interesting that you mentioned that a lot of the people you know who've left the church have been hurt in church.
 Yeah.
 I, I find it really sad that that would be a motivation for making a major life decision.
 Because making decisions out of her seems a pretty poor way of living.
 Yeah.
 Think about, you know, you were married.
 Yes.
 Your husband left you and divorced you.
 Yeah.
 If an obviously you got hurt with that experience,
 yes, imagine you in that heart made a decision not to have
 anything to do more with men.
 Right.
 You would never have met me.
 Yeah.
 You'd never have three stinkingly gorgeous children.
 Right.
 You wouldn't be on a podcast.
 Right.
 You wouldn't have the level of joy you have right now to you.
 All because you made a decision rooted in hurt.
 And the thing is, if I lived like that and just decided that's it,
 I mean, I have nothing left to do with men and whatever.
 the people around me that love me would say, "Hey, I think you're making a horrible decision."
 And you're actually making a life decision based on pain. Don't you think you want to walk through
 this pain? And then that way you could get healed up and head back towards life?
 Right. But that's assuming you have healthy people around you.
 Right.
 What if you just chose to congregate on Facebook or cultivate friends with other women who'd
 who'd been hurt or betrayed by men. The input from those people would be like, "Yeah, men
 suck!" And you could just form this nice little group of friends who all agree with
 you and your pain who are completely missing the point of what God would want to do in
 your life.
 Right. Little divorce groups.
 Little divorce groups. And yet we kind of see that today in the church. You tend to see
 pockets of people who...
 Church divorce groups.
 Yeah, who are banded together, like, you know, thechurchstucks.com.
 Right.
 I mean, that's actually a website.
 But anyway, I think it just comes back to the,
 it's pretty odd that we would think
 that we know what's better for our Christian walk
 than the master who's leading us in our Christian walk.
 And here is his word saying,
 let us not neglect our meeting together as some people do.
 Like this isn't a trendy new problem.
 This existed back, you know, when Hebrews was written.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Passageth said something,
 I don't forget when it was six months ago,
 He said, "It seems like we're quite content to follow God's will until it contradicts our will."
 And of course, that's immaturity right there.
 But it seems to me, as I've been pondering this, that often we really like Jesus the Savior
 a whole lot more than we do Jesus the Lord.
 Right.
 And that's a shame because his lordship is what leads us into splendor.
 Yeah, I think what happens is too often we get saved.
 And then I don't know through what ever series of events we sometimes
 arrive at this conclusion that you know what, I'm good things.
 Like I actually don't need the rest of what you're offering.
 I'll just take the salvation and leave any of the stuff that you expect me to do.
 And when we think like that, we're actually as far away from good as we might imagine.
 You know, when we got to Grayson, we would joke because the prevailing mindset
 And this mindset isn't unique to grace in or by any means, but the prevailing mindset in a lot of secular places is don't tell me what to do.
 The trouble is that don't tell me what to do is now prevalent not only in secular culture, but also in Christian culture.
 Right.
 And it's actually a mindset that is killing us softly.
 Because the fact is he's Lord of all.
 He actually does get to tell you what to do.
 Then following him means that you submit to him.
 His job is to lead.
 Our job is to follow.
 He only ever leads us into goodness.
 If you notice that.
 Yeah.
 And to state that we know a better route or route or a better
 destination is both horribly arrogant and terribly foolish.
 Yeah.
 And yet I see people willingly and quite proudly making this decision.
 And I'm like, how did we get to here?
 Like this is insanity.
 Yeah.
 And these are people I know or people I've taught, people I've led, people I've
 passed it.
 And I'm, you know, I was kind of down today thinking like, Oh, please change your mind.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And I think, you know, I think when people are out from underneath authority, it's,
 it's, it scares me for a couple of reasons.
 you're out from underneath protection as it were
 when you're out from underneath authority.
 But also, remember once talking to John about it
 and John said, "You know, people that don't have room
 "for authority in their life can't have a Lord."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like, you can't serve a Lord,
 you can't serve Jesus as Lord
 if you have no room for authority.
  </li><li>Well, you'll never serve a king in eternity
 if you haven't learned to serve a leader here on earth.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know that one completely different situation
 similar premise is the sabbatical command on your mother and your father.
 Well, that command on your mother and father is true even if you have bad parents.
 Right. You still honor them.
 And people might say, "But what if they're not Christians? You still honor them. But what if
 they rejected me? You still honor them. The instruction is to you, not them." So it's the
 same with church, we're told not to give up meeting together and we're told to encourage one another
 to meet together. But what if church is boring? Don't give up meeting together. But what if my
 church doesn't do evangelism the way I like? Don't give up meeting together. I mean, the
 instruction is the same and it's just don't give up meeting together. I saw on Facebook a while back,
 Steve Long, who's a pastor in Toronto and a good friend of ours. He posted this very clever statement
 and it was twelve reasons why I quit attending sporting events.
 Yeah, I was clever.
 I want to read this because people come up with similar insane reasons for leaving the church.
 Number one, the coach never came to visit me.
 Number two, every time I went, they asked for money.
 Number three, the people sitting in my row didn't seem very friendly.
 Number four, the seats were very hard.
 Number five, the referees made a decision I didn't agree with.
 Number 6, I was sitting with hypocrites. They only came to see what other people were wearing.
 Number 7, some games went into overtime and I was late getting home.
 Number 8, the band played some songs I had never heard before.
 Number 9, the games are scheduled on my only day to sleep in and run errands.
 Number 10, my parents took me to too many games when I was growing up.
 Number eleven since I read a book on sports I feel I know more than the coaches anyway.
 And number twelve I don't want to take my children because I want them to choose for
 themselves what sport they like best.
 Oh dear.
 What advice would you give for people?
 Let's say we're mentoring people and they happen to be all over the world so they don't
 have the luxury of the numerous amazing churches we have here in Nashville.
 And they say, "You know what?
 I hear what you're saying and I love church and I want to go to church, but I've got really
 bad leaders.
 What advice would you give them?"
 Well, I mean, I would pray and if the Lord says you can move to a different church, then
 find another church, but get plugged in somewhere.
 I think the thing is most of the time, the things that we have issue with at our church,
 they'll follow us to the next church and to the next church, which might mean that the
 issue has more to do with us than it does with the church, but that's just a side note.
 Right.
 That old adage of there's no perfect church and if you find one, don't join, you'll ruin
 it.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 I mean, seriously, there isn't a perfect church and we work for the church and we love the
 church, but there's no perfect churches.
 Right.
 There isn't.
 But I mean, if you're dreadfully unhappy where you are, then just find a church that's
 a great church and go there, but get plugged in and invest there.
 Right.
 Pick healed up leaders.
 Yeah.
 What are people who say my churches is like weird it's got weird cultural norms.
 I'm like if it's not a deal breaker.
 Suck it up like when I go to the movie theater it has weird cultural norms there's like really.
 Annoying trailers and not trailers but like adverts commercials that are just that's terrible right they take forever and yeah i just put up with it if it was that bad i'd go to a different movie theater so.
 There's some churches in Nashville that be great Bible believing brilliant churches, but I wouldn't want to go to them because culturally they don't fit what you know what I love but we're blessed and there's more churches in our cities and there are Starbucks.
 Way more way more.
 But that's what I'd say if it's not deal breakers suck it up if it is a deal breaker just find somewhere to get plugged in to get put into you.
 One of the arguments I often hear is that church is really boring.
 And my, you know, I love what Bill Johnson says, if you're bored, you might want to check the distance between you and the master.
 Yeah.
 But the other thing about being bored in church is it's very, very easy to complain when you have no responsibility.
 Right.
 So actually getting plugged in, not only alleviates your boredom, but might actually help you change some of the culture from within.
 Right.
 The same thing, you know, when people say, I don't like the structure of church.
 Well, again, my encouragement is don't leave because then you've got even left structure
 than you had before.
 Stay and change it from the inside.
 Usually when there's a restlessness in your spirit, it actually could be the Lord in that he's stirring you for something new.
 Could be that there's a call of God on your life to actually plant churches.
 How, how like the enemy would it be to get somebody who's actually got a call of God on them to plant churches to actually leave the church out of frustration.
 So don't be an unwitting vessel for the devil.
 Resist the temptation to be disobedient to scripture.
 Get plugged in, find amazing churches, and if need be, supplement perhaps the teaching
 that you don't feel like you're getting.
 But I mean, all those questions would lead me to ask, like, what's going on in your
 heart in that area?
 All right.
 Are you ready for one more verse?
 I said I wasn't going to teach, but I found another verse I love.
 Ephesians 4, long been one of my favorite verses.
 Yeah, it's a great chapter.
 Okay, it's also written to the church in Ephesus.
 Imagine that's a letter written to a church.
 Yeah.
 If you weren't in a church, you would never have got this revelation.
 Right.
 But I digress.
 Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church, the apostles, the prophets,
 the evangelists and the pastors and teachers.
 Their responsibility is to equip God's people to do His work
 and build up the church, the body of Christ.
 Here's a thought for you. If you remove yourself from the church, which some people
 are doing, then you will not be equipped nor will you be built up. You instantly stunt
 your growth when you choose to leave the church. Because the Bible says that being equipped
 and being built up only happens in the church. Verse 13, this will continue the growing up
 in the maturing, until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's
 Son that we will be maturing the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.
 Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every
 wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever
 they sound like truth. If that isn't a word for the church today, I don't know what it is.
 Because some people will argue, I don't need to be in church because I can just subscribe to this podcast or that podcast or read this blog or read this book.
 I can just be equipped and I can be built up.
 But the Bible says, no, you can't.
 If you try and do that outside of God's plan, which is being in church, it says here that you end up immature.
 says you end up being blown about by every wind of new teaching,
 and you'll be influenced when people tell you lies that sound like the truth.
 Now, I am not saying this applies to everybody,
 but here is a pattern and a progression that I have seen
 in the lives of some people who've left the church.
  </li><li>Okay. - They've left the church?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Then they start questioning Scripture. - Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And then eventually, they question whether Jesus is Lord.
 If that's not the scariest trajectory for a Christian to follow, I don't know what is.
 And yet right here in Ephesians, it's saying the antidote to being blown around and being
 influenced by every wind of new teaching, and oh my gosh, there's a ton of that, is to stay in the
 church.
 Yeah.
 And I mean, I definitely have seen that process or that trajectory happen.
 I've equally seen the marriage just falling apart or the kids falling away from the Lord
 or all those kinds of things happening as a result as well, where maybe they haven't
 actually arrived at, I don't know if I believe in Jesus anymore, but their lives are just
 kind of a shambles.
 And I think that's what, I mean, for both of us, that's what gets us concerned because
 we've walked this process through with so many people.
 And it's always when people start down the process of saying, "Well, I'm just exploring
 and I'm whatever."
 And I'm sort of like, "Why would you be exploring something that God asks you not to do?"
 Right.
 Because that's what makes me concerned.
 It's like, "Well, I get it that you're sort of thinking, "Well, I want the freedom to do
 whatever, but actually there's some places where the Lord doesn't actually allow us a
 freedom because me as a parent, I don't allow my son the freedom to put his hand on the
 burner of my stove.
 Well I want to see what it's like.
 No, it's not going to happen.
 And so sometimes that's how I feel is I want to go.
 Guys like why?
 Why do you want to head down a path that can't lead to anything good?
 Right.
 I wonder if, because we're pastors, we are connected with lots of people who've left
 the church.
 And ironically, once they've left, people leave the church and they don't want our
 input.
 Right?
 That's the truth.
 Like, so people, often a lot of the people who leave the church never wanted pastoral
 input anyway.
 But what I find ironic is when they inevitably hit calamity, we're the first people they
 call.
 Yeah.
 Right?
 of our role, we see a lot of this a lot more. But perhaps if you're just thinking, "Ah,
 you know, what I'm saying is we have the luxury of seeing this timeline worked out."
 Yeah, and probably the average Joe isn't actually seeing the way that that's working out
 necessarily as frequently as we are. You know, and it's the last version of
 to read in Ephesians 16 it says, Christ makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each
 part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow so that the whole body, the
 whole church is healthy and growing and full of love. When you decide to opt out of being
 in the body, you stop growing and you become sick.
 And you just took a hand or a nose or something with you.
 Right.
 We need you.
 Yeah.
 Health and growth is only found in the church.
 It's God's design.
 Anima made the people think that they're the exception in that role.
 I think part of the problem, babe,
 is that people confuse what you need to do for salvation
 versus what you need to do to mature in Christ.
 Right.
 Right.
 What you need to do for salvation is just believe.
 It's an absolute free gift.
 Going to church doesn't get you saved doesn't keep you saved reading the bible fasting praying
 Tithing giving none of that gets you saved right, but what happens is
 We confuse well, you know, I don't need to do that. I'm not under the law
 No, you don't need to do anything
 But if you don't do anything you'll remain shallow and possibly backslide right you do all this stuff
 For the benefit and the life and the growth that it produces in you
 So
 Salvation is a free gift maturity requires intention and action
 Somewhere along the line we think anything that requires intention or action on our part is religiosity
 You're like are you kidding me?
 What do you think how do you think you mature in Christ? Pixie dust like I don't I don't get it. Here's the thing
 Jesus is a pretty smart person.
 Yes.
 And he has a plan A called the church and he doesn't have a plan B.
 Right.
 If you read the New Testament, take out the Gospels for a second.
 The whole of the New Testament is about the church.
 Yeah.
 It's birth and acts.
 It ends in Revelation with seven letters being written from Jesus to the church.
 And everything in between is either letters to the church or about the church
 or concerning church leadership.
 I mean,
  </li><li>Stractions.
  </li><li>All to the church.
  </li><li>And it's all within the context
 of righteous living within the church.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>As a church leader on this podcast,
 I would like to absolutely apologize
 for any other church leaders who may have hurt you,
 who may have said unkind things,
 may have said controlling things,
 I'd absolutely include myself in that.
 If A.J. and I have ever said anything that has hurt you,
 If we've ever been seriously sorry, we would love to connect with you about that and reconcile
 that because the last thing we would want is anybody to be away from the church, period,
 especially out of her or offense towards us or towards church leaders.
 But we're jealous for you to grow in love and to grow in fullness and to grow in richness
 and maturity.
 And all of that only happens within a church construct.
 Yeah, I'm fed up of seeing amazing Christians leaving the church
 Getting tossed around by every new fancy teaching and then usually shipwrecking their lives
 Yeah, please don't be one of those people. Yeah, I would imagine lots of people. I've got lots of feedback for us
 We would love to hear it genuinely go to Alan and AJ calm slash feedback
 You can give us all the feedback you'd like we will read every part of it
 If we said something you don't agree with, if you said something you do agree with, if you want to tell us your story, we'd love to hear from you.
 Go ahead and do that this week.
 If you're one of the people that hasn't been in church, can I implore you?
 Can I encourage you to find a church and to get plugged back in?
 Yeah, I was thinking like I get, I get getting hurt and wanting to leave.
 Like I get that and I, you know, I don't know about you, babe, but I've been hurt by church.
 Lots of times, you know, because there's people at church and everybody's human and people make mistakes, you know
 I mean, I remember one time in like 94
 When I had a conversation with a church staff member and they were like
 Hey quit your job and start working for the church on Monday
 And you know, you're gonna oversee the you know this that and the other and I was like, okay
 So I totally went and quit my job and then I came on Monday and they were just talking
 Hypothetical and I had to go find a new job. Oh my gosh
 I know and I was like I remember being so mad so upset so hurt and
 But I'm like what am I gonna do? I'm not gonna walk away from God. I'm not gonna walk away from church
 So I went and found a new job and I processed it through with somebody that I did prayer counseling with and I
 forgave the people involved and
 You know, I'm still in relationship with those people and everything's fine
 You know, but I mean the other option is
 You know, you think about when we've had we haven't had many huge fights in our marriage, right?
 But we've had one or two where it's like I'm yelling at you to get out of the house
 You're totally unreasonable in those moments, right?
 And you're like, or you're going, hey, that's it.
 I'm leaving.
 The Lord says to you, where are you going to go?
 Right.
 Like, where are you going to go?
 And for some reason, with the church,
 we think is now an option where if we were actually viewing
 it as a marriage, which it is because we're
 the bride of Christ, married to the Son of God,
 then we would go, oh, there's not actually an option for me
 to retreat and lick my wounds even.
 The thing to do is to come back and go, "Hey, guess what, church leader?" or whatever.
 "I'm really hurt. Can I work this through with you?"
 And come at it that way rather than letting it derail your whole life because you got hurt.
 I'm not saying you didn't get hurt. I'm sure you did. But come back and let God bring some healing.
 If you'd like the show notes for this week's episode head to alan and aj.com/65.
 We hope you have a tremendous week. Yes. Filled with joy, filled with glory, filled with friendship,
 and we'll be back here same time, same place, next week.
