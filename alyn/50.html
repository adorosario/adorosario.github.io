<p> Age Jones yes sir are you good are you are you are you are you are I am very
 stripy are you ready for our weekly catch up I am what do we do Monday and
 Tuesday we had our final week of the school and graduated our class of 2015
 which is crazy right it is crazy four years of school now done and a total joy
 to see everybody graduate that's amazing but marked by sadness and weirdness that
 we don't get to see the moment is in Tuesdays.
 It does feel weird that tomorrow they won't be there when we go in.
 Or the other highlight of my week.<br/>
 What?<br/>
 I got a new iPhone.<br/>
 Yes, you do.<br/>
 But it wasn't really a new iPhone.<br/>
 It's just the same iPhone as the one I had before, but they swapped out because it was
 a fault with the screen.<br/>
 Doesn't matter.<br/>
 Still a new iPhone.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Still joy.<br/>
 And still I got to sit in the Apple Store.
 Right.<br/>
 And got recalibrated, Tom.<br/>
 What could possibly be better?<br/>
 The big news, however, for us this week is that John and Carol came in this weekend
 and are staying with us.<br/>
 Yay!<br/>
 Welcome John and Carol, aren't it?<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 You guys did so great being quiet for that whole, like, couple of minutes.
 I know it was really hard.<br/>
 [laughter]<br/>
 How weird is it you staying in our house when it used to be us staying in your house?
 I know, isn't that fun?<br/>
 We're thinking that we should build a new house here and then you can move to Nashville and
 live in our basement and use Nashville as your hub.
 That would be fun.<br/>
 That would be amazing.<br/>
 But I think we might get some fights.<br/>
 Probably true.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Steve and the rest of the team.<br/>
 We can take them.<br/>
 We would have fun though.<br/>
 We would have nonstop fun.<br/>
 We would.<br/>
 But I worry that we would eat way too much good food.
 We eat a lot of barbecue.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 You want chocolate?<br/>
 Although, Kyle, you've been particularly lenient on me since you've
 been here about my chocolate consumption.
 Yes, because yesterday I kind of overdid it.
 Didn't want to be the pot calling the kettle black.
 That's it.<br/>
 It's not your fault.<br/>
 We did feed you very good chocolate.<br/>
 It's very good.<br/>
 We ate chocolate yesterday.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 The coffee chocolate.<br/>
 Oh, that's it.<br/>
 And I abstained but made up for it tonight with my Mexican Coca-Cola.
 You only abstained because you don't eat coffee and so you don't like coffee.
 Still an abstinence when I'm calling you that.
 All right, for those of you who may not know, John and Carol, if you listen to this podcast,
 you will have heard us talk about them a lot. John and Carol are pastors in Toronto and
 remarkably in 1994, and I'm going to tell you the story in a second, but in 1994,
 the Holy Spirit visited their church and without any exaggeration or sense of hyperbole,
 literally brought worldwide revival, which you guys have been stewarding for 21 years now.
 I haven't had a job for twenty one years in terms of consistency.
 I just think that's amazing.<br/>
 And I'm sure that this story has been told over and over, but I would love to hear you guys tell
 the story in your own words.<br/>
 So take us back to January 20th.<br/>
 It's a Thursday night, 1994.<br/>
 Tells what happened.<br/>
 We were excited and poised for something because we just returned from our
 Argentina, where we had both been prayed for and received a powerful download, plus we'd
 had three amazing prophetic words such as, "You're going to the moon."
 "Power fire for the literal people out there."
 It didn't literally say you're going to the moon.
 No, it said that such preposterous things were about to happen, that they might as well have
 said something as far out as, "You're going to the moon."
 Thank you for clarifying that.<br/>
 So when Randy Clark was invited and accepted to come, he came in a bit of fear and trembling,
 thinking, "You know, it's only ever happened once before."
 And we're like, "Well, whatever happens."
 But he shared about how he had been rescued by the Lord from very discouraging bordering
 on depression and the Holy Spirit came into his life through successive seeking more of
 God at Rodney our Brown meetings.<br/>
 You're in there and he received an impartation.
 And so I invited Randy to come and shared his heart and in the end gave an invitation
 for those who would like him to pray for them to come forward and he would pray.
 And that's when it all happened.<br/>
 It just...<br/>
 are we talking about? This is a Thursday night. About 1.30 I would guess.
 Okay, so 130 hungry people, Thursday night, non-normal night you'd come out,
 just a regular altar call. Yeah, I don't know how hungry but certainly curious and
 trusting enough to come along and see what's going on. All right, so far so
 good with being in church churches like that, 100 times and what happens?
 It's the dead of winter. It's cold, snowy, and there we are in there. And in the midst of that,
 when Randy said, "Come, people, endeavor to get up, and that's when God's power hit them and
 virtually flatten the room." And this great commotion arose, people wailing, crying, laughing,
 shaking, falling, etc. And we're all there. A bit bewildered. And Carolyn, I'm not sure
 what your recollection is. I was just thinking, Oh my gosh, this is fantastic. Lord, Holy
 Spirit, you have come. And then I remember looking at Mary Audrey, who was our women's
 pastor and she was in another room, came through the door. Her mouth went open and she fell
 flat in her face and couldn't speak for 45 minutes, which is unheard of. But the whole
 room was just in chaos. It was just like a bomb drop for 40 minutes on the floor.
 Yeah, she was. It was incredible.<br/>
 Has you guys ever seen anything like that before? Never.
 not to that degree. I mean, in our team now.
</p><ul>
  <li>One's and two's.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're sorry.
  </li><li>So describe for people who weren't there,
 you know, 'cause we're so accustomed
 to the terminology right now,
 but some people, you know, who are listening to this,
 they may have never, they might not have a grid
 or a paradigm for what it means to,
 for when the Holy Spirit showed up.
 So what was happening that night,
 if you were to describe what was happening to people,
 what did it look like?
  </li><li>People got so filled and overflowing
 the presence of God that they were debilitated and unable to not only stand, they were unable
 to stay sitting in their chair for the most part. And people were just all over the place,
 totally overcome by God's power, presence and love.
 So bodies on the floor? Yeah, people laughing,
 Criks up in the air, legs up in the air shaking, just bouncing up and down on their
 seats. I mean, somewhere running. And it was just like a bomb dropped. And, you know,
 in the scriptures that says like the Holy Spirit fell. Right. Well, we had before this,
 we had no grid for that. Right. But boy, we sure had it after that night.
 And Randy at this point is just super nervous, super meek. I mean, I think one of the criticisms
 people have is, oh, you know, yeah, these meetings, you hype them up and it's all emotionalism.
 But it sounds like Randy was a super nervous about speaking.
 Yes, he was.
 He doesn't sound like it was very hyped up.
 He was just like, I guess if you want me to pray for you to come forward?
 That's exactly right.
 And then the Holy Spirit showed up.
 So how do you like talk me through what happens next?
 That's Thursday night.
 It's the most glorious thing that's ever happened.
 Then what do you do?
 How do you go home from that meeting?
 excited and excited about what's going to happen the next night is God going to show up again
 because we didn't know like it happened once and but sure enough it happened again the second
 night and by then the word had started to filter out a little bit so there was more there on the
 Friday night and the same sort of thing happened at which point I said Randy you know we need to
 to keep going with these meetings because we had only planned four nights.
 So I think by the time we got to Sunday, we called his wife and she agreed that he could
 stay two more days.
 Am I, remember this correctly, but when you asked him to come for four days, he didn't
 want to because he only had three messages?
 Yeah, he wanted to bring his youth pastor with him because he said, "I only have two
 messages."
 Two messages.
 He needed someone else to bring the other two, but an actual, actually what happened was
 he brought one of those messages and ran into the other three because obviously things had
 exploded for him also.
 And he came sort of wondering, "Oh gosh, we don't know if anything will happen," but
 He had a profound prophetic word that he was to trust me now says the Lord because I'm
 going to begin to really use you.
 So this is it.
 And at home it was really funny because we would get home really late.
 Because we didn't want to miss it because we didn't know whether God was going to come
 again to more night or what.
 So, they'd be jot on a phone and Randy on another phone and they'd be calling everybody
 that they knew and they were just like for hours.
 We got a couple of hours sleep and they were up on the phone.
 They were just excited.
 We didn't have two lines for a while.
 No, but you know.
 That took a week or so to get that second.
 Right, that's true.
 And then how do you go from 130 people to like when did you start getting running into
 problems with space?
 Because word spread really quick.
 Really quick.
 I would say within two weeks we were maxed.
 Yeah.
 And we started then to move to the banquet hall, which could hold many more about 7 or
 hundred in the main room versus our 400. And so when we couldn't have the banquet hall,
 we'd use our overflow via closed circuit TV.
 And so how big is your church before this happens? Like your church at the end of a runway
 on Dixie Road in Toronto? How many people are coming here?
 If you counted them all, including the ones who didn't come about 400.
 the one you didn't have. I only came once a month or something.
 And then within, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but within a month or so,
 you have thousands of people trying to come to your church. Yes.
 And our people can't get in Sunday morning. There's a line up, like starting,
 couldn't get a chair, couldn't get a chair, couldn't get a parking spot.
 At what point were you guys saying, this is bigger than us? Do you remember the first time we were
 like, oh my God, like when people started coming from England and Australia, like at what point
 did it tip you over to think this could be something? Well, I think by the time we'd gone into our
 second week, we had a team meeting in our favorite restaurant. We had a back room in the restaurant.
 The lady was a Christian and a very good friend and that was our war room in there.
 And I remember saying, guys, we need to plan because this could go on for a long time.
 And Azusa Street went for three and a half years.
 And they looked at me like, are you out of your mind?
 We can't possibly do this for three and a half years.
 You're having meetings every night at this point.
 Yeah.
 And I said, hang on, we will plan to rotate in and out on and off.
 This will have to be a team effort, but we are not stopping.
 Now, at this point have, I mean, you hear me out on this one, but at this point, have miracles
 started happening. Of course, the very manifest presence of God is a miracle, but our people
 are getting healed, are there signs of wonders happening, or is it just unbelievable glory at this
 point? Mostly glory, but there, there were miracles happening. One guy who came in totally deaf,
 It's like a boom and both busy or so.
 Nobody prayed for me.
 Just walk in the room.
 News like that will spread.
 Yeah.
 I've been in conferences with you guys around the world.
 And when we do passes, conferences, people are often asking, you know, what did you guys do to get the nations to your church?
 The very notion that you guys had some sort of slick marketing plan for this is just absurd.
 Just God showed up and people were hungry and he just responded.
 It was amazing because we didn't have the internet at that point.
 We didn't have YouTube.
 We didn't have anything, but just word of mouth.
 It was incredible.
 How fast it's bringing.
 We had facts.
 We had phone and a fax and phone word of mouth.
 And I remember getting a fax from Roger Mitchell from England.
 So he sent me a fax, John, what's going on?
 Um, we're hearing a stuff going on in your church.
 And I took his facts and wrote on it, Roger, God is moving.
 Get over here as soon as you can.
 Send it back.
 And when he received the facts, he read it and immediately fell out under the power.
 That's awesome.
 You must have stories, you know, what I would call absurd stories like that,
 just coming out of your ears from over the years of stuff that God did that
 would have just, you know, again, outside of your paradigm.
 So let me fast forward.
 So this is going on one year, two years, three years, four years.
 At some point you were Toronto's most visited tourist attraction.
 So the customs and agent guys came to the church because everybody was coming
 through Pearson Airport saying I'm here for the Toronto Revival.
 I'm here for the Toronto Revival.
 I'm here for the Toronto Revival.
 And then news cameras start showing up and you start getting global
 I mean, I heard about it in Scotland. I mean, it went around the world. Were you, I mean,
 I know the answers. No, but were you prepared for that? No. No. And then what happened when
 you were in the Sunday times, you know, the British broadsheet newspaper in the Sunday
 times. In Time magazine, we're in Newsweek, Merv Griffin show, all that kind of stuff.
 And then inevitably criticism shows up.
 This isn't God.
 This is all fake.
 You're kind of at revival leaders.
 This is the devil.
 When did you become aware that you were an international sensation and a potential tool
 for the devil?
 Do you remember the date?
 Did your team bring you headlines?
 Were you guys just having such a good time?
 Well, you know, I think that that sort of stuff was mixed in from almost from the very
 beginning, it was all proportionate, you know, so one or two percent of the comments contained
 I don't believe that.
 It's all emotional.
 It's just, you know, but it was far outweighed by all the glowing testimonies of things that
 had happened to people.
 So we didn't really pay a whole lot of attention.
 I found in my own life and in the lives of people that I pastor that God deliberately
 the offensive mind to reveal the heart.
 So, you know, the whole message of salvation
 is offensive to the lost, right?
 And the cross is a stumbling block.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you get over that fence on the other side
 of the revelation, it's glorious.
 You think, how did I ever find this offensive?
 And then perhaps you go to church
 and you see people raising their hands.
 And for me, that was offensive.
 Like, why would you raise their hands?
 You need to go to the bathroom.
 Do you have a question?
 It's offensive.
 And then, you know, for me, I started the Bible
 and realized, oh, it's in the Bible.
 It's totally fine.
 So I start raising my hands and worship.
 And then maybe you go and you see someone
 get prayed for and they fall down, you know, etc, etc, etc.
 My point there is we all get comfortable with a certain level of
 offense till it's no longer offensive until God does something else.
 You guys have had some crazy stuff.
 I mean, we've all been there where you're comfortable with God's doing this.
 Yeah.
 What do you remember some of the thresholds where you're like, okay, God,
 I love you, but you have to help me with this.
 Is this you?
 Do you remember any of the thresholds that got caught and caught offensive for you?
 Well, I think in the very beginning, people falling down sort of en masse, like groups
 of them, with piles of people, men and women piled on the floor.
 And it just, it was chaotic in a sense, and you're wondering, "God, why do you like this?
 I know it's you, but I don't understand why."
 And that led us to sort of, let's get lines on the floor and make it at least a little
 more organized. It helped in many ways. It was like, if you want prayer, come put your toes on
 one of the tape lines, and that's just people organize themselves at that point, and then we
 could work with catchers. If you have hundreds of people a night, one of prayer, hundreds of people.
 We made a point of they've come for his presence. We want them to be touched by God.
 What about when gold teeth start happening? Because I got used to people falling down,
 but I remember the night I saw gold teeth and I just thought this is, I mean this is just offensive,
 it's absurd, it's ridiculous, oh come on. And then I saw, you know, with my own eyes, amalgam
 fillings turning to gold. And you know, you don't have any box to put it in, but you're just like,
 I just witnessed a miracle. Did that trouble you? Was that offensive? Was that, or were you guys
 just so happy that God could do whatever he wanted? Well, you go first, Carol.
 I just think it's first started in South Africa and
 It was like oh my gosh Lord
 This is incredible and I remember he filled like a dentist
 mouth with
 gold and
 And then we just kept seeing these amazing
 Miracles and and and then the young people like you know 12 to 16
 I mean, instead of gold, it would turn white.
 And the parents would say, "Nope, I'm sure they had,
 I paid for a Malcolm Feelings."
 And they did it white.
 And then they started happening at home.
 And we were just like blown away by God's absolute mercy.
 And when Heidi Baker got one, that was the,
 that was awesome.
 That was awesome.
  </li><li>Tell us story.
 Because anyway, Heidi was just so, you know,
 'cause Heidi gives everything away.
 And so, you know, she would give her,
 but she had this toothache this night
 and she was just asking for a prayer for her toothache.
 So John started to minister
 and he started to minister with, you know,
 anybody has a tooth problem
 because tooth decay all over the world is a major.
  </li><li>Health problem. - Yeah.
 And so Heidi says, "Well, I've got a bad tooth."
 And so we don't put your hand on your tooth and whatever.
 Show it to the person next to you
 and see if God's done anything.
 Wow, the look on her face.
 She was just astounded.
 So she quickly, you know,
 anybody got a mirror?
 Anybody got a mirror here?
 Sure enough, she had this grand, massive, gold tooth
 where I had no pain.
 It was just really wonderful.
 one after the other after the other.
  </li><li>It was astounding.
 We saw it in Argentina and thought,
 "Fair enough, they probably need dental work down there."
 And then like Carol said, South Africa,
 that's where it got going for us,
 a little bit in Mexico before that.
 And then exploded in South Africa.
 We brought video footage home,
 showed it to a conference in Toronto,
 and then we had like 150 people get gold crowns,
 gold teeth, whatever that night.
 And it was mind blowing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And the Lord really spoke to me
 'cause it was just,
 it got a hold of my unbelief
 that I didn't really appreciate that I had.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And He's reminding me,
 "How is it okay in Argentina?"
 But you don't think I can do stuff like that here.
 And so, we just had to realize
 nothing is impossible with you.
  </li><li>For me, the gold teeth was one of the ways
 that I won some people to the Lord from national
 because they wanted to come over and see it
 'cause I've been talking about it.
 And then one of the VPs got a gold tooth
 and gave his life back to the Lord, which was amazing.
 But it was quite, you know, it was quite funny.
 I brought six people in and, you know,
 one of them got a gold tooth and the rest,
 they were all unsaved and none of them were offended at all.
 You know, they weren't offended by anything.
 The people on the floor, nothing.
 They were just like, "Sure.
 Why not? Why couldn't God do that? You know, so I thought it was quite funny.
 Well, it is amazing, isn't it? And the criticism and the surprise often comes from
 Christian people or religious people who are into it only up to a certain level.
 So when you go deeper or the supernatural becomes more obvious and evident, then
 They're shocked, really, and they're trying to find reasons why that couldn't be because it's not part of their experience.
 Yeah, help me justify my uncomfortableness.
 It's crazy.
 Randy described it so well one time when he talked about many evangelicals live in a culture of unbelief.
 Right.
 Yeah, that was my experience, my whole life growing up.
 Have to be wary of anything to do with emotion anything that can't be tested or assessed and how do you quantify what God's doing when he doesn't want to be in a box when he's deliberately purposing to offend the mind.
 That's a tricky one.
 Yeah, but the child I believe it's intentionally there's a booby trap.
 And if you stumble at it you lose because the whole thing is designed to cater to.
 The child like tell us what the Lord said to you when you said Lord I know that you like it when people fall down.
 We talked about the two conditions of the human heart I love that yes because he said well.
 The conditions of the human heart or fear on the one hand and pride on the other.
 And so when he overwhelms someone in the Holy Spirit, they have to trust him to a certain degree and that deals with fear.
 Pride on the other hand is saying things like, well, I want God, but I don't want that.
 And so now there's a certain.
 Stigma, if you will, or a certain humility that must go along with that.
 And so it's very much something that deals with incorrect attitudes of the heart.
 Teaches is to trust, get over a fear in the one hand, because people don't want to fall down.
 I mean, if they don't want to fall down and be a public spectacle in front of everyone,
 especially if they're fearful and self-conscious.
 On the other hand, if they're macho and...
 Full of pride.
 Pride. I'm not going to want to fall down in front of these people.
 I've seen many people kind of...Carol's come along, "Can I pray for you?"
 They cross their arms and sort of put their head back a bit and say,
 "Give it your best shot, little lady."
 And then she would pray for them and yell over them or something.
 would just go over with their eyes wide open and unbelief.
  </li><li>Right, that's something happened.
  </li><li>What on earth is happening to me?
 And so it's just a whole range of people
 who are very keen to have a spiritual experience,
 but others that were very skeptical.
 And he touches them too many times, so it's all good.
  </li><li>I think the biggest thing was the change in people's hearts.
  </li><li>Right.
 You know, the outward manifestations might look really, you know, crazy or bizarre or
 not really offensive to people watching them.
 But when you talk to the people and you hear what God did with them, oh my gosh, it was
 just one testimony after another after another.
 And that's what we loved was the change in their hearts.
 And they loved Jesus more than they ever had loved him before.
 And they wanted to share their faith more than they ever had before.
 According to...
 Some marriages were better.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 The relationship with Jesus was better.
 Kids' relationship was better with their parents.
 It was wonderful.
 You know, after 21 years, it's hard to quantify the fruit because it's so exponential.
 You know, if you just take two people like Heidi Baker, what happened to Heidi when she
 He came and the whole fruit that came from Iris, which is absolutely rooted in her visit
 being stuck to the floor for seven days and seven nights.
 He takes someone like Bill and Benny who came hungry for God and realized we'll give
 the rest of our life for this.
 Everything that's happened out of Bethel.
 Our lives, like A.G. and I, just haven't caused to reflect that in one very, very real sense,
 I wouldn't have the wife I have if it wasn't for the revival, if it wasn't for you guys.
 And so we're just one couple.
 I'm pretty sure I'd be dead.
 Right.
 If it wasn't for you.
 But then, you know, we just graduated all these students this year.
 That would never have happened.
 Right.
 Had God not put, you know, it's just this amazing outflow of what God's done and the knock on
 effect in people's lives.
 And for 21 years, talk to me about how you guys didn't screw it up.
 Oh, God, oh God.
 Right, but seriously, can you imagine if the Lord just woke you up on the 19th, it was like,
 "Hi guys, how are you? I don't want to freak you out, speaking to you audibly and everything,
 but just so you know, tomorrow I'm going to give you the longest running revival in church history.
 Don't screw up." Like you would have freaked out. And so in the end, he just drops it on you
 and lets you manage it. But what would you say are some of the things you learned,
 how not to screw up an international revival? Give us some of the things.
 Because there's not a handbook written for that.
 I think John, his love for people.
 And I mean, he just so loved to see the testimonies.
 And so it was testimony driven rather than a person driven.
 And he would share his platform all the time and, you know,
 encourage me to speak and encourage others to speak.
 And so it wasn't sort of a one man show.
 It was everybody and people would come
 and they would say, "Well, John and Carol weren't even there."
 And there was some kind of worship team that was okay,
 but I don't remember what the speaker's name was,
 but God met me.
 And that just, we just loved that
 because it was, you know, it took the pressure of it,
 was all about what he was doing, not our own striving.
 And again and again, I think your love, John,
 for sharing his pulpit and sharing,
 having people share their testimonies.
  </li><li>Love. - Two of the things that--
  </li><li>That's a huge lack of control.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, I really have a desire to see it be kingdom-wide and global.
 And so we've always realized that, hey, what God wants to do is so much bigger than us.
 And He's graciously given us a portion.
 But it's so much bigger than us.
 So part of our job is raising up people and giving them visibility, those that we feel good about.
 We want them on our platform so that hopefully they'll catch fire and go home with it.
 And many, many did.
 And so you named a couple.
 But there's so many of them, like David Campbell from England and Terriapel from Australia
 and Frank Houston from Australia.
 These guys went home with it and it all erupted in their churches and they, you know, to go on a ship for it and kept it going and going and going and going.
 And so that's what we want to see.
 So our motto on the church, even before it broke out, was that we may walk in God's love and then give it away.
 And so we just kept giving it away as much as we could.
 "Hey, more on you, fire on you, have more."
 And people would get so touched
 and it was not uncommon to see people
 out under the power for two or three hours.
 Unbelievable.
 We had a guy just two months ago at our leaders conference.
 He was out for seven hours.
 Wow.
 When he came around.
 He really had to go to the.
 He had a revelation of God.
 So I'm sure.
 And I'm sure he had to go the bathroom too.
 But he never said that part in his testimony.
 I probably wouldn't have either.
 So what we want to do is fill the earth with his glory.
 And Carol and I learned early on
 that we could proactively facilitate that
 by praying for a person and then continuing to pray for that person.
 So the blessing that they were getting went deeper and deeper and more intense and stronger.
 And so they were ready to explode.
 And so as overgains the light touch, there was a profound touch of God that ignited something
 within them and then they would go home with it.
 So it is like a fire in as much as it's very, very contagious and still is to this day.
 Thank you, Lord.
 As you reflect back on 21 years, is there anything you would do differently if you could
 do it all again?
 If you go back in time knowing what you now know, what would you tell yourself?
 Is there anything you would change?
 This is only one thing that comes to mind.
 I think I would be much more proactive in communicating with John Wimber and making sure
 that if a relationship there had to come to an end, it would be much more of a congenial
 thing rather than an abrupt year out because I think that set the revival back at one level.
 I think it frightened a lot of people, embarrassed a lot of people, and many were saying, "Well,
 Maybe it's not God, maybe we better just slow down.
  </li><li>'Cause at the time the vineyard were the
  </li><li>Cutting edge.
  </li><li>- The brainage people. You know, like, I mean, mainstream evangelicals
 might look at the vineyard and go, "Man, those guys are over the edge."
 So if they're rejecting this thing, dear Lord, how crazy must this be?
 Is that what the feeling was?
  </li><li>That's the effect.
 You know, all that was unfortunate, but you know, God's doing it his way
 and things beyond our control, I suppose.
 hindsight is great, but we were over our heads
 with trying to stay up with what was going on around us.
 And so many of those guys were already on board
 that we just never anticipated that one really.
 John Wimber had a very, very profound
 and godly healthy impact on our lives for the most part.
 And he was one of our heroes.
 We loved him, we learned so much from him and everything else.
 I think he got caught in a crossfire about a number of issues pertaining to it, the strength
 of it and particularly the manifestations were a bit off the chart for him and many around
 him.
 And so all of that needs to be talked through.
 But it was moving really fast and rapidly and more and more, you know, videotapes and
 on and on.
 We're just spreading it all over the world.
 Can you imagine if YouTube was around back then?
 Oh, I know.
 Yes.
 And that's what excites me about another wave coming because it's going to be just so viral,
 almost immediately it's going to be amazing because everyone will be able to watch the
 intensity of it all. So we do this little thing sometimes where we have a little fun doing rapid
 fire names. So I say a name and then you just say the first word that comes to mind when you think
 of that person. Okay. Are you ready? Bill Johnson. Awesome. Fantastic. Pope Francis. Amazingly humble.
 Joseph garlington radical Bobby Conner amazingly prophetic and very gentle fights with bears
 Right, but he is gentle he is he's lovely
 Artie Kendall Christian statesman awesome lover of the Holy Spirit
 David Campbell funny very smart very witty
 full of wisdom
 full of love Mike Bickle mr. Intensely full of prayer lover of Jesus
 Lou angle prayer warrior Heidi Baker awesome lover of Jesus
 Well guys we I mean we could have gone in any direction tonight
 I feel like I could just sit here and mine your brains which I've done over the years
 But I'm jealous for everybody to hear about those things before I ask you to pray for our listeners
 For an impartation for more of the Holy Ghost
 John you head off to Australia in a couple of days. Where are you going in Australia?
 We're doing one of our leader schools in Sydney and then I'll be visiting a church in Adelaide, Australia
 For two days on the weekend and then going to Melbourne, Australia and
 being being there with the other John Arnett in catch the fire Australia in that can be confusing at all in catch the fire
 Melbourne. Yeah. And from there flying over to Stuart and Lindley, it catch the fire
 Auckland in New Zealand. Or Jealous, of course, because you can see all the people who love this
 thing. I know. I know. And so, yes. For our Australian and our Kiwi listeners, you can see
 John live. And then you have a big conference every year, your catch a fire conference,
 your signature conference, which happens in September. Tell us who you have coming this year.
 Kenneth Copeland, who we had a wonderful connection with 10 months ago when we were over to see Pope Francis.
 He was there also, of course.
 A whole other story we didn't have time for.
 Yeah, but anyway, we really, really liked him and hit it off and invited him to come and lo and
 behold, he accepted so. That's great. He's coming. Reinhard Bonke, who's been with us a couple of
 times is coming back to be a part of that. They are good friends. And Marcus Lamb from
 Dayspring Television will be there also. So it is going to be a blockbuster for conference.
 The Holy Spirit will be there as well. As a headlight, as a guest.
 And if people want more information about Australia, they can go to john and carol.org.
 And if they want more information about catch the fire conference, you can go to catchafire.com
 and get tickets, all the information about that conference too.
 Yes.
 Well, guys, thank you so much.
 I know that you guys are here on a mini vacation, many rest,
 and we've put you through the ringer tonight.
 But what you do is one last favor.
 Would you just welcome the Holy Spirit to come into the lives
 of our listeners, whether they're at work, in the car.
 Let's just get everybody full of the Holy Spirit one more time.
 Oh, Holy Spirit, we just so thank you for your faithfulness.
 And Lord for these wonderful listeners
 that are tuned into this podcast,
 I just ask that your presence would come upon them now,
 come and fill them like you love to do,
 come and let them fall more in love with Jesus.
 Let them know how wonderful the Father is.
 Just let your presence increase and increase and increase.
 Lord in your presence, there is fullness of joy.
 At your right hand, pleasure forevermore.
 The joy of being with you is unsurpassed.
 And so I pray that your presence would draw very near
 and fall upon us before us, the inward journey for us,
 the upward journey that is worshiping and blessing you.
 And then the outward journey for others,
 which is our mission in life.
 And Lord, as we get filled up with you with your love
 and your amazing presence,
 now we have something both to worship you with
 and to share with a broken, hurting, needy world.
 And so come Holy Spirit
 and fall upon your dear people right now
 and just let them know that this is within their reach.
 This is available.
 It is the Father's will, His good pleasure to give us the kingdom.
 And we want that kingdom to come in power and love and fill us, Lord,
 and equip us so that we can rise to our full potential in Christ,
 that our ministry would be fruitful and would bring you honor and glory.
 So granted in Jesus name,
 Come and let your fire fall in Jesus name.
