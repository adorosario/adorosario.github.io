<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode two 50
 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Mr. Jones, what are we talking about today?
  </li><li>Well, first of all, we need to know
 that it's so ridiculously hot in our basement.
  </li><li>It's not that hot.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, you have--
  </li><li>It's actually lovely.
  </li><li>Again, he advised right yesterday
 you took a giant fleece to work with you.
 It was a medium sized fleece.
 It was as fluffy as you could imagine.
 But we have to turn off our air conditioning
 up on our ground floor of our house.
 This is like, we're in our basement right here,
 which is an unfinished basement.
 So it has no air.
 But it's amazing how just turning off the air upstairs,
 even though nothing's being filtered down here.
 Why would it get hot down here?
 And why would it be cool?
 It's just hot down here 'cause it's 100 degrees outside.
 So I'm like sticky already.
 We haven't even started.
 You are.
 We better get on with it then.
 weekly catch up is super short.
 If you listened to last week's episode,
 you heard about Tia breaking her finger.
 Did we even talk?
 I don't even remember.
 Do we talk about not only did Tia,
 oh no, we didn't.
 Oh, here's a weekly update.
 So last week we were talking about how Tia,
 you know, had to go for surgery, you know, came home.
 We recorded the episode kind of almost straight after that.
 No sooner did we finish recording the episode,
 but we go upstairs once we're finished, you know,
 done that.
 And my eldest daughter comes home and she's sick.
 And so we have to take her immediately.
 Yep. She gets off the bus, not feeling good.
  </li><li>To the doctors, gets throat swab.
 Does she have COVID?
 Does she have strep throat?
 Thankfully she has neither, but she doesn't get any better.
 And it turns out she has a double ear infection.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Went back to the doctors on Sunday.
  </li><li>That's old news now, 'cause she's on antibiotics.
 And so far, everybody is good in the house.
  </li><li>This week, as long as you don't sit on anybody's hand again,
 we should be okay.
  </li><li>I accidentally sat on Tia's hand, the broken hand.
 But what I would like to say is I didn't put my full weight on it.
 I just happened to be like kind of lowering my posterior and her hand was
 accidentally there and I jumped up immediately on her.
 Well, well, yelp.
 Yelp. Other than that, there's not really much else going on.
 Lots of people that we deeply love have got COVID.
 And so I'm sad about that.
 We've been praying for them and checking in on them.
 and I just please Lord Jesus help us bless us remove COVID please.
 Anything else?
 You watch anything?
 You like anything?
  </li><li>Do I watch anything or like anything?
 I don't think so.
 I think it's just been a super busy week.
 We're getting back in the swing of things,
 school starting in a couple of weeks.
 And so. - School as an SSL?
  </li><li>Yeah, SSL.
  </li><li>How excited are you?
 I'm a scale of one to 10.
  </li><li>I'm super excited, but there's so much to do.
 So it feels like every day is super full
 and there's lots to do.
  </li><li>That's great and everything,
 but we didn't talk about big, bad breakfast.
 I knew there was something.
  </li><li>Yeah, we went to big, bad breakfast.
  </li><li>Tia, milking her surgery for everything she can get,
 said that she wanted to go to a restaurant
 called Big Bad Breakfast.
 And so, you know, you have to--
  </li><li>She wanted to go right after surgery,
 but of course she's like out of it.
 And so we took her the next morning
 to bid Big Bad Breakfast.
  </li><li>Is that what's going on?
  </li><li>Big. - I had fried chicken
 on a homemade biscuit with sausage gravy.
 And I'll tell you right now, it was absolutely delicious.
 You had like a healthy version,
 which I don't know how you've managed
 to find anything healthy, southern breakfast.
  </li><li>Well, it was like a scrambled egg hash kind of thing
 with vegetables and avocado and.
  </li><li>So you had pancakes the size of our head.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, well that was our weekly catch-up.
 Sometimes you have big weekly catch-ups
 all the time, so you don't.
 Our topic this week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I don't even remember what I called it.
 I called it something about.
  </li><li>Something about authority.
  </li><li>Something about authority.
 Something about the blessing of living under authority.
  </li><li>Let's call it that, the blessing of living under authority.
  </li><li>I don't know what, I don't know what we'll end up calling it,
 but it's something about the goodness of living with authority.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the verse that's been running around my head
 is Romans 13, I don't know, verse four or something like that.
 Hang on, I wrote it down, so I don't even need to guess.
 You know, if I was smart, I'd get Chris to re-edit this,
 So it sounded like a no more I'm talking about,
 but no, it was Romans 13 verse four, where it says this,
 "For the one in authority is God's servant for your good."
 And I've been thinking about, like when I consider our lives,
 I am so grateful for the authority that we have in our lives.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I would go so far as to say,
 and I haven't even checked this with you,
 that probably one of the major reasons
 for so much of the fruitfulness in our life is that the Holy Spirit has been kind enough to teach us
 to honor authority and give us an understanding of why authority is good and how to partner with
 authority in our lives. Yeah, I would agree with that. Oh, good. Because that's going to be my next
 question. Do you agree with that? Of course I do, sir. That passage in Romans 13, super controversial,
 and I don't even want to get into that. And if you do want to kind of a semi-deep dive,
 Earlier this year, I think, yeah, it was started this year.
 I talked a lot about Romans 13, verse 1,
 talks about all authorities being established by God
 and it's all good and no authority exists except for that,
 which God has already created.
 If you want to deep dive into that, send me deep dive.
 If you go to <a href="mailto:ellen@aj.com">ellen@aj.com</a>/stories,
 I did a four part series all about authority,
 part three majors about authority,
 but part one and part two will be really helpful
 for saying that up.
 And the reason I mention that is,
 I found that we are oddities when we talk about the joy with which we've experienced authority
 and our life. Now part of that is we've been under really healthy authority.
 Yeah, we have sought out and stayed under healthy authority. And I think that's
 I think that's what makes the difference because plenty of people have tried to live under authority,
 but really unhealthy authority and it has really unhealthy results.
 Which I thought we could maybe talk about next week.
 Okay. What I thought I'd like to do, talk about this week is talk about our values,
 what we've learned from the word, how we live our life, which is going to raise
 absolutely going to raise questions, objections, observations that I thought maybe we could address
 next week. That was the least life thinking. Sure. Because even as I was pondering this,
 I was thinking, yeah, but people will say, what about this and what about that? And also,
 We've got examples in our lives of not having healthy authority, but still learning good things
 from those seasons. Yes. Which maybe we talk about. Anyway, my point, the larger point is,
 as we've talked over the years about the blessing, the goodness, the benefit of authority in your life,
 we hear some really, really tragic stories, which produces a hesitancy, a suspicion,
 desire to want to have authority, you know, checked or evaluated, I'm not even going to offer the
 counterbalance. I'm not even going to win any of those things. Rather, what I want to do is jump in
 and talk about authority and its goodness. And why is designed by God for our goodness? And you
 can't get further. Can't get further. If we go right back to the beginnings and the basics,
 our very first experience with authority as children would be our parents our parents
 like it's interesting because
 i don't know if this is an honoring way of saying things like i would say that my experience with
 my parents was very different than your experience with your parents growing up question mark sure
 that would be very safe to say but and and what i'm not not trying to say that my parents were perfect
 but I grew up in a safe, stable environment.
 You did not grow up in a safe, stable environment.
 Correct.
 And yet we've both learned the same lessons,
 even though we had very different experience with authority.
 Right.
 And so what lesson would that be that we're talking about?
 Well, it's the whole thing of honor your father and mother
 in the land that you're living so that it can go well with you.
 And you can have a long life. Yeah.
 Yeah, it's a first, it's a fourth commandment,
 but the first commandment with a blessing is that it's to it.
 Yeah.
 And it's fascinating.
 Like if you honor your mother and father,
 like your very first experience with authority,
 if you honor your authority, honor your leaders, God says,
 I will ensure that you will live a long life and that it will go well with you
 in the land that you're living.
 And I think this is probably where we run into problems because
 although authorities create for our good, a lot of us have not had good
 experiences with authority in starting with our parents.
 Right. For sure.
 talk about when the Lord started speaking to you about honoring your mother and father.
 And for those of you who've been listed to our podcast, you know that you grew up in
 an abusive, tumultuous, unsafe environment where for many years you didn't have safe
 parents. And then along comes the Lord at some point in your life, and being like, Hey,
 I'd like you to go deal with that.
 Like, how did you reconcile that verse?
  </li><li>Well, I don't think I was looking at that verse
 necessarily.
 I mean, to begin with, the Lord wasn't talking to me
 about honor, He was talking to me about forgiveness.
 So, you know, when I think about like my story with my dad,
 that whole, did it turn out to honor?
 Yes, I started being able to honor Him,
 but it was through walking out of forgiveness process
 that naturally I wanted then to honor him.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>It makes perfect sense.
  </li><li>I don't think I heard like a message
 on honoring your parents or,
 or I mean, maybe I had heard it,
 but I just hadn't heard it, you know,
 I hadn't listened.
 But I didn't start working on honor
 from the perspective of intentionally going back to honor
 regardless of what my testimony was
 until much later.
  </li><li>Well, so there's a certain story I'm thinking about
 where, and also I think to be clear,
 like I understand what you're saying,
 but forgiveness is honor.
 You know, like you're moving towards that in honor
 with a kingdom.
  </li><li>But what I'm saying is the Lord wasn't saying to me,
 I want you to honor your father.
 He was saying I want you to forgive your father.
  </li><li>But at some point he did, especially with your mom.
 Do you remember, do you know the story I'm blinking to you?
  </li><li>You mean the one where I sat down
 and apologized for things?
 Yeah. Yeah.
 It wasn't that in the context of honor.
 Yes. It was. Yes.
 So painless seeing how old are you and I don't know if you want to go into details.
 Oh, gosh. You know, it was it was after dad had died maybe like a year later, you know,
 and and I just recognized like I don't have a good relationship with my mom and my dad's gone.
 And, you know, I felt like the Lord was saying,
 hey, you get to be a victim or you get to own this.
 Like you get to choose how you walk this out.
  </li><li>Or walk hard because.
  </li><li>Like own the trauma, but also own your end.
 Like you still played a part.
 And so I was like, okay.
  </li><li>But unpack that, 'cause I'm worried that people
 are gonna hear, you know, you played a part in your abuse.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, mostly it was just like,
 After that, I showed my mother like no honor.
 I basically completely cut her out of my life
 and would inform her of things if I felt like it,
 but just never extended honor to her as somebody
 who had invested not only bringing me into the world,
 but you know, as best she could parenting, right?
  </li><li>And so how old are you at this point?
  </li><li>I'm probably about 20, 21, something like that.
  </li><li>For anyone of years, right?
 And the Lord, and not to be your advocate here,
 but you have a lot of cases you can make
 against your mom at this point.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>But the Lord's not talking to you about that.
 The Lord's talking to you about, hey, honey.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Can I put my finger on this thing
 where you have a bad attitude towards your mom?
  </li><li>Yeah, you're super dishonoring towards your mom.
 And I mean, like even, you know,
 like we believed such different things about the Lord,
 like, and so, like even when I go over for family dinners,
 like here I am, I'm in leadership doing all these things
 and I go over and she'd say something about God
 and she is into the occult and stuff like that.
 And I had no grace for her to, for anything,
 like for her to say anything about anything.
 So I would just sort of be like,
 we disagree, let's just move on.
 I couldn't say stuff nicely.
 And so yeah, the Lord started sort of saying,
 hey, you're actually not honoring your mom.
 Okay, so you go over, and this is you making your first efforts
 proactive, let me pause before you tell the story.
 What would your buddy hear from AJ?
 It's not the only way to extend honor.
 All right, so like to honor means to give value to,
 to create space for, to include,
 to let their words be big in your ears,
 to give them a priority in your life.
 This is just one aspect of that,
 where the Lord's been saying, hey, honey.
  </li><li>Well, he specifically said, I want you to go to your mom
 and apologize for not showing her honor.
 your response initially was. Are you kidding? She stabbed me with a carving fork. Yeah. No,
 my original response was like to run the list of all the ways that in my mind, she had disqualified
 herself from honor. Right. Right. Lord, that verse only applies to nice parents who've done a good
 job. Right. And you're expanding me to honor. She didn't protect me. She actually did, you know,
 less than didn't protect me.
 She made my environment terrifying.
 You know, like I was like, here's, here's my list of reasons why I shouldn't obey your
 command.
 Right.
 And the Lord was like, yep, that's, that's all really true.
 You know, and he's like, but actually.
 You, I'd like you to go over and apologize for not.
 Why did you do with that?
 Because it's so kind of him to disarm that.
 Um, where he doesn't, he doesn't minimize your talking about 30 years ago.
 I don't remember the details of what I did.
 I just remember going, OK, you know what?
 I gave you my life. So totally see that face that face right there.
 That fine. I'll go do it.
 I was like, you know, I said I gave you my life.
 So I'll go do it.
 Alibi and my heart attitude will catch up.
 Yeah. But I went in hopeful and it didn't go that well.
 Tell me about the hopeful.
 Like what was the hopeful?
 You've written a story of how it would go.
 I don't know if I wrote a story, but I was like, hey, God's asked me to do this thing.
 So, you know, if God's asked me to do it, therefore, there's going to be some like miraculous.
 transformation, like, you know, it's going to happen instantly.
 Huge, redemptive hallmark mood-esque scene.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And this is going to be the beginning of a new chapter of a brilliant relationship with
 my mother and it's going to be phenomenal.
 Yes.
 Things like that.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Not so good.
 Yeah.
 Well, you know, I had written out a little list with the Lord of what I felt like he
 was speaking to me about, like where I had started to show dishonor.
 which was certainly when I was a teenager.
 And things had ramped up between me and mom at that point.
 And when I was a child, she wasn't aggressive.
 She was just not available to protect me.
 But when I was a teenager, that's when she started drinking more.
 And we started fighting more and all of that.
 And so I just sat down and was like, you know, I just, I felt like God was speaking to me
 about that I haven't honored you and I wanted to, you know, apologize for not honoring it.
 And I don't even think I got the sentence finished before she was like, "Yeah, you were
 horrible!" and then just was like, "You know, I'm asking the mow the lawn and you didn't
 want to mow the lawn!" and I'm like thinking like, "Oh, yeah, I didn't have an attitude
 about mowing the lawn mostly because I'd have to sit on an oxygen machine afterwards
 because I couldn't breathe because I was allergic to the grass.
 But so I'm like trying to, you know, I'm trying to like hear her.
 And every time I want to say like a defense,
 but you stabbed me with a carving.
 The Lord's like, no, no, no.
 And so I just kind of sat there and so she'd finished saying whatever the offense was,
 you know, mowing the lawn, not doing the laundry fast enough, whatever the thing was.
 And I was like, okay, yeah, I'm sorry for that too.
 I'm sorry, you know, and I, I surely thought we'd get to the end of whatever
 her list was, and then she'd own some of the other events that happened.
 Um, yeah, that didn't happen.
 That was it.
 It was just she, um, she just said, yeah, you were horrible and, you know, and
 how was the car ride home between you and the Lord?
 I was so confused.
 I was like, yeah, that's not how I really thought that was going to go.
 Um, but a couple of weeks later, she phoned and asked if I would come over and I
 came over and, and she did apologize for a bunch of stuff, you know, and, you know,
 that it was some apology with excuses, you know, I behaved this way because of that,
 but it was, uh, it was something, you know, and it was the start of us being able to,
 um, talk to each other again.
 So, but I would say the healing of our relationship has been a slow road.
 Um, but now 30 years later, you guys are in a very different place.
 Very different places that I dare say would never have happened.
 Probably not.
 Had you not laid the foundation.
 Right.
 But it was painful.
 I do want to reiterate to everybody who's listening that what AJ, the story that
 is telling is not a template or we are suggesting you could do immediately.
 This is the lead in the Holy Spirit. You know, you had support around you.
 Yeah, the Lord was really clear about it and I ran it by some of my leaders and...
 We're not saying ignore all your pain and your key.
 Yeah, go apologize to everybody that's hurt you.
 And re-enter unsafe environments. That's not what we're saying.
 We're just illustrating an example from your life of what on our look like.
 And I didn't move back in and I wasn't, I mean her life and my life did reflect very different
 values. So I still didn't let her dictate or, you know, speak into how I was living my life. I just
 was less caustic about our interactions. So.
 I mean, I've told this so many times, babe, but I remember meeting you in 2003. I remember coming
 as a student and I remember you were our speaker and I remember you being radiant. Like, I remember
 you shining as you would tell easily some of the most traumatic and horrific stories I'd ever heard,
 you know, over the course of five days. And I just remember thinking like you're beaming,
 like you're not telling any of these stories as war stories or making yourself the hero of like
 I have stories you've overcome like it was such a grace and a life and a light on you that was so
 magnificent. And I just remember, and again, you were, you know, one of your major stories was
 on forgiveness. And I remember, yes, like this is the radiant life of somebody who's walked in
 forgiveness. But I'm also now thinking, coming back to that promise, like I'll give you long life,
 and it'll go well with you in the land that you're living. I am horrified to think about what your
 life would look like if you hadn't done that work. Like it wouldn't go well for you. Like,
 we've had cause to think over the last year or so and take stock of our life and we have a
 beautiful life that is, you know, I'm so grateful continually from the Lord. And I would attribute
 that a lot to course his graciousness and his kindness, but also a byproduct of living
 righteously. And again, I'm not trying to say like, we are super righteous and we're
 very proud of her. I'm just saying, like, we're very proud of righteousness.
 We're that we've been given and the kindness that the Lord's given and the revelation
 he's given to follow his ways to just live simply that, oh, I just shudder to think what
 that could have looked like.
 Yeah, I don't I don't think I was been thinking about that, but yeah
 One of the curious things like that whole verse and you know
 I'm gonna do a bit of exegetical work here and it's not it's not sound
 I'm doing biblical exegetis from our experience in our observation rather than mining the text so bear in mind with that
 It's so I'm not writing doctrine here. I'm just making a comment on an observation from
 10 plus years of pastoral ministry
 is in our life and in the lives of people that we've pastored,
 usually the areas of our life that are not going well,
 whether that's our sex life, whether that's our finances,
 whether that's our career, whether that's our health.
 Usually that area is an area that if you dig deep,
 you find that there's an area of dishonor towards parents in that area.
 Or dishonor towards authority.
 Right. But let's stay with parents for now,
 Because that whole verse, I'll give you a long life and I'll go well with you in the land that you're living.
 Often things could be going well for us in most lands of our life.
 But in one area, we keep reaping the same destructive pattern.
 Right. Like we can never get ahead, you know, we get financial breakthrough, then we end up back in debt or, you know, just as things are going well for us, we lose our job.
 And it's like, you know, why is everything good for me but my money?
 And usually if you if you just explore, I don't want to say usually, but more often than not,
 If you sit with a person, you find that they have judged or dishonored their parents in that specific area.
 It can even be things like, you know, I was thinking about, um, if you dishonored even the way they eat or they take care of themselves.
 And then later on, that becomes a thing where you're like, I can't ever seem to know, no, no, I was literally just thinking about like, because I remember the Lord talking to me about judging my mom about, you know,
 that she wasn't taking care of herself
 and the way she was eating and everything.
 And then I thought, I don't think I started
 getting any level of breakthrough in terms of
  </li><li>Your own life. - My own life
 until I repented for judging my mom.
 And those judgments were when I was like a lot younger.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, like I remember being in the cottage
 so I had to be like, you know, 12, 13,
 somewhere in there, 13, 14 and just being like,
 what happened used to be like thin and healthy
 and now you don't care, you know?
 And just. - Wow.
 That young and then you condemned yourselves
 to do the very same thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so it wouldn't be going well to you in that area.
  </li><li>Tricky.
  </li><li>Well also, as soon as you become a parent,
 like I don't know who's listening to this,
 who's got kids, you know the experience
 where you have ended up doing, saying or behaving away
 that has caused you to panic because you're like,
 (gasping)
 I've become my father or I've become my mother
 in that moment. - Right, well that's Roman's 12,
 isn't it?
 from his 12 one with the whole like you who judge
 do the same thing. - To damn yourselves
 do the same thing. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Well, but that, you know, judging of course is dishonoring.
 So in that area, like I've dishonored my father
 and now is not going well for me in the land I'm living
 'cause I'm repeating the thing to my children
 that was done to me. - Yes.
  </li><li>So anyway, we're focusing on the negative
 but the flip side is if you purpose in your heart
 to live a life of honor, and I'm talking about your parents
 here, but I think you can extend that to any level
 authority, that when you recognize that leaders, authority
 figures are agents of God for your good, there is a blessing
 that comes with it.
 Yeah. And honor is not the same as obey.
 So there's a definite link, however.
 Well, there is, but I mean, as an adult, I can still honor my mom
 and I do honor her, but I don't live like her.
  </li><li>And I could disobey her as an adult
 and still do that in an honoring way.
  </li><li>Equally you could obey somebody
 with a heart of dishonor.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Well that's fun, isn't it?
 All the things to think about.
  </li><li>All right, what was my, I scribbled some notes down.
 What was my other thought?
 Do you want to say anything else about parents?
  </li><li>I was also thinking, you can still honor your parents
 after they're gone.
 Like I think sometimes we think,
 Oh, well, you know, my dad already died.
 So I can't extend honor now.
 I wish I could, you know, fix that somewhere.
 And I think you can, like I think you can still honor them by both honoring what they taught
 you that was great, working on what you, what they taught you that wasn't great.
 Um, you know what I mean?
 And, and honoring them by actually not continuing that pattern.
 like there's there's a lot you can do that's still extending on or even if
 they've already passed away. Okay, so the next area where we're probably going to
 experience working through learning to honor are with with our boss like with
 our bosses and different jobs growing up and you know what what that looks like.
 I remember I've told a story before I've told the story about working for
 Darth Vader. I remember one of my, I mean, I had lots of bosses
 growing up, but when I graduated university and my first like
 job of my career, I remember the very first day of my job and
 my boss meets me and he shows me in the office. And he, he
 said the words to me, no exaggeration. This is your desk.
 This is my desk. If you put any of your stuff on my desk, I'll
 break your kneecaps. And he didn't think he didn't laugh. He
 literally said that. I was like, that was an odd thing to say. And
 And then I realized, oh, I'm working for megalomaniac psychopath, where he found great to like
 he ruled with anger, he ruled with rage, he was wicked smart, he would cut you down to
 size.
 His tools of choice were shame and belligerent belittering, he would just dress you down
 in the middle of an open office in front of everybody.
 I mean, he was an ogre of a man.
 And even back then, I knew that, oh, just because your behavior is atrocious doesn't
 give me an excuse to dishonor you.
 Yeah.
 Now, we can maybe talk maybe next week a little bit about the, like, how do you ensure that
 you're actually caring for yourself in the midst?
 How do you manage yourself when you can't manage a boss?
 Like, you know, is going to HR dishonoring?
 I'm not even going to talk about that right now.
 All I remember thinking, there were very legitimate reasons that I could critique this
 monster.
 And yet I wasn't being asked by the Lord to critique this monster.
 I was just asked by the Lord to honor this person because I remember the Lord teaching me like, you know, God honors the position, not just the person.
 Yeah.
 So this person is clearly disqualifying himself by his behavior, but his position is still to be honored.
 Mm-hmm.
 And I was like, oh, and I remember reading Romans 13 verse 4 that this monster, this Darth Vader figure, is an agent of God for my good?
 like, God, how can you possibly bring good from this fearsome, loathsome ogre? And I remember,
 so I've told this so many times, but I remember a couple of months before I ever got that job,
 my dear friends, Glenn and Anna, sat down, tried to do a confrontation with me. And they were basically
 just saying, "Hey, we've been your friends for a long time. Here's some character traits in you
 that you might not be aware, but they're really abrasive, really aggressive, and they're not
 not fun to be around and I did whatever good Christian does.
 We were like, oh, thank you so much.
 I'll go pray about that.
 Meanwhile, thinking, who are you guys?
 Like, you don't even know anything.
 Oh my God, you guys are just so whiny and just suck it up.
 And you know, I did go and pray about it,
 but my prayer was literally Lord, just, you know,
 give Glenn an honest softer heart
 because they're so judgmental.
 Think nothing of it.
 Think I'm totally justified.
 Think I'm totally right.
 And then I go work for this monster.
 And it takes me about three months
 to realize the good that God wants to bring out of me
 working with this man is this man is a mirror
 of how I behave. All the stuff I hate about this man is the very thing that Glenn and I
 were trying to address in my life that I could not see. That's so funny. And I remember years
 later, John Paul Jackson put it this way that God will use the weaknesses of others to refine
 the weaknesses in you. And that's where I got that revelation of like an unhealed boss is
 is one of the greatest gifts for character formation.
 Now, please, again, don't hear,
 if you're in a dangerous life- fatiguing,
 abusive relationship, I am not saying,
 hey, and do that for all that inner good.
  </li><li>Stay in it, yeah.
  </li><li>No, even at that stage of my life,
 I was a very robust person.
 I had a great support network around me.
 I only ever worked for that guy for like nine or 10 months
 before I actually switched careers,
 but my point in that was God was redeeming
 something God, the kindness of God was bringing this rough pumice stone against the soul of my life
 to bring about, to begin bringing about a measure of brokenness and humility in my life
 that I hitherto didn't think I needed or couldn't even see the issue. And I went on from there,
 even when I switched careers to work for other bosses that were nowhere near as bad as that person,
 But because I'd learned to thrive under a Darth Vader, I could live under a Darth Maul or a,
 you know, insert any other. This is all for you, but these are stalwarts.
 Well, thanks, darling. I feel a little bit of distress that you've got your bad characters out
 of order. Just, I mean, they're in order for when the movies were released, but not for the actual
 timeline. But I mean, I can do it. I can go with you. Yeah. I was, I was thinking, I don't
 did you have something else? No, I was going to, I was going to try and correct my chronology
 and then realized I can't.
 Where does Jabbalah hot fit?
 And then, you know, George Lucas re-released in Jabbalah hot appeared in episode four way
 before you ever saw him in episode six.
 But we can't really go with that.
 I was thinking, you know, we talked either last week or the week before about favor.
 And I was thinking there's such a, there's such a linking as well between honor and favor.
 Like, when I worked for National Car Rental, when I, you know, I got the job because of
 of favor. But the person that I was working underneath everybody at head office was terrified
 of this guy. You know, and so, I mean, I had people tell me like, he'll just fire you
 on the spot. Like, you know, I mean, people were afraid of him.
 Just the kind of guy that you were working for was not the guy who hired you. Right.
 No, it was his VP. Wait, wait, wait, who's so I got hired by the VP and the president
 Yes. Of the company. The president was the one that kept coming and sitting at my table,
 trying to get me to work there. And then I get hired in the interview is with the president,
 but also with Vince, who's this VP operations. Different VP guy who was in the restaurant.
 Is that right? Yeah. Okay. So and Vince, everybody's terrified of, like just terrified of.
 And I remember just thinking, I'm not going to let everybody else's opinion sway me. I actually
 thought he seemed like a decent guy when I had the interview and
 benefits have been raised by terrifying parents.
 Well, you know, he seems quite nice.
 He doesn't scare me.
 But yeah, so he I thought, you know, okay, well, I guess on one level, I was like,
 both the last two jobs I had said, if you ever want to come back, you know,
 so I was like, I'm highly employable, you know, I'll just, you know, see what happens.
 But I realized really quickly that I couldn't listen to what everybody else's opinion was of him
 and still work for him and keep a good heart. So, so like...
 I couldn't listen to what everybody else was saying and live a life of honor with him.
 Right.
 Wow.
 And I think it's that honor that gave me the favor because it was Vince that opened every single one
 of those doors and just I kept getting promoted, promoted. And everybody was like, "You're like
 Vince's golden child, you know, and you, you know,
 and how do you have this relationship with Vince?
 Like Vince doesn't like people.
  </li><li>How did you have that relationship with Vince?
  </li><li>You know what?
 I think it was all favor.
 I think it was the Lord.
 And I think like, I remember when I started,
 I was sort of like, again,
 'cause the first day somebody said,
 you know, Vince could fire you today, you know, blah, blah.
 And I thought I'm highly employable.
 And I feel like God gave me this job.
 And if God wants to take it away, he can have it, you know.
 So that was peace, but not bravado.
  </li><li>Yeah, just like--
  </li><li>I was like, well, screw him, I'm a highlighter.
 You know, you're just like, okay, well--
  </li><li>Yeah, it's gonna be all right.
 And I remember I'd only been there a few days,
 and I was working in the first apartment that I--
 And it's all men, like I'm working with all men.
 Most of them are pretty impressed with themselves,
 or at least that's how they came across.
 And so I'm, you know, training to run this department.
 And I remember Andre comes in and he says,
 Hey, Vince wants to see you in his office.
 And I was like, why?
 Like, did I do something?
 'Cause I was running the fleet for the whole city
 at that point.
 And he's like, I don't know, AJ,
 but he's like, I've really enjoyed working with you.
 I'm like, are you joking?
 And he's like, no, I have.
 I've really enjoyed, you know.
 And I was like, Andre, you think I'm gonna get fired?
 He goes, I don't know why else you get called to his office.
 And I'm like, are you serious?
 And he's like, yeah.
 You know?
 like, okay, all right, fine.
 You know, so go to Vince's office, knock on the door.
 He doesn't even look up.
 He's just on his computer, he goes, have a seat.
 Just looking at his computer typing, whatever.
 So I like sit down, I think, oh, maybe I am getting fired.
 And literally, as soon as I sit down,
 he looks up at me for like a split second
 and says, shut the door, and then he keeps going.
  </li><li>He wants the same people's schools, college as my boss.
 He used to work for customs and immigration.
 He was one of the people that did all the interviewing.
  </li><li>Okay, okay, got it.
  </li><li>So anyway, so I go over, shut the door,
 I sit back down, he just closes his laptop
 and he stares at me, probably, well, it felt like forever,
 but it was probably a good 10 or 15 seconds, you know,
 where he just stared at me and didn't say anything.
 And I'm like, you know, and then he said,
 people wanna know why you're so happy.
 So I just went, is that why I'm here?
 You know, like, 'cause I just,
 it would sort of broke the tension for me, not for him.
  </li><li>Yeah, of course.
  </li><li>You know, and I was like, I mean,
 that's really why I'm here.
 And he goes, yeah, people wanna know why you're so happy.
 And I said, well, do you want me to tell you
 the real answer to that?
 Or like the PC version of that?
 And he's like, well, I wanna know the real answer.
 And I was like, I love God, God loves me.
 And I just, you know, just talk to him about,
 'cause our building was shared the grass with the church.
  </li><li>So you look at your office window and there's--
  </li><li>And there's the church, you know?
 And I said, I go to that church over there
 and I said, you know, I'm happy 'cause I love life
 and I am loved and I love God.
 And he just stared at me, like didn't say anything for a bit.
 And he's like, I have some questions for you.
 Anyway, we ended up having this whole discussion.
 It turns out his sister or his brother
 had gotten saved, they were originally Hindu and you know,
 had left this great job.
 I think it was a sister had left this great job and started an orphanage in
 India. And do I know why she would do that?
 And I'm like, I, I, I do know why, you know, so we started talking,
 we talked for like an hour just about the Lord and about why I was happy.
 And then he just all of a sudden went, all right, we're done.
 And he just went back to like, you know, and I was like, okay, that was random.
 So when I came back, Andrea was like,
 "Do you still work for me?"
 And I was like, "Yeah, I do."
 And he's like, "Oh, thank God."
 Okay, well, you know.
  </li><li>He just wants to know why I smile so much.
  </li><li>Yeah, he just wants to know why I smile so much.
 So anyway, but I just remember like,
 you know, I worked there for four and a half years
 and there was lots of opportunity
 with all different bosses to listen to the awesome,
 office gossip, like the things that people would say
 about other people, but I thought,
 I can never actually take people at face value
 if I'm listening to that kind of stuff.
 So I just sort of determined I wouldn't be part,
 I would just like pick up,
 not be like, I can't be near you.
 I just pick up my stuff and go someplace else, you know?
 But it helped me.
  </li><li>What advice encouragement would you give to people
 who understand that, okay, like at least at a basic level?
 All right, I can read the Bible and I can see
 that no authority exists except that which God's put there
 for me. So therefore I understand that my boss, whether I like him or her or not, God has put me
 in relationship with this boss. This boss is an agent for my job.
 Or I applied for that job and that's just part of it.
 And I don't see how it's good. Like, how do you live in? What feedback? What advice would you give
 people? What feedback? I mean, I prayed a lot like for everybody that I worked for. And I mean, I
 remember one of the VPs there was extremely difficult, you know, and for four and a half years, I
 did not enjoy this particular person.
 But I just would pray like,
 okay, Lord, would you help me have a good attitude?
 Would you also--
  </li><li>I don't have to enjoy them, but I do have to honor them.
  </li><li>And would you also just protect me from any wagging tongues?
 Do you know what I mean?
 Would you, I'm gonna not be part of gossip.
 Would you keep me from it?
 Would you--
  </li><li>The thing is gossip seems like a great remedy
 to the diss.
 the the un-piece that you're living with.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I'm listening to you talk about that VP.
  </li><li>And you kind of want to like complain with other people.
  </li><li>Right, and he's got all the power
 and it feels like this super powerful thing to do.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It can all gossip about it,
 but it's actually the trade craft of the devil.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like gossip, slander, you know,
 it is the currency of hell.
 And it's so, you know, tempting.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I probably talks about gossip going down like tasty morsels.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you actually, it undoes everything
 that heaven's trying to achieve.
  </li><li>And I think particularly if you're like the only Christian
 there or one of the only Christians there,
 participating in it becomes very confusing
 for everybody who's around you, you know,
 'cause then it's almost like you're putting your stamp
 of approval on, you know, so it's not like I didn't go
 and talk to my pastors or my friends, you know,
 when I was having a hard time.
 I mean, never really with Vince, we got along great,
 but with a couple of other of the VPs
 and a director that I had at one point,
 who was like just really slimy,
 kind of just like weird sexual stuff.
 Like I would go and talk and say, "I need wisdom, I need help."
 And I'd get them to pray with me and whatever,
 but I was still, when I was there,
 I was like, "All right, show me how to honor him."
 Okay, show me how to honor this VP,
 show me how to, you know, and then also used wisdom and boundaries and, and all that kind of stuff, but
 I remember John on it saying this brilliant line, which I'm having to look up. He said this.
 And this classic John, you know, we're probably eating Swiss chalet. And there's just this throw away
 comment that's just dripping with wisdom. He said, if you haven't learned to live under authority
 now, how will you serve a king for eternity?
 I was like,
 I said, great, great question.
 Right.
 Cause I think really like it is easier in quotation marks,
 or we think it will be easier to not live under authority.
 Well, it's just my own person and whatever.
 Mine said, but, but you know, we think that will be easier.
 And so you think of comments like that,
 like, well, if you can't live under a 30,
 how are you going to serve a king for eternity?
 Good, great.
 But also it seems to me that every time
 when things go badly,
 who we turn to are those in authority to help us.
 And if we've lived under authority,
 that works really well.
 But if we've actually lived stepping out from under authority
 and then things go badly,
 and then we're turning back and saying,
 Hey, could you help me with this thing over here?
 I don't know what to do.
 It's like, sometimes I kind of want to go,
 oh, I wish, I wish you would have listened six months ago,
 a year ago, whatever, when,
 or you would have sought advice then
 as opposed to doing your own thing.
 And then now you have the results of that.
 I can help you try and walk that through,
 but it probably would have turned out much differently
 if you'd chosen to stay with authority operating.
  </li><li>Well, into that in a moment.
 That dynamic will come to a moment.
 Where I want to sit with is like,
 if we're talking about the goodness,
 the blessing of walking with authority.
 Like I would say again, when we talk about like
 the beauty of being with healthy authority,
 I think about our relationship with John and Carol.
 I think about our relationship with Jeff and Beck.
 I think about the kindness and the latitude
 that I feel like all that has ever come about
 from me honoring and submitting to leadership is promotion
 and in turn authority.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Now here's the tricky thing.
 If you only live to honor authority
 so you can have authority,
  </li><li>It's not that way.
  </li><li>You're undermining why you're living
 with a hard attitude of honor.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I know that sounds ridiculously simple,
 but as we have purposed in our heart
 to help build John and Carol's kingdom,
 purpose in our heart to help build Jeff and Becky's kingdom.
 When we have done that,
 that is probably when I've seen the most amount of growth
 in us, the most amount of advancement sounds wrong,
 it sounds like the weird phrase, but acceleration perhaps.
 And with that, authority, like kingdom authority.
  </li><li>But also, I think the most amount of fruit
 in our own ministry or from our lives.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
 I think is all a result of choosing honor.
 Of choosing to build their kingdom instead of build ours.
 And choosing to stand or throw it in and choosing to let their words be big in our ears.
 Yeah.
 Paying close attention to halt and paying close attention to go.
 Which we can talk about this next week, which is sometimes hard when it is not on your viewpoint.
 Like I've told this story before about John.
 I mean, my introduction to working with John, like, I think and probably lead
 very differently than the way both John and Jeff think and lead.
 Yes.
 Right.
 I think that's fair to say.
 I mean, there's, there's, I mean, Venn diagrams.
 There's a lot of overlap, but also there's some distinct differences.
 But I've noticed in the areas where I've chosen their way, like ridiculous fruit
 comes from it.
 And you're just like, okay.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Yeah.
 I pay attention to that.
 Well, when I come back to the bit that you were talking about,
 And to do that, I'm going to have to look at my scribbles.
 Here's this verse.
 Again, this could be a triggering verse for a lot of people, but it's not the Bible.
 So all I'm doing is reading out the Bible.
 Yeah, he's only reading the Bible.
 And we can talk about why it might not be helpful or why I'm glossing over parts.
 You know, next week.
 And anyway, that before I get to that verse, that whole thing that John said,
 if you haven't learned to serve an, you know, an earthly master, how will you serve
 a king for all eternity?
 He said better than that.
 But basically, if you want to have authority in the future, you have to submit
 to the authority in your present.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like you can only have as much authorities
 you choose to submit to.
 And even then, if you're choosing to submit to authorities
 you can have authority, you've undermined.
 And you've gone back to square one.
 You haven't collected $200.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Do no pass go.
 Here's this verse that touched on what you were talking about.
 Hebrews 13 verse 17, it says this,
 "Obey your leaders and submit to them,
 for they keep watch over your souls
 as those who will give an account.
 Let them do this with joy and not with grief,
 for this would be unprofitable for you.
 The key phrase in that verse is let them.
 Which tells us that we have a say in who's leading us.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Right? - Yeah.
  </li><li>Hold that in tension,
 'cause for some people that's a get out jail free card.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And what I mean by that is some people think,
 "Well, you know what, I don't like what you're doing,
 "so you're not gonna be my leader anymore,
 "and that's my right, and it is your right,
 "but what you'll usually find is
 when you go to your next leader, the same issue that you didn't want to deal with is waiting for you.
 Right. Because your issues are not geography. It's what God's doing in your heart in that season.
 So the key word is let your leaders watch over your souls. And the way you let your leaders watch
 over you with joy and not with grief is by you obeying them and submitting to them.
 Yeah.
 You with me so far? Yes. Yeah. To not obey them, to not submit to them, it says in scriptures,
 "We'll be unprofitable to you," which by extension means that when you do do those things, it will
 be profitable to you. So it comes back to what we've been just saying. We've all got one point,
 we're just saying over and over again, is that as we reflect on our life, in the seasons of our life,
 in the as we look at the correlation between man, things are flying for us in life. And what else
 has gone on our life, the parallel between honor and submitting and promotion, acceleration, etc.
 Go hand in hand. Yeah. But also, I think it's worth noting like you don't really know if you're
 honoring something if they're agreeing with everything that you want to do anyway, right?
 So it's an important thing. It's trickier when, for example, like I remember, this is just an
 example that's coming to my head when I wanted to start year two. You know, I wanted to pioneer
 year two and get it up and going and went to Jeff. I've got a plan, Jeff. You know, this
 is what we do, blah, blah. And Jeff said, as I look at your life and the age of your kids
 and everything else that you're doing, no, I don't want you to do that this year. But
 But Jeff, I've thought this through.
 I have a plan, Jeff, you know?
 And he was like, I don't think that happens this year.
 And at that point, I could probably try and convince him
 and he might have even gone with me
 or I can honor, okay, I say that you are somebody
 who has authority in my life, you do.
 And so I hear you say, this isn't the year.
 But that's sort of like a really,
 maybe that's not a really strenuous example
 for other people, but I had it, you know,
 when a shaper has a plan.
  </li><li>Oh, watch out.
  </li><li>When a shaper has a plan.
 So honor is about not just about when everything
 they've asked you to do, you agree with already,
 and yay, I'm honoring your wishes by living my own dream,
 you know, but honor kind of hits the road when a leader is like,
 I don't think that choice that you're making is wisdom.
 Or I don't think that that person
 that you're choosing is wisdom.
 Or I don't think that, you know,
 that's when you actually have to assess like,
 "Ah, am I gonna honor?"
  </li><li>You're not really honoring or submitting to your leader
 if they're going the direction you were planning on going
 anyway. - Right.
  </li><li>Where you work out whether you're submitting
 an honor to your leader is when they take a hard laugh
 and you're like, "Yeah, but I think we should be
 going straight ahead."
  </li><li>Right. - Right?
 And that's where the rubber hits the road,
 like, now what are you going to do?
 Right.
 That is where you work out like where your heart of honor is.
 The whole thing about like what would be profitable to you.
 Again, it's that I think the example you just gave was beautiful.
 Like I've loved my whole life.
 No, my whole life.
 I've loved the last 20 years of our life.
 We've been number two.
 So what I mean by that is like not the primary leader.
 Right.
 Like I love that there's somebody above me.
 Yeah.
 Making the judgment calls.
 Perfectly happy.
 But think about the grace on that.
 Think about left your own devices.
 You would have just, yeah, let's start a year two
 and let's, you know, you had somebody watching over your soul
 who has to give an account.
 And in that moment, thankfully you let him do it, you know,
 with joy and it's profitable to you.
 And he's saying, "Nah, when I look at your life
 and stage your life and stage your kids,
 I don't know how to be wisdom."
 Like what kindness?
 And I can think of a number of times
 where it's so beautiful to send problems up.
 Like, "Hey, John, hey, Jeff.
 We're facing this situation we don't want to do what's your wisdom.
 And then the Lord answers you through them.
 The Lord's well able to answer you direct.
 The Lord loves to speak through the leaders in your life.
 And that's because authority is agents of good, agents of God for good in your life.
 Yeah.
 I was also thinking like with John, with Jeff, with safe leaders, those are, you're,
 you're also talking about people who have authority over them.
 So they, there's people that have authority to speak into Jeff and Becky.
 There's people that have authority to speak into John and Carol, you know,
 and they go seeking out other people to be accountable to and to have
 speaking into their lives as well, which is part of what also makes them safe.
 So that was just my, my other, my side thought.
 All right.
 Well, that, that kick starts our thoughts on authority and leadership
 and blessing and favor.
 I will throw this out here.
 I realize that a lot of the conversations I've overheard about like,
 why authorities bad are rarely about the practical.
 They're more about the theoretical.
 Like, I wonder if when people saw the topic for this, they thought I was going
 to be talking about government, right?
 Honor the president and honor your leaders and which, by the way, I certainly
 believe is biblical.
 Not what I'm talking about today, right.
 But most of the conversations I've had about authority with people who are like,
 well, I don't think we should be, you know, like I'm a free person.
 and don't you know, America, freedom, yeah, you know,
 is all about like larger things rather than the day to day
 of honoring your parents, honoring your boss.
 In marriage, honoring one another.
 Again, I think probably one of the major contributors
 to the fruitfulness of our marriage
 is that we honor the authority of both of us.
 Like we don't live with the thing that I am the head
 of the family and you just obey me.
 We realize that we are co-leaders of our family
 and we submit to it.
 What are you just grinning at?
 I'm grinning because you said contributors instead of contributors.
 I just, I just like.
 Which way is American?
 I don't, which way is American contributors?
 Oh, you wouldn't know.
 He wouldn't know.
 So you were laughing at my.
 I just was enjoying.
 I was pronunciation.
 Yes.
 I would.
 And fastest on the wrong syllable.
 I just like it when you say words a little differently.
 It makes me like I'm bummed because I thought you were not even special.
 Sexy thoughts about me and it wasn't.
 Oh, I was.
 Oh, you were.
 I tell you I was.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 All right, well, there you go.
 There's our thoughts on that.
 We'll pick up some other thoughts later.
 I'm, because we, by the time you hear this,
 we'll have already recorded the follow up for it,
 which doesn't make asking questions very easy.
 So probably what we'll do is put something on social media
 and say, "Hey, what are some questions about, you know,
 walking with a 13, walking with a leader?"
  </li><li>Yeah, that sounds good.
  </li><li>But where can people get show notes?
  </li><li>You can get the show notes by going to
 Alan and AJ.com/250.
 And if people do have questions, which we'd love to hear, how would people ask us a question?
 Alan and AJ.com/ask.
 And if people were thinking, "I love this episode," but if one of those was a way I could see what they were wearing,
 and bask in the glory of Alan's watermelon shirt, and perhaps look at the snazzy necklace that AJ is wearing with her wooden paddle earrings,
 like, how could you fulfill that wish for them?
 They could sign up to be a member.
 And where would they go to do that?
 Um, they would go to Allen and AJ.com/signup.
 No, slash joy.
 I was doing so well.
 Yeah, you were, you're, you're not the part.
 If you want to become a member, if you want to get access to our video content,
 uh, all of our episodes are filmed in our studio.
 And then we rip out the audio, which is probably what you're listening to.
 Uh, it's, it's another dimension of the podcast.
 It, we also offer our members discounts on our books and on our teaching courses.
 And also, if you do have questions in your member,
 you get to the front of the queue as well.
 You can learn all about the perks of becoming a member
 and supporting the show by going to alanandagia.com/join.
 But for now, we are praying that you
 have a great fruitful relationship with the leaders
 in your life.
 And just have an amazing week.
 Please stay safe out there.
 And we will be back same time, same place, next week.
