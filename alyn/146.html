<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 A.J Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 You spent the afternoon in the garden.
 I did.<br/>
 How was that?<br/>
 It was fun and almost cathartic while I was doing it.
 But you had three children who wanted to quote unquote help.
 Help.<br/>
 And that wasn't as helpful as one might imagine.
 So they were sweet.<br/>
 Tell the internet what you're doing.<br/>
 I have three raised garden boxes that are like four by eight and they're absolutely
 filled with weeds and<br/>
 I want to plant vegetables with the kids. So
 I'm in the process. I need to weed them and then I have to get topsoil or whatever. I
 Don't know what I'm gonna have to research everything details. Yeah, you know, and then I'm gonna plant stuff
 Do you know what you're planting?<br/>
 I have to research that too.<br/>
 I want to plant tomatoes and cucumbers and onions.
 I think you plant onions.<br/>
 I want to plant stuff that we eat a lot of.
 Chocolate, marshmallows, tacos.<br/>
 Watermelons.<br/>
 We don't eat a lot of watermelon.<br/>
 The kids love watermelon.<br/>
 We don't eat a lot of it because I don't bother to buy it very often.
 but if I could somehow grow those baby watermelons, they would be stoked.
 -There's such a thing as a baby watermelon? -Yeah, those little tiny ones.
 -Never seen them. -Yeah, like through the size of a football.
 -And they're a watermelon? -Yeah.<br/>
 -Let's see this, guys. -Let's see this, guys.
 About the size of a cantaloupe, slightly bigger, but it's a watermelon.
 -I think you're making that up. I need photographic evidence.
 -Allen Jones, you have cut them up for me before.
 Can you please start using your memory for something useful?
 -No clue what you're talking about. -Oh, my gosh.
 Okay. Yeah. All right.<br/>
 From gardening to this week, what happened this week?
 It was a great week. The students came back from outreach.
 Oh, it's so good to see everybody.<br/>
 Oh, it's so good. Yeah, for sure. I missed them when they're gone.
 Our auditorium was filled with very excited people who hadn't seen each other in three weeks.
 And had amazing testimonies of all this crazy stuff that they'd seen.
 Incredible test weeks when we get to the second.
 Yeah, yeah. So that was really fun.<br/>
 And then we also had a team from the Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry.
 in town so they came to minister to us.
 It seemed really fitting that we had just sent students around the world and churches
 around the world had received our students to give them an opportunity to minister.
 So it was nice to be on the other end of that.
 A team from Bethel came and minister to our staff in the morning.
 They did prophetic ministry for all of our staff and then they have to administer it
 at the school.<br/>
 And then evening they ministered to Emily.
 Super encouraged by their visit.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah. - But lovely, lovely people.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Those guys can minister
 at the end of emanate when they just said,
 okay, if anybody who wants a prophetic word
 can have a prophetic word.
 And so just to line up for people,
 the profs I over, I was like, oh, you guys are fantastic.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's great, yeah.
  </li><li>The highlight of my week.
  </li><li>What was the highlight of your week?
  </li><li>Oh, I know what the highlight of your week was.
  </li><li>We got our taxes done.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, we got them, we met with the tax guy,
 but you're the one who all week long got everything together.
 We have an amazing accountant.
  </li><li>Yes, unbelievable.
  </li><li>A godsend of an accountant.
 Actually, it's funny that we're talking about
 this topic this week because he's somebody
 who falls into that category.
 So we're with him, we have their tax appointment on Friday.
 And in the middle of the appointment, I just said,
 "Steve, I'm so grateful for you."
 And he's like, "Well, my gift is,
 "I'm just not intimidated by forms
 "as he's waiting through tons of returns."
 And he knows what he's doing.
 It just brings me so much peace.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's great.
  </li><li>Because I don't have a clue what I'm doing.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Yep, so that was really good.
 And now it's done and you don't have to think about it.
  </li><li>Well, I do though because every year that I do them,
 I kick myself thinking,
 "You should have had a better system in place."
 And so I'm convinced that this year
 I'm gonna put in place a better system than we have,
 which is do nothing and then spend two weeks
 scrambling and copying.
 I mean, it's not that I do nothing.
 We have digitized copies of every receipt,
 but it's collating them and going through them
 and finding this form and that form.
 And I'm thinking, "No, there's no reason.
 I can't, there's no reason I can't apply some shape or genius to this.
 Yes.
 And make it work better.
 Yes.
 And then Saturday, we had a super social Saturday and it was amazing.
 It was so fun.
 They did a staff honor lunch for us at the school.
 So the students put on.
 I think technically it was a brunch not to split hairs.
 All right.
 Well, you are splitting hairs.
 And that was a gift.
 Okay.
 Uh, yes, it was a brunch.
 And I have never had the wonder that is avocado wrapped perchito.
 That's like paleo crack.
 Those things were amazing.
 They're just like, oh, so first of all,
 we have a building called the Firehouse at Greyser.
 I'm not quite sure why it's called the Firehouse.
 It might be because we should light it on fire.
 The ceiling's falling anyway, it doesn't matter.
 Anyway, it's a free-standing corrugated steel building.
 There's nothing attractive about it from the outside or the inn.
 And yet these students had transformed it into Wonderland.
 I've never seen it look like that,
 or even imagined that that was possible.
  </li><li>They'd themed it with the four seasons,
 each season in a different corner,
 and all the table pieces matched that,
 and then they had a giant center table
 where refreshments were served.
 And it was amazing.
 It was stunning.
 And so our students decided to honor
 all of our small group leaders and our pastors
 and our staff at the school,
 and did a phenomenal job.
 So we went away feeling like kings and queens.
  </li><li>Yes, and full and well-fed.
 All the food was paleo and it was so good.
 That was ridiculous.
 I don't know what they did to the bacon, but it was fan bacon testic.
 It was unbelievable.
 Yeah, it was good.
 Amazing.
 And then in the evening, we went to a wedding.
 Yeah, our friends, Brandon, Albert got married in a beautiful, beautiful
 location. Yeah.
 And we got to enjoy being with friends.
 It was stunning.
 There's this incredible tree.
 I don't know what kind of tree it was.
 Nobody could tell me.
 Alan started making up tree names.
 And then I asked Jeff and he started making up tree names.
 That didn't help me at all.
  </li><li>Why would you think I had a Jeff
 or I would know anything about a tree name?
  </li><li>Don't know.
 He's from Tennessee, he might know.
  </li><li>That's like when I go to Scotland,
 do I know all the trees in Scotland?
  </li><li>Wow, no, but you're Alan Jones.
 But it was a beautiful wedding and it was great
 'cause I got to stay back and dance
 and you got to go home.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>Woo hoo.
  </li><li>And then this morning at church, our S.O.C. students
 that we mentioned earlier who came back
 gave a whole report to the church about their outreach.
 And it was amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was fantastic.
  </li><li>Lots of people saved, lots of prophetic ministry everywhere.
  </li><li>Lots of miracles.
  </li><li>We had testimonies of blind eyes opening
 and deaf ears opening and lame walking.
 And it was great.
 We'll put Link in the show notes.
 And if you want to be encouraged,
 listen to our students give testimonies
 about what they saw in the last couple of weeks
 all over the world.
 It was amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 The main topic for this week came from your amazing brain.
 Talk to us about it.
  </li><li>I had the thought of what if we'd spoke about
 playing to our strengths?
 Because most of what we do is actually,
 we do the dance of life as it were, working together
 and having a home together and having a family together
 and all that kind of stuff.
 And we typically play to our strengths.
 And that's how I think our level of busyness
 doesn't drive us crazy because we do that.
  </li><li>All right, so define what you mean
 by play to your strengths.
  </li><li>I mean, like there's things that you're naturally better at
 than I am or there's things that I'm naturally better at
 or are less stressful for me than they are for you
 or whatever.
 And instead of trying to do the same things,
 we tend to sort of divide and conquer.
  </li><li>Right, like I'm better at taking out the trash
 than you are.
  </li><li>You're much better.
  </li><li>Well, God gave me these guns for a reason.
 You know, don't flex those, honey.
 This can be a short podcast.
 Somebody just drove by really slowly and saw us broadcasting.
 We have no blinds on our office windows.
 Yeah.
 So when we broadcast Sunday night, it's fully illuminated.
 I wonder if I wonder what we look like to our neighbors.
 I don't know.
 They must.
 I don't know.
 They care.
 No.
 Anyway, it was funny.
 So you're talking about playing to your strengths is there's things that each one of us can do
 that we just think is normal. It's not taxing for us mentally or otherwise,
 and we can do it with perhaps greater ease in somebody who's not as fluent in that.
 Yes.
 So for example, you are very good at cooking.
 Thanks. Yes.
 I can cook, but it requires intense concentration, no distraction and lots of planning.
 Whereas you can look in the fridge and you're like, "Yeah, yeah." And then 20 minutes later,
 make something that I didn't even know was possible. All the while, while fielding questions
 from the kids, you can do it. There's no stress. It's not stressful. Yeah.
 Right. Whereas how do you feel about configuring our network when there's a problem?
 Oh yeah, I mean, I'm super good at that.
 I mean, no, I'm horrible at that.
 I'm always like, uh, Abbico, find your father.
 Whereas for me, I like the challenge.
 Like what is it?
 Is it the writer?
 Is it the modem?
 Is it the switch?
 Is it what?
 ITP server?
 Look at you, baby.
 Thank you.
 That's not a thing.
 But you're adorable.
<strong>TICTP.</strong>
 Going.
 Never mind.
 Yeah, adorable.
 It could have been either those two things.
 It wasn't working.
 Just wanted to say that.
 So at home, you tend to do more cooking.
 Yeah.
 I tend to do more technical setup.
 Yes.
 I tend to help the kids with homework more.
 Yes.
 What, why is that?
 Well, you're a trained teacher.
 Right.
 Um, I think actually you end up helping with the homework more because usually homework is happening
 between four and five, which is when I'm making food.
 Right.
 Um, babe, they circled background and now they're totally right outside our window.
 That's way.
 That's kind of.
 Do we just freak them out?
 I didn't know.
 Should I take my shirt off?
 Oh, they're parking.
 OK, just look natural.
 The car is.
 Can you read the number play from that?
 No, I can't.
 It's a big suburban thing.
 It's a big suburban thing.
 Call the police.
 So, yeah, I think you do homework because it's happening
 between four and five and I'm usually cooking between four and five.
 But at work, we played to our strengths, too.
 Yeah.
 So whenever we're launching something, we talk about it at length.
 Yeah.
 Usually in the car on the way there on the way back, usually over dinner.
 I mean, usually we're just constantly painting, participating.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And then what happens?
 Then usually I take it and make some sort of a plan.
 93% of shaper.
 Yes, I'm down to 93.
 That's a slacker.
 I know.
 And then I tend to just lock me away in a cupboard and I'll just do.
 Yeah.
 Then yeah, typically I just sort of hand you at here's how I think it's going to work best.
 and then you just check off a list and get all the stuff done and made and why not.
 And I should point out we have an incredible team that fill in all the gaps.
 Oh, absolutely.
 It's not like you plan I do and that's it.
 I just mean in the early stages, this is how we...
 Right.
 And then we have a team of people who are doing quality control, like,
 have you thought about that?
 No, I haven't.
 And what about this?
 And then a whole bunch of people who implement with finesse and skill.
 And I think... I like to think we've been smart enough to always have those people around.
 Right.
 Well, that's a good thing.
 what do you do when we have the same weaknesses, which we do?
 We do. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, we do. We have the same strength and the same weaknesses,
 and typically we outsource for our weaknesses. Right. So at home, for example,
 I am not a green-thumped person at all. No. And I also have terrible allergies. Yes.
 And the thought of me managing, this sounds ridiculous. Admittedly, this sounds like first
 world problems and I'm, I'm, it's the only example I could come up with at this time
 and I is the thought of me having to mow my yard and keep it all trimmed and you know,
 all the bushes and the trees and the weeds and that, that, that causes me significant
 anxiety. The thought of having a, the amount of work that we do then come home and find
 time to do that and be outside the, you know, and it's hot and it's humid and I've got allergies
 and that would not be fun. And that's not what your passion is at all.
 No, I mean, to be honest, I don't think it occurred to either of us when we saw the house and bought it.
 You know, we were like, oh, it's so pretty.
 Look at all of those beautiful flower beds and fancy bushes and trees and this and that and never occurred to me.
 Oh, that's all work.
 Even our old times when all we had was just lawn.
 Yeah.
 The, I think I had a lawnmower and I tried and I was like, I hate this.
 I absolutely.
 I hate this.
 I hate it.
 Yeah.
 It's a simple example, but we outsourced it.
 And having somebody else do something is well worth the money so that I can do something
 else and be more productive and less stressed.
 The same then at work, we've got some considerable weaknesses.
 And so we've hired brilliant people who fill those weaknesses far better.
 But on their worst day, they're better at the things that we suck at on our best day
 at trying hard.
 Yes.
  </li><li>It's important that you don't hear us say
 you never have to work on your character flaws
 or you never have to work on your weaknesses.
  </li><li>No, you absolutely have to work on them
 and bring them up.
  </li><li>But at the same time, you do want to learn
 to learn what your gifts are and stick to your gifts.
  </li><li>Yeah, but also I think part of how you work on a weakness
 is you be around people who, your weakness is their strength
 so that you can actually learn to appreciate that
 and how it works.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So it's almost like hiring for your weaknesses
 is research.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well, it really is.
 The number of staff meetings that we've had
 where my staff will collectively let out a groan
 and I'll be like, wait, what happened?
 And they're like, you can't say that.
 And I'm like, can't say what?
 And I'm legitimately taken aback that the people
 who are closest to me are like, no, Alan,
 that's not an appropriate thing to say.
 So, 'cause at times, I'm fairly socially tone deaf.
 There's genuine parts of human behavior
 that I'm surprised that people either care about and or notice.
 And I am oblivious to those things and less so now
 because I've got years under my belt of my team,
 no, you can't say that.
 And I'm like, oh, okay.
 And so, or just even having people going,
 have you thought about how what you're suggesting
 you implement will affect X, Y and Z?
 And I'm like, to be honest, no.
 And they're like, okay, well, let us help you with that.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So we're better leaders because of brilliant staff
 that work for us.
  </li><li>Yes, absolutely.
 who feel confident enough to call us on our stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And say hey, you're not gonna go ahead.
  </li><li>Hey, half the room isn't gonna get what you just said
 or half the room is gonna respond like this
 if you thought about that.
  </li><li>And they're very patient when I'm like,
 okay, say that again, explain to me like I'm five.
 Like why wouldn't people get that?
 They're like, well.
 And so it's just, it's wonderful.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's really good.
  </li><li>Something practical.
 Have you noticed that you do all the driving
 in our relationship?
  </li><li>I've noticed that.
  </li><li>Why is that?
  </li><li>I like driving.
  </li><li>Yeah, you do.
  </li><li>I mean, I'm pretty particular about driving.
  </li><li>That's a polite way of saying it.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 So I think on one level, it's just a lot better
 for our marriage if I'm driving,
 'cause I have a hard time when other people are driving.
  </li><li>You have a hard time being a passenger.
  </li><li>I do.
  </li><li>And I've noticed that there's people who love driving,
 there's people who don't like driving,
 and then there's people who are indifferent.
 I'm totally indifferent to driving.
 I also have a fairly short attention span,
 So you get anxious because I kind of think like,
 I wonder about that.
 Oh, there we go.
 I came to the place.
  </li><li>Well, we're like 20 minutes into a drive
 and you're like, where are we again?
 What are we doing?
  </li><li>Well, that's the other fact that I'm
 navigationally challenged.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Yes, you are indeed.
  </li><li>We were driving home from church today
 and I asked AJ how to get to the restaurant.
 And bear in mind, this is a restaurant we visit a lot
 and it's near our house.
  </li><li>And nearby we've driven there directly from church
 before as well.
  </li><li>And we've lived here for like eight or nine years.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So Ajis says, well, you just want to stay on Cool Springs and then turn left on Corothers,
 which that information didn't help me because I didn't know I was on Cool Springs.
 I don't know where Corothers was.
 So much to your chagrin I pulled out and said, hey, Siri, navigate me to.
 And she told me exactly what you just told me, but because of the picture I could see
 it.
 And that was one of the rare occasions I was driving.
 You were.
 Are you still looking at the car outside?
 I was curious.
 I think it's gone now.
 So it must have given up.
 Oh, okay.
 Great.
 through it guys.
 No need to call the police.
 Thanks for praying guys.
 We really appreciate it.
 I would say another area of weakness of mine is cleaning.
 I don't like cleaning at all.
 I don't think anybody likes cleaning.
 Well, there's some weirdos.
 No, I know people that really like cleaning.
 They like none of them have kids.
 No, I know people with kids that like cleaning.
 Who are these people and why we know friends with them?
 I know.
 That's the real question.
 And maybe I should get them to come over and lay hands on me.
 I want to give you a great gift.
 It's our messy house.
 Go at it.
 Please come clean my house.
 Yeah, I don't enjoy cleaning.
 We had a different upbringing with regard to that.
 Yes.
 You had a maid.
 Yes, we, well, our governance.
 I mean, we, we, we had a living maid.
 Yeah.
 Well, I mean, she technically, I suppose, was taking care of the children,
 but she kept the house clean.
 And then when we were older, we still had a maid that came
 once or twice a week, I think, whereas I grew up with three sisters.
 And by the time I was an old seven, my mother introduced the concept of duties or chores.
 Yeah.
 And so every, every day, every meal, we were always doing something empty, dishwasher, filling the dishwasher, laying the table, clearing the table.
 So I grew up with all that stuff.
 Although I will admit, when I moved out and went to university, I remember calling my mom and saying, well, the toilets here aren't as clean as the toilets at home.
 And my mom was like, well, that's because I clean the toilets every day.
 I was like, how does one clean the toilet?
  </li><li>Okay, so I did know how to clean bathrooms.
 I learned how to clean bathrooms.
 And there was like,
 I can't remember if there's seven or nine bathrooms
 in the house I grew up in,
 but there was a lot of bathrooms and that was my job.
 But I remember at the cottage,
 we had to unload and load the dishwasher
 and set the table and all that kind of stuff.
 And I always felt like,
 wow, this is like really hard stuff to do.
  </li><li>It basically comes down to this,
 whoever cares most does it.
 So you care more about the food you eat than I do?
  </li><li>Yes, I definitely do.
  </li><li>I care more about our internet connection than you do.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Etcetera, et cetera, et cetera.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Talk about the wedding,
 'cause you had an interesting revelation
 this weekend when we went to the wedding.
  </li><li>Well, we both love weddings.
 I definitely love them more than you do.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's some misconception about me
 and public affairs.
 Generally speaking, most things in life
 move much slower than I'd like them to be.
 So, you know, when I am at a wedding,
 I'm like, okay, move on.
 Okay, let's have this speech, okay, can we have the food?
 So I'm generally quite impatient.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But you love the opportunity to be with everybody.
 Where I'm like, we're both introverted.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I get my energy being on my own
 and I spend my energy being with other people.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I'm the same.
 I'm just slightly more extroverted than you.
  </li><li>Yeah, you love it.
 The thought of dancing at the end of the night
 fills you with energy to keep you going.
  </li><li>I love dancing.
 Yeah, if somebody were to say,
 we're having a wedding, but there's not going to be dancing.
 You'd be sick that day.
 I would be ready to go a lot faster.
 You know, you mean like to head out just because I so love the dancing part.
 But I love watching my friends get married.
 Yes.
 And I love seeing everybody looks super schmancy and fancy.
 And I like when you dress up.
 Yeah, you do.
 Handsome all over me like a rash.
 Yeah.
 I do like the thing they don't make suits that shorts come with because then I would
 be super distracted. Could you be showing off your legs as well as being an acid?
 So you're burdened to bear. Right. But I love, I love seeing, and if we got a great table,
 I love being with people. And of course, I love wedding food because wedding food is amazing.
 Okay, can I tell you something that I saw for the very first time at this wedding?
 Sure.
 They served a pig cut in half and just laid it on a table. And then you like came along
 the buffet line and got all the different fixings and then a guy with rubber gloves on basically reaches into the pig and just puts a handful of meat on your plate.
 That's something you see a lot isn't that's not something you see often at all.
 The point in all of the story is you last at weddings way longer than I do.
 I do I would like wanting to be rude want to leave usually fairly quickly.
 Yes.
 And you want to stay until the last dance.
 Yeah.
 So our typical thing is that we figure out if there's somebody else that I can get a lift home with later that's going to stay for the dancing and then you can leave and have your alone time and your recharge time and I get to stay and dance.
 Now, what's funny about that is I'm not sure how that would work in other marriages.
 I don't know because you're completely content for me to be me and you to be you.
 So there's no pressure for me to have to stay.
 And there's no pressure on you to have to leave.
 So we both get to be, you know, play to our strengths
 without causing conflict.
 Has it always been like that?
 I don't know.
 I mean, I think so.
 We've done it for a long time like that.
 I mean, occasionally I have to head out with you.
 We had a wedding recently where I had to head out at the same time,
 but that was just because we had to record the podcast
 cast and went right. But if there's not something like that where we're under a time crunch,
 then typically I'll stay and you'll head out.
 And you love it. You just love dancing.
 Yeah. I mean, I wish you were there sometimes for like some of the dances, but you know,
 really enjoy it. So if I was dancing, someone called 911 thinking I was having an epileptic
 fit, loving it upright.
 That is not true. But can I just tell you that Johnny and Becky Pinnagrass can cut a
 rug?
 That doesn't surprise me.
 Oh my gosh.
 because we're amazing.
  </li><li>They were so fun to watch.
 Yeah, it was very good.
  </li><li>Did you catch any video?
  </li><li>No, lots of people did shoot video, but I didn't.
  </li><li>So there you go, there's our thoughts.
 Play to your strengths.
 If you're married, sit down with your spouse,
 work out what your strengths are,
 work out what your weaknesses are.
 If you both have the same weaknesses,
 work out how you can outsource that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Maybe that means money, but maybe that means
 you can trade stuff, or maybe it means you go without it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like literally, our house gets tidy
 when we have guests coming over.
 It's true.
 Neither of us like it, but right now we're not in the season
 where we are gonna spend money on a maid.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, we can't spend money on a maid.
 And with the time that we have available,
 we'd rather spend the time on the kids.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so it's like, well, yeah,
 I don't think the kids are gonna think when they wake,
 you know, when they grow up,
 well, our house was really messy.
 I think it's gonna be how much time they got with us.
  </li><li>I would hope.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 could be creating anti-social monsters.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Who never pick up half themselves.
  </li><li>Messy anti-social monsters.
  </li><li>Well, I do wonder if it's stage of life though.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Anyway, I have no idea.
 I would look at my friends who've got teenage kids
 and they're always out of sports.

 She said, "I enjoy this into your podcast.
 You two bring such a down-to-earth perspective to a relationship with Christ.
 Recently, I have really enjoyed Jesse Early's Glory MP3.
 We talked about this last week.
 My question is, can you recommend any other songs or albums that have that same feel and
 presence of God?
 Yes, absolutely.
 We can recommend wholeheartedly Laura Woodley or Laura Woodley Osmond.
 She has a couple of different albums. My favorites are Home and in Love, but I think she also has
 another one on the Supernatural. Then we also listen a lot to Alberto and Kimberly Rivera,
 who have a gazillion soaking type albums. They're soaking savants, load of geniuses.
 We'll put links in the show notes to both of them. This is from CS,
 And he or she says hey guys I feel like I've heard you mention that there is a social ministry where you are.
 I've been scouring the show notes but can't find anything beyond healing rooms and i'm mistaken about the social ministry i'd love to get more info you are not mistaken we do have an inner healing ministry at grace center called revive.
 and it is on the website under revive is not right and they use a bunch of different approaches.
 That you get some really really skilled ministers who are trained in so so who are trained in rtf who are trained in heart sink or
 train a bunch of different things and they'll use whatever the most effective approaches of the whole sprits leading them in to bring people to healing so if you go to grace in his website will be information all about our revive ministry.
 I'll put link to that in the show notes.
 They actually have a free workshop coming up.
 I think it's this Saturday, isn't it?
 I don't know.
 It'll be posted as well on the website, but there's a workshop coming up that's like
 830 to 12.
 It's either this Saturday or next.
 And so those are also great ways to start getting some inner healing is to show up for
 those and they do ministry at those.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 This one's for you, baby.
 Okay.
 This is from Ben.
 He says, "Hi, Alan and Ajay.
 I've really enjoyed your podcast.
 ago and have listened to a few dozen episodes during my commutes to work.
 I'm wondering if you have any good resources that you'd suggest for raising a godly toddler.
 We have an almost 4 year old boy, including both practical advice for raising a toddler,
 as well as ways to introduce him to Jesus without shoving it down his throat.
 I do plan on reading "Love and Your Kids on Purpose", but I have not yet.
 I've read Joe Frost's "Toddler Rules", which was very good, but not based on Jesus
 as far as I know.
 Well, the first book I know of the second I do not.
 AJ Jones, what's your thoughts?
 Yeah, loving your kids on purpose is great.
 Really, really good.
 In terms of toddler resources,
 we used baby-wise in terms of raising our infants,
 but I never went on to using toddler-wise,
 which was their next one mostly just 'cause I didn't really
 like the direction it was heading in.
 So I would say loving your kids on purpose
 probably one of the best resources I've heard of.
 And one of the things that's helped us as Gary Chapman wrote a book called the five
 love languages. I'm sure there's a kids version. I haven't read it. But the reason
 I bring that up is identifying the ways that your kids feel most loved is really super
 important. Yeah. Like MJ, who's our toddler, who's four, he is such rich quality time.
 Yeah. So if I'm not in the same room as him, he will be super comforted if we're just
 in the room together. If he's just on his iPad watching YouTube kids and I'm on my laptop
 working, he feels super good just, you know, being the same room together.
 Yeah. Yeah. Or even if we have to work and he wants to play with his toys, if we'll just
 come up and work playing, you know, sitting in the toy room and he's playing with his
 toys and we're not actually talking to him, but at least he is in the room with us. It's
 just comforting.
 Whereas T is the absolute opposite. Tia does not want to be near you at all. She's highly
 kind of play if she'd like to withdraw, but boy does that girl love gifts.
 She loves her gifts.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So they're all a little bit different and it's kind of fun figuring that out with them.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 I'm sorry we don't have any more resources for you.
 I apologize, Ben.
 We're not experts.
 If we get any sort of recommendations from other listeners on Tardler books, we'll try
 and mention those for you as well.
 All right.
 Let's wrap this episode up.
 All right, well, if you would like the show notes for this episode, head on over to alananaj.com/146.
 (laughs)
 Alan was showing me fingers in the background and it went, they didn't go fast.
 (laughs)
 One, four, six.
 Oh, you won't be afflicted.
 Like I said earlier, if you'd like a shot of faith in the arm,
 I'll put a link in the show notes to watching our SSL students give their reports.
 If that inspires you to come do our school, we start in September, we run through April,
 it is absolutely life transforming. If you have done first year, we'd love you to consider
 coming back and doing second year. We'd love to spend another eight months with you teaching
 you all about leadership. You can find all the information you need about the school at
 graceinner.us/school. Again, a link to that will be in the show notes.
 Applications are due in by June 15th.
 And then lastly, we have the more conference coming up.
 If you head over to graceinner.us/more,
 you'll find out all about the conference speakers
 and our amazing worship leaders
 that are coming from Bethel worship this year.
 Yeah, it's going to be great.
 All right, we pray that you have an incredible week
 and we'll be talking to you this time next week.
