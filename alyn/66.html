<p> Mrs Jones, how are you? I'm good, how are you? I'm amazing. Did you have an incredible week?
 I did have an amazing week. Tell me about your week. Well, let's work backwards. Work backwards
 then. We've just gotten home from our leadership retreat. We should call it leadership advance.
 Yes. Like all the other trendy churches. Yes, I understand. So we take all our leaders away
 this weekend for our school of supernatural life. We have 15 members of staff running the school
 this year. Ten of whom are our small group leaders and nine of those, it's their first
 time ever small group leading at the school. So we take them away and we do a, I guess,
 a four day training bonding, connect time. We'll talk about that in a second. So that
 was about five and a half hours away, was it? Somewhere in the middle of nowhere.
 Jat Unberg. We had a beautiful cabin. We did. It was a really nice cabin.
 Absolutely gorgeous. I didn't mind nature this weekend. That's because she didn't really go outside. Well, they had big bay windows. There was no need.
 And there was air conditioning and Wi-Fi. And so that was that. So we left Thursday. I don't really remember anything else. I spoke on Monday. Oh, yeah, last week, our podcast was about the church.
 Thank you to everybody who gave me feedback on that. Really appreciated the emails and the tweets and the texts.
 If you listened to last week's podcast, it might interest you to know that on Monday night,
 I did kind of a more in-depth teaching on the church. So if you enjoyed last week's podcast,
 you might want to check that out. We'll put a link to it in the show notes. And then tomorrow night
 at M&amp;A, I think I'm going to be teaching a second part on the church, kind of putting the spotlight
 in a different place. Yeah. And then Tuesday and Wednesday, I think we're just our normal
 meetings, connecting, preparing.<br/>
 Yep, lots of meetings.<br/>
 You know what I'm sad about?<br/>
 What is this morning?<br/>
 We weren't in church.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 And I heard it was amazing.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Dr.<br/>
 Brian Simmons, who wrote the passion<br/>
 translation of the Bible.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Was that our church speaking?<br/>
 We're very sad that we missed it.<br/>
 Hurry was amazing.<br/>
 But ask me why I'm not sad.<br/>
 Why aren't you sad?<br/>
 Because he's coming back in October for our
 Heaven declares conference.<br/>
 I knew that.<br/>
 Then you were a wonderful magical assistant.
 Thank you.<br/>
 I'm also not said because I can watch it online.
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 There's that too.<br/>
 We'll put a link to Dr. Simmons message at Grey Center this morning.
 Also in the show notes.<br/>
 Yeah, that'd be good.<br/>
 Any highlights from the weekend that weren't stuff we're going to be talking
 about in a second?<br/>
 Well, the food was fantastic.<br/>
 Really, really good.<br/>
 So that was really nice.<br/>
 Of course, food's usually a highlight for me quite like that.
 How are you enjoying being paleo?
</p><ul>
  <li>I really feel better being paleo.
 I feel much less groggy/grumpy/mystomach doesn't bug me as much.
 You're giving me a look like I'm still grumpy.
 I'm still in pain.
 You have to give me a little bit of grace here.
 They want me to have a surgery on my shoulder.
 There's not for nothing.
  </li><li>That's not for nothing.
 So we're writing the grumpiness after the shoulder pain.
  </li><li>I feel less irritated by my stomach.
  </li><li>Oh, good.
 we went to a somewhat run down, well, we back up. Normally when we go away on our leadership
 training weekend, historically for the last four years, we've always done river tubing.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>If you don't know what that is, I don't blame you because I don't know what it is, but basically
 we drive somewhere and there's this place that rents out large inflatable rings.
  </li><li>Tubes. Yeah.
 tubes. Yeah. Well, there are more rings that you sit in and then you just flow down a river,
 and that's what we do for amusement. And it takes a couple hours and you just hang out, talk.
 And it's surprisingly fun. Yes. I mean, initially, there's the shock that it's freezing cold.
 Yeah, but you get over that pretty quick. And occasionally there's lots of rocks.
 Yes, or fish. Or fish. The fish don't bother me. But this year, the water was so low that they
 they said it would take how many hours to go down.
 They said it would take three hours
 and that we would be hitting our butts on lots of sharp rocks
 and things like that.
 So we're having to walk for large portions of the river.
 So while I sounded incredibly appealing,
 we hope that for something different
 and went to a somewhat rundown.
 Theme park, would you call it theme park?
 I think it is actually set up for skiing in the winter.
 And they're trying to think of something else
 to do with it in the summer.
 And so somebody got the bright idea in the 70s or something
 to make a couple of rides there for the summer.
  </li><li>Right.
 The best ride.
  </li><li>They're still the same as they were 40 years ago.
  </li><li>Granted.
 And it was a flashback to my childhood.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's the only way I could describe it.
 I was like, okay, 10 year old Alan is in trauma
 because this is a lot of what my summer vacations were like.
 The good part was they had chair lifts.
 They did. That was the most bestest part of the park.
 I tell you what, like I get why people like mountaineering.
 Pardon? Well, I get why people like mountaineering.
 I do tell.
 It's kind of fun to be at the top of a mountain.
 Yeah.
 I just like sitting and being ascended to the top of the mountain.
 Yes. The good thing that you do, because somewhere in between the bottom and the
 mountain and the top of the mountain, there was five black bears.
 Right. And I enjoyed the sitting and being carried up by some scary cables.
 Yes, but we made it.
 It occasionally stopped.
 And we got to make out on the way up and on the way down and on the top.
 We do.
 We have photographic proof.
 That was fantastic.
 And then they had, I don't know how you described this.
 It was kind of like a miniature bobsled run without the bobsled or the ice.
 It's like a predetermined pattern down the side of the mountain.
 It's like a stone curved course.
 Right.
 And then you sit in a kind of slash cart slash skateboard slash Bob sled slide thing.
 Yes.
 And then you have a handle in the middle that apparently goes faster, goes normal and breaks,
 but we couldn't really get it to go fast.
 No, it didn't go fast enough for me.
 Yeah, you're the daredevil in the family.
 Yeah.
 But we if you if you can't wait to be entertained by video of going up a mountain down a mountain,
 we put that on Instagram for you as well. Yes. It was a banner social media weekend.
 And actually the guy on the slide stopped you because you were filming and it was very naughty.
 I know and I could have been reckless. What was the speed of at least 15 miles an hour going down
 a hill? Shocking behavior. He didn't stop me however. Well you weren't filming that's why I was.
 I filmed all the way from the top to the bottom.
 How did you get away with it?
 Um, I just sort of waved at him and said, he said, both hands on the thing lady.
 And I said, I have frozen shoulder.
 I can't. And I just went right past him.
 We're missing a very, very, very far story.
 Where was my camera?
 In your hand.
 Where was your camera?
 In my shirt.
 More accurately.
 In the front of my shirt.
 Yeah, your phone was strategically placed and I don't think the poor little man knew what to do.
 I don't think he saw it. He just said to me, you need to have both hands on the stick thing
 that makes it go faster, slower. And I said, I can't, I have frozen shoulder. I can't use this
 arm for that. So you don't think he saw you? And he said, okay, no, I mean, it was just the very
 top of the phone that was sticking out of my shirt.
 And then the second guy didn't comment on the phone either.
 He just said, "You're supposed to be holding it with two hands."
 And I said, "I can't!"
 And I just went right by him.
 I didn't even slow down for him.
 You're just a rebel.
 Yeah, I know.
 Amazing, right?
 So that was our week.
 It went by fast.
 I think go by really fast.
 Yeah, anyway, we're super excited about the school starting in two weeks and a week.
 A week on Tuesday.
 Orientation is next week.
 next week.
 Crazy. And we're super excited about our team. Really excited about our leaders. We're just
 raring to go.
 Do you know what I'm excited about?
 No.
 Having a date with Muggins tomorrow.
 Muggins being your two and a half year old son.
 Yes.
 Okay, good.
 He's so adorable.
 He is very adorable and our kids did wonderfully with us being away for four days. The longest
 you have ever left them.
 Yes. Big shout out to Cindy, who took amazing care of our three precious things.
 They got tattoos and piercings and apparently didn't scream the whole time.
 She taught them to smoke and just kidding.
 No, they're in great condition and didn't seem to have any problems with
 us going, which is great.
 This week, I wanted to talk about leaders.
 Yes.
 In particular, how we pick our leaders.
 Okay.
 And what have we learned over the years?
 Okay.
 What are some of the things you look for in leaders?
 People you're going to pour into.
 I think one of the main things that we ask ourselves
 when we're looking at people for leaders or to be leaders
 is how many more of this person do we want?
  </li><li>Right, that's a great John Wimber question, wasn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, so when I look at Bob,
 how many more Bobs do I want?
 If the answer is I don't want any more Bobs,
 Bob needs to get a little bit of healing and blah, blah, blah,
 then Bob's not somebody I'm gonna pick
 as a leader at this moment.
  </li><li>Right.
 But if I'm looking at Bob and I'm like,
 gosh, I want 100 more Bob's easy decision.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Bob's somebody I want to invest in as a leader.
  </li><li>And yet there's more to it than that as well, isn't there?
 When we were out in Reading at Bethel Church,
 I sat in on a session that Danny Silk was doing,
 talking about leaders, raising leaders.
 And he said this great line, he said,
 whenever we are thinking about releasing leaders,
 we ask ourselves, will this person protect the culture that empowers them?
 Yeah.
 And that's often an overlooked aspect of leadership because you can find people with great leadership
 qualities.
 You could find people that you'd love to qualify, but sometimes you don't know what they're
 going to be like until they experience the ring of power.
 Right.
 And so what I mean by that is once you've released somebody into leadership, what do they do
 with that responsibility. Do the Lord over others, like the Bible warns against, or do
 they use it as a place of serving rather than status?
 Right. Which brings us to the third thing that we look for, which is teachability. Do
 you think that teachability is potentially the most important thing in a leader?
 Yeah, by far. We heard Lyle doing a periscope last week. Do you remember what he said and
 He was talking about the difference between being teachable and being trainable.
 It was brilliant.
 It was a periscope.
 And, and I think he said, like, if you're trainable, basically that person will kind of toe the line
 and check the boxes and do whatever they have to do to get into leadership.
 Those that are teachable will also check the boxes, but along the way they'll grow and they'll get input
 and they're going to stay in it for the long haul because they're in it.
 you know, to serve the leaders and to serve the vision where those that are
 trainable are really in it for themselves.
 Right.
 Human discrete distinction about anybody can be trainable.
 Anybody can set aside their agenda for a short period of time to accrue new
 skills, you know, to learn new things, whatever.
 But being teachable means you're willing to change.
 Yeah.
 So often when you're trainable, you want to just absorb some new stuff and
 you'll decide how it fits into your life if it does it's all. Being teachable means
 you're willing to subject yourself to another person's plan or another person's will. So
 yeah, we ask, how many more people would you like this person? We ask ourselves, will this
 person protect the culture that empowers them? i.e., are they going to go off and build their
 own kingdom? Or are they actually interested in reinforcing the kingdom and the culture
 that's present in the organization, in this case, the school? Because we've been very
 deliberate and very intentional in creating a culture. And then the third thing is, is
 there evidence of teachability? And the bonus for us is we have an eight month interview
 process. Called the school super natural. So we're with these people for eight months,
 and some of these people, much longer, some of these people did the school and for whatever
 circumstances, we couldn't ask them to be small group leaders. Perhaps we didn't need them,
 perhaps the demographics that year, we wouldn't need as many guy leaders or girl leaders,
 or it wasn't the right timing.
 So some of these people, you know, did the school two, three years ago, and we've just
 been able to watch.
 They've stuck around in our community, just been able to watch them grow and put into
 practice the things that perhaps they've learned in our community and in our culture.
 I think too, maybe the fourth thing that we look for is just God's favor on it.
 You know, I think we've definitely,
 I've definitely met Bob's, for example,
 that I thought, yes, I want more of Bob's,
 you know, I want more people like this person.
 But the Lord has said, hey, hang on just a second.
 You know, like just wait a bit.
 And it's not that the Lord isn't agreeing
 that that person, you know, that they're a great person.
 It's just, there's something else
 that the Lord wants to do in their life
 before what we have planned, you know?
 So I think one of the things that we also look at is,
 okay, Holy Spirit, it seems like a yes to us.
 Is it a yes to you?
 Is this the right thing at the right time for this person?
 And you know, that's where sometimes we've asked somebody
 to be a small group leader two years later or a year later
 because we wanted them that year,
 but we felt like the Holy Spirit said,
 I want you to wait.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I always turned out really well.
 What are some of the things that you think are really important to implement to set up
 new leaders for success?
 Clear communication, I think, is super important.
 Clear communication of what expectations are, of what their role is, of what level of authority
 they have, just to set them up to be able to actually know the parameters of what they're
 being released to do.
 What they're not being released to do, I think is super helpful.
 Yeah, I think a really important aspect is being given permission to lead the way they're built.
 Yeah.
 So all within the cultural parameters that we've set up.
 So our encouragement to our leaders is it would be terrible if you were a mini Allen or a mini AJ.
 That's not what we're looking for.
 We're looking for the cultural values that we feel the Holy Spirit is instilled in this
 particular organization to be infused by you and see the way you lead.
 Unilely differently, mean Jeffly differently, you and Christine lead differently.
 You have to have freedom to be able to do that and to work out what does work and what doesn't
 work all the while with intentional feedback from the leaders of the leaders. So Shannon,
 for example, our school pastor is walking alongside these new leaders and coaching them
 and giving them feedback and saying, "Well, what do you think you could have done differently?"
 Or, "Would I be able to help you with that?" And I think it's so important to place a high value
 on research and development.
 What I mean by that is you gotta give people permission to screw up and it to be okay.
 One of the things we encourage our leaders is,
 we're totally fine for you to screw up as long as you,
 you know, let us help you clean up the mess.
 Because it's so much more valuable to learn something by doing something wrong and then learning what you could do right.
 yeah then say me just coming along and saying hey this is what you should do yeah it's.
 I so i i love that we have.
 The freedom and the environment and the culture which jeff and becky have done an amazing job of creating.
 You know right from the get going we got here jeff and becky were so kind to us and saying hey you know that the areas responsibility we've given you are your forty acres.
 do what you want, call it if you need help or money. And often would come alongside us and go,
 hey, is there any way we could show you perhaps a better way? Or what did you learn from that? Or,
 us having the freedom to go to them and saying, hey, we're thinking of doing this,
 what are the blind spots we're not seeing? But being given the freedom to make mistakes is very,
 very refreshing. And encouraging new leaders that that's our paradigm is often difficult,
 especially if they served in a different culture, perhaps one that you know,
 you have to be exactly like the person who led you. Right, or values, nobody making mistakes.
 Right. That's a hostile ground for development. Yeah. I was also thinking that the problem with
 raising little clones, essentially, if they have to be just like you or they have to be just like
 me, they're gonna have the same weaknesses as well. Right. And really, you can't be the best version
 of you if you're trying to be me. So it's robbing you, it's robbing the world around you
 because you're trying to be me. What are some of the challenges
 that new leaders often face? I think, and maybe this will depend on their previous
 experience with leaders, but I think sometimes the challenge is that we don't actually believe
 that we're believed in, that we don't actually, that person is, that that leader is standing
 in front of them saying, "I believe in you, go for it." And they're going, "Well," and they're
 still role hesitant and stuff like that. But I would imagine that probably comes from previous
 experiences of people saying, "Hey, I believe in you." And then finding that they're getting
 you know, their hand slapped or whatever down the road.
 But I would say probably just not, um, not actually taking things at face value
 and stepping out, but that's why things have to be communicated really well in the first.
 Right.
 What are some of the biggest mistakes that you made early on learning to lead people?
 Oh, wow.
 I mean, a lot of mistakes.
 Um, well, apparently you're not supposed to punch people at church.
 Right.
 especially as a leader.
 Right.
 Yeah, so that was a big one.
 (laughing)
 Not even joking.
 Not even joking.
 But that was a long, long time ago.
 That was a long time ago.
 In a galaxy far, far away.
 Yeah, that was like about 20 years ago.
 Right.
 But I did do that as a leader.
 Aside from punching people at church.
 Aside from punching people.
 I think sometimes, particularly when I first started
 like leading small groups and stuff. I would have to have really real conversations with
 the Lord because I a lot of times really felt I understood people's hearts and I knew what
 was going on when I really didn't. Wow. So that's a big one. Yeah. So I would be like,
 a person didn't show up because of blah, blah, blah, or they were late because of whatever.
 And I'd get really aggravated. And then I'd ask the Holy Spirit about it and he'd be like,
 that wasn't what was happening.
 I'm like, "Ah."
 You know, so then I have to go through
 and prevent for how I judge them for being laid
 or whatever. - Right.
  </li><li>And really, you can't then go and love somebody
 enough to correct them or love somebody enough
 to talk to them about something.
 If you're still aggravated, it's never gonna turn out well.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I would say for me, it was learning
 that whole process of, "Okay, maybe don't judge them first.
 maybe chat with me first about what's going on.
 And don't think because you're the leader of this little group
 that you know everything that's going on.
  </li><li>Well, is that great Bill Johnson quote?
 We're at our dumbest when we think
 we know the motives of another.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And wow, I mean, there's a whole lot of stuff
 I wish I'd known before because the truth is
 you're doing the best you can with probably very little.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know what I mean when you start out,
 you're like, "I hope I'm doing this okay."
 And you're super self-conscious
 that everybody knows your insecurities and your weaknesses as leaders.
 Oh, yeah.
 Oh, yeah.
 What were some of the mistakes you made early on as a leader?
 Well, like you, there's a plethora.
 I think probably one of the big ones I made was valuing the process over the people.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, as somebody who loves to teach, I would spend perhaps more time caring about
 the teaching rather than the people who the teaching were for.
 And so, you know, you would have this thing where I'd be so over focused that I'd walk
 in a church and my priority was to get my presentation set up.
 And all the while missing all the people who wanted to connect.
 The person crying in the corner.
 Right, thinking, "Yeah, if you just hold on, this presentation will kill you and it'll
 just be awesome and I'll answer the very thing you're upset about."
 But what most people actually want is genuine connection.
 And that took me a long time to realize that.
 So, you know, I remember Jeff Dollar taking me aside one day and just in Alan, you need
 to walk a lot slower because everywhere you walk is with purpose.
 And so to get from point A to point B, you're ignoring everybody along the way just so you
 can get whatever it is in your head off your checklist.
 And I was like, oh, yeah.
 And I still struggle with that a little bit.
 I have to coach myself mentally and think slow down, slow down, actually connect, stop,
 touch. And I mean, that's one example that springs to mind, but there's, there's many.
 And that's why I'm grateful for other leaders in our lives who would call us on stuff.
 Yeah, I think another one is, well, certainly for me, I'd imagine for you, we're probably
 the worst people to gauge when we're doing too much.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 So it's very helpful having Jeff and others over the years who would stop us and just say, hey, you don't look like you're flourishing.
 Yeah.
 And, you know, often the way we're wired, like, oh, we're not flourishing.
 Well, it's our new project.
 That would be great.
 When actually maybe rest is more in order than a project.
 I think probably because we're both shapers or both builder type personalities.
 We're not very good at stopping.
 Right.
 I think the other thing is as leaders that it's probably taken us years to come to grips with is the amount of influence that you have over people.
 Yeah, never never realized that at all.
 So people would be like, Hey, would you, you know, come to my party or you're invited to the wedding or whatever?
 And you would think Alan, like it won't matter to them if I'm there or, you know, whatever, right?
 Because not like not for any devious reason, but just because you're like, you know,
 I probably wouldn't notice who was wherever whatever. And then we started thinking in terms of,
 okay, now if I had a party and I invited John and Carol, for example, would I have noticed if
 they showed up? Yeah, sure would have. Would it have said something to me even if they could only
 show up for 10 minutes? Yeah, it sure would have. We had to start thinking in paradigms outside of
 ourselves right because i couldn't get my head around why it would matter.
 What's back to the old adage of in your efforts to remain.
 Humble or in your efforts to not think too big of yourself.
 I think we are on the side of we don't have any influence but that's foolish thinking and until you actually correctly evaluate who you are to your community.
 There's a danger that if you don't embrace that or at least acknowledge that you rob people from the reason God put you in their midst.
 And you can be unknowingly trashing their hearts in the process totally.
 And that's a hard.
 I love what John Paul Jackson said he said let other people tell you who you are.
 And we've we've really tried to do that because the dangers if you tell other people who you are so I'll hear people all the time just say well you know I'm a father in the city or I'm you know an apostolic leader and I'm like.
 if you have to tell people who you are people generally will never believe you.
 But if you let other people tell you who you are you'll never be able to convince them otherwise yeah and i think that was a very helpful.
 You think actually listening to how people are receiving you and seeing if that lines up with what the holy spirit is saying about you yeah and then embracing that.
 And I think I've probably spent a lot of time ignoring that for fear of being arrogant or
 and then the process slowed down the reason that God's actually put you in leadership.
 John Arnett used to say that healed up leaders are the greatest gift to God's church.
 I saw this thing on Facebook and I really liked it. I didn't repost it because I thought,
 gosh, it could appear a bit cynical and I don't think it was meant in that way, but it's very
 very hard to tell the Facebook post. But John A. Kuff wrote this. He said, "I'd love to
 see a conference where the spouses of leaders tell you the truth about the leader. On stage
 you can pretend at home you can't." And so that's one of the things I love about John
 and Carol to this day, that they're the same people on stage as they are off stage. That's
 something that really impacted us. And I could have just been around too many leaders who
 are great when they're on, but really, really broken, sometimes unhappy, often not nice
 people to be around when they're not on.
 Yeah, they're leaving a trail of destruction.
 And it doesn't matter how good you are when you're on.
 Right.
 You know, who you are will absolutely come out.
 Yeah.
 And so I think that's one of the reasons I love the value that many ministries today
 are placing on having your heart healed up. The more healing we get, the better leaders
 we become, the better spouse we become, the better parents we become. I guess that comes
 back to teachability too. I've seen great leaders who got great competency, but when
 they refuse to deal with the stuff that's in their hearts, it will basically end up consuming
 them.
 using John and Carol, for an example,
 they've led a worldwide revival for over 20 years.
 And they'll still say stuff to us, like,
 oh, I want to come and take your prophetic course,
 or, oh, I wish I could go to your school, or whatever.
 And they're not just saying that,
 they actually mean that.
 They're still hungry to learn,
 and they don't care how old you are,
 who they're learning from.
 Do you know what I mean?
  </li><li>Right.
 They're just people that are, they've set their hearts to learn all that they can and
 to learn the different facets of God.
 And they don't care if you're 40 years younger than they are, they want to learn.
 Right.
 I just got an email from John this weekend who was like, "I'm at this conference.
 I'm with this 30 year old guy who's setting the world on fire.
 You need to connect with him."
 So here's John who's in his 70s, who's totally impacted by somebody, you know, half his age.
 And I just love that he's a lifelong learner.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Teachability. - Yeah.
  </li><li>I have a listen question for you.
 This is from Lee, and he asks this question.
 We've all experienced hurts of the past,
 but it comes upon in life where Jesus invites us
 out of the things we hide in and brings us into freedom.
 Do you have any advice for facing your fears
 and stepping out to become who you were meant to be?
  </li><li>I suppose it kind of depends on what things
 in the past you're facing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But just sort of as a general blanket statement,
 get wise people around you and then choose to listen to them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Let them speak into your life about the things
 that are maybe holding you back.
 Because sometimes, you know,
 the things that are holding us back,
 there might be some legitimacy to it,
 but it's now become something that's much bigger than it is.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, you know, like whether it's a victim mindset
 because there were some things that we went through
 children and now we believe it's always going to be like that or you know whatever our things
 are that are holding us up.
 Those are all things that God wants to see us freed from so that we can walk into what
 our destiny is.
 So I would say get people around you that will tell you the truth, not just what you
 want to hear and that have tools to help you work through the stuff so that you can go
 ahead and be who you're supposed to be.
 Yeah.
 I also think it's important that you understand that the Holy Spirit is desperately interested
 and making you more and more like Jesus.
 Yeah.
 And he's very good at that job.
 And he never brings up anything to embarrass you.
 He only ever brings it up to release you from it.
 Which is amazing.
 And so just yield to the Holy Spirit.
 Be around people who have got the life that you would like
 because you become like the lowest common denominator
 of the people you hang around with.
 So hang around with brilliant people.
 Me too.
 Find a great community of people that will champion you
 who will love you on your path to being awesome.
 And yeah, just kick fear in the throat, really,
 because no good fruit comes from following fear.
