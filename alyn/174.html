<p> I live in a days but got for Monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one seventy four of keeping up with the jones is where this week we're talking about how to start something new.
 But first a day to jones how is our week it was a great week was net is that because we were at work for more than half of it.
 Yes, we had a glorious four days off.<br/>
 Thank you, thanksgiving.<br/>
 Yes, we're quite fond of Thanksgiving.
 No, I know that you say that you're used to Thanksgiving because you have it in Canada, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 I don't know.<br/>
 Wait a minute, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 The Canadian celebrate Thanksgiving.<br/>
 It's a family holiday.<br/>
 But it's different than American Thanksgiving.
 Well, because we celebrate on a Monday instead of on a Thursday, which is so random.
 Well, Thursday or Monday's random?<br/>
 Thursday.<br/>
 Why is Monday not random?<br/>
 Well, Monday is like the natural day off for the end of a week.
 You know, you just sort of have a long weekend and you go into a Monday.
 How is that the end of a week?<br/>
 It's a week.<br/>
 Well, like a holiday.<br/>
 Really?<br/>
 But you only get one day in America.<br/>
 You get Thursday and Friday.<br/>
 Well, I'm not sure everybody gets Thursday and Friday.
 We just do black Friday.<br/>
 Black Friday is not all the day.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 The marketing is working on you.<br/>
 Wait, I don't get to side on Monday.<br/>
 No, you have to work on cyber Monday, darling.
 I feel like I've been short changed.<br/>
 I still don't understand Thanksgiving.
 I mean, of course, I understand it.<br/>
 I know the history blah, blah, blah, blah, but because because we weren't born in America,
 erased in America, we don't have any of the cultural trappings.
 I'm wondering if next year we need to find a family to take us in for an authentic American
 Thanksgiving experience.<br/>
 We have had one or two of those.<br/>
 No, we haven't.<br/>
 Yes, we have.<br/>
 We haven't gone down to East House for Thanksgiving.
 Yes, we have the first year we're here.
 We went to James Galt's house for Thanksgiving and they put on a huge spread.
 That's true.<br/>
 I just assumed because it was at James's house, it wouldn't have been like an
 accurate representation of a normal American household.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, there was a lot of singing.<br/>
 And I mean, in the kind of possible way, I love you, James, the pieces,
 but they had their own cranberry sauce.
 So there's got to be something traditional about that.
 How do you remember all these details?
 Because I don't like cranberry sauce.<br/>
 So I remember watching it.<br/>
 So it stuck out from trauma.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Not drama. I didn't eat it, but the turkey was good.
 What did we do for Thanksgiving food this year?
 We did the traditional Mexican Thanksgiving meal.
 Tacos.<br/>
 Tacos.<br/>
 Here's the thing. We got Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday off.
 I had one shower in all those days.<br/>
 I noticed.<br/>
 We basically lived in our pajamas for that whole season.
 And then I remember you just spent the morning tidying,
 and then you were about to start cooking.
 And I was like, babe, do you really want to mess up the kitchen?
 You just tidied.<br/>
 Could we not do like a big meal tomorrow?
 We could just graze on chips and pretzels and tacos.
 And so you were like, sure.<br/>
 So we just said tacos.<br/>
 Yeah, because tacos are easy.<br/>
 No, when I say tacos, I'm more mean fajitas for those of you
 that are in the know, but yeah, they're not really.
 It wasn't like ground beef.<br/>
 It was brisket and it was kind of brisket tacos, baby.
 Okay.<br/>
 You can have chicken tacos.<br/>
 You can have a variety of feelings in tacos.
 Okay, but we do for heat of edge and it's they're more like fajitas.
 If you ask me based on your cultural heritage, yes, okay, I shut it.
 I loved it because basically I spent four days playing video games with the kids.
 Yes.<br/>
 And you got some space to yourself downstairs playing video games by yourself.
 I did.<br/>
 I, I, I did a lot of, well, not a lot, but I did some tidying and that kind of stuff, but
 I played a cotan.<br/>
 You just love your settlers of cotan.<br/>
 I do.<br/>
 It's quiet.<br/>
 It's lethal.<br/>
 I don't like actually playing online against people because then I feel bad for like trouncing
 them where when I play against the computer, I don't feel bad at all.
 I thought the whole time you're always playing against the computer.
 I mean, there's real life people who play against you.
 I have I've played against some people online that are friends of mine and I was mocked
 for it last night.<br/>
 Why?<br/>
 Well, because I was sitting with Cindy, who I play against online sometimes.
 Is she good?<br/>
 She's good, but she moves slower than I would like, so I tend to heckle her.
 I text her in the middle of the games and heckle.
 And so I think it's just better if I play against a computer.
 But how are Lou friends?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Play guitar.<br/>
 I'm too competitive for playing with friends.
 Aside from, aside from pajamas and tacos, we had a great Thanksgiving.
 If Thanksgiving was just nonstop rest.
 Yes, but the one thing I've noticed is, and I've noticed this before,
 I think, I think we go at such a pace that when we actually stop for a whole day,
 I feel dead tired. Like so by Wednesday at dinner,
 I was just like, Oh my gosh, I feel like I've been run over by a truck.
 And I still felt like that on Thursday.
 So I didn't really start to feel like,
 oh, this rest is doing something<br/>
 until probably Saturday morning.<br/>
 I was like, oh, I feel like myself again.
</p><ul>
  <li>That's really video games, babe.
 That's where you need to play Nintendo
 because Nintendo helps lower all of the anxiety immediately.
  </li><li>I don't think that can possibly be true.
 I end up digging my nails into my hands
 and trying to, you know, yeah, it's not really my thing.
  </li><li>Possibly.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Aside from that, we had Artie Kendall in at the school.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Which was amazing.
 Yesterday I got a phone call that poor pastor Jeff was sick.
 We got food poisoning.
 Yeah.
 So last minute I jumped up and spoke this morning on dreams.
 And it was awesome.
 You were very kind.
 I had a great time.
 I loved our love.
 I love our Grace and her family.
 They they're so fun to teach.
 I thoroughly enjoyed it.
 Said a lot of fun with that.
 Excellent.
 All right.
 Our main topic for this week is a little close to home.
 Yeah.
 It's all about starting something new.
 It's hard, isn't it?
 I think it seems harder than it actually is.
 You're probably right.
 You mean before you sort of launch into it, you look at it and go, oh, my gosh, this is epic.
 Yeah, most of the obstacles you're actually going to face in starting something new
 are usually in your head, like the barrier of entry to most things.
 I mean, I'm sure if you want to start parachute jumping, there's some significant
 barriers to overcome.
 One would help.
 But I mean, if you want to start packing your parachute type courses,
 finding a pilot, that's sort of stuff.
 But I mean, we're working, working plane, that sort of thing.
 Yeah.
 We've got a bunch of friends.
 who are starting podcasts or starting small businesses or starting a blog or starting music production, whatever.
 And it's very, very hard to start in something that's already established because you're constantly comparing yourself to what's already out there.
 And I think the danger there is we defeat ourselves before we even start.
 Yeah, well, I think if if you're constantly looking at what other people are doing,
 then you're constantly feeling behind the eight ball.
 But I think it's different if you know the Lord's asked you to do it, hopefully,
 because then it has nothing to do with what anybody else is doing, because it's
 just a thing of obedience.
 The other thing is we're always our own worst critic, aren't we?
 Oh, yeah.
 I, uh, and that's, I just, I look at all my friends who are super brilliant.
 Like let's take Sarah Parsons, for example, right?
 a phenomenal painter. It could be, and I don't think this is true, but it could be that Sarah's
 just like, "Oh, I don't think I'm a very good painter." And so, you know, I'm not sure. I just
 feel like I always paint the same stuff. Nobody's going to be interested. She could talk herself out
 of the brilliant artwork that she produces, not realizing that she doesn't need to paint like
 anybody else, because what she produces, I mean, we love. I love people love.
 Yes, please don't paint like anybody else. Please be you.
 Right.
 Right.
 But what if Sarah was facing all these thoughts like, "Well, I don't know. I don't know if I'm
 original laugh, it just feels like whatever, whatever the lies are in her head. Do you know
 the four stages of learning things? I forget somebody's mentioned this at Grace Center the other day.
 I think it was you. I don't think so because I remember listening to them
 because I think they said it wrong. But anyway, the four stages are unconscious incompetence.
 That's where you don't know that you don't know or ignorance. So unconscious incompetence,
 conscious incompetence, which is where you're aware of what you don't know,
 you're a beginner something then you moved to conscious competence you're aware of what you are doing right but requires a lot of mental energy it's not coming naturally,
 that's where you're kind of like an amateur you've been practicing a little bit and then eventually unconscious competence where you're unaware of your skills you basically reached,
 it's not your unaware of your skills but your it's so second nature to you that you're your best expert.
 When the fun part is when you're in ignorance you don't know what you don't know to start with a novel and you're like you haven't given this any thought right so ever you have no idea what's ahead of you and that's kind of fun.
 Right then you usually hit that beginner stage where you're consciously incompetent you're suddenly aware of like i don't know what i'm doing i don't have a plot i don't know characters i am never gonna be as good as.
 Francine rivers she hip hop artist i'm not sure her to use like my favorite author so when we're beginners the largest noise in our head is what we don't know.
 And so all we've got to keep his company is our shortcomings.
 Right so failures constantly your head what if i do this and nobody likes it or you know that whole thing but like we said with anything done well you have to actually keep doing it just like any any discipline absolutely but everybody wants to skip that part.
 and just get to excellent.
 Well, of course.
 So do I, if I'm honest.
 Mm-hmm.
 But here's the thing.
 Here's the little secret that nobody tells you about.
 Iteration is your friend.
 What does that mean?
 Iteration?
 Iteration?
<strong>[LAUGHING]</strong>
 Iteration.
 That's very profound, young man.
 What are you talking about?
 Iteration is repetition.
 And with each repetition, things get refined.
 So think of a rough piece of wood.
 When you take a plane to that, with each swipe of that,
 that's an iteration.
 And as you do that, the wood gets smoother and smoother
 or cut into shape.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So think about the original iPhone.
 It got released in one way.
 It was hugely revolutionary,
 but in another sense, it was quite limited.
 Like you couldn't copy and paste.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You couldn't install apps.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You couldn't download anything onto it.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But now like you're on the iPhone 10
 and they've solved all those problems.
 So you know, Apple releases a product,
 then they iterate and the product gets better
 and better and better.
 Most of us will never release a product,
 whether that's book, blog, song, EP, whatever,
 for fear that it's not gonna be good.
 The point isn't to be good yet,
 the point is to get over the hurdle of fear,
 and it's probably gonna be better than you thought it was,
 but it probably won't be as good as you wanted it to be.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Don't let that hinder you being productive.
  </li><li>It makes me think actually of when Dan was talking
 about when Bill was writing his first book,
 and they were just basically like,
 "Bill, just write something, let's get it out there.
 "You can do second edits and that kind of stuff,
 let's just get it out there.
 -But didn't you find out when you were writing your book
 so it was easier to edit a complete page
 than edit an empty page?
 -I didn't even try and edit it at all
 because my gut was to just trash the whole thing.
 -Which you did several times.
 -Which I did.
 And so in the version that actually became the book,
 I didn't do any editing at all.
 I literally sent the whole thing off to the person
 who did the first edit and then took their notes
 and fix things and it was edited four times.
 But I feel like it still sounds like me
 because all the people that did the editing know me.
 So, but I just thought this isn't my gift
 and I'm gonna scrap it if I do that.
 So I need to play to my strengths.
  </li><li>And you, how many times did you scrap the book?
 I remember it was a couple times.
  </li><li>Two times, yeah.
  </li><li>So you started, you had a chunk and then you scrapped it.
  </li><li>Yeah, I had like six or seven chapters
 and then I deleted the whole thing.
 So I was like, can't do it.
  </li><li>I wish you'd listened to this podcast before you did that.
 I know, and then I did the same thing again,
 but I think I only got three or four chapters
 in that time and then I scrapped the whole thing.
 And then I waited a couple of years
 and until I had a plan.
  </li><li>Well, it's interesting what you say,
 because what about that dynamic
 when you've actually started something,
 but it isn't where you want it to be.
 In your case, you blew up.
 My advice, and perhaps your advice now, question mark,
 is actually don't blow up.
 Don't start again.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Just redirect all your energy.
  </li><li>Yeah, and honestly, I think it was just,
 I was listening to that voice of perfectionism and fear.
 And so I let it have a say.
  </li><li>Yeah, that thing's a big monster.
 You have to understand it's easier to steer
 a moving ship than a parked car.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So you're just like, let's just blow up the car
 and start again, you're like, no, no, no,
 take what you've got and iterate, like improve.
 Yeah, you get other people's feedback in there and help.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Do you remember when we started podcasting?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Right, all the voices in our head
 were louder than our own voices in our head.
  </li><li>I couldn't imagine that anybody was actually
 going to listen.
 Right.
 Well, that was the big thing.
 I'm scared.
 If I do this, nobody's going to listen.
 Yeah.
 I'm scared that I'm telling people, "Oh, we're going to start a podcast and then no one's
 going to listen."
 Or we're scared we're going to run out of ideas.
 I honestly did think that.
 I think I've said that before, but I was like, "Uh, okay, so I imagine we'll probably
 get about 10 podcasts in and then realize we don't have energy, we have nothing left
 to say," or nobody's listening.
 And so either way, I didn't imagine it was going to last.
 Right.
 technical things like I actually didn't know anything about microphone
 technique for I don't know maybe our first 20 or 30 episodes we never had
 headphones we were like why would we need headphones I know should we
 demonstrate that whole on access off access you can explain it will I go like
 this
 come on
 you didn't want to explain that for people it's really exciting basically we
 We had our friend Chris McLarney on the show and he was like, "Hey, afterwards we just
 said, Chris, do you have any advice?"
 He said, "Yeah, you need to get headphones."
 We were like, "Well, how do we need headphones?"
 Like, we can hear each other.
 He's like, "Yeah, but you can't hear yourself."
 And one of the dangers is that you go off-axis and we were like, "Go on."
 And he's like, "Well, the important thing about mic technique is that you keep your
 face in a specific location so the microphone can pick you up.
 And if you don't have headphones, you won't know when you've missed that place."
 So for example, if I turn my head to the side and speak, I sound completely different.
 Like the audio is terrible.
 I can hear that in my headphones.
 You can probably hear that in your speakers right now.
 And it's terrible.
 But if you don't have headphones, you can't tell that.
 Now we didn't know that.
 But again, somebody helped us with that.
 Did we delete all the previous episodes and rerecord?
 No, just I remember a good friend, Jonathan Zias, he gave us some great advice.
 He said, "Never be afraid to iterate in public."
 and don't be afraid to put something out there and then make it better and better because
 actually your audience will appreciate the journey of growing something together.
 So if you're a painter, if you're a poet, if you're a YouTube or whatever, put something
 out even if it's not perfect.
 I mean, make it as good as you can make it for sure.
 And if there's glaring errors, of course, don't put that out, but put something out
 and grow together, making it better and better and better.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think people love being on the journey with you
 and new things.
 You know, I think it's quite fun.
 Like as an observer, you know, watching people like Elena
 start her blog and stuff like that.
 I'm like, this is super exciting.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And, you know, as a cheerleader,
 you're not necessarily looking for perfection from people.
 You're just looking to watch them grow
 and be part of the journey with them.
 So, I don't know.
  </li><li>What do you think about research?
  </li><li>I mean, obviously I like planning.
 So I think research is a great idea.
 But I think there's a total danger
 that we can hide in research
 and then never actually start anything
 'cause we're just needing more research all the time.
  </li><li>Needing more, the two biggest traps
 I think we fall into is needing more research
 or needing better equipment.
 And I think both of those things are myth.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Talk about you, I mean, it's hard
 because nobody can see this,
 but you've done a bunch of woodworking projects
 in the house.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You did a beautiful wall in our guest bedroom.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 gutted a closet, I guess, a whole closet and made it into a beautiful, what we call a drop zone.
 Yeah. Talk us through that process because you'd never done anything like that before,
 and you were just like, "I'm going to do this." And I'm like, "You're amazing." And it turned out brilliant.
 Well, I guess I just thought, "There's no reason I can't do it." You know, I want to do it.
 See. See. See. I'm putting myself in your shoes, and you're like, "Babe, can you build me a
 I built in, I'd be like, no, no.
 And I would think there's every reason why I can't do it.
 Well, so here's the thing.
 I like math and--
 Wait, what are you saying here?
 Well, nothing, darling.
 Nothing, just that you don't enjoy it as much as I do
 or excel at it, perhaps.
 True.
 So I like math and I like design things.
 And my dad was an architect, so I sort of grew up
 around thinking three dimensionally.
  </li><li>My father was a plant virologist and--
  </li><li>You can't garden either, but that's okay, son.
  </li><li>Okay.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Did you just sun me?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Go on.
  </li><li>So I just, I thought, well, if I could get the right tools,
 there's no reason I can't do it.
 I mean, you know, I watched Fixer Upper
 and things like that, there's no reason I can't do it.
 So I just got a couple of basic tools,
 found out, did research.
 Found out what are the basic tools that I need to build the kind of stuff that I want to build
 and then used gift certificates and stuff like that from birthday presents and Christmas to get all the different tools
 and then plan my first project and then did research on what kind of wood I wanted to use.
 So there's lots of research involved, but then eventually you just have to decide you're going to do it.
 Well, that's the key.
 Yeah.
 I know it's not.
 I know you're probably wishing for like more steps than just do it.
 But a shield of both just said, you've got to do it.
 like you've actually just got to do it.
 Yeah.
 Do your research and then put something out.
 Yeah.
 So I did.
 I just did it and it turned out great, which was fantastic.
 Now it's not perfect.
 There's things I do differently if I've ever built it again, but that's part of learning.
 And that's the beautiful thing, isn't it?
 Again, that's iteration.
 The next time you do it, you've learned, okay, I'm going to do this and we'll do that.
 I'll do it differently.
 Yeah.
 And then your cousin Paul who is this is what he does for a living.
 Yes.
 He came and stayed and he was like, oh, you did a great job.
 You might want to look at this product or try this differently and you're like, "Okay,
 so it's easier to collect information to add to a body of work than have nothing and just
 be collecting spurious pieces of information."
 His input had somewhere to land because you had something already.
 Right.
 I knew what I needed to learn to do differently because in some places I'm like, "Oh, I wanted
 that to look a little bit different."
 great as long as you can not be prideful and just go, "Wow, you know, the next time I do
 something like that, I think I want it to look more like this than you actually know what you're
 talking about now instead of just rough ideas, but not really any sort of tangible things."
 All right. Any other closing words of encouragement for people who want to start something new?
 And I think if it's on your heart to do it, then do it.
 I think be kind to yourself and don't give up.
 Yeah, I think anything that's on your heart to do, if we can kind of get over ourselves and actually try it, it'll be life.
 Right.
 So it's not it can't be about being perfect.
 If everything's about being perfect, none of us try anything.
 Right.
 So go and be fun, be fun, have fun.
 Do you want to listen to this question?
 Yes.
 This one's from Hillary.
 Hillary says, hello, Alan, AJ.
 I'm in a group that is working through the Finding Father book.
 We're almost at the end of week one.
 Oh, yay.
 I also listened to your guys podcast and was curious about what your guys quiet
 time looks like now versus when you had small babies.
 Do you take time in the morning or night?
 How do you schedule into your days?
 Brilliant question.
 It's super random right now.
 I would say we we get in seasons where we're both getting up at 5,
 30 or 6 and spending time in the morning with the Lord.
 And then we also get in seasons where it's chunks of time at night or when I'm
 Jason preschool or whatever.
 So it's not anywhere near as planned out as I previously had before little babies.
 Because they didn't have three children.
 No, I mean, I just had me to think about.
 And I'd like to get back to it being larger chunks of time.
 I just don't know what that looks like in the current iteration of our lives.
 See, I used to word, iteration.
 No, did that work?
 I'm sure it's different context, but yeah, great.
 I think that's true. I think you have to be super flexible with your life to adjust to the seasons of life that you had.
 Like when I met you, you would spend four or five hours a day with a Lord, but then you didn't have a family and you didn't have a full time job.
 I mean, you did. You're an itinerant speaker, but when you were not speaking, you were at home.
 You didn't have like an office to go to nine to five.
 So you could come home and spend large quantities of time.
 Right.
 If you spent that amount of time with the Lord now, well, it's funny.
 say you get fired from your job, but you have you have
 responsibilities to go to you can.
 I can't just disappear for five hours a day.
 Yeah.
 And so I think it's so important to not beat yourself up to
 prioritize your time, the Lord, but not beat yourself up in the
 process is not looking like you wanted to.
 So I would say the same that we've gone through various times
 and seasons.
 They look differently.
 Right now I have a schedule that I really, really like I can tell
 when my schedule gets off.
 like when we have guests to stay,
 it's harder for me to keep that schedule with the Lord,
 which sounds terrible because I'd basically have to ignore
 my house guests, which I don't wanna do,
 but I can tell the difference in my walk with the Lord.
 It sounds so dramatic, but in the frequency
 and the fluency of my time with the Lord, it changes.
 So I love having regular times with the Lord,
 but the when that's happened has varied with our life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, well, that's the podcast for this week.
  </li><li>A.J. Jones, tell us what we need to know.
  </li><li>I'm just wondering if, as you're listening,
 if you could think of anybody who might be encouraged
 by this podcast that might be encouraged,
 even by today's topic of starting something new,
 if you wanna send them a link,
 it is <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/174
 so that they can listen to it
 and be inspired to start something new.
 Often we think of other people
 when we're listening to things
 and sometimes we forget to share the thing
 has made us think of them.
 And also, if you're working on something or you're starting something new or you've
 been inspired, you've been thinking about it for a while, but now our podcast topics
 finally kicked your blessed assurance into gear.
 Reach out to some Twitter or tag us on Instagram so we can see what you're doing.
 We'd love to see all the creative projects that you're getting into.
 Lastly, if you want the show notes for this episode, go to alan and AJ.com/174.
 Thanks so much for listening.
 We'll be back next week.
