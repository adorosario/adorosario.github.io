<p> Good afternoon Mr Jones. Are you.<br/>
 Are you impersonating somebody? I'm being Sean Connery.
 No, I'm supposed to be Miss Money Penny. Hello Mr Bond.
 I'd call it to know why you have to be Miss Money Penny and why you think that Miss Money
 Penny sounds like an old librarian.<br/>
 but the thing is, is you usually say, "When hello Miss Monty Penny" or whatever in your
 little cute Scottish accent and I can't do it.
 When do I say, "When do I greet you as Miss Monty Penny?"
 Are you having a stroke?<br/>
 You do, just confess.<br/>
 I have no clue what you're talking about.
 It'll be good for you.<br/>
 Confession is good for this all.<br/>
 Okay, should we move on?<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 Talk to me about this week.<br/>
 Highly if your week was usually food of some sort, but it was actually probably
 having people that have known me for years and years and years in town.
 Yes, that was very nice.<br/>
 Who are your people?<br/>
 My people were Mark and Kim DuPont who have known, I've known them for
 probably 22 years at this point.<br/>
 And Laura and Daniel Woodley-Osmond, although I suppose he's not really a Woodley,
 But she's a woody osmond and he's just an osmond.
 How long have you known Laura and Dan for?
 Um, well, Dan, I've only known since he kind of married.
 Well, he didn't kind of marry Laura.<br/>
 He did marry.<br/>
 We were there.<br/>
 We saw that it was very official.<br/>
 I've got a graph of wedding.<br/>
 I have pictures to prove it.<br/>
 Um, so he I've probably only known for eight years or something like that, but
 Laura, I've known for like 15, maybe.<br/>
 Well, that's beautiful.<br/>
 They were amazing.<br/>
 If you match making the conference, you'll know what we're talking about.
 Laura was leading worship and Mr. Mark was speaking in his very deep voice.
 Very deep voice.<br/>
 There it is.<br/>
 Look, there it is.<br/>
 You know, you know, if Mark listens to this, we're dead next time.
 You'll be like, what are you talking about?
 There it is.<br/>
 Actually, he's a prophet.<br/>
 You probably already knows it happened.
 Oh, dear.<br/>
 We're in big trouble.<br/>
 For our whole family.<br/>
 I got sick this week.<br/>
 That wasn't fun.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 You lied in bed and moaned.<br/>
 That's what you do when you're sick.<br/>
 Well, that's what you do when you're sick.
 I don't know.<br/>
 Over 40 years, I've perfected my sick mode.
 Laura, Laura.<br/>
 But things go better because we went to see Guardians of the Galaxy.
 Yes, but you didn't say how long you lied in bed sick for.
 40 hours.<br/>
 40 hours.<br/>
 It took me a long time to look for it.
 And who had the children?<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 All right, let's move on.<br/>
 You didn't.<br/>
 We heard a babysitter and you went to Frawly Monkey.
 I only went to Fati Monkey for four hours because I had work to do.
 You're a real Florence Nightingale.<br/>
 We're amazing.<br/>
 You and Mother Teresa, you're just twin together.
 I kept offering you food and you go and learn any food.
 That's how I know you're actually really sick.
 And then later on, when you started feeling better, you wanted to eat like three
 meals back to back.<br/>
 Oh, he started to feel better tomorrow should be fine.
 Making up for last time.<br/>
 Do you want to talk about cultivate boldness and Danielle
</p><ul>
  <li>Danielle Hausen.
  </li><li>Danielle Hausen is a rock star.
  </li><li>She really is, she's absolutely amazing.
 Not only is she is our fabulous school administrator
 at the School of Supernatural Life,
 but she also helped from the Perfect Team at Gray Center.
 But most recently she did what?
  </li><li>She took a team of four others,
 so her and her four others, so five of them,
 went to New York City,
 'cause she felt like the Lord put New York City on her heart.
 And they basically did their own evangelistic outreach
 just demonstrating the kingdom.
 Science, wonders, miracles, that sort of thing.
 So they prayed for people and they got healed
 and they profited over people in Central Park
 and led people to the Lord and just did the stuff.
  </li><li>As you've been following our blog,
 we posted a link to Danielle's blog
 called Cult of It Boldness.
 If you have time this week,
 I would really encourage you to go check out,
 read some of the stories, watch their videos.
 It's amazing.
 That actually sums up Danielle brilliantly.
 She felt like God said, go to New York
 and then she put action to it.
  </li><li>Yeah, and the cool thing about the team that went
 is some of them are extroverts,
 and some of them are total introverts, but they all did it.
 And Danielle leading it, you know,
 when we first met her, she was super shy,
 wouldn't say boo to a goose.
 And--
  </li><li>You don't have a lot of people to say boo to goosees.
 I actually think it's illegal.
  </li><li>To say boo to a goose?
  </li><li>Yeah, you give them more feel.
  </li><li>You're not allowed to scare a goosees.
 They're not very nice either,
 especially Canadian geese, I have to say, vicious.
  </li><li>Yeah, I remember that.
  </li><li>Yep.
 targets. They don't target.
 So, yeah, I mean, she was super, super quiet when she came on the school. And then the
 Lord just did something in her. And, you know, she leads our Friday night lights, outreaches
 from the church. And this is a lifestyle thing for her, but she is just stinking amazing.
 Well done, Daniel. We're very proud of you.
 We're so proud of you.
 We'll put her links in the show notes. So if you're interested, go check them out. We
 We have some readers questions, but I don't actually have time to answer them this week
 because we've got such a fascinating topic for discussion.
 I want to kick off by talking about our staff meeting this week at church.
 Yes.
 So, we had the conference, Mark and Laura were in, and on Wednesday morning we met as a staff.
 No, Tuesday morning.
 Tuesday morning, well met as a staff.
 Just talking about what God had done, what God was doing, what we feel the Holy Spirit
 was up to and AJ was sharing a testimony.
  </li><li>Well, I was sharing about, on Sunday night,
 I had dinner with Mark and Kim
 and just was catching up with them
 and they were talking about this church in San Diego
 that makes a book every two years
 about the miracles they've seen.
 So whatever documented miracles they have,
 they put all the documentation and whatever
 in this little book that they make every two years.
 and their congregation buys the book for a dollar
 from the church and then uses that to hand out,
 like in their neighborhoods or when they come across
 people that are having a bad day
 or don't realize that God is real or whatever,
 they can give them this as like,
 hey, look, God's still moving, God's still doing stuff.
 So I was telling the staff that about,
 the market would have been sharing about that and then--
  </li><li>So you may not believe what I'm gonna say
 because we shared this with a bunch of people
 and we end up with blank faces.
 But no sooner had A.G. taught about the booklets that
 Mars Church was doing,
 then my phone, which was on vibrate,
 so it was on silence mode with the ringer way down
 on the table in front of me,
 a noise came out of my phone.
 It sounded like a little trumpet and eight bit trumpet,
 (imitates trumpet)
 and then a man's voice audibly said,
 very, very clearly to the whole room,
 it is God's plan to bring transformation to your city.
 then we all freaked out.
 Now here's the thing, I know how to use my phone.
 My phone was, when that noise happened,
 and when that man spoke, my screen did not light up.
 When I unlocked my phone, I checked my mis notifications.
 There was no app that had sent that notification.
 When I double tapped to see what apps were opened,
 there was no apps that would make a noise like that.
 Everyone was kind of stunned.
 Also, when it made that noise, my screen didn't light up.
 I already say that.
 Okay, I don't know.
 I've told the story so many times.
 But we all freaked out.
 And here's the thing, if it was anybody else's phone,
 I think I would have just dismissed it
 as it was a buffering YouTube video.
 Or you maybe had a Bible app of the day
 and it was a who knows what.
 But because it was my phone and I know my phone,
 it was just staggering for all of us.
 And you know, Jeff made a great point.
 In the Old Testament, the Lord spoke to Balaam
 through his donkey.
 And I can imagine him going back to the cantaloupe guys.
 never guess what just happened, you know, God spoke to me through a donkey and people
 were just like, ah, ah, ah, ah, but God spoke to us through an iPhone in the meeting. There
 was, I don't know how many people are on staff, 25, 30 people in the room who all heard it.
 We all kind of freaked out a little bit.
 Yeah, but not freaked out in the sphere.
 In a good way.
 No, no, it was just like, wow.
 The content and the timing of it was just absolutely astonishing and the fact that nobody was near
 the phone anyway, it was like the cherry on the top of a weekend full of God speaking
 to our church. So I thought this week I wanted to talk about preparing for revival because
 we have a stack of prophetic words at Grey's Innom. From years and years and years from
 you know the who's who the prophetic world, given us prophetic words over our region,
 over our city and over our church about a coming move of God, we feel like we're called
 to help host a move of God. And given that we've both lived in a revival culture, and
 you've been there from the start, I joined 10 years later, we have some experience of
 the kind of cultural shifts it takes that happen when God shows up. And I wanted you
 to, I wanted you to tell some stories, because I've noticed that as we've traveled, most
 people want revival, but they don't realize that they want it on their own terms. And
 When God does show up, it's usually not in the way that we were anticipating.
 I know that was the case for you.
 Talk to me.
 Well, for people who are not familiar, in January of 1994, the Holy Spirit visited the
 church we used to be a part of in Toronto.
 Basically, it did a worldwide revival out of that church.
 It was a little church of maybe 250 people.
 The Holy Spirit showed up, decimated the place in the best possible way.
 You would think, oh, that sounds amazing.
 But talk to me, AJ, tell us about what your first experience was like when the Holy Spirit showed up.
 Well, I was away when it started because I was on my outreach phase of being with YWAM.
 So I think I got back like a week later or something and I was really unhappy.
 I wasn't happy.
 Because it just looked crazy to me.
 guess I never thought about what would revival look like and I certainly didn't think it would
 look like this. And so, you know, there's just people laughing everywhere and, you know,
 you'd look through the room and you'd see some people sitting in their seats and then
 other times you'd just see feet in the air and, you know, it just wasn't, it wasn't what
 I thought church was supposed to look like. And I, because I didn't understand it, I became
 offended.
 Okay. I remember you telling me once, you know, when it first happened, you were like,
 "Oh God, this means I need to find a new church."
  </li><li>That's exactly what I thought.
 I was mourning, literally mourning.
 I mean, my heart was so sad thinking,
 "Wow, they've all lost it, and I have to find a new church,
 "and I'm so desperately sad about this."
  </li><li>So what changed your mind for wanting to leave a church,
 being freaked out about what God was doing
 to obviously staying and then traveling on behalf of
 and in your own part,
 representing that move all over the world?
 Well, the night that my YWAM team came to do Toymaker in Sun,
 it was shortly after the revival had started in--
 What does Toymaker in Sun--
 Toymaker in Sun is an evangelistic outreach play
 that YWAM teams do.
 So it had already been arranged that our team was going
 to come to our church.
 What, like weeks before or something?
 Months before, yeah.
 So it's kind of like surprise you're
 going to do a play, but revival's here.
 Yeah, and so, you know, I had heard things were going crazy at church.
 And so I kind of tried to warn them on the bus, but I was a little concerned.
 Like I'm like, Oh, I hear there's like lots of laughing could be kind of odd.
 You know, and so we get there and we do, you know, toy maker and son.
 And sure enough, there's, you know, there's definitely people that are paying attention,
 but there was definitely people that were just away with God somewhere.
 But at the time I wouldn't have said it was away with God.
 I would have just said, this is craziness.
 because they were doing what help us understand.
  </li><li>Oh, laughing, falling out of their chairs,
 rolling around on the floor.
 Like, here, just like, wow, I'm giving this my guts.
 You know, I'm giving my guts into this plane.
 You're laughing and rolling around the floor.
 I don't know how to process this.
 And anyway, so we finished the play
 and they had all of us sit across the back of this stage
 and Brian West got up, he was hosting the meeting
 and he just said, "Hey, should we pray for them?"
 And everybody's like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
 And I'm thinking, "Oh, no, this is gonna be so bad."
 And I'm wondering who they're gonna pick.
  </li><li>Go with faith. - I know, right?
 And I'm wondering who they're gonna pick.
 And the whole time I'm sitting there, I'm thinking,
 that's when I started thinking,
 "I have to find a new church.
 I can't even believe this.
 I love this place."
 But they've gone crazy in the five months
 that I went to YWAM, you know?
 And so I'm sitting there morning when Brian says,
 let's have the person who plays Satan come up here.
 Well, that was me.
 And so it went up and he said,
 can we pray for you?
 And I said, yeah, sure you can.
 I says, me, Brian, it's AJ.
 And he's like, oh, hi, AJ.
 And he's like, can we pray for you?
 And I said, sure, but I'm not gonna fall over.
 And he goes, I don't care if you fall over, which is true.
 He didn't, but I didn't believe him.
 So I said, yeah, sure you don't.
 'Cause you thought the point of this was
 that people would fall over.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then everybody would laugh.
  </li><li>It's amazing how many people thought
 that was the sum total of revival.
  </li><li>That's the goal, just get the people on the floor.
 So, which actually would explain a lot of other things,
 but anyway, moving right along.
 So, yeah, so we, they prayed for me and,
 I don't even know if Brian touched me,
 but I hit the floor.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then I stood right back up, looked at him and said,
 "You pushed me."
 And he goes, "No, I didn't."
 And I was like, "Guess you did you push me?"
 And I looked at John and Carol and they're like,
 "No, I'm going no."
 And he's like, "You look a little distressed.
 "Can I just pray for you again?"
 I said, "Sure you can, but step back."
 So he stepped back like a meter.
 (laughing)
 And he just stretched his hand towards me,
 didn't touch me at all.
 boom, I hit the floor again.
 Well, this time I tried to get back up
 and my legs wouldn't work.
 So my legs were like stuck to the floor.
 So I sat back up and I said, you pushed me.
 And of course the whole crowd is like,
 nobody touched you, you know whatever.
 And I'm like somebody pushed me.
 And he prayed for me again and I fell over.
 And this time I got stuck to the floor.
 Like all I could move was my eyeballs.
 I couldn't move anything.
  </li><li>What do you mean?
  </li><li>So your whole body is--
  </li><li>It was like I was Velcroed to the floor.
 like I was, I don't know, paralyzed or something
 stuck to the floor.
 I couldn't move anything except I could look around
 with my eyes.
  </li><li>Now the most obvious question to ask at this point is,
 why would God stick anyone to the floor?
  </li><li>Right, why would he?
  </li><li>So I'm lying there on the floor and I'm bawling.
 I mean, I just start bawling.
 I mean, I'm grieving for this church.
 I've got to leave.
 I'm grieving, you know, that I'm gonna not be
 in the same church as John and Carol anymore
 'cause they were such healing people for me.
 And I was just like, Lord, this is horrible.
  </li><li>And welcome to a move of God people.
  </li><li>Right.
 And yeah, so anyway, I just said at one point
 after I'd cried and lamented, I said, you know,
 Lord, I just need to know if this is you.
 And the only thing the Lord said to me is,
 well, have you stuck yourself to the floor?
 And I was like, no.
 the Lord in his question.
  </li><li>And I just started crying again like,
 (laughs)
 And a few minutes later,
 Carol got out of her seat,
 even though like the meeting,
 the service was still going on
 and somebody was speaking and whatever,
 but Carol got out of her seat
 and she came over and she just got really close to my face
 and she said, "AJ, I hear the Lord saying,
 "You need to choose who's gonna be in control of your life,
 "you or God."
 And that she went and sat back down in her seat
 And I realized that's what this is.
 There's a struggle for control over my life.
 You know, and I want to win.
  </li><li>It's all that God wants to win control is
 almost like he thinks he's God.
  </li><li>You know, so I'd love to say at that very instant
 I made a decision to give God control,
 but I had so many questions, concerns.
 I still had serious trust issues.
 You know, even with God that God was working through
 my life and so I would say it was probably
 another two hours before I finally,
 and I was stuck the whole time.
 Like, you know, if somebody had fallen over on me,
 I would have been toast 'cause I could not move.
  </li><li>The moment Heidi came to her church,
 she was stuck to the floor for seven days and seven nights.
  </li><li>Yeah, we had to peel her off the floor
 into a wheelchair.
 There was somebody assigned to help her with everything.
  </li><li>But again, you would ask, you know,
 why would God do that?
 Maybe we can do a whole episode on manifestations.
 But as you're speaking, I was thinking about Ephesians 3.20, where Paul writes, you know,
 now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than we can ask or imagine.
 It's surprising to me that people think that God's going to operate within their confines
 of their imagination when he explicitly says in Scripture, he's going to do more than they
 can imagine.
 So, my favorite quote I think of this whole topic is when John Arne, you know, in the
 first couple of weeks, you said, God, I don't understand why you like people falling over.
 Like, I don't understand.
 I don't understand what's going on.
 And the Lord said to him, John, you don't understand women.
 What makes you think you'll understand me?
 To Shay Lord.
 The requirement for humility and child likeness is, I think, probably the most
 important thing in navigating through when God shows up.
 Because otherwise you can think you know what you're doing.
 And time and time again, Miss God.
 Remember when we were in Iceland?
 And you know, remember I was speaking?
 And there's a guy behind me just shouting the same thing
 over and over again.
  </li><li>Something in Icelandic, of course.
 We don't know what he's saying.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't know what he was saying,
 but for me, he was a total distraction
 because I could see the whole crowd
 were looking at him and not listening to me.
 And I had a great sermon and my nose was all out of joint
 and why isn't he honoring the word of God?
 And you know, it actually has nothing to do with that.
 I'm just frustrated, but you know,
 we love to spiritualize things when we're upset.
 So Alan signaling me to try and get me to go like quiet the guy down.
 No, sure.
 And I feel like the Lord saying, don't touch it.
 Like just this is so spiritual.
 And so afterwards we find out what he's saying in Icelandic.
 He's saying, it feels amazing.
 It feels amazing.
 Come to realize the whole time that I've been speaking, the Holy Spirit has been
 touching him and he's being transformed is somebody who just struggled with suicide
  </li><li>And with depression for years. - Depression for years.
  </li><li>And mental health issues.
 And God is touching on me in there.
 The very reason we want people
 that meetings is to encounter God.
 And we actually get upset with him when he does it
 because it's gone straight to the way we wanna do our meeting.
  </li><li>And do you remember a few months later,
 we went back over to do a leader school of ministry there.
 And he was on the leader school.
 And he looked so different
 that we actually didn't recognize him.
 Like we argued with our friends
 that we had never met him before.
 and then they were like, "Yes, you have.
 You prayed for him."
 We're like, "No, we've never seen this man before."
 And they were like, "He's the guy that was lying on this."
 I mean, he looked night and day different.
  </li><li>I just, I think probably one of my favorite stories
 about what happened that night.
 So if you rewind the clock, it's January 20th, 1994.
 And the Holy Spirit has hit this little church
 at the end of a runway.
 Next to the main auditorium
 where the Holy Spirit is breaking out,
 is a little Bible study that Mary Audrey Raycroft,
 Raycroft, one of her pastors is running
 and she hears all this commotion.
 And so she opens the doors to see what's happening
 and she cannot see anybody.
 And her first thought is, we're all the people.
 And then as she continues to hear the laughter,
 she realizes all of the people,
 this whole room full of people are on the floor.
 And she says she was about to say something akin to,
 what is this?
 This can't be God.
 Why these she was about to not curse it with a capital C, but you know, criticize it and the
 Lord struck her dumb. And she later commented that that was the kindness of God, that in his mercy,
 he shut her mouth before he before she could criticize what he was doing. Yeah. And I, you know,
 I just love that. I love that nature of God. And it's it's something that I think we all have to be
 careful of because revival is messy. It's really, really messy.
 What's that verse in Proverbs about the oxen? Proverbs 14, verse
 four, where there are no oxen, the manger is empty, but from the
 strength of an ox come abundant harvests. So you can actually
 either have neat and tidy mangers, wherever things clean,
 and there's no mass, or you can have abundant harvests.
 But with abundant harvest--
  </li><li>Doesn't seem like we can have both.
  </li><li>Yeah, comes the mass.
 And so I think, I remember we were in New Zealand ministering
 and I got up to speak and I was so drunk in the Holy Spirit
 that I didn't know what to do.
 And that's when the Holy Spirit said,
 "You know, Alan, everybody wants revival."
 But you know, they questioned it when it shows up.
 Because of course it didn't look great.
 I'm staggering on the front.
 I can't stand up straight.
 But I think I remember calling it some words of knowledge
 and some people got healed.
 And then we transitioned in a time of ministry.
 And some people left.
 And afterwards, I was speaking to the senior pastor.
 And I think it was the associate pastor
 that had walked out the meeting furious.
 And I said, well, I'm so sorry.
 I don't know why I did top seven.
 I'd be happy to apologize and meet with him.
 And he said, well, he's upset because in scripture,
 It says that signs and wonders follow the preaching of the word.
 And I was like, and he's upset because we had signs of wonders before the
 preaching of the word.
 And it's amazing how all of us, myself included, can just get our
 nickers in a twist.
 Yeah, our ducks in a row get moved around because God's God and, you know,
 he loves to move.
 Somebody touched my ducks.
 So I was just thinking about, you know, the, the word that we got, like over my
 and plus the plethora of words that we've got over Nashville and over Grey Center.
 And just thinking about what does it look like for us to prepare for a move of God?
 What does it look like for us to prepare for revival?
 And I think it's probably just a reminder that we just stay humble and childlike
 and realize that he's God and we're not.
 Yeah, I think that was the thing to go back to my being stuck to the floor.
 Um, you know, before I got unstuck, the thing that the Lord was really clear with me about
 is say I wasn't supposed to leave the church.
 I was supposed to stay and be to be careful not to judge that there would be stuff that
 I didn't understand.
 Cause that's what, what my main difficulty was.
 I mean, I just didn't understand why God was choosing to do the things he was choosing
 to do in different people.
 And, you know, some of it looked really crazy.
 And, uh, he just said, don't judge it.
 Just, you know, just don't judge it.
 And when I finally sort of got to the place of, "Okay, Lord, I choose you to be in control
 and I'll stay here and I need your help in choosing not to judge."
 Then I was instantly released from the floor.
 I could move everything again and it wasn't like a slow process.
 But I mean, I was probably stuck to it for two and a half or three hours before I finally
 made that decision.
 I think that's it.
 I mean, we think we understand God and that's silly in itself, you know, to think that we
 could comprehend somebody so large and wonderful and understand how he's going to do things.
 I think really we want to be able to keep in that childlike place so that, you know,
 we can receive him how he comes and get the blessing of that rather than trying to figure
 him out.
 I think the tragedy would be that we'd spend years praying for the Lord to show up and then when he did, not want it.
 Yeah.
 Which sounds crazy, but you remember in the Gospels, Jesus heals the demoniac, when we cast out the demons and it goes into the pigs of 500 people.
 It says in one of the Gospels that when the village people came and they saw the demoniacs sitting in the right in his right mind, they begged Jesus to leave their region.
 And you know we've got contemporary stories of that we have a friend who has a very large church that when the Holy Spirit hit the church prominent businessman met him and try to bribe him with hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash to say literally in a brown paper bag.
 Make this go away and our friend is a pastor's like but this is God and he's like yeah I know but let God mess up somebody else's church.
 So, you know, even in hearing a story like that, you can be horrified, but you got to
 be careful not to judge because Lord, I don't want to miss you when you show up.
 I want to be there cheering and I realize that probably my schedule has to change.
 All right.
 Well, that's that for this week planning to think about.
 If you visit their blog, if you have subscribed to our podcast and you're listening to this
 in iTunes. If you subscribe to our podcast before last week, wondering if you could do
 us a favor, there's some instructions on our website at allanhaj.com. But basically, it
 would really help us if you would unsubscribe from our podcast, I know that sounds crazy,
 and then resubscribe to that podcast. It just means this is a one time thing that you have
 to do because of a mistake that I made. But by refreshing the feed, it just ensures that
 you get the most up to date feed, and it would just help us with all the behind the
 scenes stuff. Hope you have an incredible week. And we will see you next week. Well, we won't see you, but we will be there will be in your ears. Yes. Right there. There's creepy thought in your ears. All right. See ya. Bye.
