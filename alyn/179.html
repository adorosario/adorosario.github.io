<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one 79 of keeping up with the jones is this week we're going to be talking all about hope.
 But first a j jones how the heck are you.
 I'm good.<br/>
 How are you doing?<br/>
 I am.<br/>
 I am somewhat full with not very good Thai food and the other full with really good chocolate.
 Are they called pirouettes?<br/>
 They are called pirouettes.<br/>
 I used to pretend I was smoking cigarettes with them as a child.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, they're yes.<br/>
 That was a very emphatic.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, I remember you saying that when we the first time I ever saw them, you said, I remember these.
 I used to pretend I was smoking with them as a child.
 See, that was the insights to my childhood.
 So there you go.<br/>
 You were just just rebelling there with little rolled pastries growing up in the
 brotherhood and Dundee.<br/>
 The brotherhood.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Tell me about this week.<br/>
 Um, it was, it was a great week.<br/>
 Uh, I taught on Romans.<br/>
 You did verse by verse, verse by verse through the book of Romans.
 Well, you didn't get through the whole book.
 No, we got through about halfway through chapter eight.
 So tomorrow we finished chapter eight and go all the way to the end of 16.
 In four sessions.<br/>
 Dear Jesus, please help me.<br/>
 It's, it's quite the crazy pace.<br/>
 You were first students because you taught them first by first the Romans in the morning.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then I taught them how to read the gospels in the afternoon.
 Yes.<br/>
 By the time I got them in the afternoon, I had to show mercy to them because they were just,
 they were all bibled out.<br/>
 They were like, Oh, I'm being beaten with something.
 Yeah.<br/>
 We need to look at that next year and not put those two weeks back to back.
 Yes.<br/>
 I might next week do like interpretive dance or you could show them your famous move.
 Oh, Lord, have you seen my hamster?<br/>
 Hey, I don't like talking about that because it makes it.
 I mean, I use that joke a lot.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 But the downside of that is it makes it sound like I don't have a value on
 prophetic dance and I actually have a high value on prophetic dance.
 So do I.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Because our dance team part of our worship and creative arts department
 kill it.<br/>
 Like when they are when our dancers are not on stage, it feels like we're
 missing a subwoofer or a tweeter or it feels like a component of the worship
 team is missing.<br/>
 I honestly feel like our prophetic dancers are like a can opener in the spirit.
 Like they when they get out there, something shifts fast.
 We had a pregnant prophetic dancer two weeks ago, which that doesn't look like the greatest
 combination, but it was an amazing combination.
 Well, she's such a beautiful dancer and she stayed so graceful even though she's, you
 know, 30 something weeks pregnant.<br/>
 So what do you go, Sonia?<br/>
 Amazing.<br/>
 So Romans, the gospels, our dear friend,
 co-pastor and colleague, Michelle Vouter was teaching
 in first year on the power of the cross.
</p><ul>
  <li>And she killed it.
  </li><li>I wept, I was in for her first session,
 I was in tears and had to leave.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah, wow.
  </li><li>Well, I didn't have to leave,
 I had a meeting to go to, but I was crying
 as I went to my meeting.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, the feedback's been fantastic.
 So, super proud of Michelle.
  </li><li>Come on.
 And then Monday night, oh, I kicked off the year.
 You did.
 I kicked off the year emanate with a message I deliberately spoke.
 But I would, I met lots of first time visitors and they're like, oh, it was my
 first time here.
 And I was kind of like, I'm so sorry.
 That was a really hard message because it was a message all about personal
 responsibility.
 I loved it.
 But I hope people understand that the messages I preach were first
 preached to me by the Lord.
 Right.
 Like I said, something you've had to own and walk through.
 And yeah.
 Yeah.
 I just pass on the challenge and the discomfort.
 He gives it to me and I multiply it.
  </li><li>Your special gift.
  </li><li>Tell me about Wednesday night
 because our kids' classes started up.
  </li><li>They did.
  </li><li>Our kids are desperate to go to church.
  </li><li>Yes, well, kids' clubs are on Wednesday night
 and so all of the different age kids
 have different types of clubs that they can sign up for.
 And so there was percussion club and my goodness,
 it was so loud with the door shut.
 I was like, I don't know who they got to go in there.
 But there was a million, mostly boys,
 very smelly playing drums.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Don't refer to them as very smelly.
  </li><li>Well, this smell coming from the room was pretty mungent.
  </li><li>Oh my God.
  </li><li>They were like, the children's ministry had two of those,
 like vaporizer things that you put oils in
 to try and combat the smell coming from the sweaty boys
 bongo room. So, um, and then-
  </li><li>Swipe boys, bongo room.
  </li><li>And then there's-
  </li><li>Oh, wow.
  </li><li>And then there was like songwriting and stuff,
 which is what Abby went into.
 She's bringing her ukulele this Wednesday.
 So she's super excited because Ryan told her
 if she learned these two chords,
 she could bring her ukulele and she'd be able to play along.
  </li><li>Yeah, we bought her daughter a ukulele for her Christmas.
  </li><li>Yes. And she loves it.
 She was upstairs playing it for ages today.
  </li><li>Who's the deal with that?
  </li><li>Mine.
 Mummy when it's not loud.
 I think the wind is yet to be determined.
 We'll see. We'll see. But she loves it.
 Good.
 And then there's a baking class.
 And we have this tiny kitchen at the back of the main building.
 And there was 20 little girls in there
 with the instructor and a couple helpers.
 20.
 Baking?
 and decorating cupcakes and things.
 Well, they came home super excited.
 They were so excited.
 Yeah.
 So yeah, that was awesome.
 And I sat in my office and I brought the switch with me.
 So I sat in my office and tried to play switch for a little bit.
 I ended up having some conversations with the people so I didn't get to play
 from longer than about 10 or 15 minutes.
 People are like that.
 They get in the way of a good Zelda game.
 Like what the heck, people?
 If I've got a switch and I've got headphones and do not disturb,
 It's the universal sign of nerd lost in high road.
 I even had my door closed and locked, but you know, some people, they have keys.
 That's why you take the switch drive to remote car.
 That's how you know you're an addict, right?
 When you like drive away in the back, shut up all the lights and just the only thing
 that can see is the blue glow of the switch player in the back of the parking lot.
 Yeah.
 I was obviously having advanced to to addict.
 We had some adventures this weekend because we had, well, it wasn't a snow day.
 I don't want to mark it and say it was a snow day.
 It was a freezing rain day.
 School got canceled Friday.
 Yes.
 I stay.
 Yeah, because it was literally freezing rain and then I said, true enough, it was.
 We woke up in the morning and we had icicles hanging off the car and off the back porch,
 which meant Friday we stayed in our pajamas.
 Actually, Friday and Saturday we stayed in our pajamas and yep.
 It was like a remake of our vacation.
 Vacation.
 Our kids loved it. We got lots of cuddles, lots of cuddles, lots of Zelda, lots of playing.
 It was glorious, lots of food.
 And then Saturday, we interspersed Zelda with tidying because today, Sunday, when we record
 this, we had all our small group of visitors back for lunch and we want people to eat in a
 sanitary environment. So we thought we'd actually tidy up. Yes, our house was destroyed.
 And then Sunday this morning jeff has been on a on a series on hope which is inspired us to chon hope which will do shortly but tonight we're actually just back in from celebrating our wedding anniversary.
 Should we do celebrating in quotation marks because it was kind of like a it was entertaining it was a comedy of errors yes basically.
 I was really excited because i was gonna take you to this really nice state restaurant yes and i had a gift voucher and everything you'd organize babysitters.
 Yes, and we'd never been to this one before and we tend to always go to the same places.
 So old steakhouse in Nashville. Super excited. Very excited.
 Looking at directions of how you get there, closed on a Sunday. So no problem. We want a detour.
 We're up in Nashville anyway. And so you're like, oh, this is great Vietnamese place. Now,
 usually the word great in Vietnamese, when they go together, truly, you're trying to find a hole
 in the wall and yes, find a hole in the wall.
 Yes, yes.
 And I'd previously been there about six or seven years ago and it still looked exactly
 the same.
 I'm pretty sure the sign is a little more faded, but it's the same place.
 I took a picture of the sign faded.
 By this time I was excited because I'm fairly picky and by fairly, I mean really picky
 about the restaurants I eat at.
 But for whatever reason, I don't mind a hole in the wall if it's amazing food.
 Right.
 to go to what looked like your archetypal hole in the wall.
 However, we walk up and open the door and it says right on it, they only take cash or
 checks.
 And we have neither.
 We didn't have neither.
 So we were like, okay, all right, no problem.
 Third time's a charm, we'll go somewhere else.
 The third restaurant we navigate our way to, we miss the turn, but it doesn't matter.
 You know, it rewrites us.
 And then rewrites us to another restaurant with the same name.
 By the time we pull up there, it was closed even though I said it was open.
 Yeah, we tried to go to Vueys, which is one of our favorite Vietnamese restaurants, but it was closed.
 And now we were just ready to go home and call it a night, but we had a craving for Thai food.
 So on our fourth attempt, we end up at what is easily the sketchiest restaurant.
 I think I've ever stopped at, which I didn't mind.
 Right. We're like, "Okay, hold on the wall. Maybe it'll be good."
 Well, they often are.
 Right. Except that it was more like trailer in a parking lot. Maybe it'll be good.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It was kinda scary, I'm like, oh my God, I'm like, wow.
  </li><li>The car part was full, which is a good sign.
  </li><li>Yes, and lots of people had told me before,
 like when I have said things like,
 I just miss having really good tie,
 'cause we had a favorite tie restaurant in Toronto
 that I just really miss, and they're like,
 "Have you tried this place?"
 And so I was sort of like,
 "Okay, well I'm game, because this is the place
 "everybody says, 'Have you tried,' and it's so great."
  </li><li>It wasn't that great. - It wasn't.
 But to be fair, we could have got there on a rough night,
 on a bum night, but whatever.
 We had a good evening.
  </li><li>We had, well, we had an adventure, didn't we?
 And we saw lots of Nashville.
  </li><li>And adventure is as good as a good evening, as they say.
 But we did get ourselves his and hers matching gifts
 for our wedding anniversary.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>Would you like to tell the fine people?
  </li><li>Well, we got, I got Alan Amiibo,
 and he got me an amiibo for our anniversary.
  </li><li>I got Ajay Princess Zelda
 and she got me the 8-bit link for those of you who care.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Do you think Zelda's taking over our life?
  </li><li>Maybe.
  </li><li>Just a little bit.
  </li><li>Yeah, just a little bit.
 You know, I think what I like the most about Zelda
 is for however long I play it that day,
 which I didn't play it today,
 but if I were, you know, whatever,
 I played it for like 45 minutes or an hour last night.
 I don't think about anything else.
 I just have fun and I de-stress.
 You can actually switch off.
 Yeah, I switch off.
 And we also bought ourselves a guidebook so that we can 100% completely game
 like proper because we need to find all this stuff.
 Very good.
 And there's stuff everywhere.
 So yeah.
 All right.
 Our main topic for this week.
 Yes.
 Take it away.
 AJ Jones.
 Well, I've been thinking about how, um, just been talking about hope and, you
 We were on year two, as I said, going through Romans and just sort of thinking about, okay,
 well, there's so much about hope in Romans.
 And then he started with this verse this morning.
 And that is Romans 5 verse 5, it says, "And hope does not disappoint because the love of
 God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us."
 And I think it's interesting, like when you read through Romans, you read through Ephesians
 or many of the Epistles, you're reading the letters of encouragement from a man who's
 currently in prison.
 So Romans is actually written while Paul is in prison in Judea.
 He hasn't been to the church in Rome, but he is the apostle for that church or over that
 church.
 his heart is to go to the church in Rome. And until he can get there, he writes the letter
 to the Romans. And so you have to think, here's a guy who's imprisoned. So that seems dark and,
 you know, discouraging and whatnot, who actually is encouraging others to hope no matter what
 their circumstances are, which is just, it's kind of cool, you know. But I love Romans. It's such a
 a great book. And actually I was thinking, maybe I'd start from
 verse one and just read the first five verses.
 Go from
 So it says therefore, having been justified by faith, we have
 peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Now here's
 interesting thing. Justified. I have a note in my Bible,
 justified means just as if I had never sinned. So therefore,
 Having been made absolutely clean by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
 through whom also we have obtained our introduction by faith into this grace in which we stand,
 and we exalt in hope of the glory of God. And not only this, but we also exalt in our tribulations,
 knowing that tribulations bring about perseverance and some translations that word tribulations is sufferings and it means
 pressures
 you know outside pressures or
 places of discouragement, so
 It's not only this but we also exalt in our
 Discouragement or in the pressures that we're in knowing that these tribulations or pressures
 bring about perseverance and perseverance proven character and proven character hope and hope does
 not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit
 who was given to us. And Jeff was talking this morning about how it seems like those are kind
 of stepping stones. We start out in a place known as tribulation or pressure or suffering or whatever
 the thing is that we're going through. And actually from that place, what God brings about
 is perseverance, the ability to stick it through regardless of what the circumstances are, regardless
 of even if we want to give up, right? It's the ability to just keep going and keep pressing on.
 And what that produces is character. And it says proven character in the NASB.
 These are not the happy stepping stones of the New Testament.
 You're really not and you don't necessarily associate tribulation and perseverance and
 character with hope, but those are the three things that happen before hope actually starts
 to grow.
 I think it's funny because sometimes I think hope is just a gift.
 We supernaturally receive this faith and hope, but sometimes hope grows.
 Hope grows because we don't let go of God and we know that Scripture says we're going
 to make it. And so we just decide we're going to make it and the Lord actually solidifies
 something in us. So hope has a place to grow. So that was sort of, you know, what Jeff was
 talking about this morning. And I sort of, he had referenced it last week. There's that
 verse that people quote all the time, which I think is Proverbs 1312, where it says,
 "Hope deferred makes the heart sick." And I remember when I was in, well, it was after
 my first husband had left and people would come up to me and I just think it's a strange
 verse to use to encourage anybody but they would come up and go, "Oh, A.J. I'm really
 sorry. Hope deferred makes the heart sick." And I didn't realize there was a second part
 to that verse, you know, because it just got quoted at me so many times and I thought,
 "Gosh, that's just not encouraging at all." You know, but the rest of the verse is but
 a longing fulfilled is a tree of life. Like, yeah, we're going to have seasons where it's
 difficult and it feels like hope is evaporating. But actually, when we persevere, when we hang
 on to God, we will see what we hope for.
 It seems like if you squish both proverbs and Romans together, the way to a longing fulfilled
 is patient endurance through the tribulations to form a character so you get hope.
 Yeah.
 So you return to hope again.
 Yeah.
 And, you know, Jeff, Jeff did a great job of unpacking that last couple of weeks. It was
 It's turned out that the importance of just even standing and after everything stand,
 you know, to stand.
 Yeah.
 Talk to me about some of the events in your life where you can see those four steps going
 in life.
 Well, I was thinking about like the whole thing of perseverance, you know, of suffering
 and perseverance.
 And, you know, we were talking in the car.
 I was thinking about when we were trying to get pregnant with Abby.
 You know, it took 10 months and 10 months may feel like, oh, that's a really short period
 of time.
 But when every single month you're hoping, hoping, hoping, hoping and then, uh, and
 10 months is a short time after 10 months is over.
 Right.
 But when you're in the 10 months, you don't know it's going to be 10 months.
 Yeah.
 And when you're in the 10 months and during that 10 months, 14 of your friends get pregnant
 and you don't, it also feels a little bit like God might be laughing at you.
 You know, it was, it was intense.
 I felt intense things.
 And there's the choice to decide that God doesn't care about you and go down that route
 and partner with everything that the enemy wants you to pick up wholesale or to actually
 persevere in faith and go, "You know what, God, you've said.
 I really feel like you've said I'm going to have kids.
 I really think this is what you want for us and okay, it's 10 months and this is really
 painful, but somehow everything is going to line up in my life with the kindness of God.
 You revisited that, of course, with MJ.
 Yeah.
 And MJ was much longer.
 So to get pregnant with MJ, it took us two and a half years.
 And we miscarried in there.
 There was stuff.
 And it was really hard.
 I was going for hormone tests and my hormones were all over the map.
 It was just like on many levels, it was just really, really difficult.
 We really wanted to have one more child.
 I really felt that the Lord had said we would have a son and then we got this prophetic word
 about having a son.
 Actually, that's probably when hope started coming back.
 We got this word from David Wagner.
 He was praying for us and he was sort of being cagey.
 He wasn't really saying what he was saying, but he was like, you know,
 he was really, he was honoring the guy like the guy.
 He was honoring the guy like he was not prophesying children,
 but they have like four or five sons.
 And when he was done, we said, would you pray for us?
 We really want to have a son.
 And he said, well, I wasn't going to say anything, but that's what I saw.
 And he said, by this time next year, you'll be holding your son.
 And that was December 4th.
 And so I was like, oh, wow.
 And literally--
 Immediately you did math.
 Immediately I started doing math, of course it did,
 'cause that's what I do, I'm a planner.
 But I was like, oh, you know, oh, okay.
 I now have the ability or whatever permission to hope again.
 And so I remember in February sort of doing the math
 and going, gosh, it's gotta happen this month.
 Or David's word doesn't come true
 without it being preemie and I don't want another preemie
 'cause I've had to.
  </li><li>And I was just like, speak Lord, you're serving here.
  </li><li>You were like, if I must, I must.
  </li><li>I will fulfill my mandate.
  </li><li>And we did, we got pregnant that night.
 But it was two and a half years of disappointment.
  </li><li>Two and a half years, I mean, I was about to make a joke
 and I'm not trying to build it 'til two and a half years
 at all, but I was thinking about Abraham.
 You know, Jeff is speaking about Abraham this morning.
 He too had a prophetic word, but it's okay.
 What?
 25 years to see the fruition of that.
 Yeah.
 I, I've, I've, maybe it's because I'm getting older, but I've come to really, really
 appreciate the long, the long game with the Lord that a lot of the promises he's giving us.
 I think we try and interpret in the immediate, but often they're like long range words.
 Yeah.
 And the thing I love about the prophetic, I remember Isabelle Allam teaching us this, she said, you know, often prophetic words are like a cup of.
 Water at the side of a long marathon where you grab it, it refreshes you and it keeps you going and I think that's been the case.
 I think the power of the prophetic to instill hope in her hearts is amazing, but it doesn't excuse us from the from the additional steps.
 of perseverance and of character building and managing your heart when you don't understand what's going on right that's all part of perseverance.
 Is it it's like okay i'm in the midst of something i don't understand i'm in the midst of something that feels like pressure that feels painful to me.
 I'm but i'm in a man to my heart i'm going to choose to trust god i keep pushing forward and i stand firm like you referenced earlier you know that's from a fusions again you're back to Paul writing from prison.
 these letters to encourage these people that are not in prison and saying things like,
 "Hey, stand for him there. Hey, learn to hope."
 You see, energize our apostle, isn't he?
 Amazing.
 I mean, he's just constant influence, full of joy from the most unlikely of sources.
 Yes.
 I think we were talking about this in the car on the way back from our date,
 and we were talking about what he went to in the podcast, Yariada.
 We were talking about what examples do we have of joy that's come out of perseverance,
 has come out of character being formed. And you were talking to me about something I was just
 thinking about, which is my relationship with the Lord. Like today, I think it's incredible
 that no word of a lie, I hear God's voice as often as I choose to listen for it,
 which is a remarkable claim. But some 20, 25 years ago, I was desperate to hear God's voice,
 didn't even know if I could, didn't know if I was qualified, and yet began on this journey of
 study and of understanding and of of just thinking, is this even possible? Is this for today?
 Gripturally, it available for God to speak to people because I was raised in an environment
 where the only way God spoke was through the scriptures. I have a huge value for the scriptures,
 but I'm also, for example, I'd read about David going in before the Lord and
 Coringa, but the Lord and the Lord would just speak to him. And I would think, how is it under
 an inferior covenant? David got to speak to the Lord and the Lord would speak to him. And under
 the superior covenant, all I'm not being facetious here, all I get is a manual. And I was just
 desperate to understand does God speak? And it was a process of tribulation, of making horrible
 mistakes of making in my efforts to learn to walk falling down a lot, so to speak, of
 perseverance. I didn't know how to prophesy my way of a paper bag. I didn't know what was me,
 what was the devil, what was the Lord, if it was the Lord. I mean, I've got humorous stories of
 thinking I remember one night waking up and just thinking as I woke up and as my eyes
 blurly opened, I saw this perfect green ring of light just floating beside my bed.
 and I was like, "Lord, is that you? Father of lights? Is that an angel?" And I was like,
 "Oh, no, it's my laptop charging, and I'm not wearing my glasses."
 You know, I had all these things where I was just trying to learn. Every time I'd go to the bank,
 I would ask the Lord for the name of the person who was serving me. And I would always hear a name,
 but it was never the name of the person serving me. All these kind of errors. And just think,
 I don't know, is this even possible?
 And today, part of my job is teaching people how to prophesy,
 teaching people how to hear God's voice.
 And I have seen, I now have hope for other people.
 Yeah.
 It's there because I've done it.
 And I would often ask the Lord,
 because lots of my friends are prophets
 and they seem to just be born with that gift.
 And I was like, Lord, why is it?
 And I remember one day the Lord just saying,
 "Alan, because you didn't know how to do it,
 that you had to learn how to do it.
 And because you learn how to do it,
 you can now teach people how to do it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I was like, ah, great.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think anything that you've navigated through
 to the other side, you have hope and faith to offer
 for those who haven't made it yet, right?
  </li><li>Because why community is so vital.
  </li><li>Yeah, absolutely.
  </li><li>Being around people who are in a different,
 further along season of life than you,
 you can ride on their hope
 that it's going to be all okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like when you're just this morning,
 I was with Mike and Sissy Pfeiffer,
 who I just love their like grandparents in our church.
 And the two of them just came up on either side of me
 and they just put their hands on me
 and they were just, you know, they were holding my arms.
 They were just speaking life over me.
 And I was like, oh, I can just feel the hope coming from them
 because they've not only raised kids,
 they've raised grandkids.
 And just, you know, speaking life,
 and you just think, oh, we're in such an amazing church
 that is multi-generational.
  </li><li>Yeah. I was also thinking, babe,
 I'd love to, you know, with the understanding
 of what you've navigated through,
 you have hope and faith for others.
 You know, I was thinking about,
 you know, you're talking about the prophetic journey
 and I was talking about trying to get pregnant,
 but I would say probably my biggest place
 where I have done the journey of suffering
 and perseverance and, you know, character
 and then hope is through this whole inner healing journey.
  </li><li>Wow, yeah.
  </li><li>And I used to have this reoccurring visual of me sort of,
 I don't know how to explain it other than
 sort of like down like in a runner's pose,
 and then just trying to slowly push the darkness forward,
 not even being able to stand up,
 feeling so much pressure, so much sadness, so much pain,
 but just knowing if I can just get one step closer to the light
 as sooner or later, I'm going to break through.
 And I felt like that for years, really.
 Because of course, you were the person
 that everybody refused to make eye contact with a church
 in case they got drawn into the kind of never-ending cycle
 of despair.
 Yes.
 And I mean, I would say I had some days where I managed myself
 well, and I had other days where I just couldn't.
 I had no skills or energy to manage the amount of pain
 that I was in.
 And so, but it just felt like, oh gosh, am I ever going to be healed?
 Am I ever not going to feel this desperate?
 Am I ever not going to feel this lonely?
 Am I ever, am I ever?
 And it didn't help that you're professional counselors who are seeing at one point,
 she said, I don't think there's any help for you.
 Don't think you can be helped.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 They, yeah, they said we don't, we don't actually think that God can heal you.
 And I was like, wow, wow.
 Thanks for that.
 of confidence, you know? I was in shock. I was like, oh, maybe this is your job. Maybe I shouldn't
 talk to you anymore. And, you know, I went and got that prayed off. But, but it did, you know, it was
 years. It was years of the Lord dealing with this incredible pain that I had carried for so long.
 And it did feel like, is this ever going to really shift? Am I ever really not going to be defined by
 pain. And it's funny now because, you know, I remember maybe a year or two having a discussion
 with somebody who said, you know, I told your testimony to my mom and she said it can't
 possibly be true that you went through all that stuff because it doesn't show on you.
 And so it can't be true. And I said, could it not be true that God completely healed
 me? And she said, well, she doesn't think so. She doesn't think that ever happens. And
 And I thought, oh, I never did either.
 You know, like I totally get it.
 I just thought I'm always going to be defined
 by some level of pain.
 I'm always going to carry some level of disappointment.
 You know, and actually God is so good
 that when you look back, you realize the whole time
 he was peeling off layers.
 He was, you know, yeah, he was a refining character,
 but it wasn't like his master plan
 for bringing character in me was to put me through pain.
 You know, it was just, there was all the childhood pain.
 And he was like, hey, honey, if you'll keep walking towards me, I got this.
 You know, so my, my encouragement, our encouragement to you tonight would just be.
 Hey, hang on to hope and whatever you're in the middle of, whatever feels like it's
 a pressure for you.
 It's a struggle.
 Yeah, that's suffering.
 It is.
 It's suffering.
 Um, and if you can't hang on to hope, just stand, just stand refuse to retreat.
 What, you know, whether the storm push into the wind, baby, because goodness is coming.
 Yeah.
 Surely goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life.
 Even if it doesn't feel like it right behind you right now is mercy and goodness.
 Yeah.
 And he's great.
 He, he redeems everything.
 I love Joseph's line.
 Well, the enemy meant for bad or what you meant for bad God used for good.
 And your story still being written.
 Don't don't think you come to the end of the book.
 you're just at the end of the chapter.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the Lord is gonna turn the page
 and you're gonna see amazing things happen in your life.
 And what you're enduring right now will be part
 of your testimony to help move other people forward too.
  </li><li>Yeah, you'll be able to offer faith
 and help on the other side as a lifeline
 to help other people get through.
  </li><li>If you know somebody,
 that as you're listening to this, you're thinking,
 oh, they would be super encouraged by this.
 Why not do them a favor and forward them this episode
 for a bit of a hope injection in their life.
 And if there's things that we can be encouraging you with, please reach out to
 us on Twitter at Alan, A-L-Y-N-A-M-D-A-J.

 Do we have any listeners questions this week?
 We don't just have one.
 We have two.
 Ooh, the first one is from Michael.
 Yes.
 Michael.
 Brilliant question that we're asked fairly often.
 He asked this, something I'm often confused about is tithing.
 Do I tithe on my gross income or my net income?
 Is this the same if I own a business?
 I.e. should the business tithe on the gross income it earns
 or on the net income it earns?
 Great question, very common question.
 I was speaking to somebody about this the other day.
 I was having a conversation with them
 and I was relaying that I'd had this question
 and this person I was speaking to said,
 "Well, that depends.
 "Did God give you the gross income or the net income?"
 (laughing)
 That's a great question.
 All facetious questions and humorous questions aside.
 I think that the, the answer to that is you tithe on your gross income because
 that's what's given to you.
 And you may say, yeah, but I'm obligated to pay my taxes, but Jesus knew about that
 when he said, you know, give to Caesar with Caesar's and give to the Lord.
 What is the Lord's?
 So yeah, I tithe.
 We tithe on our gross income.
 It's the first thing that we do.
 Um, because you can never out give God, you're going to be surprised at what happens.
 Yeah. In terms of the second question, if you own a business, I personally, we have a small
 business that we have on the side. We do not tithe on everything that comes into the business. We
 tithe on what we take out of the business as our income, because the business that South needs to
 has all its own costs, et cetera, et cetera. Dave Ramsey actually once said he said,
 there's not actually a biblical mandate for businesses to tithe. So he says, in my business,
 we don't tithe. Obviously he does do charitable giving, but the salary that goes to the workers,
 he encourages them to tithe on that. Hopefully that helps, Michael. Hopefully that clears it up.
 Our second question comes from Sarah. She asks, "I'm just wondering if you have any kids'
 Bibles and/or devotional books that you recommend. I'm cautious about which ones I use with our
 little ones as some of them seem to present more of it just be a good boy or girl message
 or simplistic stories rather than the message about the gospel and the father's deep love for them.
 We really love the Jesus storybook Bible, but I've read through it many times and I'm looking for a few more to add to our collection.
 Thanks.
 Oh, rats, I was going to recommend the Jesus storybook Bible because I love it and I think it's, you know, it would suit well what you're talking about.
 Right, and I could love that too.
 Yeah, so good.
 Tia has her copy by her bed and doesn't let anybody take it because that's her favorite
 one to read.
 What's the DVDs that they watch?
 Is it Storybook?
 The CBN ones?
 Yeah.
 Is it Storybook?
 Yeah.
 We, there's some DVDs with a bunch of different Bible studies that are done by either TBN
 or the 700 Club, do you remember?
 I forget.
 the storybook. And they're about 20 minute little programs where basically there's a hero guy and
 he goes back into time and he sees, you know, how different, you know, different Bible stories. And
 then he learns the lesson of the Bible story and whatnot. They're they're really, really well done.
 Yep.
 A couple of them are a couple of them are a little scary, because they're like, you know, literally,
 They'll be about the Garden of Eden.
 You'll see Satan or, you know, stuff like that.
 So depends on the age of the kids, you know, and how, I would say probably how,
 how visuals affect them because some of our kids are dreamers and some of them are not.
 And so we've had to sort of figure that out, but they're really good.
 There's a great book for kids called a boy named Ben.
 Do you know anything about that?
 Well, that yes.
 I mean, that's not so much a course of Bible or anything like that.
 But just I did a book called a boy named Ben, which is a children's story I did about a
 friend of ours named Ben, who basically found out how good and how kind God is and went
 around and prayed for everybody who, you know, moved or breathed or, you know, whatnot.
 And so sort of talking about his adventure of learning that God is still speaking and
 learning that God is still healing and then what he did with that.
 If you want to have a look at the book, you can go to alanahj.com/ben and all the information
 is there for that.
 Yeah, there's a little bit about the story behind the book and there's a gallery of pictures
 so you can get an idea of what it's like.
 Bar kids have loved reading and hopefully it'll be an encouragement to your kids too.
 I'm trying to think of other good children's resources.
 I suppose it depends on the age of your kids.
 Our 10-year-old does have a legit Bible.
 It's not a kid's Bible.
 It's like a youth kind of Bible that she loves.
 And it has little study points in it and little facts
 and stuff like that.
 It is pink, so of course she loves it.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>But I just would, those are probably the main ones
 that I would think of.
 And I would start telling your kids your testimony.
 The kids love stories.
 So I was telling my kids the other day just about my story with the Lord and how I met the Lord and, you know, they, they loved it.
 Sorry, we don't have any other recommendations.
 Um, you know, if other parents have got recommendations, they want just send it into us or contact us via Twitter.
 And we'll, we'll read them out in, in, in future episodes.
 That's a great idea.
 Yeah.
 I'm feeling.
 I can get some new material.
 So they got hope, tithing.
 Children's literature.
 Oh, all of it.
 Bad Thai food.
 Love it.
