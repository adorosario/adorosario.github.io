<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 206 of Keeping Up with the Joneses where this week we're talking
 about the importance of forgiveness.<br/>
 I'm wondering why you would listen to a podcast episode on the importance of forgiveness.
 It's not like how to grow wealth or how to increase favor or how to grow your prophetic
 gift.<br/>
 Would you I mean, thank you for listening and you're probably listening because you listen every week
 But the importance of forgiveness is one of those amazing
 Truth that maybe people might not want to listen to because it doesn't sound appealing
 Yeah, it brings so much fruit in your life
 thoughts<br/>
 Yeah, I mean I actually think it's the best skill I ever learned
 Because actually you can't get free<br/>
 From anything that you have been through if you can't actually forgive
 And you're going to require the ability or the skill to be able to forgive on a regular basis.
 Like every single day, probably several times a day on little, you know, on little things and on big things.
 So I think it's actually super important and it's a great reminder of why we do it.
 So I'm really glad you're listening to this episode for those reasons before we unpack forgiveness.
 Let's catch up with our week.<br/>
 Again, it's kind of weird because we're recording this episode on a Friday morning.
 Instead of our usual Sunday night.<br/>
 Very true. The sun is streaming in through the windows.
 Which is strange because normally it's pitch black outside when we record.
 Yes.<br/>
 We're recording on a Friday because we're out of time this weekend and we realize,
 "We're not going to be near a studio Sunday night, so we'll record in advance."
 Talk to me about this week. There was an overshadowing event.
 Well, I shouldn't say overshadowing. There was an event that was filled with joy this week and it was...
 My birthday!<br/>
 -You got to celebrate. -It's your birthday.
 -It's your birthday. -Okay, please don't.
 -Yes, sorry. -Would you celebrate your birthday?
 Do you have a good one?<br/>
 -I did. I had a great birthday. So fun.
 I got to spend time with lots of different friends
 and, of course, as a gifts person, I got some lovely gifts
 and, yeah, it was perfect. Such a great week.
 -Including a really creepy helium-filled llama balloon.
 -It's not creepy. It's really cute. Okay.
 -You notice it's not there anymore?<br/>
 -What did you do to it?<br/>
 I stabbed it in the throat.<br/>
 Did you really?<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 I'll tell you why though.<br/>
 It wasn't yours to stab.<br/>
 It's my balloon.<br/>
 It was going to deflate anywhere.<br/>
 No, it wasn't.<br/>
 It stays up for weeks.<br/>
 You didn't really stab my balloon.<br/>
 What do you make you feel better if I said I didn't?
 Alan, you didn't even notice it was.<br/>
 It doesn't matter.<br/>
 It's my balloon.<br/>
 I'm just going to start randomly stabbing your things and I'll go,
 I didn't matter.<br/>
 You didn't even notice.<br/>
 Oh, you look for the next day and it was no too bad.
 I didn't notice the second I stabbed it.
 (laughs)
</p><ul>
  <li>Okay, let's talk about the importance
 of forgiving a showy.
  </li><li>We might need to right now.
 I'm not happy with you at all.
  </li><li>What was it that you were attached about the balloon?
  </li><li>It's a gift, darling.
 As a gift person, you don't kill somebody else's gift.
  </li><li>But you're a grown woman, why do you want balloon?
  </li><li>It doesn't matter.
 It was a cute balloon and I'm not happy with you.
  </li><li>The balloon gave me so much trauma.
 I woke up the day after your birthday
 And we wake up with our lights, our lights come on slowly.
 So my first point of consciousness, I kind of open my eyes.
 And because one of the lamps is behind the balloon,
 all I see is this giant silhouette of a creepy thing
 floating over my head.
 And it's your stupid llama.
  </li><li>I could have put it somewhere else.
  </li><li>And then every time-- - You don't have to stab it.
  </li><li>Well, every time I'd walk in the bedroom,
 I'd forget it's there, and it's floating at my head.
 I'm like, good, good lord.
 So I just stabbed it last night and dealt with it.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm not.
 No, not even remotely.
 I'm not going to be sorry when I stab your presence either.
 I didn't expect you to have such a visceral reaction.
 Why I put it in the room so that it didn't get destroyed by the kids.
 And instead my husband killed it.
 I don't understand what you would have done with it.
 Let's pretend I haven't stabbed it.
 And let's pretend you noticed I had.
 I would let the air out of the bottom of the valve.
 So we die slowly.
 I keep it to re-inflated at another time.
 -You're on the road. -Enjoy.
 -It doesn't matter. It was still mine.
 -Okay. -You shouldn't have dudged it.
 -Okay. I think it's funny that you haven't noticed
 it's been dead for a couple of days.
 -It hasn't been dead a couple of days.
 It was there yesterday.
 You killed it last night while I was out of the house.
 And then I came to bed and it was virtually dark in the room.
 I'm not surprised. I haven't noticed.
 -Oh, baby, you cracked me up so much.
 I love you, but I don't understand your time.
 -It's okay. You're not going to understand a few things
 in the future either.
 Go ahead. What else did you want to talk about this week since you've obliterated one of my gifts?
 Okay, now I'm scared.
 Be scared.
 Oh, oh, dear. Oh, dear.
 I don't even know where to go from there.
 Like what was the rest of the week?
 You had your birthday. Great. We're done.
 Yeah.
 We had your birthday and then you got arrested.
 All right. Perfect.
 And then he got taken away.
 Hey, I, we ate at the, well, you didn't, but I did.
 with us some girls ate at the True Food Kitchen, which is now one of my new favorite restaurants
 in Nashville.
 What's good about it?
 It is all sort of super healthy-ish food, like, you know, Josh and Chelsea.
 They're kind of healthy.
 But I love Josh and Chelsea, but they're not the benchmark for good tasting food for me.
 Well, good.
 No, but they're the benchmark for good healthy food.
 And what I'm saying is it tastes great.
 Okay.
 It's not only healthy, but it tastes great.
  </li><li>Really? - Yeah.
  </li><li>What did you eat?
  </li><li>I had the teriyaki chicken and quinoa bowl,
 and it has a bunch of vegetables in it and a sauce,
 and it's so good.
 And then they have roasted cauliflower,
 I had some of that and some Brussels sprouts.
 But everybody, I was just checking with everybody,
 'cause some people had tacos,
 and some people had just all different stuff,
 Pad Thai, and everybody liked their food.
  </li><li>Great. - Yeah.
  </li><li>All right.
 It's quite the mix up of different food types.
 So there you go.
 Brilliant.
 Thank you.
 Did anything else happen this week?
 It's honestly blur.
 Um, lots of meetings, lots of teaching, lots of early nights, lots of early mornings.
 True.
 Praise God for some downtime.
 Oh, I'm so excited.
 Oh, well, I got to go and learn a new game yesterday.
 Good.
 That's about all we have time for.
 And I can't.
 What was your new game?
 It's called Dutch Blitz.
 It sounds like a drinking game.
 Nope.
 It wasn't a drinking game.
 It's a card game, but it was really good.
 Oh, and a podcast listener sent me a game to play.
 So I'm going to take it to vacation with us.
 Thanks, I think.
 Well, it's supposed to be really fun.
 They they put a note saying it's like similar, like cotan, I guess,
 strategy wise, but less effort or less difficult to do.
 So I've already told Abby about it.
 We're planning on bringing in anti-sera and abbey and I can play.
 So good knock yourself out. That's awesome. There you go. Thank you, generous, anonymous,
 podcast listeners. Thank you very much. Our main topic for this week is all about the importance
 of forgiveness. And there's the soundtrack. What do you want to talk about forgiveness?
 What do I want to talk about it? Yeah, like, well, it's a thing we should do,
 but hardly anybody does, and yet has incredible rewards and untangles us from a lot of pain and
 And I think when we refuse to forgive, for example, we end up stuck, reaping the judgments
 we made as a result of our pain.
 What do you mean by that?
 I mean, people hurt us, so we sit in response.
 And usually, you know, when people hurt us, we write an narrative in our head about why
 they hurt us, and so we make judgments.
 And until we forgive those judgments, just keep boomeranging back on our lives.
 So we end up stuck in this horrible cycle and forgiveness is the way out.
 Yes, I agree.
 I think you said at the beginning of that statement, you know, it's something that we
 should do, but not many of us do do.
 And I would say actually if you've met someone who's really happy or their heart is pretty
 healed up, you've probably met someone who's really good at forgiving.
 Yeah, you won't get joy or wholeness without forgiveness.
 Correct.
 me about your journey of forgiveness?
 Well, I mean, I honestly struggled with the message of forgiveness to begin with,
 because, you know, I, well, I didn't get saved till I was 15.
 And then it was, it was around that time, maybe about six months later, that I
 started hearing all these different messages on forgiveness.
 And honestly, my response was, I got really angry, you know, took a
 response to a message.
 And do you know what was causing your anger?
 Yeah, I misunderstood forgiveness.
 I thought that if I forgave, then that meant the things that were done to me were
 okay. Like it was like, you know, just going, Hey, no, it's totally fine that you
 abused me. No, it's totally fine that my, you know, life growing up was a nightmare
 kind of thing. So I was like, I'm offended that you would even ask me to forgive.
 Because then it means it was totally fine.
 What they did to me is there something about.
 I mean, that's fascinating.
 We say, I'm just wondering, like you're aware and justice has been done to you.
 And if I forgive justices and carried out, is that, is that what was thinking?
 Like this is an unrighteous part of this almost like by me staying in unforgiveness.
 I'm kind of holding them hostage and somehow they're eventually going to get
 theirs because I'm, I've got my little hands around their throat and unforgiveness kind of thing.
 I mean, sadly, the truth is unforgiveness is like drinking poison and hoping they get sick.
 Yeah, pretty much.
 I mean, it's not it.
 Your unforgiveness doesn't hold them accountable.
 It only holds you in prison.
 Dang.
 Right.
 So what gets a really angry 15 year old from a position of one in justice and
 demand and justice and feeling some sort of reward by being able to hold hands
 around your father's neck saying, you don't get off.
 Scott Free for what you did to me to actually move into forgiveness.
 Well, it's sort of a long story.
 But basically I ended up in a situation where I believed that my dad was going to die that night
 and he was in hospital.
 And I offered him or I promised him one more chance when he asked for it.
 Did you have any intention on keeping that promise?
 No, because the doctor assured me that he was going to die.
 So your dad, who's horribly abused,
 you as a child, is lying in hospital, literally on his deathbed.
 Yes.
 And his last wish, pretty much, is that you would forgive him.
 Yes. And I said no.
 I said, I said, no, I won't give you another chance.
 And I walked away from his bed, but the doctor was standing on the
 other side of the curtain because he had said to me when we walked in
 because I was shaking.
 He could tell I was afraid.
 He said he would stand right there.
 So, um, he was still standing there and he said, listen,
 your father's not going to live through the night.
 So why don't you just let him die thinking he has one more chance?
 Cause that's what he'd asked for.
 So I went back in and I, I literally looked at him.
 I held up one finger.
 Um, well, I should probably be specific.
 Uh, my pointer finger.
 And, uh, I just said, you have one more chance and I left and, uh,
 thinking you'd never have to go through with that.
 Yeah.
 But you'd have some, oh, you think he were doing it for you?
 Were you thinking, I'll get peace.
 And if he dies, at least I can say, yeah, I forgive him.
 No, I wasn't thinking anything about me.
 I was just like, I'll just promise him this
 because he's going to die anyway.
 And then what do I care?
 What do I care?
 Right?
 Because I had a fair amount of anger riding in with that
 unforgiveness and all the rest of this stuff.
 But he miraculously lived.
 The bleeding all stopped miraculously.
 And I think the Lord knew that I would honor my word.
 So I was now in this process where I was going to have to work through some stuff.
 And it was a bit of a rocky road.
 Um, but it produced the amazing fruit of actually for the first of my life,
 having a relationship with my father that was actually healthy and wonderful.
 And not just that.
 I mean, yes, that's amazing.
 That's phenomenal.
 Like the, the long term benefits of forgiveness are unbelievable.
 Yes.
 Like if you hadn't forgiven your dad, none of the healing that came to you in
 later life would probably have come to you.
 I'm pretty sure I'd be dead if I hadn't, like if I hadn't learned to actually
 forgive and start to work through my stuff, I know I wouldn't be here.
 Yeah.
 And I'm even if you were here, I'm trying to think of the type of person you would
 be.
 Oh my gosh, I wouldn't want to be with me.
 I mean, I know how angry and disappointed and sort of vicious.
 I felt on the inside and yeah, I didn't like me.
 I remember when I first met you, you were a teacher in my school.
 I decided to know you were just one of the speakers who came in.
 And I remember trying to reconcile in my head the trauma of your story with the unscathedness,
 just unscathedness, that's not even a word, but the the effervescent joy that you were walking
 around with that I'm like this kind of trauma does not produce that kind of joy and of course
 your whole week you're teaching on the father heart but it was basically one long forgiveness
 talk, you know forgiving yourself, forgiving your parents, forgiving forgiving, forgiving
 the Lord as a weird one, we'll talk about that in a second, but just undoing all of the the
 the kind of wounds that had happened in your heart, which produced this level of freedom and
 joy in you. You did this brilliant example, which I actually stole and used with a second
 years, a couple of weeks ago. I know about what judgment does for your destiny. Can you describe
 that? Yeah, I do an example where you have one person come up to the front where everyone can
 see them and you talk through a story, just sort of make up a story on the spot. And so,
 If you, you know, you had Bob come up to the front and you'd be like, okay, this is Bob.
 And Bob is friends with Sam. And then you talk through this whole incident, you make something
 up between Bob and Sam and Bob is now angry at Sam. And so then you have Sam hold on to Bob,
 like, so there's a tie of unforgiveness. Because Bob won't forgive Sam. Because Bob won't forgive
 Sam. And then you have a couple of other different stories. And all of those Bob won't forgive
 those people because he's really wanting the justice that he feels like he deserves or
 he's just feeling like it's too big a thing to actually forgive.
 And by the end of it, you have four or five people hanging on to Bob.
 And then you sort of show the thing of Bob gets saved.
 He doesn't necessarily deal with his issues, but he gets saved.
 And the Lord says, Bob, I have this great destiny for you.
 Go head in this direction and you point in a direction.
 And Bob actually is stuck to the spot because he's now got five people hanging on to him
 because of his choice of unforgiveness.
 And so he's unable to move or if he can move towards the Lord, he moves very, very slowly.
 And so the idea is, you know, your unforgiveness actually is holding you in bondage and keeping
 you stuck.
 It's not affecting the other people the way you wish it would.
 It's affecting you way more.
 There's also three spiritual laws that govern the universe.
 I mean, there's more than that, but the three I'm thinking of are all impartial,
 just like the law of gravity is completely impartial,
 doesn't depend on your belief or your knowledge of it.
 But I'm thinking about the law of honour and dishonour.
 So in the Ten Commandments on your mother and father,
 and it will go well with you in the land that you're living.
 So in the areas where you don't honour your mother and father,
 things will not go well for you.
 Usually in the area that you are not honouring them.
 Right. And so judging and unforgiveness is not an honoring posture. Correct. So if I judge my father for being irresponsible with money, I will find that later in my life, I will be responsible with money. It will not go well from in the land of my finances.
 If I judge my mother for having a huge temper, I will ensure that I reap that judgment. And so usually what will happen is, because I've judged the primary woman in my life for having a bad temper, I will reap another primary woman.
 in my life for the bad temper. So usually, usually when people come to her for marriage,
 kind of thing, they're like, well, this is a outstanding issue. I'm like, Oh, what were
 your parents like? Okay, did you deal with that judgment? Because if you're holding on to
 unforgiveness, anyway, get the point. That's number one. The second law is the love, so
 I'm in reaping. Do not be deceived. God cannot be mocked. A man reaped so he so so whatever we
 sow out into the world, if we sow generosity, we reap generosity, if we sow honor, we reap
 honor. Right. So friendship, you reap friendship. Exactly. But if you sow gossip, you'll reap gossip.
 Right. If you sow bitterness, you'll reap bitterness. If you sow up forgiveness,
 you will reap discord in your life. Yeah. And then the last one is do not judge
 for the measure that you judge, it will be measured to you. So judging and receiving.
 Yeah, judging and receiving is a big deal. So again, if I judge somebody, I am condemning myself
 to do the very same thing that I've judged them. The way out of all three of those things,
 the way that you break free of the immutable and unchangeable laws is through forgiveness.
 Yeah. Like, Lord, I forgive this person for doing that undoes stuff in your life like you would
 not believe. Yeah. And I would say, I can't think of a time where I have held someone in
 unforgiveness where it wasn't empowered by judgment. Like I think typically that is we don't do it
 on purpose but we have judged them or assumed that we know the motivations of another person's
 heart or whatever. And then we feel justified enough to be like, no, you know, it's just that I
 just don't think that was okay. But actually, if it's got power in your heart, it's probably
 attached to judgment and unforgiveness.
 the emotional cost of staying angry and staying in judgment and holding on to unforgiveness is
 is enormous. Yeah. I mean, I just think the toll that it takes on you physiologically. Yeah.
 Why then with all these benefits spiritually, physically and relationally about unforgiveness,
 why is it sometimes it is so hard to forgive? Because we got hurt. Because we want to protect
 ourselves from everything, don't we? And usually, the ones that are really easy to forgive were
 pretty minor infractions. And usually, the ones that are difficult to forgive are typically
 family members or people that we let in to a place where they could hurt us much more badly.
 But it still isn't going to serve us to not forgive.
 Now you're right, but it feels unjust to forgive. And in one sense, of course, it is. A moral
 blow has been delivered and it feels unrighteous to say, no, it's good. I forgive you.
  </li><li>But the problem we run into with that, babe, is that that's exactly what Jesus did for us.
  </li><li>Oh, great. Throw that one on my face.
  </li><li>No, I'm not trying to be religious about it, but I'm just saying, here we are,
 here I am, here you are, here the podcast listener is.
 And we've been forgiven of everything.
 Like all the stuff, all the junk, everything we've done
 and all the people that we've hurt,
 we in an instant were forgiven with,
 we don't receive justice,
 we receive complete grace and mercy.
 And so if we think about that,
 then how do we stand there and say,
 well, Jesus, I know you died on a cross
 so I could be free, but actually,
 I'm gonna hold this person hostage because they hurt me.
 It's never gonna go well for us.
  </li><li>That's the whole parable of the
 unmerciful servant in Matthew 18 is where this guy
 owes this huge debt to somebody and he's
 talking about how he's gonna pay it.
 And he goes to the person he owes the debt to
 and they say, look, I completely forgive you.
 You don't owe me anything.
 And I mean, you can just imagine the relief.
 But on the way out, the guy who's just been
 forgiven spots another guy that owes him like 20 bucks.
 He's like, "Hey, you owe me 20 bucks."
 And the guy's like, "Oh, have mercy on me.
 "Please, I can't pay back."
 He's like, "No way."
 He throws him and his family in prison.
 And when the first ruler hears about what this guy's done,
 he's like, "I showed you all this mercy
 "and you wouldn't show mercy in this area."
 And Jesus has this really sobering line that says,
 "This is in the same way that this guy
 "was thrown into prison and was tortured.
 "This is what will happen to us when we refuse to forgive."
  </li><li>It's funny, babe, because that's actually the passage
 that the Lord used to unlock my heart
 to be able to forgive my dad was Matthew 18.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah, and 'cause there's a place in it
 where the second guy says,
 hey, or maybe it's the first one, he says,
 he's forgiven because he doesn't have it to give.
 Like he just doesn't have it to give.
 And I was reading that story and the Lord said to me,
 you know, it was really hard what you went through.
 And he just, you know, it wasn't okay
 the way you were parented by your dad,
 but he just didn't have it to give.
 And I thought, oh, and then the more I found out
 about his childhood and what he was raised in,
 I realized he really didn't.
 He never experienced love at home.
 He never experienced anything close to unconditional love,
 certainly, or acceptance or anything.
 And as much as how he raised me in many ways, really sucked,
 he really didn't have it to give.
 He was doing the best that he could with what he had.
 It just wasn't good, you know.
 But in a moment I was able to sort of go, oh, okay, wow,
 I was holding you hostage over my expectations
 of what it should have been like.
 And maybe even what I'd seen in other families.
 But he really did do the best he could with what he had.
  </li><li>And that doesn't mean that what he did was okay.
  </li><li>It doesn't mean-- - Two truths in one.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>It doesn't mean it was okay.
 But it did mean I could move towards releasing him
 from all of the hostility that was quite literally
 eating my heart. Like it was, it was having my lunch, you know, and that's what started
 the process for me of actually getting to, you know, be free.
 I think one of the, the scariest stories I've heard you tell regarding forgiveness is what
 happened regarding your first husband leaving you. Yes. And his sister. Right, right, right.
 Do you want to tell that story?
  </li><li>Sure.
 So when I was 23, I got married.
 And then when I was 24, my first husband left me for a friend.
 And so that was brutal, obviously.
 We were both worship leading and--
  </li><li>You and your first husband?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And so everybody pretty much knew who we were.
 I'd been at the church, obviously, for years.
  </li><li>This is also in the midst of revival.
  </li><li>In the midst of revival.
  </li><li>Right.
 doesn't guarantee us in free life people. No, it doesn't. You still have to deal with your stuff.
 But anyway, so that was obviously really brutal. And we had planned to go to England to spend time
 with his family and with his parents and all that kind of stuff the following summer. And
 I believed and prayed for that marriage for three years for it to be restored,
 Regardless of all the things that were happening and all the things that I knew were happening and how far we were getting away from restoration daily.
 I was just still praying and his parents had said, hey, why don't you still come for vacation, you know, without him, just me.
 And they're like, you know, you're still our daughter in law. We would love you to come and, you know, be here. And this was a year after he had left.
 And I was like, gosh, okay, you know, because I mean, they were amazing and I really love them.
 And I was like, okay, I'll do that. And so I went and while I was there,
 I would we were walking around Cornwall and and his sister, we were talking and everything. And
 she was she started talking and she was furious. I mean, furious at him. And she's like, how could
 could he ever do this? Like we were raised better than that. And how could he? I, you
 know, I can't believe he's done this to you. And you know, she was just, she was so angry.
 And I was like, Oh, babe, like, here's the thing. Because of a bunch of the statements
 that she made, I was like, please don't, please don't do this. Like, please don't get mad
 on my behalf. And please don't judge him. You'll read that. Like, don't do this. I remember
 having this really intense conversation, trying to talk her out of being mad at him,
 relieving me. It was, and it was just pretty wild actually. But she was like, no, I just,
 you know, I would never do that. And, and I was just like, okay, well, you know, so end
 of conversation, that's fine. Within a year, she left her own husband. They also were worship
 leaders that she left her own husband. He with two kids, she literally walked out of the house,
 left her husband and two kids and had an affair with someone else within a year.
 I'm somebody might say that's coincidence.
 I think that that's judging and receiving.
 I think she opened a door because she wanted to stay in judgment.
 And and she she ended up opening a door over her life that just reaped destruction.
 Um, you know, where's the verse about you who judge do the same things?
 I think it's Romans two.
 Okay.
 Can you grab it?
 Romans 2, verse 1, "You therefore have no excuse,
 you who pass judgment on someone else,
 for at whatever point you judge another,
 you are condemning yourself
 because you who pass judgment do the same things."
  </li><li>So it means actually you do something.
 I judge you for doing it.
 I'm appalled at you for doing it,
 but now because I've judged you,
 I'm gonna do the same thing.
 I'm opening a door.
  </li><li>I'm condemning myself to the same thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I found is easier for me to forgive
 to forgive when I'm hurt, but it's sneakier for me to identify the need for forgiveness
 when I pick up an offense.
 Yeah.
 So like, if somebody hurts me, I can forgive them fairly easily, depends on who isn't what
 the hurt was, but you know, I'm always going to want to forgive because it's a life value.
 Right.
 But somebody hurts you or somebody hurts people close to me.
 I don't even I'm not even aware that I've picked up an offense on their behalf.
 Like I've entered into the judgment like, Oh my gosh, how could that person be so mean to hurt that person I've loved?
 And I am unaware. Oh, hold on.
 And you actually need to forgive that person and just undo them.
 Even though they haven't hurt me per se, I've stepped in a judgment and I need to break that judgment.
 Yeah, I actually find that way harder than forgiving someone who's hurt me.
 I mean, I would say I'll extend grace much more quickly for hurting me than for someone else.
 It's rough.
 Yeah. I think it's also interesting that in the Lord's prayer, the only time in Scripture we find
 Jesus teaching his disciples about to pray, he talks about forgiving others as we've been
 forgiven and then gives them the dendom just to make sure that we understand that if we forgive
 others, our Father in heaven will forgive us, but if we choose not to forgive others,
 our heavenly Father will not forgive us. So, I mean, there's a lot of great reasons to be
 be practicing forgiveness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And again, I mean, we're not saying it's easy, you know?
 It isn't easy.
 And it might be that you forgive the same person
 for the same thing a hundred times.
 I mean, I'm sure I've forgiven my dad
 thousands of times at this point.
 And I still have moments where I guess it's what
 your council will recall, grief, you know,
 that you have moments where, I mean, he's been gone
 for, gosh, 27 years at this point.
 We'll talk about the day after your birthday this week.
 -When I was just feeling sad.
 -Well, yeah, you get into bed.
 I'm like, "Hey babe, how are you?"
 -Yeah.
 -And you're like, "I'm feeling sad."
 I'm like, "Oh babe, I'm sorry I'm feeling sad."
 -Yeah.
 -Well--
 -What do you feel sad about?
 You're like, "I don't know."
 I'm like, "Maybe it was your birthday yesterday,
 and you're sad because your dad wasn't there to celebrate."
 -Thanks.
 Now you're going to make me cry on the podcast.
 But it is.
 It's every special occasion that he's missing.
 And it's every milestone that he misses with the kids
 that I can either let it lodge in my heart
 as anger or disappointment,
 or I can sit there and say,
 "Dad, I forgive you again for missing something
 that would have mattered to you
 that I would have loved to have you at."
 But I'd much rather do that in the moment.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Then start to become the bitter and angry person
 that I was before I learned about forgiveness.
 So it's hard and it's work and it's daily, but it's so necessary to even be able to love and enjoy life.
 And it's also important we understand that we're not ignoring our hearts.
 Like when we're hurt, it's not our goal to move, to pull out a prayer of forgiveness so we don't feel hurt.
 It's okay to feel the feelings and go, "I'm hurt and I can forgive."
 Not "I can forgive so I don't feel hurt."
 Right.
 And sometimes forgiveness honestly starts as a purely cognitive thing.
 Like I know need to forgive.
 So I'm going to choose to forgive even though I feel like I'm forgiving.
 I would say that's exactly what it was like for me.
 Maybe even for the first couple of years, just a brute will force kind of choice.
 And then something switches.
 Yeah.
 And it gets to your heart.
 Yeah.
 I know this is ridiculous for me to even ask this question.
 But how does one forgive?
 I honestly think it's just a really simple prayer of just saying, "Father, here's this
 person or here's this situation and I feel really hurt or I feel really angry."
 Acknowledge how you feel in the midst of it.
 But even though I feel hurt and angry, I'm now choosing to forgive this person.
 And I say it out loud and name it.
 name what happened, name the person, you know, I mean, not to other people, but to the father.
 And then just be like, Lord, would you help me?
 I'm choosing to forgive.
 Would you help my heart forgive?
 I feel like it's necessary to ask you about some post forgiveness protocol.
 OK, because there's a good way and a disastrous way to walk out your, your
 post forgiveness life.
 Like if I were to forgive you for something and then come into your office and be like, I
 just want you to know, I just prayed to the father and forgave you for being a jerk.
 Is that what you mean?
 Don't worry about the woman who accosted you at a conference once.
 Oh my goodness.
 Yes.
 So the speaker had said, "Hey, if you're holding unforgiveness with anyone in the room, go
 ahead and deal with that.
 We're going to be a few minutes to have conversations and then we're going to go into ministry or
 whatever."
 And this woman came up to me and she was like, she just sat down right next to me.
 I was emceeing so I was sitting on the front row and I'd never seen it before in my life.
 So she sat down next to me and I was like, oh hi.
 And I'm not thinking she could possibly be talking
 about forgiveness with me 'cause I've never seen her.
 And she's like, I just want you to know
 that I forgive you for walking by me at every meeting
 and during this conference and never hugging me,
 even though you've hugged other people.
 And I just want you to know I forgive you.
 And I was like, okay, thank you.
 And then she just got up and left.
 And I was like, who was that person?
 So that would be an example of something you don't do.
 Yeah, that actually doesn't have anything to do with the person who didn't see you. That's your own stuff.
 Right.
 So, yeah, your forgiveness is between you and the Lord.
 Yeah.
 Oh, here's a good question.
 Yeah.
 Does somebody need to come and ask you for their forgiveness in order for you to forgive them?
 No.
 Does someone need to apologize before you can issue a forgiveness?
 No. I mean, that'd be nice. Sometimes that's gonna happen.
 But but probably most often not it's it can't be about them apologizing before you forgive
 I cannot or you are gonna end up a bitter
 Dried up individual and because sometimes the person who's hurt you is completely unaware that they've hurt you oblivious
 How many times have you been oblivious that you hurt someone else and then you're like what wait what and how long have you been upset about that?
 I had no idea, you know, so I'm not walking around thinking. I'm just not gonna apologize or ask you to forgive
 of, I don't know that it happened.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 Wouldn't you say that forgiveness is vital for remaining married?
 Oh, absolutely.
 It's it's it's vital for remaining married within the first week, probably.
 It's funny, though, isn't it?
 Because when we're left our own devices, we write narratives that justify our pain.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, you did that, you know, it's back to the whole we're a dumbest one.
 We think we know the motives of another person's heart.
 Yeah.
 But before we can even agree with that,
 thought we've written a amazing soap opera
 about the other person and why they're vicious.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>And they're the queen of darkness
 and they don't love me, they're just stabbing in the heart.
  </li><li>The queen of darkness, wow.
  </li><li>I've got a particularly vivid imagination.
  </li><li>You really do, darling.
 Yeah.
 I think forgiveness is pivotal
 to every single relationship that you have in your life,
 every single one.
  </li><li>We mentioned earlier, forgiving God.
 That's a weird concept.
  </li><li>Yes.
 How can you forgive God who is sinless?
 Yeah.
 I mean, so when I'm talking about or when I think about forgiving God, see, as a kid,
 we don't have a perception that, you know, God is sinless and he didn't, whatever.
 Like we just sort of, I mean for myself, I attributed hurt to God.
 Like I was like, Hey, if you're real and you love me, then why does my life look like
 this?
 Why have you let, you know, like dad throw me downstairs?
 Right.
 Why have you let abuse happen to me?
 Why if you're this great, big, wonderful God, where are you?
 And so for me actually, because I realized my heart is holding him hostage, I needed
 to actually work through forgiveness for me, not for him.
 But I actually prayed and said, you know, father, will you forgive me?
 Or I forgive you for every place my heart has held you hostage for every place, for
 every trauma or every hurt that I have laid at your feet.
 And would you forgive me for every way I have held you hostage and just sort of work
 that through?
 And that was a big shift for me too.
 It's also like realizing I have judged God.
 I've held him hostage to my expectations.
 Yeah.
 And usually for things that the enemy has done really if you want to, you know, attribute
 it correctly.
 But it's interesting that narrative still exists.
 Like even this week I was speaking to a leader.
 His belief is that God is the author of our pain.
 And I'm like, no, he's not the author of our pain.
 I categorically disagree with you, sir.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I think I said those words.
 Yeah.
 You know, John 10, 10 is the thief who comes to steel kill and destroy.
 Right.
 But Jesus comes to give his life and life abundant.
 Right.
 If you think about the things that happened to you in your childhood
 and said that was God's will and he was writing that into your narrative
 so that you'd be an amazing speaker to help set people free.
 This is a horrible, horrible God.
 Well, horrible charges to lay against God.
 Right. Right.
 You would remove children from a human father who behaved that way.
 Right.
 And yet the truth is bad stuff does happen, but God is in the business of redemption.
 Yes.
 I love what Joseph says at the end of his, uh, towards the end of his story, when his
 brothers realized he's still alive, even though they beat him up, left him for dead,
 sold him in a slavery.
 Right.
 He was then wrongly accused of rapes and prison.
 Yeah.
 You know, horrible story.
 horrible story. And yet he's not saying, yeah, God is the author of my story. He said to them,
 what you meant for bad, God has redeemed for good. And that is the great story of her lives,
 that God is writing goodness in her lives, not agony.
 Yeah, that's actually my favorite line of that entire story, that whole what you meant for evil,
 God meant for good. I love it.
 I would encourage you, dear listener, to take some time this week and maybe do a forgiveness
 I saw it just asked the Lord just find some quiet time this week and just asked the Lord Lord are their people in my life
 that I need to forgive
 yeah, and then write out a list of the people and what you need to forgive them for and just
 Just go down the list of like Lord. I forgive
 AJ for bringing home a really creepy helium-filled balloon
 Oh, and I repent for stabbing it so that it would no longer haunt me in my sleeping hours
 Would you forgive me and would you forgive her amen?
 That's very funny. I do have one other suggestion for you though. Well, let's lead you through that prayer right now
 Well, no, hang on a second because I forgive
 I forgive Alan for stabbing my balloon for being a big jerk and stabbing my present
 And I repent of the judgment of calling him a jerk
 I was trying to take us into serious ministry time and go hi Jack. What are you gonna say?
 I was gonna say when you're when you're doing your audit of who needs to be forgiven
 I want you to consider and pray about and think about do you need to forgive yourself as well because we didn't talk about that no and
 Really there's usually three categories
 There's those people that have hurt you, you know or hurt someone that you love so those outside people
 God as we already talked about and then usually there's a fair amount of us that actually need to forgive ourselves
 For things we're still holding ourselves hostage for you know and and usually a good way of identifying
 Areas where we might need to extend ourselves forgiveness is when you hear I should statements I should I should have known better
 I should have I should you know because usually those that should usually is marked by some level of judgment of
 of a place where we feel we have failed and we're holding ourselves hostage for something.
 I have a listener's question from Emma.
 Okay.
 And she asked this, "I love your teaching on what God says about our identity.
 No, my identity and my Father God has transformed the way I think and relate to God.
 And I felt God say that he wants me to share this knowledge with others.
 I wonder if you have any tips on how to share messages such as the Father
 or a godly beliefs hearing god's voice with a group in my university's Christian club.
 Also, are there any things to be aware of when teaching them and leading a response time with
 them? I know with the Holy Spirit it might get a little bit messy. I would appreciate any responses
 if you have time to answer the question. Wow Emma, great questions. I would say particularly
 probably in a university kind of club or university union. Go testimony heavy,
 i.e. if you can focus on what was my life like before, then what did God do or what
 did he show me or what did you see out of scripture that changed your heart in
 the situation? What did you pray and then what does my life look like now? Like what
 What is the fruit of having efforted this and having worked it through?
 Basically you're handing them hope and you're handing them a light at the end of the tunnel
 essentially.
 If you can go testimony heavy, make sure obviously that their scripture in there or whatever
 God impacted you with in there.
 is what tends to move people's hearts enough to think, well, if God will do it for you,
 He'll do it for me.
 Yeah.
 Story is king for these things.
 Yeah.
 What about the response time?
 There's not much you can do to guarantee it won't be messy.
 It'll probably be messy.
 If you're talking about heart stuff and people have heart wounds and most people do, well,
 let's just say all, it is probably going to get messy.
 But you don't have to worry about messy because actually God's fine with messy and
 he knows how to take care of that. So I would just say, if you can do repeat after me type
 prayers, and you might want to write it out ahead of time so that in the moment, if people
 are crying, it doesn't throw you and you forget what to pray. Because when I first started
 doing it, that was the hardest part for me is I would look around the room and I would
 see people falling apart. And the emotion of it would make it really difficult for me
 to, you know, figure out what to pray next kind of thing. So it might be helpful if you
 write out like a prayer of forgiveness that you're going to lead them through.
 And, and then if, you know, if you want to add to it, you can, but you have
 something that you're going to sort of jump off of.
 And then just trust God and bite the Holy Spirit into the room to
 minister to the people before you start to pray.
 Thanks.
 And great question.
