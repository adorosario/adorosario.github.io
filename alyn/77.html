<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones, you look amazing.<br/>
 Thanks, baby.<br/>
 You got new clothes, new hair?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, technically, you're not new hair.
 Same hair, but just colored and styled.
 Yes.<br/>
 It's been a good week.<br/>
 It has been an amazing week.<br/>
 We're going to get to why it's a good week in a second.
 But first of all, we're going to catch up on our week from the top.
 Yes.<br/>
 From the very top.<br/>
 You taught on boundaries this week.<br/>
 Yes, I did.<br/>
 New and improved boundaries.<br/>
 Six hours of boundaries teaching our poor students.
 I keep forgetting that a lot of people
 haven't heard the message of boundaries.
 And so it's a foreign concept that you have and know
 and you can use and know.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Especially if you've been in ministry, it seems like.
 Often people that have been in ministry
 or maybe our higher responders have a hard time
 with the boundaries message.<br/>
 And to be fair, a lot of our school are first language responders.
 So they were just in in paralysis at what I was saying.
 But I can't wait to see the freedom that come from them.
 I think that the value of boundaries is you become a truer version of yourself.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And because you actually get to say no and yes to the things that you want to say no
 and yes to.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And the concept is that boundaries enable you to give sacrificially.
 I think there's a dilemma over the years where we feel as Christians, we should do things,
 but should doing things and choosing to do things are a world apart.
 One is things being taken from you.<br/>
 The other is you voluntarily giving it.
 If you have no clue what we're talking about, check our show notes and we'll put a link
 to our Bambres podcast that we did.<br/>
 It's a good primer.<br/>
 Then we also have some teaching on Bambres that you can download too.
 Anyway, that was Monday and Tuesday.<br/>
 We had guesting was this week, which was a lot of fun,
 but the big event of the week was your birthday last Friday,
 but some friends of yours decided that having one day to celebrate
 your birthday wasn't enough.<br/>
 And so on Tuesday, they surprised you.
 Tell us what happened.
</p><ul>
  <li>I was actually just about to leave the school building
 to go over and get some work done.
 I had made a plan for all the things I was going to get
 knocked off my list.
  </li><li>Like a good shaper.
 And so I was in the back hallway and somebody came and got me for some nebulous thing.
 And actually, even before that, you had tricked me.
 I did.
 Yes.
 Because you said, babe, I really want to make sure that we go in tomorrow in time for worship
 because sometimes we're missing the first 10 or 15 minutes of worship.
 And I was like, okay.
 He's like, I just, you know, I really want to be, you know, I want to be in the game.
 I'm like, okay.
 So we get there at nine and you're not in the room
 for worship.
 And I remember looking around going, dude,
 you said you wanted to be like in the flow
 and you're not in here.
 And I thought, oh, you're probably just doing other stuff.
 And you know what I mean?
 But it did occur to me.
 I was strange.
 And then I asked like Sarah Pape to fix my hair
 and she was doing like extra time on my hair.
 And I was like, oh, I really don't care.
 No, I mean, really, it's fine.
 I'm sure it's good." And she's like, "No, no, it doesn't be fixed." And so it all came
 together when all of a sudden Cindy said, "A.J. Jones, can you come up here?" And I
 went up to the front and everybody clapped. And I thought, "Oh, this is sweet. They're
 gonna sing." And it's early because my birthday is in front of their four days, but that's
 fine. So they were all clapping. And then Grace came in carrying a bag and a jar of cash.
 And I was like, oh, that's so, like, that's so nice.
 They bought me a gift and they're giving me a jar of cash, you know?
 And Cindy had purposely had them delay, you know, so I saw just the one person walking in.
 And then as soon as Grace put the bag down in front of me, I saw this line of people walking in.
 And there was like 15 or 20 people walking in, carrying various sizes of things.
 All of gifts.
 All with gifts.
 And we have video of this, which we'll put link to in the show notes.
 Are you doing the best ugly crying?
 I've seen it a long time.
 Oh, I've fallen ugly cried.
 Yeah.
 I mean, I think once the second or third person
 and I sort of looked down the line and realized
 there's this huge line of people, I just started bawling.
 And at one point, I considered running out.
 Because I was like, I don't know how to process this.
 I don't usually get surprised by people.
 And yeah, so they brought in two big gifts at the end.
 Cindy said, "You know, just open this last one." And so as I'm leaning down to open the last one,
 and which was an iPad, and the keyboard and the pencil and everything, like the money to get the
 iPad Pro, because it wasn't released at the time. So you got everybody chipped in and they got you
 enough money to buy you an iPad Pro, the new smart keyboard, and the Apple pencil. Right. So that's
 that's going to help a lot with all my like illustration stuff and creative stuff.
 And so I was like, oh, this is awesome.
 And then I don't know why, but in my head, I was like, clearly all the rest of the bags
 and boxes are decoys, you know, they're all empty.
 And so I was like, thank you, you know, thank you for that.
 And whatever.
 And then Cindy was like, okay, well, can somebody pick up all this stuff and put it back in
 a AJ's office so she can open it.
 And that was the first time it occurred to me that there was actually stuff in all the
 other stuff.
 So I bald again and then I spent most of the morning crying.
  </li><li>Well it's fair to say you were in a certain amount of shock.
  </li><li>I really was.
  </li><li>Completely undone.
  </li><li>Only for two or three days.
 It's completely undone.
  </li><li>Completely undone because your primary love language is gifts.
 Historically birthdays haven't been banner moments for you.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so I shut down my heart in expectation.
  </li><li>Out of girl.
  </li><li>I know it's not a good thing, but I do.
 I prepare for, you know, birthday and Christmas
 by just lowering my expectations so I can't be disappointed.
 And it's so much fun to be around somebody like that.
 Right.
 But I know just sucked the life right out of everything.
 Perfect.
 And then Cindy and all of your friends behind your back
 just weren't to surprise you.
 I wasn't involved in it really at all.
 I got a phone call to say, we've got some cash here.
 What do you think she'd like?
 And I was like, actually, you talked about the iPad Pro
 way before I ever brought it up.
 And I thought, she did mention the iPad Pro.
 And I'm honestly not trying to influence this.
 Let me revisit with her to see if that was real or imagined.
 So I kind of coyly inquired under the guise of,
 "What would you like?
 Would you like me to buy this?
 Is this one you're interested in?"
 And bless you, you went away and prayed about it
 and journaled about it.
 And you were like, "Actually, my heart would love that.
 I want to be more creative."
 And so you were thoroughly surprised.
 And then we actually got it.
 It launched on Wednesday for pre-order.
 We pre-ordered it Wednesday.
 And there was a rumor that the stores might have them
 on Friday and we got one for you on Friday
 Let you know.
 And it's beautiful.
 It's huge.
 Enormous.
 Yeah.
 But it is stunning.
 It is beautiful.
 The screen is exceptional.
 Yes.
 But the sound quality is unbelievable.
 It really is.
 I don't think I need to watch anything
 on the 60 inch TV anymore.
 Well, yes.
 That's fine with me.
 More Mario for me.
 Go to your room and watch your iPad Pro.
 Keep it going.
 And then on Friday, we had a girls birthday party.
 just invited a bunch of women and we had dinner and it was awesome.
  </li><li>Any of your favorite sushi.
  </li><li>My favorite sushi and more presents.
 I totally didn't expect more presents because-
  </li><li>Talk to us about your power tool obsession.
  </li><li>Okay, so I've fallen in love with the Anna White website
 and she's a woman in Alaska who builds all this stuff.
 And so she gives you plans to build pottery barn kind of stuff
 and whatever. And I just thought, okay, we've, we've, for example, we've been married for
 how long now? Almost 11 years. Almost 11 years. We still don't have a bed frame. Right. Right.
 But we do have a bed. Like we have something we sleep on, but we just don't have bedroom
 furniture. That's because all our expendable income goes on Apple products. Right. Or, you
 know, paying things off or whatever. Yes. And so, so we can't ever justify like spending
 $2,000 on a bed.
 Right.
 But she gives you the plans and, you know, to build the kind of
 bed that I would want would actually cost about $150.
 Well, that's different.
 That's doable.
 And plus you're a very handy person.
 I am.
 Like you are really crafty.
 You.
 I mean, you love when we got married, I did not bring anything to the table
 hardware wise.
 You had all your drill bits and your drill kit and
 I changed it all the way.
 You know, you had everything.
 I didn't have anything.
 I'm an expert in the digital realm.
 You're the expert in the hardware realm.
 So this is just all of your love languages come true.
 Yeah.
 And a lot of like, not a lot, but I have some really good memories of my dad from when I was little him working in our garage, which was made into a shop, which power tools.
 Am I do believe that our garage is going to be turned into a shop?
 Well, we'll talk about that later.
 Oh, thank you.
 I'll schedule them.
 So it was a great week. It was a really, really great week. And I'm looking forward to building stuff.
 Oh my gosh, I cannot wait. Our kids have been to the same preschool, all through them. Michael Johnson there.
 And the guy that comes and takes their preschool photos does an amazing job of making the kids actually look good and smile.
 And that's awesome. I don't know what he does to them. I have no idea.
 But it's magic.
 And so in Santa, we got them all dressed up and we went to get them all photos for Christmas
 cards or whatever.
 And for whatever reason, it was just less hassle just to get the kids done.
 And even though we were wearing matching clothes, we never got our photos taken.
 So we went to the factory for a reason we're going to talk about in a second.
 And I thought, we'll just find somewhere and take a photo with an iPhone.
 But who do we bump into?
 But our good friend David Molner, who is an amazing photographer in his own right.
  </li><li>And outstanding professional photographer
 with that portfolio that is astonishing
 and has worked for Fortune 500 companies
 and pop stars, rock stars, and he's a legend.
 But last year he wrote a book called iPhone Photography.
 And so we thought, who better to take an iPhone photo
 for our Christmas cards than David?
 So we latched on him and he was gracious enough.
 I said, David, this is a clone of somebody
 coming up to me in public.
 Hey, could you pray over my friend?
 So would you mind taking a photograph?
 And of course he was on what you happened to do that for us.
 The reason we went to the factory though, Agee, was why?
  </li><li>Because five daughters bakery opened
 their store in Franklin.
  </li><li>Five daughters bakeries run by our friends Isaac
 and Stephanie Meek, they have five daughters, hence the name.
 And if ever there was a spiritual gift in a bakery,
 Isaac would have it.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I haven't tasted anything he's made
 that wasn't astonishing.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, so good.
  </li><li>And so they've opened their first of two stores
 in the natural Franklin area.
 this one in Franklin at the factory, $12 right inside the factory, right inside the main
 square, they made 1400 donuts and sold out with them in about two hours.
 Yeah, gone. We got there just before 11 or just after 11, and they were all gone and
 they opened at nine. Unbelievable. And they're opening a second location in the 12th South
 area.
 Yeah, in the next couple of weeks.
 In the next couple of weeks. Just well done, guys. You've done an astonishing job. And
 then today for your birthdays, if things could not get better, they dropped off having
 16 donuts. One for every year. I don't know. That's right. I'm only 16. Yes. So thank you for that. Anyway, all of that is fascinating. But the reason we're here is to pick up our conversation about life languages from last week. Yes. And we have none other than a bona fide
 out life language expert with us. Mrs. Allison Hendrickson. Thank you so much. I'm so happy to be here. We're so excited that you're here. We can't believe we're giving up your Sunday night to come and talk life languages.
 That's how much I love you guys.
  </li><li>Oh, well, one of the things that we can genuinely say about you is you absolutely love life languages.
  </li><li>I do.
  </li><li>When did you first get into it?
  </li><li>Well, funny you should ask that question, because I think I can blame it totally on you guys.
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>It was our fault.
  </li><li>It was your fault or your responsibility.
  </li><li>But you've always had a passion as long as I've known you for this kind of thing.
  </li><li>Oh, absolutely.
  </li><li>Like communication, personality, understanding, interpersonal behavior, all that sort of stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause I think the first meal we ever had with you,
 you were like, look at the square, the squiggly line,
 or whatever, and you're like, pick this.
 Oh, I'll tell you this, and whatever.
 And I was like, wow.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think I've been pretty much obsessed
 with understanding the way people work
 and the way they communicate pretty much all of my life.
 Like I know my shape, my color, my animal.
 I even took a thing on Facebook
 where I found out my Disney spirit animal.
 Oh no, spirit princess.
  </li><li>Okay, look at you.
  </li><li>Mocha hanis.
  </li><li>Wow, of course.
 (laughs)
 And so you discovered life language as first as somebody who got their profile done.
 And don't let me put words in your mouth, but I remember being at the seminar that we were all at.
 And you had this major breakthrough slash meltdown and the best possible sense of that word.
 What was that about? What happened in that moment?
 Well, backing up a little bit, when you guys first got here, I was just finishing up my master's in corporate communication.
 So I just spent the last couple of years just studying every communication and personality profile out there.
 So I went into it going, I'm really excited about learning more, but I'm probably not going to learn that much because I just, you know, research all this stuff.
 So getting into that first seminar, it just blew my mind because for the first time, I'm like, Oh my goodness, I make sense to myself and not feeling like I was put in this box of you are this, therefore you're not this.
 But here's this 3D snapshot of the way that I think, the way I communicate, and the way that I approach the world, and the way that I approach other people around me.
 and it just blew my mind.
 I think the biggest frustration that we have on the other side of the revelation of life
 languages, you want all your loved ones to do it.
 But understandably, their reluctance is, I don't want to be pigeonholed.
 And it's very hard to explain you're not going to be pigeonholed.
 Right.
 How have you found a way around that?
 Because this is what you do for a part of what you do for a living is your certified
 life language trainer.
 What do we call you?
 Yeah, certified life language trainer.
 So you must meet people all the time, either in the business world or with the clients
 that you work with, who perhaps are reluctant to begin with.
 How do you get past the, I don't want to be pigeonholed.
 I tell people that instead of putting them in a box, it's going to give them a foundation
 to stand on.
 See?
 That's a masters in personal communication.
 Drops the mic.
 That's why I have letters after my name.
 That's right.
 And before, you know, MRS.
 Right.
 Those are the best letters.
 Was that a radio lab?
 No, that was a genuine laugh.
 I had to work at what MRI stood for.
 My worker is done.
 I can go home now matching ring scenario.
 So it's not a box to be that say that saying again.
 It's not a box we're putting someone in.
 It's a foundation we're giving them to stand on.
 Brilliant.
 Yes.
 That's a great elevator pitch for what it is.
 Listeners, if you haven't had a chance to listen to last week's episode,
 it might be a good idea to pause here, go back and listen.
 because we explain a little bit more, but Alison,
 did you get a chance to listen to last week's episode?
  </li><li>Yes, I did.
  </li><li>And is there anything that you wanted to correct?
 I asked that a little bit scared
 because we're just enthusiastic amateurs
 and I knew that you would be coming on the show,
 so I was trying to pick my words carefully.
 Was there anything you need to undo that I said
 that was incorrect or AJ said that was incorrect last week?
  </li><li>Well, let me take a look at my bulleted list here.
 (laughing)
 No, the only thing would just be the underline again
 that it's not a test, 'cause the test puts you in
 category of you can either pass or fail or there's some answers that are better than
 other answers. So this is a profile that's going to give you a snapshot at this point
 in time of what your communication style and preferences are.
 Right. So did I say do the test, the online test, or something like that?
 Yeah, I think at the very end you might have dropped that four letter word in there, but
 for the most part, everything else was awesome.
 And to be fair, it is remarkably painless. As long as you follow your instructions of
 go with what feels right.
 I think the danger, this must be my third or fourth time
 completing the profile.
 Agee and I retook our profiles this week.
 And I remember sitting there and thinking,
 but I don't know which one I,
 and then I remembered, just go with your gut.
 Go with what feels better to you.
 And it took me about 15 minutes.
  </li><li>Yeah, this is, I've taken it four times
 and every single time I have to remind myself,
 just go with your gut and don't start over analyzing
 'cause I like to over analyze things.
 So, Alison, tell us, what are the seven life languages?
  </li><li>So, before we even talk about
 the seven different life languages,
 probably the number one thing to remember
 is everyone has a filter.
 And we imagine a filter is like wearing different color glasses.
 So, you've heard the saying,
 seeing something through rose-colored glasses.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, anything you look at,
 looking through those rose-colored glasses
 is going to have a rose-colored hue.
 So, you should could show me a sheet of white paper
 and tell me this paper is white,
 but if I have rose-colored glasses on,
 I'm gonna swear up and down, oh no,
 that paper is a nice, light-pink color.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So every one of the seven life languages
 has a different color filter, a different type of filter.
 So one of our challenges is to learn what our filter is
 and what our needs and passions are,
 and then to learn what that filter is
 of the people that are around us.
  </li><li>Which is a huge, I mean, just think about marriage
 relationships, like the amazing conflict
 that could be eradicated just by understanding,
 oh, I forgot that you see this differently than I do.
 Or between a boss and an employee or kids or whatever.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>That in itself is incredible.
  </li><li>Yeah, so looking at each of those filters
 with the different life languages,
 we have all seven of the languages
 are broken down into three different categories.
 First, we have the kinetic category,
 which are the mover and doer.
 And those are the languages that approach life first
 through movement, and then they go on
 to either thinking or feeling.
 Okay.
 Then we have the emotive category,
 which are the influencer and responder.
 And those are people that are going to approach life first
 through their emotions and feelings,
 and then they'll go on to either think about that
 or they'll go on into motion.
 And then finally, we have the cognitive languages.
 And those are the shaper, producer, and contemplator.
 And those are the people that approach life first
 through thinking, and then they go on
 into either movement or emotion.
 Now, I'm gonna ask you a loaded question
 that I know the answer to,
 but it's a question that I'm sure
 every his of the back of their head. What's the best language?
 There is no best language.
 And that's confusing for people.
 Yes, it is.
 And that's probably one of the biggest questions I get.
 Every single seminar is what's the right answer?
 What's the wrong answer?
 What is the best thing?
 What should I strive to be?
 Because I've had friends of mine do the profile and be
 disappointed with the results because they weren't the language
 they wanted to be.
 And I'm like, that's insane.
 So the ultimate goal is that you want to be the best version of
 yourself and the best version of who the Lord created you to be.
 And so there's no possible way then of saying qualifying that one language is better than
 another as long as you're being true to that and going after what true authentic identity
 actually is.
 Can I ask you another question?
 Yes.
 Let's say my true who I really am is more emotive in nature.
 But I, for example, work in a workplace where that's not a cultural value.
 A cultural value is an action or a kinetic oriented language.
 Are you saying that doing a life language profile and it helps me understand, hey, I'm
 I'm more of a feeler, but I can learn to be more of a kinetic spoken language.
 That's not false or fake or contrary to me.
 That's just me practicing good communication.
 Is that right?
 Yes, that is so true.
 Because when you know yourself, then you can make those choices and the powerful choices
 to be able to control what your actions are or the way that you approach things.
 And so that's really a powerful choice to say, in this situation, I'm going to professionalize
 instead of personalize.
 I'm going to set that emotion aside.
 I'm gonna value it.
 I'm not saying it's any less,
 but it's not appropriate at this point in time.
  </li><li>All right.
 Did we talk about some of the,
 I think we did this last week,
 but it's probably worth a revisit to them.
 Is there a way that you could summarize the languages?
 Each language gives some of the defining characteristics
 of what those languages look like?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I'm putting you on the spot, go for it.
  </li><li>All right.
 Well, let's start out with the kinetic category,
 and we'll take a look at the mover life language.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So movers are the people that approach life
 first through motion,
 and then they go on to either thinking or feeling,
 usually probably feeling first and then thinking.
 And movers are about 7% of the population
 that have that life language as their primary
 or first life language.
 And the filter or those glasses that movers wear
 and the way that they see life
 and the way that all incoming communication gets filtered
 through is the filter, what is your motive?
 So if you're talking to a mover,
 the unconscious question that is constantly gonna be playing
 their mind is, well, why is that person asking me that?
 What's their motive in asking that?
 Or what's their motive in doing the action that they're doing?
 Now, is that motive suspicion?
 Or because when I hear, what's your motive?
 I immediately think that is a negative filter.
 And that's a great question.
 And I can see why you would ask that too, because your mover
 isn't one of your top life languages.
 So that's not that filter question is not
 going to be something that you naturally just resonate with.
 So a healthy, healed up mover is going to ask that question
 completely from a neutral perspective.
 They're just gonna say,
 what's the motive that goes along with that?
 A mover that is in distress or someone who is unhealthy
 or on healed up might have something that's attached to that.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But if that's going on,
 they need to listen to some of your other podcasts
 and get that fixed first.
  </li><li>One of our good friends, Ben,
 his high fluency language is the mover language.
 And of course that traditionally has been my lowest language.
 So it's interesting talking to him about like,
 "Hey, when you're thinking what's your motive?"
 He had a brilliant description where he's thinking,
 well, part of what's happening in my heart
 and I'm brewing an excitement, like,
 "Oh, this could be awesome."
 I wonder if we're gonna be co-joined in this venture.
 It wasn't from suspicion, it's from its excitement
 and just checking that I'm not wasting valuable emotion
 on something that might not come to pass.
  </li><li>It still is true,
 because they would be looking at it and going,
 what's the motive behind this?
 So do I want to join with you in this?
 Because if they're not interested
 and they don't think it's innovative and exciting
 and the kind of cutting edge,
 then they're gonna be bored and they're like,
 let's not waste any energy on it.
 So that filter is what is your motive?
 So once you've spoken through that filter,
 you've gone through those red glasses
 that a high movers gonna be wearing.
 And then again, remember that we're looking
 at each of these languages under a microscope.
 So no person is only one language.
 Okay. So if you're a high mover, you'd probably identify with a lot of these things. If you're a
 moderate or a lower mover, you probably would identify with less. The need that a mover has is
 action and congruency. So they want to know that what you're doing and what you're saying is lining
 up and they're going to be consciously or unconsciously, I should say, watching that all the time because
 they want to make sure that that's another kind of something that shows what your motive is.
 So the passion that a mover has is to innovate and one of the character strengths of movers is courage.
 They're incredibly courageous people. A lot of times you'll see them in jobs like a fireman or marine or someone who's right in front of the action,
 you know, jumping into action before they think, before they feel.
 And so they're great. A lot of times in emergency situations. A lot of times you'll see them as an entrepreneur because they're not going to spend all the time researching.
 They're just going to say, hey, I have this idea. I want to innovate. Let's go do it. We'll build a framework later.
 Some of the other major characteristics of movers is that they're innovative,
 they're forceful, and they have high standards.
 And an interesting thing that I find with them is that on the outside,
 they don't appear to be terribly introspective because they're always on the move.
 And they're just, they're the people that are really visible.
 They're not the kind of people that generally get ignored.
 But they're very introspective of asking that same question to themselves.
 What are my motives?
 Am I living up to what the standards that I see?
 Should I should be having for myself?
 That's like an amazing insight.
 I wouldn't have thought.
 They can be incredibly hard on themselves.
 Wow.
 All right.
 Talk to me about the Duhr language.
 All right.
 The Duhr language, about 25% of people have the Duhr as their first or primary life language.
 So they're another language that approaches life first through action and then they'll
 go on to either feeling or thinking.
 Their filter is, are you doing your share?
 So when you're talking to a Duhr, that's that filter that they're experiencing, all
 all that income and communication and all their outgoing communication is going through.
 Their need is appreciation and action.
 So they're not like movers where they're going to be out in front and really visible.
 They're the ones that are behind the scenes getting things done.
 And they won't ask for attention, but they're people that really need to know that you see
 what they're doing, that you appreciate it, and then it's valuable to you, and that you're
 going to come alongside and do what you tend to do your share to.
 For a number of years, I was most fluent in the doer language.
 And whenever we quite enjoy having people over our producers, which we'll come to later,
 are fairly, we're fairly fluent in it.
 So we love hosting parties and having people.
 But as a first language doer for many years when I'd be feeling the dishwasher, I would
 be aware of that filter of like, seriously, you're just going to sit in the sofa, I'm
 just entertaining my house, you're not even going to offer to help.
 And when people would come and help, or even if they didn't help, but just, you're doing
 a great job tidying, the buoyancy of my heart would rise.
 And I'd noticed I'd get increasingly frustrated when people weren't helping or weren't noticing
 that I was doing. I'm married to a high doer. So I understand what that looks like in action.
 It's one of my lowest languages. So if you just learned to throw Marcus a bone, but you're
 doing a great job. I don't mean that in a bad way, but consciously saying you're doing
 a great job. You're doing it because it really does work. I'm not talking about manipulating
 a doer there, but it really does help their heart and encourage them as they're doing
 brilliantly to notice.
 I have definitely noticed that our 12th wedding anniversary is next week and our entire marriage,
 it's always been his job to take out the garbage every week and every single week he wants me
 to notice that he did it and let him know that I saw that he did it, that he did it on time
 the right night and I appreciated it.
 Are you sure you're not talking about my husband?
 I could just be man in general.
 I don't know but I try to make a conscious effort and I have to be conscious about it
 because that's not, since my doer is a lot lower,
 that's not something that I naturally think about.
 I just think, since I'm a high shaper,
 I think, well, that's your responsibility.
 Like, why do I need to suck it up?
 Just get on with it.
 That's what I think.
 I can make a list of everything I did today
 that I don't expect to have somebody compliment me
 for a notice, but since I know that that's a core value to him,
 then I try to consciously notice it and say something to him.
 Because I know that it means a lot.
 And there's something wrong with him
 is just a defining characteristic of his most fluent language.
 Yes.
 And that's helpful to distinguish because often in an age in eyes marriage, for example,
 we will get stuck on that.
 Well, why are you thinking like that?
 And that's...
 Why do you need to be thanked for every little thing?
 You didn't thank me for every little thing.
 Yes.
 But you don't need thanked for every little thing.
 You need support and agreement.
 Don't get too far ahead of your step.
 Sorry, I'm just too excited.
 Okay, when we get to the shape,
 you gotta remind me to tell you a story about the two of us that kind of contrast the shape.
 Okay. All right, continuing on with the doer. So the passion of the doer life language is to
 finish. So to them to leave a project partially done to go on to something else is a horrible
 sin. It's not just a, oh, I, you know, got sidetracked. It's like, no, I have to finish this.
 So sometimes doers aren't great at following schedules because they'll get caught up in a project and not realize the time that that passes.
 And they have incredible energy to continue going until something actually gets done.
 So at night Marcus, my husband does this all the time.
 He'll be working on a project and I'm tired.
 I crash and I'm like, you know, I'm going to bed.
 I'll see you early in the morning.
 And he's totally fine with just staying there working in that project until he's completely finished.
 I've gotten up at 3 o'clock in the morning and seen him still out there working because
 He's going right along with that strength of I'm gonna work until I have this completed right which isn't credible
 They doers are amazing you can when they start working on a task
 You know that it's gonna be done with excellence and then it's gonna be completed
 You're not gonna have to check up on them
 And that's a defining characteristic of Marcus your husband who works at Grace and her is the director of technical ministries
 Anything that ends up on his plate
 he just does brilliantly and you never have to worry if it's going to get done if Mark is on the job.
 Yeah, he don't even have to think about it once a ton. Mark is list.
 Amazing.
 Which goes along with the character strength of doers, which is trustworthiness.
 Major characteristics of the doer are that they're practical, diligent, and detailed.
 All right, let's go on to the emotive languages. So first, let's look at the influencer,
 which is the first of the emotives.
 So they approach life first through their emotions
 and then they move on to thinking and motion almost concurrently.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So influencers account for about 13% of the population
 for their primary life language.
 They are intuitive, inclusive and enthusiastic.
  </li><li>They're pretty much the life and soul of a party.
  </li><li>Yes they are.
 Yep.
 They are the most wonderful people to have with you
 if you're going on a really long road trip.
 Filters.
 The filter for the influencer life language is, are we communicating?
 So they want to know whatever is going on.
 They want to know that you're being heard, that they're being heard, and that we're
 all being heard together and communicating well with each other.
 Their need is affirmation and connectedness.
 So that communication isn't just about talking.
 It's to affirm people, to encourage them and to feel connected with people around them.
 The passion of influencers is to encourage and their character strength is enthusiasm.
 Oh my gosh.
 Yes.
 Responders account for about a third of the population and a full 70% of people have
 responded in their top three languages.
 Good.
 So yes.
 So if there's any language that you want to practice speaking, if you don't have
 natural fluency in it, it is the responder life language.
 Wow.
 Yes.
 which totally makes sense because that's the language of love.
 It's that filter of caring and nurturing and of loving and people.
 So this is the language where if you're not sure what language somebody is,
 you're always going to go well if you start out speaking, responder, and move on from there.
 Wow.
 That's amazing.
 OK.
 Responders are compassionate, they're creative and they're passionate people.
 So their filter is, do you really care?
 So a great thing to say about responders would be they don't care how much you know
 until they know how much you care.
 The need of responders is unconditional acceptance.
 So they want to know that you're gonna love them
 and care about them no matter what they do,
 that it's not based on performance or earning something.
 But that bottom line thing is that you love them,
 that you care and that you're just, that's just it.
  </li><li>Wow.
 Which again makes sense, that's 70% of the people I know.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 (laughing)
 Their passion is to please.
 And so going hand in hand with that, it's they want to know that they're pleasing to you and that who they are and what they do and what they bring at the table.
 Really, really the core of who they are is pleasing.
 And so letting them know that you really care and that you are that they have value is going to speak so much to them.
 The key character strength for responders is compassion.
 So a great example of a responder would probably be someone like Mother Teresa.
 as an extreme example.
  </li><li>That would be an extreme example.
 But for someone who's a high responder,
 especially a healed up responder,
 who's operating out of the identity of love,
 that it would be a natural response to them.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 We have some amazing responders on staff at Grey Center,
 and they stand out.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And like Michelle Vouters or Tony,
 I mean, they just responders to the max,
 but they love Will.
  </li><li>Yeah, they really do.
 It's incredible to watch.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 endless enthusiasm for love and compassion
 with very little thought to personal cost.
  </li><li>Yes, that's so true.
 An interesting comparison between influences
 and responders is an influencer is gonna cheer you on
 and be like, they're gonna be your greatest cheerleader.
 You can do this, you can do this,
 but after a while, if they don't see change,
 they're gonna move on to someone else
 who they think is actually gonna respond to that.
 Whereas a responder will get down in the dirt with you
 and right from your level and be like,
 I'm gonna love on you and believe in you
 until you can do this.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>All right, what comes after the responder?
  </li><li>After the responder comes the shaper life language,
 which is the first of the cognitive life languages.
 So they approach life first through thinking
 and then they go on to either movement or emotion.
 So often a high shaper will actually tell their emotions
 what they're gonna feel.
 So they have to feel first and decide what they think about
 how they feel and then they'll start feeling what they feel.
  </li><li>AJ, does that sound familiar?
  </li><li>That sounds absolutely correct.
  </li><li>AJ for the record is a 90-something percent.
  </li><li>93.04 I think?
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Percent, shape or so.
 It's not unusual for what the moment when AJ does emote,
 for AJ to not know why she's emoting.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I remember one time we were driving down the road
 and you do all the driving in our relationship
 and I looked over and you were crying.
 And I was like, babe, what's wrong?
 like, I don't know, I'm just crying. I haven't worked out why yet. I was like, dear God,
 you're a cyborg, sent from the future. I love you.
 And that probably goes hand in hand with your contemplator a second, right? Yes. So the two
 of them will play together much like that. I've experienced the same thing because those
 are my top two also. I do. I like to. Yeah. I thought you were pretty excellent. Can I
  </li><li>I might interject on that point,
 'cause you guys are joking about that.
 But is that a real thing that people with similar languages
 are drawn to other people with similar languages,
 or is that neither here nor there?
  </li><li>That's a really interesting topic,
 'cause I've thought about this a lot.
 I think that there is a certain amount of draw
 because initially like she makes so much sense to me
 that way, but I've noticed looking at my closer friendships,
 Most of my close friendships are people who are high responders or influencers.
 But isn't that just because 70% of the population, you know, you're taking any sample.
 There's going to be more responders than not.
 True. But that's still a responder in the top three languages.
 So only a third of people are going to have responders.
 They're number one, their primary life language.
 Where's your responder out of interest?
 Right now it is my fourth.
 Okay.
 So it's still quite high.
 And you're fluent in it.
 Okay, so you're floon in there.
 That makes sense, okay.
  </li><li>It's interesting, the last couple of times
 I've taken my profile, my responder went way up
 when our daughter was born, and then it has dropped back
 down a little bit, but people that I'm in close relationship
 with say that they're actually experiencing me more
 as a responder now than they used to.
 And I think a lot of it is just the more that I'm practicing
 all the different languages, the more I naturally pull that up
 when I'm in a personal time.
  </li><li>Right.
 I'm by myself or I'm in total task mode.
 That responder is, it's just not, it's way, way down.
 It's having a nap.
  </li><li>There's a misconception, I think,
 and please correct me if I'm wrong,
 that you just use an example there,
 for example, when I'm in shaper mode,
 forget me speaking the responder language.
 But often, just because you're in shaper mode
 doesn't mean the motive of why you're in shaper mode
 isn't love.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 So I'm very diligent in my doer language when I'm preparing stuff.
 But the reason I'm preparing is out of deep affection for the students I'm about to teach.
 And I think sometimes there's been a misunderstanding that only responders love.
 It's just everybody loves, but your love looks different through your languages.
 Is that right?
 Yes.
 And that is so beautifully put and so important to remember because it's so easy to start
 labeling people as you are this or you are that.
 And we have to remember this is just looking at a snapshot
 of their preferred method of communicating
 or looking at the world.
 So your mode over the reason that you're doing something
 is going to be different things to different people.
 But just because your responder is lower,
 like in your case doesn't mean that that underlying love
 is not the reason why you're doing what you're doing.
 Which knowing you and knowing you,
 what's it been now, six years I think?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I can definitely say that that is exactly how I would experience you.
 All right.
 The filter for a shaper is do you have a plan?
 Right.
 And I think probably during the first seminar I went to, this was about the
 moment that I started to have this light bulb, well, light bulb, aha moment of,
 oh my goodness, this gets me because all of my life that has been my constant
 question to anything that's happening around me.
 Well, do you have a plan or what is the plan?
 Do we have a plan?
 Can I make a plan?
 So the shapers looking through that filter with everything.
 So even if a shaper is on vacation, they still want to know that there's a plan to relax.
 And maybe there's a plan to have no plan, but that's still a plan and they're probably
 going to be happy with that.
 And it's totally innate.
 It's not something a shaper decides to do.
 It's always there.
 There's always a plan or a need for a plan.
 And it doesn't feel weird to us at all.
 At all.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 I have a question from one high shaper to another high shaper.
 Do you view life in time segments?
 Like I pretty much view my day in 15 minute segments
 and in my mind I call them units.
 So I kind of assign like,
 oh that's gonna take me two units of time to do that
 or three units of time and they're 15 minute equipment.
  </li><li>I'm telling you she's a cyborg from the future.
 Don't anger it, whatever you do.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Well, I don't call them units but.
  </li><li>Is that because you're human?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>You're carbon based.
 I hope I'm human.
 But I have all my adult life looked at my time during the day
 and 15 minute increments.
 See?
 See?
 It's a beautiful thing.
 We're having a moment.
 Yeah.
 The warm fuzzies right now.
 And then what's bad is because my doer is quite up there.
 I will then with my doer filter of are you doing your share,
 I assess it based on units.
 Of course.
 Of course.
 So I'm like, you think you did a task,
 but it was a one unit task.
 I did a three unit task and so we are not even.
  </li><li>At this point, could everybody who's listening
 please pray for me?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yes.
 So let's look at the needs of a shaper.
  </li><li>Oh please.
  </li><li>And that way, Alan, you're gonna know even more.
  </li><li>Clinical care?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Perhaps.
  </li><li>I was gonna suggest a stiff drink,
 but I don't know if we could say that.
 Coffee, no, not coffee.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>That's the last thing a shaper needs.
 All right.
 So what a shaper needs is support and agreement.
 That's right.
 So they want to know that you support their plan and that you agree with their plan.
 Their passion is to lead and they have patience for the plan.
 Not necessarily the people involved in the plan, but the plan itself.
 So most shapers are going to have a plan for what they're going to do this morning and
 this afternoon, tomorrow, this week, the month, the year.
 probably have a two, three, four, five, 10, 20.
 I'm thinking about what I want to do
 and when I retire someday.
 And that seems quite logical to me.
  </li><li>Yeah, how many units is that way?
  </li><li>Centive role.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>A lot.
 So shaper is gonna look at that overall big plan.
 So like comparing a shaper and a doer,
 doers are looking at what needs to happen
 right in front of them.
 So if they have a list,
 there's probably gonna be just a few things on it
 that they can complete in maybe a morning or maybe a day.
 Whereas a shaper, their list is gonna include
 much more units.
 It's gonna be a much larger time segment.
 So comparing shapers and doers reminds me
 of when my husband and I first got married
 and we got back from a honeymoon and decided,
 okay, we gotta go shopping, we don't have any food.
 We're just moving into this teeny little apartment.
 So I'm going, all right, well, we gotta do this.
 It's a necessary evil.
 We'll make a list, we'll check it twice, we'll get in, we'll get out, we'll get on with it.
 Whereas my husband, who is a high doer, is looking at it going, "This is going to be
 a shared experience."
 So we went in for that first day of shopping and at the time his responder was also quite
 high.
 It was just all about, "We're caring for each other, we're spreading this time together."
 We literally went up and down every single aisle in the entire grocery store.
 We compared brands and prices.
 if we had an incubons, and what kind of, you know,
 flower didn't his family use growing up,
 and what kind of flower did my family use,
 and what kind of flower were we going to use?
 And by the end of literally, I think it was like three hours.
 It felt like three or four weeks to me.
 We leave the store.
  </li><li>I would have died.
  </li><li>The whole time, you know, we leave the store,
 and he's going, "Oh, honey, wasn't that wonderful?
 "We just shared this experience
 "we're creating this life together.
 "I feel so love, this is amazing."
 And I'm going, does my husband even love me?
 Because we just, we look at things very differently
 and I really thought there was something wrong with him.
  </li><li>You were thinking, I need to find a shallow grave.
 I need to place the height of body.
 This can't go on.
  </li><li>And then I went to that first seminar
 and learned about how the shapers
 are having that long range plan
 and doers are all about the practical needs
 and the things that are right in front of them.
 And I realized we were just two ships passing in the night.
  </li><li>Right.
 Suddenly after just one seminar, I went home and went,
 there's nothing wrong with him
 and there's nothing wrong with me.
 We just really approach life in two totally different ways.
 And if we can make these two things work together,
 we're gonna be dynamite, right?
 All right, so producer life language.
 Producer is usually the most rare of all life languages.
 Only about 3% of the population have producer
 as their primary life language.
  </li><li>Wow. - So that's a
 their rare breed.
  </li><li>They're the unicorn tears of life languages.
  </li><li>Basically. - Yep.
 Yes.
 So their filter is, are you managing your life?
 So they wanna know that you're managing
 all the resources that you have, your time, your energy,
 anything that you have responsibility for,
 they wanna know that you're gonna manage that really well.
 So they tend to be financial, hospitable, and resourceful.
 Their need is appreciation and quality gifts.
 So a lot of times their love language would be gifts.
 So gift giving, gift receiving,
 they wanna know that the gift that they're giving
 is going to be something that is high quality and uniquely suited just for that person.
 Wow.
 Do they like to receive the same types of gifts as well?
 They often do, yes.
 Right.
 So, a lot of times they love to have people over, they love to take care of people, and
 they just have an appreciation for things that are excellent.
 That makes sense.
 A high producer will often manage their life that way.
 In fact, out of any of the life languages, they're the ones that are most likely to retire
 with financial dignity.
 So that a lot of times they have a really natural way of dealing with finances, which
 coincidentally about 3% of the population retires with financial dignity.
 So interesting if there's a...
 That is interesting.
 Yes.
 The key character strength for producers is resourcefulness.
 I'd say so.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 The final life language is the contemplator life language.
 So they're approaching life first through thinking and then usually they feel, then they think,
 than they do some more feeling than they think and then they may move on to action.
 About 10% of the population has a contemplator as their primary life language.
 The filter that they approach life through is, "Am I interested?"
 A higher contemplator, if they're not naturally interested in something that's going on around
 them, will probably retreat inward and start thinking about something else.
 They may have to be telling themselves, "I am interested in the things that are happening
 around them to make sure that they're staying engaged.
 That was my later adult life.
 I think once I found this out, I was like, I can coach myself.
 I'm interested, remain interested.
 I'm not interested.
 No, remain interested.
 Don't be thinking about, Oh, look, I'm not interested.
 Oh, I'm going to go back to being interested.
 Yeah.
 I think having an iPhone helped my
 conan player enormously because in those idle moments, in those
 down times when I'd retreated, I could just, you know, entertain myself.
 And then that would give me enough juice to come back into
 real life. That's like a crutch or a strategy.
 To rejoin the population.
 Well, I think it could be both. It depends on if you're trying to use it to escape or...
 I don't like any more. Keep going.
 Sorry.
 He has the truth hurts. He's probably going to edit that part out.
 No, I'm with you, sorry.
 All right, moving on. The cat-emplator needs personal space and quality time,
 which is a really interesting dichotomy.
 And sometimes it can be a little bit of a challenge
 to even know what they need.
 Because they'll be like, oh, you know,
 I need some space.
 And then, oh, you know, actually, that was maybe
 a little bit too much space.
 Now I need some quality time.
 In fact, someone we know who's a really high-contemplator.
 His favorite way of spending time with his family
 is that they're all together in the living room,
 reading a book or the newspaper,
 doing something on their phones.
 But they're physically with each other,
 but not necessarily interacting.
  </li><li>That sounds like ideal.
  </li><li>That is us.
 I just want to be in the same room.
 I don't care for getting our work done on our computers or whatever.
 As long as we're in the same room, I'm fine.
 Absolutely.
 Their passion is to know.
 So if they're interested in something, they want to know everything there
 possibly is to know about that.
 And if you ask them about it, they will happily share with you all of those
 details.
 So a lot of times they make really, really good teachers because they have
 so much information kind of at their fingertips and of out of all the life
 languages, they're the only one that has any correlation with higher IQs.
 Wow.
 Is there any correlation between male and female with or any statistics?
 Not that I know of, but something you'll see a lot of times with
 contemplators is that they'll have facial hair.
 They'll say they have beards often.
 Yes, which my theory is.
 Hopefully not the women.
 Yeah.
 If if you are a woman, you can and you have that, you should probably talk to
 somebody about that.
 Yeah, that would be good.
 Yes.
 My theory is that the beard gives them a little bit of extra space between them and the world.
 Yeah, it's an interpersonal buffer.
 I can see that.
 That was very comprehensive.
 One thing we miss though, go on, is the key character strength of loyalty.
 Uh, they are extremely loyal people and often they'll have friends for life.
 That that was very comprehensive.
 Thank you for covering that.
 One of the stories that you told about Marcus and yourself, but you know, the
 story about you getting married and going shopping.
 I would imagine that when you're stuck with another human being,
 like you are in marriage or at work or whatever,
 there's bound to be conflicts.
 So one of the things you've taught us over the years is the tool called cross talks.
 Can you explain what a cross talk is and how you work them out and what it does for you?
 Yes, I love cross talks because as a visual learner in which this will be the challenges
 describing something that I can't actually show everyone.
 We can put things in the show notes.
 like if you've got images that we can link to, just send them to me, we'll put them in the
 show notes.
 Perfect.
 I've got to link them.
 So the incredible tool of a crosstalk really gives you a 3D picture of what two profiles
 look like next to each other.
 Okay.
 So if you're going to construct a crosstalk, you would draw two vertical lines and give
 dashes on them from 1 to 100, I would, you know, 10, 20, 30, 40.
 And then you would line up each of those life languages side by side.
 So for example, if your shaper is a 93 like AJ,
 as you'd put a little notch at that 93 on one of the vertical lines,
 and then you would take the other-- the language
 and draw the shaper line at whatever that number is,
 and then draw a line between them.
 So you end up getting this picture of what those really look like,
 which is really interesting thinking about what both of your profiles look
 like set up as a crosstalk.
 Because your top through languages are the same.
 So you would think, oh, they're going
 be that's going to look the same in application. But when you put that in a cross talk and you
 can see that AJ's shaper as her first language is, I think it's like 25 points higher than
 your shaper, then you can see that actually she's going to that filter is going to be that much
 more intense or that much more clear in the way that she's following the characteristics of the
 shaper life language. So we re-profile ourselves this week. What are the results?
 Did you have a chance to look at them and find out if there are any changes in us?
 I did.
 And interestingly enough, when I put both of those profiles side by side and did the cross
 talks, you guys only have four cross talks between the two of you.
 So to find out how many cross talks you have after you have drawn all of the different
 languages along those vertical lines and draw the lines between them, you count the number
 of times that a line intersects and then you take it times two since there's two people
 involved.
 And that tells you how different or how similar your life languages are.
 So a lower number, more similar, a higher number, less similar.
 Exactly.
 Can you extrapolate that a higher number means there's more opportunity for misunderstanding
 and conflict?
 Yes and no.
 If you have a higher number, you're going to be more different.
 So you're probably going to have to be a little bit more intentional in understanding that
 the other person's filter and their needs and the way they approach life.
 you'll probably have less blind spots where you have languages shared between you that
 are much lower.
 Explain to me blind spots.
 For example, with my husband and I's cross talk, we have some big cross talks with Mike
 Shaper being really high, his Shaper being low, and vice versa with the doer.
 We both have mover low.
 Since that's low for both of us, it means that that could be a potential blind spot.
 We have to be a lot more aware of some of those characteristics of the mover to make
 sure that not only are we communicating with people around us, but we know, okay, so, you
 know, movers are more innovative.
 They're on the front edge of things.
 They're taking more risks.
 We are not nationally.
 I see.
 Okay.
 So we have to make sure we pull that mover up to be able to accomplish different things
 and to be more well rounded to.
 So looking at your crosstalk with you being that much more similar, it doesn't necessarily
 mean that things are going to be easier or harder.
 Just you have to be aware of the fact that you're going to have a lot of those similar
 strengths, but you might have some of the similar blind spots or weaknesses.
 So having two high shapers together is brilliant if you guys both have the same plan.
 But if you have differing plans, sparks can fly, but not quite the kind that you might
 be looking for.
 That's the first couple of years of our marriage right there.
 Yeah, that was before we had any understanding of this.
 But even to this day, if we have differing plans,
 you're hitting the nail on the head on that one.
 And it's trying to process not who's got the better plan,
 but how it works.
 Because clearly I have the better plan.
 Well, but in all seriousness,
 one of the traits of a shaper is they don't have to lead
 if there's somebody who's leading well
 and is a strong leader.
 And so you naturally have a much higher shaper than I do.
 And so you are concerned about, typically in our life,
 you're concerned about things I don't even care about.
 And so it's to your benefit that you get to shape
 those things and I don't care as long as we're being done.
 So how would somebody do their own cross talk at home?
  </li><li>So you would draw two vertical lines side by side
 and then put your hash marks on there
 for 10, 20, 30, 40 up to 100.
 And then you would start with one person's profile
 on the left and just mark each language
 next to whatever that number is
 and then do the person on the right
 and then you would connect each language together.
 So, shaper the shaper, responder with responder,
 then you would count the number of times
 the lines intersect and take it times two
 since there's two profiles involved
 and that will give you a number of cross talks.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So you can have anywhere from zero to 42.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Good night.
 And we have four.
  </li><li>You have four.
  </li><li>So we actually have two multiplied by two
 and we have four?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Wow, that's staggering.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It'd be interesting to see because we've got
 all our older profiles have they gone up or down?
 I'd imagine they've gone down.
  </li><li>It's actually changed a lot.
 I think that one of your first cross talks
 that I saw maybe from that first seminar,
 there was like 30 or so, 32 maybe.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Although the way that your profile is Alan,
 it used to be that you had so many of those languages
 close together in the middle
 and there's a lot of compression in the middle.
 So that would kind of artificially create more cross talks
 just because the nature of those being so close together.
  </li><li>That makes sense.
 So find somebody you want to cross talk with and get your flight rule out.
 Yes.
 Or if you like, I can give you a link that I have a printable that people can print
 from my website that will give you actually a printed out blank cross.
 Do you hear that, ladies and gentlemen?
 If you go to the show notes for this episode, Alan, a.g.
 dot com slash 77, we'll put a link to Allison's life language resources and you
 can download your own template to do a cross talk.
 She'd done all the hard work for you.
 There you go.
 Perfect.
 Here's one of the things we'd love to encourage you to do.
 If you haven't already taken a life language profile, if you go to Alan
 AJ.com/77, you will find a link there to Allison's website where you can take a profile yourself.
 You can encourage your loved ones to take a profile.
 Allison has been very generous in running a promotion the end later this week.
 You can get $5 off your profile, but we'd highly encourage you to take a profile.
 It's incredibly powerful to have understanding of yourself and the profile that you
 receive instantly, by the way, once you've taken the profile, the report that you get
 is so thorough and so detailed, and we've really just scratched the surface and having
 Alison talk about the Seven Life Languages, but there's a whole wealth of information
 there that will really help you understand yourself.
 And if you give yourself to it, it's incredibly helpful in understanding the people around
 you, your spouse, your boss, the people you work for.
 And in many ways, Alison talked about this earlier, it really is like having a light bulb
 go on above your head and go, "Ahh!" And we just love it to pieces. All our students,
 all our staff have found it incredibly helpful and we'd encourage you to do the same thing.
 Well, Alison, where can people contact you if they want more information?
 The best place to probably be at the website, which is www.taproot7, the number seven.com,
 which I'm excited early next year. We're rolling out a totally new website and going to do a lot of
 exciting things with that, like some free consultations and profile stuff.
 So if you're interested, you can also sign up for the newsletter there and you'll get
 information as soon as that's up.
 And you're on Twitter as well?
 I am.
 It's Ali Hendrickson.
 Ali Hendrickson.
 We'll put a link to it in the show notes as well.
 Well, Alison, we just want to thank you for coming on the show and lending us your expertise
 and your wisdom and your passion for communication.
 It certainly shows as you chat about it.
 the hand gestures.
 I'm like, the things that nobody can see.
 If only they could see the hand gestures.
 Thank you guys so much for having me.
 It's been so much fun.
 So good.
 All right.
 Well, if you want to look at the show notes for show 77, you will see all the goodies
 that we've been talking about and all the links.
 So go ahead and do that.
 Next week is a week of Thanksgiving.
 So we're actually going to be here.
 We're going to be taking a break and reflecting on all the things we're thankful for.
 But that does not mean we will leave you high and dry.
 We will have a treat for you to next week for some very special people.
 running our podcast, the regular service will resume the week after.
 And the discount, as I said earlier, is still eligible for this week.
 If you've already taken your life language profile, why not buy one for a
 family member or a loved one?
 It's a great way to invest in your relationships.
 Have a fantastic Thanksgiving.
 All of America.
 We love you guys.
 We'll catch up with you in two weeks time.
 Bye.
