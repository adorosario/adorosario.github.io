<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones yes how are you i'm well how are you i've had a fantastic week as have you yes i have filled with adventure friendships joy and departing students very true we had quite the week at the school supernatural life we really did and i actually can't believe it was just this week it feels like it was too much.
 weeks ago. It was like local pastor team awesome. Extra have again. We had Alex and Henry
 Sealy from the belonging. Yeah. And they were teaching on year two. Yes. And they were fantastic.
 Goodness gracious. They're amazing. Just dropping bombs of wisdom. Oh, it was astonishing to
 have them that students love them. And they're also so cool. They are. They're very cool. And
 they're not just veneer cool. Like they don't just look cool. No, they're legit cool. They've
 They've got such an amazing story, which I would love to have them on the podcast.
 Same.<br/>
 It would be awesome.<br/>
 It would be very good.<br/>
 So that was year two.<br/>
 Meanwhile, in year one, Mr.<br/>
 Lyle Phillips was holding court with his beautiful wife, Allison Phillips, and baby Isaiah.
 Oh, he's so cute.<br/>
 You guys will already know Lyle.<br/>
 He was on episode 37 and episode 38.<br/>
 If you haven't had a chance to listen to them, go to allonag.com/37 or/38 for one of
 most radical stories ever.<br/>
 Yeah, very, very cool story.<br/>
 And so we had Lyle in speaking on missions.
 And if ever you're going to have a person gear people up to go to the
 nations, it's that boy there.<br/>
 Slap you around with missions.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 The one.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Unbelievable.<br/>
 Full of zeal, full of energy.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then he spoke at emanate Monday night.
 So good.<br/>
 I was so convicted.<br/>
 Were you?<br/>
 I thought his whole message was directly at me.
 OK.<br/>
 I thought it was just absolutely superb.
 Now, what were your main takeaways?<br/>
 And he was talking about what look at the amazing things God can do with the perhaps right like moving yourself into God's court to risk things.
 But the stand out line, which I'm going to give him credit for two or three times, and then I'm taking it as my rival.
 Is when he said Abraham wanted God to give him a son, God wanted to give him a legacy.
 Yeah, I was like, oh my gosh.<br/>
 Yeah, how true is that to?<br/>
 So the other thing Lyle said was, if the only time we dream is when we hear other people's testimony, we are insulting God's creativity.
 Wow.<br/>
 So he was just talking about dreaming with God and how important that is and how God's vision of your life is so much bigger than your vision of your life.
 Right.<br/>
 I mean, it was just a great, fantastic message and it was absolutely superb.
 And I think that's totally true.<br/>
 Like we've said this before, but I never would have dreamed us here.
 No, not at all.<br/>
 And I know here it's not like we've arrived.
 It's going to keep going and growing, you know.
 But everything that we've seen God do and everything God's given us is far beyond what we would have asked.
 So far beyond.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And that's why last week's topic was all about how awesome future is because look how awesome that's been up to this point.
 Right.<br/>
 God's track record of being good is pretty staggering.
 Yeah, for sure.<br/>
 We should probably just do a sidebar moment and ask the beard update.
 What do you think of the beard?<br/>
 It's very fuzzy.<br/>
 It is so fuzzy.<br/>
 at the moment i feel like wolverine you look at that like wolverine it's
 wait i'm in my shirt back up<br/>
 there we go what about now especially at the bottom of your beard where it's
 sort of<br/>
 kind of<br/>
 blending into your neck i'm glad you said
 of the beard<br/>
 i wonder where you're going with that darling it's very fluffy yeah it is really
 fun i'm gonna try and trim it tonight but i don't have beard trimmers i just have
 hair clippers oh dear that should work though right i don't know i've never had
 a beard. All right, moving on. Actually, Thursday was a big day. I went and had some ministry
 Thursday morning. I booked myself in for a heart sink and got Minister 2 for a couple hours.
 And how was that? That was really good. As with all ministry, you can't judge the
 effectiveness of ministry in the two hours that it happens. You have to evaluate from the fruit
 of your life following. But it was great. I love the people that I did the ministry with. They
 They were just fantastic and it was nice to be on the receiving end of ministry.
 Yeah, it's great, isn't it?<br/>
 Yeah, oh, it's wonderful.<br/>
 It's so good as pastors and leaders to take time out from ministering to others to be
 minister to yourself.<br/>
 We learned that from John and Carol.<br/>
 They were huge proponents of getting a tune up every now and then.
 It was great to just sit down and let other ministers prod around in the garden of my
 soul.<br/>
 Did you know I hung out with D-Wags on Thursday?
 I did.<br/>
 Well, yeah, I did know that.<br/>
 but we never talked about it because life just got so busy.
</p><ul>
  <li>It was amazing.
  </li><li>How was that?
  </li><li>Fantastic, David Wagner was in town for a night.
 And so he's damn in town, let's go grab coffee.
 So I caught up with David,
 who has just come back from an amazing time at Bethel,
 which if we have time to do this as questions,
 we've got a fantastic question about Bethel,
 which I'm gonna be only too happy to answer.
 But anyway, David was in town,
 just gonna love that guy.
 Again, if you haven't listened to our David Wagner podcast,
 I'm sorry for all these plugs,
 but they're for your own good,
 like just some of the most amazing stories.
 You can find David Wagner's podcast
 at allenanag.com/wagner.
 He got his own vanity URL because he's dewags money.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
  </li><li>And then Thursday, all of our students
 from the school of supernatural life went on outreach.
  </li><li>Yes, they flew off all over the world.
  </li><li>Well, some of them didn't fly.
  </li><li>Well, some of them just drove off all over the world,
 the American world.
 We have three teams here in the USA.
 Yes, one in Auburn.
 One in...
 Wait, wait, wait, Auburn.
 I know something about Auburn.
 That's football.
 That's... you say go War Eagles or something like that.
 That's right.
 Way to go, baby.
 Thank you.
 And then we have one in Jackson, Mississippi.
 Do you know anything about their sports teams?
 Yes, they have the...
 Yeah, something purple, maybe.
 It's the purple Panthers.
 Yeah, them.
 Yeah, they're my favorite NFL team.
 And...
 I love hockey.
 I love hockey.
 And then we have an at-home team in Nashville that's ministering in different places in Nashville, which I love that we're getting to bless now.
 Same.
 Because we love our city.
 I think it's amazing.
 And then we have four international teams.
 Yeah, we have a couple teams in Europe, one in Iceland and one in England and Scotland.
 Yeah, I'm a little concerned that the Iceland team is not going to come back.
 They are posting like crazy about the coffee and the food and the northern lights and how wonderful the people are.
 And I'm like, yeah, I remember, I remember thinking, oh, I love this place.
 To all our Iceland listeners, we love you and we miss you greatly.
 It saddened me when your time hop opened up and today, years ago today, we were in Iceland.
 Yeah.
 Although it thrills me that we've sent other people, but I really miss Iceland.
 Yeah. I'm so badly want to go.
 Father, we'd like to go back this year.
 Amen. There we go.
 Amen.
 And we have a team out in South Africa with past a surprise.
 Yes.
 And again, sorry to do this. We're not trying to totally troll you about our podcast, but
 If you go to allenag.com/75, you'll listen to our podcast that we did with surprise,
 pass a surprise and pass a frenzy. I guarantee you've never heard stories like it.
 No, it's amazing. People being raised from the dead left right and center.
 So that's where our team is with them. Have fun guys in South Africa.
 Yeah, they must be having a riot. And then last but by no means least,
 Australia. Yeah, we have a team in Sydney and they'll go on to be in Melbourne with Gary and
 Sarah in a week's time or so.
 And you guessed it, if you missed the podcast with Gary and Sarah.
 I'm so sorry.
 You absolutely want to do yourself a favor and listen to that.
 Go to allen and aj.com/90 to hear the podcast with Gary and Sarah Morgan, just two of our
 best friends, two of our favorite people in the whole world, and you'd be super blessed.
 Listen, if you've just started listening to our podcast, honestly, if you listen to
 the ones I've mentioned, your mind will be blown.
 I guarantee you.
 If you don't want your mind blown, I can't help you.
 So to all our teams who are out there around the world,
 Adrian, I just want to send our love and say, well done.
 You guys are doing such a great job.
 Well done ministering on behalf of Grace Center.
 Our leaders who are leading the team, we're so proud of you.
 You guys have done such a great job.
 We're praying for you every day and catching up with you on social media.
 We're already getting emails and Facebook posts back from the pastors that are hosting
 the teams, just saying what a blessing they are and how amazing they are.
 We're like, "We know, we're so proud of them."
 So yeah, it's so good.
  </li><li>What else happened this week?
  </li><li>I got a new grill.
  </li><li>You did get a new grill.
  </li><li>I'm so stoked.
 I've had two Quiz and Art grills, and I've liked them.
 But my first one lasted about seven years,
 and the last one lasted less than three
 before the heating element started dying.
  </li><li>To be fair, you do use it every day.
  </li><li>Every day, yeah.
 Either making pancakes or grilled cheese sandwiches
 or something on it every day.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 recently because it's been too cold to grill outside. We've been doing grill zucchini and grilling
 meat on them. Yeah. So it went the way of the dodos and you decided that it would be good to get
 one that's maybe a little heartier. Well, all came from the fact that I think I learned
 this from my dad. My dad is a great contemplator before purchasing things. He's a man who would do
 tons of research and buy few things, but the things he did buy were really high quality.
 And I remember admiring my dad for that, just even as a young age, just watching him always do
 research. And we knew that whenever magazines came out and there was lots of biopend circling
 things, we knew that a new purchase was coming, whether it was a stereo or a VCR or whatever.
 And so a number of years ago we needed to replace your food processor you had just a cheap,
 you know, $50 food processor.
 And again, you use that.
 Every day almost every day.
 Yeah, probably at least four or five times a week.
 Yeah.
 And so when it came time to replace to my favorite websites are the sweet home.com and the wire car.com both run by the same people.
 Right.
 The wire cutter is kind of a nerdy gadget review site.
 So if ever I'm going to buy anything, I check there.
 The sweet home is the same idea, but for home items like irons and scissors and pillowcases.
 And so, you know, when we were replacing your food processor, the one they said was the best
 one was this Quiznar one. And it was really reasonable. It was about a hundred bucks, I think.
 And then they said, hey, if you need something that can have more content shoved in it, or you're
 a heavy user, consider upgrading to this Breville one, which was four times the price.
 It was like $400.
 So nobody wants to spend $400 on a food process.
 No.
 Well, you do, but nobody, I'm thinking, just think I'm going to eat other things I could
 buy with that.
 That's crazy talk.
 So when we went to Macy's and we compared just to just even the feel and the look of
 them, I was like, okay, these are two completely different build quotes.
 Anyway, cut a long story short.
 bought the Breville one and we managed to negotiate down to a nice price.
 I forget what you pay for it.
 You Scottish them down to almost half the price.
 I did Scottish them down.
 And it's been well worth it.
 Oh, that's my point.
 Yeah.
 It was well worth paying more than twice of what we were going to pay for something that to this day
 you still use all the time.
 You get great pleasure from.
 It's never broken.
 And so we saw.
 Brilliant.
 Yeah.
 Let's sink some coinage into something that you're going to use every day.
 So we ordered you a Breville smart griller.
 Yes, we did.
 I was built like a tank.
 It is.
 It's huge.
 It's a lot bigger than the Quiz note, which also means I can do a lot more pancakes at once
 because the surface is larger.
 And you can I could filet mignon tonight in about three minutes on it.
 Oh, so good.
 And it was delicious.
 So good.
 Let's go eat some more.
 Oh, my gosh.
 So anyway, yes, you got a grill.
 I can't believe we took some time to talk about the world.
 But there you go.
 That is our life.
 I'm sorry.
 If you don't like grills, you can come back now.
 And then yesterday we had a fabulous family day.
 Yeah, we did.
 We took the whole family to see Zootopia, Disney's new animated movie, which was really,
 really good.
 But my favorite part of all of it was it was MJ's first time in a theater, MJ's three years old.
 And we walked in.
 It was a really big movie theater.
 the screen was massive, the biggest screen he's ever seen. And so when we're walking,
 I'm MJ, you were about to see the biggest TV that you've ever seen in your life. So
 it's in the dark, we're walking in, we turn the corner, he sees the massive screen and
 he looks at me and he says, "Is this my life?" And I was like, "I'm going to eat you now,
 you incredibly cute three-year-old." And then when we sat down and he found out that
 the chairs would recline and swing up and down. And he wasn't quite weighty enough to stop
 No, so it kept holding him in half.
 But the lights would go down and the music started and he nudged me and looked up at me and said, "Daddy, is this my life?"
 And I was like, "Yes, son, this is your life."
 "Behold the movie theater."
 So cute.
 So adorable.
 And then in the afternoon, we went out to Mr. Bill's to see cows.
 -We did. -We were so happy about it.
 So he got to pat a cow and a donkey and a horse.
 So it was basically as good as taking him to the zoo.
 That's all three food groups in some kind of.
 Gosh.
 And then you finish speaking this morning.
 I did.
 I did.
 On Sunship.
 What's it like speaking a message split over two Sundays?
 It was a little tough because you need to have some extra time to bring everybody up
 to speed that wasn't there the previous week.
 Right.
 So, you know, I asked them at the beginning, hey, who wasn't here last week?
 And there was a good 100 hands that went up and I went, "Alright, well here's like a
 brief update but you can watch on YouTube, you know, both sermons obviously."
 And then away we went.
 Well, I heard great feedback.
 I'll put a link on the show notes if you want to listen to AJ teach on sunship, five
 stages of sunship.
 Yeah, it was really fun.
 Alright, our topic for this week, we've ostensibly called this life hacks but they're really
 not life hacks.
 used to life hacks on Buzzfeed or you find them on Facebook, they're way more sophisticated
 than the ones we're talking about. Basically, we wanted to talk about how we have decided
 to eradicate friction from our lives. How we do what we do, how we pull off what we
 pull off. Yeah, just some of the things that we found helpful. I think it all started because
 I realized that the biggest stressors in my life is not leading a school of ministry
 or helping pastor church or those things are not stressful to me.
 What's stressful is trying to leave the house and not knowing where your kid's shoes are.
 The same shoes they were wearing a mere couple of hours ago.
 And they're useless. They're like an ashtray on a motorbike.
 They're just, "I don't know when we're shoes."
 "Oh, they've got no clue."
 This is absolutely an end to that point.
 So I realized that friction causes me stress.
 hurdles to my way to achieving things cause me stress.
 So we started eliminating friction in order to eliminate stress.
 Yeah.
 And they're not glamorous.
 Like the first thing was setting up automatic payments for your monthly bills.
 Right.
 I have never forgotten to pay my mortgage because I never have to remember.
 I set it up the first time we bought a house and every month it just automatically
 debits my account and saving my phone bill, my gas bill, my book, because nothing is
 worse than opening.
 I mean, oh, I completely forgot to do that.
 So we just automate all of that.
 Yeah.
 In a similar way, what other things in our lives could we automate?
 Or I say automate like an American.
 I don't even know how you'd say it as a Scottish person.
 Automate.
 Baby, you just offended large slaves of people.
 And that's not even right.
 I'll work on it.
 Let me try automate.
 I'm automate automate.
 I'm a.
 So anyway, we've worked hard at automating things.
 So to solve the shoe problem, we spent $30 on a wicker basket
 and it sits by the door that we come in.
 And as soon as we come in,
 everybody kicks her shoes off, goes into the basket.
 And hopefully when we leave the shoes are still there.
  </li><li>Hopefully.
  </li><li>It is reduced to friction by about 90%.
 There's still--
  </li><li>There's still moments of friction.
  </li><li>One out of 10 times where,
 I don't know where my shoes are.
  </li><li>Well, they're not in the basket.
  </li><li>They're in our bed.
 At that point, it's like, you know what?
 put Ziploc bags on your feet and tie rubber bands around them, that should do.
 That'll teach you.
 Yeah, we also have things like hanging racks in the garage where that may not seem to automate
 life or to help with life, but what it did was get a whole bunch of clutter out of our
 way so that we can get in the garage and there's no friction of opening doors and all that
 kind of stuff.
 We have space.
 Opening a garage door, but not opening it too far in case you hit something right and then sucking in all the air
 And then hoping the kids don't trip on the way and actually rather than throwing out a bunch of stuff in our garage
 We just paid to store it somewhere
 Well, we throw a lot of stuff. I know as much as I'd like though. Oh, well now I have space for my shop
 When ever I get to start building you have to explain what a shop is because that's a very North American vernacular
 Well, I have a whole bunch of power tools and a desire to build.
 And so as soon as I get some lumber, which I'm going to negotiate for later, I'm going
 to start building stuff.
 Well, speaking of garage, one of the first things we did, garage, garage.
 Gaddage.
 Gaddage is how we'd say.
 But speaking about the garage, what I'd realized is the only time I go into the garage when
 it's not for getting in the car is to take garbage out or recycling.
 Yeah.
 is when I open the door, I always have to turn the light on.
 Now, it sounds ridiculous.
 Sounds like a first world problem.
 Oh, you have to turn your light on.
 It is the first world problem.
 When you've got your hands full of garbage bags or recycling bags,
 if you could eliminate the friction of having a turn of light on and off again,
 yeah, we just installed an automatic sensor.
 So when the door opens up, it automatically turns on the light.
 It's actually when somebody enters, right?
 Door opens.
 It doesn't come on.
 No, you have to walk out in faith.
 And once your body passes the sensor, it turns on and then turns
 off when you leave. That's the type of stuff we're talking about. Not expensive, not ridiculous.
 In some ways, not even seeming like it needs to be done, but the improvement it makes and the
 quality of life and the reduce of stress is magnificent. That feels like very strong wording
 for garage light. It's magnificent. I'm not talking about removal of stress.
 I'm not talking about the garage light in itself.
 We're going in and out of that garage 40 times a day.
 It's magnificent.
 I'm talking more about the overall concept.
 Yes, I understand.
 The more you can automate, the more magnificent your life is.
 Yes.
 For example, our nest learning thermostat.
 Yes.
 Our thermostat is one of those nice little nest ones that knows when you're home and knows when you're not.
 And when you're not, it just automatically turned itself down.
 Even if you haven't programmed it to on your way back you can turn up or it actually learns your coming and going so it realizes on monday's usually home at this time.
 And usually when you come in said it this time i'll do that for you over the years that we've had it learn our rhythms and patterns and it's fantastic if you happen to be home.
 What did you do that you're not normally home and say sitting on the couch for hours working on a sermon you will freeze well that's why you just speak to Alexa and say Alexa set the living room temperature to 72 degrees is Alexa well let's talk about home automation so home automation is absolutely in its infancy.
 Yeah there's a bunch of companies and actually it's gone a little bit mainstream if you walk into home depot or lows or being cured wherever you're gonna find.
 A whole of the companies offering automatic lights alarm systems switches, you know that sort of stuff
 You can all be controlled from your smartphone that sort of thing and so over the years
 We've built up quite a collection as you'd imagine every year for Christmas
 I'd be asking for things like I'd like a light bulb or I would like a new power outlet
 There's such exciting things to buy for you. I mean I just feel like the ultimate gift-giver here you go darling
 here's your light bulb for the second year.
 I love it.
 The trouble is over the years, we've used different companies and not all of them speak
 to each other particularly well.
 But along came this company called Wink, who for 50 bucks would sell you this little hub
 that speaks to almost every device in your house.
 It certainly speaks to every device in our house.
 You set it up, you plug it in, it connects to your Wi-Fi and it finds all your home automation
 devices.
 locks, alarm systems, light bulbs, power switches that turn on and off, all that sort of stuff.
 And you can have one app that rules them all.
 And then along came Amazon who released this thing called the Amazon Echo, which is, how
 would you just say?
 It's like Whole House Siri.
 It's a cylindrical tube about the size of a Pringles tube that plugs into your power
 and it connects via Wi-Fi to your home network.
 And it is always on, it has seven microphones and you just wake her up by saying Alexa.
 And when Alexa's awake, you tell her to do something.
 And that could be anything like Alexa, what's the news?
 Or Alexa, play me some Beth on music or Alexa, is it going to rain tomorrow?
 Or Alexa, how do you spell Frankenstein?
 And in much of the same way that you interact with Siri, she'll interact.
 But the thing that's so amazing about it is that Amazon Echo developers are constantly
 adding new value to it.
 Because the device is just a piece of hardware, all the brains are in the cloud, so they're
 constantly adding new new features to it.
 And most recently they've developed features where it can speak to your Wink Hub and therefore
 can speak to everything in your house.
 Which is so cool.
 again sounds ridiculous but we don't need to find a remote control because we can say Alexa turn off the TV or Alexa turn on the
 downstairs lights or Alexa turn on the porch lights or Alexa make it cooler in here Alexa make it warmer in here a
 Time to just feels like I'm living in the future. I'm what is my life is this my life as
 MJ would say this is my life was the the lock on our front door the automatic lock the first automated thing we got
 I'm trying to remember no it was our light bulbs
 Okay, the locks. So the reason we got an automatic lock was once we came home from vacation and we'd locked our keys inside
 Yeah, and we thought let's never do that again
 But that's not actually why I got it
 I got it because MJ was in the stage where he couldn't reach the lock
 but he could reach the door handle right and
 The kids kept forgetting to lock the door or we would forget to lock the door
 And I was afraid he was gonna run out into the street right so we thought okay this automated lock
 actually locks itself automatically after 30 seconds.
 Right. So our front door is always locked. If you unlock it, it
 re-locks itself within 30 seconds, which means MJ can reach the door handle, but can't reach the
 lock. Right. And if we both happen to be at work, for example, but we need to send someone to a
 house to pick something up or somebody arrives and they're like, "Hey, can I drop this off?"
 We can, from our phones, unlock the door. They can get in, drop whatever off, shut the door,
 and it re-locks again. So it's been hugely beneficial. I wasn't really sold on it when
 you were first talking about it, but it's great.
 So, Alex has a win. I think Alex has been my favorite product in home automation. The
 only thing I want her to do is integrate with Sonos, which is our whole house music system.
 Right.
 Because if I could speak to her and say, "Alexa, play this in the living room," that would
 just be magnificent.
 That would be the Mac Daddy.
 And I think it's coming.
 I know. You still have to use your phone for that. You poor man.
 caveman.
  </li><li>Right, just like a caveman.
  </li><li>All right, trying to device and tap with these digits,
 and posible thumbs.
 And I just wanna use my voice.
  </li><li>Okay then.
  </li><li>Talk to me about cooking life hacks.
  </li><li>I have a couple of cooking life hacks.
 There are more to do with kids
 than they are to do with food that we eat.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But things like I always make pancakes on Saturday morning
 and I triple the batch.
 So they each get tons of pancakes so that they're not hungry.
 And the rest of it goes in a container.
 So on Sunday mornings when we're going to church, we feed them pancakes in the car
 and to pouches.
 And then when they're coming home from church, they get more pancakes.
 Uh huh.
 But that is their lunch.
 So basically Saturday and Sunday, their staple diet is pancakes.
 Well, if it could we be more American?
 If it makes anybody feel better, they are gluten free banana and chocolate chip
 pancakes, but yes, they are pancakes.
  </li><li>Makes me feel a lot better.
  </li><li>And then they have like veggie straws or pouches
 or something, so that when we get home,
 MJ can go straight to bed, the kids have already eaten,
 'cause we're coming home at 1.30 or two,
 and normally they lunch at 1.12.30, so.
  </li><li>But what you're saying is,
 one, the same amount of time would take you on Saturday
 to make breakfast on Saturday,
 has not only made breakfast for Saturday,
 but also for Sunday and lunch on Sunday.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Smart.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And then on Sunday nights,
 And usually one other night during the week, I make muffins, again, gluten-free muffins,
 but they're for breakfast or for going in their lunches.
 And that way in the morning, you know, when they get up, I can go, all right, go down,
 grab a muffin, grab a pouch, start eating, you know, and it just makes everything feel
 a lot smoother.
 Do you want to talk about the joy of being an Amazon subscriber safe customer?
 Yeah, I love Amazon subscribe and save.
 It's an automated thing where you say what you'd like to live in every month to your
 house or maybe it's every other month or every third month.
 But you can search through Amazon for things that come in bulk that are things that you'd
 use.
 For example, I use Pamela's gluten-free flour.
 It's a lot of expensive when I buy it from Amazon.
 I get three bags at a time and I get it every two months.
 So it's great because it just means I don't have to think about that when I'm grocery
 shopping. I always have some of my pantry. You never run out. I don't run out. I have
 like the kids juice boxes and almond milk delivered, all that kind of stuff. So, and
 kind of the more that you subscribe and save the higher the discount that you get. And
 it's all delivered for free. So it's great. And it just comes out of our food budget each
 month. And it's all the stuff that we don't have to think about when we're at the grocery
 store. So we don't run out of toilet paper. We don't run out of kitchen roll. In theory,
 If we have a lot of people over, we do run into the different.
 We forget to up our, let's start telling people bring your own toilet roll.
 That's the new rule.
 Yeah.
 It comes to you with bring your own toilet paper.
 Yeah, that's what we should do.
 And then typically the craziest time in our house is first thing in the morning getting the
 kids on the bus.
 Oh, it can be chaos.
 But you've realized you repeat the same tasks every morning.
 So you've not necessarily automated it, but taken steps to remove friction.
 Yeah, like we have pre-printed pieces of paper that have notes to the teachers, so they have
 Abby and Tia's names already on them, their teachers names, and please switch their schedule
 and put them in Mac or please switch their schedule and put them on the bus.
 Yeah, it's basically like a winning RSVP.
 Yeah, always doing data.
 And off we go.
 But just anything to kind of make life run easier.
 Because otherwise you're not like, where's Ben? Why do we have no pens in the house?
 Where's piece of paper? I'll be getting rid of the, you know, and you're,
 am I writing these notes every week?
 I'm over something completely silly.
 Yeah.
 That could just, you could just have a file and you pull one out, tick, tick,
 put it in their folder and there they go.
 It's perfect.
 You know, if it sounds like we're anyway competent at this, we're,
 we're bumbling amateurs compared to our friend Danielle Helson,
 who takes what we're talking about to like ninja status level.
 Oh, yeah.
 She is a ninja.
 And if you go to her website, daniellehelson.com,
 You can read all her life hacks about prepping a week like she gets all her clothes that she's going to be wearing that week ready at the start of the week.
 Amazing the problem with that is that would require all laundry done and where all our clothes are and I don't think we have that much clothes to like be able to separate it out into like five little piles.
 But we digress my point is go to Danielle health and calm and read all her life hacks she's got some amazing stuff including.
 Prepping for the week. I already mentioned clothes but also includes her food for the week as well.
 Yeah, she's remarkable. She is remarkable. You know she doesn't have on our website. What information about floor cleaning robots floor cleaning robots your favorite thing and we have two of them.
 We do a vacuum and a wet mop.
 Right. We have wood floors in all of our downstairs areas and three children and so are wood floors that we.
 Rather foolishly pick dark ones.
 Yeah, never doing that again.
 And we're like, do you have anything that would really show up all the dirt and footprints?
 You do great.
 Let's put that all on our ground floor.
 Thank you.
 Let's get that.
 That was a small move.
 But this little floor cleaning robot can just be automated and you fill up with some cleaning solution
 and it just goes around and cleans your floor.
 And so what do you think about the floor cleaning robots?
 I like the wetmark one.
 And I don't really like the other one, the vacuuming one.
 Is it because the vacuuming one doesn't do a good job of vacuuming?
 It's mostly because it is so random that it makes absolutely no sense.
 So I'm like, what are you doing? Why are you turning? Why are you turning?
 You were like a fragment of an inch from a piece of dirt and you moved.
 That's so funny you say that because I read the sweet home review on it.
 Yeah. And it said, okay, the best floor cleaning robot is the one that we have, right?
 Okay.
 Of all of them, they're the best. However, if you type a person that's going to drive you nuts
 to watch you and think, "What are you doing? Don't buy this one by this other one which
 moves around your room sequentially. It doesn't do quite a good job but it'll be less effort
 on your blood pressure." Less stressful. And I thought about you.
 Yes. So what we have to do is leave the house and put it on and then you just come back and
 the floors are clean rather than you watching it. Because I admit itIt'
 s like watching a bull on crack or something. It just sort of mumbles everywhere.
 It's and they manufacture says no no no we do clean everything and it does have like an interior GPS that knows where it's going
 but it's much more
 Suiting to watch the floor cleaning robot the mopping one. Yeah
 Lines and it then comes back on itself and yeah
 It's awesome
 But anyway floor cleaning robots if you've got wooden floors or even if you've got some carpet and you need some light vacuuming done
 I highly recommend those.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'll put a link in the show notes.
 Should you even care?
 Well, there's plenty more to talk about,
 but these are just some small examples
 of some of the things that we've employed.
 And I wanna encourage you that the challenge
 that everybody faces when they try to automate their life
 is they hit this deception that,
 oh, setting this up is taking so long.
 It would just be faster for me to do the task right now
 than put in a system to automate the task.
 And you're absolutely right.
 it will be. It will be much more time consuming to sit down and work out a way to do it better
 or to automate it or to reduce friction. But if it's something that you're going to have
 to do at least one other time, I found it's worth automating.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 And we haven't even got to talk about automating Mac tasks.
 No, because I would have nothing to say. We'll wait some time until I am out of town or
 have a cold and then you can talk about automating Mac tasks.
 All right, automatic math tests coming up on a future podcast.
 Age of Jones, you're ready for some listening questions.
 I think so.
 All right, this first question is from anonymous.
 And he or she asks, how do you help people who want to desperately feel God's
 presence, but are very type A and logic driven and see much of revival as
 emotionality?
 Great question.
 It is a great question.
 I guess first I would, as nicely as possible,
 and try and encourage them not to enter into judgment
 about it being emotionality,
 'cause that's gonna shut things down pretty fast.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then if you can just encourage them to,
 okay listen, you don't have to get it,
 you don't have to logically understand it,
 but if you want more of God,
 why don't you just tell him,
 what you're afraid of,
 and ask him to come and meet you where you are.
  </li><li>And then also, I'm assuming,
 just from your question, that you're in a place that is experiencing, that you're surrounded
 by other people who are experiencing the presence of God and you're not. If that's not the case,
 go somewhere where people are experiencing the presence of God. That would be my first
 thing, move to where God is manifesting. The second thing is if you're there, but you're
 not feeling anything, welcome to the club. I think for many years, I was president of
 lamppost ministries. And what I mean by that is, all around me, people are falling. And
 I'm just standing there like a lamppost,
 apparently not feeling a thing from the Holy Spirit.
 And part of that was because I was analyzing
 everything that was happening.
 I was so scared of being deceived
 or getting a fake version of it
 that I was just in an analysis.
  </li><li>But that's just because that's a lack of understanding
 about how big God is and how good he is.
  </li><li>And it's also a lack of understanding
 of how the Holy Spirit works.
 So this is what I would encourage you to do is,
 I would encourage you to get alone with God.
 And that instantly takes a pressure off.
 So in your own room, wherever you are carve out some time to be with the Lord and recognize
 that the Lord is the Prince of Peace.
 So he loves to manifest in peace.
 So I would lie down on the floor or lie down on your bed.
 I would put on some restful soaking music and I would just pray a prayer.
 This is Holy Spirit.
 I have come to be with you like your words as drawn near to God and he will drawn near
 to you.
 choosing a draw near to you and by faith I believe you're choosing a draw near to me
 and then do nothing. Don't pray, don't strive, don't analyze, just rest. The only thing I'd
 encourage you to do even though just don't do anything is monitor yourself for peace.
 Are you entering into a state of rest? Are you feeling peaceful? And if you are pay attention
 to that peace and watch as it grows. Because for me the Holy Spirit, the foundation of
 everything he's doing is peace. And that's what happened for me. I just practiced the discipline of
 resting and soaking and it was horrible because you know, as somebody who had a type A personality,
 it just seemed like such a waste of time and it didn't make any sense. But the discipline
 of resting in God's presence led me to a greater understanding of him. So what's that, Sam?
 I've, it's the verses escaped me, but it's in the book of Psalms, it says, "Be still and know that I
 God. Many of us want to know God, but we don't want to do the prerequisite. We don't want to learn
 to be still. So I would say that stillness and peace, not analysis, not study, is going to lead
 you into experiencing the presence of God. And also know, AJ the verse, for we have come to know
 and have believed the love that God has for us. So you already know that God loves you. But knowing
 and believing are two different things. One is in your head, the others in your heart.
 And all you want to do is just shift what you know, which has come from study, which has come from
 intellectual pursuit into experience, which comes from rest. In fact, I'm going to pray for you
 right now, Father, I pray for anonymous this week that as he or she begins to lay down and just
 practice the discipline of being in rest, I'm asking that you would come and manifest your presence
 and incredible measures of peace and that it would be a breakthrough season for them
 to experience your love in new ways.
 Yeah.
 We have one other question.
 Go for it.
 This one is from Adrian and it says, "One of the girls in a Bible study that I am part
 of and myself were talking about churches yesterday.
 I mentioned Bethel Church in Reading and she immediately responded with accusations of
 them being a cult and teaching unbiblical truths.
 as well as the idea that spiritual gifts cannot be taught,
 so something like a school of supernatural life
 also raises questions in regards to that mindset.
 She said that they are a church
 that is only concerned with signs and wonders,
 seeking an experience above all else,
 and this sense of striving for the presence of God
 is her concern.
 Being a part of gray center,
 there are a lot of parallels obviously with Bethel Church.
 I have never had someone make such accusations
 and was hoping that you could shed some light on these.
 Thank you.
  </li><li>Oh, can we shed some light?
  </li><li>Yeah, we can.
  </li><li>So it is very, very common for people who don't understand
 things to be fearful of them.
 And in return, people who fear things like to spread fear
 and warn other people away from it.
 So for example, we have a student currently in second year
 And a number of years ago, his first time at Grace Center,
 I love being at Grace Center, but then some friends at A,
 you wanna stay away from Grace Center.
 It's a really weird church.
 Have you watched these YouTube videos
 on the Kundalini spirit?
 You know, it's a spirit of deception in that church.
 And despite the fact that him having incredible times
 with God at this church, listen to friends,
 watch these dumb videos on YouTube,
 and just thought, oh, I've been deceived by a demon
 and stayed away from our church.
 And subsequently had probably one of the worst years
 his life because he was operating in fear, he's partnering in fear rather than partnering
 with the Holy Spirit.
 Well, got a long story short, came back to Great Center, was like, I can't believe I
 fell for that.
 In Toronto, the church that we were a part of before, there was just horribly written
 articles about us all over the internet about how we were a church of Satan and how there
 was false revival and John and Carol Arnett were agents of Satan to spread counterfeit
 revival and deceive the elect.
 and this yah yah yah yah yah.
 But my question with all of these things is,
 is examine the fruit.
 So what is the fruit of the lives of people
 who've been at these churches?
 And Grace and I's had a 17 year relationship
 with Bethel Church in running California.
  </li><li>It's an amazing church.
  </li><li>It's an amazing church.
 We know many of this church staff there personally,
 they are incredibly solid Christians
 who love the word of God, who love Jesus,
 and who are doing incredible things for the kingdom
 and are seeing incredible fruit in the lives of people,
 including some fruit that might be outside
 of the ordinary for some Christians.
 And if we don't understand that
 or if we're not seeing that it's easy to question,
 which we should question and we should test the spirits
 as the Word of God said,
 but we don't wanna go from that
 into just assuming we know what we're talking about.
 So a lot of the books that were written about Toronto
 and probably today have written about Bethel,
 are by people who've never been there.
 There are people who've just watched the horror stories
 or listened to other people tell horror stories.
 And many of the same complaints that could be made
 about Bethel have been made about Grace Center.
 But the truth is Bethel Church, Bill Johnson,
 Chris Valt, and their whole staff out there
 are doing a phenomenal job in encouraging the body of Christ
 and in raising a new water level of what's possible.
  </li><li>And here's the thing, Adrienne.
 A lot of the church has been taught to fear experience.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that experience is a bad thing.
 Experience isn't a bad thing.
 The majority of the Bible is stories
 of people's experiences with God
 and God clearly wants you to experience Him.
 But I think people are afraid of experience
 and they've been taught to be afraid of experience.
 And so that's probably something
 that your friend might be triggering over is like,
 whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 But the thing is, experience is what actually
 releases us in the love of God, you have to experience love to receive it.
 And not that this is anything, but I would imagine, while on the one hand, your friend
 and say many other people have questions with Bethel, they probably don't realize they're
 singing most of Bethel's worship songs at their church on a Sunday morning.
 So just Bethel worship alone, Bethel music, the fruit of that equipping the body of Christ
 all over the world with fresh worship is just amazing.
 Also bills teaching and it would probably encourage you to go look at Bethal's website.
 They have a teaching series called foundations where they're going through the foundations
 of the Christian faith and it's it's excellent teaching and anyway we we love those guys
 there.
 They're top not so fear not Adrian.
 Thanks for asking us, but they're they're a great church and they're doing a great job.
 I think also Adrian just one more point you talked about, you know, is it possible to
 to train people in spiritual gifts.
 You know, it brings to question things like the school,
 supernatural life.
 Yeah, we're actually supposed to train in spiritual gifts.
 It's actually, we're supposed to desire spiritual gifts
 and we're supposed to grow in spiritual gifts.
 And that's, that's scriptural.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you would see in the Old Testament,
 there would be schools of prophets where, you know,
 prophets were learning and all the way through scripture,
 we're told to mature and grow and become Christ-like.
 And part of that is discipleship.
 You know, it wouldn't be weird to, you know, Jesus had disciples that he taught.
 And so remember, for example, the disciples tried to do deliverance and
 somebody didn't work unless it mastered.
 Why couldn't we do this?
 And Jesus gave them some teaching.
 Oh, this kind only comes out by prayer and fasting.
 And so, you know, you see an example of that.
 Jesus teaching his disciples.
 And in Matthew 28, he tells those very disciples, go teach other people what I've
 taught you.
 And that's what the school supernatural life is about is teaching people what
 God has taught us and training our people to just know Jesus more and to be able to
 walk in the fruitfulness of his ministry.
 Right.
 All right.
