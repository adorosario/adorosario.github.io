<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mrs Jones.<br/>
 Yes sir.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm very good.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I've conquered many lands in Catan.<br/>
 I'm very excited.<br/>
 No, I have conquered many lands at Catan.
 You don't even like Catan.<br/>
 Okay, you have me there.<br/>
 Why won't you learn how to play it with me?
 Well, I live tweeted you teaching Cindy how to play.
 I just about sent me over the edge.<br/>
 Well, it almost sent me over the edge as well, but I believe you would enjoy it.
 Okay. I'm telling you about this week.
 It was a great week.<br/>
 We had some guests in time.<br/>
 Yes, it was a week full of wonder.<br/>
 We had Kristi Pray come in and also Jamie Galloway.
 So they both taught on the school and then Jamie ministered on Monday night at M&amp;A,
 which was great.<br/>
 And we got a sweet, prophetic word.<br/>
 We did. He prophesied for like an hour and then he spoke.
 Yeah, he did. I absolutely loved it.<br/>
 It was great.<br/>
 It has been a week of milestones.<br/>
 A milestone very close to my heart is the fact that I was in a university.
 Yes.<br/>
 That's not what you're going to say.<br/>
 What were you going to say?<br/>
 I was going to say I also got five stars on both new Super Mario Bros.
 You and new Super Luigi.<br/>
 You thanks to Mr.<br/>
 What a lot.<br/>
 We've put that game to rest.<br/>
 Who honestly his service to my Nintendo completion foundation has been stunning.
 It really has.<br/>
 He really, you know, takes one for the team and shows up.
 I'm a little surprised that that is your highlight of the week.
 However, well, you're right.<br/>
 In retrospect, it wasn't the highlight my week.
 The highlight my week was getting a new game, which you bought me for our
 anniversary, which is amazing.<br/>
 Yoshi's Willie world.<br/>
 No, the highlight of the week was the anniversary, darling.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yoshi's willy world was just a bonus.<br/>
 Wait, what's the game called?<br/>
 Yoshi's woolly world.<br/>
 It is very sweet and very charming.<br/>
 But yes, you do bring up a very good point.
 It was our 11 year wedding anniversary on Friday.
 Yeah.<br/>
 What do you get for year 11?<br/>
 Hang on.<br/>
 Let me look up Wikipedia.<br/>
 It says new Nintendo games.<br/>
 So that's awesome.<br/>
 Oh, goodie.<br/>
 I can't wait to get mine.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Is is every year has a number or is it just the milestones?
 I have no idea.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 We should look for up.<br/>
 And I would imagine we have 11 years of retraspection.
 We could, we could see if our guest today happens to know what the 11 year one is just for fun.
 Oh, he'll know the heavenly version of it.
 Probably not the Wikipedia version.<br/>
 That's true.<br/>
 So tell the good people what we did for our anniversary.
 We, well, I went to the dentist.<br/>
 You know what?<br/>
 We just live in like rock stars.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 But the thing that makes me excited about going to the dentist is right after the dentist.
 I always go to the Jam Nashville.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 And you brought me home breakfast tacos.
 So it was win, win, win.<br/>
 And they're so good.<br/>
 But that was your wedding anniversary in a nutshell.
 No, that was that was the launch of it.
 And then we went to husk for lunch, which is a restaurant we
 haven't been to before in downtown Nashville.
 And then we went and saw for the second time Star Wars, the force
 awakens.<br/>
 But this time we went and, well, the first time we went in 3D, but this time it was 3D iMacs.
 Yes.<br/>
 What was my major complaint?<br/>
 Uh, you felt dizzy.<br/>
 That wasn't my major complaint.<br/>
 My major complaint was it wasn't actually shot in iMacs format.
 So you got this gigantic screen and you're still only using parts of it.
 So I've kind of felt cheated.<br/>
 I'm sorry, but I really enjoyed it.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 I left halfway through and played games on my iPhone.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then we went to Cafe Nona for dinner.
 Yeah, which was the last minute change of plan
 because we realized we were up north.<br/>
 And there's this beautiful little,<br/>
 how would you describe Cafe Nona?<br/>
 It's a tiny Italian restaurant,<br/>
 you know, owned by an Italian one once per zoom.
 Is it?<br/>
 I don't think he's Italian.<br/>
 I don't know. It's an amazing restaurant.
 I mean, the food is just outstanding.<br/>
 Food's amazing. Service is wonderful.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 just this cozy, quaint little place that it's always packed. So we were really surprised that
 they could fit us in, but they did, which was lovely. And then that brings us to Sunday, which is
 today. Today. You didn't get to go church. I didn't. I just woke up feeling rough. And so
 I stayed home and slept for next or four hours. So for the last six weeks, Pastor Jeff has been
 teaching us all about generosity. And last week, we took up an offering. And this week,
 we found out A, where the offering was going to and B, how much came in.
 Right.<br/>
 And I think it's fair to say everybody was staggered.
 Yes.<br/>
 Our church this morning gave away $303,000 a little over that.
 Yeah. To a ministry that's for ending sex slavery in Tennessee.
 Yeah, it's called EnslaveryTien.org. They thought they were coming to present to the
 church about their ministry. Jeff interrupted them about five minutes in and said, "I'm sorry,
 Sorry, we got you here under false pretenses.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then...<br/>
 And he's like, "Be used to love me, right?"
 And she's like, "I don't know.<br/>
 It depends on what you've been lying about."
 It was quite clever.<br/>
 I watched from online at home, obviously, from being in bed.
 But I felt super excited, you know, just watching it from being at home.
 So you were saying that in the room, everybody was just...
 It was electric.<br/>
 It was pretty electric.<br/>
 I'll put a link in the show notes.<br/>
 You can watch it's a really short episode, but it's well worth watching. It's amazing to be part of a church.
 This is a third time we've done this. Yeah, in fact, we're close to giving away almost two thirds of a million dollars since we've been at that church.
 Yeah, so exciting. It's astonishing. Yeah. Well, we're very excited because we have a special guest tonight.
 We have a guest with us this evening. Our friend David Wagner.
 David, the people might not know who you are.
 Some people will, obviously, because you're David Wagner.
 But some people might not and I thought it would be fun to recount how we got to know you
 Awesome<br/>
 With you guys are you nervous about what story I'm gonna tell about how we got to know you
 You know what my life's an open book so
 Well, it's a great story because it's all wrong and Heidi Bakers fault
 Because when Jeff was out in Mozambique, they're like do you know David Wagner?
 And so Jeff was like no and Heidi was like you have to have David in
 So normally we tend to only have people come in that we know like through relationship and but Jeff was like you know what?
 Heidi Baker doesn't usually make exclusive statements like that
 so we invited you into the church and I don't know if you remember this you came in you spoke on Sunday and
 Then he minutes it to the staff and aji and I were one of those staff and we were in that little weird room and
 You prayed this really sweet prayer you give us a great word and at the end you switch from give us a word to this
 really polite prayer about a baby.<br/>
 Do you say baby boy?<br/>
 You kind of you even mentioned it.<br/>
 You totally hedged it.<br/>
 You said new beginnings and I thought, oh, creation.
 I think being really on its best behavior and like honoring the no dates,
 mates, babies, direction, correction hatches, matches, dispatches.
 And so I think I just cheekily said, Hey, you've got boys, don't you?
 And you're like, yeah, I was like, well, we've been trying to conceive for two years to have a boy.
 Or we've been trying to conceive period for two years and we'd love a boy.
 And then, and I said, and it kind of felt like that you were prophesying.
 Do you remember this? Yeah. Yeah.<br/>
 And then you were just super bold.<br/>
 You were like, well, you know what?<br/>
 Next time I see you'll be holding the baby boy in your arms.
 And then the next time we saw you, we had my good job.
 Yeah. So amazing.<br/>
 I remember I remember that.<br/>
 I remember the day you had him.<br/>
 I was in Australia with another one of our friends, Gary Morgan.
 That's right.<br/>
 And so I was there and I got the text and
 had that moment together. So it was really amazing. That was incredible. So going back to that moment,
 were you? Did you see a baby boy and you were just totally trying to be honoring the house
 or what was going on? Wherever I go, I really try to honor protocol. And I think it was my
 initial time being with people. So I do have guts, but for me, wherever I go, I submit under the
 kind of the authority of the house.<br/>
 And so just figuring out the protocol of the place.
 And, you know, I also, it's a sensitive thing.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, yeah, fishing.
  </li><li>You don't want to, you just want to be careful
 because you're speaking into people's lives.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And for me, the fear of the Lord really surrounds
 the prophetic.
 So I don't play with it.
 I don't want to guess at it.
 I want to know that something's really the word of the Lord.
 And so, you know, I think then there's that relational
 you know, the relational component where there's the initial word, then there's the prayer,
 and then there's the hey, this is what we're doing, and we're just weaved it all together.
 Oh, it was amazing. Since then, I've lost count number of times. We've had you at conferences,
 you know, Sundays, you teach at our school, and you're so loved by us, obviously, but
 you're also loved by our community. And aside from being a wonderful prophet, we can't use
 a dear friend. It's a real treat for us to have you on the podcast tonight. We've been
 trying to get you for a couple of months now, but our schedules haven't collided.
 Yeah, it's great to finally be on and I've been following you online and I thought one day, one day,
 one day Lord, I'll be big enough and good enough to be on that.
 The crazy thing, and I was just mentioning this to you earlier, is I don't know your story
 from A to Z of how you came to know the Lord and how you end up as a prophet. I know bits and pieces
 of it because you've told it in the bits and pieces I know I kind of know Jeju, did you
 just say what I thought you said? Did you know that? So you have a pretty crazy story,
 a story's goal. Do you feel like sharing that story?
 Yeah, you know, today is actually the 19th anniversary of encountering God
 and where he just radically changed my life. And so, you know, I'm the youngest of five kids.
 I tell people often that I really should have been a statistic if you look at statistics
 in America Day of fatherlessness and all of those things.
 When I was six years old, my dad died.
 I'm the youngest of five.
 He had a brilliant brain tumor was diagnosed right around my sixth birthday, had surgery
 on my sixth birthday and died a week before Christmas, just a few months after.
 I was raised by my mom, my grandma, and basically my three sisters.
 My mom and grandma were mean.
 They did something very mean to me.
 They made me go to church.
  </li><li>So worse.
  </li><li>And then so bad.
  </li><li>So, I mean.
 As long as the doors were open, I was there.
 And it was a traditional church.
 And so they would bring me.
 So sometimes I tell people it was as long as 58 minutes
 of my life every week, but they made me go.
 And one Sunday afternoon I came home.
 I was in my room playing GIJOs and Tonka Trucks
 and blowing things up and just crashing into stuff.
 And the Holy Spirit fell in the room.
 I don't know how to explain it other than that's what it was.
 And he spoke to me.
 It was out loud and six years old never had an experience like it.
 He just said, "I've got to go around the world preaching the gospel wherever you go.
 Lies we touch and changed."
 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
 I'm sorry to interrupt you, mid flow, but for clarification sake, you're six years old,
 six years old, and you're playing, man, in your own business.
 The Holy Spirit shows up and audibly speaks to you.
 Yeah. I ever heard that voice before.
 Never heard the voice before.
 Were you confused?
 At the moment, I wasn't confused.
 It was such a loving, loving, loving voice.
 And I immediately responded.
 I think all of us were created as all of us are created in the image of God,
 according to Scripture.
 You know, he spoke us into existence before he before I was formed
 in my mother's womb, he knew me.
 So I think all of us have that desire to hear the voice of the Father.
 there's all this recognition.
 I think there's an ability to recognize the voice of God,
 even in a young child, there was just that childlike faith.
 So as soon as he spoke, I responded.
  </li><li>Tell me again what he said.
  </li><li>He said, "Son, I've called you to go around the world
 "preaching the gospel, wherever you go,
 "lives we touch and change."
  </li><li>That's not too dissimilar from Jeremiah's call.
  </li><li>Yeah, you know, at six years old,
 you never, you know, I wasn't familiar
 with the story of Jeremiah and David and the giant.
 I knew some other, Noah, and the ark, and Jonah, and the whale,
 but I had no real understanding of scripture as a six-year-old boy.
 And so he speaks, and I tell people that every revelation requires a response.
 I didn't know what I was doing it, but I put a robe on because where I grew up,
 the preachers wore robes. I made a fake microphone.
 I lined my stuffed animals up, and I started preaching my guts out at six years old.
 And in the middle of it, I tell it like this, about the time that Teddy was about to lift
 his paw and give his life to the Lord.
 And about the time G.I.
 Joe was going to get my healing line and get his arm put back on and Kerber was going to
 get delivered.
 My mom and grandma walked in and they just said, "David, what are you doing?"
 And I said, "God spoke to me."
 And their eyes got biggest saucers.
 And they said, "Who talked to you?"
 And they never knew that God could talk.
 We weren't raised that He could.
 And the only way that God spoke was through the Scriptures and our tradition.
 So they were, I think, scared.
 I think somewhat they were excited.
 And they did the right thing.
 They took me to the pastor the next day.
 And they said, you tell him what you told us.
 And I said, pastor God spoke to me.
 And he began, he got irate.
 He turned purple and red.
 And he was just irate.
 And I said, pastor God spoke to me.
 He said, I'm going to be a preacher.
 I'm going to go around the world preaching the gospel.
 Wherever I go, lies, we touch and changed.
 And he shook a big giant,
 "King James Bible."
 That means that boy, get it through your head,
 God doesn't speak today.
 He said everything you read in this book,
 he no longer does.
 And told my mother that,
 "I must be crazy to take me to psychiatrist."
 So she did.
 And at six and a half years,
 a lot was diagnosed as a schizophrenic
 because I heard the voice of the Lord.
  </li><li>So, oh my goodness.
  </li><li>That is brutal.
  </li><li>So, yeah.
 So, you know, you start down that road.
 And if you hear something long enough over your life,
 you'll start believing it.
  </li><li>The other thing that you mentioned there is,
 it's interesting about both those people,
 they're both authority figures.
 So there's a pastor in your life effectively cursing you.
 And there's a well-meaning doctor, an authority figure,
 but speaking a declaration of your life.
 So what happened after that,
 six and a half of that diagnosis?
  </li><li>You know, I struggled with that
 and started to start you on medications and counseling
 and you hear that you're this and you're that.
 And by seven years old, I was really, really bitter.
 And I felt like I was lied to.
 I felt like maybe I was crazy.
 If you hear something enough,
 you'll start acting like it.
 So at seven, I started smoking cigarettes at nine.
 I started drinking at 12.
 I was just running the streets of Chicago where I grew up.
 And I became one of those kids in the neighborhood.
 And most people didn't want their kids to play with.
 Filled with anger and hate, mostly towards myself.
 I didn't want to live.
 So at 13, hung a rope in the rafters of our garage
 and jumped off a ladder and hung there.
 I don't know how long I was hanging there,
 but the rope broke.
 And it was, I know now that it was divine intervention
 that had saved my life and gotten to quite a bit of trouble.
 My mom moved me to a Christian high school
 and I set the record for in-school suspensions
 and detentions in a term.
  </li><li>Oh, good job. - Oh, boy.
  </li><li>I still hold the record today.
 I call back every year to Chicago Christian high school
 make sure nobody's getting close.
 They say, "Don't worry Wagner, we'll kick them out
 before we bring you back."
 So, it's my claim to fame.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>But, you know, I felt really in that school,
 really out of place.
 I felt judged a lot.
 I wasn't the right pedigree.
 I didn't have the right family.
 I didn't have the right name.
  </li><li>Right.
 And so I just caused trouble because negative attention is better than no attention.
 And I was in a search for significance.
 I wanted to know that that I mattered, that somebody saw me, that somebody heard me.
 And it was it was a rough time, you know, I think just navigating adolescence and all
 of those things anyway.
 But I had a real, you know, spirit of rejection on me, you know, of abandonment, you know,
 even from my own dad dying.
 Obviously he had no say so.
 I felt like there was something in me that caused his death and the rejection that I found in the church and the rejections and other places.
 I thought there was something wrong with me and I had just such bitterness in my life.
 So then at 17, I didn't want to live.
 And so I tried to drive my 1977 black Monte Carlo into Lake Michigan and then it's accelerated across the parking lot to drive over the wall into the lake.
 I had a full tank of gas when I got to the parking lot, but as I went across, all of
 us in the car just died and the gas tank went to empty.
 There was a hole in the gas tank and we're didn't ravine again.
 Then a few months later, I tried to do it again and I hit a semi-track, but I didn't
 get a bump of bruiser scratch because I had my seatbelt on.
 I heard the story about click it and tick it and then safety first.
 I tell people, "I didn't want to get hurt.
 I wanted to die."
 So I emerged from that and finished up high school.
 And somehow I graduated with a 1.93 grade point average, which is a D. So D is still
 passing.
 D is for David, I tell people.
 I know.
 And I'm high.
 And so I pass and this recruiter comes from a Christian college and they talk me into
 applying and they give me a choir scholarship. And so I get
 wait. Okay, did you sing already somewhere? You know what? I did. I sang in high school.
 The only teacher that I had two teachers that took to me that liked me that were my advocates.
 A home ec teacher who would let me smoke outside of her room. She was tired of me getting in
 trouble for smoking. So she was my lookout. And then the choir teacher who was just tired of
 everybody beaten up on me. And so he took me under his wing and found this voice in me.
 You know, I looked back now and it was prophetic back then it came out and a choir and came out
 and in solos and things. But it was, my whole life of the Lord's been after my voice.
 He wants my voice to be heard in the earth. And so when people wouldn't hear me speak it,
 they would hear me sing it. And I just got that revelation now sitting here talking to you.
 You're welcome. Thank you. We'll see you on offer later.
 And so I get to college and I'm working. I got a campus job for security and I tell people
 when to keep the campus secure it was actually to meet girls. And one night I'm in the security
 van. I have a yellow light flashing on top of the van and have my orange vest on and a big old
 flashlight and a walkie-talkie with nobody on the other end. That's where schizophrenia comes
 I was handy.
 I can take Dave to base.
 Go ahead, base.
 This is Dave.
 And you know how to entertain yourself.
 And it's funny now going through it.
 It's not.
 So I'm working security and on a Halloween night, a police car pulls in and he pulls
 up next to me and this is a security van.
 He rolls down his window, his name is Sergeant Bob Johnson, no relation to Bill.
 just said, "Hey, you know, it starts talking and I tell him, you know, my dad was from
 a family of 15 kids, 13 boys and two girls and eight of those boys were Chicago policemen."
 And he said, "Dude, it's the family business. You look like a good, clean, cut American
 boy. Why don't you apply to be on the police department?" And I thought, "Crazy kid likes
 to drink a lot with badging guns. Sounds like a good deal to me." And so I applied.
 I was about 19.
 Okay.
 And so I pass psychological exams.
 When you take them enough, you know how to pass them.
 And when you pass psychological, I pass written,
 I pass physical, go to the academy, I get on, I come out.
 And for five years, I do pretty well.
 I'm pretty decorated, I'm starting programs,
 but drinking and anger really take over my life.
 So wait, you were a police officer.
 Yes.
 How did I miss that part?
 I did hear that part somewhere.
 That's amazing.
 Yeah.
 Officer Wagner.
 Yes.
 OK.
 And so I'm on there.
 And the drinking takes over.
 I can't show up for day shift on time.
 And at night shift, I'm showing up still with liquor
 on my breath.
 And so I'm sent home sometimes.
 I'm angry.
 And I threatened to shoot somebody in both their elbows
 and kneecaps.
 So every time it rains, they'd have to think about me
 because of arthritis.
 And you can't do that.
 Especially--
 I could see where that would be a bad idea.
 especially when the recording, you should never do that.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
  </li><li>So I had the great privilege of either being fired
 or resigning, and so I resigned,
 and pretty much thought my life was over,
 so I was a failure at everything,
 so I went home, put a 38 special Smith and Wesson revolver
 in my mouth, pulled the trigger,
 hammer hit the bullet by the bullet,
 and come out of the gun.
 I rapid fired it, so it went all the way around,
 went all the way around,
 and my friends on the police department
 showed me the, showed me the gun.
 Every bullet has a mark on it where the hammer hit it,
 but every one of them misfired.
 So five misfires.
 And so I grabbed my Glock 17, nine millimeter
 and I put it in my head, pulled the trigger,
 had one in the chamber, 16 in the clip,
 pulled the trigger rapidly and nothing happened.
 Those guns,
 Glock, she can drop from a helicopter on a concrete,
 pick them up and they shoot straight,
 almost never misfire.
 That's why most police departments use them.
 And so the gun misfires and I tell people that you're pretty messed up if you can't
 kill yourself, right?
 And it's, you know, it's torment.
 It's pure hell because you, you're a prisoner in your own head.
 And then the unthinkable thing kind of happens.
 My grandmother has a massive stroke on Easter Sunday of 1994.
 And I loved my grandma more than anybody else.
 She was 90 years old.
 She came to the US from the Netherlands and she had a stroke.
 They said, "If you want to say goodbye to grandma, you need to get to the hospital."
 I did.
 Her lungs were filling with fluid, had the death rattle going on.
 We were gathered around the bed.
 First time I saw my mom and maybe six months, my stepdad was there.
 A preacher was there and some family.
 I was drunk that night when I showed up.
 We were all saying goodbye because some people were praying.
 people were crying. In the middle of it, all my Dutch grandmother sat straight up in the
 bed out of a coma and started singing a song. And she goes back into a coma and comes up
 three more times and finishes the song that night. At two in the morning, we went to say
 that we were saying goodbye and I took her to slip away pass away in the night. The next
 morning I went to see her and nine o'clock in the morning, expecting her to be dead.
 She was sitting up straight in the bed.
 She was drinking tea and eating a piece of toast.
 And that's the only time I ever saw my grandmother angry
 when I walked in.
 She said, "David, I know you were here last night.
 "It was my night to go home and be with the Lord,
 "but he kept me alive to tell you this.
 "I'm sorry we didn't believe you when you were six.
 "We just didn't know any better.
 "But God hasn't changed his mind about you.
 "He's called you to go around the world,
 "preaching the gospel.
 "Wherever you go lies we touch and changed."
 So for a badum, the word that I'd heard years prior,
 and then she said words that I couldn't understand
 and wanna understand.
 She said, and you'll be the one to win your brother.
 And there was a huge problem for me
 because I really hated my brother.
 My brother was my tormentor.
 He's a lot older than me.
 Locked me in hot attics in the summertime,
 put me in gas dryers and turned him on.
 He beat me, he molested me, all of those things.
 And so I hated his guts.
 And so I thought I could be a preacher, but I never want that.
 I didn't know if there was a hell if there was one.
 I want him to go there.
 And 15 minutes later after my grandmother gave me that word again, she went home
 to be with the Lord and I took off running.
 Oh, my goodness.
 So I moved from the Chicago area up to Wisconsin.
 And, um, and you know, if you don't deal with your stuff, you know, you can
 change locations and still have the same demon.
 That's right.
 And so I just ran and I met a girl along the way
 and we, you know, fell in love, I guess.
 And we were living together
 and there was just one huge problem.
 She had a crazy Christian mother
 that believed the whole Bible.
 So whenever we go over there, her mom would say,
 "I love you, I'm praying for you."
 And all those things, I say, "Don't love me, love you.
 Don't pray for me, pray for you."
 And the one thing that will happen
 the girl gave her life to the Lord, gave me an ultimatum that if I wanted to stay with her,
 I needed to go to church, but it was one of those churches and one of those, you know,
 believe the whole Bible churches. And that was not my cup of tea at the time. And I said,
 I'll go, but under two conditions, number one, if anybody speaks in tongues, I'm gone.
 I don't believe in anything, but I know that's not for today. And then number two,
 if anybody rolls in the aisles like your holy rulers do, I'm gone. It didn't take long. It was
 Sunday where they had a crazy guest preacher and this guy was a missionary to Spain and
 he was dressed up like a clown.
 He ministered to kids in the squares of Madrid and he was demonstrating that.
 So he was dressed up like a clown.
 He had a clown hat, clown shoes, clown pants, suspenders, flower that squirted water and
 he preached on a unicycle.
 I said, "Look baby, holy roller, let's go."
 And she said, "No, just wait it out."
 It was bad the guy couldn't preach.
 He kept losing his place in his notes, couldn't find scriptures.
 Well, he was on a unicycle after all.
 So he was fumbling around and there was all of these awkward moments of silence, kind of
 like that.
 And in the midst of one of those awkward moments, this lady let out in tongues, which to me
 sounded something like, "Keeze to a Honda, shoot a mosquito," came in a four left in
 a Chevy, Burrito Taco, Generosau's chicken, chicken almond ding.
 It was something I didn't comprehend or get.
 And so freaked me out.
 I tried to run out of the church,
 but it was like my butt was glued to the seat
 and the guy on the unicycle said,
 and the interpretation is there's a young man here,
 you're 26 years old.
 You've been running from God your whole life.
 He spoke to you when you were six
 and again three years ago on your grandmother's deathbed
 and he's speaking to you again today.
 He says he's not, the world's called you alcoholic
 and schizophrenic, but he calls you son.
 And he said, son, if you give me your life,
 I'm gonna take you around the world preaching the gospel
 wherever you go in the lives, we touch them changed.
 and you'll be the one to win your brother.
  </li><li>Good night, David.
  </li><li>So I'm in this.
  </li><li>You have my attention, Lord.
  </li><li>I'm in the place and I'm weeping and I'm weeping,
 but I don't go forward, I don't respond.
  </li><li>Out of boy.
  </li><li>And I leave and the relationship ends.
 And so we're recording this on January 17th today.
 So on January 17th, 1997, I took 250 prescription pills,
 howl doll Percocets, ambient,
 rispera doll, and I laid down a bottle of gin and a 12 pack
 of beer and I laid down to die or so I thought nobody knows
 how it happened, but I ended up in a church 12 miles away
 from where I was living, walked into the church office,
 pastor was turned out to be his first day out of seminary.
 He was the interim pastor.
 And he was just holding down the fort until they elected
 another one.
 And I dropped in in his office and he called an ambulance.
 the ambulance came and resuscitated mass spent two and a half days in a coma.
 At the end of the two and a half days, they got a hold of my mother.
 They finally found out who I was and I had no idea on me or anything.
 And they got a hold of my mother in Chicago and said, "You might as well forget you ever
 had this son.
 He's not going to live.
 If he does live, he'll be a vegetable and live an institution the rest of his life."
 And my mom just prayed a prayer.
 "God, you gave him to me and I give him back to you."
 I named him David.
 Because I always believed he'd be my little shepherd boy.
 And I don't know what you're going to do, but Lord, make my son a miracle.
 And I don't know if it was at that time, but around that time a bright light came into
 the room.
 And the Lord spoke to me for the fourth time and said, "Son, I'm not changing my mind
 about you.
 I've got to go around the world preaching the gospel where we go, lies we touch and change,
 and you'll be the one to win your brother."
 Took me by the hand and took me to what I call the outer banks of hell.
 I could hear people screaming out, burning flesh, sulfur.
 People were saying, "Wagner, why don't you tell me this place was real?"
 You went to church twice on Sunday every Wednesday night,
 "Why don't you tell me this place was real? Get us out of here."
 And Jesus said, "If you give me your life, I'll use you to rescue people from this place."
 And I woke up, and for the first time ever, I felt peace, I felt joy, and I felt this overwhelming
 love. And so I prayed a prayer in the mental ward that went something like this, "God, if you
 can love me when I can't love myself, I'll serve you the rest of the days of my life."
 I died empty. I woke up hungry. I died crazy woke up in my sound mind
 And I had to spend four months proving that I was saying to get out from underneath the Baker Act and
 Doctors would say things to me like own your disease. Say you own it. Say you'll take medication
 Say you'll come to treatment
 So you'll keep your appointments and we'll let you out of here and I had to say I can't own it because I don't own it
 Jesus took it from me
 And so for four months I'd have to go through all of these things electric shock treatment
 they did all kinds of things to I had no choice. I had to do whatever they wanted me to do.
 Is that because you were like a ward of the state? I was a ward of the state.
 Wow. So I was considered an incorrigible of society, basically a non person.
 So it took me to two years ago to finally be able to get life insurance or health insurance.
 I had no value as a human being in two states.
 And so we live in a society where people,
 I think the greatest crime in the world right now
 is identity theft in the natural,
 but I think it's that way in the spirit as well.
 Somebody tries to steal you from you.
 Somebody tries to devalue you.
 Somebody tries to tell you that you're worthless
 when really the truth is you're priceless.
 And so on Good Friday, I got into an argument
 with a psychiatrist who, after going back and forth,
 he finally got so mad and said,
 "I just want you to get out of my face.
 I want you to get out of here
 and I never wanna see you again."
 And he signed my release on Good Friday, 1997.
  </li><li>Wow. - That was a Good Friday.
  </li><li>Yeah, come on.
  </li><li>And I was so hungry for God,
 all as I had was traditional experience.
 But when I woke up, I knew there was more.
 And that's Sunday, I went to seven services.
 I started with a sunrise service.
 I went through all the churches I could find.
 And I went back to my first apartment there,
 still hungry and I was watching a,
 turned the TV on and there was this little preacher
 from Texas with a globes spinning behind him,
 preaching this message in a Texas draw,
 "How big is your want to?
 How big is your want to?"
 He's talking about the baptism, the Holy Spirit,
 which I never heard of before.
 I didn't know what a want to was, but I wanted one.
 And I put my hand to the TV and I got shocked
 when the Holy Spirit just static electricity.
 And, but it led me on a journey,
 that hunger led me on a journey that would take me.
 Lots of, lots of stories in between,
 but I ended up going to a church
 that had a new now prayer meeting every day for 30 days
 to receive the Holy Spirit.
 And people blew on me and people laid hands on me
 and smeared me with oil and knocked me down.
 I got back up again.
 They tried to punch him into me, slather me into him,
 saw them into me, but,
 And nothing happened.
 I was driving down the interstate in my little truck
 and I said, "Lord, I want everything you have for me."
 And he said, "You'll never have to go through man
 "to get what I have for you."
 And he baptized me in the Holy Spirit
 as I was just driving down the street.
 And I just was hungry after God
 and started going to a church
 and went to an all-night men's prayer meeting
 and the day after Christmas of 1997,
 the Lord said, "Move to Pensacola,
 place I never heard of before. And 11 days later, I left with $141 in my pocket in a van that didn't
 have reverse. I never been there before, never heard of it before. And pulled into town, I got
 lost, I pulled into a driveway, and a couple came out of the garage and asked me if I was David Wagner.
 They'd been in a business trip up into Wisconsin. My friend heard their funny southern accent. And
 they exchanged information, my friends and my, I have a friend that's moving there, they exchanged
 information, but I didn't have a pager or a cell phone or anything back then.
 And they offered me a place to stay month later and ended up in...
 Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
 So you drive from where were you, Wisconsin?
 Yeah, from Wisconsin to Pensacola, Florida.
 How many hours?
 About a thousand miles.
 Okay.
 You don't know where you're going.
 I have no idea.
 You randomly turn around in someone's driveway.
 Open the door to push myself out because I don't have reverse.
 And these people come out and say, "Are you David Wagner?"
 Yes.
 Yeah, that happens a lot.
 It's completely normal.
 Yeah.
 It's a divine appointment.
 It was my Cornelius experience.
 I think my favorite thing about this whole story is how mellow you are telling what
 amounts to an incredible story replete with miracles.
 And you're just like, "Dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum, dum."
 You know what?
 It's new to me every time I tell it.
 And I've told it a thousand times.
 And sometimes you think about, "Well, maybe I'll retire it and tell something different."
 Oh, it's an amazing, amazing testimony.
 But at the end of the day, I think our story, our testimony,
 is the greatest thing we have.
 Yeah.
 And I think what it does is it brings hope, number one,
 if you're walking through something like this,
 you realize if God could do it for him, he can do it for me.
 Absolutely.
 So you meet these people who,
 yeah, it's quite funny that what you do for a living
 is call out people by their names and give them hope,
 direction, healing, restoration.
 and yet at the beginning of your journey.
 I mean, you're not even stepping in a prophethood right now,
 but these people call you out by name
 and take you in and presumably help you on your way.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I stay with them, rent free,
 I work for them and their little business kind of thing.
 And I'm in town for about a month
 and I'm going to every church I can find.
 It didn't matter what the name is, I just wanted God.
 And most of the time you'd find a sign that said church,
 it's not church as usual
 and you'd find church as usual.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I mean, I live in a city with over 600 churches
 for less than 100,000 people.
 And so there's a lot of churches.
 And so, you know, I got to Valentine's Day of 98.
 And I just said, "Lord, I want everything you have for me.
 I need you to tell me where you want me.
 And if I don't find it tomorrow, I'm going back."
 And he said, "What are you going back to?"
 I said, "Good question."
 Now, at this point, when you say you're seeing that to the Lord and you're hearing him back,
 was it just from age six, you were used to hearing the voice of the Lord? Is that what it was?
 Or did you grow accustomed? I mean, how do you hear the voice of the Lord back then?
 I didn't talk about it a lot because of what I came out of. I didn't want to mean that identified
 me as crazy. But from the time he woke me up, there is this intimate voice of the Lord where
 where he would just speak to me.
  </li><li>And flow or audible or how would it work?
  </li><li>So to me, it was this.
 There's been a few times I've heard him audibly,
 but he just speaks to me in my heart in a way
 that sounds like a loving father talking to a son.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>To a son.
 And I just learned to trust his voice.
 It's the voice that woke me up.
 It's the voice that I heard in the dream
 when I had that visitation, when he woke me up.
 That's the best line with the voice that woke me up.
 I love that.
 I never said that before.
 That's the voice that woke me up.
 And, um, so he just speaks to me, you know, he said, "Where are you going to go?"
 And I said, "That's a good question."
 He said, "It's your year for Jubilee."
 And I said, "I know it's the year of Jubilee.
 I don't even know what that means."
 In 1998, everybody had out on their signs, you know, especially if you were a charismatic
 church, you know, it was the year of Jubilee.
 and people were doing Jericho marches around
 and the resources were coming.
 (laughing)
 And if you remember those days,
 people had tambourines and whistles.
 And so I said, I know it's the year of Jubilee.
 I don't even know what that means.
 He said, no, it's your year for Jubilee.
 Open the phone book.
 I open the phone book.
 There's Jubilee church.
 And I go and I walk in the door
 and I'm greeted by this older guy and his wife
 and Harold and Barbara Bowlin.
 And I walk in and they opened the door and they said,
 welcome to the house that God built.
 And Harold shakes my hand and he kind of steps back
 and looks me in the eyes and he said, what's your name, son?
 I said, I'm David.
 And he said, David, you're a mighty man of God.
 And the Lord calls you son,
 he's gonna take you around the world,
 preaching the gospel wherever he can lie,
 he's gonna be touched and changed.
 And here I am, a whole life.
 And I walk into a place and...
 Harold would become one of the most influential guys in my life.
 But I go into the service man and I survive at it.
 I'm used to quiet church and I mean they got flags.
 I got flagged that day.
 I think I'm hitting the head.
 I need to get in the healing line for black eye.
 You know, flaggers.
 Yes.
 And so I'm there and this, I mean it's marvelous, but it's weird.
 It's out of my comfort zone. It is not my preference. It is not what I would choose.
 It is charismatic craziness. It's reviled. What I've come to love is revival.
 But it was so out of the ordinary. Music was loud. The pastor was preaching. He had a suit and tie on.
 He had big Pentecostal here. He stood on chairs and was preaching.
 And in the middle of it, man, he says something that just leaped.
 And in the middle of his message, he said, I can live without a lot of things,
 but I refuse to live without the presence of God.
 And immediately it was like the Lord said, that's what you've been looking for your whole life.
 You've been on a journey trying to find out who you are.
 You've been on a journey trying to figure things out.
 And all the attacks of your life was to keep you from my presence.
 But the thing that you'll pursue, the thing you'll carry the most is my presence.
 And the presence is always worth the pressure.
 And in that moment, 20 years of schizophrenia, 20 years of addiction, 20 years of, of crazy,
 suddenly became worth it for me.
 Suddenly all of the pressure of the past, all of the rejection, all of the, the stuff and, and crap of life
 became worth it because it got me to my destination.
 I think for all of us, whether it's every meeting or every day or the destination is the presence
 of God.
 When you get there and you touch that, I'm like that.
 That's my motto.
 That's what I live for.
 I can live without a lot of things, but I refuse to live without the presence of God.
 I leave the meeting that day and still kind of freaked out.
 I couldn't stop looking at the welcome pack and talking about what they believed in the
 gifts of the spirit and it was all new. Never heard of any of it before. And the next day
 the Lord told me go to the prayer meeting and I went and saw the Titanic instead. You
 would think that I would get things by now, but I went and saw the Titanic. And the next
 day said go to the prayer meeting. We had prayer meetings Monday and Tuesday back then.
 And I went to the mall and before I could get out of the car, he shook me and the Lord
 just shook me. I said, "Where'd you go last night?" I said, "Lord, only you know." And
 he said, "If you don't get to the prayer meeting, you'll have a Titanic experience."
 And I went, I survived the prayer meeting. You ever been to those prayer meetings where
 everybody's speaking? We speak to the north, to the south, east of the west, the southeast,
 the west west, and you know, it was wild to me. And on the way out, I'm walking out
 of the church and the pastor's son hits me on the side of the leg and said, "What's your
 name. I said, David, you know, you got a call of God on your life's culture, go around the
 world preaching the gospel wherever you lie. It's been touching change. And so he starts
 a disciple. Me and my pastor starts pouring into me and I follow my pastor over to a meeting,
 an hour away where he's speaking. And at the time, the only thing God didn't take for me was
 cigarettes. Everything else was just immediately, I was free, but cigarettes was just something
 for whatever reason. And so I had this suit on. I was smoking a cigarette on the parking lot
 with the church fan pulled up and conviction hits. So I put it out, splashed on some
 brute and popped in a piece of double-mint gum, thinking that would mask the deal.
 I'm not sure brute's better than cigarettes. I call it butt, actually. And so he preaches
 his deal and I'm sitting back towards the sound booth by myself, not even sitting with
 the other church people. And about 30 minutes into, before he's about to close, the Lord
 says, "I want you to call him down here. I want you to have him give a word." He said,
 "You know, God's only been in my church two months. He's crazy. You know,
 he just sat on the parking lot smoking a cigarette. You know, I can't do that. I'm going to get
 behind me, Satan. He was for 30 minutes, the Lord dealt with him. And at the end, he just said,
 "Come here, son." And he said, "God's going to give you a word. Everybody needs their first time."
 And God gave me this word and I caught this African-American guy.
 So the Lord's cleansing your blood and giving you two new kidneys today.
 And he's going to give your voice back and going to use and praise worship.
 And that night the kid got healed of AIDS and HIV and was on actually needed to
 need a kidney transplant and got healed both of his kidneys.
 Today's leading worship in in in Bayman, Alabama.
 That's not bad for your first word.
 Yeah.
 Okay, I have to stop you right here.
 So I'm going to speech this year.
 So how did you, how did all that come?
 Did you just hear the word the same way you'd been hearing the, the Lord speak all those
 years, but it's just completely different content.
 Yep, different content.
 So instead of go to a prayer meeting, he's like, pick out that guy over there.
 Yeah.
 Now say this.
 Yeah.
 And did you know what you were doing?
 Did you have any grid for the prophetic?
 I had, I had no, I had no grid.
 I didn't know what was called.
 I didn't know that's say of the Lord.
 I didn't know.
 anyone do it before? The church is a prophetic church, so I've seen people kind of give corporate
 words. And so that was my first time. Did you have faith? Like when you were speaking those words,
 I mean, presumably. Faith rose to such an extent that the next day my sister was diagnosed with
 ovarian cancer. And I suggest, shut up and listen, I just watched God heal this. God wants to heal
 you. And when she went in for surgery, they looked again and she was completely healed.
 All of the cancer was gone. And then I just started being faithful in my local church
 and my pastor would teach on the gifts. He did what we call Holy Spirit Training Wheels
 class. So we teach on the gifts and do activation. And so I went through that dozens of times.
 And the interesting thing was every time a prophetic ministry would come through the
 church without knowing who I was, I was a nobody I sat in lots of different places.
 It happened 24 times that people would come and they would call me out no matter where
 I was sitting or what I was wearing and the word was the same every time.
 So then you got a call I got on your life.
 It's called you go around the world preaching in the gospel where we go live.
 We touch and change and you'll be the one to win your brother.
 And it happened over and over and over again.
 And I was just thankful to be alive.
 And I started ushering in greeting the Christian school at our church hired me as a janitor.
 So would you say at this point, because we know you as this, we know you as you are now,
 you know, you're lovable, you're safe, you've got kind eyes, you're totally generous, you're
 exceptionally loving, you embrace everyone, you know, we know this side of you.
 Back then, back then where you, where you, you sound like a shell of a person back then,
 sound pretty fearful. Obviously your upbringing has been not kind to you. How would you describe
 yourself back then? Very insecure. Still my biggest fear was rejection. Had a tremendous
 fear of public speaking. Were you socially awkward? Could you have conversations with
 people or did that freak you out? It took a while for me to trust people.
 And so in relationships were very slow going,
 but the Lord gave me a friend named Pat
 and he's still one of my best friends today.
 I was just with him for a few days last week
 who got saved with a shotgun in his mouth.
 It was such a methodical in and out of prisons
 and diagnosis crazy.
 And so our story is paralleled.
 So here we are two at the time, two very skinny kids.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Awkward who would just randomly say things
 that were right on, but just socially awkward.
 And so it took a while, you know.
 I tell people this is what I've learned,
 the crazy people don't know they're crazy,
 'cause if you're crazy, that's just your normal.
 That's what you think everybody's like that.
 And when you're bound, you know what it's like to be bound.
 You know what it's like to be depressed.
 You know what it's like to be suicidal.
 You know what it's like to be addicted.
 You know what it's like to be tormented.
 That's your normal everyday life,
 but you don't know what it's like to be free.
 Right.
 And so where most people learn, learn fear, those things, that was my normal.
 Right.
 So I had to learn how to live free.
 Wow.
 I had to learn what it was like to be a son.
 I mean, my pastor actually took me into his house for a year and a half.
 How rare is that?
 Wow.
 And he just poured in.
 He loved, he loved me to life when I, when I failed miserably at things.
 You know, he would say failures never final, where there's a father.
 I don't care who rejected you.
 I'll never reject you.
 Well, that's an amazing statement.
 failure is never final when there's a father.
 When you and when you know the father, I think that's why
 there's been such a skewed or crazy attack on the fatherhood in
 American and the Western world throughout throughout the world.
 Because our view of our natural father distorts our view of our
 heavenly father.
 So most people are cool with the Holy Spirit.
 He's the one that comes gives me goosebumps, heals me, speaks
 to me, you know, makes me shake and bake.
 We're cool with Jesus because he died on the cross.
 He saved us.
 He's good with kids and animals.
 He's good with kids and animals.
 He likes a party.
 We like baby Jesus because he's non-threatening.
 We like.
 But when it comes to the Father, I'll just be honest with you.
 Until probably up until eight, nine years ago,
 you start talking about the Father.
 You start talking about the Father's love, all of those things.
 I shut down.
 Of course you would.
 Because I affiliated the father with abandonment.
 Right.
 Right.
 And so to deal with that, to have such a great spiritual
 dad to come and love me as some was phenomenal.
 I've got a great step to have my mom remarried when I was a
 teenager.
 Teenagers weren't easy.
 But, you know, over the last 16 years, my relationship with him is great, but my pastor,
 and he was the dad that I never had, but always wanted.
 And, you know, he constantly just, it was, it was son Harold who met me at the door,
 my first day at the church.
 I was with him for nine years before he went home to be with the Lord.
 And Harold only called me David or Dave twice in nine years the rest of the time.
 It was Mighty Man or Son. So I'd come in from a trip and he'd say, "Where are we going this
 week, Mighty Man? How are you doing, Son?" And so they just so ingrained, they reprogrammed me.
 So from a boy who had father issues and identity issues, to being stripped of identity
 through the mental health system and being an incorrigible of society, to hearing every day
 the affirmations of a father. And what I realized is this, my mother loved me, said kind things to
 me in the midst of my craziness. Moms do that. But true affirmation can really only come from
 from a father. And so, you know, it took me until I was 2728 to get it. And after 30 to really
 understand it and to receive it, you know, it just took me on this track where he just, you know,
 adopted me and I started working in the church as the janitor, six in the morning to sixet,
 to midnight sometimes. And then I was cooking in the Christian school and I washed my hands
 in between. So during this time, you're the janitor, you're the cook. Are you still getting
 prophetic revelation? Yeah, so really how my gift got developed, how the Bible says your gift will
 will make room for you.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>So what I would do is I would serve lunch to kids.
 So we had 250 kids in the school,
 100 of them were getting lunch every day.
 So here's your hamburger,
 and God's gonna use you to do this.
 So I was serving their lunch
 and giving them prophetic word at the same time.
  </li><li>So it sounds like God was doing this triune thing.
 Like one, he was restoring sonship to you and love
 through the people, through your community.
 And another one, it sounds like he's cultivating this gift
 that you have obviously been called since age of six
 but you didn't know how it worked.
 And then at the same time, he's teaching you,
 I mean, you're already low, but he's teaching you humility.
 I mean, you're serving in, I mean,
 most people who are in prophetic ministry,
 which let's face it as one of the sexier types
 of ministry to be in.
  </li><li>Especially when you're this handsome and humble.
  </li><li>Yeah, a body of a Greek god.
 I don't know how you do it, ridiculous.
 But most young prophets I've met
 want to aspire to greatness.
 They're not interested in service.
 And yet ironically, prophetic ministry is all about serving.
 Do you know what I mean?
 You're serving God and you're serving man.
 So it sounds like those three things were in operation.
 Is that fair to say, is that what you were feeling
 or do you learn that in hindsight?
  </li><li>I think looking back in hindsight,
 one of the core messages that I think my pastor ingrained
 And to me is the difference between a slave and a son.
 Slaves are about performance.
 But as a son, everything you do is from the place of acceptance.
 And that acceptance is not based on my performance.
 It's just based on who I am.
 And so I was in that low play.
 I was so thankful to be alive, so thankful to be accepted.
 And I just love the house of God, man.
 I love the church.
 I tell people, I speak at conferences.
 I get to do lots of stuff.
 But if you cut me open, I'll bleed the local church.
 It's just who I am.
 And I read a scripture.
 I was cleaning a toilet one night.
 In the woman's bathroom, the building was empty.
 And I was going through just this whole thing,
 just thankful to be alive.
 There were some things going on in my heart and in my life.
 And I'm scrubbing the toilet.
 I'm in the third stall on my hands and knees.
 scrubbing a scrubbing a toilet in the woman's bathroom.
 And the scripture rises up and it comes at the ends of David's
 life and David said, I set my affection.
 I set my affection on the house of God.
 And I've given more to see it built than anyone else.
 And he realized that he was sewing into something.
 He's given his life for something he'd never see built.
 And as that scripture came up, I'm scrubbing a toilet.
 And the Lord said, when you set your affection on my house, I set my
 on yours. And I never had experience like it or since, but this cloud came in the woman's bathroom
 when I'm cleaning the toilet. And I'm on the floor and I'm just praying in tongues and I'm weeping.
 And my pastor at that time in full time ministry over 40 some years comes back from dinner.
 And here's these moans and the sounds coming from the woman's bathroom. And my car is the only car
 in the parking lot. And he's calling my name, but I can't answer. And he follows the sound of the
 the woman's bathroom. And he opens the door and the cloud comes out and knocks him into
 the door or knocks him into the wall. And he laid on the floor for three hours and I laid
 on the floor in the bathroom for five hours. And he said that was the most profound experience
 he ever had with God. It didn't come through a microphone. It came from throne of ministry
 from from from from cleaning a toilet. I still describe that today as the highlight of my
 ministry. I prophesied to presidents and to mayors and to thousands, tens of thousands of people.
 But that moment marked my ministry. And I'll go home from great trips, preaching with some of the
 great generals and people we mentioned their name today. You'd say, "Wow, that's pretty amazing.
 And I'll go home and I'll clean a toilet." Not because I have to, but because I set my affection
 on the house of God. And I think that, you know, a lot of times people think that it's
 It's the microphone ministry, it's the being seen, but he saw me when nobody else could
 see me.
 And so to me, prophecy is just worship.
 It's my reasonable act of service.
 You know, today I was in a church and started at 10 and finished at 4 this afternoon, non-stop,
 didn't go to the bathroom, didn't, you know, and the people asked me, "How do you do that?"
 Well, I don't do it because it's expected of me. I don't do it because I have to,
 but I've set my affection on the house of God. It's my reasonable act of worship.
 You know, I don't have a lot, but what he's given me, I want to be a good steward of. I want to
 I want to pour my life into people. I want to hear from God for them. Everybody needs everybody
 needs to hear the voice of their father. Everybody needs that word that builds them up and encourages
 some and push some forward and so I've given my life to it. It's not just what I do on Sundays
 or conferences or church days, it's just who I am. If we're having lunch, something prophetic is
 going to come out in the midst of joking around or having coffee, something it's who I am. I just
 stand that place of being tuned in. But the greatest moment in God, the greatest revelation
 came in the lowest place.
 Oh, I love that.
 We have to wrap this up soon, which means we have to have you back because now I
 have a plethora of questions that I need to mine out of your life.
 But for now, like fast forward.
 So you've had this word at least 200 times about going around the world.
 You touch in lives.
 You're going to be the one that wins your brother.
 Talk about winning your brother and talk about going on the world because how
 many nations have you visited?
 I've been preached the gospel in 60 nations.
  </li><li>Sorry, six zero?
  </li><li>Six zero in the last 12 years.
 Here's the problem with that word for me.
 I had major fears.
 One of those fears was public speaking.
  </li><li>Check.
  </li><li>So you're called to being a prophetic voice
 you're supposed to preach the gospel.
 What do you have to do?
 You have to speak.
 I still have this amazing fear of rejection.
 And so to stand in front of people,
 only do you have the fear of public speaking, but you're giving hundreds of people the
 opportunity to reject you.
 Right.
 And you're telling them things about their life that you don't know for sure, and you're
 hoping you're right.
 Right.
 And so...
 How did you feel about airplanes?
 Do Japanese issues with airplanes?
 I didn't have any issues with airplanes still don't.
 Two million miles later.
 That's excellent.
 Even after a crash, I still like to fly.
 The...
 Yeah, so, you know, I'm in it.
 So here's the truth.
 I tell people, I also think for the be alive.
 I just want to stay in Pensacola.
 I liked America.
 And there was a woman in our church named Sixta McKeel.
 Sixta was from Panama.
 And Sixta was a crazy woman.
 She had this car from her ear down to her throat
 where she was a knife-eyed.
 She used to say, "I used to be a mean mean woman."
 And I was in witchcraft.
 And she couldn't say witchcraft.
 It always came out witchcraft.
 (laughing)
 And not much difference to me.
  </li><li>It's probably about right, yeah.
 And so she gets radically saved.
 Mary's a guy on the US Air Force.
 They moved to Pensacola.
 Get touched by Toronto,
 touched by Pensacola.
 She's baptized in the Holy Spirit, serving God.
 She gets hit with pancreatic cancer, goes blind,
 withers away to 75 pounds, dies.
 She's in the morgue of West Florida Hospital.
 Nine hours after nine hours,
 this guy is working in there, sees the sheet moving.
 He gets curiosity, gets the best of me,
 pulls the sheet back.
 This little Panamanian lady opens her eyes,
 looks at him and says, "Sancocho por favor."
 She asks for a type of chicken soup from Panama.
 The guy who runs out changes his pants,
 brings her back some soup.
 She died blind, woke up seeing the rest of her life
 that the Lord grew her pancreas back.
 We have all the medical documentation at church at 65.
 ( (woman groans)
 At 65, she goes to be a missionary to Panama.
 She goes to the worst barrio,
 where her first week there, she's walking down the street
 to guys jump out at her, hold her at gunpoint.
 She laughs at them, because if you've been dead,
 you don't fear dying.
 She laughs at them, says, "In the number de Jesus,
 in the name of Jesus, they take off running."
 You think that was good enough for her,
 but no, she takes off running after them.
 She actually catches them,
 she takes the guns away, holds them at gunpoint,
 makes them say the sinner's prayer.
 I'm not advocating that for evangelism.
 (laughs)
 They become her too.
 The reason I'm saying that is you don't tell this lady no.
 And so she's on furlough,
 she's volunteering in the kitchen,
 and every day she bothers me.
 She goes, "When are you gonna go to Panama?"
 I said, "I'm never going to Panama. I like Pensacola."
 She said, "No, Davey, I asked the Lord to the Lord."
 He said, "Yes."
 I said, "Well, I asked the Lord to the Lord."
 He said, "No."
 So every day, "When are you going to go to Panama?"
 I'm never going to go.
 So finally, I get so upset with her.
 I said, "Listen, sixta, I will go to every other nation,
 "but I'll never go to Panama because you bother me."
 She said, "No, I asked the Lord to the Lord."
 He said, "Yes."
 So one day, she'd have these encounters with God
 in the midst of serving lunch or cleaning,
 doing the dishes, and she'd fall on the floor
 of the kitchen of the church.
 And she'd have these counters with God.
 And one day she gets up and she kind of gives me that crazy,
 charismatic look into the half drunk, kind of crazy.
 She points her finger at me,
 she said, "I so tired of hearing the word over July.
 I so tired of every prophetic voice calling you out,
 you testimony, you're gonna go around the world preaching
 the gospel, wherever you go lies, it'll be touch and changed.
 I so tired of hearing it.
 The other day I asked the Lord, I said,
 "Lord, why does David go nowhere?"
 And the Lord he say, "You know, have a passport."
 So she grabs me by my ear.
 She brings me to the office.
 She throws me in a chair and makes me fill out
 a passport application.
 She brings me to a CVS pharmacy,
 gets my mugshot taken, brings me to the post office,
 expedites to have the thing expedited.
 And it gets back to me on the 20th of February, 2002,
 and for the first time on the 22nd of February, 2002,
 I was in Panama for the first time.
 I've been there 50 times and I've been to 60 nations since.
 In 2004, the church that said, "God couldn't speak, God couldn't heal, God couldn't do anything that's in that book and told me that I was crazy had me back and recognized me for being in full-time ministry and they want to put my name on a plaque in the foyer."
 And so there was a day where they're celebrating me and they gave me three minutes to speak.
 So I took seven.
 And on the back row of the church was my brother and eight of my uncles.
 I'm the first man in my family to ever serve the Lord,
 but that day all of those, my brother,
 my uncle's give her life to the Lord.
 Today, every male in my family is born again.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So if you look through my family tree
 from three and four generations back
 from my grandmother in Scotland, my other grandmother
 in the Netherlands, my grandfather,
 and the Netherlands and my grandfather,
 and my grandfather that was in America,
 pre-revolutionary war his family.
 I'm the first man ever to serve the Lord.
 My dad gave his life to the Lord six weeks before he died on his deathbed.
 But so it's the, it's the power of the gospel.
 Right.
 Hebrews 10, 23 says, let us hold fast our confession again to hope because he
 who made the promise is faithful.
 He honors his word even above his name.
 He watch over watches over a day and night.
 He's careful to perform it.
 And I realized something.
 The devil's not big enough to stop my prophetic word.
 Life isn't big enough to stop it.
 The Lord will keep His Word.
 He'll do whatever it takes.
 I'm living that word out.
 In a couple weeks I'll be in Australia
 for I think the 12th time in the last five years,
 the doors are opening to places all over,
 speaking sometimes to 40,000 people at a time.
 We've seen somewhere around a half a million
 or more people give their life to the Lord
 around the world.
 seeing two people raised from the dead, the blinds seeing the deaf hearing, lame walk.
 I'm a living testimony of the goodness and the faithfulness of God.
 And something happens when you grab ahold of it and you let him grab ahold of it.
 I think Graham Cook says it like this.
 Sometimes you've got to take the word over your life and make it a part of your life.
 And that's the season that I'm in.
 So, it's one of the readers digest.
 David, wow.
 story. Wow. I mean, I spent large portions of you talking with my just jaw on the ground.
 I'd heard bits and pieces of your story, you know, over the years that we've known you,
 but never systematically like that. That is an incredible testimony of the kindness of God.
 It's been good. And it's evident in you, you know, we always say that you cannot give what you do not
 have. And so your ministry is called Father Heart. And you carry the Father Heart of God,
 you carry love, you carry compassion, you carry
 extravagance with regard to kindness and patience. You're one of the most loving people we know,
 which means you can't generate that on your own. That means you're in touch with that from the
 father. Honestly, I was probably a mess for most of the time that you were talking.
 And I'm just thinking about all the people that are going to hear the podcast and
 know that God is good and that there's nothing he can't save you from.
 I think the things that we think disqualify us are actually the things that qualify us.
 And something happens, you know, when you tell your story, God brings his glory and I don't want
 to just be clich&Atilde;&copy; and rhyme, but it's true. You know, today I told the story and watched 12
 people give their life to the Lord. You know, you tell the story and whether it's one and there's,
 What he brings you out of is normally what he will use you to set people free from.
 Every day I get the opportunity of seeing people just radically set free from suicidal spirits
 and orphans and began to see tremendous breakthrough. We've seen people healed from just completely
 healed of schizophrenia. I saw my first case a couple months ago of a little boy healed of autism
 and epilepsy. Well, do us a favor, would you do? Would you pray for everybody who's listening to
 this right now? Just pray a blessing over everyone who's listening and then we're going to let you
 go. You've been ministering all day. It's now late into the night and I know you're scheduled
 the next couple of days. So pray for us, would you? Amen. Father, I love you and Lord, I thank you
 that Lord when we call you answer.
 And Lord, your loving kindness is better than life.
 Your goodness, Lord, is amazing.
 Lord, there's people that are listening today.
 Maybe some people in deep dark depression, some people wondering, is it worth it?
 Do they? Some people are listening, thinking maybe the world will be better
 without me. Some people are trying to get the courage to end their life.
 But Holy Spirit, I ask that you would go and that you would arrest them with your love or the same way
 that Lord, your love came down and rescued me 19 years ago.
 Or would you do the same for your sons and your daughters listening today?
 But I just take authority. I break off every spirit of suicide and depression
 and oppression off of your sons and off your daughters.
 And some of you listening today, I just see the Lord just handing you an identification card.
 This is a season of really knowing who you are and who you are.
 And I'm just telling you right now that Jesus is crashing in on this podcast, that the Lord
 is coming.
 There's no distance in the spirit or recording this on a Sunday night, but you may be listening
 to this at some other point.
 The anointing is just as strong now as it was when we started.
 And I'm telling you right now that you're worth it.
 You are so worth, you are so worth,
 you are so worthy of the love of God.
 You are so worth him coming and dying on the cross.
 He didn't come to give us a spirit of fear,
 but power and love and a sound mind.
 And I just released the power and the love
 and the sound mind over you.
 I just believe right now,
 somebody you're listening in you,
 you've been abused, you've been in abusive situations,
 and you're just looking for a way of escape.
 I just had all day today, when I woke up at 630 this morning,
 the Lord said, mercy's coming.
 I saw mercy today, but I feel on this podcast, mercy's coming.
 I feel the mercy of God coming.
 Some of you, you didn't go too far.
 You, somebody listening, you had an abortion.
 You think it disqualified.
 You listened failures, never final,
 where there's a father.
 Some of you, you've been addicted.
 You've made poor decisions.
 Maybe you got babies out of wedlock, whatever it is.
 and you feel like somehow you've gone too far.
 I'm here to tell you that the Father's love
 is coming crashing in on you today.
 And failure's never final where there's a Father.
 And I pray right now that as you would listen
 to this podcast, as you'd come to the end,
 you would hear the voice of the Father saying,
 there's nothing you could do to make me love you any lesson.
 There's nothing you could do to make me love you any more.
 I just love you.
 Let the love of God.
 I don't care what anybody said about you.
 There is a Father in heaven declaring over you
 that you're his beloved son, you're his beloved daughter,
 and whom he is well pleased.
 So Lord let freedom, liberty, Lord just let your love
 and your mercy come crashing through
 on this podcast tonight.
 In Jesus name, amen.
  </li><li>David, that was absolutely incredible.
 How can people follow you on social media,
 find out more about your life
 or where you're gonna be in the country or the world?
