<p> a jj.<br/>
 i'm all sure to we definitely need to do the time has come in this time
 it's time for a jingle<br/>
 okay enough<br/>
 we could catch up yes anything something happening this week
 no let's move on<br/>
 oh i'm just kidding what happened this week is exciting i turned forty
 mover you did one year older and yet everyone's commented on how you don't
 seem to age. They have. What's your secret? Um, married to a younger man. That's what
 it is. Yep. Keeps me young, keeps me hopping. You're only as young as a man that you feel.
 What? Moving right along. Well, I noticed something different about your birthday this
 year. Okay. Let me hear from my perspective. Sure.
 So generally speaking, Christmas and birthdays have been something that's been very difficult
 for you to step into and enjoy for a number of reasons.
 Yes.<br/>
 The difficulty with that is you usually bring a cloud with you over your birthdays to the
 point where it doesn't matter how much effort I put in, I still feel you feel underwhelmed
 by it.<br/>
 And this year's felt completely different.
 It felt like you felt celebrated and enjoyed yourself and you felt like you had a good
 time.<br/>
 fair assessment.<br/>
 I did have a good time and I did feel celebrated.
 I would say it is definitely fair to say that birthdays and Christmas are usually difficult.
 But I think it's been getting better over the last couple of years.
 But certainly this year, I think was the best and you pulled off surprising me, didn't even
 have a foggy as clue.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 You never thought it looked that good in the tars and I have a fit.
 It worked. Thank you, Amazon.<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
 And we went to the cheesecake factory that just opened your house.
 Right, which is dangerous.<br/>
 So dangerous. We don't need the cheesecake factory.
 You know, at least with the cheesecake factory being in green hills,
 it was a half hour drive up there and then probably a half hour to 40 minute wait.
 And so you're like, should we get the cheesecake factory?
 We're like, eh, no, what's up, all the going.
 where this one is round the corner.<br/>
 It's really not good.<br/>
 And those corn tamales, I'm convinced that they're really unhealthy for us,
 but they're so yummy.<br/>
 Well, you don't need convinced.<br/>
 It should be blending the obvious, but they are delicious.
 I'm going to try and figure out a healthy version of them.
 It is.<br/>
 But you enjoyed yourself.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 I really enjoyed myself a lot.<br/>
 And you got tons of happy comments on Facebook and cards.
 I did.<br/>
 I was on my actual birthday.<br/>
 I must have got 40 or 50 texts and then like over 200 messages on Facebook to the point
 where I asked you if you had asked people to text me and because I was like completely
 overwhelmed in a really good way.<br/>
 I just I laid in bed on my birthday evening as I was going to bed and I read all these
 Facebook comments and I just cried and I just felt really grateful and loved and.
 Sm<br/>
 a little happens when you change your belief expectation cycle.
 Isn't it?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It's amazing.<br/>
 I love that.<br/>
 What did you buy today with all your birthday money that you're super excited about?
 I can't wait for it to arrive.<br/>
 It's called a Phillips air fryer.<br/>
 And it literally fries the air.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 It uses air.<br/>
 It basically can make anything you can make in a deep fryer, but it only needs one tablespoon of oil.
 And the rest it just uses hot air so it's just way healthier.
 It's far less cool than what I thought it was going to be.
 I thought it was a weapon that like Iron Man could use if he was into environmental stuff.
 Oh, okay.<br/>
 Yeah, it's not our career.<br/>
 You're going to be disappointed then.<br/>
 Not if I get good chicken wings over there.
 That's right.<br/>
 Chicken wings, sweet potato fries.<br/>
 So you had your birthday, that was awesome.
 And then yesterday morning, I've basically been a single parent this week.
 You haven't been around at all.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 You were away yesterday morning for seven hours.
 Would you like to tell everybody what you're doing?
 I was doing a self-defense course.<br/>
 Ha.<br/>
 Stay back.<br/>
 See?<br/>
 That's really good.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Did you learn anything other than screaming, stay back?
 I learned all kinds of stuff.<br/>
 I learned how to, if you get like pulled down from behind or if you get
 from behind what you do and if they're trying to choke you, what to do and if they're, if
 you see them coming at you, what to do and I mean, if they manage to get you on the ground,
 what you do.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And what is it you want for Christmas now?
 A taser.<br/>
 You actually got to fire a taser, didn't you?
 I did.<br/>
 I got to fire a taser.<br/>
 And then a couple of our staff volunteered to get tased.
 Yes, they wanted to feel, they wanted to feel what a taser felt like.
 He was saying like if it was a group of guys, a lot of the guys would ask to feel it, but
 he was kind of surprised that two of the girls did.
 And he only turned it on for less than a second, like three quarters of a second.
 And both of them almost fell on their face.
 Like he had them kneel so that they wouldn't drop because he said, he said that when they
 brought the tasers into the police department, that all that they put $1,000 on the table
 and said anybody who can stand up for three quarters of a second while getting taste can
 have a thousand dollars.<br/>
 And so all of these cops were like, I'll totally be able to do it.
 Not one of them could stand up for even three quarters of a second.
 They all dropped.<br/>
 It's like that famous Chinese proverb.
 It's not a party till someone gets dazed.
 Right.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I forgot about that famous Chinese proverb.
 So you feel more confident about being a defender self as a woman?
 I do.<br/>
 When you're a big burly man, isn't it round?
 Yes.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And then Steve Long was in this week.<br/>
 Steve Long, our dear friend from Toronto, came in and taught on the school of supernatural
 life on healing.<br/>
 He's so awesome, isn't he?<br/>
 He's amazing.<br/>
 I miss him.<br/>
 Yeah, I do too.<br/>
 I do too.<br/>
 It sounded like a Star Wars robot.<br/>
 I do too.<br/>
 We have some great chance.<br/>
 It's a new deal.<br/>
 Great conversations.<br/>
 We had some great healings too.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 There's one I think that I actually want to get somebody to come and testify to rather
 than me share a second hand.<br/>
 an amazing creative miracle and we'll see if we can get that person to come share their
 story. I've got a question for you, but it's not for me, it's from Peter, one of our listeners.
 Okay. He's got quite a story, everything that happens. He said, "I, for many years,
 have a recurring dream about me grieving the passing of my wife." And he basically said,
 "You know, what do you think that means? I've read various things." Great things about
 dreams is God loves to speak in hyperbole.
 Yeah, he uses huge exaggeration to hammer home a point.
 And I don't think that dream means that your wife is about to die.
 And that's the literal passing of your wife.
 Right.<br/>
 I would think rather it's the Lord trying to get your attention over your
 grief of the passing of your first love.
 So what is it?<br/>
 What areas of your heart are you finding that you're grieving the loss?
 over something and perhaps there's an invitation to go back to those things and rekindle passion
 and love for whatever those areas are. So hopefully that brings some comfort to you.
 It's not nice having dreams about the death of a loved one or people close to us, but
 I would be absolutely confident to say that it's notIt'
 s very unlikely that it has to deal with your wife actually dying.
 You know what I want to talk about this week, babe?
 What do you want to talk about manifestations?
 really manifestations of the Holy Spirit really or why does it look like a crazy
 house sometimes when God shows up maybe God doesn't care what it looks like right
 no but that's the topic of my my question right you told the story before on this
 podcast about the first time you encountered the Holy Spirit your church
 our church where you got stuck to the floor for hello about three hours you
 You got stuck to the floor for three hours, couldn't move any part of your body.
 No, just my eyes.<br/>
 That's handy.<br/>
 And our church in Toronto and our church here in Nashville, Gray Center is known for
 the Holy Spirit showing up.<br/>
 And, you know, we've been called various things over the years and I get it.
 It looks completely strange.<br/>
 I think one of the amusing things to me is that most people who I've spoken to about
 the manifestations of the Holy Spirit think that when it started happening in 1994
 in Toronto that everybody was okay with it. Everybody's expecting it to look like this,
 but that wasn't the case, was it?<br/>
 No, I think we were continually surprised by some of the things we saw.
 My favorite story, and I'm sure I've told this, if not on the podcast, I've told it
 many, many times while speaking, is Mary Audrey Raycroft's reaction, the first night
 it happened, January 20th, 1994. She hears all this commotion, she's leading a Bible
 study in a room just off the main room, she opens the door to see what the commotion's
 about. And she's astonished because she can't see anybody. I wonder if she saw the rapture
 it happened. Nobody was in their chairs. She was like, "We're all the people."
 They just feed up in the air.<br/>
 And she looks down on the ground and there's everybody on the ground. And she was about
 to make a judgmental comment about it. And the Lord struck her dumb.
 And what I'm using about that is, from an outsider watching what happened and watching
 everybody go, "What looks like banana shake, rattling, rolling, people on the floor,
 people laughing, hysterically people crying, people pogo sticking, people
 whatever. And people just assuming, Oh, you must be all okay with that. But I
 think what we're okay with, and I say we could have it there at the time, is
 that God is showing up. And so stuff is happening. And we'll work out what it
 is later. That be fair to say.<br/>
 And I think we were okay with God being God and us not understanding,
 because there's plenty of stuff that God does that I don't understand. And I
 I'm not his advisor.
</p><ul>
  <li>It's a refreshing concept that you don't have to understand everything God's doing.
 My favorite quote I think from John on it ever was, "John, looking around the church,
 people falling over and doing all this stuff."
 John said, "Lord, I don't understand what you're doing."
 The Lord said to him, "John, you don't understand women.
 What makes you think you'll understand me?"
 (laughs)
 But it is weird.
 It is very weird.
 I remember the first time I went to charismatic church and saw people lifting their hands
 in worship and that was weird for me.
 Sure.
 Anything outside of your own paradigm is weird.
 Right.
 And God loves to stretch your paradigms.
 I remember hearing people say that if you fall backwards it's Satan but if you fall forward
 it's God and therefore everybody who's falling backwards it must have been Satan.
 Where did you hear that?
 I don't know.
 People will come up with a crazy doctrine to make themselves feel better about what's
 happening.
 Okay.
 I never heard that one.
 That's very entertaining.
  </li><li>And then people would always go to the extreme,
 like animals, animal noises in Toronto.
 I was in Toronto for five years.
 The only time I heard animal noises was you.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Thanks, too.
  </li><li>And then later me, when Claudia freeze and pray to me,
 we can maybe talk about that later,
 but what was your reaction at first
 seeing all manifestations.
 And by manifestations, I mean, when people are being prayed
 for them having a physical reaction
 to the Holy Spirit's presence, what was your reaction?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, obviously my initial reaction was
 that I was leaving the church.
 And then after God sorted me out that night on the floor
 and just basically said, "You need to make a choice.
 "Either I'm gonna be in control or you are."
 And I was like, "Right, okay.
 "You're probably a better person to be in control than I am."
 So I, I mean, honestly, I would still see stuff
 that I was like, what on earth is going on there?
 But I would just be like, okay, Lord,
 help me not to judge.
 I don't know what's going on with them.
 And if, if, if it was somebody I knew,
 I would often check with them afterwards and be like,
 hey, what was God doing?
 You know, and often like, while it looks bizarre
 on the outside there, you know, having a vision
 or God's restoring something to them or, you know,
 and you're like, oh, okay, I guess it kind of makes sense
 that, you know, it looks like you're riding a bicycle
 is actually you were in a vision with the Lord
 winding a bicycle and, you know, it was just during
 that time that your dad wouldn't take you riding
 or you know what I mean?
 Like, so you'd sort of get to the point where you're like,
 okay, actually I want to be really quick not to judge.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And to just wait and see what the fruit is.
  </li><li>That's probably the most helpful thing I'd heard, John.
 Whenever we do conferences, John would always try
 and take time in a session to answer questions
 about manifestations.
 And it was so comforting to hear, first of all,
 John wasn't just okay with anything going. And second of all, that there was actually
 really plausible and logical way of approaching manifestations. And I think what you just said
 about actually following up with people is amazing. I remember John using this example,
 which I don't think I'll ever forget. And he said, let's go back to the time of Jesus
 and you're a young Jewish person. And you've heard some rumors in the synagogue that the
 Messiah has returned. And you hear that he's ministering. And so you go over to the garrisines
 and you know, there's a crowd gathering and you think,
 oh, this must be this hot shot, Jesus.
 Some people are saying this is Messiah,
 some people are saying that he's, you know, from the devil.
 And so you go and watch and it just happens to be the time
 when Jesus is casting out Legion from this demoniac
 and they're going into all these pigs
 and the pigs are running and throwing themselves over a cliff
 and you just approach the crowd just as that's happening.
 And you take one look at it and go, pfft,
 where's that in the Torah, right?
 There's all these unclean animals who throw themselves around.
 You just destroyed the livelihood of the people in that village.
 There's this naked guy rolling around on the ground.
 This can't be God and you leave and you just think everything I heard is right.
 The guy's a maniac.
 This is insane.
 That's all you see.
 That's all you see and you go away.
 And that's what a lot of our critics did.
 They would either not show up or they would scour YouTube and find the worst
 video. So they would miss, you know, they would just come for the end of the
 ministry time and just go, this can't be God.
 Look at all these people rolling around on the floor.
 And John's point was a snapshot as a cheap shot.
 You know, you just go in with your,
 with a still camera, take a picture,
 and just say, "That can't be good."
 A much better approach is to take a video camera,
 because if we go back to the example
 of being a young Jewish person,
 trying to work out if Jesus is a messiah or not,
 if you had stayed around and not walked off
 because you were offended,
 you would have later seen that that naked man
 who was a demoniac is now fully clothed
 and dressed and in his right mind.
 And in the same way
 the people who just look at YouTube videos and go, it's the Kundalini Spirit's ridiculous,
 completely missed the fact that there was maybe an hour, at least an hour, probably
 two hours of glorious God-honoring worship, then there would be the preaching of the word,
 there would be salvation where people would get saved, and then there would be ministry
 time.
 And even then, when it was absolutely crazy, if you would interview the people and say
 what was God doing, you would often find life-changing events happening.
 Yeah, and they could talk and they knew what was going on with them. They weren't in some sort of weird trance or anything like that.
 Right. One of the greatest examples of this was the first time I met Steve Long. I didn't know Steve,
 and he was administering in Glasgow. And I'd driven through from Edinburgh to see what he was doing.
 And he just stood up and said, "Hi, my name is Steve. It's great to be here. I'm one of the pastors in Toronto.
 And I'm here to teach on healing. But maybe before we teach on it, maybe we should just demonstrate it.
 So why don't we find the sickest person in the room
 and we'll get them healed
 and then everybody after that should be really easy?
 What do you think?
 And I'm thinking, wait, what are we doing?
 And so he just said,
 "Who do you think the sickest person in the room is?"
 And we all agreed it was the lady in the wheelchair.
 So then I said, "Who's never healed somebody before?"
 And two women put up their hands and he said,
 "All right, well you come out and so what we're gonna do
 "is you're gonna ask the lady if she's okay
 "with you putting your hands on her."
 So she said, yeah.
 And so we said, all right, then what you're gonna do
 is you're just gonna ask the Holy Spirit to come.
 So these two women who've never prayed
 or never seen a sick person heal before are standing.
 Next, they're women who's in a wheelchair
 and they just say the words, Holy Spirit come.
 And all of a sudden,
 these two women who are praying star wobbling and giggling
 and kind of jerking all over the place.
 And Steve's coming and he's, wow, look at that.
 That's really weird.
 And so interviews, the ladies go,
 like what are you feeling?
 like we're feeling power go through our body." And he's like, "Oh." And he said, "Yeah, it still
 looks weird though, doesn't it folks?" And then he said to the lady in the wheelchair, "How are you
 feeling?" She's like, "I feel amazing." He said, "What do you mean I feel amazing?" He said, "Well,
 all my pain's going away and I feel this warm sensation of love." And he said, "Does it bother
 you that the women who are praying for you are jerking?" And she said, "No, I feel amazing."
 And he's like, "That's interesting, isn't it?" You know, should it be any surprise that something
 happens to our bodies when we allow the power of God to flow through us.
 Right. Well, again, Johnny used to say if you were to lick your fingers and stick
 them in the socket in the wall, your body would have a reaction, you know, how much
 more the power of God. So yeah, I mean, certainly it's, yeah, sometimes it's
 challenging and you have to just go, okay, I don't get what's going on over there.
 I can check back in later, but I'm going to choose to not enter into
 judgment because actually that would rob you of being able to enter into what the Holy Spirit
 has for you.
 And to be fair, sometimes it's absolutely just the flesh.
 Yeah.
 It's people making stuff up.
 Yeah.
 You know, so let's, you know, let's just say everything that's happening is God.
 No, I think though, even when it, when it is the flesh, often it's those people are so
 desperate to feel a touch from the Lord that they think that manufacturing something will
 help them get there.
 You know, I don't think it's out of like some kind of devious.
 No, they think if I do what they're doing, I'll get what they're getting.
 Right.
 Mark DuPont's point was brilliant.
 He just said, I don't understand why you're upset about whether it's the flesh.
 You've had flesh in your church for years.
 Most of us just been cold flesh, not hot flesh.
 And what you remember that is for years, you have people who are faking, being in touch
 with the Holy Spirit, you people who come in and who sing songs and give money and sit down.
 And they're well behaved people who are operating in the flesh.
 And that's what upsets us.
 And I think probably the root issue is anything, like you said,
 outside of our comfort zone causes us concern.
 Yeah.
 Because I remember getting really offended by people racing their hands
 in worship.
 And then I remember getting over that and I'm like, I'm good.
 And then I got really offended by people falling over.
 And then I was OK with that.
 And then I got, you know, then I actually got quite comfortable with what
 the Holy Spirit was doing.
 And then I was at a church service where they started praying for people to get gold teeth and I was completely offended.
 See, I loved, I loved the gold teeth because I worked at the building right next door of the church when I worked for National Car Rental.
 And when the whole gold teeth thing was happening, I brought a whole bunch of people over a couple times from National Car Rental.
 Well, the services were on, I would just bring them in.
 You know, I would find it.
 I would, you know, beep somebody and say, is it prayer time?
 Yeah, it is.
 And I bring them over and they get prayed for it and they get gold teeth.
 And like one of the VPs got a gold tooth and.
 So let me stop you there for a second because we just casually mentioned this story.
 But my problem, and I should say, I don't have a problem.
 That was one of my favorite miracles to see.
 It's absolutely one of my favorite things to see a malgum filling turn into gold
 fillings.
 I think it's remarkable.
 I don't know why it fascinates me so much, but it does.
 Or when people's whole tooth goes gold.
 I love that.
 But let's just stop for a second.
 The reason I was so offended was why would God,
 you know, with all the starving children in the world,
 why would God bother about gold teeth?
  </li><li>Maybe it's just a sign that makes you wonder.
 I mean, you gotta think gold to God
 is just a pavement of heaven.
  </li><li>Right, and amalgam fillings are highly toxic.
  </li><li>Right.
 So anyway, this one VP that came over,
 he got a solid gold tooth and it turned out,
 he had been, you know, just kind of dormant
 in his relationship with the Lord for a while.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And after that happened, he was like,
 oh my gosh, God is real, I have to,
 you know, I have to reignite this relationship, you know,
 that he'd like grow dormant.
 So that was really, really cool.
 And you know, I got to lead a couple of people
 to alert as a result,
 'cause they just came in and they were like,
 I don't know, I came in, my teeth were black,
 now they're gold, God must be real,
 tell me about God.
  </li><li>Right, it's crazy.
  </li><li>It was so fun, like I loved it.
 I wasn't offended, but it's funny,
 a lot of people got offended about the gold teeth.
 You know, exactly why would God do that?
 I don't know, 'cause he's got it
 and he gets to decide what he does.
  </li><li>Tell me the story of Shannon's Nana.
 Because that was one of the, like for me, that settled my heart.
 Like I heard her at the 10 year anniversary, Randy had her up giving her testimony.
 And you know, you know her better than I do, but I, I, I just remember her saying
 these lines, I was dignified but dying.
 So set up the story and set up what happened.
 Oh gosh.
 The best of your memory.
 Okay, best of my memory.
 Well, Shannon, if you're listening to this, you know that
 practice. Yeah. Nana's name is Carol for her first name. And I
 think she was a nurse at one point. She was. Yeah. But her
 house started going downhill, she ended up with like lupus and
 then a whole bunch of other things like a slew of things. So
 she lived with Shannon and her family because she couldn't
 live on her own. She couldn't take care of herself. She was on
 something like 40 something medications a day.
 And she was dying.
 And she was literally dying and there's nothing they could do to help her.
 She was weak.
 You know, she, they had to help her go to the, you know, get into the bathroom,
 all that kind of stuff.
 Like she was, you know, basically her whole body was shutting down.
 And when the renewal started, they brought her to the renewal.
 And I can't remember if they brought her several nights in a row or what the deal
 was, but she, um, you know, to begin with, which most conservative Christians didn't,
 but she didn't like it.
 You know, she was like, how can this be God?
 And right because it looked like everybody was wrong.
 It looked like craziness.
 I really did.
 And, um, anyway, she got totally wasted, totally like totally drunk to the point where they
 as a family had to pick her up and carry her to the car.
 She couldn't walk, she couldn't help them at all.
  </li><li>And she said in her testimony that the reason
 she was so drunk was she had a vision of a wine glass
 and Jesus was in the wine glass, which sounds so offensive.
 And she fell into it.
 And the moment she fell into it,
 she was absolutely overcome by the Holy Spirit's presence
 and was completely inebriated.
 Like couldn't walk, couldn't talk, had no function.
 home and for three days she couldn't do a thing on her own.
 Like not a thing.
 She couldn't feed herself.
 She just laughed.
 She just laughed.
 She just lied around laughing, but she got totally healed of everything off of
 every medication.
 I think it's funny that we not only want like, yes, do we want sick people
 healed?
 Yeah, we absolutely do.
 But we don't only want that.
 We want to dictate how it happens.
 Right.
 Guess what?
 You don't get to be God.
 Right. And he seems to take great delight in messing with us.
 Yeah.
 You know, John once asked the Lord, he said, you know, Lord, you seem to really
 enjoy it when people fall down when we pray for them.
 I don't understand that.
 And the Lord said to them, well, John, it deals very effectively with two
 conditions of the human heart that I don't care for.
 One fear and the other pride.
 Because fear says, well, God, I really want you, but I don't want, you know,
 what are these people going to think?
 Right.
 And pride says, well, I want you, but I'm not going to do that.
 Right.
 And he says, in one file, it deals with those very, very effectively.
 It requires huge humility to just stand up and say, yeah, I'd like to receive
 prayer and go to the front of the church, because what if nothing happens?
 Or worse, what if something does happen?
 And, you know, I know from my experience that when I met the Holy Spirit for the first
 I was just broken.
 I was recovering from a nervous breakdown.
 I was recovering from, you know, really being suicidal, being overwhelmed with grief and despair.
 And I met the Holy Spirit.
 Somebody prayed for me and I fell down, which was uncommon to me.
 And when I hit the floor, I just sobbed for 45 minutes and inside, I'm just like, get it together, Jones.
 What are you like?
 What are you doing?
 And I'm just doing that, you know, chest, you know, wailing.
 And when I got up from that, I didn't see in Technicolor, I didn't have angelic
 visitations, I wasn't speaking tongues, I almost thought nothing had happened and yet everything had
 happened. And from that point on, it took me a couple of years really to process what happened.
 But I remember in going to Toronto, the most overwhelming feeling I would have when the Holy
 Spirit would touch me would be like a warm, heavy blanket, like a duvet falling on me, where you're
 unable to get up because you're just surrounded with love and you're being suffocated with his
 goodness. And as a result, you've seen me so many times, your speech is slurred, you're just
 absolutely inebriated in his love, and you're just overwhelmed. And if you think about it,
 in the natural, like I remember when I was first dating you, just seeing you would have
 a physical effect on my emotions and on my body. For sure. You know, my pupils would
 dilate, my breathing with intense. When you'd hold my hands, I'd get this warm tingly feeling.
 And then your hands would get sweaty. Yeah, I would like tremble on the inside. And that's
 just me encountering a human. And you're having a physical manifestation in my body.
 What is it like when a human has an encounter with the person of love right?
 John says it's not surprising that we have a physical reaction to encountering
 The career of the world the surprising thing is that we live through the experience right?
 I think my craziest thing that shut me up pretty quick was I remember it was the parties here conference July
 2002 and I went and I was so offended
 Because carol was a good off the stage and was wandering around throwing and i'm making air quotes with my fingers here fireballs.
 To wait what actually look like was this grown woman wandering around to my eyes pretending to throw things people which was completely invisible and then to my absolute horror.
 it would seem that when people got hit again in air quotes by a fireball they would double over and i think seriously why are we tolerating this woman doing this ridiculous thing.
 And i'm just offended i'm thinking we just move on you know i'm just upset and i'm just happy myself right just listen my indignation just.
 Things not being done decently order to the next night they do test anytime and they just say i'm gonna test when the woman gets up.
 And the woman starts out her testimony saying exactly why i said you know i just was horrified that this woman was running around the room throwing fireballs of people thinking seriously is this what we've come to.
 She said until she came to the end of my eye and through a fireball at me i want to hit me my death your pop to open.
 And i was suddenly like oh okay.
 I don't think that person cares that care was throwing a fireball because her deaf ear just got healed.
 Again, we're back to dictating the way that we're going to get healed.
 I'm sure it was pretty offensive when Jesus spat in the ground and made mud and put on somebody's eyes.
 Oh sure.
 You're like, "Where's that in the Torah?"
 Well, it wasn't until he did that.
 So people get hung up with, "Well, where's that in the Bible?"
 And the truth is there's lots of weird stuff in the Bible.
 Plenty of weird stuff in the Bible.
 And actually that question, where's that in the Bible is a really good question to ask if the motive of your heart is right.
 I've had people say to me, where's that in the Bible?
 And people say, Hey, can you help me?
 I'm just struggling with where that's in the Bible.
 The first, I don't have a lot of time for the second.
 I'll spend hours talking about.
 We have to wrap up.
 Oh, yes, let's wrap it up.
 You know what I want us to do was I want to do a couple of things.
 Do you want to sing a wrap up song?
 I don't definitely don't want to do that.
 Okay, I'm someone call them at age is having a heart attack.
 That's me rapping.
 I have some closing thoughts.
 Okay.
 And then I'd like to do closing prayer.
 Okay.
 My closing thoughts are there's a bunch of new articles up on our website, Alan and
 AJ.com.
 There's some articles are soaking on getting stuff done.
 And our most recent article, which goes live tomorrow, is all about believing
 and the importance of believing God.
 But we are going to write an article on manifestations.
 So if this is kind of prunted more questions and we've given answers for hold on,
 we'll probably post a link to a teaching on manifestations,
 but we're also going to write an article on manifestation.
 So that will be up in a couple of weeks that you can have there.
 But I wanted to close with praying for people,
 especially people who've been maybe weird today or people have been sent weird YouTube
 videos and maybe you've backed off from pursuing the Holy Spirit for fear that
 you are going to somehow get a legal spirit or,
 And you've got to remind yourself of Jesus said, you know, if you ask your father for the Holy Spirit,
 you're not going to get an evil spirit.
 If you ask him for bread, he's not going to give you a stone.
 If you ask him for fish, you're not going to get a serpent.
 That's not who he is.
 It's not what he's like.
 So let me pray for you.
 And then you can go by the rest of your day and me having an incredible week.
 But Father, Adrian, I just pray for all these wonderful listeners, Lord, I ask that your heart
 would be revealed to them, Lord, that they don't need to fear walking with you.
 that yes, you're an amazing, powerful God who's incredibly loving and incredibly fun.
 And Lord, I just ask that you would break off any fear that we may have, Lord, that we're
 going to get some counterfeit spirit.
 And Lord, you're good and you're great and you're amazing.
 And we just pray, Lord, a feeling of the Holy Spirit and everybody who's listening right
 now, that we would not try and control you, but we would yield to what you're doing.
 And we would recognize that you're God and we're not.
 Lord, you would just fill us up with an incredible week.
 And Lord, you just bless us in incredible ways.
 And we thank you for your goodness and your kindness.
 In Jesus' name, amen.
