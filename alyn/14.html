<p> All stuff yes, how are you? I'm good.<br/>
 We should really try recording these podcasts really close one night.
 It'd probably be way less distracting. Yeah, and warmer.
 Welcome to keeping up with the Joneses, just another normal week in the life of Alan and AJ.
 You're fully deluded, but really cute.
 Tell me about this week. I've forgotten. Becky Duller came out to me in church this morning. I was like,
 "Hey, how was your weekend?" I was like, "Thinking, thinking. I'm sorry I live in the now. I don't remember."
 It was just a busy week. We're getting ready for school four. And so it's been getting ready for
 retreat, staff retreat next week. And shortly came back from Africa. Yes.
 Our long suffering assistant was in Africa.
 Long suffering indeed.<br/>
 And we missed her.<br/>
 Readfully, she got back.<br/>
 So that was awesome.<br/>
 It was very good.<br/>
 Along with the rest of the team who survived.
 And we had a highly social week, if I remember correctly.
 We saw lots of people.<br/>
 I don't know if you is probably not an average person.
 We're called highly social, but certainly highly social for you.
 As I veered out of my cave several times.
 Yes.<br/>
 No, but I'm thinking we saw a bunch of people.
 I met up with lots of people.<br/>
 Well, Brett's birthday party.<br/>
 You.<br/>
 Yeah, we picked up Brett's birth party.
 And we went to T-N-E-Mute and Ninja Turtles, which I think is going to get an Academy Award.
 For what?<br/>
 Something.<br/>
 Uh huh.<br/>
 Moving on.<br/>
 And then we, yeah, we had SO cell alumni week.
 Josh and Mary got married.<br/>
 You were at their wedding.<br/>
 Yes, it was beautiful.<br/>
 I stayed home because we had a baby who had a 103 degree favor.
 Well, he had that.<br/>
 We had a couple of days before, but.<br/>
 Well, I'm pretty sure he would have been a nightmare.
 It was a tiny stone church.<br/>
 Absolutely beautiful, but there's no way MJ would have sat through the ceremony.
 Or be well, that's true, but I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.
 So we would have had a screeching baby and a tiny stone chapel.
 Bad idea.<br/>
 Crystal.<br/>
 Terrible.<br/>
 I stayed with home.<br/>
 I stayed with home him.<br/>
 I stayed home with him.<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 And then Josh and Terry got back from some graduating students of ours who graduated
 the school then went immediately to India and Germany and all over Europe on Spain and
 missions work and chocolate collecting work which they brought me a giant bar of Tobler
 own. They brought us a giant bar of Tobler. Not the way my belly saw it. Have you finished
 it already? Of course. Jones. It's been 24 hours. Oh dear. Maybe you snooze you lose as
 That's a good book says.<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 I'm going to have to get you a taser collar.
 Talk to us about American Ninja Warrior and our children's love of that show.
 Oh my goodness.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So all three of our kids love the American Ninja Warrior and we have a confidential friend
 or a confidence friend who shall remain nameless who is actually training to be on it, which
 I think would be very exciting.<br/>
 We do?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 How did I not know that?<br/>
 Well, I'm not telling you because then you'll like say their names and I'm not sure that they
 want anybody to know.<br/>
 it to me. No. So, but I am hoping that they get on it and then we could go and do this
 person. Yes. I'll tell you later, drawing. Anyway, so
 Man or Woman. Moving right along. Yeah, the kids absolutely love this.
 She is not a good foundation for her healthy marriage. Can't keep secrets, baby.
 so the girls love it and they keep going oh my goodness i can't believe they do that i can accept
 and m_j_ says uh oh and covers up his mouth every time somebody falls
 and then if they make it to an end of an obstacle he throws his arms in the air
 and he else so if you have never seen the show super cute it's like wipe out on steroids oh it's
 amazing you have this i mean i watch it and i'm not sure i'm the same species as these
</p><ul>
  <li>Right.
  </li><li>But what's adorable is my seven year old and five year old
 are convinced that keep asking,
 "Daddy, could you do that?
 "Could you do that?
 "Could you do that?"
  </li><li>They're pretty sure you could do anything.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm, sure.
  </li><li>Which of course I couldn't.
 I'm not sure I could climb the steps
 to start American Ninja Warrior.
 If you're bored, go to YouTube and just Google,
 well, go to YouTube and search
 for American Ninja Warrior and just watch something.
  </li><li>Or it's on Hulu.
  </li><li>That's amazing.
 And the final start this week.
  </li><li>Yes, they do.
 Very exciting.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 Um, lastly, we got a robot.
 We did.
 Every family should have a robot.
 Yeah.
 Our 2D2.
 I got set up.
 Serves drinks.
 Sweeping on floor.
 I actually put my back out sweeping the floor.
 So the last of my birthday money, I went to Best Buy and covered
 a ridiculous deal on a floor mopping robot.
 I'm pretty sure if you can put your back out while sweeping the floor, that
 definitely means you couldn't do the American Ninja Warrior.
 Well, it was pretty vigorous floor sweeping.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 handle the ears, jumping from the breakfast bar, back flip on so far.
 Wow.
 I kind of play like pirates.
 I don't touch a ground while I'm sweeping.
 It's particularly spectacular.
 But anyway, I just have a nerdy little robot that does household duties.
 So I'm very happy about that.
 We call him Bob.
 We got some reader's questions.
 I realize I've been calling them listeners questions.
 Oh, no, wrong way round.
 We've got listeners questions and I refer to them as reader's questions.
 Of course, they're not readers questions.
 They're probably not reading.
 No, they're listeners questions.
 We got some amazing ones.
 You guys are writing some excellent questions
 that are actually such good questions
 that demand such good response
 that I can't fit them in in this segment.
 So maybe we'll turn them into podcasts themselves.
 But the ones that we do have that we can ask,
 Jared wrote in and said, "Hey, I was wondering
 "when the details of the Heaven Declares conference
 "will be released."
 We do two conferences a year at Grace Center.
 We do the more conference which happens
 and more will do we can typically.
  </li><li>Hi, Jared.
 And then we run one in the fall called Heaven Declares.
 And this year's Heaven Declares will be running at Grace Center.
 It's going to be running the weekend 23rd to the 26th of October.
 And we have Artie Kendall, and we have Bobby Connor coming to speak.
 And in the next coming weeks, we're going to be doing a lot of promo stuff for a Grace
 Center.
 But there you go.
 That's a neat preview.
 Oh, boop.
 Cindy Rowan and asked, "What advice would you give a dating couple now on length of
 time to date before marriage?"
 Because she said you mentioned that john said three months and Fred said four seasons when we're telling our story think last week.
 She's i'm just curious of your opinion i think it'd be largely dependent on the people involved.
 And the relative emotional health and relational health of that couple of you that kind of thing yeah we know couples who.
 You know got married ridiculously fast and it's worth everything Gary and syram organ for goodness sake probably win the world record for.
 speed with which to i remember get we were in England he calls to take you to my.
 Grimsman and then you come over to Florida in whenever it was a man you're supposed to go in June in June of new Zealand floor and i was like sure.
 And then the next day call back to we're getting married on Friday.
 I was at that close all i don't know it was close it was a family we couldn't make it it was sad i'm still sad we missed that winning yeah but they're awesome.
 My aunt and uncle, they've been married for gosh, I don't even know.
 Over 30 years and they met each other and got engaged within three weeks.
 And they've had eight kids and, you know, they're so sometimes God just moves differently.
 Right. So I think it's solid dependent on the people, the counsel that God's given through various
 people and what you're feeling in your heart. Yeah.
 I think if we got married in June, I would have just been freaked out like john's advice.
 I wasn't ready to marry you.
 No.
 Took me what?
 It took me pretty much several months.
 So we got engaged.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We got engaged because I just decided I can't live in turmoil anymore.
 All right.
 Was it a good decision, baby?
 Yeah, it was an awesome decision.
 You kidding me?
 Come on.
 Fantastic decision.
 Ten years in January.
 We got another question from Josh about suffering.
 Thanks, Josh.
 which the question itself is longer than the answer I normally give on these things.
 And I thought, let's leave suffering for a week when we're not talking about dating,
 which drumroll please. We don't want to put the two of those things together.
 No, especially when that's the topic for discussion this week.
 So behind the scenes this week, there was an article posted to Facebook
 all about courtship or courting, which by the way, let's just get this out of the way,
 "Cording is the dumbest name ever. I just don't like that name at all. I don't care what your definition is."
 "Cording, that title should just be banned." It was an article about dating and courting,
 and it got lots of likes on Facebook, and lots of people had either contacted us or texted us or
 just... I've forwarded it to you, S. Yeah, what are your thoughts? What do you think about? And I
 thought, "Well, you know, it's interesting because I'm thinking about talking about dating anyway,
 So we'll have a stab at talking about dating.
 And I think a lot of the reason that they did forward it to us, babe,
 is because we teach on it and we have a, you know, we have a teaching on it.
 Right.
 But yeah, we do.
 I think it's worth very different definitions of things.
 And probably very different culture from which we would think from.
 I'm just reading this guy's article, which will post a link to in the show notes.
 I'm realizing, wow, you have a paradigm that we just don't have.
 and you clearly have a social and cultural perspective that I've not been a part of.
 So I can't really comment on that.
 Should be noted that out of everything we teach, and we teach a wide range of materials,
 probably the most controversial topic we teach on, which really shouldn't be is this whole topic
 of relationships and dating.
 And by controversial, I mean, the thing that stirs up the most upsetness.
 Oh, yeah, we've had people get really upset, which is crazy.
 when you think about all the stuff we teach on.
 But this is the thing that people get upset by.
 Because I think it hits close to people's hearts or close to their fears anyway.
 Right.
 So with that in mind, yes, don't be hating.
 Are you advising me not to be hating or the people that are listening?
 Okay.
 You don't have to have the same opinion as us.
 No, you can be wrong if you wish.
 Just kidding.
 Sorry.
 Okay.
 That was a told joke.
 I apologize.
 Bad.
 But really.
 So we're going to be talking about dating.
 Yes.
 Do you want to kick off about this article?
 Why don't you give an overview of what the article is as you read it and understand it?
 Well, essentially, the fellow who wrote the article
 is a fellow named Thomas who it would seem it was a homeschooler and maybe
 I don't know grew up a little, it sounds like more sheltered or in a different Christian experience than what we've had.
 That's a better way of saying it.
 Yeah.
 And, um, and so he read, uh, Joshua, what's his name?
 Uh,
 No idea.
 Harris,
 Darn Harris, maybe I kissed dating goodbye and it sounds like he was the poster boy for, um, courtship.
 Um, but has now, uh, headed in the opposite direction.
 or in a different direction. Let's say that. So it's an interesting article. I would agree
 with some of his thoughts. I would categorically disagree with some of his thoughts or though
 his processing of information is drastically different from my own. Let's say that.
 It would help to know if he's married or unmarried. I couldn't tell from reading his article and
 I didn't spend enough time looking it up. But his definition of courtship, which again,
 I've already expressed my dislike for that phrase, but his definition of courtship is as follows.
 The man must ask the woman's father permission before pursuing the woman romantically.
 There's high accountability, so there's chaperones and monitored correspondence.
 Dear Lord, is this North Korea rules about physical contact and purity.
 The purpose of the courtship is marriage, high relational intentionality and intensity,
 and high parental involvement. Now, I should stay at the outset that there is a bit of a blur for
 those of us, for those of you who are familiar with our teaching. I am going to exclusively refer
 to courtship in this conversation as what he's describing courtship is.
 And then we will refer to what we see as dating done wrong and dating done right.
 Dating done right would be our wisdom, our advice, our collective thoughts.
 The difficulty here is some of the things that he's listing as courtship and some
 of the things that we suggest in dating done right sound very similar.
 And the call not just listed.
 But I would say that there the the the distinguishing facets between, you know,
 On paper, we may look the same about what we agree with would be the heart, the motive,
 the intent, and the follow through.
 In the presence of the Holy Spirit in the entire scenario.
 So for example, in our story, your father was dead when I started dating, so I couldn't
 ask him with permission.
 Yes.
 Very difficult, whether dead.
 Which you may have done.
 You heard that I did go and ask your spiritual dad, John and Fred.
 The reason for that was not a rule of thumb, like, "Hey, this is the operating culture
 at Toronto that you have to go and ask the father."
 I think that's a little excessive, but the reason in your situation was you were married
 before and got really, really badly wounded and you had a team of people who loved you
 and were super protective of your heart.
 Yes.
 And so, you know, it wasn't, I wouldn't make a general rule of thumb that people go have
 to go ask a father.
 I don't think it's necessarily a bad idea if you have a healed up father who loves you
 and hears the Holy Spirit.
 Well, I, you know, I would say, yeah, I would absolutely want them to be involved.
 Right.
 Hey, would you like to go out for lunch with me? I don't think you need to ask a dad before you say
 Hey, can I take a door out for lunch? That just sounds a little bit
 No, in fact, we did go out for lunch before you talked to John right in a group right yeah, so high accountability
 We'd absolutely be for high accountability. Yeah, but not monitored correspondence
 I don't even know what that is. Are we reading each other's text? Yeah, and the high accountability
 Doesn't come from so I'm a pastor
 So if I see two people dating the accountability doesn't come for me like guys
 I've noticed that you are now dating or are you courting and because you are now I would like you to you know
 Come to my office every week and tell me how far you have gone and that's not that's control
 That's not accountability what I would encourage people who are doing dating done right in terms of
 Accountability is you find someone that you want to be accountable to and you go to them and say hey
 Could you please do you know how to keep me accountable?
 Not help me out top down
 Yeah control. It's you looking for help and input and wisdom and counsel
 I mean having said that we did ask John and Carol to ask us hard questions
 And you know and then we also have my point Kathy and we asked them
 They didn't come to us and say because you're now dating in our culture and we're a matriarch or patriarch
 We will do this right, but we did want high accountability because otherwise you're gonna screw up right?
 Yes, absolutely
 Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 Rules about physical contact and purity.
 Again, any man-made top-down imposed rules are always going to fail.
 But when you decide, "I want to put rules on my conduct," when I actually want to have
 some accountability and you generate them internally, then you're going to have a higher
 and a greater level of success rate as in.
 So let's talk about that.
 Do you remember how we did it?
 And we, after you had met with John and with Fred and...
 I forgot the go ahead to sue you.
 Yes.
 So we knew we were, I was traveling somewhere in the UK and I was going to meet up in Scotland
 with you and meet your family.
 And at this point we'd been, you know, doing dating done right for five weeks.
 We hadn't held hands, we hadn't kissed, we hadn't whatever.
 We're just chatting.
 And doing lots of lunches dinners.
 With lots of people there.
 Yeah. But we'd also done dinners on our own and just connecting. Yeah, we done some, but we don't,
 also, I mean, because we traveled, we didn't get to see each other that much. So there's lots of
 emailing and stuff like that. Nobody's reading my email. But of course, I'm asking the Holy Spirit
 to be a part of everything that's going on. So we come, we know we're going to meet at your parents
 place. And we decide, okay, we need to talk about what are our boundaries going to be. So we each
 individual boundaries. So we each individually pray about, okay, Lord, what do I want that
 to look like? Go ahead. And then you.
 And yeah, I saw I went ahead. And the reason we did that was it's folly to think, you know,
 that whole thing of if you fail to plan, you plan to fail. So if I just assume, well, I'm a
 godly person and I read the Bible and I pray therefore, I will not fall in sexual immorality.
 That's just ludicrous right absolutely.
 And so I just thought I don't want to screw this relationship relationship up.
 So I just went ahead and said, holy spirit, would you just help me because she's as hot as can be.
 And left to my own devices.
 I'd be all over that like white on rice.
 So I'm a god.
 The man is that he made weight on right.
 I'll show you later.
 OK.
 So I just thought I actually want to treat you with, you know, real nobility.
 And I, you know, I want to be really tentative.
 And I did.
 I just didn't want to screw up.
 But the last thing I want to do is sit in Jeff's office and just go, not Jeff's office.
 John's office and just goes, so, you know, we can't screw it up and age is pregnant.
 And even though that's the furthest thing from my head that could possibly happen, we've
 got just enough stories of that happening.
 It'd be ludicrous to think it won't happen.
 Yeah, we wanted to set ourselves up to succeed.
 Right.
 So I went away and just asked the Lord and came up with a list of things that I wanted to have in our relationship.
 Now, please note, this wasn't John Arnott saying, "Oh, you're going to date my daughter.
 Here's a list of rules I'm going to expect you to stand by because that's never going
 to work."
 And that says intrinsic motivation.
 Yeah, you need to be having this discussion with God about what you want your life to
 look like.
 He's saying courtship is rules about physical contact and purity.
 Like, "Oh my gosh, it's not good."
 Whereas I'm saying, "Okay, yeah, but rules for physical contact and purity are great
 if we're from the right heart and with the right motive."
 Yeah, we came up with them and,
 came out with them and stuck with them, praise God.
  </li><li>And I remember going for a walk with you.
 Some place very green near your parents place.
 It was very pretty.
  </li><li>That's pretty much all Scotland.
  </li><li>There was a bridge. - Was it raining?
  </li><li>Yes. - Yeah, okay.
 It was in Scotland. - And of course.
 Yes, it was definitely in Scotland.
 And it was just like this public park,
 we're walking along and I think that was the first time
 we actually held hands.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you just went, you actually went,
 you went backwards, didn't you?
 You said, these are things I'm absolutely not gonna do.
  </li><li>Or these are things we are absolutely not gonna do.
  </li><li>Yeah, we are absolutely not gonna do.
  </li><li>'Cause I thought let's just declare it
 so that we know what the boundaries are,
 so that we know when we're crossing them,
 or if we're crossing them.
 So I started backwards again,
 we're absolutely not gonna have sex.
 I'm sure you were pretty shocked by that.
  </li><li>I was like, yes, hopefully there's more to it
 than that.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're absolutely not gonna have oral sex.
 We're absolutely, I'm not gonna touch any part of your body
 that I couldn't touch if we were on ministry team.
  </li><li>We're never gonna lie down together,
 whether we're closed or not closed.
  </li><li>We're not gonna be unclothed.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I just kind of worked backwards
 and up the chain just so it was explicit,
 which I imagine made your heart feel super safe.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I mean, we ended up essentially at,
 we're basically gonna get to hold hands
 and talk and spend time together.
 But hand holding baby was never so good.
  </li><li>Right. - Mm-hmm.
 your Lord handled it.
  </li><li>We used to have to let go of each other's hands
 because we would be too like,
 okay, you can't take anymore.
 Which probably sounds very funny.
  </li><li>Very ridiculous.
  </li><li>But it was true.
  </li><li>The purpose of the courtship is marriage.
 And so with Dainton Right,
 the purpose of Dainton Right is not marriage.
 The purpose of Dainton Right
 is to see if this person is eligible for marriage.
 And that's a huge big distinction.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think Dainton Right,
 the purpose of dating in Dainton Wrong
 is to fill an empty need
 to make yourself feel good about yourself.
 That's a terrible reason to do anything.
 Right.
 You're trying people on for sides like their shoes.
 Right.
 High relational intentionality and intensity.
 Can we go back to that shoe thing for a second?
 Because one of the things that he says is,
 he's talking about his grandmother and she's saying,
 "How can you tell what you want to marry
 "if you aren't going out on dates?"
 And I just think that's a very,
 it's an interesting argument.
 Why can't you tell by having friends?
 I mean, so I know what kind of person I'm looking for,
 not only because the Holy Spirit is speaking to me,
 but because I have lots of different friends
 and I know, for example,
 I really enjoy being with people that make me laugh.
 I don't need to date somebody.
  </li><li>You're welcome.
  </li><li>But seriously, right?
 Like I really enjoy being with intelligent people.
 So I mean, I'm already building a list
 of what I'm looking for. - Again, I'm welcome.
  </li><li>In a spouse by just having normal relationships
 with normal people.
 I don't have to date those people to figure that out.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>That was my thought on that.
  </li><li>I'm not sure what I have to do with shoes,
 but I love you.
  </li><li>Well, yes.
 You know, anytime we can talk about shoes, baby.
  </li><li>High relational intentionality.
 I think it would be good
 if you're intentional in your relationships.
 That's just me.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But maybe I'm missing the sound.
  </li><li>But it doesn't sound like in this particular model,
 there's any fun involved.
 We had a lot of fun.
  </li><li>You mean, and his definition of courtship
 Yes. Yeah, it does. It sounds all intense. Right.
 And, you know, there's no Ikea dates.
 And I'm to be fair.
 You're supposed to be both. So that's very sad.
 Let's talk about, let's finish this list.
 But then let's talk about some of the misunderstandings
 that people who have heard are teaching on dating done right
 and the criticisms that they've come up with.
 Because I feel like there are some of the things he's trying to address in this article.
 OK.
 The last thing he was talking about is high parental involvement.
 fathers typically hold a permission and control role rather than a traditional advice and blessing
 role held by their fathers. I don't really have a comment on that. I would say a lot of the...
 I have kind of a comment on that. My thought is that's probably going to come more down to
 your relationship with your dad. Again, you know, for us in our circumstance, I have a very healed up
 dad that I'm asking to be involved. A dad who hears God and I know loves me and loves
 people. I get it that that would be really a tricky situation if you had a very authoritarian
 father or something like that in a mix.
 I would say that when I read the rest of the article,
 I just found it quite sad, really.
 I was reading it, I'm just going,
 yeah, I don't really agree with a lot of the thinking
 and certainly the arguments for it seemed a little bit weak,
 flaky, but what I did like was the end part,
 which was really practical.
 I'm scrolling to this here.
 Let's talk some specific suggestions for single women
 and suggestions for single men.
 I agreed with almost all of them.
 I thought, yeah, that's some real practical wisdom there.
 Again, suggestions for both single men and single women.
 There was a few things I was like, eh, but on the whole,
 I think it was real wisdom and I was really happy
 with the outcome.
 I also thought it was interesting that the majority
 of the people that asked for our opinion on this
 were single people, which kind of makes sense
 given the topic of the article.
 I didn't really get too much feedback from my couples,
 but I guess maybe they skipped the article.
  </li><li>Maybe.
  </li><li>Or maybe.
  </li><li>Or thought on, so his advice is hey, date more,
 but you get into semantics.
  </li><li>And I think some of his advice for single females
 aptly points out that he's not a female
 and doesn't probably know how they think.
  </li><li>What do you mean by that?
  </li><li>Well, I think, I'm trying to think,
 there was a couple of things where I was like,
 yeah, that's probably not gonna work.
 Like he's talking about if you're going out on a date
 on Thursday with Bob, but you know,
 you're also going out on a date on Saturday with Bill,
 you're not gonna fall in love with Bob
 because you know you're gonna date Bill in two days
 and I'm just like, you have no idea how women's minds work
 if you think that that's gonna work.
 You know? - Right.
  </li><li>So, I mean, there's things like that
 where I'm like, that may sound like wisdom to a guy
 if that's not a horrible thing to say,
 but that's just not, you know, anyway.
  </li><li>So here's, let's talk about where it went right
 and where it went wrong.
 So in our culture at Ammonite, which is the young adult ministry that we help lead, is
 we have a couple of principles, a couple of guidelines.
 And again, there are wisdom, like, you know, here's the beauty of the Christian life is
 you're responsible for your own life and the way you lead it.
 And I'm not responsible for how you date, but if you're interested in wisdom, here's
 some that we've collected over the years that we found works really, really well.
 And we tend to give advice to both men and women based on the way they think.
 So the first piece of advice that we give women, all women who are single is if he has
 not told you that he is interested, he is not interested.
 Tell us why AJ Jones.
 Because women basically, I mean, I'm sorry ladies, but you know this is true.
 You know, when we like a guy, if we're in our heads, we're already married to them and
 naming our children before they've even said three words to us.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you begin this narrative that you're richly crying
 in your head. - Yes, fantasy.
  </li><li>And holding a hostage to it.
  </li><li>Is the hook, yeah.
 I mean, it's women go to fantasy.
 That's what they do in their heads.
 And so everything becomes a sign, you know?
 And well, I saw, he drives a blue car,
 and I was driving behind a blue car.
 It must mean that the Lord, you know.
 So, you know, anyway, yes.
 That's that sound ridiculous.
 We'll give you an example in a second.
 The counterpoint to that, okay, is so ladies,
 in guarding your heart, if he's not interested,
 if he hasn't told you he's interested
 and he's not interested, the counterpoint for that is,
 guys, if you are interested, then man up
 and ask her out for coffee or for lunch.
 Now, the point that people freak out of this is
 they're so concerned that if they ask the person out
 for lunch or coffee, this is a guy asking the girl out
 for coffee or lunch, they are worried
 then the girl thinks, "Okay, now you're committing to marrying me to death through this part." And
 I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no. This is you just working out whether you like each other, whether
 you're even socially compatible. You're going to have for lunch for goodness' sake. It's not the end
 of the world." The difficulty comes, so let me tell you a story. We had this girl that comes to us
 and not a girl. She's in our mid-twenties and she's like, "Hey, do you know so-and-so?" And we're
 like, "Yeah, we know really, really well." She's like, "Well, I'm having a bit of a problem." We're
 like, well, why haven't a problem? Well, I think he likes me, but I'm doing the thing where I'm not,
 you know, let my heart go there. But after about five or six days, he hasn't told me anything. So
 I just said to him, Hey, I've really enjoyed going out for, you know, dinner and lunch with you these
 six times. But I just have to wonder, is this going anywhere? And he got all upset. It's interesting
 as we had a conversation the same week with both of them. She called us going to this guy, just a
 a player. He called her going, man, what's with all the psycho women at
 Emmonie? And I was like, so tell us your story. So basically from his
 perspective, he was like, well, I work really hard. And you know, I need to eat
 lunch. And I've seen her at Emmonie. And I just thought, Oh, she'd be a fun
 person to have conversation with. So I've just been doing lunch. And it's
 just purely for company. And all of a sudden she's going praying
 mentice thinking like, why am I not ready to marry her? Like, what's wrong
 with her? And I'm like, well, you cannot fill in some of the gaps.
 fill in some of the gaps for me here. Where did you take her? Well, he took her to some of the nicest
 restaurants. So he's thinking, oh, this is just lunch. She's thinking you're conveying something
 by whining and dying me at these nice restaurants. And he's like, man, what's wrong with you?
 Yeah. But we've had that situation several times. Oh, my gosh, several times.
 Yeah. And so, and the girl is thinking, hey, what's wrong with you? And he's thinking what's wrong
 with him. But just remember guys, if you're interested, just be upfront and say it. And
 I don't think there's anything wrong with what she did and just calling him going like,
 Hey, this is great. And I love the free lunges, but I don't want to spend the next, you know,
 couple of months. You're wondering for you wondering if anything's happening.
 Right. And I actually think, you know, really, I think you can go out like once or twice and
 figure out if this is actually something you want to look at pursuing, I think five or six times.
 This is just a bit much, you know, really if at five or six times you're like,
 I still not sure then probably not.
 Right.
 I mean, I knew the first time we went and got coffee,
 just randomly went and got coffee.
 I was like, Oh, wow.
 You know, he's amazing.
 I'm totally, I'm interested.
 Right.
 I mean, so if you don't want to build something that's not there, right?
 I know I was interested, you know, the same time I saw you.
 I was like, haba haba.
 Thanks, baby. Yeah, that translates somehow. I'm sure. Probably the next biggest problem
 that we see when couples are dating, especially with God the guys, is this is incessant need
 from the guys to give blow-by-blow up-to-date information bulletin on how he's feeling about
 the relationship. Right. That's because you want to feel
 integrous, isn't it? Right. So the guy's thinking, "I'm going to be
 integrous. I'm fearing leading you on, so I will just tell you each day how I feel about
 you. Even if that includes, I'm not sure how I feel about you.
 Yeah, not helpful. No, stupid thing you could ever do. And I know that from
 experience. Yes, that's right. I'm navigating that.
 But the truth is we're trying to be
 integral and our advice is guys, be integral with another guy about what
 you're feeling. And if you come to the conclusion that you actually don't want
 to date her, then you break her up. You don't just tell her, Hey,
 you're up. I'm thinking of breaking up with you, but I'm not sure what do you
 think? Right. Just the dumbest thing ever. Right.
 The only other thing I would want to add at this point, babe, I mean,
 there's probably lots we could say and maybe if there's more questions,
 people could send in questions and we could maybe answer those more directly.
 But I think it's important to have Godly people that hear from the Lord and love
 you involved in your relationships.
 Right.
 And that's one of the things that will help keep you on course.
 And, uh, and the, and the other thing is actually I was thinking, you know, in his
 article. One of the things he says is you're never ready for marriage. So it's basically
 like jumping into a pool of cold water, you just get on with it. But I don't think that's
 good advice because I think I've met way too many people that they know they have presenting
 issues that they haven't chosen to deal with. You bring that stuff into marriage and you're
 going to have one heck of a first year, three years, five years. So if you want to get married,
 your life ready to be married with, you know, deal with your stuff, you know, deal with
 past hurts, deal with all that kind of stuff. So I don't, I think you do know when you're
 not ready to be married.
 Right. I think the one caveat to having other people in your relationship is that you've
 given them permission to be there. Sure. They're not jumping into it. You're asking them into
 it. Right. So as a pastor, you know, I'm not going to jump in. I might ask if I can jump
 like, hey, can I let you know something I see here? Or hey, would you like my opinion? But
 yeah, absolutely. Proverbs says that there's safety in the multitude of counselors. But you
 want to ask for those counselors. It's not a position that people just volunteer for.
 Right.
 I would, you know, the best piece of dating advice I heard is it's Troy, it's cliche of course. But
 I saw on Facebook and I thought, Oh gosh, that's so brilliant. It's like, you know, one piece of
 of dating advice is run hard after God if someone keeps up, introduce yourself to them.
 Right.
 Which is perfect.
 That's exactly it.
 It's totally perfect.
 Yeah, it really is.
 I think probably the best thing you can do to prepare yourself for dating is understand
 the principle that you attract the level of emotional health that you have.
 Anigma to me is all these, I mean, this isn't true for everyone, but the number of absolutely
 stunning women that we have helped pastor who have been dating guys that they've got
 no business dating in terms of talk about emotional and relational mismatches unbelievable.
 But it's a reflection of how she sees herself.
 Yeah.
 So the best thing guys and girls that you can do is pursue intimacy with Jesus and a level
 of healing in your heart that is absolutely incredible.
 And the upshot of that too, baby, is you know how people talk about, oh, well, the first
 year of marriage is the hardest.
 It doesn't have to be.
 It really doesn't have that wasn't our experience at all.
 But I mean, again, a lot of what we had done is try and deal with anything in your life
 that you could beforehand.
 And then the stuff that comes up, you can deal with it, but it's not overwhelming, you
 know, because you've spent your life trying to get your filter clean.
 I had to laugh and there's one line in this article and I'm not you know, I'm really not trying to pick apart this article. I appreciate the length you went to write it but.
 Is it he wrote this each year I waited for courtship to start working and for my homeschool friends to start getting married.
 Never happened most of them are still single some of grown bitter and jaded.
 I just thought you know there's nothing more attractive in a person and bitterness and jadedness.
 I'm really like the words.
  </li><li>There's some stuff you could work on there.
 And that's exactly what I'm talking about.
 You know this need really to beautify yourself in the Lord.
 And by that, I'm not talking about physical appearance.
 I'm talking about an internal, you know, hard character.
 When I met you, I just talked about that verse in Proverse 3,
 "What a wife of noble character who can find
 she's worth far more than rubies.
 Her husband has full confidence in her."
 And when I met you, you know, to me,
 you were just this amazing woman who had done exactly what we're talking about.
 You just chased hard after God and you were living a life transform that was so
 stinking attractive.
 We just absolutely amazing.
 That's what attracted me to you was just your passion for Jesus and your
 love for him and your, you know, the way you'd overcome so much in life.
 Can you imagine walking with the stuff that you had gone through unhealed?
 Like you just, no, I would have been, I would have been a mind feel
 waiting to happen. I mean, nightmare. Yeah. The other thing I was thinking of, you know,
 again, not wanting to attack the article, but one of the things that he talks about
 is that, you know, the divorce rate with courtship is just as high. But then later says there's
 actually no statistics. And, and I, I'm thinking of, I mean, I can think of tons of couples
 that would have gotten together, how we're talking about marriage or dating down right.
 The same sort of way we did with the same level of involvement, integrity and
 quest for purity and that kind of stuff. And all of those couples are still together
 and happy. They're doing great. So I wonder if maybe the pool of people that he's looking at,
 maybe the issue isn't so much courtship as maybe some other things like
 inner healing, being lacking and that kind of stuff.
 Right.
 So who knows?
 When I experts, just people who are in love and get past are all sorts of
 issues like this.
