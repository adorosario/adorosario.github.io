<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 207 of Keeping Up With The Joneses, where this week we're going to talk
 about the church.<br/>
 But before we do that, maybe how you be?
 I'd be good.<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 Our whole house smells like Christmas.
 It does.<br/>
 For the first time in my adult life, I have bought a real Christmas tree.
 We did.<br/>
 I kind of feel a little bad about doing why because it seems like a waste.
 Well, we got a really good deal on our Christmas to does that make you feel any better? Mr.
 Scottish Jones.<br/>
 No, no, no, isn't coming from a money perspective.
 It's coming from we literally paid somebody a shot down a tree.
 That's what they do for a living.<br/>
 We're providing food for their family.
 OK, yeah, I actually don't care that much because it smells so good.
 And I've been eating clementine.<br/>
 So it feels like Christmas is here.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I'm throwing the cute little MJ or six year old has been singing Feliz Navida although he doesn't know the words but he just knows those two words.
 I think that it's just absolutely beautiful baby keeps asking me to beat box for him and to wrap he's convinced that the rap thing that you made I can actually do.
 I was I wasn't going to talk about that till the end of the show.
 I'm sorry.<br/>
 Stay tuned if you want to hear more about a chase hip hop rap career.
 But we'll get so sidetracked if we talk about it right now.
 It's true.<br/>
 You were asking me how are we?<br/>
 Was are we?<br/>
 Was amazing because we went to the beach.
 We did.<br/>
 We went to the beach.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And the weather was great.<br/>
 It was, you know, whatever, 65 to 70 most days.
 It was sunny.<br/>
 You know, it wasn't like hot enough to swim unless your children.
 But yeah, didn't you take the children into the water?
 If you did, they went in the water.<br/>
 I didn't know.<br/>
 No, I'm going to the beach.<br/>
 No, our friends Gary and Sarah from Australia were with us and so we took some time off work headed down to Florida for a little
 minification and Gary doesn't like sand.
 So we walked to the beach so he could look at it.
 We took some photos and then I just went on it.
 It was great.<br/>
 It was well, neither of you really like sun either.
 So you both kept your British skin in shade while Sarah and I went in and
</p><ul>
  <li>Like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like,
 I'm like,
 Yes, he doesn't like the feel of sand and how dirty it is.
 And I'd like to mock him, but I have to talk to myself the whole time on the beach.
 Like, it's okay.
 You can get this off.
 It's okay.
 Do you really?
 Yeah.
 See, I just don't like it because sand gets in all the imaginary electronics I don't have
 with me.
 No, I just don't like the feel of sand on my skin.
 Oh, I love it.
 Oh, yeah, I don't.
 Yeah.
 just happily grounded and just thought to myself,
 I'm doing something good for my body.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>We got back just in time for Thanksgiving.
 In fact, we drove back on Wednesday,
 which was apparently the busiest day of traffic in America.
  </li><li>Which would explain how a six and a half hour drive
 became a 10 hour drive.
  </li><li>No, not the way back.
 The way back was fine.
  </li><li>No, it wasn't.
 Do you remember how Waze took us?
 And it was gonna take us around.
 So we took a detour around 65
 onto a little highway.
 And then that little highway was stopped, of course,
 'cause everybody took that detour,
 courtesy of Apple Maps.
 And then Apple Maps told us about another detour,
 so we turned down some kind of country road
 and ended up at a dead end.
 (laughs)
 And had to come back out.
 And then, ways told us to turn left,
 so we turned left and ended up in somebody's driveway,
 like a really long driveway.
 So we were just sort of laughing.
  </li><li>It's not delayed due to technology
 and not so much the crazy traffic of the day.
  </li><li>I don't think the traffic was that bad.
  </li><li>The traffic was pretty bad.
 We still took about 10 hours to get home.
  </li><li>How much of that though was Gary's insistence
 that we stop at Cracker Barrel?
  </li><li>I know, it's so strange.
 I don't understand anybody's fascination
 with Cracker Barrel have to say.
  </li><li>Each other one, baby, you love Swiss chalet,
 which is the Cracker Barrel of Canada.
  </li><li>It is not, there's nothing sharp hanging
 from the walls in Swiss chalet, and it's beautiful.
 It's a glorious thing and the French fries move on.
 You're so confused.
 We got back in time for Thanksgiving.
 Yes.
 But I had this revelation that Thanksgiving means nothing to me
 because I didn't grow up with Thanksgiving.
 So I realized that we've been in the US 10 years.
 I'm realizing we're first generation immigrants.
 But our kids are being raised here
 and there's a danger that we haven't done a good job
 of giving them a proper American cultural experience.
 So I reached out on Instagram and asked all my American followers what everyone doesn't
 Thanksgiving and there was a few recurring themes.
 Yes.
 The first one was watching the Macy's Day Parade.
 Is that what it's called?
 Yeah.
 Macy's Day Parade.
 Macy's Day Parade.
 But it was too late for that because we didn't watch it.
 We didn't watch it.
 But we don't have live TV.
 No.
 And it doesn't sound that interesting, but apparently something you do.
 Then everybody else mentioned you have family and we kind of did our best with that.
 We have some family in America, but they're not Americans either.
 I don't know what my sister and brother-in-law did for Thanksgiving, but they're probably similar to us.
 But we did have extended family with us, so we kind of scored on that.
 And then everyone talked about food.
 Yes, most of the posts were about food, weren't they?
 Yeah, turkey's a big feature.
 I don't like turkey.
 Neither do I. I don't understand the fascination.
 It's a dry, nasty meat.
 Yeah.
 Sweet potato casserole.
 Yuck.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 This is the episode where we just dance on the grave of Thanksgiving.
 I apologize to all Americans.
 I don't understand sweet potato casserole because basically it is sweet potatoes,
 which is perfectly good at vegetable.
 And then people melt marshmallows on top of it.
 Well, that's just called upgrading vegetables.
 Oh, yeah, I can't do it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Mash potatoes, pumpkin pie, all that sort of stuff.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And then everybody had this great tradition of saying what they're thankful for.
 I think that was the only one we did right.
 Yes.
 Because we missed the Macy's day parade.
 And we missed the turkey.
 Well, the food we went with was we went with roast chicken and lamb.
 We did, but we didn't realize until we were about to put the chickens on that we
 were out of propane.
 So I ran to get propane.
 He did a great job of rescuing that.
 Yeah.
 And then we did do the whole going around the table thing.
 We did.
 We need to get better that fourth of July is all about blowing stuff up and eating
 apple pie, labor days, but grilling out and Thanksgiving is turkey.
 We probably need to invite ourselves to some real Americans,
 you know, holiday meals so that we can kind of watch what they're,
 watch what they're doing.
 Cause I do feel bad that my kids, see, I grew up with like Bonfire night.
 Remember, remember the fifth of November?
 Nobody over here knows who Guy Fox is.
 No, but it was a big tradition.
 If you go by like really, really cheap, nasty fireworks and you,
 you huddle with all your friends and then you blow stuff up and
 I have a vivid memory of you and Glenn setting off fireworks in a field and screaming like little girls when they started going in the wrong direction.
 That's cultural heritage.
 And what's our cultural heritage?
 Our kids missing out on this.
 We're not good Americans.
 It's true.
 But we had chicken and lamb.
 So forget chicken and lamb.
 We had pot the crayon.
 We did.
 And they were amazing.
 There's a problem with eating when you have friends in town and you're on vacation.
 I've put on 10 pounds.
 Did you weigh yourself this morning?
 OK. Oh my gosh.
 Ten pounds.
 I mean, if you're going to do something, do it well.
 That's a shocker, isn't it?
 I told Agee this.
 I haven't told podcasts.
 Let's do this on the day back that we were driving.
 We left our rental property like 7 30 in the morning.
 Yeah.
 And our plan was to get breakfast on the road, but the
 the profit wanted to go a cracker barrel.
 And that was like two hours away.
 So I need to eat something.
 So we stop at a gas station and I look around the gas station,
 what I want for breakfast and the healthiest options. There was there was hot dogs. I was like,
 I am not eating a hot dog. I'm not eating a gas station or dog. Good decision.
 13. What a good decision. So I grabbed an almond joy, which for our British listeners is basically
 like a bounty. It's like coconut wrapped in chocolate and a pure health food and a
 tropical. I'm thinking, you know, like there's the cocoa bean, there's coconut, and there's orange
 It's kind of like a paradise breakfast.
 Oh yeah.
 Yeah.
 And so I get in the car and I'm about to, I unwrap the am and joy and I lift up to my
 mouth to eat it.
 And as I lift up to my mouth to eat it, my apple watch taps me.
 And it's basically my fitness notification that says, in effect, it's like, Hey, buddy,
 you haven't weighed in in 10 days.
 You doing okay?
 As you're about to wolf down your office.
 I forget you worried that you know Google and Facebook are listening to your phone presenting you ads my Apple watches
 You're about to make a really dumb decision. You sure you want to do that
 But anyway, I hope all our American listeners had a great Thanksgiving
 Let us know via Twitter Instagram or just sends an email about what we should know about Thanksgiving that we missed
 But we had a great time. Hope you did too and then the rest of week
 I mean my gosh, we've just been on vacation. So we haven't done anything. It's true
 state of jamas and eight food yep it was a good week.
 Mm hmm.
 Artie Kendall was a church this morning so good.
 God bless artie.
 Yeah, so funny.
 I love the way him and Jeff rib each other.
 I don't think some people know what to do with it unless they they've been here for a couple years and they know every year.
 Artie and Jeff spar back and forth all Sunday morning.
 RT who's from Kentucky, who's an American, spent more time in the UK than I did, and I'm British.
 In fact, he has a proper pucker accent. No, he doesn't. He has an English accent.
 No, he doesn't. Does he have an American accent? Yes, he is an American accent.
 It doesn't sound American at all. He doesn't have a British accent.
 And I think it's funny that he's potentially more British than I am in his life experience.
 No, according to the government, you're more British. You have the passport.
 Okay, granted. Our main topic for this week is all about the church. I woke up this morning to
 a great post on Instagram by our friend, Lyle Phillips. He posted this, I'll put a link to
 in the show notes. He said this, it was a text post on Instagram and I said, today we get to
 worship God in community. We declare war on loneliness. And some people think it's just church.
 And then in his comments he said, don't you dare stay home today and catch up on 'This is Us'.
 Shift the trajectory of your entire week by giving to God your first fruits, your first morning
 of your first day. You got this, you can get out of bed, you can get dressed and get out the door,
 I believe in you. And it was this great, you know, partially tongue-in-cheek but partially
 huge encouragement to come on guys, get to church. And so this week's episode is inspired, in part
 by that post, but also this is part of our bat to basics series where we're taking what we consider
 the 10 most foundational basic things for Christian life and talking about them and church is a basic.
 Yeah, I think this is a really important topic because I know lots of Christians who actually
 while they're Christians don't go to church, they're actually negating going to church.
 and it makes me super sad because I think by not belonging to a church,
 it's one of the fastest ways to actually delay your spiritual growth.
 Oh, absolutely. I was teaching Esso Sel a few weeks ago. I was talking about
 the gifts that Jesus gives to the church in terms of the fivefold ministry.
 Yeah, it was like two weeks ago.
 Was it okay? I've been on vacation, so everything feels like it's all right, baby.
 Sorry. I got this.
 Ephesians 4, Paul writes this about the church.
 She says, "So Christ Himself gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors,
 and teachers to equip His people for works of service, so that the body of Christ, that's
 the church, may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of
 the Son of God and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ.
 And as I was teaching the students this, I was just thinking the only way to maturity,
 The only way that the New Testament teaches that we will become mature is to be part of
 God's body.
 Right.
 But it's now trendy to not be part of God's body.
 Right.
 So you've got Christians who are trying to become mature by bypassing the way that God
 prescribes for us to be mature, which is insanity.
 The only way to reach unity and faith and unity in the knowledge of Jesus and become
 mature is to be part of a church where the fullness of Jesus' gifts are in operation.
 And as you said, babe, there's such a popular move today to be independent Christians.
 Yeah.
 Like not being a church or to do Christianity on your own terms, which by the way is an
 oxymoron.
 Yeah, because the whole thing has nothing to do with your terms.
 The whole thing is dying to self.
 Right.
 It's like we die to self, get Christ and try and resurrect parts of us that we won't
 control it.
 Yeah.
 It's not what we're called to at all.
 And in fact, the very next verses tell you the outcome if you're not part of a local church.
 Look at this verse 14 says, "Then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves
 and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming."
 So right there in verse 14, that's the outcome.
 Right. Most of the people I know who've fallen away from the Lord or perhaps not even fallen away from the Lord,
 but are on the scenic route away from Christlikeness, can be characterized by that verse.
 Yes. Right. They're tossed back and forth by the waves of life. Yeah.
 Or they're being blown here and there by every kind of teaching and are seduced into error because they're not in church.
 Like literally I'll scroll through Instagram and see people posting heresy as if it's wisdom
 And just thinking, oh, God, this is.
 And then people are like, amen.
 You know, and you're like, wait, no, no.
 What are you doing?
 Yeah.
 See, it's heartbreaking.
 It really is.
 If you're not part of a local church, I'm serious.
 There's a heart attack right now.
 If you're listening to this podcast and if you're a Christian
 and you're not part of a local church, and I don't mean that you just attend now and then.
 I mean, if you don't have a church that you call your home, that you attend every
 week where you give faithfully your time, your energy and your money, then I would make
 that the number one priority of your life this week.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 Like find a church and connect to church.
 Yeah.
 I think, babe, the thing that we have noticed is that the quality of people's lives, the
 quality of their relationships, even their energy, their faith, all of that stuff, it
 will not flourish unless you're actually part of a body.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 It's it's people trying to achieve their own godliness by bypassing God's
 prescription for God that living the very next chapter in Ephesians, Ephesians
 five.
 Look at this.
 What it says, verse 15.
 I love Ephesians.
 There's no gray area.
 I know.
 I love all of his writings.
 I'm like, okay, we know what you mean.
 So he says this.
 Be very careful then how you live.
 I mean, come on.
 That's just amazing.
 To Christians, be very careful then how you live, not as unwise, but as wise,
 making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil.
 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.
 Okay.
 He starts by saying, be careful how you live.
 Don't deceive yourself by thinking you can be built up apart from the church.
 Right.
 When God's word says the only place to reach maturity is in the church.
 Right.
 So you sound like don't be foolish.
 isn't you and your friend in a coffee store? That's not church.
 Let's talk about that in a second. Yeah. Because people are trying to redefine what church is.
 Right. You're absolutely right. Yeah. Okay. So Paul's saying don't be foolish,
 but understand what God's will is. And so my question is, what is his will when it comes to
 the church? A man says easy. Hebrews 10, 25. Okay. Right of Hebrew says, let us consider
 how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, talking about the Christian family.
 Let's consider how you and I can spur one another on toward love and good deeds,
 not giving up meeting together as summer in the habit of doing,
 but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day approaching.
 What's God's will? Not giving up meeting together.
 It's so simple.
 But again, it's popular to give up meeting together.
 It was popular back then.
 There's nothing new under the sun.
 No, that's for sure.
 Back to Ephesians 5.
 If you look at the Bible study and how it broadcasts, look at this verse 17.
 It says, "Therefore," right?
 Now that you know what God's will is, like being in a church, do not be foolish but
 understand what the Lord's will is.
 Do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery, instead be filled with the Spirit.
 Speaking to one another with Psalms, hymns and songs from the Spirit, sing and make music
 from your heart to the Lord.
 was giving thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. I think
 it's interesting that Paul contrasts getting drunk, which is a counterfeit affection to
 the longing of the human soul with being in church community. Like you say, don't just
 stay home and get wasted and kind of like placate the emptiness in your heart. Get in
 church. Right. Get filled. Right. Yeah. Instead of being drunk with wine, be filled with the
 spirit speaking to one another. That's church community, by the way, with Psalms, hymns,
 and songs. Get into some corporate worship with your church family. And I think that's
 probably why I was so struck by Lyles Instagram post this morning where he says, you know,
 going to church is declaring war and loneliness.
 And it totally is. If you think about, you know, all of us have hard weeks or weeks where
 or even maybe just hard mornings where you're like, "Oh my gosh."
 I mean, maybe we don't get as far as, "I don't know if I'm going to make it," but just having a
 hard time and coming into the presence of worship and focusing on something different and then being
 around like-minded people who can encourage you, I think it shifts it. Otherwise, you just carry
 like a bag of hurt with you throughout all your day.
 Right.
 You know, yeah.
 So let's talk about church because I say church and everyone who's listening is automatically
 thinking of something.
 Like, like my church experience can largely be categorized into three church experiences.
 The church I grew up in, which I did not enjoy, I'm very grateful for it, but I did not enjoy
 as an experience.
 The church that I found is a kind of a teenager, which is similar to my,
 that would be the second category.
 And the third category is basically Toronto and Grey Centre.
 Yes.
 Right.
 But I'm realizing there's people who had a church experience where it was like
 Lutheran or I went to Catholic Mass the other week.
 And I was like, this is so outside of my grid.
 I have to remember that when I say church, some people think this.
 Well, I grew up going to Anglican church in Minnesota.
 That the whole thing was about Jesus.
 Like I seriously didn't know.
 until I was 15, that the whole reason I had been going to church, not regularly.
 Was it a Smells and Bells church? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was high-income. So it was,
 you know, like you sort of would sing responses and you'd sit and kneel and sit and kneel and
 stand and sit and kneel and sit and kneel. And you know, there wasn't really a kids program.
 And you just sort of sat through the whole thing and lots of choir stuff. And
 Yeah, it was. I, I, I missed what the whole thing was about.
 Wow. Yeah.
 I knew we were talking about God, but that was about all I caught.
 Yeah. Right. My point is there's so many different versions of church.
 Do you know that when I say church, you know, stuff will come in our listeners minds.
 When you and I are talking about church, what are we talking about?
 We're talking about a life-giving church, like a spirit-filled life-giving community of believers
 that are gathering together on a Sunday morning and worshiping God together.
 And what would be some of the hallmarks of that church?
 There would be godly leadership.
 We would all believe the word of God.
 But wow, that's something radical.
 There'd be worship.
 Yeah, there would be the basic elements of the communion,
 the baptism.
 It would be a group of believers that tithe.
 I mean, all the sort of tenants kind of thing of things that we tend to believe.
 It's important that you note that Age and I are not going after the nominations.
 You could find a spirit-filled life-giving Bible believing God, the leadership church that believes in baptism and communion in any variation.
 So Catholic, Baptist, Pentecostal, Anglican, Episcopal, Presbyterian.
 Yeah.
 The point is you're looking for life.
 You're looking for leadership and you're looking for the word.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 You're looking for those elements.
 So I'm not talking about going to church as an empty ritual
 or religious observance.
 That's not what I'm talking about.
 I'm talking about finding a tribe
 that you can call your own.
 I remember the last time we talked about this,
 somebody wrote in and said,
 "What is the difference between a church
 "and a group of people that are not in church
 "but are just meeting to talk about Jesus?"
 And I'm like, it looks like you're trying really, really hard
 to not do church while still getting the benefits of church.
 And I get it.
 People have been hurt by the church.
 But what I don't get is if I go to a restaurant
 and get food poisoning, I don't come away
 and say restaurants suck.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I don't, I just go that restaurant sucked.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And yet people have an experience in church that is bad
 or people look on the outside at things
 that churches are doing wrong and can include church is bad.
 I'm like, no, maybe that church is bad.
  </li><li>Right. - Or maybe that
 local expression. - Maybe it's not.
 It's not fitted for you.
 Yeah. - Yeah.
 I think what makes a church a church
 is having godly leadership.
 So I meet people all the time who say,
 oh yeah, no, I don't go church, but I'm, you know,
 my friends and I, we just get together
 and we have pancakes and we talk about Jesus.
 And I'm like, but that's not a church.
 That's fellowship. - Yeah.
  </li><li>But it's not church. - And I'm glad
 you're having fellowship, but also go to church.
 Right.
 Have some level of involvement in a recognized church because that is God's
 design for growth.
 Yeah.
 And he didn't make a plan B that involves pancakes.
 Yeah.
 We've got nothing against denominations or pancakes.
 No, not against either.
 Um, but you get my point, you know, it's not.
 I think it's so funny because it's, it's human nature in so many different
 areas to look for plan B because plan A seems like it might require something of us.
 Yeah.
 And it does require something of you to be part of a church means to get involved
 and, you know, and serve and be part of a community.
 Yes, it requires something of you, but it is also going to be absolutely life
 giving for you.
 And there's a huge benefit.
 Let me ask you a question.
 Yeah.
 What does a listener do if they don't love the church they're in?
 Find a new one.
 There's another answer.
 I suppose it depends on why they don't love the church there.
 And like, I mean, I think it's appropriate to find a different church.
 If perhaps the reasons that you don't love the church you're in are things like your,
 your heart's been awakened to the presence of the Holy Spirit and, and your church doesn't have a grid for that.
 or things like that, then I think it's appropriate to go, "Lord, thank you for this season and this church.
 Would you show me where to go to grow more in the next season?" What you want to be careful,
 though, is that you don't become a church hopper out of that, and all of a sudden, it's
 your month here, your two months here, your whatever, because no church. There isn't a perfect church.
 No, there isn't.
 There just isn't.
 Yeah, and I just want to say that. If you live in a different country or you don't
 live in Nashville and you listen to us and we talk about grace and error. Somehow you've
 romanticized that grace and error is a perfect church. Grace and error is absolutely not a
 perfect church. No, there's still lots of stuff we're working on. Absolutely. My encouragement is if
 you don't love the church that you're in and you can't find another church that you can love,
 my encouragement is serve the church that you're in. Right? Love the church that you're in,
 But supplement your life in the meantime.
 Right.
 So I spent many years of my adult life in a church that filled with people I loved,
 but with a church experience, I didn't.
 That makes sense.
 Yes.
 And so I'm with people who absolutely love the Lord and absolutely love me.
 But what I've tasted outside of my church can't be found inside of my church.
 And then asking the Lord, Lord, could I change churches?
 I felt that the Lord said no, actually just serve this church.
 And here's what I learned is you have a voice when you have equity.
 You only get equity by being part of the church.
 Yeah.
 There's a danger that people go to church to spectate.
 When you are a spectator, you become a referee.
 Don't don't become a referee.
 Or a critic.
 Yeah, become a participant.
 Yeah.
 I would encourage you, no matter where you're like, if you're not in a church,
 please, please get in the church.
 If you are in a church, but it's not fulfilling you, ask the Lord,
 like what's the plan for the season? Like if it's not your bread and butter, ask the Lord,
 is it another church I want to be a part of? If he says where you stay where you are, blossom
 where you're planted, serve the church, pray the Lord and ask him to bless your church,
 ask him to bless your leaders, partner with heaven, do your part which is faithfulness,
 God will do his, God will add growth to your life through obedience, not in your preference of soil.
 Often we think, oh God, you can't grow me up in these things because this church isn't X.
 Or like my church is super secret sensitive and I want to be Holy Spirit, or my church is super
 Holy Spirit, and so I'm not getting fed the word. This is the beauty. If you can be part of the
 church, God is so able to equip you with other things. Yeah, you can supplement you in other
 ways. Oh, absolutely. Books, podcasts, conferences, whatever. You mentioned church hoppers. Yeah.
 church hoppers i want to say this is kindness as i possibly can if you're a church hopper
 and by that i mean you go to this church because you like the worship and then that
 church because you like to teaching and well the next church because you want to hang with your
 friends you need to stop it because because church was never supposed to be consumer oriented
 all right you're making a huge mistake because you will never grow my suggestion is pick a church
 invest in that church because you will not grow if you don't put down roots.
 I totally agree.
 Why did you end up switching from the high Anglican church to Toronto?
 I got saved. I mean, I went away with my cousin on that Baptist retreat and found out the whole
 church thing was about Jesus, which was revolutionary for me. And so I started going to the Baptist
 church, which I went to for about four years, before I ended up going to the church in Toronto.
 So in summary, if you're not in a church, please get in the church. If you are in a church, and
 it's one that you feel like you're quote unquote not being fed, the church's job is not to feed
 you. The church is there so that you can be part of something that's going to bring everybody to
 maturity. So, you know, feed yourself. I want to be kind in saying that. Be part of a local church,
 give, tithe, serve, build the kingdom together, pray for the church that you're in, pray for
 the church leaders that you have. And if you're in the middle of nowhere and you have no church,
 ask the Lord to bring one to you. He's so good at being creative in allowing you to fulfill his
 word. And he's so good at that. And if you have other questions about the church, write us. We'd
 love to hear from you. Go to <a href="mailto:ellen@ag.com">ellen@ag.com</a>/ask, fill in your question, and we'll try and answer
 on air. Anything else you want to say about the church?
 I don't think so. I think that's good. I mean, I just, I think, especially when
 you're hurting the temptation to not be in church is, it's really high. And I think
 that there's a lie in our heads that we're like, I just, I, whatever, I can't do
 people right now. This isn't, this isn't a good time for me, all that kind of stuff.
 But actually for me, church has been my place of healing.
 So I'm super thankful for church.
 And, you know, obviously you need to be in a, in a church that is, you know,
 safe place for you to grow into heal.
 Right.
 Um, so those would be the main things for me more than what's the worship
 like or whatever.
 Is it a safe place for you to grow and heal if it is put down roots and see what
 God will do?
 Mm.
 I love it.
 Maybe have a listeners question.
 Okay.
 Completely unrelated to the church, but equally appropriate for the season of life.
 I'm sure for many of our listeners, this is a question that the person wrote and
 asked to be anonymous.
 And they said, what do you do when you're saying yes to all the things you feel
 God is leading you to do, but doing all the things you feel led to do is starting
 to feel like too much and overwhelming.
 I don't want to discontinue any of my activities I'm doing because I feel strongly
 that there are things God asked me to say yes to.
 I think we've all probably experienced a season in life like this.
 What's your top tips for anonymous?
 Those are good questions, anonymous.
 I don't know if I've always walked to that line that wisely because I
 tend to be the person that's like, I said, yes, and so I shall do it all.
 And then I end up getting sick or something, you know, like sort of run down.
 So I think if you really feel strongly that the Lord has asked you to do all
 of the different things that you're participating in, then I would be asking him, Lord, how do
 I schedule this? How do I do this? How do I prioritize this? And if if you're asking me to do these
 couple of things, what do I say no to in order to be able to say yes to this and not get burnt
 out or not get exhausted? But I had the conversation with the Lord about, okay, this is what I feel
 like you said, yes, too. How do I do this?
 Right. I think it's also worth checking with the Lord that your revelation is current.
 Yeah.
 Often we're carrying things into a new season that were meant for an old.
 So asking a Lord, Lord, can we just sit down and could we just re-prioritize what's important
 to you in this season for me? Like, what am I saying yes to? And I also understand that your
 yes is accompanied by grace. And so if the grace is lifted or the grace is worn out,
 it could be that you're seeing yes to to old things. Yeah. And that allows the Lord an opportunity
 or conversely, it could mean that your yes to the new things is pushing out things that you're
 holding on to that are not not current. So for example, if you're like, I don't have any time
 to be watching modern family anymore, you know, and be able to do all these things that I said yes to,
 it might not be the things you said yes to that's gone to, it might be the Netflix binging. But
 As always, asking a Holy Spirit is just a great opportunity to gain wisdom and insight into your life.
 Yep. It feels like this episode totally flew by.
 It absolutely has. We cover everything.
 Did I tell everybody that you bought me a llama mug after murdering my llama balloon?
 Yeah, let's redeem my name. After I stabbed the llama balloon, we got your llama mug.
 Yes.
 Lama mug is much less intimidating first thing in the morning than the balloon that hovers
 over me, like some mystic creature from the depths.
 It will survive longer, I hope.
 Yeah.
 This episode was brought to you by the wonderful support of our incredible patrons.
 These are good looking listeners just like you, whose lives have been impacted by the
 podcast and they want to say thank you with a small financial gift each month.
 from as little as a dollar an episode, you too can become a patron and get that amazing
 feel good feeling every time an episode comes out that tells you, Hey, I'll make this happen.
 To become a patron, visit allen and aj.com/support and help us spread keeping up with the Joneses
 all around the world. Actually, on Monday, it was thank you patrons day and aj at the
 start of the broadcast you were talking about your hip hop beats. We made a little thing
 for patrons. Explain the behind the scenes of what happened there.
 Okay. So every time we sit down to do a podcast and we've done 207 of them now, which is shocking.
 I like to lay down a little hip hop beat to test my microphone.
 So literally I turn on all the equipment and just to make sure that I'm picking up something
 something from AJ, I just say, "Hey, baby, you say something," and she insists every week
 on throwing out a variation of four or five bars in inverted copies.
 Okay, it's dreadful, but it's fun and it's my way of warming up for that podcast.
 So I'm pronounced to AJ at the start of this year.
 I started recording those thinking, "Maybe make them into something like a little Christmas
 Thank you to our listeners or something like that.
 But I've just been collecting these,
 which were basically a variation of a theme
 because once I collected them all,
 I just realized there's like five essential beats
 that you just do over and over again.
  </li><li>I do the same ones, yeah.
  </li><li>Including some amazing, I say amazing
 in Verticomma's beatbox.
  </li><li>Baby, love me, love my beatbox.
  </li><li>So with it being, thank you, patron day on Monday
 and being out of the beach and feeling super relaxed.
 And because I had my laptop, I imported all of AJ's noises into logic and started playing
 around with them and we made a little song, which by the way, I'm furious because we
 uploaded them to Twitter and Instagram and Facebook.
 But Twitter and Facebook have just got the worst hosting solution ever.
 So all the audio bit rate was really, really crummy and it sounded terrible.
 So if you want to hear DJ AJ at her finest.
 and you do after the closing song I'll put her how do you describe it
 I'm a pure magic sonic bliss we'll leave that at the end for you just amazing
 all right well thank you for being with us this week until next week have an
 incredible week goodbye
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
