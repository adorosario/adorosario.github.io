<p> Hello everyone.<br/>
 Oh, that.<br/>
 Did you read the book?<br/>
 No, thank you.<br/>
 Because I don't like it.<br/>
 We've been doing this annoying thing this week because I've been in Canada this week.
 I've got a new phone love for the French language.
 I don't know if you speak a lot of French.
 I've just got a few key phrases that I repeat and...
 Over.<br/>
 I don't forget but I think it's awesome and AJ not so much.
 Not so much.<br/>
 Babe, how are you?<br/>
 I am well.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Can I just say you're looking resplendent today?
 Oh, thank you, darling.<br/>
 You and your pink shirt.<br/>
 Hot pink.<br/>
 And your hair pulled back.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Can we talk about spectacles?<br/>
 Spectacles.<br/>
 Glasses.<br/>
 Yes, that's how we call them here.<br/>
 What are you calling them in America?<br/>
 Glasses.<br/>
 What do you know?<br/>
 You're a Canadian.<br/>
 Oh, shit.<br/>
 This is what I learned. Growing up in the UK, you would go to an optician to get your eyes tested.
 In America, an optician is somebody that sells you glasses, and the person who tests your eyes
 is an optometrist. So that was interesting. I think I may have fended the optometrist that I saw
 by referring to him as an optician until he decided to clarify it. Tell a story about us
 going to see the weird up to motorist in December.
</p><ul>
  <li>Optometrist.
  </li><li>That's one.
  </li><li>Oh, in December.
 Yeah, we went, and we should have known better
 'cause they had a $1 eye exam
 that probably should have been our clue.
  </li><li>My general rule of thumb is if anything
 costs less than dog food, it's not worth doing.
  </li><li>But we're like, oh, bargain, let's get our eyes tested.
 So the guy tested me, told me I need a glasses.
 And what was really weird for me was the eye
 he said, "I needed glasses on."
 I was like, "But I can see everything really sharply.
 If there's one eye that is less sharp, it's probably the other eye."
 I mean, I can still see and he was like, "Nope, I need prescription."
 But then everybody, he can never read prescriptions.
 Everybody that we took to see him, he basically gave the same thing.
 And we were like, "This kind of feels like you're trying to make your quotas before
 the end of the year." So we ignored him.
 Yes.
 and accept our kids teachers said you probably get your kids checked.
  </li><li>For Tia's teacher, she had a screening at preschool and the preschool person said,
 "You need to take her in to get her eyes checked."
  </li><li>So we dutifully did and met a wonderful optometrist.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But it turns out the whole family's getting glasses.
  </li><li>Well, except for me.
  </li><li>No, you're still getting them. You just don't need them.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm going to get just glasses with glass in them.
 because you look so stinking hot wearing these glasses.
 I was trying on glasses and now I'm like, "Hoba, hoba."
 Yes, I was. We went to warbyporker.com and I ordered five pairs of glasses to...
 The deal is if you've never looked at Warbyporker, you go to the website,
 you browse through all their spectacles, glasses, and you order five pairs,
 they send them to you for free.
 You get to try them on and work out which ones you like,
 and wear them around for five days, and you send them back.
 And then you order a pair.
 So it you know we quickly went through the five i had to get like any of them.
 But she started wearing some of them and i really like the one she was wearing.
 So she never thinks i have a thing for librarians.
 I have some concerns but i thought was we are at the is glasses are coming in this week so abby is near sighted and so she has to wear.
 Glasses issues looking at like a chalkboard and she says to keep saying she was all the time she wants to wear the ball time bright pink of course of course.
 But we're like, "No, baby, we don't want you to ruin your eyes."
 So it's great that you can see up close.
 Let's not wear your glasses when it's up close.
 But Tia has a stigmatism in both eyes, which is interesting that the guy who was trying
 to sell his glasses in December didn't mention that at all.
 But anyway, so she's going to have to wear glasses all the time, which she's not thrilled
 about her.
 And when we asked her why she was crying because she came and she sat on my lap and she just
 I was like, honey, what's wrong?
 And she said, mommy, it's going to ruin my look.
 So I wear contact lenses.
 So I'm going to go back to wearing glasses so that she doesn't feel self
 conscious and that basically everybody in our family is wearing glasses.
 And I'm going to get fake glasses.
 And then we've recruited everyone we know on church next week to wear their
 glasses if their contact lenses were so that we can point to all the people
 that Tia loves and just said, look, Tia, Jen is wearing her glasses and Michelle
 wearing her glasses and we'll get you to wear glasses.
  </li><li>Lina, and yes, so we're asking everybody who we know to wear their glasses.
 This coming Sunday.
  </li><li>Next week is Specky Sunday.
  </li><li>Specky Sunday, because Tia will be wearing hers and then she'll be able to realize how
 many people have them.
  </li><li>Speaking of church this morning, we're uncharacteristically recording this podcast on a Sunday.
 Church this morning was amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was off the hook. It was great.
  </li><li>Off the hook, I'm sorry. Are you a surfer babe from California?
 off the hook shaka.
 You're experiencing a life mental breakdown on air.
 No, Chris and clarnie, one of our favorite people was leading worship this morning.
 Grace and I did a phenomenal job.
 President of God was lovely and we just prayed for lots of people for the father's blessing
 and for healings and some people got healed.
 So that was awesome.
 Talk to me about this week, baby.
 The past week.
 This past week?
 Well, you left me.
 Can we say that differently?
 Right.
 You went to Toronto.
 Yes, I did.
 Minister at the Leader School of Ministry there.
 Correct?
 That's correct.
 And I also do one of my favourite things, which is being an airport.
 I just miss airports so much.
 And so, yeah, I flew up to Toronto and they very kindly asked me to come in and speak.
 And of course, we'd do anything like our dear friends in Toronto.
 When I spoke in the school and had an amazing time because I got to see everybody
 That we haven't seen in quite some time so I did the annoying thing where I took a selfie with everybody
 I met I got to see our dear friend Valdar and then he would send them to me like some sort of torture as I'm home with
 Three children that are all wanting their father. Yeah, he's sending me selfies of him with all of my friends
 Copies once in time with Ben and Sarah and Gordon Kathy our dear friends up there
 Then on the way back, Steve Long, who's seen your past for a turn, was kind enough to
 give me an airport lounge pass, which meant I could pretend I wasn't one of the unwashed
 masses and actually visit the Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge, which used to be our second
 home really.
 We should have paid rent.
 We were in there so much.
 I guess we did buy all the airfare for a long time.
 No cleaning.
 It was nice to be there.
 And then I tell you what, flying into the country, so if you're an American, listen to
 this you've never experienced US immigration because you're a US citizen.
 So it's not an issue when you're not an American citizen.
 It's it's all this intense experience.
 But now that we're green card holders, it's awesome.
 And wait till I'm an American citizen.
 Whoop, whoop.
 I'm so excited about it.
 Patricia King just got her citizenship this week.
 Yeah, Patricia, I have five.
 Very cool.
 Um, how do you feel after vacation?
 We were on vacation last week.
 Well, no, no, last week we came back to work.
 But I guess we started back Tuesday.
 How do you feel?
 I feel good.
 We started back Tuesday.
 Of course, Tuesday was our alumni canoe trip.
 So it was hard at work, suffering from Jesus and canoe, but it was great fun.
 And that was perfect.
 But I was just really excited on Tuesday just thinking, "Yeah, come on.
 Let's do it."
 I don't know.
 I feel excited about what God's going to do this year.
 Oh, I'm really excited.
 You sound really excited.
 I don't know. I'm trying to restrain my voice so that I don't go all high.
 Baby sleeping. There is a baby sleeping. We have some readers questions this week.
 First readers question is from Loretta Call and she says, I want to learn more about ministering
 to people with fractured personalities due to trauma. I was wondering if you did that or if you
 could recommend training that was good. We don't do that. We don't set an area that we focus on.
 But if you're looking for a good book on it, our dear friend Candace Roberts, who doesn't
 live too far away, she lives in Campbell'sville, Kentucky wrote a brilliant book called Help
 for the Fractured Soul. I'll put a link to the book in the show notes, you can get that on Amazon,
 any bookstore. I got it from my iPad off of iBooks. So hopefully that will help you. We got an
 email from Germany. This is Kristin, she says, "I had the privilege of attending Grey Centers in
 encounter we can't last April. And on that we can encourage us to have an
 accountability partner and living in Germany and being a part of a very
 transient church in a military community. It is very difficult to invest in
 relationship that you know will only last for two to three years. The question is
 can one maintain a healthy and life-giving relationship through Skype, emails, phone
 calls, etc. Ej, what do you think? Yeah, I think you can. I think, you know,
 obviously if you can find somebody that's local that you can get together face to face and chat
 in terms of accountability and stuff like that, it would be ideal. But you also need to be able
 to look around and figure out if there's safe people there to do that with too. So I would
 probably just recommend praying and saying, "Okay Lord, how am I doing this accountability piece
 during this season?" - That would also say don't disqualify starting a relationship because you
 you think it's only going to last two to three years. I would rather have a great quote unquote
 lifelong friend for two years than go through two years feeling isolated. Plus, you never
 know what God's going to do and who you're going to knit you together with. So I know
 you're asking about Skype. Yes, I think that's technically possible, but I wouldn't be frightened
 of making relationships that are of the caliber you're looking for, even if you think they're
 only going to be around for two years. I still think that's two years of rich blessing.
 Good. Oh, good. I wasn't sure if you're feeling
 pensive. We're going to add something to it. I was feeling pensive, but I wasn't going to add
 anything to it. Right. Last week, we cut off our story with a cliffhanger. I people email
 and we go, "What happened in J. Crew if you didn't listen to last week's broadcast?"
 Did you really? Did people email do? Yeah.
 What happened in J. Crew? Should we make them wait another week?
 No, we will not.
 So last week we were talking about our move from Canada to America.
 Well, we started talking about our love for America and then we started talking about how we got here.
 And to recap, if you weren't listening, basically we were traveling for a living.
 We loved living in Toronto.
 We had a baby.
 We didn't think it was feasible to keep traveling around the world with a baby, let alone two or three babies because we want more kids.
 So we started looking at our prophetic words.
 We shared our prophetic words with our leaders.
 I had a dream in Iceland, the dream said in the dream.
 I was told to meet Jeff Dollar.
 So we came and met Jeff Dollar in Nashville.
 And the first time that we visited Jeff,
 we came to Grace Center,
 really fell in love with Grace Center.
 And as we're driving back to the airport to leave,
 we stopped him at J. Crew,
 A.J. Pickis up from there.
  </li><li>So we stopped at J. Crew and I'm talking to the cashier
 and she says something like,
 "Hey, do you live here?
 you visiting Nashville and I said, oh, just visiting. And she said, Oh, did you have,
 do you like Nashville? Did you have a nice trip? And I was like, I love Nashville.
 And I totally started crying. I was like, Oh, which such emotional outbursts are not normal
 for you. Not at all. I was like, what just happened?
 That's interesting. So we came home from that trip, which we'd been asking God is her
 favor in Nashville for us. And we stayed in three hotels all three times. We got upgraded
 to the presidential suite. And we fell in love with the church. We really loved the team there.
 We loved Jeff and Becky. We loved the spirit of generosity that was on there and really loved the
 city. It was just beautiful. And then what happened? Then we got on with life. Then we, yeah, I mean,
 we had a full travel schedule. So we just kept traveling. I couldn't get the idea of Nashville
 out of my mind though, about being here. But meanwhile, the whole time I'm lacking in details.
 So I don't quite know what it means.
 Yeah.
 Should we talk about the angel?
 Yeah, I'm trying to think what order stuff yet.
 I think the angel happened next.
 So we got home from a trip and we are just we're at home.
 Age and I are sitting watching CSI.
 It was CSI Miami, wasn't it?
 Not that it matters, but here we are.
 We're watching TV.
 I think we're watching one of the CSI's.
 And as I'm looking at the TV out of the corner of my eye, I see an angel now
 before, here's a danger. When I say I see an angel, you're like, Oh, I would love to see an angel.
 It's likely that you've probably seen an angel and you just don't really realize that you have.
 So when I say see an angel, I saw something at my corner of my eye that wasn't physically there,
 but in my experience of learning to walk in the supernatural and see in the spirit,
 the more I gave my attention to it, the more it became apparent there was an angel there. And so
 I'm feeling a little self-conscious because, you know, we're exhausted, we're jet-lagged,
 then I said to AJ, do you see the angel over there? And she's like, nope. And I was like,
 well, can we push pause on CSI? Well, I just go over and investigate this more. So long story short
 went over. This angel was here, showed us some stuff, had a message for me that all felt a little
 bit too super spiritual, felt a little bit too weird for me. And so in a moment of incredible faith,
 I just said, God, I'm not sure if I'm making this up, or whether this is really you. So if
 it's you, can you get Gary Morgan to confirm it? So Gary, for those of you who don't know,
 Gary's one of our best friends. He lives in Melbourne, Australia with his wonderful wife Sarah.
 He's originally from Wales and they lead a church out there. But he's a very gifted profit and a
 dear friend of ours who's been instrumental. Both of them have been instrumental in major parts of
 our life. So I said, Lord, would you speak to Gary and have him confirm it now? Just because you
 weren't there. The angel showed up really just between our bedroom and our bathroom.
 in that kind of area in our living room. It was a messenger angel came with a message,
 a particularly clear message. And so I went to bed, didn't think anything about him about
 the next morning I wake up eagerly waiting to see if Gary will phone me or contact me
 or, and he does, he scipes with me and he said, "Brother," as he always says, in this
 wonderful Welsh accent, he said, "I had dream last night. He didn't dream," he said, "an
 angel showed up in your house and it was between your bedroom door and your bathroom
 door and it was a brown angel which tells me it was a messenger angel. So what did he
 say? And I was like, God, that's so amazing. So I told him what the angel said, which was
 basically, hey, there's a window of opportunity for you and you need to take. He said, yeah,
 it's a window of opportunity taken opening for you and you'd be wise to take it. I still
 didn't know to this day. I know it sounds stupid looking back on this book. I don't
 really know what the window was because it wasn't or what the opportunity was
 at Beggar Park. But that was a real encouraging way to dream. You, we had a
 personal connect with Jeff. We, you know, really felt the Holy Spirit when we were
 in Nashville and I had an angel show up and bring some confirmation. Then what
 happened? Then the the Lakeland Revival started happening. We've had before
 after the also. That was before. You sure? Yeah, I'm positive. So we went, we went, we
 We found like a couple days that we could go down during the week and we went down to
 be there.
 And the firstWho'
 s we just mean you?
 You and I, but we were meeting with John and Carol.
 They were coming the next day.
 And so we were there the first day with just you me and Abby.
 And we went to the meeting.
 My cousin came and watched my kid, watched Abby.
 AndIt 
 was a huge stadium, wasn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, it sat like 8,000 people, I think,
 or something, it was huge.
  </li><li>And we got there late.
  </li><li>We got there late.
 So we were like heading up to the nose bleeds,
 you know, up to the, which was really cool, actually,
 but we head up to the top and we find these two seats together
 and sit down and then, you know, worship is going on.
 So we like stand up to join into worship
 in like five minutes later.
 Somebody taps us on the shoulder
 and we turn around and it's Jeff Dollar.
  </li><li>Which was bizarre, Jeff and all the leadership team
 of Grey Center.
 And they were, you know, seated in the row right behind us.
 So yeah, it wasOf 
 all the gin joints.
 (laughs)
 How'd that go?
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 and then while we were in Tulsa, John says to us,
 "Hey, I saw Jeff and I let him know
 that you guys are thinking of moving to Nashville."
 And we're like, "What? You told him what?
 What?"
 You know, because--
  </li><li>Those of you who don't understand
 why that would throw us in at tears,
 John is just such an amazing connector
 and influencer of people.
 He really is.
 He's got a real gift of actually connecting people.
 but we didn't actually know what John had said to Jeff
 because we weren't thinking of moving to Nashville.
 I mean, we--
  </li><li>Well, I was.
  </li><li>Well, you were thinking of it,
 but it's not like we had a plan or a--
  </li><li>We didn't have anything.
  </li><li>We had nothing.
  </li><li>We're also not sure if John had spoken to Jeff
 on our behalf and we just didn't know what he said
 and wanted to clarify with Jeff.
  </li><li>We were thinking like, oh gosh,
 Jeff is gonna think we're gonna open a competing church.
 You know, we just didn't know.
  </li><li>Or that we're fishing for a job or--
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So we were like, oh, well, we knew we were going to Nashville
 the following week.
 So we were like, okay, we're going to have to clean that up
 for the following week.
  </li><li>For the following week.
  </li><li>When we get there, yeah.
  </li><li>So the following week we head to Nashville.
 We're teaching a week long school with John and Carol
 at Gray Center.
 And we're desperate to try and connect with Jeff.
 But every time we try and each day that we're like,
 hey, free for lunch, all right, I have lunch.
 What about dinner?
 Oh, I already have dinner.
 So we thought, no, that was no problem.
 We'll connect at some point during the week.
 But for five nights, everywhere that we went for dinner,
 and those of you who live in Nashville,
 know the Cool Springs area,
 it's just got so many restaurants.
  </li><li>This happened in five different restaurants.
 It wasn't like the same restaurant.
  </li><li>Agent and I would go out for dinner with some friends
 and we'd either walk into a restaurant
 that Jeff and Becky were already at.
  </li><li>No, we always got there first.
  </li><li>Oh, did we?
  </li><li>Yeah, we were always there first
 and there was five times in a row
 where within 10 to 15 minutes,
 Jeff would show up with whoever he was
 doing dinner with.
 And yeah, it happened five times in five days.
  </li><li>Without any knowledge of who was going where.
 So we just thought, oh, this is funny,
 our paths keep crossing.
 So in the end, we get to sit down with Jeff
 and we just had Jeff have no idea what John has said
 or how he said it, but here's the deal.
 We told him the story, we told him the dream.
 We told him about us coming here about loving Nashville.
 And but we basically said, look, we don't know
 what we're doing or when we come,
 but we just really feel like God might be on Nashville.
 And we just really love you, we love your church.
 And Jeff was like, well, if you guys end up moving here,
 we'd love to connect with you.
 And you'd be welcome at Grace Center.
 And that was it.
 It was just a super cordial, amazing time.
 It was great to spend another week in Nashville.
 And then we flew home.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Gave it really no other thought.
 Flew off to Edinburgh.
  </li><li>You gave it another thought.
  </li><li>That's my skill, my ability to compartmentalize.
 So we flew off, we went and did another trip somewhere.
 And I remember we were in Edinburgh.
 I remember this because we were in the Edinburgh Sheraton
 Grand, and you and I were sitting there
 and we were talking about what do we want to do next?
 If we could plan anything.
 No, that's not right.
 No, we were in the Sheraton Grand.
 This is why I need my wife here.
 We stayed with your parents that trip.
 We went to some sort of strange little fast foodish pizza
 joint next to a movie theater in Dundee.
 I have no recollection of this at all.
 for a date and we brainstormed, we asked ourselves a question, if we could do anything, what
 would we want to do?
 I wasn't an Edinburgh?
 It would, no, it wasn't an Edinburgh.
 We mind-bapped.
 I remember it was on the desk.
 Because then we went, then we came back to your parents' place and we're sitting on
 the porch.
 An email diving in Isabel.
 An email diving in Isabel.
 No, I see.
 All right, well, you tell the story because you've obviously got a stronger memory than
 either, but keep going. So anyway, we'd sat down and thought, what do we want to do?
 Yes. With our life. And we thought, well, you know what, if we are going to pass
 through young adults, because we were like that age group, feel like we can connect and
 it's not too far away from where we are. And we'd love our lives to be something about mentoring.
 Yeah, we really love mentoring people. We really appreciate being mentored.
 So we'd like to kind of mentor people. And then we said, we'd love to have a school
 administrator. Yeah, we'd love to do school ministry. We'd love to school in Toronto,
 totally changed our lives. And so yeah, we'd love to run a school of industry. And that was it.
 And then the next day was it that Jeff called morning, we wake up and Jeff has emailed.
 And that's right. He said, hey, what would it look like? I mean, if you were to come here,
 if you were to come to Nashville, what is it you guys would even be interested in doing?
 We were like, honey, you should ask. So we just sent them an email because we'd already drafted
 a app. What we didn't know was that in their meeting, they were identifying areas that they
 they wanted help, which was with young adults,
 with a mentoring program or an internship
 and a school of ministry.
  </li><li>Based off some words that they had over the church
 that we had no idea about.
  </li><li>So we emailed our dear friends, Ivan Isabel.
 We should do a whole podcast just on Ivan Isabel.
 We totally should.
 But we should try and get Ivan Isabel.
  </li><li>On our podcast.
  </li><li>On our podcast, we can talk about that the whole thing
 later, but we email Ivan Isabel, send them a huge big letter.
 Ivan Isabel, our dear friend of ours,
 two very, very wonderful, wonderful people
 who've been hugely instrumental in our lives
 in the lives of thousands of people.
 They're very gifted prophets, but more than that,
 they're friends of Jesus and they just,
 they're just amazing, amazing people.
 Anyway, we email them and with my friends who are prophets,
 I try not use them as a magic cable.
 As in, there's--
  </li><li>Well, they're so hard to pick up and shake
 in the first place.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>But you know what I mean by that,
 you just don't wanna use the person you have for their gift.
 But so I just emailed them.
 They're people that we love and they're important in our life.
 I said, hey, this is a journey we've been on.
 This is what we think the Holy Spirit's saying.
 You know, if you get anything fantastic,
 but we're just writing to you because we love you
 and want you included in our life,
 not necessarily asking you to prophesy about us.
 And they travel like crazy.
 So I wasn't expecting to get a message back from them
 for maybe a week, maybe two weeks.
 No sooner did I sent this letter,
 that was enormously long and detailed.
 I get a one line email back from them in caps
 that just says, "This is the Lord, do it. This is your destiny." So I cheekily write back
 and I quip. You guys either sped read my email or, and I'm joking here, or you guys already
 knew what was in it. And they instantly reply back and said, "We've been waiting on that
 email for two weeks now."
 "A whole new world."
 "Don't you dare close your eyes."
 I'm telling, unbelievable. And so just kind of snowballed from there that like we seem
 to have a heart for something like Grace and I had a heart for something and our hearts
 really connected and we kind of flew down and met their senior team and talked and before
 you know it, we've got a job offer from Grace and so the next big hurdle is our visas,
 which can take a long time. And how long did it take us to get our visas? I forget.
 a day. Oh, that's right. One day. So we, we went to see an immigration lawyer actually
 while we were here in Nashville and they were looking up and they were like, Oh yeah, you're
 R1 visas. Yeah, it could take anywhere between three to five months. No, it was longer than
 that. It was like, at that time, it was like three to nine or something. Yeah, it was like
 five to nine months, but you could expedite it for $1,000 per application and shorten
 it to three months. And then he looked at, he just looked at something, he was like,
 Wait a minute, you know, it's in Canada.
 It's like, here's the deal.
 If you just go to the US consulate
 and present your paperwork,
 they'll probably issue it for, it's like $33.
 So that's what we did.
 We went down to the consulate and--
  </li><li>It wasn't 33, it was like 125 each or something like that.
 But it was significantly lower than thousands of dollars.
  </li><li>Ladies and gentlemen, this is why God gave me a wife
 to just keep me with all the details, keep me correct.
 Nevertheless, it was vastly cheaper
 and we got our visas in a day.
 And so we talked about what we do at Grace Center
 in Gatorvisa's in October.
 And by December, we packed up all our stuff and drove down
 and moved to Franklin, Tennessee and began the next chapter
 and the next adventure of our life.
 And we have never regretted it, have we, baby?
  </li><li>We have not, it's amazing.
 I love it that we're here.
  </li><li>I love it that you're here.
 And if you're a friend of ours in Franklin, Tennessee,
 thank you so much for loving us.
 We just so love that we live in Franklin.
 love that we get to be part of your life and so love that we get to be a Grace Center and
 I'm so glad for Jeff and Becky and I'm so glad for Grace Center. It's just absolutely amazing.
 Speaking of which, we have a couple of events coming up at Grace Center, one of which I want
 to talk about this week. We have two dear friends of ours coming to Minister next. We can't. What
 is that day of love because podcasts are this coming weekend? Yes, I know, but somebody might not
 I'll be listening to it. It is the 25th and 26th of July. We have our good friend Mark DuPont
 coming. Mark, tell us more DuPont stories.
 Mark is just amazing. He's a recognized prophet and he is somebody I've known for, I guess,
 20 years now. He speaks with an enormous amount of authority and obviously has the relationship
 with God to back it up. Let's say that. Got a huge amount of integrity and has a real
 heart for maintaining integrity in the prophetic and walking that stuff out with other leaders
 and stuff. He's amazing. He's been somebody in my life that's been really pivotal and
 brought keywords at key moments that shifted things in a huge way for me.
 He's a great, great guy.
 Then come into lead worship from Toronto as our dear friend.
 Laura Woodley, Osmond.
 Laura Woodley, Osmond.
 Yes, possibly one of my favorite worship leaders.
 Possibly.
 Why? Possibly.
 If only she'd sing more rock anthems, that would be sure.
 The rock anthems.
 No, she's amazing.
 She's definitely one of my favorite worship leaders.
 I love the stuff that she writes because it's so helps you connect quickly with the father.
 She's amazing.
 She also sang us down the aisle at our wedding.
 She did.
 She did two of the three songs at our wedding, and she were the ones that she wrote.
 I just, yeah, I'm so excited.
 So if you happen to be in Nashville, Franklin area, the weekend of the 25th and 26th, coming
 a great center completely free event. We'd love you to come. It'd be awesome for you
 to experience Mark and Laura's ministry. It's Friday night, Saturday night, and they'll
 be ministering Sunday morning and Monday night. Oh, they're ministering at Ammonate?
 Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. Yep. I probably should know that, but then I've been on vacation
 for four weeks. Probably should. Well, and you were away when I confirmed all these things.
 Well, you know, while you were away in Toronto, I just make decisions.
 It's amazing. Just making decisions, ladies. Well, thank you very much for listening to
 with ramble for another half an hour again. If you have any questions you would like to
 send us, please visit allan and AJ.com/ask or look us up on Twitter. I'm @allan and you're
 at underscore Allison Jean.
 What? On what? Twitter?
 Yeah.
 No, I'm underscore AJ Jones.
 I'm going to resign from talking because clearly I have a clue what I'm talking about.
 I mostly take pictures of food and my children though, so be warned.
 I think that's all people do on Instagram.
 Well, for people who don't have kids, they take photos of the things that are dearest
 to them.
 Usually selfies, right?
 You're suggesting that, never mind.
 I'm not going there.
 I'm just kidding.
 All right.
 Moving on.
 Moving on.
 We love you guys.
 We'll see you next week.
 Bye.
