<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode 280 of Keeping Up with the Joneses.
 I'm joined by my radiant but slightly tired wife, AJ Jones.
 Ola.<br/>
 Say hello to the people, baby.<br/>
 I said Ola. That is hello. It's hello in Spanish. Ola.
 Okay, we're reaching our international audience, which I love.
 I was thinking about our weekly catch up and the best I could come up with aside from work,
 I'm not sure we did anything unusual or extraordinary or dare I say even interesting.
 I mean, I had lots of meetings with lots of interesting people to be sure, but I don't want
 to talk about them, you know, I want to honor their privacy. But did we do anything noteworthy
 or interesting? We just said, yeah, a bunch of meetings and then dinner with friends.
 Yes, right. Today I did finish our more than enough course. I have been meeting, I've been doing group coaching with cohort of students who signed up for the more than enough course, which I've had tremendous joy.
 As you might imagine, as a teacher,<br/>
 I love that you call them a cohort.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 That sounds very like you're planning something.
 Yeah, we're planning on revolutionizing our lives by partnering with the economy of heaven.
 but if I hear the word cohort, good heavens,
 I'm just realizing the guinea cages part way off the table,
 and I'm wondering if the girls did that
 or if the guineas are trying to give him
 a hairy karaoke or something.<br/>
 -Back to cohorts.<br/>
 -Back to cohorts.<br/>
 It seems like this is my cohort in crime, not so much.
 -I think the phrase is partner in crime.
 Just how tired are you?<br/>
 Do you think cohort is Spanish for partner?
 (laughing)<br/>
 Is that one of the issues?
</p><ul>
  <li>I don't know.
 Never mind, keep going.
  </li><li>Anyway, I had to tremendous joy.
 Every Saturday morning, for the last couple of weeks,
 I've met with them and I just love listening to them.
 I've got so much gladness being with them and hearing
 their stories and their questions and their testimonies
 and their curiosities and I love it.
 If you missed out on the more than enough course,
 it's worth mentioning you can do the more than enough
 course anytime you want.
 It's available 24 hours a day.
 If you go to AlanNadier.com, you can just click on, you know, our courses thing and you can enroll in it.
 I won't be coaching people through it, but you can do it yourself and it's made so that...
  </li><li>That's how it's designed. - Yeah.
 It's made for you to just work through it.
 But we could catch up. We don't really have anything to talk about.
  </li><li>No. - Which is just as well, because we're going to go into our main topic.
  </li><li>It's true. - And it's true that landscaping wasn't just a sweeping fad.
  </li><li>No. - It wasn't just a weekend anomaly.
  </li><li>No. - We've actually committed to it.
 committed to it. Because shockingly, you can't actually just do the front yard this afternoon
 and do the back yard tomorrow afternoon and be done and be done. And even if you could
 do that, you still wouldn't be done because life keeps going. Here's a bonus lesson. I
 was thinking about this and I didn't write it down. How many of you have ever heard somebody
 say, Oh, inner healing? Yeah, I did inner healing. And I'm like, inner healing is like
 landscaping. You can do landscaping, but you have to keep doing more because everything
 that you did continues to grow. And so inner healing is like the same. Okay, you are so
 tired. Ladies and gentlemen, if you just close your eyes.
 I'm so sorry. Did they stay closed?
 You kind of passed out momentarily. Okay. Well, so last week, we did do some landscaping.
 This week, we did even more. We did. I mean, not just today that we're going to talk about,
 but during the week, I had a couple of late evening landscaping. I went out for a couple
 flowers and at night, not night. I planted things and we did. Let's talk about you. What did you do, darling?
 I planted things. You did and you seem to know how to do it automatically.
 Well, I have planted things before. I know you're like, "How'd you know how to do that?" I was like, "I don't know. Somebody showed me once."
 You're like laying down soil and then you have a travel and you're making a little well and then you're filling with water.
 And then you soaked the thing that was in the pot to loosen up the weeds and then you tap, tap, tap.
 Roots, yeah.
 And look at you. Do I say weeds? I meant roots.
 Yeah, I'm not planting weeds.
 We planted, or you planted.
 Hosta plants.
 Yeah, we basically stole the idea from our neighbors who've got,
 as aforementioned, a beautiful front yard.
 And they do.
 The problem with hostas is they look like they're vegetables.
 Just waiting to be put.
 They do not look like vegetables.
 It looks like there's something juicy and delicious underneath like giant beetroots.
 No, it doesn't look like that. I think you're confused.
 Beetroots aren't juicy and delicious.
 I love beets. AJ hates beets.
 But you planted hosstas and something called dragon's breath.
 Yes, I love them.
 And then we have some hanging baskets.
 I'm going to try and do that clever thing where I'll put in
 album art at this point.
 So if you're playing your podcast in an app that supports album art,
 You should see pictures of our hanging baskets right now,
 and maybe some pictures of our hostas.
 And you can tell me that they do it like the tops of vegetables.
 They don't like the tops of vegetables.
 Maybe the people will speak.
 Okay, I found a kit that's called a shady garden hosta kit or something like that,
 that's for our zone.
 Because did you know you have to plan according to the zone in America that you're in?
 Of course you did.
 Sure you did.
 What's that about?
 Like is that like it's illegal to monitor?
 No, no, like weather like weather they'll survive. Oh, I thought it was like big government trying to control us. Oh, yeah, definitely
 Anyway, they're all the like really cool bright colored
 Hostas that look like they're probably from
 Zelda and it's a shade kit
 So it gives you like a gajillion different plants that are all designed to be in the shade
 But a lot of our gardens in the sun. So why do we want them to be?
 In the back, under all the big trees, it's all shade, and you could have really bright
 pops of color under there.
 It would look so cool.
 We have an enormous backyard.
 It's ridiculously large.
 I was kind of shocked because we set up our irrigation system, and of course, we have
 a internet controllable irrigation system that is way smarter than I am.
 Naturally.
 The only thing I'd write out for is if there's a house fire, it turns on all our water sprinklers
 our house fire doesn't spread to our neighbors. That's super nerdy. Also our lights turn red
 because that's the easiest thing in the color spectrum when they're smoke. But I digress.
 But anyway, when I was setting up, I wanted to know the square foot of the lawn for the zone,
 I mean. And their backyard is like a thousand square foot of lawn.
 I'm sure it's more than that, darling.
 Well, the way I solved that problem was I went on Google Maps, looked at our home,
 And then you use a Google map tool where you draw around our line.
 And I don't know.
 Google's ever lied.
 So I'm not suggesting Google lied.
 I'm suggesting you're not remembering the right number.
 Okay.
 Well, that's possible.
 Okay.
 Very possible.
 This week you've got the lessons.
 I have some.
 You have some too.
 You told me you had some and I only had to come up with.
 I think you told me two or three.
 Well, I didn't want to stress you.
 But I came up with five.
 Look at you, you overachiever.
 But I lost my glasses somewhere between the last time I read them to you.
 And now, oh, did I tell you that I texted the Terminax guy and asked him to,
 I don't know, take care of my slippers instead of spiders.
 You just make friends with all sorts of people.
 Yeah, he was like, what now?
 Anyway.
 All right, so we've been landscaping.
 And as for landscaping, we're learning things that are applicable to life.
 Give me a lesson that came to you as your landscaping today.
 Less number one.
 You ready?
 I'm so ready.
 Tell me.
 Sometimes it looks like it's getting worse before it starts to get better.
 That is both through in landscaping and in life.
 It's true.
 What was it about your life?
 These are true in landscaping and in life.
 What was it about the landscaping escapade today that made you think that?
 Well, you know, I was cutting off all the little dead tree limbs.
 And we have like a whole bunch of trees back there.
 And so I was just trying to like, you know, make a good cut on
 on tree limbs that fell over in the storms and then trying to trim up the dead things and whatever.
 And before you know it, you have a lawn full of dead things and it looks like,
 Oh my gosh, it's going to take forever.
 It's like a tree cemetery.
 Yeah.
 And it doesn't really look that much better just yet.
 You know, so it's just sort of like, Oh, this is so much work for it to
 still look awful. But I mean, it got cleaned up.
 And where's that shown up for you in life?
 I think probably lots of places. I think when you first start going into like inner healing
 type stuff and you start when you stop partnering with being a victim and start partnering with
 the Holy Spirit, bringing healing, it can feel pretty overwhelming. Like this is way worse
 than I thought.
 Right. Cause you're looking at stuff you previously ignored.
  </li><li>Right, or try to push down and all that kind of stuff.
 So I think that would be my main example for that.
  </li><li>It's funny you say that 'cause today,
 what I got done amongst other things,
 but the kind of the main thing I got done
 is we have a large hedge.
 Is it a hedge?
  </li><li>A hedge of protection.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>It's not a very good hedge of protection.
 'Cause it doesn't go all the way
 with these big holes in it and you can get through it.
 But what is it?
 What are we saying? - And we don't need protection
 from our neighbors, but it's still the hedge of protection.
 What kind of hedges?
 It's not really a hedge, it's a skip laurel.
 It's a hedge.
 Okay, so it's a giant skip laurel
 that is about six foot tall on one side
 and because of the gradient on the other side
 in our neighbor side.
 Well, we have a retaining wall on the other side.
 So it's probably nine feet tall from their side.
 So it's really hard to see what you're doing
 and it was probably,
 I probably trimmed it down to six foot.
 It was probably a little bit more on wheeled on our side.
 So I've got this hedge trimmer and I'm holding it way above my head, which I can't see what
 I'm doing.
 And you're spotting for me, like to the left, no, to the right.
 Okay.
 Now has a Mohawk.
 Okay.
 Bring it down.
 Move it forward.
 You just gave the hedge a Mohawk.
 We need something to happen here.
 And how wide would you say it is?
 I mean, like the blade doesn't go across the full width.
 Three and a half, four feet.
 So we're there.
 Something like that.
 So I'm having a trim it from either side.
 it's the same thing where it doesn't look good.
 Like I'm really trimming in faith.
 And I'm thinking it's better than it was
 and it will be better in a couple of weeks.
 And I think sometimes I've experienced that in therapy
 where counseling or in or healing or whatever,
 where something comes up and you're like,
 "Why are we looking at this?"
 I would, you know, I don't want to be present with this thing.
 But you know, sometimes process is painful
 and it's a necessary step.
 And as you say, it gets better.
 It's true.
 All right, beautiful.
 Are you just going to run through your list?
 Sure.
 Go run through your list.
 So I mentioned my revelation that I just had this moment.
 I just found all of our cereal bowls inside plates.
 Do you have a confession you'd like to make?
 I'm like, what is happening over there?
 In my defense, when I was a little boy,
 I was forever known as eating bowls of cereal
 and then leaving them beside the sofa.
 Yeah, that doesn't surprise me at all.
 And so now I've translated that to as I'm in my office and one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.
 There's only 11 used pieces of crockery in here.
 And all the color that goes with it.
 And yeah, and the color that goes with it.
 But I come by honestly.
 Wait a minute.
 How do you come by and honestly your parents would leave stuff around?
 No, no, they didn't discipline me properly enough.
  </li><li>This is a style.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Okay, all right, good.
 Because you heard it here, first folks.
 All right, the next one was,
 what looked good in one season
 doesn't necessarily look good in the next season.
  </li><li>Ooh, unpack that.
  </li><li>Well, I was just thinking,
 like some things are like,
 they're not perennials, perennials are more than one annuals.
 You know, like some things are just designed for,
 they're only gonna bloom during this season.
 And then afterwards, they're going to go back to looking like a weed or potentially worse.
 Like like the ones I all pulled up and you're like, why did you pull up our
 daffodils and our lilies?
 You pulled up tulip sterling.
 Oh, they were tulips.
 You don't pull up tulips.
 Well, to be honest, they look like weeds, look like celery.
 And I hate celery.
 OK, well, it wasn't growing celery in the front yard.
 Anyway, so I was just sort of thinking that, yeah, something that looks good.
 in one season doesn't necessarily look good in another.
 And that's usually because the season has changed.
 And I was thinking about, sometimes we hang on to,
 whether it's a revelation or something
 that seemed like a good idea in one season,
 and it's actually not the best idea for this,
 the current season.
 That's all, that's what I was thinking.
  </li><li>Yeah, can you think of a personal thing in your life
 that you get an example of that holding on to something
 that was fine in one season?
 I mean, I know Paul said when I was a child,
 I did childish things, but you know, I'm a man, I put them away.
 But can you think of things that the Lord maybe had to wrestle out of your hands that
 you were holding onto?
 It was fine in one season, but now it wasn't appropriate.
 Well, I think, I think like for myself, I think the Lord's had to wrestle a bunch of
 different things out of my hands.
 So, but I guess the thing that comes to mind is sort of my own dreams, like the dreams
 that I had about what life was going to look like for a while, those dreams were my motivation
 to just keep living.
 And so they worked really well for that.
 But then there came a changing of seasons where the Lord was like, and I'm sure you'd
 be good at that.
 But actually what I have for you is this over here.
 Like, you know, I'm actually going to call you into ministry and you're not going to
 do what you think you thought you were going to do.
 But for years, what I thought I was going to do was something that encouraged me when
 things got hard because I was like, you know what, one day I'm just, I'm gonna, you know,
 I'm gonna be a lawyer and I'm gonna, everything's gonna go good.
 You know, anyway, so that was my thought.
 Yeah, that makes sense.
 What about you?
 No, I've pretty much been mature my whole life and never needed any correction or instruction.
 I'm pretty sure I have photographic proof that that's not true.
 Yeah, I mean, I can think of, I think what you're saying is great that like sometimes
 we use things for survival and then the Lord has to remind us you're not in survival.
 You know, you've been using all this energy just to survive, but actually I'd like to
 introduce you to something that will help you thrive.
 And that's like really, really, really risky.
 I also think about, you know, the closer you walk with the Lord, the more you draw close
 to the Lord, the brighter His light, the more you're aware of some of the stuff that
 before you thought you could get away with.
 And you know, so maybe you're reading
 or you're viewing habits, change in light of that.
 Like what was funny and humorous in that season
 is now like, actually that leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
 So yeah, I think it's important to keep our revelation
 of the Lord current.
 Otherwise our testimony becomes our history
 and we're living out of like an old season
 and we're supposed to be, you know,
 man does not live by bread alone
 but by every word that proceeds,
 not like from old revelation.
 So.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, number three.
  </li><li>Number three, weeds flower two.
 So Chelsea has an app and you have an app
 that you can take pictures of things.
 And it tells you, is this a weed
 or is it like supposed to be a pretty plant?
 You know, like is it?
 Because weeds also flower
 and you still don't wanna keep weeds.
 Like so, so my thought was sometimes things,
 they look like good things,
 or they may even look like pretty things
 or attractive things, but that doesn't necessarily mean
 that they're not gonna kill everything else around them.
 Does that make sense?
 So one of the things that we had in our backyard
 was the lambs ear.
 But I would didn't know if it was a weed or not.
 Like it seemed like every year there's more of them.
 And so I was like, huh.
 And so we scanned it and you know,
 people use it for decoration.
 It's not a weed, but I thought it might be a weed
 if it's choking out life from something else.
 Do you know what I mean?
 So I just thought it would be good if we had,
 well, we do, we have the Bible, but like I was thinking,
 oh, wouldn't it be fun if we had an app
 where we could scan something and know,
 is this gonna be life or death?
 But really we do have that, we have the Bible.
  </li><li>Did you tell a story last week about John?
  </li><li>I don't think so.
 tell that story because it fits in right here.
 Yeah, I remember when we lived in Johnny Carroll's basement and
 Johnny Carroll had been traveling a lot that summer and they, they
 would usually take a month off in the summer.
 And so they had just started their month off and John was out
 in the garden, you know, weeding stuff.
 And he pulled up what I thought was a small maple tree.
 Like, so I watched him like reef this thing out of the garden.
 And I literally went out and I went,
 "Why are you pulling out your tree?"
 And he's like, "This isn't a tree, this is a weed."
 Well, to me, I didn't know what was supposed to be there.
 And I hadn't planted the garden.
 It was John's garden.
 He knew what was supposed to be there.
 And so he knows, "Hey, this is either not supposed to be here
 or in the wrong place."
 And so he just reaped it right out of the ground.
 But it was so big by the time that he did that,
 I literally thought it was a little tree
 that they had planted.
 Well, I think the key thing that stood out when you told that story to me was John said to you very
 authoritatively, I didn't plant this.
 Yeah.
 And I was like, oh, like that's a good.
 Yeah.
 That's often a good sign too.
 Yeah.
 And that's interesting too, because I think sometimes, you know, the Lord in his kindness removes things
 because he didn't plant it.
 But we thought it was a tree.
 You know, we thought it actually, oh, this is a good thing.
 You know, and he's like, no, weed.
 You know, so, yeah.
 So that's number three.
 You're crushing it, baby.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 Number four,
 community makes everything that is hard, easier.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, preach it, baby.
  </li><li>So today we had some friends that came over
 and helped us enormously.
  </li><li>And I was so confused 'cause they were like,
 we love landscaping.
 And I was like, wait, what?
 Like, that was a real shock to me.
 What do you mean you love landscaping?
 And they're like, yeah, we'd love to come over and help.
 And I was like, just to clarify,
 we're not doing any of the cool things.
 Yeah, well, we'll be planting pretty things.
 Yeah.
 We're not doing a water feature.
 We're like literally weeding or liming trees or edging or trimming.
 You know, like there's nothing cool about this.
 It's just manual labor and 81 degree weather.
 And you want to do this?
 Like, yeah.
 It was way hotter than 81.
 But yes.
 And they, so they came over.
 And honestly, when we first started, I was like, I could cry.
 There's all I see is work everywhere.
 And I'm hot and I have other things I need to do.
 And it just looked totally overwhelming.
 But they came with their big smiles and their cheery dispositions
 and their gardening gloves and just got in it.
 Went to town. Went to town.
 And I was like, OK, OK, we can do this.
 You know, like I felt it.
 I felt it shift because friends were there to help.
 I think the other thing that really struck me about them being here is while I worked on my
 like if they weren't here, all I would have accomplished is the hedge being trimmed. I was
 a half a day's work. But while I was doing that, they were multiplying all of the goodness. They
 weeded all of our beds. They helped edge. They cleaned up so much stuff. They took the tree limbs
 away, you know, that bagged all the stuff. All of that stuff wouldn't have got done.
 Now, could I have done it? Sure. But it would have taken weeks.
 We'd still be out there. Oh, it would have just taken so long. And it is beautiful that
 that aspect of community brings transformation that's really maybe it's possible on your own,
 but it takes way longer. And it's much harder work. Yeah. And it feels easier when other people
 are there helping you with it. Right. Because they, like you say, there's some predisposition,
 their joy, they make the process far easier. So think back to I'm thinking about, I don't
 know why I'm thinking of this story. I'm thinking of the time that Stuart and then Lee confronted
 you in Toronto, about you keep all of your friends from school and ministry like this.
 Yeah. Do you want to tell that story? Yeah, I mean, they weren't the only ones. It was them and then
 Jenny and Sarah, all in a very short period of time that we're all like, hey, you keep us at
 at arm's length and we actually want to get to know you.
 We want to be in relationship with you.
 And I kind of thought we were friends already.
 You know what I mean?
 Like we were friends, but I get what they were saying.
 They were like, it was sort of relationship on my terms
 and I wasn't really letting them in, you know?
 And partially it was because I'd been hurt,
 they all worked for the school and I'd been hurt
 by somebody who worked for the school
 and I didn't realize like I'd made all these judgments.
 And so partially it was by design and partially it was because of all these judgments that were in place.
 And so I got to deal with all of that.
 And really those became my closest community after.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And it's an interesting example because could you have got that thing solved on your own?
 Sure.
 But like them pointing out them being with you, not just in pointing out the problem, but also in helping walk out the healing with you.
 It's just a real beautiful thing about like communities.
 a great idea. Bravo. Jesus. Yep. You did good Jesus. Community is good. Is this your last
 one? I think it's my last one. Are you ready? Tell me your last one. This one, Brett and
 Shaley will be very proud of me for number five. Is that sports analogy? No, what kind
 of hydrate you are not designed to go without water. That was my today's lesson. I kept getting
 like a little bit dizzy and then I'm like, I'm not drinking water. I'm out here in the
 heat and moving around, I'm not actually drinking water. And my
 thought was, I was just thinking about how many times in
 scripture, the Holy Spirit is referred to as some type of
 water. And I was thinking, Oh, yeah, like we're actually not
 designed to live dehydrated. Right. Yeah, we need, we need to
 hydrate. I'll give you a top tip though, if ever you're going
 to try and hydrate yourself, I went inside to get some water. And
 And I thought, oh, I should eat a banana for some minerals,
 you know, potassium.
 And so I am magnesium, is that right?
 That's some bananas.
 And so I ate a banana, which was fine.
 But then I chugged an ice cold, fizzy water.
 And boy, did my tummy not appreciate that.
  </li><li>So those two things together, didn't work for you?
  </li><li>Maybe don't do that.
  </li><li>Don't do that.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Good tip.
  </li><li>Yep, hydration.
 It is interesting that you can fill yourself
 into thinking that you're okay.
 But then have detrimental effects later.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like Sunstroke Eaststroke.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, and also, I mean,
 I have the additional thing of I don't sweat,
 so I just overheat and then pass out.
  </li><li>You just glow.
  </li><li>Yeah, I glow.
  </li><li>But so too, with the Holy Spirit,
 how easy is just to keep chugging?
  </li><li>Yeah, keep going.
  </li><li>And keep going on, I'm fine, I'm good.
 I'm good, I'm good.
  </li><li>I'm fine then, you know.
  </li><li>I have an incredible capacity to just keep pushing through.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>And then the Holy Spirit's like, "Hi there."
  </li><li>"Hi."
  </li><li>"Why are you spiritually on your back, passing out?"
 You're not okay, you know that, right?
 You had a bunch of things I already had.
 Oh, yeah.
 I only have two other lessons.
 Oh, what else do you have?
 You didn't steal mine, but we had similar things.
 Well, one of the things I thought,
 and I don't even know what number we're on,
 is this came from earlier this week when I went out to weed.
 I didn't know when, I didn't know this weekend
 we were going to get to something.
 So Monday night I went out after dinner for about an hour,
 hour and a half, you know, from like six to seven thirty.
 The sun is not quite going down like it's still ridiculously hot, but it's not the new day sun
 Hmm and from our living room window
 It looks out over our backyard and there's a particular corner of our backyard that could tell
 The the beds look like they had a lot of weeds and probably needed some help and so I went out and it wasn't until I got there
 Did I actually realize how bad things were like I was vaguely aware of it
 But when I went I was like holy mother of pearl like this is a nightmare and
 Actually the more and more I we did the more and more I was aware of how many weeds there were
 You know that whole thing and then you look back to see the progress you've made
 It's not as stark as you thought it might be in fact
 You've noticed bits that you've missed and that took me over and I didn't realize we had two trees in that corner
 And then oh my gosh, I really some of the trees are hanging over into our neighbors
 Do we need to fix that and wait?
 There's an area. Oh, is that drainage ditch this happened or is that erosion now suddenly I'm aware of all these things and I big
 As I was thinking about I was thinking it's only when you pay attention
 Can you actually see I was thinking about like life ministry inner healing?
 Therapy like how often I've gone through life
 Not knowing something about me that probably everyone else I'm in relationship with knows about me
 But it's invisible to me because I haven't paid attention to that thing yeah
 Or maybe an expert would have known about you because my company somebody walking through our yard
 As would probably go
 You want to
 Well for us we're like what or it's so normal to us that we've lost how crazy it's like you come in here
 And go babe you've got 11 think I'm like I do and then I look down like I do
 I'm just so accustomed to them being here because I've been here all week
 Yeah.
 But I can think of times in life when people have tried to point things out about the thing
 I can't see and I can't see it because I'm not paying attention.
 That's why we pay professionals.
 Right.
 But then, you know, pain hits or you're willing to be humble and explore something new.
 Yeah.
 Once you pay attention, it's only then that you could see.
 So that was the one thing that stood out for me.
 The second thing that stood out for me,
 and you're probably gonna chuckle at this,
 is last week and this week,
 I did gardening, landscaping, yard work,
 whatever you wanna call it,
 without my phone and without my Apple watch on.
  </li><li>You did?
  </li><li>And I was like living in a distraction-
  </li><li>I nearly brought your watch out to you babe.
 And then I was like, no.
  </li><li>I didn't want it.
 Because I've noticed that not wearing a watch,
 not having my phone on, or phone in my pocket rather,
 I lost track of time and it made me think I wonder how much of my day do I give away
 by doing things like checking notifications or responding to text or thinking I'm bored
 and scratching that itch by distracting myself.
 But today, I didn't know what time it was and rather than that being alarming, it was
 quite nice.
 I just let the day carry me along and I stopped when I was tired or hungry and I got a snack
 and got a refreshment, I started work when I did and we just made progress and decided
 to stop when we wanted to. It wasn't, you know, we're quite highly structured in our
 life. And having a Saturday where I didn't do that, like, I really, really loved it.
 And the other thing I thought about is like landscaping is an activity that's very wholesome.
 I don't mean wholesome in terms of like morality. I mean, wholesome in that it takes the whole of you
 to engage in the process.
 And you know, like my whole, no pun intended,
 my soul focused today,
 I kind of lost track of the fact that it was roasting hot,
 I'm near passing out, I'm sweating, I'm really tired,
 I'm really filthy.
 And I'm just doing this thing and all of the cares
 of my world fade away and I'm just left with a manageable task.
 It's gonna take a couple hours, but then I can get it done.
 I know they weren't as profound as yours, but...
 Well, I have one extra one.
 Look at you come on.
 Actually we have two trees to apple trees in the backyard.
 They're they're Chinese crab apples.
 Well, what's funny is the lady when we bought the house, she said they were
 Fuji apple trees.
 And I was like, Oh, like Fuji apples are great.
 You know, but they've never grown apples.
 And we've been here for what five years, six years, six years.
 And they've so as far as I'm concerned, the apple trees have got to go.
 Like I just want to rip those things out and have done with it.
 They're not, they're not bearing fruit.
 And we gave it a chance to bear fruit.
 And then as it turns out, it's not even going to be fruit.
 If it did bear fruit, it's not even fruit you can eat.
 I mean, it's just what a waste.
 So it's stealing soil and nutrients from things that I do want to grow.
 So I want those ripped out.
 What was your lesson?
 Well, my lesson was, I think sometimes we keep trying to feed something, keep trying to,
 look for two or three years, I sprayed those trees with some sort of weird oil and, you
 know, all this stuff, because people are like, do this and it'll help the leaves and do that.
 And, you know, so did all these things.
 And, you know, at some point you have to just realize this is actually not bearing fruit.
 It's not doing what it's supposed to be doing.
 Right.
 So it's actually taking time away from something else.
 It's taking soil or nutrients away from something else.
 And so it's time to call a spade and say,
 all right, this thing is not staying.
 And that was my thought.
  </li><li>The saying might be, it's time to call a crab apple tree,
 a crab apple tree, a foodie apple tree, and rip out.
  </li><li>That's right, that's the expression.
 It sounds better in Chinese.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>So there you go, more lessons from landscaping.
  </li><li>There you go.
 I did love that one of our podcast listeners this week sent me photos of he and his wife doing
 landscaping and they were saying they're inspired by our podcast. So thank you, Chris and Amanda for
 that. That was fun watching you work. AJ Jones, if people want to get show notes for this week's
 episode, where might they go? Alan, I made you.com/280. You're right. That was yawning. That was supposed
 to be my voice, was it? And if people want to become members of the show, they go to Alan
 and aj.com/join.
 And it's fast approaching the time when applications for the School of Supernatural
 Life, which happens both in person on campus here in Franklin, Tennessee at Grace Center
 or from the comfort of your home via our online option, our applications for the school
 close on July 15th.
 July 15th.
 So we're coming up.
 I would super encourage you to pray about is the Lord asking you to set aside some time
 to add value to your life.
 I love the school.
 And it's not just because I'm part of the co-founders and one of the key teachers on
 it.
 But I love the transformation I see in the lives of our students.
 Yeah, so I just love having a concentrated amount of time to pour into students and watch
 real transformation take place.

 Idi Jones, any parting wisdom for our friends?
 No, I think you sleep well after you've worked hard.
 That's my parting wisdom.
 Well, that's what I hope.
 But for now, we are praying that you have an incredible week filled with goodness, filled
 laughter and we'll hope to be back in your years this time next week. Bye bye.
