<p> AJ Jones. Yes, sir. How are you my beautiful woman? I am well. Thank you.
 You look stunning today. Do you know that? Thank you. You look great in that yellow outfit.
 Thank you. Match is your teeth. Sorry, since you stopped smoking, you know, your teeth
 have not really yelled. Oh, you're so funny. You're so funny. The yellow, callous skin
 of your fingertips. That's beautiful. I'm joking. That was Scottish Love Language for
 be right there. Not by way of redeeming myself after that common, but you made a fantastic
 dish this week.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 When we were in Toronto, there used to be this restaurant that we would always want
 to go to after church. We thought for years it was called Fomi 99, just off of 427, wasn't
 it? And Queensway?<br/>
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 Look at me.<br/>
 No, not me.<br/>
 There we go.<br/>
 Close enough.<br/>
 Close enough. But I've since discovered that Faux is actually pronounced "fa". Maybe
 Maybe me isn't pronounced me, so it was F&Atilde;&iexcl;, me 99.
 And they would serve these bowls of F&Atilde;&iexcl;, which I'd never experienced before.
 No, we don't eat F&Atilde;&iexcl;.<br/>
 We didn't eat F&Atilde;&iexcl;?<br/>
 We didn't eat F&Atilde;&iexcl;.<br/>
 Well, what was it then? What do we eat?
 We eat vermicelli noodle bowls.<br/>
 Isn't that what F&Atilde;&iexcl; is?<br/>
 No, F&Atilde;&iexcl; is soup.<br/>
 It's that those big bowls of soup with the big fat noodles in it.
 Oh, I thought that's what we had because it was noodles in a big bowl filled with a soup-like structure.
 Nope.<br/>
 Yeah, but there was no soup. Oh, it was soupless. It was soupless. It just did have fluid in it.
 Yes, small amounts of fluid. Okay. I just thought it was a poor man's portion of soup. I thought
 that's what far was anyway. Every Sunday or most Sundays we'd go there and you would have this
 bowl of fresh herbs, herbs, vegetables, chicken or beef and then this kind of like spicy soup-like
 thing that isn't soup that you would pour over it and then you eat it with noodles and it was
 absolutely filling and absolutely delicious and completely cheap. And I haven't had it in years
 because I haven't found a fah place. Yeah, it was like 599 for this massive bowl of food.
 Oh, superb. Yeah. But this week, you made a paleo version of it. Talk to me about that.
 I did. Well, I, one of the things I miss about Toronto is the fah
 that we're not having because we're having a burmantillian noodle ball. But anyway, I miss
 Spomey 99. So I got it in my head that I thought, huh, I'm pretty sure I could make
 a version of that with zucchini noodles. So I spiralized zucchini noodles and I cooked
 them for about four and a half minutes and then put them in the bowl instead of for
 machella noodles but still had all of the other fresh ingredients. Plus I marinated
 some steak and we had that.
</p><ul>
  <li>It was a taste sensation, no word of lie.
 It was a party in my mouth.
 It was so deliciously spicy and fresh and zesty
 and it was absolutely delicious.
 For a recipe that you pulled out of your head,
 it was absolutely amazing.
  </li><li>I did write it all down afterwards
 so that I wouldn't forget what I did.
  </li><li>You can post it on the blog this week.
  </li><li>Depends.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Ladies and general, I'll try and get her to post that
 on the blog.
 But anyway, that was delicious.
 AGU ended up going to Warby Parker
 and ordered some glasses.
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>And everybody picked a pair that I don't like.
  </li><li>Yes, well, what's funny is that
 between the, there was five pairs,
 there was two that he liked,
 but really just one that he really liked.
 And I, that was the one I hated the most.
 And then there was these two pairs
 that I thought really looked good and he didn't like.
 And those are the two that got the most votes.
 So, but I think we--
 I'm fine. We live on democracy. I think we have a winner.
 Right. I'm mind should arrive this week. So I'm going back to being Specky.
 Specky McGee. Other than that, I went to dentist, went to work. But the big news is we have friends
 in 10 this week. We do. Our dear friend, Dan Laura Osman and Mark and Kim DuPont
 have been ministering at Grace and this weekend. And it's been awesome. It's been lovely having
 Laura here, forgotten how beautiful Laura's voice is.
 Let's talk about Laura's mean-spirited nature.
 If you've never met Laura, you know, ridiculous statements.
 There's a handful of people in my life that are honestly so pure-hearted, so sweet, so sweet and genuine.
 It takes your while to realize it's genuine, but so sweet and pure-hearted that you wonder if you're actually saved when you're around them.
 Yeah, or like to begin with, you think it can't possibly, they can't possibly be that sweet.
 Right. So on the top of the top, I had you go Becky dollar. Yep. Would be one of those people.
 Michelle vouchers. Michelle vouchers. And then Laura Woodley,
 Osmondly. We were just so tender and beautiful spirit and just so in love with Jesus and so
 childlike and adorable. Adorable.
 Anyway, so she's been leading worship, which is absolutely amazing.
 Laura, I know you listen to our podcast, so we just want to tell you, we love you.
 And if you have never heard Laura's music, if you've ever been in a meeting that we've
 been ministering at, there's a good chance you've heard her music because
 whether you realize it or not.
 Yeah, her album, Home, is one of the best soaking cities I've ever personally
 soaked to and I absolutely love it.
 If you don't own a copy, you want to go to iTunes and download a copy.
 It's superb.
 It's amazing.
 Yeah.
 And then Mark was ministering all weekend.
 We're going to talk about Mark in a second because I want you to tell some stories if you wouldn't mind.
 Okay.
 But that was our week. Good food. 24 is finished. So we're a loss of what to do.
 I don't mind that it's finished. I didn't think it was that fantastic.
 Right. You were a little bit traumatized by it.
 Now you're swapping the trauma of Jack Bauer for Gordon Ramsey because we're a little master chef.
 And then your fah, about except it wasn't fah, but it kind of was. And I went to dentist,
 you got some glasses and we did a conference all weekend.
 What did your dentist say, darling?
 My dentist said, "You must be from Scotland based on the dentistry work that you have."
 And I said, "You're correct."
 And I think when he looked at me, he just saw dollar signs.
 No.
 Because if all the rest were to work, then it needs to be done.
 Oh, well, yes.
 There's a whole color in your mouth that shouldn't be there.
 That's right.
 I think he's going to mine it and then sell it and make jewelry out of it.
 We had a readjust question this week.
 Yeah, this is from Amy.
 And Amy asked, well, first of all, she said something very nice.
 She said, I don't really know how I stumbled onto your podcast, but I've listened to everyone
 and I love it.
 Well, thank you.
 I don't know how stumbled onto your question, but I read it and I loved it.
 Your question.
 So now we're quits question.
 How does your church implement any mentoring programs and who benefits from these most
 in your opinion?
 Well we don't historically we have not a mentoring program per se you know a bunch of our passes
 will have mentored individuals along the way but it's not on the basis of a program.
 But I would hope that any mentoring program would benefit the mentee because it's not
 the focus of it.
 What we've probably poured most of our time and energy into the last couple of years is
 our school of supernatural life which while not a mentorship program is an eight month
 school of accelerated growth and you will learn from our staff and our
 pastoral team and visiting speakers and prophets and revivalists and teachers
 from all over the world. We really figured it was the best way to give away
 what we have to the larger amount of people rather than just mentoring one or
 two people, you know, a year and really sort of be able to mine what God's
 give it us and given others in order to bring growth.
 I would say just from being around a bunch of people who have either mentored people
 or a bunch of people who have been mentored, I would say the success of the mentoring
 is largely dependent on the people or the parties involved.
 So for example, when I was being mentored by John and Carol, I would just, you know,
 I was determined to get out as much out of it as possible.
 I didn't sit around going, "Okay, it's your job to mentor me."
 It was my job really to learn as much as I could from these amazing people.
 So I would just ask some questions everywhere we went.
 And I would never leave their side, wherever they were and whatever they were doing, I
 wanted to do.
 And if that involved me doing setting up a book table or catching for people, catching
 people for when they prayed, that's fine too.
 Yeah, I just wanted to be as attentive as possible and look and see what I saw and then ask about
 the observations I made. So I'm not sure if that's a very helpful answer, but currently
 our mentorship program at Grace Center looks like the school of supernatural life. And then,
 we have the students that come out of that, really, we are constantly looking throughout
 the school of who can we ask, who can we keep for the next year to be our small group leaders,
 to help our staff handle the next school. And so our students that come back for a second year,
 so to speak as small group leaders, they will get a little bit more hands on mentoring from
 our school pastors, Josh and Sarah Parsons. But really, every person I meet, I'm looking to not
 only learn from, but how can I help along their way? But anyway, there's a long warble answer to
 a simple question. I hope that answers the question you had. Thanks for asking.
 AJ, you have told the story a couple of times this weekend, but I wanted to talk about our first
 encounters with prophets because I think nowadays we take prophets and the prophetic
 ministry. I don't think we take it for granted. I hope we don't take it for granted, but I
 think it's such a normal part of our everyday life that I certainly have forgotten that
 once upon a time it was just this foreign concept to me. And so I thought it would be
 fun to talk about our first experiences with prophets. And because of Marx visiting town,
 been telling the story a lot, but for people who weren't at the conference or haven't heard it before,
 I know you've told us part of your testimony. Tell us your first encounter with a prophet
 and what it was like and what it did for you. Yeah, so my first encounter with a prophet was with
 Mark, and I had been going to the church in Toronto. I don't know, I want to say about six months or so.
 And I was still struggling with all an enormous amount of stuff.
 It was within a year, I think after dad had killed himself and I was
 you know, not eating, not sleeping, just completely obsessed with killing myself.
 So there was, you know, significant issues still going on.
 So you're very broken, very damaged, your suicidal, your bulimic.
 Anorexic.
 OK, take your pick.
 your honor, I think your life is pretty much in shambles and you've turned up at this church
 and you've been going there for six months and then what happens?
 So it was a Sunday night meeting and we had gone, Sandy and I had gone and Sunday night meetings
 were always fun because they were a bunch of different churches who come together and
 have food and all that kind of stuff. And so we went to the meeting and I remember seeing Mark
 come in and I didn't know who Mark was. I mean, I think they'd been there for a little bit by
 them, but I don't think I had actually seen him. Sandy knew who he was. And so I saw him come in
 and I had asked Sandy, like I was like, hey, check out that, you know, look at that guy in the
 leather jacket and she said, "Oh yeah, that's that's Mark DuPont." At the time he had a
 red mullet, if I remember correctly, like his hair was redder than it is now and it was a mullet.
 We should ask him to bring back the mullet. No. If I was gonna say anything was missing
 from the Sweet Cairns conference, it was probably a red mullet. Yeah, that's true. It's true. We
 didn't have any mullets. But anyway, so I'd seen him and she said, "Oh yeah, that's Mark DuPont.
 he's a prophet and I didn't get that. I was like, "What do you mean he's a prophet?"
 I mean like an Old Testament prophet and you know, it says telling that story this weekend,
 Mark says, "Yeah, like that, but better looking." So it was kind of funny. But anyway,
 so anyway, you know, normal service, they did worship and whatever and Mark got up and started
 speaking. And then Mel's speaking stopped and he pointed at me and he said to Sandy,
 And you know, Sandy, who's that girl sitting next to you?
 And Sandy said it's AJ.
 And so I said, AJ, stand up.
 And so I stood up and he proceeded to walk through my life with so much detail that I
 was almost terrified.
 You know, I was like, uh, how does he know this?
 I don't understand.
 And you know, tell me things that nobody knew.
 I mean, and certainly nobody in that building knew.
 He couldn't have gotten information from anybody there.
 I was hanging out of the chair in front of me with a death grip as he told me all this
 stuff.
 He told me stuff for like 10 minutes.
 At the end he said, "I see a gold box and I know what the gold box was.
 The gold box was where I had an actual bronze box.
 I still have it, where I kept all my stuff from my dad who had killed himself, you know,
 a year or so before.
 And I had recently decided that I was going to try and kill myself again, but I was going
 to make sure that it worked.
 And so I had written these letters so that after I was gone, you know, there would be
 a letter for my mom or my cousin or whoever.
 And even in death, a shaper.
 That's pretty funny.
 Anyway, so yeah.
 So Mark finished his prophetic word with, you know, if you don't want your life, why
 don't you give it to God and see what he can do with it?
 Because he said, I know about your goal box.
 He said, I know about your goal box.
 And I knew.
 And if you don't want your life, why don't you give it to God and see what he can do with
 it?
 Yeah.
 Like the, and you're sparing some details.
 I, I appreciate that.
 But he really did just read through your life, tell you events in your life, the dates, the
 timing, which is supernatural.
 Stuff that nobody could have known.
 So by now God's got your attention and he closes up with the.
 Totally had my attention.
 And you know, when you're living in a place where you're, you're suicidal and you're lonely to
 hear that God knows the details of your life means you're actually not alone.
 So, you know, it was sort of like, it was really difficult to wrap my head around what
 was happening.
 Then he just went back into preaching and Sandy had to tell me to sit down because I
 was still standing and a little bit confused.
 And at the end of the service, he had asked people that, you know, how to prophetic gifting
 or something to that effect to stand.
 And, you know, I didn't stand.
 I was still sort of shaking from what had happened.
 And he turned and he said, "Hey, Jay, you don't stand up for this."
 And I yelled, "No."
 I was like, "No."
 'Cause I was scared.
 And I didn't know how to explain what he had done.
 And anyway, he said, "Oh, it's okay.
 You don't have to be afraid."
 And I was like, "Okay."
 And so he got us all to move out into the aisle
 and started praying for people.
 But he came and he probably stood about a meter from me
 or a yard in a little bit for the Americans in the room.
 And he got that close and all of a sudden I fell over
 and now that wouldn't freak me out,
 but then I mean, I'd never even seen anybody
 slain in the spirit.
 So I was like, there's something wrong with me,
 I can't stand like, you know, go paramedic.
 And then I started laughing.
 I mean, just uncontrollably laughing.
 And that went on for 45 minutes.
 I'm not a quiet laffer.
 My face was cramping, my stomach was cramping.
 I was, and the whole time I'm thinking,
 why are you laughing?
 Dad's still dead, life is horrible, why are you laughing?
 Trying to convince myself not to,
 but I could not stop laughing.
 And Mark hadn't said anything,
 but laughter, he just prayed something.
 I don't even really remember.
 And of course there's people that are going more Lord
 and I'm thinking you guys should be calling somebody.
 I'm having a mental breakdown here, like calling ambulance,
 you know, but I mean, I know I got up off the floor
 that night, what a while later.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I've never struggled with suicide since then
 or eating disorders.
 I still didn't sleep for another couple of years after that,
 But I mean, it was literally like my whole life shifted onto different access.
 I love that story for so many reasons.
 But I think like for me, I think true prophetic ministry is a revelation of the
 father's love.
 Like when I see prophetic ministry administered properly, all it does is
 display the kindness of God.
 So I think about you being lost alone, broken and suicidal.
 And you're just thinking that everybody's forgotten about you and God would
 speak to you directly through Mark and let you know, hey, honey, I know everything
 about your life.
 And not only just say I know about your problems, but also address your problems
 and fix them supernaturally.
 I think it's, I think it's incredible.
 And you know, to tell somebody that it's completely suicidal, that God has a plan
 for your life, you know, hey, why don't you give your life to God and see what he
 can do with it was the first time I remember starting to think forward instead of just
 surviving the day.
 Right.
 My first experience with a prophet is way less.
 I don't want to say impressive, but yeah, absolutely way less impressive, way less interesting.
 But for me, it was nonetheless absolutely life changing.
 I remember reading a book, which if podcasts, as you have not read this book, I can't recommend
 it too highly enough.
 called "Surprised by the Voice of God" by Dr. Jack Deere. The first book I ever read,
 probably the first charismatic book I ever read, and in it he details accounts of Paul
 Cain, a prophet who's still alive today. And when I read the stories that he was describing,
 I was dumbfounded. I was literally, I couldn't believe what I was reading, I just thought,
 there is, I have never ever heard anything like this, and I'm struggling to believe that
 this is true. And for me, that piqued an interest in the prophetic for me. I just thought, this
 is the most outlandish thing I've ever heard. If God is still doing stuff like this today,
 then I need to find out where he's doing and who's doing it through. And that started for
 me was a multi-year journey into the prophetic. And for most of us, you're saying I've never
 even met a prophet and I didn't even know what a prophet looked like. And again, I find it
 funny now that we live in this culture where so many of our dearest friends are prophetic
 and our prophets and walk in that culture and it's part of our normal everyday life.
 But I read that book and just thought this is unbelievable.
 Again, if you haven't read that, I'll put a link in the show notes to it.
 That led me to another book by Mike Bickle called Growing in the Prophetic.
 And if the first book blew my mind, this one I had to stop and I honestly had to stop,
 take breathers because I was struggling to believe it was true.
 And then, you know, did a bunch of research and kept reading and was just astonished that
 God was doing something so powerfully on the earth and the prophets were real.
 Literally, it would be like finding out that somebody like Elijah and Elijah or Moses were
 still alive and the stories that you read about in the Bible were still happening.
 That's what happened for me.
 And so I saved up all my money to fly to Kansas City to just to go and see for myself.
 is this stuff real? And I remember going to Kansas City and it was so funny, this would
 have been 2002 and I hope was just in its early stages really, it was in a double wide
 trailer off ground view. And I went there and got connected with Sean Bowles through
 the Lord obviously, but through complete randomness. I just found somebody online who was in Kansas
 I didn't know Sean didn't know who Sean was emailed Sean and he was super hospitable super gracious
 So yeah, absolutely
 Here's my sister's number and just email her chill hook you up and she absolutely did and kind of with a bunch of people
 But that you know after reading for a couple of years about profits. I remember the first time I ever met
 prophetic people was in the
 Cafe I forget what the cafe is called I in Kansas City and to
 Prophetic gentlemen just sat down and did the same thing. They just sat before me and told me the secrets of my heart
 It was just a start. I just wept I actually got on video somewhere
 I filmed them and they just talked through my life and they began to tell me
 Who I was from God's perspective and it was all the stuff that I thought God had been telling me for the last couple years
 But I didn't believe I thought was making it up and I just thought I don't know what this is or how you do it
 But I absolutely have to have it.
 And that set me on my journey of learning to hear God's voice and, you know, understanding
 who he is and what he's like.
 But I just think it's amazing.
 I think prophets are such a great gift to the church.
 I think, you know, Jesus was a genius to give us prophets.
 And I think prophetic ministry is probably my favorite thing on the planet, to see prophetic
 ministry administered brilliantly.
 And then you can have a whole lot of fun with it.
 Yeah, if you're going to mention fun, you have to mention Gary Morgan.
 Very fun.
 Probably the most fun profit.
 Probably one of the most fun people period.
 I want to be like randomly writing profits on their funness.
 Well, we could have a funometer.
 We can invite all our profits over and say, okay, make me laugh.
 That's a very interesting idea.
 We'd love to hear from you about your experiences with profits.
 If you have a story about meeting prophets or being impacted by prophecy, give us some feedback.
 Go to Alan and Aj.com/contact and at the bottom there you'll see a feedback form you can send
 to someone. If you want to ask us a question about prophets or about recipes or about anything
 that you hear us on our podcast, go to Alan and Aj.com/ask. For now, we're going to end our podcast so we can go play with our kids.
 Or have a short nap no there will be no napping no i'm going to play the show that is a tiny nap you're pitching the wrong person.
 If you happen to be listening to this podcast on monday the twenty eighth of july and you live in the national area tomorrow night or tonight if you're listening to on monday.
 Tonight at Ammonate at 7.30, Mark II Pond will be ministering and Laura Woodley Osman will be
