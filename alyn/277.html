<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday
 Most wonderful show is<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses<br/>
 Mrs. Jones<br/>
 Yes sir<br/>
 You're looking mighty fine today<br/>
 Thank you<br/>
 Episode 277<br/>
 Welcome everybody<br/>
 To keeping up with Joneses<br/>
 I'm one of your hosts, Alan Jones<br/>
 Joining me today is my beautiful co-host
 Well this is very like, you know<br/>
 You can't show me that<br/>
 I'm gonna roll<br/>
 Alright<br/>
 You do you boo?<br/>
 You're wearing a suit jacket<br/>
 So it kind of feels formal
</p><ul>
  <li>It's true, yeah.
  </li><li>Give me a weekly catch up.
 How was your week being?
  </li><li>I don't even know.
 It felt full.
  </li><li>It has been very full.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think it's been pretty normal full-ish week,
 hasn't it?
  </li><li>Well, it's started with MJ being in the ER
 and ended so far with you being a funeral.
  </li><li>Oh, well that's true.
  </li><li>So it's not that normal.
  </li><li>Well, full.
 (laughs)
 Yes, MJ ended up in the ER.
  </li><li>MJ's fine, but he,
 Tuesday night, Tia had a band recital.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we were on the way there,
 and MJ started complaining of stabbing pains,
 and not complaining, started howling,
 and then started yelping,
 and then we were just crying, and I just did a U-turn,
 which wasn't easy, I was on the back,
 country road in a aging minivan.
 (laughing)
 But it was pulled on the handbrake,
 did a U-born, a U-turn.
  </li><li>You pulled on the handbrake, did a U-turn.
  </li><li>I'm like, wait, what now?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh, it sounded like it kind of like gremel it.
  </li><li>Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, okay, I got you.
 headed to ER, turns out there's nothing wrong with MJ.
 I mean, we didn't know that.
  </li><li>Yeah, some kind of weird--
  </li><li>The doctor's like-- - The dog or something.
  </li><li>Listenin' kids, it's either testicular torsion,
 it wasn't that, it's either appendicitis,
 but she prodded on as appendix and there was no reaction,
 or it could be kidney stone, really unlikely,
 and small child, but let's have a look, but, you know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>They didn't do an extensive testing,
 'cause by the time we got to ER
 and by the time he got admitted, he was fine,
 and by fine, I mean, talking, playing on his iPad
 the doctor came in and was like, you know, the only thing an easy test to do would be
 he's just been lying down, maybe getting him sitting up and moving around. And he was complaining
 of being hungry at this point, which makes sense. He hadn't eaten in hours. So the doctor
 got him some Gatorade and some cheese crackers. Yeah. So he ate those was observed for like
 four or five minutes and the doctor was like, yeah, he looks fine. Yeah. And I was like,
 okay, well, that's the most expensive bottle of Gatorade I've ever. Hey, and cheese crackers.
  </li><li>That's not for the chief.
  </li><li>You know, so.
  </li><li>But curious, you were, you came home and found out
 two other kids in his school had exactly the same symptoms.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it was interesting 'cause one of,
 I was sitting next to one of his teachers at the recital
 'cause her daughter was playing in the same band as Tia.
 And so it was a recital, it was a band concert thing.
  </li><li>Was not a recital.
  </li><li>Well, I don't know, maybe.
 I thought it was a, I don't know what they call it.
 Anyway, it was loud.
 There's 200 children with instruments and a gym, you know.
 The acoustic treatment.
 Sound insulation.
 Oh, it's beautiful.
 Um, but she was saying, yeah, there was two other kids that sort of
 doubled over and were in pain for like a couple hours and then they were fine.
 But then she had made the suggestion of, you know, it also might be because
 it's T cap next week and a bunch of the kids are getting stressed out because
 they've never done T cap before.
 And so they're just hearing about this mysterious T cap all the time.
 And she said, I think we actually stressed them out.
 So I was like, huh?
 Anyway, yeah.
 So we don't know what was going on there.
 He's all fine.
 Thank you.
 But he is banned thing was great.
 She did really well.
 You got to go.
 I got to go.
 And then we had weathered.
 Didn't we on Wednesday?
 Boy, did we have weathered.
 Give us a weather report, baby.
 Well, it was funny because, you know, we're, we're sitting in senior team
 trying to decide, do we cancel Wednesday night classes?
 And you're looking outside and it is beautiful, sunny,
 Like it doesn't look like there's anything headed our way.
 Glorious.
 Glorious.
 But Nashville severe weather who we adore and follow on Twitter is saying, you know,
 this, this storm gets to us around seven and, you know,
 escalates around eight or nine.
 And we were like, seven is drop off between eight and nine is pickup.
 Seems like.
 But it's never easy making future judgment calls.
 No, because, you know, you, you don't want to false alerts.
 you want our youth and Wednesday's intercession prayer.
 We want our services to run,
 but we also wanna care for the people who are--
  </li><li>But even at dinner, like we're eating at 5.30,
 it's still nice and sunny outside.
 And the girls were like,
 "Why did we cancel youth for this?"
 But man, did that storm roll in.
 Yeah, it was impressive.
  </li><li>That was an intense one.
  </li><li>Yep, and sadly, I didn't think about,
 we browned out a couple of times
 and then we like fully lost power.
 Brown is a black out is when your power goes out completely brown out is when your power goes out intermittently we
 either
 blacked out for a couple solid seconds or browned out long enough to
 shut off my dehumidifier and
 I had no idea pray for us. I know I was I was
 Didn't you just the next one play back in on a finish? Well, I did but I went up
 I dehumidify my own apples for the guinea pigs. It's they know they heard the trauma
 It's completely normal.
 And so I went up the next day to like put them all in the container thinking,
 yeah, I have new treats ready for them.
 And nothing was dehydrated in.
 Then I was like, Oh man, I plugged this in about two hours before those brownouts.
 So I had to run it again.
 This is the weekly cash up there.
 You go.
 I know you were like really wondering about this.
 We go together.
 We did.
 Yeah, we did the senior leadership.
 Oh, yeah, we did.
 And Jeff, that was this week.
 Yeah.
 have our senior team were otherwise occupied.
 So yeah, meet you and Jeff held on the four in episode.
 And then our friend David Campbell, who you're going to hear from momentarily.
 We got to pick him up from the airport last night.
 And we get to host him for nearly a week, which is so great.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 If you are listening to this podcast on Monday, April 18th, today is your
 last day to enroll in the more than enough course.
 If that's live and we're accepting enrollments, the more than enough course is a course that
 I've designed to teach you all about the biblical foundations of both blessing and abundance.
 And the way it works, I'm running it for four weeks, you will watch about an hour's worth
 of video content a week, you'll answer some questions.
 And then on Saturday mornings, I'll meet with you to coach you, to process some of the questions
 that I asked you during the week, answer any questions you might have, and you'll get
 encouragement from hearing other people on the course and you'd be able to share testimonies.
 I'd love you to come do the course. I'm really eager for people to have more money, less stress and
 greater financial security when you understand what God's heart is for you regarding blessing and
 finances. If you want to enroll in the course, don't delay because this episode comes out on Monday
 and we've got a whole host of people who are faithful listeners on Monday. If you want to do
 do the course today is your last day. Go to Alan and ag.com/more to enroll. And I hope
 you can do the course. I'm excited to be with you.
 Yeah, be so fun.
 Agee, tell us about our main topic this week.
 Well, our main speaker this week is David Campbell.
 The right Reverend David Campbell.
 He is wonderful. He is very good friends with John and Carol. I remember him coming
 very near the beginning of the revival. And he used to speak often at conferences and
 things like that. He's just a wonderful, solid guy in the faith. And of course, overseas,
 I forget like 200 churches for I love.
 I love 200. 140 churches.
 Okay. So maybe that's like, I don't know how many staff that is. But same thing, I had
 like 200. Yeah.
 Overseas 140 churches. Yeah.
 Is a bit, yeah. One of the main leaders, part of the leadership team for the Elam network of
 Panacostal churches in the UK and further field.
 Yeah.
 And is a funny Scotsman.
 Oh, he's hysterically funny and so wise and just authentic and real.
 So I know you are going to joy hearing from David.
 All right, David Campbell.
 Welcome back to the show.
 I am pleased to be here.
 You and I have known each other.
 How long have we known each other?
 Well, well over 20 years.
 And we would have met through John and Carol.
 Yeah.
 in Toronto. Our dear friend, we were just talking about over breakfast, John Arnett,
 who's influenced both of us.
 Phenomenally, probably more than we can.
 I mean, I got a wife out of it.
 I don't know what you got out of the relationship, but
 I had to add a wife, so it was okay there.
 But yeah, you're one of our dearest people, both AJ and I, but also to our
 community here at Grey Center.
 Everyone loves when you come.
 Great.
 And you love coming here.
 I mean, it's one of my favourite churches
 with some of my favourite people here.
  </li><li>What is it?
 I mean, you seem to have an affinity
 and I love for America anyway, which I understand.
 I mean, I love it so much, I move to here.
 But what is it that you love about being here?
  </li><li>Well, I think, well, I love it here.
 Apparently, Jeff and Becky Dallers,
 with the atmosphere where they've created the churches
 and the church and the great center.
 But it just seems to honour the Holy Spirit so much
 in the father heart of God,
 and they're ready to move.
 You know, but God moves in the service.
 They're ready to go with them.
 I don't see that everywhere.
 And then just to keep finishing well,
 you know, it's not that hard to start well.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You don't need a lot of effort to start well,
 but to keep going and keep going on well and be faithful.
 That shows what the real character of somebody is.
  </li><li>One of the things I love about them
 is not only the good at moving with the Holy Spirit,
 they're also good at pausing with the Holy Spirit.
 Like, you know, I have watched Jeff,
 not endure, but like, in his effort
 to honor the Holy Spirit, shut everything down,
 just pause and wait, which is a hard thing to do.
 Like you'll know, like, 'cause people are looking
 at you as a leader going, come on,
 let's make something happen.
 He's like, without the Holy Spirit,
 I can't make anything happen.
  </li><li>I love that.
 I think sometimes it teaches more courage
 to do nothing than to do something.
 And I see there's no such thing as doing nothing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Nothing, that's not possible.
 Making space is what you're doing,
 but people call it doing nothing.
 You're making space for God to do something.
 and it's having the courage to do that.
 Because if you make space and nothing happens,
 people blame you for nothing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But actually you weren't making nothing,
 you're making space.
 And I find it turns up, you know.
 I find it turns up.
  </li><li>People are listening to people probably already tell
 from your Dalset tones that you're from Alabama.
 Which part, I forget which part of Scotland you're from.
  </li><li>I'm from the Glasgow side,
 the town called Greenuck.
  </li><li>The Land of the Great on Wash.
  </li><li>Yeah, so this is a night sentence,
 not an impediment, it's a night sentence.
 How have you not lost your accent being in England all these years?
 I'm not sure. I think quality just sticks with you through your life.
 That seems to be what happens really. I'm not trying.
 When you hear me speak Dutch and American to you,
 or can you hear any trace of my Scottish?
 There's a little bit of a trace, but keep it from the wrong side of Scotland,
 anyway, if I remember.
 Yeah.
 From the Edinburgh side, it's a softer accent.
 But still there a bit. The look still there.
 I just in that you flew in last night just in the 24 not even 24 hours that we've been talking the expressions that I've forgotten that are native to Scotland the the terminal we were talking about people reaching out. Hey, I'm just I saw you reach out to me. You're like, give me reach out to me. You made a phone call.
 Exactly. I find young people today. They don't speak English anymore. It's thanks for reaching out to us. You didn't you phone me and reach out to know. But it's just.
 Yeah, it's a literalism.
 It's an interesting language.
 One of the things, and I'm really like telling myself here, but people who've
 listened to me long enough will very quickly realize that a lot of the stuff I
 say I've liberally borrowed from you because you're like Bill, like Bill
 Johnson, you got the King of some one liners.
 Yeah.
 You've got some that have really stuck with me.
 What like one of my favorites, and I might be butchering them.
 But if you only believe the part of the Bible that you like and you don't believe the part of the Bible you don't like,
 you don't believe the Bible you believe yourselves.
 Exactly.
 It concisely summarizes a lot of the problems I'm seeing, and I've used that so many times.
 Or if you're too big to serve, you're too small to lead.
 Yeah.
 That encapsulates a whole lot of principles in one's ends.
 I think if you can sort of look at something and almost just summarize it quickly,
 It makes a lot of sense, it's memorable.
 It's short and more at the point, and the more pointed it is, the deeper it goes.
 I think sometimes people waffle around the subject, and if somebody says it directly,
 you think, "Yeah, I know what you mean now."
 It's easier to remember. I wrote down a list of them.
 What I thought we could play is a trip down Campbellism lane.
 I've got a bunch of Campbellisms, and I thought, "I'm going to read them back to you,
 and maybe you can expand on them. Okay. Did I work for you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
 There's nothing that's unforgivable. There are some things that are inexcusable.
 I think sometimes as a Christian, you feel under pressure to forgive everyone who's done all sorts
 of dreadful things to you. And so almost if you forgive them and you still feel something,
 well actually forgiveness isn't the same as saying that it's okay. What they did was wrong. If you
 were abused by somebody in the past, you can forgive them, but it didn't mean that you don't
 think is wrong or even that they shouldn't pay the consequences for that. So some things are
 inexcusable. I mean no excuses for this. I'm not saying you know it's okay they had a bad day.
 There's no it's inexcusable. There's nothing you can do to me that right but I can still forgive
 it because forgiveness has effect on me rather than them. So therefore I'm not going to stay
 up prison from what they happen because I rent space in my heart and mine to them for no reason
 and they may have done something dreadful to me. If I don't forgive them, they have an ongoing
 grasp into my consciousness. So forgiveness seems to cut that off, but it doesn't excuse what they did.
 There's two differences, hugely different forgiveness and being excusing some of these actions.
 Yeah, atrocious behavior too. Trust is a gift that's given, but if it's lost, it has to be built
 again unpack that for me. Sometimes that's so good I'm going to write them down myself again.
 You forget all those things but I think we should start from a place that we trust people.
 Right. And we give people the benefit of the doubt. And that's the gift. And I think that's
 the gift. We give that. Sometimes we give it because of the position, we give it because the
 testimony of the people, this is some I can trust. But when trust is broken, we're back to that.
 I forgive you, but that doesn't mean I now put you back to the level of trust I had you before
 I have found you to be faulty in the area I trusted you in and so if I sat in the chair and it broke
 And you said I've fixed it. I would be a bit more careful how I sat in that chair
 It's just in case for the first couple of times and it's so it's not the same if somebody
 Breaks trust they have to win the right to put it back in place again
 And so if somebody's broken trust and you forgive them they say you got to trust me now say no no no
 I'm giving you an opportunity to rebuild that trust. If you take it, we could get back to where we were, but if you don't, then no, no.
 And that's an important message that has the potential to break the cycle of abuse.
 Because you often see leaders, unhealthy leaders, let me qualify that, who would trade on the position rather than the trust.
 You know, like, "Hey, you actually need to submit to me, and I'm your leader, and you know, you should be trust me."
 That's what the Bible says.
 And what you're giving people permission to do is like, "Hang on, if they've not stewarded their trust well with you,
 they've got no right to think that's an entitlement."
  </li><li>Exactly. - Actually, the onus is on them to rebuild that trust.
  </li><li>Hmm. - And you trust them to deliver their ability.
 I mean, if somebody came and asked me, "I think they're buying a house,
 what do you think you're buying this house for?"
 Do you think, I'd say, "Go talk to a real estate person because I actually might trust me,
 I'm a clue what you're talking about.
 And just because you trust someone doesn't mean what they say is actionable.
 You can only trust you up to the level of ability.
 And so if someone's not able to keep the world in something,
 I can only trust them up to that level.
 How about this?
 Just because you've correctly identified the problem doesn't mean you've discerned the answer.
 Oh, that's huge.
 What's that come out of?
 Another one times I go in a situation and you find someone in a difficult situation
 they come and they say, "This is what the problem is. This, this, this, and this." You think,
 "Well, yeah, I know that. And so therefore we should do this." And because people think
 you've been good articulating where we're at, therefore the next thing that comes out your
 mouth is the answer. No, a blind man could tell you what's wrong with this situation. And so,
 just because you know what the problem is, you can say, "The problem of the Americans,
 this, this, and this, therefore we should do that." No. Yeah. No. How do you get to the answer then
 And from that, certainly identifying the problem is a good store in place to discern
 an answer.
 And I hear what you're saying that the same skill set is not required to diagnose a problem
 as to find it.
 What advice would you give us for solving problems that we've correctly identified?
 Again, we're back to the whole situation of where a registered skill set, one by role
 in leading leaders, is I put people who have got a problem and touch with people who have
 got the answers. So, partly to discern what the problem is, is important to me, because
 then I can point out to the person who has got the right answer for that situation. So,
 I am not undermining the need to discern what the problem is. But what I am saying is,
 is that they don't overestimate that as a value, because it just means absolutely nothing
 about what the answer is.
 And I find that because people don't think about problems,
 but if somebody tells you what the problem is,
 you just assume this guy knows what they're talking about.
 Well, maybe not.
 Right.
 Maybe they don't.
 Maybe they're just good at--
 maybe they have somebody else talking about it over breakfast.
 They have no idea of themselves.
 And you have to actually say, what's the--
 OK, but no, but the problem is there
 might be five different answers.
 Two of them might be good.
 Three of them might be disastrous.
 And so give me a suggestion and I think we have to make sure that we actually evaluate their ability to know the future rather than to summarize the present.
 So you lead what 200 churches? 140 churches.
 140 churches, right? So that's a bunch of leaders that you're leading.
 You're going to have your fair share problems because churches are made up of people.
 That's the problem. Church without people. It's not so bad.
 How do you, like when you look back on the problems you've helped troubleshoot and solve,
 do a pie chart for me? Where's the answer come from? I mean, obviously you want it to come from
 God, but how much is it coming from experience? How much of it is coming from outside council?
 How much of it is coming from word of wisdom? Like in your experience, how would you say your
 strength is in finding solutions? Where does it come from? I've never thought of that. I think
 I think one of the biggest things is,
 if you learn to come alongside people,
 I think it's almost,
 the approach sometimes to tell me the destination.
 If you come approach with an aggressive,
 I'm gonna sort this problem out.
 Your destination were a big fight.
 And who wanted to go there?
 And so one of my biggest things is that I don't see
 my leadership as being the policeman
 to sort of make people keep the rules.
 I see myself as a coach.
 So I come alongside saying,
 Now you don't want to be doing that, that's not good for you.
 Now don't go out training five times a day, do it three times.
 Or I see go out three times, not once every three days.
 And so my idea is that folks realize I'm on their side.
 And that's the other thing is we're all on the same side.
 And I've never get involved in situations.
 I have a couple of things to try to bear in mind.
 One, we're on the same side.
 And two, usually there's no bad people involved.
 It's just a bad situation.
 And so I think the biggest thing I bring is an attitude that says,
 we're in this together, your problem's my problem,
 we have a problem, we have a difficulty,
 and get the ego out the way.
 Stop thinking, let's get it right around them,
 be proved right.
  </li><li>It probably helps that you are a very calm person,
 like I haven't seen a lot of stuff rattle you.
 So like you're not easily shaken.
  </li><li>Not on the outside.
  </li><li>Or either inside, do you feel it?
  </li><li>Sometimes, yeah.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Sometimes I think I can get stressed,
 I don't get that stress.
 I mean, one of my friends once described me,
 "Is the day comes a sort of person
 "he's preaching and a bomb goes off and they screw him."
 And we'll say, "I'll just finish this point
 "and never go see what that was."
 And I'm a bit like that, really.
  </li><li>You are?
  </li><li>And my wife's like, "Mandy, my wife, she loves that.
 "The thing she loves most about me
 "is that I don't panic in a situation."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the thing that she hates most about me
 is that I don't panic in a situation.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You think you just not take it seriously, you know?
 You know, that poster would say something like,
 If you can keep your head, pull all around, you are losing theirs, you just do not understand the situation.
 Right.
 And I think I'm a bit like that, really.
 Right.
 Because I think panic's the last thing you want to do when you need to keep your logic about you.
 Yes, because worry does not equal care.
 No.
 And that would be one thing I've noticed about you.
 The other thing I've noticed about you is you don't seem to have an ego in terms of being
 the person who has to have the solution or the answer.
 Is that true?
 I don't know really, I don't think about that sort of thing, maybe that's just like,
 but I did hear a story about the man and church who they gave him a little pen that said the most
 humble man in the church. They had to take it off because they wore it every week and I think,
 so that's that sort of question, if you see I'm going to go Eagle. But I think, I don't think
 it's something that I would identify, but I think partly because I get my enjoyment,
 I've seen other people enjoying themselves. And so if you're wired that way, then actually
 in a sense my ego if that's such a thing is built up by seeing other people fulfilled
 situations comes. And as John Arnott told me, you know, you want to go more for influence
 than prominence. And in fact, he said to me one thing I like with David is you value
 influence over prominence. And I thought I didn't know I did, you know, until he told
 me. I think that's true. I don't like care. I rather things are done right. My job is
 in an earth is to get the right things done release people best. And that's enough fulfillment
 for me. I don't really.
 That would be a pretty good definition of having no ego.
 Yeah, but I don't like being.
 But then your resume.
 Yeah, I don't like being dragged up.
 You're probably getting publicly thanked and you're like, I don't like all that.
 I find it embarrassing. I don't.
 So in a sense, it's I don't die to self every day.
 I think that's the two I am.
 I just tell them why I would really.
 But I think my observation would be that that whatever you want to call it,
 I would call that low ego, but also that you, you know, you bring peace.
 you're not easily rattled.
 Those two things must lower the anxiety in the room
 when it comes to troubleshooting problems.
 I think, you know, the Bible doesn't say blesses
 the peacekeepers.
 It's as best that peace makers,
 you have to work at having peace.
 Yeah.
 I don't think it comes naturally.
 No, it doesn't.
 And sometimes, but sometimes it's not that hard.
 Sometimes it's quite as let it go,
 it's telling a joke or just saying somebody,
 how's your wife, how's your kids, and let bring people out
 at a human level and I don't let it escalate.
 So I think peacemaking is easier than we think.
  </li><li>You haven't managed to condense us
 in acute little phrase yet, but the principle is so important.
 You were talking about sometimes in conflict,
 we focus on the wrong thing.
 Can you unpack that?
  </li><li>Something about going to a situation,
 and say I've got a big board fighting amongst itself.
 My question sometimes is, so what happened?
 Because I remember five years ago, you guys were all great friends.
 And so you present this problem to me and I have to sort that.
 And we have a problem.
 But actually five years ago, you just sorted this out over a cup of coffee.
 Today, you're calling me and it's sort of a problem.
 So what happened?
 And you find out that maybe the friendship went wrong four years ago,
 they fell out, although partners fell out with each other.
 And actually, I cannot resolve this problem.
 and just say, "I'll make the decision," and that's that sorted.
 But actually, that's not the problem,
 but what happened--
  </li><li>Tom's way back there.
  </li><li>He's way back then.
 So let me, this actually, this problem,
 we can sort any time, but we'll have another one at this
 to a couple of years' time, unless I find it what happened.
 I mean, he's been healing to that relationship,
 'cause relationship's the most important thing.
 If I can get that relationship healed,
 we'll be able to cope with somebody having a different
 opinion, and you give that benefit to the doubt.
 What happens?
 When you start almost, soon somebody says something,
 you take the worst possible mean out of it.
 You're on your way downhill very fast.
 'Cause if you know something, you love them, think,
 now you even are meant to do that.
 Even if you said it, that's not what you would have meant.
  </li><li>That's not who I know them to be.
  </li><li>And so I go back to sort of what happened.
 And that's, longevity of relationship helps.
 So in my role, I've been doing it for 20 years.
 So a lot of these pastors, I put them in
 as the pastor of that church.
 I've set the elders in place.
 I know all those things.
 I've got more than two decades of looking after them.
 And that helps.
 And I know there's no bad people.
 And I said, I think they'll often bring any situation
 that I think there's no bad people.
 And sometimes I sit around a table
 where there's a bit of warring factions.
 I said, let's just say first thing,
 there's no bad people here.
 And I see a couple of people going,
 "Okay, think, ah, okay."
 You think there is a bad person here.
  </li><li>Hey, your teller's showing.
  </li><li>Yeah, I can tell.
 That's why it's better than Zoom.
 I mean, Zoom, you can always jump up.
  </li><li>You miss out on that stuff.
  </li><li>You miss out on that little twig.
 And I just think, so what happened?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so the people that flinch us,
 so what happened to make you think that?
 Because I know you, you're not a bad person.
 I know him, he's not a bad person.
 And so I refuse to take sides.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think sometimes you respect like you.
 I always think with Joshua,
 and it meets the,
 the angel of the Lord with a big sword.
 And he runs towards them, I think, wow, wow.
 And that's quite a decision, isn't it?
 Because it's almost like, you know,
 a part of edX and policemen and firemen,
 they run towards the problem,
 everyone else runs away.
 It's Josh, who's the leader, he runs towards them and says,
 so who's side are you on?
 There's our hours.
 He says, no, no, I'm not on the other side.
 I'm not even on your side, but you could be on my side.
 And it's not going, people say,
 I'm not coming on your side, I'm on the side of what's right.
 Do you want to come with me?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And let's all be on this side,
 because I'm not taking sides,
 because I'm on the Lord's side,
 You come and so we can't divide like that.
 There's not an option, but on God's side, up and off.
  </li><li>There's a lot packed in at one of these one-liners,
 isn't there?
  </li><li>As it would turn out.
  </li><li>Seben's series of both of them, really.
 I should be charging by this.
  </li><li>By the word.
  </li><li>This consultancy fee right here.
  </li><li>We're called to be examples, not an exception.
  </li><li>I think called to be examples, not exceptions,
 huge for me.
 'Cause I think sometimes as leaders,
 if you're not careful, you can preach things
 and not do it yourself.
 It's very easy to do this.
 I find I've found pastors that don't tithe.
 I've found treasures that don't tithe.
 And people who teach it and say,
 you know, you have a big offering,
 they don't put much in it.
 And then so I think, because they've got a reason to be nice.
 I've got meetings, I forgive me,
 passing it up, set up this, but I've been in meetings now.
 No, I'm not leading the church off in the meeting to say,
 just getting a group, three or four of you,
 and pray together, they don't go in a group.
  </li><li>Wow. - They stand on the platform
 and they chat to the musician or they just want to run.
 Excuse me, excuse me.
 Can you get in a group please?
 'Cause I actually find it really embarrassing.
 You can, although I'm quite a public person on the platform,
 I'm quite shy really.
 Remember, a natural person outside my gifting is to be,
 you won't find me sent of attention at a party.
 I'll be sitting on the edge with other people.
 That's where I prefer to be.
 And so, when they say, go talk to these three people
 you know, Matt, before and pray with them,
 your deepest secrets.
 And I think, but you're not doing it.
 Right. So you're telling me what to do, but you're not being an example.
 You're being an exception.
 And I think the best way to decipher people is to live the life and let them
 copy you. And so you've got it.
 It's ever so important that you don't find the excuse not to do what you've
 just told everybody else to do.
 Wow. Your leaders must love you or hate you.
 Most of them do.
 I see because part of my, I am used a lot to go and resolve problems.
 My wife always says, "Mandy says, 'How can you go into these people and both sides end up loving you?'
 I don't really know. I think it's been 6-3, and big. People don't want to take you on really, so there's only a friend that's born out with you.
 It's about advantage, a tower over people. I just threaten to sit on them.
 I mean, you're never too spiritual to take the trash out. Almost speaks for itself. It's very similar to if you're too big to serve, you're too small to leave.
 too small to leave. My 11th commandment is though shall not take
 thyself too seriously. And I just think, you know, if you cannot
 connect with the real world, then we don't need you. Right. You
 really haven't got all here. And some people just think, I'm too
 spiritual to do this. And you never too spiritual to put the
 chairs out, right? And to help pick rubbish up off the floor
 and do things like that. Who? It says, again, about being
 an example, not an exception. Right. But if you have to be
 taught, say, Oh, I'll do that because people are watching me.
 No, that's not what we're after.
 But after sort of keeping your heart right,
 seven-hearted people don't have to be told to serve.
 Mm-hmm.
 Sometimes they have to talk to stop for a minute and take a rest.
 But seven-hearted people do it because it's natural.
 They haven't thought about it.
 I'm going to put these two together.
 They're the two separate ones, but I think they're two sides of one coin.
 Different is not wrong and always wear your own clothes.
 Unpack those for us.
 Well, first one definitely is not wrong.
 Sometimes there's more than one right answer.
 And often they're going to be a big situation after a certain,
 "You want this and you want that."
 They're both right.
 They're going to have to decide which right answer we go for.
 And you may have to diet yourself for this.
 Somebody may have to just give away.
 And that's when you can't please all the people over the time.
 But use is not that big.
 And so I think just because somebody's different to you,
 doesn't mean the wrong.
 the wrong. Just because somebody's a Calvinist and you're not, doesn't mean they're wrong,
 you're right. Because if you start going into attitudinal areas, you can be right, but be very
 wrong in the way you go through it. And so just because somebody's different, you believe the
 right things for the wrong reasons. And I think be different, you're just different, they're not
 you spelt the same, they're nothing like each other. Yeah. What's the other one I can't remember?
 The other one was, is always where your own clothes. I sort of think about that is David,
 you know, but he goes to where it's so close. Well, why would you want to do that?
 And I think sometimes that comes when there's an insecurity about who you are in yourself.
 and David knew who he was. So it's almost like I can imagine him in front of Saul wearing his
 armour and thinking I've got the king's armour and putting on it. The truth is if the armour is
 that fantastic, why didn't Saul wear it and go and fake your life? If the armour makes a difference,
 then the soul wear it, don't know David wear it, and it's not the armour, it's the man inside
 that makes a difference. And so you might as well be wearing clothes. David, when you thought the
 the line in the beer, you don't have armour on then, you won't need on now. And I think
 one of the things which helped is he won because it's who you are when nobody's watching,
 who you really are. I mean David could have taught light, souls, you know fighting
 bears and killing lines and well if he's making himself some better he's gonna die today.
 Right.
 Because Goliath will kill him.
 Yeah.
 And so he had a history of secret victories.
 And whereas many people, they don't want to fight Goliath because they've got a history of heading defeats
 because what people think, there's not what they are really.
 And I think David could wear his own clothes, be himself and that would be enough.
 And I think it's because if you read the story with David, everyone's intimidated by Goliath,
 but David says, you know, I'll come against you the name of the Lord.
 And his brother's due offense because he was challenging them.
 David took offense because he's challenging God and he almost says, you know,
 it was him that said, I'll be back because I wear my own clothes and he came close in the righteousness
 of God and he won. So just be yourself. I think we said earlier, while we're going with it,
 you might as well be yourself because all the other options are taken.
 Who else you want to be? Like somebody said, I want to always want to be somebody, but yeah,
 somebody make it something good. Continue on the theme of problem solving right?
 You said that some problems don't have solutions because there are tensions
 that need to be managed. I think they live in the world where everyone looks
 for a quick solution for everything you know. Phone up we'll give you an answer
 of the phone I've got an expert and everything but some some problems I'm
 got an answer some things are tensions you're always going to have to barry
 if you're married you must know that some things you know you have to test
 straightforward answer to any problem. You're going to have to manage the tension, like
 the tension between same church, modern songs and traditional hymns. You don't say, right,
 we're only good from board, we're only good. You can't. You have to have the tension. I've
 got a group here who like this, I've got a group here like that. I'm going to have to
 manage the tension, which means both groups are going to have to have a lot of grace,
 a lot of kindness towards the other, because there's not an answer to this problem. It's
 always going to be a tension but it can be a creative tension and creative
 tensions create things don't they so so you have to be careful that you don't
 think everything's got an answer and sometimes when I get caught in a problem
 they say what's the answer I say I don't think there is one not one answer
 there's five answers and none of them are great and sometimes I end up saying to
 people this is my least bad option wow I'm not sure there's a great option
 We're in a mess here and done them with my nice.
 None of the ways forward are good.
 But the least bad option of probably is this that we do this now.
 Because different perspective.
 Because people aren't living a pain-free world.
 You know, take this tablet and you're paying me gone two hours.
 No, it won't.
 No, it won't.
 It'd be livable for a couple of hours.
 But it will be back in the morning.
 So you can't have to manage this long term.
 And short term solutions, exactly that.
 They're short term, but they're not the solution.
 and they might solve it and take your mind off it for a little bit period of time.
 But you have to actually put a coping mechanism that deals with the tension of the problems,
 that appreciates the other side. And actually, maybe you can move a little bit of room for yourself
 and you manage that tension as you move along. It might just be one way or the other.
 It's time goes on, but it's a tension that has to be managed.
 I love this one. And I wish I came up with it. And I'm going to give you credit once,
 and then I'm going to claim it after that series.
 Yeah. I think acceptance and approval are two very different things.
 I think that's huge for me because I think it's one of the things I live my life
 on really because I think today's society is almost even particular groups of people
 say unless you approve of everything I do, then you have to reject me.
 Right. You're not accepting me.
 Accepting me.
 Yeah.
 And you can understand maybe why they are that.
 But I see I think you've not understood the love of God really.
 Because as a Christian, I accept and love people who do things that I do not approve of.
 I've had my own family. One of my daughters, she wasn't really, she struggled a bit. She
 came a single mum. I didn't approve of some of the things that she did, but we never stopped
 accepting her. And she was, her testimony, I know she's back with the Lord, we'd be saying,
 she always knew that our daddy loved her and our mum loved her and we accepted it. And she knew
 Newbie didn't always approve.
 So acceptance and approval are not the same thing.
 Neither should it be made to make a choice.
 If you're going to approve me of me,
 you have to accept everything I do.
 Approval is a lot smaller than acceptance.
 Love is huge.
 I love people who do things I don't accept.
 I don't approve of.
 And then God's like that with us too.
  </li><li>Of course.
  </li><li>He loves to accept.
 Didn't mean he approves everything I do or don't do.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so it's almost, if you understand the love of God,
 bigger than all those things. Well, it's beautiful as well because my
 acceptance can't be threatened by my behavior. Like the Lord just accepts me.
 Even of course he doesn't approve and he gave Jesus to make up for that gap.
 There's nothing you can do that stop God loving you. But I think you can do to
 stop your feeling that love. And so all the barriers are on our side. All the
 barriers to stop was receiving the love of God at this side of heaven, not that
 side and so God goes always for all these love is up to us whether we
 open up and receive it or not. This one is not your one. It's your mother's.
 Oh right. But it's brilliant. Yeah. Half a truth is a whole lie.
 I always say to them this isn't in the Bible because my mum told me but if my mum had lived
 in Bible times it would be in the Bible now because often your mother tells you things
 you think that's so good and she would say to me half a truth is a whole lie.
 So if I tell you half the story, I don't tell you anything, it's not true.
 Right.
 I tell you half the story and I tell you half of the truth, you go away believing something
 is not true.
 That's the sins we tell in your lie.
 The half the truth is a whole lie.
 And it comes back to what is the definition of truth because Jesus says you know the truth
 and the truth will set you free.
 So if I tell you half the truth, it doesn't set you free, it's not the truth.
 Right.
 and truth of two different things, things that are factual are not necessarily
 truth yet. So there may be fact, there is a fact, I am a sinner deserving of hell.
 That's a fact. I can do nothing but that. It doesn't make me feel great.
 Sounds a set me free. So it's not half a truth. The other half is I am a miserable
 sinner deserving of hell who Jesus died in the cross for to pay for my sin and
 I'm forgiven now and I've been given his righteousness and I'm looking forward
 to spend eternity with them. Now that's the truth, and that says to be free. And so the
 whole truth will set you free, half the truth will lie, and it belongs to like, here's
 another quote, I didn't agree with this one, there's two fathers in the Bible, and there's
 Father in heaven, and Jesus says there's a father of lies, and the father of lies tells
 you half the truth, but the father of heaven tells you the whole truth, and it says to
 you free.
 How about this one? Preach from your scars, not your wounds.
 Yeah, explain that.
 When I say preaching your styles, not your wounds often,
 but if you're in pain and people ask you a question,
 you will give a painful answer.
 It will reflect both what you asked,
 then Anthony helps.
 But don't share then.
 I find a number of times when people
 who are going through a real hard time and say,
 "I want to get through this so I can help other people."
 I say, "Well, when you through it, you will."
 But don't do anything there.
 At the moment, you're not even helping yourself.
 Right.
 You're not even thinking logically.
 You can't see it.
 But there's almost a desire of,
 I know I'll be well enough to help other people,
 but you're not there yet.
 And when you share, you just share your pain
 and your perspective is probably a little bit unrealistic.
 But perhaps when you look back on the same situation,
 and that, 'cause if you touch a wound, it's sore,
 but you touch a scar, it's not.
 But it reminds you of the previous pain.
 And you can talk about an object away
 and a way that helps you through that situation.
 So you wait until the situation that caused your pain
 is a scar because you still got the memories of it, but you've got the objectivity to be
 able to talk about it and maybe apply to somebody else's life. So talk from your scars, not your
 wounds. It's too early to talk about things from your wounds. It might even push the wound
 a little bit deeper and make you even pain for longer.
 And we've probably all been on the receiving end. Hopefully we've been receiving end of
 people who've talked from the scars. Like I remember the first time I heard AJ, I literally
 could not reconcile the woman in front of me who is radiant with the love of God telling
 her testimony of the most horrific pain, abuse and abandonment.
 I'm like, how is that possible preaching from her scars?
 But then similarly we've listened to people who are going through it and by faith they're
 saying they're going to get healed.
 But all it is is kind of like a toxic group therapy that we didn't agree to.
 I was just some pastors and they tell me about that.
 I think I wasn't depressed before I came out in the church but I definitely depressed now
 I think. Where's the victory? Where's the power?
 Because you're not through it yet. You're not through it yet.
 It's not denial. See there's a thin line of hypocrisy. I've just seen,
 now I'm smiling, God's good is on the throne. I'm not going to tell you about my problems.
 What is it appropriate to talk about this?
 What is hypocrisy is to pretend you never had a scar in your life.
 Right. And that but what's common sense is to wait until the wounds are healed enough to be
 open up and talking about it. And so I'm not saying you should never talk about the hard things in
 life. The opposite is the truth. We're must, you must declare ourselves human, preachers have
 got to declare ourselves human because sometimes you think they're the only people who haven't got
 problems. I mean, here's what I'm not giving you but I do know this that sometimes it's easy to appear
 as a pastor, as a preacher, as if you could go problems in your life.
 And my wife, man, you used to have people come up to him saying,
 "It must be wonderful being married to somebody like David. He's wonderful."
 I didn't even understand them thinking that. I thought, "That was great."
 I thought, "I could see where you got that from."
 But it said, "Man, it's a bit like this."
 They all think you married Superman, but you know when I get home on Clark Kent.
 Right.
 And so we're not, we're not realized, but we have to let people know.
 I'm actually, I've never been Superman.
 Right.
 I don't think I'm even up to Clark Kent, to be honest, because that's who I am.
 And the big plus in that, if you don't try and live up to being Superman, life's a lot easier.
 I've been introduced as a speaker and they've said such amazing things.
 I've had to actually put a disclaimer on saying, "Well, whoever that preacher is, it sounds great, it's not me, this is me."
 He's not here today.
 I can't do that, I can't do all those sort of things.
 Most gardens are not attacked by the devil, but neglected by the gardener.
 Well, that's been sort of trying to say, sometimes, ducking personal responsibilities
 are very easy to think you do.
 Especially when you've got a big bad devil to blame it on.
 Yeah, it's not my fault.
 I can remember this film called 'It's a LeCouze Talkings' where a man gets this woman pregnant
 and she has a baby, but she goes to see him to try and get, I think, him to take responsibility
 for the baby.
 And he actually says through it, it's classic.
 Something that I said, "I'm seeing a councilor
 "and he says I'm just going through a very selfish stage
 "and stuff that I can do about it."
 And I have to think, I love that.
 I think how many people could hide behind that?
 I said, "I don't have to be able to help.
 "I'm just going through it.
 "It's just one of those things."
 No, it's not.
 You take a bit of responsibility and deal with it yourself.
 And the reason you're gardening is in the message,
 'cause you've not dealt with it or sorted out.
 And we yourself that story about the devil standing outside
 church crying and Pastor Grommett said, "What's wrong with you?" He says, "They've
 bled me for everything in there." And I think it's so easy. I can sin without the devil.
 I haven't got legions of demonic activity attacking me every day. I've got the flesh
 to deal with. I'm not actually up high enough in the pecking order to get some arch demons
 coming after me. I can do that on my own. And I think if I keep a clean garden, the
 King will walk in amongst its spell the roses.
 What you just said, ties in with another Campbellism. You can't cast out the flesh, you have to
 crucify it.
 Yes.
 So similar.
 As people obviously say, it's not my fault. I'm just demonised. Well, not really. I told
 you stories to one this lady. She told me every big name in England she'd been to for
 deliverance and they couldn't get the demon out of her and come at me. I think, "Oh, I'm
 glad you got rid of me eventually." You know, so much to go down the list and stuff.
 But more or less saying you're going to fail but have a go if you like about it.
 And this might sound terrible but I'm sorry but it's just the thing I said to I said
 well I actually to be honest I pray for you but I don't think you got a demon I think
 you just are not your lady.
 And that's the truth of this I said you haven't got a demon you just very naughty you got
 to stop it and crucify the flesh.
 And I think it's so easy just to say it's the devil made me do it.
 No he didn't.
 No, you were a willing conspirator in this sin. You didn't have to push you very hard at all. Right.
 And so we got to say, well, you take responsibility for who you are because that's that's what Jesus he he actually
 When you get filled the Holy Spirit, you don't become a Holy Ghost puppet
 He gives you your mind back. So you can think remember the Ganderine de Moniac the guy who's full of demons
 He actually says later on he was found at the feet of Jesus and clothes in his right mind
 And he actually says to Jesus, "Let me go with you."
 And I'm going to say that, be great,
 great testimony, you'll be well known,
 that would be fantastic.
 Jesus says, "No, you're not coming with me."
 And it's almost as if he's saying,
 "I used to be controlled by demons.
 "Now I want you to control me, tell me what you do."
 And Jesus says, "No, you go and be under control
 "on your own now."
 And Christians are not people who are puppets on the string,
 they're people who God's given the ability to think
 by yourself in a godly way.
 I don't know why this part on my head, but another one of my favourite phrases of yours is weird Christians were weird non-Christians.
 I think, obviously. But you see a weird Christian you think, "Yeah, this is the improved version you've seen."
 Because before the Christians are even more weird than that, and this is just seen what they've been like at the hand good saved.
 And weird is not the whole spirit, it's just us, damn.
 No, it's not the prophetic spirit of all.
 No, could we please get rid of that?
 And there's no more in the church.
 Yeah.
 Oh, again, it's amazing how many of these are all linked together through wisdom.
 One of the other things that you said,
 lordship is made possible by choice, not experience.
 Yes.
 And since it's with it's almost, you think, if people have a huge experience of God,
 and then you go off and said and you think, what happened there?
 It's because lordship is not an experience.
 It's how you respond to night's beings by a decision.
 And the Bible doesn't say, "Believing Jesus, you'll be saved."
 It doesn't say that.
 They believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and you should be saved.
 And that's to do with a submission of the will.
 That's to do with Him being the king and stepping back.
 At the time of Jesus, you didn't have borders where you said,
 "This is where I go. This is where I live.
 This is where I've just gone from America and the Canada.
 There's no borders."
 But you'd ask in the village of the town you ended up in,
 Which king do you bear here?
 And by top which king the bear you knew whose kingdom you were in and actually that's when you find out which kingdom do I live in?
 Is what which kingdom I are being right choose this day whom you'll serve huh?
 It's a choice and so thinking who do I choose to be and so it's made possible by the choice
 It's like you know
 We've seen people overcome by the Holy Spirit and land the ground for hours.
 You think, wow, that's amazing.
 And then you find out the go off and sin.
 Think, how could that happen?
 We all ask those questions, but it's because they've had an experience, but they didn't
 choose to build it into their lives.
 Right.
 You think about the disciples.
 Judas had the same experience as all the other disciples, and he chose not to be under
 the Lordship.
 The experience in the encounter didn't make a difference.
 They had an opportunity.
 That's what comes to an opportunity to play the Lordship of Jesus.
 Some take it, some don't.
 Nothing wrong with the experience.
 The weakness is always going to be humanity.
 This one is so out there.
 Is it?
 No, it's great, but devoid of context might be confusing.
 So the answer to who it is is more important than what it is or why it is.
 Mm.
 Give us some context and tell us why that makes sense.
 That was to do with Acts chapter two.
 just imagine you're a new Christian, just got saved, the resurrection of Jesus, their
 porters are meeting every day for prayer, a lot of prayer meetings. And so you walk
 into church and I guess like every new convert you've got someone who has answered the questions
 for you and you're just sitting there at a party, standing there actually and in the
 prayer meeting the whole place is shaking but nobody runs out. I mean if you're in the
 San Andreas fault you might have run out of church then but there didn't move so there's
 some supernatural, nobody's afraid.
 And that's an interesting sign itself.
 But you sort of think, okay, well,
 I'll ask the pastor, but at the end of the meeting,
 so he's like, hold your finger.
 All right, what was that about?
 And next thing you know,
 suddenly there's fire that comes across.
 I mean, you would notice that.
 I mean, you would notice that.
 And rest on top of people's heads,
 there's tongues of fire thinking, my word.
 What is that about?
 And thinking, I'll ask him without that.
 And I'll ask what he's got there.
 Why? Where? What's that happening?
 So I suppose in the Bible, there was the ground being shaken
 when God moved, there's the fire, yeah, a lie, a fire.
 And the next thing you may, who is not the brightest pencil
 in the box, start speaking in French.
 I sound the French, anyway, and you're thinking,
 where do you learn that?
 And he's just worship away in French.
 You think that's really, really weird
 because speaking in tongues is not in the Bible until then.
 It's not in the Old Testament.
 You can't think of any way I put it's prophesy, I think.
 I really need to ask about that.
 Are we joined a cult or something, what's happening here?
 And so I'm gonna ask about the shaking, the fire,
 they speak the language.
 And then you notice that people who don't speak French
 are listening to what he's saying,
 they appear to be listening,
 they understood it in their own language.
 Now, you have to say, how come we hear
 in our own language, you think?
 But he's not speaking in your language,
 you think, that's really weird.
 I'm gonna ask about that.
 So before things are asked,
 I won't forget, I'm gonna ask about the shaking,
 I'm gonna ask about the fire,
 I'm gonna ask for the speaking foreign languages.
 I'm gonna ask for them here in a different language.
 And then Peter stands up,
 as I was sort of rabbinic greeting,
 but where he starts his preaching
 and he says, "Right good, he's gonna explain this.
 "He's gonna explain why, why, what, why, why."
 And he says, "This is that which is spoke
 "by the Prophet Joel.
 "In the last days I will pour out my spirit.
 "I will pour out my spirit."
 Now, it is, it doesn't say what, it doesn't say why.
 He says, "Before we're gonna thud,
 "I'll tell you who's doing this."
 Because when you know it's who,
 you're allowed to ask the questions,
 but you'll ask them in a much more respectful way.
 You ask them, it's more important to know who it is,
 once you know who it is,
 then you know who to ask the question to,
 and help you ask it.
 So the most important thing people say was,
 "This is God, folks.
 This is God, folks."
 I found that when we've had moves with the Holy Spirit,
 that people who didn't like it,
 asked the same questions as we asked,
 but with a different tone and a voice.
 We would say, "Well, how could somebody
 line the floor and then go up and commit adultery. I would ask that question, but there was
 a how could somebody almost like to set badness, be careful. I know who put mine the floor.
 But I also know if you went up and committed adultery, it wasn't Jesus that God would
 commit adultery. And so, so who's doing it? Very respectful. But who's doing it? And when
 you know it's God, you look at things differently in a more respectful way. I don't know how
 explain a lot in the life of Jesus too. Spit on the ground making mud. Where's that in your prayer?
 Handbook. I've never done that. I've never done that. It's one of the things that Jesus
 have not done. You're speaking of grace in on Sunday, first time for everything, David.
 That is, that is. If you can bring some mud in just in case somebody needs it, it's that way.
 David, I'm wondering if you would pray for our listeners who are listening today for,
 you know, one of the things you carry is this practical wisdom. Would you pray for an impartation
 for wisdom that helps us in our everyday life.
  </li><li>I love to do that.
 The big thing is don't take yourself to see us.
 God will show you.
 He actually wants you to get this right.
 He doesn't want you to fail.
 He wants you to get it right.
 And so when God's on your side, my goodness,
 you're not gonna fail.
 So we'll pray.
 Father, I thank you that you know everything
 from the beginning to the end and the bit in between.
 And I pray for every person,
 listen to this time that you speak deep into our hearts
 and that you would overflow us with your presence.
 Now, please don't leave this to us.
 Please don't leave us on our own.
 But rather, Jesus, you say you would never leave us.
 You would never forsake us.
 And they said, if any of us like a wisdom,
 let's ask of God who gives all things liberally.
 And we could freely confess our life
 and be freely graciously grappled
 onto your ample provision of all things wise.
 So I pray for a release of the wisdom of God,
 for specific situations for times of ministry,
 for all sorts of things that are coming into our lives,
 that we might see the wisdom of God
 triumphing in situations that will bring glory
 to the name of Jesus.
 Amen.
  </li><li>Amen.
 David, thanks so much for being with us again.
 Always a joy to have you with us.

 He's got so many one-liners.
 Yeah.
 I just have a file on my phone of all the one-liners that I've heard.
 And yeah, that was fun to be.
 Thank you, David, for doing that.
 Yeah.
 Give the fine people an adoption update.
 Okay.
 We've already seen money and we have been accepted by the large agency that we applied
 to.
 Which is taken weeks.
 Which is taken weeks.
 What should have been a rather straightforward process?
 Got a little tricky.
 Yeah, it was plagued by hiccups.
 That's a great way of putting it.
 But we've just actually received words today that we have been accepted by them.
 In general adoption agencies.
 Yes.
 Did I tell you about my dream this week?
 You did.
 Do you want to tell our listeners about your dream?
 I had a dream this week.
 that we had adopted two babies.
 I don't know if they're twins,
 but we had adopted a little baby boy
 and a little baby girl.
 And in the dream, there were an easy addition to her life.
  </li><li>Excellent.
  </li><li>Which sounds super sweet and naive.
 But the girl was called Rachel.
 And the boy's name, I knew the boy's name in the dream.
 I couldn't remember the boy's name when I woke up.
 But in the dream, they were expert feeders and sleepers.
 And it was no problem having to--
  </li><li>Amen, I receive it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Well, that's not recipe too.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I received the expert feeder and sleeper part of that.
  </li><li>So please continue to pray for us
 with our adoption journey.
 It is a journey and a half.
  </li><li>It's quite the journey.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we're just still waiting to be matched.
  </li><li>Yeah, in the last couple of weeks
 we've been a little bit discouraging.
 We were like, wait, hang on.
 This should be really easy,
 but it hasn't been, but anyway,
 I'm excited about what this means for us
 in terms of more options for our babies.
  </li><li>Wonderful.
