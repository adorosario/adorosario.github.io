<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones
 a j jones you resplend it display of glory.
 Thank you, darling.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 I'm slightly fueled on M&amp;M's.<br/>
 Oh, that's is it confession time?<br/>
 This should make for an interesting podcast.
 No, that sounded almost robotic.<br/>
 This should make for an interesting podcast.
 OK, this is my brain on M&amp;M people.<br/>
 How are you doing?<br/>
 I'm doing really well.<br/>
 Do you know that as we record as the Golden Globes are on?
 Really?<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Well, I didn't know that.<br/>
 Well, neither did I tell my New York Times app on my iPhone
 because I was telling me.<br/>
 So I could go downstairs and watch the Golden Globes
 after we're done this.<br/>
 Sure you can.<br/>
 But we don't have TV.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Well, watch all the best bits on YouTube tomorrow.
 Oh, well, it was nice that.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Tell me about this week.<br/>
 It feels like it's been a few weeks since we podcasted.
 And it's only been seven days.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 That's because we've packed in an awful lot this week.
 It's been a crazy week.<br/>
 Yeah, we had Ben and Sarah come from Toronto and stay and teach on the school and emanate.
 Yes, Sarah taught on dream interpretation in year one and then advanced dream interpretation year two.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I miss taking advantage of having an interpreter some of my dreams.
 Well, I mean, yeah, I don't often have dreams of me interpreting, but right after she left, I had one.
 So to be to be fair, I do think I've had my money's worth.
 So to speak, I'm pretty sure.<br/>
 Yes, she owes you nothing.<br/>
 Probably nice for it to come down and not be harassed with dreams.
 Sarah, sit down.<br/>
 I have many dreams for you.<br/>
 But that's usually what happens.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So Sarah Thomas School's Ben was just good looking and nerdy and talked to me about
 text off, which made my inner geek very, very happy.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then we made sure they were replete with cronuts.
 Yes, as long as you feed them cronuts, they're fine.
 I think they had.<br/>
 I think they had cronuts every single day.
 I tried to make sure that that happened.
 Yes.<br/>
 You're a very good host.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 And then Gray Center this morning, we had.
 Well, Jeff's been talking about generosity the last couple of weeks.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, it's not just generosity.<br/>
 The whole thing about breaking the poverty mindset.
 Yes, it's been an amazing series.<br/>
 It really has.<br/>
 It's really, really good.<br/>
 And we ended this Sunday with a massive offering that we took up.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then next week we're giving it all away to some surprise person or ministry.
 Ministry, yeah.<br/>
 And we've done this a couple of times in the past.
 I love it.<br/>
 It is tremendous joy.<br/>
 And it really does release something.<br/>
 You could totally feel the energy and the atmosphere and the service this morning.
 Yeah.<br/>
 You were watching from home.<br/>
 Could you tell?<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 Could totally tell.<br/>
 And just, oh, yeah, it felt amazing.<br/>
 I was kind of getting wasted in the kitchen.
 Oh, good.<br/>
 I mean, on the Holy Spirit, not on like port or anything.
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah, it was great.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Do you want to know our topic for this week?
 I do.<br/>
 It's actually inspired by Jeff's message.
 Oh, I want.<br/>
 I want to talk about the most disbelieved verse in the Bible.
 OK, now there's probably not a short list.
 There's probably quite a lot of disbelieved verses in the Bible.
 And by disbelieved, I mean, Christians that believe it, but don't do anything with it,
 thus proving they don't really believe it.
 Because they actually believed it.<br/>
 They do something with it.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And I'm lumping myself in that, by the way.
 That sounded very much like a me versus everyone else, but I'm preaching to the choir here.
 Yeah.<br/>
 The verse in question is we know it's the most disbelieved verse in the Bible because it has a warning against not believing it.
 It's Galatians 6 verse 7 says this,<br/>
 do not be deceived, God cannot be mocked, a man reaps what he sows.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yep. - Right there at the beginning.
 Don't be deceived. - Yep.
  </li><li>Like, don't be foolish.
 Don't, if you think you can get away with this thing not happening in your life,
 you're deceived.
  </li><li>Don't try and explain away God's laws.
  </li><li>Right.
 You've got to be careful with laws because as soon as you say laws, everyone's like,
 "Ah, but we're not under the law."
  </li><li>Right. - But that's not what you mean.
  </li><li>But that's not what I mean. - What do you mean?
 I mean, principles that the Lord has set up in Scripture that are for your blessing.
 Right.
 And these laws, which this one is one of, a couple, are really like a good parallel are
 the laws of physics that run our universe.
 Yes.
 The law of gravity, for example.
 Yes.
 So if I decide not to believe in the law of gravity, it's not going to help me at all
 if I jump off a building.
 Right.
 They're completely impartial laws.
 They don't require your belief to work.
 Yeah.
 She are completely indiscriminate.
 They don't just work for Christians.
 Like the law of gravity affects all people, all places, all times.
 And you can trick gravity into thinking that you've beaten it, for example, getting on
 an aeroplane and flying.
 But at some point, it really does really your life and what goes up does have to come down.
 I'm veering dangerously into topics in a very little of past elementary grade education.
 I'm not sure we want to talk about aerodynamics.
 No, let's go back to your way from that.
 Stepping backwards, tracing my steps back to the law of sewing and reaping.
 I'm pretty sure gravity is involved in keeping the thing in the air as well.
 I just want to say that.
 Okay, bad example, bad example.
 What happened to daddy while he got in a plane and floated off into nowhere?
 They're gone.
 Okay, so I'm just taking with what I know about it, which is this first.
 Yes, go back to the first.
 So it's an amazing verse really and it's absolutely designed like you said for our good.
 And in essence, it's whatever you sow from the same thing that you sowed you will reap.
 Not from the same thing that you sowed.
 The same thing that you sowed you will reap.
 Yeah.
 Because you kind of reap it from God, don't you?
 Oh, absolutely.
 Yeah.
 So if you, for example, if you sow honor in your life, you determine that you will reap
 honor.
 Right.
 You're gonna reap encouragement right if you so
 Financially you're gonna reap financially. It's funny how most of Christendom is fine with abstract concepts of song and reaping
 But as soon as we talk about finances people get really twitchy. You're talking about prosperity. Yes, I might be
 And a number of other things if you so friendship you'll reap friendship
 We've often said that there's two things we don't lack and one is encouragement and one is prophetic direction in
 part because we're constantly
 Encouraging and we're constantly prophesying over people.
 Right.
 I haven't actually thought about that, babe.
 That makes a lot of sense.
 Is your nose whistling?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Ladies and gentlemen,
 AJ's magnificent musical nostrils.
 That was just trying to figure out what was making that noise.
 Go on, make the noise.
 And it's my right nostril.
 I don't know.
 Ladies and gentlemen, a magical moment in this episode.
 If you hear like a little whistle in the background,
 it's just my right nostril.
 alright so what are we talking about?
 um you made a brilliant point about our life.
 okay that's right but how we don't lack encouragement and we don't lack prophetic
 revelation. yes. or direction because we're constantly giving away encouragement and
 constantly prophesying over people. i seriously had never put the two things together until
 just now. you are welcome baby. wow. the love song reaping like the love of gravity
 is also completely impartial it doesn't care if you believe it
 totally doesn't care if you're a christian or not it's a simple as whatever you put in you will get
 out correct and it's worth noting it is designed for your blessing but like everything the enemy
 will try and counterfeit it and use it for that so for example if you so judgment you will reap
 walk. If you sow criticism. I should have had more of it.
 So one of the good things to know is if you're having a hard time in life,
 it could be that you're reaping something that you've sown earlier.
 Yeah. Well, that's one of the things that we say when we're teaching on this at the school is,
 you know, show me what you're reaping and I'll show you what you're sowing.
 There's another verse built on this same principle.
 And if you read it in your Bible, it's written in red.
 It's from Luke 6 verse 38.
 You introduced me to a brilliant concept on this verse.
 I heard it first from you.
 The verse itself says this, "given it will be given to you.
 A good measure pressed down, shaken together and running over will be poured into your lap.
 For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."
 They're the words of Jesus, so you know he's not messing around.
 Can you remember the amazing revelation you shared with me once?
 I'll give you some M&amp;Ms if you get it.
  </li><li>Amazing revelation from this verse.
 Well, I think I said to you, so what is it?
 Whatever it is that you gave is what you'll receive.
  </li><li>So it is whatever you give.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So we put this to the test once in one time.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>We gave the mental list, well, not actually a mental list.
 We wrote it all down.
  </li><li>Yes.
 that we would watch us give stuff either prompted by the Holy Spirit or just prompted by us or
 just for fun. And we'd watch it be given back to us in extravagant ways.
 Yeah, you can't out give God. There was a time in my life where every single apple product I owned
 had been given to me. Yeah. I didn't buy any apple products for years. Yeah. Well, here's a
 a simple example. I remember one day at the end of the month, we had budgeted and we'd
 come in under budget and we had an extra $200, I think it was, with $200 un-budgeted. And
 so I said, "What do you want to do with it?" And you were like, "Let's give it to some
 friends of ours." So we sent them some money and just sent them a quick email saying, "Hey,
 we were thinking about you guys. We love you very much. We're so grateful for what you've
 done in our lives and the role that you play and we just wanted to send you out for a nice meal.
 Yes.
 Go bless yourself. You've impacted us. Yes.
 And so often it was great. It felt wonderful as it always does. And the point was we didn't
 give to get something we just decided to give because it's fun.
 Because it's fun. Yeah.
 However, the love, song, and reaping mandates that because we gave that it's going to be
 given back to us. Right.
 And so I think it was the same within a month, maybe it was in six weeks, we get a check
 for $1,000 from some of you we don't even know.
 And they said basically the same thing we sent an army mill to our friend.
 Hey, you've impacted me and my wife greatly.
 And you just want to send you something to say, thank you for what you've done.
 We were like, whoa, that's like a fivefold return.
 That's astonishing.
 So let's just start there with money that should offend some people.
 We've also given away stuff and received similar stuff in return.
 Like I remember at one point moving in Brazil, I gave away my iPod.
 Right. That was when iPods existed.
 Yeah, when iPods existed and iPhones didn't, iPhones came out a couple of months later.
 Right. We were in Brazil, you really want to give away your iPod.
 And in Brazil at that time, electronics were so expensive.
 well i don't i don't know if i say i really wanted to give it away i felt like the lord said to give it away and i was like i don't know how to travel as much as we do without my ipad.
 Where sorry with my ipod.
 But yes.
 So you give away then what happened to me i was giving an iPhone brand new first generation iPhone you were yeah couple months later i remember.
 predating that we again we budgeted and again we came up with some extra money so we were very good budgeting because every dollar should have its own job but that's another podcast for another time.
 What's the money left over and we thought of our friend who didn't have an iPod and that made it really sad because his kids had ipods but he didn't and he was an absolute music and apple nurse that's very sad we bought him an iPod.
 And it was an expensive one. I think it was the cheapest one available, but we just thought it would be really fun.
 It's what we could get.
 Yeah, we thought it would be fun to buy him an iPod, not tell him and just ship it to his house.
 Yeah.
 And so a couple of weeks later, he phones us and is squealing with excitement that he got an iPod.
 And then you're right. The very, well, I forget the timing, but immediately after that, I got given an iPhone.
 Yeah, you got yours first.
 I did.
 And then we went to Brazil.
 And then I gave away my iPod.
 And then I got back when we got back from Brazil around a couple months later,
 but two months later, I got given an iPhone.
 I love that.
 It's amazing.
 And I mean, we we know people.
 Well, I'll give an example.
 We know people that have sewn into us like stuff like they've said, oh,
 you know, I love your marriage.
 I want to sew into your marriage.
 I'm not married yet.
 and I want to sew into having a great marriage. I remember this sweet friend who brought us meals
 every Sunday night for, I don't know, six months or so. And in the process of that, she actually ended
 up meeting her husband. And now they're, you know, four kids down the road and, you know, doing
 fantastic. And I'm, you know, that's not going to be all just because they made us meals. I'm not
 saying that, but I'm just saying, you know, you sow where you want to go.
 And so that's what she could do.
 So she sowed what she could do and God did what he can do.
 I remember one time we sowed something and it wasn't something we wanted to sow,
 but we decided to do it anyway.
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 I'm talking about first class seats on airplanes.
 OK, so when we used to travel and we used to travel a lot, we used to learn the,
 the art of ensuring you had upgrades. So we'd always fly economy, we'd always buy economy
 tickets. But on a lot of the international legs, it just so happened that we flew so much
 that it would give us coupons that you could exchange for first class upgrades.
 Right. And there was a couple of tricks to that,
 aside from actually earning eligible status to get there. But once you even had that,
 you are competing with everybody else at the same level as you who's also hoping for upgrades.
 Right.
 And so on this particular occasion, we're flying from Toronto to London Heathrow.
 And we know that at the day of check-in, if upgrades haven't opened, they're going to
 go by status and we've got the highest status available.
 So that's fine.
 And if there's somebody else of the same status as you, the way they're going to decide who
 gets the seats is check-in time.
 So we get there super early, ready to check in.
 We don't care.
 We're going to sit in the lounge and we will get some breakfast.
 There's no big deal.
 So as soon as check-in is open, we physically check-in, go through security, we've got
 our seats in economy, we're really praying that there'll be an upgrade.
 I've already checked the airline computers and I can see that there are two first-class
 seats.
 Right.
 And as far as I know where the first people checked in.
 So we're in the lounge, we're enjoying some breakfast, we've got a couple hours before
 a flight takes off, we're just thinking this is great, I'm refreshing the page continually,
 to see if any first-class passengers have canceled. Nothing, nothing. Those two seats
 are still available. I'm thinking these are going to be ours. This is amazing. And who should we
 bump into in the lounge, but John and Carol? Despite the fact we live with John and Carol at that time,
 we didn't know that we were both flying to England. We flew so much that it wasn't a rare enough thing
 to mention it. It's like, you don't say to your friend, I'm going to go to the grocery store
 No kidding. I'm going to go to the grocery store. That's kind of what it was like.
 Right. And so we bump into them and they're as laid back as the all-bazaar.
 They give us a big hug and like, "Where are you going? Where are we going? Oh, we're going to London.
 We'll flight you on. Oh, you're on the 9am flight too. That's amazing. Hey, did you already get an
 upgrade?" And they're like, "No, we didn't get an upgrade. We didn't check in. It's fine."
 And so now I'm thinking, "Oh, I have this little thought that if we get upgraded, of course..."
 we're going to give away.
 Of course, the right thing to do is give them away to the people who've given us everything
 in life.
 Of course.
 Right.
 But at the same time, I don't want to sit in economy with the unwashed masses.
 I want to lie flat for you.
 Incidentally, is where we fly now.
 Yeah, we saw the judgment.
 We're reaping a judgment.
 Anyway, in the back of my head, I'm thinking, we should, we should, we should.
 But I know well enough not to shoot on myself.
 So we just say, Holy Spirit, of course, of course we're going to get, if we get upgraded,
 of course we're going to give away our seats to John and Carol.
 That's just please help my attitude.
 But absolutely.
 So in my heart, I had decided that we were going to sew our upgrade tickets.
 I keep refreshing in the hope that there's going to be four magical seats appear, but
 no, this too.
 So we go down to the gate, get ready to board the plane.
 And as I approached there, I asked, "Are there any upgrades?"
 And they're like, "Yes, you've been upgraded."
 And I'm about to say, "Okay, well, actually, I'd like to exchange seats with my parents."
 And at the same time, they page, "Mr. and Mrs. Arnott, please come to the desk."
 And they'd be upgraded.
 And so I was like, "Lord, you're so good.
 I gave it away in my head.
 You gave it back to me."
 And I got to sit next to some of my favorite people in the world on a first-class flight.
 Yeah.
 Very good.
 You can never go wrong in honor.
 Nope.
 I was just thinking, and so this is like a long, a long time away reaping of something
 that was sewn a long time ago.
 But when I was in my early twenties, I did a lot of free babysitting.
 And I didn't love babysitting, but I did love people who were married and needed time away
 to have that.
 And the finances not be prohibitive of that.
 You're so sweet.
 And so there are a couple friends and some pastors and stuff.
 I watched their kids while they went away.
 And my thought was, now we have people that are amazing that take care of our children
 are free as well.
 Oh, I'm so glad that you've sowed all those years because we seriously do reap the blessing
 of amazing people who watch our kids.
 We probably couldn't do, we definitely couldn't do what we do without the people who love
 our kids so well.
 We went through the season of playing hot potato that whenever we'd be given money, we'd
 give that money away immediately to some of the girls.
 And so we, yeah, we call it hot potato because you'd get money and then you'd give it away.
 And inevitably you'd get money again and you'd give it away.
 at some point, you just decide to tap out and let God win and keep money.
 And I remember one time we were ministering in Australia and halfway through the message,
 I saw a girl in the crowd and I just felt like the Holy Spirit said, I'd really like
 you to invest in her.
 Yeah.
 So I was like, all right, I didn't know what that meant.
 I didn't know if it meant give a prophetic word or whatever.
 Well, at the end of the service, somebody came up and put cash in my hand.
 I didn't even look at the cash.
 I just went over to my hosts and said, somebody just gave me this cash.
 I want you to go give it to that girl.
 Um, she doesn't need to know it comes from me, but I felt like the Holy
 Spirit said he wanted to invest in her.
 And so I just want to give that away.
 So I gave that money away to her.
 And as I leave the church, somebody comes up to me and says, I want to give you a
 thousand dollars.
 And I'm like, I'm tapping out.
 I'm tapping out.
 Yeah.
 But the old adage, my mom used to say this all the time.
 Everyone says this.
 It wasn't my mom saying, but you just can't I would give God.
 Right.
 But he'd like to see you try.
 Yes.
 There's genuine hilarity.
 There really is.
 Yeah.
 I think we're most like God when we're givers.
 Yeah, for sure.
 And the kingdom belongs to givers.
 So my question for our listeners is, what are you currently
 reaping that you'd like to stop?
 Yeah.
 In which case, check what you may have been sewing.
 And then what would you like to be reaping that you're currently not and start by sewing that?
 Yeah.
 And you can start in really, really small ways.
 Yeah.
 It's really easy.
 And you can have fun with God with it.
 Just spend some time journaling about that kind of stuff and then just take baby steps towards it.
 All right.
 I have a listening question for you from somebody with the best name ever.
 I would like to think that their name is Dagobar as in the Dagobar system from the Star Wars.
 But it's probably not.
 No, but it's spelled that way.
 They're Icelandic and I'm sorry for ruining your name already.
 I think it's dog Bjort.
 It means day bright in English, which I think is possibly the best.
 And we've ever had on the podcast.
 And their question is this.
 Thanks a lot for your podcast is blessed me in many ways.
 You're more than welcome.
 After seeking God for the new year, I felt this year, 2016, he wanted to give me
 new revelation about his heart.
 I'm a big doer and can be very impatient, but he told me that slowly and without extremes
 he wanted to give me new revelation, so I'm going for it.
 I'm going through AJ's Finding Father book and love it.
 Journaling is no problem, I know very well the keys to hearing God's voice and I've
 been using Mark Vorkler's technique for some years now, but I find this soaking thing so
 difficult.
 I'm doing all the exercises in the book, but not much is happening.
 Could you kindly discuss soaking in your show best wishes from Iceland,
 Dag Bj&Atilde;&para;rr or Dagba or Daybright in English?
 First off, brilliant question.
 Second of all, we love Iceland and miss it very, very much.
 Oh, so much.
 And we're jealous that we're sending a bunch of students to Iceland and we're not going with them.
 We don't get to go.
 However, we love Iceland and thank you for writing in.
 Babe, you wrote a book about soaking, explain what soaking is and why people will have problems
 initially if they're doers.
 Yeah, I mean, if you're a doer, it totally makes sense to me.
 Um, we basically, you just lie down someplace comfortable and you, you rest and engage with
 heaven and listen to God.
 So it's the same kind of tools that you're using in terms of journaling, connecting with
 heaven, you could visualize what's going on in heaven, ask Jesus where he is in the room.
 But then you're simply receiving.
 You're just asking the Holy Spirit to pour into you and you're staying still and receiving
 whatever he wants to do.
 And sometimes that's revelation and sometimes honestly you feel nothing at all.
 But you just know that God is somebody who gives good gifts.
 And so if you're actually asking him for a gift of his presence, you're receiving it.
 And then you go on with the rest of your day, but it is super hard.
 And if you're a doer type person or a list type person, I mean, when I first started
 smoking, I are smoking.
 Go on.
 You got to cut that out.
 Nope.
 It's staying in.
 When I first started soaking, all I could think about was the amount of valuable things that
 could be being done with the amount of time that I'm spending lying on a couch or whatever.
 But then I started seeing the fruit of it.
 I just started realizing, "Gosh, my heart's getting healed up and I feel more full and
 I'm more friendly and I feel joy."
 I could see that it was worth persevering, but it takes persevering.
 Yeah, my story is exactly the same.
 When I started, I just thought, I can't think of a bigger waste of time than lying on the floor doing nothing.
 And I remember one day just going, you know, Lord, I could be praying for what is an orphan.
 And the Holy Spirit was like, when have you ever prayed for what is an orphan?
 So I was like, OK, good point.
 I won't grumble anymore.
 And I agree with AG that perseverance is such a big deal to it.
 And I remember when it changed, because I remember just continually giving myself to resting in the presence of God and my value system changing and then experiencing the Holy Spirit.
 So some practical things, make sure you've got some anointed music that will really help.
 Sangvaval is pay attention to what's going on physically in your body.
 I know that sounds absurd, but it helped me because I needed something for my mind to focus on.
 So also don't pray that sounds contrary to what you're trying to do, but I would lie down and I would say a Holy Spirit
 I'm lying down. I'm outsourcing my worship in my prayer to the person on the CD and
 Now would you just come and be with me?
 And then I wouldn't pray because you can't kiss and talk at the same time
 You can't dialogue with God and expect to receive from God at the same time
 so I would just rest and if anything happened physiologically to my body like
 There's tingling in my fingertips or my right thigh would get numb
 I would pay attention to it because I believe that the Holy Spirit is coming and
 Manifesting his presence in my body and I would pay attention to that
 And I noticed that the more attention I gave to what was going on in my body the greater the manifestation of the Holy Spirit
 And that's what I began to learn to discern his presence and learn to discern his feelings
 So I know it can be difficult especially if you're type A personality you want to do do do
 But actually it's the greatest sacrifice you can give is giving God your time
 Especially when you want to be doing other things with it. So keep going and press through
