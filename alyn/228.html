<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones. - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>How the heck are you?
  </li><li>I'm so good.
  </li><li>It's so good to be with you.
  </li><li>Thank you, it's lovely to be with you too.
  </li><li>Thank you so much.
 We are on our seventh feeling.
 We're almost done with our feelings podcast.
 How have you felt our feelings podcast has gone?
  </li><li>I think it's gone well.
 I don't normally listen to our podcasts,
 but I've actually listened to these ones.
 So, you know.
  </li><li>Have you watched them or have you listened to them?
  </li><li>Oh, I've watched them.
 Yeah, I've watched them, I haven't.
  </li><li>I have never caught you watching our podcast.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I've watched them all.
  </li><li>Oh, look at you.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Last week you launched your Finding Father's Summer School.
  </li><li>I did.
 Yeah, and I had lots of fear about that.
  </li><li>Tell me about that.
 What was your fear?
  </li><li>You know, I guess I was sort of like,
 is anybody gonna wanna do this with me?
  </li><li>And it turns out a lot of people wanted to do
 your Finding Father's Summer School.
  </li><li>It's true.
  </li><li>You got people from Canada, America, Scotland, England,
 Australia, Germany, and Denmark, as far as that's the last time I looked at the list of people who've signed up.
 Wow.
 And you kick off this coming Saturday.
 Yeah.
 Super excited.
 What do you feel now like on the other side of your fear of launching it?
 I don't know.
 I'm really excited.
 I'm super excited.
 What's excited?
 I'm glad with probably a little bit of, let me see, fear and anger.
 What's the anger?
 Um, I'm, I feel passionate that it, I wanted to be a great experience for everyone.
 Yeah.
 So yeah.
 Yeah.
 I'm passionate for breakthrough to happen.
 I'm excited.
 I'm excited about all that.
 Uh, you also got a package delivered to the house.
 I did.
 It's actually my second package that I've received from the UK.
 Ooh, yes.
 I was like, you said that coyly, like, did I miss a package?
 Yes, two different very dear friends sent me British chocolate in response to the thievery
 that happened about a month or so ago.
 I'm not sure if it's thievery.
 It's thievery.
 It is.
 Absolutely.
 It wasn't yours.
 It was my new joint.
 Should we look at our wedding vows?
 Should we remind ourselves of...
 There was nothing in there about chocolate.
 I know this.
 Yeah.
 Would you been remarkably generous?
 I have.
 I'm just that somebody needs to take care of it,
 so it's not all gone in a day.
  </li><li>That's true.
 Now would be a good time for me to confess
 that actually another package of British goods
 came that you know nothing about,
 'cause I managed to eat all of them in about 24 hours.
  </li><li>What? What's that?
  </li><li>Doesn't matter. What's happening?
  </li><li>Drop him.
  </li><li>Let bygones be bygones.
  </li><li>Drop him.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well, Chris Law dropped him off at our front doorstep,
 and they weren't addressed to you.
 There was kinder eggs for the kids,
 which I gave to kinder eggs for the kids.
 It was helping for me and then there was milk bottles for me and you don't like milk bottles,
 so I just ate all of them.
 Yes.
 And so how was that day for you then?
 Oh, it was delicious.
 And then how did you feel later after eating a bag of milk bottles?
 Our topic this week is guilt.
 Guilt.
 How fitting.
 We've been really glad to be with you for these last couple of weeks talking about feelings.
 The reason we started this podcast was our loneliness
 and our sadness being stuck in a global pandemic
 and recognizing lots of our friends and our loved ones
 in a similar sort of state.
 And then being given the gift of time,
 you know, when quarantine started,
 we found ourselves with way more time in our hands.
 And so we've had a lot of fun producing these,
 a lot of fun being with these.
 It seems like it's really hitting nerve in a good sense.
 Can you say hit nerve in a good sense?
 Nobody likes our nerve being hit.
 No, let's say something else.
  </li><li>Seems like it really struck a chord.
  </li><li>Struck a chord.
  </li><li>Struck a harmonious chord.
  </li><li>No nerves were hit.
  </li><li>And so thanks for being with us
 for these last couple of weeks.
 We really enjoyed it.
 If you missed our episode last week,
 we've got some exciting news
 that the author of the book
 that this material is all based from,
 a man called Dr. Chip Dodd,
 we reached out to him and said,
 "Chip, we've been talking about your book
 "for the last eight weeks.
 "Is there any way we can get you on the podcast
 "and answer some listeners questions?"
 And he was so kind to say yes.
  </li><li>Yes.
 We're super excited about that.
 We will have him on in two episodes time.
 Yes?
  </li><li>I don't know, we're still working out the details,
 but hopefully that's how it would be.
  </li><li>In the meantime, can you send any questions
 that you might have for Chip that you'd like us to ask him
 to alannaj.com/ask?
 And then we can just get them put together
 and ready to ask.
  </li><li>We'll fire some questions at Chip
 and get your questions answered.
  </li><li>Perfect, but now on to our seventh feeling.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're gonna be talking about guilt.
  </li><li>Yes.
 hope that as we've gone through this, that we have learned that what was previously thought
 of as either negative or really big or really scary feelings are actually gifts. I know
 that every feeling has a gift inside of it, but the feeling themselves is a gift. I was
 thinking this week about the gift of shame that we talked about last week. I've just
 been meditating on the glorious limitations that I have and the grace that I then require
 to live in relationship with others because of my limitations and just sitting with healthy shame
 is so much more comfortable and so much more kind to yourself than sitting in resentment that you're
 not better than what you should be not sitting in and fraudulent, you know, were you trying to
 fake that you don't have any? I just think, wow, what a gift. And guilt is like that. Usually we
 tend to think of as guilt as a feeling that we want to get rid of. But actually, we're going to
 discover that guilt is this tremendously precious gift from God.
 Yeah, guilt is the gift that allows us to feel and accept that we've done something wrong,
 which is essential in relationships. Yeah.
 So if I've done something wrong, like stealing chocolate, for example, for example,
 and don't feel guilt about it in your face.
 Oh, the truth comes out. We'll just bring this one up with Chip.
 I'm sorry to say that chips mean cancel.
 He won't be joining us anymore.
 But think about the times where you have a conversation with a friend or you do some sort of action with a friend and then you go away and you have this feeling that for at least for me I try and like you know nudge away kick away get rid of.
 But actually that feeling is telling me hey knucklehead hey Alan because we're the last people to know how we've been experienced.
 And so guilt is this gift that says, hey, you've done something wrong.
 You've caused some sort of damage.
 That in itself is a tremendous gift from God.
 Now, what we do with it is something different, but actually knowing that we've
 done something wrong is hugely helpful.
 Yeah.
 So we talked a little bit about shame.
 We talked a lot about shame, almost 50 minutes worth about shame last week.
 Shame, like I said earlier, it is the feeling that lets us know our limitations,
 but it also lets us know about our capacity to do harm.
 Yeah. And guilt is actually the feeling that lets us know that we have done harm.
 Guilt is always about behavior that we've exhibited towards somebody else. It's always about
 something that we're not seeing or something we need to own up to those we're in relationship with.
 Right. So guilt is always relational, right? And it's always about, it's either about something
 that's happened with God, with ourselves or with other people.
 The gift then of guilt, if that's what guilt is, which we're probably all familiar with
 guilt, but the gift of guilt is that it sparks this desire for restoration or for healing
 or for forgiveness.
 Yes.
 So it's like, I've done something wrong because I've done something wrong, I need to repair
 what I've done wrong.
 And it starts us on that path to seek out forgiveness,
 connection, you know, the rebuilding of our relationship.
  </li><li>Right, which is why it heals relationship.
 Yeah, so when we feel guilt,
 it prompts us to seek forgiveness.
 And actually it's win-win,
 like whether we actually receive forgiveness
 from that person or not, we actually still get freedom.
  </li><li>Now talk to me about that,
 'cause it seems like I'm only gonna get freedom
 if I get forgiven.
 Well, I think anytime that we actually can go and own our stuff, we get freedom on our end.
 Irrespective of whether they
 Yes, I mean, that's up to them.
 They get to choose their part of it.
 And if they're going to actually forgive or not, forgiven how they want to live their life.
 But I think when you've owned your part of it and you've brought it to the table and you've said, Hey,
 I feel guilty about this.
 Would you forgive me?
 Even if they choose not to, you still get the freedom of having brought it to the table.
 You do and you also get to be human because you were vulnerable.
 Yes.
 Which is beautiful.
 Like the humility always produces beautiful results.
 Yeah.
 In Chip's book, Voice of the Heart, he says this, in guilt, I am offering and
 exposing my heart and humility to another.
 I'm exposing my heart and the harms that I have caused others and God.
 And I am asking for a decision about the future of that relationship from the
 person that I have harmed.
 guilt always points to the need for forgiveness and change, the need to be reconciled with
 our own hearts, with others and with God. Without guilt, we miss the beauty of being loved.
 I love that line. He also goes on and says this in his book, "To refuse our need of forgiveness,
 or to believe that all can be made well by good intentions and hard work, is to reject mercy and
 grace. Mercy brings tenderness to our lives. Grace brings amazement. Both bring
 gratefulness. Without guilt, we miss the beauty of being loved. So guilt is this
 feeling that tells us we've done something wrong. If we listen to our
 guilt, the the gift of guilt is that it prompts us to move toward needing
 forgiveness, which in turn brings healing. And we've talked about even if we move
 towards that, our hearts return to us free anyway, even if the person refuses
 forgive us because we've listened to our guilt. We haven't denied our guilt.
 Right.
 What happens if you do choose to deny your guilt?
 If you choose to just not want to feel it.
 Yeah. If you just pretend it's not there or you move straight to justification,
 or you come up with all the sort of reasons why they deserved the behavior and it wasn't
 your fault and they made you mad and they made you angry.
 Right. What happens?
 Then you sink in pride and in toxic shame.
 Yeah. That's the impairment.
 Yes. So one of the things that happens when pride takes over,
 and it's taken over because we've refused to feel our guilt.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It isn't actually forgiveness that we want.
 We actually want justification.
 We wanna be right.
 (groaning)
  </li><li>Which, (laughing)
 could we skip this part?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's not actually forgiveness that we want.
 It's, I wanna explain away the rationale
 behind my reasons the way I did it.
 And it's not actually reconciliation I'm looking for
 in that relationship.
 It's a way for me to convince you that you don't need to have feelings about my behavior.
 Right.
 Or in this situation, you for convincing me that I'm wrong because actually what you behaved
 or how you behaved is totally fine.
 Therefore, you don't need to have guilt about it.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And the danger of that is if I'm not prepared to work on my stuff and actually seek forgiveness,
 if I'm lawyering up and giving you all the reasons why you can't be mad at me because
 you misunderstood, you know, these are all the very legitimate reasons I have for this
 behavior is when I do that, I'm actually teaching you, I'm training you, that it's okay for you to
 be harmed by my behavior. And therefore, it's okay for you to harm other people as long as you can
 give a good reason for your bad behavior. Yikes. So but think about how that affects a culture.
 Sure, sure. Like so think about if your if your leaders in your culture aren't humble,
 if they're not people who can admit that they're wrong, then as long as you can justify your actions,
 Then do you know suck it up?
 Yeah.
 Oh, oh, give me some British chocolate.
 No, we don't need to eat our feelings, darling.
 But they're so delicious.
 A finger of fudge is just enough to make your feelings go away.
 Is that the actual jingle?
 Are you writing new jingles?
 Well, as a little boy, I forget what the jingle was.
 A finger of fudge is just enough.
 I honestly can't remember.
 I can remember the first bar of the jingle.
 -So you've just written your own ending.
 -It's just enough to suppress all your feelings.
 -Oh, excellent.
 -Yes.
 -There we go.
 Please send fingers of fudge.
 -Please don't.
 I already have this stash of chocolate
 that I'm doling out slowly, so we don't need any fudge.
 -So going back to that whole--
 you're talking about how pride comes around.
 So the pride is, no, I'm not wrong.
 You're wrong for actually having feelings.
 Of course, it's going to be very hard
 to build a healthy relationship with anybody who who lived for that mindset.
 Sure. And the person who who is moved into pride is going to end up in a fortress of solitude and
 isolation. Yeah. Okay, which I'm sure there's a Disney song written about that.
 I'm pretty sure there is. The fortress. That came way too quickly to me.
 But once again, a fortress of isolation and solitude. Something like that. Yeah. Okay.
 Sounds pretty. I need to broaden my movie view.
 So that's pride. Let's talk about toxic shame.
 Okay.
 Whereas pride says, I don't need it.
 Like, I don't need to apologize for anything.
 It's just you, you with all your feelings and your emotions and,
 oh my gosh, drama much.
 Right. So pride makes it about like, I don't need to be forgiven.
 Are you kidding me?
 Yeah. There's nothing to forgive.
 Yeah. You just need emotional robustness.
 That's your problem.
 Toxic shame says, I don't deserve it.
 Like both of them keep me from moving toward what I actually need,
 which is forgiveness and healing.
 Wow.
 Of course, the Bible is replete with passages about guilt.
 It is, isn't it?
 The reason Jesus came was to save us from the burden of our guilt.
 Yes.
 From doing things wrong.
 Listen to this.
 This is from Psalm 32.
 "A what joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sin is put out of sight.
 Yes, what joy for those who...
 Yes, what joy for those whose record the Lord has cleared of guilt,
 whose lives are lived in complete honesty.
 When I refused to confess my sin, my body wasted away, and I groaned all day long.
 Day and night your hand of discipline was heavy on me. My strength evaporated like water in the
 summer heat. Finally, I confessed all my sins to you and stopped trying to hide my guilt.
 I said to myself, "I will confess my rebellion to the Lord, and you forgave me. All my guilt is gone."
 Gail is there to lead us to the freedom we so desperately need.
 Yeah.
 I remember earlier this year, I'm useless with time.
 I just don't remember time.
 I know that about you.
 Earlier this year, till end of last year, I was on the phone with a really close friend.
 One of the things that happens when you have a really close friend is you can become a little
 bit freer with your language.
 There's a little bit more give and take.
 Bantur.
 Yeah, you're less on your best behavior.
 You're more yourself.
 So that's good and bad.
 You've got people you can just unwind with,
 but you can also be short with people
 when you're tired or grumpy,
 because you've lost the edge of professionalism
 that you might have in a say, a work environment.
  </li><li>Right, there's no buffer.
  </li><li>Right, no buffer.
 So I'm on the phone with a friend,
 and I forget the circumstances,
 and I'm not trying to move into justification and pride,
 but I'm having a conversation with a friend,
 and I said something quick, something cutting,
 and we finished the conversation and we got off,
 And I remember I'm driving to work.
 And I remember that as I'm driving to work, I'm replaying the conversation
 against my will, like the conversation is replaying and I'm feeling what I now
 know is guilt, but I'm feeling this thing of like, yeah, that was pretty
 dishonoring like that.
 What you just said there was like, oh, and you know, I'm like, well, you know,
 they know I was joking.
 Well, you know, I've had sleep.
 I'm moving straight into pride, like, right.
 I'm coming up with all these reasons why I don't need to apologize.
 And then I'm remembering actually on the other side of what I'm feeling like if I stay on this path
 I'm gonna build an agenda about why that person can't be upset at me and why I'm fine
 All that's gonna do is build this veneer this fraudulent veneer that isn't even real about me to keep my heart from not feeling guilt
 Well on the other side is if I actually just oh not me just go hey
 You know when we hung up I've been feeling really guilty about what I said and actually
 I'd regret what I said and actually in retrospect, Jesus really dishonoring.
 Would you forgive me? It's going to be healed.
 But then starts to struggle of like, "Well, you know, and, you know, I...
  </li><li>It was something joking again. - And I just thought, no.
 And so I remember pulling over the car and just saying, "Hey, with the conversation we just had,
 I was a little too loose with the words I said, and I really regret someone's...
 And I've guilt, I said this and this, would you forgive me?"
 And, you know, sometimes when you do that, the person is just like,
 "Oh my gosh, no, like I didn't feel that anyway."
 You still win because you're humbled as well.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>You're still building a relationship.
 You're still demonstrating,
 "Hey, I can be a safe person to be in relationship with."
 Now in this case, what I felt was accurate.
 And the person was like, "Oh, I'm so glad.
 Like I was sitting over here going,
 "Man, am I just too sensitive?
 Like that really hurt my feelings
 and I'm really glad you called."
 And what do you know rather than destroying a relationship
 actually rebuilds and strengthens the relationship
 when you're honest and you become a safe person
 to be in relationship with, don't you?
 Because you're gonna apologize if you get something wrong.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So that makes it safe to risk it.
  </li><li>And not just apologize,
 but you're really gonna seek forgiveness.
 You're gonna seek to restore.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like sometimes apologies are just,
  </li><li>I'm sorry.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it's about me not having to feel something
 rather than me restoring a relationship.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Edgy Jones, why don't you read us one more bit from Chip?
  </li><li>All right, here it is.
 guilt is our most precious emotional and spiritual gift from God.
 A company by healthy shame, guilt propels us to transparently turn
 ourselves over to the care of others and ultimately God in order to find
 forgiveness and freedom.
 This relinquishing of the heart to another has transforming power.
 The power to unite us more closely in relationship with others where harm
 kept us apart. The deeper the harm before forgiveness, the deeper the relationship can be when forgiveness is granted.
 So that's guilt. That's guilt. The strangely one of the most straightforward ones. It was very straightforward.
 It's a gift in that it tells us we've done something wrong. We've harmed someone. We've harmed ourselves. We've harmed God.
 The gift found with the feeling of guilt is that we'll propel us to seek forgiveness and bring us freedom.
 And the impairment is if we refuse to feel our guilt will end up in pride or toxic shame. It's just thinking that's a standard blue pill
 red pill
 matrixy kind of
 I can't remember which one
 We've been talking about the school for the last couple of weeks
 On the podcast. Yeah, just wanted to let you know that actually applications close on June 15th
 Coming up. It's coming up fast
 It's just almost two weeks away now, isn't it?
 If you have been considering it, I just encourage you to pray about it and have a conversation
 with the Holy Spirit.
 If you go to schoolofsupernaturallife.org, you can see all the information there, the schedules,
 the costs, who comes to speak, just it's all there, all the information.
 But I'd really encourage you to have a look at it.
 Thank you so much for being with us for these last couple of weeks on our podcast.
 We're going to need some ideas about what to talk about next.
 'cause in a couple of weeks we'll have done feelings
 and my brain is scattered about what to do podcast on.
 So if you've got any ideas about what you would like us
 to do a podcast series on, I like doing serieses.
  </li><li>Serieses are more fun than--
  </li><li>Or way more fun.
 But so if you've got stuff you'd like us to talk about,
 we've talked about a lot.
 We've got 200 and something episodes as a backlog.
 But if there's something you want us to unpack,
 we would love to do that.
 Go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/asky and give us some ideas.
  </li><li>Yep, that would be great.
 Thank you.
 That's the same place you go to if you want to ask Chip Dodd, the author of the book that
 we've been working through in this feelings course, if you want to ask him a question
 as well.
 Thanks so much for being with us today on the vodcast as we've been talking about guilt.
 Next week we'll be talking about the feeling glad.
 We really appreciate you being with us.
 We really especially appreciate our patrons.
 Thank you so much patrons for your support in making these videos possible.
 If you would like to learn how to become a patron and the benefits that come from your
