<p> I'll live in ages, but I'll score your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 208 of Keeping Up With Joneses, where this week we're talking about
 inner healing and nasal congestion.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Only for you, though.<br/>
 I don't have any nasal congestion.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 And the sad thing is I don't really have nasal congestion.
 I just sound like I do.<br/>
 Well, didn't you just sneeze a second ago?
 No.<br/>
 I thought you did.<br/>
 Are you hearing the face?<br/>
 Spiritual sneezes.<br/>
 That must be what it was.<br/>
 You're hearing sneezes in the spirit realm.
 Yep.<br/>
 I was thinking about our week this week.
 And while a lot happened, not a lot did.
 Yeah, it was just really full with lots of stuff to do,
 not necessarily tons of exciting stuff.
 You know what I think it is?<br/>
 I think it's because we were on vacation last week.
 Yes.<br/>
 Any time you go back to work after we've been on vacation,
 everything feels like a marathon.<br/>
 It does because you were able to just lie in bed.
 Gloriously.<br/>
 And then maybe walk to the beach and get a coffee and eat a handmade pizza, donuts and go home.
 And I have to say, it is a beautiful thing to be in this stage where all of your kids could get themselves breakfast on their own.
 So, like, you know, we could sleep until eight or eight thirty.
 I mean, it's positively late.<br/>
 Yeah, that is a glory stage.<br/>
 Yeah. I haven't seen them all afternoon. I came home from church and I've been lying on the sofa
 pussing around and they've been upstairs pussing around. I'm like, I know there probably should be
 more family engagement than this, but I'm actually enjoying the lack of it.
 Well, Tia has discovered some new art apps on her iPad and she's asked me if she can get a pencil
 for her iPad for Christmas, which she doesn't realize that's not going to work. And because
 'cause hers is too old, right?
</p><ul>
  <li>Or maybe she does realize that's how it works
 and she's just playing the sweet, naive, innocent child
 and banning eyelids. - With the eyes.
  </li><li>Knowing that daddy's gonna get her new iPad
 for the pencil.
  </li><li>Hi, daddy.
 And then Abby got some makeup
 and so she's changing her makeup several times a day.
  </li><li>Which is adorable.
  </li><li>Because she's so excited about it and it's really cute.
  </li><li>You nearly had to borrow it this week.
  </li><li>This morning, yeah, I couldn't find my makeup.
 It had, I had brought it with me
 because I was on Friday going from having a massage
 to meeting somebody for lunch.
 So yeah, don't feel sorry for me.
 But I had brought it in the car
 and then I couldn't find it.
 It turns out I guess I drive slightly aggressively
 and it had slid right up under the seat.
 And so that's why I couldn't see it.
  </li><li>Slightly aggressively.
  </li><li>Well, so I drive like I still live in Toronto,
 even though I live in Franklin, Tennessee.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, so, you know, there's that whole thing of like,
 If it's possible to lose your salvation,
 I'll probably lose it while I'm driving.
 (laughs)
 Sorry.
  </li><li>I was so excited yesterday.
 I thought I'd got to the root problem.
 We, I think we mentioned that we got given a sauna
 and the sixth panels in the sauna
 and two of them weren't working.
 And one day while I was in the sauna,
 I was just looking at those two panels thinking,
 I wonder why they're not working with the,
 they look in good condition.
 And I had this sneaking suspicion
 that maybe a rodent had chewed through some of the,
 the wiring of it in its old house.
 And so on Friday night I took the sauna apart
 and what do you know, my suspicions
 as inspired by the Holy Spirit were correct.
 I found all these chewed through wire.
 So I was like, this should be easy to fix.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Saturday just unwire everything, go to Home Depot
 and buy some replacement wire.
 And I was worried I'd have to solder, solder.
  </li><li>Solder.
  </li><li>Solder, which I don't know how to do,
 but thankfully I didn't.
 And so anyway, I bought a new wire, came home,
 took me a couple hours to dismantle everything and rewire all.
 And I was like, this should be great.
 And look at that.
 I fixed it.
 And then I turned it on.
 And then a part of the electricity in our house stopped working.
 Yeah, all of a sudden our TV and stuff
 wasn't working upstairs.
 And we were like, that's so weird.
 It's weird.
 Not even a little red light is on.
 There's no power going to this thing at all.
 And then I started getting notification from camera systems
 or your cameras offline.
 I'm like, I think I know what has happened.
 And I went down and thankfully the fuse box,
 we call it in Britain or what do we call it in America?
  </li><li>Breaker Box.
  </li><li>Breaker Box, a dumbest job and a trip to breaker,
 and which meant our house didn't go on fire,
 but there was some suspicious plastic burning smell
 coming from the sauna.
 So it's like, I thought it was gonna be straightforward,
 but apparently I'm foiled.
  </li><li>Apparently you were not an electrician.
 However, you are a brilliant Bible teacher
 and we can hire an electrician.
  </li><li>I know, but I was quoting verses at it
 and the sauna wouldn't get fixed.
 I just thought how difficult could it be?
 just like swap this cable here, but you know, yeah.
 Well, it's difficult enough that you require an education to be an
 electrician. No, no, I'm not suggesting that electricians are not
 skilled people. My particular problem was like, Oh, this cable's
 broken. If I replace that cable, yeah. But I'm I'm foiled and
 filed again. Very sad.
 Do you want to talk about the Mary couple sex talks this week?
 Sure. Parents, if you listen to this podcast and a car you might
 want to skip this chapter.
 Yeah, just just advance ahead.
 Yeah.
 So we, uh, we do this every year.
 Actually, uh, sometimes we do it every two years, which is the case with this one.
 And we invite any year one or year two students and their spouses, whether they
 are on the school or not, uh, to attend what we call the married couple sex talk,
 which is quite exciting.
 Exciting.
 I'm not sure if it's exciting or not.
 The reason we do this is you would imagine every married couple actually knows how to have sex because that's one of the perks of being married.
 But a recent research from a renowned urologist revealed pretty much people are having terrible sex.
 And in the church, nobody talks about sex at all.
 Yeah, it's really sad.
 And if sex is a good thermometer for the quality of your marriage, which I think is, I think it's strange that the church does nothing to help
 Mary couples have better sex. So we it's not like we appointed ourselves. We'll take up that mental.
 Well, it all kind of happened accidentally. We have for many, many years, always done a sex talk
 for the people we're going to marry that if they wish, if so occasionally we get asked to perform
 weddings, which is always a privilege to be asked. And as part of that, we ask, would you like a
 sex talk? And almost everybody says yes. And then there's times when there's people who are getting
 married and we might not be doing the wedding, but they would say, "Hey, we've heard you
 do sex talks, could you do sex talks for us?" and all was happy to do that.
 And again, for those of you who are just thinking, "Why would you do sex talks?
 Isn't that difficult?"
 The greatest example I've had of that is to people who don't think having great sex
 needs practice.
 I think it was Dr. - what's his name?
  </li><li>Kevin Lehman.
  </li><li>Dr. Kevin Lehman, who when people would say that in his office, he'd give the husband
 a violin and it gives the wife a bow and just say, "Well, go play the violin. It's not
 rocket science. It's just like rubbing that bow over those strings and you should be making
 music." Right. Everybody's seen people do that. Right. How difficult can it be? Yeah.
 And so that's one element to it. And then on our school, in the School of Supernatural
 Life, we do a whole week called Sexual Homeless, which is basically a biblical perspective
 on sex and sexuality. And we talk all about usually the brokenness that comes with a simple
 perspective of sex, which is what most people have only ever encountered.
 And we do a lot of ministry into that.
 But a number of years ago, in fact, one of the first or second times that we ever
 taught it, some of the married people in the school said, I love this week.
 And it was amazing.
 But I understand why, but all the content was aimed at single people and a lot of
 the questions we wanted to ask, we didn't want to ask in front of single students.
 So is there any way you could just do like a talk is for married couples.
 So we were like, sure.
 So we started doing that.
 And then it snowballed every year.
 It's I was gonna say it's a lot of fun. I always get a little bit anxious. You do you get super nervous
 Every single time that we do it and then within a couple of days afterwards you're like, okay. Yeah, I'm glad we did that
 That's the next year. I'll let you teach the whole thing and we'll see how nervous you get no no you're you're so good at it
 I'll just do my segments
 I just think it's very courageous for people to sign up for something
 They don't really know what it's gonna be
 people get to send an anonymous question, which is always a joy. But it's a fun
 incortation mark. It's refreshing to have a group of people in a room and get to talk openly and
 frankly. I think if nothing else, though, what's wonderful is for hopefully for all the couples
 in that room, they now have other people they can talk to about things that were always told
 you're not supposed to talk about. Right. So yeah, you can totally come and talk to us about it.
 but also there's, there was 20 couples, I think, in the room.
 So for them to be able to turn to those other people
 and also say, hey, when they said that,
 be able to have a discussion and not feel shame
 in being able to say, hey, I'd love help, I'd love perspective.
 I just want to be able to talk about it and not feel bad.
 Yeah, I did say to them, you're never
 going to be able to watch me preach again
 on a Sunday morning having listened to this particular set
 of talks tonight, whichever really good Kegelab.
 Yeah, it was good.
 That was our week.
 Quiet with a sex talk in the middle of it.
 And then me nearly burning the house down
 while trying to fix the sun.
  </li><li>That's true.
 That's really good.
 I played some Zelda yesterday.
  </li><li>Tell me about this 'cause how many finished the game?
  </li><li>Yeah, I've restarted it.
  </li><li>Out of girl.
  </li><li>So I didn't do master mode like you.
 I just thought I actually want to play the game again
 now that I know what all the buttons do
 and I'm not afraid if that makes sense
 and just play it without a mission,
 but just enjoy myself and explore things
 and not be in a hurry and all that kind of stuff.
 So that's what I'm doing.
 I'm just sort of meandering around and having fun
 and doing the favorite parts of the game that I had
 and I'm not really fighting bad guys or anything like that
 'cause that's not my favorite thing
 unless I need their body parts to upgrade some sort of armor,
 which all sounds very strange,
 but I'm just having fun with that.
 And I realized yesterday,
 normally we have the small group leaders over
 to our house on Sunday.
 and one Sunday month.
 And I thought, I haven't actually had a day off,
 like a day to just chill, and I need that.
  </li><li>You mean since your vacation?
  </li><li>Right, I mean this week, right?
 So, and I thought, I actually need that.
 I need, I just need the space of that.
 And if we were to have them over today,
 what needed to happen was probably six hours of cleaning.
 And I thought, I just can't, I don't have the energy.
 So it was fine, we took them out for lunch today,
 which was a treat and it was fun
 and it meant that I got to actually have a day off yesterday,
 which I think--
  </li><li>Don't cry out of you for prioritizing.
  </li><li>I know, I never do that.
  </li><li>Self-care is not selfish.
  </li><li>It was so good.
 I was kind of proud of myself.
  </li><li>I'm super proud of you.
  </li><li>Thanks, babe.
  </li><li>Well done.
 Our main topic for this week is one of our favorite topics.
  </li><li>Llamas and eye-stancing.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
 It's all about inner healing.
 I was thinking like inner healing
 so much part of our life.
 now. I'm trying to think about a time when I didn't know about inner healing, which I can't,
 I can't think back that far, but trying to think about a good way of describing what inner healing
 is, why it's essential. You know, this is part of our Back to Basics series. This is what we would
 consider one of the top 10 fundamental things for all Christians to know about. And there's a surprising
 number of people in the church who either don't know about inner healing or think it's entirely
 unnecessary. But I've got, oh yeah, totally. I've got a Bible verse for you. Okay. Which
 I think sums up inner healing beautifully. Hit me with it. Well, I don't want to hit you,
 but I will share it with you. Okay, share it with me. Hebrews 10 verse 14. Right of Hebrews
 is this by one sacrifice. That's Jesus's death on the cross by one sacrifice. He is made perfect
 forever those who are being made holy. Yes. And this beautiful tension or this
 oxymoronic statement where we buy Jesus' death on the cross, we've been made
 perfect forever and yet we're still being made holy. Yeah. Yeah. So we're new but
 we're being made new. Right. Yeah. Inner healing is in one sense part of the
 Christian walk where we are being made holy. Yeah. We're already made perfect
 through the death of Jesus on the cross, but we're learning to walk that out.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's the whole thing of learning to put off the old man, like Paul writes about
 an Ephesians.
 Yeah, you're about to do Ephesians verse by verse.
 Yes, we are.
 Yeah.
 So it's interesting because, um, I think, I think because inner healing is so
 much a part of our culture and our understanding and, uh, probably the
 reason we are the way we are, who we are.
 It's sometimes hard for me, like when people don't have a grid for
 interhealing to understand how they're actually making it through life kind of
 thing, like what do you do when you hit trauma? Because I know what I do. I don't
 know what you do if you don't have a grid for interhealing. Well, it goes back to
 that part, but when I first met you, I'm listening to your testimony, which is one
 of severe childhood trauma, childhood abuse, cross-addicted alcoholic parents,
 just trauma everywhere you look in your childhood.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then later on, just more trauma,
 trauma trauma trauma trauma trauma.
 And you're sharing your testimony which takes a week.
 Every day I hear more stuff.
 I'm just thinking, how are you still functioning?
 And the crazy thing is when I look at you, you're radiant.
 You're not telling this story as a beat-up rejected
 haggard old victim.
 You're this glorious, joyful, radiant, life-giving,
 hope espousing wonder. And I'm like, how does the person in front of me measure up to the trauma
 that I've just heard about? And the answer would be, inner healing. You mentioned that verse,
 what is it, putting off the old man? Ephesians 4 verse 22.
 It says this, "You were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self,
 which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires, to be made new in the attitude of your mind,
 and to put on the new self, created to be like God in true righteousness and holiness.
 That process of putting off your old self and being made new in the attitude of your mind,
 as I quote Paul, is one aspect of inner healing. It's taking the work that Jesus did and applying
 it to the inner parts of our life or the inner parts of our heart.
 Psalm 51 verse 6 says, "Surely you deserve truth in the innermost parts, for example."
 And so a lot of the Christian culture I was raised in was really focused on your behavior.
 Inner healing focuses on your beliefs because all beliefs produce behavior.
 Yeah, inner healing at its most basic level is about the Lord removing things that hinder
 us in our relationship with ourselves, with the Lord, and with other people.
 Help me understand that.
 I know what you mean obviously because I'm fluent in the topic.
 But someone who's listened to this, who's never heard about inner healing, when you say
 it's inner healing is removing things that hinder us in a relationship to ourselves or
 to the Lord.
 We'll talk about that.
 Well, I think under the canopy of inner healing, there's a whole bunch of different
 tools that are part of us actually allowing the Holy Spirit to heal our hearts and set us free
 from the things that hold us back. So whether that's like forgiveness, which we've talked about a
 couple of podcasts ago, there's things like inner vows that we tend to make when we go through trauma
 that we need to actually disengage from their stuff like ungodly beliefs. Again, we've done a
 podcast on that. So we can link all those things in the show notes. But let me interrupt you for a
 second, it's easy to see how you went through trauma as a child.
 But what about the rest of us?
 Everybody's been through trauma.
 It's see, I think the mistake that we make is people compare pain and they sort
 of say, well, yes, that's pain.
 And so therefore I shouldn't feel X or I should be able, we should
 on ourselves all the time.
 Right.
 Right.
 How you say that quickly.
 So, so the deal is pain is pain is pain is pain.
 Right.
 And you don't have to have gone through something like what I went
 through or plenty of people have been through way worse than I've been through.
 Right.
 It's not really about that.
 If your heart registered pain, then probably you've registered a belief to go
 along with that pain because that's we typically experience something and we
 start to believe something because we have to process it somehow.
 And out of that usually ends up coming a whole bunch of different things.
 And whether that's bitter root judgments, whether that's ungodly beliefs, whether
 that's in her vows. We lay down train tracks that life is going to run on. And often later
 on, we wish that we hadn't, but we don't know how to rip up the tracks. And inner healing
 is ripping up the tracks.
 All right. You use a whole bunch of lingo there, which are demons.ify, decodify. You're
 right. So when we go through trauma, especially as children, right, we God's given us this
 brilliant ability to dissociate from that pain. Like if the pain is too much, there's
 a part of us that can actually just separate when the pain is overwhelming.
 And we disconnect from the pain and we often disconnect from ourselves.
 Yes.
 Um, even something not as extreme as that, we're hurt.
 The enemy loves to tell us lies about why we were hurt or the people who
 were hurt us or the pain that we're feeling.
 Yeah.
 And so we end up with a faulty understanding of the world and how it works.
 Right.
 Right.
 So you talk about a UGB, for example, what does that hip abbreviation stand for?
 It's an ungodly belief.
 So it's-- - An ungodly belief would be what?
  </li><li>An ungodly belief is something that appears to be
 absolutely true based on the facts of your experience,
 but is absolutely false based on God's word.
  </li><li>For example.
  </li><li>For example, things like, "I am unlovable,"
 or "I am invisible."
 You absolutely are not.
 Scripture is really clear that you are loved
 with an everlasting love.
 That, I mean, Jesus died, he would have died for just you
 to have a relationship with a father.
 You are loved, you are chosen, you are seen.
 But life lies to us.
 And then the enemy comes along and wants to reinforce that.
 And if we keep listing, he'll just add as much reinforcement
 as he can to try and keep us in that box.
  </li><li>So we have an experience, like we have a painful thing
 where perhaps we were rejected
 or it's our first day of kindergarten,
 we're overlooked, we're ignored.
 And so we have this belief that forms that says,
 I won't be noticed, I'll always be overlooked.
 I'll always be rejected.
 Yes.
 That usually tends to get rehearsed in our heads
 and reinforced by situations that the enemy,
 you know, fosters.
 Yeah.
 And before we know it, we've built a track record
 where we can point to why that feeling
 is absolutely the truth of our life.
 Right.
 And then along comes a podcast like this,
 where we're like, "Whoa, you don't actually have to believe
 that version of your life because that may be true for you,
 but it's not the truth of God's word."
 Right.
 And so you bring along this truth that you're not rejected.
 You're not, you don't need to be overlooked.
 All these promises in scripture about what the Holy Spirit would love to do for you.
 And you replace your wrong thinking with right thinking and it begins to
 transform your life.
 Right.
 So we call that the belief expectation cycle, don't we?
 So, so something happens.
 You form a belief as a result of that, like the, you know, I'm rejected.
 I will always be rejected.
 And that starts to determine your behavior because you're expecting
 to be rejected, you start to be the person that shrinks back and isn't seen or whatnot.
 And then it creates you partner with an expectation.
 This is always going to continue to happen.
 And so you have another experience that reinforces that same wheel and you just keep going around.
 And out of that, there's not just ungodly beliefs that come out of that.
 There's other things like bit of root expectations and things like that.
 Yeah, you're like, so that belief expectation cycle,
 that wounding, let's start with judgment.
 So out of that, there are other things we use
 to keep our hearts quote unquote safe.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So we make judgments.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>About these big, bad, scary people.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>But not realizing while there's some temporary
 satisfaction of making those judgments,
 we can work out they are bad and I'm just a victim.
 The trouble is those judgments become so strong
 that they begin to direct the forces of our life
 to bring us harm and others harm.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right?
 So I don't think we've talked about
 bit of root judgments or bit of expectations,
 but basically when we judge
 and those judgments lie dormant,
 we foster bitterness and then they spring up
 and they cause a whole of trouble.
  </li><li>And the most amazing thing with some of these things
 is sometimes we don't even realize
 that those judgments are there until way later on in life
 when something kind of triggers them, you know?
 So we might have, as kids made judgments of our parents
 or whatever, because of things that were going on,
 maybe judgments about their marriage,
 or, you know, I'll never do that,
 or I'll always do that, and you know,
 all that kind of stuff, those are all inner vows,
 those examples, but we judge in some way,
 and then later on we get married, or we have kids,
 and we find ourselves doing the exact things
 that we said I'll never do,
 and they were all based in judgment.
  </li><li>Or we defile our spouse into doing the things
 we judged our opposite gender parent for.
 So for example, I judge my mother for doing something.
 So I've therefore judged the primary woman in my life.
 And I escape that judgment until I get married.
 And as soon as I get married, that judgment comes back to bite me in the butt via you.
 So my judgment defiles you into behaving in a way that ensures I reap the judgment I
 made against my mom.
 So as a rather humorous example, my mother would always forget her keys and I remember,
 I must have judged her.
 I mean, in fact, I remember judging her for losing her keys, for being, I can't believe
 how foolish you are to lose your keys as ridiculous.
 And of course, judge my father for berating my mother for losing her keys all the time.
 Then we get married and as soon as we get married, you who are super organized start
 losing your keys.
 Yes.
 And then I start berating you the way my father would berate my mother.
 And that's just an example.
 Now without inner healing, if I remember correctly, I remember turning on you one day and saying,
 will you please deal with whatever judgments you have against your mother?
 So I can find my keys because I've never had this problem before.
 Exactly.
 And it worked, didn't it?
 It absolutely did.
 So that would just be one, that's just one of the many things that we talk about within
 our healing.
 So we talked about bureau judgments, we talked about ungodly beliefs, talked about the problem
 with, with judgments and unforgiveness.
 I know we've talked about unforgiveness before,
 but just mention the problems that stem
 from refusing to forgive.
  </li><li>Well, there's something called the law
 of judging and receiving.
 So usually any time that we are unwilling to forgive,
 there's a judgment in there somewhere.
 Like so we have decided, I'm not gonna forgive you
 because you are X, whatever X is.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You are horrible, you are mean, you are whatever.
 And so those things are judgment statements.
 And the problem with that is the second
 that you enter into judgment,
 you step away from mercy, don't you?
 So it's a bad cycle to be a part of,
 and very likely what you will receive back
 is more of what you have accused the other one of.
  </li><li>And judgment is also responsible
 for an enormous amount of physical sickness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it attracts demonic oppression,
 like nobody's business.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, if we could get rid of judgment
 and sugar, probably most people would be well.
 easy tiger easy tiger.
 So yeah, when we talk about inner healing is this umbrella term from doing all of the damage through Jesus is great provision on the cross.
 Yeah, think back to when you got saved.
 Can you think of anything that back away back.
 You know you listen to people's testimonies and miraculous things happen when they get saved like the instant they give up cigarettes or they'll free from addiction or.
 Can you remember anything that happened to you when you got saved like a like a sovereign
 Active grace that happened on your life. I mean apart from you know the gifts of eternal life. I'm talking about
 Didn't you stop cussing? No, I didn't stop cussing out of girl. I I
 Comes out by prayer and fast apparently yeah, I had a foul foul mouth
 And I mean it's it's amazing. I wasn't a much more violent individual, but my violence came out
 With words. Oh, yes
 So no, I didn't I just didn't cuss a church. Oh, yeah, girl performance and then it was it was actually a couple years later
 You know after I'd sort of gotten in it in a at the church in Toronto and
 Was getting in or healing and all that kind of stuff where the Lord started talking to me about the overflow of my heart and
 You know just was so kind about it not judgmental or anything
 But like hmm seems like the overflow of your heart is really a lot of anger
 You know, and that was when I started to realize just how angry I was about everything.
 I always thought I wasn't an angry person, but I was furious.
 So I got to go on the journey of unhooking from all of that, which I'd built up over
 years.
 My point in saying all that is when we get saved, there's some things that God does sovereignly
 and then there's other stuff that seems to be walking out.
 And that tends to help explain the extreme reactions that you get towards inner healing.
 For example, there's some churches that just don't believe in inner healing, they have
 no grid for it.
 It's just like, you know, everything's done at the cross.
 We don't need to talk about the old man's dead and buried.
 We can just get on with the rest of our life.
 And then at the other end of the spectrum, you've got churches who think that there's
 a demon behind every bush andRight, 
 which also isn't helped for a dog.
 Yeah.
 It's like, you know, huge scale.
 I think the best balance is that verse of,
 "Forget where it's from," where it says that
 God has given us everything we need for God
 that life through Jesus.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Forget where that is.
 Peter, I'll look up and put it in the show notes.
 But Jesus gave us everything we need
 for life and Godliness.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But if I meet you and I'm like,
 "Hey, AJ, how are you?"
 And you're like, "Oh, I'm just doing terrible.
 "I'm about to be evaded from my house.
 "I don't have any money."
 And I wire you a million dollars.
 And I see you in two weeks time and you've been evicted.
 I might be wondering, but I gave you the resources.
 Even though you had the resources, you still had to apply those resources to your
 area of need.
 Right.
 And so it's true.
 Jesus has given us everything we need.
 He's blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing.
 But we actually do need to walk with the Lord in process.
 So you find the New Testament littered with verses that tell us to do in
 our healing, that they don't use the phrase in our healing.
 But listen to this verse. This is Ephesians 4 verse 30. Paul is writing to Christians in Ephesus
 So he's writing to believers and he says this, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God with whom you are sealed for the day of redemption
 Get rid of all bitterness, rage and anger
 Brawling and slander along with every form of malice
 Be kind and compassionate to one another
 Forgiving each other just as in Christ God forgave you." Paul is writing to Christians here and literally
 imploring them to do inner healing.
 Hey, stop having bar fights and being mad at each other.
 He's telling them to get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, etc.
 So why?
 Because apparently all that stuff didn't just disappear when they got saved.
 That's right.
 There was issues that were still presenting and he's like, those issues are not fitting
 for people who've been made perfect.
 Right.
 And in the process of being made perfect, even though you are made perfect, we're told
 to work out our salvation with fear and trembling.
 Paul writes that again in Philippians 2.12.
 So you see all the way through scripture this beautiful balance of partnering with the Lord
 to accomplish all that he's already paid for.
 Yeah, Paul also tells us to be transformed by the renewing of our mind, which means there's
 work to be done in renewing our minds.
 Because we have stinking thinking and all beliefs produce behaviors.
 So it's like doing a thought life audit.
 Right.
 It's always interesting to me when people say, well, no, no, you know, all that stuff died
 with the old man. And I'm thinking, usually if you ask those people, if you ask their
 family, if all that stuff died with the old man, they'll say, "I'm still living with
 the old man."
 They resurrect the old man on a daily basis.
 That's right. Hooray! How about we go for a new man that God is creating in us?
 I go back to our friend Chip Judd who said, "You know, surely one of the side effects
 of being filled with the Holy Spirit is that we become nicer people."
 Right. Surely it is.
 I know Christians who know the Bible really, really well, but are horrible to
 dine out with.
 I mean, they treat servers horribly.
 Shocking.
 And I'm like, wait, are you walking representative of the kingdom of God?
 Like, or, you know, they can preach wonderfully on stage, but are horrible to
 the wife and kids behind closed doors.
 Right.
 Well, isn't that what Chip said?
 He, remember he was at that.
 Yeah.
 Who was at a pastor's conference?
 And he stood up and he said, I don't care how many people are in your church or
 how, you know, how big your church is, show me your wife and your kids.
 And I'll tell you the measure of man that you are.
 And it's just like, I mean, the place just went dead silent.
 Like, yeah.
 So are you ever done with the journey of inner healing?
 No, I don't think so.
 I mean, when you die, yes, you're done.
 Is that not depressing for you then?
 No, no.
 I think, um, I think it's hard when you start.
 It feels really overwhelming when you first start hearing about inner healing
 because all of a sudden you can identify a whole bunch of places where you have been stolen from
 for years, right? And you had no idea. And you call that normal life. Yes. Yeah.
 And you know places where you've been triggering and all these things where you're like, man,
 I don't get it like I've fasted. I've prayed. I spend time with the Lord. I'm still triggering.
 Then you hear about inner healing and you're like, oh my gosh, I've been being robbed.
 But to begin with, I remember feeling really overwhelmed by like,
 Lord, I know what a mess my heart is.
 And this feels like the overwhelming task, you know, but the good thing is the Holy Spirit
 leads you through it so beautifully.
 That's a bad part.
 Freedom is so much easier than you think.
 So I'm not discouraged by the fact that it keeps going because I think as long as you
 live with other humans, there's the potential for hurt.
 And what does happen is we get much better at working the process through quickly.
 And then it doesn't eat our lunch like it used to.
 Yeah.
 I think the problem is, I remember when I first did the school in Toronto and received some
 systematic teaching on inner healing.
 Yeah.
 It was that whole thing of what you don't know is great.
 But then when you start learning stuff that you didn't know, you're like, "Oh God, how
 much more do I not know?"
 Yeah.
 And that feeling has accompanied me my whole life.
 So I remember we went away into the weeks intensive inner healing a number of years ago.
 We were like we were genuinely not trying to be the people of like we we teach this we're good like that's folly
 But at the same time we're like we teach this
 You know we try and keep short accounts with God and with man
 I don't know what they're gonna find and then boy they found a ton and I was like wait
 All that would like how much else is there and even in this season, you know
 I've been in seeing a counselor for a year and a bit and being in group counseling
 which has been this new facet of like,
 I don't know how out of touch I was with myself.
 Like that's, this is like--
  </li><li>With your own emotions.
  </li><li>With my own emotions, with my own feelings,
 all my ungodly beliefs related to feelings.
  </li><li>Well, I think we just thought you're just not
 a particularly emotional individual.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, we're great at finding justification
 for sinful nature.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, we really are like,
 when Jack Deere was on here a couple of weeks ago
 and he was talking about,
 "No, no, I thought my whole life I wasn't angry.
 just like things being done in a particular way.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And the rest of the world's an idiot.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then he realized, oh, that's anger.
  </li><li>Oh dear, yeah.
  </li><li>So part of the beauty of pain is,
 it actually gives us motivation to change.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>As long as we don't just try and feed it more food or--
  </li><li>Or blame everybody else.
  </li><li>Or blame everybody else or drink
 or do any of the other things that we do to run
 from actually dealing with ourselves.
  </li><li>Yeah, if we will not let pain hinder our progress,
 it produces beautiful things.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>For sure.
 What about like what i mean in the years that we've been alive and being pro advocates of inner healing we've experienced a bunch of stuff.
 What resources could we give people who are listening who are like inner healing sign the app oh gosh there's so many sort of different formats for inner healing and i would say all of them have great value.
 probably in different seasons or for different types of things.
 So if you go to Grace Center, we have the Revive sessions where you can go and get personal ministry.
 And those people are tooled up with a number of different ways of walking you through hurt.
 Right. We have our encounter recams, which we run maybe three or four weekends a year.
 and we've now just started opening them up to non-grace center members.
 So if you keep an eye on GraceCenter.us and you happen to live here in the States and
 you see an encounter we can come up, that's one of the best introductions you can have
 to inner healing.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 There's something called heart sink.
 Heart sink is amazing too.
 I still am trying to get my head around it.
 It's a very different kind of format for inner healing, but I think it's really effective.
 I'd agree.
 And I think you can, we could probably put in a website where you could get information
 about heart sync.
 There's RTF.
 Which is one of our favorites.
 It is one of the most thorough format ministry sessions that are out there.
 It's basically a week or three days, five days if you're married, three days if you're
 single of, it's like going to the spa for your soul.
 Yeah.
 It really transforms the foundations of your life.
 we've been talking about is covered in the RTF week. I highly recommend one of those
 weeks.
 Yeah, RTF stands for restoring the foundations. And I think one of the things that's particularly
 brilliant about RTF is that you don't actually have to know what's going on with you. You
 just have to know you want change. And yeah, and they help you figure it out. So it's
 really great for that kind of thing. So we've been going to group therapy.
 Yeah, my adventures in group therapy have been amazing. I mean I went there basically because my counselor suggests no
 He said you know what would really benefit you is group counseling and I was thinking you know what would really benefit you is a warm
 Glasser shut the heck up
 Then I realized wait
 I've gone to this person for their expert opinion and if they're recommending group counseling despite the fact
 I'd rather base in my own vomit than do something like that
 I'll try it right and now and now I love it. It's like one of the highlights of my week
 I can't wait to get there. It's phenomenal. The the the transformation that it brings it's it's
 unbelievable a huge proponent of that
 But yeah, so like everything in the kingdom the the dive
 Think about food the diverse options for nutrition for your body are enormous
 Yes, right just this plethora of
 Foods that you can choose from to feed your body the same with inner healing there is a wide ranging
 Gifts out there
 That is all focused on getting ensuring that Jesus gets everything he paid for
 Yeah, I think honestly also I would recommend the school the school is supernatural life sure
 We have such a huge inner healing component and we cover such a wide range
 of tools and ways to get free and all that kind of stuff that honestly my
 Favorite part of getting to do the school and teach on the school is seeing the transformation
 From the beginning of the school to the end of the school. It is
 Unbelievable
 So that's another way that you could look for transformation and pursue it and it's worth noting that the school is supernatural life
 The of course we do a week on inner healing but actually the whole eight months of the school
 is saturated with a focus of the father's love and young of our hearts.
 Yeah.
 So no matter what's being taught, there's that emphasis being woven through every topic.
 Yeah, and the people that come in and have a grid for it and you know, are walking in
 that. So that's one of the things that's great about it. And actually, applications
 are open for next year.
 Look at that.
 Yeah.
 I put a link in the show notes. If you would like to spend eight months in gorgeous Nashville,
 Tennessee watching the seasons change.
 Yeah, it is beautiful here.
 Yep.
 And spent eight months just going deeper with the Lord, we would highly recommend the school
 and not just because we teach on it and how it lead it.
 It is an amazing environment that facilitates change in the kindest possible way to your
 heart.
 Yeah.
 I think the benefit as we wrap this up, the benefit of inner healing is you feel more connected
 to yourself, you get to feel your feelings, tell the truth about your feelings, identify
 your needs. You feel more connected with God. If we're not careful, we've spent a lifetime
 hardening our heart to keep us free from pain only to find that we have a hard time receiving
 God's affection because we're in a pain cage now. His affection lands on the soft, fleshy
 heart and we've hardened it with our heart of stone to just keep paying out.
 And then we find ourselves more connected to one another as well.
 We can freely give and freely receive.
 Yeah.
 So you can love your spouse better and love your kids better and have more grace for your
 strange family members and your weird aunt and you know, all that kind of stuff.
 Yeah.
 It's, it's transformational.
 Just in case any of my aunts are listening, we're talking about AJ's answer.
 Yeah, we're talking about my aunts.
 I don't have weird aunts.
 Okay.
 Verse thessalonians 5 verse 23 says this beautiful thing is this now may the God of peace himself
 sanctify you completely. Basically, inner healing is a process of sanctification.
 Yeah. And it's the work of the Lord. It's not for us to go digging in the garden of our
 soul. It says this now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely and may your
 whole spirit, soul and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,
 He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.
 In our healing is something the Lord does, but we partner with him to ensure he receives
 everything he paid for on the cross.
 Yeah.
 And all that happens is our lives get upgraded.
 Yeah.
 So we want to thank our patrons for supporting us and helping us be able to create these
 episodes for you every week.
