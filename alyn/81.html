<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday, most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hello Mrs Jones.<br/>
 Hello sir.<br/>
 Amazing week.<br/>
 Very good week yes.<br/>
 We are recording this as we come straight back from dinner with our jingle winners.
 It's true.<br/>
 So my tummy is filled with steak.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 We fed them steak for writing music.<br/>
 And creme brulee.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 If I could write music, I would work for steak.
 You would.<br/>
 Give me slabs of cow and I will compose your music.
 Wouldn't you?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 You say no, but every time we go there you eat steak.
 Not every time.<br/>
 Seriously.<br/>
 My mom's last time you went there and didn't have steak.
 I go back and forth between the Thai Kai salad and prime rib.
 Okay.<br/>
 So you either eat meat or meat.<br/>
 Well, so I'd need to be paid in chickens and cow.
 We will start a bar-trings system.<br/>
 We had a fabulous week this week.<br/>
 We really did.<br/>
 Should we start with the fact that I am now an owner of a bike?
 You are the owner of a bike.<br/>
 And in the last two days, I have ridden seven miles.
 Yes.<br/>
 And my butt and my knees would like to talk to you about that.
 If only they could talk, which I'm kind of glad they can't.
 So if you were listening last week, I was talking about toying with the idea of getting a bike.
 And so worked very closely with our new friend Jeremy at Moala Bikes in Franklin, who was very,
 very helpful. And we ended up with a bike for Abby for Christmas and a bike for me.
 And we went back and forth of, "Should we let Abby ride on our bike before Christmas day?"
 And we thought, "We're in such unseasonably warm weather right now. Let's let her ride her bike,
 because on Christmas day it could be raining." Yeah, it's in the 70s right now.
 It seemed kind of cruel to be like, there's your new shiny bike.
 Yes, it's in the garage and you know, it's there.
 And you have to wait two weeks, but you're going to wait for two weeks.
 So we went to the park where they have like a walking riding trail.
 And I thought, gosh, this bike ride stuff's easier than I thought.
 And we just did four miles, no problem.
 Easy peasy lemon squeezy.<br/>
 I was like, man, I'm totally be able to bike to work on Monday.
 This is going to be so easy.<br/>
 I guess I am healthier than I thought.
 You know what's true what they say when she's on a ride a bike you never forget I am good for this.
 Yeah and then today happened and I thought you know what I'm going to cycle half the way to work you know just kind of break it in.
 I can go for subdivision.<br/>
 Well you made it out of the subdivision I mean out of the subdivision and then can I made it halfway up the hill.
 Are you going to be 96 or commute to work is 10 miles.
 I managed to get three of them done.<br/>
 Well one and a half was your way back to you you made it a mile and a half before you packed it in turn around.
 Yeah it was there's a big difference between actually riding on terrain versus riding around a level thing in the nice park.
 This is why I think that.<br/>
 Maybe if you rode with somebody that rides like ronsen or don or something like that right the only people understand how the gears work and how you.
</p><ul>
  <li>Use the gears in different ways.
  </li><li>It isn't a gear problem.
  </li><li>That you're a bandage.
  </li><li>You're adorable blaming that in gear.
 I think it's a general lack of fitness.
  </li><li>I'm not fully blaming it on the gears.
 I'm just saying perhaps there's some help for you
 to be found.
  </li><li>The help that could be found.
  </li><li>Can't understand the gears better.
  </li><li>The help that could be found is if our friends Don
 and Ronce and wanted to swap legs and butts with me.
  </li><li>Or toe you.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Maybe I could follow him and just slip stream.
 Yeah, yeah, that's what you do.
 Anyway, I started my journey as a bike person
 and there's a whole subculture that I don't understand.
 Yes, these people are into their bikes.
 They're so into it, they've committed to a world of lycra.
 Nobody wants to see me in lycra.
 No, there was like an old guy that came in
 to get his bike fixed,
 while you're buying your bike fully in lycra.
 And I was like, you know,
 I don't care how fit you are, that's just not right.
 Okay, so bikes and like were a high point.
 Yeah.
 Um, we did a lot of social activities this week.
 We did.
 We had dinner with our fabulous small group leaders on Tuesday night.
 We did and fabulous.
 They are.
 We have 13 small group leaders.
 I think so.
 At our school who help us from the school, they're just fabulous.
 So we enjoy the Christmas dinner with them, which is lovely.
 And then later, we had Mexican food for a Christmas dinner.
 Every good Christmas dinner should be Mexican.
 What are you going into Mexicans?
 If you should erase this.
 They celebrate Christmas with tacos.
 And then Thursday night we had our whole school Christmas party, which was a spectacular success.
 It was a great success.
 Thanks to Danielle and Sarah.
 They're amazing.
 They're always good fun.
 I always loved the videos and the things that people put together.
 They're amusing.
 And then Friday we went to a new restaurant, Tupelo Honey.
 Tupelo Honey Cafe.
 Which I hadn't heard of but it's a southern restaurant.
 Starting...
 Asheville, I think.
 Asheville.
 Mm-hmm.
 Really nice.
 I was quite impressed.
 Yeah, it was very good.
 What did you end up having?
 Steak, fruits.
 Mexican food.
 No.
 [laughter]
 I had the chicken tacos.
 All from say, I see the bay.
 Because if there is tacos on our menu, I'm more than likely to eat them.
 That's very true.
 My favorite part of the entire meal was, are you ready?
 The drink.
  </li><li>What did you have to drink?
  </li><li>A blueberry fizzy, I think it was called.
  </li><li>That sounds like a real big grown up, big girl drink.
  </li><li>It was a big girl drink.
  </li><li>What is blueberry fizz?
  </li><li>I don't know.
 I don't know what was in it, blueberry and fizz,
 but it was good.
  </li><li>And then Saturday, you ran a screening of Return of the Jedi.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>How's "Appound" is a new Star Trek movie coming up?
  </li><li>Alan Jones, "Star Wars" is coming out next Friday.
 We of course were not seeing it until the following week
 because we wanted to make sure that we got IMEX 3D tickets.
 But yes, so it just made sense
 that we would have a little update for those.
 There are people that have not seen four, five, and six.
 I don't care about one, two, and three
 'cause they were horrible. - Nobody cares
 about them. - No.
 They don't even exist.
 But people had not actually seen four, five, and six.
 And that's just wrong.
  </li><li>And you said to the Lord's work and evangelize.
  </li><li>Yes, absolutely.
  </li><li>You know what, baby, I commend you.
 You're a hard worker.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 I did want to watch a new Hope,
 the Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi back to back,
 but we didn't have nine available hours to do that.
  </li><li>And you also realized you have a family.
  </li><li>Yes. - Yeah.
 And so I found a video that summarized the first two.
  </li><li>Your diligent. - And then we watched
 the third one. - Very good.
 And then Sunday this morning church,
 it's the first time I've ever been in a church service
 where a fire alarm went off.
  </li><li>Yeah. - In the middle of worship,
 our fire alarms went off. - Yeah.
  </li><li>It was, we don't know what triggered them,
 it was completely a false alarm,
 but worship was amazing.
  </li><li>It really was, it was fantastic.
  </li><li>And Jeff did his thing again
 that we talked about last week, where he just stands up and keeps going with the Holy
 Spirit and everybody just applauds Jeff for that because he's brilliant at it.
 And then our good friend Artie Kendall was speaking.
 Yeah, and it was really good.
 That was an amazing word.
 Yeah.
 Really, really simple.
 Really simple, but so profound.
 Great teacher.
 Really loves seeing Artie.
 It's quite fun watching him pick on other people.
 Yeah, you're just glad it's not you.
 That's really it.
 All right, our main topic for this week.
  </li><li>It's all about hard work.
  </li><li>It is, and our topic is brought to you by Jessie Early.
  </li><li>Yeah, she said, why don't you speak on about hard work?
 You did a great summary this week.
 You said, it often seems like we all want the fruit
 of hard work without actually having to do
 the hard work itself.
  </li><li>Sure, and I'm sure it would be much easier
 if that was reality, but that's very few people's reality.
 So the same thing is, you know, you look at the house
 that your parents had when you're 20 and you're moving out.
 And when you go to buy your first house,
 you want a house that looks like the house you grew up in.
 Well, your parents probably didn't know that house
 when you were little, you know what I mean?
  </li><li>Right, that wasn't our first house.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's, we always have interesting perspectives
 on how much effort needs to go into something
 that looked to us like it was free.
  </li><li>I think being shaken free from entitlement
 is a hard thing. - Yeah.
 like when you suddenly realize, oh, oh, that's not the way life works.
 Right.
 It's a bit of a shock, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 One of the conversations that we tend to have over and over and over and again,
 I don't say this to ridicule the people we have conversations with because I
 remember being on the other side of this conversation.
 And I was their age where it seems that people have a vision and a dream for
 their life and are quite content to work towards that dream in their vision.
 but unfortunately none of those doors are opening for said dream and vision.
 Right.
 At the moment.
 And what doors are opening are, would you like fries with that kind of jobs?
 Right.
 Or, or maybe they're great office jobs, but they're not the dream.
 Right.
 And we've had the benefit of some hindsight where you realize looking back
 in life that you actually work hard in one season to reap in another.
 Yes.
 And that's kind of the tricky part about God.
 I, you know, a lot of the conversations we have, people are like, I'll be willing to work hard for my dream, but they're reluctant to work hard without a dream in sight.
 Right.
 Which kind of makes sense, but it's like, hey, if you don't work, you won't have rent, you won't be able to live, you won't have food, and then you'll never be able to fulfill your dream.
 In essence, you are supporting your dream, just not in an immediately tangible sense.
 Yeah. And I think that there's something to giving a hundred or 150% wherever God places you
 that is satisfying, even when you're not working in your dream, that God's favor can still show
 up. You can still receive promotion. You can still impact the world around you while you wait
 for the dream to come to fruition. Yeah. I mean, that's the life of Joseph, isn't it?
 Right. It's funny that there's a couple of verses in Proverbs. There's two that are identical.
 One found in Proverbs 1211, the other found in Proverbs 28, 19, they both say pretty much the same
 thing. Those who work their land will have abundant food, but those who chase fantasies have no sense.
 Or those who chase fantasies will have their fill of poverty. And that's the thing where like,
 "Oh, in this fantasy rich wonderful world, I'm quite content to work hard for that dream,
 but I don't work hard in the land that I have right now.
 And the right of a proverb is saying it doesn't work that way.
 Proverbs 14, 23 says this all hard work brings a profit,
 but mere talk leads only to poverty.
 The truth is you practice working hard where you are right now.
 Yes.
 And that's hard because it seems so detached from your dreams.
 Yeah, but I mean, when I look back, of course, hindsight is 20, 20.
 and we are in full-time ministry,
 and we are doing a job that we're designed for.
 But I've done plenty of jobs
 that were nowhere near the dream.
 I served tables for 14 years,
 and then I worked for a corporate business for five years,
 and none of those things were the dream.
 But I don't know that I could have been happy
 going in and giving less than 100%.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's the thing that people don't understand
 that every job has sucky parts to it.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>It really does.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I forget who it was, was it Danielle?
 said everyone needs a would you like fries with that season one of our friends said I think
 everybody needs an apple bees season in their life apple bees is a restaurant you probably
 want to aspire to work at but you know so yeah I think it was Danielle so here's Danielle our
 wonderful school administrator but after she graduated from college she's highly educated
 highly employable and she couldn't find a job so she just worked at apple bees and I think
 everybody needs a season like that where you learn hard work without any visible return on those
 benefits. Yeah, and you get to find out where you're really made of. I think that's one of the
 seasons where you find out where your character really is. Are you going to be able to serve somebody
 else, do a great job, and not grumble and just get on with it? Right. You mentioned earlier that
 we love our job and Confucius, the great Chinese philosopher, said, "Choose a job you love,
 and you'll never have to work a day in your life." Now, I get the point he's making. We work very
 harder our jobs, the differences we absolutely love it. But the truth is we learned the part
 of working hard in jobs we didn't love. For many, many years. That skill set got cultivated
 elsewhere. Before we were in ministry, when I worked for restaurants, and again,
 restaurants is not your glamour job, I couldn't be proud of me if I
 I was giving less than 100 percent.
 Right.
 Because that's, I'm not built to live at 80 percent or 70 percent.
 And I don't think you're going to impact other people living like that or working
 like that either.
 Thomas Edison said it like this, what you are will show in what you do.
 Yeah.
 And I, I fully agree even when I was a school teacher and didn't love being a
 school teacher, though it's still the same care.
 There wasn't the passion, but there was the same care, attention to detail and
 diligence as I have preparing work for students that I am passionate about now.
 Yeah. And, you know, it's about that thing of my mom used to quote this verse all of the time,
 Colossians 3 23, whatever you do, work at it with all your heart as working for the Lord,
 not for human masters. Right. And if you truly believe, which I do, that there's no difference
 between the spiritual and the secular, then it really shouldn't matter what you're doing right
 now because it's all training for your future you. I was, when we were talking about this
 earlier, I was saying about when I interviewed to work for National, I knew from the Lord,
 or I had heard from the Lord in five years, he'll be in full-time ministry.
 And I knew that going into the interview. So I knew I was going in and interviewing for
 position that they wanted to spend several years training me. And so when I sat down with the VP,
 I said, you know, they went through the whole program and what it would all look like and
 and everything. And I said, I need you to know, I feel like in five years, I'll be in full-time
 ministry. But for the next five years, I'll give you 150%. But I just want to be honest
 with you that that's what I feel like, where my life is going. And, you know, even in that
 job from where I started to where I finished, I got promoted eight times. But again, I went
 in there like that was my mission field. And this is where God has me. And I get to give
 my hundred and you know, 10, 150% here today. I think it a lot of it. I think God's looking
 at our attitudes when we're when everything's not going our way, because it'll give us a good,
 it'll give him a good indication of what we're going to be like when everything is going our way.
 Yeah, there's a verse in 1 Corinthians 15 verse 58, it says this, always give yourself fully to
 the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain. We tend to think
 that that verse is just for the missionaries and the pastors. But again, if you believe that
 everything that's before you is the work of the Lord, that's an encouragement to do it brilliantly,
 to work really hard, knowing that your labor isn't in vain. And that's the encouragement we try to
 give the young people who are coming to us going, "I'm tired of waiting tables. I feel like God's
 called me to acting or to writing or to songwriting or whatever." And you're like, "That's great.
 I'm sure that he has, but in the meantime serve your tables brilliantly.
 In the meantime, take out the trash.
 Yeah, be a good witness by doing your job with amazing vigor.
 Right.
 Realizing that you are currently investing into your future.
 You.
 Yeah.
 Here's the sneaky part of God.
 When you look forward, there's no guarantee there is a brilliant future.
 You're like, Lord, why am I busting tables like this sucks?
 Like, how does this make me a movie star?
 How does this make me insert whatever your dream job is?
 But the beauty is in retrospect, once you are what you're hoping God's
 called you to and you look backwards, you're like, Oh, I told you what God
 was doing with the busing table.
 Right.
 He was teaching me diligence or long hours on set or whatever.
 Right.
 And that's just the majesty of God.
 Yeah.
 Do you want to know a secret?
 Yes.
 It's a secret that I would probably attribute to anything good that I have
 achieved in life.
 Hit me.
 is found in Psalm 90 verse 17. It's the prayer of Moses. It says this, "May the favor of the Lord
 our God rest on us. Establish the work of our hands for us. Yes, establish the work of our hands.
 I have prayed that verse for years." Yeah.
 "If I, Lord, I'll show up and do the work, but could you establish the work of my hands for me?
 And with that, would you let your favor rest on me?" Yeah. When we were at dinner today,
 I was saying, I keep having this quote running through my head from the gladiator. That whole
 thing of what we do in life echoes in eternity.
 And I, you can, you can talk about that in a number of different ways.
 But I think one of the things that makes talking about God easier at work is if you
 are one of the workers that people can recognize that you give your 100%.
 Does that make sense?
 So I think like I got to lead people to the Lord.
 Almost every place I worked.
 Um, and you know, sometimes management, sometimes other servers,
 sometimes bartenders, whatever.
 But I think it was because you get an opportunity to live life in front of them,
 live life a hundred percent and a hundred percent you in love with God is a good
 thing to come and contact with.
 That's brilliant.
 Yeah.
 Here's a verse that everybody loves Proverbs to 29.
 Do you see someone skilled in their work?
 They will serve before kings.
 They will not serve before officials of low rank.
 You know, many people want to serve before kings.
 And many people want to be super skilled in the work, but few want to do the work
 required to be skilled.
 We tend to write off other people's success because we think they're talented,
 not skilled.
 Stephen King, who, you know, forget what he does for a living,
 ring horror books, he is actually very successful.
 He said this, talent is cheaper than table salt.
 What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work.
 Like when I think about the different people I admire or have admired in different
 stages of life, it's never been the people that lie on the couch or the people
 that grumble and complain.
 You know, it's, they've always been people that have worked hard for things
 that they're passionate about or just been hard workers in general.
 And the Lord has honored that.
 You want to quote stand with?
 Sure.
 Thomas Edison said this opportunity is missed by most people because it
 dressed in overalls and looks like work.
 You're like the quote maester tonight.
 Let me tell you, I'm just, I open up my quote book and pulled some favorites out.
 Thomas Jefferson said this, "I'm a great believer in luck and I find the harder I work, the
 more I have of it."
 Here's a problem that you and I both face as people who love to work hard, is we begin
 to, after a season of working very hard, we begin to lose perspective.
 Yeah.
 So many times we've had to go to Jeff and go, hey, could you have some perspective?
 We have no idea if we're doing a good job or not.
 We're just caught up in doing without actually evaluating if what we're doing is helpful.
 Right.
 So maybe we need to revisit on the podcast, the whole topic of rest.
 I think that would be really good because we're heading into the Christmas season and I'm so looking forward to resting.
 Same.
 But we tend to run in, you know, marathon like sprints.
 Yeah.
 Busy, busy, busy, busy rest.
 The trick is not to die doing that.
 perhaps we would be better suited at pacing our hard work.
 Food for you to think about.
