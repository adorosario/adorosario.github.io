<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses.<br/>
 Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 Yes, Mr. Jones.<br/>
 And your messy bun.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And your shirt says messy bun coffee, hugs, mom life.
 Mom life.<br/>
 I wanna redeem at least one of them later, one hugs.
 Yeah.<br/>
 (laughing)<br/>
 Well, the only other things to redeem are
 coffee and mom life. Yeah. Episode 257. Yeah. We got a lot to
 catch up on. We do. Because it feels like our life is picked up
 to a pace that I remember being pre pandemic. Yes. Tell us
 what's been happening last week. I went and did a women's retreat
 with like my favorite ladies up in St. Louis. They're my St. Louis
 family. Haven't you done that that women's retreat like 149
 times in a row? No, no. I mean, I haven't been in like two or three years, three years,
 I think. But I did like seven years in a row or something. And it was so great. What did
 you do? To be back with them. We did the father heart. They wanted me to come and just,
 you know, go back to what we did the very first time and talk about the father heart.
 And it was, it was wonderful. You took a team of ladies with you? I did. Wonderful team.
 a great profit set up a little storm and but I mean mostly it was just I love those ladies.
 They're so they're so great. That's wonderful. Yeah. While you were away,
 Abby and Tia were away on a youth retreat to your Coe River, is that right? Yeah.
 Yeah. They went white water rafts. We're Tia dumped out of the raft and Shailie saved her.
 Thank you Shailie for that. Appreciate it. We love you. Yeah. And so while you just
 just spent all the girls in the house for a way.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So me and MJ were very excited.
 We might mention this on the podcast before.
 Wednesday night is "Bro Night" at the Jones household.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because you're often teaching away
  </li><li>And MJ lives for "Bro Night".
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the girls have used their Wednesday night.
 So when MJ figured out,
 me and him were gonna be home all weekend,
 he wanted a bro we can.
 So I thought this was gonna be great.
 I said, "Son, write down everything you want to do."
 And he came up with an amazing list, a killer list.
 But my favorite one was that he wanted to sit shirtless,
 watch a movie and drink beer.
 Which is funny 'cause neither was drink beer.
 So I don't know where he got that idea from.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So he inquired when he's like,
 can I actually drink beer?
 I was like, probably not till you're 21.
 So we could drink root beer.
 He's like, oh yeah, that would work.
 So I went and got a four pack of Virgil's root beer,
 which he'd never had before.
 And he liked it.
 And then, true to his words, we took off her shirts
 and watched a movie while drinking root beer.
 But then it was so cold.
 Yeah.
 He got under a blanket.
 And I was like, can I just put my shirt back on?
 He's like, yeah.
 We had so much fun.
 You know, we had like, you know, he had play date set up.
 We had a gaming marathon set up.
 We had he had.
 He went to Desanos.
 Oh, yeah.
 Well, he already knew all the food places he went to.
 He had me clean out the garage and I paid him.
 And he said, this was a valuable lesson, Daddy.
 I learned that you can do manual labor for money.
 I was like, yes, yes, you can.
 Which he immediately spent on V-Bucks
 because he's in the Fortnite at the moment.
 And then Mr. Bill taught him how to shoot.
 He went out and Mr. Bill had a BB gun
 and taught MJ how to shoot.
 Anyway, it was great weekend, boy.
  </li><li>Do you know why you said BB gun?
 You were like BB gun.
 Like I thought you were gonna say like BB-8.
  </li><li>How should I say?
  </li><li>Like BB instead of BB.
 You're like, I don't know.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Was it my intonation?
 I should have gone down.
 BB.
  </li><li>You have BB.
 Rather than BB.
 You had a BB gun.
 That was last weekend.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then this weekend, we've, you know,
 it's often been said about me that I'm a man of the woods.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yes, it has.
  </li><li>And I just lived in my natural habitat.
  </li><li>Man of the derailleur video games of the woods.
  </li><li>This week we as a family went spent a week
 in one of our state parks.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>We rented an RV.
 I should back up, it started out as camping.
  </li><li>It did.
  </li><li>Do you remember?
 We would camp in the rustic spots.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 we realized, oh, that's all I knew about.
 We're camping in rustic spots, no electricity,
 no running water, nothing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Then we realized--
  </li><li>Which does, it is lovely, but it's so much more work.
  </li><li>So much more work.
  </li><li>And you're like lagging all your stuff in,
 lagging all your stuff back out, like just laying there.
  </li><li>Well, then we realized there's spots
 that you can just park at.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And there's a level ground and you pop up your tent.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And there's electricity.
 And that changed the game for us camping.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're like, oh, we can do,
 like one night even if we just have one night because you know drive up drive out
 and then when we realized that we were those lots of people in RVs and we were
 like huh whenever you get RVs from and you discovered outdoorsy.com yes just
 basically like Airbnb where you rent other people's RVs and so the last couple
 of times we've just gone to RVing yes which at that point you're not really
 camping yeah you might not be I spend the whole day outside where did you spend
 into the nighttime in an air-conditioned queen side bed.
 Yes.
 That is not a queen side bed, my friend.
 Was it not?
 Well, no, it's more like a full.
 If that's a queen, I'll eat my left foot.
 Don't eat your left foot.
 I'm partial.
 My acquaintance with your knee in my back
 or your elbow in my face all night long, that's no queen.
 But our being is weird.
 Like at one point, I thought, it's a weird concept
 because you leave your house to go stay in a place
 that's way less nice than your house.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>With none of the easy comforts that you have at home,
 like say fast internet,
 and you eat not as well as you do.
 Like it's basically at one point I woke up.
  </li><li>I beg your pardon, we had Philly,
 Manuel, we were away.
 We sous vide it.
 We brought our sous vide and had really good steak.
  </li><li>Which did you want?
 Did you want to?
 Like other people, they probably don't camp the way we camp.
 The reason we need to bring two vehicles
 is 'cause we bring things like our sous vide with us.
  </li><li>At least at one point, we need comment to don't.
 How's embracing the rustic nature of camping?
 As I think at that point,
 MJ and I had stayed indoors all day,
 just played on the Nintendo Switch on a flat screen TV.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Where I was going to is at some point,
 So you've got a family of five in a room, in a space.
 I don't think there's a room in our house
 that's as small as this space.
  </li><li>No, it's true.
 It's true. - That's why people are in.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And at one point.
  </li><li>And we would never sign up to be five days in that room.
  </li><li>And after day two, I'm looking around going,
 this feels like a college dormitory.
 Like it's just everywhere. - There's stuff everywhere.
  </li><li>Empty chip packets.
 But anyway, on paper, that as a vacation doesn't sound
 No. Did you want to talk about your iPhone controlled fire?
 Oh, I think we've covered that before.
 I think we've talked about that before.
 Yeah.
 Bluetooth control fires.
 Amazing.
 Yeah.
 And we also brought our son on a side door speaker.
 And yeah, my point is you wouldn't think on paper that camping would be
 restful.
 Yeah, but actually is highly rested.
 Oh, I love it.
 It's a lot of work, though, loading and unloading.
 The loading and unloading.
 Yes.
 But then once you get there, there's not a house to clean or anything
 that's yelling at you. It's just like nothing.
 There's kids yelling all the time.
 Well, yeah, but I mean, like that's different.
 You've got no sense in headphones and you're getting more of it.
 So, yeah, I loved it.
 You stayed in a hammock for most of the time.
 I spent a couple days in a hammock spent one whole morning.
 I brought my chair right down by the water.
 I saw that.
 Yeah, I spent a lot of time outside.
 I think what I love about that is all everybody
 as soon as they get to the campsite know what they want to do.
 So MG goes down and throws rocks in water.
 You go to hammock.
 I spent most of her time in a hammock, too.
 Just to do this in hammock.
 And then I'll sit by fire.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it's nice.
 Really nice.
 Yeah.
 Last night was cold, though.
 We were like dedicated, like we were going to spend time
 by this fire.
 And I ended up wrapping up in a sleeping bag and it was.
 Yeah.
 Pardon?
 But we went through so much wood last night.
 Yes.
 Anyway, just call me a light weight.
 Light weight.
 Yeah, like come on. That was a Scottish heat wave last night.
 You're like, oh, it's so cool.
 Cold. I'm like, it's like breeze of bears.
 It was cold. You had to put the heat on.
 It was like 40 degrees.
 I don't know what that means.
 OK, cool.
 I got a new video game.
 I don't know if you've noticed a new video game.
 I had noticed. Yeah.
 Yeah. Tell the people of what it makes you feel when I'm playing that video.
 Stressed, so stressed.
 So stressed.
 Just even just the sound like you can tell when you're in sections
 where there's this robot that's trying to kill you.
 Yeah, my mind is different.
 And I'm literally like, oh, like I will put on my my headphones
 and just put in like block out sound just to not hear that.
 It's a game called Metroid Dread, which I know nothing about.
 I just there was another two games I really loved,
 Ori and the Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisp,
 which I loved.
 And that is genre of game.
 The Metroid series kind of pioneered it.
 So I thought, well, if I like this, I'll like that.
 It is unforgiving actually I think met right to prime means just die over and over again over again
 I don't think I've ever died so many times in a video game and it is ruthless and it's only been out for a week and somebody's already
 100% of it. I think in like two and a half hours. They completed it in one and a half hours
 I still haven't finished it. I'm nowhere near close to 100%
 Yeah, but that's a good thing. I don't even I like watch it and go there's no part of me with I want to play this game
 it stresses me out. Yeah, well, we're back, relaxed, not stressed out.
 Yeah, so we had a great time camping. Indeed, we did. We did.
 When this episode comes out, yes, it comes out on a Monday, which means you only got about
 three days to sign up for something called the Boundaries Academy. Boundaries Academy
 is an opportunity for you to get live coaching with me all about boundaries in your own life.
 So you've heard us talk about boundaries before the podcast episode 25 and 236 I think for memory
 I'll put link in the show notes the proper ones but boundaries of this incredibly effective tool
 At helping you manage your limitations like every human has limitations
 That is impossible for you to meet everybody's needs
 And so if you don't have boundaries the only way
 to prevent yourself from being burned out is avoid people who are needy or
 just say yes to the people that you're too scared of saying no to.
 Both scary.
 All scary options.
 So actually understanding boundaries gives you back some of that power to manage
 your limitations really well and to help you honor other people's limitations.
 Yeah.
 In a nutshell, boundaries help you say no and hear no without entering a paralyzing
 fears.
 So good.
 I'm not even wearing a weird shirt and you're tuning out.
 What are you?
 It's it's that you're wearing the gray shirt that matches your gray hair.
 And I just kind of want to jump you that's all.
 It's a different course.
 But anyway, the Boundaries Academy, it's built on the Boundaries course that we've done.
 You you watch the videos during the week, you meet with me on Saturdays for about an hour for five weeks in a row.
 I'm going to help you apply all that teaching.
 And with Thanksgiving coming up, with Christmas coming up, these are usually
 times of the year.
 I want to help lower your anxiety in relationships and increase the health of your relationship.
 So if you'd like to do that, you've only got a couple of days.
 Wednesday, 27th of October is when the Boundaries Academy closes.
 Good.
 But what about the master class?
 The master class.
 Probably.
 Am I into trouble for saying this?
 Probably my favorite thing I've done this year is run the boundaries master class.
 Yeah.
 I know that because you would get so excited when it was about to start.
 It's such a privilege to create space for people to explore the story.
 Yeah.
 And that's what I did.
 We did the masterclass in July of this year, in the summer.
 Yeah, in the summer.
 We did the boundaries masterclass.
 I loved it.
 I can only take five students at a time.
 I've decided to run it again in the fall.
 And it's a pretty big commitment, some intense work.
 It basically takes everything I just told you about boundaries.
 It takes all the work that we've talked about last year about feelings,
 put them together and helps you explore your story.
 How has your story been written such that boundaries has either helped you or hindered you?
 Like having no boundaries.
 Like, where is having no boundaries shown up?
 Where is it stolen thing from you?
 Can you get in touch with it?
 How do you want to live life differently?
 Yeah.
 The reason I'm limited to five students is I want to give plenty of space
 for people to process their story.
 So good.
 We're using group dynamics.
 I love it.
 If you would like to be part of this year's cohort,
 five students, again, applications for the Boundaries
 Masterclass closes Wednesday, October 27th.
 I'd love you to do with me.
 It's such a joy.
 You remember how goody I was.
 Yes.
 And then you'd get off the call and be equally giddy afterwards.
 Yeah.
 I love it.
 And I would love you to come do it with me too.
 Perfect.
 All right.
 Our main topic for this week-- last week,
 We talked about five things we didn't know about marriage.
 And I had a lot of fun doing that.
 This week we're going to talk about five things
 we didn't know about having kids.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Are you going to go first?
 'Cause I went first last week.
  </li><li>Okay, that seems fair.
 Five things.
  </li><li>Yes, are yours written down?
 Are you just pulling five things out of your head?
  </li><li>No, I've written them down.
 I'm asking to look at my notes to remember
 which order they came in.
 Number one was I once heard a prophet say this cryptic phrase,
 every baby arrives with a loaf of bread under their arm.
  </li><li>Oh, that's good.
  </li><li>Do you remember that?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, so Jimmy Galloway, friend of ours,
 wonderful prophet,
 who's prophesying over some friends of ours,
 Richard and Michelle.
 And he said that phrase and I asked him,
 "Jimmy, what does it mean every baby arrives
 with a loaf of bread under their arm?"
  </li><li>'Cause I have to say, having given birth to three babies,
 I didn't see any loaves of bread.
  </li><li>He was talking about every baby
 arrives with the provision it needs.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I would say, again, before we discuss this,
 we are not saying that we're experts of parenting.
  </li><li>Oh yes, we're not.
  </li><li>And we have a 14 year old, a 12 year old,
 and an eight year old.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So there's a whole of parenting we haven't even
  </li><li>We haven't done yet.
  </li><li>You can stand into yet.
  </li><li>Yep, yep, yep.
  </li><li>But with that said, I would absolutely agree
 with that statement that every child arrives
 with a loaf of bread.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so the finances, the emotional capacity,
 the mental energy, the physical sustenance
 you need as a parent, I did not know
 that that would be provided.
 And I remember, I was thinking about this this week.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What were you gonna say?
  </li><li>I was just thinking, I was thinking,
 I remember when we used to be stressed about,
 like we had Abigail, then we found out you're pregnant
 with Tia, and I was like,
 am I gonna have enough love for Tia?
  </li><li>Serious question.
  </li><li>Like, you know, like, is it possible
 to love another human being as much as I love Abigail?
  </li><li>Yeah, and then--
  </li><li>And then-- - And then--
  </li><li>Tia gonna take away love from Abby.
  </li><li>Right, or like, yeah.
 And then, you know, by the time MJ comes along,
 you're just like, "Hey, the more the merrier,
 "your heart just expands."
 But yeah.
  </li><li>I was gonna say about,
 I remember when we found out you were pregnant,
 we didn't yet know Abigail was gonna be a girl.
 And I remember having somewhat crippling fear
 it was gonna be a boy and I wouldn't know what to do.
 'Cause I was the only boy I grew up with three sisters.
 I was like, I actually know how it would be with girls.
 I don't know how it would be with boys.
 It's not that I wasn't confident in my masculinity
 my manhood, there was just so many things I hadn't worked out yet in my head about
 me as a man and can I pass on those lessons to a son? Do you remember that? I remember
 I had that. And again, you know, Abigail was there and then Atia was there and I don't
 know if I had more inner healing or whether the Lord just spoke peace to my heart or I
 realized that the first two went well with, but I remember when MJ came, I remember being
 settled in my heart. But I remember not being settled in my heart when Abigail was coming
 I'm like, what if I can?
 And of course I didn't know that a loaf of bread comes.
 That was number one.
  </li><li>Love it.
  </li><li>This is where I have to look at my notes
 'cause I thought I could remember them,
 but I chopped them down.
 See, I'm a firm believer that your mind
 is for having ideas not holding on to them.
 So I write down everything so I don't have to remember them.
 Number two, praise God for this one,
 is kids are incredibly resilient.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I don't think I was aware of that,
 but emotionally, even physically, they're super resilient.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>They're robust.
  </li><li>I've got one of the scariest videos ever.
 We had some friends who will remain nameless,
 staying at our house, and they had a very small child.
  </li><li>Oh, I can't.
  </li><li>Under two, maybe one, one and a half.
  </li><li>Yeah, probably. - It was walking.
 But we have a flight of stairs with cameras all over our house.
 And I just hear this scream as an older sister screams
 watching her younger sister literally car wheel down--
 down the flight stairs to the hardwood floors.
 Yeah.
 And I've got all in video and I watched it.
 And I'm amazed that she was OK, because--
 Just perfectly fine.
 Horrible to watch it.
 Horrible.
 Horrible.
 It was terrifying.
 But--
 It still makes me sick.
 I remember you sending the video a couple of months ago,
 like, hey, do you remember this little nugget?
 And you sent it to them.
 And I can't watch it.
 Yeah.
 But in the same way that your kids are more resilient
 than I would imagine, I'm just so grateful that kids
 a really emotionally resilient.
 As in, I think about the times,
 like my saddest regret as a parent,
 is times where I've said the wrong thing,
 been impatient, snapped,
 but what I've realized and what I've learned from history
 is that if you hunger yourself, if you go your kids,
 if you own your mistake, if you apologize,
 if you ask for forgiveness,
 don't think we ever taught them,
 like, no, forgiveness is good and you need to.
  </li><li>Then you have to.
  </li><li>Even before we ever explained why forgiveness was important,
 they were so generous in their forgiveness
 and in their giving nature.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's one of mine too, on my list.
  </li><li>Did you see all my notes?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>No, I'm just kidding.
 That's what we said to me last week.
 So yeah, just the resilience of kids I love.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>Number three, I love this.
 I remember once watching an interview with Grim Cook,
 and he was asked a question about parenting.
 I don't really remember the answer,
 But I remember him saying this phrase about, you know,
 one of the things he's loved about parenting
 is that you need different parenting skills
 for different seasons of your kid's lives.
 Like just in the natural ages.
 And I've loved every age of parenting.
 Again, we have 14, 12 and eight year old.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I've loved that it requires different things.
 I love that we are navigating,
 how do you parent a 14 year old?
 'Cause you certainly don't parent them like an eight year old
 and you don't parent them like a 12 year old.
 Sometimes they need something in one season of the day
 and sometimes they need--
 Yeah, 14 feels tricky because they're not really,
 she's still a little girl in some ways and in some ways,
 she's not.
 No, she's an adult and just leave me alone.
 Yeah, I mean--
 So learning that is fun.
 I mean, I was gonna say my favorite stage is four-year-old.
 I don't think it is.
 I think my favorite stages
 will ever age your kids are at the moment,
 but I loved when kids were four.
 or our kids were four.
 There's just such a cute face,
 but I've loved all the different sides
 of having to be a parent.
 And I wasn't prepared for that.
 I just thought you're a parent.
 Like it's a flat one-dimensional thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it's not.
 It requires completely different scales
 and completely different things.
  </li><li>And really each kid is different.
 Like in many ways you're parenting them the same way
 or with the same values,
 But they, because they're different human beings
 and they respond differently, they actually require.
  </li><li>And they all turn out differently.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Number four.
 I knew this.
 I understood this in a concept,
 but I didn't know it in experience.
 'Cause I hadn't had kids.
 Chip,
 which chip is the boundaries person?
 Chip Judd.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 Chip Dodd is the feelings person,
 Chip Judd is boundaries.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>I remember Chip Judd saying,
 Parenting is the hardest job you'll ever have.
 And I remember it was before we were married,
 we didn't have kids, I thought,
 okay, I really trust you,
 I'll make a mental note of that,
 don't quite know what that means.
 And I don't think it means parenting is the hardest job,
 like my gosh, you're constantly fatigued
 and exhausted and your life gets sucked out of you.
 In many ways, parenting is like the most rewarding job
 I've ever had, like it's amazing.
  </li><li>But it's 24/7.
  </li><li>It's 24/7 and it's hard
 because you're not your best self 24/7.
 Like I think even today,
 I would say we had a great weekend,
 like from a parenting perspective, this whole week being away was absolutely wonderful.
 I really enjoyed being with the kids, seeing all my nerves.
 It was great.
 I felt like I showed up really, really well.
 I'm tearing everything down and packing everything today.
 And I forget what I'm trying to do.
 Oh, I'm trying to put one of the tables in the back of the minivan.
 I've overextended my back.
 The bit, the flattened down table is not going in because it's taking something.
 I'm trying to do that without putting my back out.
 I can feel it, you know, leveraging and AMJ is just like,
 Hey dad, hey dad, why don't we have a nice,
 can you sign with you, don't we,
 and I just remember snapping and you're like,
 MJ, like can you, you know, like can you stop being
 a child and having needs is basically what,
 you know, trying to say, but, you know,
 I just snap, like I'm trying to, you know,
 why aren't you using the wherewithal
 that you haven't developed yet?
 'Cause you're only eight, like, you know,
 I'm frustrated that you're having needs in my presence.
 And I just remember like, I've ruined everything.
 You know, his whole week will be moored by,
 I would say the most mental energy,
 I expand pushing away negative thoughts,
 all has to do with parenting.
  </li><li>Mm.
  </li><li>Like I don't often battle negative thoughts.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like I have a fairly positive outlook on life.
 But probably the area where I do the most mental warfare
 is regarding parenting.
 Like the constant, not constant fear
 like I'm awake at night,
 but if I allow my mind to settle on parenting,
 I'm just like, oh my God, what if I'm just going out my kids?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like, oh my God, what if, you know.
  </li><li>Right.
 Because here's the thing, you don't have a clue what you're doing.
 No.
 You literally don't have a clue what you're doing.
 No.
 I mean, you have more of a clue with, we have more of a clue with Tia and with MJ
 than we do with Abigail.
 Like Abigail.
 So you don't know what you're doing, how it's going to end up.
 Yeah, that's true.
 You know, when your kids are 20 or 30, how much of how they are is because of you
 and how much of your parenting.
 And then I, you know, you compare yourself to the parents you had.
 Yeah.
 So like my mom invested so much stuff on us,
 which I've actually deliberately chosen
 to go in an opposite direction.
 What I mean by that is my mom would invest so much time
 in taking us to museums and try to instill love of culture
 and all those things.
 And I loathed every single bit of it.
 So I think it's point number five I'm gonna come to,
 but I've moved in the opposite direction and even then.
 Who knows?
 Who knows?
 Am I like parenting in a reactionary way
 or an intentional way?
  </li><li>But I think that's where you have to do the very best you can
 and trust that the Holy Spirit's gonna take care of the rest.
  </li><li>But that's a scary bore, like the very best I can.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Do you know how much time I spent watching YouTube today
 that I could have been doing something with the kids?
  </li><li>The best you can.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>The best, but again, like what is the best?
 Like, I think it's hard because there's no check marks,
 there's no grades, there's nothing you can evaluate yourself on.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you and I know, 'cause we've spent years
 with young adults who might've been high achieving
 eyes of the world, but their parents messed them up because they pushed them.
 So like, I don't know.
 I like Jack Frostline that, you know, I stopped saving up for my kids, you know,
 university.
 So I started saving up for an inner healing.
 Yeah.
 And you know, we were, we had a, we had a therapist come and speak to our staff,
 you know, our all staff last month.
 Yeah.
 And he was just like, Hey guys, even the most well-intentioned parents are
 still going to screw up their kids.
 Right.
 Like it's going to happen.
 And I'm like, yeah, okay.
 So not, not that that's a license to not care, but it is a
 license to give yourself some grace.
 Yeah.
 And that's where I lie on that one.
 Okay.
 Number five.
 Number five was all about your kids are a gift.
 Yeah.
 Like parenting is a gift.
 You were talking about that whole thing of like we've parent
 and all of our kids the same way.
 I mean, I guess, right?
 It's at least the same parents and they've all turned out completely
 differently.
 Yes.
 And I was talking about- - Well, they're all lovely kids,
 but yeah, they've all got different personalities.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, but they're all very different children.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I was thinking about, you know,
 just what I was coming to him before,
 like my mom's intentional effort for like,
 let's go for a family walk.
 Like, my mom was always like incentivizing
 and being intentional with parenting.
 And I'm not sure how much of it,
 it certainly didn't work with me.
 Like I had a bad reaction,
 'cause it just felt like being shepherded
 or managed way for it there is, ladies and gentlemen.
 Can we have a play back on that one, please?
  </li><li>I just did the spectacular yawn,
 where to sleep a yawn.
  </li><li>I cut it short though, that's not gonna serve me well
 'cause it means I'm gonna, ah, ah, Chris, there it is.
  </li><li>No, now you, now you.
  </li><li>Play back Chris, play back.
  </li><li>Now you've cursed me.
  </li><li>Wait, wait, here it is.
  </li><li>Stop.
 Anyway, with like, I think that one of the things
 I'm most happy about in my parenting,
 or my approach to parenting, which again,
 I can't even be happy about it
 because I don't know if it's produced good dividends or not,
 is the amount of space I've given my kids.
 As in, I haven't tried to steer my kids into anything,
 but I've tried to support them wherever they've entered
 wandering into.
 So we didn't get Abby music lessons or singing lessons.
 We didn't say, "Hey, you know what would be good for you
 "to do, you should do this, you should do that."
 But she just ended up loving music,
 and she taught herself this.
 And as we realized, okay, you've gravitated towards this,
 you spent some time here, let's do some resources.
 Yeah, so you really like music?
 Okay, I know how to use logic.
 I'll show you how to use logic and GarageBand.
 And hey, there's a sale, let's pick up some microphones
 and I'm trying to feed what I see is interesting to her.
 Same with Tia, we weren't like,
 you know what, you'd be a great artist.
 Tia spends hours just drawing,
 so let's get you an iPad and an Apple pencil.
 And she figured out how to use procreate.
 And MJ, we didn't say, right, MJ,
 you're gonna be a pro gamer.
 But that's what he wants to do, by the way.
 He wants his own YouTube channel and he's going to be a pro gamer.
 Oh, I'm aware.
 But look at the joy in our kids and look at the creativity that's come out with them.
 And I don't think either of us planned that for them.
 We just created space for them and try to meet them wherever they were at.
 And they're a total source of joy.
 So there's my five things.
 All right.
 Well, hang on, but I also want to say before I had my own kids, other people's
 kids were just super annoying.
 So I just, I did wonder like, are having your own kids.
 Is it just like more annoying, more of the time?
 But it's not.
 It's totally joyful having kids.
 Yeah.
 I, I, uh, I would say I didn't enjoy other people's children as much as I enjoy my own.
 Because there was kids that I did like being around, but there was also kids I didn't.
 Yeah, just kids in general.
 I was like, um, all right.
 Are you ready for my number one?
 I'm so ready.
 So when we, when we had babies, we did baby wise.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the very first chapter of that book,
 the guy makes a statement and he says,
 "The best thing you can do for your parenting
 is to have a great marriage."
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>And that has like stuck in my head.
 I remember my aunt, Joan and uncle Paul,
 they had eight kids and they still always had a date night
 on Thursday nights.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>They just prioritize their marriage
 'cause they're like, hey, actually having a stable home
 where your kids can tell that mommy and daddy love each other
 actually goes a long way for all of the parenting stuff.
  </li><li>I guess that makes sense,
 but I would never have thought about that for babies.
 Like I could see like childhood development for sure,
 but babies like it.
  </li><li>Well, they pick up everything.
 They're feeling everything.
 So it makes sense. - Limit presence.
  </li><li>Yeah, yep.
 So that was my number one.
  </li><li>Whoa, that's something you didn't know, but now you know.
  </li><li>Yes. - How does that show up today?
 Well, I mean, I think we have an amazing marriage.
 And I think the kids are they feel safe and confident.
 And you know, like there's not any kind of iffyness about their situation or our
 home life or any of that.
 And they I I'm hoping that they're seeing a healthy marriage and that's going to be
 what they want.
 I modeled that for MJ today.
 I was teaching them how to French kiss.
 I was like, you watch this going to make out with your mother.
 He did. He's cheering me on. Go, daddy.
 And you were a very willing participant.
 Thank you. Thank you.
 Go strong marriages.
 So concerning.
 Number two is the Holy Spirit knows the answers.
 So there's been so many times, particularly before the kids can actually speak in sentences,
 where you're like, I have no idea why this child is crying or what is happening right now.
 or do you like do I take them to the doctors or is this just gas or you know like all the you know of
 Parenting especially when they can't tell you anything
 But the Holy Spirit always knows what's going on so Jeff dollars. That's like this
 He's like the Lord's got your kids. Yeah, cuz you know again being a parent there's so much stuff that's unknown
 You know, it's one long game of trust. Yeah, like okay. God you've you've you've got this. Yeah
  </li><li>Right?
  </li><li>But even in like, you know, even in, okay,
 baby is crying, I don't know what's going on.
 I remember the Lord saying stop eating broccoli.
 Like, and I was like, that's random.
 Like never thought of that.
  </li><li>With what? - With Abby.
 I had to stop eating broccoli and she stopped having gas.
 Like things like that where I was like, I have no idea
 what, you know, why she's in pain, why she's, you know,
 kind of, you know, collicky or whatever.
 And the Holy Spirit be like, you know, don't eat this
 or do this or whatever.
 Like, you know what I mean?
 So it's things like as little as that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And, you know, as big as, you know,
 that form of discipline isn't gonna work with this child.
 You know, that kind of stuff.
 So yeah, the Holy Spirit knows the answers.
 All right, number three.
  </li><li>All right, number three, take it away, baby.
  </li><li>Get used to saying the same thing
 over and over and over again.
  </li><li>Over the long of holes, holy.
 And it just doesn't feel like that stopped,
 even though the four G, we have a 14 year old.
  </li><li>But we have a new tactic now.
 Instead of repeating ourselves.
  </li><li>We're doing a taser.
  </li><li>No, not taser darling.
 We have a new tactic, which is like,
 did you hear my answer?
 Did you understand my answer?
 Do you need clarification on the answer?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because that will be like, hey, can we do this?
 No, but what about this?
 What about this?
 Oh, did you hear my answer?
 Yeah.
 Do you understand?
  </li><li>Well, I don't even mean those kinds of things
 'cause that's more like the negotiating anything.
  </li><li>Oh, you just mean just the general practice
 like clean your teeth.
  </li><li>Hey, brush your teeth.
 Hey, did you brush your teeth?
 Hey, you need to brush your teeth.
 Why am I still telling my 14 year old
 they have to brush their teeth?
 I have no idea.
  </li><li>Well, tell them what new rule
 and you instituted this week.
  </li><li>If they've forgotten to brush their teeth,
 I charge them $5 'cause I'm done.
 Mummy's done.
  </li><li>Mummy's making bang.
  </li><li>So they're feeding my latte habit.
 It's not for like other things, it's for things that are like, you know,
 duh, brush your teeth.
 And we've tried everything.
 We have checklists that they have to check out and fill in.
 Yeah.
 The greatest one, and by greatest one, I mean, the most recent one on an example is,
 are the youth retreat that our kids went on.
 I don't want to shame my kids, but let's just say some of the children in my household
 were going on our youth retreat.
 We're not saying which ones.
 are youth leaders who are brilliant sent out a color-coded checklist of what they'd need.
 I mean, it was perfect.
 Like, you know, from the administration and anticipation perspective.
 Perfect.
 From the execution.
 And I even printed out a copy.
 I sent PDFs to the kids electronically.
 Yes.
 And I printed out stuff so they could check them off.
 Yeah.
 And I had the foolishness to ask them, have you followed the checklist to which
 theoretically the children replied, yes.
 and perhaps theoretically I said, well, let's check that and they haven't.
 And I don't believe they were lying to me.
 I think they had the main things that she did, but stuff must have just fallen out of her bag.
 So like parents are more experienced than us.
 And help us with that one because.
 Yeah, so you didn't think that you would have to say things over and over again.
 No, not as many times.
 No, like no.
 The writing was kind of on the wall, though, because one of the things that has amazed me in leading people.
 Yes.
 And leading a school in young adults, young adults specifically.
 As a general rule of thumb question mark, people don't listen.
 Yeah, you repeat yourself all day long.
 It's what pastoring feels like.
 It's just parenting older people.
 Like it's video announcements, emails, spoken word.
 Like you've tried to hit the auditory visual and still people go,
 I don't know that event was happening or I didn't know it was due today.
 Yeah.
 And I don't think people are lying.
 I think I don't know what it is.
 And I'm like, I, you know, it feels like that affects everybody,
 except a very small part of the population.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 So maybe I started with children.
 Anyway, parents out there who know how to fix that.
 Please let us know.
  </li><li>My number four, you already covered.
  </li><li>No, but tell me, I wanna hear your perspective.
  </li><li>So it was just, you will make mistakes
 and just get good at apologizing when you do.
 Basically, kids are resilient,
 but own your, like own when you've made a mistake
 or you've snapped at them
 or you've missed their hearts in something
 and that makes you a safe person to come to
 with their hearts.
  </li><li>I've also modeling that as grownups as well.
 Like times when we have, you know,
 either disrespecting one another or being short with one another and the kids have seen it,
 like going out in the home.
 We apologize in front of them, yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Unapologizing that.
 Yeah.
 We, it's not like we deliberately made a decision to not argue or to argue in front of the kids.
 I think we just try and live our life out loud anyway.
 Yeah.
 You know, otherwise you end up with this weird fraudulent versions of yourself.
 Yeah.
 And you know, your kids are going to pick up whatever you're trying to hide anyway.
 Yeah.
 Right?
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah, okay.
 Number five?
  </li><li>Well, kids love to laugh.
  </li><li>Wait, did you just make it up off the top here?
  </li><li>No, look, kids love to laugh.
  </li><li>Kids love to laugh.
  </li><li>Like I was just thinking like--
  </li><li>Well, you didn't know that about parenting?
  </li><li>Please remember my testimony.
 So like obviously, my heart's desire
 is that my testimony is not my children's
 and it hasn't been, thank you Jesus.
 But I think I'm often, I'm aware that I don't have a silliness gene.
 Like I don't tend to go for silly, but when you, like you lift up your shirt and
 shake your tummy and dance around the kitchen with them and all that kind of stuff.
 I mean, they, they, at the table, he decided to lift up his shirt and rub
 Red John is nipples. I don't even remember why. But oh my gosh.
 No idea why.
 They literally fell out of their chairs laughing.
 They're laughing so hard.
 I forget the point I'm front of illustrate, but it was overshadow.
 But I had my name.
 It was so funny, but just like, hey, actually laughter goes a long way.
 You know what I mean? Like, and I was thinking that tonight, like, I can't
 remember what they were all like defying about tonight, but I can't.
 You came in and did something.
 I don't know. You like often do stuff like put your shirt over their faces while
 they're sitting at the table and things like that. Yeah. Yeah.
 That's called suffocation.
 But just, you know, like I think I don't know. Like I think, Oh, yeah.
 Like, what does it do for your heart as a mother watching your kids?
 Oh, I love it. I love it. And and, you know, that this isn't what this list is
 about, but it's a total turn on when your kids are like having fun with their dad.
 I think dad, you're so sexy.
 You're such a great dad.
 You've got to stop at the table because it reverberates at the microphone.
 But you do have to keep talking about how I'm sexy.
 We went from ranch to nipples.
 Okay.
 That was not sexy.
 Not the ranch nipples.
 So you watching me make the kids laugh.
 Yes.
 Makes you want to jump me.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 We should do five things we didn't know about each other.
 What?
 Yeah.
 Anyway, that could be for a whole
  </li><li>That might be terrifying.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, parenting's been a wild ride.
  </li><li>It's been great.
  </li><li>It's been an absolute wild ride.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>On the topic of kids parenting,
 I've got a listening question for you.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>This one is from Jesse.
  </li><li>Hi, Jesse.
  </li><li>I have a question about the listeners question
 regarding Halloween at the end of your kindness episode.
 We don't participate in anything to do with Halloween,
 but now that both kids are in school
 and there's a Halloween party,
 We're not sure what to do with that.
 How have you handled your kids school parties?
 Do you keep them home from school that day?
 Let them dress up just for the school party?
 What do you do?
  </li><li>We have, so the school that my kids are at now,
 like the elementary school doesn't allow
 celebrating Halloween.
 So there are no Halloween parties.
  </li><li>So they do fall themed parties?
  </li><li>No, they don't even, they don't.
  </li><li>They do, like, they don't do parties per se,
 but they do.
  </li><li>Like they do fall themed things.
  </li><li>Yeah, exercises and stuff like that.
  </li><li>Yeah, but they don't do like ghost stories
 and all that kind of stuff.
 The previous school that we were at before this one,
 they did do Halloween parties.
 And so we just let the teachers know like,
 "Hey, we actually as a family, we don't celebrate Halloween."
 So we would, yeah, keep them home on Halloween
 if Halloween was--
  </li><li>Did we do that while we were in the room?
  </li><li>Yeah, we did. - Yeah, we did.
  </li><li>Yeah? - Okay, well this is why
 Age is good at answering these questions.
  </li><li>And we just tried to make it like a special thing,
 like I took the girls out for lunch or--
  </li><li>But also now that they're older,
 I don't even know what they're doing at Abbey School,
 but now that they're older,
 if there's things happening around that,
 we know why we don't celebrate it.
 They've got a value for that.
 Again, what we found with our kids
 is all they wanted was the chocolate.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we buy them a bag
 of whatever their favorite chocolate is.
  </li><li>Here's the thing that I want to encourage
 is that don't be religious
 about the things you're being religious about.
 And what I mean by that is,
 We're, we've made a stand to the ground
 that we're not gonna celebrate Halloween.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But we're not super religious about it.
 As in, it's not like a taboo topic.
 We don't not talk about it in the house.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>We've taught the kids to self-sensor.
 If there's TV shows that they like
 and there happens to be a Halloween episode,
 they automatically skip it.
 But we've, like, our value is not,
 don't celebrate Halloween.
 Our value is, isn't God good.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like we've majored on, God is good.
 And you know, the other thing, it's just,
 it's not a major focus of our life,
 not celebrating Halloween.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Is that right?
  </li><li>I can care.
  </li><li>All right.
 If you want to show notes for this week's episode,
