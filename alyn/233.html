<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Mr. Jones.
  </li><li>Mrs. Jones?
  </li><li>We are back.
  </li><li>We are back.
 Do you wanna know what the highlight of this week is?
 I'm so glad you asked, let me jump in.
  </li><li>Okay, what could it be?
  </li><li>The highlight of this week is I have a Tesla.
  </li><li>You do?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When Mr. Chris arrives on the scene,
 he's still like, what's that in your driveway?
 And I'm like, it's a Tesla.
  </li><li>It's the future.
 My favorite thing was I took a picture of it and sent it to my sisters.
 And I've got two sisters who are still in the UK and I send a late at night.
 So I walked this morning early and one of the messages from my sisters was like,
 I don't get what I'm looking at.
 It's a picture of a white car.
 Why are we excited?
 And then me and Caris, my sister who lives here,
 whose neighbor has a Tesla began talking all about the beauties of it.
 So go on.
 Ask me why I'm excited about Tesla.
 Why are you excited about Tesla?
 It practically drove me home.
 Which...
 I mean, how much attention you pay when you're driving actually makes me feel slightly better.
 I think that's why I need a Tesla because I have a very, very short attention span.
 So, AJ, for those of you who know,
 AJ does most of driving in a relationship for a good reason.
 Yes, because when we go on road trips, you say things like,
 "I wasn't really paying attention for the last 20 minutes.
 I don't even know what I was doing."
 And I'm like, "My three children are in the car. Okay, let's swap."
 I've never had a car accident.
 And I guess I guess something happens when I drive that it still works, but yeah,
 we need to get Tesla.
 For those of you who are like, yeah, you got a Tesla that's amazing.
 I don't have a Tesla.
 I'm boring a Tesla for about 10 days.
 I have a friend who's gone out of town and and it's purely altruism on my
 poor. I'm looking after and maybe some of the stuff.
 Oh, yeah.
 Huge thing.
 It's sacrificial.
 That's all it is for sure.
 But you weren't excited about it for like the last several weeks.
 knowing that you were going to get to borrow it for a week.
 Yeah, I love to give.
 Yeah.
 That's just me just serving hard.
 It's amazing.
 Really.
 Yeah.
 So I'm trying to find excuses.
 I'm like, gee, me go to the grocery store.
 Oh, I'm taking full advantage of this for the next week.
 Because normally it's like, hey, babe, can you go into and you're like,
 oh, can you can you go do it?
 So now I'm going to be like, hey, babe, can you go do here's a list of things for you to do
 in the Tesla.
 Mm-hmm.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Can daddy have them?
 Um, no.
 No, I'm okay.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, my sister was like, is that yours?
 I'm like, yeah, it's like a $120,000 card.
 No, it's not.
 But yes, yes, a man can dream.
 And then how's that happen this week?
 I mean, it's all overshadowed by Tesla.
 I mean, this is like pandemic life.
 We didn't eat anywhere.
 Wouldn't go anywhere.
 Yeah, we really didn't.
 We thought about it.
 It was nice weather.
 Yeah.
 But right now, I wanted to eat outside the other day, but right now we're in
 carpenter bee season, which they swoop us like they're constantly at work.
 But a boom. I didn't know what carpenter bees were to like out here.
 Yeah, I didn't either, but they're eating our deck.
 I don't care. I never go out on it.
 Okay. Well, you might care eventually.
 Don't you buy like those ridiculous trap from Amazon?
 I have traps.
 And you fill with Mountain Dew.
 Well, here's the thing.
 I forgot to empty the dead bees out of it from last season.
 (laughs)
 And then I went out a couple days ago
 to try and unscrew the bottle off the bottom.
  </li><li>But it's just seas.
  </li><li>I can't get it.
  </li><li>Well, it's all sugar and then just, a hard one.
  </li><li>No, I don't put sugar in them.
  </li><li>You put Mountain Dew in them.
  </li><li>I haven't, I did that the first season.
  </li><li>What did you put the night?
  </li><li>Nothing, they just wanna go in there
 'cause they're made out of wood
 and they have little holes in them.
 It's like a carpenter bee tricky trap.
 I spray like a hormone on them that the bees want.
 That's all I do.
 Do you spray a hormone on me that I want to get me to do things?
 If I do, it's not working that well.
 You just need a Tesla and then I'll be happy to say.
 Uh huh.
 Uh huh.
 Well, that was the easiest weekly recap ever.
 Tesla Tesla Tesla.
 Our topic for this week.
 Yes.
 It's probably the longest title we've ever had in a podcast.
 It's called how to see your prophetic words come to pass.
 Can't you make it a little bit longer?
 because that's fine. It kind of felt like a letdown over there.
 You try.
 You just when you turn it into an acronym, it's the longest title
 we've ever had. I'm expecting something like a couple of years.
 Epic. Our titles were only like one word.
 And then I realized that's really hard to condense.
 You know what you're talking about into one word.
 So it's how to see your prophetic words come to pass.
 Again, this is coming from my lazy marker research about what, you know,
 what would people read a book about if I wrote one?
 And this is one of the topics I was like, well, you know what, instead of writing a book about it, we'll just talk about how do you see your prophetic words come to pass.
 Yes.
 Before we jump in and talk about how we see a prophetic word come to pass, two guiding principles, like two overarching principles for everything.
 Like number one, 90% of prophetic words given today are invitations.
 Yes.
 So think about that.
 It's got to say, hey, do you want to?
 Right.
 Yes.
 And then your prophetic words, generally speaking, indicate the direction that you need to be going in,
 but it certainly doesn't give the instructions of how together.
 No, almost never do the instructions come along with it.
 I mean, sometimes they do, but largely speaking, it's just a direction.
 You know, God speaks in vagueness.
 Like if you, there's so many amazing prophetic words in the Old Testament, especially messianic prophecies,
 but they could have been way, way, way, way more detailed than God chose not to.
 Not because he's stingy, but because he's inviting us in a relationship and journey and all on foot.
 Yeah, I think it's more about that.
 Like, I think it's more about God's more about the journey than the destination.
 Yeah.
 And we tend to be more about the destination than the journey.
 Like, we almost resent the journey and are just trying to hit the destination.
 Speak for yourself.
 I'm all about the scenic row and yeah, I'm not driven just to get where I'm supposed to go.
 Watch for lightning, darling.
 So there you go.
 Two overarching things to think about with your prophetic words is that they're
 They're invitational, which is a big one,
 because for years I used to think,
 well, this is a prophetic word that will come true,
 not realizing I'm supposed to partner
 with the Lord to bring it about.
 They're invitational and they're,
 while they're directional,
 they're just merely pointing you like a compass
 on a way to go.
 It's not outlaying the steps that you need to take.
 So think about your prophetic words
 and share with us with some wisdom
 about how to partner with the Lord
 to see your prophetic words come to pass.
  </li><li>Are you speaking to me?
 Like I--
  </li><li>No, our special guest.
 (laughing)
 Invisible person.
 Think about your prophetic--
  </li><li>He said so.
 Think about your prophetic, and I thought,
 oh, you're speaking to those people
 that are listening as a person.
  </li><li>No, I'm speaking to my co-hosts.
  </li><li>Okay, so to me, think about my prophetic words,
 got you. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Well, I think, I think because prophecy is an invitation,
 the first part of it is saying yes.
 You know, it's realizing there's usually
 Yes. And then potentially an action that goes with that.
 Yes.
 And I think sometimes the action is a heart preparation and sometimes it's
 practical things.
 What do you do if you don't know what you're saying? Yes.
 Do I'm thinking about the prophetic word that we got to move to Nashville?
 Yes.
 Like we'll tell a story in a little bit more detail, but basically,
 well, it makes what tell a story now.
 we were we had felt from the Lord looking at our prophetic words all the prophetic words talked
 about pastoring and church planting and so we were like we're like we don't know anything about
 either of those things and so we just had to talk to John and Carol our pastors at the time in
 front of him and they said what do you think God's got a few necks and we said well funny you should
 ask all our prophetic words say church planting pastoring and so John and Carol excitedly said
 why don't we all plan a church together in America and it was a dream come true I love America this
 This is when we lived in Canada.
 It's like, absolutely.
 And John and Carol were like,
 we really felt like God's doing something in Florida.
 Why don't you come down to Florida with us
 and we'll just spend a couple of days praying.
 And so we went down, we spent a couple of days praying.
 None of us heard anything.
  </li><li>Well, we felt like, yeah, it's not, this isn't it.
  </li><li>Yeah, why did we come here?
 And we're driving around and then Carol tells a vision
 that she sees about America, three red pins dropping in America,
 one in Florida, one in North Carolina,
 and one in Nashville.
 And as soon as she says Nashville, we said--
  </li><li>We will do Nashville.
  </li><li>We'll do Nashville.
 And we could totally feel the Holy Spirit on that
 and we all like toasted to the Holy Spirit.
 And then I left that meeting going,
 what does we'll do Nashville mean?
 Like we'd said yes to something,
 but we didn't know what it was.
  </li><li>Right, and it wasn't really our personalities,
 either one of us, to without thinking everything through,
 'cause we're both very high contemplators
 to say something like, we'll do Nashville,
 what we both said it like in an instant.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I also remember getting out of the car
 right after that whole scenario.
 And you and John went to go park the car
 and I was holding Abby and I turned to Carol
 and I said, "I know we moved to Nashville."
 And she said, "I know it too."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But what do you do?
 Like for example, okay, this is great.
 I get to ask you what to do.
 A couple of weeks ago, David Wagner prophesies me at church,
 prophesies me, prophesies me.
  </li><li>Prophecyed me.
  </li><li>Prophecyed over me about writing books.
  </li><li>Yes.
 my private devotional life, I've never heard the Lord say Alan write a book. So I'm not
 suggesting David missed it at all. I've had several prophetic words about writing a book,
 and when I asked the Lord, "Hey, Lord, I'm open to writing a book. I just need to know
 what you would like me to write about it and when? What do you want me to say no to so
 I can say yes to that?" And I hear nothing about it. So it's not something as the front
 of my schedule of things to do. I've not ignored it. I'm praying about it. But so it's invitational
 and I'm saying, "Yeah, I'm happy to write a book. I don't know what to write a book about
 or when and I don't want to try and for something
 to make it happen, what am I doing wrong?
  </li><li>I don't think you're doing anything wrong.
 I think I love that you have a yes.
 And I think sometimes if the Lord isn't giving you
 write a book about this and the Lord's saying,
 write a book, then my next question would be,
 what are you passionate about right now?
 Like what do you feel like the Holy Spirit
 riding on as it were that--
  </li><li>He's riding in a Tesla.
  </li><li>P100D, you could ludicrous mode.
 That's what I should write about.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yes, holy spirit.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>So I would say like,
 well, I know you have a number of different topics
 that you're particularly passionate about
 that you could write about.
 And I would say often when the Lord is offering something,
 he's also saying, what do you want to do?
 So I would look at that as well.
 Like, well, what are you excited?
 What would you be excited about writing about?
 Because if he's not giving you a specific topic,
 then anything is obedience.
  </li><li>Wow.
 Okay, so saying yes is important.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>What about if you don't like what the prophetic word says?
 Do you still have to say yes,
 or can you like massage it with God
 into something you want it to be?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, you never have to say yes to God,
 it's just not smart not to.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I'm thinking about when,
 when one of the clearest prophetic words
 I've ever had in my life is the Lord spoke to me,
 I just finished university.
 that's praying about what to do next.
 I'd been given a job offer, I turned it down
 'cause I felt the Lord really clearly said to me,
 turned out, you know,
  </li><li>And it was like your dream job?
  </li><li>Dream job.
 And so then the obvious question would be,
 well, Lord, if you're saying no to that,
 what do you think yes to?
 And I remember I was running around a park
 in Edinburgh, Scotland,
 and as I got to one part of the Meadows,
 that's the name of the park.
  </li><li>You weren't running 'cause somebody was chasing you,
 but you were just joking.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was joking.
  </li><li>I've never known you to jog,
 so I just wanted to know why.
 Why are you around me?
 Sorry.
 Yes, yes, jogging.
 And I hear as clear as anything as I've ever heard in my life, I hear, near audibly, I
 want you to be a teacher.
 And I remember just laughing out loud.
 And I remember saying, Lord, Lord, I don't, I barely like humans.
 Like I certainly don't like children.
 Like, and I just kind of ignored it.
 And I kept praying and praying and praying.
 And after a couple of weeks, I felt like the Lord said to me, I've already told you why
 I want you to be, why don't you ask me for the next steps?
 So, you know, and today, like I'm predominantly known as a teacher,
 and it all started back then years and years and years ago saying,
 "Yes, there's something I didn't want to do."
 So there's a good hint. What do you do next?
 You ask the Lord for what the next steps are,
 because I don't think you can come up with a method for these or the next steps
 for following your prophetic word, because every prophetic word gets followed differently.
 Because it's about the journey.
 Yeah. So there you go.
 Thanks so much for listening.
 Just ask the Lord on behalf of the Father.
 But seriously, what are some of the other ingredients then?
 I mean, you make a great point.
 Yeah, there is not a cookie cutter way.
 And this isn't about like how to make your prophetic words come true,
 because sometimes your prophetic words are there to test you.
 And it talks about, you know, the word of the Lord came to Joseph until the time of
 testing was done.
 So sometimes the reason they're not happening fast enough fast enough is
 because God's working as something else so that it's in your life.
 So the word can come to pass.
 Yeah.
 if you ever had those moments where you're like,
 "Bacaud, I've been waiting 20 years for this."
 And it's not that God's forgotten,
 it's not that he's lazy,
 it's just that he's doing something to bring around.
  </li><li>I would say, I mean, there's a bunch of different,
 and you can debate, I suppose,
 whether it's practical or spiritual,
 but like stuff like, praying it through,
 like praying the word back to God,
 bringing it to wise people who,
 And just laying it before them like, hey, this is the prophetic word I got.
 This is as I journal about it, as I process, as I pray, this is what I feel like
 I'm hearing you know me.
 You're further along in life.
 Would you speak into this?
 You know, like inviting your community.
 And I'd probably say like your moms and dads.
 Yeah.
 You're spiritual leaders, people who are safe.
 Do you invest it in your life?
 Yeah.
 Into the process of, Hey, I feel like I have this invitation from
 God, what do you see?
 What do I not see?
 You know, all that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>I think prayer is so important.
 There's a brilliant passage.
 It's one of my favorite passages in all the scripture.
 I wrote down in Second Samuel 7 where David,
 King David gets the most amazing prophetic word from Nathan.
 You know, it's when Nathan comes and says,
 "Hey, God's gonna give you a son,
 "is King David never gonna end.
 "You know, I want to build a temple, he will.
 "He's gonna give you an everlasting dynasty,
 "is gonna be incredible."
 This phenomenal prophetic word that David gets from Nathan
 And it ends in verse 17 where it says,
 "Nathan reported to David all the words
 of the entire revelation."
 Very next verse, verse 18,
 "Then David went in and sat before the Lord."
 And if you read it, David just speaks back to the Lord,
 everything that the Lord has said to me, praise it back.
 And we've made that our habit for years and years and years
 when we've got prophetic words that seem to take us
 by surprise, seem too good to be true,
 seem outside of our realm of what we are praying for
 thinking of it's like an all hands on deck. You know, we've told this story before Trisha King came a
 number of years ago and gave arguably one of the, you know, there's been a couple of words in my
 life that stood out to me, Graham Cooks Isaiah 61, favorable year of the word, favorable year of the
 Lord word. And when Patricia King came, she gave our church four words, not the church, but the people
 in the church. You can smile at your future, a hundred full blessing. The Lord will greatly
 bless your seed and what was the fourth one?
 Increase your tentpigs.
 No, it was all about expansion.
 There was four things, four scriptures.
 We came home, we wrote them on our mirrors, put them as the wallpaper on our tablets and our phones.
 And we would just...
 Sorry, just declare it.
 Not just declaring but praying it back.
 And we used that prophetic word as a signpost for where God wanted to take us.
 And you've got to remember that the reason for the prophetic is God calls things that are not as so they...
 I can't even speak. God calls things that are not as though they were or as though they are rather.
 And so all those words were talking about abundance and fruitfulness and financial blessing.
 And in this season that we got that word, there was none of it. So we were using that
 prophetic word to understand where God was wanting to take us so we could partner with
 with that understanding. And that was our whole prayer thing.
 There was something you said just a minute before you went into the word from Patricia King.
 that made me think also, there's this thought out there,
 which I don't agree with, but a thought out there
 that you're never gonna hear in a prophetic word,
 something that you haven't already heard from the Lord.
 And I don't know how many times I've heard that
 from different people where they're like,
 well, if you get this crazy word
 and it doesn't really register with you or you're like,
 wow, I didn't see that coming.
 It's probably not God because God would talk to you
 about it first.
 And I don't see that in scripture,
 but that hasn't been my experience either.
 More often, God has, through other people,
 trusted prophets brought a word where I'm like,
 I don't only not see that in myself,
 but I don't want to do that.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But still bringing it to the Lord and saying,
 "Lord, if this is you and this is an invitation,
 Would you get my heart in line with what it is that you have for me so that my yes can be like a powerful yes rather than a reluctant yes.
 And for me every time it has been me who didn't know not the prophetic voices who were off.
 If you think about it, you've always got to hear something for the first time.
 Yes, like the notion that God's never going to tell you anything new is like, how are you going to grow?
 No, no, no, I get it.
 But what I've heard is he's always going to tell you first, not somebody else.
 It's always going to be confirmation.
 It's never like new revelation.
 Okay.
 And that hasn't been my experience at all.
 No, I can see.
 I can point to both examples in my life.
 Right.
 But yeah, I think it's biblical examples.
 Yeah.
 You know, when when Saul was out looking for his uncle's donkey,
 he wasn't expecting to be the hope of all of Israel.
 And that was the very first word that, you know, Samuel gave him.
 Right.
 It's like, oh, yeah.
 Okay.
 So praying, praying is a big deal.
 Big deal.
 really bring it back to God returning it to him and then asking for you know wisdom asking for insight for sure I
 Like we just talked about confirmation and like you know these things
 I do like getting confirmations on my word the apostle Paul
 I think whereas at Romans no 2 Corinthians
 13 1 he calls an Old Testament principle that every matter be established by two or three witnesses and
 For me anytime. There's a big like right now
 We age and I are sitting on a massive prophetic word not to be cryptic.
 Who we are, but we're sitting on a life-streamer prophetic word that we are currently seeking.
 I will we're doing everything we're talking about.
 We've done the process.
 We've both had dreams.
 We've both journaled about it.
 We've both had prophetic words about it.
 We've both heard from the Lord through journaling.
 We've had prophetic words.
 And now we're actually bringing it to trusted people.
 trusted people that are our usual people who know us, who have done life with us and saying,
 "Hey, can you speak into this? What are you hearing from the Lord? What do we not see?"
 What's funny is, do you want to tell us, I mean, without talking about what it is,
 because we'll do that later, right? Later in the future, not later in this episode.
 Not this episode.
 Do you want to talk about what happened when Wagner was at church and you were asking for
 a confirmation from the Lord?
 Oh, it was really funny actually because it was just a few weeks ago and Jeff ended up
 last minute not being able to speak on the Sunday morning and we were on vacation.
 And so I showed up Sunday morning and Jeff's car wasn't there.
 And I was like, oh, I wonder what's going on.
 Anyway, went inside and Tony said, you know, sure enough, Jeff's had to go and take care
 of a family issue.
 And so David Wagner is coming in.
 And I was, so I was on the front row and I don't, honestly, I can honestly say I don't
 do this.
 Like I don't do that.
 Oh, I hope I get a prophetic word.
 I do all the time, which is probably why I get so many prophetic words.
 Oh, it might be.
 I'm constantly, are you kidding me?
 I'm trying to profit some time.
 I'm like, Lord, pick me, pick me.
 Honestly, admittedly.
 Really?
 I, are you kidding me?
 I always want a word from the Lord.
 Okay.
 Always.
 I don't agree.
 I don't, usually you're way more spiritual than me, but for me, I'm pulling on everybody's
 hand.
 I don't know that I'm worse.
 You're so funny.
 I'm standing there and I'm just like,
 "Oh Father, I would love a prophetic word from David
 about this thing that we're processing."
 And the Lord was just super sweet.
 You could almost feel the smile in it,
 but he was like, "You already have one."
 And he reminded me of a prophetic word
 about exactly this thing from David about seven years ago.
  </li><li>And if I'm not wrong,
 It was maybe the first word of the whole thing.
  </li><li>It was, yeah.
 We hadn't heard it at all.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>He was the first person to give us that word.
  </li><li>And we were sort of like, oh, you missed it.
 You're so sweet though, you're so good.
 And you, you know, normally you're really, you know,
  </li><li>You're so kind and sweet, but poor David, you missed it.
 And then we're like, yeah, he didn't miss it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Yeah. And then when we brought it up
 with some of our community that we're processing with
 right now, one of those people was like,
 hey, do you remember that word that David gave you?
 And we were like, yep, we remember.
  </li><li>So getting confirmations is good.
 Especially, I don't think you need a confirmation
 for every single thing, but like for big life decisions.
  </li><li>But can we qualify confirmations?
 Because I've heard people do this.
  </li><li>This is where we get to air all our pet peeves.
  </li><li>Do this, this pet peeve, do this.
 Like I need a prophetic AJ, I need a prophetic Allen,
 I need a prophetic confirmation.
 This is what I feel like the Lord said, da da da da da.
 Yes?
  </li><li>Right.
 everything and then you agree or disagree. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about
 waiting for the Lord to speak through another voice without you prompting that voice, without you
 giving them the information about what you want confirmation about, right? And just looking for
 Lord, if you've spoken at once, will you speak it again? How about this dynamic, which I've done in
 my own life so many times, but also as I've pastored people, I've heard people do this again and again
 again, where that whole thing of, we often want the word to mean what we want it to mean.
 Instead of being willing to hear what God actually wants it to mean. So real time, like when the
 Lord told me, "I don't want you to be a teacher," I was so horrified at the thought of being a teacher.
 Like when he said, "I want you to be a teacher," instantly I went to school teacher and so swiftly
 I kicked that away from.
 And at the time I was a super nerd.
 And I was like, by teacher,
 you mean a certified Microsoft trainer.
  </li><li>Wait, can we qualify at the time you were super nerd?
  </li><li>As in I derived my income from IT,
 whereas now I'm just, you know,
 I'm not a professional nerd.
  </li><li>You're a nerd for fun.
  </li><li>I'm a hobbyist nerd.
 But that whole thing was like,
 it was so abhorrent to me to think about me
 being a school teacher.
 like get back, unwashed masses.
 Yeah.
 I just try to interpret it in the most palatable way.
 Like I guess a, you know, Microsoft consultant
 would be class as a teacher, but we, I, I've made that mistake
 over and over and over and over again.
 And I've watched other people try and massage.
 And sometimes the reason for the delay
 of our prophetic words being fulfilled is
 it's my will be done not yours.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We're full of good news today.
 So the other thing you could do is start taking baby steps towards whatever the goal is.
 So whatever your prophetic words are pointing towards, are there practical steps that you
 can do to equip yourself and be more prepared for when that door does open?
 Yeah, like dipping your toe in the water.
 Yeah.
 I was in school with somebody when I was in Toronto, I did a school of ministry.
 I was in a school and I remember talking to somebody and they had got a prophetic word
 that they were going to lead a mega church.
 And I was like, that's, that's awesome.
 and I was catching up with him sometime later
 and going back to his church
 and I was asking him how things were going
 and you know, you're stewing, you're going to be
 in prophetic words and all that sort of stuff.
 And the only opportunity available to him at church
 was to help in children's ministry.
 And his reasoning was, well, that's not what I'm called to.
 I'm called to lead a mega church.
 And I think it was you that pointed out,
 John Arnett who's been leading a worldwide revival,
 Yeah, he started his ministry in children's church.
 Because he was asked, they needed somebody
 and so he decided to start in children's.
 And our friend David Campbell's got this great saying,
 he said, "You know, if you're too big to serve,
 "you're too small to lead."
 And it's so important.
 God rarely skips the elementary to make you an expert.
 Rarely does he ever just, you know,
 one, two, miss a few, nine, nine, a hundred.
 It's Zechariah, four, 10, about, you know,
 don't despise a day of small beginnings.
 Yeah.
 I can trace that in my own life.
 Like, you know, I started as a school teacher,
 and then I got opportunities to teach in my church
 and literally doing a children's talk.
 I remember doing a children's talk
 and I called it "Double O'Heaven."
  </li><li>And you dress up like an angel?
  </li><li>Dress up as an angel, yeah.
  </li><li>I love that video.
  </li><li>Then, you know, then I went to school
 to become a teacher, then taught,
 and then got opportunities to teach on children's camps,
 shout out Marinathicamp.
 And then got opportunities to teach in school.
 I was just thinking about this week.
 went to school as a student, but I taught a class on mind mapping when I was in school,
 then got opportunities to speak at Toronto, then marriage you, or then travelled with
 John, got opportunities to share, then married you, started as an itinerant.
 And now, largely, like I said, I'm known as a teacher.
 But I didn't go from, you know, running around the park and the Lord's like, "Yay, I want
 to send you around the world as a teacher to people."
 Like, that didn't happen.
 And between it, there was lots of stuff that I was just horrified by and didn't want to
 do.
 the same. Like I started by teaching a small group of three teenage girls.
 You started by throwing up before teaching. Well, this the small group I didn't vomit before
 because I was like, you know, three or four girls. You had that one to your balance.
 Well, I still got super nervous. Yeah. And then I started, uh, yeah, just teaching the
 youth every once in a while and I would vomit and I'm telling you that nobody wants to see those
 videos. I mean, not that I've vomited on video, but just. Chris, find that please on, on YouTube.
 We need that. It wasn't good teaching. Let's just say that. Okay. Um, yeah.
 So I mean, my my start in terms of stepping out in obedience looked pretty rough.
 Like it didn't look it looked like God got it wrong. Really? Like God really shouldn't have
 what called me to this. A lot of conversation that you had with John after about like 10th
 profit called you about speaking stadiums and traveling around the world.
 After the 5th. Yeah. I mean, I was standing next to John and again, all five of these had been from
 from the platform in front of everybody in our church.
 And anyway, I'm standing next to John in the fifth one.
 I can't remember which prophet it was that was the fifth one,
 but basically said, you know,
 I see the Lord using your life to restore others
 and you're gonna be traveling around the world
 and you're gonna be speaking in stadiums
 and all this kind of stuff.
 And incidentally, still haven't spoken in a stadium,
 so that's still yet to happen.
 But I was like, you know, listening.
 And in this, me at the time, I hadn't even started speaking
 at youth, got nervous talking to two people at once.
 I kind of wanted to be a lawyer or, you know what I mean?
 Like I didn't want to be a ministry and I didn't like travel.
 And so everything about that word felt to me like,
 no, you guys all missed it.
 Like all five of you, profit.
  </li><li>And so John's like, well, AJ.
  </li><li>What do you think about that, man?
  </li><li>What do you think about that?
 And you said?
  </li><li>I said, John, I think they're all smoking the same drugs.
 And he just laughed, he's like, "Oh, AJ."
 And, but then a couple months later, I had a dream.
 And in the dream, I was speaking in a stadium.
 And because the Lord had always gotten my attention
 through dreams, I remember waking up and saying,
 "Well, Lord, you've got a lot of work to do
 if this is what you have for me,
 'cause I don't know how to do anything
 that you're asking me to do."
 But I'll say yes.
 But that's also part of why I say,
 like I got five prophetic words that I thought were all off
 before I ever heard from the Lord myself.
 And it was a year before I had that dream.
 So, you know, I think everybody's journey
 with the prophetic is different.
 I think that's part of what's beautiful about it.
 And then I also think the Lord's great
 at waiting for your response.
 And if it takes you a year, that's fine.
 It takes you 10, you know, it's still there.
 It's still waiting for fulfillment.
  </li><li>Maybe the most sobering story I think I've ever heard
 about the prophetic is Reinhard Bonke's.
  </li><li>Yes.
 you know, for those of you who know Ryan Arty's now with the Lord,
 but Reinhard Bonke, great evangelist to Africa.
 It's just, I mean, incredible man.
 But in his autobiography, he talks about being called and the Lord will come up.
 And he called him to be, you know, an evangelist to, to Africa.
 Uh, and he was, you know, he was humbled by the Lord, asking him.
 And he said, Lord, why me?
 And he said, one and two said no.
 And I just think about the people who said no.
 And that's the fear of the Lord for me of like
 Millions of people that are probably in the kingdom because of Reinhard Bonke and two people said no
 Could have been somebody else's testimony
 And that's amazing a Lord will accomplish what he's gonna accomplish and he's looking for partners
 He's looking for laborers and amazing. He doesn't need us. He's got angels who do his bidding
 But he loves to work with us. He loves to partner with us
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I love the journey of the prophetic.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Even while we're in the middle of that journey.
  </li><li>Yeah, right now.
 I think too, like thinking about baby steps,
 things like there's tons of practical things
 that are baby steps to get ready.
 And it depends on what your prophetic word is,
 but they might be things like,
 if you feel like the Lord is speaking to you about travel
 and your words are about that, get your passport.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like do this stuff that actually sets you up
 so that your yes can be immediate when the door opens
 as opposed to going, "Oh man, I wish I had listened."
 And if I had, I would have actually already,
 you know, gotten my passport.
 Or like for me, before I really started traveling,
 speaking, I had already written 30 sermons.
 And the only reason I'd done that
 is because between listening to a joy-smire tape
 about using the silent ears to prepare you
 for the next season, which I listened to this tape
 over and over again until the tape broke.
 And Patricia King saying, "Get ready."
 like get sermons ready.
 I had written 30 sermons before I started traveling.
 But when I started traveling, everything happened so fast
 and I had some things ready.
 So I think some of your yes can be a yes right now,
 you know, practically also hard stuff.
  </li><li>Right, go after your stuff.
  </li><li>Go after your stuff.
 If you're aware that you have things that you are hiding
 from that you have, you know, big owies that are still eating your lunch, go see a counselor,
 get some prayer ministry, go do whatever you need to do so that your heart is ready because
 usually once you get going in a vision, that's not the time to slow down and start taking care
 of that. Like it, it could really hinder you.
 Yeah, I was thinking about the whole thing of sometimes we ignore the practical because it
 doesn't feel like it's spiritual.
 Uh, but like you say, it's so important.
 I remember when we got that word from David Wagner about, you know, you asked
 yourself, can I go to Iceland for the weekend?
 Can I go to Europe for the weekend?
 That's what he asked us.
 And he told us we'd go back to Iceland.
 Well, we had kids, we'd stop traveling.
 MJ was like little, I don't think I even had a passport.
 I mean, I think it expired.
 And I remember coming home that night and start storing all the paperwork for that.
 And we did a couple of months later, get an invitation to go for the
 weekend. I think a couple years later, I think it was a longer gap. But I remember we were on
 the airplane. Yeah. And I remember David had contacted us because you know, we knew we're flying
 and he gave us some vouchers to get into the, you know, the Delta Lounge because we had no status
 at all. And I remember the word, you know, you will say, because I think I said, can you believe
 we're gonna ice them for the weekend? And I was like, Oh my gosh, David literally prophesied that
 we would say that, you know, a couple of years before. So amazing, amazing. Other thing to consider
 is that your revelation will be progressive.
 Like the more you walk towards walking out your prophetic word,
 typically the greater clarity you get as you move towards it.
 So our word started out as church planning and pastoring.
 And in one sense, we haven't planted any churches.
 So they missed it.
 But if you think about it, most of what we've done since being here
 is planting, starting new things, whether it's in Canarycant,
 whether it's M&amp;A, whether it's the school of supernatural life, whether it's a new members class,
 you know, whatever it is, you've been planting and building at Grace Center. And you know,
 my objection to being a pastor was like, Lord, I don't want to be a pastor. And the Lord is like,
 what if you've got a very dim view of pastoring? What if I actually want you to redefine what it
 looks like for you rather than you having to fit into a model? Yeah, what if you get to be you
 pastoring rather than you have to look like a certain way to be a pastor? And now in hindsight,
 looking back 12 years, you know, going on 13 years as we loop back, we're like, all of our
 prophetic words make way more sense now than they did going into it. But I also even think,
 you know, I was talking about that progression of like being a student, being a school teacher,
 being a teacher on a kid's camp, being an itinerant speaker, you know, having a fivefold gift of
 teaching. Like God said, I want you to be a teacher. The most predominant gift that people
 usually recognizing my life is a teacher, but that did not happen overnight.
 No.
 And now it's easy to see.
 Oh, yeah, of course God called me to be a teacher.
 That was way back then.
 But my limited interpretation was you want me to be a school teacher and then
 expanded and expanded and expanded.
 But also you were faithful to do each season.
 And I think that that is a huge key as well is to whatever season God has you
 in in the midst of walking out your prophetic word to, to be content in your
 season and be faithful in your season until God moves you to the next season.
 I think it's important.
 I was speaking to a friend this week about prophetic ministry, about giving prophetic
 words, not about receiving prophetic words.
 And I was reminiscing about John Paul Jackson, one of my heroes, who's now with the Lord,
 a tremendous prophet, great teacher.
 And he was teaching about prophetic ministry.
 And he was saying, the biggest mistake people make in the prophetic is at the interpretation
 stage.
 they get it wrong. The revelation is usually good, but they misinterpret what the Lord
 is saying. And so I was thinking about that and I was like, "Get in. That's probably
 the biggest mistake, not only in the giving of prophetic words, but in us trying to walk
 them out. We think too quickly we know what the word means. And if we don't fail at the
 interpretative fail, if we don't get it wrong at the interpretation stage, we tend to get
 it wrong at the timing stage. Either moving too quickly, moving too slowly, or being
 frustrated that God is not moving faster. And I think about our journey here, like one sense,
 we go, I still blows my mind, we got our visas to come to America in one day.
 Yes. Like on our day. And the other thing, it took us how long to get our green card, like a year
 and a half, like someone like that. It was, yeah, it was much longer, obviously.
 You know, both things were essential for us where we are. And, you know, God moves in seasons
 and sometimes he moves in suddenly and sometimes he moves in seasons and we've got to be okay with that.
 Either way, I think whether it's the interpretation of the timing thing, the key to getting through
 that is to have your ears close as you can to the father. Like what are you doing? What are you
 saying? And that's that's just pivotal. Yeah, I can care. Any other thoughts on prophetic
 walking out your your what do we call us the world's longest time? How does your prophetic
 kind of work to come to pass anything else that we haven't addressed that you think
 would be good?
 I think just probably just stay teachable in the process.
 Keep, you know, start the process by letting people speak into your life.
 Keep letting them speak into your life.
 Like, you know, because at one point you'll arrive in whatever the current prophetic word
 is.
 And usually that's about the time that you start to walk towards the next thing because,
 you know, God tends to lead us in bits and starts because if he told us the end from
 in the beginning, we'd probably be too terrified to start
 towards it in the first place, you know?
 But I think you need to be teachable
 throughout the whole process.
 Both the Lord being able to teach you
 but those in community with you.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think the other thing I would probably add
 to my own question would be don't confuse your identity
 with your prophetic word.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like there's so much other rich, beautiful stuff going on
 in your life than your prophetic word being fulfilled.
 Like the Lord who gave it will be faithful
 to bring you maturity to see that his word is fulfilled.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I'm not suggesting you just put it on the shelf
 and just get on with the rest of your life.
 I'm like, bring it to you,
 but your prophetic works can't be the most interesting thing
 about you.
 Like that has to be your relationship with Jesus.
 Like the thing that you're gonna give away to most people
 is your intimate deep connection with Jesus.
 Like pursue that and build that.
 Like not that you're frustrated that people are in your way
 of getting your prophetic word,
 'cause people aren't.
  </li><li>Nobody is.
 God is the ultimate dispenser of our future.
  </li><li>I think my, yeah, my last thing was this.
 I just, it just went in my head.
 I don't believe anybody can steal your destiny from you.
 So I don't think you have to worry about, you know,
 it's not a competition.
 You know, as long as you are saying yes to God
 and being faithful with what's in front of you right now,
 you're headed in the right direction.
 So just head on with God.
 And yeah, don't worry about what the person next to you is doing.
  </li><li>Bingo.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 questions about prophetic, walking out your prophetic words, shoot us a question, you
 go to alanahj.com/ask.
 And speaking of listeners' questions, we actually have one this week.
 And so I'm going to ask you the question, Ms. Jones.
 Oh, Mr. Jones.
 Hit me.
 All right.
 So the question basically is, what do you do when you see leaders that you trust, you
 know, in the kingdom that are saying things or doing things that just, you don't understand
 that don't line up with who you know them to be or how you understand the kingdom.
 Yeah, I've probably answered that question more than any other question in this
 recent season, like people I taught a series of grace on our own kingdom
 perspectives of what's going on in America.
 We just had our election and got a new president during that transition.
 I'd say anyway, I did a four part series on that.
 And one of the things I did was answer questions and answers.
 I actually didn't get to answer this question.
 This was a question that was sent in at that point.
 I've had people approach me privately say, can you help me understand?
 And the gist is what do you do when you're following, say, on social media, somebody that
 has helped you greatly tremendously.
 You really look up to and they're a Christian leader that are either the way they're saying
 something seems like unChristlike to you or they're holding a political view that you
 can't reconcile or they're having an opinion about something going on and you're like,
 You know, you're betraying who I know you to be.
 And there's so much good stuff to unpack in that.
 Like, you know, the possibility that you've built them
 into something that they're not,
 and they're not hostage to how you see them.
 I mean, that's one way of answering it.
 But really the heartbeat is like,
 I trust these people don't need to ignore everything else.
 They said when they're saying this stuff.
 And I was praying about that
 because I've had my own fair share of that,
 where you're just like,
 did you mean to post that publicly on social media?
 You know, was that what you wanted to say?
 And as I was praying about it,
 I heard the Lord quote that verse,
 that the Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11,
 "Emulate me as I emulate Christ."
 And this is what I felt like the Father said to me,
 it's like, Alan, you need to emulate them
 only in the areas that you see them emulate in Christ.
 And in the areas where they're not emulating Christ,
 remember they are about dust, you know, they're--
  </li><li>We're all human and we all still have our, yeah.
 We all have bad days where we say inappropriate things or we, you know, like this past season,
 it's been an exercise of discipline of me holding my tongue on social media because I want to
 be quick-witted.
 I want to be passive aggressive.
 I don't want to be president of my feelings.
 Quick-witted.
 That's a nice way of putting it.
 I want to shut down people.
 I, you know, I don't like what they're saying without having to engage with them.
 Right?
 And I'm not going to do that because it never produces anything kind.
 I'm having to hold my tongue.
 There's been times when I've let it slip, but I've posted things I later regret.
 And so there's, you know, a delete button for that.
 But that's what you do.
 Like you're not, you know, if you're not their judge, you're not their keeper.
 And you know, remember in this season, everyone is on edge.
 Everyone's running out of, you know, energy and kindness and empathy and all that sort
 of stuff.
 But just remember, we're only to emulate people as we see them emulate Christ.
 And so if they're not emulating Christ, you know what, don't judge them.
 We're all human, we're all having, you know, our own experiences, good, bad, and ugly.
 Yeah.
 And I think also we, as humans, tend to move towards judgment super fast.
 And we actually rarely know what's going on in other person's heart.
 So we need to be a bit more cautious about that in the first place anyway.
 One of my favorite lines I've ever heard Bill Johnson say, we're our dumbest when we think
 we know the motives of another person's heart.
 Yeah.
 And so, you know, practice, practice the ancient Hungarian saying of not my circus, not my
 monkeys.
 Oh, okay.
 Okay, like you're I'm not responsible for their Twitter feed so I don't need to lose sleep over it
 Things to live your life by those Hungarians, they're pretty awesome
 Babe good answer. Thank you. You're welcome
