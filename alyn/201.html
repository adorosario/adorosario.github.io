<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones and we're back.
 Yes we are.<br/>
 And baby, I have missed sitting opposite you on a Sunday night with a microphone partially
 obscuring your face.<br/>
 Thanks, Sterling.<br/>
 How the heck are you?<br/>
 I've seen you in like two months.<br/>
 Well, you have though, because we live together.
 I'm trying to connect with our audience.
 Oh, you haven't heard from us since July.
 Yes. Well, I didn't want them to think that you hadn't actually seen me since they hadn't heard my voice.
 If you're just joining us with the Joneses, I'm Alan.
 I'm AJ.<br/>
 And we host this podcast called Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 We had a break for the summer, but now we're back excited to be in your ears once again,
 which sounds super creepy. I apologize.
 It really does.<br/>
 At this point, we normally do our weekly catch up, but given it's kind of like a more,
 More like a two monthly catch up so give us an overview of what's happened since july.
 Well i just went to canada should we work backwards you can do any which way you want okay without be easier i just went to canada my mom fell over and broke the top part of her femur.
 And so they saw it off and put on a new ball part of my gosh that's disgusting.
 And so she's currently in a rehab hospital and they're trying to get her walking again.
 But I know that she'll do great because she's not this sitting around type.
 It's also her second time round.<br/>
 So she's getting better recovering from having a broken hip.
 Yes. Well, the last time she broke her femur a little bit further down,
 so it just had a plate and screws.<br/>
 This one was a little bit, it was a half-ip replacement because her pelvis was fine.
 Oh, look at that.<br/>
 Glorious.<br/>
 Just the type of stuff we tune in for.
 You had a major milestone in Zelda.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 I have 100% did the game.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 So I, uh, this from a woman who hates video games and Zelda in particular.
 Yeah, I did.<br/>
 I did, but, you know, it took me what?
 Ten months.<br/>
 Yeah, we started in January, $60 for 10 months of game plays.
 Pretty impressive.<br/>
 That is pretty awesome.<br/>
 So are you going to do master mode?<br/>
 No, I am thinking about starting the whole game over again.
 Uh, just in normal mode now that I understand the purpose of the game.
 Cause I feel like when we started playing, we had no idea what Zelda was,
 whatever, what the purpose of anything was, why we would pick up like when,
 when you start the game, you start out on the great plateau.
 I had no idea.<br/>
 I should be picking up all the food that I'm running by.
 Like I just didn't know anything.<br/>
 I didn't know to look for corks.<br/>
 He didn't know any of that.<br/>
 So I just thought, Oh, it might be really fun now with understanding the game
 to go back and play it and see what it feels like.
 You are becoming more and more attractive the longer you talk about Zelda.
 Be still my big heart.<br/>
 I did have the moment of I couldn't find and we had podcast listeners that
 tried to send me some, you know, information about like, have you checked
 here for your last quark seat?<br/>
 Cause I had one that I couldn't find.<br/>
 It took me like two weeks.<br/>
 I think you collected 899 of the suckers in the last one.
 It was evasive.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It was on Lake Hallelujah.<br/>
 Hallelujah.<br/>
 I was trying to remember did we go vacation this summer and if so, where did we go?
 Because I have no recollection.<br/>
 Yeah, we did.<br/>
 We went to that water park in the Smokies.
 That's what we did.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 We took the kids away to a water park and then we had a staycation to stuff around the home.
 Yes.<br/>
 There you go.<br/>
 That is a fast.<br/>
 I didn't.<br/>
 And all that kind of stuff.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 You painted gloriously.<br/>
 Why won't you let me paint?<br/>
 Because your attention to detail is somewhat lacking.
 So I think.<br/>
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, because I let you paint before and you made a mess.
 What would you like me to say?<br/>
 For anyone who knows me, they might have a hard time believing that my attention to detail is lacking.
 Well, let's say this.<br/>
 Your hand isn't as steady as your heart is.
 OK.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 This is a harsh reality.<br/>
 Sorry about that, darling.<br/>
 So it's definitely my issue.<br/>
 Not your control issues.<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
 Oh, gosh, I've missed you.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 So we did that.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 We've been camping and we're about to go camping again.
 Yeah.<br/>
 You're thinking about persuading me to get a pop-up.
 Explain what a pop-up is to people who never camp.
 Well, just like a pop-up canopy.<br/>
 So...<br/>
 It means nothing.<br/>
 Well, it's like a...<br/>
 Well, it's a canopy that you place over your picnic table
 or whatever so that you're not getting rained on when you eat.
 No, not that thing.<br/>
 The thing that the campsite that people showed us
 that you dragged behind you in a car.<br/>
 Oh, oh!<br/>
 They call it a pop-up.<br/>
 A pop-up trailer.<br/>
 Yes, they're amazing.<br/>
 No, stop.<br/>
 Here's the thing.<br/>
 Your enthusiasm is overwhelming.<br/>
 Okay, so we can't have like an RV because we have no place to put it, right?
 And our homeowners association would freak out.
 But a pop-up, we could just store in our garage because they fit in garages and then
 they fold out when you get there and there's like beds and a little kitchen.
 Some of them have little bathrooms in it.
 So you would be able to camp like in November or in February, March or whatever.
 They have heating and air conditioning in them.
 For our British listeners, they will understand this term.
 It's like a caravan that collapses.<br/>
 Yes, it's yes.<br/>
 Americans don't call them caravans, I don't think.
 No, they don't.<br/>
 But it's like, but the size of a trailer that you'd pull behind a car.
 Yes.<br/>
 But on top of it is just this unfoldable, I guess, like tent, like material
 with ends and sides that pop out to give you space.
 Right. And it has a hard top on it and they have like little fridges in them and
 I'm just not ready for this level of commitment.
 It's pure awesomeness. Yes, you are. You would love it because you love
 tent camping and knowing you this is like the next level for you.
 Still feels tenty. Still feels campy. But oh babe. Yeah.
 I would rather skip this phase and just go straight to an RV.
 But where do we put the RV? Right.<br/>
 So this way more practical, way less expensive.
 Oh, yeah, baby.<br/>
 Oh, good Lord. I'm speechless. Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah. OK. Well, it remains to be seen whether I'll be persuaded to get a pop up.
 But we're going camping again next week. So I don't know.
 Well, the fun part is when you go camping, I spy with my little eye,
 all the other campers who are way more experienced than us.
 And it's like real life Pinterest.<br/>
 Like everybody campsite is a board that you go to and you're like, well, that's amazing.
 I don't know you can do that.<br/>
 But we need tea lights and we need more hammocks and we need this.
 And so I didn't realize there's this whole subculture of basically an industry around camping.
 I know that's ridiculous for anybody who spent any time in someone like REI.
 I didn't know REI existed until.<br/>
 This is the saddest confession I've ever heard.
 Again, for people who don't know what REI is, it's basically an outdoor camping outdoor hiking
 store. It's lovely. But you can go through there and there's like, "Oh my gosh, that's amazing."
 I would never even think that that was invented. So I'm all excited because there's new things
 to investigate. Last big event of the summer, we got a new car, or I should say you got a new car.
 I did, yeah. Well, you drive it a little bit. Yeah, when you let me, if I feel like the proper
 a form and get permission.<br/>
 And that's right.<br/>
 Yeah, that's right.<br/>
 Which works out well because I don't really care.
 I'm happy to cruise around in the minivan.
 Well, that's the deal.<br/>
 You said you didn't care.<br/>
 Really don't.<br/>
 And I do.<br/>
 I care about everything.<br/>
 I care about engines and it's just fun to drive something peppy that I can actually
 listen to music in, which is lovely.<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Well, welcome back everybody.<br/>
 We missed you really genuinely, totally missed you, totally missed the routine of sitting
 down are happy to be back. Love the whole process. I really, really appreciated all the text,
 tweets, Instagram posts, emails, etc. Are you guys forgotten about us? Are you coming back?
 Yeah, thank you for those.<br/>
 Yeah, they were really, really sweet. Made us feel very, very loved. So thank you for those.
 Our topic for this week. Well, before we start our topic for this week, our whole idea, in fact,
 we put out a little video that this was going to be season two in that season one was 200 episodes.
 Season two is not going to be too heavy.
 No, well, the thing is season two is probably not going to be season two because over the summer,
 just before the summer, Apple released a bunch of features for podcast people like ourselves where
 you could toggle buttons that say this is a new season.
 And I was like, that was cool.<br/>
 But to be honest, the documentation so sparse, I'm not actually sure what will happen if I turn
 those on. So for now, we're just going to keep. I think this is episode 201.
 We're just going to keep on trucking.<br/>
 Okay. But we are going to start a kind of a series, a 10 episode series that we're calling back to the basics.
 AJ, explain to us the thinking behind back to the basics.
 Well, my thought was I would love to have a series of podcasts where if perhaps you're just joining us for the first time now,
 and you're thinking, what do they believe? Like these people that I'm about to listen to, what is it that they believe?
 you'd get a good idea of what it is that we believe from the next 10 podcasts. But also,
 if you were a new believer, you would get foundational things that would help you grow in your walk
 in these 10 podcasts. So sort of like if I was going to direct someone to only 10, I could say,
 "Hey, go do starting at episode 201 and go ahead and listen to the first 10 podcasts of that."
 Yeah, we just thought if we could reduce living a fulfilling Christ-centered life to 10 things
 to implement in your life, what would they be? And we've come up with 10 things. And that's what
 we're going to spend the next 10 episodes talking about. Our very first topic that we picked is all
 about the Bible. Now, I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions, babe, which I know the answers to,
 and probably anybody who's listened to this understands the answers too, but I've fallen more and more
 in love with foundational stuff. I think it's right to sit and remind ourselves of things we
 already know. But let me start with this. Why is it important to read the Bible and why is it
 important? I'm even asking another Christian that question. Oh, good question. Why is it important?
 I think if you don't read the Bible, first of all, the Bible is life. It's like eating living food.
 So if you're not reading the Bible, you end up feeling really dull, basically in your Christian
 want because you're not taking something in that is full of life. Like as much as it's a book,
 it's a supernatural book. Right? Also, if you don't actually read the Bible, then you won't
 actually know when you're hearing faulty theology. Ooh, say that again.
 Well, if you don't read the Bible yourself and you don't actually know what it says,
 then you can be fairly easily led astray and you can end up way down a road before you ever know
 that that was never biblical to begin with. That's amazing. I was teaching about the Bible last
 week at our school, Supernatural Life, to our second year students. And I did a whole session on
 why the Bible can be trusted. And I was, I said, guys, it's alarming to me that now, like, when I
 grew up, it was just an assumption that every Christian would believe that the Bible was the
 inerran infallible word of God. Right. And now that's up for debate in some Christian communities.
 Right.<br/>
 So now I actually have to teach people,
 "No, the Bible can be trusted.<br/>
 The Bible is the Word of God.<br/>
 The Bible does withstand scrutiny.<br/>
 The Bible is trustworthy.<br/>
 The Bible is the filter for our life.<br/>
 The Bible is an authority that we can build our lives on.
 Right.<br/>
 And the Bible does back itself up,<br/>
 and God actually exalts his Word above his name,
 and Jesus lived by what would later become the Bible
 and the biblical principles.<br/>
 And Jesus affirmed the Old Testament as Bible.
 and just stuff that was an assumption yet for many modern Christians,
 they're legitimate questions.<br/>
 Is this a big thing?
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
 Well, I think people have become so afraid of being religious
 that they throw out the Bible with it.
 And that's terrifying to me.
  </li><li>I was preaching this morning at Lyle and Allison Phillips Church,
 at Legacy National, some friends of ours who passed for church here.
 And I was preaching and I was talking about how when Lyle and I had lunch together,
 allows teaching me about tithing and what he said felt really religious to me.
 And I had this revelation when I was preaching that sometimes what feels religious to us is conviction.
 And the reason it feels religious to us is because it's probably been a long time since we allowed ourselves to be convicted.
 So it feels foreign.
 Yeah, I got that.
 I got one.
 I got their reaction.
 So good.
 One of my favorite verses about the Bible, which gives me confidence about the Bible is 2 Timothy 3 16,
 where it says, "All scriptures God breathed
 "and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting,
 "training and equipping for every good works."
 It's basically what you were saying,
 if you are not reading the Bible,
 you're missing out and being taught, being corrected,
 being trained, being equipped and being rebuked.
 So as you say, you could be wandering around,
 blown around by every new wind of teaching,
 not realizing it's not scriptural,
 but if we have a foundation on the Word of God,
 we basically have a filter for our life
 for things to go through.
 And we're not easily swayed.
 We have confidence when it is and when it's not God.
  </li><li>Right.
 One of the things that I used to love in Toronto is,
 you know, John would tell us,
 "Hey, even when we have guest speakers in,
 "doesn't matter how big their name is or whatever,
 "like you need to know, is this biblical?
 "What are they saying?
 "Is it biblical?
 "Like take it and filter it and process it
 "and don't just assume because somebody with a microphone
 "or platform said that it's true,
 that it is true, find it in the word.
 And I thought for me that was like, okay, I will,
 and there's safety in that.
  </li><li>I think part of the attraction
 with this neo-orthodoxy, this new delight
 that well-meaning Christians, maybe earnest Christians,
 maybe immature Christians, maybe Christians who've been hurt,
 maybe Christians who are frustrated,
 find delight in finding something quote-unquote new,
 is it strokes our human intellect,
 strokes are pride like, "Aha! I am the person that has found the flaw in scriptures."
 But the truth is, you know, all the modern day conspiracies or heresies is better about
 doctrine. None of it's new. It's all been answered before in the Bible, of course,
 but it's all things have just been going on like Gnostic heresies and all this sort of stuff
 that was found in the early church. You posted this earlier, this week on Instagram,
 2 Timothy 4 verse 3, where it says, "For a time is coming, when people will no longer
 listen to sound and wholesome teaching, they will follow their own desires and will look for
 teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear. They will reject
 the truth and chase after myths." Again, that's literally happening today. And it has been happening
 for, you know, since the early church, this has been happening. Absolutely. But now it feels really
 popular. Well, the way to protect yourself from that is to actually have a valley for the word of
 God. Okay. So, babe, talk to me about the whole thing of the infallible word of God. It's kind of
 hard for me to do that in the it was, of course, something I was raised to believe.
 Like my mother and father, you know, brought me up to read the Bible, believe the Bible. And
 you know, part of the hurdle that we face is reading the Bible tends to be quite easy,
 but understanding it is a lot harder because it's an ancient book not written to a modern audience and yet it still has life and value for us.
 Yeah.
 I remember Artie Kendall saying that there's two ways of believing that the Bible is true.
 There's the objective witness as in external evidence, for example, like archaeological findings, historical documentation,
 the testimony of other people whose lives have been changed by the Bible.
 Right.
 But all of that external evidence isn't going to convince somebody who's highly skeptical.
 You know, the Bible itself claims to its own authoritative nature,
 but you end up with circular reasoning.
 So if you don't believe the Bible, you wouldn't believe its claims that it is the word of God.
 Right.
 You see what I mean?
 Yeah.
 So he said really, and this helped me is that it comes by the internal witness as in when you live
 the word of God, you find out that it is true. Like it's true whether you believe it or not.
 Yeah. But as you live by its principles, as you read the Bible, you find the Bible reads you,
 and the more you give yourself to it, and the more you stand under its authority,
 the more you begin to understand the life and the power that's in it.
 Yeah. I heard somebody far cleverer than me say this. They said everything in the Bible is
 literally true, but not everything is true literally.
 Okay. Explain that.
 Well, by that, I mean, yeah, the Bible is true.
 It does need you to be able to understand how to read it, interpret it and apply it.
 Yes.
 But it's not true literally as in when Jesus said, I am the vine.
 It doesn't mean that Jesus has, you know, green leaves.
 He's not Groot, for example, when Jesus said I am the door.
 He doesn't have a keyhole for eyes and a door not for nose.
 Right.
 You've got to understand when it's literal, when it's a story, when it's poetic, when
 the authors using exaggeration, when it's narrative, when it's dialogue,
 because there's all these beautiful facets of literature in there that it would help if you have some understanding about how the Bible is written and how to read it.
 So that's a good point, babe.
 What would you say to someone who wants to learn how to read the Bible?
 We'll give you some resources in a second, but I think a couple of grounding principles.
 It would be helpful to understand that while the Bible was written for us, it wasn't written directly to us.
 As before it was ours, it was the original audiences.
 Right.
 So if you're not aware of that, we'll often run into cultural problems or
 language issues or the fact that God was speaking to a different race,
 sometimes under a different covenant in a completely different time.
 And if we're not careful, we won't realize that there are barriers to our
 understanding and we'll try and get over that barrier and sometimes not really
 helpful ways. For example, one of the most common things I see, and one of the things I've done
 before, is you have people who read the Bible for feel-good measures. So they'll read the bits
 that make them feel good, and they'll skip the bits that don't.
 Right. I don't like those books.
 Right. Or they'll spiritualize the parts they don't understand.
 Right. And over-spiritualize the parts.
 Yeah. Or just automatically demonize things. I remember RT Kendall saying,
 most theology today is actually anthropology. Instead of it being the study of God, it's
 the study of man. And there's a danger that if we're not careful, we make God in our image.
 So you now hear people all the time justify completely weird theology by saying, well,
 you know, because I think like this, well, God must think like that.
 Right.
 And you're like, that's not how it works.
 And the 55 says the complete opposite. So you've got to have a good consistent method for reading
 and understanding the Bible. And that will ensure that you're not trying to create meaning
 out of a text. Instead, you're trying to find a meaning that is already there. You're using
 these tools, almost like an archaeological dig to unearth what's already in the text
 to help you understand what the way you need to live today.
 Right. I was thinking about this. I was raised in a church environment where we, our Bible
 study, we taught through the Bible systematically. Today, you and I tend to teach through the
 Bible thematically. So we might teach a series on finances. And so instead of just picking a book
 like Titus and teaching it from the beginning to the end, although we do do that too, I would say
 largely, I'm just correcting myself. I'd say most of the time we teach thematically, but we do also
 to teach consistently through, you know, verse by verse through a text.
 Yes.
 If you're only ever exposed to teaching that's thematic, you're going to miss
 large portions of the scripture that have nothing to say about the themes
 your pastors taught you.
 Right.
 But have great things to say about the other themes that perhaps we're
 trying to avoid.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 But I want to encourage you, Jesus said, feed my sheep, not feed my giraffes.
 There's this temptation that we think we need to be intellectually haughty in
 order to understand scriptures.
 And that's just not the case.
 The spirit of God who wrote the Bible lives within us and can interpret the Bible.
 Right.
 If we'd give ourselves to the study, I don't understand the giraffe reference.
 The sheep are lowly creatures that are close to the ground.
 Their heads are low.
 Giraffes are on a tall neck.
 So I'm to actually love you.
 OK, got you.
 Thank you.
 I know.
 I did not work.
 All right.
 Give us some tips then.
 If you know, our listeners are listening to this and thinking, I have
 tried reading the Bible, but I get nowhere.
 I get super confused.
 What what can we leave them with in terms of practical steps to help people being courage to read the word of God?
 All right tip number one. I think get a modern translation
 like
 You know NLT the message that get a modern translation that you can read through and typically I read those through
 Next to a different translation like I sort of go back and forth. You have the biggest Bible. I've ever seen I love my Bible
 It's a parallel Bible and it parallels the NASB with the message and they're on the same page first for verse.
 So so big a page, the page of split down the middle and the left is the NASB and on the right is the message.
 Yeah.
 And it's so great because if for some reason I'm reading, you know, part of part of it in the NASB and I'm like, what on earth is this talking about?
 I can read it in the message and go, oh, and then I go back to the NASB and I'm able to sort of go, oh, okay.
 Okay, now I see, you know, so I love that going back and forth, it suits my personality.
 I grew up reading the NIV, so it was hard for me to read the message.
 I mean, I do appreciate the message now, but it's hard because all the passages I'd memorize,
 I couldn't recognize in the message.
 But if you're somebody that's like, "Ah, I honestly am embarrassed.
 I feel like biblically illiterate.
 I don't even know where to start."
 Get a fresh, modern version of the Bible.
 Just go to your Bible store, ask for an easy to read version of the Bible.
 I love reading the new living translation.
 It's the version of the Bible that I read for pleasure.
 I study a lot of different versions, but my go to I'm going to sit down,
 read the Bible as the new living translation.
 But yes, point number one, get a bottom translation.
 What about point number two?
 Point number two, get a reading plan.
 Like if you're starting off, let somebody else give you a plan for how to do it.
 So you don't get lost.
 Right. Right.
 Cause we're like, I'm going to start at the beginning.
 That's great.
 But you know, give it a couple of weeks and you're going to be waiting through the vidicus going,
 "No, this is too tough." You know, if you get through that, you're going to be in chronicles and
 you're like, "What am I doing?" One of my favorite reading plans was reading through the Bible
 chronologically. Yes, that's really fun. You know, if you don't know this, the books of the Bible
 are not ordered chronologically. So if you find out, but you get any sort of reading plan and don't
 feel like you're compelled to read it in a year, just pick a reading plan and start reading through.
 There's a variety of them out there.
 There's a bunch of good apps that will lead you through it.
 You version has a variety of reading plans.
 I'll give you a reading plan.
 I like in a second, but get a reading plan to help you read through the scripture.
 Yeah.
 When I first got saved, the person at that youth event said to me, just start in the
 gospel.
 So read the new Testament first and get that sort of under your belt and then go back
 to the Old Testament.
 And actually that was super helpful for me
 'cause I think if I had just dived in it, Genesis,
 I would have probably got weighed down in Leviticus
 and stopped, you know, but the New Testament was so much easier,
 a place to start, basically.
  </li><li>Right. One of the plans I really liked was
 you'd read a bit of the New Testament,
 you'd read a Psalm and you'd read a bit of the Old Testament.
  </li><li>Right. We did that one a couple of years ago, didn't we?
  </li><li>Yeah, and it would take you through.
 I really liked that.
  </li><li>Number three, are you ready?
  </li><li>Yeah, please tell me.
 So invite the Holy Spirit to read it with you.
  </li><li>What do you mean by that?
  </li><li>Well, what I mean by that is,
 I remember John saying that, like,
 "Hey, when you sit down to read the word,
 invite the Holy Spirit to speak to you about things."
 And so I was like, "Okay."
 And so I would read passages,
 I mean, particularly in the Old Testament
 and stuff like that, where I'd be like,
 "I don't understand this at all."
 And the brilliant thing is the Holy Spirit is with you.
 So you can say, "Holy Spirit, can you tell me
 what's happening here?"
  </li><li>Right.
 Can you give me the background and whatever?
 And so there were so many times where I would, the Holy Spirit would be like,
 well, this is the dynamic that's going on or this was the culture or this was
 whatever. And it was all things I knew nothing about.
 But then I could go and look those things up.
 And I was like, wow, that was right.
 I mean, of course the Holy Spirit knows what was happening.
 But it, to me, it was super encouraging because I was like, I have the author
 with me while I read and I can ask questions.
 And my encouragement to our students is don't gloss over the bits you don't understand.
 Those bits are burning bushes that invite you into deeper revelation.
 Right.
 So you're reading a passage and you're like, I don't understand why God would ask people
 to do this or I don't understand what's going on or this does not feel like a loving thing
 to do.
 I'm confused as to what's going on.
 Allow those things to trouble you because the trouble will lead you to answers to satisfy.
 Yeah.
 Way too many people just either gloss over it, disconnect.
 I'm staying engaged, ask the Holy Spirit.
 Like you said, he's the author.
 He knows what's going on.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I was saying the same or a similar thing anyway
 to year one, I was saying,
 "Hey, when you read the word and you encounter places
 "where it kind of gets under your skin
 "and you're like, I think there's something more to this
 "but I don't know, like I don't know what it is
 "but it's kind of under my skin.
 "Don't let that go because I think it's an invitation
 "from the Holy Spirit to a revelation
 "that probably changes things for you."
  </li><li>Right.
 And point number four, I would encourage you to get a Bible study guide.
 Now, I'm not talking about anything fancy.
 You don't need to go buy a commentary on every book in the Bible.
 If you're buying a Bible, I'd encourage you to buy a study Bible.
 What a study Bible is, it's just a regular Bible.
 But usually somebody from the translation committee sits down.
 And every time you start a new chapter, they might write a page about the book,
 like who wrote the book, when it happened, what were some of the major events that were happening,
 why is it important today?
 And then as you read through it, there's usually...
 It's a bit like watching a movie with the director's commentary on.
 Right.
 There, you know, as you're reading a passage, there might be some little
 footnotes here and there, explain some of the more trickier passages or explain
 the context or help you understand.
 It's incredibly accessible.
 There's I use Bible software.
 And so I have the ESV study Bible, even though I don't really read the ESV translation,
 it works with any translation I'm using.
 I've got the NIV contextual.
 I'd have to put a link in the show notes to what it's properly called.
 but it explains the cultural context of the day.
 All these little things help you understand
 and give insights.
 It's like having a friendly Bible professor
 in the pages of your Bible that's gonna ask the question
 that you're probably thinking about
 as you're reading the passage.
 Hugely, hugely helpful, makes a world of difference
 and helps you understand what you might not know
 because you weren't alive in the Babylonian period
 so you don't understand the significance
 of what's written there.
 And I wanna encourage you, you shouldn't.
 One of the things we try and encourage our students all the time is it's not your fall.
 You have not been gifted with a complete understanding of world history and biblical narrative.
 No Christian should feel bad.
 They don't know that.
 Right.
 But also it's easily accessible with, you know, a light hard book to accompany your journey through scripture.
 And point number five, baby, what would you say?
 Definitely watch the Bible project videos.
 So, yeah, so good.
 Can't emphasize enough how good those videos are.
 TheBibleProject.com has all of these videos.
 They're free to watch and they've done all the books
 of the Bible and they give you the historical context.
 They give you some literary context.
 Like they explain the story and it's almost like
 reading the Cliffs notes.
 I don't know if they have Cliffs notes here.
 That's what we had them in Canada.
 But it's like reading the Cliffs notes
 of what it is that you're about to read.
 But it gives you so much background stuff
 that it makes it come alive.
 I love their videos.
  </li><li>And they're absolutely produced, brilliantly animated,
 brilliantly narrated.
 It's just an excellent ministry, the Bible Project.
 You can find them on YouTube, you can find them on the web.
 Really, really good.
 I'd highly recommend watching each book overview
 before starting that book in your plan.
  </li><li>Yeah, and they have an app too, don't they?
  </li><li>Well, conveniently.
 I don't know if they have an app.
 There's an app called the Read Scripture app
 that uses links to all of those videos
 that we're talking about.
 So basically, all five things that we just gave you
 are kind of available in this three-script trip.
 It's a reading plan, it's the ESV translation,
 it takes you through the whole Bible,
 there's videos along the way,
 they explain what's going on,
 and in 20 minutes a day, you can be reading the whole Bible.
 And so again, we'll put a link to all these resources
 in our show notes.
 And if you want our show notes,
 go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/201.
 And in case you don't know, my name is spelled A-L-Y-N.
  </li><li>And mine is just spelled A-J.
 You're welcome.
  </li><li>If there's books that you would like for further study,
 if you're thinking, "Oh, I love this.
 I would love more information on this."
 There's a couple of books that we could recommend.
 There's a brilliant book called
 How to Read the Bible for All It's Worth.
 It's by Gordon Fee and Douglas Stewart.
 And there's another book called
 Read the Bible for a Change by Ray Lubick.
 Both, I've got amazing titles, both really helpful books.
 At SSL, we use a book called Grasping God's Word,
 which is really helpful, but it's a massive book.
 The other two books are small, paper-bat books,
 easy to pick up, the other one's a bit of a tone,
 but again, links for those books
 are gonna be in the show notes.
 At the end of the day, I wanna encourage you
 that the Bible is way more accessible than you think,
 that if you're not reading the Bible,
 I wanna encourage you that the Bible is the filter
 through which everything else in the Christian life goes through.
 All revelation, all instruction, all doctrine, everything.
 If you can't see in the Bible, I'd be very suspicious about it.
 And it is easy to have a good working grasp of the scriptures.
 It's something that you can easily read.
 There's so many resources, so many excellent podcasts.
 The Bible Project Guys have a wonderful podcast too.
 I'd encourage you to do that.
 And if you have any questions about the Bible,
 about reading the Bible, reach out to us on Twitter.
 And we'd love to start dialogue with you about reading the Bible.
 Babe, it's been two months.
 We must have a listeners question by now.
 We have a backlog of those questions.
 Oh, no, I'm sorry.
 No, it's great.
 I found this brilliant question that's kind of related to what we're talking
 about.
 This is from Corinne and she asks, this is a great question.
 She says, I've been hearing a lot from the secular community about the law of
 attraction.
 They often quote Bible verses like "Ask and you shall receive" and they say if we
 believe and focus our thoughts on what we want, we'll get it.
 This seems congruent with the Bible because we're told to believe and not doubt in Jesus
 will answer our prayer.
 However, I've also heard many Christians warning that following this law leads to the
 desiring things of the flesh and even some saying that demons are the ones using this
 law, especially since its connection to new age beliefs.
 Is this law and the things its followers teach really dangerous or does it point to some
 true principles that Christians can use to achieve their goals on a godly way?
 How should Christians view this law in light of Jesus?
 AJ.
 Up until this point, I've never heard of the Law of Attraction.
 Neither died, but I'd heard of Google, so I did a quick Google search and found the
 LawofAttraction.com website where I read such gems as, and I quote, "Hundreds of years
 Years ago the law of attraction was first thought to have been taught to man by their
 mortal Buddha.
 And again quoting the law of attraction uses the power of the mind to translate whatever
 is in our thoughts and materialize them into reality.
 In basic terms all thoughts turn into things eventually.
 If you focus on negative doom and gloom you will remain under that cloud.
 If you focus on positive thoughts and of goals that you aim to achieve you will find a way
 to achieve them with massive action.
 So right off the bat, and I understand I'm being slightly flippant and I haven't done
 extensive research in this, but this was the first site that I kicked around on.
 You can see there's some non-Christian and decidedly new age overtones to the teaching.
 And I know Corinne that you mentioned that some people have been quoting the Bible versus
 with that.
 And you will probably find that a lot of new age teaching, a lot of secular teaching,
 overlap with teaching in Scripture, but it doesn't mean their interpretation of the
 thing is strictly biblical. So for example, we believe in the law of sowing and reaping.
 Do not be deceived. God cannot be marked, a man reaped for. He sows Paul teaches that
 principle really, really clearly. The Bible is filled with illustrations of that. Other
 people would call that karma. What goes around comes around. If we look at two Venn diagrams,
 there's a huge overlap between what the Bible teaches and what the world recognizes as karma,
 does the Bible teach karma? No, no, it teaches something different, but again you see overlaps.
 And I think that's what's going on here, that although they're quoting scripture, again,
 they're probably quoting scripture out of context and taking it to a degree that Jesus
 probably didn't have in mind when he was saying. So for example, you quoted an
 understand, Corinne, this is not you quoting, you're just telling me what other people have
 been saying, like asking you shall receive. So again, if you look at the context, I remember
 my dad teaching me this as a little boy, he would say, Ellen, if you take the text out
 of context, you're left with con. And I saw it always be suspicious. He taught me that
 I'm always suspicious when I hear people take a verse out of context and then declare this
 is what the text means. And we got to be careful of doing that. Like sometimes you can do that.
 But more often than not, it's really helpful to understand not only the context that the
 verses in, but the context of the passage of the letter or the author or the rest of
 the teaching. However, I digress. Matthew 21, Jesus said, "If you believe, you will receive
 whatever you ask for in prayer." So here, the context is Jesus is teaching his disciples
 about faith. And right there, we've got a different faith in God to perform his will
 is very different from the teachings of the law of attraction, which is, you know, if
 you want it, you just have to believe hard enough and you'll get it. I mean, we bypassed
 God and as kingdom in that principle. Another one that I found when looking up the law of
 attraction is Mark 923 where anything is possible if you believe. And again, proponents, it would
 seem of the law of attraction would say, "See, it's in the Bible. You just have to believe
 hard enough and it could be yours." But again, a close for inspection of that verse, you've
 got Jesus doing deliverance on a little boy with a deaf and dumb spirit and his father,
 the little boy's father's in distress, the disciples couldn't cast out the demon, it's
 kind of chaos and Jesus is using this point to help the father understand the power of
 faith.
 So completely different context.
 Basically what you end up with is this pseudo sounding biblical teaching like many other
 secular or new age teaching is basically trying to get us to achieve happiness and wealth without
 needing Jesus. Generally speaking, I'd encourage you to be very wary of teachings that have overlap
 with biblical teachings but are not founded on scriptural principles or better put anything
 that tries to replace Jesus, even if it works, right? When we talk about the Antichrist, we tend
 to think about a man with 666 around his forehead and maybe big horns and he's really good looking
 and he's going to take over the world. But anti-Christ in an original understanding would be anything
 that would replace Jesus. So whenever you hear teaching that doesn't require an active relationship
 with Jesus, be deeply suspicious that it's biblical. What do you think, Agee Jones?
 Yeah, I think well, obviously knowing the word of God actually helps us to have a filter for
 everything else. Right. Right. So like in Ephesians 4 verse 14 it says, "Then we will no longer
 be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about in every wind of new teaching.
 We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound
 like the truth." So we actually are aiming at being mature, aren't we? And part of maturity
 is as we spend time in the word, we grow mature in our faith and we're more easily able to identify things that are just not quite right.
 It's not again, this whole, I remember this from a childhood. I remember, I remember my parents telling me the story of a counterfeit expert who worked in the bank.
 And they could easily spot counterfeits, not because there were experts identifying counterfeits.
 They were so familiar with the genuine thing that whenever they felt counterfeit notes, they instantly knew it wasn't a real thing.
 That's awesome.
 And I would say the same thing.
 There's just so many people that I meet who are blown around by every wind of new doctrine
 because it's trying to achieve things that the Bible teaches the Lord wants to give us
 without having to submit to God to his kingdom or die to self.
 Right.
 If there's a shortcut that avoids sacrifice, it's probably not biblical teaching.
 So Corinne, I want to make sure that in answering that question, we haven't made it sound like,
 "Well, you know what, Corinne, if you'd actually read the Bible, you'd know this."
 Because clearly, you knew enough to be able to be suspicious and questioned this.
 So please don't hear that in our voice.
 I'm glad that you wrote in and you asked that question.
 And again, I apologize.
 I haven't done extensive research on this, but just at my first cursory glance, yeah,
 I'd probably give it a wide berth.
 And understand that there is a biblical principle at work.
 For example, in Proverbs 15 verse 15, it says,
 "For the despondent everyday brings trouble
 for the happy heart, life is a continual feast."
 And of course, Scripture does talk about us fixing our eyes
 on Jesus, the author and professor of our faith,
 and whatever is lovely and true,
 and no will think about those things.
 And so of course, the Bible teaches a huge amount
 about what we focus on and what we believe on.
 But again, anything that's trying to bypass
 an active relationship with Jesus
 in submission to him and his teaching
 ain't gonna be healthy.
 So, you know, temper everything that you hear through scripture and you're going to be in a great place.
 All right.
