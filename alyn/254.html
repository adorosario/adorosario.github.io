<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes sir.<br/>
 Episode 254.<br/>
 55.<br/>
 Talking about dealing with discouragement.
 Before we get to that encouraging topic about discouragement,
 we can catch up.<br/>
 Oh, OK.<br/>
 I know what you want to talk about.<br/>
 I can see it in your eyes.<br/>
 The iPhones?<br/>
 You want to talk about new iPhones?<br/>
 Mine's purple.
</p><ul>
  <li>Show me.
  </li><li>It's right here.
 Look.
  </li><li>We ended up with the same phones,
 but thankfully you got a case.
  </li><li>Well. - I'll show you it from the back.
  </li><li>Yeah. Mine's the same color, it's that blue color.
  </li><li>Yeah, but you got a little purple case.
  </li><li>I did for the first time in a long time.
 I decided to get a case for my iPhone.
 Normally I go tasteless.
  </li><li>Or naked, as I like to call it.
  </li><li>Okay, do you think?
  </li><li>Why'd you get a case this time?
  </li><li>I don't know, I just felt like I wanted a case.
 So I got one.
 And I got a purple one.
  </li><li>Any thoughts on the new phones?
  </li><li>I haven't really used it a ton so far.
 I mean, it's smaller 'cause I had the max before
 and now I have like the non-max, the normal.
  </li><li>The 13 pro normal.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It's not called normal.
 We both got identical phones.
  </li><li>It's lighter and it fits better in my leggings pocket,
 which that's all that really matters.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause before it felt like
 you had half an iPad strap to your thigh.
  </li><li>It's true, I like needed some sort of yeah.
 Mine, because I had the mini, I've gone up in size.
 So mine feels big in cumbersome,
 yours feels small and lighter.
  </li><li>But at least yours in your hands
 doesn't look like you're using a play phone anymore.
 It looks like you're using a normal-
  </li><li>I think- - On a size phone.
  </li><li>I've used it for what, 24 hours?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I was thinking of switching to the 13 mini.
  </li><li>Oh please don't.
  </li><li>But I'm spoiled for the promotion, the 120 Hertz display.
 Have you even noticed the display?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>All right.
 What do you mean?
 What am I supposed to have noticed?
  </li><li>Look at the family, they look so great on this display.
 Is that what you meant?
  </li><li>No.
 But anyway, we got new iPhones, yay.
 Which I actually need to update Twitter
 because when we ordered, we had nothing but problems.
 And I said our ship date wouldn't be like
 until like October 15th or something.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But Apple did it solid and they fixed it.
  </li><li>They fixed it and we got them the first day.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 You were teaching at the school on Father Heart.
 How was that?
  </li><li>Yes, Father Heart Week.
 It was great.
 It was really good.
 I was like it when people were crying.
 So people were crying.
 So I was fine.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>I got to be with our online students this week.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>Ah, it's so much gladness.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
  </li><li>It was nice to see her first students,
 but it was fun for me to be with our second year students
 online who are made up of a cohort
 of our first year online students.
 So it's really nice to be back with a group of people
 I'm already familiar with.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's really good.
  </li><li>We all smashed a squeeze in a date.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>Yeah, which is so hard to do.
 Like when you work from home largely,
 we're around each other all the time.
 and COVID, which means we haven't really been out.
 And then Fridays are our day off in the kids' room school.
 So we'd like to take advantage of it.
  </li><li>I had four days off this week.
  </li><li>Talk about that.
  </li><li>Well, I, about two weeks ago,
 I worked like 12 days in a row or something.
 And so I had a couple days in lieu that I could take.
 And so I took them off on Wednesday and Thursday.
 So I had Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday off.
 And it was glorious.
 And you let me sleep in on Wednesday and Thursday,
 both mornings you got up at six with the kitties and I slept in.
 I'm kind of a spiritual giant that way.
 What did you do with your days off?
 Um, I was forbidden from speaking to you.
 You weren't forbidden.
 Yes, I was.
 You gave me eyes of hate.
 Because again, I'm working from home all day.
 Yeah.
 Wednesday and Thursday.
 No, I just made you sit in the office with the doors close so I
 couldn't hear you, which means you're going to overheat because
 there's not the right level of ventilation or something in that
 office.
 Too much sun.
 Yeah. I read books. I played two dots.
 So it's called two dots.
 And I have another one where I sort balls into test tubes.
 Colored balls into test tubes.
 I don't know. It's called like sort 3D or so.
 I know it's a third tick for me.
 You just that's what you play.
 Uh huh. Yeah.
 You're so sweet.
 So that's literally what you did.
 You just played some Zelda.
 Yeah, no, it's got some headphones in for most of the day.
 Yes. And I made some more Hello Fresh meals. We had some new Hello Fresh meals.
 I reminds me to pick next week's meals. And yeah, I mean, that was it. I kind of just, I just chilled.
 Last week's episode was all about kindness. And shortly after we recorded that episode,
 somebody sent me a link on YouTube. I need to look up the guy's name. His name is Jimmy Darts.
 So if you go to Jimmy Darts on Instagram, it's my new favorite Instagram account.
 Oh no. So Jimmy Darts...
 You don't want his own favorite anymore?
 Yours... no.
 No.
 That's because I never post.
 Jimmy Darts collects money. He has like, you know,
 I guess people who support him.
 Yeah.
 And then they send him random acts of kindness to go do,
 and then he goes does them and films it.
 And he's so sweet. He's a lovely guy.
 And he just films like somebody might be just saying,
 Ask somebody if you can cut in line and the first person who lets you cut in line, give them $500 for letting you cut in line.
 Yeah.
 Or, you know, go find somebody who's having car trouble and give them $1,000.
 So he'll just drive around trying to find somebody who's having car trouble.
 Right.
 And then give them $1,000.
 Right.
 Go up to somebody and ask if you can have a pair of their shoes and if they say, "Yes, give them $500."
 Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
 Right.
 So I'll bet a link in the show notes to him.
 It's, it's, it's, you know, seriously.
 Oh, that's cool.
 Jimmy Dart.
 Jimmy, Jimmy Darts.
 Darts.
 I think he must be a Bethel person.
 Okay.
 He doesn't mention that, but I just based on who I follow
 and who he follows and the people that we know maybe.
 You're extrapolating that he might be a Bethel-ish person.
 Yeah, I think so.
 And he's in California.
 I don't know if he lives in writing, but anyway,
 I thought I wouldn't surprise me if he's got some sort of...
 I love that.
 That's such a great idea.
 Background.
 Yeah.
 All right, dealing with discouragement or topic for this week.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>At first glance sounds kind of depressing
 to talk about discouragement.
 But here's the thing, to imagine you go through life
 without experiencing discouragement
 is to imagine that you're not human.
 Because to be human is to experience bouts of discouragement.
  </li><li>Yes, and you're talking about like big discouragements,
 not like I burnt everything that we're eating
 for dinner kind of discouragement.
  </li><li>I mean, I don't wanna, you know,
 I don't wanna put a limit on it.
 I'm just talking about like the human condition
 where we are discouraged.
 which you read all of the saints in scripture,
 were discouraged at one point or another.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>And I wanna encourage you,
 it's not a sin to be discouraged.
 It's not even a sin to be discouraged
 for an ongoing period of time,
 but if that's what we're gonna experience in life,
 right?
 'Cause God is good, but life is tragic.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>How do you cope with discouragement?
  </li><li>Good, that's what we're talking about.
  </li><li>Yeah, and the answer isn't chocolate.
 Well, it's sometimes it's chocolate or crunchy food.
 Or, no, see, those are the nice versions
 of addiction that we don't have any.
 False comfort.
 Yes.
 I was saying we were talking about this.
 They're nice though, they really are nice.
 Let's talk about them.
 We're just a moment, my God.
 Before I say that, I will never help you.
 Yes.
 We were talking about this in the car on the way home.
 And we were talking about how we used to deal
 with discouragement as opposed to how we deal
 with discouragement now.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we will have a good chuckle at our expense.
 When we talk about how we deal with discouragement,
 I want you to imagine a spectrum,
 two ends of the same spectrum.
 I'm gonna give you an approach to dealing with discouragement
 and at one end is one thing
 and at the other end is another thing
 and everything in between is good.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Let me talk about the two ends of first.
 The first end is to shock, feel your feelings.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 like actually you need to feel your feelings
 'cause if you don't like,
 discouragement is not gonna go away,
 it's just gonna be like, "Oh, he's still here."
 The other end of that experience is to use the word of God.
 All right, to actually use the word of God
 in the promises of scripture
 to combat the circumstances you're facing.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I'm gonna suggest that you do both end.
  </li><li>Meet in the middle.
  </li><li>Do all of them, like don't meet in the middle.
 Like you've gotta do that and you've gotta do that.
 Run the whole gamut of those things.
 Live with both of them, intention,
 because if you don't, you're either gonna live in denial
 where you're over here quoting scripture
 and pretending all your circumstances don't exist,
 or you're gonna live self-absorbed
 and full of self-pity going woe is me.
 And you're never gonna get out of any.
 Historically, I would say I've lived over here.
 Let's just quote some scripture out of it.
 Let's just shut down our heart and let's just power through.
 And I don't remember living discouraged.
 I just remember probably discouraging everybody
 who's close to me because I wouldn't deal with reality.
 But it's that whole thing,
 you remember the feelings thing we did last year?
 That if you don't deal with the feelings,
 if you don't feel your feelings, if you don't give them
 to God, if you don't talk about your feelings,
 you're just gonna live out with the impairments of it.
 And everyone, instead of you feeling your sadness,
 everyone else is gonna feel your self-pity.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Right, instead of you feeling your fear,
 everyone else is gonna feel your rage.
 So that your feelings that you're not trying to feel
 are gonna come out somehow,
 so you may as well sit with them.
 But don't sit with them at the exclusion of ignoring scripture.
 Neither do you want to run to scripture without actually being real or you'll
 just end up this fraudulent hyper religious person thoughts.
 Yes.
 I mean, and I don't, I think on the side of scripture, you could also replace
 scripture with logic, like just running to having a better plan, a more reasonable,
 you know, more reasonable logic, whatever the thing is, maybe you don't throw
 scripture versus at it. But whatever it is, you're not valuing feelings and you're thinking
 your way out of something.
 So you're moving away from your heart.
 Just moving away from your heart to never have to feel.
 Right. So because I'm just thinking like, I know I definitely had seasons where, yeah,
 I would try and throw scripture at something until it was buried, which never really successfully
 worked for me that well. I mean, I would feel like it worked at times in the moment, you
 know, until you're alone again by yourself and your apartment or whatever.
 And then all it's still there, you know, and you're still trying to toss scripture
 verses at it.
 Um, but also I had seasons where I might have not have taught scripture verses,
 but I certainly tried to plan and logic my way out of the feelings that I felt.
 What did they give me an example of?
 What, what would that look like?
 What would you, how would you plan not to feel?
 Oh, well, first you just shut down your heart and decide that everything that
 your feeling is just has no basis in reality
 and how ludicrous to feel anything.
  </li><li>Right, 'cause you're more than a conqueror in Christ.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And your mind is more powerful, of course.
  </li><li>So you just deny, okay, so--
  </li><li>Just deny everything.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Deny everything you're feeling.
 And then come up with what I would have called a man plan
 for your way out of--
  </li><li>Why is it a man plan?
 Is man an acronym for something?
  </li><li>No, it's just like, you know how man always wanna like,
 They want to help you.
 Logic your way out of it.
 Logic your way out of it.
 And then here's your here's your five step plan for, you know, whatever.
 So so give me an example from from previous life where an example you were
 discouraged by and what your man plan was because now I'm fascinated.
 And now I can't.
 I mean, you're single.
 It's been years and it doesn't look like there's any viable dates on the horizon.
 What was your solution?
 Yeah.
 Tell me.
 Okay.
 Man plan is, you know what?
 This clearly wasn't God's plan for your life anyway.
 Right.
 So discount everything that you're feeling,
 all the little nays, whatever.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I remember, actually right before we met,
 my plan was, okay, so none of this has worked out.
 And so my new plan is I am now going to choose
 to stay single, I'm going to shut down my heart.
 I'm never gonna have children, I'm not gonna want children.
 And I am just gonna go and travel and bring the kingdom
 wherever I go.
 And I have this plan now that's all about the,
 keeping the walls around my heart
 and bringing the kingdom.
  </li><li>And that will compensate for all my natural desires
 to want to make and to want children.
  </li><li>Because me and Paul from the Bible,
 we're gonna be single and do this thing.
  </li><li>And do you remember coming up with that plan?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>And it was a great solution.
  </li><li>It's a solid plan.
 Solid plan.
 Until I was generally that day in PEI and the Lord was like,
 "The man I have for you."
 This is why it was ruining my plan,
 because I was like, wait, what?
  </li><li>PEIs Prince Edward Island for people who are not
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So you'd already come up with this plan on your own?
  </li><li>Oh, yes.
  </li><li>Okay, and you had one of the kids,
 you'd wanted to be married, your first husband left you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so you--
  </li><li>And then I was single for eight years after that,
 and I just decided--
  </li><li>You'd have got for five words.
  </li><li>I'm 30 something now, my clock is ticking,
 all ladies, once they hit their 30s,
 they're like, my clock is ticking, my clock is ticking.
 So I was like, hey, I'm now, whatever, I was 32, 33,
 I probably need to give up on that dream
 and come up with a more reasonable dream.
  </li><li>I didn't talk to the Lord about this,
 you just came up on this on your own.
  </li><li>Yes, I needed a plan.
  </li><li>Because were you aware of feeling sad, lonely, longing?
  </li><li>Yes, of course, and a plan
 because I'm a very high shaper gives me comfort.
 So having a plan therefore gave me some other way
 to focus and not have emotions and not feel things.
  </li><li>What would you like to be around
 when your girlfriends were falling in love?
 Were you just?
  </li><li>I'm sure I was a joy.
 sure they really loved having me around. I don't know, actually.
 I don't know.
 I think, well, that's nice for them.
 I think so.
 But because I'm a spiritual giant and Paul said it's better to, you know,
 you know, for those who handle it, a lot to marry.
 At the time, probably most of the people I hung out with were either not dating
 anyone or already married had been for ages and I was friends with both spouse.
 So I don't think I, I don't remember during the, and it was only a couple of
 months between making the plan and meeting you.
 Sorry for ruining that.
 What sounded like a perfect plan, though.
 You know, it was, yeah, I was such a great plan.
 So your man plan was?
 My man plan was basically.
 To vote myself to the kingdom.
 Yeah.
 And that's gonna help me to feel nothing.
 Let's go all the hallmarks of a genius plan.
 I know.
 It's biblical, it's script row.
 It's yes.
 Sounds great.
 It moves away from all your like,
 "Yeah!"
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So one day the Lord is just like, about that plan of yours.
 Yes.
 And what was that like because he's now inviting you back into mystery?
 Well to begin with, I wasn't that thrilled about it, which is why I spent an entire day
 crying.
 So what were the tears about?
 The tears were about realizing a whole bunch of things like that as much as I thought I
 was living open to God, I had built a wall around my heart and really didn't want to
 talk to him about relationships or any of the disappointments that I had.
 Wow.
 And when again, when I journal and he said, the man that I have for you will pursue you.
 He will worry with kindness.
 It was terrifying information because that means I actually have to be open again.
 I have to feel things.
 I have to risk it.
 I have to, you know, so I spent the better part of four and a half hours crying, you
 know, which I'm not a big crier.
 Is there any sense that you were like,
 "Oh Lord, if I open up my heart and you don't follow through,
 the pain of disappointment is far larger
 than the pain of never even hoping that this is real?"
  </li><li>Oh, I'm sure.
 'Cause I've processed so many other things that way.
 I'd rather just not hope.
 So then I don't get disappointed.
  </li><li>It makes so much sense now why you've vomited
 when you met me and I told you that this is what
 my goals were.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 'Cause you repeated to me what I had journaled
 when I was-- - That's fulfilling
 the word of the Lord.
  </li><li>Yes, and so I just needed to quickly nip to the loo
 and vomit so that I could appear normal.
 Yes.
 You have to admit it would have been worse
 had I vomited sitting at the table,
 so you should be thankful really.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So you are familiar with the,
 I will shut down my heart and I will,
 I mean, in one sense you won't quote scripture,
 but you're using scripture as a justification
 to never have feelings about being single
 for the rest of your life.
  </li><li>Yes.
 determined your future because it's less painful than living with potential.
 Yeah. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. And I would say that's, that was like sort of historically
 my pattern until chip dot and all this feeling nonsense comes into play, you know,
 that typically it would be easier just, Hey, if you don't actually have expectations,
 you can't get disappointed, then you won't have feelings that are outside of your control.
 I'm so curious if that worked because on paper, it sounds great.
 Like if I don't have any expectations and now we'll never be disappointed.
 Therefore, I can never.
 Now you're just pretending you don't have them.
 Oh, so.
 Or you're wishing you didn't have them.
 So you're discouraging everyone away.
 No, no, no, no.
 It just it hid at times for short periods of time.
 And then we'll spring up and be like, Hey, hey, human.
 Yeah.
 I'm your feeling human.
 Now that you've eaten all those pretzels, I'm still here.
 I was talking to a friend on Friday, I think it was Friday or Thursday this week.
 And they knew had an event coming up and they were like, "Hey, how did this event go?"
 And I'm like, "Well, if I told you that I feel like crying because you asked me and
 I've eaten three bags of popcorn, would that give you an indication of how it went?"
 And I was like, "Oh yeah, my feelings taste delicious."
 They do go away.
 But it was skinny pop.
 So surely that's fine.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think that's a bad idea.
  </li><li>It's practically healthy.
  </li><li>That's a bag of normal.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>All right, so we're gonna feel our feelings.
 Quick recap, why do you wanna feel your feelings, Ajay?
  </li><li>Well, primarily because God gave you feelings.
 I mean, he gave us the capacity to feel.
 And then most of us, either through training or choice,
 figure out how to try and shut those things off.
  </li><li>I love what Chip said when we asked him,
 you know, he said, "I don't really like feelings.
 "This is a guy that wrote the book on feelings.
 "Like, I don't really like them."
 you know, some of them are scary, you know,
 but you feel your feelings get to the reward
 and the reward is full living.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, you know, you and I were talking earlier
 about an area in my life where I'm feeling discouraged about
 and, you know, my process with the Lord is like,
 "Lord, I feel discouraged about this area."
 And he's like, "Yeah, it makes sense why you'd feel discouraged
 because the description you've just given me
 of this area of your life that is sad and that is lonely
 Yeah, that that would make sense why you're feeling sad and while you're feeling lonely and there was a you know part of
 My reluctance to feel my feelings is I don't want to get in touch with how desperate it is
 I would rather just you know power through keep prophesying future and right it's it's
 Fascinating being with the Lord going yeah, that that is a bleak situation. Would you like to give it to me?
 You're like whoa, I mean, I don't know what are you gonna do with it? I mean maybe nothing
 Maybe that's the reality of this season and I'll still meet you in your sadness and loneliness.
 Yeah, you know, it's amazing when you discover that God isn't a fairy godmother who's going to make, you know,
 like I'll instantly change everything rather
 I mean the Lord is just like yeah Alan
 But the beauty of this season is it's doing something beautiful in your heart. Yeah, I'm like well, I'm not sure it's beautiful
 It's painful
 But you know we trust the Lord and so much of life makes sense when we look backwards and go
 Oh God, you're so, so brilliant.
 You know, he redeems things in a different way.
 I say that and I think about your marriage,
 your first marriage.
  </li><li>Oh good, I'm glad you're talking about the first one.
 I was like, if we're speaking of it as my marriage
 and not your marriage, there's probably a problem.
  </li><li>No, I was thinking about how you prayed
 for years for your first marriage to be restored.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then the Lord said,
 "I'm going to redeem it in a different way."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, and he did.
  </li><li>And it's me.
  </li><li>You. - Same wa.
  </li><li>Say you.
  </li><li>All right, so feeling of feeling super important
 'cause you actually get in touch with your heart
 and get in touch with the circumstance of what God's doing.
 Why is it also important then to not just camp out
 with the feelings part and also bring in the word of God part?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I think to some extent,
 like when I think about when I would actually get
 in touch with my feelings, often the Lord would actually
 drop the word into the midst of my feelings, right?
 So I have two thoughts with that.
 I have one, I remember hearing a quote,
 I think it's from Abby Stumble,
 where she was talking about,
 is that how you say her last name?
  </li><li>I don't know who you're talking about.
  </li><li>She's from Bethel, but talking about,
 "Hey, your feelings, like feelings are great,
 but they're like children.
 You can't let them drive the car.
 You also can't stick them in the trunk."
  </li><li>Can't lock them in the trunk.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 like neither one of those are a healthy response.
 But I know in moments when life did feel overwhelming,
 like after my first marriage dissolved
 and before I met you and whatever,
 when I did allow myself to feel my feelings,
 usually only when I was by myself and nobody could see me.
  </li><li>Whoa.
  </li><li>The Lord would say the same verse to me all the time
 about a bruised read he would not break
 in a smoldering wick.
 Wick, he will not step out, step out.
 And like, I remember just sitting there going, okay,
 like even if I am how I viewed it as we can desperate,
 like, oh God, I just, I feel like I don't even know
 how to do tomorrow.
 He's gonna help me through it.
 Like he's gonna make sure I don't break
 and I don't, I don't snuff out.
 So I think there is something about you in the midst of feeling your feelings,
 keeping your face turned towards him and your ears tuned to him for his encouragement
 and for what he's sending your way.
 Our pastor, Jeff Daller, has been doing a great series at Grace Center at the moment,
 all about the power of the Word of God.
 You know, the Word of God is sharper.
 It is a live sharper than two-edged sword.
 I'm talking about our imagination.
 I remember Gary Morgan saying that worry is a great misuse of imagination.
 Yeah.
 But talking about allowing the word to paint a more, you know, a better future in your
 imagination so that you can live towards it.
 It's a really powerful thing.
 And I think of the time when our, we used our prophecies and we used our, and the scriptures
 to help counterbalance the reality of our life.
 So we've told about this before,
 when Patricia King came, gave this word,
 you know, four words all about finances.
 And in the time, and that time that we had that,
 we were crippled and dead,
 we were struggling to make ends meet.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And the reality of our situation was stark,
 and we could prove it.
 We could prove it by not being able to make ends meet.
 We could prove it by showing your bank statement.
 And so we needed something to hang on to,
 not in denial as in, well, you know, these scriptures say this, therefore we can just
 live irresponsibly knowing that God's gonna, you know, God doesn't order what he doesn't
 pay for. God doesn't pay for what he, no, God doesn't order what he won't pay for. And,
 you know, you know, you know, you can just quote, miss you scriptures. But rather we wrote
 up these prophetic words, we wrote these verses on our bathroom mirror on our phone on the
 wallpaper of our computer, to remind us this is the future that God has for us. And where
 we are right now is a present, it's a present reality, but it's not our future circumstances.
 Yeah. And using those scriptures to not only combat a reality, but also shape how we look
 at things. One of the things we do at Grace and our every week is we make declarations
 when we bring our offering and our tithe to the Lord. And the reason for that is we're
 speaking over our finances so that we're not passive.
 Yeah.
 I think that I love the way that you just explained that.
 I think for me, it's feeling your feelings, but then also in the midst of feeling your
 feelings, aligning your expectations with God because both of those things are true.
 Yes.
 I do feel overwhelmed and you said that you've given me a glorious hope and a glorious future
 and you do have plans to prosper.
 And you're never going to leave her for sake me and actually, you know what I mean?
 So I think, yeah, it's holding on to both of them with equal strength and not weighing
 either of them heavier or lighter than they are.
 So we've got, you know, what I'm going to talk about next, the practical steps that
 you can employ to help you deal with seasons of discouragement or fitting within this tension
 of actually being real, feeling your feelings, honoring your heart,
 honoring the scriptures, allowing the word of God to paint a future that you're going to live in
 that you presently can't see. Everything we're going to say next fits within that context. If
 you take what we're going to say next out of that context, I have fear that the advice we're
 we're going to give you just empty platitude.
 Right.
 So you're saying living inside this tension of both and here's some tips.
 Here's some tips.
 OK.
 And I think I've got three of them.
 Oh, of course.
 I was telling you the other day that you're either going to have three or five.
 But often when I speak, I just declare how men I have and then that many appear in my head.
 Wow.
 Like often when I'm in conversation, you know, when I'm teaching, it's a little different
 because I've done pre thought.
 But often when I'm in dialogue with people, I'll be like, OK, here's four things you need
 you know. And I don't have those four things. I just think there's four things and then
 the four things come.
 Oh, that's so funny because I would go the opposite direction and say, here's a few things
 I think would be helpful so that I'm actually locked into a number in case I need to go
 over or under as the case.
 That's so funny. Yeah. Well, I think I've got three. Okay.
 Three. Number one is you've got to get your feelings outside of yourself. Yeah. Feeling
 your feelings is good, but you got to talk about them because if you don't, you will
 go stir crazy. We are our own worst counselors. Yes. So you've got to find safe people who are
 not going to try and fix you to talk. Yeah. I would include God in that. But the notion that you can
 only talk to God and not other people is misunderstanding why God put you in community. Right. Like if
 all we ever needed was Jesus in terms of our relational capacity, he wouldn't give us the body.
 Right. He wouldn't have given us the body. Yes. Yeah. So, you know, talk, otherwise,
 you're going to go start crazy.
 Right. Find safe community.
 Find safe community.
 That isn't threatened by emotion.
 Isn't threatened by emotion.
 And isn't upset with you for having feelings
 that might be contrary to what they're feeling.
 Yeah.
 And they're not going to take that you're sharing
 of how you're feeling as an invitation to try and quote
 and quote fix you.
 Yes.
 So get your feelings outside of you.
 So because I called it a man plan before, can we reiterate?
 So, you know, Alan and I, we've talked about this
 in a couple of different podcasts.
 And mostly it's usually about like married, you know, married type things.
 But we've talked about listen like a boy or listen like a girl.
 Which I don't really like those gender stereotypes.
 Well, they kind of work.
 Unfortunately.
 Explain what it means to listen like a boy versus listen like a girl.
 So listen like a boy is listen for how could I help you fix that?
 Like, how could I help you come up with a plan?
 How could I fix that for you?
 We're listening like a girl, you know, we're talking about the girls that go, oh,
 Yeah, you know, and they're not trying to fix anything. They're just connecting with you. Yeah, could could we rephrase it as listen with empathy?
 Sure and listen with intent. I
 Mean we could put it, you know, it sounds sexier listen
 not sexier, but all I'm saying is listen, we're five years into this podcast.
 We've been saying boy or girl the whole time, they get the idea.
 Yes.
 So being empathetic or having people just be with you and just be like, that
 does sound hard or just to validate what you're going through and not talk
 you out of your feelings or not.
 Do you know what you want to do?
 You know what you should do?
 You know, I did when I had that.
 Like that's probably not going to be helpful at that point.
 Yeah.
 Second thing is all about perspective.
 Yeah.
 When we are discouraged, it is so important that we have a proper perspective of what's going on,
 or we will be swallowed up by discouragement.
 So how do you get a proper perspective?
 Well, it's important to understand that you look at it from a couple of different perspectives.
 One perspective is what's happening right now is just a season.
 It's an event and this two shall pass.
 Like my mother used to say that all the time, Ellen, this two shall pass.
 I say that in my head all the time.
 Like mom, is that you?
 Why are you in my white side?
 Probably. Yeah. Yeah.
 Yeah. But it's true.
 Like there is a there is a temptation
 to think this is now my lot in life.
 This is what life will look like.
 No.
 Yes.
 No, there was a time before you felt like this
 and there will be a time when you don't feel like that.
 Honestly, I say that a lot about COVID.
 This too shall pass.
 It's taking a while.
 Pass a lot.
 Never mind.
 But this too shall pass.
 So yeah, that perspective of like this tool will pass.
 this is a season. The second type of perspective it's worth considering is let's say you're having
 difficulty at work. Let's say you're having a work relationship that's causing you distress.
 Okay. It's important to understand that you're that thing is very real and is affecting you at work,
 but your life is made up of more than just work. Yes. So you have a beautiful family, you have
 a life outside of work or put another way, you're having difficulty with a family member, right?
 You're just like, oh my gosh, my mom or my dad or my sister or my brother, you're having a sibling
 conflict. Understand that your life is larger than just that conflict. So you've got a friend
 group, you've got a church community. And it's so important that we don't waste time trying to
 tell ourselves not to feel things about the thing that's causing us trouble, but instead use that
 energy to focus on the things that give us joy in life. So for example, you're like, yes,
 I am having relational discord with my brother. Yes. Yes, he's driving me nuts. Yes, he keeps
 making decisions that are causing me sleepless nights and heartache and perhaps financial ramifications.
 But I also have a beautiful spouse and beautiful children and I live in a great area and there's
 a park and I can go for a walk. And that sounds like you're talking yourself out of what you're
 feeling. It's not, it's you learning to appreciate the things that you have got going well for you.
 you rather than being overwhelmed and avalanche by this thing.
 Right.
 Because often we're spending time stressing or again, using our imagination for worry about
 things we cannot control because somebody else is making decisions.
 And so it's actually if we can actually focus on the things that we do have a say
 in and that are going, well, that's a lot more, it's a healthier, it's going to
 give us a healthier perspective.
 Would you like to know one of my new favorite apps?
 I would.
 It's called Pearl Pearl.
 P-E-A-R-L in case you can understand my accent.
 All right.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Pearl.
 That's how you spell it.
 And basically all it is is an app that interrupts your day with reminders of
 things you want to remind you.
 It comes preloaded with some reminders, but I like set up some reminders.
 Like I used to be drowning in debt, but now I'm not and I live in abundance.
 Right.
 And so I'll just be going through my day and it will just stop on my phone or my
 watch will just go, Hey, I used to be drowning in debt, but now I'm not.
 I'm living in abundance and I'm like,
 "Oh Lord, you're right.
 "I remember what it was like.
 "I remember literally what it was like,
 "not knowing how to make ends meet.
 "And now I don't live like that and I'm so grateful."
 Or just something simple like,
 "Don't give up hope."
 "Oh, I'm not gonna give up hope."
 And it just reminds you throughout the day
 and you can write your own little flashcards pop up
 on your phone as a notification or pop up on your watch.
 Sounds simple, sounds trite,
 but it gives you something else to focus.
 I just want a list of things I'm thankful for.
 Right. So you're talking about a thankfulness. That's what I use the pictures on my iPhone.
 You know, I have that bigger window, whatever it's called. A widget. A widget.
 And so the different, you know, pictures come up and pictures shut up.
 Well, anyway, I look at that. On iOS 14 and iOS 15. Yes. There is a widget for the photos app
 where you can just add it to your home screen and it will through the genius of artificial
 intelligence and machine learning surface photos that you've long forgotten even exist and like
 Higher than nine times out of ten. They're excellent photos, aren't they? I mean, they're just a brilliant photo
 They're often ones. I haven't looked at forever and I just it turns me to thankfulness like right away like oh
 I'm so thankful for that person or you know for that
 It's not usually the moment it's usually the people in the photograph
 I'll frequently screenshot my home screen and send it to the person
 My phone reminded me of today, just want to say I love you.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So I mean, I love that too.
 I think thankfulness is a great way of regaining perspective.
 The photos widget and the parallel app, I'll put a link in the show.
 Perfect.
 The third thing.
 So first thing is like, get your feelings out of you.
 Like speak.
 Yeah.
 Number two.
 Perspective.
 Perspective.
 Thank you.
 Oh, I'll be fine.
 You're welcome.
 Number three is pay attention to the company you keep.
 because some of your company might be fueling
 your discouragement.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I mean, if you just get with other people
 that are like-minded in their discouragement
 and just hang out with them.
  </li><li>Or people who have,
 whose lives run on trauma.
 They're fueled by trauma and anger and distress.
 And so they want to,
 because perhaps they don't know another way out.
 They get their energy from things being wrong.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so they wanna point out what's wrong with the world.
 That's a pretty toxic environment to be in.
 So, but again, if you don't know anything different,
 you might think that's normal.
  </li><li>But then I would put that,
 I agree with what you're saying,
 and you're saying, watch the company you keep.
 But under company you would keep,
 I would also put music you listen to,
 podcasts you listen to.
  </li><li>Twitter feeds you listen follow.
 Because those, that would all feed the same thing of people that choose to continuously
 live in contention.
 You say that and I realize that there is a really interesting dynamic that I'm aware
 I do in my life and I'm sure I'm not alone in this, is where we outside outsource our
 problem to fiction.
 And what I mean by that is we're drawn to TV shows that are dealing with the issues
 that we're dealing with so we don't have to deal with them.
 So we watch shows about characters
 who are experiencing the same distress as us.
 So we watch Victory happen,
 or we have Commiseration
 without actually having to engage in our own story.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Or we watch stuff that is like so far removed.
 Like there's a whole bunch of TV shows
 that I don't wanna watch that everybody loves,
 that I'm just like,
 that sounds like marriages breaking up,
 you know, problems with children.
 You know, all the kind of stuff
 that we will sit down and pray with people
 for which I want to do, but then I'm gonna feel like,
 I often watch those shows and I realize I've spent time,
 like when I got in the bathroom, whatever,
 praying for fictional characters from a TV show,
 because-- - She used to be like that with ER.
 You would be praying and tongue for the person in surgery,
 and I'd be like, babe, fiction, fictional character.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, so I go the other way,
 as opposed to wanting to watch a TV show
 that is similar and I get to work it out that way.
 I'm like, I can't.
  </li><li>You wanna go the other way for discretion?
  </li><li>Yeah, I want to watch something about aliens
 or something that's far removed from any form of reality,
 like Avengers or something.
  </li><li>Yeah, all I wanna say is just pay attention
 to the reasons you're hanging out with certain people
 because it could be that you're burning out
 your adrenal glands, finding comfort
 and other people being angry about the same thing,
 you're angry about.
 Instead of just being present with your pain
 and moving forward.
  </li><li>That's such a good point.
 I think too, like I know you've hit your three.
 Yeah, I didn't suppose one,
 so I don't own the Apple in the market.
 I think too, like we already said,
 everything is seasonal.
 So when you find yourself in a season of discouragement
 that you're like, this thing is not shifting.
 And I think that's a good time to go.
 Maybe this in this season,
 I'm gonna go get help shifting it.
 I'm so glad you mentioned that.
 Seriously, because what I wanted to say to people,
 Having struggled with mental illness in my early 20s.
 What I would wanna say is if you're listening to this
 and you've put these things into practice,
 but you're still feeling like you're sinking in life,
 it might be a good idea to get a professional perspective.
 Like there's no shame in going to a doctor,
 going to therapist, going to cancer, going,
 "Hey, I've employed various techniques
 "to help keep my head above water,
 but I'm feeling overwhelmed, sad, despondent, depressed.
 And getting an outside perspective
 because if there is a clinical problem,
 all the quoting of scripture in the world,
 all of the feeling your feelings is not gonna help
 if there's an underlying medical problem.
 And I wanna encourage you, go see an expert.
 That's certainly helped me, I remember being 21.
 Of course, I didn't know any of this stuff,
 but even then, if I did, I don't think it would have helped me.
 I mean, I had plenty of demons and I had a proper medical problem that praise the Lord
 through doctors and through the Holy Spirit got healed.
 Right.
 But I would hate for you to be listening to this thinking, you know, I just need to, you
 know, feel my feelings more, I need to quote scripture more if there's an online.
 Well, what I mean is like, if we were doing a podcast about stretching your muscles, but
 you'd broken your leg, right, the trick wouldn't be like, I guess I'm just a lightweight because
 I'm feeling pain when I'm fetching the muscle. No, you might need surgery in your life.
 Right. Physiotherapy. But also I think because you said like if you are, if you are drowning,
 if you're underwater, but I don't even think you need to get to your drowning, your underwater,
 your depressed. Like I think if you realize I'm spending a lot of time having to manage
 and process my emotions like more than normal, maybe that's the season where you just need
 some extra help, managing your emotions and diving into that
 with somebody who has a different perspective. So I have a
 therapist. Right. And my therapist isn't from my world per
 se, or you know, but he's helping me see things from a
 different point of view and helping me figure out where,
 hey, you're actually not connecting with your own
 emotions or your own needs. Or do you realize that you're doing
 XYZ and I'm like, no, I didn't know that.
 Um, and sometimes it's like, he, you know, he said a few things that you have said before,
 but when you said it, I was like, you know, well, you know, whatever, whatever my response
 was,
 I was pulling underwear.
 So you were distracted.
 I probably was.
 Yeah.
 Where, uh, you know, my therapist is fully clothed and so we're fine.
 You don't like
 and the professional and is not married to you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And has credibility to it.
  </li><li>Yes, and he very nicely points out things
 that probably if you had said them,
 I would be like, well, yeah, will you?
  </li><li>Do your mom?
  </li><li>Yeah, blah, blah, blah, you know, where, yeah.
 So, I mean, I just, I think there's seasons where
 it's just great to realize, you know what?
 I'm in a season where I need some outside help.
  </li><li>And it doesn't mean you're broken.
  </li><li>And maybe don't let it get to where you're drowning.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 Yeah, doesn't mean you're broken.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Doesn't mean you're...
  </li><li>No. - It means you're human.
  </li><li>There is no shame in needing help.
 We're built to need help.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>So. - All right.
 Well, there's any other thoughts
 on dealing with discouragement?
  </li><li>Just don't give up.
  </li><li>Don't give up.
 Oh, that's what my phone just said.
 Don't give up. - I did?
  </li><li>No, it didn't.
 But it often does.
 This is don't give up hope.
 All right, I have a listen question for you.
  </li><li>Oh, okay. - On the topic of feelings.
  </li><li>Oh dear. - This is a great question.
 This is from Amanda.
 And she asks,
 How do you go about cleaning up a mess
 when you realize you've made a mistake in a relationship?
 Not necessarily a romantic one.
 What are the practical steps to doing so,
 but also steps in regarding to processing
 your own feelings of guilt and bonus question,
 what's the difference between guilt and shame
 in those situations and how would they look?
 You tackle the first two, I'll tackle the last one.
  </li><li>Well, I can't even remember the first two.
 So give me some practical steps.
 You just realize you've made a boo boo in your relationship.
 How do you go and clean up that mess?
 Well, you apologize.
 Go just go and own your stuff.
 You realize you've made a mistake.
 You've hurt someone.
 Go and own that.
 And what would that look like going up and saying, Hey, Alan, I'm really sorry.
 I realize I snapped at you.
 I did whatever it is.
 You know, like go and own what you did and apologize for it.
  </li><li>Okay, hold that thought, I think you're perfectly right.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>What are some things that would minimize
 what you're doing there that sound helpful
 but ultimately wouldn't be?
 You're going to apologize.
 What are some things not to do when you go to apologize?
  </li><li>Oh, explain why actually your motivation of your heart
 was good and so you should be okay with it,
 but here's the thing, I still wanna apologize.
  </li><li>So when you try--
  </li><li>Justifying.
  </li><li>And justify, hey no no, I mean,
 what I meant to do or try and make it about their issue.
 I'm sorry that you were so oversensitive.
  </li><li>By Yvesack.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Like going low and slow.
 And actually inviting the person into,
 jury's out on this,
 but I'm leaning away from automatically apologizing.
 And actually going with an open hand
 and like being willing to apologize,
 but what they might not need is an apology,
 what they might just need is a connection
 or what they might need is a curious heart.
 Going, hey, when I said this thing,
 I have feelings of guilt,
 which tells me I've probably done something wrong
 'cause guilt tells us we've done something wrong
 and we need to repair a relationship.
 I feel guilty about this,
 but I'm realizing as I think about it,
 I'm interpreting my actions from my perspective.
 Did this hurt you when I said this?
 Like just opening up that.
 Is there anything you need in there?
 because they might not need an apology.
 Because what I've learned is often when I apologize,
 I apologize to ensure that you can have feelings anymore.
 So my apology isn't about,
 I am sorry for the thing I've done.
 It's I'm sorry you're having feelings
 and I've learned this really super Christian phrase
 where I say, I'm sorry,
 and now you're no longer allowed to have any feelings
 I can be okay, which is horrible.
 Like, so it's not when I say I'm not going with an apology,
 leading with an apology.
 It's not 'cause I don't want to apologize.
 It's actually I want to repair and you might not need like,
 I've realized in our relationship, which is romantic.
 Often you need space.
  </li><li>It is romantic.
  </li><li>You need space.
  </li><li>I do.
  </li><li>You don't need thorough breakdown of what happened.
  </li><li>I almost always, if we have some kind of run in,
 need space right away.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>And my effort to fix it so that I don't have my feelings
 of scale anymore.
  </li><li>Just frustrates me further.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So that's what I mean.
 When I say, you know, I'm not leading with apologizing.
 It's not that I don't want to own my stuff.
 I really do.
 I first want to explore because it's a little bit arrogant of me
 to imagine that I know why you might be hurt by what I said.
 Yeah.
 Because as we're learning, my track record at knowing
 what you're thinking is often off.
 Yeah, only like 95% of the time though.
 So.
 Well, it's 100% of the time because I know you're having feelings.
 It's just that I often guess the wrong one.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Okay, so I'm gonna have to reread the question.
 So that's the steps, but the other question,
 so like that's the steps.
 What do you do?
 You go repair it.
 Let me ask about repairing.
 One of the phrases I often hear from people
 as I'm coaching them is they're like,
 "Well, you know, I'm just waiting
 for the right opportunity."
 What do you think about waiting
 for the right opportunity
 as opposed to making the right opportunity?
  </li><li>Well, I would make the opportunity.
 I don't, I mean,
 I don't have a whole lot of confidence
 that the right opportunity is ever gonna come
 if you're waiting for something like some sort of sign
 or something.
 But I'm waiting for the right--
  </li><li>Probably not built that way.
  </li><li>Neither am I.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Waiting for the right opportunity to have confrontation.
 You'll have plenty of reasons to think
 it's not the right opportunity.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>A much better way is just saying,
 "Hey, can I talk to you because I,
 "and talk about yourself, like I use I statements.
 I felt when we so could we talk about it. Yeah. All right. So, Amanda, first thing is,
 if you're going to need to clean up a mess, just own it. Be curious. Step in. That's the
 practical steps to do and so. But also processing your own feelings of guilt.
 Well, you know, when we feel guilt, it's a gift from God that tells us that we've done something
 wrong. And if we sit with our feelings of guilt, that leads us to our need for forgiveness and
 and our need to repair things.
 And here's the beautiful thing.
 Okay, let me paint a really sketchy situation.
 Let's say I'm in relationship with somebody
 who is highly manipulative.
  </li><li>Why are you touching my arm while you say this?
  </li><li>'Cause you're gonna be the highly manipulative person.
 In this example, this completely fictitious example.
 And this highly manipulative person gets off
 on watching other people be in distress
 because they like having the power over that person.
 But let's say I've also legitimately hurt the person.
  </li><li>Okay. - Or I've said something,
 I've snapped at them. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And now I have guilt because I've sinned
 in response to being sinned again.
 So let's say A.J. tries to control her, manipulate me,
 and I call her out on that, but I'm actually quite harsh,
 and maybe I've said some unkind words.
 I'm having guilt about that.
 And let's say I go to A.J.
 I listen to my guilt, and my guilt says,
 "Hey, Alan, that was unkind thing, you need to go own that."
 And I go to A.J. but she won't receive my, you know,
 no, oh, so you're back again?
 Oh, yeah, oh, you just think you can speak to me like that,
 and then you can just come back, cap and hand,
 think it's going to be okay. This manipulative person is not owning my, not
 owning their part, not wanting to receive my apology because they actually like
 having the power dynamic of like, oh, now the relationship's broken. I can
 leverage this somehow. Here's the beauty in your guilt, the very act of going with
 a heart of reconciliation, even if you can't be reconciled, will restore your
 heart to the peace that you need because you made an effort to go. So it's this
 win-win situation. You seek restoration and even if you don't get it, there's
 still a healing bomb that comes to your heart. Yes. That's important to know if
 you're dealing with somebody who doesn't want to deal with their thing. So good.
 Can you stop touching me now? What do you talk about the manipulative person?
 You're not a manipulative person. You're kind, you're courteous, you work out in
 your stuff. You've treated me with exceptional kinds and so much patience
 and some believable. You are as far from manipulative as I could imagine. Thank
 you. Does that feel better? Yes, much better. Great. No, that's all I needed.
 Okay, good.
 It's a check-in.
 I was trying to think when you were telling the story how I could act like a manipulative
 person but then I thought, "I don't actually know where we're going with this."
 So anyway.
 All right, the latter part of the question was, "What's the difference between guilt
 and shame in those situations and how would they look?"
 Guillain shame have got very similar impairments.
 That is, if you don't feel your guilt and if you don't feel your shame, you will end
 up in a place of toxic shame.
 Yes. All right. Your toxic shame when you're in a guilt might say, I don't need to apologize
 because it's still them and we'll make any difference. And you know what, I was in the
 right anyway, like it kind of turns haughty. Your toxic shame, if you don't feel your shame,
 might be, there's really no point in doing it because, you know, nothing ever changes and I'm
 such a bad person and they wouldn't even hear me if I went to reconcile.
 Guilt tells us, Hey, I've done something wrong. I don't need to repair it. And shame,
 if we listen to our shame, if we sit with our healthy shame, it leads us to a place of humility.
 That is, I've got limitations. So, for example, I was with a friend the other day, and they told
 me how I had hurt them. And I listened to them, and I genuinely hurt them. They were hurt by my
 behavior. And they didn't need anything on them. I think they just needed to share, "Hey, you hurt me."
 And also I'm going away not as a defense, but realizing, yeah, I understood that my limitations hurt you.
 And I have to make peace with that.
 Like I can't be everywhere at all times.
 And I I've got limitations.
 I can't be constantly by somebody side.
 I can't constantly serve them as much as I am.
 You can meet everybody's needs.
 You're one person.
 Yeah.
 And my limitation has caused you pain.
 And I'm sorry for the fallout of that.
 And I'm at peace understanding I've got limitations.
 That would be healthy shame in action,
 recognizing I've got limitations.
 I can't do everything, you know, all times.
 And it's important to sit with them.
 Another way of thinking about it is
 Gil lets us know we've done something wrong.
 Toxic shame tells us that we are.
 There is something wrong about us.
 Yeah, it's an identity thing.
 Yeah.
 Gil is an action oriented.
 Toxic shame is personal oriented.
 Like I am flawed rather than I did something flawed.
 I hope that helps.
 I hope it does too.
 AJ, if you had questions that you wanted to be asked on the show, where would you go?
 I would go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask.
