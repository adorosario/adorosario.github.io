<p> Do you have a jingle first this week?<br/>
 Um, um, that's another.<br/>
 Welcome to da da da da da da da da da da da da. No, not really.
 There's no lyrics to that. You just said welcome. You're working on it, which is great.
 I challenge you to download GarageBand on your iPad
 and come up with a jingle first by next week.
 Okay, you're gonna have to jump me into these GarageBand.
 No, no, no.<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
 Just to demonstrate your genius<br/>
 and the simplicity of Apple products.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I'd love if you just download it,<br/>
 play with it and come up with a soundtrack.
 Oh, you're on, baby.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Next week, ladies and gentlemen, we will have a jingle.
 (laughing)<br/>
 But the, keeping up with the Jones's podcast,
 I can't wait.<br/>
 Darling, how was your week?<br/>
 Hit me.<br/>
 It was, it was good.<br/>
 I don't remember being...<br/>
 Okay, it was a hard week.<br/>
 Okay, but it wasn't really hard.<br/>
 I think when anybody says like, how's your week going?
 You're like in comparison with what?<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Nobody died.<br/>
 No be sick.<br/>
 There's no bone.<br/>
 There's no blood.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 But it was just there was lots of like emotion.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 You want to talk about your emotion?<br/>
 That's okay.<br/>
 Let's go chronologically.<br/>
 Let's go emotional stuff over first.<br/>
 Tell us about the wall apocalypse of 2015.
 Okay.<br/>
 So here's the deal.<br/>
 You know how I was all excited about the wall that I was seeing.
 That's all you've been talking about.<br/>
 You have to describe Tarlusson is what the wall is.
 Okay, so we have an office again.<br/>
 And so on the office, because we, because we plan both year one and now year two,
 I designed a calendar that I could have within the same week listed what topics
 and what speaker is year one and year two so that I can make sure that I never
 us double book to be teaching on the same, you know, two different schools.
 I want to interject here just so they understand this calendar. How many feet wide is the calendar?
 11. So it's an 11 foot wide calendar that shows eight months.
 9. Nine months of a gig of brands. So,
 listeners, if you can imagine one side of our office, which is 11 feet long,
 AJ is using one of those whole walls to be a calendar.
 It's across the top.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 The top foot and a half is calendar and the rest of it will be just a dry erase board.
 And how do you make this magic happen?
 Well, you buy this special dry erase paint or yes, paint from this company called Whitey
 Board and I did it in our previous office and it's awesome.
 So it's basically a clear lacquer like yeah, invisible nail polish that you paint
 over the painted wall.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It's a protective coating on that allows you to use whiteboard markers
 -And you can just dry erase. -And if you didn't write on it,
 nobody would know it was there unless you write on it.
 -Except it's high gloss. -It's high gloss, yeah.
 -Right. -So...<br/>
 -So I measured, measured again, measured again,
 made sure I had the perfect calendar,<br/>
 and then used a level to draw it,<br/>
 and it took me about somewhere near 30 hours
 to draw it out with a Sharpie.<br/>
 This is dedication to calendar. This is a highly organized shape or speaking right here.
 Yes, well, I'm trying to set myself up to have less frustration going forward. So to me, it's worth it.
 So I drew it all out with a sharpie. It was perfection. And so I went in on Wednesday morning
 to paint the lacquer over top of it, just like I did the last time.
 So, women, just so worries with us, you have a freshly painted wall that has dried.
 Yes.<br/>
 Then you've spent 30 hours with a Sharpie, which is a permanent ink marker, drawing out
 a calendar-like grid structure on 11 feet of wall.
 Yes.<br/>
 And you're now going...<br/>
 11 feet by a foot and a half.<br/>
 And now you're going to paint a top coat of invisible whiteboard lacquer, which will allow
 the finished product to be able to see the Sharpie underneath, which will never erase
 when you kind of erase out and you can fill in date speakers or that sort of information.
 Yes.<br/>
 The end goal being you can just sit back, look at your wall and see a year at a time.
 Yes.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 So the paint has dried, the Sharpie has dried, you are good to go, tell us what happens.
 So I went in and I painted it and strangely as I started painting it, there was some black
 that was on the roller, which didn't happen last time.
 I thought, huh, it's lifting the Sharpie a little bit.
 But by the time I'd actually rolled over top of the calendar,
 I was watching Sharpie just slide down the wall.
 Like it made our office look like it has a Halloween wall.
 It's horrible.
</p><ul>
  <li>It was pretty scary.
 It was like black ooze.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Coming out of the wall and creepily sliding down
 like across between running mascara
 and the shower scene from Psycho.
 Well, I didn't see Psycho, but I'll take your word for it.
 All right. Well, we have photographic evidence
 because you posted it to Instagram.
 Yes, it was so...
 I almost bawled my eyes out.
 I just had to say to myself,
 this is like, you know,
 in terms of other horrific things happening in the world
 is not a big deal.
 Right.
 But I felt like a big deal because the amount of work
 I put into it.
 Right.
 So that was your first trauma?
 That was my first trauma.
 That was the morning.
 That was the morning.
 And then, so I was trying to recover from that all day.
 And all I'm thinking is, gosh, what did I do wrong?
 I did the same thing as last time.
 This is so hugely expensive and now it's ruined,
 that kind of thing.
  </li><li>But the day gets better.
  </li><li>We are worse, it gets worse.
  </li><li>Well, I was saying that out, it's funny.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Because I know the day doesn't get better.
  </li><li>So I show up at church,
 'cause I'm teaching the father heart,
 finding father, I should know the name of my own book.
 Unless you're nice.
 You're teaching medicine.
 Same day.
 Same day.
 And so I go by, I check on it.
 It's absolutely horrific.
 I'm just like, whatever.
 And then I go to get set up before speaking.
 And as I open up my computer, there is something wrong with my screen.
 And there wasn't something wrong with it yesterday when I was using it.
 But today on Wednesday, it- Your screen had shattered.
 It had shattered.
 And so I could only read the bottom two inches of my screen.
 But you know what?
 I'd rather have a bottom two inches of a Mac display than a full 15 inches of a PC display.
 It's like that verse, but it'd be a doorkeeper in the house of the Lord and dwell
 among the wicked.
 So there is that.
 Okay.
 That's not how you fell at that point.
 At the moment, I didn't.
 I felt like...
 Psalm 30 verse 5, 5, weeping me last through the night and you hadn't got the next part.
 That's right. I felt like bawling my eyes out in front of 40 people. I was like,
 "Oh, I'm going to go and get a coffee." So I just walked out and sweet Marcus Hendrickson
 set up everything for me. But I basically had to look at the slides coming up on the screen
 and then I could read some of the presenter notes on the bottom. It wasn't great.
 What was the great day?
 It was bad day.
 But in comparison to human trafficking.
 No, in comparison to human trafficking, it was a fantastic day.
 Right.
 And then what happened?
 Because sorrow does last tonight, but drug does come in the morning.
 What was your morning?
 In the morning, I went to babes with babes and I had a cronut.
 I was more using a metaphor.
 What was your morning in this solution to both the wall and the laptop?
 Thanks to the Corona digression.
 Well, I called the whiteyboard people and actually I live chatted them from the Apple
 store while I was trying to get my Apple fixed.
 I started chatting them from my iPad.
 Okay.
 I'm so proud of you.
 Thank you.
 I had all my devices out on the counter because I wanted them to see I was a loyal customer.
 And so...
 I've taught you well young Padawan.
 So I'm sitting there and it's asked you for your name.
 So of course I put an AJ and that guy comes back and he says, "You know, you're chatting
 with Austin Powers. And so I said, if I knew I was going to chat with Austin Powers, I
 would have given myself a better name. He said, well, I can refer to you as Dr. Evil
 if you prefer. I said I would prefer. So our whole chat was going back and forth. Dr.
 Evil and I kept calling referring it to him as Mr. Powers. Mr. Powers. I'd like to remind
 you that anyway. So by the end of it, he's like, could you have any pictures of what
 it turned out like?
 do I have pictures? I said, heck yeah, I have pictures. So I, he said, could you send them to
 Bruce? And I was like, is Bruce your middle name? Or anyway, I was just being sarcastic. But he said
 Bruce was their like paint guy, like the guy that does all of the places, if you hire them to come
 and do the place. Because he wasn't sure what had happened. So the end of this slightly long story,
 It wasn't my mistake.
 That's right.
 They sell two different types of products.
 They sell two different types of product.
 And they did not realize that their one part would run with Sharpie underneath it
 because they've just switched to a new manufacturer.
 And so he said, actually, I'd saved him from having done the same thing because he
 had no idea that you couldn't do it.
 And so they're shipping you a new product.
 They're shipping me a new product.
 It should come in tomorrow and I'm repainting the wall and redrawing the sharpie.
 But this time it'll be fast because you're doing all the hard work.
 No, but I threw out my stencil.
 OK, that's a bit short.
 I'm remeasure.
 OK, but version two dot of everything is always better.
 So that was the joy comes in the morning for the wall.
 What was the joy comes in the morning for your laptop?
 Um, it got covered.
 So we didn't have to pay to have it fixed.
 Agar fixed praise God apple and their incredible customer service.
 Thank you.
 What else happens this week?
 I don't know.
 And you had a fever for four hours.
 Yeah, four hours where he just lied on me like a limpet and watch
 door the Explorer or Diego.
 Of the other end of the extreme are nephew or brave little eight year old
 nephew had open heart surgery all over England.
 He had a whole valve, but in.
 Yeah, which is remarkable.
 You wanted to keep the old valve.
 They took out.
 And yep, he asked for it.
 So he's got it in a jar of vinegar somewhere.
 It's kind of gross.
 It's something to show the grandkids.
 And this is what came out of Grandpa's art.
 It's not grand like a skinny look at it.
 Anyway, so we're all excited that he's out of hospital.
 That's amazing.
 It is amazing.
 We've been working our way through our listening questions.
 We're going to write through a backlog.
 We have a question from Florida, sunny Florida.
 Oh, how I miss you, especially this time of year.
 This is from Erica, one of our former alumni, Erica.
 Your question is, I know you did a message about this, but since moving to Florida,
 I have had a hard time explaining to people that God doesn't have a problem
 with women in ministry.
 Could you please talk about that in your podcast?
 By the way, I love listening to your podcast.
 It's like visiting the school supernatural life every once in a while.
 First of all, great to hear from you.
 Erica, I hope you and John are doing really, really well.
 We love you, Erica.
 And we miss your smile.
 We're so excited that you're expecting.
 Boop, boop.
 Are they okay with us?
 And I'm from the world that they're expecting.
 It's all over Facebook.
 I mean, they're doing any, any minute.
 Okay.
 Then that's fine.
 That's a really, really good question.
 And it's a difficult one to answer quickly.
 It's actually very, very hard to help answer questions.
 The people aren't actually asking.
 So you mentioned in your, your question that basically you're
 trying to convince people of this. If people don't want to know an answer, you giving them
 an answer to a question they're not asking, isn't going to be helpful. However, if people
 are hungry for it, we can point it in the right direction, a couple of resources. I grew
 up in a church where women literally said nothing. Literally, from the moment the service
 started, no woman prayed, spoke, asked a question, let a service. When the service was
 over, women could speak. I since married a woman preacher, one who's actually a better
 preacher than I am.
  </li><li>Oh, thanks, baby.
  </li><li>That's true, not flat right.
 We're in a church where women are leaders
 and I help raise up women leaders
 and many of my team are women at Gray Center.
 And I love it and some of my heroes of the faith are women.
 Anyway, that doesn't help answer your question.
 There is a great book.
 And see, here's my dilemma.
 I don't really want to teach on our podcast.
 We teach everywhere else.
 I kind of want to just talk on our podcast.
 So to answer this properly, I need to teach.
 But you're in luck.
 I have taught on it.
 We did record it.
 I'll put it up on the blog.
 But a book that was really, really, really helpful for me
 working through some of the verses that at the first pass
 in the scripture seem to suggest that women should remain
 silent and that I don't permit women to teach men, et
 cetera, et cetera, those verses there.
 So fantastic book.
 It's called "Why Not Women?"
 And it's by Lauren Cunningham and a couple of other authors.
 I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
 And also, I think I taught this at Eminie.
 I think this is where the recording is.
 It may have been at Grace Center,
 but I'll post that on our website as well.
 If you look in the show notes,
 there'll be a link to that as well.
 And hopefully that will give you some more meat
 in case people in Florida ask you
 why you're in ministry and why you're doing things.
 I'd like to talk about honor this week.
  </li><li>Sounds good.
 Is there a particular place you'd like to start?
  </li><li>No, where would you like to start?
  </li><li>Well, I was thinking back in 2003,
 12 years ago. I was but a fresh faced 30 something. Was I 30? Was I even 30? Born in
 74, 2003. I was a 29 year old man.
 Baby, you did math in your head.
 Just like that.
 I would like to honor you for doing math in your head so quickly.
 Thank you. That feels like sarcasm.
 No. Okay. So 29 years old, I'd spent all the money I had earned to fly to Toronto, Canada
 to do the School of Ministry out there, a five-month school.
 And like anybody who's super hungry for God and has heard amazing things about
 school, and by the way, the School of Ministry in Toronto is absolutely fantastic.
 If you're thinking of doing a five-month school, a residential school,
 I could not endorse a better school than the School of Ministry up in Toronto.
 We love it. It's amazing. Anyway, I went there as a student.
 And like everybody else, we're looking for that breakthrough week, the week
 program, absolutely meet God and they give you a schedule at the
 beginning of the year of who's speaking on what and I'm so
 excited. I'm thinking, is it going to be in the father
 heart? Am I going to have a major revelation? Is it going to be
 on here and God's voice? Is it going to be on healing soul
 ties? Is it going to be on deliverance? Is it going to be
 the prophetic? Who knows? And so every week, you know, was
 brilliant. But I never felt I got that breakthrough I was
 looking for, you know, that life defining moment where it
 changed my life forever. And that hadn't happened. And so
 So there was a week on honor and I remember it, Peter and Heather Jackson were teaching
 on the school and I didn't understand a thing they were saying and I don't want to get
 ahead of myself.
 So I'm listening to their teaching and it's good but I was having a hard time following
 it and I wasn't quite sure what it was and I was like, "Oh yeah, this is great."
 And then Peter said, "Hey, we're going to do an activation."
 And I was like, "Ooh, activations."
 There's what we're going to do is we're going to get into small groups, your outreach teams,
 the teams are going to be going on outreach.
 what I'd like you to do is in your circles,
 I'd like you to honor one another.
 And I'm like, what does that mean?
 So he said, let me show you some really specific things.
 He said, what I want you to do is,
 I want you to position yourself to honor the person
 by doing three things.
 So I'm like, all right.
 He said, I want you to communicate to them
 with a loving tone of voice.
 It's like, okay.
 I want you to communicate to them with eye contact.
 So I don't want you or them to break eye contact
 while you're doing it.
 I'm like, okay, that's slightly more awkward.
 And then a third of all,
 I want you to communicate on her
 through loving affectionate touch.
 And I'm like this is getting a little bit weird.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Do I have to?
  </li><li>But basically they demonstrated it.
 So actually Heather honored one of the students.
 She pulled out one of the students
 and she got down on her knees
 and this student was sitting on a chair.
 Heather got down on her knees in front of the student
 held his hand, looked in his eyes and just honored him,
 just began to speak out over this young man,
 all the things that she saw in his life that were amazing.
 And she tuned to prophetic flow and just began to speak
 the father's heart and affection over this man.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>I thought this is amazing, and of course we're all crying.
 And so he turns to us and says,
 okay, now I want you to do the same thing.
 And I'm pumped because I've always been somebody
 who's keen to encourage.
 So I'm excited, I'm thinking about what I'm gonna encourage
 I want to, you know, everybody with, and the Holy Spirit says this to me.
 He says, you don't get to encourage anybody.
 And I was like, what?
 He was like, Alan, you are very, very good at giving honor to others.
 You are terrible at receiving honor.
 And I was like, what?
 And I thought that I want you to sit on your hands and I want you to let other
 people come and honor you first.
 You don't get to honor anybody today.
 And I was like, I don't like this.
 And so what I realized as one after another,
 my teammates came up, sat down in front of me on their knees,
 held my hand, looked in my eyes,
 and just began to speak all the things they saw in my life
 that they loved and felt honored and loved and safe by.
 I became absolutely undone.
 I think I actually had to run from the scene
 because I was so brokenhearted.
 I was just so overwhelmed by it.
 And the Lord just started revealing this whole core of shame in me because you need a foundation to receive honor.
 And I realized that I had always been somebody who deflected, you know, honor and praise for, I don't know what reason for.
 I don't know whether it felt like flatry.
 I don't know whether it felt wrong, but that week on the school absolutely changed my approach to interacting with people.
 Talk to me about your revelation of honor, where it came from, how you got it.
 I would say that my revelation of honor probably mostly comes from you,
 from you, both being good at honoring others and valuing honor.
 So I would say it's a borrowed revelation that I'm still working on.
 Hmm.
 I wasn't expecting that answer.
 You know, Bethel, church in Reading California,
 have done a wonderful job at putting legs
 to the whole topic of honor.
 Mm-hmm.
 Bill Johnson says that to honor someone
 is to celebrate who they are without stumbling over
 who they're not.
 Yeah, it's a great statement.
 And I think probably in our culture,
 when I say culture, I mean our Western culture,
 we probably see honor demonstrated of funerals.
 Yeah.
 So you gather around and at a funeral,
 you really minimize and don't talk about the bad
 that the person did.
 But you talk about the impact that that person had
 on your life.
 And sometimes the impact that they had on your life
 was very, very small in some ways.
 The story might seem insignificant,
 but it was huge to you.
 And the tragedy in our culture is that most people
 receive honor only when they're dead.
 Very true.
 And so one of the things I've had in my heart
 is to actually put honor into practice
 so that you can impact people while they're alive.
 And so I find great joy in finding people who've impacted me
 and either writing them or sending them a gift
 or just communicating to them as intentless as I can,
 how they have impacted my life and what they've done for me.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you're seriously, you're amazing at it.
 You have a gift of being able to not only honor people
 well, but help them receive it.
 Do you know why I think that is?
 Why?
 I think I have consistently sat under the weight of God's honor of me.
 I feel like for a long part of my walk with God, God sat on me.
 I mean, literally, he pinned me down almost and wouldn't let me squirm away without me
 receiving a revelation that he honors me and delights in me.
 And that's, you know, salvation, all of salvation is rooted in honor. While we're still sinners,
 Christ died for us. Like God's love and God's affection and God's value on our lives is
 so great that he exchanged his life for our life. I mean, that's astonishing honor. He
 He looked at our lives and just said, "I want them in my family.
 There's something of worth, there's something of value in them."
 And he saw the diamonds in the midst of the dirt of our lives.
 He saw something in our lives and decided to rescue us.
 I mean, that's astonishing honor.
 And I think, and I don't mean to be controversial here, that salvation is the ground floor of
 the honor that God has for us.
 I think too often we get saved and that's it.
 And I don't mean to say that being saved is something minimal.
 I mean, my gosh, if all, if all, I'm in the sense of ridiculous,
 but if the sum total of Jesus' death and resurrection on the cross
 was to forgive our sins, he's worthy of praise forever and ever and ever.
 However, honor takes us up a level.
 It moves us from sinners saved by grace into saints who are co-heirs with Christ.
 A lot of Christians never get that part of the revelation.
 So we spend most of our lives, I certainly did until 2003,
 thinking that we're just sinners saved by grace.
 And, you know, but for the grace of God, they're Gohai.
 And not realizing there's a whole royal identity to step into where we are
 literally sons and daughters of the king.
 Right.
 And to think like that requires a paradigm shift.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so when I talk about God sitting on me,
 it was him sitting on me and saying,
 "I can't go any further with you into your destiny
 "until you understand who you are and what you're like
 "and what it is I love about you
 "because until you understand the value I've put inside of you,
 "you will never be able to give it away."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So that old adage of you cannot give what you do not have
 means you first have to receive honor before you can give honor.
 Which I think is why I love our culture because we have such a great culture of
 honor where we're allowed to be ourselves and be valued for who we are.
 I suppose I'm, I'm then having difficulty separating the difference
 between the love of God and God honoring you.
 I mean, they're one in the same.
 God's love, you know, was rooted in honor.
 You were made for love.
 It's amazing that we're made in his image.
 And so God
 that in itself is an honor.
 It's a very God of honor.
 So therefore we have honor within us.
 But if you think about going back to creation,
 God creates Adam and Eve and he gives away everything he's made to them.
 I mean, what an astonishing honor.
 We went to the Biltmore state last week.
 Can you imagine going to the built more state and meeting one of their surviving members of the built more state and they were just like,
 Oh, Alan, Adrian, we're so glad that you're here.
 We want to give you the built more state.
 You guys are now the ownership of it and you guys get to run it.
 And good luck with that.
 I mean, that would be astonishing or like, why us instead of anybody else?
 And I mean, it would just blow our minds, but God creates a whole earth, hands it over to them.
 And basically says, Hey, be fruitful and multiply.
 He honors them and he trusts them.
 And you see the fruit of that.
 incredible. And the enemy comes along and robs it and he robs it with shame, which is the antithesis
 of honor. So most of us live from a shame-based identity, even though we're saved. We still live
 with this view that, well, you know, I guess God has to love us and you know, he's got to be faithful
 to his name rather than having a revelation that no, he really does love us because of something
 He didn't get stuck with you.
 Yeah, that's right.
 There's intrinsic value in all of us.
 There's never been a moment we haven't been perfectly loved.
 And that's, you know, that's that honor displayed to us.
 It's astonishing, isn't it?
 It's amazing.
 That means everyone we meet,
 because they're made in the image of God is worthy of honor.
 Right.
 Without us knowing who they are and what they're like.
 So that means the prophetic gets to look in the lives of people.
 And as Chris Valtan loves to say is find the gold in the midst of the dirt of people's lives.
 So this is who you are.
 This is who you're created to be.
 And call the map in honor.
 I think that's my favorite thing about the prophetic.
 You know, who does that really, really well?
 Who?
 Gary Morgan, David Wagner.
 Yeah, they both do.
 They're both prophets who are really, really good at not just calling out destiny,
 but just looking for the thing that's for the redemption and for the honor.
 Yeah.
 Do you have any favorite honor stories?
 I guess they would all involve you.
 I guess I attribute when you show me that you know me and that you've paid
 attention to details, I attribute that, like I attribute that to honor.
 Does that make sense?
 No, give me an example.
 Well, like when we got engaged and the lengths that you went to to like have all my favorite
 verses and my favorite coffee and my favorite meal and all that kind of stuff like just to me,
 I felt honored for the person that I was just in little things that don't even matter but they
 mattered enough that you noticed them. Does that make sense? And I suppose really like even last
 week when we went to the built more, I said this already, but I felt maybe more honored
 by God. I mean, God knew I wanted to go to the built more because I told him a couple
 of years before, you know, and even in that, I was like, wow, God, like, you care about
 really on one level, the dumb stuff, you know, the stuff that's like, that shouldn't be important,
 but you so honor our hearts desires and you that it's important enough for you to talk down about it.
 Wow.
 Tell you another story.
 Yeah.
 I remember being on school in Toronto and it was I think it was a Thursday.
 Father or two or a Thursday, not that matters, but you're influencing me to tell you unnecessary details.
 Wait, I'm becoming a woman.
 Oh dear.
 And you know at that time I was leading one of the domestic teams and it was our day to prep dinner so I'm in the kitchen and I'm wondering where the rest of my team is and all of a sudden one of my team running said hey you need in the main hall and so.
 Here I am and not scrubs but you know what an apron on and you know I'm ticked at nobody I showed up on time and so I got in the main.
 the main room and there's all the guy from the school just kind of milling around wondering what's going on and nobody has a clue nobody.
 Really sure why were there why we've been summoned and all of a sudden these doors open.
 And all the girls on the school are dressed immaculately they're all in you know either black skirts or black pants and white shirts and they're done their hair and they've done their makeup and they look just absolutely astonishingly beautiful.
 and they've all been allocated a male student to find and a score into the room next door.
 And so when we walk into the room next door, being led by one of the girls, one of the female
 students, they've laid out a red carpet for us and to our surprise, when we walk in, they've
 transformed this room into a banquet hall, it's a round banquet hall, a banquet table, a big
 apartment and there is right before us, individual tables, all with our names on them. And when we
 sit down, there's a prophetic word and an honoring card about who we are and what this
 person has seen in us and what they love. And they spend the evening lavishing us with
 just honor and with caring, like serving us amazing food that they had prepared and then
 giving us gifts that they had prepared. And I remember all of the guys just being undone,
 some initially just joking, "Oh, well, this is awesome, this is the way it should be,"
 uncomfortable with honor. But I remember the guy next to me just weeping all the way through
 the meal, just undone, just sobbing. And he could not get it together. And he said, and
 he turned to me, said, Alan, you don't understand. He said, I have treated women horribly all of my
 life. Like, I don't deserve this. Like, I am a horrible person when I, this is undoing me. And I
 think I think honor is this astonishing ability to bypass reason and just hit the heart.
 Which is why in Romans it says for God's kindness leads us to repentance. One of the amazing things
 about God is his insistence on showing kindness to quote unquote the wicked.
 He is insistent on wearying us with his kindness and with his love.
 This is what happened to this man's plan to ask, we're just kind of sobbing. So they service
 just three course meal and there's chocolates.
 And the whole point at the end,
 they just get up and they just said,
 "Hey, we just wanna honor you for being godly man."
 Well, we literally didn't have an emotional bucket
 to put that experience in.
 As guys, we did not know what to do with that.
 But stuff like that just, you know, and does you.
 You know, you've done this twice for me
 on my 30th birthday and my 40th birthday, unbeknownst to me.
 I'm a high words of affirmation person,
 but you, without my knowing, went behind my back
 and emailed a bunch of friends and family
 and all around the world and asked them,
 would you write a paragraph about some way
 that Allen has impacted your life
 and then claded them in a book and gave them to me?
 And they're probably two of my most treasured possessions,
 just a record of these things.
 And it's amazing that I have this record
 of how I've impacted people's lives before I'm dead.
 And I think that's what motivated me is like,
 I actually wanna tell the people
 who've impacted my life.
 Hey, you've impacted my life.
 Like, hey, I was really touched by this.
 Hey, I was really moved by this.
 Hey, you're a great person because of this, that,
 and the next thing.
 And it's amazing the reactions that people have.
 Some people don't have an emotional bucket to put that in.
 They either think it's flattery,
 or they're so filled with shame
 that they can't hold the weight of that.
 And that's tragic because in Isaiah 61,
 the prophecy speaking about Jesus said that instead
 of your shame, you'd be given a double portion of honor.
 So whether we like it or not, our inheritance
 is a double portion of honor.
 And it would be tragic that we don't get to experience that
 on earth because we didn't have a bucket to put it in.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>On that particular cliffhanger, I think we'll end it there.
 If we have wedded your appetite
 for more information about honor,
 If what I'm talking to you is completely alien and foreign and you're like, man,
 I want to hear more teaching and revelation about honor.

 Speaking of life changing things, our school supernatural life,

 It would be our absolute pleasure to introduce you to the Father,
 to introduce you to this culture and to walk with you for eight months.
 And we have amazing teachers from all over the world who come and teach on the school.
 It's so much fun.
 It is.
 I love watching people change, like, just get to the end of eight months.
 And it looks like other than, you know, I was going to say other than they still
 look exactly the same, but actually some of them really don't look exactly the same
 at all, but that they look, you know, they're just different people.
 It's amazing.
 It is amazing.
 Any closing thoughts?
 My current closing thought is why on earth is our son awake at 844 in the evening.
 I couldn't find milk this afternoon, but there was an old can of coca-cola and I gave him that.
 Oh Mr Jones.
 Until next week with our new fancy jingle you guys have an amazing week.
 We love you. Thanks for tuning in. Bye bye.
