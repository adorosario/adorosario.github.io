<p> Good evening, Moltzure Sexy Pants.<br/>
 Baby, can you use your code names on air?
 OK, I'm so sorry.<br/>
 Bolger.<br/>
 How are you, fluffy bunny?<br/>
 I'm good, thank you.<br/>
 You are wrapped head towing a blanket.
 Are you freezing cold?<br/>
 I'm a little cold.<br/>
 I'm a little cold, but also Cindy dropped off a little present for me, which was
 this nice fuzzy blanket.<br/>
 So I just wanted to use it.<br/>
 Oh, my gosh, you're so ridiculous.<br/>
 Well, it's ridiculous to cute.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 That sounded bad.<br/>
 What was supposed to be this week was a little rough.
 Obviously we had bands, funeral, and then this week were kind of in the days.
 Yeah.<br/>
 That's what it felt like to me.<br/>
 It's a weird week.<br/>
 And then not speaking at the school got me out of routine.
 So I just kind of bounced around this week thinking, where am I?
 What am I doing?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then I make it.<br/>
 I'm an lover.<br/>
 That did happen.<br/>
 I told you, though, I'm an eight got canceled.
 because of weather because of severe weather, severe weather.
 Yeah. But it didn't turn out to be. Well, I suppose it did.
 Didn't it? There's lots of rain and lots of light.
 People would have been caught in the rain either coming or going.
 And that would not have been pretty at all. Yeah.
 It was a busy week for dates. It was. It was a date
 tackless week.<br/>
 Have you been drinking? No.<br/>
 Yes, we were at three times this week, or I was at three times this week.
 Day terrific.<br/>
 You were right.<br/>
 Was you?<br/>
 You were.<br/>
 We only had two dates just because you had a mandate with Danny does not mean that we had three days.
 Just keeping the bromance alive.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 Well, yes, I took you on a date.<br/>
 And your favorite little author, Danielle Walker, was in town.
 I don't even remember how I found out she was in town, but I found out a couple of weeks ago.
 And so just put tickets to us here.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 Which is just super exciting. We did drive in horrendous.
 Tarantula downpour to get there, but I mean, you can't really control the weather.
 No, it was nice. And then you put your photograph taken with her and yeah,
 you Instagram, Tarda, and she Instagram you. It's true.
 So you're now like Instagram friends.<br/>
 Um, yeah, I don't think so. I mean, you know, I don't think she's following me or anything.
 And then we went for some far, some Vietnamese food.
 We did because we miss our foamy 99.<br/>
 Yeah, even though it's pronounced "Farmy 99".
 Well, we have our whole lives pronounced "Fomy 99".
 We have.<br/>
 And I shall continue to see it that way.
 Right.<br/>
 But we anyway, the point was we went for Vietnamese food and it wasn't that great.
 It really wasn't.<br/>
 It was.<br/>
 But still, it was nice to be out.<br/>
 It was.<br/>
 With no kids.<br/>
 It was.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And the tea was good.<br/>
 It was great jasmine tea.<br/>
 It was very good jasmine tea.<br/>
 I just probably wouldn't eat any of the food.
 I would just have the tea.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Which I would drive that far for tea.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So never mind.<br/>
 I'm glad to spend so much time on that and then we have to catch up with Jeff and Becky
 there back from Romania.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 They look like had amazing time.<br/>
 You know it's bad when you out last Jeff and Becky.
 Yes, because typically they're ready for you to stay at their house until midnight.
 They're still talking and let's do this, but they've faded pretty quick.
 I'm going to say this.<br/>
 Thanks to the powers of jet lag.<br/>
 Poor honeys.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 Yes, they were exhausted.<br/>
 I've been spending the last two days trying to repair our screen in porch.
 You have, darling.<br/>
 I had this revelation that I am not naturally gifted at work that requires skilled manual
 labor.<br/>
 I don't necessarily think that that's true.
 I think it's that you can't move at the speed you would like to or that you're used to
 moving at when you do other things that you're very good at.
 Because I'm not naturally gifted in this area.
 But you're still doing a great job.<br/>
 You're very, very kind.<br/>
 I don't feel like I'm doing a great job.
 I feel like I'm doing a very slow, arduous, frustrating task that seems a little beyond
 my capabilities.<br/>
 I have great confidence.<br/>
 It's going to be fine.<br/>
 Well, Josh came over yesterday and helped and I was amazed at how two pairs of hands dramatically
 increased our productivity.<br/>
 But yes, I will put you to work tomorrow.
 If you grew an extra set of arms, you would do it faster.
 Yes, but there would be some interesting side effects.
 It really would be children would be scared.
 No doubt.<br/>
 Speaking of which, our children were completely adorable this week.
 They are.<br/>
 As opposed to every other week when they're just.
 But there was some just highlight moments was the thing in the series.
 Yes, I put this on Facebook, but we were having dinner and family dinner and I was asking
 the girls how school was, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
 And Tia, our five year old, she said, "Daddy, it's Fat Jenny's birthday on Friday."
 I just asked Fat my food.<br/>
 I was like, "I beg a pardon to you."<br/>
 She's like, it's fat Jenny's birthday on Friday.
 I was like, it's not nice to call somebody fat.
 And she's like, yeah, but she's really fat.
 And I'm like, yeah, but even if they're fat,
 it's not nice to call people fat.<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
 Well, how are you gonna know<br/>
 if I'm talking about fat Jenny or mean Jenny?
 (laughing)<br/>
 I was like, oh, you are adorable.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, I was everything we could do not.
 Just joke on our food or just start out like that thing.
  </li><li>Oh my God. - So funny.
 Then we were driving in the car during the week as well.
 And T has been learning all about apples.
 And so she's like, "Mommy, did you know that an apple
 is just like the earth?"
 And I was like, "What?"
 And she said, "They're exactly the same.
 They're just like the earth."
 And I said, "Well, explain that."
 She said, "Well, apple has a skin and the earth has a crust."
 And then there's like some other stuff in the middle
 or some other stuff in between.
 And then there's a core and they both have a core.
 And I said, "Well, what's the other stuff in between?"
 He goes, "I don't know, Mommy, I'm only five."
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It sounds like she learns like I learn.
 Here's something that's interesting to me in the rest,
 I just tuned out.
  </li><li>It was adorable.
  </li><li>Okay, this week.
  </li><li>And then there was MJ's been so cute.
  </li><li>Oh, he has.
  </li><li>Oh, he's so cuddly and sweet, and he just wants daddy.
  </li><li>Yeah, and he's learned some cuss words.
 And you know what?
 (laughing)
 I'm joking, I joke, I jest.
  </li><li>But I took a couple of times that I've taken him out
 and Allen's at home doing the fencing in,
 when you've been at home doing the screened in porch
 or whatever, and the whole time he just talks about you.
 Da-da, ball, da-da, out, da-da.
  </li><li>It's his target, he just wants to be outside with me.
  </li><li>He does.
  </li><li>So he kicks a ball around.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I try and avoid him running into me
 while I'm on a ladder with power tools.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So far so good, but he trips to accident.
  </li><li>But it's been so cute when you're down low
 and you're doing the bottom bits of the screened in porch
 and he can actually get to you.
 it over and leans up against you or steals a cuddle.
 -Which is absolutely adorable.
 -So cute.
 -Yeah, it's very cute.
 -Yeah.
 -Our topic for discussion this week,
 a little bit behind the scenes,
 normally when we do these podcasts,
 it could be fair to say,
 "I usually nominate suggestions or nominate topics rather."
 And you're like, "Yes, let's do that."
 But this week, you nominated the topic.
 -I did.
 -You were very excited to talk about your favorite thing.
 -Yes.
 -Which is?
 -Other than Jesus, it's food.
 -Okay.
 -[laughs]
 It is it's food we're going to talk about food because that's face facts we talk about food even when we're not talking about food that's true so might as well just spend a time talking about food and you even have a favorite verse I do x10 verse 13 yes.
 What is the barbecue verse get up kill and eat.
 If you're on swans by the bible it is a.
 for sure. Food, of course, is very important because if you don't eat it, you die, as Tia
 will tell me often. Yes. Yes. But how did you get into food? Because you are into food.
 I curse for a glance at your Instagram feed. I'm very into food. Would suggest you're into
 food? Yes, I might be a foodie. And I am a very blessed beneficiary of your interest
 in food. Eater of the foodie. But where did it begin? It began. Well, both my parents
 were really good cooks. Both of them did gourmet cooking courses and that kind of stuff.
 And so growing up I never had whatever fish, dicks and chicken nuggets and stuff like that.
 We had real food. So we'd have, you know, I don't know, roasts and stuff, chicken breasts
 and, you know, chicken quarter on blue and that kind of stuff.
 Sorry, chicken quarter on what?
 Beer.
 Thank you. It amazes me that you've lived in Canada for the vast majority of your life
 and yet you don't speak a lick of French.
 I do speak a lick of French.
 You do?
 Yes.
 You have a great poem.
 French, should we?
 No, thank you.
 For what?
 Listen, the French language is a confusing language.
 It is a beautiful language.
 It is beautiful to listen to, but it is a confusing language because you have to know
 which sex and animate objects are.
 Right.
 To me, that makes no sense.
 There are millions of children to speak French.
 So if a child can learn to speak French surely.
 Yes, but those children are like happy to me because they look confused as well.
 Forgive all.
 OK, we'll just.
 We'll go over that racial slur.
 All right.
 So your parents taught you to cook, but not speak French.
 Yes.
 Um, as neither of my parents actually speak French either, but that's probably not what we're talking.
 No.
 Yeah.
 So, but they didn't really teach me a cook.
 They just cooked well.
 They didn't ever really taught us.
 So that was your norm to eat good quality food.
 Yep.
 And then when I live with my dad for a while, he started teaching me how to cook
 because he realized I could cook absolutely nothing.
 And.
 For me, think of that time in your life when you couldn't cook anything.
 I know.
 And then my first roommate after dad died was my friend Laura and her parents were Italian.
 She cooked everything from scratch, made her own young key, made her own whatever.
 And she sort of took me under her wing and decided I needed to learn how to cook something.
 Right.
 And so she got me interested in how fun it could be.
 My dad, my dad had a lot of fun cooking too.
 He used to sing while he cooked.
 Um, but I started thinking, Oh, actually I quite enjoy this.
 And I think I might even be good at it.
 Like I could smell things and figure out if they could be good together, right?
 Without actually putting it in, in, messing something up.
 You were like that, right?
 And rats or two.
 Yes.
 Just like the rat in a
 Thanks, starting.
 Yes.
 Go on.
 and go on. So yeah, so I was eating those kinds of food, but then I started really enjoying
 ethnic food. And so when I started getting a bit more confidence, I started trying to
 cook more ethnic foods, which is probably more of the kind of stuff I cook now.
 Right. Yeah, it is. So love Thai food, love Indian food, all that kind of stuff. What
  </li><li>That's right, you made me.
  </li><li>I have never really needed to cook.
 I do enjoy cooking.
  </li><li>You're actually quite good at cooking, Dara.
  </li><li>Thank you, do you remember the first meal I ever cooked?
  </li><li>I do, you made me a lemon chicken and a couscous.
  </li><li>And a couscous, I just--
  </li><li>Well, I can't remember the kind of couscous it was.
 It was some sort of a--
  </li><li>It was apricot.
  </li><li>Peach, oh, okay, apricot.
  </li><li>And apricot, couscous, with yeah, with a chicken breast.
 Anyway, I, you know, I quite enjoy,
 I think I more enjoy the hosting side of it.
 Like, I think we both enjoy having people over for dinner.
  </li><li>Yeah, we love it.
 I enjoy cooking, I enjoy cooking meat and the grill and preparing stuff.
 I think I like the creative end of making the food and you like the creative end of
 making everything beautiful.
 Yeah.
 But I didn't really need to learn a cook.
 I mean, I guess I did because I was unmarried for a long time and so cooked for myself,
 but it was more rudimentary and very elementary.
 It's like, "Oh, I need carbohydrates and proteins and so I will cook these."
 It just fulfilled a function rather than you seem to derive an enormous amount of pleasure
 from researching, from thinking about recipes, from actually preparing the food, creating
 the food, and then eating the food.
 I come in at the end and eat the food and think, "My gosh, that was absolutely amazing."
 I would say it's my main creative outlet.
 Right.
 So yeah, I love it.
 I also love eating something somewhere and figuring out what's in it and then recreating
 at home and switching it up to what I would want.
 But do you know what I mean?
 I love all that kind of stuff.
 We've been very fortunate to eat in places all over the world.
 Not only about some of your favorite food from around the world.
 Love sushi. Still love sushi.
 But there's no truth that when you went to Japan,
 you couldn't eat any because you were pregnant.
 No, I ate sushi even though I was pregnant.
 Oh, you did? I don't remember that part.
 Sorry. I just remember being in that sushi restaurant
 and a lot of it going past you and you can eat it.
 Well, some of it, if I wasn't sure if it was potentially high mercury or something, I didn't need it.
 But I did still eat sushi.
 I was six months pregnant at that point.
 I wasn't being sick anymore.
 With all three kids, I ate sushi.
 I think I mean, I don't think the Japanese people stop eating sushi when they're pregnant.
 No, can you imagine?
 No.
 Anyway, I never ate sushi.
 In fact, our very first pre date date was a sushi restaurant.
 It was.
 You did very well.
 And I've never been before.
 you know, and you have all this fear of like, oh, gosh, you're gonna be in raw fish.
 And the concept sounded so alien and foreign.
 Then of course, we went to an authentic sushi restaurant where they spoke virtually no English.
 And I didn't have a clue what I was doing.
 You had to talk to me through it and I wasn't quite sure what we're doing.
 I think I just ordered your food.
 Yeah, you did.
 And I completely agree.
 Sushi is absolutely delicious.
 It's delicious.
 As long as you have good sushi, you can't have, you know, gas stations sushi.
 Yeah, or like Kroger Sushi or you know what I mean?
 Like just if that is not good sushi,
 that's like having cardboard pizza.
 I mean, yeah, that's like having a McDonald's burger
 and saying that you made yourself a cheeseburger.
 Yeah, or, you know, or saying,
 oh, I don't like cheeseburgers because I had McDonald's
 when you were like, yeah, but have you had burger up?
 Good point, well played.
 Thank you.
 Okay, so you love sushi, what else?
 From around the world?
 Oh, from around the world.
 I love obviously I love Thai food.
 Um, I love Indian food.
 I pretty much like ethnic food.
 Yeah.
 I've never met a food group I don't like.
 That's my tummy will be honest.
 I have Ethiopian food.
 I can't stand it.
 It's just disgusting food.
 I'm so sorry.
 So we really need the French and Ethiopians.
 I'm sorry, Jenny.
 My, one of my really good friends, Jenny, grew up in Ethiopia.
 And every single one of her birthdays, we'd have to go this authentic Ethiopian
 restaurant for food and you eat everything with your fingers, except that they have these
 like, what look like soggy washcloths, but they say is bread and it smells like a dirty
 nappy and you can pick up your food with that instead if you want and then eat this nasty
 spongy stuff.
 What do you really think about that?
 Oh, it's horrible.
 And like every year I go, I love you, so I'll go and then I just sit there and be like,
 "This is so gross, but she loved it."
 Okay, give me your top three meals you've ever eaten.
 That I love like the most.
 Well, then, top three dining experiences of your life.
 Oh, hard.
 Okay.
 There is a place that my dad and mom used to go on really, really
 super special occasions called the Octagon, which is in Toronto,
 North end of the city.
 And my dad took me there and usually we'd have lobster or you'd have surf and
 turf, but it was just so good.
 And you'd have like lobster, Thermador and really, really good stuff.
 Oh, that's one one.
 Um, on our honeymoon, when we went to, um,
 the one place that was like, you're supposed to wear a shirt and tie, but they let us in anyway.
 That was like the five star Floridian something.
 Oh, the restaurant like grand Floridian Lodge in the world.
 And they let us in and that was, I just remember thinking, oh, so fantastic.
 Number three, what would number three be?
 Mm. Quite possibly eating in Iceland.
 That the salmon or the lamb like any of the--
 Or anything in Iceland.
 Anything in Iceland.
 I remember being in Norway, for example,
 and commenting on how delicious the water was,
 which I know that sounds absurd.
 Right? I know.
 But like just the regular tap water.
 I know that sounds ridiculous to say,
 how good water tastes so good.
 But I remember being there with a friend
 friends said, "Oh, you haven't tasted anything with you, you're the Iceland."
 And so when I went to Iceland and drank their water.
 Fantastic.
 So if you start with the baseline thing you need for cooking, water, it is so much better
 in Iceland than anywhere else on the planet that I've had water.
 So then they're salmon and then they're lamb.
 So like a lot of the food we would eat, and I don't mean this in any way to be disrespectful
 or insulting at all, would be what I would call fairly traditional plain meals.
 So you might have some lamb and some potatoes and some vegetables, maybe some carrots and
 like that.
 That in and of itself doesn't sound particularly flash, particularly flavorful, but my gosh,
 the actual ingredients, unlike anything I've ever tasted.
 Right.
 Best lamb carrots and potatoes you've ever had.
 Unbelievable.
 I remember Baldur going fishing, catching some salmon, gutting it in the sink, chopping
 it up and then we ate it.
 Oh, and it was fantastic.
 gosh, I believe so much so that when our friends from Iceland are here in North America,
 they will not order salmon.
 Well, they want to order fish at all.
 No, no fish.
 Because it's just like, what's the point?
 They don't drink the water.
 They can't even have the soda because it's made with water that is.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 So that's your three.
 Yeah.
 What are your three?
 What was the place we went to last year for our honeymoon, the steak place up in Nashville?
 Oh, um, cane prime.
 I was going to say Kanye West.
 That's the person is that's the person is we never a county of us that's right.
 Cain prime.
 Cain prime is a steakhouse in Nashville.
 Yes, it's possible the most expensive meal I've ever paid for expensive.
 But it was so good.
 I yes, yummy.
 Everything was absolutely amazing.
 The steak was like cutting butter.
 Yeah.
 Um, we've had so many good meals.
 with Gary and Sarah Morgan. We have.
 You know, around the world in different places. And I'm not sure if that, I mean,
 to be sure the food was amazing, but obviously the company makes things absolutely incredible.
 And then I'm trying to think of a third meal that we've had. I'm scratching my head here that,
 I mean, here's the thing, we've had so many good meals, but...
 I don't know. We have had a lot of good meals.
 Yeah, I don't want to be definitive. I'm holding down two and my third one's yet to be determined.
 Okay.
 I'll in future episodes I'll tell you.
 I'll let you know.
 Because I ponder it.
 Yeah.
 As we come into fall, tell me what your go-to comfort foods are.
 Well, my go-to comfort foods probably soups. I made a great soup today.
 You did?
 I kind of a garbered up a soup. I think that's what I like. One of the things I like
 best about cooking is the trouble with soups is it can feel like you're drinking rather than
 eating. Why? You used a spoon. Right, but it's off fluid. Well, it was a really thick soup.
 Don't argue. I'm just telling you, this is like drinking. I want something to chew
 before I have to swallow. I'll try and keep that in mind. Thanks. I'll idle things.
 blender a cow and say there was a meal. All right, so soups.
 What else?
 Soups. I don't know because I because now that we're like
 completely grain free like last year I was doing a lot of
 quinoa and stuff like that and everyone's in a while I do
 risotto so probably still be cooking all that stuff for the
 kids but I've got one for you. What? Your sweet potato
 fries. Oh yes, they are yummy. Mm hmm. I could probably eat
 those every day quite happily. I suggest that we finish this
 podcast that you got on stage, maybe some sweet potato fries.
 Oh, do you?
 Just so nice.
 I suggest you get the idea out of your head because I want to
 bet.
 You think that's a brilliant idea?
 Okay.
 Me and the Holy Spirit agree.
 Well, good.
 He can show you how to make them.
 My probably go-to comfort foods got to be chocolate.
 Yes.
 The kids brought home Hershey's this week from school.
 Hershey's a revolting.
 It is.
 It's from the culinary pits of hell.
 It's absolutely horrendous.
 Yes.
 And so Abby was all excited.
 Hey, daddy, I got a Hershey's chocolate bar.
 And I said, honey, I'm going to tell you straight.
 It is the most disgusting thing you could possibly eat.
 And she was like, really?
 I was like, yeah, honey, I'm fine for you to have chocolate,
 but please let me go buy you some decent chocolate.
 You're just like, well, can I try it?
 I was like, sure, this will be like smoking cigarettes.
 I'm going to make you a bar of Hershey's
 and then you will never, ever touch it again in your life.
 Didn't your dad do that with you?
 Like, or fed you cigarettes?
 So you'd never, okay, it's a great parenting move.
 I can't wait to try it with my kids.
 But anyway, yeah, find some good chocolate.
 Did you do that then?
 Did you let her have the Hershey's?
 No, she just said I don't want it.
 Oh, I was like good girl.
 You just listen to your father in the ways of wisdom.
 Right.
 So we'll go get her some lint or some imported chocolate for sure.
 Um, closing thoughts.
 Well, we didn't, we didn't talk about any of our disgusting foods from around the world.
 Who wants to hear about disgusting foods?
 Well, some people may not realize that these interesting food groups exist like sheep face.
 Sheep face in Iceland.
 Yep.
 The century egg in Singapore, it's an egg that's been soaked in horseradish,
 you're into a little bit of black.
 Casting, yes.
 Then one time we were in Japan and our dear friend took us out for dinner and he,
 of course, ordered for us because we didn't understand anything on the menu,
 given that we don't read Japanese.
 And he struggled to interpret what it was we were eating.
 So he pulled out with a little and I asked what he was ordering because I was still had a queasy
 stomach because I was pregnant with Abby at the time.
 So I was trying to say, hey, we need real plain stuff like chicken or steak or whatever.
 So he pulls out his little, you know,
 digits or Japanese to English dictionary and, you know, looks up and then shows me it.
 And the dictionary definition is the best part of the cow's thorax.
 And I was like, I'm glad I sent the worst part of the house.
 what I'd like to pass on eating that cow's thorax at all.
 Then there was pig bladder.
 Best part of the pig bladder.
 And then there was some sort of sex organ.
 And these were what he was going to order.
 That was the plan.
 That is what he ordered.
 I was just like, ah.
 We asked for a steak, didn't we?
 Yeah.
 Like, um, so.
 Sorry to be so western, but.
 Yes.
 He was very gracious.
 Yeah, he was very, very gracious.
 Yeah.
 We've eaten some pretty strange things.
 Well, no, we haven't. I refuse to eat any of those things.
 We've been offered some fairly strange things.
 That's much better.
 Yes.
 Yeah, I wouldn't eat lamb face, but our friends.
 Sheep face.
 Sheep's face.
 I don't know if there's a difference, but they called it sheep face.
 You had to scrape it off the face of the sheep with your teeth.
 It was basically like they just removed the skin.
 And there it is, just the meat and the eyeball staring at you.
 Are we glad we continue to spread a conversation?
 So gross.
 But they loved it.
 We did not try it, however.
 This week we haven't had a declares conference coming up.
 We do.
 This is going to be a great week.
 I'm so excited about it.
 We teach on sex for the first two days at school.
 Whoo, whoop.
 Well, it's not that we teach on sex.
 We teach on sexual purity.
 Yes.
 But in the process of teaching on sexual purity, we talk about sex and sexuality.
 So that's fun.
 I love our students.
 I love getting to be with them.
 And very good.
 And then Wednesday and 30 just take care of themselves.
 We're meetings and boom, we're in a Friday and it's conference.
 It is.
 I'm so excited.
 It's true.
 Personal colonies lead in worship.
 Awesome.
 Along with Jesse early. That's right. It's like just Christmas every time. Yeah, it's really good. And yeah, I'm super excited about it's going to be awesome CRT.
 Who will have, I think I'm seeing from some trying to work out ways to mock him mercilessly.
 That would be funny. But you know that if you do that, he'll just as soon as he's got the microphone, your toast. He is very quick with it.
 with it. My only hope is that Louise will take my side, otherwise I'm doing.
 Yes. Well, listen, you beautiful people. Thank you for tuning in and listening. We hope you have an amazing week. Yeah, we hope
 we have an amazing week. I don't know what your dream life has been like this week, but my dream life was off the charts.
 Yeah, crazy. We do. Yeah, we had the same dreams. Well, well, we
 the same people appearing in our dreams. Yeah. So anyway, I want to pray for everybody who's
 listening father. I ask that you would just pour out your Holy Spirit on everybody who's listening
 to this, that they would have incredible dreams this week, Lord, that you would begin to fill
 people's hearts with hope and with excitement about the future and about the destiny that they
 have. And I thank you for the gift of food. And as we're eating food this week, Lord, would we
 Stop and when we think about you, the giver of all good things, we love you.
 You're amazing. We bless everybody who's listening. Amen.
 Amen.
