<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end an AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Mr. Jones. - Yes, Madam.
  </li><li>It is episode 241.
 Here we are in the basement, recording again.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, do you want to talk about our weekly catch-up?
  </li><li>No.
 And the reason for that is truth be told,
 We're recording this episode 10 minutes
 after the last episode to finish recording.
  </li><li>It's true, I ran upstairs, changed my clothes,
 changed my hair, and I'm back.
  </li><li>I changed my shirt, and we're back.
 Yes, the reason for that is we're going to go
 and stay with my sister.
 Here's the thing, working from home
 affords you beautiful opportunities.
  </li><li>Which we really haven't taken advantage of.
  </li><li>We have not, so this week I called our boss, Jeff Dollar,
 and just said, "Hey, Jeff, do you care if I work from home?
 Do you care if the home that I'm working from next week is in North Carolina and not
 in Tennessee and he's like, no, I don't mind at all.
 So next week we're going to be away.
 We're going to go stay with my sweet sister, Kerris and her husband, Ben and
 their kids so that our kids and their kids have fun together.
 We can work remotely from anywhere.
 And so we shall accept.
 She doesn't have a podcast studio in our basement, which is really weird.
 Well, the thing is she really doesn't have a basement.
 So that's really the bit of an oversight.
 Yeah.
 So because we didn't want to be apart from you, we are pre recording this to come out in a couple of weeks
 Just trying to be proactive and thinking ahead. That's right. We're thinking of you. So really nothing has happened in the last 10 minutes.
 No, nothing. Well, one thing that's an update if we're doing a weekly update, even though it's only been 10 minutes since our last recording
 Is in between when we change our shirts and change our topics. Um, you just informed me that
 the S.O.S.L. deadline for the school has been extended to June 30th.
 Yeah, we're going to extend it to the 30th because normally we open apps way earlier than we were
 able to this year, but because we had to rebuild the entire backend and a new website and all
 that kind of stuff, we opened apps much later than we expected to. And so we're actually going to
 push that back as far as we can. We can't we can't extend past the 30th, but we're going to
 extended to the 30th.
 So that means if you were praying for a sign from God and maybe you listen to last week's episode
 and like, "Oh my gosh, the 15th is coming up so quickly. I don't have time to get my references
 as I dream." This is a gift from God. You've just got your time extended to June 30th for the
 deadline. That's right. You're welcome. And the school, eight months school, it is a school for life,
 but you learn all sorts of fun stuff. You learn about dream interpretation, how to partner with
 with the Holy Spirit, how to heal the voice of God, how to heal the sick.
  </li><li>Prophetic evangelism.
  </li><li>You learn super practical things like how to manage your finances from a kingdom perspective,
 how to have boundaries, how to... Basically, if you like the content we cover on the podcast,
  </li><li>You'll love it. - You're gonna love the school.
 Plus, you get amazing teachers and speakers and prophets from all over the world coming in and
 teaching.
  </li><li>Yeah, and the content is the same, whether you're online or in person and we will have both.
 So you can either join us online or you can join us in person.
  </li><li>In person.
 You go to graceinner.us/school to find out all about that.
 And so I hope to see you on the school.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Either online or in person.
  </li><li>That'd be good.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Because we have no weekly catch up.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I have put a great listeners question,
 but we're not gonna get to that
 because our topic for this week
 is all about the kindness of God.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Now it shouldn't surprise you,
 but we've talked about the kindness of God before.
 Yes, of course.
 On episode 176, and if you go to the show notes, I'll put a link to a message I preached
 at Grace Center on the kindness of God.
 Basically, every topic we teach about is probably based on the kindness of God because it's
 such an important revelation for us.
 If anybody has got a right to talk about the kindness of God, it would be Graham Cook.
 In fact, Graham was the first person I ever heard talk about the kindness of God.
 But you know, I grew up in an environment where you're talking about sinners in the hands
 of an angry God.
 Right.
 I heard you talk about the father heart of God, which of course encapsulates all the
 loving nature of a father.
 But I heard Graham before I ever met you or heard you.
 And I remember before I heard Graham speak specifically about the kindness of God, which
 if you've never heard Graham cook, I highly encourage you to go look him up on YouTube
 I mean, it's just a phenomenal teacher, prophet, and a friend of God.
 And his lasting revelation and major contribution to the body of Christ is the kindness of God.
 I remember hearing him about, talk about that.
 And I thought it was really sweet, but it didn't really come home until I...
 And I don't think I ever heard him. I think I only read about this.
 He gave a prophetic word years ago.
 I want to say before the year 2000.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And he was in, I think it was Australia.
 and he prophesied, his prophecy was called the favorable year of the Lord out of Isaiah 61.
 Now I was familiar with Isaiah 61, but I was never familiar with his take on the favorable year of
 the Lord. And so he gives this prophecy, I wasn't even there, I read about it on the Elijah list.
 In fact, if you go to the Elijah list, you can still search for the favorable year of the Lord,
 and that will come in Graham's Word and the transcription. But I remember listening to this
 prophetic word. That wasn't to me, it was to this church in Australia, even though I wasn't there,
 and I'm listening to it. And I had this, it's only happened to me a couple of times where I was like,
 he's speaking directly to me. Like this word is to me. I hope, I hope it's okay to steal somebody
 else's prophetic word. And I transcribed that word. I'm going to need to transcribe, I just
 copied and pasted it and cleaned up. I kept it, I prayed it through. And I seem to remember
 listening to it towards the tail end of the year. And then in January, I'd always sit with the
 the Lord and I always get a word for the year. And I remember my word for that year was the
 Lord was talking to me about the kindness, the goodness and the favor of God. And the Lord
 is saying, Alan, all I've decreed for you and your family for the rest of your life.
 Forget a favorable year for the rest of your life. All I have for you is kindness, goodness
 and mercy, a double portion of each. And I remember thinking, wow, that's going to be
 great. And not realizing I am not well versed in what that means. Like I am unacquainted.
 I was just beginning to get used to the fact that God is loving.
 And as far as this is from us, from West, that's how far our sins are moved from us.
 And I was really uncomfortable because I was still really comfortable with if I perform, well, you love me.
 And if I don't, then I understand why you're angry with me.
 Right.
 I wasn't yet well entrenched in the Father's heart, the revelation of the Father's love.
 I hadn't met you.
 I hadn't dealt with any ungodly beliefs.
 And here I have the Lord speaking to me, saying, all I have for you is the kindness, the goodness and favor.
 And I was just thinking, wow, that's amazing.
 So I have this dream.
 This is like the two kind of the three-pronged attack of the kindness of God would be Graham's word,
 the Lord's word to me, and this dream.
 And I have this dream and in the dream, which I think I've told before, is I go to a hotel in Glasgow.
 It was probably the nicest hotel I knew.
 I think it was the Hilton.
 I think it was the Hilton and I check in at the hotel and I'm uncharacteristically meek at check-in.
 And I said, you know, I've got a room reserved and I got this room on like Expedia.
 I got a dirt cheap, like in the dream.
 I paid like this is in a dream.
 You're going to this.
 Yeah.
 And I got you know, so normally what would happen is when I go to a hotel, I would just be boldness for an upgrade.
 That's why I'd always do it.
 Like I know I've experienced that.
 Yeah.
 In the dream, I'm incredibly meek and I've got, I know I don't really deserve to stay at this hotel.
 And I've bought like a cheap ticket on Groupon or something like that.
 And so I go in and I just say, "Hey, you know, do you have a room for me?"
 She says, "Yes, Mr. Jones."
 And she hands me a key, but it's kind of like a gas station bathroom
 in that it's a key attached to a huge rock.
 And I think this is so weird.
 And she says, "If she's got the elevator and you put the key in,
 it'll take you straight to your room."
 And so I go over to the elevator and I think this is weird
 because I don't know the room number or anything.
 And I go in and I put the key in the elevator.
 I'm realizing it's a glass elevator, an all-glass elevator.
 and it takes me to the penthouse of the hotel.
 And I step out of this elevator
 and I'm thinking there must be some mistake.
 And the penthouse is the entire floor of the whole hotel.
 And every room that I go in,
 the room is tailor made for me.
 So I go in a one room and it's extravagant.
 There's not one Steinway Grand Piano.
 There is a room full of Steinway Grand Piano.
 walk into another room and there's not just like one apple product, the room is filled with apple
 products and so on and so forth. Every room I go into, there's something in there that's
 characteristic of what I love. I love staying with grand pianos, I love apple products. You know,
 and so anyway, I am unable to stand because I'm bold over by the sheer extravagance and elaborate
 And just I'm like worn out by the the lavishness of and I don't get it because I didn't pay for this.
 I don't deserve this and and here I am and what I notice is all of the walls of this entire
 floor are all glass. I can see out. I can see out over
 the landscape of Glasgow.
 Glasgow wasn't a city I lived in. I lived in Edinburgh.
 I'm thinking this is unbelievable. Like I need to share this with somebody like it's
 is criminal that I get to absorb all of the stuff.
 You know, the food, I mean, it's just, it's unbelievable.
 And so over in the corner of the room,
 there's a red phone, like a bat phone, you know, like--
  </li><li>Oh, that sounds exciting.
  </li><li>And so I call a family member,
 and I call the family member to tell them
 about what's happened.
 And I'm calling them to tell them,
 'cause it's extravagant, but also to invite them into it
 to experience it with me.
 But when I call this family member, they are not happy.
 They are sour and they are bitter,
 and they try and talk me out of what's happened.
 And I come out the dream and I'm like,
 "Lord, that is such a crazy dream.
 Like what does, it feels significant,
 what does it dream mean?"
 And the Lord just starts speaking to me
 about the dreamness in Alan,
 that's what the rest of your life is gonna be like.
 Now at this point, I'm a school teacher in Edinburgh,
 like I don't have any of the revelation
 of the stuff I have now,
 but the Lord's just like, Alan,
 If you will just follow me in pursuit, in meekness,
 you will find that I will promote you.
 And if you live transparently before me,
 you'll see an acceleration on your life.
 And so, okay, humility, checking in, the rock.
 Christ talks about the rock.
 You know, David talks about, you know, the rock.
 The Lord lift me out of the myery clay
 and set my feet upon the rock that is higher than I.
 It was humility.
 I got taken to the, you know, the penthouse,
 which is, you know, a favor.
 I was in a glass elevator, which is transparent.
 the whole room was glass. You know, I would like yourself from the Lord, He'll give the
 desires of your heart. And so I was like, you know, the Lord's just unpacking this. And
 I said, Lord, what was the deal with the red phone? And the Lord was like, ah, not everybody
 will respond kindly to the favor that's upon your life. And I didn't understand that. I
 didn't understand why people would be upset with favor. Now, I didn't understand it because
 I didn't understand how favor operated. It. So those three things, the dream, the word
 from the Lord, the word from Graham Cook, started me on this journey to understanding
 what kindness, the kindness of God was, what the favor of God was, the goodness of God.
 I had no paradigm for it.
 And I would say I have been a slow student in these things because of all the obstacles
 to me.
 And the obstacles would largely be my mindset and my upbringing.
 You know, and I've talked about this a lot.
 Like if you grow up in a household or a culture that doesn't value abundance, but values measure,
 that values limitation, abundance can only be seen as wasteful.
 Yeah.
 Right?
 You see this in the scriptures where the woman breaks open the bottle of Nord, which is worth
 a year salary.
 So $90,000 is the median salary in Williamson County.
 Yeah.
 It's $90,000, pours over Jesus' feet.
 And Judas said that money, that was a waste,
 that money could be given to the poor.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>If you grow up without an a value
 for the kindness of God and the way he deals with us,
 then it's highly offensive.
  </li><li>Yes, that makes sense.
  </li><li>And that was my problem.
 You see, and also my mistake that I made was,
 I assumed that the kindness of God meant,
 I'll never face trials or difficulty.
  </li><li>Right, which that is not what it means at all.
  </li><li>Oh! - Yes.
 No, not at all.
 I mean, see, he'll accompany you through all the trials
 and all the difficulties.
  </li><li>And in the midst of them, you will still know his kindness
 and you will still know his goodness.
  </li><li>And the midst of some of the hardest things
 I've ever been through.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>He's right there going, hi.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How are you?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, he's never left my side.
 He's always optimistic, always incredibly passionate
 and always full of adventure.
 So now, before I unpack that any further,
 I just don't want this to be a giant monologue
 where I talk about the kindness of God.
 I want to pause and say that was my foundation
 that I started to learn about the kinds of God.
 And the learning that I did was not book knowledge
 that came, but it was experiential knowledge
 where the Lord had to kind of rewrite my expectations
 of what walking with a kind God is like.
 Before I jump into all of that,
 what talked to me about what you were thinking about?
  </li><li>Oh, I've been thinking about a bunch of different things.
 I've been thinking about goodness and kindness
 are in the Holy Spirit's job description, you know,
 Galatians 522.
 It is his DNA, it is God's DNA to be kind, to be good.
 And I have a hard time separating those two things.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>His goodness and his kindness.
 I think they run together so well.
 I was also thinking today just, you know,
 as I was driving home from my last meeting
 before we were gonna record,
 I was thinking about something a friend of ours said
 in 2014, which we have a friend named Beth.
 Ben Farley and he's gone home to be with the Lord.
 But I remember we were visiting him in a hospice and just talking to him about
 how you're doing and whatever.
 And you know, there was, there can be a temptation, particularly when you're
 terminally ill or, I mean, it can take much less than that.
 Who's days away from leaving the source?
 Yes.
 And I remember him saying, AJ, I will not move away from the goodness and the
 kindness of God.
 I just will not allow my perspective to move away from he is good and he is kind no matter what's happening
 And it made me sort of think of I had a couple different people check in with me
 At the end of last year after being sick so much and a couple different people like asked me like how did you?
 Navigate that where you mad at God where you disappointed with God that you got sick where you whatever and it
 Honestly never occurred to me to like I don't equate the fact that I got sick with God is no longer good
 and God is no longer kind because even in the midst of all that, he was with me in it.
 And his plan is never steel kill destroy.
 It's never any of those things.
 So because I know he's good, because I know he's kind, I just don't entertain thoughts
 that could lead to thinking anything different than that, if that makes sense.
 So yeah, I think about Psalm 23, you know, which is all about his goodness and his nature
 that he prepares a table for me in the midst of my enemies.
 It's not that our revelation of the kindness of God excuses you from having enemies,
 it means he dines with you in the midst of it and even having enemies doesn't trouble you.
 I even think about the ending, like surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life.
 And I think that's what the Lord just drilled into me because I had...
 I don't know, but I used to have good days, good God days, and bad God days.
 Like, I know that God will never leave me never forsake me because the Bible teaches me that, right?
 But I would have days where having God near me was like, "Oh, it's great.
 It's about in top experience. Then I'd have days where it was bad."
 You know, like, "Oh, I'm straight at this and then. Why aren't you changing this?
 Why are you broken through here for me?"
 And, you know, my connection with the Lord would be up and down largely dependent on my experience,
 my daily experience. Now, try and combat that with, like,
 angry myself in the Word, but I still felt those things. And then a Lord came along and the Holy Spirit
 walked beside me and taught me how to see his redemptive nature and everything. And one of your
 key verses is Romans 8, 28. And so there's a difference between knowing Scripture and being
 fully persuaded by them. Knowing Scripture as a like a SOS, SOS life vest. I'll just quote these
 scriptures and then knowing the confidence and the truth of them. Yeah. I think that's the thing
 for me, like when you say going up and down, I would say, yeah, I probably did that a little
 bit at the beginning, probably the deeper that I went into the revelation of the Father
 heard of God, the less, the less up and down and the more it started to smooth out.
 But I would say the revelation of the fall heart of God is the revelation of the kindness
 of God.
 Oh, for sure.
 So, yeah, you're saying the more I got acquainted with the revelation of the kindness and the
 goodness of God.
 Yeah.
 Because to begin with, really, by the skin of my teeth, I'm hanging onto Romans 828.
 we know that God causes all things, you know, I have to believe you're going to do something
 good because I love you. And I don't know how you turn this horrible situation around.
 And I would also hang on to that verse about, I can't remember the, you might remember the
 address of it, but it's a bruised read. He would not break and a smoldering wick. He
 would not snuff out. And I just, because I remember so many times feeling like, Oh,
 I'm there, like I'm bruised and smoldering over here. But your word says, you know, you're
 going to, you're not going to bring destruction, but you're actually going to bring restoration.
 And so I have to hold on to that, even though none of my circumstances right now look like
 that's the truth. But certainly, yeah, the more that I pressed into the father heart
 of God revelation more into his goodness, into his kindness, the less, the less of a
 wave there was. And the more of a just like, okay, I don't know how to explain this thing
 that's happening over here that feels very uncomfortable
 or very hard or very whatever,
 but he is good.
 And somehow at some point I will see his goodness in this.
 And I think also the more situations that I went through
 where I saw him Romans 828 it,
 where I can look back and go, that was horrible,
 but God did this.
 And then this was so difficult
 and I didn't know how he was gonna break through,
 but he did.
 Then you start to face things differently
 because you have this track record of he did it here,
 he did it here, he did it here, he will do it here.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So yeah.
  </li><li>I remember two key events very early on
 when the Lord was trying to teach me about the kindness
 and the goodness of God.
 What are you?
  </li><li>That was my stomach.
 Was this growled really loud?
  </li><li>Oh, I thought it was an earthquake.
  </li><li>No, no, just my stomach.
 It's all good. - Okay.
  </li><li>We're safe.
  </li><li>Two key events that really knocked me on my butt
 because it wasn't in my paradigm to think about the way God was treating me.
 The first came very shortly after I got that revelation,
 you know, the word that he gave me at the start of the year is like,
 "All I have for you is goodness and kindness."
 Is around this time in the UK,
 British gas had a monopoly on who provided gas to your house.
 And then something changed and there are lots of companies
 spraying up and could offer you gas to your house.
 And so unscrupulous companies would just sign up new customers to steal you away from British gas.
 And so that happened to me.
 I came home one day.
 And even though I hadn't asked to be switched to a different gas company, some unscrupulous person had signed me away from British gas and signed me up for another company.
 And so I come home to a gas bill for something I didn't want more to the point.
 I'm really angry at this has happened.
 And so I get on the phone with them and I just give them what for.
 I just like go up one side of the person and come down the other side and just.
 in the middle as I'm reaming this person out.
 You know, I want to speak to supervise blah blah blah.
 I feel like the Holy Spirit just goes,
 "Whoop, away from me."
 And I think, blah blah, like that's weird.
 So I finished my conversation berating this poor person
 on a, you know, 1-800 number or an 0800 number
 'cause it was in Britain.
 And as I finish the call,
 I go to look for the Holy Spirit
 and I'm like, "Holy Spirit, where did you go?"
 And the Holy Spirit, you know, it didn't leave in a half.
 He was just off to the side and quiet.
 when I went and speak to him, he just said,
 Alan, courtesy is the hallmark of the kingdom of heaven.
 Like I can't bear witness to that.
 Like I can't bear witness to the way
 you were speaking to that person.
 So rather than listen to what he's trying to teach me,
 I protest and defend myself.
 Lord, you don't understand this happened,
 that happened the next thing.
 And the Lord's like, have you forgotten already the promise
 that like all this is for the rest of your life
 is the season of double portions.
 That's all it is, it's goodness and mercy and kindness.
 like why did you feel like you had to rush
 and defend yourself in it?
 And in the process leave your identity.
 'Cause you weren't behaving like an ambassador
 of the kingdom of heaven.
 You were in your flesh yelling at this person,
 trying to manage it yourself.
 And I had this revelation of like,
 'cause I've never had someone take up my cause.
 Like it never even occurred to me to come to you about that.
 And so I remember the Lord really carefully speaking to me
 saying, my kindness is always available to you, but sometimes it's apparent.
 And sometimes you have to go looking for it.
 So every situation that presents itself is an opportunity for my kindness to be
 on display.
 So I was like, okay, well, with this gas situation where I'm having to pay, you
 know, double gas bill and it's just an administrative mess.
 And the Lord's like, well, if you'd let me deal with it, you'll see that you
 will be blessed.
 I will ensure that a double portion comes out of this.
 So I was like, all right, Lord, I'll take my hands off
 and let you sort out.
 And what ended up happening is I didn't pay gas
 for several months.
 And I got a rebate on top of this.
 There's your double portion.
 I didn't pay for it and I got money back.
 But also around that time,
 I started getting double portions of things.
 I remember I was a member of one of my favorite restaurants
 in the UK, Pizza Express.
 I was one of the members.
  </li><li>They're so bold. - They're very doable.
 And I remember if you signed up and you remember
 that I know they gave you a gift on your birthday.
 Well, when it came to my birthday, they sent me two of them.
 And I called them and said, hey, you know,
 I got two of these in the mail.
 like, well, enjoy. So there's lots of these little tokens about a double portion.
 That was the first thing, like, I didn't understand, like, God had to teach me if it matters to you,
 it matters to me. And I will take care of you. And the second thing that that taught me was,
 if the kinds of God is not visible, it's not because it's not there, it's an invitation to go
 search for it. You know, the glory of God to conceal a man or the glory of kings to search
 matter out. Many years later, I'm in Japan. I think we talked about this me and you and
 John and Carol and Roland Baker doing a conference in Japan in the middle of that conference.
 You remember my laptop dies. And the story of how I got this laptop was a real treat in
 the treasure. It was the goodness of God and the kind of God. So here's this laptop die.
 My whole livelihood depends on this laptop. And we don't have the money to buy a new Apple
 laptop. No. Thousands of dollars. Yeah. So I haven't learned my lesson. I just think it's
 mind to fix this, mind to solve, I'm going to be a good steward.
 And I just start like strategizing how I'm going to fix this.
 And I start looking at Craigslist and how I can buy second hand this or
 trade this for that and trade that.
 And then, and again, actually, the Lord doesn't speak to me about it at all.
 The Lord's just letting me panic and distress and just trying to fix it all
 myself. And you know, I do it myself.
 I do it myself.
 I do it myself.
 What stage of sonship is that?
 Padian.
 All right.
 Yeah.
 I am fleshing out.
 Yeah.
 I'm not, I am not, I've forgotten to look for the kindness of God, because to
 to be honest, the kindness of God is that he gave me a laptop.
 Now it's broken.
  </li><li>Right, you're not gonna do it again.
 He gave me a laptop once already.
 You know, you took care of this.
  </li><li>Well, that's around the time
 that somebody sends us a check for $20,000 to buy a new computer.
 And I'm so filled with toxic shame.
 I haven't told anybody that I need this computer
 or the laptop's broken rather.
 And it sends me a check for $20,000.
 And so I call this person and said,
 What, you just sent me a check for $20,000.
 We're like, yeah, we just want to invest in you.
 You go buy a new computer.
 I'm thinking like a new computer costs like two and a half,
 $1,000.
 So I think I'm going to reverse tithe on this.
 I'll show God as in, I'm going to give away 90% and only spend 10%.
 No sooner that I had that thought, the Lord, I don't want to say visited me,
 but spoke very clearly to me.
 and with soberness, not anger, but with soberness.
 He was like, " Alan, I'm trying to teach you something."
 You know, like, that's not what the money isn't for you
 to give away, the money is for you to buy a laptop.
 And so I remember the Lord instructing us
 to go to the Apple store and buy,
 it wasn't just what we needed,
 but it was more than enough.
 Those two events, like, I've got so many events
 in our history of the kindness of God showing up
 in tangible ways.
 But those two things were bedrock in that they shook my thinking and prepared me for
 new thinking.
 I remember listening to you teach about the parable of the prodigal son and one day you
 said, well, it really should be called the parable of the prodigal father because prodigal
 talks about the excessive nature.
 Extravagants.
 And the fathers in that story, his extravagance in meeting and covering his son's errors would
 be offensive to the hearers of the day.
 And I would say that largely the kindness of God is such an offensive theology.
 And the kindness of God really isn't based on our performance, which is also very offensive
 if you are performance oriented because I'm performing in order to earn.
 I'm also going to be watching that everybody else is not earning if they have not performed.
 And so it becomes extremely offensive that he is good and he is kind regardless of performance.
 So let's go back to my red phone in the dream.
 Yes.
 If you live in a culture where everybody believes what you just described, that we need to earn
 rewards from God, then favor is highly offensive.
 God's kindness is highly offensive.
 In part because we're confused and we believe that their favor, their kindness that God
 just showed them came at the expense of me receiving kindness and suffering from God.
 Right.
 Like there's a limited supply.
 There's a limited supply.
 fair as the they got all that and they're not even a good Christian. Right? And the truth,
 the gospel, the good news of Jesus. There's some judgment in there too.
 Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. But that's what's running our internal life.
 Is that God is kinder than we could possibly imagine. Yes.
 He says, good as he is great and he's constantly planning or good. He can do abundantly more than
 than we ask or imagine. I mean, he's so excessive in his kindness. Like the gospel message is so
 scandalous that we are forgiven that we swap places with Jesus. It's this perfect life.
 And we get, you know, we get his sinless, spotless record and he pays for our sin.
 That's where entrance to the kingdom begins. And at some point I learned, well, that's enough and
 and you shouldn't expect anymore.
 And yeah, what the Lord's taken in this journey
 for the last 20, I don't know, 25 years is that,
 and I don't mean to demean the work of the cross,
 that is the ground floor of the kingdom.
 That's the entrance fee to the kingdom of God.
 And as Paul said, now that, you know,
 having given us as only son,
 now we'll not also give us so much more.
 And there's so much more is like, you know,
 I am constantly in a state of,
 I feel punch drunk with gratitude.
 I feel like, Lord, oh, come on.
 Like you've got to be kidding.
 Like how good are you?
 Are there any limits to your goodness?
 Because day by day, week by week, month by month,
 I'm constantly being saturated
 by the goodness and the kindness of God.
 Even this last year, which is arguably one of the hardest
 years that we've walked through,
 still the extravagance and the kindness
 and the goodness of God.
 It's like one area over here is going really tough.
 Ah, I'll overwhelm you.
 Here's a simple example.
 This might seem pithy and trite and silly,
 but it's a genuine thing.
 I'm minding my own business last week,
 and Bill and Karen Zofel, who run our food pantry.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>All right, we have a food pantry at Grace Center,
 and Bill and Karen are constantly,
 I mean, these guys are just genius stewards.
  </li><li>Amazing.
  </li><li>Working with all our local supermarkets,
 and they just get all the excess food,
 and then we give it away to our community.
 And sometimes we get way more food than we've got places to storage and they're known in our community as being food pushers.
 Well, the blue.
 The best kind of food pushers.
 Emails me says, hey, we've got some Scottish cheese and I'm thinking, that's sweet.
 He thinks because I'm Scottish, I'm missing Scottish fare and I'm not.
 But I do love a good cheese.
 Well, British cheese, UK cheese.
 It's very good.
 So much better than here.
 So I'm like, oh, that's so kind of you to think of it.
 And I just think, you know, they're just being sweet.
 And so they leave it in the fridge, you go pick up because you're at, happened to be at church and you bring it home.
 And it's three packages, four packages of some of the most delicious cheese I've ever eaten in my life.
 I didn't even know I wanted this cheese.
 And the Lord going, you know, you need to upgrade some cheese.
 You need cheese.
 You've had a rough week.
 You know, it would be good as some cheese puts it on their heart.
 And we, you know, now that sounds silly and ridiculous, but it's a token of the Lord's
 affection that is replete through our life. Yeah. And yeah, and not everybody will respond
 kindly to it. Yeah. So how do you, how do you, if you're in a season of difficulty,
 yes, keep your focus on the goodness and kindness about like what's some practical things?
 Well, initially, it was the promise of God's word.
 Like, I'll never leave you.
 I'll never forsake you.
 You know, Romans 828.
 I mean, the Bible is littered with promises.
 If I'm for you, who can be against you?
 You've got to take those promises and you've got to apply them to your circumstances.
 You have to make your circumstances bend to the truth of Scripture, not allow your circumstances
 to bend or out shape Scripture.
 Or the very least, grab on to those things and not allow your current circumstances to
 shift your perspective on who he is.
 Well I remember the Lord teaching me that, like at times in life you're going to have
 to turn around and find that surely goodness and mercy have been following you all the
 days of your life.
 Because you might be so focused on the problem that you forget.
 Oh, there you are.
 You know what, we're good.
 We're good here.
 I'm not trying to say I've got this thing licked,
 but initially that was a discipline.
 Now it's become, I know what you're up to.
 Like I'm facing a situation right now,
 that is a personal crisis for me,
 where I'm like, Lord, I don't see how this is gonna get.
 I don't see how this is not even get resolved,
 but I don't see how in the natural,
 what's gonna happen here?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And yet recently I've got growing excitement
 with a file like, I know what you're up to.
 to. I don't know how you're going to do it and it's not my job, but I've got great confidence in
 your track record with me and my history with you that you're not only going to work this for my
 good, and where that reaches is, where that reaches is, what that does is, no matter the outcome
 of this thing, which is so beyond my, I'm not in control of the outcome, whereas before I could
 could catastrophize these outcomes.
 Now I'm like, oh Lord, like it's win, win, win, win.
 No matter what happens, you're planning this for my good.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That didn't come easy.
 That's a lot of experience with the Lord
 of him constantly demonstrating himself faithful.
 And you know there's been times
 in that instance where I've been shaky.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But it's a constant invitation to look
 for the kindness and the goodness of God.
  </li><li>Just look in his face.
 Well, as you're talking about that,
 have this, this story to tell, like just, and this is going to
 seem like a random story for what we're talking about. But this
 is what just keeps, I love your random story. It keeps playing
 in my head. And, and that is the last time that we went to Disney.
 It's a Disney story. Okay, this story could not get better.
 Right? It's about the kindness of God and Disney Disney.
 Disney, even as getting to go that time to Disney. I don't know
 if you remember, we had just moved homes and and we literally
 had no finances. The kids were praying that we would get to
 go to Disney, we had told them, I'm sorry, we're not going to be able to go to Disney.
 And somebody out of the blue paid for our whole family to go to Disney for a week.
 I remember that very well.
 Two days before we were supposed to be on vacation, but we were going to be on stay
 cation.
 And it was just literally like we got to tell them we're going and we're leaving tomorrow.
 You know, it was like, it was amazing.
 Yeah.
 But anyway, we go to Disney and at the time, MJ is about three and a half.
 And, you know, we're doing all the different rides and all that kind of stuff.
 But anyway, we go on the Avatar ride and it was a new ride.
 And I can't remember the name of it, but basically you're all in like a long skinny room and
 you're on what looked kind of like motorcycles and you kind of strap into them.
 And, and then you're wearing like goggles or something looking at a screen, three goggles.
 before you know it, you've launched, you know, off of a cliff and you're riding your dinosaur and,
 you know, all this dinosaur, but whatever those things are, dragons, dragons. Okay.
 So, riding your dinosaur. Anyway, MJ is beside me. On the other side of him is like Abigail or
 something. And you're like this way. And MJ freaks out. Like, and I can't reach him. And we're all
 strapped into this thing that's moving, we're in a room by ourselves.
 Like it's like, we're going to have to ride this thing out.
 And I'm trying to go MJ, you're okay, you're okay.
 And he's just losing it.
 And I literally was like, Holy spirit, what do I do?
 And he was like, have him look at your face.
 So I took off my goggles.
 I was like, buddy, take off your goggles.
 Look at mummy.
 And so even though his motorcycle thing is like moving and do all the different things,
 he just looked at my face.
 And so I'm just smiling at him.
 I'm going, you're okay, bud.
 You're okay.
 You know, we're in this room. You're okay. You know, just keep looking at mommy's face. Keep looking at mommy's face
 And that's how we
 In he calmed down and it just looked at my face and I just talked to him while our things are moving in all these different directions
 We're okay, buddy. We're okay. Don't look at the screen. It's okay, you know, and then you know the ride ends
 And I was just thinking about that because that's kind of what we do
 You know in situations where we're like wow the outside environment
 feels hazardous or these circumstances feel very difficult.
 And the trick is to get your eyes on the one who's there with you.
 Um, because you're not there alone.
 You're never there alone.
 And eventually whatever these circumstances are, they end, you know, at the
 right ends and you can take off the, you know, little seat belt and you're okay.
 You know, but that was what I was thinking about when you were sharing that.
 It's like, it's sort of the simplest way to encapsulate.
 How do we navigate seasons where it feels like,
 I know he's good and I know he's kind,
 but everything around me is screaming something different.
 It's like, oh, get your eyes on who's in the room.
  </li><li>Yeah, look in the space.
  </li><li>Yeah, so that was my thought.
  </li><li>Beautiful thought, baby.
  </li><li>I am looking forward to doing that ride again
 without a screaming three and a half year old.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, I bet.
  </li><li>So there you go, there's some thoughts
 about the kindness of God.
 I would encourage you, if this has challenged you,
 is offensive to you,
 if your first response to this message is objection,
 you are ripe for an upgrade
 in your thinking about how God feels about your life.
  </li><li>Yeah, very sure.
  </li><li>If your very first thought is all objections,
 congratulations, God's just set the landscape
 for the specific areas that he would love to be offensive
 to you and his goodness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because it's utterly glorious.
 The goodness and the kindness of God,
 there's no toxic limits to it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Let me pivot slightly.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And I wanna read you a question that I got.
  </li><li>Am I answering the question?
  </li><li>Well, I think we're both gonna answer this question,
 but it's-
  </li><li>Okay, it's not a technical question this time.
  </li><li>No, no, this time is not about securing your internet.
  </li><li>Okay, good, yeah.
  </li><li>This is a wonderful question.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>Which I kinda wanted to keep
 for the Boundary Summer School.
 And maybe I'll post it in the Boundary Summer School Forum
 so that we, 'cause it's such a common question.
 Are you ready for this?
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>All right.
 How do you handle a situation where people you care about
 have been hurt by leadership?
 There's gonna be leadership at work,
 leadership in church, any of those things, but leadership.
 Who you also care about, and both of them aren't talking.
 So a person's been hurt,
 and they're not talking to leadership about it.
 Presumably leadership doesn't know about it, and they're not talking to it because any good leaders would go talk to the person.
 I almost always have encouraged the victim to talk to leadership, and sometimes they have, and it didn't help, or they haven't, or won't.
 Usually, I've only heard the side of the victim and not the leadership.
 However, when these situations come up, usually it seems I've only had more relationship with the leadership, so it doesn't feel like it's a simple, let me just ask them about it.
 Because I also don't want to step into something that's not also my business.
 But if what the person says is true, it would warrant a conversation as it could really affect relationship with myself and other people.
 So what this person's saying is, "Hey, when this person comes and brings me a complaint about leadership, sometimes I've had relationship with a leadership, but I don't really want to go and present their case."
 No, of course not.
 But what I thought they just said is true and these leaders are those things that could affect me or others
 So you can already feel the tension right now remember a couple of weeks ago
 We released this episode about living in tension peace. So when I saw this I was like, oh, this is a great question to unpack a little bit
 How do you walk a line of staying out of things and or holding leadership accountable?
 I typically lean toward being a savior
 So I'm aware I don't want to do that, but I also feel this desire to hear the leadership side to make sure rumors aren't being spread,
 while also holding them accountable if it's true.
 I love this question!
 My heart is to love my friend or co-worker, whoever it is.
 Love them really well, while also honoring my leadership.
 If my friend/co-worker can't let it go, then that's their business.
 But I also feel like if it's true, I want to care for my leader's heart and make sure
 I'm holding them accountable by either helping them understand how they're being experienced
 or giving them an opportunity to repent.
 Having been a leader, I would want to be given grace, but I also want to be held accountable.
 AJ Jones!
 Wow!
 Let's put on our Wellington boots and let's wade into what I call this dysfunction soup.
 There's so much in there.
 I mean, first of all, the person who's asking the question
 and saying, "Hey, I don't wanna be the third person
 in this thing."
 That would be something we would say.
 You don't wanna triangle.
 You don't ever wanna be the person in the midst
 that's trying to sort that out.
  </li><li>Well, before we even get to that,
 what you can really hear in this person's question,
 anonymous question, is their heart?
  </li><li>Yes. - Oh my God.
 They've got a heart of a peacemaker.
 I love their heart.
 Their heart is, "They've got people who are in pain
 and I don't want them to be in pain."
 And actually the people who've caused them pain
 don't even know about it.
 And also what if what they're saying is really true.
 I don't want them causing more pain.
 And actually what if you can feel the,
 you can feel all the feelings there.
 And so it's a beautiful important question to ask.
 And what you were saying about,
 you don't ever want to be in.
 Why don't you ever want to be in that position?
  </li><li>Well, it's, why don't you?
 I don't think it's going to be healthy for anybody.
 I mean, if you step in and have the conversation
 and say that person,
 They don't actually, the victim of this scenario doesn't end up actually ever learning any
 good life skills.
 You know, they're just going to carry around all of their wounding and bitterness and never
 learn to resolve anything, which is just, I mean, it's no way to live.
 You've just picked up an offense.
 Yes.
 Because now you're, now you're fighting somebody else's battle.
 Yeah.
 With somebody without all the information, you've got a second hand information.
 Yeah.
 Dave Ramsey puts it this way.
 He says a zero tolerance policy at his work for what he calls gossip.
 Now, as soon as you say gossip, you think we know what we mean.
 But what he is describing is this question right here.
 Right.
 And he said, it's entirely unfair.
 It's unfair to the person with the problem because, you know, this person's,
 let's say I come to you, Chris is in the office.
 So let's set up a triangle right now.
 Right.
 Okay.
 Let's say I come to you and let's say Chris is our boss.
 Okay.
 I come to you and say, I'm really hurting upset because Chris is a leader and he's
 this and he's that and he never gives me what I need and he never answers my emails and he never
 says this right that is unfair to everybody yes right what I've just done is unfair to you
 yeah because you're not christen you can't fix it no but you just colored christen my eyes as well
 because you're like what if i've never experienced christ like that what if he is like that right
 it's not fair to me because i don't have my problem solved yeah and it's not fair to christ
 because he doesn't know that I've got this problem and can't fix it.
 So we call that a triangle.
 Triangling.
 And this poor anonymous has been sucked into the vortex of that triangle of like, "But
 maybe I can help."
 And the only way you can help is to go back to, your response should be, "Alina, you're
 telling me this because you need to help working out how best to confront Chris?"
 No, I'm just telling you because like, "Chris won't even listen anyway."
 The only thing you can do is like, "I can see that you're in pain, but I can't be the
 person to help you end the pain. Yeah. And you need to go speak to Chris.
 Yeah. And if you'd like help, you know, in knowing what to say, I could do that, but I'm
 not just going to sit here and talk about Chris.
 And then the so Dave Roundy talks about this is unfair to everybody involved in the cycle.
 Yes. And that's one of the things we try and encourage everybody. Right. There is no easy
 way out of that thing. And so anonymous, you're there and I love your heart, but you are dangerously
 close to it, emishment, codependency and entanglement, because you can't help this person. We've
 been on the receiving end as leaders. We've been on the receiving end of well-meaning other
 leaders coming. Imagine I come to you and go, "Hey babe, Chris spoke to me earlier and he's
 really upset with you and I just want to let you know that like as a good Christian. But oh, but
 Chris doesn't know I've come to you and actually Chris would be really upset if he knew, right?
  </li><li>Yeah. - Or maybe even worse,
 I come to you and go, "Somebody, AJ's come to me,
 and they're not happy with you as a leader."
 Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry, who?
 I can't tell you that, 'cause that would be disclosing.
  </li><li>Right. - Well, now nobody can be helped.
  </li><li>Right, and because me as a leader,
 if I know that I've hurt someone,
 or I know that there's some sort of offense out there,
 I want to talk to them,
 I want to see what I can own, where I can apologize,
 like because I want to be as much as possible restored to all men.
 You know what I mean?
 Like, so yeah, those kinds of situations, and they have come up before they're
 so frustrating because then all I know is there's somebody with some sort of
 offense out there that doesn't want to talk to me about it.
 So how can I help them?
 So how can I help?
 But then you just have the residue of great.
 I've hurt someone somehow.
 Which one of you is upset?
 Right, which is just not helpful either.
 Right.
 You know, so it's so tricky.
 I think I was talking to somebody about two weeks ago
 and they were saying, hey, you know,
 I wanted to talk to you about something,
 but I don't know if it's gossip.
 And I said, well, let's stop for a second.
 Am I somebody who can help you with the situation,
 i.e., you're handing the conversation up
 for lack of a better word to help bring resolution
 Or are you just wanting to talk about this person without seeking any kind of resolution?
 Yeah.
 And they said, no, I'm asking you, can you help me?
 Different story.
 Right.
 So I'm like, well, then it isn't gossip, but it is gossip.
 If you just want to sit there and talk about Frank or Susie, but you're not actually
 looking for input and you're not actually looking for restoration and you're not
 going to follow through on any of those things.
 And in which case, I don't want to hear it.
 The other thing that I thought was really interesting about Anonymous's question, they said,
 "Usually I've only heard the side of the victim and not the leadership."
 And that's the problem. Scripture says one man's way seems right till another presents his case.
 Right.
 And actually, this person may be right.
 So let's assume that the victim is entirely justified.
 This person is now like, "Ah, now I have this problem with this leader."
 Potentially, but I don't even know.
 There's nothing to stop Anonymous in this situation going to this leader going,
 "Hey, I have some concerns about this happening in the future."
 Like, you can only go and be present with your own fears.
 It's not wise to go be present with somebody else's fear.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So, a beautiful question called triangling.
 It's really not wise.
 And I don't know why,
 and honestly, I don't know if this is gonna be helpful for you
 to hear.
 I was taken out of the trash last night,
 and the Holy Spirit reminded me of this phrase.
 And the phrase is,
 "You will be ineffective in life and in ministry
 unless you learn to allow loved ones to suffer.
 And it just randomly came, I was like,
 that's weird, Lord, why are you reminding me of that line?
 It's a line I usually say, well, I'm teaching.
 But I'm taking out my garbage.
 And so maybe I'll talk about it in the boundaries
 at Summer School this weekend,
 but I'll throw it out there for you.
  </li><li>If you wanna ask a question,
 you can go to <a href="mailto:alan@aj.com">alan@aj.com</a>/ask.
  </li><li>I have another little cute thing.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Remember last week I read out something from a member.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I got another one, this is from Laura.
 Laura says this.
 This podcast is one of my favorite things to watch and listen to.
 I didn't realize how much more impacting it would be to see you guys talking
 and visually emoting.
 It makes sense with the brain science on learning,
 but I hadn't drawn that connection until after I became a member.
 What Laura's talking about there is our membership program.
 If you become a member,
 you can get video access to all our podcasts and a backlog of our video
 podcast as well. You get discounts on our products.
 You get priority Q&amp;A, you can connect us
 through our online forum as well.
 But I just thought it was so sweet
 in the last couple of weeks I've got members saying,
 hey, I became a member.
 Oh my gosh, I'm loving being able to watch the podcast.
 And if you would like to become a member,
 if you wanna watch the podcast,
 go to allen and agi.com/join.
  </li><li>So good.
  </li><li>Show notes, baby.
  </li><li>Hey, I'll talk about the show notes in just a second,
 but I also got a text this week.
 Yeah, from a friend of ours.
 And let me just find this because,
 You know, if I thought about it, wait, this does not feel like I'm going to end up looking good in this.
 No, no, it's, it's all good.
 Just take a deep breath.
 Look at mommy.
 Look at mommy.
 That's creepy.
 That's what I was saying.
 MJ on the right.
 Look at mommy.
 Just look at mommy.
 Our friend Neil in Scotland says, AJ, further to your informal poll as a Scott from the UK.
 I suck at swimming.
 After all, why would anyone in their right mind go swimming in the North Sea?
 Ask Alan in brackets.
 However, Pam has a wetsuit and loves a bit of cold water swimming, which she is
 very good at and is good for your health.
 So apparently they're divided, but he says he sucks at swimming and he's.
 Yeah.
 So I just thought I'd like throw that out there.
 Just just like a
 for vindication.
 Yeah, just a little bit.
 Yeah.
 I think the question was, where do people go for their show notes?
 not can you give me supplementary evidence to support your racist view that
 bros people okay you get the show you get the show notes at work you get them
 from alanahj.com/241
