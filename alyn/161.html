<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Do you know what time it is?<br/>
 It's podcast time.<br/>
 It is, but it's unusual because we're<br/>
 recording this on a Friday afternoon.<br/>
 We are.<br/>
 And we normally record our podcast on Sunday night.
 This might be brilliant.<br/>
 Maybe this could be our new normal.<br/>
 Well, the difficulty is half the week is missing.
 I mean, not half the week.<br/>
 Well, the weekend hasn't.<br/>
 Friday, Saturday, Sunday.<br/>
 A lot happens in those three days.
</p><ul>
  <li>We could pretend that we've already lived the weekend
 and just be prophetic about how much fun
 we're gonna have this weekend.
  </li><li>I like that.
 Or we could just make this sound
 new normal and wrap it in to the following week,
 but then it just feels disjointed.
  </li><li>I don't know.
 It's just not a bad idea though to record on a Friday
 'cause Sundays are so brutal.
  </li><li>They are.
 Yeah.
 The reason we're recording this Friday
 is because this coming Sunday
 is gonna be slightly more in the brutal department.
 Yes, because we're all going to be at churches of family.
 Yes.
 We have guests staying with us this weekend.
 Yes.
 We have to drive them to the airport.
 Yes.
 And then I'm speaking twice at the belonging.
 Yes.
 And so by the time we're done with that, we'll be home about 10 p.m.
 And that doesn't seem like the best time to record a podcast,
 although we have done before on several occasions.
 So we're trying to be smart, proactive, and whatnot.
 Yeah.
 But anyway, if we sound different,
 it's because it's like 2 o'clock in the afternoon
 on a Friday instead of like 8 p.m. on a Sunday.
 Yes.
 It's weird being in our studio and being able to see sunshine rather than like.
 I know, but the thing is I spent a couple hours this afternoon making our
 hedges look good and there's like one part I couldn't reach and that's all I
 can see now.
 I might need to close the drapes because otherwise all I can see is that offensive
 branch.
 Just fix your eyes on me, baby.
 Okay.
 You're so handsome.
 There we go.
 I don't see the offensive branch at all.
 It's not in my peripheral screaming at me.
 Tell me how your week was, Gardener Lady.
 It was good week.
 We just sort of a normal week.
 Got stuff done.
 I got some stuff written for something I'm working on, which is great.
 Yeah, it was normal week.
 Just lots of meetings.
 Yeah.
 Lots of fun meetings.
 Yeah.
 You spoke at M&amp;A Monday night.
 I did.
 On the sound of your yes.
 The sound of your yes.
 Can I do a brief synopsis of that?
 Yeah, go ahead.
 I want to see what you got from it.
 This is a quiz.
 It's a pop quiz, baby.
 That's not what I had in mind.
 Oh.
 I just thought you had an interesting concept that we give God our yes.
 But sometimes our yes, yes, or yes.
 question mark, right?
 And you're talking about the difference of resolute yes means.
 Yes.
 And I thought it was very powerful.
 And you talk all about the power of the sound like you went all like metaphysical
 on us and thought about sound waves and showed some cool videos.
 I did.
 I got to do a whole bunch of research, which always, I always find that fun.
 You're very sweet, bunny.
 Thanks.
 Do you want to do a snake update?
 Okay.
 So this week, our friend Judah came over to, I asked him if he would look at the snake.
 He said, I will aggression test the snake.
 And I was like, dude, that doesn't sound safe.
 And he said he was basically like the crocodile hunter.
 So, you know, there you go.
 So he came over and aggression tested our snake by poking at it with a stick
 with a pillowcase on the end of it and it did nothing.
 And then he moved it around and it did nothing.
 It just seemed happy as Larry.
 No, he literally physically prodded and tried to get the snake to bite him.
 He tried to get it to bite and the conclusion and the conclusion is it's potentially a very old snake.
 It's about five feet long.
 We have decided to keep him because apparently he'll keep, I don't know, critters away and poison snakes and poisonous snakes.
 Still it's a five foot long constrictor snake.
 Yes, but they're not aggressive.
 Well, that one isn't right.
 He literally tapped it on the nose with his stick and it did nothing.
 He just didn't care.
 Well, now I'm going to go get some closer photos if it's not aggressive.
 Well, I don't know if I want you getting close to it.
 No, I'm not like, grape around my neck and stuff like that.
 Yeah, let's not do that.
 No.
 No.
 So here's an advantage of starting doing our podcast on a Friday.
 Yeah.
 We're done our weekly catch up because the whole weekend hasn't happened yet,
 which is like, we're anything that would be interesting might happen.
 Well, should we be prophetic about what the weekend is going to be like?
 Well, riddle me this.
 Are you excited about the eclipse?
 I don't know.
 I am because it's a rarity.
 I'm just, I wish I had my plan.
 I don't have my plan together yet about where we're going to go and all that kind of stuff.
 And I think once I have the plan, I'll be more excited.
 Broken like a true shaper.
 Thank you.
 Hey, we read it our life languages.
 We did.
 Let's talk about that.
 OK, I'm loading up my profile.
 OK.
 So if you remember, we talked about Life Languages a while ago, we had Alison Hendricks and our
 Life Languages expert on for a couple of weeks in a room, we interviewed her. I'll put links and
 show notes if you have no idea what we're talking about. But basically, the Life Language Profile
 is a communication tool where you basically fill in a 15 to 20 minute long questionnaire online,
 and then it sends you a report saying, "Hey, these are the strengths or the weaknesses
 of your communication style. And it's one of the most effective tools that we've ever used to help
 us understand ourselves and other people. And for those of you who understand life languages,
 now we should get Mike and Phyllis back to reassess us from our marriage.
 So our life languages were almost practically identical. But now...
 They were. They were in the exact same order, but just different numbers.
 No, we had one that was flipped.
 Well, the top three were the same order.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. So I am now a first language
 contemplator, shaper, producer, doer,
 mover, influencer and responder.
 And how low is your responder?
 So my responder has come up.
 I was a measly 12%.
 My responder was lying in the ditch somewhere,
 but apparently I've given it CPR and it's come up 20%.
 I'm now 32%.
 Well, look at you.
 I know. Have you noticed I'm cuddlier?
 I definitely, definitely.
 More loving, more caring.
 I have, actually.
 Yeah. There you go.
 There you go. The proof is in the pudding.
 I am still a high shaper, but I'm not in the 90s anymore.
 Your intensities come down?
 Yes. So I'm only about an 83 shaper.
 Oh. So still high, but you're not as like not, you know, 90.
 So first language is shaper and then come to the rest.
 And then doer influencer responder, mover, producer, and my
 contemplator is coming in last.
 It was second the last time I tested.
 So that should be interesting because now I'm a first language
 contemplate and you're a last language
 commentator.
 Yeah.
 I it was funny because I did the test and sweet Allison is a way on vacation.
 And so I didn't expect to hear from her, but I guess it must email her if
 somebody takes a test.
 And so she texted me from some park somewhere in the north of the USA, uh,
 saying, uh, your contemplator died.
 And I was like, I know I don't know what happened.
 And she said she thinks it's just in a season that I'm in a season where I've had to do a lot of doing and shaping and haven't had a lot of time to sit and think.
 Well, that's true because if you think about our new role at Grace Center, it's all been due due due.
 It's all been due.
 And I haven't had time to sit and think.
 And I'm not actually doing much of the doing.
 I'm doing a lot of the strategizing, which makes sense.
 You're doing more thinking.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And I'm doing more doing and stuff.
 So there you go.
 If you haven't done your life languages and haven't clue what we're talking about, look at the show notes.
 There's links to a couple of episodes.
 Highly worth it.
 I'd really encourage you to do that.
 Yeah.
 It's super fun.
 Okay, so our main topic for the podcast today is reducing stress.
 That sounds stressful.
 I know, right?
 Well, let's not be stressed while we're discussing reducing stress.
 Well, what I like about this and what we try to do on the podcast is not give you textbook
 answers.
 These are answers born out of our experiences of enduring seasons of considerable stress.
 If we have any answers, well, we have five because I can see them in the written down.
 Well, yes, I know.
 I mean, there's probably even more answers,
 generally speaking, out there in the world.
  </li><li>Undoubtedly.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The professionals that build their whole life
 around reducing stress.
  </li><li>It's true.
  </li><li>We're just amateurs.
  </li><li>Well, do you want me to define stress for you?
  </li><li>Would you?
  </li><li>Yeah, stress is defined as a state of mental
 or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse
 or very demanding circumstances.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>It's worth pointing out that the episode
 is called reducing stress, not avoiding stress.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because some good things do come from short periods of stress.
  </li><li>It's true, you grow.
  </li><li>Yeah, your character is refined.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And actually, stress in its best sense
 does produce stuff in you to help.
 It's a bit like adrenaline.
 If you're constantly a high state of adrenaline,
 flooding your system, that's not good.
 If you're being chased by a bear,
 a shot of adrenaline is really, really helpful.
  </li><li>Really necessary, yeah.
  </li><li>I think stress is a bit like that.
 though I did read an article on bears and apparently they don't chase you all that often.
 So maybe you'd be okay. Sorry.
 I just feel like I wouldn't take that out of my sales.
 I'm sorry. Back to the chasing bear. Yes. Adrenaline. Good.
 Okay. I'm going to store up some piece of information that I can use to deflate the
 next example. You just watch. Okay. That's what it's going to be. Fantastic. Go for it.
 So if we're talking about reducing stress and we look at your definition, tell me your
 definition again.
 It's a state of mental or emotional strain or tension resulting from adverse or very
 demanding circumstances.
 So parenthood.
 Sorry.
 Well, if you're going to reduce stress then, you either have to change the circumstances
 that are producing the stress or change ourselves so that those circumstances don't work on us
 anymore. Or third, we just ask God for grace to endure it. I mean, maybe we ask God for grace
 no matter what. And then sure, yeah, sure. We're talking before and we've got five strategies
 that we've employed in our life to help reduce stress. Yes. And it's worth noting that there are
 some severe situations around the world that cause significant stress. I'm not sure these are going
 going to work for that. I'm aware that the greatest measures of stress that we've ever
 faced are still first world problems in all reality. But with that in mind, I'd imagine
 most of our podcast listeners are first world listeners. So hopefully you will find some
 measure. The very first one on our list is something that you taught me early on in
 our marriage, which let's talk about it. Sure. It's the whole thing of stop borrowing
 trouble. I never understood this concept until one day we were driving along and I was sharing
 what's on my heart and you said, babe, it feels like you're borrowing an awful lot of trouble.
 And I was like, I do not know what you speak of.
 So can you explain it to us like we're five girls?
 Yeah.
 So it's like when you kind of let your mind get away with you and maybe you have a conversation
 or you hear about a circumstance and then you start to think about all the things that
 could be going on in the background.
 You don't know if they're happening or not.
 You start to sort of emotionally spiral out of control to the worst case scenario scenarios
 happening.
 Because scenario scenarios.
 And to be fair, the reason that was such a shock to me to who you say is probably I
 was raised in a culture or a climate where we borrow trouble all the time.
 And for me, that was just a normal way of life.
 And I didn't realize there was another way of living.
 Right.
 As in, we had more faith in bad things happening than we did in good things happening.
 Right.
 whatever you're start to not feel well and instead of thinking, "Oh, it's probably a bug that's going around.
 You're thinking, "I've got cancer. This is it. I'm going to die."
 Everything goes to the nth degree.
 For real. I have a friend who periodically is convinced they have cancer.
 I say, "Well, if you're concerned about that, my suggestion is to start looking at WebMD
 and actually make an appointment with a doctor who could actually eradicate that."
 that and they refuse to do that because they're worried that if they do, they'll confirm that
 it's cancer.
 Right.
 And I'm like, but they're already eating the fruit of thinking it's cancer.
 Right.
 Wouldn't you like to know?
 I mean, if if it is, wouldn't you like to know about it so that you could do something
 about it?
 And if it isn't, think of the piece that that would bring you and PS is most likely
 not, right?
 You will never know because you're left in this downward spiral of despair.
 Right.
 It's always dangerous to fill in the gaps where we don't have information.
 Like that's always going to add worry, whether it's relational conversations or
 work situations or health things.
 Don't try and fill in the gap when you don't actually have the information.
 &gt;&gt; Well, it's also ties in with Bill Johnson's brilliant saying of where our
 dumbest one we think we know the motives of another person's heart.
 &gt;&gt; Right.
 &gt;&gt; So like, do you borrow trouble when your boss sends your email and
 says, I need to speak to you on Monday.
 &gt;&gt; Right.
 Are we like, okay, I'm probably fired.
  </li><li>Yeah, you spend the whole weekend worrying.
  </li><li>Right, it's crazy, isn't it?
 So you really helped me with that.
 Would you say, this is interesting,
 I'll put you on the spot on here.
  </li><li>Okay, thanks.
  </li><li>Would you say that you've noticed a difference
 from when you first told me about not borrowing trouble?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That is the correct answer.
  </li><li>I would say that.
 I would say sometimes I stuff to remind you,
 but with smaller circumstances.
  </li><li>I'm sorry folks, we're having technical difficulties.
 We can't hear a G.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Did you like my aesthetic noise?
  </li><li>Yeah, that was a thing of beauty.
  </li><li>Thanks, I'm pretty sure my pop filter
 is now covered in spit.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>All right, number two.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This is an important one that we learn.
 Again, we learn this from drowning in stress.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And if we hadn't gone through that season,
 we wouldn't have learned this.
 Number two.
 Number two is be proactive.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 that the worst season of our life and marriage was the season when we were
 absolutely crippled in debt. It's not the worst season of my life but of our
 married life? Sure. It's kind of a cakewalk actually, not just kidding.
 No, it was.
 Thank you. But yes, it was a very tough season.
 I forgot all about your early childhood.
 -That whole thing, yeah.
 -Yeah, yeah.
 Of course, I only think about our life as our married life, though.
 -Oh, see, isn't that lovely?
 -What happened was we moved to America at the tail end of 2008.
 -Yes.
 -And the world was pretty much going through a financial collapse.
 Certainly America was.
 -Yeah, going into a recession of some sort.
 -We didn't know anything about Dave Ramsey.
 -No.
 -We didn't know how expensive it was going to be to move nations.
 We incurred an awful lot of moving costs.
 -Yes.
 -And we also didn't know what it was going to be like living
 in America without, I mean, our social security numbers were like two weeks old.
 Yeah.
 So what we didn't realize is when you get here, everything's done from your social
 security number, like try and get cell phone service or utilities or gas or water.
 And anyway, in the process of moving, we, we incurred a huge amount of debt when we got here.
 And we'd never done Dave Rhett.
 We didn't know what we were doing.
 We, I mean, I remember we had a least car in Canada.
 Yes.
 And then we had to return it early to move to Nashville.
 So we had all these panels.
  </li><li>That was expensive.
  </li><li>And then setting up a new life and new house.
 Anyway, we are just crippled in debt
 and before we know it, we have debt collectors calling.
 And I don't know if I face a stress
 worse than financial stress.
  </li><li>It was horrible.
  </li><li>The stress that comes.
 But here's what happened is I just wanted to hide from that.
 Like maybe it will go away.
 But then we did Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University.
 We're big fans of Dave's.
 And his whole thing, I mean, he just arms you to the teeth
 with how to handle everything,
 to realize you've made mistakes and fix them.
 But one of the things that he taught that we found
 was you have to be proactive.
 Now, I'm not just talking here about financial stress.
 I'm talking about stress in general.
 Being proactive forces you to take responsibility.
 And when you take responsibility,
 you actually have a role in changing the climate
 that you're living in.
 I got very, very good at speaking to debt collectors.
 I got very, very good at being assertive.
 I got very, very good at setting some boundaries.
 And while the stress didn't go away,
 it actually gave me a sense of power in that,
 no, I can actually do something about this.
 I am not a victim to my circumstances.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And it's not really just in those kind of situations.
 Like it's not just with debt collectors, but--
  </li><li>No, not at all.
  </li><li>But if you can be proactive, you know, in relationship,
 if you realize, gosh, you know,
 my heart's actually really hurt by such and such a person
 or by this situation.
 If you can be proactive and go, instead of assuming that you know what's going on with
 the person, why don't you go ahead and have a discussion about that and, you know, what's
 going to be facetious and say be an adult?
 But you know, sometimes we're just not that good when our hearts are hurt about being
 proactive and trying to sort something out.
 And I get it because sometimes we'd rather settle for the amount of pain/stress we're
 in and we don't want to risk in case it makes it worse.
 Right.
 think I've ever experienced it getting worse by being proactive. Maybe short term, but
 longer term it has. I remember my first real job out of university, I want to work for
 a terrifying man, I mean an ogre of a man. And I thought I'm probably not going to survive
 without actually confronting this man. And so I gave it a couple of weeks, it was not
 getting any better. And I remember about maybe my fourth or fifth week in, I asked for a meeting
 with him. I mean, he, I mean, he just broke every HR rule under the sun. I first day of work,
 he told me he'd break my legs. If I had stuff spilling over from my desk onto his desk.
 Nice. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's not legal.
 And so I just, Annie berated me for being a Christian as well. I'm like,
 I think he also had somebody hit him at work. He drove them to such distraction. Anyway,
 He would just use fear, intimidation, shame, fear, control, all this sort of stuff.
 So, it was, you know, imposing character.
 But after about four or five weeks there, I asked for a meeting with him, and I sat down,
 and I wasn't trying to be rude.
 I wasn't trying to be boisterous.
 But I just said, "Hey, I would love to explain something that, you know, nine to five, when
 I'm here, you're going to get 100% from me."
 The way you interact with me seems to suggest that you think I'm a slacker, and, you know,
 really I'm not. But you also use a lot of language and conversations that is setting
 some expectations for me to be working like nonstop. And I don't know how to say this
 without coming across as rude, but this job for me on a scale of one to 10 is about, you
 know, one being the most important thing, 10 being the least important thing is about
 a seven. And so what I mean by that is I can get another job like if this job is not working
 few, I'm fine to go get another job.
 Like this is not what I see my career being.
 But when I am here, it's a number one on my priority, but I have no
 interest in working outside the hours that are being set for me.
 If there's a crisis, of course, I'm just talking long term.
 And that didn't drastically change his behavior, but it did change the
 way his behavior worked on me.
 It didn't have as much power because I'd been proactive.
 I'd gotten over the fear of actually confronting the man and I, you know,
 got to set some parameters and some boundaries. And so being proactive is huge. It also gets
 us out of a victim mindset.
 Yeah, I met with somebody a few weeks ago and just worked with them on a proactive approach
 to some things that they were facing. And, you know, this wouldn't have traditionally
 been how this person would have done life, you know, but just got to connect with them
 a few days ago. And they were like, it worked. And it was amazing. And you know, whatever,
 It's scary when you first start being proactive or assertive, but it's great.
 You can do it with kindness and you'll get great results.
 I think that's really important.
 I sometimes think about when we first moved here, we would have coffees with people who
 would say, "Well, I can't make my rent and I can't do whatever," but then they're quitting
 their jobs left, right and center, or they want to work part-time so they have time for
 coffee with their friends every day and that kind of stuff.
 And it's maybe it's this is a season to be proactive in a different way.
 And that is, you know, work hard and shift things for yourself.
 Well, I think the concept of being proactive actually gives you a voice.
 Yeah.
 Because a lot of the time we can think I'm trapped, I'm a victim, this life is hard.
 What was mean? There's nothing I can do about it.
 Right.
 And I don't think that's ever true.
 Right.
 And it forces you to take some level of responsibility.
 which is hard you know really is hard because when i'm speaking that to debt collectors it is my fault i did not manage my money well i was foolish i am now that now i owe you something i can repay right but realizing actually there is something i can do about it i don't have to do things on your terms i can actually.
 create new terms would you help me work together with you bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
 is still there.
 But sometimes it really isn't because sometimes the path to the problem not being there has
 presented itself just through having conversation.
 Well, and also sometimes the problem isn't the source of our stress.
 It's all the mental gymnastics that we do, you know, all the kind of boring trouble stuff,
 all the feeling like we're a victim.
 The more we think about it and on a healthy way increases the stress.
 Right.
 Talking about it is hugely helpful from that perspective.
 usually no two people have the exact same perspective. So having somebody else look at your problem
 that you're facing that seems insurmountable, they may have surmounted that problem before.
 And so even in sharing and talking about it, you can look at it together and go, "Oh,
 okay, well actually that big thing just became a much smaller thing." And then it becomes a
 manageable thing. I remember one of the first people we talked about our season of financial
 stress was Jeff, our pastor, our boss, our leader, our good friend.
 And I didn't realize it, but the amount of effort we were putting in to keep up appearances
 and hold everything together was taken an enormous toll on us.
 And speaking to Jeff didn't solve the problem.
 He didn't suddenly write us a check and all our finances went away.
 But that whole thing of needing to pretend there isn't a problem just vanished.
 something powerful when you tell another human being and let them in on your heart,
 you just humbled yourself. When you display weakness and God loves to give grace to the humble.
 I think also knowing that there's other people praying for you because you were brave enough to
 share it actually means there's now supernatural shift that can happen. So it's like actually,
 we're not doing ourselves any favors by hiding. So find a counselor, a good friend, a pastor,
 Someone wiser than you and actually share what's going on. Yeah. All right. Number four is kind of an extension of number three. Yeah, kind of gives a bit of overlap there, but it's the whole thing of the power of community.
 It's unlikely, like you said, that you are going through something right now that other people haven't faced before, but the age old lie of the enemy is no, it's just you.
 just you that hasn't managed your marriage. Well, it's just you that's a terrible parent. It's just you that has an addiction. It's just you that
 has screwed up spectacular. You know, and on and on and on.
 Yeah.
 And when we, like I said, when we told other people about our finances, when we told Jeff, we told other people and kind of let them in,
 the power of other people just, what's the word call it? We call it sinking, synchronizing with you. What's it called? It's when people
 Yeah, they just meet you.
 And acknowledge your pain.
 It's huge when people are like, that must be really, really hard.
 Yeah.
 Cause then you can start to even process it with the Lord too.
 Like I, I find usually in seasons of stress, we're really not processing very
 well with the Lord.
 We're as much as we're hiding from other people.
 We're usually hiding from him thinking he's upset with us and we have
 shame from that too, where if actually you're able to talk about it, you're
 much more likely to also process with the Lord.
 And more than likely the people that you're talking to have the same
 problem, right? Or have had it. Yeah. So the shock to us was being around people that we now know are very financially secure, very wealthy, very stable people.
 And when we'd begin to open up and tell them, we were just thrilled to hear that they were like, yeah, we remember that.
 Oh, we remember losing everything. And we're like, what? But you guys look so stable. You guys look like you have everything together.
 Like, oh, let us tell you, like we paid the price. Right. And I was like, oh, this is amazing.
 And it gives you faith for something that you can't even imagine yet.
 Right.
 So you're looking at breakthrough.
 Yeah, marriages.
 How many times have we had people come to us with kind of like shame, I guess,
 but with a sigh like, okay, this is what's going on in marriage.
 And we get to go, oh, yeah, we did that too.
 And people are like, really?
 Yeah.
 You guys have such great amazing marriage.
 And we're like, yeah, but it didn't arrive overnight.
 Right.
 We just persevered and not killing one another and getting help.
 Well, God refined us. Right. Yeah.
 Well, it's like what you were talking about. The prayers of other people. Yeah.
 It's not that when we're in a situation that our prayers aren't very helpful.
 It's just that they lack faith. Right. Because when you're in a pit, yeah, you know,
 you have faith for the pit. You don't have faith for getting out of the pit. Right. Where
 when there's people standing around you above, you know, ground, their horizon is very different
 from yours. And they've got more faith because they've actually
 seen God do it before. So that's super powerful. Yeah. All right,
 baby, number five, take us home.
 The last one is just, this is just a purely kind of practical one.
 Reduce your responsibility. So that just sort of means like automate
 anything that you can in your life that would potentially add to your
 stress.
 And why is that a big deal?
 Well, because actually the part of your brain that responds to making decisions responds
 the same way, whether it's a small decision or a big decision.
 That's some of the most fascinating research I've read.
 I remember reading an article in the Harvard Business Review a number of years ago that
 said exactly what you just said there.
 And then I remember reading an interview with President Obama and the interviewer, you know,
 I followed him around for six months, he was doing a piece, I forget what it was for,
 you know, one of the big news news week or something like that.
 And he said, "I'm going to be the American president tomorrow.
 What do I need to know?"
 And President Obama said, "You need to reduce all your decision-making faculties."
 And he's like, "What do you mean?"
 He said, "Well, you'll notice I only wear two types of suit.
 I don't have to pick what I'm going to wear."
 He said, "I have other people pick my food, other people plan my schedule.
 I don't concern myself with those things so that my brain is free for bigger things."
 Right.
 So I'm going to start picking your outfits in the morning?
 Well, we've already done a pretty good job of automating as much as we possibly can.
 We do stuff like we use Amazon for stuff that we know that we need every month, so I don't
 have to think about going and getting it.
 It just arrives at our door every month.
 What's that called?
 Amazon Subscribing Safe.
 Subscribing Safe, yeah.
 So we basically just sit down one evening, load it up with everything we know we need
 on a regular basis.
 Yep.
 And then never ever run out of toilet paper or kitchen.
 What do you call it?
 Paper towel.
 Yeah, paper towel.
 And then depending on the kinds of things that we're eating at the moment, some things
 I mean, you can tell it when you want delivered once every three months, once every two months,
 once every month. So obviously toilet paper is a once a month thing,
 but cash units might be once every three months or whatever. But that is done. I don't have to
 think about that. I don't have to go find it. It's just a done thing.
 Same with like automating bills. I don't have to remember to pay our mortgage or medical bills
 or whatever. It's just all automated. I just said it once. I forget about it. It is less things
 cluttering my head. It's the reason we eat at the same restaurants over and over again.
 And typically we eat one or two of the exact same meals. Just, I don't have to think about it.
 It's funny because I had some people comment on the fact that I had asked about places to eat in
 redding a week before. And I thought, I don't want to have to worry about it when I'm there. I want
 to go online this week while I'm, you know, whatever, watching TV or whatever. Look at the menus,
 decide if I can go there, blah, blah, and have a plan in place so that there's no stress
 for me when I'm there.
 But that's sort of how we do things anyways, isn't it?
 A little bit.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That's your shaper language.
 It is.
 Loving a plan.
 There you go.
 So I hope as you're listening to this, you're not in a overwhelming state of stress.
 But if you are, there's five things we hope you find helpful.
 Number one, stop borrowing trouble.
 Number two, be proactive.
 Remember you're not a victim.
 Number three, talk to others about it.
 four, share with your community, which is kind of the same as number three, but at a different
 focus. And number five, reduce your responsibilities, try and automate as much as you can so that
 you have resources left to make decisions about the things that are important and not
 just the things that you actually have to think about. Yeah.
 Babe, do we have any listeners questions? We do. We have one. So this one's from Rebecca.
 And her question is, I've been listening to the five-fold ministry sermons. And I'm curious
 about where I fall into this.
 So she's talking about the sermons
 that you had done at Gray Center
 for three Sunday mornings.
 So she says she's curious about where she falls into this.
 Does every person fit into one of the five categories?
 Or is there a, in quotation marks, peanut gallery of sorts
 for people who would categorize themselves as disciples
 without a powerful anointing of a specific gift?
  </li><li>That's such a great question, Rebecca.
 You're asking a couple of questions there.
 Let me try and take them one by one.
 So you're asking, I'm curious about where I fall into this.
 So for those of you who listen to the series,
 I've basically been talking about five gifts
 that Jesus Christ gives to his church,
 the gift of apostle, prophet, pastor, teacher, and evangelist.
 And your question is, where do I fall into this?
 That's a question that everybody asks, like,
 "I wonder what am I?"
 And my encouragement to you on that
 is the way you work out what you are is
 you let other people tell you
 from the fruit that you've produced in your life.
 And along with that, you'll find that confirmed by God,
 confirmed by your local church, et cetera, et cetera.
 But here's the other thing is in 1 Corinthians 12,
 verse 29 Paul says, are all apostles, are all prophets,
 are all teachers, do all work miracles.
 He goes on kind of asking rhetorically.
 And the question there is answered by no, no,
 not everybody is an apostle, not everybody's a prophet,
 not everybody's a teacher.
 It's quite likely that you could go through your whole life
 and that's not your strongest gift set
 because elsewhere in scripture,
 he talks about first apostle, second prophets, third teachers,
 and then goes on and on and on with a list of other things
 about helps, administrations, all that sort of stuff.
 So there are a ton of gifts of the Holy Spirit to you.
 This passage is talking about gifts of Christ of the church.
 So I don't think everybody has to be one of those things.
 Plus I think elsewhere when Paul writes
 about the body being multi-faceted,
 there's eyes and ears and hands
 and all these different parts of the body.
 I think we can be all things.
 I don't know the term peanut gallery.
 I don't know what that means
 or if there's connotations to that.
 I would hate people to go away with a revelation thinking
 that because they're not an apostle,
 a prophet, a pastor, a teacher or an evangelist,
 that somehow they're less than.
 That's not how the kingdom is organized at all.
 I think whenever you're walking in the identity that God's given you, exercising the gifts,
 the Holy Spirit has given you, you're producing incredible fruit for the kingdom.
 So I know for example, I have a friend, she's neither an apostle or a prophet or any of those
 things, but she has without a doubt the gift of hospitality.
 And when you stay in her house, you touch heaven, you feel like a king, you feel your
 loved tremendously.
 I wonder if the gifts are the way you express love to the body.
 That's good, babe.
 That's good.
 And then I think those five, you know, I talked about this a little bit.
 There's the big difference between a prophet and somebody who prophesies.
 I somebody who's the has the gift of the office of the prophet and somebody has
 a gift of prophecy is that the prophet raises other prophets.
 Right.
 But either of them can prophesize well as one another.
 Right. And sometimes actually somebody with a gift of prophecy can prophesy better
 than somebody with the office of the prophet because that's not the role.
 So I think yes, by its nature, not everybody's an apostle, not everybody's a prophet,
 and everybody's a teacher and so on and so forth.
 But yes, I also think we all have gifts that God has given us.
 And part of the gifts that we have is ourselves.
 Like you, Rebecca, are a gift to your community without you even having any of those other gifts,
 which I'm sure you do.
 That's right.
 Right. You are the only Rebecca that the people in your community have.
 And so the sooner you come to peace with others is who I am.
 This is how I'm wired.
 This is what God's built me.
 Everybody benefits from that.
 Right.
 I hope that made sense.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Let's land this play.
 And you're ready.
 Yeah.
 Our podcast now has chapters last week.
 We introduced the concept of chapters.
 Now all that means is do you remember CDs?
 Yes.
 Remember you put a CD in your car and you're listening to an album and you
 like the first two songs, but you want to skip the third song.
 You just reach out and press the skip track button.
 Yeah.
 And it would skip to the next track.
 Yeah.
 That's pretty much what chapters are for podcasts.
 Yeah.
 So that's amazing.
 What that means is you can very easily find your favorite parts of an episode
 that you were listening to and or you can skip the bits you don't care about.
 So if you're listening to a business question, you're like, I don't care
 about the answer that you can skip on or whatever.
 The issue is you need a better podcast player than the one that comes standard
 with your iPhone.
 Oh, really?
 Yeah, because Apple's podcast player, while it's great in that it's installed on every iPad,
 every iPhone, and you don't need to do anything.
 That's my purple one, is it?
 That's your purple one.
 Okay.
 It doesn't, for whatever reason, support chapters.
 Bummer.
 So you will not see that.
 You're like, "Hey, you said your chapters, but you sit in a throne of lies."
 It's not that you need a better podcast player.
 Okay.
 The one that we recommend is overcast.
 It's completely free.
 And by we you mean you because I'm about to download overcast right now.
 At a girl.
 It's going to be fun.
 The one that I recommend is overcast.
 It's got a ton of great features in it.
 It's free.
 But the one that you're going to like is that it has chapter markers.
 I'll put a link in the show notes to overcast in the app store.
 You can download it and use that as your podcast player.
 If you've got a question that you would like us to ask, Rebecca,
 last week sent in a question via allen and ag.com/ask.
 You can too. If you have a burning question, you'd like us to try and answer on air. We'd be happy to do that.
 Just visit the URL, <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask.
 And if you would like the show notes for today's show, go ahead and head over to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/161.
 I just realized something that we said we were going to do last week that we completely forgot about and haven't done for this week.
 Well, what?
 Our listener survey.
 Oh, no. What are we going to do?
 I'm going to go back in time and create one it's Friday babe that's the advantage of recording on a Friday.
 Hey guys remember last week we said we're gonna have a listener survey well it's going to be up yay time that you listen to this.
 Follow us on social media at allen and a j that is a l y n a n d a j and we will post instructions on how to give us your feedback and what the fabulous prices.
