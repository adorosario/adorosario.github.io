<p> I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Episode 278 of Keeping Up With Joneses.
 Look at us.<br/>
 You are looking mighty fine this evening.
 Thank you.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Just chilling out with your feet up.<br/>
 Tilling.<br/>
 Like nothing could be wrong.<br/>
 On the recliner.<br/>
 Like our air conditioning has not gone out.
 It's been quite the week.<br/>
 We're not in a hot box where I may pass out.
 Yeah. Well, that air conditioner doesn't owe this house one red set.
 No, it doesn't. Yeah.<br/>
 I would like it to keep working though.
 I do. If we're going to be, if we're going to be picky, it is currently 79 degrees Fahrenheit
 inside our house, inside our house, which is a balmy 26 degree centigrade.
 But at least the upstairs air conditioner is still working.
 And that's where I will be sleeping tonight.
 Yeah, I'm still going to sleep downstairs.
 I'll be fine.<br/>
 Because this is like a perfect temperature for you.
 I'm quite like, I'm like, I'm great, I'm comfortable.
</p><ul>
  <li>And you're not bummed at all that I can't make it colder.
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>I came home this afternoon, I had a meeting after church,
 so I came home, I walk into the house
 and I instantly start sweating
 'cause it's so hot in the house.
 And I look over at AJ, who is wearing a sweater
 and is under a blanket like on the sofa.
 I mean, it's muggy, like it's hot and it's sticky.
  </li><li>It wasn't, it was pretty.
  </li><li>And I was like, babe, it's roasting in here.
 And you're like, I'm a bit chilly.
 And I go over to thermostat and in the hallway,
 it was at 76, even though it's set to 68.
  </li><li>Yeah, I probably took my sweater off about 10 minutes ago.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah.
  </li><li>Well, you finally warmed up.
  </li><li>No, 79 warm.
  </li><li>Give the people a weekly update.
  </li><li>A weekly update.
 Well, thankfully we didn't go to the hospital this week,
 so that's wonderful.
  </li><li>No ER visits, that's a win.
  </li><li>No ER visits.
 We did.
 You called me from the side of the road
 and then said, "Can you FaceTime?"
 Can you FaceTime?
 And I was like, "Yeah?"
 It's a FaceTime and all you did was show me
 our smoking minivan.
  </li><li>That looked like it was on fire, right?
  </li><li>I know.
 And this is more than you understand,
 it's not smoking as in sleek
 and it's not on fire as in fast.
 It's literally smoking.
 (laughs)
 And I wasn't sure if it was smoking
 because it was on fire, which I don't think it was.
 But basically I'm driving out to see my friend Bill. I'm on the highway. I've got the cruise control set to 72 miles an hour
 And as I look at my speedometer well two things strike my attention
 I look at the kind of engine, you know the little thing that goes hot or cold and it's right down at cold and I was like
 That's curious because it's normal in the middle
 But I guess cold's better than hot and then all of a sudden my speedometer starts going
 And I was like, why is it going down?
 So I put my foot on the accelerator and nothing happens.
  </li><li>But you managed to get off the highway.
  </li><li>Oh, well, I did a quick look in the rear view mirror
 to see what might be happening.
 And all I can see is smoke.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm like, is that me?
 And so I'm right at the exit that I get off anyway.
 And so I pull off the exit and then the engine just stops.
 Just the car cuts out completely.
 All the lights on the dashboard start flashing.
 like I'm a disco. And I guess the power steering goes out because I can't turn the car. The brakes
 work thankfully. So I throw all of my weight into making the car stop. Yeah. And white billowing
 smoke is coming out not from behind me, but actually from the hood. And in fairness, it also
 doesn't always anything. Actually, if you do the math on this bad boy, the air conditioning unit
 and the minivan or both 18 years old.
 Is that right?
 Well, our house was built in 2006, so it's now 2022.
 Oh, no, 16.
 Sorry.
 And our minivan is a deluxe 2005,
 and it's now 2022.
 What's on that?
 Well, because it gets released a year before there.
 It's 18 years.
 And it has like 230,000 miles on it.
 Oh, it's got more than that on it.
 No, I checked because I was like--
 Miles, not clummers.
 "Okay, I'm with you."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It owes us nothing.
  </li><li>It owes us nothing, sweet vehicle.
 So anyway, I didn't know what to do because, you know,
 it's not a computer.
 I was like, "How do you reboot a,
 "no, I don't think it's gonna work."
 So I called my friend Bill who knows pretty much everything
 and he came and he just, he said,
 "Let's go and get some--
  </li><li>Radiator fluid.
  </li><li>Radiator fluid.
 And we poured it into the radiator
 and it just poured straight through the radiator
 and onto the ground.
  </li><li>Well, the cap was also missing,
 which is suspicious like it blown off the thing.
 That's always a good side.
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
 So it's being towed to a mechanics.
 We'll find out this week.
 If it's completely dead or just needs a new radiator.
 Well, it could need a lot more than a new radiator.
 Well, the truth is, how long you drove with it,
 smoking out the back.
 Even when it was working, it had no air conditioning,
 which when they come into summer in Tennessee is not fun.
 And the side doors didn't work on it.
 They were in the new headlight.
 And I needed time about so
 Let's say
 The day before I was driving and I felt the Holy Spirit said to me son you really need a new car and
 I you know, I don't know where that was coming from. I don't know well
 It's probably like the Holy Spirit saying you actually need to do something because yeah, I started to Jeff about this today
 there's
 In my life
 things i care about i really care about things i don't care about i really don't care about and so,
 you know i'm i'm a friend from the airport and he had like an iphone for us and i just had connections thinking how are you coping below the iphone poverty in the line he just didn't care he doesn't care about you do i care but i don't really care about cars unless it's a test but i care about you too and yeah so that was probably a word from the lord.
 To me for you.
 Thank you.
 Anyway, that was fun.
 Yes.
 Our friend David Campbell was with us.
 Yeah.
 We had him for nearly a week.
 It was very fun.
 It's such a joy to be with.
 If you missed last week's episode with David Campbell,
 encourage you to go back to it.
 Alanagia.com/277.
 Just listen to that man's spite wisdom was beautiful.
 A family news?
 Do we have family news?
 Oh, your 15-year-old is going to be thrilled to hear that.
 Oh, that family news.
 I have a 15-year-old.
 That's right.
 Yeah.
 It's really weird as a parent when you're 15 year old starts planning on parties.
 She planned everything texted everyone is quite refreshing drove her places dry she made her own cake.
 So just drove her places dropped her off she do little.
 You know parties with her friends we were crushing it we still have done a family.
 I know i wonder if she's even interested.
 Are family tradition is we'll go as a family usually to the cheesecake factory but now that they're getting older they get to pick wherever they'd like to go.
 And we all have a celebratory dinner but she hasn't made mention that she would like to do that i'm sure that when she remembers that we haven't done she's gonna want to do it so we should probably bring it up first cuz that like.
 That's just better scenario we should probably do it because we want to celebrate her.
 not to be coming parents.
 -Well, we want to also be cutting parents.
 Don't we?
 Or clever parents?
 Maybe not cutting.
 I realize my nose is stuffed.
 -We should absolutely talk about the pollen levels.
 -Pallen level.
 -I don't know what app Jeff is looking at, but he's like,
 "Yeah, the pollen's out of red today."
 And I was like, "What does that mean?"
 He's like, "It's the worst."
 -You don't need an app.
 You just listen to my nose.
 -Yeah.
 But we're all the Joneses, all our stuffy.
 I went three days without being able to breathe out my left nostril day or night.
 It was just like, oh, I was just clogged all time.
 It was just not fun.
 Which is why you're sleeping in a different room for me.
 This is exactly why, because three of those nights I was so restless.
 It just did not work.
 Our main topic this week is called cheating.
 Oh, cheating.
 Very bad.
 We're not supposed to cheat.
 Not that we're doing a podcast on the topic of cheating, but you spoke at
 church this morning.
 I did.
  </li><li>And you did a fabulous job.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>I had tremendous joy watching you.
 What did you say about watching me watch you this morning?
  </li><li>I thought you were bored.
 Is that what you mean?
  </li><li>To be fair, I do have a resting board face.
  </li><li>You do.
 Every time I looked over at you, it was like, well, sorry.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>No.
 What was happening?
  </li><li>If you're happy to be in the room, tell your face.
  </li><li>I was actually trying to sleep
 because I just served in children's ministry.
  </li><li>That's not at all offensive.
  </li><li>No, but what happened is I'd served in children's ministry
 that morning.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then I knew I had a new members event,
 you know, after church.
  </li><li>And so you did a nap in between?
  </li><li>Well, I knew that I'd expanded a lot of my energy,
 you know, introverts of the world, you know,
 I spent a lot of energy being with the kids
 and being in class.
 And then I knew I was gonna have to have lots of energy
 to be social.
  </li><li>So you thought the best time to nap
 was while your wife was speaking.
 Right, because A, you know me, B, you could probably guess
 that's what's going on.
 No, I did that.
 I thought I was like, is he mad?
 Is he bored?
 What is that face?
 Well, and I thought if you did think those things
 I could clean them up later on a podcast.
 I wasn't mad, I wasn't bored.
 I was just dog tired.
 You were just snoozing.
 But I liked your message so much.
 I thought that we could talk about it.
 We could deconstruct on the podcast.
 You were teaching all about baptism.
 Yes.
 So tell us what do we need to know about baptism?
  </li><li>Well, what do we need to know about baptism?
 Probably a lot.
 Baptism is amazing.
 It's whenever people got saved in the Bible,
 like in the New Testament,
 that was the very first thing that they did
 after they, you know, acknowledged Jesus
 and then they went and got baptized.
 It was like the thing to do.
 And it was, it's sort of the equivalent of,
 it, well, what it is, is a public declaration
 of who you belong to. So it's like putting on the team jersey after you, you know, switch
 to who sports analogy, how after a pole really not going to work for either of us, I suppose.
 It is. And you know, that's what I've been taught my whole life. But I wonder what I
 wonder if there is a spiritual component to baptism. Oh, for sure. There's a huge spiritual
 exchange that takes place.
 Well, the spiritual exchange that takes place takes place at salvation.
 Yes.
 And the baptism is a display that you've done that.
 Yes.
 And I'm wondering if there's something spiritually significant about that.
 Well, there's a couple of passages that says they were baptized and received the Holy Spirit.
 Yes.
 So we receive things in baptism.
 There's a couple of passages that talk about how when we're baptized we're then clothed
 in Christ.
 I remember hearing Derek Prince, this is going to be controversial because I can't back up.
 But Derek Prince said on scripture alone, he can't guarantee that you're going to go to heaven
 unless you've believed and been baptized. And he said, yes, I know that we have the thief on the
 cross, but from the teaching of the New Testament, that's what he said. Now, if I was going to be a
 proper teacher, I would go look up the verse that he was talking about, or indeed the message
 to these book. But I remember being struck because Derek was so solid on the word. And
 I was like, wow, for him to come to that conclusion. I never are that conclusion. Anyway, don't
 scare everybody. Go ye therefore make disciples of all people baptizing them in the name of the
 Father, Son, the Holy Spirit. I mean, it's the thing to do, lead them to the Lord and get them
 baptized, dunk them. So that makes me so curious. What is the, I mean, it's you're right. It's the
 thing that Jesus asked us to do. That's what he said, you know, not just get people saved,
 but disciple them and baptize them. And I'm like, wow. There's so much stuff that as I grow older,
 I realize how much I have taken for granted. I know this is going to be ridiculous,
 but when we talk to the kids about Easter, I mean, never, of course, I knew what Easter was,
 but I never knew what good Friday was and I never knew what resurrection Sunday was and I never knew the timeline
 Even though I've spent my whole life in church. Okay Thursday and sad Saturday
 We have a whole week
 But the same with baptism like I you know
 It's the elementary things. Let us leave the elementary things where it talks about baptism's plural, but sorry I interrupted
 So it's the first thing that Christians should do. Yeah
 And it seems to be, it seemed to be like the natural cry of one's heart after they gave
 their lives to the Lord, if that makes sense.
 So you think about, you know, when Lydia got saved, it was her and her household got saved,
 got baptized, right?
 And then Cornelius, who is in Acts, I want to say around 16-ish.
 When he gets baptized, when he gets saved, the very first thing he does is he and that
 whole group of men go and get baptized and they become the first Gentile believers.
 My favorite story that I was reading to everybody this morning is actually, I think it's a little
 later in Acts where, you know, Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch...
 Yeah, tell us that story, babe.
 So Philip in the Ethiopian eunuch, the Holy Spirit says to Philip, "Hey, go onto this road."
 And it's the road that's from Jerusalem to Gaza.
 So he goes to this road and he sees the Ethiopian eunuch who is like the treasure for the queen
 of Ethiopia.
 And he's sitting in a chariot and he's reading something.
 And the Holy Spirit says, "Go up and talk to him."
 So he goes up and the Ethiopian eunuch is reading Isaiah.
 I think it's actually Isaiah 53, but it's out of Isaiah.
 And he says to him, "Hey, do you know what you're reading?"
 And he says, "Well, how can I possibly know
 "without somebody telling me?"
 And then he tells him all about Jesus.
 And the Ethiopian eunuch, upon hearing about Jesus,
 gives his life to Jesus.
 And as they're going along in the chariot, says,
 Look, water, is there any reason I couldn't be baptized right now?
 And these two dusty hairy men get out of this chariot and they go and get into
 this water and they're baptized.
 And the reason it's important to remember that they're dusty and hairy,
 because well, I guess I'm just assuming all better hairy is it's on a desert
 road.
 So the water that they saw was most likely some family's drinking water.
 Right.
 But his response to the Lord was so significant that he now felt like I need to be baptized now.
 And it was appropriate, apparently.
 You know, this is so important.
 We're actually going to get in this family's drinking water and do this baptism right now.
 And then of course, Philip disappears, which is kind of cool because it says the Ethiopian, the Ethiopian,
 Munich just sort of goes, huh, and goes away rejoicing.
  </li><li>I mean, it's an amazing passage for so many reasons.
 The one that really struck me that I had never seen,
 of course I'd read, but it didn't impact me
 the way ever until you shared it.
 This morning was Saul and his conversion,
 his Damascus road experience.
 Share that one.
  </li><li>Well, okay, so that's, you know,
 I should have brought my laptop in
 so I could have looked at all the references,
 But so Saul, of course, after he's blinded on the road,
 he goes to, you know, Ananias comes and finds him, right?
 And says, "Hey, I'm Ananias, the Lord told me to come find you."
 He prays for him the scales fall off of his eyes.
 And he gives his life to the Lord.
 I suppose he's already given his life to the Lord
 at some point in there.
 But as soon as the scales fall off his eyes,
 it says he was baptized and then he went in eight dinner.
 And he'd been fasting three days.
  </li><li>Yeah, so here's this guy who's super hungry,
 but it's more important that he gets baptized first,
 and then he goes neat.
 It's kinda cool, right?
  </li><li>Yeah, and at that point,
 there's no teaching on baptism, right?
 I mean, Jesus was baptized,
 and you shared some of the Jewish significance
 by him baptism, I'll get you to share in a second.
 But it's not like he knew to do that.
 Like, I think about the people I know who've got saved,
 and they have to learn things, you know, like, okay, how do I pray?
 Teach me how to pray.
 Okay, how do I read my Bible?
 Like, where do I start?
 It's like he automatically knew now I need to go get baptized.
  </li><li>It seems like most of them knew that.
 When you read those passages, that's their immediate response.
  </li><li>So talk to me about the Jewish baptism thing.
  </li><li>Right.
 Okay, so Jesus wasn't the first person to baptize people
 and neither was John the Baptist, right?
 So it's actually based on the Jewish tradition of mikvah.
 And mikvahs were basically public, well, public baths,
 some people would have had private baths as well,
 but single baths where you would walk in some stairs
 and you would sort of dunk yourself
 and then you'd walk back out
 and you needed to have a mikvah
 in order to go into the temple.
  </li><li>Okay.
 And it was a ceremony of just becoming clean so that you could go into the presence of God. You needed to be cleaned
 right, so
 That's actually where we get our tradition of baptism from
 is
 these mikvahs Wow and
 Actually when we were in Israel two years ago
 When when you and I were there with the kids they hadn't excavated
 What I saw when we were there two years ago, which was they found a bunch of the original
 Mikvas from about the second temple time period so
 They've unearth them and they still have water in them because they have natural
 like they have springs that keep them sort of the water moving and
 So yeah, and there was a whole bunch that was just really really cool
 So mikvat was something that you would do not only to go into the temple
 but you would also have a mikvah if there was a big life change coming like getting married or
 change of seasons or anything like that. And you would also have a mikvah like if you were woman
 at the end of your cycle that kind of thing. So it was really like something that marked
 a shift. Wow. Yeah. So it's kind of cool. And then I don't know whether I was taught this or not.
 So I don't, I was just thinking, I wonder if it's related to the one saved all the saves that I grew up with.
 But there was no concept for me growing up that you needed to be baptized more than once.
 Yeah.
 And you shared this morning about like being baptized multiple times.
 In fact, you've been baptized three times and not satisfied without your game, baptized a fourth time.
 I am.
 And I'm feeling kind of inadequate over here.
 We haven't been baptized once.
 Well, you can join me.
 Is it like silver, gold, platinum, status, membership?
 Yeah.
 Talk to me about multiple baptism.
 Here's the deal.
 There is a passage, and I think it is in Acts 19,
 where Paul is actually talking to a group of people,
 and he's saying they need to get rebaptized
 because they've just basically upgraded
 their understanding of God.
 And so these people all get rebaptized.
  </li><li>That's right.
 These are the people who only know of John's baptism,
 which is a baptism of repentance.
 So he baptized them in the name of the Jesus.
 the name of the Jesus.
 Yeah.
 And then, you know, there are also baptized in the Holy Spirit at the same time.
 That's a fascinating passage.
 Yeah.
 So there, you know, there is obviously a scriptural precedent.
 And because it's from Jewish tradition and the Jewish people didn't just have one mikvah.
 I mean, it was part of how the, you know, their process with the Lord.
 So I think that's kind of interesting.
 For me, I was like a sprinkle baptized when I was a kid, I think.
 I don't remember.
 Which sprinkling is not the biblical definition of baptism.
 No.
 No, it's a immersion, complete submersion.
 But I got baptized when I was away with YWAM.
 And this was '92, '93, so a little while ago.
 And I got baptized in the ocean.
 We were in Honduras on mission and they decided to do a baptismal service and nobody actually
 told me that you, that I would want to hold my nose closed.
 And so I kind of got water boarded while getting baptized.
 It was pretty fantastic.
 Really cleaned out the sinuses.
 But anyway, I could, that's, that was 93.
 And then when the revival started in Toronto about, well, we were in the new building.
 probably a year or two into it. I got baptized again and I got baptized that time because
 I had been in a season where I knew the Lord was talking to me about being in ministry,
 but I was fighting him every step of the way. This is not what I want. This is what I want
 over here. And I'd finally come to a place where I was like, "Actually God, you get to
 be God." And it was after I'd come to that place that I was like, "I trust you." And
 So I'm re-upping my, my, you know, team Jersey as it were, you know, I'm, I'm going for the
 upgraded.
 This season's uniform.
 Just getting this season's uniform.
 Yeah.
 So I got baptized again.
 And then I actually got baptized two years ago because I was in the Jordan River.
 And so I got to baptize our whole team and also this lovely pastor from Brazil asked
 me if I had baptized them while we were there, which was, I, I cried through all of it.
 And then I got baptized in the Jordan because I was like, yes, you know,
 and each time that I got baptized, I really felt like, Oh, yeah,
 something's shifted.
 I wasn't necessarily aware what had shifted.
 Uh, other than I, I felt different.
 I felt, I felt something.
 Wow.
 Yeah.
 So, um, but now I feel like the Lord, like as I've been praying and
 preparing to speak on baptism for the last couple of weeks,
 I just kept feeling like the Lord was like,
 "Hey, actually I want you to shake off the last season,
 "you know, and get ready to go into the new season.
 "So I want you to also be baptized."
 And so I'm going to get baptized as well.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>On Sunday.
  </li><li>Who's baptizing you?
  </li><li>Well, if you're baptizing people, you could baptize.
  </li><li>I will not be baptizing people.
  </li><li>I didn't think you did sign up for it.
  </li><li>My back will not support baptizing people.
  </li><li>I think I'm gonna ask Tony if he'll do it.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Aren't you taller than Tony?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Okay.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>He's strong, he's mighty.
  </li><li>I'd like to give a temperature update.
 It's now a balmy 80 degrees in our office.
  </li><li>I still feel good.
  </li><li>It's increased one percent.
 I don't know how you're hoping.
 I want to jump in a pool.
  </li><li>I don't feel even remotely high.
  </li><li>How are you kidding me though?
  </li><li>In fact, I feel a bit like I wish I wasn't sitting next
 to the vent because there's a bit of a breeze.
  </li><li>Doesn't end the screwing nothing.
 That's just blowing some like, tepid air around.
 So I was thinking as we're sort of talking about baptism and basically about how powerful
 it is.
 The thing that I started with this morning and then what I finished with was both Romans
 6, like Romans 6 verse 1 through about verse 11.
 These are the verses you memorized when you were not saved.
 Yeah, this was where, like this is sort of a funny story, but as a kid I used to go up
 to the cottage and it's my mom's parents' cottage, you know, and spend time with the cousins
 and all that. And of course, I wasn't growing up with any understanding of the Lord, but
 my cousins were all growing up Baptist. And I remember this one summer they were, we were all
 going to be up at the cottage for a week or two. And so Uncle Paul would do like a Bible study with
 his kids when we're at the cottage. And I usually sort of just went to my room or went
 outside or whatever. Like I really wasn't interested. But he started that particular
 morning by saying, "Alright guys, we're going to memorize some verses and whoever memorizes
 them first is I'm going to pay for them to go to the movies and they get to pick one of
 their siblings or cousins to go with them." And I was like, I know, right? He was partnering
 I think with Jehovah's Sneaky.
 We'll study the Bible for movie tickets.
 That's right.
 And so they were all like, yay, you know, kind of thing.
 And he's like, so the first person to memorize Romans one through Romans 10 and come back and say it to me, I will give you movie tickets.
 And so I was like, Uncle Paul.
 And he's like, I said, can anybody participate?
 And he's like, yep, if you memorize at first, I'll give you the movie tickets.
 And I was like, OK, so of course, I just.
 I think I took one of grandma's Bibles, but I could have that one.
 And went memorized and came back and I won the movie tickets.
 But the funny part about that was I didn't give my life to the Lord for many years
 after that.
 However, and I don't really love this word, but I felt like that passage kind of haunted me.
 Troubled you.
 It troubled you.
 Well, yes, but like in the best kind of way, like it would just be there in the background.
 And I didn't, I didn't really fully understand what it was that I had memorized.
 Yeah.
 And, but now that I look back, I'm like, that's pretty tricky.
 Yeah, it's pretty clever.
 But I'll read it to you from the message because it's, I love the way the message sort of captures.
 Um, what's happened?
 Okay, go for it.
 So Romans six, first one in the message.
 So what do we do?
 Keep on sinning so God can keep on forgiving.
 I should hope not.
 See, that's the grace message, isn't it?
 That's like, oh, you know, I'm just, it's okay.
 There's grace for me.
 Well, the greasy grace message, the proper grace message is that the grace of God has
 appeared to just say, to say no.
 Yes.
 Not so that we keep on saying that.
 It's in power.
 Do you still that you can say no, keep going.
 Um, but anyway, uh, so, uh, keep on sitting so God can keep on forgiving.
 I should hope not.
 If we left the country where sin is sovereign, how can we still live in our old house there?
 Or did you realize we packed up and left there for good?
 That is what happened in baptism. When we went under the water, we left the old country of sin
 behind. And when we came up out of the water, we entered into the new country of grace, a new life
 in a new land. That's what baptism into the life of Jesus means. When we are lowered into the water,
 it is like the burial of Jesus. And when we are raised up out of the water, it is like the
 resurrection of Jesus. Each of us is raised into a light filled world by our Father,
 so that we can see where we're going in our new grace sovereign country.
 Could it be any clearer? Our old way of life was nailed to the cross with Christ.
 At the size of end, that sin miserable life no longer at sins every back and call.
 What we believe is this, if we get included in Christ's sin-conquering death,
 we also get included in his life-saving resurrection, which is just amazing.
 That's great.
 Isn't it so good? It's so powerful.
 We know that when Jesus was raised from the dead, it was a signal of the end of death as the end.
 Never again will death have the last word. When Jesus died, he took sin down with him,
 but alive he brings God down to us. From now on, think of it this way.
 Sin speaks a dead language that means nothing to you. God speaks your mother tongue,
 and you hang on every word, you are dead to sin and alive to God. That's what Jesus did.
 So I just, I mean, I love, again, I think the message, I love the way it sort of encapsulates it, but
 baptism is powerful, you know, and it's, it is making an exchange. And I was thinking about how
 much of the kingdom is about exchange, you know, and it's Jesus did everything in a moment, but
 but we appropriate it, don't we?
 We actually partner with him
 and we appropriate what he's done.
 And so I'm so excited about the baptisms
 'cause well, I cry during every baptism anyway.
 It's like--
  </li><li>You love them, babe.
  </li><li>I love baptisms.
 But I mean, I've also seen people get healed of stuff
 in baptisms and--
  </li><li>Tell me some of those stories.
  </li><li>Well, I'm trying to remember
 'cause we used to see quite a few like in Toronto
 where people would get, you know,
 go in with back pain and come out and they're like,
 It's gone.
 I've had back pain for years and it's gone.
 Things like that.
 One of the times when I got,
 well, that was where it was sort of debatable,
 but I was quite sick when I got baptized in Honduras
 and I had a cold low of stuff now.
 Who knows if it's from salt water, waterboarding or not,
 but I felt better afterwards once I recovered.
 But yeah, I'm excited.
 I don't know.
 I just can't wait for next week.
  </li><li>Well, I love it. - Yeah.
  </li><li>If you go to Grace Center and you would like to be baptized.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Or dare I say, even if you don't go to Grace Center
 and you'd like to be baptized.
  </li><li>And you'd like to be baptized.
  </li><li>And you're in the Franklin area on Sunday.
 If you go to GraceCenter.us,
 you will find on our front page of your scroll down
 an invitation where you can sign up to be baptized.
 If you're gonna do that, we need your resignation.
 No, we need your registration by Wednesday
 so that we can accommodate you.
 But yeah, go baptisms.
  </li><li>Yeah, that just helps us organize everything and get--
  </li><li>Our whole service is gonna be given over to baptism.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's really exciting.
  </li><li>Gonna be amazing. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Sorry, I blanked out there
 'cause it's so stinking hot in my office.
  </li><li>Well, baby, we should wrap it up
 so that you can open the doors.
  </li><li>No way, we have a listeners question.
  </li><li>Oh, all right.
  </li><li>This is from Anonymous.
  </li><li>Hello, Anonymous.
  </li><li>And Anonymous says,
 "I'm listening to the podcast from episode number 274
 about moving through transitions and seasons of life.
 And I have two questions.
 Number one, would you be willing to say something
 about transitions that happen that you couldn't see coming?
 One of my parents was in an auto accident 15 months ago.
 And that ushered in a season of my life,
 which was radically different from what went before.
 I'm now caring for both parents
 and struggling to find time for my own life
 as well as to know what I'm responsible for
 regarding my parents.
 But this is nothing that was a desire of mine
 or that I saw coming.
 What about transitions into seasons like that?
 I'm very curious about what you would say
 about those sorts of transitions.
  </li><li>Oh, anonymous, that sounds really, really hard.
 So I mean, I wanna start by saying I'm sorry,
 that's so hard.
 And I mean, I think that's sort of a very different
 kind of transition than what we were
 really talking about in terms of transitions that we choose to move into.
 Yeah.
 You, of course, haven't chosen that transition at all.
 Babe, you're looking at the actual question.
 Is it just what was the question?
 How do we...
 Yeah, just really curious about what you would say about those sorts of transitions.
 I think the thing I'd like to encourage you with Anonymous is what you're describing
 is one of the side effects of being alive.
 Like life throws, transitions, curveballs,
 things we didn't see coming.
 You know, our friendship would say
 that life is tragic and God is faithful.
 And one of the things to help you get through those seasons
 is someone Graham Cook loves to say
 is that the "why" question is the wrong question to ask.
 The "why" question never gets answered
 this side of eternity.
 The question that we wanna ask in seasons like that
 is the what question.
 Lord, what do you want to be for me in this season
 that perhaps you couldn't in any other season?
 Because the Lord hasn't brought you into this season
 to punish you or punish your parents
 or be mean to you.
 This isn't judgment.
 This is a season that you're in
 that the Lord would love to meet you in in a special way.
 And part of the sadness of the season like this
 is it's bewildering.
 It takes our legs out from underneath us.
 Yeah.
 Part of the gift of a season like this is it's an invitation
 to ask the Lord, Lord, what is it that you want to be to me
 that I couldn't see in any other season?
 And of course, without knowing you
 and without knowing your situation,
 and even if we did, it would be folly of us
 to even suggest what some of those things would be.
 But I wonder, given that nothing takes the Lord by surprise,
 what is the Lord would love to do for you
 in this season anonymous.
 What was the second question that anonymous said?
 Anonymous writes, Alan's comment about coming before God as
 robot boy, and God refusing to respond to Alan's question about
 marrying AJ as a, you know, shoot or should not really resonated
 with me. There's definitely still a part of me that's afraid to
 make the wrong choice, one that will or might have bad
 consequences in the future. I'm sorry for my stuff, he knows
 a combination of allergies and being in an oven is doing this
 to me. Would you say more about not treating oneself as a robot but as God does, as a human
 being who has desires that can definitely be part of the will of God? I love that. And
 I think part of the reason I love that is just this week. I had ministry on that very
 topic, an area of my life where I didn't realize that I was still living with that mindset
 of like, I want to do what's right and not do what's wrong. And actually, in my effort
 to do what was right, it was actually not fueled by a desire to please, but of a fear
 that I might do something wrong. And actually what embraces the idolatry that I somehow
 have got the best benchmark of whether, you know, I'm veering into or out of the will
 of God. And part of the ministry was for me to repent from that and realize actually
 God is really good that if we live with an open heart before him, that he will speak to us if we're
 going to derail our lives. And there's so much freedom. I think I heard Bill Johnson talk about
 living with a green light mentality that sometimes as Christians, we feel like we're constantly a
 stoplight, a red light, Lord, do I, do I not, do I turn left, I turn right, should I go, you know,
 what should I do?" And he was talking about like, "When you have the mind of Christ,
 when you're living under a new covenant, yes, there's very strict parameters that the Lord's
 given for us, but they're very wide and broad parameters." And this is the interview we did with
 Benjamin Jackson, I forget which episode that was, where Ben was talking about like the will of God
 is broad like a meadow. And I think that one of the things I've been having fun with is heading
 in a direction trusting that the father and please understand me when I say heading in a direction
 I don't mean I think I'll try polygamy I mean like the scriptures are really clear on the boundaries
 of the directions you can go in I mean within the remit that's been given to me
 that exam look at me I just want to make sure that our podcast listeners weren't like Aaron
 said, everything goes. But within, you know, what's ours to choose? Yeah. Like, do I take
 a new job? Do I move house? Do I, you know, cell house? Do I go on vacation? Where do I go
 on vacation? Those questions. Yeah. The Lord will, you know, you can, of course, inquire upon the Lord.
 But if you don't hear anything, that doesn't necessarily mean no. Right. And also, actually,
 having value on the values that God put in your heart, you know, do you have to let yourself
 and Lord, He'll give you the desires of your heart.
 Some of that is He will replace your desires
 with the things that's after His heart,
 but some of it also is He actually made you with values,
 with delights and wants to satisfy those things.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, again, when you think about it
 in the context of He's the best dad ever,
 like we as just earthly parents
 that are not the best parents ever at all,
 I take so much joy when my kids
 are doing something that they love, you know,
 and investing in that direction.
 And even when I'm like,
 huh, that's maybe not the wisest use of your money.
 If you have great joy and I'm like, good.
 I have great joy that you're getting to do that.
 I'm just sort of thinking like in terms of--
  </li><li>You mean when our son wants to spend hard earned cash
 on things like V-Bucks,
 which have literally no value.
  </li><li>No value whatsoever.
 But I see my son
 and he's getting such joy from it.
 and actually, okay, you know what I mean?
 Like, I think it has value only because it gives him
 some joy and it's not detrimental to him.
  </li><li>Yeah, all right, anonymous, I hope that helps.
