<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>All right, 237 baby, hit it.
  </li><li>Welcome to episode 237 of Keeping Up with the Joneses.
  </li><li>And literally we're keeping up with the Joneses
 because you've been gone, and I've just thinking,
 just before we even started, you came back,
 what a couple of days ago, and we haven't stopped.
 I'm even seeing this is the first time for us to sit down and talk.
 And so we spent a week apart.
 How the heck was your week?
 Age of Jones.
 It was great.
 It was really good.
 Tell the good people where you were.
 I was at the beach.
 I love the beach.
 Um, yes, I was suffering for Jesus in Destin, Florida.
 Uh, we took our small group leaders away for a retreat to thank them for
 spending a year of their lives on other people.
 And we just eat good food and.
 Have fun.
 -Yeah. -But you had a great time?
 -Had such a good time. -No sunburn.
 -No sunburn. -No craziness in Florida.
 -Well, remember I have a hat, so...
 -I like that again. -I didn't get a sunburn because I wore my hat.
 -Good girl. Your dermatologist would be proud of you.
 -It's so proud of me. Yes, no, it was fun. It was great.
 -Nothing to report. -I got two new bathing suits, which I'm excited about.
 -Okay, this is why you won a membership. Let's model them.
 -I know, but I'll show you them later.
 Okay, great.
 Two new bathing suits.
 All right, well, you're back.
 I've really missed you.
 Five days without you, five nights, six days without you.
 You're making it bigger.
 Yeah.
 It was two weeks without you.
 It was so long.
 I was gone for months.
 Soldier dawn.
 Yeah.
 It was the winter of discontent.
 You were gone for three months.
 For me, the kids somehow managed to survive.
 It's just amazing.
 Didn't you text me on Saturday?
 both of them are being dreadful that we're home and you wanted to lock them in their rooms.
 I don't remember that.
 I think it was a glorious moment of parenting.
 No, I remember it was.
 Yeah, it was classic sabotage, which I don't know if I set myself up parents.
 I don't know if you do this, but you like for me as a dad Saturday, I want to do something fun for the kids.
 And Abby was at a youth conference all day.
 But for my two younger kids, I was like, let's do a movie.
 And I just feel like I set myself up every time, not every time,
 but a lot of times I set myself up.
 And I don't know if I've just got this mystical imagination
 of what it's going to be like.
 And because they don't match my expectations, it's sabotaged
 or whether they really sabotaged it.
 But it all worked out well.
 They were complaining about having to watch a movie.
 And so I was like, fine, yeah, go tidy your bedrooms
 and scrub your toilets.
 And then let's see if that changes your mind.
 I was in about 20 minutes.
 They're like, we're sorry, we'll watch the stupid movie.
 And then they enjoy it.
 And then they actually liked the movie.
 because when I got home, they were like,
 you have to watch, what was it maybe called?
  </li><li>It's called the Mitchells versus the Machines.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And it's a really sweet movie.
 It's Netflix, I've made it.
 I did something that I should know better,
 but I was about 95% of the way through the video
 and tweeted out, oh, this is such a great movie.
 And then I think it was a post-credit scene,
 there was something that I was like,
 I actually don't wanna lend my endorsement.
  </li><li>But it's too late, 'cause you're a introvert.
  </li><li>But most kids wouldn't even pick it up,
 but still just a great fun story.
 But if you're watching it with the younger kids,
 there's a post credit scene where,
 I think you'd miss it if you're not paying attention.
 I missed it, wait till the kids are upstairs,
 watched it re-back with subtitles
 and my suspicions were confirmed.
 But aside from that, great movie.
 I wouldn't let that distract from the movie.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So you were in Florida.
  </li><li>You were single parenting.
  </li><li>I mean--
  </li><li>I don't think we can make a big enough deal about that.
  </li><li>I think we've already made a big enough deal about it.
  </li><li>I was brave.
 You're so brave, babe.
 So proud of you.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Anything else?
  </li><li>Our children are man-eating.
 You have no idea how brave this was.
 No, just kidding.
 You have the new course coming up.
  </li><li>Yeah, we launched the boundaries course last week,
 the Boundary Summer School,
 which I'm super excited about.
 This coming Sunday is going to be the actual first live event.
 You have still got time.
 This episode comes out on a Monday.
 The registration is closing on the Wednesday of the same week, Wednesday,
 May 19th at midnight.
 If you've not already reserved your spot on the boundary summer school,
 I would love you to do that.
 I would hate for you to be disappointed and realize, I missed out on this.
 Um, yeah, I'm really excited.
 I'm taking people through the boundary course,
 which is the standalone video series that I've produced.
 And then I'll be personally coaching people on a live group call each Sunday
 for five weeks.
 And then as if that wasn't fun enough, we've built an online community for people who are
 doing the Boundary Summer School to get to know everybody else's on the Boundary Summer
 School to be able to ask questions, to be able to share.
 Like an open forum kind of thing?
 Well, it's not open.
 It's closed only for the people on the school.
 Right.
 But yeah, they can share their success stories.
 I'm really, really excited about it.
 So if you're interested in learning about boundaries, if you're interested in upgrading
 the quality of your relationships. If you're interested in lowering anxiety from interpersonal
 stress, I'd really, really encourage you to come do the school with me. It's five weeks
 long, two hours a week for five weeks. They'll set up your summer for a glorious fruitfulness.
 Woo hoo.
 Speaking of glorious transformation in the interpersonal arena, our topic this week.
 We're speaking of glorious, I guess we were. Sure, we were.
 Well, I mean, the boundary is going to gloriously transform your interpersonal relationships.
 Hey, my segue was smooth.
  </li><li>Oh, it's good.
  </li><li>You see nothing.
 Our topic this week is all about emotional health.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Well, you know, when I was doing that Instagram survey,
 what should I write a book on?
 Somebody said, "Emotional health,
 "I changed the title to, are you emotionally dying?"
  </li><li>Oh, well, that went dark.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>How's that for a great catchy title?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Are you emotionally dying?
  </li><li>At the moment, I feel okay.
 (laughs)
 It's been a wild year and a bit.
 There's been plenty of opportunities for emotional death,
 dismemberment and--
 Or just denial.
 I don't feel anything.
 I'm OK.
 I don't feel anything.
 No.
 Yeah.
 I was thinking about my journey into the topic
 of emotional health earlier.
 I was thinking about raised in an environment
 or a culture that really praised denial.
 Like, no, there's nothing wrong.
 Everything's fine.
 Everything's fine.
 No, nothing's on fire.
 And then my first kind of nudge towards emotional health from that denial was inner healing
 which
 Now I realize I just relegated to the spiritual realm didn't think about it from an emotional realm
 But thought about you know learn about inner healing
 Which I thought was you know great because it helped me stay in denial. I don't think inner healing helps people stay in denial
 I'm saying inner healing helped me in the stronghold of no everything's fine. I
 I don't understand. Yeah, let me be very very clear. I'm a huge fan of inner healing
 I'm not saying inner healing is ineffective
 I'm saying if you approach inner healing with a stronghold that you don't really need to care about your emotions
 Ah, then inner healing is great at dealing with the things that are pesky enough to remind you that you have emotions
 I've an ungodly belief that makes me sad great. Get rid of the ungodly belief
 So I don't have to be sad anymore and don't have to be aware of my emotions
 For me, right? I still believe in under healing. I think it's very very effective. Let me be clear
 But my understanding of it was somewhat limited.
 So denial, inner healing, and then throwing boundaries,
 you know, learning about boundaries,
 and then counseling, right?
 So I have grief and I go to counseling
 and I think counseling's kind of dumb,
 but you know, anyway, my poor counselor,
 he earned his money.
 Then group therapy, then into all this work about feelings
 that we did a 10 part series all about feelings.
 And now on appreciation, like even with feelings,
 I approached feelings the same way I approached inner healing.
 Oh, let's do this feelings work
 so that I don't have to have any more feelings.
  </li><li>That's awesome.
  </li><li>Into a place of understanding that emotional health
 is really good because you were an emotional
 and spiritual being,
 create for connection and it's very hard to have connection
 if you were trying to numb your emotions.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>All right, podcast is done.
  </li><li>Those are great, so much.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm just thinking about that story arc
 and that curve and wow, like if you don't have a value
 on emotional wellbeing, then you can still make use
 of all these tools and not become emotionally alive.
  </li><li>Sure, absolutely.
  </li><li>I'm curious about your journey to emotional wellbeing.
 Can you think like if I talk about my story arc,
 what was yours?
  </li><li>I don't know.
 I mean, throughout, like me as a kid, teenager,
 I basically squashed down everything that I felt
 and just tried not to feel anything,
 but was almost always angry
 and then struggled with eating disorders
 and what did you just give us coming in?
  </li><li>Did you know you were right?
  </li><li>Oh yeah. - Oh you did?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
 Almost all the time.
 But I mean, if you read my yearbooks,
 you know, the thing that people will say like,
 oh, you're the smileiest person I know,
 you're the whatever, like I could fake it
 with the best of them, but I was angry.
 I was really angry, but it wasn't okay to be angry.
  </li><li>In your environment, so don't have any feelings.
  </li><li>Well, it certainly wasn't safe for me to be angry
 growing up because everybody else was so angry.
 And so it was safer to disappear and feel nothing
 and or try and feel nothing.
 And then when I was, you know, after I got saved at 15,
 but with no inner healing tools or anything like that
 and was more approaching my walk with the Lord
 of using scripture to shove down when I was feeling.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Right, like when you said the thing about like,
 no, no, this house isn't on fire
 and I'm like picturing the background like,
 fuck!
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, and that,
 and you know, I'm like,
  </li><li>No, it's fine, I don't know.
  </li><li>It's gonna be behind me.
 So did you like my sound effects?
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>It's so good.
  </li><li>You're growing in as a fully artist, it's beautiful.
 So then I would say that was sort of my next stage.
 In the renewal, it was hard not to feel emotions.
  </li><li>Well, tell a story about the first time
 you turned up at the church,
 'cause still my favorite story.
  </li><li>When I got stuck to the floor?
  </li><li>No, predates that.
  </li><li>Oh, that one.
  </li><li>Father, I want you to hold me.
  </li><li>Oh, yes.
 (laughs)
 Yes, so I mean, it was, you want me to actually tell?
  </li><li>Tell me actual stories.
  </li><li>I love that story.
 I've heard it a thousand times.
 It's still all my favorite stories.
  </li><li>Okay, so the short version is I got hijacked by a friend.
 We were going to another church
 and I was planning to kill myself.
 Like I was getting everything sort of sorted out
 and I had written all the letters
 and I had them all placed properly in the place
 where I had asked my roommate,
 if anything ever happens to me, check this box.
 Like I was getting things ready.
 Nice, right?
 And going to a church where I didn't really feel
 like people saw me.
  </li><li>Right, was an emotional health a priority
 in that environment?
  </li><li>Oh no. - No, okay.
  </li><li>No. - Great.
 I mean, they were nice people.
  </li><li>Sure, of course.
  </li><li>So then a friend of mine, she'd heard about
 the Toronto Airport Vineyard Christian Fellowship.
 And she had a friend that went there
 and she just kept saying like,
 hey, do you wanna go check this out?
 'Cause she was the one that drove all the time,
 but she was really, really quiet and shy.
 And I was like, no Sandy, I don't wanna go.
 You know, and she'd be like,
 I just, you know, my friend said it's really good.
 I don't want to go Sandy, of course, I don't want to go someplace new.
 I'm planning to off myself, you know?
 So anyway, one Sunday she picked me up and started driving the absolute wrong way on the
 401, which is a massive highway.
 Yes, it is.
 And I was like, you know, Hey, what do you do?
 I was pretty aggressive.
 She was not because of the anger.
 But yeah, probably.
 Um, which I thought I managed well.
 We all do.
 Well, I, I realized the way that at most common that came out was through being
 extremely sarcastic and cutting and facetious.
 Like I would just cut people down all the time
 'cause I would get angry, but I wouldn't get violent.
 So I would just intellectually obliterate them.
 It was such a lovely, a lovely treat to have.
 Anyway, we went, we drove to this church.
 I was mad 'cause I told her I didn't wanna go.
  </li><li>Dobbly mad now.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, so mad.
 So I stonewalled her all the way there
 and she's trying to start conversations
 And she's like, "I'm sorry."
 And I was just like, not having it.
 And about five, maybe five minutes before we got there,
 she said, "Listen, if we go and you don't like it,
 we'll just never go back."
 And I was like, "Fine."
 And so I'm going in, like, I am not gonna like this.
 I'm choosing not to like this.
 And I'm never coming back.
 And so we went in and at the time,
 that church sat about 250, 300 at the most.
 And there was maybe 60 people that were part of the congregation.
 So there was plenty of seats.
 I mean, they had just moved in to the building and we sat in the very back corner,
 like two rows from the back.
 And I, you know, just crossed my arms over my chest and I'm, you know, I'm going to
 make it through this service.
 And I'm an old stare at Sandy every once in a while, make sure she feels my
 ire.
 And anyway, Jeremy Senate, who was the worship pastor, got up and sang.
 I don't honestly remember it was the first or the second song, but anyway, he sang this song called Father I Want You to Hold Me.
 And I remember hearing this horrible noise, like this horrible, like somebody was killing somebody kind of noise.
 And it, which this is going to sound really unhinged, but it took me about 30 seconds to realize I was making this horrible noise.
 And I mean, I was the kind of person who didn't cry in public, didn't show any kind of weakness,
 didn't. And here I am fully losing it. I am wailing and I can't stop. So in my head,
 I'm like, stop it, stop it, get it together, stop it. You know, and I just can't,
 you know, like it was so everybody in the church at some point looked at me.
 Because you, I mean, it wasn't that big in room. You know what I mean? Like everybody heard this
 person and you're just full on losing it. And I couldn't, I couldn't cap it. It was like,
 it was like I had 19 years of I capped it, I capped it, I capped it, I capped it and I was done.
 Yeah. And so I cried all the way through worship, like just wailed. Fast song, slow
 song didn't really matter, just wailed. Did anybody come over and like come for you or put your
 hand on you? No, and Sandy, poor Sandy. Sandy turned like 18 shades of red. I'm pretty,
 I like this is Sandy's nightmare.
 You know, she, she is standing next to the lunatic who has now fully lost it.
 And yeah, nobody came over and said anything.
 And then worship, you know, ended and Sandy like pulled me down into my seat
 because I was, you know, I was unaware I had stopped to come here.
 You've been wailing this whole time.
 Always on and off.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 I mean, I would, you know, for a while, then I start wailing here.
 And then I mean, I remember John spoke, couldn't tell you what he spoke on.
 But I was like, and I'm just like, I got to get out of here.
 Like I just got to get out of here, you know?
 And, but John at the end of his message says, you know, there's somebody here
 that needs to know that daddy loves them.
 And like I remember my head thinking, how does he know?
 Right?
 But you know, like now I'm like, good guess, John.
 Couldn't be the chick losing it at the back.
 I don't know, it's just a thought.
 But he invited me to come up to the front.
 And I remember in my head being like,
 I am not going up there.
 But it was, I literally felt like something pulled me
 out of my seat and pushed me up the aisle.
 Like angels were pushing me or something.
 And John just opened up his arms and I walked into his arms
 and I cried all over him for about 40 minutes.
 And he finished out the service and blessed everybody
 and everything with me bawling on him while he held me up.
 So.
  </li><li>And to this day you owe that man a new shirt.
  </li><li>I know, but we bought him several new shirts
 for several Christmases in a row.
  </li><li>So we're good.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I figured.
  </li><li>You never saw that shirt again.
  </li><li>Never saw that shirt again.
 I didn't.
 And he won't answer the question like,
 "Hey John, do I owe you a shirt?"
 And he just giggles, "A.J."
  </li><li>Do you remember what you were feeling as you left,
 you know, like 40 minutes later as you're driving home,
 like what did you, do you remember what you felt
 about all of that?
  </li><li>I felt, I think I just felt spent,
 like I was exhausted.
 And again, I don't know if that's exhausted
 from 19 years of trying not to feel
 or exhausted from an hour and a half of feeling
 all of those, you know?
 But I remember feeling exhausted, but also like clean.
 Like Sandy didn't have to convince me to go back.
 I was like, I don't know what just happened.
 But all of a sudden I have a little bit of hope that I might survive.
 So yeah.
 So I, I think during like, during the renewal, I, I did a lot of inner healing
 and I did a lot of emotional healing.
 And I was pretty okay with feeling emotions and all that kind of stuff.
 But I think as I think about probably the last, uh, maybe 10 years of being
 here and just some of the pressure and some of the loss and all that kind of stuff.
 I'm getting emotional now.
 Yeah, I'm noticing.
 I would say I became more uncomfortable with feeling emotion.
 And I don't know if that's just because I feel like sometimes the more
 responsibility you have, the more invested my heart gets.
 And then it's just painful to watch.
 People walk away from the Lord or, you know, things like that.
 So the greater the cost, the greater the investment.
 So I think at some point I started protecting myself again.
 And not in the same way I wasn't getting angry,
 but just sort of being like,
 it hurts so much to love people a lot.
 So now I've ruined my makeup.
 And do you know whose fault it is?
 It's your fault.
 I thought we didn't get angry.
 Or deflag with humor.
  </li><li>That was sarcasm.
 (laughing)
 It was just pretty, I was completely wrong.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>What about, like I want to be sensitive to you
 'cause you're crying and you're on camera
 and your makeup's running.
  </li><li>Oh, I don't care.
  </li><li>That's all good.
  </li><li>You look like a backup singer for Kiss.
  </li><li>Okay, thanks a lot.
  </li><li>You keep doing it, it's amazing.
 But sarcasm, see.
 So I don't want to put you on the spot,
 but I also know you're a super powerful person.
 You'll tell me, I don't want to answer that question.
 So you're just opening up, saying, "Hey, in the last 10 years, I'm realizing, wow."
 You know, I grew up in an environment where feelings, you know, emotional health wasn't valued.
 And so, you know, I got 23 years of core pain, go to this church, have this explosion, spend, I don't know,
 the next 10, 15 years in an incredible environment, inner healing, doing a lot of emotional work, gaining emotional health.
 Like one of the things that really, really attracted me to you when I first met you was the story that you told.
 didn't resonate with the person I saw.
 As in, I didn't think you were lying, but as you told your story, I was like,
 how can somebody who's been through so much tragedy and trauma be so whole and
 resolute? Yeah.
 I have had people say that I was lying, by the way.
 Oh, I've had people tell their kids, like if that's her testimony and she was
 able to stand up and say it, then that's then she's actually lying because nobody
 would actually be okay on the other side of that.
 It's a scary reflection on a view of emotional health right there.
 It is.
 Yeah.
 Well, but I think a lot of times when we think about, you know,
 inner healing and emotional health,
 we don't actually think that God can fully restore something.
 We think we'll be like a better version
 and maybe it'll be less painful.
 He's doing it helping us forget.
 Yeah, but you know, we're like looking for like a 50% thing.
 We're not looking for the power of the pain is removed,
 which I think he can do that.
 I think he can remove the.
 Oh, I know he can.
  </li><li>You know, so, and that's been my experience, obviously.
  </li><li>So I'm tracing your org.
  </li><li>Yeah, you're tracing my org, go ahead.
 I'm not sure if I'm gonna enjoy this arc tracing, go ahead.
  </li><li>No, so like no place for emotional health,
 living in an environment that's really abusive,
 really traumatic, come to church,
 have this incredible encounter,
 spend the next 10, 15 years in this incredible environment
 where it's a huge value for emotional health
 and our healing, counseling, therapy, all that sort of stuff.
 Then you move here and for the last 10 years,
 you're recognizing now with a little bit of hindsight.
 Oh, I don't pay words in your mouth,
 but I started deadening my heart
 or I started not allowing myself to,
 how would you describe the last 10 years?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I think I did okay until,
 I mean, I remember 2014 being a super tough year.
 And it was just like, I got to the end of that year
 and I was like, oh, I'm out.
 like, and for me it was, we lost somebody that we were praying to get healed, Ted, at the
 beginning of the year, and then we had some staff that moved off staff that I was really
 grieving that they were leaving, and then there was another person that died, and then
 in the fall of that year Ben died.
 And I was just like, this is just too hard.
 So remember that year being really, really hard, and then going for some trauma prayer
 the banks and all that kind of stuff and started to sort of, okay, it's okay.
 We're going to get some lift.
 But then coming into this past year with COVID, I realized I just got hurt and tired and thought,
 I don't want to use any of the tools that I have anymore.
 I just want to tell you all the screw off and leave me alone.
 Sorry.
 But I did.
 Like I was just like, I'm done with you all.
 you all. Everybody with an opinion about what they think we should be doing differently
 when they're not in our shoes. You know, like, so I just found it super, super painful.
 And I think like, honestly, I sort of went to the place of like, I feel like we give everything
 we can, you know, like, whether it's from the platform, whether it's on the school, like,
 I give 100% I don't hold things back.
 I tell the truth.
 And I think for me, because of some of the opinion and things that people would post,
 I was like, what am I doing?
 Like, why am I giving my life to you if you don't actually think that we love you or that
 we're telling you that, I mean, why am I doing this?
 I could have a way easier job than this job.
 Like I'll go work at Starbucks and not care about yeah, you know like
 So I think I just got to where I was like oh I well I stopped looking at Instagrams, you know
 Facebook I hate anyway
 You know just just got to where I was like I'm just done with everyone's opinion
 But I also just sort of shut down feeling all together
 I was like everything feeling anything felt overwhelming. That's what I was gonna ask. So like you you come this block you realize
 Okay, you know, I'm done with this. I don't want to feel this anymore
 What how did you like in terms of emotional?
 Response what was your solution because I lived with you. You didn't turn to alcohol. You didn't turn to drugs. No
 What what what did you turn to to get away from all of that? Oh like Netflix hulu
 Reading I didn't turn to eating. I probably turned to not eating
 you know like
 just
 Trying to escape. I mean little games on my phone just anything to just keep my brain busy until I was tired enough to fall asleep
 I'm
 curious about
 When you had awareness that you were doing that because in my experience I
 I only have awareness post.
 Like I look back and realize I was doing it.
 Usually when I am doing it,
 I'm kind of semi aware, but I can talk myself out with it.
 Were you aware, oh, I'm deadening my heart right now.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I totally knew what I knew.
  </li><li>Oh, you knew.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 But also I felt really sick.
 You know, so in the midst of that, I got mono
 and I'm like, I feel dreadful.
 I'm tired all the time.
 I'm dizzy when I stand up and we're in the middle of COVID
 and we're trying to make the best decisions we can.
 Oh, and we're taking the school online.
 Oh, and I need to get ready for that.
 But I actually can't even sit up.
 And, you know, like, I think it felt like
 just pressure from everywhere.
 And I was just like,
 it just became about surviving each day.
  </li><li>So in terms of like rating emotional health,
 we're at a what?
  </li><li>Low, what would, what's the gallery on?
 (laughs)
 Low.
  </li><li>I remember our dad, our friend Dan saying,
 your head will lie to you, but your body will not.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I think about just in the stories that you've told,
 like going to that church, your head will lie to you.
 You know, I'm not going to the church
 and I don't feel anything.
 And I'm angry because these guys are jerks,
 not because I'm in pain and running for my feelings.
 So your head will lie to you,
 but your body won't get into this environment.
 A really safe sanctuary, literally,
 you're to church sanctuary.
 And boom, as you say, put up, put up, put up, put up,
 blow up, it all comes out.
 And then, you know, this last couple of years,
 just the strategy of ignoring your emotional well-being,
 you know, your head will light you know, I'm good. You know, I can press through and you know, just
 eat together through this and people in their stupid opinions. You can talk yourself out of
 what you're feeling your head will light you, but your body won't, which is why you were probably
 in bed for for so long. Well, I mean, well, for one thing, I don't know that it's was a couple of
 years. I think it was really last year intensely trying because we did the whole feeling your
 emotions course and we've been using that language and you know, and I've been trying to do that,
 I think last year, though, I just basically came home from Israel, went into quarantine,
 and then I felt like all hell broke loose, really.
 So I remember talking to Sam about mono and just saying, "How did I get mono?
 Like mono is the kissing disease.
 Like, Alan doesn't have mono.
 I haven't kissed anyone else.
 You know what I'm talking about."
 Well, I'm not sure about it.
 You would be talking about it.
 You would be talking about it.
 Um, and she said, well, whatever, like by the time you're 40, something like 85 or 90% of
 adults have the Epstein bar virus, which is what produces mono, but they have fought it off,
 you know? And so she said, in all likelihood, you just had that virus the whole time. And
 what's happened is it's now been stress activated. And so she, when I talked to her after, I'd had
 it for a couple of weeks, she said, you're going to have to always be careful because you can
 stress reactivated. And I think I didn't like, yeah, I just
 started taking everything on instead of like previously when
 people would say stuff, I would get hurt. But I'd be able to
 give it to the Lord and just be like, Lord, I need some help
 with this. This is this is what I heard. This is how I heard it.
 I don't even know that that's how it was said, but this is how I
 heard it. And can you help me with that? And I just seem to lose
 any ability to do that and gain perspective.
 So yeah, I don't know what your question was before that.
 That's great, great answer.
 I've so loved being with you.
 You should go to Florida for five days for more because it produces just the best
 conversations.
 Yeah, go to the beach.
 I'll see you later.
 Yeah.
 So I'm curious because I've been with you this whole time and in our journey.
 And perhaps I've, you know, been so distracted with my own version of that story.
 It feels like though, just in conversations we've had offline and in the way you're telling
 the story today, that I know that you were saying, "Oh no, I was aware of this the whole
 time."
 It feels like you in recent weeks have had more awareness of what was happening than
 perhaps you did as it was happening.
 Does that make sense?
 Oh, I think I have more awareness now than then, but I remember thinking at the time,
 I'm too tired to use any of the things that I have.
 I don't even want to.
 And I'm living in the guest room.
 Like I lived in the guest room for four months last year because I kept getting sick, you
 know.
 So I'm basically doing life on my own.
 And I just was like, it's too tired to choose to work on any.
 I'm too tired.
 So what is so now that you've recognized that's where it was, that's where I've been.
 What did you do to start the journey of?
 Because at one point you, you forsook your emotional health.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And now you're realizing,
 no, my emotional health is important.
 What's the turnaround for that?
 Like what's your plan?
 What's your heart?
 What's your next steps for pivoting away from that
 distress and emotional death?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Into emotional health and vibrancy.
  </li><li>I think the first thing for me was starting to share
 with some people how I was actually feeling,
 which I wasn't doing.
 So, you know, that was like you, Ben and Sarah, Shannon,
 you know, Lindsey, like some of my close friends,
 and just in the podcast now,
 but just sort of saying, I'm not okay.
 And I think that helped me a lot actually.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Because none of those people greeted me with shame
 or, you know, you should know better
 'cause you've been in ministry for 20 years
 or, you know, whatever.
 So that was helpful.
 I've reached out to somebody to start counseling.
 So I'm still on the wait list for that, but I'm hoping to do that.
 Um, and I'm just trying to let myself feel how I feel.
 Thus this, you know, the, the tears, the face, uh, without
 shoving it down again.
 I don't want to go back to living like that.
 No.
 And I think out of tiredness, I just thought that was the best option and it didn't.
 It doesn't turn out that well.
 Because life doesn't pause for you to not feel.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like you still got kids, you still got, they need support.
 You've still got to work out.
 Are we at homeschooling or we, you know, online, like everything keeps going.
 All your responsibilities are still there.
 And I get it.
 I get the whole, I'm too tired to deal with this right now.
 And sometimes that's a kind of kindness to us.
 Like I don't have capacity.
 Like I think about, you know,
 my desire is to always connect.
 And you know, I can think of months
 where life is so crazy we crawl in a bed
 and I'm like, "Hey baby, let's connect."
 And you're like, "It's 10, 37 at night.
 Let's not."
  </li><li>No, let's not.
 Months, you do that all the time when you're talking about.
 You did that to me last week at some point.
 It's like 11 o'clock.
 I am already like fading.
 Like I'm pretty sure I was asleep
 when you started the, so how was your day?
 I was like, no, not right now.
  </li><li>But what I was gonna say is you started being more receptive
 to even being more present than staying removed and hidden.
 Which is beautiful.
 And it's like this whole journey of valuing your insides
 enough to give yourself space to rest and get help
 and to be weak and to have needs is a beautiful process.
 And I think even last year I felt so emotionally overwhelmed
 that if you came in with even a drop of emotion,
 I was like, no.
  </li><li>Yeah, if I don't know if you have feelings,
 you're gonna make me feel.
  </li><li>Well, or you're gonna make me tip right over the edge
 and I'm gonna lose my mind.
 I felt like I'm skating on the edge here.
 Don't give me a shove, you know, kind of thing.
  </li><li>And I'd be like, let's talk about our feelings.
 Let's talk about my feelings.
  </li><li>No! - Get back, foul beast, get back.
  </li><li>Let's not, talk to somebody else about your feelings.
 Yeah, so it was rough, it was a rough year.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm so glad that you're being kind to stuff.
 That whole thing of self care is not selfish.
  </li><li>Well, and you did great with me saying,
 "I can't talk about your feelings
 'cause I can't even manage my own."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, yes, I did do great.
 He said as he applies himself.
 I'm like, yeah, no, I remember.
 I remember hearing that and thinking, okay, no,
 I understand what that's like.
  </li><li>I'm aware that wasn't super kind to you, but, you know.
  </li><li>But also, you know, I'm thinking about
 what we learned from Chip, about, you know,
 healthy shame says we have limitations.
 It's okay for you to have limitations.
 And actually it's okay for me to find other places
 for me to get my, you know, you can't be the sole dispenser
 of my emotional wellbeing, like that's unfair to you.
 So if I'm coming to you going, hey, babe,
 I'm feeling overwhelmed, I'd love to process my feelings.
 It's unkind of me to make you endure that
 when you're all be at choosing an unhealthy response,
 but it's the best response you've got at the time.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so that's the beauty about being in an environment
 where you've got options, where I,
 there's so many people I can call and say,
 I need a process I need.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we've really leaned in our friends this year,
 so thank you so much, probably.
  </li><li>Send them something. - Send them gifts.
 Hey, thank you so much.
 (laughs)
 And that's the beauty of life is there's ebbs and flows
 of that, like historically in our marriage,
 there's been times where I've been in crisis
 and you're not freaking out and then vice versa, so.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Oh gosh.
 I didn't think all of that was gonna happen
 when we talked about emotional health,
 but I'm glad it did.
  </li><li>Me neither.
 So beautiful.
 Well, if I'd known though, I wouldn't have put on makeup because, you know, yeah, it
 is still there.
 Yeah.
 At all.
 When I was thinking about this topic, I was thinking about my culture was a biblical culture,
 growing up my house, the church environment, was all based on Scripture.
 And so it amazes me that though we read the same Bible, we didn't focus on the internal
 person.
 We focused on salvation.
 right? The greatest need. But I think about proverbs that talks about, you know, above
 all else, guard your heart for it's the wellspring of life. Like you're literally talking
 about as I did not tend care for my heart, pay attention to the voice of the heart that
 was screaming I need help. Like you literally ended up in bed for four months in isolation.
 You know, I've wrote down some of the verses because I'm not good at memorizing everything
 off the top of my hand in a short term. You look at this, Proverbs 4.23 above all else,
 your heart for it's the wellspring of life. How about this Proverbs 14 verse 30? A hearted
 peace gives life to the body, but envy rots the bones. Now you're not talking about envy there,
 but envy is not an emotionally healthy state. Like our internal state produces fruit in our body.
 Or Proverbs 1722, a cheerful heart is good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.
 And I love that we live in an environment where we do have amazing resources, we do have amazing
 friends, we do have amazing people where we get to be human all the time and not have it to get
 together. I love that you're a leader and you talk openly about where you're at. I think that's
 incredible for our community and for the people who are also struggling. I was also thinking about
 in previous times where we've had friends, the other person provers about faithful,
 the wounds of a friend. I think about the time of the past when Kathy came to me, remember?
 And she stopped in the parking lot, she was like, Alan, like, you don't look good. You've
 lost a light that's in your eyes. And I remember that stang. And the next day, Fred was just
 like, dude, what are you doing to take care of your? We didn't take care of yourself.
 And so I was thinking about how as people have been listening to this episode, if you
 were listening to this episode back in the year that you were describing, how are we able
 to discern how well we are doing in caring for our emotional health? That's the question
 I want to pose. I've got three thoughts. I'm curious if you have any.
 How are we able? Well, I guess if I think we usually know when we're hiding, if you're
 hiding, you're probably not doing that well.
 I'm not sure we always do though. I can think of times when I've hidden them, it's taken
 somebody to say, "Buddy, are you okay?"
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Playing a bit too much Netflix there.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I'm not always confident.
 I'm the best Geiger counter reader of my emotional health.
  </li><li>Right.
 But I mean, hopefully if you have healthy community,
 they'll point it out to you.
  </li><li>And that's historically been it.
 That like Jeff or Danielle, people I work with,
 or our friends will just be like,
 "Hey, buddy, doing okay."
 And that will take me to start with,
 the Holy Spirit's good at that.
 But also, you know, I've developed to find reflex
 over the years to ignore the Holy Spirit
 about things I don't want him to talk to me about.
 Now, I don't want to do that, but I'm also aware
 when I'm in pain, sorrow, anger, rage, malice,
 all those things that grieve the Holy Spirit.
 You know, I'm pretty good at deafening him.
 My experience of you in that last year is,
 like I hear you say, no, I had awareness.
 When we would talk about that,
 Maybe you had awareness you didn't want to talk about it,
 but I was shut down pretty quick.
  </li><li>Yes, well, 'cause I was trying to state numb.
  </li><li>Ah, I see, so you were aware,
 but you just didn't want to talk about it.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause then it will all come out.
 So this is a very tentative little cap I have on this bad boy.
 And if you want to talk about things,
 then actually that's gonna mess it up.
 So and--
  </li><li>So you're aware?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm maybe less aware then.
 I'm just thinking about my own experience.
 I'm usually not that aware.
 It usually takes people to point out to me
 that I have to fight them mentally.
 And then I realize, no, they love me.
 They probably got up high and then, you know,
 I go away and think about it.
 I'm like, yeah, no, I'm not doing great.
 Or I get sick.
 One of those two things happened.
 Usually my sickness determines I've been doing too much.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, I mean, I was, my body was trying to send that message
 pretty loud and clear.
 And actually, one of the, I remember one of the days
 when it started to shift for me.
 I listened to one song over and over again,
 and I just lost it all morning,
 which is that unraveling song.
 Who's it by Corey Aspery or something?
 Then I just lost my nut,
 and then I played it in the car one point
 and I had to pull over.
 I was just bawling in the car.
 But I was like, okay, I'm really, really not okay.
 but actually, and then realizing I didn't want to state not okay.
 Which is powerful.
 Yeah, it only took me.
 That don't even do that.
 Like, you know, that you're shame.
 I have feelings about that shame.
 I have so much gladness being with you and then so much fear and anger
 about the shame that makes you want to quantify that.
 So, but you can have your shame if you want.
 I'm not trying to keep you from having your feeling of shame.
 I'm just having feelings about it.
 Okay, everything's fine.
 So what were your three questions to ask yourself?
 Well, I was there's actually four.
 There's three in and there's a bonus, Axra, but there were the questions
 that Fred asked me, you know, and the questions are basically like, you know,
 get yourself in touch with what nourishes your emotional health.
 And because we're a triune being, we're, you know, body, soul and spirit.
 It's like, are you aware of what nourishes your body?
 Like what brings peace to your body?
 I'm throwing that out there.
 Oh, are you asking me?
 Yeah, I'm asking you.
 I'm also asking my listeners to think about that.
 Like what brings near water?
 Yeah, nourishes your body.
 Me, I still can't believe I'm going to say these words when we go camping.
 Yeah, I feel actively rested, even though it's so much work.
 I feel nourished being out in fresh air.
 Yeah. So, you know, what what nourishes, what brings peace to your body?
 What brings peace to your soul?
 I don't know.
 Do you like?
 No, it's fine if you don't know.
 What brings peace to your soul?
 Environment's nice environments.
 OK, like well designed environments like you remember
 a vacation? Oh, we went and stayed at just a beautiful resort in Hawaii.
 And I walked into the hotel and I could feel tension leave my body.
 Yeah.
 So carefully curated, beautiful spaces bring nourishment to my soul.
 I would agree with that.
 Great connects with friends.
 Yeah.
 Specifically, if there's also good food involved.
 Mm-hmm.
 No, for real?
 Yeah.
 I was also thinking about the answers to this question.
 One of the things that brings nourishment to my soul
 is when I get resolution to conflict.
 So if I'm in conflict, if I'm in tension,
 and it could be small tension, like,
 "Hey babe, I just realized I wrote the story
 "about something you said earlier,
 "and can I compare notes with you?"
 This is what I...
 This is the whole story I wrote about this interaction.
 Is that real? And you're like, "No, and ah."
 Or even if you're like, "Yeah."
 And then we get to talk through the resolution of that.
 That brings peace and nourishment to my soul.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>A good book, a good movie.
 You know, I can get into it.
 And it's not, you know, the danger with that
 is you can get lost and distracted.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Then finally what brings nourishment to your spirit?
  </li><li>I mean, for me, mostly soaking.
 I'm still stuck on Stephanie's CD
 that she released right at the beginning of the pandemic.
 But yeah, soaking and then just spending time in the word
 I've just started a new study with a bunch of girls
 to just get back into like a regular habit.
 I realized in the midst of my hiding, I was hiding from God too.
 So, yeah.
 And then my fourth question is, when was the last time you purposely made room for any
 of those three things?
 Today?
 Yeah, you did.
 You took a day off.
 I took a day off and I read for a while and I did my Bible study and I was going to sit
 outside, but it was too cold.
 Yeah, I just think having awareness of what nourishes your body or soul and your spirit
 And conversely, what damages and drains your body, your son, your spirit, you know, like for me,
 sleeplessness, I can recognize the damages of my body being redundancy, like it just
 grates on my soul. It's like death by a thousand tiny paper cuts, you know, poor service, I could
 you know, I can already feel the anxiety. What agrees my spirit is control and manipulation,
 like if I'm in an environment of control or passivity.
 So eradicating those things and then purposely adding those things is a great way of nourishing
 our soul and helping our heart. And as you want to talk about emotional health, by the way,
 bravo, like I, just so you know, the way we do this, it's we don't plan anything. We've got the
 the loosest of structures of this is top we're going to talk about. Here's some things we need to think about. And that's it. So I didn't have a clue you were going to say any of that stuff. And I loved hearing all of it.
 Well, I purposely don't look at the notes because you like doing it. I like to just.
 Free stuff.
 Talk about whatever.
 Yeah.
 I also have a listeners question for you, which constantly enough fits into all this and we may have already answered it. By the way, if you listen to this, everything that we've talked about will be meticulously putting the show notes. So, if I just talked about a song or
 or an event or previous episodes or topics,
 they'll all be in the show notes for this week.
 The listeners question,
 it's an anonymous listeners question,
 it says this, "I know we're never fully healed,
 "but how do you let someone into the process of healing?"
 Would you kind of answer it,
 but see if there's any more.
  </li><li>I mean, how do you let someone into the process?
 I think you just choose to.
 Like, I don't think any of us love to show other people
 struggles or like the parts that we have shame about or you know whatever. But I
 think you choose carefully. Like I don't typically accept for this podcast.
 You know, share all of my you know deep whatever but I have specific safe people
 that that I have let in and I've given permission to speak to me about when they
 I feel like I'm not letting them in when they feel like I'm hiding.
 So.
 What are the hallmarks of safe people for you?
 They're working on their own lives.
 They're not the kind of people who you tell them something and then they've told a whole
 bunch of other people.
 I want to know that they know the Holy Spirit, you know, that they hear from the Lord.
 I want to see them tend gently to their own hearts
 before I trust them with mine.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I didn't mean to interrupt you.
  </li><li>No, that's good, that's really good.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's really no getting away from,
 like how do you do it, you do it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You have a conversation with a friend and say,
 can I tell you what's happening?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think, I've learned the important preface,
 So if when I go to speak to people about that and knowing what I need by telling them, we
 used to say is, do you want me to listen like a boy or listen like a girl?
 Yeah.
 Like, do I need a solution?
 Am I telling you this because I need a solution?
 Or am I telling you this because I need a human sounding board?
 You know, my insides are exhausted from me keeping it in and I need to get it out.
 Right.
 And all I need you to do is listen.
 I don't need commentary.
 I don't need a solution.
 Yeah.
 I need you or sometimes I need like sometimes like my dangers, I try and figure everything
 myself. But we ask each other, how do you want me to listen? And then sometimes it's like we've had,
 especially like in the past year where you've been like, Hey, I need to talk to you about like,
 I need, I need to share this stuff. And I've been like, Okay, can we do that later? Like, so because
 I know at this moment, I can't do it, but I can actually build up a reservoir being able to absorb
 whatever it is that you need to share. Do you know what I mean? So, but I think that that's part
 of just having safe relationship to you. Yeah, being able to identify your need and being with
 people is so good. So, you know, build a safe community. If you don't have a safe community,
 one of the best things you can do to let someone at the process of healing is find a professional
 and pay the money. Yeah. That's why counselors and therapists exist, is so that you can go process
 outside of your friendship group, especially if you're distressed, it's caused by your friendship group.
 But seriously, professional help is a lifesaver for sure. So there you go. If you have a listeners
 question, if anything that AJ shared today, anything we've talked about, you want to ask more. If
 you go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask, we can do our best to try and answer your question on the podcast.
