<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is a j Jones with the green eyes and the new haircut.
 What is going on baby?<br/>
 We are back baby.<br/>
 I'm not sure if I can remember how to do this.
 I know I was having trouble just remembering to turn my phone on airplane mode and that I had to put on earphones.
 I'm like, how does this work in logic again?
 We had people come over this week, didn't we, that we're like, "Oh, is that where you record this?"
 In that little room, it was very funny. I was like, "Yep."
 In a little room with no air conditioning, well, there is air conditioning, but there's like one vent,
 and there's like three panes of floor to ceiling windows, so it's like a heat box.
 Yeah. On hot sunny days, we're like, "Hey, we're suffering to bring in this podcast.
 It's our joy, though."<br/>
 So since the last time we spoke, I've been to Scotland and back again.
 You have.<br/>
 I am a year older.<br/>
 You are and my voice sounds like Barry White.
 It does.<br/>
 Do you want to sing something for us?<br/>
 No, I think it's time for a massive recap on where we've been and what we're doing.
 I think we need to do one of those things like the previously on episodes of lost only.
 It's on episodes of keeping up with the Joneses.
 So basically at the end of May, I got some sad news that my father had passed away.
 Wow, what was the end of May?<br/>
 It was right at the end of May, which is crazy because it's now July.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So bye-bye June.<br/>
 Yeah, it feels like that.<br/>
 Yeah, he got eaten. It was a bit of a shock because he was on vacation in Croatia.
 And I won't retell the story because it is available on earlier episodes,
 but basically he woke up in the morning.
 I thought he had food poisoning and then realized, no, I don't think it's food poisoning.
 And so we text him, said, well, you should probably go to the GP.
 And later that night he passed away.<br/>
 And it turns out what we now know is he had a heart attack
 and was wandering around for 24 hours with the effects of that heart attack.
 And the cardiologist said that type of heart attack
 normally kills people within a matter of seconds.
 So the fact that your dad lived for another 24 hours is quite remarkable.
 And his symptoms of like feeling run down, his lungs, just filling up with fluid.
 I don't know if this is appropriate to talk about, but anyway, it was, it was interesting.
 It's the wrong word, but as soon as we heard that he was in the hospital, not knowing that he had passed away,
 my sister and her husband who lived in Scotland, they jumped on a plane, flute Croatia.
 And, you know, by the time they got there, he'd passed away.
 Yeah.<br/>
 But they, it was, interesting is the wrong word,
 but maybe it was closure.<br/>
 They got to speak to all the hotel staff
 and the hospital staff and the cardiologist
 and they pieced together the timeline<br/>
 that for us was completely missing.<br/>
 Plus they got into his iPad and his iPhone
 and saw all the last photos that he'd taken.
 And yeah, it was, you know, when somebody dies,
 that sucks, it really does.<br/>
 But it's weird how knowing more information
 about how they died helps make it more approachable.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, 'cause then you can process something
 'cause you have information.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause we were over here not knowing a thing.
 And God bless my sister and brother-in-law.
 They flew over.
 They started out all the things you would never think about.
 Like, oh, we need a death certificate in English,
 not just Croatian, and oh, we need his body flown back.
 And meanwhile, while they were doing all that
 and getting his belongings, my elder sister,
 she was starting at the funeral,
 which she couldn't do because the body wasn't back.
 So we couldn't speak to the undertaker.
 And then we found out that there's this strange law
 in Scotland that if you die abroad,
 you're not allowed to be buried in Scotland.
 I mean, I think you are, but you're not.
 You have to go petition the Scottish office and say,
 hey, this is so-and-so and he died.
 And so all that means there was a whole load of red tape,
 which meant my sister and I who live in America,
 we could do nothing.
 We couldn't book flights.
 We couldn't answer questions about when the funeral would be,
 We didn't have any of the answers that we have now.
 So it was all it was all a total blur.
 And I think when my mom passed away about two years ago, we at least knew it was coming.
 She she died of cancer and she'd been given a prognosis of, you know, not very long life.
 So we knew it was coming, but with that it was it was out with the blue.
 Yeah. Anyway, the shocking.
 The reason you haven't heard from us is I got on a plane flew to Scotland, was there for 10 days.
 With everything going on, I didn't fancy trying to coordinate you in Nashville and me and Dundee, trying to do a podcast.
 No.
 And then last week, we were supposed to have one, but I forgot about this thing called jet lag, which I thought I was okay till we got to Sunday evening when we record the podcast and it had well and truly kicked my butt.
 Yes.
 Well, babe, why don't you fill us in on your time there and, you know, just what everything was like.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Sorry.
 This episode's more like therapy for Alan.
 So lots of Alan, but I like it, the sound of your voice.
 So it works for me.
 You get to listen to my cathartic process of retail,
 but we haven't even had time to sit down and talk about it.
 No, we still haven't.
 And you've been home for--
 Oh, we can have.
 Yeah, almost two weeks.
 We'll do that at some point.
 Yeah.
 So the funeral--
 we did something at the grave side.
 We did something at the church, and then we did something
 at the hotel.
 The grave side is weird because you show up,
 And there's all these people that you feel some sense of, like you should connect with them.
 But all I want to do is hide from them, not them.
 I'm like, I'm about to bring my dad.
 I don't know what protocol is here.
 Right.
 And we all arrived in different cars.
 So we weren't sure like, do we walk up to the plot?
 Do we wait for his body?
 Who knows?
 But here was the amazing thing that I didn't, I didn't foresee.
 I was genuinely touched by everyone who came to be further.
 There was a bunch of people I didn't know from my dad's work or from his church circles
 that I even lived in the UK in 14 or 15 years.
 So I didn't recognize some people, but lots of people came for me and that was super touching.
 And by that I mean there's friends that I've had in Scotland, some of whom had never met
 my father and yet they took a day out of work or a half day off of work, drove a considerable
 distance just to be there.
 That meant a lot.
 Yeah, that's super sweet.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was nice to stand around and look up
 and see people I knew and I was really, really touched
 by that.
  </li><li>I actually got some text messages while you were giving
 your eulogy of just pictures of you speaking
 and whatnot and just saying that you've done a lovely job.
  </li><li>Well, I haven't got the eulogy yet.
 This is still me at the grave side.
 Here's the other thing, I was like,
 nobody ever told me about protocol as a funerals.
 So I took lots of photos 'cause I just thought,
 I didn't take any photos with my mom.
 Yeah.
 And, you know, I don't even have a,
 I didn't even have a photo of the gravest
 or anything like that.
 So, rather morbidly, perhaps I took photos of the coffin,
 I took photos of the coffin in the ground.
 I just thought I need something.
 Right.
 And I also wanted to share it with you
 'cause you couldn't be there,
 you were watching the kids and so I took photos.
 So I'll get to see those whenever we get our date in.
 Yeah.
 Sure.
 Hey, what are you doing tonight?
 Hey, show me photos of your father's coffin.
 All right, baby.
 (laughing)
 But I must have looked weird
 'cause to my knowledge, nobody else was taking photos.
 But I thought, you know what?
  </li><li>You're just documenting things for us.
  </li><li>I'm documenting it.
  </li><li>Yeah, thank you.
  </li><li>It was my dad, so.
 So yeah, that was that.
 Then went to the church service
 and gave the eulogy.
 I basically speak on behalf of my sisters and I,
 and we talk about my dad and--
  </li><li>Which you did for your mom as well.
  </li><li>Which I did for my mom.
 My mom's was really easy, I think probably,
 because I had a year to think about it.
 And we went over, the doctor said, "You need to call a family.
 She's not going to last much more than 10 days."
 And then she lasted like several months.
 But nevertheless, you go over there, she's still alive.
 I got to speak to her.
 What would you like me to say?
 What are the things you don't want me to say?
 So you were thinking about it.
 Well, by the time I booked the flights to come over
 and see Dad, I had like two nights to think about it.
 Because now it was real.
 And let's not forget that life doesn't pause for you
 when tragedy happens.
 So I literally got on the plane and thought,
 this is a red eye fight, I need to sleep.
 And so I landed and thought,
 oh, now I only have a day to write the eulogy.
 And of course I've been thinking a little bit about it,
 but part of me was probably just putting it off
 'cause I didn't wanna think about it.
 But it gave the eulogy and you can listen to it.
 If you haven't listened to it,
 I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
 If that's the type of thing you would like to listen to.
 But I was shocked at what I got choked up about.
 Now, obviously you're going to get choked up.
 You're honoring your father.
 It wasn't the part that I thought I would get choked up.
 But basically in the eulogy, I say,
 to talk about my father without talking about two other people
 would be a disservice to who my father was.
 And those two people of course was my mom and the Lord Jesus.
 And I thought I would have lost it talking about my mom
 because obviously, well, you know, love my mom to pieces
 and my mom and dad were one unit for me.
 and to think that he died of a broken heart
 and to think that she died on their wedding anniversary.
 You know, there was just so much poetic,
 emotional punch in that.
 But what moved me was when I started talking about my dad's
 relationship with Jesus.
 And I just couldn't keep it together.
 I actually edited the eulogy because in real life,
 there were large, long gaps with lots of sniffs.
  </li><li>I didn't know that.
 I heard the eulogy, obviously,
 you posted on Facebook. But it's mostly you looking at pictures, like you're looking at
 pictures while you're talking. I had no idea you'd edit it. It's sneaky.
 Well, nobody wants to listen to somebody go, "See, how would you like 10 minutes of that?"
 Well, it's real. It's real, but it's the equivalent of Photoshop for audio. So I shrunk that down.
 And then what's weird is, so you go to the grave, you do eulogy, and then you get in a car and you
 head off to a hotel and you just eat sausage rolls and sandwiches. I'm thinking, no.
 Sausage rolls. That sounds disgusting. You know what? I'm going to have to rebuke you right now.
 A Scottish sausage roll is a thing of beauty. Is it haggis? No, it's just plain old pork that's
 cold. It doesn't sound that great. Sorry, babe. I'm going to have to rebuke you and say,
 that sounds disgusting. I'll admit this sounds terrible, but it was great. And then they had
 like strawberry tarts. And anyway, I just thought it's a shame that somebody has to die before we
 can go to a hotel and stuff our faces with food. But right. Again, that was good. And here's a
 thing that I didn't realize. I always knew what my dad did. He was a research scientist, a plant
 virologist. But that literally was the sum total of my knowledge. So his boss, his head of department
 came and talked about my dad and then all his colleagues came up to me and just said,
 "Your dad was a rock star."
 Your dad was a literal genius in our field.
 Everyone knew he was...
 He was the plant virology rock star.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I think everybody knew he was a Hidden McJagger somewhere.
 Yeah.
 But anyway, that was...
 Yeah, that was...
 And that all happens in one day.
 And you're slightly jet lagged.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it's a full day, isn't it?
 And then it was weird because you're on another time zone.
 Yes.
 So by the time you wake up, I've lived half my day.
 So that was just weird.
 Yeah, I don't enjoy being apart from you in 10 days when I think that's the longest we've ever been apart.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 I think so, because I think for your mom's funeral, you'd only gone for eight days.
 And before that, we had only been apart for four days.
 I love that you keep hold of information like this.
 In 2007.
 Yeah, I don't remember 2007.
 It was strange.
 So that was the funeral.
 But what was the rest of your time in Scotland, like other than many trips to
 pizza express?
 Come on, confess.
 I did many trips to pizza express.
 It's one of the things I miss greatly and marshal Spencer's the food
 Emporium where I went and visited.
 Um, it was, you know, it was, it was, it was so redemptive.
 Good. It was weird because so many memories got triggered by things I didn't know or anticipate things like the fabrics off and I'd get into bed.
 And the sheets smell like they did is a little boy, same fabrics after my mother mums evidently used for like 40 years.
 And I just like, oh, I remember this. And then other strange things like the dimensions of my house had forgotten.
 You know, I grew up in that house as a young boy. Yeah. And so everything looked massive. Well, now I'm a hulking, hulking Scottish man.
 "Oh, well now, now let's just say my frame is slightly different."
 So I was like, "Do I have to turn sideways to fit through these doors?"
 The ceilings are really low and just all these sorts of things.
 I loved being with my sisters. I think I said in the last podcast, I had this
 somewhat romantic notion of the four of us sitting around, remembering things and laughing.
 And it really was like that. It was wonderful to have three of my sisters, all four of us together.
 and just laughing, all being on the same page really,
 about stuff that we found.
 Interesting things that my mom held onto,
 'cause my blessing my father clearly neither had
 the emotional or physical energy to clean out my mom's stuff
 when she passed on.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>We didn't anticipate that.
 So cleaning out my mom's stuff and cleaning out my dad's stuff,
 so many memories.
 I'll tell you one of my favorite things, babe,
 was we found over 3,000 slides.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Remember old like 35 millimeter slides.
 Yeah. And of course, we never seen them or if we had, it was years and years ago,
 because my dad would have had to get a slide projector down.
 So we found tons of them and God bless my nephews.
 They scanned in over 3000 slides.
 Wow, that's amazing.
 And I got to browse through them and there are all these photos of me when I lived
 in New Zealand, our whole family lived in New Zealand when I was, I don't know,
 I was born 74.
 So three, I was three years old and a Cinefilm.
 Do you remember Cinefilm? No.
 Cine Film was like silent movie, that sounds terrible.
 It was like the first handheld video camera. It didn't record sound.
 It recorded it on to like moving negative film strips.
 And then you needed a projector to display it.
 Well, my dad had got that transferred to VHS and I in turn brought over some
 nerdy equipment to import VHS. So watching these slides from distant memories,
 It was just it was wonderful and watching me at the same age MJ is now with my father who is
 probably the same age as I am now that was weird that was wow that was trippy but but wonderful so
 imported hundreds of videos came home with 20,000 photos and 2,000 videos on a hard drive wow
 many many of which were previously unseen to me so it's a real really surreal but so
 I spent lots of time with my family, lots of time on my own with the Lord just walking
 around thanking him for my upbringing, thanking him for scondi.
 It was really weird leaving, thinking in all likelihood, I'm never coming back here.
 You mean to Dundee?
 Yeah, well certainly the house we're going to sell the house.
 So this anchor, which I'd never thought of is now no longer there.
 Right.
 So in previous years where I've left by my choice, I no longer have an option to return
 to what was previously there and perhaps I took for granted. So that was weird.
 Yeah, that makes sense though.
 Can I tell you what my favorite thing was? Yeah.
 Sorry, listeners, as you indulge my therapy session here, I'm in my old bedroom, which is
 now my father's office. And I'm not a particularly sentimental person. So my sisters have been very,
 very congruent. Do you want any dead handkerchiefs or do you want his belt or his cufflinks or any
 of his books or his Bible and you know there's nothing that I'm being attached to really,
 nothing that I'm like, "Ah, no, I don't think I want those." But I'm sitting one night and I look
 up and I haven't seen this before but there's our family crest. Now I say our family crest but
 Jones is a very, very common name and apparently my father or my mother probably more likely had
 paid for, you know, the Jones family crest, the meaning, the historical meaning where it all came
 from. And as I'm reading, you know, this blurb about Jones, it comes along and it says this
 phrase, Jones means Jehovah has favored. Wow. And I'm, I'm just kind of left speechless because
 the whole topic of favor was something that the Lord had to drag me into. I was not raised with
 an understanding of the favor of God. I was raised with you, just keep your head down,
 you just persevere, you just plow through, and you hope to hear well done good and faithful servant.
 No concept of the delight of the Lord, no concept of favor or honor, any of those things.
 And so is the Lord who kind of ambushed me and was like, no, no, you need to understand,
 this is what I have paid for.
 This is something you're not receiving.
 And if I'm honest, the whole topic of exploring favor was a part of my relationship with the
 Lord that I don't think my parents had a grid for.
 Sure.
 one day calling my mom and telling her about we'd just been upgraded to first class. And I was like,
 "Ah, you know, we used to fly a ton, so to be upgraded was amazing." And my mom, you know, there
 was a, she didn't know what to do and she didn't sound happy about it. And I was like,
 "What button is this pushing? Like this is a weird thing." She thought it was luck, which is
 strange because she didn't like thinking about luck. But she didn't have a concept that there
 would be a space that God would be kind to you in a material sense. All the kindness of God was
 wrapped up in spiritual terms, which is to be sure. But anyway, here's me on the one hand,
 journeying with the Lord, discovering all this stuff about the kindness of God, the graciousness
 of God, the favor of God is something that's become very, very real to me. And in the middle of
 grief in the middle of losing my mom and now losing my dad and you know just packing up all my
 parents stuff and and either giving it to charity stores or or taking it to the trash.
 In the middle of this I discover that my name means God has favored and it was such a tender
 moment really from the Lord. I love that. Yeah it's one of the things I brought home.
 Not coincidentally, I spoke on favor this week at M&amp;A,
 'cause all this is with the four from my head.
 So if you haven't heard any teaching on favor,
 if that's peak your interest,
 I'll put a link in the show notes to it.
 All about favor.
 So that's enough from Alan, AJ.
 How was your time not podcasting?
 You were basically left at home with the kids
 and did my job and your job at Grey Center
 and parent of the kids.
 So talk to me about what's happened to you
 in the last three weeks.
 It was actually, it was pretty good.
 The kids did great pretty much the only crying was at night.
 Just they'd go to bed and wish you were there
 to tuck them in or whatever,
 but I kind of just kept them as busy as I could
 during the day so that they managed to make it through
 without really feeling your absence at every moment,
 if that makes sense.
 So I tried to take them on some sort of activity every day,
 which of course on the days that I'm working,
 and it was pretty tiring at night.
 But I was really blessed in that we have, you know,
 Kate who lives with us and Cindy who came over
 for a couple of days.
 And so it was kind of a team effort at, you know,
 Marshley and Troops as it were.
  </li><li>Takes a village.
  </li><li>It really does.
 And then, you know, some people brought us food
 and stuff like that.
 So it wasn't as hard as it could have been
 by any stretch of the imagination.
 And the kids did real well.
  </li><li>And you did real well.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You were amazing.
 Thank you. I came home and you were in one piece. I loved it. Yeah, I am in one piece.
 I'm trying to think what I did while you're gone. I'm working on a new course for Grey
 Center, so I did some work on that. You painted the kitchen. I painted the kitchen while you
 were gone. Your garden is full and overflow. It is, but I've just discovered, first of
 all, I thought I had two massive zucchini plants. And then it became clear that one of
 was definitely not a zucchini plant, but growing some sort of squash. And so we thought it was
 probably a butternut squash because the person who had given it to me had said it's probably
 butternut. It turns out it's probably ornamental white pumpkins, tiny ornamental white pumpkins.
 Okay, not to be a total gardening luddite here, but what is the point of an ornamental vegetable?
 Yeah, I don't know. Apparently we can't eat them. And if it is an ornamental one, apparently there's
 two, well, there's several different kinds of white pumpkin, but it looks like it's the tiny little
 ornamental ones that you just use as decorations or paint or on Christmas trees.
 Yeah, like what do they decorate?
 Like for fall decorations, people paint them gold or paint them silver or, you know, use them as
 Table center pieces and pull them up and plant a taco tree.
 Well, I was frustrated and I thought I'm just going to dig it up because it's taking up space for my cucumbers anyway, and if I can't eat it, then I don't want it.
 But I did think the kids would probably enjoy painting them or doing something with them.
 So remember when you're a kid and you're a pet rock.
 Yes, maybe they could have like a pet decorative pumpkin.
 Yes, maybe they could have a pet decorative pumpkin.
 -Ego guys, Merry Christmas.
 -But now I've discovered that it is a vining plant
 as apparently is the cucumber,
 so I have to build two trellises to help it grow.
 -I don't know what trellises.
 -It's like a grid thing that you make out of wood.
 Well, I could buy one, but it'd be so much cheaper
 to just make it and I like to build stuff.
 -Is it like a ladder?
 -Yeah, kind of like that.
 -All right.
 -So that they can kind of grow and not be on top of each other
 and still get started and that kind of stuff.
 So cool.
 So you gardened.
 I got into the kitchen.
 I painted a kitchen and you did sing.
 Yep.
 I also managed to catch hundreds of Japanese beetles.
 So, you know, it's been a full week.
 You also managed to behind the scenes plan.
 My birthday surprise.
 I did.
 I did.
 And that was really super fun.
 I posted something on Facebook.
 I just thought, you know what?
 This has been a pretty intense month for you.
 and I wanted you to feel like super celebrated on your birthday.
 And so I just posted something saying, hey, I'd love to get Allen a drone.
 If anybody wants to join me, kind of, you know, let me know.
 And this is how you would give.
 And I had to figure out how they would go to get me a drone.
 I wanted to get you a drone.
 And how did you know I wanted to draw?
 Because you talked about it a lot.
 So I sort of pay attention to all the stuff I talk about on any given day.
 But then you'll change your mind fairly quickly.
 And so I just sort of watched for what was the reoccurring, you know,
 want of your heart over the last couple of months and you just kept
 watching videos about what it did and all that kind of stuff.
 And then when the Michaela got a drone, you were all like, the drone.
 But by that time I'd already started the Facebook thing.
 And so I was pretty firm that I was getting a drone.
 Okay.
 Um, well, you did well.
 Thank you.
 Because I did want a drone.
 Well, I just posted something who did well was our incredible friends and community that all sort
 of gathered around and gave an enormous amount of money.
 An enormous amount of money. Can I tell a story?
 Yeah.
 So, you know, birthdays have been a weird thing, historical. You've totally redeemed birthdays
 because you're so good at it. On my first birthday with you, my thirtieth birthday,
 you blew me out of the water. I'd never been celebrated like that. You were astonishing. So
 you really redeemed birthdays. Historically, you really redeemed birthdays for me. So
 you used to be, "What do you want to do this year?" And I was like, "You know what? I'd love to have
 a couple of friends over. Just keep it really small and we'll just eat tacos because what better
 way to celebrate than Mexican food." And so that's what I thought was happening. And you were like,
 "Hey, just because you're away. Can I just try and plan things?" Wednesday, the actual day of your
 your birthday. We're going to go with Jeff and Becky. They're only in town for one day
 really before they head out again. So can we do dinner with them? I'm like, yeah, absolutely.
 Thursday, let's do our family dinner. I'm like, "Grange, I'm in Friday. We'll just have
 people over." So I'm like, "Three-day celebration. That's perfect." And so I got off the plane
 and we cleared it with my birthday. You were very, very sweet. You said, "I know you just
 like to buy your nerdy stuff." So here's some money just from the family, just from the kids
 and for me and just think about what you want.
 So I'm left going, oh, what am I going to buy?
 And you know, my producer just goes into skyrocket.
 So we got for dinner with Jeff and Becky,
 have a great night with them.
 They were traveling California, Jeff's now after Africa.
 And so, you know, we got a time to connect.
 And I come home with you and Cindy's baby sitting
 our kids and I walk in.
 And as soon as I walk in, I can see three wrapped presents.
 Yeah, which are not drone shaped.
 So, so here's the thing.
 Cindy was my epic partner in crime.
 So.
 And she's a good partner in crime.
 She is.
 She is great.
 First of all, she loves giving gifts and she's really good at surprises.
 So it's really fun to work with her because we were like the whole time you're
 gone, but also for the last two weeks, we've been texting every day about organizing
 things and then her saying, Hey, this arrived today and she's like a staff gift
 to them didn't you?
 Yeah, she's awesome.
 So we had a plan and our plan kept having to shift with, you know,
 "Oh, we're actually going to do this now. No, we're going to do that." So she was extremely
 flexible and ready to go.
 So I came home thinking, "That was nice to be with Jeff and Becky and I walk in and there's Cindy
 grinning like a Cheshire cat on ecstasy." That's a great way of putting it.
 All right, what's happening? And there's three gifts. And I can tell instantly, just by the shape
 of the box, I know exactly what's in them before I even open up.
 That's so funny.
 I just knew that's a subwoofer and those two are rear speakers for my Sonos setup. And I'll put
 link in the show notes to buy what sauna says because it'll change your life. And so I'm just
 giddy. I mean, not like Jesus, but like, you know, it's still life changing. Yeah. Yeah. So I open up
 the Shandsmith's card. I open up this card. And I read one by one, there's over 100 people in our
 community who have given an ad. I don't know anything. All I know is that's a subwoofer and some
 speakers. And I know how much that costs. And really, when you say 100 people in our community,
 you're talking about like the larger community because there's people that gave from Scotland
 and Canada and New Zealand, I mean just all over the place.
 It was astonishing. And when I say 100 people, that was 100, over 100 lines.
 And so that includes couples. And so I'm still working through my thank you letters.
 So I know how much subwoofer costs. I know how much the Sally speaker of cost,
 because you know, I've been dreaming and budging for years and then I just there's no way that I
 could in all honesty budget for those things.
 So I know how much they cost.
 And our subwoofer died what, four years ago?
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And so I'm undone.
 I'm just thinking, oh my gosh, and the fact
 that it's this specific brand and you knew all these--
 it's hitting all the little chat boxes of my heart.
 And I'm reading all these names.
 Some people from years and years ago
 that I've had friendships with.
 Some people, like you said, here in Nashville,
 all over the world.
 And I'm just undone.
 I'm undone by the effort that it must
 of taking to coordinate that in secret, I'm undone by the fact I haven't noticed, you
 know, I haven't even been aware. You said that there's people coming up to your church
 and giving you cash in front of me. And for whatever reason, I was blinded by the Lord.
 I didn't know a thing. Well, you know, it, I mean, both times that
 that happened, you were looking in the opposite direction. But I was literally like, I mean,
 taking things and just shoving them in my pockets, hoping I'd gotten it deep enough in
 my pocket, you know, kind of thing.
 You should have a pretty good radar for when things are going on, you know, suspiciously,
  </li><li>Yeah. - Nothing.
 And so, you know, I open up this,
 and I'm just thinking, this is so awesome.
 I'm gonna hook all this up tonight.
 It's gonna be amazing.
 And, you know, I'm a nerd at heart.
 So I just love any technology.
 I'm gonna wire all up. - You see nerd, yeah.
  </li><li>I'm gonna tune in, and it's gonna be amazing.
 So I think I'm literally overwhelmed at this point.
 Like that is hugely abundant, hugely generous.
 And I'm just like, oh my gosh, it's believable.
 And then Cindy pulls out this tiny little red box.
 And I think it's probably some sort of little trinket
 from Cindy, you know, it's like her little personal gift.
 Oh, and I want to get you this.
 And she is very sentimental.
 Like we're like opposite ends of the spectrum.
 So I'm thinking now she's probably got me like,
 I don't know, like a pottery toad or something
 or a thimble, like a keep forever.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And that's what I'm thinking is, you know,
 and it's wrapped up in a weighty much tissue paper.
 And so I open up and it's like, what's of cash?
 And I'm like, what?
 And so there's a couple of twenties and then there's hundreds and there's more hundreds
 and there's more and I'm like, I don't know what to do.
 So I just make it rain.
 I just thought, just, you know, just I'm uncomfortable.
 Here we go.
 Yeah.
 And she says, Oh, that's a little over $1,500.
 And I'm like, wait, what now?
 I just made it rain with $1,500.
 Pick up all those doll.
 Pick up $1,100 bills.
 So we find everyone.
 So now I'm like, wait, wait, what's happening?
 And Cindy's course, Giddyus can be.
 And she's like, "What are you going to spend it on?"
 I'm like, "Are you kidding me?
 I have a gratitude hangover right now.
 I can't concentrate.
 I can't, I don't know.
 What?"
 And just as I'm reeling from that one, two punch, she pulls out a case, and hands me
 a case, and I open up the case and it's empty, but it's molding for a drone.
 And I'm like, wait, you got me a drone as well.
 And the long story is the drone just got released
 about two weeks ago.
 And you'd ordered it, but it was stuck in China.
 And it wasn't due to come till Monday.
 So anyway, it's just this huge big blur
 that was like this, this emotional whiplash,
 being in Scotland, in grief, come back,
 loved by a world of friends and family.
 "Oh, it's just absolutely yo-yod."
 And then because God's so good,
 the drone got delivered the next day, was it?
  </li><li>Yeah, it got delivered early, so it came Friday.
  </li><li>Came Friday, I was expecting it to come Monday.
  </li><li>Monday, and I was like, "Wait, what happened?"
 And so I've been trying to play with it,
 but I put my back out a little bit,
 so it's hard to stand up, but I have played with it.
 But it's the first piece of technology I've ever owned
 where I'm like, "I really need to read the manual
 because I don't know what I'm doing."
  </li><li>Okay, I like it that you have to read the manual
 'cause I almost always have to read the manual.
  </li><li>Well, I've read the manual
 and I think shortly after recording this,
 we're gonna go out and spy on our neighbors.
 Wait, no, that's not right.
  </li><li>Yeah, let's spy on the neighbors.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>So anyway, needless to say,
 my heart is fully alive and loved by everybody
 who wrote to me to express sorrow at my father's passing.
 I appreciate every single tweet and Facebook post and email and text.
 Thank you so much.
 It meant a lot.
 And the other end of the spectrum, everybody who wish me happy birthday and,
 and then everybody who gave just so extravagantly, just undid me.
 And I, I so appreciate it.
 I'm, I am like a giddy nerd.
 I have my dreams on a setup.
 I have a drone and I'm currently doing a wish list of all the perm--
 I couldn't sleep.
 I had this like mental Excel spreadsheet in my head.
 I'm like, well, I could do this and then I could buy this
 and then blah blah blah, do this and then I get to buy it.
 So I'm just spinning.
 And you know, all these things are testimonies
 all about the goodness and the favor and the kindness of God.
  </li><li>I think it's quite fun.
 I loved, 'cause I videotaped you from the moment
 that we walked in.
  </li><li>I noticed that later.
 And so I had several people come up to me at church
 this morning and say how much fun they had watching the video
 and how shocked you were.
 Like they could tell you didn't know how to process
 what was happening, which was really lovely.
 I had to confiscate Cindy's phone though,
 because I think she thought she was shooting a documentary.
 So there was just a camera every time I looked,
 I just grabbed her phones and then I was confiscating.
  </li><li>The other thing that happened that honestly,
 I think I could, you know, send to the world's funniest home
 videos or whatever it was, was the toad and the sink
 and the sibit.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>So we woke up one morning, I'm trying to think it was like
 maybe Thursday morning or Wednesday morning or something.
 And we came into the kitchen and Kate said,
 And now on this episode of Strange Things at the Jones House,
 there's a toad in our sink.
 And it was like in the sink that the drying rack sits in
 under the drying rack sitting in the drain was this toad.
  </li><li>That looked dead.
  </li><li>It looked dead.
  </li><li>It's dry though.
  </li><li>We ran water on it and stuff and it didn't move
 or anything.
 And so of course you being the man in the house,
 we voted you for toad removal duties.
  </li><li>Right, which I was thrilled about.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So I don't know if we can post a link to the video,
 but you went to get kitchen tongs to get it out
 and it turns out it was very much alive.
  </li><li>And it attacked me.
 I mean, the reason I reacted the way it is,
 is it snarled at me and it pounced at me
 and I just calmly stepped back just to save my life.
 And there's nothing to see that's meant to me.
  </li><li>Is that what you're gonna say
 'cause we're not posting the video?
 Or if you want the truth,
 you can look at my Instagram account.
  </li><li>I don't know what you're talking about.
  </li><li>But anyway, so there was fun with that.
 and also I've discovered Snapchat filters.
 So that's also fun.
  </li><li>You are hysterical.
 Like you, and now you know,
 listen, we all have our own little idiosyncrasies
 that give us tremendous joy,
 but you will spend hours in the corner
 just giggling to yourself about all these Snapchat filters.
 The trouble is there's a couple of Snapchat filters
 that when you use them, I go,
 we get the knees, I'm like, oh, baby.
 Do you want to discuss which snapshot?
 No, but they don't get the same.
 It's not the one with the big eyes, big mouth and no nose because that one's terrifying.
 But you just love it.
 You just think it's the best thing since sliced bread.
 It amuses me greatly.
 And you're not even on Snapchat, are you?
 Well, I mean, technically, yes, I guess because I had to start an account, but I've never used it.
 I just use the filters and then create a video and save it and then post it to Instagram.
 if it's amusing to me, but I like the Fox one with the glasses, but it's gone now.
 So I don't know.
 I don't know enough about Snapchat to know whether it's going to come back or not.
 Oh my gosh.
 It's funny.
 So that's us.
 I think pretty much caught up again.
 Thank you.
 You wonderful patient podcast audience.
 I, I so appreciate all your grace, all the space.
 Sorry, we didn't get a podcast that last week.
 I really don't like doing that, but I did underestimate the power of jet lag,
 But I feel great.
 I'm glad to be back.
 We're caught up.
 Here's what we'd love you to do is send us your questions.
 Go to Alan and AJ.com/askalyn.
 That's how you spell my name, Alan and AJ.com/askaskusyourquestions.
 And next week we're going to wade through the most pressing issues that we get from our listeners.
 And you can get the show notes for this week at Alan and AJ.com/156.
 And then lastly, you had a bit of bad news this week.
 Your mom fell today.
 Do you want to talk about that?
 Yeah, I just finished speaking this morning, literally,
 and then got this text from my sister saying that my mom had fallen over and
 broken her hip.
 And so they took her to hospital and x-rayed her and it is in fact broken.
 Um, and then they gave her morphine, which apparently she reacted badly to.
 So they're trying to work all that out and they're taking her into surgery this
 evening.
 So apparently they're putting in a plate and two screws, but she is 81 and lives in a house with stairs.
 So there's just a whole bunch of adjustment that's having to happen in our family.
 And of course, I live really far away.
 So that's a little hard.
 I'd love you to pray for my mom that she recovers real quick.
 Well, baby, it's been great to be back in the podcast seat.
 Thank you guys for being with us.
 We can't wait to speak with you all next week.
 Have a fantastic week.
 Bye.
