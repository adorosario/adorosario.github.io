<p> I live in a days but got for Monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one sixty six of keeping up with the jones is this week we're talking about how to live for the next season without sabotaging the one you're in.
 And a jones you just walked in the door where have you been.
 I have been at a retreat center just outside of st. Louis with the ladies of south gate shout out to the ladies of south gate that's where you've been i was wondering you just disappeared i thought you went to whole food yeah last no no no no i was that would make sense why i was staying up late watching youtube videos and you were like turn off your phone.
 Did you make wise sleeping decisions while I was gone?
 It's impossible to sleep well without you.
 Oh, that's nice to know.<br/>
 I know. I just I'm like, where well, it's got its benefits.
 It does. Well, number.<br/>
 You can sleep like a starfish.<br/>
 I absolutely sleep in star formation.<br/>
 Yeah. Yeah.<br/>
 And I have no doubt that you do because you try and do it while I'm in the bed.
 I keep all my electronics in the bed rather than on the nightstand.
 So it's just easier to reach it, isn't it?
 And this is not good because I pretend I'm back in college
 and I'm up to like one o'clock in the morning watching
 dumb YouTube videos, which just,<br/>
 there's a couple of videos that I watched
 that just absolutely cracked me up.<br/>
 I mean, I was laughing out loud.
</p><ul>
  <li>But when you're in college,
 you didn't have three children
 that were gonna wake you up at seven a.m.
  </li><li>No, I don't have responsibility or a job.
 (laughing)
 So I was like, this is-- - Well done.
  </li><li>And then when you're away, like, it's hard to make,
 I'm speaking completely passively and powerlessly here.
 It's really hard when you're away to make good sleeping
 and eating choices.
 There's the words of a powerful person.
 (laughs)
 I'm like, oh, are we making good sleeping
 and eating choices when I am here?
 Much better, are they?
 Oh no, what did you eat?
 Oh, it's not what I ate, it's the volume of what I ate.
 What's here?
 And you left marshmallows here.
 You asked me to buy marshmallows
 so that you could make s'mores with children.
 And we did, let's just say.
 There was some left.
 It was used for s'mores, yes.
 But then there any left no there's no don't be ridiculous.
 That's our any left baby.
 It was fueled.
 I bought a massive bag of marshmallows.
 Did you see how tiny the house was Friday?
 Did you see how tiny the house was when you came in?
 Yes.
 The cleanliness of this house was fueled by marshmallows.
 Really?
 Wow.
 I'm happy to buy marshmallows anytime.
 But it was so I mean I just want to tell you people I walked into an immaculate house
 And it just made my heart sing because nothing's screaming at me.
 It's beautiful.
 I had a really interesting conversation with the kids while you're away.
 Oh, about love tanks.
 Oh, and when age is away, the easiest way for me to get through the weekend
 is just to have a plan and our kids love a plan.
 And so we, I just fill up the days with enough activities
 where I get space and they don't feel neglected.
 So for example, Saturday, they knew the plan at 11.30.
 We're going to go to Chick-fil-A, 12.10.
 we're going to go to the Lego Ninjago movie, then we had to go best bite, then we had to
 go Walgreens, then we're going to hang out with his Isis at 3.30, then we're going to
 come home, then we're going to have burgers with Richard and Michelle, and then we're
 going to do s'mores, and then we're going to go bed. So they know it. And so, you know,
 they're awake at seven. And I just say, this is the plan. Can daddy have between seven
 and 11.30 to himself? And they're like, Yep. And they just go off and play on our iPads.
 And at 11.30, they come downstairs and they're dressed and they're ready to go. And I'm like,
 This is amazing.
 But anyway, we go to the Legon and Jago movie
 and we come out and they're in the car
 and Abby, who's our oldest, she's like,
 now they're all quite emotionally fluent.
 They're all like in the movie,
 and in the movie, there's like a father-son scene.
 MJ gets out with his seat, comes over to me,
 crawls up into my lap and then says,
 "I think I'd like to cry now."
 (laughs)
 So they're all quite emotionally fluent,
 But Abby especially, she's picked up on words of affirmation.
 So she gets in the car and she says,
 "Daddy, thank you so much for making this a fun day for us.
 Thank you for taking us to see the Legon and Jago movie."
 And then the rest of them follow her lead
 and they're like, "Yeah, thank you, daddy, that was lovely."
 And I was like, "Oh guys, thank you."
 That's really filled my love tank.
 And they're like, and MJ's like, "What's your love tank?"
 I'm sure he's thinking like tank as a rotary guy.
 (laughing)
 So I explained to them, like your love tank
 a container inside you that gets filled up or depleted by things you love or things that
 hurt your heart. And they instantly got it. And so I said, it gets filled in five ways.
 So then they all start talking about the ways their love tanks are filled. And it's all quality
 time, physical touch and gifts. And so they, we just, it's such a great conversation.
 I don't even know how we got onto this topic. Oh, they were talking about access service.
 And so today they said, Daddy, why are you cleaning the house? And I'm like, it makes
 mommy feel loved and they're like, "Oh, like she feels the way we do when we go to see
 Lego Ninjago movie." I'm like, "Yeah, that's right." So they're talking about love tanks
 and... But now, of course, Em just got a new phrase and he's like, "You just drained my love tank."
 [laughter]
 Awesome.
 Yes, well, he keeps us on our toes.
 Well, do you want to tell our podcast listeners about our really interesting conversation you had
  </li><li>Yeah, this week with our four-year-old.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we're sitting, actually,
 as having meeting with Richard Michelle,
 and we're meeting at our house,
 and MJ is there on his iPad.
  </li><li>Just in the background.
  </li><li>Just in the background, doing his own thing.
 And his hair is just really cute and fluffy
 when he's been lying on the floor,
 and he'd been lying on the floor.
 So I looked at the back of his head,
 and I just said, "Oh, buddy, you just have such a,
 "the back of your head so cute,
 "it looks like a fuzzy duck butt."
 And he was just like, you know, didn't really say anything.
 And then like a few minutes later, he's like,
 you know what my favorite word is?
 My favorite word is, and then he says the F word.
 And I was like, oh.
 So I said, and to begin with, I thought I didn't hear right.
 And Richard and Michelle, like just, you know,
 you're trying not to laugh or react or anything.
 Their eyes are like huge.
 And I said, what did you say?
 And so he said about again, he's like,
 it's my new favorite word.
 And I'm thinking, so I was like,
 where did you hear that word?
 You know?
 And he's like, I don't know.
 And I said, well, did you hear it from TV or anything else?
 No, it just came in my head.
 And I'm like, oh, fuzzy duck butt.
  </li><li>Well done, baby.
  </li><li>You just put it all together
 and come up with the most offensive word ever.
 So I was like, oh buddy, that's a really rude word.
 We don't say that word.
  </li><li>This is a good way to segue into
 A.G.'s new product.
 It's for children.
 It's learning the alphabet through customers.
 He is for no, it was so funny.
 So it was horrifying.
 It was no, it was equally horrifying and funny, but yeah, we just
 explained to him, hey, hey buddy, that's a rude word.
 And he's like, why?
 What does it mean?
 Well, it's just a rude word.
 You know, so, uh, anyway, hopefully he doesn't cheat till the other kids.
 You are.
 We apologize parents of MJ's friends.
 Do you say it again this weekend?
 Are we okay?
 All right.
 All right.
 We should be fine.
 He was on his best behavior.
 Okay.
 I don't even know how we got to this part of the conversation.
 You were saying you were away in St. Louis on the women's weekend.
 Yeah.
 Tell me about that.
 Oh, it's awesome.
 There's a church in St. Louis called Southgate.
 And I think we figured out this weekend that I've gone for the last seven years in a row
 and just ministered at the women's retreat.
 And they're, you know, I don't know their whole congregation, but their women are remarkable.
 They're a real tight-knit group and they really love each other and they're, you know,
 they're just really fun to be with.
 They're like party animals.
 So I know the men.
 I've done their men's weekend several years.
 And I totally agree.
 They're like all different ages.
 Yeah.
 And tight unit.
 They're just, it's great.
 It's really fun going back to the same place year after year, isn't it?
 because you get to build not just bless.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you get to watch them grow
 and see different things.
 And you know, so yeah, it was really fun.
 So just did a weekend of training on the prophetic
 and did a whole bunch of new games that I learned.
 And you know, so it was really fun.
  </li><li>It's amazing.
 But you literally just got home
 after driving for six hours.
 You stopped.
 At one point, I was so proud of you.
 At one point, I just said, "Hey, Siri, where's my wife?"
 And up came find my friends.
 And it said, "A.J. Jones is in Metropolis, Illinois."
 So then I zoomed in and I said,
 "You're a Superman square in Metropolis."
 And I was like, "Oh, this is too good to be tracked."
 So I texted you and said, "Where are you?"
 And you sent me a close picture.
 I'll link to it in the show notes.
  </li><li>Okay.
 It was really funny because everybody was like,
 because we just got out of the car when you sent that text.
 Like I hadn't even taken a picture yet or anything.
 And they were like, is he tracking you?
 Like how does he know where you are?
 And I said, he probably just checked on find my friends
 to see when I'd be home.
 And here we are in Metropolis.
 You know, I'm not really sure if it's in Kentucky
 or Illinois, it's somewhere in there anyway.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, I can't remember what state we were in at that point.
 We were in a tired state, that's what we were.
 So we took pictures in front of the massive Superman
 and just got back on the road and came home,
 but it was fun.
  </li><li>Well, welcome home, baby.
 missed you. Thanks, babe. Our kids were a riot. Good. I loved it. Good. We've pretty much done
 our weekly catch up all that to say that Monday and Tuesday we had Father Heart Week. You would
 ministering to the students on SSL and every time I popped in, it was amazing. Yeah, it's I mean,
 I love I love teaching the Father Heart stuff. So it was great and you know, the students are all
 leaning in, which is lovely, you know, they're they're really going for it. So it was a good week.
 It was a means been very full couple of weeks really asking me about my new technology.
 Do you have a new tech.
 I'm so glad you asked.
 Tell me okay.
 Okay.
 So on Friday Apple delivered a brand new Apple TV.
 Yeah.
 And that that names a bit of them is no more because it sounds like a television screen made by Apple.
 It's not.
 It's a tiny little box that connects to your television that allows you to stream movies or download movies from the iTunes movie store or from Netflix or Hulu.
 You can just install apps on it.
 We've used one since the very first generation when the first came out.
 Yeah, it's just it's a very user-friendly interface, isn't it?
 It's the thing that we use for our TV.
 We don't have cable or satellite.
 Are you turned on?
 I just said user-friendly interface.
 I'm like speaking your geek words.
 Baby, I love you.
 Okay.
 Pona's library.
 I'll say that.
 It'll be a very short podcast.
 Don't do it.
 Those glasses are my crib tonight.
 So anyway, Apple just released a new one this week built for 4k television with something
 called HDR, which is high dynamic range, basically shows more colors.
 And so I waited all day on Friday tracking it as I do, and then UPS delivered it.
 And the guy said, I've delivered about 50 of these today.
 I was like, that's good to know.
 So set it all up.
 And it's a little bit more complex.
 It's not Apple.
 I think the technology is super in its kind of early stages.
 So I had to turn on some special features on the HDMI ports.
 TV. I had to go buy a new HDMI cable, but now that it's set up in his stunning.
 I ate my dinner just a few minutes ago at nine something at night watching the screen
 saver of Dubai go by to look for two sharks in a swimming pool that are supposed to be
 somewhere in this room. Rumor has the 4k. They reshow all the screen savers and apparently
 there's one that flies over Dubai and there's a rooftop swimming pool with two sharks in it
 that you can see quite clearly. So that's going to be my homework this week to find the sharks.
 Well, take a picture when you do because I didn't see them this time and I'm a little disappointed.
 Okay. The second technology high that I have is I got a Nintendo Switch.
 You did. And so a Nintendo Switch, for those of you who don't know, is basically the next generation
 Nintendo game console. Like a Wii or a Wii U, we actually had a Wii and a Wii U and now we have
 have the Nintendo switch. And the reason I bought it is because it's a new Mario game coming out next month.
 And it's my favorite world to live in.
 But I like where not where you are.
 Mario Kart.
 There we go.
 I like Mario Kart.
 Which you said a couple of weeks ago and I didn't know you liked it, but you really like it.
 Like on the switch, you have been amazing. Our whole family plays it. All four of us.
 It is really. There's five of us.
 I know, but we take it in terms.
 OK.
 I was like, "Oh, dear, which one did you sell?"
 Well, I was away.
 Yes, I think it's quite fun.
 And it's really fun to play with like MJ and Tia
 and Abi, because they get so excited.
 Well, the fun thing about this version of Mario Kart
 is for the first time ever, you can put on like lane guidance.
 It's a bit like when you go bowling
 and you put the rails up on the side of the...
 Right.
 ...what's that called? The bowling alley.
 Sure.
 And so the bowling ball won't go into the gutter.
 Yeah.
 And so the kids can never fly off.
 And you can also have auto accelerate so MJ loves it.
 Yeah, because all he has to do is figure out steering.
 He can't fall off the side and he doesn't have to remember to keep it going.
 And truth be told, even if he doesn't steer it pretty much steers for him, it'll get him to the end.
 That's how he's beating me.
 And I just.
 But he loves it.
 I was amazed that you love it.
 I do.
 But but I sometimes put on the side rail things to.
 That's fine.
 Yeah.
 But the other night we'd put the kids to bed and you're like, Hey, baby.
 Do you want to play Mario Kart?
 And I was like, who are you and what have you done with my wife?
 We did. We played for a while.
 We did. I'm thinking maybe you'd get into the new Zelda game.
 No.
 But you have an outstanding judgment against Zelda.
 No, I have trauma.
 But Zelda.
 Well, thankfully I'm not really into Zelda, so I'm thankful for that too.
 But October, I'm looking forward to the new Mario game.
 And what's it going to do?
 It's like a champion's road kind of thing again?
 It's it's another 3D explorable world. It's probably not going to be that interesting to you, but we'll see.
 Oh, last amazing thing from this weekend. Oh, what?
 I discovered a new hamburger recipe and by discovered, I mean, I made it up in my head.
 I'm terrified. It needs some refinement. Okay. All right. Buckle up.
 So you bought me some ground beef. I did.
 It's made burgers. I said the usual thing. A chop to some onions, chopped up some garlic, threw in some soy sauce.
 You're salt, pepper, garlic salt, all the usual stuff.
 But then I thought, you actually bought some pepperoni for the pizza from the night before.
 So I finally diced the pepperoni and mixed it in.
 And it tasted amazing.
 Really?
 Here's what I need to do though.
 I need to add more pepperoni.
 I didn't use enough of it.
 But when you got a bite of the burger with the pepperoni, it was amazing.
 Really?
 Yeah, so I'm going to work on that for you.
 All right.
 I'll try it.
 I mean, I trust you if you think it was amazing.
 And I made Cajun fries.
 You did.
 They were good too.
 How did you find occasion to cut them up?
 Well, the secret is to go to Chick-fil-A earlier that day and take home a bunch of Chick-fil-A
 sauce.
 That's what makes it delicious.
 Well, you just cook normal fries and then smother them in cayenne pepper.
 Oh.
 But then you use the Chick-fil-A sauce to cut the heat.
 Oh, good.
 All right.
 That's going to be the longest, most rambling weekly catch-up.
 This is what happens when you record a podcast at 10 p.m.
 and we have been away from each other for weekend so we're talking about all the things that nobody else really cares about but we're like do i tell you i mean for your kids fries really that's amazing but this is what i love if we have people over for dinner right now yeah.
 This is the type of stuff we talk about we have the more for dinner right now we bad host cuz it's 10 p.m.
 We got a bad suggestion yep alright well let's move on to the main topic for this week alright so the main topic is.
 So full disclaimer this is absolutely lazy podcasting yeah but it is 10 p.m. on a Sunday night.
 You've just driven in from st. Louis yes and I have no energy and I've spent all my words well you have you used up all your words teaching all weekend.
 And also neither of us thought of a topic for the podcast this week.
 We tried we talked about all week and what about.
 Well, maybe we couldn't know, but you came in and you said, "Hey, baby, what did you speak on this
 morning?" And I tried talking about it and you were like, "Actually, this would be good for the
 podcast." So if you heard me speak yesterday morning at church, this is a recap of that,
 which may or may not interest you. If it doesn't, we'll see you next week. If you didn't get to
 hear it or if you would like to hear another version of it, stay tuned. The 10 p.m. at night
 version of it. Yeah. All right, babe. So hit us. What did you talk on?
 Well, here's the thing. I know when I come to speak, I have a very clear view of where I'm going.
 Like I love to teach. Like here's my objectives. You know, I just think from my lesson plan,
 this was not one of those mornings. I'd spent the week really with the Lord
 reflecting on a bunch of things. And I felt like they were like a really diverse thoughts,
 but they all kind of linked to each other. But basically, I started by asking everybody the question,
 "What is your relationship with God built on?" And the trouble is when you ask questions like that,
 it's all like easy answers like, "Jesus!" And you're like, "Yeah." But what I mean is like,
 "What's your relationship with God built around? Like, what is the focus of the conversation you
 have with the Lord? And is that sustainable?" Because I was thinking, if your relationship
 with the Lord is all about having your needs met. What happens when your needs are met?
 Right. Then what do you talk to God about?
 Oh, right. Like if your whole focus is like, "Oh God, when am I going to get married?"
 Well, then you get married. Then what's your relationship with the Lord about?
 Right.
 And so I was talking to the Lord about that and the Lord was like, "Actually, Alan,
 I want our relationship to be built around something other than need. I want it to be built around
 who I am. And I was like, Oh, I love that. That's great. And the Lord was like, and the answer I always
 want to give you no matter what season you're in is this is who I am. Like, I always want to
 reveal my nature to you. And the season you find yourself in is actually designed by me
 to reveal another facet of me so that you have experience with me in that way. Right. And I just,
 you know, I spent this, honestly, I spent a week with the Lord. And every time he would speak to me,
 No, every time, but there was several times this week when he would speak to me, or I'd
 read something in the word, like I'd feel like the Holy Spirit said, "Hey, go read this
 and I'd go read it."
 I would fall on my knees in awe of the wisdom of God.
 I was just like, "God, you're amazing."
 So I was trying to kind of share that, which I don't know if it translated well or not,
 but I walked in very, very full to share that.
 And basically God said to me, "Alen, I'm the great Redeemer.
 I redeem times and seasons so that your relationship with me is founded on something other than
 secondhand descriptions of me.
 Yeah.
 Isn't that beautiful?
 So good.
 So we, you know, then just kind of talked about that, talked about why do we find some
 seasons harder than others?
 Of course, there's external pressures, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 But I don't know who came up with the saying that if all you have is a hammer, everything
 looks like a nail.
 Basically the Lord was saying, if you've only ever lived in one season, there's a danger
 that you think every other season looks like this.
 Right.
 So even when I move you seasons, you still treat me, other people, your environment, like you're
 stuck in the old season.
 Yeah, that makes sense.
 He said something to me this week.
 He said, Alan, many Christians live with an Old Testament view of me while living under
 a New Testament reality.
 And they wonder why they're confused.
 And I was like, oh, yeah, that's got to be weird.
 I tell you what else happened.
 I was teaching the second service.
 I had that moment as this happened to you where you're teaching and suddenly you hear
 yourself saying the words and you get a whole download of how it applies to you that you
 hadn't been aware of before.
 Yes.
 I was I had to pause several times because I was like, Lord, I'm getting I'm getting
 not pinned by the revelation of what you're sharing through me.
 Right.
 So then the Lord took me to do to around me six in this passage.
 The people of God are moving from living in a desert to living in the promised land.
 Like talk about a shift of seasons.
 They've been wandering through the desert for 40 years.
 They're about to be taking the promised land twice in this passage.
 The Lord basically says to them, "Basically I'm about to bless your socks off, but I'm
 worried that when I do that, you're going to forget me.
 You're going to be so distracted by the blessings that you lose sight of the blesser."
 And that's something that I've been walking in on my own.
 before I read Deuteronomy 6, I was like, Lord, I feel like in the season that we've been in,
 like all this increased blessing is amazing, but I'm worried it's going to sabotage our relationship.
 Right, because it feels like when you have an enormous amount of need, you're having,
 you're discussing things with God daily, even if it is mostly out of your need, you know what I mean?
 But when all of a sudden you're like, oh, I'm not as worried about whatever,
 then what is your relationship with the Lord?
 Look like, and are you still having discussions with Him?
 Or is it like, well, you know, I'm doing okay?
  </li><li>Right. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Listen to this.
 The Lord says, "In your plenty,
 "do not forget the Lord your God,
 "for when you've become full and prosperous
 "and have built fine homes to live in,
 "and when your flocks and herds have become very large
 "and your silver and gold have multiplied along
 "with everything else, be careful.
 "Do not become proud at that time
 and forget the Lord your God who rescue you from slavery in the land of Egypt.
 Wow. I was like, and people who are regular listeners of the podcast know that we moved
 house about a year ago, and we're kind of stunned by the blessing of the Lord in this house.
 And there's a danger that you get caught up in enjoying the house or spending endless hours tweaking
 your Apple TV. So it looks amazing. Or, you know, I need to rip out this and re-upgrade this or hang
 this or changeable and you just get so caught up in managing or maintaining or enjoying
 the blessing at the expense of enjoying the blessing.
 And so I was already thinking along this line.
 So when I saw these verses, I was like, Oh Lord, you're so kind.
 And that is what I thought about the two ditches.
 You know what you're saying is if you live in lack, there's a danger that your lack can
 become your idol.
 Yes.
 thing you go to the Lord about is lak, lak, lak, lak, lak, lak. But when you enter an
 blessing, the danger could become that your idol becomes your lifestyle. Right.
 And the thing I'd never seen before, but I was raised to believe is that the
 lifestyle that Deuteronomy six and eight is talking about, like the promised land
 is the bad thing. So let me say that again, I grew up with, with meager
 possibilities, meager outlooks, as in, you should just be grateful to God's
 met your needs. You shouldn't be thinking about praying for nicer or better things.
 And that's not what God's like.
 And he's not generous.
 Well, you've got to stay away from that. That's all prosperity is teaching. Right.
 Like that's the bad thing. Right.
 Like the love of money is a root of all evil. And you know, so I grew up with this like,
 abundance and prosperity and well,
 if you have stuff, then that must mean that you love money.
 Exactly. Right.
 But I realized for and reading these passages, that's not the problem because
 All of this that the Lord's talking about is his design.
 It's not reckless living that he's worried about.
 It's about them forgetting the provider of the blessing.
 Right.
 So I was like, God, that's like, that's profound.
 I realized I had promoted lack as a way of keeping me holy.
 Like I was worried that if you do more than meet my needs, I won't be holy and I'll forsake you.
 Right.
 And actually, I was like, no, no, I'd like to do both.
 And I actually like to meet your needs and continue to have a relationship with you.
 Right. And it's almost like there's no faith in his power and ability to keep you either.
 Is there? Right. Right. But what's funny for me is all of this has been the Lord leading me into it.
 Yeah. And I'm like, Oh, Lord, you're so kind. So we talked a little bit about that. We talked about
 the importance of managing things well. And the Lord, this week starts being to me about,
 actually, I want to not take you from lack into abundance. I want to take you from lack into stewardship.
 Right. I actually want to teach you how to steward really, really well.
 And so I then kind of thought about what does that look like?
 Like how does stewardship prevent us from forgetting the goodness of God?
 And so I was praying I was like Lord help me understand that and
 that's when the Lord said go read Matthew 6 and in Matthew 6 is the famous passage where Jesus says
 basically when you give given secret when you pray pray in secret when you fast fast and secret and so I started thinking about
 the benefits I've experienced in my life from giving from praying and from fasting and I thought I
 Only used to give
 When I felt compelled to I only used to pray
 When I needed something and I only ever fasted when I really needed something and then I thought about the kindness of the Lord about how he's taught
 me those three disciplines over many many years in
 seasons where I don't need anything from the Lord and the benefits that those things bring.
 I think about the joy that we've experienced, especially in the last year where we've really,
 really focused on giving. We've always been tithers, but we said, "All right, we're going
 to tithe and on top of that, we're going to purpose every month to give over and above."
 Yes.
 And how that decision has protected our heart from stinginess and poverty thinking.
 Yeah.
 And I thought, God, you're amazing because every time we're blessed, we get to bless
 other people from it.
 Right.
 Which is so fun.
 And it keeps your heart pure.
 Yeah.
 And then I've been thinking about, I started thinking about praying, like we were
 teaching the students last week how to hear the voice of the Lord.
 And I was thinking about the wealth of riches I've received from the Lord in prayer.
 Like I don't pray because I need things.
 I do.
 I mean, of course I prayed the Lord about my needs all the time, but the vast majority of my time spent with the Lord is time spent with the Lord to enjoy him and him enjoy me.
 And I was like, it's so important that you have that as a discipline and good and bad seasons so that nothing moves you from intimacy with God.
 Does that make sense?
 Like, yeah, I just think if I got to the point where I didn't need anything from the Lord, would I still spend time with them?
 I would hope the answer is yes.
 I can ensure the answer is yes
 by having a disciplined prayer life.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
  </li><li>That's really good.
  </li><li>You look like you're falling asleep.
  </li><li>I am so cute.
  </li><li>I'm struggling, I'm so tired.
  </li><li>Hang on, I'll take my shirt off.
  </li><li>Much better.
  </li><li>There we go, all right, just concentrate.
 And then lastly, I was thinking about fasting.
 How when I fast, I'm constantly aware that I'm hungry.
 Like that's the most pressing thing in my mind, I am hungry.
 And then the second thought is, why am I hungry?
 Oh yeah, I'm denying myself food.
 Why am I denying myself food?
 Because I actually want something from the Lord
 that only comes through fasting.
 And I just thought, like, how genius of God
 to give us three things we can do in any season
 to keep our heart from forgetting who he is
 and what he's like.
  </li><li>So good, babe.
  </li><li>Thanks, it's better when it's not 10 p.m.
 And we're both falling asleep.
  </li><li>Sounds pretty good to me.
 And then I ended up sharing that dream I had about the 12 years of abundance.
 Oh, yeah.
 And I was amazed at the whole song and reaping thing.
 Anyway, I don't know if that made sense.
 Dear listener, if that made no sense, I'm going to put a link in the show notes to the
 actual message from this morning.
 All right, let's wrap up this bad boy.
 So as we wrap up, I want to let you know that we have a killer conference coming up
 at Grace Center.
 This is actually our having declares conference that we run every year.
 This year we have David Campbell coming and Gary Morgan.
 We've interviewed both of these guys on the podcast previously, so if you want to hear
 their testimonies or get an idea about their lives, we will put those things in the show
 notes so that you can actually find those episodes more easily.
 This is a little bit out there, but when I was thinking about that tonight, I thought
 about listeners who are listening to this podcast who don't live in America, and we're
 thinking, "I wonder if I should go to that conference."
 If that's you, I think you probably should, which I don't, you know, I'm not trying to
 tell you what to do, but literally as I was thinking about the conference, I had this
 vision of somebody listening to this podcast and thinking to themselves, I wonder if I
 should go to that conference.
 And if that's you thinking that, then I felt like the Holy Spirit said it would be really
 good.
 So I have fun with that.
 I think we're expecting this conference to sell out.
 It's selling fast with good reason.
 We're excited.
 We're just super excited to see what God's going to do.
  </li><li>No word of lie.
 I have to ask Gary before I can use these examples.
 Gary called me last week and he shared three testimonies
 with me of his last trip.
 And I burst into tears, one of the stories he told me.
 So I want his permission to be able to share the stories,
 but he told me testimonies of things the Lord said through him on that weekend.
 And their stories I haven't heard before, like, like levels of prophetic revelation.
 I have not heard before.
 I'm so excited.
 So really excited about that conference.
 Yeah.
 There's a link in the show notes to where you can get tickets, but we hope to see you at that conference.
