<p> I'm in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one seventy two of keeping up with the jones is this week with john bar friends tinkin sam all the way from melbourne Australia but first.
 Adjones tell me about your week.<br/>
 Oh it was a good week wasn't it I mean I suppose we always say that but it was it was a good week let's have a bad week it was terrible week.
 No, let's not have a terrible week.<br/>
 No, let's not.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It was a great week.<br/>
 I taught in brain science this week.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 On your on your two.<br/>
 It's one of my favorite weeks because it's a relatively new teaching for me.
 So it's it's always fun.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 To teach something new ish.<br/>
 And it's a week that I use more videos than any other week of any other year of teaching.
 Yes.<br/>
 And the videos are quite fun, aren't they?
 Yeah.<br/>
 If if you're like, I'd like to hear about neuroplasticity or how to change your brain
 or the effect of sleep and stress on my brain.
 I actually have a page on our website of all the videos I use teaching.
 I'll put a link in the show notes and you can, um, you can waste a lunchtime.
 Well, not waste a lunchtime, but do you know what I mean?
 Yeah, it wouldn't be a waste.<br/>
 It'd be great.<br/>
 Here's a bunch of videos you can watch some fun, all of them interesting.
 And you have fun with that.<br/>
 So that was that Monday night though.<br/>
 You taught at Emmonate.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 On a sermon topic.<br/>
 I can't believe you taught.<br/>
 I know it was a shock to me to never thought I'd talk about it.
 The Catholic Church.<br/>
 And yeah, no, I spoke using illustrations from the end times.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, and Mario Kart.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 No, but for real, you did a whole message on well, not on Mario Kart, but
 using Mario Kart as your illustration.
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Mario Kart was my illustration.<br/>
 Mario Kart.<br/>
 Well, I call it Mario Kart.<br/>
 I don't know what I call it.<br/>
 I'm all over the place.<br/>
 Mario Kart, Mario Kart.
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, when I said Mario, everybody went Mario.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>That's 'cause he says it's a Mario.
 Oh, it's a long A, a Mario.
 Mario Kart.
 Now it sounds weird to me any other way.
  </li><li>Mario Kart.
  </li><li>But yeah, you spoke on, I was just flabbergasted.
 And you went and got screenshots,
 you played the game in preparation for the sermon.
  </li><li>I'm not messing around here.
  </li><li>And you got video and--
  </li><li>I did.
 I filmed me playing, which was actually really hard
 to press the button while you're trying to capture this green,
 while you're trying to illustrate what, you know,
 I'd be like, oh, I have a green shell.
 This is one of the things I need to illustrate.
 I'm trying to press a button and then I end up
 letting go of the green shell while I'm trying
 to press a button anyway, it was, yeah.
 I'm not as skilled at Mario Kart as some others are.
 You got some captures for me though that I didn't get.
  </li><li>Yeah, but it was fun homework.
 You were like, go play that level.
 You know the level names though, I'm like, you know,
 Going camping has produced amazing dividends in our marriage.
 Yeah, come on.
 Well, you know, you speak my love language.
 I'll speak yours.
 Yeah, it was fun.
 It was good.
 You know what else was fun?
 What?
 You got your iPhone on Monday.
 I did.
 Scheduled for November 20 something delivery.
 Yeah.
 But it arrived on Monday.
 It did.
 Tell me your iPhone 10 review.
 Oh, my iPhone 10 review.
 I really like it.
 I like Face ID.
 Um,
 That's unlocking with your face rather than your thumbprint.
 Yes.
 So because my thumbprint often didn't work for me, I think because I've burned my fingers
 so much when I was serving tables, often thumbprint things are their hit and miss for me.
 But my face, I didn't burn while serving.
 So it works just fine.
 Does that mean I will no longer look over and see you punching in your pin?
 Well, yes.
 Because you would punch in your eye, I'd no answers.
 So you like face ID?
 Yes.
 But I'm just telling you, my thumbprints, they're kind of gone.
 when we went to go get our green cards. They had such a hard time getting my prints.
 I remember.
 Okay.
 But for said, do you like what else you like?
 I like the big screen. I like how colorful it is.
 It's a beautiful screen.
 Oh, it's such a nice screen.
 Do you like the fact it's a smaller physical device?
 I do. It fits my pocket way better.
 Cameras?
 Beautiful. Lighting. Beautiful.
 Yeah, I love it. Great. Great phone.
 So no regrets.
 No regrets.
 What about, I've had a lot of people ask me, should I upgrade and I tell them no?
 Because I don't want to be blamed later when they're like this thing doesn't mark like the old one so.
 And you know like 95% of it is the same as the old one was even true.
 Maybe 85% of it is the same but the most common action you did on your old life almost pressing the home button to go home and there is no home button.
 Did that throw you well like for a day but now I'm told you to yeah so I can't I can't navigate it quite as fast as I could the old one but give me another week and I'll probably be fine.
 So yeah, I really like it.
 All right, great.
 It's good.
 Good.
 Then, mam and pamper came to town.
 Yeah, they got here on Friday.
 Bless them, their flight was delayed,
 so they got here really early Saturday morning.
 Poor sweethearts.
 We're talking about John and Carol Arnett, our spiritual parents.
 Two of our heroes, two of our favorite people
 that people used to live with and travel with are in town.
 They were taught at Grace End of this morning.
 Yep.
 and write the place which was amazing and then they're teaching at the school.
 This is what I love about the school.
 I love when people from Grey Center come to say Sunday,
 like, oh my gosh, that was amazing.
 Or come to a conference and get a couple of sessions.
 Be like, that's amazing.
 And I'm like, yeah.
 And if you did the school, you'd get a whole week with them, six more sessions with them.
 And so just tonight at dinner, we were talking about, you know, what do you want us to do tomorrow?
 And I'm like, and they're talking about what they want to share.
 And I'm like, I'm so excited for our students.
 This is amazing.
 So it's going to be so good.
 Yet another reason to come do the school supernatural life.
 There you go.
 Applications are actually open.
 They are.
 Yeah.
 We already have applications for both year one and year two.
 So if you've been thinking about it now is it time to apply plenty of time to fundraise?
 Yeah.
 What what a bunch of birthdays in our house this week?
 Yeah.
 It was MJ's birthday on Wednesday.
 Who's five?
 He is.
 He's so sweet.
 Oh, he's unbelievable.
 Just so earnest.
 And we had his birthday party here on Saturday.
 So that was that was very fun.
 They just basically had a Mario Kart competition and then a dance party competition.
 Then we did pizza, cake, open presents and off you go.
 Yeah, it went pretty quick for two hours of noise.
 It did. It did. But children are loud.
 They're so loud. Oh my gosh.
 But he was thrilled.
 He was just over the moon. He loved it.
 I've never seen anybody so excited for $12 worth of party decorations.
 Yeah.
 I'm like $12 buys a lot of joy.
 Yeah.
 Well, boy, we just get the whole party and Spider-Man, except the gift bags that ran out of
 legitimately.
 I went to Walmart picked up, you know, the supplies, you know, Spider-Man plate,
 Spider-Man tablecloth, Spider-Man balloon, Spider-Man, but what do you call them?
 I think from the ceiling.
 Yeah.
 Spider-Man wall decorations as happy birthday.
 And then about like party favors, you know, the cheap nonsense that you put in a bag and kids seem to like.
 And so that's great, but I didn't have any party bags.
 And so I searched high and low, no party bags.
 The only choice was Paw Patrol or Batman.
 And I'm thinking I can't do Paw Patrol, but I'm actually more inclined to do
 Paw Patrol than I am Batman because of the whole Marvel DC comics.
 OK, but it was a superhero party.
 So they none of them caught that.
 It only bothered you.
 Well, that's what makes me worry about the youth of America.
 Like we're in.
 But we had Batman here.
 and spider man together playing well this is the weird thing i was not i was not aware that you
 didn't fight it every week to come dress a super heroes so in the first child showed up i was like
 oh my gosh this child's gonna feel like i'm more on the part because we didn't dress any of our kids
 told you you did not i did and i said to mj do you want to dress up in one of your outfits and he's
 like no i just want to wear my batman shirt so well i was not prepared for that so all these kids
 to shoot up and I feel so dumb.
 And then I was like, oh, wait, no, this was probably a thing.
 And I just didn't know about it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it was a thing.
 And then we did some family pictures, which I have to say,
 went brilliantly.
 I pause because oftentimes family--
 maybe it's just because our kids are older.
 In the times before when we tried to do family photos,
 I'm just like, I'm not sure this is worth it.
 Right.
 I think we should just Photoshop our kids in.
 Just go with some mannequins and a green screen.
 and then later just do some Photoshop magic because it was torture historically.
 I don't understand how your brain works, but okay.
 Yeah.
 What do you mean you don't understand how my brain works?
 Well, just so many things are curious to me.
 Keep going.
 It's all good.
 But anyway, it worked great.
 Yeah.
 And they look stunning.
 Yeah.
 And we'll just drown your social media feed.
 No doubt.
 You'll see them.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Our main topic this week, our good friend, Sam and Tinker, here.
 Last time you guys were on the show was episode 58, which is like a hundred and something
 episodes ago.
 It was decades ago.
 Wow.
 You were, if I remember correctly, and I should,
 because I just listened to your episode earlier,
 you guys were telling the story of how you ended up
 going to Australia, and you hadn't yet gone.
 You were just heading away out.
 So I thought it'd be fun to catch up,
 to find out how has it all worked out?
 How long have you been in Australia for?
  </li><li>Two years now, I think, since that episode,
 two and a half, yeah.
  </li><li>Good night.
 And so if you haven't met these guys,
 guys introduce yourselves, tell us a little bit
 about you, where you from and what you do for a living.
  </li><li>Well, I'm Sam McLeod.
 I'm actually from Tennessee.
 I grew up in Smyrna.
  </li><li>Woo hoo!
  </li><li>Yeah, it's a nice little redneck town
 where I'm outside at Nashville.
  </li><li>Nashville?
  </li><li>Yeah, and that's me.
 Tink, do you wanna say who you are?
  </li><li>No, you introduced her.
  </li><li>She is Tink.
  </li><li>I'm Tink.
 I was raised in Houston and then moved to Nashville
 when I was 16, and then that's when I met Sam.
 And we've been together ever since.
  </li><li>And everyone calls you Tink.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Does your mom call you Tink?
  </li><li>My mom calls me Tinky.
 It started as Tinky when I was born.
 And then Tinky--
  </li><li>So that's where Tink came from.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Wow.
  </li><li>Yeah, literally the day I was born,
 they were like, what's called her Tinky?
 And then I was kind of embarrassed of it
 when I was growing up.
 But then all my friends picked up on it
 and then my teachers picked up on it and here I am.
  </li><li>Tink. - Tink.
  </li><li>Or Tinkalicious.
 As I like to call you-- - Tinkalicious.
  </li><li>Or Shatinkua.
 you to pick one. Oh, yeah. When I was in school, people would be like, "Is that your real name?"
 And I'm like, "No, my real name is Chitinqua." And then I'd keep the straightest face. They never know.
 Yeah. Those are my space name for a long time.
 My space name. Oh, my space. Oh, my space.
 Oh, my space. RIP my space. So you guys, we met you through M&amp;A first of all.
 Then you both came into this school, Supernatural Life at various times,
 and then you were both staff with us as well. And then as the story unfolds,
 you ended up moving to Australia to live with a couple of profits.
 And tell us about that the last two years.
 What difference between America and Australia go?
 Wow.
 There's a lot of differences.
 It's kind of the same, but just upside down.
 So the seasons are all backwards.
 Like it's coming into its fall here, right?
 So it's spring in Australia at the moment.
 Christmas is at summertime, which is really weird.
 Right.
 That would be weird.
 How do you make snowmen?
 We don't.
 We make sandmen.
 Sandmen.
 Really?
 No, we don't. We could potentially. You can make snow though. I mean, that's also crazy. There's like
 snow on E-Mountain in Australia. So that's there. What are some other differences?
 Yeah. I mean, there's little language things that were hard for us at first.
 I don't know if you guys know this term "ta." No. "ta" basically is like an exchange that they
 say to kids and that got really confusing. So you're supposed to just say "ta" when you receive
 something? Like thanks. Yeah, like thanks. Yeah, that's a Welsh thing. Yeah. Is it?
 'cause I thought it was half of tah-tah.
  </li><li>Like tah-tah. - So, like tah-tah.
 So when I would hand people,
 I felt like I had to finish the tah.
 So they'd be like, tah, I'd be like, tah.
 (laughing)
 And then they would just look at me.
  </li><li>And they would look at us like we were crazy.
 (laughing)
 But so there's little things like that.
  </li><li>What about thongs?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>We were warned about thongs.
  </li><li>We were warned about a couple of things.
  </li><li>Explain for our podcast,
 essentially don't know what thongs are.
  </li><li>Flip flops.
  </li><li>If you're from America.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>If you're from Australia, you know what it is.
 Gary said something the other day with Abigail in the room.
 He said, "I'm gonna go put on my thongs."
 And Abi just looked at him like, "You're gonna do what?"
 (laughing)
 He's like, "Flip-hop, flip-hop."
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That is awesome.
  </li><li>So what have you missed most about America?
  </li><li>Mexican food.
  </li><li>Oh wow, that was quick.
  </li><li>That's bad and I, that is the thing I miss.
  </li><li>With no pals for that.
  </li><li>That is the thing I miss.
  </li><li>I miss Mexican food.
 I also miss like the culture of America,
 how everyone's really celebratory.
 They love to celebrate holidays and stuff.
 Not that Australians don't celebrate holidays,
 but it's really hype in America.
  </li><li>It's the thing we, as taking us years to get used to,
 that Americans love to celebrate.
  </li><li>Everything.
  </li><li>A cultural norm for me.
 So that makes sense.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we would, it would be like somebody's birthday
 or something and we would go all out.
 And they'd be like, oh yeah, it's my birthday.
 I'm like, but it's a big deal.
 Or even--
  </li><li>Look, we made a flash mob.
 jump out the cake.
 Just a normal response for us.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 In Fourth of July and Thanksgiving, those aren't things over there.
 Yeah, we miss American holidays for sure.
 We just do our own little solo.
 Fourth of July.
 Yay.
 It depends.
 And it looks like from social media at least that, I mean, you guys are both high exroverts,
 high influencers love to be around people.
 And you know, knowing the community that you had here, you had a ton of friends.
 the life and soul of parties. Everybody loves having you guys around. And it looks like from
 social media that you've firmly embedded yourself in that culture. Is that true or is that just
 social media? It was not easy at first. So moving over to Australia, we kind of realized,
 "Oh, we have to start all over and meet new people." But also I feel like it was the Lord
 to bring us there to just be just us, you know, and really grow in marriage.
 So we spent a lot of time focusing on us as a couple and that was really good for us.
 We needed that.
 Totally. Talk about that. Let's just jump straight into your marriage.
 All right.
 So I loved having a huge community here and I think that was the Lord too,
 but I think that in having a big community sometimes it was easy to get distracted from,
 I guess, home life sort of things like in terms of building your family, building
 like a legacy establishing like norms within your own little circle of family.
 That being distracted in the community, it was hard to focus on that.
 But when we went to Australia, we were removed from community completely and we had to discover,
 "Oh, we actually have to build a new community."
 But, you know, what actually we value because we don't have anything else to do.
 We're super bored together.
 So let's figure out like what is actually our values together.
 And so I think being removed from everything was really helpful for us to really focus
 on our marriage and on each other.
 Yeah.
 That's fascinating being super intentional about what are your values?
 So what did you come up with?
 What are your worth, Sam and Tink's values?
 Well, quality touch in physical time.
 I'm a man.
 Every man.
 Well, we definitely got to sit down and look at our finances,
 not that we didn't hear, but we were able to really plan and look ahead
 at what we wanted to do, as far as creating a legacy and creating, you know, a savings
 and all that.
 And so we got to figure out that.
 And we really got to individually spend a lot of time with the Lord, which not that we
 couldn't do that here, but being in a new place, you're kind of forced to slow down.
 And in that being separated from everything, you know, we both were desperate for the Lord
 in an individual way and then we'd come together.
 And it was like the Bible became 3D.
 Everything that we were learning was so much more intentional.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I think what was really handy as well
 is all the time we spent in the school,
 it was like being pumped full of like all this revelation
 and teaching and all this stuff.
 But when we were in the season we were just in,
 like, or have been in, we really got a chance to unpack it
 all and put it to use in really practical ways.
 like boundaries, you know, how to be utterly awesome
 in everyday life, those things.
 And what I hearing God's voice, all of it was amazing.
 So good. Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So it's funny that God took you literally
 to the other side of the world for you to find yourselves
 in a sense, because it feels like you're more,
 not that you weren't robust before,
 but it feels like you're more you.
 Is that a good way of putting it?
  </li><li>I think, yeah, definitely for me,
 I think that it's been a really growing time for me.
 I think for both of us.
 No, just for me.
 It's funny how you live sometimes in the shadow of how people perceive you.
 Well, well said, Jeez.
 So sometimes moving to a new culture, a new country where nobody has a preconceived notion of who you are,
 you actually get a workout who you are, redefine the perception of you.
 Does that make sense?
 Or it's maybe even easier to say,
 Yes, to what God's been saying about you because you're getting to define yourself for the first time with that group of people.
 So it's probably easier to say, oh, yeah, I'm going to stand up and be that person because you don't have the history of, you know, that you're worried that people are going to think you're trying to be something or whatever.
 The familiar.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Totally.
 That's a really good point.
 It makes me think too, like, because we're putting put in leadership positions.
 So I was drawing out a lot of stuff in us that we didn't really know was there.
 And all of a sudden, like, Oh, I do know how to teach because I learned how to do this.
 And now I'm it's being pulled on me.
 Oh, people are listening.
 I should prepare and like you just find all these things that are there that you
 didn't know were there because the draw of being put in a leadership position,
 but also with all of the equipping that we got from you guys and the school.
 Yeah, I think it was pretty amazing.
 We had Gary and Sarah here last week and they were on the podcast and we were
 asking them all about the school of prophets, which they were super honoring.
 They were like, actually, Sam and Tint came to us and said, "Hey, what's in your
 heart?" And they've helped us launch it. So talk to us about the journey of you
 guys helping these guys launch school of prophets and talk to me about your
 relationship with Gary and Sarah. What's it like being in a relationship with
 super prophetic people? You just go to their house and go, "You're fine, how am I?"
 Yeah, exactly. What do you see?
 Show me all you see is me.
 What is it like?
 I mean, well, with Gary and Sarah,
 we knew that going over there,
 our assignment was to serve them,
 and to do whatever it was that we could
 to honor them and lift them up.
 And so, you know, working through the church and everything,
 we also wanted to help them expand and follow their dreams.
 And so we kind of just sat down with them and we were like,
 like, what do you guys want to do?
 You know, I know that you're leading a church and I know that this is definitely the call
 on your life, but like, is there anything that is like a dream that's on the back burner?
 And then that's when they brought up the school.
 They're like, oh, we'd love to do a school.
 We just don't know how.
 And we were like, well, I mean, we could help you.
 And then from there, we just kind of ball parked.
 Really started fleshing out a plan.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Do you realize what you set in motion for yourselves at that point?
 No.
 No, so what you did, if the law of sewing, reaping is true, which it is, you basically just came to someone and said, oh, I'd like to make your dreams come true.
 How can I serve you?
 So you set in motion for some point in the future, a young gifted couple to come to you guys and say, Hey, what could we make possible for you?
 Thank you.
 Send them, Lauren.
 It's amazing when you saw your life in somebody else's vision, the life that comes from that.
 I can't wait to see what happens from you guys literally giving up everything to move
 countries to say, "Oh, I'd love to serve you."
 Talk to me about that because nobody loves to talk about serving.
 Like the least popular message I do is on the joy of serving, on the joy of submitting
 to leaders.
 And, you know, AG&amp;I's testimony is that the rapid advance that we've experienced in our
 personal and spiritualized with the Lord, I would attribute to our application and the
 revelation the Holy Spirit gave us about submitting to healthy leaders.
 Yeah, 100%.
 100%.
 Absolutely.
 You know, I'm seeing that in you guys to talk about that.
 Cause that's unpopular.
 Isn't that like serving?
 Yeah.
 Well, it's serving or just, you know, saying no to you, cause you're in your
 twenties.
 Right.
 This is your peak time for you to build your dream and your vision.
 And yet you chose to spend all that energy and time on somebody else's vision.
 Talk to us about that.
 Cause that fascinates me.
 I mean, serving is like something we've picked up.
 I mean, even from you guys, it's the thing to do, to go to where you want to go.
 I mean, so where you want to go, all those things that
 were those one-liners that we know.
 So where you want to go, to be the greatest, to be the least kind of thing.
 And I love that whole story.
 I think even Bill Johnson talked about it one time saying,
 "Jesus never rebuked the disciples for wanting to be great.
 He just said, 'To be great, be the least.'"
 So I guess in our heads, we're like, our vision will be revealed if we serve.
 of someone else's vision, especially if the Lord's calling us to do it.
 And I guess that's just a trust there kind of thing.
 Does that make sense?
 It does.
 Have you found joy in doing that?
 Yeah.
 I think so.
 I found joy, a lot of other things.
 I mean, a lot of pain, but I guess the pain becomes joy.
 Over time.
 I think pain is unavoidable in life anyway.
 So you're going to have pain no matter what you're doing in some sense.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like what do you do?
 There's tough seasons of life.
 There is pain and growing, isn't there?
 Yeah.
 Well, I think what was good for us was that we had vision,
 because vision gives pain a purpose.
 And so the whole time that we were over there,
 we had a vision of we know that the Lord has called us
 to a great destiny.
 But our purpose is to be exactly where we were at.
 Destiny is to be great, but our purpose
 is to be a daughter and a son.
 Yeah, totally.
 And so in being a daughter and a son,
 we were more than willing to serve.
 It was it was a joy to serve Gary and Sarah because we want to, you know, further the kingdom.
 It's not our assignment.
 It's the Lord's assignment.
 It's bigger picture.
 Yeah.
 About your million dollars.
 What's going to happen in about 20 years is you guys are going to be somewhere because he's great and he's kind and he's gracious.
 The Lord's going to give you the desires of your heart and people are going to come along and say, Oh, I want to be like them.
 If I do what they do, I'll get what they have, but they need to do what you're talking about now.
 Does that make sense?
 Oh, yeah.
 A lot of people say, "Yeah, I've got a great destiny," and then they go off to achieve it.
 And I'm like, "I'm not sure that's how destiny arrives."
 Yeah, that's exactly right.
 Maybe it is. I just...
 Not in line with Bible.
 I mean...
 With all the people.
 I mean, and that's why, I mean, the one thing I love serving is like,
 I get to be more like Joseph, if I serve.
 I get to be more like David.
 You know, everybody thought he was just a ruddy dude.
 Like, the runt of the litter.
 Joseph was a slave for crying out loud, and then he was accused of like adultery and
 Throw it in prison and then boom all of a sudden he's second in command of all the two,
 you know just like all those stories like I want to be like those guys and follow in their footsteps
 because that's what it yields you know. So not everybody has the opportunity to switch culture,
 switch countries and go serve somebody else. What encouragement would you give to people who
 are listening today about how to apply service in their normal everyday life? I mean serving
 serving under people that you look up to and also serving under people that
 You know, you'll look at the way that they're leading and think oh, I would do that differently
 But I think serving in serving in any capacity is going to further your walk with the Lord
 Yeah, I don't know it's somebody broad answers like humility teach ability like all those things, but I'm let's say
 I'm listening to this podcast. Yeah, I'm driving my way to work. I have a job. I go to a church
 How do I serve if serving is a key to releasing destiny?
 I can't quit my job and you know move to the other side of the world and serve and my point is you don't have to do that
 We can we can serve in any capacity
 What encouragement would you give to people? I mean serve exactly where you're at even if it's even if you're serving at a restaurant
 Like literally waiting tables like serve your leaders there
 You know serve at the church that you're at join the join the prayer team or learn from the people around
 do. That's what we did when we were here.
 Stacked the chairs, cleaned the toilets, things like that.
 I mean, I also just asked the Lord where to serve because I feel like He'll give you a call
 and then once He gives you that, then serve no matter what.
 So something you said just made me think of something.
 He said, "Stack the chairs and clean the toilets."
 I think people get the idea that once you're in full-time ministry, those aren't the things
 that you do anymore, which certainly wasn't our experience.
 Once you're in full-time ministry, that means everything's your job.
 Exactly.
 But tell me about that.
 You guys go over there, you're in full-time ministry, you just do the sexy parts of the
 job, right?
 There's no other stuff.
 Oh yeah, you've made it, definitely.
 Yeah, yeah.
 It's a breeze.
 Rockstar status, right?
 No, I think that's always part of it.
 Well, as soon as we, in our last podcast, we talked about the big dream and getting
 over there, that's the destiny.
 But then when you get there, all of a sudden you're hit with all the responsibilities.
 Now we have to lock up and open up.
 That doesn't look pretty, but it was a huge part of where we're going.
 I think Sarah Morgan's message at M&amp;A was amazing where she just said that destiny is
 hard work.
 I think people look at the ministry or if they want to be a musician or they look at
 being an artist of some sort or whatever their dream is and they think it once you get there,
 everything's great. But it actually does take a lot of work and that's not a bad thing,
 it's a great thing. It's something that means that you're living in your destiny.
 Yeah. I think you train for responsibility, don't you?
 Yeah. So whatever field the Lord's going to release you into, you're going to train for
 responsibility in those places. So that's what made me think, because over lunch when we were
 chatting and you were saying, yeah, there's been opportunities to stack chairs and clean
 toilets and do all this stuff that nobody realizes, you know, people are doing.
 They're probably just thinking, oh, but you guys teach too.
 You lead Atlas and you do this and you do that.
 Yep, but you also stack chairs.
 You know, and that's what serving looks like.
 You look for the gaps and you stand at them, don't you?
 It's all the private victories.
 It's the things that no one sees, but the Lord sees.
 And I think that's where the joy comes from.
 Yeah, totally, because it's always a pleasure to do those things too.
 I mean, sometimes it's strenuous, but at the same time, it's not like I'm gritting my teeth.
 Oh, I've got to do this again, kind of thing.
 Sometimes it is.
 You'll find that pain when you're serving really hard.
 And I think that most of the joy comes from seeking that affirmation that we need from the Lord,
 because the Lord is really proud of all those things that no one else can see.
 and that's where we get filled up and that's what keeps us going.
 That's what makes us want to serve more.
 Yeah, I think it's inspiring to me because I'm reminded that scripture,
 those who like pray in secret will, you know, reap a reward other than those
 who pray in public.
 And I'm like, I like the secret things a lot because I know that that's more
 pleasing to him than public things.
 Does that make sense?
 What do you think favor fits into all this?
 Because you guys obviously have favor.
 But how does favor work?
 I'm on this quest.
 understand that. How's it worked in your life, do you think? Because there's lots of people that,
 I mean, Gary Sarah travel around the world, and yet they called about you. What do you think it was
 about you guys? We asked them that all the time. Like, did you see something like, did you see like
 an angel standing up and like, pick this person kind of thing? They never say that that happened.
 Well, I mean, I listened to a teaching that you gave at Emminate about favor that really blessed me
 about serving and seeking wisdom and intimacy.
 And I think all of that is what we try to steward the most,
 is seeking wisdom, being intimate with the Lord,
 and serving your leaders and serving your friends
 and serving the Lord and spending a good deal of time with Him.
 And I think that the more time you spend with the Lord
 and the more time you spend serving,
 I think favors just a gift that God just kind of sprinkles
 on you. He's like, "Oh, you spend time with me." And it's not because we have to, it's because
 we want to, and as a good father, he's like, "I'm just going to sprinkle favor on you because
 you don't have to do this. You want to do this, and I want to do this for you."
 Do you think there's an element, and I like to think that favor's completely impartial,
 but I wonder if there's an element, and this is a question, where, you know, that verses
 as well done good and faithful servant, you who were faithful and little will be put in
 in charge over much. I wonder if if we demonstrate faithfulness and that attracts favor. I mean,
 I have no idea. I'm just kind of throwing out ideas based on the favor I see on people's
 lives. Like when we grow in favor, we haven't squandered the favor. We've used it responsibly.
 Anyway, these are the thoughts that pass through my head. I don't have an answer for it.
 Yes, I love to put to practice what you're saying, like in the little things, you know?
 I mean even like picking up trash on the sidewalk or something like that.
 But I know Tink and I really make an effort to try to do everything excellently, not in
 the performance or striving way, but just to a way to like chase down the loose ends
 that otherwise, you know, people would be like, "Ah, you don't need to worry about that."
 Tink and I're like, "No, let's take a second to look at that and see."
 Even if it's like a keynote image being like, you know, off center or something like that.
 So yeah, I think in the little things we always do that.
 So maybe that has something to do with favor.
 I think about what Josh and Sarah said on their podcast too,
 while I go like just following favor,
 like as doors open, walking through them and things like that.
 'Cause sometimes there'll be doors that open
 and like, I don't know if I wanna walk through that,
 but because it's opening, it's like,
 take a second to think about it.
  </li><li>Here's a question for you.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>If you each could go back five years
 and encourage yourself with something,
 What would you tell yourself from five years ago?
  </li><li>I would tell myself that it's not so much
 about the destiny on your life.
 It's more about the purpose of your life,
 which is about being a son of God,
 that it's not so much about what you're gonna do.
 I mean, that's good and great and awesome,
 and there's like a plan and purpose for it,
 but it's more about who you are to him
 and how you're meant to spend eternity with him.
  </li><li>I think I would tell myself five years ago
 to just not be afraid of who I am.
 'Cause I think back then I was very afraid
 of just being the raw tank, you know, vulnerable tank.
 And I think it took taking me to the other side of the world
 for the Lord to just put me face to face
 with really who I was.
 And I did a really good job of like, you know,
 being fun and all that.
 But there was a lot of raw stuff that hadn't come to the surface yet.
 And so I think for me, I would tell myself, don't be afraid to let that out more.
 Cool.
 I have a thought for you guys.
 And this is along the line of encouragement.
 But when Serengarrie were here, we were chatting with them.
 And at one point, it was just Sarah and I driving.
 And she was waxing on and on about you guys and just how amazingly you have done exactly
 what you're talking about, how amazingly you've served.
 She was talking about how amazing you both are at teaching and just jumping in there and
 not just the behind the scenes stuff, but the stuff with the microphone, like just getting
 out there and putting it all in the line.
 And when she was talking about that, honestly, I was just so proud.
 I was like, yeah, guys, you're going for it.
 And we are so proud of you guys for just risking it
 and literally flying to the other side of the world.
 You know, and just saying, okay, God,
 I'm jumping in with both feet.
 And it is amazing, amazing to watch you guys come alive
 like that or super stoked for you.
  </li><li>Thank you. - Thank you.
  </li><li>Okay, I know it's a good thing that I know.
 It's a good thing that can't see our tears.
 (both laughing)
  </li><li>Hold it together.
  </li><li>I'm a crybaby.
 Yeah, I love how the Kingdom works through relationships. I love that you guys and Gary
 and Sarah and me and AJ, that we all came to know each other through the Kingdom. We all
 came to know each other through relationship. I love watching what you're building in Australia.
 I love the whole premise behind school of profits. I wish school of profits existed when
 I was learning how to prophesy.
 I think it's an amazing opportunity.
 And I know that you guys are the backbone
 and the brains behind the whole thing
 and well done on that.
 And I just love your heart and serving too.
 I think you watch the dividends that that will produce,
 not only in the lives of the people that you're serving,
 but also in your life, in years to come,
 where the Lord says, well done, good and faithful servant,
 you've been faithful and little,
 and now you're gonna be faithful over much.
 And I've just seen it time and time again.
 And I love that you live in that message.
 Where can people find out more about you?
  </li><li>Well, we are about to launch our website for Atlas,
 which is gonna be atlasmelburn.com.
  </li><li>And talk to me about Atlas Melburn.
  </li><li>Well, I guess we were moving to Australia.
 We found out we didn't have a community
 and there was benefits to that,
 but we're also like, how can we make more friends
 when we don't have any young adults
 like in our church community?
 So we kind of thought of this idea of creating a young adult's movement,
 like group sort of thing for like a regional meeting.
 So we started this idea called Atlas and we made it up with our friends.
 And I think Jesse gave us a logo or something like in a day and within two
 hours we came up with this idea and then posted a Facebook event and then a bunch
 of these young adults from different young adults groups came or around.
 They didn't know you.
 No, they just saw it on Facebook or something.
 I don't even know.
 How did you like?
 I wish we had more friends.
 I know what we'll do.
 We'll create an event to attract people.
 We might be friends with it.
  </li><li>It was pretty desperate.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was a desperate moment.
  </li><li>We pretty much blasted Facebook.
  </li><li>That's amazing.
  </li><li>Messaged everyone that we knew
 and asked them to share it and that kind of thing.
 And then on the first night,
 there were so many people that we didn't know.
 Like just young adults from everywhere that had come.
 And so it was really cool.
  </li><li>Okay, I love even that
 because a lot of people just said they're in complain,
 you know, not to be mean, but they would.
 they would sit and complain about their circumstances.
 And instead of doing that, you go, all right, well,
 Holy Spirit, give me an idea how do we fix this?
 How do we answer this?
 And you become an answer to an existing problem
 rather than just another person who's talking about it.
  </li><li>Wow, that's a great way to put it.
 We wouldn't have seen it that way,
 but we still didn't know what we were doing at that point.
 We were just like, let's just have a worship night
 and gather young adults from different churches
 see what happens. And even now we're still trying to catch up with what God's doing.
 So the website that we're going to be launching, Sam had a dream about this actually, of creating
 like a resource place for people our age to just go online and watch a five minute video
 based on what we talk about at the Atlas meeting for the month. And then a Bible verse that's
 broken down, a blog, an interview. So we'll be uploading stuff like that onto the website.
 Sounds like you're putting together all your skills into an amazing pot to produce incredible
 food for Melbourne.
 Sorry, trying to do it.
 That's what we're trying to do.
 Yeah, I mean, we just really want to steward well with the Lord's doing because, yeah,
 look at you guys using words like steward and serve.
  </li><li>It's 'cause of you guys.
  </li><li>How do we clone you?
  </li><li>It's 'cause of you.
  </li><li>All of it.
  </li><li>Well, it's very sweet.
 I'm sure it's more than me and Ajam sure.
 Jesus, the Holy Spirit and your own.
 You know, you've stewarded things so well.
 It's amazing to see.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Well done.
  </li><li>Thanks.
  </li><li>So if people wanna follow you on social media,
 on Instagram, what are your tags?
  </li><li>Underscore Sam McCloud.
 And then he says with a question.
 I'm looking at.
 She does better than me.
 It's underscore Sam.
 That's.
 And then I'm just taking my cloud.
 Oh, and everything on Instagram.
 Out of girl.
 If you want to see Tink's dance moves every once in a while, she does some
 Insta stories that are just absolutely hysterical.
 Just for you.
 So no word of the lie.
 One year from my birthday, I was watching YouTube and I saw this crazy dance.
 And so I texted Tink and said, what did I say?
 You got 20 24 hours to learn this.
 And I did.
 And I did.
 Tink is an amazing dancer/performer anyway, but I just thought it was hysterical.
 I was like, "There's no way you're going to do that."
 And you did.
 Yeah.
 Where our instant flash mobs disappeared when you flew to Australia.
 So, you know, I'm great center.
 It's about flash mobbing.
 There's still on YouTube, though.
 Well, that's true.
 That's true.
 Or Vimeo.
 I don't remember.
 Sarah Pape sent it to me the other day.
 I was like, "Oh my gosh.
 That's from the past."
 All right.
 Well, thank you to our good friend, Sam and Tink, for being here on the podcast.
 If you want more information about them, check the show notes.
 We'll put links to everything that we talked about today.
 So babe, are you ready for this question?
 No.
 We'll get ready.
 Okay.
 This is a great one.
 This is an anonymous question.
 An anonymous right.
 My boyfriend really likes the TV show The Walking Dead and How I Met Your Mother, which glorifies
 sex and evil things.
 He doesn't see anything wrong with it because it's "just TV", but I'm completely against
 it for reasons I don't know how to put into words.
 What do you think about watching TV like that and what shows do you watch?
 Yeah, I would say you want to pay attention to your spirit.
 I don't think I could watch something.
 I don't think I could watch The Walking Dead.
 There's lots of stuff that even lots of believers that I know watch that I can't watch.
 So I think you want to really pay attention to content and how it makes you feel because
 you know, again, it's about eargate and eyegate.
 You want to be careful about what are you looking at?
 listening to. So certainly if you feel affected by it, you don't want to watch it. But I mean,
 there's lots of stuff I don't watch just because I'm like, wow, that's just making something
 sexy that God doesn't say is sexy. If that makes sense, no, that's the wrong way of putting it.
 That's glorifying something that God doesn't glorify. And so, but you know.
 Here's the thing. Like, I agree with everything you've just said, but the outworking of that is all
 deeply personal conviction of the Holy Spirit. Because the shows that you would watch, for example,
 I don't know, take designated survivor, right? The key for Southern show that you're currently
 watching. You love that, you feel no conviction when watching that. It doesn't freak you out,
 doesn't wind you up. It's a good, you're loving it. But there could be Christians who'd be like,
 I can't watch that because of the violence depicted in it, or I can't watch that for whatever reasons.
 Sure. And you can't, you're not expected to live by their convictions. Right.
 And equally, I could have friends who might watch The Walking Dead, for example,
 and I can't expect them to live by my convictions. So, everything you just said is great.
 You want to pay attention to what goes into your eyes and ears,
 and you also want to make sure that you've not dumbed your spirit. One of the things that I've noticed
 is what I watch often muddies my dreams or my visions.
 Yeah, well, that's a lot of why I can't watch stuff like that.
 Right. But anyway, I think you let the Holy Spirit guide you through what you're watching.
 Yeah. In terms of TV programs that we've watched that we like, I love the West Wing.
 The West Wing is awesome. Of course, that's Netflix, like it's older stuff.
 Fixer Upper. I love any DIY show. I could live on watching those.
 We're currently watching the TV version of Lethal Weapon.
 Yep. Yeah, we are. I've been watching something called The Good Doctor,
 which is like about a doctor who's on the autistic spectrum kind of thing. It's interesting.
 Is he a good doctor? He's a good doctor. He's sweet. He's sweet, but he has no people's skills.
 He's just sort of sets up. You have cancer. You're dying. It's a bit, and then everybody runs
 around and dries clean up his messes. But anyway, it's amusing. Christmas is coming up.
 I haven't even worked out how many weeks till Christmas. But here's the thing.
 I'm not ready for Christmas because we have to talk about this.
 you can never start your christmas shopping too early and i want to highly recommend
 aj's book called finding father it's a twelve week devotional study that you work through each day it's a big book but actually short read.
 Because you read a little bit every day and there's activations for you to put in practice every week the whole book has been designed to take you into close relationship with god.
 Literally there are five star views tons of them on amazon and apple's i bookstore and it's changed lives all over the world the consistent feedback we get from people who read it earlier.
 like, oh my gosh, this book absolutely radically changed my walk with God.
 We've got free two day shipping for everybody in the United States.
 And if you live further a field, we understand that shipping big books
 costs a lot of money. I'm looking at you, Australia.
 I'm sorry that it costs more to ship the book than to buy the book,
 but we also have versions for your Kindle, for your iPhone,
 and a very special edition for those of you who've got iPads and it looks gorgeous.
 Head over to allen and aj.com/findingfather for more info.
 and they make incredible Christmas gifts,
 would encourage you to get your order in.
 I think how good it would be to say,
 I'm done Christmas shopping,
 we can help you get a Head Start.
