<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hello, aji Jones.<br/>
 Hello, this is a slightly unusual podcast for us.
 Tell the people why.<br/>
 Well, because we're recording on a Thursday and normally we record on a Sunday.
 Why can't we record this Sunday?<br/>
 Because all of our things will be in a truck by this Sunday.
 One of our listeners emailed me last week and said,
 "Hey, your podcast sounded differently. What's changed?"
 And I'm like, "If only you could see our studio,
 "everything has changed."<br/>
 And tonight, which is Thursday night,<br/>
 is the last night we even have microphones plugged in.
 So we thought we'd sit down and record
 a slightly different podcast,<br/>
 but a podcast nevertheless.<br/>
 Because we're moving.
</p><ul>
  <li>We are, we're in fact moving.
 It's been quite the busy week.
  </li><li>Well, I was gonna ask you how our week was,
 and it seems like every, we have a busy week,
 but it's very fair to say this is a busier week than normal.
 Yes.
 Describe our days.
 Well, we have all the normal things that we normally have, but in addition to that, we
 are packing a house.
 Which means we get up early, very early before any of our kids are awake, do about an hour
 of packing, then get the kids up, have breakfast, go to work, and then come home.
 Yeah, have your normal day, then they go to bed, and then you pack until the wee hours.
 And that's because we've got some very, very generous friends who are coming over tomorrow
 to help us load a truck.
 And we didn't want to waste their time.
 We wanted to have everything packed up and ready to go,
 which we don't.
 We almost do.
 We have a lot of the house packed up.
  </li><li>It's hard for me to tell.
 I think all the boxes are obscuring my view.
  </li><li>It's only Thursday, but let's run our week so far.
 Monday we had M&amp;8.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But we're also returning our electric car.
  </li><li>Oh, it's so sad.
  </li><li>About three years ago, we took out a lease
 on a Nissan Leaf.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which is the first fully electric car we ever had.
 the only electric car that we've had.
 So it doesn't take any gasoline, it's just all electric.
 It felt like having the first ever iPhone.
 Yes, we felt very progressive.
 You could tell this is going to be the future of all cars,
 but we are leases up on it and we've got such an astonishing deal on it.
 We actually made money by having a second car from the money we saved,
 not spending on gas on having one car.
 Yes.
 But there's no way they can match that deal because...
 I still don't know how we got the deal that we got.
 So it's three years up, we're returning it.
 And that's that took place Monday, Tuesday was my birthday.
 Yeah, it was.
 Whoop boop.
 Yeah, that's right.
 42 years old.
 Yes.
 So it's a young pup.
 I have very young pup.
 So we went out for dinner at my favorite restaurant.
 There's so many good restaurants in Nashville, but I continually returned to
 the jail examiners, which is a steakhouse.
  </li><li>And what do you order?
  </li><li>I order off menu.
  </li><li>Yes, you do.
  </li><li>Why is that a huge surprise?
  </li><li>It's not a huge surprise.
  </li><li>They have a special that one of the servers told me about.
 If you ever go there and you like spicy food
 and you like steak, you ask for the 16 ounce New York strip
 that is blackened, served with drawn butter.
 If they have a special, which is the braised red cabbage,
 get that, it sounds ridiculous,
 but it's delicious.
 It's soaked in pork and then it's braised
 and then it's added with some goat cheese.
 Or if they don't have that, get your compari tomatoes.
 If they don't have compari tomatoes,
 get the heirloom tomatoes.
 But it's an absolutely delicious meal.
 And I devoured one.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So that was fun.
  </li><li>Very, very good.
  </li><li>Talk about Wednesday.
  </li><li>Wednesday, we had the staff fun day.
  </li><li>Very good.
  </li><li>And so we went to the escape game.
  </li><li>Now describe the staff.
  </li><li>Describe the escape game to people
 who haven't heard of this concept.
  </li><li>The escape game is a claustrophobic nightmare.
  </li><li>It's not though, I mean we had some staff
 who were worried about that,
 but it really isn't that claustrophobic.
  </li><li>Honestly, every time, I've only played it twice,
 but both times when they lock the door,
 I have to talk myself off of a ledge.
 (laughs)
 Oh my God, it's okay, it's okay, this is a game.
 I can get out if I need to get out.
  </li><li>All right, well, before you freak anybody out,
 tell us why they lock you in a room.
 because the whole idea of the game is that you have to escape.
 And so there's like six or seven different games
 and they're all themed.
 So the one that we played was like a kindergarten
 themed one.
  </li><li>We're not allowed to talk anymore about it than that.
  </li><li>So you're given clues that help you solve puzzles
 that help you escape the room.
  </li><li>I think I do it as a group.
  </li><li>That's right. And the idea is to get out of the room
 and as quick a time as possible,
 working together as a team.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And if you don't get out by 60 minutes,
 They won't let you buy a t-shirt that says I escaped, which I think is
 hysterically funny.
 Um, so
 now here's the thing.
 It sounds lame.
 Like the first time I heard about it, I was like, Oh, my gosh,
 it's so boring.
 And if anyone's done team building exercises at work, you know exactly
 what I'm talking about.
 And so I, the first time I went, I went with a super bad attitude gun.
 Like I just figuring that this was going to be a role play nightmare.
 Right.
 And as soon as they lock you in the room, something changes.
 you're like, oh, it is on.
 I was like, game on the poor guy that was watching our game because there's a guy
 that like kind of overseas and helps if you get stuck and whatever was like, sir.
 So you can't use your lock picks, sir.
 So removing the hinges of the door is not part of the game.
 For the gallon, just just ratchet it back a little bit.
 But it was so much fun.
 I mean, that's the second time I've done it.
 Yeah.
 And completely different games.
 But both times we have actually solved it and gotten out in time.
 Well, our team has.
 Yes.
 The team that we've been on has.
 OK, I feel like I feel like you're rubbing something in.
 Would you like to?
 It's just for those that may be listening that maybe didn't escape.
 The vast majority of our staff went on our staff day.
 And of course, that's a fairly large staff.
 So we split into two teams and one team was successful in escaping.
 And the other team wasn't as successful as they would have liked to have
 been. Well, they weren't successful and they were fairly frustrated by that, which I would
 be to if I was a moment for inner healing. It was. But anyway, all of that to say is a
 tremendous way to spend some time, which leads us to today, which was my second birthday.
 What about second breakfast? Very good, babe. Thank you. Thank you.
 Yes, we went and well, we did a whole bunch of random meetings and such and then got a little
 bit of packing done and then off to the cheesecake factory.
 And I didn't even eat cheesecake.
 No, you did so well.
 That's the amount of discipline.
 Or a rice or anything.
 Well, I didn't fancy any of it.
 But you did have tamale cakes.
 But they wereSweet 
 corn tamale cakes.
 That wasInstead 
 of dessert, I had sweet corn tamale cakes to start and they were divine.
 I just found a recipe for them, so I'm going to paleo that bad boy up and see if I can
 come up with something great.
 You know, two of my longest friends.
 Longest?
 like they're just really tall if you lie them down the floor.
 Well, longest in terms of long suffering.
 Yes.
 And longest in terms of age.
 Like you've been friends with them the longest?
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Is there a better way of me saying that?
 I don't know.
 Just longest friends.
 Yeah.
 Longest running.
 I don't know.
 Okay.
 They're they're actually jumping on a plane tomorrow.
 Yes.
 To come to America for the first time.
 Whoop whoop.
 And my sole goal is to give them a culinary tour.
 And I think it would be remiss of me if I didn't take them to the cheesecake factory.
 But there isn't one where we're going.
 Then we're going to have to make a drive because they need to see the temple that is the gluttony.
 They really don't.
 Oh.
 For those of you who've never been to the cheesecake factory, it's one of the first restaurants
 I ever went to in America.
 In the year 2002, I came out to Kansas City to spend a week at IHOP.
 And one of the very first places I went was to the cheesecake factory with none other
 than Sean Bolz.
 No, that's really cool.
 A little bit of trivia for you.
 There you go.
 And ever since going to the Chief State Factory,
 I'm hooked.
 It's ridiculous.
 The menu is what?
 It's a normal.
 17, 18 pages long.
 It's ridiculous.
 I just want to take Glenn and Anna there
 and watch them pass out.
 Well, I always order the same one or two things
 that I picked from because I refuse to read the entire menu.
 Baby, you are a woman of principle and that is phenomenal.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 I know it's very important.
 Jesus thanks you for his service for the thing.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 They do do something that's rather strange though.
 Oh, let's talk about that.
 Okay.
 This is the weirdest off episode, episode, ever.
 I apologize.
 This is so strange, but they, they really, really heat their plates.
 Um, and which I appreciate.
 I like having hot foods served on hot plates.
 Right.
 But they do it with the kids food as well.
 So they will put a scorching hot, like they can't hold it in their own hands.
 They're using, you know, towels to bring it out to your table.
 scorching hot plate in front of a two year old.
 That's not the funny part.
 That's tragic.
 The funny part is they put it down in front of a two year old and say, "Hey,
 don't touch it.
 Don't touch it as an exceptionally hot plate."
 And I'm like, "Do you want to think about what you're doing with that?
 It's cold and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
  </li><li>That's cold and blah, blah, blah, blah.
  </li><li>You have a high children, have you.
 So today I had a little chat with a manager like,
 hey, there's maybe a better way of doing this
 because actually it's really hard to keep your kids
 from touching the plate that they're eating from.
 And actually them getting burned isn't really the goal,
 is it?
  </li><li>Could we have a kids lasagna on a first aid kit?
 That would be perfect.
 And with the far-est thing we should on the side,
 I love that.
  </li><li>But bless him, the manager was like,
 oh yeah, I agree.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'll work on that.
  </li><li>We forgot to mention that if you focus
 on any social media networks, you will have seen
 that our good friend, Transports and Tribor,
 came by last Friday.
  </li><li>He did.
  </li><li>And spent a whole afternoon with us in the studio
 taking some photos of us.
  </li><li>Yes, he did.
  </li><li>Which, he's a fantastic photographer.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Really, really good.
 I don't know anybody with whose appetite to learn
 is matched by their skill to learn.
 You find lots of hungry people
 who maybe learn slowly, but Trent seems to absorb
 and put into practice his learning,
 like few other people I know.
 It's amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it was really fun
 and it was relatively unstressful.
  </li><li>And you'll see his handiwork in the coming weeks
 as we overhaul some of the photos on our website
 and on our social media profiles.
 Is that what they're called?
 Profiles, yeah.
  </li><li>I suppose.
 Should we tell them what our Instagram and stuff handles are
 case they don't follow us and want to or no or they could just look in the show notes for this week.
 Okay. We'll have links. You'll stick them in. Yeah, I'll stick them in. What is it?
 lnag.com/109 to find links to all of that. Okay.
 But today for the second, actually for the first time ever in our life, we sold a house.
 We did. That's a surreal experience. You go to your solicitor's office and well, thankfully,
 we had somebody who explained everything that we're doing. But basically you get cramped because
 because you sign a lot.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then you walk out and magically,
 money appears in your bank account.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I love that.
  </li><li>Quite bizarre, isn't it?
  </li><li>It was fun logging into our mortgage companies website
 tonight saying you have paid off your mortgage.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Yeah, that'll last for a whole six days
 until we start the next mortgage.
  </li><li>It's also weird because when we left the house,
 we owned the house and when we drove back,
 our new owners owned the house.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So we're currently living in somebody else's house.
  </li><li>Two.
 we move out? Yes. All right. Our main topic for this week is there is no main topic for this week.
 We're up to our eyeballs packing and we're in the midst of packing and moving us. We're also
 about to go on vacation, but we didn't want to leave you guys behind. And so you could go to
 here about our week. You're welcome. But I thought we catch up on some listeners questions.
 They're thrilled, I'm sure. We got three of them this evening.
 Okay. This one is for AJ. In fact, the first two are for AJ.
 Oh, thanks. This is from Amy. And Amy says, "We have recently moved for my husband's job,
 and I am currently unemployed and struggling with the loss of our church family. I feel
 I have no purpose and I don't know how to get connected with the church in our area.
 I really need guidance on how I can be a godly wife, a child of God, and contribute something to
 help further God's kingdom. Where do I begin? How can I get involved and how can I overcome these
 negative feelings? Well, I suppose I wish we knew where you were moving too. We might be able to
 to make some suggestions of some churches to check out.
 Right.
 But in the absence of having some sort of previous connection, I suppose it's just a matter of
 praying and saying, "Holy Spirit, would you lead us to the right place and to the right
 church and just trying out a few churches in your area and seeing what fits?"
 And if you don't find something that fits, then keep looking until you do find something
 that is along the lines of what you're looking for.
 Right. If I was the time to get to church shop, now would be it.
 Yeah. And maybe get to reevaluate what you want. And it's unlikely you're going to find what you had because all churches are unique,
 but you'll find flavors that you like, I'm sure.
 And then when you do find that church, then that's when you start looking at, okay, how do I get involved in praying about what areas is the Lord opening up for you to be involved in,
 you know, volunteer and all that kind of stuff.
 So I think the main thing is you have to find the place first.
 Right.
 But I think the other thing you can do is one of the things that I find helpful, especially
 when I'm being overwhelmed is to do a thought life audit because you said, "I feel I have
 no purpose."
 So it's good to arrest thoughts like that because of course you have purpose and just
 because you feel like you don't, that doesn't determine what you get to believe.
 So you really don't have to believe every thought that passes through your head.
 And so sometimes doing a relationship audit, if you've got friends and family nearby,
 I know you just said that you've moved, but you know, you call them and sometimes making
 your thinking out loud allows other people to help audit it and just go, ah, Amy, that's
 actually true.
 Of course, you have incredible purpose.
 And we call, we call thoughts that don't line up with what God says is true, ungodly beliefs.
 And so fun exercises often to evaluate what you're thinking and then find a biblical truth
 to counteract what you're thinking, to give you a different climate to think about.
 I'd also encourage you, during a season where at the moment you don't have a job
 and you're looking to do something to maybe spend that time with the Lord.
 It's not very often in life that as an adult that's actually what your season looks like.
 So maybe take advantage of it and just sort of be like, "Okay, God, can you direct me as to what
 to read or what to be studying in Scripture or can you teach me how to soak?" Or, "I would start
 talking to the Lord about what is His design for this season for you."
 Yeah, it is amazing because He says, "I'm currently unemployed. I'm struggling with the loss of a
 church family. It's important to grieve, especially when you're missing sounds like people who are
 really dear to you, but I had a horrible boss once upon a time. I mean, he was no, he was a horrible
 boss. But one of the things he used to say to me, and I hated it when he said it to me, but the
 phrase stuck with me is I'd always say, you know, I have a problem with this. And he would say, Alan,
 there are no problems. There are only ever windows of opportunity, which of course he was being
 facetious. But I've since come to learn that that whenever you're facing discouragement, or you
 experience a struggle, that's usually the landscape of the next miracle God's going to do in your life.
 So what I would encourage you to do is partner with the Lord, maybe take an afternoon off
 to just ask the Lord if you can have some dream time together and begin to tell him, first of all,
 Lord, this is what I'd love my life to look like. This is the kind of church I would love to see.
 This is the kind of community I'd love to be a part of and allow yourself an opportunity to
 to pour out what's in your heart,
 and then pray and ask God for those things.
  </li><li>Sounds good.
  </li><li>All right, well, I hope that's of some use to you, Amy,
 and to everybody else who's listening
 to the conversation we just had with Amy.
 Your second question, AJ Jones,
 and you'll see why I can't answer this one,
 this is from Nicole, and she says,
 "How do you go about writing a book?"
 Specifically, the process from having the ideas
 to getting them down and to organized well thought out ideas.
  </li><li>I don't know if I'm the right person to ask
 'cause I kind of cheated.
  </li><li>Tell us the cheat.
  </li><li>Well, the cheat for me was, you know,
 before I wrote Finding Father,
 I had taken sort of two passes at it
 and I'd gotten, you know, six or seven chapters
 in the first time and then just a couple chapters
 in the second time and it really wasn't the way
 that I wanted to present it, the information, and it didn't feel like what my heart was,
 but I really didn't know what I was doing.
 And then, you know, I just started really praying about it, like, "Okay, Lord, I need
 Your help with this."
 You know, I feel like You asked me to write.
 I don't know what I'm doing.
 And I ended up having a dream.
 And so in the dream, I saw every chapter of the book, and I saw what verse was on what
 page.
 So basically I saw the table of contents page and
 When I woke up out of the dream I wrote it down
 Well, I could still remember it like it was this week and then this week and then this week and then this week
 And here's the verses and whatever and I wrote it all down
 And then I used that as my template and I just wrote exactly that so I just use that as my like shapers guide to writing a book
 Okay, so that's super simple Nicole just go take some NyQuil have a dream go have a dream and write out what you saw
 And then just get the table contents.
 But for me, like the one that I've
 started processing writing right now,
 I just did a mind map.
 So I basically mind mapped out all of the different parts
 that I want represented, the different chapters or teachings
 that I want represented in the book,
 and then asked the Holy Spirit to help me order them.
 So I have a mind map that I'm currently going off of for the next one.
 So I don't know if that helps, but I suppose you could do it either way.
 I'm obviously doing it from a very shape, reprospective.
 Right.
 But then you would also, would this be true that I would watch you.
 Right without criticism.
 Like the first couple of times you'd write and like, Oh, this is dreadful.
 Oh, I hate this.
 And you'd add it as you were writing, but then you learned to just.
 Right.
 Without any thought of does even make sense and you'd pass it to somebody else.
 who would give it a pass and then you would revisit it.
 Yeah.
 And that's because, like I said, the first two times
 that I tried to write it, I just-I 
 literally deleted the book twice.
 And somebody who writes books said, oh, you never do that.
 There's always something useful in it.
 And because I would get stuck on the grammar or on the-I 
 don't know if that's exactly how I wanted to say that.
 And then because I was focusing so much on that,
 I would get out of flow.
 So I try and write from flow and stay, you know, stay writing when that thought or when that
 section is done, then I can go back and read it.
 Right.
 But usually I get somebody else to take a pass at it first.
 There you go.
 So there you go.
 All right.
 A question for both of us from Callie.
 Hi, Callie.
 This is all about life languages.
 If you're sitting here going, Alan and AJ, you always talk about life languages.
 There's a reason for that and it's because it's become the most helpful tool ever for
 us, understanding ourselves and understanding the people in our lives.
 If you want a quick primer to Life Languages, we recorded two episodes with Mrs. Allison
 Hendrickson, a certified Life Language trainer.
 You can listen to both of them by going to <a href="mailto:allen@agia.com">allen@agia.com</a>/76 and the second part is
 available at <a href="mailto:allen@agia.com">allen@agia.com</a>/77.
 like Sean Conner there, Shivern De Shivn.
 Alright, Kelly's question is, I took the Life Language Communication profile and scored
 as a high-contemplator with responder being right behind. I am seeking advice on how to
 walk in balance as a contemplator, how to not get stuck in my head, not overthink, know
 how much analytical thinking is good and how to turn my brain off. I don't want to exhaust
 those around me who aren't contemplators by my much needed verbal processing.
 And I don't know of anyone around me who is a contemplator that has walked
 through these struggles and overcome them.
 Do you know of any teachers that are contemplators that speak on the mind?
 How to harness it?
 How to think deeply, healthfully?
 How to see the value in analytical thinking, et cetera?
 I could really use their advice.
 Thank you so much.
 Who's I mean, I don't know if I could say that they specifically speak
 on helping contemplators. Right. But one thing to consider is most
 contemplators make excellent teachers. Therefore, many of the excellent teachers out there
 will tend to be fairly high in their contemplator languages. But I don't know if you're an introvert
 and I'm not saying all contemplators are introverts because that's not the case.
 but if you are fairly introverted there's a couple of excellent books taking care of your introvert or
 how did it get taken care of your introvert i think it's called up a link in the show notes
 is a really um helpful book but one of the things that you can help the people around you if they're
 not high conoplators and you tend to be is really work on your decision making skills so for example
 if you're going out to a restaurant with friends have a look at the menu before you get there
 That way you got plenty of time to contemplate what it is you would like and you're not holding up the whole table if for example that's something that you're finding that you're doing.
 That's good tip.
 Thank you learn that one why we have a drop box full of the restaurant for going to.
 Second thing is one of the things that can play is must learn to do especially if they're going to be in healthy relationships with people who are lower conanplators is they must return to the mothership.
 I am so guilty of this so for example let's take wednesday we had our staff day out.
 I used up all of my influencer within the first hour of playing the game i'm locked in a room with about fifteen other people.
 I don't have the option of going to the corner and just pulling at my phone and just going into bubble so i'm influencing and playing a game and connecting with everybody and encouraging everybody and being encouraged active participant.
 And by the time that 60 minutes is over, I have used up all emotional energy. The trouble is we're going out for lunch after that.
 And so we're sat at a table and I literally have nothing left. I know that I have a day of meetings after this,
 and I need to have emotional energy for the people I'm connecting with.
 And so I just retreat into my mind palace. I just completely withdraw.
 I'm saying sing at the table with people to my left and to my right but it's people who mostly know me and i just retreat but the people who don't know me i can hear them a couple of seats down commenting on all i was just totally withdrawn,
 and i'm like i don't want to come out of my cave and explain why i can do that later but what happened was the i was so over stimulated by the noise that i had to put my fingers in my ears.
 So this table with my thumbs in my ears just wishing the event was over not because the people driving me nuts not because of anything else was a very echo place with heart furniture it was so it was really nice but more than that i just had reached my limit.
 What a healthier version of that behavior would be would be to either excuse myself maybe go sit at table with less people and engage and be a little bit social.
 But one of the things we must do is as high con and players is of course go off and recharge and that can either be physically removing yourself from the room to recharge or in my case just.
 a mentally and emotionally remove myself from the circumstances but remembering to come back and rejoin the mother ship which i did once food arrived because food is great giving energy.
 So you're fairly high can't where do what what tactics do you use what also sounds like callee is not only a high contemplated but a verbal processor.
 and a responder and i wonder if the verbal processing comes out of
 and the responders need to be loved and need to be understood kind of scenario right
 so
 and they're sort of wanting to share what's going on and on the inside
 on the outside right and i wonder also because calle you're a high conan player
 and a responder. So my description there of being out with people and wanting to withdraw,
 because I'm a lower responder, I'm not immediately going to prioritize
 how I might be perceived. Whereas a first language or second language responder, you want to please,
 that's your aim. And so you may feel less able to appease your conanplator. That's the need to,
 I don't know, not overcompensate, but hey, look, I'm here, I'm connecting with you, but
 I don't know you enough to know if that's what you're doing.
 Yeah.
 So forgive my pops, I call it J analysis.
 Yeah.
 But it sounds like you are also wanting to befriend other contemplators so that you can
 contemplate deeply together.
 And I think we have sporadic moments of that, but for the most part, contemplator isn't
 the highest language or the easiest one to find.
 And so I'm also wondering if maybe journaling
 would be a good thing for you to pick up and test drive
 to spend some time exercising your contemplator
 while journaling with the Lord.
 Because you get to process still
 and certainly God is contemplative with you.
 and you'll feel heard and understood
 and be able to kind of get some of that stuff up.
