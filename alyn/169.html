<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is.
 Welcome to episode one sixty nine of keeping up with the Joneses.
 This week we're talking about time gap management, the vital skill for managing
 that bit of time that is now, but not yet where you want to be.
 But first are weekly catch up.<br/>
 That was awesome.<br/>
 Do you want to tell our listeners what you just said before I hit record?
 They need sex.<br/>
 I'm sorry, man.<br/>
 I mean, I do, but that wasn't why I had in mind.
 Oh, what was it?<br/>
 It's about what I'm drinking.<br/>
 Oh, oh.<br/>
 You purchased an entire case of apricot, LaCroix, and it is revolting.
 I repeat, absolutely disgusting.<br/>
 No, I don't understand this.<br/>
 Before we even get on to this topic,<br/>
 I would love a definitive list of lacroi flavors.
 No problem because it feels like every time I go to the store,
 there's a bad one.<br/>
 There's only one bad one, the coconut flavor.
 No, apricot is right up there with coconut.
 It's a little thing.<br/>
 First of all, it's apricot, not apricot.
 Well, the rest of the world calls it apricot, but if you want to go to apricot,
 I will. I will do some apes for you.<br/>
 The rest of the world.<br/>
 OK, people we need to hear from you is an apricot or apricot.
 You know what? I'm going to do one of those new fangled Instagram polls tomorrow.
 Oh, where it's like, yes, apricot. Yes, apricot.
 Yeah. And we'll see that the world comes out.
 OK, on the side of justice. But anyway, what's your deal?
 Why don't you like the apricot?<br/>
 It's disgusting. It really.<br/>
 Hang on. Taste test.<br/>
 delicious. No, it isn't delicious. To be honest, none of them taste like they say.
 Okay, but I like the dual ones, you know, like blueberry and, I don't know, water chestnut
 or something, whatever that one is, the purple one, blueberry and cucumber or something.
 I love it that it's also got them in French. Like the grapefruit is pomple moose.
 Yes, I do like to say what are you drinking? What are you drinking?
 Apricot because I opened it and I don't want to waste it, but it's like it's like torture
 It's not quite every lacrosse. I don't know my job right now. It's going right
 Picking up the crocans shaking them behind the third of your left and then throwing it. I resemble that remark
 um<br/>
 The the only one that I haven't been able to finish is coconut. It tastes like you're drinking suntan lotion
 It's so revolting. It's nasty. It's so gross and this is a close second. Well done son
 you get a whole box for yourself.<br/>
 Oh, I see your tricky plan.<br/>
 And then you bought peachy pear.<br/>
 I hate pears.<br/>
 So now there's two kinds that I can't have.
 Thanks so much.<br/>
 The cry fail.<br/>
 This is why I don't want you to let me go shopping.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I didn't actually in fairness let you do anything.
 I said, why don't you pick up some eggs so you can make waffles and then you're like,
 hey, I got some stuff and I'm thinking, all right, hold on buckle up with.
 There's no saying what might be in there that actually shouldn't be there.
 Do you want to know my whole ingredient list that I got today?
 I guess yes.<br/>
 Whipped cream.<br/>
 Yeah, I figured.<br/>
 I saw that.<br/>
 It's not even good whipped cream.<br/>
 It's the kind of a can that you shake.
 What other kind of whipped cream is there?
 Cream that you whip.<br/>
 Whipping cream.<br/>
 That's it.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Oh dear.<br/>
 Wait.<br/>
 So there's another kind of cream that comes readily available in aerosol can easily waiting
 to dispense on pancakes.<br/>
 Well, no, I don't.<br/>
 I rest my ears.<br/>
 I rest my ears.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Next thing I bought.<br/>
 I'm confused about this.<br/>
 Why am I supposed to buy grade B maple syrup and not grade A?
 All publics had was grade A maple syrup.
 Isn't A better than B?<br/>
 I can't remember.<br/>
 B has like less sugar in it or something.
 All right.<br/>
 Well, clearly I'm in the right choice.
 Okay.<br/>
 Then I bought cashew butter.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 What else did I buy?<br/>
 Yogurt.<br/>
 Yeah, for the kids and a yogurt for me.
 I was going to say for the kids.<br/>
 the new says for the kids the new says for me that them and their lunches tomorrow and being rewarded for what
 For eating a bag of marshmallows today
 Is that what you're being rewarded for to be fair to be fair to be fair? I'm a complete or finisher
 Look at the way I play<br/>
 Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh<br/>
 Okay, look at the way I play video games
 Okay, I have to have like all the five stars and make sure they're all shiny
 So you just couldn't leave that half bag of marshmallows in there so that we could have marshmallows later in the week
 No, because what would happen is they just go crusty. No, they don't they were all sealed up and a little bag
 No, but I opened them. Yeah, cuz you were eating them
 Well, no, they were they weren't leftovers from this week
 But I thought as a shopping trips go I did pretty good this week
 You did much better than you normally do normally bring home a whole bunch of things.
 I'm like why did you bring that random thing home and you're like, I don't know.
 I know I do know why it's because you never bring it home.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, usually there's a reason, but, but it's good.
 You did good other than the aerosol whipped cream for lunch today.
 I made the kids waffles.<br/>
 They were easily the best waffles I've ever made.
 And it's because I forgot that I had the mixer on.
 And you're supposed to be egg whites, too, like stiff peaks.
 I went past stiff peaks, a couple of stops past stiff peaks and ended up with what
 looked like a bowl of whipped cream.<br/>
 But for goodness sake, it made the waffles so light and fluffy.
 Anyway, the kids had waffles.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 With said whipped cream, aerosol with cream, yeah, with bananas.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then with shaved chocolate on top and maple syrup.
 And they loved it.<br/>
 And maple syrup.<br/>
 Yeah, all three foot groups.<br/>
 Okay, good.<br/>
 All right, let's do our weekly catch up.
 I feel we've got--<br/>
 We went off track here.<br/>
 It was a normal week, really.<br/>
 Well, it was normal.<br/>
 Yeah, we taught and then we lived in the woods.
 Yes.<br/>
 That's my new norm.<br/>
 It's your new norm.<br/>
 Two weekends in a row and it's our norm.
 I thought it was hysterical when you're like,
 we're campers now.<br/>
 And I was like, we are, but we've only camped three nights.
 So I'm not sure we can be called campers, like experts.
 When did I say we were campers? You said it when we were in the woods with all the peoples.
 Did I just proudly declared you're like, look at us. We're campers now. I was like, uh,
 yeah, I mean, I have had a ton of revelation about camping. It's an interesting exchange.
 Like I posted on Instagram, you swap comfort for exhaustion, but it's the kind of exhaustion
 that feels like I did something with my weekend. Yeah. And the kids involve it.
 yeah i just love coming home and you.<br/>
 You're dirty and you're grimy and and like the smorney woke up i don't know if there's i don't know if there are these muscles there must be i don't know what they're called you know you got your calf muscle yes what's the muscle to the left and the right.
 Like how we want to know if you pretend that your leg is a compass at north would be your shin yes south would be your calf muscle what's the east and west that's such a strange way of the game i don't know what i'm just looking no.
</p><ul>
  <li>With never eat shredded wheat,
 Northeast Southwest.
  </li><li>Okay, I don't know.
 We can ask Josh or something this week.
  </li><li>Well both those muscles that East and West
 are killing me, presumably because I was walking up
 and walking down steep inclines.
  </li><li>Yes, I have to say I could feel every muscle
 in my legs and my shoulders yesterday and this morning.
  </li><li>Yeah, but it's worth it.
  </li><li>I slept like the dead last night.
 I didn't hear you come in, I didn't hear the kids,
 I didn't hear Abby rolling around in her bed.
 Like all the things that I normally hear
 and wake up like 10 times a night.
 I heard nothing.
  </li><li>You didn't know, so did you make up
 while you were asleep last night?
  </li><li>And what a fantastic job.
  </li><li>It was amazing.
  </li><li>Move, what an interesting choice.
  </li><li>But literally that was our week.
 Monday and Tuesday, you taught when I taught.
 You won first year, what did you teach on?
  </li><li>Intimacy, so intimacy, like hindrance is to intimacy
 and then I take them first by verse
 to the song of Solomon.
 So that was pretty much it.
  </li><li>And then I was in second year teaching
 on the Bible, introduction to the Bible.
 I had a great time.
 I think I wore them out by the time I got to Tuesday.
  </li><li>Wow, you know.
  </li><li>And then Tony Wakefield was at Amine and killed it.
  </li><li>Oh, it was so good.
 It was so good.
  </li><li>And then Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
 we went back to the woods.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What did you think about doing for two days instead
 of just one day?
  </li><li>I liked, what I liked about two days is that you're not
 packing all of that stuff in like some kind of Sherpa
 and then packing it all out before noon the next day.
 It was nice because of the amount of stuff you travel with with five people camping to not unlike the Saturday to just chill.
 We we lied in Kate's hammock because she left it for us.
 Yeah, that's that's now up there like with food, he shelter and a hammock.
 I know I want a hammock.
 Yeah.
 I never thought I would say that.
 No, we need a hammock each.
 She had a, you know, or emo or something like that.
 I have no idea.
 Yeah, I'm going to look them up because apparently you can get them in all kinds of colors.
 So I'm going to get you pink one.
 I'm going to get you on an apricot.
 You're going to love it.
 OK, all the lacrosse you can drink.
 So we, I mean, it was fun and it was great because we also traded off a bit.
 Like I took to the to the park for like an hour and then you took them on a hike for an hour.
 So we got some alone time in the woods to chill.
 Yeah.
 It's great.
 Well, there you go.
 Maybe maybe our fastest weekly catch up ever.
 Do you think so?
 Well, I'll be with a sidetrack into why you don't appreciate me going grocery shopping.
 Well, that's true.
 That's true.
 Sorry, people.
 Why you have no taste in La Croix?
 I'm sure most women can relate to what I'm talking about unless their husbands are the people they do,
 the cooking.
 Our main topic this week is all about time-get management.
 I think it's such an important season of life.
 The in-between time, between now and where you want to be or what you want to be doing.
 Oh, yeah, absolutely.
 Because I think that season is always upon us.
 Well, you've never arrived.
 So there's always more that the Lord's calling you into.
 I think we're always in and in between season, babe, because you're, you're not going to
 arrive, are you?
 Like the Lord is always going to have other stuff on offer, other things that He's growing you in,
 other opportunities that He's giving you to excel, that kind of stuff.
 So technically, even if you think you've arrived, you haven't arrived here, you're still in a season of the not yet.
 Because we're always getting prophetic words.
 Yeah.
 I mean, just even on a practical level.
 So it was a time we had no kids.
 Right.
 And then we had one kid.
 Right.
 And then two kids.
 Yeah.
 And then three kids.
 Yeah.
 And as far as we know, we're done.
 Right.
 But at each of those stages, there was a time where we were and a time where we will be.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 So I think it's just such an important life skill to learn to steward the time really, really well.
 Because there's so many inherent dangers in the season of what we call time gap management where you're believing for something you don't have it yet.
 I mean you can end up just wishing away your days.
 Yeah.
 And losing sight of what you do have because you focus on what you don't have.
 That's a big one.
 Yeah.
 Or you end up grumbling about the journey because we only want the destination.
 Yeah, like if you think about it today, if you think about, let's just say, living in Nashville is, is, is, well, it's just, let's use today, living in Nashville.
 When we got the word years ago, almost 10 and a half, 11 years ago that we're going to live in Nashville, the time between when we got the word and when we'd be living there would have been fraught with frustration if we didn't enjoy it.
 Yeah, I think, yeah, I mean, I think we just, what did we do?
 We stayed busy and focused on what we had to do in front of us and just know that God's
 going to work out the getting you their part as well as, you know, he doesn't just announce
 something and then not get you there.
 As long as you say, yes, you're fine.
 It's one of things Graham Cook shared, which I really loved at first, I didn't understand,
 but he says, God loves to speak in vagueness.
 And it's for our benefit because we get to explore the territory.
 And I think most of my life, I've always wanted more precision with what God's saying.
 But think back to the time when we started our journey to discovering here, it was
 replete with joy and adventures. Remember when we went to Florida because we thought that God
 might be saying, "Do something in Florida." Yeah, we knew the Lord was saying in the U.S.
 we just didn't know where. And so, yeah, we went to Florida first. Staying in the billionaire's
 beach house. Yeah, and prayed and got nothing. We're like, "This isn't it." I didn't
 Then discovered Florida wasn't it, but I heard Nashville.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Anyway, here's the thing, wherever you are right now,
 you've got a prophetic word or you have a passion
 for a job or a vocation or a dream, whatever.
 How do you manage life now
 while feeling called to something else?
  </li><li>Yeah, I think there's more defined seasons of that too, babe,
 where if you're in your final year of university
 or ministry school or you're finishing a project at home
 or work, you know, something that your project based,
 or-- - Or you feel stuck in it,
 but you can see the end coming.
  </li><li>Yeah, for sure.
 Or you know, you're engaged or you're pregnant.
 Like if you think about, I mean,
 you wouldn't be familiar with this,
 but the last trimester, you just,
 you know it's coming, you know, everything's about to shift,
 but those weeks they can feel like forever
 as you're growing and waddling along
 and just feeling like, you know, I don't know.
  </li><li>I don't remember that.
  </li><li>A beeping sound when you back up.
 me, me, you know, so I do remember engagement. I do remember you and I on different sides of the
 world. Yes, constantly. Or I remember us dating and thinking it would be nice and I have to go home
 to our separate houses. Yeah. And there's that tension of oh, I wish you were already married,
 but you then wish away the precious time that you have been engaged. So whatever it is, we've got
 four things to keep in mind while you're managing this time gap.
 Number one is to blossom where you're planted.
 Oh, yeah.
 So we meet so many people that don't put down roots.
 They don't connect.
 They don't build relationships because they know they're eventually moving on.
 Right.
 But typically we are terrible at timing.
 So terrible.
 Right.
 So typically we really tend to overestimate the timing of things we want to have.
 like, "Oh, you know, my house will totally sell. It'll sell this week." Or, "Oh, yeah,
 I'm totally going to get that job. I interviewed for it. It's totally going to happen." And so we
 shortchange what we really want to happen, or we overestimate, "Oh, this is going to take forever
 on the things that we don't want to happen as if we were in charge of our destinies,
 if we're in charge of the timing of things." All that to say, don't squander today. Squeeze the
 most out of it. And our encouragement is flourish, blossom, do well. For example, I remember being
 a school teacher babe. Like a school teacher in Scotland. First of all, it wasn't what
 I wanted to be doing at all, but it was what I was doing. So I had a choice. I can either
 wish I was doing something else and resent what I'm doing, or actually accept this is
 what I'm doing. I get paid to do this and I can work really, really well. My parents
 brought me up with that verse like, "What have you do? Do unto the Lord?" And so I did
 that. And so when I, when I blossomed where I was planted, like I really wanted to be doing
 something other than teaching. All my dreams and prophecies spoke about something else. But what I
 had before me was no indication from the Lord has going to do anything else. And so you're going to
 be miserable if you resent what you're doing. So I just dug down and thought, I'm going to try and
 be the best teacher I can. I'm going to try and give everything to something that isn't my passion.
 That's like an important lesson to learn.
 But the heat got turned up when I ultimately knew I was going to be leaving.
 I felt like the Lord had invited me to Toronto, had been accepted into school, and I was counting
 down the months till I was leaving and I was going to be done.
 In those moments, oh, it is so easy to just think, "Oh, I'll just, you know, I'll coast."
 Yeah, the challenge is to finish well, isn't it?
 Totally.
 Yeah.
 Because who you are when no one's looking is who you are.
 Yeah.
 speaking to Chris McLaurney, who's brilliant, Chris is like a genius. He was finishing up his
 time at Grey Centre and was moving into something else. He said, "How you finish one season
 determines how you enter the next." He did such a great job in navigating those seasons.
 I think, babe, as you're saying that, I got all those prophetic words about traveling the world
 and stuff and it was eight years before it even started.
 Right. How many years was it before you wanted it to start?
 Well, I actually had the dream the next year. It was about a year in that I had a dream
 that I was doing it and I started saying yes.
 It took seven years.
 Seven years.
 From the time you said yes to ever happening.
 Yes. I just was like, and I worked at several different restaurants and then I started working
 for national car rental and I just knew, okay, Lord, the timing of everything belongs to
 you. So for right now, I get to be where I am and give it my best. And I mean, that's
 that's even when I said to the people at national when I started the job, you know, I was like,
 I really believe in five years, I'll be gone, you know, that I'll be full time in ministry.
 But while I'm here, I'll give you 150%. And they said, that's great for us.
 think about the thing, you know, we're from, I met you in Toronto,
 yeah, where they have a school of ministry. It's a five month school.
 Yeah. You would watch students come in for five months and some students would
 think, well, there's no point really making friendships or connections. I'm
 only here for five months. Right. But those that did have lifelong friends all
 over the world. Yes. The same thing with here. We've watched people, students from
 different states or even from different countries come to our school. Yeah.
 Again, when we watch them plug in, they could easily just take the attitude of,
 "Well, I'm only here for eight months." There's no real point making friendships.
 But the people that we've watched who just dug down made great friendships are the richer for it.
 Yeah, for sure.
 And we've got friends all over the world because I don't think you ever waste resources by building
 relationships.
 No way.
 Yeah.
 That's number one. Number two is interesting because you just said something I want to ask you about.
 But number two is don't subscribe to FOMO, the fear of missing out fear should never be our primary
 motivator. Yeah, it's not a good motivator. It really isn't. But so here's the thing you get all
 these prophetic words. A year into you getting these prophetic words you have a dream from the
 Lord and your heart begins to say yes. Yes. Then from the outside that looks like you take a hard
 left and you start taking jobs. I've got nothing to do with your prophetic words. Why were you not
 scared by doing that, you would be missing out on your prophetic words.
 The reason I ask that is, especially living in Nashville, I watch so many people who come
 with a dream refuse to do something else because it feels like in doing something else, they're
 saying no to their dream.
 Talk to me about how did you navigate that?
 I think, well, I know the big part for me was trusting the Lord.
 "Okay God, actually I can't make anything that you have for me happen anyway."
 Right.
 Like, I've watched people try and crowbar their way into their dreams and, you know, sometimes
 it looks even like it's worked but there's no longevity to it.
 Right.
 So you, I did know, I want God's timing on this too.
 It did feel like forever.
 I'm not going to lie.
 Like, in certain seasons I was like, "Okay God, have you forgotten?"
 You know?
 I do remember just thinking I'm just gonna give my best where I am and it's funny now
 I look back and I think in all of those different seasons in all of those different situations
 I've used all that and where he has me now
 You know all the things that I learned and you never know that when you're going through it right nothing is wasted in God's economy now
 You usually find it what you've gone through his preparation for where you're going you just don't know it at the time right
 One of the things that's funny about walking with a lord is his plans are rarely in a straight line.
 Yeah, right yeah i would say that's for sure so we have to purpose in our heart that we're going to enjoy the journey yeah so if we currently live here in Nashville well in franklin.
 So we live here i believe we were destined to be here but if we were destined to be here.
 God can have messed up because we're both born in the wrong country for that to happen.
 I mean I was born in Scotland you were born in Canada and yet shockingly enough it still
 worked itself out.
 Yeah.
 I think the most important thing is your yes.
 Right.
 You know as long as you keep a heart posture of yes you'll see the door when it opens you
 won't miss it.
 He won't let you miss it.
 Right.
 You know and for the rest of it you don't have to have a fear of missing out just do
 your best where you are and look for the little everyday opportunities that he brings that
 that are going to bring you life and refine your character and all that kind of stuff so
 that when the door does open you are ready.
 Perfect.
 Number three, keep vision before you.
 So vision gives pain a purpose.
 If you can keep ahead of you or keep in your mind's eye, that thing that God is calling
 you to, it helps you stay on course.
 It's what we're talking about a little bit before where everything we're doing right
 now is actually reusable in the future.
 I'm really enjoying, this is a bit obscure, but stay with me.
 I'm really enjoying watching something called "Epically Laidered".
 It started out as a...
 Well, I started watching one YouTube.
 It started out as a YouTube show.
 This guy, a filmmaker called Patrick Odell,
 would catch up with pro skaters now that they're later in their life
 and find out, you know, what are you doing?
 What was your story?
 And for me, as somebody who is hugely in the skateboarding,
 it's been fascinating watching just recently.
 I think it's on HBO now.
 I've been watching interviews with...
 These are really my heroes when I was 14, 15.
 I've kept in touch with the skateboarding community and culture this whole time.
 But watching all these people I grew up idolizing and really being influenced by now in their 40s,
 just listening to them in retrospect, tell the story of their adventure in skateboarding.
 These athletes, these top of the game, top of their industry,
 The one thing they all have in common is that your life makes more sense
 looking back than it does looking forward.
 Sure.
 Like they're telling all these stories of happenstance and, you know,
 relationships and these coincidences.
 And I'm watching it going, I can see the hand of the Lord in all of that.
 You know, they're for the most part, these people aren't believers, but it's
 been fascinating for me to go back and watch them as I watch their lives move
 forward listening to them chronicle their lives looking backwards. I've really, really loved it.
 So it's easy. I say all that to say, it's easy to know where you're going. It's harder to know
 the right. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. But keeping vision helps you in the ups and downs. So for me,
 my vision has always been to honor the Lord. It always has. I know that truly, really broad.
 I remember somebody once asked me, so what's your five-year plan?
 And I'm like, listen, I'm not against people having five-year plans, but five years ago. I didn't know I was gonna be doing this
 Yeah, that's for sure. Literally my five-year plan my 10-year plan the vision for my life is I want obedience to God to define everything
 Yeah
 I just want to obey the Lord and let him lead and I trust it my trust him with my passions
 I trust him with my desires, but you know, just letting God lead is taking me to places
 I'd never go and do things I'd never choose, but I've ended up saturated with satisfaction.
 So good.
 All right, number four.
 This is super simple, but it's a worthy reminder.
 Don't opt out.
 Yeah.
 I remember one time Chris Valtin was at our church.
 He was doing a private session for the staff and I asked him, I said, "Chris, how did
 you end up where you are?"
 Right?
 Because I know a little bit of his story.
 Yeah.
 they were just in a tiny little church in Weaverville, which makes writing look like
 a metropolis.
 And I was like, how did you end up where you are like with this global influence?
 And he said, I just outlasted everyone else.
 I just didn't know how to quit.
 And I just kept going.
 And it's so, so important again, watching epically later, watching these people, they're
 They're interviewing people who have stayed.
 They're down their forties, who've stayed.
 There's plenty of people who didn't, who just dropped out, who just quit.
 They had the same potential, the same talent, the same skill, but they never made where
 they're going.
 My encouragement is done opt out.
 One of the...
 I haven't preached on this in forever.
 I don't think I've preached on it.
 Maybe I've preached on it once or twice.
 I don't think I've preached on it in ever.
 But is watching the 12 tribes of Israel go from captivity to the promised land, two
 two of the tribes camp on the wrong side of the Jordan. They say, "I don't know, we're
 good." Now, this is great. This is great. They literally couldn't believe that God was
 promising them something better than what they had right now. So they opted out.
 Yeah. And they're like, "No, no, no. We'll still
 believe for your destiny. We'll come fight for you, but let us just have this share of
 the magic." And then that becomes their inheritance.
 Right. And I'm like, "Lord, no matter how good my life is, I don't want it to be the
 worst enemy of best. I want to constantly keep moving forward and not opt out and not settle.
 Yeah, just keep moving forward and keep hanging on to God and stay in hope.
 And if you have quit, get back in the race. Yeah, unquit today.
 Yeah, he's to go to 2nd, 3rd, 4th chances. I love saying yes to God. It's the most amazing way
 to slipstream in in the things of the spirit as you yes agreed i got to listen questions okay the first one ask you this is from nikla she said i've been catching up on the podcast on fasting lots of great and challenging areas to mull over.
 The discussion on hunger strike in particular caught my attention this is where you were talking about you want to share if you're actually fasting or.
 in retrospect just doing a hunger strike for revelation.
 Yeah.
 Nicholas continues. She says, "I'm curious around that and how it perhaps differs from wrestling with God where Jacob would not let go until God blesses him."
 Thoughts?
 Well, I don't suppose we really know what it looked like for Jacob to wrestle with God, but I doubt he was starving himself to do it.
 I think the problem with hunger striking is there's a certain amount of control at play there on our part.
 And so what I'm actually doing is kind of throwing a little fit, but it looks spiritual and saying,
 "Hey, I'm not moving from this place and I'm not going to eat.
 You're going to watch me starve until you tell me stuff."
 Right. And you know, of course, God's lovely and he tells you stuff, but that's not actually
 the heart motivation of fasting. It's not to manipulate God.
 I think the other big difference is with you, hunger striking and with Jacob wrestling with God,
 one was self-initiated, the other was God-initiated. Yeah. Like God came to Jacob and he wrestled with
 him. Right. You went to God and were like, see, watch me. See? Not going to eat. Can he get skinny?
 Watch this. Yeah. Hopefully that helps. Second question. This is from Aaron and she asks,
 "I've noticed more and more hostility towards Christians, the church and any language related
 to God, increasing more in both my Christian friends and also non-Christian friends I've had
 for 10 plus years, both who know my faith and character openly. My question is, how would you
 advise someone to approach or handle such hostile conflict to Christianity in their day-to-day
 relationships will still try to be kind and gentle if that's even possible. Well, kindness and
 gentleness is always possible. It's always an option. I think the reason there's been increased
 hostility is we've been representing Jesus and his kingdom really, really poorly.
 I'm sometimes embarrassed to be called a Christian when I watch Christians
 or people taking the name of christians representing me in media.
 I think there's a handful of people who do it brilliantly.
 I think Joel Osteen does a brilliant job at it.
 I think Rick Warren does a brilliant job at it.
 I've seen some other leaders, you know, I'm not exclusively leaving it to them.
 But when I see Christians being interviewed, especially around the time of the election,
 especially over controversial topics, I kind of want to scream like, they're not representing me.
 Yeah, I don't hold with what they're saying.
 I don't agree with what they're saying.
 And so I think part of it is we haven't done a great job.
 A, we being the Christian evangelical community at large,
 done a great job at representing Jesus well.
 Yeah.
 And then I think that the best way to do it, Aaron, is to actually offer a different
 voice to the narrative.
 Yeah.
 I think if you can stay calm and keep your love on and not be shaken by
 information that's delivered, I think that that actually
 speaks a lot louder than even being able to reasonably argue something, if that makes
 sense.
 I know I should know this, but hopefully everyone else does.
 Who was the person that said, "Preach the gospel, use words if necessary."
 Probably butcher the quote terribly.
 No, that's right.
 That's the right quote.
 Somebody very famous.
 Yeah.
 But also, you can represent your Christian faith and use words as an option.
 Yeah.
 your character, your nature, your kindness, your unflappability, your the trouble is so that's one side of it. The other side of it is.
 I don't I don't want to get into culture war. That's just not my area of expertise. B is not something I care to comment on a huge lot.
 But I have noticed that Christians are called intolerant by people who won't tolerate us.
 So there has become like this, this, this swell in if you don't think like us then your, your opinion isn't valid.
 And, but you know that, I, that we're even seeing inside, you know, people that say that they are Christians, you know, they're just, hey, we're cutting edge and you're, you're being left behind and they're intolerant of those people that are maybe more mainstream or you know, whatever.
 So I think it's always a challenge to just keep your love on whether you agree or not
 With what's being said and and just trust that the Lord's gonna help, you know, wash it all out kind of thing
 Yeah, that's that's really true. I think if we can exercise self-control, which is just manage ourselves in the midst of oh
 It's you know Facebook or Twitter or just even real-life conversation and try and move in the opposite spirits
 I mean, I'm not sure I'm an expert at it, but that would probably be my best guess, Aaron.
 I'm sorry that's increased in your life.
 I don't think you're alone in that, but it's a great opportunity to practice the fruit
 of the spirit, isn't it?
 I just saw a large bag, empty bag of marshmallows.
 I've been looking at it all night and asking the Lord to find your eyes to Alan Jones.
 That was from last week.
 Oh, oh, great.
 Well, here's the thing, I'll help your complete or finish your by not buying you any more marshmallows.
 Oh, the kids will be very sad.
 Yeah, well, you know what?
 They'll get over it.
 No, they won't.
 They'll be in their healing.
 Paleo marshmallows.
 Oh, my gosh, please.
 Yeah.
 I love coconut husks.
 Why my marshmallows?
 Harry shut up and eat it, kid.
 Well, that's the podcast for this week.
 We have a killer conference coming up.
 not this weekend, but next we have Gary Morgan and David Campbell coming in for the conference
 and it is going to be stellar.
 I think we still have seats left in the main sanctuary.
 We do.
 We're fast approaching capacity.
 I would love you to come join us.
 I honestly think it's going to be a really significant time.
 I'm super looking forward to I'm praying into just for me personally, like Lord, I would
 love both corporate and personal revelation at this conference.
 And I know the Lord loves to answer prayers like that.
 So go to grace center dot us slash heaven declares for more information and to get
 tickets. We will probably be selling live streaming.
 I don't know that for sure, but we have in the past conferences.
 So I'm sure that's going to be the case that we'll probably announce that next week.
 Um, if you're, if you're listening to this and thinking, I have a friend just
 at a conversation with them about time gap management, or you can think of somebody
 friend or family that would be encouraged by this episode. Do them a favor for them a link
 to this so they can listen to themselves. And if you're listening, maybe it's the first
 time we release these podcasts every Monday, if you subscribe in your podcast client choice,
 you'll get free episodes every single Monday to encourage you on your commute.
 Until next week, we are praying for you and we hope you have a wonderful week.
