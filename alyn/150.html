<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mrs. AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes sir.<br/>
 How the heck are you?<br/>
 I'm very good.<br/>
 You look very good.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 You're bright eyed and bushy tailed.<br/>
 I have eyes but no tail.<br/>
 Then what the heck is that?<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHING]</strong><br/>
 It's my paintbrush.<br/>
 How's painting going?<br/>
 It's going good.<br/>
 I love that you put it on Instagram stories.
 Yes.<br/>
 Because it vanishes after 24 hours.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 It's quite a good way of doing it because it's true.
 If you haven't followed, if you haven't been faithful, you just don't know what's going on.
 That's not what I was thinking.<br/>
 I was thinking from a boredom point of view,
 yeah, I give vanishes within 24 hours.
 I quite like that.<br/>
 Yes, so do I.<br/>
 I posted like a teaser this evening that just said it's finished, but I'm not showing it to you until we put the room back together.
 That's horrible.<br/>
 Well, because a bunch of people ask me about it today,
 and but I don't want to post a picture until like it's done done at this point.
 For those of you who have no clue what we're talking about,
 AJ took it upon herself to do up our guest bedroom.
 Yes.<br/>
 And one of the walls is 17 feet long, 17 feet and three inches.
 OK.<br/>
 And she decided to do some sort of craftsman style woodwork across that back wall.
 It's called a Bordenman, which I'd never heard of.
 So you saying that is only going to educate people.
 the crown molding ledge.<br/>
 That's the only thing I feel to the people who look at Pinterest and know what you're talking about.
 There's got to be people that listen to our podcast and look at Pinterest.
 Oh, undoubtedly, but I'm saying I'm not one of them.
 So when you were like, babe, I want to do board and bat.
 And I was like, you want to do what?<br/>
 Now I know I had to show you a picture and then I had to show it to you again, like the next day,
 because you can remember what it looks like.
 My mind palace is full.<br/>
 Yeah, it definitely is.<br/>
 To put something in.<br/>
 You have to take some time.<br/>
 I know and I don't want to lose any of those mario stats.
 We'll be talking about that later on this podcast.
 So you've been up to your eyeballs in DIY world.
 I have.<br/>
 I think somewhere along the line, people think, well, people that know us
 won't think this, but I think somewhere along the line, people are thinking, oh,
 you know, you've done a great job.<br/>
 And I'm like, no, no, literally I have done nothing.
 Save for Godaloes to pick up something.
 I'm your errand boy.<br/>
 It's all you.<br/>
 It's me.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And actually, I don't know what I'm doing.
 It's pretty much all I see something.<br/>
 And then if I run into a problem, I have to ask the Holy Spirit.
 And if I can't figure it out that way, then I YouTube it.
 Who knew YouTube the fourth person of the friend?
 It's true.<br/>
 It's true.<br/>
 So this week was our first week without the students?
 Was it our first week?<br/>
 I think it was.<br/>
 I think it was.<br/>
 Gosh, this week's gone by slow, but fast.
 It's exactly that slow, but fast.<br/>
 Yeah, it feels like almost the opposite of when the school is in.
 Yeah, for sure.<br/>
 But you still got this horrible sound.
 I thought it was a banshee it sounds like somebody is vacuuming the main road or something i don't know if you can hear this on the podcast i'm doing my best to.
 Isla it but i don't know if you can hear this on the podcast i'm doing my best to isolate it.
 But either neighbors are we eating or mowing or vacuuming their car right something's going on out there does sound like a houling banshee yeah so if you hear howling we're all okay here it says in the notes that a j spoke to high school football team.
 Have you been moonlighting as a football coach?
 I am.<br/>
 I mean, I know so much about football that it's time I started coaching.
 24 or 68.<br/>
 How?<br/>
 How?<br/>
 Is that what they say?<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Okay, we'll check with Brian.<br/>
 I'm pretty sure the numbers change all the time, maybe.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I got an invitation to go and speak to a local high school's football team.
 There's a coach at one of our local public high schools who has read my book, has read
 finding father. And he said for him, when he read it, he was in his 40s and he didn't
 know that he could hear the voice of God until then, but he'd been saved his whole life.
 And so, I know. So he said it was like transformational for him. And so he's, he's a coach at this
 local high school and they're letting him take a group of people through it. But it's
 not just football players. There's, there was a bunch of girls there too, which I think
 where perhaps cheerleaders or, you know, and then there was a couple of teachers that came.
 So it was, it was really fun.<br/>
 There was one heck of a football team.
 Right.<br/>
 Teachers, boys, girls.<br/>
 Well, I was told it was going to be football players and there was definitely football players,
 but there was a bunch of other people too.
 So it was fun.<br/>
 It was really fun and it made me think, oh, I love this.
 I love going into a place that doesn't normally have open doors for listening to the gospel
 and just being able to go in and chat with them about how loved they are.
 Have we ever told a story about when we went to a correctional facility in Alabama?
 I don't know.<br/>
 And we got to speak to 100?<br/>
 125.<br/>
 Was it 100? How do you remember stuff like this?
 Because I actually use my mind palace for things other than mario stats.
 You need to back off the mario stats.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 but that was fun we got invited to speak at a youth correctional facility and it was also awkward for a variety of reasons not least of the fact that we were late and they were kept waiting in a non air conditioned.
 Sports hall it was a 10 gym in Alabama in the summer it was horrible it was like a hundred fifteen degrees in there and then you spoke.
 and i was wearing a leather coat but i didn't want to take it off because the sweat stains would have been too bad so i kept it on.
 It was awesome real life people yeah yeah and so we spoke to these kids in what easily was one of the most awkward environments and i think any of them are going to respond i didn't hear a bunch of them responded to get saved yeah and then.
 I'm going to get some responded to get saved like sixty or something oh yeah i don't remember stuff from the past.
 And then we did healing and a bunch of a bunch of them got healed.
 Every single one of them who stayed for prayer for healing got healed.
 Oh, it was so much fun. So yes, I love the gospel in places we don't normally get to speak.
 Yeah, super fun. And then you started a six week theology class this week.
 Yeah, things I thought I'd never do.<br/>
 Why?<br/>
 Well, for me growing up theology, well, first of all, let's face facts. Theology is not
 the sexiest subject. I mean, it absolutely is, but it doesn't sound it.
 I think it's sexy.<br/>
 Yeah. Hey, baby, we'll do some theology tonight.
 We're gonna talk theology.<br/>
 It doesn't work. And again, the culture I grew up in, whether this is true or not,
 my impression of it was, that people used their theology...
 To trap people.<br/>
 To, well, to prove they were right, which is a gross misuse of theology.
 Theology that doesn't lead you closer to God is wasted effort.
 So it really put me off. The whole intellectual pursuit of Bible facts to grow closer to God
 just did not work for me at all. Paul says knowledge puffs up and that's all it did for me.
 I realized half the stuff I argued against. I later found out it was wrong about it.
 Anyway, I say all that to say, I grew up in a really evangelical church, then moved to the
 charismatic church and just thought this was everything I was missing, only to find it
 for a lot of people in charismatic church. They're experts in the Holy Spirit but know very little
 about the word. That's a gross generalization. I absolutely appreciate. So I just realized how
 blessed I was with my upbringing on conservative Protestant evangelism. There's a lot of stuff
 that I just took for granted that other people didn't know.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And more recently, I've just been appalled at the theology that people are believing
 and just thinking, how the heck do you believe that?
 And I realized, oh, you never knew the truth.
 So you didn't recognize the counterfeit.
 Right.<br/>
 So we thought we'd do a beginner's guide to theology.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I had a lot of fun teaching the first session.
 Babe, it was so good.<br/>
 Well, you kind of have to say that because I don't though.
 You don't.<br/>
 Well, I on a regular basis, well, not that regular because you're usually really good.
 but if there is feedback to give you, I do give you real feedback.
 Yeah, you do. That's right.<br/>
 It was really good.<br/>
 You usually write it on my chest while I'm asleep,
 and then when I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror,
 then I get my feedback.<br/>
 I mean, how you can write backwards so I can read in the mirror is a gift.
 Well, I'm so gifted.<br/>
 I just wish you would just confront me face to face.
 So you know how early are you like,<br/>
 there's two things I need to get you back for?
 Yeah.<br/>
 And you can't remember what the second one is.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Do you want me to remind you what the second one is?
 Sure.<br/>
 Okay, so last night, I was watching a comedian.
 now i was laughing and you laughed and so i thought you're still awake and so at the end i was like gosh that guy was really funny and i shined my life in your face which woke you up.
 And then you're like oh this too and but i had thought you already wait so i told everyone the first thing was that you did like a path.
 No, there's a horrible video which I'll link to you take a video that we use in teaching about a father who don's a gas mask.
 Oh, it's not like that.<br/>
 Ice cold cup of water.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And while his teenage son is having a roasting hot shower, the dad throws the ice cold water over the top and the sun is understandably upset.
 Right.<br/>
 That would be traumatic enough.<br/>
 But then the father slides open the shower door to reveal him in a gas mask and this poor son freaks out.
 i'm absolutely shocked will he did much the same i did not minus the gas mask and the ice cold water i'm happy i'm basically stood in front of the shower door that's not the same thing at all you turn around silently when i turn around i got the fright of my life first of all i'm always silent but second of all.
 I didn't realize you can see me.<br/>
 I don't I wear glasses but not in the shower and practically blind.
 So I kind of just stood with my nose up against the glass and then when you opened your eyes after rinsing out your hair I was right there.
 Yeah, I was horrible.<br/>
 So I've not got two things to get you back or yeah, you're not going to remember them though with your mind palace will be gone by tomorrow.
 I'm quite safe people.<br/>
 I'm quite safe.<br/>
 This is a foundation of healthy marriage.
 On the topic of healthy marriage, just follow up from last week's podcast. Last week, we had
 our dear friends, Mike and Phyllis Best, who are marriage experts, and I loot our stats for
 our downloads. And their episode, last week, All About Marriage, is the most downloaded episode
 in its first week in our three-year history of podcasting. Wow! Within six days, it's already
 the fourth most listened to episode of all time. Well, we want to have healthy marriages, don't we?
 Well, apparently everybody does.<br/>
 So it's unlikely if you're listening to this regularly that you haven't listened to that one,
 but if you missed it, it's a really, really good one.
 I highly recommend it.<br/>
 Yeah, it's great.<br/>
 What else happened?<br/>
 You went to movies.<br/>
 I went to a good movie.<br/>
 You said home and watch a terribly old movie.
 It wasn't a tick.<br/>
 Well, it's old.<br/>
 It wasn't terrible.<br/>
 Well, it is both.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Well, the movie going.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So I watched West Side Story.<br/>
 I have a couple girls that I've invited to come over and watch musicals with me.
 They're quality films. I'm just saying. Don't look at me like that.
 Stop. I can't even muster any other facial expressions.
 This is my default facial expression when you talk about old musicals.
 I know. Well, that's just because you don't have any taste. That's all.
 I'm just kidding, darling. You have lots of taste. You just don't realize that musicals are where it's
 at. Yes, yeah, quite true. Yeah. Well, while you did that, when I watched the "Garden of the Galaxy"
 movie and I'm x3d and I heard is great. Yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good. So we need
 to go see it. But you need to. I need to catch up on my old musicals. Yeah, you probably
 do. Gosh, I love them. Can you like learn the dancing and stuff and then we could dance
 together in the front hall? Your weirdness is reaching the limits, darling. And I love
 it. We could train the children. We could reenact things. It'll be great. All right.
 This week, we're catching up on our listeners questions and they're all for you to answer.
 Are you ready? Wait, they're all for me to answer. Well, I'm going to read them out and
 you can answer them. This is Katie and she asks, "I've been thinking about the subject
 of weakness in the last few months, maybe because I now have two kids under two. I would
 do it. I'm frequently reminding myself that his power is made perfect in weakness and
 when I am weak, I am strong. I'd love to hear your thoughts and experience in this area.
 I've heard you say that you surround yourselves with people who are strong in the areas where
 you are weak." And then she has four questions, way to get four questions for the price of
 one, Katie. Very smart. Okay. First question. She's skilled. How do you identify your own
 weaknesses while still being kind to yourself? What's a great question? I think most of us are
 incredibly aware of our own weaknesses. The challenge is definitely the kindness part of that
 equation. And I'm not sure if I've fully mastered that yet. I mean, even today, I've realized one
 one of my weaknesses is if I'm on task with something,
 I don't actually like to be interrupted,
 which doesn't work very well as a mom.
 Or a wife.<br/>
 (laughs)<br/>
 So, you know, I realized today I was like,
 oh, I'm being short with my kids.<br/>
 I don't wanna be short with my kids.<br/>
 I want to, you know, be able to stop<br/>
 and have a conversation 'cause I need to have a conversation,
 but I'm aware that this paint dries fast.
 You know, like that kind of stuff.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And afterwards, I then feel horrible<br/>
 about myself.<br/>
 And so I don't know if I know the answer to that babe.
 Like I think that you have to let the Holy Spirit lead you in being kind to yourself and
 remind you because he reminds me to be kind.
 He reminds me he's not expecting perfection.
 Yeah, that's the thing.<br/>
 You don't have to be perfect to be wonderful.
 That's a great revelation to learn.<br/>
 I think it also helps being in an environment like we have, the culture that we have where
 in terms of identifying your own weaknesses, your community around you will tell you and
 hopefully they're a kind community.<br/>
 So when people are telling you your strengths and your weaknesses, it's because they love
 you and your weaknesses aren't a deficit.
 They're just either areas and opportunities to grow in or areas that I don't think, I
 don't know if you agree with this thing, I don't think we have to be strong in everything.
 I think that's why we have a body of believers.
 We can't all be eyes.<br/>
 We can't all be hands.<br/>
 We can't all be feet.<br/>
 We have to recognize that that's why we need one another right i totally agree i don't think you can be strong in everything i think that's how people go a little bit crazy or they're really pretending right i love being in the community where people love me.
 In spite my weaknesses.<br/>
 I'm just thinking because you mentioned that your mom that probably some of what you're talking about our times when you're just by yourself with your kids and it's not really a time when you can go well this is just one of my week.
 I'm going to have to outsource parenting.
 And in those kind of situations, I think it's great to identify a weakness.
 And then you're literally just saying, Holy Spirit, would you help me?
 Would you show me any root here that's robbing life for me as if there's specific reactions?
 God would you talk to me about that because I want to be a source of nourishment to my
 children?<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And he helps with that.<br/>
 I think I'm a much better mom now than I was, you know, when I first started having kids.
 Yeah, absolutely.<br/>
 One would hope that we're always getting better at the things we keep doing.
 Right.<br/>
 And experiences an amazing teacher.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Um, Katie, you then ask, what is it that like to receive God's love and acceptance while
 still asking him to help you grow?<br/>
 I think we have to separate God's love and acceptance from our performance.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And understand, you know, it's the thing that John used to say to us all the time, God loves
 He just loves you too much to leave you the way you are.
 So there's a delight in where you are.
 He loves progress.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I love MJ for the stage that he's at.<br/>
 And I'm not expecting him to be T or Abby.
 Right.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And God feels about us in that way too.
 And God never reveals anything to make us feel bad.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Or to look bad.<br/>
 He just, he's got exceptional grace and he's constantly leading us in in health and vitality.
 any tips on growing in areas of weakness.
 I think probably just surrendering your areas of weakness as you see them to the
 Lord and just ask him to help you grow.
 You know, yeah.<br/>
 And I think God brings situations around us to draw strength out of those weak
 places.<br/>
 So he's great at orchestrating life where you have plenty of opportunities to grow,
 be that in patients or planning or endurance or what I mean.
 He's just so masterful at that.<br/>
 And so trying to face every season with grace
 and asking for help is key to those things, I think.
</p><ul>
  <li>And then lastly, it says,
 "What is a healthy response
 "when we encounter other people's weakness or failures?"
 Grace, I mean, I don't know that we can say we 100%
 always responded the level that we'd like to
 in terms of grace for other people
 when they're in their low moments or weaknesses,
 but hopefully we're getting there, you know?
 But we need to be able to,
 as much as we require grace for our weaknesses,
 we need to be able to extend grace to others
 in their weakness as well.
  </li><li>I think that whole thing of never a tribute to malice,
 what could easily be explained away as ignorance
 is a really important thing.
 I think we're often always receiving quote unquote motive
 other people's weaknesses. And usually there isn't any, it's just them being weak and not realizing it.
 Like I think about a lot of the complaints I've received over the years is that, for example,
 I might not be perceived as caring. Whereas anybody who knows me would say that's absolutely
 not true of my nature. But because some of my actions are the speed with which I make decisions
 or etc, etc, etc, people would attribute the motive, because they're basically like,
 for me to behave in the way that Alan just behaved would mean I don't care about them,
 where I'm like, I don't even know what you're talking about. Like, oh, oh, oh, yeah, I could
 totally see how you would get that. But no, no, that was never in my heart. So that whole thing
 of giving grace. And then the second thing is, I remember John Paul Jackson used to say,
 God will use the weaknesses of others to refine the weaknesses in us.
 Boy, does he? And it's true. Yeah.
 Just recently, you were having to say, hey, Alan, because I had a situation where I was really,
 really frustrated with somebody else's weakness. And as you're just like, babe, are you realizing
 this is an opportunity for you to grow in this area? And I'm like, yes. Like now that you mentioned
 it. Yes. So Katie, that's great questions. I hope that was helpful.
 All right. The next question is by somebody named JS. And the question is, I have been listening
 to your podcast on the subject of blessing. You speak often about trusting God with things and
 situations and by doing so, receiving blessing in those areas, my question is this, how does
 one trust God with a specific situation be it a dream, plan for the future, relationship,
 or schoolwork? Are there different answers to those situations? Do you simply say, "God,
 I trust you with this situation." Do you wait for his direct guidance before making any move
 or progress. What does trusting God look like in action?
 Great questions.
 Yeah, really good.
 What do you think, baby?
 I think, I think really you've hit it. You've hit the nail on the head. I mean,
 in terms of how do you trust God, I think you just keep your heart in a position to hear from him
 and remain in hope.
 What are our neighbors doing in the dark outside?
 Sounds like they're chopping down trees now.
 Right.
 I honestly think it's like, you know, you said, God, I trust you with this situation.
 That's probably your base level in every situation.
 Like when you say, oh, what about schoolwork or plans for the future or whatever?
 And just being able to press into God and say, Lord, I don't know what's going to happen.
 You know, with this relationship with these friends, with this situation, but I choose
 to trust you. And I think probably staying in replace of trust and thankfulness helps
 you keep your heart open to God moving.
 Right. I think also most of the situations we face in life, there's a lot we can't do
 and our inability to do is by very definition trust in God. Does that make sense? Like,
 when I met you and fell in love with you and really wanted to marry you, there was nothing
 I could do about that. I can't make you fall in love with me. I can't make you do any of those
 things. So in one sense, it really was trusting God, especially when he was like,
 ah, don't do anything with that. I'd like you to actually set that down. You can't date. You're
 in school. You made disagreement. Right. So you're, but God, what if somebody else comes in and
 swoops her off her feet? You know, and you just come up with all these what ifs. Well, the ultimate
 answer to that is, ah, you can't do anything. And so are you going to be anxious while you can't do
 do anything or are you going to just reconcile in your heart? God is God and he's got my
 future.
 Yeah, I think the challenge is always choosing to stay in peace while you're waiting to see
 what God does.
 Brilliant.
 Yeah.
 I love it.
 Sometimes also though, as soon as you come to that peace, God asks you to do specific
 things like for me, for example, the Lord asked me not to put myself in any situations
 where I could flirt with you, which sucks because we went to the same church and you
 We're so cute and so hot and I just wanted to flirt with you because it felt amazing.
 Were, were darling?
 You are so hot and now I can flirt with you all I want.
 Yeah.
 You have your postgraduate flirting degree.
 Well, yes, I do.
 All right.
 This question comes from Megan.
 Yes.
 Two questions.
 Okay.
 You're going to love these.
 Are they for me?
 Well, the second one's for you.
 I think the first one might be for me.
 Do you want me to ask the first one then?
 All right.
 You asked me the first question.
 for your podcast titles.
 For the last year, I've been slowly venturing into blogging,
 and one of the most challenging things I come across
 is not writing the blog,
 but finding a catchy, attractive image that I can use.
 That's of good quality.
  </li><li>Megan, I understand the struggle, it's real.
 So we use Adobe.com.
 If you go to stock.adobe.com,
 they have a huge wealth of image libraries
 that you can pay for.
 So we subscribe to Adobe,
 and that's where we get the vast majority of our images from.
 We also have used images in the past
 and we still have an active subscription
 to a company called Death to the Stock Photo,
 which I absolutely love that title.
  </li><li>That's awesome.
  </li><li>And it's a bunch of creatives
 who produce amazing, amazing creative work.
 And I use it less often simply
 because while the images are absolutely stunning,
 they don't often lend themselves well
 to the topics I'm talking about,
 still I've subscribed to them for maybe two years and I've got a library full of their
 work that they're amazing. And then you also pay for them. And then there's another website
 that's completely free. It's called unsplash.com and it's free. It's user submitted our work
 and it's all royalty free. I'm a firm believer in a worker's worth their wages. And so I'm
 only too happy to pay for the awesome, you know, use so all the software we use we've
 paid for, all the creativity stuff that we use, we pay for, just a firm believer in that.
 And so I'd encourage you to check out those sites, I'll put links in the show notes.
 All right, the second part of our question, baby, see what you think about this.
 Megan writes, "My husband's love language is physical touch and video games."
 I'm sure that's a language.
 "I am primarily quality time and acts of service.
 To my husband, quality time is playing video games with me sitting next to him on the couch,
 so we're touching.
 me that is not quality time because I don't enjoy video games. I hear Alan occasionally
 talk about his love for video games and I'm wondering how you balance hobbies, things
 that fill your love tank, yet still fulfilling your responsibilities around the house or
 with family. Because video games is not a love language to me, I find myself asking
 him regularly to turn his game off to help me with something or hang out with me as "let
 me finish one more mission" or "five more minutes often turns into an hour so I get
 I sometimes feel like I'm turning into a parent by setting boundaries or time limits.
 Maybe this is a question for AJ, but how do you not parent your spouse or do you secretly
 always parent your spouse?
 Right.
 I don't want to not let him do something he really loves or become a nag, but I also
 want there to be a balance.
 Any wisdom in this area would be greatly appreciated.
 I guess I would say maybe have a chat with him and just tell him like, "Hey, babe, I
 know that you think that me sitting next to you, will you play video games as quality
 time?"
 But that's not doing it for me.
 It's not quality time for me.
 I realize video games fills you up.
 It doesn't fill me up at all.
 So can we come up with some kind of a healthy boundary for what this looks like?
 Right.
 I statement, I feel dishonored when you say five minutes more,
 but actually it turns out to be an hour or so.
 So could we and then make a suggestion?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because the truth is your husband's behavior
 is quite dishonoring and he's not hearing your need.
 So either he's not hearing it
 or you're not communicating it well,
 but the two approaches that we're suggesting is good.
  </li><li>Yeah, and none of us do wanna be an egg.
 I think the thing that's worked really well
 with Alan and I is we're both quite high doers. We've talked about life languages and doers
 really like to finish what they've started, but they're also great with boundaries.
 So typically, I know we talk about Mario Kart or whatever, but it's not like Alan's playing it
 all the time. But on his day off, he'll be like, "Hey babe, okay my plan is I'm going to go play
 Marry a cart with Len or I'm going to go do whatever for a bit or play it with the kids.
 And then, but he always does what he says he's going to do.
 He finishes when he says he's going to finish.
 And if I need him, I'll usually just check in and go, Hey babe, when are you going to
 be done?
 Because, you know, I need helps with X, Y, or Z and he'll be like, okay, well, I have
 two games left in this, you know, tournament or whatever.
 And then I'll be done.
 And then he does that.
 So I think if you can have clear communication, then it makes it a lot less frustrating.
 And I think the answer to your question is you never want to parent your spouse.
 No.
 That will not be good for you or for them.
 No.
 Parenting whether in secret or not is control.
 And nobody likes to be controlled and it's not fair to you or to them.
 Yeah.
 So that can't be the option.
 All right.
 Question number four, this is from Eileen.
 Eileen asks, "I just finished the podcast on having kids and loved the insight that
 That's episode 140 for him who's interested.
 Alanaj.com/140.
 I'm wondering, as a woman who got married older
 and also started having kids later in life,
 what are your thoughts on having children later?
 All my friends want to have children before 30,
 and after 35, doctors consider pregnancies high risk.
 I'm about to be 35 this year,
 and would love to have children well into my 40s.
 I feel so behind in life sometimes because of this.
 Also, it's not common to find women
 with my same thoughts.
  </li><li>Well, before I answer this,
 I should probably note that I am not a medical professional.
  </li><li>I like to think I am.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>But I'm not.
  </li><li>You like to think you are.
 But I can't, you know, just speaking from experience,
 the first thing I would say is,
 chat with your doctor about that.
 I remember when Alan and I got married,
 'cause we got married later,
 I got pregnant with Abigail when I was 35.
 And of course, yes, you're considered high risk at 35.
 I didn't consider it high risk, of course, because I just was like, "Well, Lord, I'm
 not worried about this."
 But I did talk to my doctor, and my doctor was like, "You're healthy.
 There's nothing to worry about."
 One of the things that he had mentioned to me was that 20 years ago or 40 years ago,
 life expectancy was a lot shorter.
 And so by the time you're 35, you're not quite middle-aged, but kind of.
 now that's really not so much the case. So talk with your medical professional and just
 you know, have a little chat. I had MJ, which he's our last child when I was 41. And I did
 notice I was more tired with that pregnancy. But again, I don't know if that's because
 I already had two little ones running around that you're chasing, you know. But yeah,
 It did seem to take a toll more physically on you.
 It did, yeah.
 He was also a bigger baby.
 Right.
 And then Eileen, I know nothing about that, so I'll just remain silent.
 But God bless you as you seek wisdom on that.
 All right, number five, this is from Becky.
 This is such a great question.
 How would you explain the difference between hard work and striving?
 I think striving has anxiety attached to it.
 I think we're hard workers.
 We like to work hard.
 we like to get things done and we don't typically sort of sit back.
 We're getting stuff done.
 Um, but I think striving there's like a level of anxiety or anxiousness
 about either what other people think or what you're going to think about yourself
 or like, you know, whatever, the master plan, you know, kind of thing that
 overshadows the work that's being done.
 Right.
 I think it comes down to heart motivation as well.
 Yeah.
 There's a joy on hard work.
 I find the work that we do when it's anointed is marked by an absence of friction.
 It just feels like it's go, it's easy, ideas freely flow, there's a high that comes off
 it, there's just an ease to the productivity.
 I don't mean it's easy, it requires hard work, but there's a joy accompanying it.
 Whereas striving is the opposite.
 Striving just feels like you're pushing water uphill
 with a rake.
  </li><li>Right, and tends to be fraught with tension.
  </li><li>Frought with tension, lots of toil for very little reward.
 And the reward is, are other people noticing me?
 Whereas hard work just seems to be a joy.
 And yeah, that's what I've said, it's a hard motivation.
  </li><li>I don't know if hard work is always a joy.
 You know, sometimes hard work is just hard work,
 But in the end, the result is a joyful result.
  </li><li>I don't know, I've always loved,
 I've always loved working hard.
 I mean, there's times when I'm a huge procrastinator.
 Do you just say yeah, but too quickly there.
 (laughs)
 I mean, I am, there's times when I am procrastinating
 and I think in my head, I justify that,
 well, I'm gonna work hard later.
 But when I'm in the work, I remember my mother saying to me,
 Alan, the thought of hard work is always harder
 than the hard work itself.
 And I found that to be true.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But ever since I was, I don't know,
 my late teens, early twenties,
 I discovered hard work and a joy in it.
 And it's that whole thing of like,
 you know, find a job you love
 and you'll never work a day in your life.
 Well, I get what they're saying.
 Of course, it's not true.
 We work a lot.
 But like I said, there's a joy on it.
 And I think striving is filled with anxiety
 and is anyone noticing it's a horrible way to live.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, last question for the evening.
 Are you ready?
  </li><li>Yes.
 I can't thank you guys enough for your podcast.
 Your insight has impacted me more than you know.
 That's wonderful to hear.
 I have two questions for you.
 The first is, what are your thoughts on generational curses?
 I'm having an extremely hard time finding scripture to back up this concept.
 Is this biblical?
 My second question is, do you guys pray for your listeners?
 So second question first, yes, we pray for our listeners in as much as most times when
 we start our podcast and before we hit record,
 we just ask the Lord for a blessing
 and bless the ears of the people who hear this.
 We don't pray for you individually
 because there are thousands of you
 and we don't know all of your names.
  </li><li>You're right.
  </li><li>And we deliberately say on our website,
 hey, we can't respond to personal prayers
 or requests for prophetic words
 because we have our own community, we're pastoring
 and we would love you to find your own communities
 to be pastored by.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So we don't encourage you to write in
 and share what's going on and ask for personal prayer
 or personal prophetic ministry
 because that's just not something we're going to do.
 It's not within our resources and not within our mandate.
 So hopefully that makes sense.
 Your first question then about generational curses.
 Yes, we do a whole load of teaching on generational curses
 and the effects of sin that it causes.
 As for biblical concept, you only have to look
 as far as Genesis and realize Adam and Eve sinned
 and the rest of the generations after them were cursed
 with the effects of sin.
 So there's a foundation.
 There's a lot of bad teaching and confusion on that out there.
 Basically, here is in a nutshell,
 yes, you see people living with the effects
 of the sins of forefathers.
 Simple example, if I was an alcoholic
 and drank all the money that we earned,
 my children would reap the effects of my sinful choice.
 Also, just statistically,
 most people who are abusers were themselves abused.
 Right.
 And so, you know, that's an example of sin being passed down.
 We even think there's passages in the New Testament where they say, "Is this person sick
 because of their own sin or from their father's sin or generational sin?"
 So it was an understood thing.
 Right.
 And also, even today when you go to a doctor, the first thing to do is take a family history
 because from a medical perspective, they see hereditary illnesses.
 Now they wouldn't call that generational curses, but clearly it's apparent of sickness being
 passed from one generation to another.
 And being somebody who's been delivered from a number of generational curses, I'd like
 to say yes, they're real because being free of them feels much different.
 Yeah.
 Two excellent books on the topic.
 First one is by Derek Prince called "Blacksings and Curves You Choose" &acirc;€“ I'll put link
 in the show notes &acirc;€“ a second one that deals with the whole topic of generational sins
 of the fathers and the resulting curses is by our friends Chester and Betsy Kildstra.
 Their book, Biblical Healing and Deliverance is an absolutely astounding book at clearly
 explaining how they work, how they get their power and more importantly, how they can be
 broken because Jesus Christ broke the curse for us because it says cursed is every man
 who hangs on the tree.
 And of course, Jesus was crucified on a tree and he took the curse for us.
 And so you learn about how to apply what Jesus did to set us free from those curses.
 really, really powerful teaching and has tremendous effects on the lives of people.
 We've got testimonies in our own lives and in the lives of all the people that we've
 ministered about how the difference breaking off generational curses makes in family lives.
 It's amazing. So check out those books. They're tremendous.
