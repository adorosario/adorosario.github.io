<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hello, Mrs Jones. Hello, sir.<br/>
 It sounds like you said hello, sailor.
 OK. Hello, sailor.<br/>
 Is that just you being hopeful?<br/>
 I don't know. Happy Mother's Day.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Yeah, we record this on the day that North America celebrates Mother's Day.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So happy Mother's Day to all moms.<br/>
 Not just American moms.<br/>
 All moms everywhere.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Well, Canadian moms celebrated today too.
 That's why I said North America as in the content.
 But then you said not just American moms.
 I just wanted to clarify.<br/>
 I beg your pardon.<br/>
 Canada is not just America's hat or the 51st state.
 It is its own country.<br/>
 And it seems a little tender.<br/>
 I'm just defending my country.<br/>
 Very good.<br/>
 Talk to me about this week.<br/>
 It was.<br/>
 It was a good week.<br/>
 I think we say that every week.<br/>
 Do we say it?<br/>
 Pretty much every week is a good week.
 You spoke on Monday night.<br/>
 Well, I barely spoke.<br/>
 Well, I didn't really have a message.<br/>
 It was very good for a non-message.<br/>
 Oh, you're very kind.<br/>
 I talked about the anointing.<br/>
 And then I so love when I just thought about when John and Carol
 Minister, they always do show and tell.
 Yeah.<br/>
 They talk about the kingdom and the demonstrate the kingdom.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So I thought we'd have fun doing that.
 So we played with the anointing and some people got healed, which was fun.
 It was really fun.<br/>
 It was fun to watch people's faces that had never seen anything like that before.
 Um, I really liked it.<br/>
 It was really good.<br/>
 The rest of the week could basically be summarized as meetings and events.
 Yes, many meetings and many events.<br/>
 Yeah, which is great.<br/>
 I mean, we're either meeting with people or meeting with our team or meeting people
 for ministry appointments, that sort of stuff.
 Yes.<br/>
 And then events you had a plethora of events with birthdays and gender
</p><ul>
  <li>Gender reveals all kinds of craziness.
  </li><li>And then you're speaking,
 it's where you spoke Wednesday night.
  </li><li>I did, yeah, just started a Sun Ship series
 for four weeks.
  </li><li>And then with 24 hours notice,
 you were speaking this morning.
  </li><li>True, yep, it was very good.
  </li><li>It was very good.
  </li><li>Was it?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You look very colorful.
 I got a great picture of you on Instagram.
  </li><li>You did, it is a good picture.
 I don't usually like pictures of me speaking
 I think 'cause I make so many faces.
 while I wait until you're making a good face.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>You should see the ones I rejected.
  </li><li>Oh dear.
 Maybe I can look at those later.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was fun to be speaking.
 I really didn't know what I was gonna talk on
 even at 8.30 last night.
 So it came together eventually.
  </li><li>Do you know I got a Bible?
  </li><li>You did get a Bible.
  </li><li>We talked a couple of weeks ago about
 my trouble in finding a Bible I'd like.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And in the process of that,
 sharing with a friend about my woes and Jonathan sent me over this link to this Bible that
 the video of it is almost like a parody of luxury products. But I went to our local Christian
 bookstore, which is called what? Life, why? Thank you. And asked them if they would order
 it in and they would and they price matched the ridiculous price I found on overstock.
 Which is amazing. Yeah. So I ordered it just to see what it would be like. And it meets
 some of my criteria quite well.
 Which criteria does it meet?
 Well, I wanted a new living translation.
 Yes.
 Because that's a version I want to read.
 I have all the versions to study.
 Yes.
 I don't have all the versions.
 I have many versions.
 Yeah.
 But I would imagine a room who's listening to this.
 Like, Oh, no, you should read.
 I do.
 When I'm studying, I consult many, but reading for pleasure, I love the new living translation.
 OK.
 So it's that OK.
 It is single column.
 Yes.
 Like the rest of the world's books.
 Yes. And it's got nice typography. It's laid out really nicely. The font's nice, good font size.
 I love you. Yes, you do. But then the things that I have to overlook is it's got some footnotes
 and it's got some reference notes down the side. If they would have admitted that,
 I think I would have been overwhelmed. But it doesn't have that many. No, but it has some.
 It's visual clutter. And the paper is a bit too thin. I can still see through text on the other
 Well, if it doesn't look like that, you would have a very heavy book because it would be
 about twice the size.
 Regardless, it's a beautiful Bible.
 I look forward to having it.
 It's got a lifetime warranty.
 It's got a kind of warranty or document.
 I don't know, but I think we should see what we can get out of a lifetime warranty.
 Okay.
 I might see if they have a copy of a Bible that I would like from your company.
 You already have a Bible you like.
 It's true.
 I do.
 quite done with the yet. No, you're not. But anyway, I was thrilled. I found a Bible that I liked.
 Excellent.
 Other high points we saw in the New Captain America movie, which we shouldn't talk about because they're
 spoilers. It was so good. Can we say that? We can. I would even go to far as to say it should have
 been called Avengers 2.75. Why 2.75? Well, they were missing Hulk and Thor for it to be Avengers 3.
 but they had some pretty cool additions okay yeah.
 Do you want to know my real highlight of the week was.
 I love getting all of our listeners feedback.
 Really oh my gosh you guys are so kind you haven't read any yet because I just read them all as they come in and then I'll collate all the information and you can read the.
 The summary rather than read every single one to come in but you guys are so amazing thank you to everybody who's gone and filled in some feedback we're going to keep it open for one more week so.
 If you haven't had the opportunity to go or you haven't heard about it,
 we'll keep it open for one more week.
 If you want the chance to win $100 of awesome stuff, we'd love to hear from you.
 It's a really short survey.
 The link will be in the show notes.
 It helps us greatly.
 And actually, you guys have great thoughts, some of which were implementing this very episode.
 So cool.
 Hey, do you want to know the highlight of my week was?
 I'd like to think I know what your highlight was, but it's probably not.
 receiving my first full shipment of a boy named Ben.
 Oh, your new book?
 It's in.
 Yes, we talked about a couple of weeks ago, didn't we? Give us a quick synopsis for those who may
 have missed it.
 It's a children's book that is illustrated and written by me with serious help from the Holy Spirit,
 and it's about our friend Ben Farley, who went home to be with the Lord about a year and a half ago.
 Yeah, it's based on the life of an incredible young man.
 Yes.
 which we've talked about on our podcast before and we've written articles about on our website.
 If you go to lnag.com/ben, you can learn more about Ben.
 Yeah. And you can see the book. And one of the things that Ben's family did, which just gives you a glimpse of the awesomeness of the Farley clan,
 is in lieu of flowers, a Ben's funeral, the family asked for some donations to a couple of places.
 I remember one of them was the hospice where Ben's been his last few days.
 But also to the school of supernatural life where Ben was not only a student and the graduate,
 but also a staff member and in speaking to the Farley family about writing the book.
 Because it's an awkward thing like, "Hey, can we write a book about your son who really
 touched our lives and we want to write children's book?"
 And of course, they were only too happy and very gracious to work with you and super supportive.
 But one of the things we're doing for every copy of the book sold, a dollar of the sales
 price goes towards the Ben Farley scholarship that was set up in Ben's honor to help students
 who might not otherwise be able to attend the school in partial funding of their school.
 That's fun. It's very fun. I just think it's amazing that even in Ben's death,
 he is still inspiring people through the book, through his life, through stories that people
 keep alive and also through his scholarship. So where to go Ben? We love you and we miss you.
 All right, our main topic tonight comes from a question.
 Do you know, here's a sneak preview of some of the feedback that we got.
 They said, please don't skip the listeners questions.
 We love when you answer the listeners questions.
 -Really? -Yeah, and what's funny is often we skip
 listeners questions either because we feel like we've talked too long or it's too late at night.
 We think we'll do it next week and then we realize we can go weeks without
 doing any. -And so I was working through the backlog of brilliant
 listeners questions and I thought we could answer this question as our main topic for this evening.
 -Okay. -This is the question. -Yeah.
 -It is from Rachel. -Yep.
 And she said this year thanks to my awesome sister-in-law Bethany who attended your school.
 I experienced a transformation in my walk with God while reading
 Spiritual Slavery to Spiritual Sunship by Jack Frost. Great book.
 An amazing book by an amazing man. I can now call God Papa. I am a daughter,
 exclamation mark. As someone who's been in ministry for over 10 years now, I had so many
 wounds that I was blinded to and was totally living like an orphan. God has been in all
 caps so ridiculously good and has taken me on an incredible journey that has been the
 most amazing adventure of my life. Several people at my home church are experiencing
 a similar awakening to Father's love and our pastor is so very open as well. We are
 all hungry for what Father wants to do among us, like crazy hungry. What advice could you
 give us as we seek to live out this sonship message in an environment that is somewhat foreign to it.
 I thank God for you every time I open your book finding father. I'm on week nine and I'm hoping
 it never ends L O L. What a gift to the body of Christ. Thank you. Love your podcast to you guys
 are so fun and so freeing. Well, that's very kind of you to say so. So before we jump in and answer
 that question. I wanted to talk this week about the orphan spirit. It's something that we've
 taught on for many years. It's something you've written about at length, and you're actually doing
 a four-week series of church on the antidote to the orphan spirit, which is living like a son.
 Let's start right back at the beginning. Where did you first hear the message of the orphan spirit?
 I first heard it from Jack Frost.
 Me too.
 Yeah.
 I was on staff in Toronto, the church in Toronto, and John and Carol had asked Jack to come
 in and do a day with all of the staff.
 And it was hearing it that first time, and Jack would teach it with this chart, an orphan
 to sonship chart. I was in shock and horror looking at the chart and realizing I was not
 really living like a son.
 We will put a copy of that chart in the show notes. When we teach on it, we call it the
 chart of doom and we get the audience to make that noise for a moment of levity. But go
 on. Sorry, I don't mean this interrupt you.
 So I remember looking at the chart and the Holy Spirit suggested to me,
 "Hey, you know what, you're not all one or all the other.
 Why don't you write a little graph from one to 10?"
 So I did that on each topic.
 And then I asked God, "Okay, how am I doing on this one?
 Where about am I?"
 I kept that piece of paper and then a number of months later,
 Jack actually came back to teach again.
 and I hadn't spent hours in intercession or gone to get deliverance from the orphan spirit
 because of course you can't be delivered from it. It's more of a mindset.
 I was all moving over towards sonship. It was just like almost just by recognizing and being
 able to own, "Oh, actually what I think is normal behavior is orphan behavior. How can I move towards
 that kind of opened the door for the Holy Spirit to work a lot, my heart.
 Right. I was a sim. I heard Jack teaching in Edinburgh, actually.
 Yeah. And he taught the same chart, the orphan to son chart, a chart that we later borrowed
 and would also teach all over the world wherever we'd go on this message because it's so revolutionary.
 But basically, the concept is, although scripture is very, very clear that
 positionally we are children of God, there's a big difference between being positioned as a
 a son of God and living like you're a son of God.
 And what this chart does is it diagnoses brilliantly two extremes, the way an orphan
 or spiritual orphan views the world and a way a spiritual son views the world.
 Now the danger with this is most of the information describing the way an orphan lives is actually
 the way most of the world runs.
 So without us knowing we're trained to operate and to think like we have to fight for everything
 in this world, that we have to fight, strive, compete and earn for everything in life rather
 than having an understanding that we have a heavenly Father who actually delights in
 us and would love to bring us good things.
 Right.
 That as sons we have an inheritance we don't have to strive for.
 Right.
 But if we don't know that everybody else is a competition for blessing.
 Right.
 Everybody that you see is a doggy dog world and you have to be better, sharper, faster,
 fitter, louder to prove that you're worth more than everybody else.
 Right. Even in the church.
 Oh, especially in the church. But also in the whole world. So you are fatigued constantly by
 trying to one up everybody and keep up appearances. And until I heard this teaching, I just thought,
 "Oh, this is normal."
  </li><li>This is what we all do.
  </li><li>Right, that there isn't a,
 I mean, be nice while doing it, for sure,
 'cause we're good Christians.
 But when I heard Jack teach us, I was like,
 "You mean there's a different way of living?"
 And honestly, the first couple of times I heard it,
 I just thought it was far-fetched nonsense.
 (laughing)
 Like, seriously.
 Because he would talk about like,
 "What do you do when everything hits the fan?"
 Well, for an orphan, they throw a temper tantrum,
 they scream, they get distressed,
 self-comfort with food. I try and manipulate others. Yeah. Whereas the sun seeks to find quiet
 solitude with this father. I'm like, "Who in the world does that?" When your tire blows out,
 you're like, "I'm just going to so conress with my father." You know, and you know,
 Jack has some hysterical stories. And as you hear this teaching, you begin to realize,
 "Oh, I'm operating from a paradigm or a mindset or a way of thinking that actually indicates I
 really do think I'm all alone and it's up to me to fight and to protect and to provide.
 Rather than simply being a son. And I think the problem with sonship,
 when you don't know about sonship is it seems an irresponsible way to live.
  </li><li>Does it?
  </li><li>Well, here's why. I think that we've equated someone along the line that worrying about things
 proves that we care about things. But worry doesn't equal care at all.
 And so to not worry about things because you're trusting your father can seem irresponsible.
 Yes. Do you know what I mean? Yes, you mean to others looking on.
 Oh, I mean, even to yourself. Okay. Thinking, why am I relaxed about this? Why am I training
 myself to be relaxed about the fact that I have? Right. Shouldn't I be stressed? Yeah.
 But your great line of Alan, the king is still in the throne. He's not shocked by this. He's not
 surprised. What if this is an opportunity for an upgrade? What if this event has just happened
 that would normally send you into tailspin is actually the landscape in which God's going to do
 the next miracle and reveal to you another side of his father heart. Right.
 Like that is a different way of looking at life. Right. Things we don't consider.
 So off the top of your head, can you think of, because I don't want to pull out notes,
 I don't really want to do a teaching. I'd rather talk about it. But the chart has a bunch of funny
 things in it. Give me some topic from the chart and talk about how an orphan thinks about it and
 how a son thinks about it. While you're thinking about that, I'm going to reiterate that though we
 talk about the orphan's spirit, it's not a demonic spirit per se. I mean, there's demonic influences
 empowering how we think for sure. But it's more of a mindset or a pattern of thinking than it is
 or a lifestyle than it is a demonic spirit that can just be cast out. It's changing the way you
 think so you change where you live. Right. Well, what about like peer relationships?
 All right. So for peer relationships, typically the orphan, their MO is striving and competition
 and rivalry and one-apping and one-apping and needing to be the biggest guy in the room with the best
 stories. That's right. But sometimes we're so polite in that, because we're so Christianized
 that were very subtle improving that were better than everybody else.
 But basically, for example, well, we're elegantly putting people down so that we can feel better about ourselves.
 Yeah, but that's still an indication that oh, is this the first time you saw blind eyes open that must be exciting for you.
 Or have the look, I love the cruise.
 You have the 16 inch big where you have the 19 inch.
 Dutch outfit. I mean, they're very similar. They're very similar. It's just mind speaker.
 And it's, you know, until you, until you realize it's going on, it's normal. Once you realize it's
 going on, it's nauseating. Yeah. Like the orphan can't let their friend or somebody say at an
 event or at a party be excited about the thing that they saw because they need to be the biggest
 guy in the room, right? So whatever it was that you saw God do, they have to tell their
 story of something better rather than allow you just to be celebrated and allow you to
 have that moment. I remember the Holy Spirit said to me, "Other people's greatness doesn't
 come with the expansive viewers." Yeah. And that's the way a son thinks. You can allow
 somebody else to be great because it wasn't your allocation of greatness they took. But
 to an orphan, that's the way they think. Right. And not only allow them to be great,
 but actually celebrate the fact that they're great and not feel like you're less than because
 they're having their moment of being great.
 Even in areas that has nothing to do with you.
 So somebody else gets promoted or somebody else buys a house or somebody else moves in
 an area of life that you wish you could move in.
 They're not in direct competition with you.
 Them getting a head doesn't mean you don't get a head, but whatever.
 Whenever that thing rises in your heart, it's like, "I'm gonna..."
 But I wanted to do it.
 That's an orphan that's playing fair.
 Yeah, and the orphan I think just thinks that God has crocodile arms.
 What do you mean by that?
 Like really short arms.
 Can't possibly reach out and help me here, you know.
 Right, so I have to do it for myself.
 So I have to do it for myself, yeah.
 Which leads to relentless self-promotion networking.
 I mean, it's just exhausting because you have to fight for what you can get.
 I was going to say it must be exhausting, but I remember feeling like I needed to make
 a way for myself and it was exhausting.
 Right.
 Rather than trusting that God has got your life in control, you will bring the people
 you need into your life and live from favor.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Yeah.
 Live from favor rather than fighting for what you think you're worth.
 Yeah.
 How does the sun live in peer relationships?
 I think he, I don't remember the exact wording of the chart,
 but I think a son is able to celebrate others
 and doesn't feel less than when somebody else is getting promoted
 or having a great season or a great life.
 And can genuinely enjoy other people's success
 and promote other people ahead of them
 because they know that promotion
 that comes from the East North from the West, but from the Lord.
 Right. It's not a competition.
 It's totally not a competition. And you see that in the lives of people who are completely
 content to be themselves. Like we're blessed with a bunch of people who are very close
 to us, who are happy in their own skin, which means they're not intimidated by the successes
 of other people. They don't feel less than, which means they can also promote other people
 and talk about other people's successes without feeling like it's diminishing the successes they
 have.
 Right.
 Because they found a different source of satisfaction.
 Right.
 The Father's love, not achievement and wealth.
 I would say grace in our culture confuses a lot of people, especially, you know, when
 we have, I've got to be careful how to say this because I don't want to be speaking ill
 of anyone.
 But often when we have visiting speakers or people who may be trying to connect to our
 church for maybe we've got friends, we've got mutual friends and they've heard them
 talk well about grace and they would love to connect. Often they connect us with credentials
 and credentials aren't what is interesting to a son, relationships what's interesting
 to a son. So credentials are usually a very quick way of establishing where you are on
 the pecking order whereas the son's not so concerned about the pecking order, they're
 concerned about their father's affection. Right. That's really good.
 Does that sound okay? I think that's fine. I don't have anybody in mind where I'm talking
 about that. It's just a dynamic I've noticed over the years.
 That often, an orphan tries to tell you who they are, whereas we like to
 figure it out for ourselves. We'll find out who you are. We don't need to be,
 don't try and tell us about you, just be yourself and we'll discover what you are.
 Yeah. What about their view of authority?
 Oh, dear God, this is the fastest way to identify areas of orphanhood in our hearts.
 For sure.
 And I love what you said, babe, that it's not a binary state.
 You're an orphan, you're a son.
 That's not the way it works.
 It's, there's so many different areas of our heart where we can mature into
 sonship in one area, but realizes orphanhood in another area.
 But one of the great determinators is your view of authority in any description.
 Right.
 Because for the orphan, they're distrustful towards them and they lack a heart attitude
 of submission.
 Well, that's because all authority is a source of pain.
 Right.
 So if you haven't dealt with all of those things and you haven't dealt with the reason
 you think authority is a source of pain. No wonder you can't enter into being a son,
 but it also means you're not going to enter into being a son to the Father.
 It's totally.
 Because he's a king. You can't serve a king if you can't be under leadership.
 Right. Yeah, John, I want you to say if you haven't learned to submit to
 earthly authority, good luck serving a king for eternity.
 Yeah. Right. There's truth to that, isn't there?
 I still remember the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard when leaders were trying to speak
 into my life. This leader is trying to do what they do, but I was receiving all their input as
 criticism or rejection because I hadn't learned that leaders are safe.
 And to be fair, all leaders are not safe.
 True. But any leaders that would come to me to try and help me, I would not view as
 You're seeing value in me and you want me to reach my potential.
 I would feel like you're seeing what's wrong with me and therefore I need to defend it.
 I need to defend myself.
 I need to hunker down.
 And that's just an area of my heart that didn't know it was love, didn't know it was safe.
 Didn't trust leaders.
 Well, I did the exact same thing with John and Carol.
 Totally.
 You know, when they took me in, they took in somebody who had no grid for proper authority or that
 authority could be safe or could actually care.
 and then they try and speak into my life.
 And even if on the outside, I was smiling on the inside,
 I was either furious or just so sad, you know, thinking,
 but I thought you loved me.
 Why would you say these things about me if you loved me?
 Because I didn't have any grid for discipline being loved.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, I didn't understand that.
 So I was just like, you're just, you're being critical.
 Why aren't you loving me?
 You're supposed to love me.
 Now way farther down the road, of course, I'm like, oh, so thankful.
 I'm so thankful that they did pull me up and say, hey, what about this?
 Hey, let's look at this.
 Hey, can I help you with this?
 At the time I didn't love it, but I learned to submit to authority and I learned to let
 them have a voice in my life.
 And I think that's why I grew.
 Let's talk about submitting to authority for a second.
 Yeah.
 This is a great litmus test for orphan heartedness.
 Yeah.
 Yeah. Most orphans are absolutely fine to quote, unquote, submit to authority.
 So long as the authority that's leading them is letting them do what they were going to do anyway.
 Right. But as soon as a leader says, you know, I don't think we want to do that. I wonder if
 whatever, it doesn't even matter the scenario. But if it's a scenario that is different or
 contrary to what the orphan was wanting, look for an alarming reaction.
 Because when confronted, the true submission comes when you're asked to do something that you
 don't want to do. Or you don't get to do something you want to do. Before that, it was just you
 doing what you wanted anyway, and you're well aligned with what your leader went. There was no
 submission. There was just somebody, somebody dumb. And I've seen that in my own life. It's a
 great test. And one of the things I love, even to this day, running things past my leaders,
 that I think is good, that I think is God, I feel great about is, if I'm still not prepared to drop
 it when my leaders are like, yeah, I don't think that's it, then I want that thing more
 than I want to be led by God. Because God speaks through your leaders.
 And the thing is too, is that there's safety in having input from your leaders, right? In a
 multitude of witnesses, there's wisdom. The trouble is, and you touched on this earlier,
 there are a lot of unsafe leaders. In fact, there's a lot of orphans who are leaders.
 Leading churches, yeah. Because orphans want to be the top dog. So by the very nature,
 they want to be in leadership for the wrong reasons. And that just opens up a whole other
 the can of worms.
 Yeah, for sure.
 For sure.
 And then with the goal, let's talk about sons with their view of leaders.
 And by the way, sons includes daughters.
 Yeah.
 We're talking about this idea of sonship, people who are so intimately acquainted with the
 father's love that they live like a little son.
 I think Jack says that sons sees authority as messengers of God for good in their lives.
 Great way of good.
 And you know, I've even had some authority that, you know, afterwards turns out it wasn't
 that awesome.
 But in my honoring of them actually turned out fine for me, you know, crazy how that
 works.
 Right?
 But I mean, I guess you're, you know, I remember when I was writing Finding Father,
 one of the only thing that Patricia King said, you know, you probably want to add this is
 How do you identify safe leadership to get under?
 Because you're encouraging people to get underneath and push up.
 And again, she was saying, gosh, there's a lot of leaders out there that aren't safe.
 And the only thing I could do was describe John and Carol, because
 they're what I think of when I think of safe leaders.
 Like people that really, I mean, they are discerning.
 They're not going to hold any punches.
 They're going to punch nicely if that works as an expression, but they're not going to leave things
 alone or whatever, but they do have your best interest at heart. You do leave every time
 talking to them, even if they had to say something hard, I knew I was loved. I knew they talked to
 me about it because they love me enough to want me to get better or to deal with the things that
 were holding me back. It is amazing how the Lord works, isn't it? Because
 he actually speaks through your earthly leaders and i'm not just talking about passes i'm talking
 about your boss your supervisor work your parents i mean anybody he's put an authority the government
 right it's incredible how he how he does that because basically in order to trust your leaders
 and god you're basically saying i'm choosing to believe that you say i'm wrong even when i think
 I'm right. Like in some areas, you know, when I think about times when we've gone to Jeff, for
 example, said, Hey, Jeff, we're thinking of doing this. What's your wisdom? And Jeff's like, I think
 this and it's contrary to what we wanted to hear. Right. Well, that's an interesting.
 There's your moment. There's your moments like, you know what I ask for? God, the leaders in my
 life, I ask for wisdom. Here it is. Am I going to reject it? Or am I going to say, all right,
 I want to trust that you see something I don't because if I've learned anything being a leader,
 it's that you look at people's lives from a completely different vantage point.
 Yeah. And I think God gives you wisdom for other people when you're leading them.
 Like he gives you perspective that you didn't have just because you have a level of authority
 to lead them and you have a level of responsibility. I'm going to answer for you if I'm leading you.
 Terrifying. Yeah.
 But awesome at the same time.
 And the other thing is like when we're talking about finding safe leaders, both John and Carol
 and Jeff and Becky, like if they get it wrong, they'll come back and say they got it wrong.
 Right.
 And so that's another thing that makes them safe because I can go, okay, well, that's not how I
 saw it or that's not what I imagined this conversation was going to go like. And
 I might even be a little bit disappointed, but God, I'm going to give that back to you. And I know
 that if this is your plan, it's gonna come back around
 and I know that, you know, Jeff is great to say,
 hey, I missed it on this one and whatever.
 So as long as you're not dealing with unreasonable pride,
 unreasonable, probably any pride is unreasonable.
  </li><li>Yeah, what's the reasonable of my pride?
 I'm in trouble. - What's a reasonable
 man of pride, well, you know.
  </li><li>How proud can I be in some reasonable.
 Tell the story, I love the story.
 Tell the story about you almost being released into ministry.
 The garage door clicker story.
 Because this is a great story about it was my moment orphans and sons and
 Dreams being given and taken and tell that story because I think it illustrates brilliantly and then we'll try and answer Rachel's question. Okay?
 well, um
 You know previous to the story happening
 In January I had been speaking to the Lord about the coming year and the Lord said to me
 You know by the fall you'll step out into full-time ministry and this was in 2001
 And I was like, you know at the time I really liked my job at a great job free car free gas free insurance
 you know, there's a lot that was really good about it and I
 Was sort of like wow, okay?
 Could you confirm that for me?
 So I had three different prophetic people pick me out and give me the exact same word
 uh, and about, you know, but stepping off of a cliff and the rocks coming up to meet my feet.
 And, uh, I was like, okay, I guess this is happening. So I sat down with, um, Fred and with John.
 And in my mind, I was like, you know, they're going to say no. And that will be my greatest
 reason why I'm not actually stepping out in this. Right. You know, I was sort of expecting both of
 them to go, "Well, you know." And well, that didn't happen. So I met with Fred and said,
 "You know, this is what I feel like the Lord's saying." And I'm, you know, they had talked
 to me previously about being one of the itinerant ministers full-time for TACF. And so I just
 said, "You know, I feel like God's talking to me about doing that and not just part-time
 anymore, but, you know, traveling full-time." And Fred was like, "Yes, let's do it. That's
 Awesome. I'll send a letter to all the P.I.H. churches, blah, blah, blah.
 And I was like, this is your dream on the horizon.
 Right. Everything goes promised in the last eight years.
 But this is not a gamified right.
 Yeah, he's been talking to me about it for eight years.
 And I've been in this process of getting my heart healed and dying to all this kind of stuff.
 And I was kind of at the place where I was like, oh, you know what?
 I'm okay without the dream.
 I'll just keep going along as I'm going.
 And then the Lord's like, gotcha.
 You know, anyway, so I was thinking, OK, I'm just going to meet with John.
 John's going to be the one that stops this.
 Like John will be the one that goes,
 well, I don't know, you know, kind of thing.
 And I met with John and he's like,
 "HA, this is amazing.
 I think it's totally God.
 I think within a year you're going to have to say
 no to invitations, you know, all this kind of stuff."
 And I was just like, "Oh, wow, I'm doing this.
 You know, I guess I'm actually doing this."
 And so this was, I met with John, I think, in August.
 And then in September, I felt like the Lord was like, you know, it's time to step out.
 And I was like, okay.
 And I wasn't really sure what to do.
 Like, do I just give notice?
 I don't know what the timing is.
 And then September 11th happened.
 And I got called into my VP's office and he just said, AJ, I'm sorry.
 We lost $17 million in one day.
 of being shut down because I worked in the travel industry and he said,
 we're going to start letting go of management. You're the first one to go.
 But they gave me 12 weeks severance, which was amazing.
 And a week later, they had to let go of 30 more management and they only got a
 week or two of severance each. So it was totally God.
 So I was set up to start traveling and I even had a buffer.
 You know, and they're like, you can keep the car for a few months.
 you know, while you get everything sorted.
 And as they're talking to me,
 and as they're talking to me,
 I just had a picture of like God booting me
 out of the building, you know?
 Like in a great way, I wasn't like, oh, I'm in trouble.
  </li><li>Being launched into something new.
  </li><li>But here I am and I'm like, okay, well, I guess,
 everything's a go, you know, John's fine and Fred's fine
 and, you know, I'm out of my job now
 and I guess I know that timing, yay, you know,
 let's get started.
 And I know I'm gonna get announced
 at the beginning of October at the Catch the Fire Conference,
 right before that they had a Partners in Harvest Conference.
 And so I'm gonna get sort of a commission
 and all that kind of stuff.
 And so I'm like, okay, I'm excited about this.
 And the weekend before the conference,
 on the Wednesday is the day I'm supposed to be commissioned.
 It's the Saturday, the weekend before.
 And I go with a friend of mine to another conference
 that I was supposed to speak at.
 And the other speaker was speaking first session.
 So we're just sort of driving there.
 And I get this phone call from a friend of mine
 who was on staff at the church.
 And he said, listen, I just wanted to give you a heads up.
 I don't know what happened.
 I don't know if Fred and John haven't talked
 or what the deal is, but you're not being released this week.
 And they're not going to commission you.
 And so I just wanted you to know that.
 So it's not a surprise when it comes to Wednesday
 and you're not one of the people that they call up.
  </li><li>And what happens in your heart?
  </li><li>I was like, oh, I was one of those people
 that didn't really show emotion
 and I was in a car with other people,
 but we had just arrived at the place
 where we're having the event.
 And so I was like, hey guys, go on inside.
 I'll be in in a second, I finished the phone call
 and I hung up the phone.
 And for a second, I felt numb.
 And then I was like super upset.
 Like just like, they, what?
 They said yes, they both said yes,
 we had all this stuff printed to hand out to everybody.
 And now I have no job and what are they doing?
 And just totally freaking out.
 And internally I wasn't saying anything on the outside.
 I was just like on the inside, just like what?
 And-
  </li><li>I know you're feeling abandoned.
  </li><li>I'm feeling abandoned.
 I'm feeling sad.
 I'm worried how am I gonna buy groceries.
  </li><li>The rock has been pulled out from underneath your feet.
 Yeah, I mean, I was just a deluge of all of these emotions.
 Yeah, everything, right?
 And I have to speak in an hour.
 The first guy's going, he's going to go to ministry time
 and then I have to get up and speak and I'm like,
 "God, I'm shaken to my core."
 And so I went in, I don't remember what he spoke about
 'cause I was still processing with the Lord
 and he did some kind of altar call for something.
 I mean, honestly, it could have been for three-legged dogs
 and I would have gone up, I was a mess.
 But I went up to the front and I started crying
 and then I went into this vision.
 And in the vision, it was me,
 and I was in this plexiglass box,
 you know, like a really thick plexiglass.
 And on one side, it was absolutely solid plexiglass,
 but it was really transparent.
 It wasn't like scratched or whatever.
 And so I saw a picture of all of these people
 that I was friends with.
 And I was like, huh, as I'm looking at them, the Lord said,
 yeah, those are most of your friends.
 You keep them on the outside.
 And I was like, oh, and he's like, you know,
 you control what they see and how much access
 they have to your heart.
 I'm like, oh, okay.
 So then I turned to my right and there was a wall that looked
 kind of like it had holes like Swiss cheese,
 you know, different sized walls.
 And there was a couple of my closer friends there.
 And they, you know, they could come and they could actually touch me.
 They could reach their hands in and I could reach my hands out,
 but I was still the one in control.
 I could back away so they couldn't touch me or access me.
 And, you know, I was still, I was still in control of those relationships.
 Then on the right, there was another wall with a door.
 And I saw two of my friends that had keys, you know, but it's funny because in the picture,
 there was a little bell above the door.
 So even though I'd given them even more access
 and I'd given them keys as it were,
 I still had a warning of when they were trying to enter
 and I could still choose to turn a good smile towards them
 and look like everything was perfect.
 But the terrifying wall was the fourth wall
 and there was a garage door on it
 and I had no lock on that door
 and holding the garage door openers in this vision
 were John and Fred.
 And as I looked at this garage door
 and the garage door openers and the two of them almost in horror,
 the Lord said to me, will you trust the fathers I've put in your life?
 And this is the big test of the orphan.
 Right.
 And I was like, Oh, God, I'm sorry.
 I've spent the last hour spinning, like just spinning because I haven't been
 trusting them.
 And I've questioned everything and I just started weeping.
 And I was like, Lord, I do.
 I trust them.
 They're wonderful men.
 And if they think I'm not ready, I'm not ready.
 And that's okay.
 And I was able to get up and minister later that day
 and do whatever.
 And I was driving home with my friend and he said to me,
 so what are you gonna do?
 'Cause I told him and I said, well,
 I'm highly employable.
 Like my last job didn't want me to leave the restaurant
 in the hotel that I worked for before that.
 They didn't want me to leave you either.
 So I'm going to go get a job and I'm going to be okay.
 And whenever this is supposed to happen, it happens.
 And so I actually was like, okay, like I went home that night
 and started working on my resume to get it up to date
 so that I could get it.
  </li><li>So you were feeling you'd resolved in your heart.
 Okay, if I'm not being released in the ministry,
 that's totally fine.
 I trust God.
  </li><li>My life is not over.
  </li><li>I trust my dads.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, God's good.
 He still has a plan.
 You know, this isn't what I spent six months getting ready to do this.
 So there was effort involved.
 There was money involved.
 There was all that, but I was like, okay, God, if, if they think I'm not ready, I'm not ready.
 Right.
 So you were moving towards sunship in that, and that as a son's response, you know what, Lord?
 I still trust you.
 Doesn't look like my timing, but you know what?
 Yeah.
 I love you.
 You're good.
 You have a plan.
 Yeah.
 I'm good.
 It's going to be okay.
 Right.
 I don't get it, but it's going to be okay.
 And so anyway, the next morning I came into church and as I walked in the back door, Fred
 saw me from the front and he literally ran across the church and it's a huge church,
 you know, and he came over and he's like, I was just talking to so and so.
 And he said that he had told you whatever and that's not true.
 And he's like, I don't know where he got that information, but we are announcing you on
 Wednesday.
 Everything is fine.
 We're releasing you in a full-time ministry and we're commissioning you and blah, blah.
 And I just laughed because I was like, God, you're so funny.
 It was all a test of the heart.
 It was a test of my heart.
 And I passed, I think.
 You know?
 And so that, I mean, as much as I don't have a theology that God tests your heart, I think
 that circumstances can come up, the test your heart.
 And it's great to have those tests because later on, you know why you did what you did.
 I have a theology for God testing.
 Yeah.
 Proverbs 17 verse 3 says, "The crucible for silver and the furnace for gold, but the Lord
 tests the heart."
 Yeah.
 It really does.
 Yeah.
 Because he's constantly doing stuff in our heart.
 He's constantly fashioning us into the likeness of Jesus and he wants us to see it from our
 perspective so that we can see the change.
 I do totally agree with that.
 I just meant like I've met people that think everything in life is a test that's that
 and it's all planned by God.
 not, you know, your car didn't break down because you didn't put oil in it.
 It's a test, you know, I just mean like I'm not that person.
 Right.
 But I do think God tests our heart.
 I love that story because God knows the end from the beginning.
 So he knew that nothing had changed.
 Yeah.
 And I loved that he helped restore your heart to joy.
 I loved that he saw you in distress, met you in distress, but used it as a teaching
 moment, as a our honey.
 Yeah.
 And then showed me what was really going on in my heart.
 Yeah.
 and actually you can trust me and yeah hey what do you want to step into it this moment right are you fighting for your future or are you just willing
 to trust me that I'm good and I'm going to bring everything through to completion yeah I think absolutely the reaction in my heart to begin with was orphan but the action I took with son.
 Yeah you know so and it moved there fairly quickly.
 Yeah so that's that's good.
 Well let's answer Rachel's question and having given a little overview of the difference between a sun and an orphan.
 Her question was what advice could you give us as we seek to live out the sunship message in an environment that is somewhat foreign to it.
 I think one of the main things would be you know to to coin Danny so x phrase keep your love on you know you.
 For all of us, we need to have grace for people that aren't quite seeing things away.
 We're seeing them yet and not be the person that knows the best way.
 So learn to love other people really well, even if they don't get you and they don't understand
 your new revelation and and press into God for help with that.
 Press into being full of his love so you have something to give away.
 That's right, because we all walk in the light of the revelation we've received.
 So, if you've just got a revelation of a son, recognize it for the previous 20 years prior
 to yesterday, you were living as an orphan.
 Because there's a danger that we become polarizing in our view of people, other such an orphan.
 But we've got to understand that people aren't orphans.
 We know already that they're sons.
 If they're believers, they are sons.
 They're in different stages on the road to sonship.
 It's the stage of learning.
 And we would have orphan moments.
 We'd call our orphaning out.
 I say we would.
 We still do.
 I had one last week.
 I had one where I just locked myself in my bedroom and just cried out to the Lord,
 Lord, I screwed up.
 I need your help.
 I need your wisdom.
 Would you help me?
 And I was feeling like an orphan.
 Yeah.
 But I responded as a son.
 I locked myself in my room to find my daddy and he came and he just, you know, he was
 so gentle.
 He was just like, "Oh, he met me in my pain," said Alan.
 I totally understand how you're feeling.
 And it must be horrible to feel like this.
 Can I show you what's really going on?"
 And so tender in his response.
 Yeah.
 And it doesn't matter if you react like an orphan, if you respond like a son.
 Yeah.
 All of our hearts are being tenderly cared for by the Father.
 and it's his good intention to tenderly treat us with kindness and gently point out,
 "Oh, here's where you're living way below the glorious standard I have for you. Here's where
 you're still thinking like an orphan." Here's where you don't realize how loved you are.
 That's right. And so you're on this glorious adventure no matter how appalled you may feel
 that you've been thinking like an orphan. Be excited about the transformation he's going to
 bring in the miracle that's going to come when you start thinking like a son.
 Yeah.
 You know, the obvious place to go from here is to talk about finding father because you
 actually wrote your book to help people in their transformation from orphanhood to sonship.
 Right.
 I mean, the whole, all of us were once upon a time lost.
 Yeah.
 And then Jesus came and found us and showed us the way to the father.
 Yeah.
 And often we've confused salvation with the fullness of sonship.
 Yeah, for sure being saved in living like a son or two different things. Yeah, I think too. Most of us have learned how to survive
 And that's what orphans do they survive right? They're really good survivors, right?
 And
 Sons though they're they don't just survive things they thrive and they and they do that because they know that they're left
 And they know that they're taking care of right. Yeah, they're they're living for someone else's vision
 they're living to make their daddy happy.
 Yeah.
 I mean, they already know that daddy's happy that he loves them.
 Yeah.
 But it's so fun partnering with God as a son rather than trying to strive for his affection.
 Right.
 But anyway, finding father, you wrote this brilliant book.
 It's 12 week study guide.
 You can do individually.
 There's interactive exercises to do almost every day.
 The idea is that each day you have a little devotional and you get two days off a week.
 give written five devotionals a week, all into the understanding, the heart of God for us,
 live like a son. It's an incredible people all around the world constantly send us feedback,
 saying, "Oh, this book's totally changed my life. I love it. I love it." And so if you have--
 I'm so glad.
 Yeah, so am I, because it would be terrible if it was the other way.
 Right. I hate this book.
 If you haven't read it, we highly recommend you get it, not just because we wrote it. We
 You highly recommend it for the transformation that it brings.
 And you can get it straight from our website, go to alanag.com and you'll find a link straight

 We had an awesome moment actually this week of Tia reading the book out loud, which was
 just so fun for her to go through a book from start to finish and it'd be something I wrote.
 Right.
 Tia our little six year old who's reading like a genius.
 I love it.
 Also, I know that our applications are open for Grace and her school of supernatural life.
 It's a school designed to help people discover the greatness in them by discovering the greatness
 of God. We have tremendous fun watching people's lives get changed. We saturate you in this
 incredible presence of God for about eight months. You discover how to hear God for yourself,
 learn about his kindness and goodness, and you come out the other side completely transformed.
 Adrian, I've got the privilege of teaching on that. It's one of the things we love to do.
 And we'd love to spend eight months guiding you through this transformation. Applications
 are to be in by June 15th. So I really encourage you to get your apps in. School starts in September
 of this year, runs through April of next year. And if you're already a graduate of year one,
 come back for year two. We'd love to take you deeper, draw out the leader in you, and teach you
 how to understand, apply, and fall in love with the Bible. For show notes from today's show,
 just head on over to alanaj.com/102.
 Have an incredible week and we'll be with you next week.
 Yup.
