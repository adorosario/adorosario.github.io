<p> I live in a days podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Episode 92.<br/>
 It is episode 92.<br/>
 What are you thinking?<br/>
 I'm thinking, wow, these poor people listen to us for 91 episodes.
 And they've come back for more.<br/>
 Yes, they have.<br/>
 Talk to them about this week.<br/>
 It was a good week.<br/>
 I taught on Romans on second year.<br/>
 we go through it verse by verse, which is quite fun.
 And you taught on...
</p><ul>
  <li>I taught on angels, demons, and spiritual warfare.
  </li><li>Yes, and third heaven things.
  </li><li>And third heaven experiences.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So it was fun because you're watching
 some of the students' faces be like, "Whoa!"
  </li><li>Wait, what are you talking about?
  </li><li>But it's one of the funnest weeks to teach.
  </li><li>It is very fun.
  </li><li>If you wanna hear our views on spiritual warfare,
 we recorded a podcast on that episode 41,
 go to allen and AJ.com/41 if you want to listen to that.
 Yep.
 And then emanate.
 All emanate was run by our wonderful emanate pastor, Michelle Voucher, who spoke and did
 a great job.
 She did a fantastic job.
 And then said Michelle and her wonderful husband Richard came over Thursday afternoon
 we were hanging out and they said, "What are you doing tonight?"
 And we realized Thursday night is our date night.
 Yeah, it's supposed to be our date night.
 But we hadn't got a babysitter.
 No, we often forget.
 So he said, do you want to stay and watch Marvel movies while we go on a date?
 And they were like, yes, they knew and they even came over early and played with the kids and put them to bed.
 So we just got to go and put her around for three hours.
 And literally we did Poser.
 We started on a treasure hunt trying to find a new grill.
 Well, we started off by returning random items like light bulbs, and mattress covers.
 That's the height of romance in the job.
 It was very, very sexy.
 date night has turned into returning all our overdue items.
 -The sad part is that we get excited about it.
 -Well, it's because we get money.
 -We go out. It's true.
 -We made like 100 bucks just by returning things.
 -I know. It was so good.
 -Then we wandered around Costco.
 -No, we didn't get to.
 -I love wandering around.
 -We intended to wander around Costco.
 -We got sidetracked by Willem since Sonoma.
 -That used to be our favorite date.
 Do you remember when we first started dating,
 we had no money at all.
 We would either go to Costco and wander around or go to Ikea.
 And why did I like Ikea more than Costco?
 Because they had meatballs.
 They did. They had Swedish meatballs.
 And it was cheap for plate of meatballs.
 It was like, I don't know, five or six dollars for meals.
 We did. And we still do. We don't have an Ikea, but we still go to Costco sometimes on date nights.
 But if there was an Ikea here, you know we'd be hitting Ikea.
 Oh, yeah, I'd hit Ikea.
 And then the week continued with excitement I met with our accountant.
 I think I've finished our taxes and it's not even the end of February.
 You are remarkable.
 Can you pat me on the back?
 I can't reach you from here, but sure.
 Okay.
 That's perfect.
 And then to end the week you spoke at church this morning.
 I did.
 Jeff is out of town on vacation.
 On a well-earned vacation.
 Yes.
 And they're somewhere in Australia or New Zealand.
 They're in New Zealand.
 Will they access to the internet?
 Yeah.
 They're in New Zealand and then they're doing like a cruise thing with some friends of there.
 So they're going to be gone for about three weeks.
 And so Alan and I have taken over Sunday mornings.
 I don't know if I told you this, but at some point, Abigail, our eight year old just in passing and walking down the corridor.
 She's, I think she's brushing her teeth and she says, Dad, and I was like, uh huh.
 She said, you know, it's important to love yourself because if you don't have love for yourself, how can you love your neighbors yourself?
 You can only give what you have.
 And I was like, oh, okay.
 and then she can be brushing her teeth and I'm like, my eight year old is revelating.
 But as good as all that was, the whole week has been overshadowed by something awesome
 and incredibly frustrating. I am, of course. No, no, no. There's other things to talk about.
 We've already talked about this. No, no, no. We need to. What do you want to talk about?
 Well, I wanted to say what MJ said going upstairs tonight. Sure. Okay.
 So we're going upstairs to get ready for bed.
 And MJ says, "Mommy, Jesus loves me."
 I said, "Yeah, he does. And God loves me. Yes, he does, darling."
 And if there's monsters in my room, all I do is ask Jesus to come in my room and they leave.
 And I was like, "Yeah, baby." He was like, "Because Jesus is really big."
 I said, "That's right, darling." And he just, you know,
 potted it off to bed. But it was just this random, very sweet little conversation.
 So you don't need to listen to our podcast on spiritual warfare, just that will do.
 That's a good summary.
 There you go.
 Jesus is really big.
 Back to what overshadowed this whole week with glory, genius, and extreme frustration.
 Yes.
 It's a new iPhone game.
 Oh, oh, yes.
 Well it had you up till about 11 p.m. last night making warbling noises to your iPhone.
 Well, I skillfully avoided even looking at the game until last night because you saw
 how much distress it was causing me.
 Yes, and I thought, I don't need to play a game that is all about frustration.
 Well, it's not.
 It's all about thinking outside the box.
 Yeah.
 The name of the game is called Black Box.
 And it's ingenious in so many ways.
 It's designed so that it's unlike any other game I've played.
 We wrote Little Blurb on our website.
 We'll put a link to it in our show notes that gives more detail about it.
 But it is, it's referred to say it's consumed most of my waking hours.
 Yeah, for three or four days.
 And if you like cryptic, it's like every episode of lost thrown into your world and you play
 in a game.
 You're just like, "Damn me the answers!
 What does this mean?"
 So when we went on our date on Thursday, even though we were like puttering, we were out
 looking for a gorilla and all that, Alan was playing that game the whole time.
 Well, I was trying to.
 I'd got as far as I could.
 And the lengths that you will go to to try and unlock the next levels are fairly ridiculous.
 Well, the legacy you will go to yet will not just me.
 Yes, you and your competitive friends.
 He invited some of our friends to look at the game and now they're all in some sort of competition.
 Yeah, but Will's going to win because he flies off to Australia this week.
 But I thought you said it doesn't win inside of a phone.
 Like inside of a plane, I'm sorry.
 Well, that's one of the challenges.
 We don't want to give too much away, but he's going to win one of the challenges ahead of me,
 which is why I took a road trip the other night with Jonathan.
 you guys just drove to try and beat one of them. So funny. But we were filed.
 No, last night when you're like, "Pape, when's the next time we drive somewhere far?"
 Like, Florida. Like, July. No time soon, sweetheart. No time soon.
 So anyway, that game, if you haven't checked it out already, it's called Black Box. It will
 entertain Orphistrate you for sure. I think pretty much men would be interested in that game.
 Yeah, you said that till you opened up and then you were like, how do I do this one?
 Okay, how do I do this one?
 Okay, how do I do this one?
 Yeah, so I played it for 20 minutes last night.
 Asked me if I've opened it today.
 Have you opened it today?
 No, I just was like, meh, wasn't that much fun.
 Oh, but you're nearly at the most amazing level.
 I don't believe you.
 And you just trying to hook me in so that I can be addicted like you are not going to
 happen.
 One day.
 Let's talk about settlers of cotan and addiction.
 Now, cotan is worth being addicted to.
 All right, our main topic this week.
 settlers of cajan. No, our main topic for this week is I want to talk about having a happy future.
 Yes. I think this revelation started last night, although I mentioned it briefly at church this
 morning. But you were cleaning out the garage. We should probably talk about you cleaning out
 the garage. Yes, we should. I could actually get like many points for that.
 Sidebar while we talk about the garage, then we'll go back to the main point.
 What did you do in the garage? I organized the entire garage. We got these overhead hanging
 storage things last week. And I went and organized those overhead storage things.
 Well, you went and reorganized the ones that I'd already organized.
 Yes, because they have a weight limit, which was far surpassed by your efforts to get things
 on them. Okay, wait. Did he motivate me from ever helping again?
 I'm sorry. You did a tremendous job. We actually now have a fully functional garage.
 We could pull two cars in if we wanted. As opposed to an assault course.
  </li><li>Right, exactly.
 And I swept out like every bit of spider remains,
 that sort of thing.
 So it's just--
  </li><li>Spiders.
  </li><li>I like the garage now.
  </li><li>But in, so returning to the main topic,
 in your job of cleaning up the garage,
 you found a box of old photo albums,
 you came and you're like, "Oh babe, look at these photos."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I realized that when I looked at the old photos,
 I got sad and I was like, "Holy spirit, why am I sad?"
 And I realized I don't generally spend any time looking back.
 Yeah.
 It's a big shock.
 You've noticed that.
 Have you?
 And not necessarily because the past is bad, but because I think what I have now
 and what I live in now, what I experience now, everything else pales in comparison.
 So when I see photos of myself in the past, I realize I'm sad because the person
 I'm looking at doesn't know what I know now about God.
 Yeah, I had a similar revelation looking back at pictures.
 I was showing Cindy's and pictures of me in my 20s or early 20s.
 And I realized how sad I look, you know, just desperately sad.
 Well, you were trying to kill yourself and your early 20s.
 Well, then I was just past trying to kill myself, but I was still
 dealing with dad having killed himself and all that kind of stuff.
 So it was, it was rough.
 And you could tell by looking at me, I mean, it looked rough.
 Well, I was thinking this morning in church, when I look forward, you know, when I cast
 my imagination down the line, I realize I'm filled with optimism.
 And I would attribute that to hanging out with God a lot.
 Sure.
 Because he's optimistic.
 He's the most optimistic person I've ever met.
 Right.
 You know, I was thinking about like all of our friends whose lives have been marked by
 tragedy or suffering in one way is that they don't live there anymore.
 Well, if you choose to live there, you get stuck.
 Sure, you become a volunteer to your past
 rather than a victim of it.
 Right.
 And you don't move on.
 Tell us the story about what happened to you this week.
 That's the second time it's happened to you.
 Another sidebar moment.
 Oh.
 (laughs)
 Who was I talking to?
 Somebody invite you to speak at a conference.
 Oh, that's right.
 Somebody's invited me to speak at a woman's event.
 And so I said, okay, totally I'll pray about it.
 And she's sort of explaining what the event will be like.
 And she said, oh, we have people come that have just
 had difficult things that they've navigated.
 And just to encourage people that these women,
 no matter where they're at, God can break through blah blah.
 So she said, typically we have people with abusive backgrounds,
 people that have lost children, people that husbands that cheat
 on them, people that--
 so she's going through the list of what they typically invite.
 And I know that I'm invited with two other people
 that I know to be the speakers.
 And I'm like, oh yeah, she can speak on that.
 And she can speak on that.
 And in terms of what's part of our testimonies.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>And so then when she says the bit about
 women whose husbands have cheated on them or whatever.
 And I was like, yeah.
 Gosh, I don't know who she's gonna get to speak on that.
 That's none of our testimonies.
 (laughs)
 And it literally, it probably wasn't,
 it was probably a full five minutes down the road
 I was like, "Oh, yeah, that was me."
 That was my testimony.
 But then God so fully has redeemed it
 that I keep forgetting that I walk through anything like that.
  </li><li>I just think that's amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's really cool.
  </li><li>Right, so back to my friends who in a similar situation
 as you whose past have been marked by tragic,
 like think of, we have a friend who lived in a time
 when her nation was under civil war.
 She was beaten for her faith,
 actually beaten and left for dead for her faith was eventually murdered at the hands
 of terrorists, got raised again, came back to life only to be tortured for her faith.
 And you know, we, when we hang out with her now, we're like, honey, how did you survive
 that?
 Right.
 And why are you not marked by any of the trauma of that?
 Because she's one of the most joyful people we know.
 In childlike, totally childlike.
 She just runs around like a little kid with the kids in the backyard and giggles.
 And this is what she said.
 She said, darling, he gives you grace.
 He said, "I saw the face of my beautiful Savior.
 He is marvelous."
 And my point in telling all that story is as grim as that was, it isn't her reality
 today.
 Right.
 Like everything gets better.
 That's what I love about the message of the hope of Jesus.
 It's so true.
 I think when I think about most of the people I esteem on one level or another, they kind
 of walk with a limp, don't they?
 You know, they've definitely been through stuff, but they've been through it.
 They didn't stay in it.
 They went through it and they came out the other side.
 Exactly.
 When I think about it, we both in our 20s, probably more me and my teenage years had
 brushes with really deep depression and suicide and suicidal attempts and all that kind of
 stuff.
 And really, those things seem so distant now, you know, from who we are and what our reality
 is now.
 They were something that was a place we could have gotten stuck in, but the Lord brought
 us out of those places and we didn't choose to go back.
 And he's so merciful to do that.
 Like I remember my early twenties were just a write off in terms of despair.
 And now when I, you know, when I think about that person, then I have no
 correlation with him.
 And that's ridiculous because it's the same person.
 It was me, but it doesn't feel like it.
 I'm not haunted by those experiences.
 Right.
 And I just think that's a testimony to the power of God that he makes all things new.
 He's, he's so good.
 So taking taking your testimony, thinking what he did then to now apply that same faith for what
 you're going through now going forward. Right. Totally. You know, the book of Psalms is filled
 with that David's experience, of course. But when I think about the future, I'm absolutely filled
 with excitement because with God, his potential is incredible. Well, in truth, we can't even
 possibly imagine the potential.
 I couldn't imagine we are where we are.
 No, I couldn't either.
 It's like bizarre.
 I spent some a Saturday archiving old email.
 I'm fed up with having emails since 2003 in my inbox.
 It slows everything down.
 So I exported a bunch of it to PDF and archived it and filed away.
 Yeah.
 And I'm determined to only keep five years of email history current with me.
 That seems like enough.
 And I'll archive the rest as we go on.
 But I was reading all these emails about us coming here,
 you know, us dialoguing with staff with Jeff and just thinking, we don't have a clue what
 we're doing when we came here. Yeah. But it turned out brilliant. Well done, God.
 Yeah. Hey, I found something even older than that. Go on. When I was cleaning out the garage,
 I had printed out all of our emails that we sent back and forth before we started dating.
 And then all of the emails that we sent back and forth when you were in, you know, Moscow and I was
 in, you know, Mexico, all those kinds of. So here's the difference between me and you. Yeah.
 i came across the same last night and just delete them you did not
 i want to i don't need them but you printed them out that's just a total difference between me and you they're in a book but i don't know if i have all of them i'm not happy to leave it out
 i'm sorry it's the way i'm wired love i'm always looking forward i'm i'm present future not present past okay i'm sorry
 Well, in the future, anything that might be a precious momento, maybe don't delete that until you talk to me.
 I'm looking forward to the future precious momento.
 Oh, whatever.
 Psalm 23 says this, "Surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life,
 and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
 That's the last verse of Psalm 23.
 I love that it says, "Surely, surely your goodness," like, duh.
 Like it's such a given that God's goodness and God's love are going to be with me.
 And the end result is dwelling in God's house forever.
 I love that.
 I love that sense of optimism that whatever happens tomorrow, goodness, love, God's mercy
 is just going to be there with you.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 It's so good, isn't it?
 Oh, it's amazing.
 Jeremiah 29, 11, everyone knows this verse.
 Yes.
 "For I know the plans I have for you," declares the Lord, "plans to prosper you, not to harm you,
 plans to give you hope in the future."
 You take that face value, that means the only thing that God has on His agenda
 for the rest of your life is prosperity, hope, and a great future.
 That means every day gets better from here.
 Yeah.
 And if you can align your expectations with that, then you're
 live full in line with your expectations.
 Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 And also even if your circumstances don't point to that today, you
 can make them bow to that truth because you have a promise from God.
 Absolutely.
 And again, looking back, none of my circumstances 20 years ago pointed to where I am today.
 You know, not at all.
 So we really have no clue.
 When Graham Cook was here last last year, was it?
 Yeah, we got to hang out with him for a couple of days.
 And I remember we went to the factory.
 You and Teresa went shopping and me and Graham sat down.
 He just really loved the factory and he had a good coffee.
 And we just sat in chat and he was so sweet.
 He saw me taking notes.
 He's like, would it not be easier if I just recorded this conversation?
 She was kind enough to regard the conversation we were having.
 And I was listening to today.
 And I was just asking, you know, Graham, what are some of the things that
 you've found super valuable in life that you've learned?
 And he said, he said this to me.
 He said, what if in this life in Jesus, we can't be challenged by anything
 other than goodness?
 And I was like, I give up.
 I don't know.
 What?
 I don't even know how to get my head around.
 What's the answer?
 But he said, "What if in this life in Jesus,
 you can't be challenged by the enemy?
 You can't be challenged by difficult people.
 You can't be challenged by hard circumstances.
 What if you're only ever going to be challenged by goodness?"
 And so I said, well, explain it to me,
 he says, "That means in every situation of life,
 you and I are under a wonderful challenge
 from Jesus to be just like Jesus and become like him.
 And he will make all these resources available for you
 to become more and more like Jesus.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I thought, what a wonderful perspective.
 'Cause he was saying, you know,
 the fruit of the spirit, living in that,
 you're out of touch from the enemy
 because none of those things are available to him.
 So if you can practice patience,
 if you can celebrate love,
 if you can enter into joy, into gladness,
 to all these things, he said,
 "That's where you will find those things."
 And those things aren't dictated by your circumstances.
  </li><li>Right, so good.
  </li><li>When I look back on the different seasons
 our life. I realize that in nearly every area, our life has been upgraded.
 Yeah. But that's just ridiculous. But it's ordered by God.
 That's really why I love the declarations that we make at our church.
 Before we do our, if you're not being the grace in our, before we take up our ties and offerings,
 we always make declarations. One of my favorite ones is, as we come today and give our offerings,
 we declare jobs and better jobs, raises and bonuses, benefits, sales, tips and commissions,
 favorable settlements, estates and inheritances, interests and interest. Interest and income,
 rebates and returns, checks in the mail and on and on and on. And some people have got,
 over the years, have got upset with us for saying that thinking, you know, what are you doing?
 And my challenge to them is even if you don't make those declarations, you're still making
 declarations, but it's likely your declaration sound like, oh, I'll never have enough.
 I'll probably end up owing you my taxes rather than getting a rebate.
 I'll probably not get that promotion. You're declaring over yourself the very opposite of
 what God has for you, which is glory to glory, goodness, hope, a future.
 Aligning your expectations is so, so super important.
 That also reminded me when you were talking about that, babe, that the day before we got married,
 I had lunch with Patricia King. She couldn't stay for the wedding. Right. And we had lunch.
 And it was quite a funny conversation because she said, "AJ, I went to your wedding,
 and I saw the presence of God there." As you do. I went in the future, I went to your wedding.
 I was like, "Okay." And she said, "And as I prayed for you this morning, I heard the Lord say,
 "Your past has been marked by trauma, and your future will be marked by favor." And she said,
 everything changes today. And I just thought, okay, and that's so true. You know, it's been
 just favor upon favor upon favor. Like we can't keep up with how good God is.
 Oh, I love Patricia. I love that word. All of this has got me thinking, what is God
 having store for us tomorrow, for this next season? Right. Well, and you, dear listener,
 what is God having store for you? I'm aware that when I speak about this, there's people
 that come to mind where I think this hasn't been true for them. But one of the things that's
 marked their lives is they've actually tried to follow God on their terms. Like I meet people all
 the time who say they're Christians. I believe they're Christians, but their lives are so measured
 in their obedience to God. They are happy to follow God up to a point where his will conflicts
 with their will. And then inevitably when they choose their own way, destruction happens.
 destruction is too strong a word, but well, maybe it's not.
 Stuff just starts falling apart and almost without exception, these people have
 then railed against God.
 And I just think that's so funny.
 Actually, you departed from him.
 You chose not to follow him thinking that you were following him.
 And you know, we had this conversation when we said, hey, do you
 think that's a good idea?
 And we're like, oh, yeah, you know, no problem.
 But Proverbs 19 3 says this, people ruin their lives by their own foolishness
 and then are angry at the Lord.
 Not amazing.
 Yeah, it is amazing.
 But what would you say to people who are not in that situation, who are genuinely following
 God, but today as they're listening to this podcast, life isn't all roses and everything
 isn't glorious.
 What's your encouragement for them in that?
 Keep pushing into God anyway.
 It's going to change.
 Right.
 It's going to change.
 You're going to have breakthrough.
 He's not going to do for one person, what he wouldn't do for another.
 The Bible says he's no respecter of persons.
 You know, he's the same to you as he is to me.
 And you got to understand that you're living in a season as Jeff dollar loves to say the book hasn't been written. Yeah, right. You the chapter that you read hasn't even been written.
 And my encouragement is in the seasons of my life where things look bleak.
 I've discovered that the landscape that God's going to perform his next miracle.
 Yeah, for sure.
 All right, there's our meandering thoughts. You have a glorious hope and a glorious future in Christ Jesus.
 Yeah. And if you're not in Christ Jesus, today would be a great day to give your life to Jesus.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 I want to pray for everybody, babe.
 OK, I want to pray for you.
 If you don't know Jesus, then let me pray for you and you can pray along with me.
 And basically, knowing Jesus is simple as understanding that your life without him is hopeless.
 And you recognize that you've sinned, that you've done things wrong.
 And you recognize that Jesus came to save you from your sin and wants to restore you to relationship with God.
 And if that's something you want, just repeat this with me.
 Lord Jesus Christ, I invite you into my heart.
 I ask you to forgive me of my sin.
 I confess that I have gone my own way and I now want to follow you for the rest of my life.
 And I ask you to forgive me of my sin and lead me in the way everlasting.
 Now, if you've prayed that for the first time, please email us.
 Go to our website, allenaij.com/feedback.
 fill in that form, let us know. For everybody else who I'm hoping already knows Jesus,
 Adrian, I want to pray for you and just bless you with favor and bless you with hope and bless
 you with the promises of God. So Lord, we just thank you for our listeners tonight. We just ask
 that whoever's listening to this right now will be so overcome with optimism because God is on
 their side that no matter what they're facing today, no matter what they're facing tomorrow,
 Lord, your promises that your goodness and your love is following them.
 And so I just asked for a tangible increase in those two things.
 And I asked Lord for a shift in seasons for people that they would move into
 just this glorious season of upgrades where they would know your kindness
 and your goodness as your true nature.
 Yeah.
 And Papa, would you overwhelm them with hope about the future?
 Would you open doors for them with your favor and just shower favor upon them?
 God, we speak a shift to what their current circumstances are.
 into your desire for their life.
 And we speak breakthrough in Jesus name, Amen.
  </li><li>See, God is an eternal optimist.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And my encouragement is choose to be just like your dad.
 Say no to negativity and yes to excitement in God.
  </li><li>All right.
