<p> I'll in an age is podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
</p><ul>
  <li>Eighty Jones. - Mr. Jones.
  </li><li>Episode 275 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Welcome to everyone. - Thank you.
  </li><li>How are you? - I'm good.
  </li><li>You're good 'cause you've had three coffees this morning?
  </li><li>I only had two. - Oh, 'cause earlier when I asked you
 how you doing, you were like, I'm not doing good.
 I said you need another coffee.
  </li><li>Yeah, but-- - You cut yourself off at two.
  </li><li>Well, I mean, let's not go that far.
 I'll probably have another one,
 but I feel okay.
  </li><li>Give the people a weekly update.
  </li><li>Well, it was quite the week.
 We did go on vacation, but just before that,
 the day before, in the morning,
 you guys zelled out of her cage and you're like,
 "She's making weird noises."
 She did sound like she was making weird noises.
  </li><li>She sounded like a mini helicopter.
 (imitates
 (imitates
 something)
 I don't know, I thought her nose was maybe just snotty or something.
 It sounded odd.
 Yeah, it sounded odd.
 And then we were like, "Huh, well she seems okay."
 I googled it.
 And one result said, "Take her to the vet immediately."
 And the other Google result was like, "Yeah, it's probably nothing."
 Yeah, and so, but she was like, you know,
 seemed to be moving around fine and eating and whatever.
 Zelda is one of our guinea pigs, by the way, if you're new to the show.
 So, and then in the afternoon, I came out of a meeting and went to look at her and her
 body was jumping with every effort to breathe.
 Like she was literally like, "Lurdle body was going funk funk funk."
 Like each time she tried to...
 Maybe she was dancing to an invisible bass line.
 It was like actually really scary to look at.
 I was like, oh, and as to like a previous asthmatic, it looked like what I would look
 like when your skin like pulls in when you're trying to get air. And so I was like, uh,
 so I just got online. I started calling all these different vets and it turns out for
 a guinea pig you need an exotic vet. So we have an exotic pet there. But there's one
 by the church. Okay. There is right next door. I called and I said, you know, we're new
 guinea pig owners. It could be that this is nothing, but it looks like she's struggling
 to get air. The person there was like, "Well, our next appointment is in like three and
 a half hours, but bring her right now in case she's really not getting air." Like in case
 it's nothing. And I was like, "Okay."
  </li><li>In case it's not nothing.
  </li><li>In case it's not nothing.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay. I was trying to try.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we like come in and I was like, "Hi, you know, this is Zelda."
 And the lady right away was like, "Okay, hang on a second." And the vet comes over and looks
 at her for all of like about 10 seconds and says, yeah, let's take her right in.
 And so I'm like, okay, not nothing, you know.
 And so we go in and literally the length of time that it takes me to fill out a form,
 there's a tech in there.
 They all, I mean, clearly all these people love animals.
 So they're all sweet talking Zelda and, you know, trying to like ascertain how, you know,
 how important it is or how fast they have to respond.
 And so this tech looks at her, asked a couple of questions and then she's like, "Okay, well,
 another vet took a quick look at her, might be a little while.
 If anything changes, just open the door and start screaming."
 And I was like, "I wish ER for humans was like this."
 It was like, "What am I looking for to change?"
 You know, like, you mean, other than it looks like she can't breathe, like something more
 than that.
 Anyway, so, but anyway, she went out and was like two minutes later that the vet was
 back in there looking at her and she said, "Yeah."
 That shouldn't look like that.
 So she is struggling to get air
 and she said, "I'm gonna take her and take her temperature."
 And why not?
 And I was like, "Okay."
 And she said, "Do you know if she has a temperature?"
 I was like, "I know.
 "I mean, like how would I know?"
 You know?
  </li><li>Does it matter?
  </li><li>I'm sorry.
  </li><li>How do you know?
  </li><li>No, I didn't.
  </li><li>Do we need like one of those heat guns?
  </li><li>I don't, and what's the normal guinea pig temperature
 and how do you get it past their fur?
 I mean, I don't know.
 So I don't think I even want to know the answer
 those questions. So she stuck her head back in about probably no more than two or three
 minutes later and said, she does have a fever. I'd like to x-ray her and see if she has pneumonia.
 And I was like, Oh, okay.
 Does x-ray give your guinea pig superpowers? Because I'd be all about that.
 Maybe, maybe we have a super-powered guinea pig. Anyway, she came back and she's like,
 we only had to take one x-ray to see the pneumonia.
 So she does have pneumonia.
 And she's like, I gave her an antibiotic shot
 and I'm thinking that poor guinea pig,
 like antibiotic shots hurt like stink.
 (laughs)
 And I was like, okay.
 And then she's like,
 and I'm giving you these antibiotics
 to give her for the next two weeks.
  </li><li>But the slight problem was,
 we got to give this guinea pig antibiotics for two weeks.
 And the very next day we were what?
  </li><li>Going on vacation.
  </li><li>So you were so funny 'cause you went to school.
 I wrestled because I was like, we need to bring the guinea pigs with us.
 I was like, I'm pretty sure the hotel is a strict no-path policy, including exotic
 pairs.
 Yeah.
 Well, we had wonderful people that had agreed to come and feed them, but now I was going
 to add in antibiotics.
 Now she did, it was pretty easy to give her antibiotics the first two times that I did
 it.
 And so I was like, guys, it's really easy.
 Just, you know, just stick the syringe into the side of the cape.
 She'll come over and she'll just lick it off the, I mean, it was good.
 because that's what she did for me twice.
 Well, she didn't do that for anybody else.
 She didn't, but of course she didn't know any of the people that were coming to take care of her.
 Did the kitty pics have that level of attachment with people?
 Apparently they do.
 Well, it's true.
 Every time AJ comes home, every time.
 Not even to hear a voice, they just need to see her.
 They start weeking like the mothership has landed.
 Yeah.
 They want to be near you.
 It's like their happy noise.
 Yeah.
 So they make it.
 And it's so loud.
 When it's you.
 Yeah.
 When it's me.
 Yeah.
 So it's, you know, she's recovered.
 She's she is recovered, still taking antibiotics.
 How many more days does she have of antibiotics?
 Uh, like five.
 Five days.
 All right.
 Tell the good people about vacation.
 OK, well, we went to Lexington, Kentucky.
 And it was funny driving there because MJ was like,
 "Tucky, what's Kentucky known for?"
 And what did you say?
 Bourbon whiskey.
 Bourbon.
 He's like, what's that?
 Like alcohol.
 And then as we were driving, I was like, yeah, they're also known for horses and horse racing and whatever.
 And then the more closer we got into Lexington, the more horse farms we saw.
 I thought that I wouldn't know what to expect with Kentucky, but it was beautiful.
 It's beautiful.
 Rolling Green Hills ever.
 And then really expensive white wooden fences.
 Yeah, and big horse bars.
 Big horse barns and horse farms and rolling hills.
 Yeah.
 It was funny when we got in the car.
 I asked the kids, what is synonymous with vacation for you?
 Like what's the most important thing about going on vacation?
  </li><li>Yes, yeah.
  </li><li>And the answers they came up with really shocked me.
 Like they all unanimously decided that Olive Garden
 has to feature.
 For those of you who are not from America,
 Olive Garden is a fake Italian restaurant.
 It's a chain, you find them everywhere.
  </li><li>It's American Italian.
 It's, I mean I used to work for them for years,
 but it's, I honestly think their quality control
 was way better than it's not awesome.
  </li><li>Do you think the kids love it because you love it?
 Because you used to work there.
  </li><li>See, the thing is I don't love it.
  </li><li>No, no, I know you don't love it.
 Because you used to work then you got stories around it.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, 'cause every time we go,
 they ask me to tell them some of the stories about,
 'cause I was a server trainer for the Olive Garden,
 but I also got paid to a secret shop for them.
  </li><li>Would say love that story.
  </li><li>Yeah, so there's some secret shopping.
  </li><li>See, it makes sense, 'cause I remember being a little boy
 And when we would go on vacation, I would always want to stop at the little chef.
 Now, my UK audience instantly know what the little chef is.
 I don't even know if it's still in business.
 Americans, you don't know.
 It's like Jennies, isn't it?
 It's kind of like the Waffle House.
 A bit nicer than the Waffle House, but the food is like, the Waffle House probably had better food.
 I got taken once to the little chef by a church that I visited.
 Wow, is that?
 Well, I thought my family took you there.
 like, "Oh, wait, she's here.
 Let's care for a nice meal."
 And we'll go to a little chef.
 I know.
 No.
 I don't think they ever took me to the little chef.
 Well, I think as a kid, I remember we would get chicken nuggets in French fries or chicken
 fingers.
 Maybe it was called chicken fingers.
 Yeah.
 I mean, when you grew up on fish fingers, chicken fingers is a step up.
 That's a cat to me out right there.
 But my point is something about associating the little chef with we were on vacation made
 sense to me.
  </li><li>It kinda made sense to me that they wanted to go to--
  </li><li>Yeah, so the Olive Garden was one of the things that was--
  </li><li>MJ's one was, "I Want Everybody to Make a Family Playlist,"
 a road trip playlist.
 And there were some interesting songs on that.
  </li><li>They really were, yeah.
 Well, Tia's super into musicals right now,
 so if you ask her for songs for the family playlist,
 they're gonna be from Hamilton or the Phantom of the Opera.
  </li><li>MJ just wants Sweet Home Alabama,
 Sweet Caroline, Neil Diamond,
 and working nine to five dolly pardon.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>And then Abby's got all these--
  </li><li>I'm like, "We're not making a nap."
  </li><li>Like, you know, indie pop music.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And then--
  </li><li>You get a bit of whiplash with the family playlist,
 but it's entertaining.
  </li><li>We even have some ACDC there.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>They get into it.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was, oh, what was the other thing
 that they wanted?
 Snacks. - Snacks.
  </li><li>Well, that was the thing.
  </li><li>We like it-- - It's all about the snacks.
  </li><li>We like it when you peel into a gas station
 and buy us unhealthy snacks.
 I think mission was accomplished.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, wow. - On all three games.
  </li><li>Yeah, well I let you go to Walmart
 without supervision.
 That was a mistake.
  </li><li>And I had vacation budgets.
 I went to Walmart, I spent $100.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>$100.
  </li><li>On garbage.
  </li><li>On garbage. - I got your porn.
 I got caramel M&amp;Ms.
  </li><li>Yes, keep going.
 Prove my point.
  </li><li>I didn't get twizzles for you, short.
 I got Pringles, I got Ruffles, Doritos.
 All three food groups right there.
  </li><li>Puff, food orange, puffy things.
  </li><li>Yeah, but all mega family size ones.
  </li><li>And then like,
  </li><li>Giridally selection of chocolates.
  </li><li>Yes, but you got some kind of nasty pastry.
 What possessed you to buy pastry at Walmart?
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>Well, because--
  </li><li>A dark, dark thing.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't know.
 They were disgusting, I think it went by through my bananas.
 That was healthy.
 MJ had a little monkey word in it.
  </li><li>Those squeezy tubes of disgusting yogurt
 that tasted like glue.
  </li><li>The girls love those.
 But no, no, no, what's that?
 Milanas, I'm a sucker for milanos,
 Italian paste race, but I get the dark chocolate ones.
 We didn't just go licensing in Turkey for the Walmart snacks.
 We went, we in our little family devotionals,
 we'd been looking at Noah's Ark.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And-- - Story of Noah.
  </li><li>Story of Noah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Story of Noah.
 And I remember vaguely in my head that somebody in America,
 of course in America, had built a two scale version
 of Noah's Ark. - Replica, yeah.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And so I Googled it in Loebahold, it's in Kentucky,
 a mere four hours from us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so I said to the kids,
 'cause we were gonna go camping, that's right,
 but we had horrible weather coming in.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>We were just like, "Nah, I don't wanna do that."
 And so, yeah, we went to see Noah's Ark
 and the Creation Museum.
 And...
  </li><li>Yeah, and the Creation Museum's about an hour north
 or 45 minutes north, as Noah's Ark.
  </li><li>Super bomb attack, 'cause you know,
 when you look at the Noah's Ark and they're like,
 "By combo ticket," I'm like, "Great, too for the,"
 not quite for the price of one, but you know what I mean.
  </li><li>I think it was like $10 less,
 particular $5 less, particular.
 I thought they were in the same parking lot.
 No, they're another, about 50 minutes away from each other.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'd probably made the mistake of doing
 both of those events in one day,
 because as a nine-year-old boy and a four or seven-year-old man,
 there's a limit to my attention span.
  </li><li>As a 50-year-old woman,
 I was fine with doing two of them in one day,
 but definitely the two of you were like,
 the boys were struggling.
 Well, I mean, the Creation Museum,
 I think it was really, really well done.
 I had some fear going that sometimes Christian things
 are way cheesy and not done as well.
 And we're, it's like we're supposed to go,
 but yay, they tried, you know?
 But actually they did a really good job of it.
  </li><li>I love the two things.
 I mean, I think both were really good,
 but the creation museum felt finished.
 The arc itself felt finished,
 but the arc environment landscaping as an event
 didn't feel finished.
 I felt like they were right of money.
  </li><li>Well, or maybe they're still building things or whatever
 'cause they've added like a virtual tour of the arc
 and while it was being built and all that kind of stuff.
 But it looks like they still have lots of lands
 to develop around it for sure.
 But I was really impressed with the creation museum,
 the downfall and arc, the downfall is the nine year old,
 the amount of reading that is required.
  </li><li>In terms of an exhibition, it was, "Walk here, read this.
 Walk here, read this.
 Walk here, read this."
 There wasn't really anything interactive or--
  </li><li>Yeah, and it's very evangelistic.
 Like I loved how they did everything and it's--
  </li><li>It gave great, I mean, my nine year old was like,
 "Daddy, what's a different worldview
 from a creationist worldview?"
 You know, and so I was like, "Oh, that's a secular worldview."
 And then he had a very clear idea in his head,
 the difference between the two things.
 And yeah, it was great.
 It was just, I think it was nice to get out of town.
 We went away for three days, two nights.
 They were most excited by the fact
 that the hotel had a swimming pool.
  </li><li>And by swimming pool, well, no, you know,
 this is a sign say swimming pool and Whirlpool.
 There was no Whirlpool.
 It's just a square swimming pool
 and a very, very small one at that.
 but they didn't care.
  </li><li>They didn't care.
 They wanted to just jump in, get wet and splash.
  </li><li>All right, our weekly update.
 We hope you had an amazing week.
 This week, we're going to talk about.
  </li><li>Oh.
 Do we have to talk about something?
  </li><li>Well, here's the thing,
 like, you know, conviction is a great thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like, nobody likes to be convicted.
 At this basic, this week's topic
 is coming out of my personal conviction.
  </li><li>Oh dear, I thought you mean
 you're trying to convict me of something.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no.
 I'm just sharing, hey, I watched something
 read something and felt really convicted by it. And misery loves company. So I thought I'd share
 the topic is all about how procrastination will just delay your destiny. What did you say when I
 told you what the topic was going to be this week? I said, can we do it later?
 You're like, can we talk about why procrastination is a good thing?
 That's right. Can we talk about why it's a good thing?
 So it all started. I was watching an interview with Stephen Colbert. Again, if you're not from
 America, Stephen Colbert is a late night talk show host.
 Very clever, witty, very, very clever.
 Intelligent.
 It has a relationship with Jesus as a Catholic, very intelligent, very articulate, but also
 feels genuine.
 Like a lot of the night show hosts, late night talk show hosts feel like a parody of themselves
 or a character or a super self.
 He feels quite genuine and curious to have had two dreams about him where we've had dinner
 me and him and his wife and we've hit it off and we love to have him.
 So I've got a soft spot for Stephen Colbert.
 So I was watching an interview with him and one of the questions was I think,
 you know, what's one thing you'd like to change about yourself?
 And he said this, I wrote it down because it was such a great quote and I instantly resonated with it.
 He said this, he said, "I wish I had more discipline. I work hard, but that's not the same thing as discipline.
 I tend to work hard to throw myself for the times I've been undisciplined to make up
 for it.
 I'm a great making up for it, but that fools me into thinking, "Oh, that's a fine way
 to live."
 Right.
 I was like, "That has been a character trait that I can really identify in high school.
 I would just leave it to the last minute and then cram and also in university."
 I think I was kind of the person who was like, ah, like I'll happily, I will get my work
 done.
 Like I will not not get my work done.
 I will, I will get my work done, but it will cost me or potentially cost you or potentially
 cost the kids because I'll be like, I could do this and that and further away.
 And then last minute, happily sacrifice sleep or whatever, just to push through and get
 it done.
 And I could feel the tension in what he was saying about like, yeah, I do work hard, but
 I wish I was more disciplined. Maybe I'd have to work less hard if I was more disciplined.
 So that was strike one. Oh dear. Where I was like, so there's another strike coming?
 Couple days ago. Yeah. Read this article. The article is called The Subtle Way to Waste Your Life
 Confessions of a Sophisticated Sloth. Oh no! Okay. And the article, I'll post a link to it.
 sophisticated slot. I'll put a link to the show notes. But basically, the sophisticated
 sloth is the person who's worked really hard to convince themselves that they're not the
 slugger that the book of Proverbs talks about. So it's how do you move away from the teaching
 and Proverbs about the slugger and go, "Well, yeah, that doesn't apply to me because."
 the author of this article, which I'm just going to share here, shares four points.
 Okay. I don't know if I want to be on this podcast. I understand.
 Okay, I'll just listen. Conviction is harsh. I'll just listening. And on the inside, go,
 "I don't think eviction is harsh. Conviction is sharp. It's supposed to pierce us."
 Yeah. Yeah.
 I was fully convicted. Okay. Audience, see what comes up for you as I share this. All right. Number
 one, the sophisticated sloth is slow to begin.
 All right. So Proverbs talks about the slugger, who doesn't want to go out to
 work, I forget which verses, maybe I wrote down, where they're just like, Oh, you
 know, there's a line outside, I can't go to work. So the sophisticated sloth is
 basically like, well, I'm not that person. I mean, I actually start my work
 eventually. So they're excusing themselves from being a slugger by saying,
 Well, I actually, you know, get stuff done.
 And I think part of the reason I resonated with Stephen Colbert's, you know,
 interview is like, I do work hard.
 Like I work really hard, but I was thinking how much of my hard work is there
 because I'm actually slow in starting my work.
 OK, I mean, I think I'm trying to assess it, assess it.
 I think probably it shows up more for me at home than it does with work stuff.
 the slow slow to start put it off.
 And I use how hard I work for my job to justify.
 Well, I am really tired and it was a really long week and I already worked X amount
 of hours and I don't feel like getting up and doing the laundry and making sure
 my children have clean under it or my husband.
 And there is a truth and there is a truth to that as well.
 Like it was kind of work life balance.
 There is.
 But I definitely know that I'm doing the justification of like, because I signed up for this too.
 You know, I mean, like in having three children.
 Oh, yeah, it's going to be fun.
 Absolutely. Lots of long pauses and slow.
 Oh, dear.
 OK.
 Second point they made was that the sophisticated sloth is quick to take a break.
 So they're slow to start.
 Once they started, they're like, yeah, I probably need a break.
 You know, I don't I don't want to overdo.
 I don't want to perform so into that.
 I'm not an orphan, I'm a son.
 And so, and again, Proverbs, Proverbs 19, verse 24,
 says, "The sluggerd buries his hand in the dish
 "and will not even bring it back to his mouth."
 So the sophisticated sloth is like,
 "Well, that's not me 'cause, you know, clearly--
  </li><li>I brought back to my mouth.
  </li><li>I brought back to my mouth.
 But now I need a break.
 It's good for digestion.
 I was like, "Oh, dang."
 Like, you know, I'm working,
 and because I'm working, I deserve a break.
 And but the problem with a break is it can really quickly turn into a Wikipedia whirlpool.
 You know, when you look up something and we can get four work and you're like, Oh,
 click this thing and click this thing and click this thing.
 Or I think I'll find this video clip for, you know, to illustrate upon my sermon.
 And before you know it, you're lost on a YouTube tunnel.
 You know, you've just, you know, fallen into something.
 Yeah.
 And then you're just like, well, you know, you know, I've been working hard.
 Yeah.
 That kind of showed up for you.
 I would say so that one more would show up for me at work than it would at home.
 Like if I, if, well, you've seen me when I get going,
 like once I'm like, and I'm going to clean
 and get the laundry done, what I want,
 I don't want to break it all.
 I don't want to stop the momentum.
 I'm going to push through until I get this thing done.
 And I'll just keep moving for whatever seven, eight,
 nine hours, just get the thing done.
 So not at home, when I finally get going, I'll get going.
 But I would say definitely, particularly on like
 hard emotional days, I'll definitely be like,
 I've worked really hard on a break, you know, and can get sucked into, I get sucked into
 the Instagram videos, you know, like the funny reels.
 The Instagram reels?
 Yeah, or the YouTube shorts.
 Psychologically, that's crack.
 I don't know what the YouTube shorts are, but...
 Same thing.
 Okay.
 Less than one minute things that you just, you know, you flip through and it doesn't require
 any interaction.
 You don't need to like it.
 You just flip, flip, flip, flip.
 Yeah.
 It's usually like all the little dance videos and, you know, like...
 more people falling over or making bad decisions.
  </li><li>Oh, it's a time suck for sure.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And I think initially, I thought they were dumb
 and then I tasted of the fruit.
 And it's like psychological crack
 'cause part of me is just like, what are you doing?
 Like, why are you doing this?
 Stop!
 Like, oh, but look, there's a cat pirouetting.
 (laughing)
 I will say though, I do like when you send me
 the funniest ones that you find.
 Like it's a little treat for me when I open up Instagram
 and see I've got a DM from you.
 And it's the funniest ones that you found.
 So please keep feeding me those things.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That's called enabling.
  </li><li>I've noticed for me that like when I get sucked
 into the YouTube things is when we're working from home
 and it's my lunch break.
 And so I'll like quickly eat like some kind of
 really easy wrap because I don't want to spend energy.
  </li><li>A one-handed wrap because you're a super thumbfree.
 I'm like, okay, I'm on lunch break.
 And then I deep dive into these little videos.
 For me, it helps that I have an end time
 on when I'm gonna stop watching.
  </li><li>'Cause I've got a meeting coming up
 or my lunch break finishing.
  </li><li>My lunch break, yeah.
 I still think the psychological crack.
  </li><li>Yeah, it is.
  </li><li>Number three was really similar to number two.
 Number two is quick to take a break.
 Number three is open to interruptions.
  </li><li>Open to interruptions.
  </li><li>So you're working, you're like,
 Oh no, somebody stopped by my office with a question.
 Yay, like it's a distraction from having to work.
 Proverbs 24 verse 33 to 34 says this,
 "A little sleep, a little slumber,
 "a little folding of the hands to rest,
 "and poverty will come upon you like a robber
 "and want like an armed man."
 The author of this article says this, I'm quoting here.
 "The thief of time today is a tiny man.
 "He specializes in little, just a little sleep.
 A little slumber.
 Just a little surfing the internet.
 A little text message conversation.
 A little checking of Facebook or ESPN.
 I, as the sophisticated sloth, have started and stopped, started and stopped, as a teenager
 learning to drive a stick shift for the first time.
 And while the classic slugger may not wake until he is robbed of everything, I return
 home every day just missing a few dollars here and there.
 the total sum I cannot estimate."
 And I was like, dang.
 You know, it reminded me that verse elsewhere in song songs
 where it says, "Catch for us the little foxes,
 the little foxes that we ruin the vineyard."
 Well, "Catch for us the little foxes,
 even though our vineyards are in bloom."
 And so there's a danger that,
 I'm guilty of this, that I can look around and go,
 "Oh, you know, I'm not missing deadlines.
 I'm getting my work done.
 What does it matter?"
 And when he's saying, "Yeah, I mean,
 when the sophisticated sloth is saying,
 well, clearly those verses don't apply to me
 because I'm not robbed.
 Poverty hasn't fallen upon me.
 There's the danger that he who is slack in his work
 is brought us to him who destroys.
 So maybe it's not full-on destruction,
 but you are breeding destruction, not you.
 I am breeding destruction by being slack in my work
 and thinking, oh, I'm just open to interruptions.
 And sometimes those interruptions are good,
 But sometimes they keep you from doing the real productive
 deep work that you need to do.
  </li><li>I'm surprised you would say you are open to interruption.
  </li><li>Go on, what do you mean?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, part of why I love working from home
 is nobody can walk in my office, aside from you,
 and interrupt that I'm right in the middle of something.
 So I can get way more done because I'm not getting interrupted.
 And while I love people,
 while when I work in my church office,
 I'm interrupted almost constantly.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so I feel like for me that feels,
 that doesn't feel like, yeah, yeah, I'm being interrupted.
 That feels like, oh my gosh,
 I'm never gonna get anything finished.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>Well, possibly number four will explain
 where that shows up for me.
 So I hear what you're saying.
 You're experiencing me as I lock myself away
 in power through.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's what we both do.
 And both of us, like even at home,
 like I've come in and you've been like, I can't.
 Or you'll come upstairs 'cause you're on your
 brain break and I'll be like, no, like you literally just walk in, I'm like, no.
 Will I now start opening the door with trepidation?
 Like, am I going to get kicked out?
 Because I'm like, don't, don't like I'm in a flow and I just need you to not.
 And I think that's the, you know, we've, we've taught on this before about being
 productive.
 You know, you want to kind of work in like small bite-sized chunks.
 Yeah.
 For sure.
 Yeah.
 But for creative work, for deep thinking work, I need huge, I need a minimum of an hour of
 uninterrupted time.
 Yeah.
 And so what will happen is if I get interrupted, I'll be like, well, you know,
 this block of time is ruined. Right. Right.
 And then I'll then I'll justify it was the way I have to wait until the clock
 goes back to the next hour before I can do my next block of, you know,
 and I've been like that my whole my whole life.
 Because I think, well, when the kids are down, I'll have uninterrupted time
 because, you know, you'll be reading or you'll be out with your friends and, you
 know, I can work like I was just thinking about the, like, I wonder.
 My dad, I remember my dad would always go to work, you know, eight and he'd always be back at five
 o'clock, always. And I remember his funeral, his supervisor coming to me and talking about like
 the productivity that my dad did. I forget the numbers, but he said the number of signs, the number
 of papers published by a scientist is this average per year. And your father, I forget how, it was a
 large jump. I remember like I never remember my dad ever bringing work home with him at
 all. And I'm thinking I have a probably similar work ethic to my dad, but I'll often be working
 till like seven or eight or nine at night. And I'm wondering how much of that is because
 that's when my uninterrupted time comes. Because during the day it is interrupted with text
 messages or needs or phone calls or, you know, legitimate things.
 Yeah.
 But because I need or because the way I'm wired, I want on
 interrupt the time for deep work.
 I don't know.
 All I'm saying is you're like, I see that.
 I see that.
 I see that playing out for me.
 And it shows up especially in number four.
 Are you ready for number four?
 I don't think I am.
 Can we stop now?
 OK, number four.
 Is this the last like gut punching?
 Whatever.
 OK, good.
 Number four.
 The sophisticated sloth puts off harder work.
  </li><li>Woding from the author, this is one of the cleverest tricks of the sophisticated sloth.
 He works to avoid doing harder work.
 I remember when I was in university doing my finals, my apartment, my flat, never looked
 tidier than when I had finals.
 Because you'd sit down and you're like, "Oh my gosh, I need to dust.
 Forget dust.
 I need to sand down and repaint the baseboards."
 Suddenly anything that is more important, which of course is not more important.
 Well, you make it more important.
 You make it more important.
 It's more press.
 You don't want to do the hard thing.
 Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 And I, like I know it's April 15th is coming up.
 Yeah.
 Tax day for the United States.
 Yeah.
 So I know I have to file my taxes by April 15th.
 And you're the one that does it for us.
 And I'm surrounded by people who I love and want to be like, but also want to strangle when,
 by January 12th, they're like, "Yeah, file my taxes."
 And they're like, "Ah."
 And every year I'm like,
 "I'm gonna be one of those people."
 But I can, like, I've been meaning to,
 and here's the ironic thing,
 if we have an accountant who files our taxes for us.
 But they still need all the paperwork
 and the records and the receipts and stuff.
 But every year I'm thinking, come January,
 I'm gonna email my accountant,
 and I'm gonna ask for a, you know, like a February appointment.
 I had that thought in January and in February
 and swatted away, and it's now March,
 and I'm thinking, "Oh, I really need to."
 I'm gonna run out of appointments.
 So I texted him and my text was like,
 "Hey, I'm probably too late.
 "I'm happy to defer if you need to.
 "I'm going in going, oh, I could defer filing."
 And that would push off.
 And he's like, "No, I've got an opening."
 I figured what it was April 12th.
 So now I've done the hard work.
 Sometimes the hard work,
 my mother used to say to me,
 "The hard work of hard work is getting started."
  </li><li>It is 'cause once you get it done,
 you're like, "Oh, I'm so glad that's done."
  </li><li>Or once you even get started,
 Like you see you get into a flow and get into rhythm,
 and you're just gonna power down.
 The amount of obstacles for me to get stuff done.
 Sometimes to be, I'm not trying to paint a picture
 that we're just kind of slothful
 and sitting around in our underwearing M&amp;M's by the handful.
  </li><li>No. - That's why I did on vacation.
 To be clear.
  </li><li>Well, you were fully dressed.
  </li><li>We are hard working.
 Not all the time.
 We are hard working, and there is a lot on our plate.
 And I still identify that I will be tempted
 to do less important things than the urge
 or do, what's that phrase about like,
 don't prioritize the urgent over the important?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Sometimes I leave the important until it becomes urgent.
 And then I'm like, whoo, I'll power through
 back to Stephen Colbert's thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How does it show up for you or does it show up for you?
  </li><li>I would say the same.
 I would say so that for me, both at work and at home.
 Like if something feels like it's a really,
 gonna be a really hard thing to do,
 or just a really big thing,
 therefore requiring a lot of work.
 Like, oh, I need a whole new week of teaching
 on X subject, I will have that floating in the back of my head for weeks and do everything
 else. And there's always lots of other stuff to do. So I can justify that out the wazoo.
 So until it becomes now this is urgent. And then I'll finally start working on it. Once
 I actually am working on it, then I'm like, Oh, this, it is hard in that it's a lot of
 work, but actually it feels good to be doing it. But getting
 started sometimes is like, the motivation is just like, oh,
 it seems like I'm gonna climb a mountain. But but also like at
 home, like I haven't worked out in weeks and weeks and weeks,
 like, and weeks. We went to our chiropractor on Thursday and
 you're like, he's gonna ask me, Hey, every Thursday. And I'm
 gonna go, no, so did you just distract him with stories about
 his newborn baby.
 So I didn't ask you.
  </li><li>Yeah, he didn't ask him this time.
  </li><li>He didn't ask him this time.
  </li><li>But it was like,
  </li><li>He was going to say she's going.
  </li><li>That's right.
 You're gonna help me procrastinate.
 Yeah, he asked me every Wednesday,
 it's like, "Hey, dude, walking again yet."
 And I'm like, I mean, he can tell
 because my body will distress,
 my body will feel different.
 I don't adjust well when I'm not exercising.
 And, you know, I tend to be,
 I will procrastinate, procrastinate,
 then get in a rhythm.
 And then I'm like, "Oh."
 And so then I'll start trying to walk or work out every day.
 And then something will happen.
 I'll tweak my back a little bit.
 Uh, I don't know.
 My ankle hurts, whatever.
 I'm like, Oh, I think I don't think I'll do it today.
 That's all it takes.
 And that's your deal breaker.
 That's right.
 By tomorrow.
 I'm like, well, I, I so resonate with that, that work thing.
 Yeah.
 And I'm wondering if procrastination, I'm not saying this is good, but
 I'm wondering if procrastination has become our fuel for motivation.
 Here's a deadline.
 I've got plenty of time to do it.
 Nah.
 And then leave it, leave it, leave it.
 And now, oh, it was a short amount of time.
 And then that is the energy that gets us to do it.
 That's how I did all of university.
 How can we change our motivation?
 I don't know.
 A source of motivation.
 I think I probably have some sort of ungodly belief
 about that pressure produces better results or something.
 Because I remember all the way through university
 and even through high school, I
 We put it off until like the last minute and then cram.
 But I always got the grades.
 So I was like, oh, pressure is constant.
 The water pressure, you know, like I, I remember thinking that like, I'll wait
 because I know I perform well under pressure.
 Yeah.
 Back to back to Stephen Colbert.
 I'm a great making up for it.
 But that fools me into thinking that's a fine way to live.
 Right.
 Cause you're not it can't be good for your adrenals or anything else.
 Like the way.
 But like you say, it isn't interrupting your life.
 If you're still getting good grades, you're still getting work done.
 It doesn't look like I'm paying for it.
 I'm sure I am though.
 Well, I wonder how much of it is.
 I can think of like, no, I am not throwing you under the bus.
 I'm aware I'm about to use you as an example.
 Okay.
 Point. I just thought.
 I'm afraid.
 Go ahead.
 But I am remembering you spot it.
 You got it.
 So I know this is true.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But I forget what it was a few weeks ago.
 You had.
 I don't know.
 You had an event that was extraneous to your work.
 Or maybe it was, you know, it was a work, it was one of those like, it wasn't happening during the work week.
 It was either like a Friday night or it was a, I forget what it was.
 And I was looking forward to being with you on a Friday night and just being within your like, babe, I can't because I have to do this.
 Yeah.
 And so you spent your Friday night doing all this prep work.
 And I remember being jilted.
 I remember being like, but you could have got that done during the week.
 Right.
 You didn't manage your time and now I'm paying now.
 I know I am the same person.
 Case in point.
 Today is a Saturday.
 You're going to be working on the podcast all day all day.
 And so I'm saying no to some family things.
 Like it worked perfectly for me, but what does it cost the kids?
 Right.
 Yep.
 Sometimes I wonder if I record episodes for me to listen back to so I can hear my own
 conviction.
 It's terrifying, isn't it?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it really is.
 Listeners, do you have any thoughts about procrastination?
 Be so curious if this, if you've beaten this?
 Yeah, you have like tools or thoughts.
 Show your testimony, please.
 Let us know how you've beaten that because when I watched
 the interview and when I read that article, boy, did those two
 things resonate with me.
 Yeah.
 Especially I can fool myself into thinking it's a fine way to live.
 Yeah.
 Because I can see fruit.
 Yeah.
 But I'm wondering if I'm ignoring the cost.
 Yeah.
 I think it's funny too, because really we're both type A
 personality.
 Like in terms of like people probably wouldn't think we procrastinate
 from the outside.
 I don't know about that for me, but we've got a close colleague we work with who is excellent
 in so many ways.
 I mean, she is just astonishing.
 And she told me she is a procrastinator.
 And I was shocked.
 Like, you strike me as the most efficient, organized person ever.
 She's like, total procrastinator.
 Wow.
 So maybe, I don't know.
 Yeah.
 I don't want to look for excuses.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But I am looking for solutions.
 I don't mean that as an excuse.
 I just was like, I wonder if it's more common than, you know, I don't know.
 and we think because you are the only one that knows
 what your internal dialogue is
 and what it takes for you to get up off the couch
 and start doing X.
 I'm the only one that knows what my internal dialogue is
 and what it takes, and that I'm waiting for pressure.
 Or I mean, I was thinking about stuff like our house,
 sometimes when you come in, it looks like nobody cares.
 And other times, again, I'll get in a groove
 and I'll get it all tidied.
 but often the pressure is that somebody else is coming over.
  </li><li>I was gonna say, the stimulus to tidy
 is somebody else's coming.
 Now, if you were to serve us,
 would you like a tidy house or an untidy house?
 We would say tidy house. - I want a tidy house.
  </li><li>But I can't tell if we are not as careful
 tidying our house, 'cause we're just bone tired and exhausted.
  </li><li>Well, I think that's where it's tricky
 'cause it's like, am I procrastinating?
 Yes, do I legitimately have like no energy
 and could cry, I'm so tired?
 Yes. - Yeah.
  </li><li>You know what I mean?
 like I see both. And my only option is to get up and do it. And so eventually that happens.
 Well, I remember I forget whether I forget whether it was an RTF or it was in therapy.
 I forget when I was you were telling this story. So do you know the story I'm talking about?
 No. Well, you were something came up and you were talking about either an internal viewpoint
 of yourself or an ungodly belief about how you're failing as a mother or failing as a wife.
 And so the therapist or counselor or minister, whatever, said to you, like, where is that
 coming from?
 And you were talking about a friend of ours who's got a real gift of hospitality over
 to her house.
 It's an 8,000 square foot home.
 And it's always immaculate.
 Yes.
 Do you want to finish the story now that I started?
 No, go ahead.
 Well, yeah.
 You know, the therapist was like, tell me about this lady that you were, you know,
 holding, comparing yourself.
 Does she work?
 No.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 What does her husband do?
 multi-millionaire hedge fund manager. Okay, do they have maids? Oh, yes. Yeah. Okay.
 People helping them with their kids. Yeah. Okay. So it's not really fair to compare.
 You are a full-time working mom, you know, both you and I work full-time. This person
 doesn't work at all has a staff to manage their household. Yeah. But she is who my mind would go
 to because I'm like, she makes her own bread. And she, you know,
 she does all this.
 The whole diploma 31.
 You know, exactly. And I'm like, man, how does she do it? Yeah.
 But she sources it.
 You're right. But the counselor was like, she's not trying to pull
 off all the other things that you're trying to pull out during the day.
 So she can break her own bread.
 And so that is the good counter.
 It is. And at the same time, I'm still procrastinating.
 I mean, I'm not trying to throw you.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 I am taking this for me. Yeah. Yeah.
 Yeah. No, I hear that. I'm not, I'm not feeling any. Well, I just want to
 ensure you're not hearing pressure from it.
 It is an interesting road to walk. I think particularly if so that the
 counter of like procrastination is wanting to extend yourself grace.
 And that was a hard lesson for me to learn to like have grace for myself.
 So it's like, ah, but now you can see, you know, with any lesson,
 you can swing really far to the other side and just like, you know what?
 There's grace and grace looks like procrastination.
 You know what I mean?
 So I don't know.
 There's probably or you that when you talk about swinging,
 I think about the time that my mother came over to help us
 when Abigail was born.
 Yeah.
 So, you know, like again, I've told the store in the podcast before,
 but you know, you've just had a baby.
 We decided as if, you know, we bought the West Wing as a box set.
 This is before streaming television people.
 You're nursing a friend said, Hey, buy yourself a box set of a show
 you want to watch.
 And every time you're nursing, I'll give you something to do.
 Yeah, because you look forward to, oh, I get to watch the next show while I'm getting up it.
 So my mom and dad have flown over from Scotland to help us.
 Yeah.
 It was great.
 And we've had a beautiful day, like the babies in a rhythm.
 You're nursing the baby.
 We've all just eaten food.
 We're sitting down.
 The lights are dimmed as a whole family.
 We're sitting down to watch an episode.
 Yeah.
 And as the titles for the West Wing begin, my mother jumps up and she pronounces to the room.
 I must redeem the time for the Lord.
 That's literally what she says to nobody.
 Yeah.
 I must redeem the time for the Lord and pulls out an ironing board and instead of watching the TV and my mom's been on her feet all day
 Good cleaning. Yeah, you know, it is watching the TV, but also ironing at the same time. She ironed your underwear and your jeans. Well, it's good that you say that because
 I'm bringing the reason we're talking about this AJ is I've noticed you don't iron my underwear, but my observation of my mother would be like, I can't help but wonder if
 you know, a little folding in the hands, a little slumber, you know,
 the, I must have been in the time for the Lord is, is a pendulum swing in reaction to that.
 Or maybe she was just really efficient and driven.
 I don't know.
 There's, I'm jumping in next to my mother.
 So welcome to issue central.
 I think one of the things like when we're talking about this whole thing of like procrastination
 and then grace and all that kind of stuff is also there can actually be medical,
 like physical reasons as well, why you're not able to do whatever.
 Well, I'm just thinking like we've been talking about having Danny onto the podcast.
 So we'll probably have her soon.
 And she's she's my doctor.
 She's like, you know, just a specialist, but she actually just wrote a book called living well.
 I think it's called living well.
 When I first went and saw her a couple of years ago, she was like, you're vitamin B's in the toilet.
 your vitamin D's in the toilet, your irons in the toilet.
 She's like, "Aja honestly, I have no idea
 how you're getting out of bed.
 Like I don't know how you're doing it."
 And I'm like, "Cause what's the other option?"
 You know what I mean?
 Like I have a job with three kids.
 You just get out of bed.
 You get out of bed.
  </li><li>My husband has on iron underwear for bed.
  </li><li>And she did a great job of getting me,
 you know, into a really healthy place.
 You know, like we did B injections and all that kind of stuff.
 And then I got mono, I got COVID, I got discouraged.
 and stop taking all my supplements.
 And so when I saw the last time,
 she's like, why is your D back to being this low?
 And my iron and whatever.
 So she's like, you must be exhausted all the time.
 And I'm like, I am.
 And I think it's because I work really hard.
 I have three kids.
 I'm trying to keep my house clean.
 I'm a blah, blah, blah, but also,
 I'm not taking care of myself at all.
  </li><li>You're starting from depletion.
  </li><li>And that, I think that's the biggest place
 where procrastination hits me is I don't take care
 of myself well.
 Like, and you're back to not exercising,
 just being like, oh, there's so much effort
 to make an actual healthy thing
 when I could just go grab one of the kids snacks,
 which is dumb 'cause it takes like 20 seconds.
 I'm not gonna take pills.
 So I procrastinate taking my vitamins.
  </li><li>You're really not gonna take pills.
  </li><li>And now, and I think probably, if I'm honest,
 it's probably some sort of inner healing issue
 'cause as a kid with as severe as asthma as I had,
 I took medication all the time.
 Like I remember my parents being like,
 "Man, you're like the best pill taker."
 Like I could just put a pile in and take them
 and I haven't been able to do that in a long time.
  </li><li>I mean, you struggle.
 Yeah, you choke taking like--
  </li><li>Like Jeff laughs at me.
 He's tried to teach me like multiple different ways of,
 'cause I just can't.
  </li><li>Where I'm literally take a handful,
 open wide my gullet and pour them down.
  </li><li>It's inspiring.
 So I realize like when I think about procrastination
 for the most part where it's hitting me as self-care
 and house care, like, you know, and then,
 but then realizing some of it is,
 there is, I am physically depleted, you know,
 and legitimately, you know, according to all those numbers,
 yeah, my body's really tired, but also,
 I'm procrastinating, even doing the things
 like taking the vitamins to get out of that.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because taking vitamins is hard, and it's,
 I mean, I know it's not hard, but it is for me.
 So this feels like a New Year's resolution episode.
 Cause like the more and more you're talking, the more and more.
 I'm like, we could gamify this thing.
 Gamify it.
 Yeah.
 Well, like think about how we motivate our kids to do things.
 Yeah.
 Like with money.
 We'll give you a dollar for this.
 No, but like they don't get their devices on a Saturday.
 Yeah.
 All our devices are locked.
 Yeah.
 And last Friday night, all of the rooms are tidy.
 Their bathrooms are cleaned.
 Yeah.
 Laundry is done.
 Yeah.
 So I'm going to lock your devices.
  </li><li>Something away from me if I don't take my way to go.
  </li><li>I'm thinking for me, like, I just got a new video game.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Kirby and the Forgotten World, Forgotten Land.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm just playing through the thing
 and I'm motivated to get 100% on all the levels.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That's insane.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>But there's something about me that likes to compete.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But no, I don't.
 Maybe it's competing with myself.
  </li><li>You know what?
 I remember when I, you do like to compete.
  </li><li>You think I do?
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>But I don't compete with others.
 Do you not?
 I don't know.
 I don't know.
 When you get online and you play all your different video games and you trash talk each
 other, yeah, you like to compete.
 Yeah.
 I actually have a gift for Glenn.
 Oh, I'm afraid.
 I made a video character, a video game character that looks like him and I dressed him up
 in the most ridiculous outfit.
 And I played the whole game.
 And today I've collected them into a photo album.
 I'm going to send them to him later.
 Oh, that's so sweet.
 That's so nice.
 Yeah.
 Remember when we were, remember when we did "Noom" for a while that, and I wouldn't say
 they necessarily gamify anything, but they give you all of these tips all the time.
 And one of the tips that I remember, and I keep thinking about is like, they're like,
 "Have a TV show or a podcast or something that you really like that you only get to
 listen to or watch when you're on the treadmill."
 So do something that motivates you in a positive way to do something that you don't want to
 do.
 And or, you know, like I only listen to this podcast when I go out for walk in my neighborhood
 or whatever, because that will actually kind of gamify, like kind of gives you a like,
 Oh, yeah, I'm going to go do this thing that I really don't feel like doing.
 But I get to listen to whatever.
 So anyway, I just love it.
 about that. Thinking about it, but who knows if I'll do anything with it.
 Let's talk about it.
 Yeah, put it off. We can talk about it later.
 Is that a listening question?
 No, maybe we should do it later.
 Touche. Okay. It was a question from one of our members.
 Yes. Jump to the top of the queue. This is from Laura.
 Hi, Laura.
 And she says this, "AJ Mention, the hard part, was not letting your heart get sick
 in the waiting. Do you have suggestions to help remain present
 with my longing but not become heart sick. Until recently, I've just smashed longings
 deep down until their fulfillment was imminently inevitable to stave off disappointment. However,
 it seems like God keeps asking me to dream for lovely things. He has my yes, but this
 hope to spare rollercoaster is a devastating ride. The voice I feel is it would hurt less
 to stop dreaming than to allow my heart to hope and never see its fulfillment. Better
 a ground level fall than to fly for a moment and crash to the earth."
 Wow, there's a visual for you.
 Laura, that's a brilliant question. I just, sorry, I enjoyed the wording of that because
 it's such a great visual. Do I have advice? I think, and this is going to sound pretty
 The only way I can do it is keep giving it back to God.
 Like just keep going.
 Okay, I'm afraid of disappointment.
 Feel like you're asking me to dream.
 I'm risking it.
 I'm dreaming.
 I feel all these things.
 Like just being, having real conversation
 with the Lord about it.
 And probably also with some of like somebody
 who really knows you, like some of your closest friends,
 just being like, hey, feel like God's asking me to dream.
 Feels like a lot.
 know, so that there's people walking with you in hope when it
 feels hard to hope. And you're just being real honest with the
 Lord about how, how hard it is. But I don't, there's probably my
 contemplators. I need my third coffee, I think it's
 content. Yeah. One of the things I think about longing. So
 Laura, I'm listening to your question, like, Hey, you know,
 I recognize I have longing, I'm longing for it. But I'm also
 realizing I have feelings about the longing,
 not being met, potentially not being met, how much longer?
 And so my temptation is to just stuff my longing down,
 but probably in the process,
 you're also stuffing your feelings down.
 And the danger with that is the feelings
 are literally the voice of the heart, thank you, Chip Dutt.
 So one of the feelings that comes up for me,
 like we're in this weird phase with adoption
 at the moment, so we have this adoption story.
 We thought that the hardest and longest part
 of the adoption process would be
 getting all this stuff done.
  </li><li>All the paperwork and then of course,
 we're just gonna be inundated with requests and we're not.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And when we are and we said yes, we haven't been picked
 and even now we're currently trying to apply
 to another adoption agencies and there's a hiccup
 with that, my point in, not to tell my story,
 I want to stay with yours Laura,
 is a lot of those feelings, I can,
 I'm aware of the desire to push those feelings down
 and just move to app they are, I don't care,
 whatever will be, will be case or us or whatever.
 But actually the feelings are your gift
 because your anger gives you your passion
 to rejuvenate yourself, to go back after your longing.
 That makes sense?
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So, you know, and if we don't feel our sadness
 about the genuine loss of not getting that,
 we turn to South Pity,
 and then we become the person nobody wants to be around, right?
 So we start sabotaging our own heart
 by not feeling our feelings.
 So part of the gift in that verse, you know,
 hope deferred makes the heart sick,
 but a long fulfilled is the tree of life.
 In the heart sickness, part of the danger
 of where we make our hearts sick
 is by not listening to what it's saying.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But hope deferred, actually, there's a gift in that,
 if you'll pardon that horrible expression,
 in that it's a buffet of feelings.
 And if we sit with our feelings,
 we'll get our gift while we're waiting for our longing
 to be there.
  </li><li>Anyway, I think you also tend to figure out
 what's most important to you as well.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's also a purification of the heart.
 Like I noticed that for me,
 I'm in a season where there's something I am longing for,
 I'm powerless to bring it about.
 And actually in that process, man, is it purifying my heart?
 Yeah.
 Where I'm realizing a lot of the stuff that I think is noble reasons for wanting that thing.
 Yeah.
 Or actually not as noble as I'd like them to be for.
 Right.
 Right.
 So Laura, I don't know if that helps.
 Or whether it's just more advice, you're like, yeah, great.
 Thank you.
 Hopefully it helps.
 I wish I had a button that I could press and make long and fulfilled for people.
 Yeah.
