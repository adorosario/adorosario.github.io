<p> Hello Mrs June hello more sure Jones you look like you've just come fresh from
 zumba I thank you you mean sweaty and sort of dishevels yes I have I meant
 glowing because of your diligence and the air of exercise I'm glowing something
 I was zumba it was good I still feel like I'm the only person in the class is
 no one what's going on so I look like a cricket on crack in the back trying to
 figure out. Anyway, I didn't like to trip myself or anything, so that's nice.
 No, I'm so proud of you. You didn't trip yourself.
 Thank you. Thank you. I keep looking up when my cousin Holly is looking at me saying,
 smile. You're having fun. And I'm like, no, I'm not having fun. You're having fun.
 Sorry. Talk to me about this week. Favorite thing from this week? Don't think it, tell me.
 They were thinking from this week, Aioli.
 Okay.<br/>
 I wish Aioli was a fancy new restaurant, but it literally is Aioli.
 Talk to me about your Aioli, which for the record was absolutely delicious.
 Well, I got a recipe for making your own mayonnaise that is whole 30 compliant from
 Shannon.<br/>
 And so I made that.<br/>
 And then we were making sweet potato fries.
</p><ul>
  <li>No, I'm not gonna have silence for this week,
 potato fries.
 And they are truly gone now.
  </li><li>Amazing how a baked root vegetable
 is appealing when you're on Whole 30.
  </li><li>I think I would like that no matter what,
 actually they're really good.
  </li><li>Yeah, they were delicious.
  </li><li>They're really good.
 So I put all the mayonnaise and a jar
 and had some leftover and I thought,
 oh, I'll make aioli, I have no idea how to do this,
 but I'll just fully spirit it.
 So I just put in some things as they came to my mind
 And it turned out great.
  </li><li>It was absolutely delicious.
  </li><li>I'd bathe in it.
 I mean, that wouldn't be a productive bathing, of course,
 'cause I'd then have to shower afterwards,
 but it would taste good.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Oh dear, I don't even know where to go.
 (laughs)
 Heidi Baker was at our church on Sunday.
  </li><li>She was.
  </li><li>Things were always quiet when Heidi comes.
 Nothing seems to happen.
 Just a mundane normal service when Heidi's in time.
 For those of you who maybe listened to the podcast
 for some reason don't know who Heidi and her husband Roland are as they are missionaries out in Mozambique have been for how many years did they say they were celebrating
 I can't it's been like 20 or something lots of years there and
 Gosh if you ever want some stories
 Make sure to make your question whether you're actually saved then you want to listen to Heidi and Roland
 They're just incredible people who love Jesus
 Love the lost and love the poor and have given their lives a wholeheartedly for the kingdom and so
 She's so generous and gracious. She was in time for the go conference
 The national iris that it's phenomenal job of we should talk with that they did an amazing job and laal nelson so proud of you guys are amazing
 But wrong is on hide you were in for the conference and hidey came over and spoke Sunday morning. She's just amazing
 Did you come in to miss a and?
 We love our pieces, but our technology all fell down a church. So that was never fun. No, but I mean it turned out fine. Ah,
 Brilliant. What are you gonna do?
 And then we kicked off the school supernatural life. We did first week of teaching back in the swing of things. Yep
 Students are all like super excited and you know, they were all early weren't they?
 We turn up and they're all super early. You're like, oh, that's nice. You guys are
 eager and keen and hungry, which is just absolutely awesome. Probably the most important thing.
 I mean, well, we should probably stop and say it seems like everybody we know has their birthday
 in September. So happy birthday. Everybody's had a birthday in September. My Instagram feed right
 now seems to just be birthday. Birthday after birthday invitations.
 Yeah. So that's awesome. Yeah, very happy returns or whatever the phrase is. But probably the most
 important thing. More so than a only was new iPhone to go out released. In fact, not only did
 new iPhones get released, but new iPhones were announced and the Apple Watch was announced.
 Mummy wants an Apple Watch.
 Of course, Mummy does. You're a good Mummy. What was funny about Tuesday was the keynote.
 Varying degrees of success with the "please everybody don't tell me anything that's going on because
 I want to watch it when I get home." Usually, I just give up halfway through the day because
 inevitably somebody's tweet or text me something but this year.
 I disabled all my notifications so even if people tried to.
 I couldn't I'm sure that everybody around me didn't tell me anything you cheated and look at the website.
 I had I didn't drop hints you I did not drop hints did you or did you not make a joke about the new iPhone.
 Which at the point.
 Really the new iPhone you didn't read out Chris locks.
 i was about an apple watch and if you look to the watch it was a watch from the seventies that he put up on instagram saying look at the new apple watch that's not cheating.
 I felt betrayed in my heart okay maybe you should get a so so.
 Thank you for your understanding darling compassion it overwhelms me no but anyway man she gets to Tuesday and i was so excited we came home.
 We had a bit of a rough time with our kids and schooling and we got them to about seven we sit down with fire up the apple TV like all this is going to be awesome.
 Technical delays i don't think apple posted their keynote till eight p.m.
 I know you're just about to be time i was i'm gonna watch master chef we watch it and uh.
 The funny thing about the phones is i you know not to not to look down on the genius amount of work that they've been but i can i was like oh yeah that's really awesome.
 Not really nourished upgrade because it's not like my phone is like a slow or oh my photos are very good. My photos are amazing. My videos are amazing. My phone is super fast.
 So I was like why would you bother upgrading.
 But we upgraded.
 Come to that in a minute. But then the watch thing of course we're expecting some sort of.
 the watches beautiful.
 I'm really, I think we're probably just excited because it's something new and something shiny.
 And I like new and shiny, but I also like watches.
 I wanted to watch until now I'm ready to hold out for this one.
 The funny thing with the phones, I'm not an economist by any means, but I guess this is the
 joy of living in an open market where we're currently with AT&amp;T. We both have iPhone 5s.
 And to buy these new phones costs an enormous amount of money,
 they're expensive phones and of course the carrier subsidizes them.
 But we worked out that we could switch to T-Mobile and save money, which is what we did.
 So we're switching to T-Mobile. You got the small one, which is dumb because they're both bigger,
 but you got the iPhone 6. I tried the big one. When I say I tried, I downloaded a PDF,
 scale, design, cut it out, stuck it to some cardboard and carry around with me for a couple
 I cut it out.
 You're very gracious.
 Whatever.
 I thought, I'm going to try the big one.
 I don't like it.
 We can swap it in.
 Can you?
 I'm sure we can.
 I'm sure it was like a 14 day exchange.
 If not, I guess I'm stuck with a humongous phone, which case I'll get used to either
 way.
 But we realized, yes, we can switch our carrier.
 T-Mobile will buy out our contract from AT&amp;T and take our phones off our hands for money.
 when all the dust settles, we actually pay a couple of dollars less a month for brand
 new iPhones.
 Come on, perfect.
 So even though they want a major jump up for us, of course they are a major jump up.
 We just thought we will not be able to take advantage of this next year.
 Our phone can be worth less money.
 And why are we going with T-Mobile?
 Well, that's a very good question because AT&amp;T of course has incredible coverage all
 across the United States.
 But for the most part, we don't travel across the United States.
 We stay at home, right?
 Or we travel internationally or we travel internationally.
 And so T-Mobile, which I'm finding is hard to believe, give you free data and free text
 messages in 120 countries.
 Come on.
 There it is.
 And we have a bunch of prophetic words about beginning to travel again.
 So we thought, well, that's really convenient.
 And let's face it, even in our current travel schedule, we go to Canada once or twice a
 year.
 And we end up paying through the nose for a roaming and for texting.
 Whereas this way it's going to save us somebody on that one too.
 Very cool.
 So I have no idea.
 I stayed up till 2am this morning trying to be there for midnight Pacific time and Apple
 servers were down or they were having some sort of problems and T-Mobile wasn't up.
 So I was a waste of time because I ended up just ordering them and I woke up this morning.
 So I have no idea if we made the cut off together for next week, but you can rest assured we
 we will talk about them when they arrive.
 All right.
 You ready for a listener's question, baby?
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>All right.
 Breena asks this,
 lately I've been desiring spiritual parents,
 so much so that I ask God for some this year
 for my birthday.
 Is your birth in September?
 I bet it is.
 So how do you acquire spiritual parents?
 I've been told that your mentor will find you,
 but I've also been told the opposite.
 Are there some seasons the Lord intends for us
 to just walk alone?
 Well, Brina, I don't think the Lord ever really wants us to walk alone.
 I think I've had seasons where I haven't had an active mentor per se,
 but in my experience, I guess the Lord has always brought spiritual parents
 or mentors alongside who also felt the same way about me.
 And so they sort of their their heart was moved towards me to take me on at the same time that I was like, oh Lord, I'd love them to be those people.
 What about you, baby?
 We've had a, you know, a couple of different ways.
 I think because we've been mentored and we mentor.
 I think I think my hurdle was I obviously really wanted John and Carol to mentor me, but was opposed to the idea of saying hello, would you like to mentor me, but mostly for fear of being rejected.
 And I'd heard that they'd called people out and said, "Hey, we're going to mentor you."
 And so it was all fear on my part.
 But I had a couple of words from the Lord about like, "Hey, they're going to be your spiritual
 parents. And if you'll go and ask them, it will be so."
 So for me, I took the really unusual characteristic steps of going up and asking them,
 and what do you know it worked? Hey, how about that, the Lord?
 But then we've also had people, random people, walk up to us and just say, "Hey,
 would you, you know, God told me to be that you're going to be my spiritual parents.
 And that's always awkward because it's like, Oh, that's awesome.
 I'm so sorry.
 He hasn't told us that.
 And I'm not sure how that would work because you don't live in the same city as I live in.
 And then at the same time, I think for most of the time, we've just seen people
 that we've wanted to quote unquote adopt.
 Yes.
 You know, you connect with people that jump into your heart and you try and make room for them.
 And I think I probably were probably the same in this that we look for a favor.
 So you extend for us, we extend an invitation and we see if it's reciprocated.
 Is there a favor on that?
 People do want it.
 And is it easy?
 And if it's, uh, if those things kind of line up them, we're going for it.
 You're okay.
 You're hanging up to down your chair.
 Not exactly.
 Did you see a spider?
 No.
 Oh my gosh.
 There's a spider right there.
 I'm not even joking.
 Don't lie.
 I can tell when you're joking.
 I can tell when you lie.
 So bring in and answer your question.
 I don't know. The Lord ever intends us first to just walk alone. But what I do know is he's an
 incredible father and he would love to father you spectacularly. And then also I think the whole
 love, sewing and reaping kicks in, the whole thing of if you want to mentor them, start mentoring.
 So, you know, maybe start sewing in that area and seeing where that leads you. But then also look
 around and who lights up? Who's somebody that your life, their life you want to emulate?
 And then just start asking God for open doors in favor.
 Love this week, I wanted to teach.
 I didn't want to teach this week.
 I have been teaching hearing the voice of God, our very first week on the school
 supernatural life is all about hearing the voice of God.
 And I thought that would be a fun thing to talk about for this podcast is hearing the voice of God.
 Okay.
 I tweeted out something earlier this week that I wish it was mine.
 I'm not sure if it is mine.
 I can't remember where I got it.
 but basically the premise is if Jesus as the Son of God needed to know how to hear God voice,
 what makes us think we'll be fine without it? And I think like that because I, the culture in
 which I was raised, spiritual climate and spiritual culture, was that God didn't speak anymore. I
 mean, of course he spoke through this written word, but the notion that God would speak to you
 audibly or that God would speak to you personally or that God would speak in dreams and visions
 was absurd or that he would send angels to communicate to you, just didn't happen anymore.
 And that always puzzled me, especially when I'd read Old Testament encounters.
 You'd read about David going and sitting down before the Lord and just
 dialoguing with the Lord and the Lord would speak back to him. And I remember even as a young boy
 thinking, "How does he get to do that under an inferior covenant?" But us in a new covenant,
 a better and every way covenant, we don't have that access.
 And so I remember just from being about eight years old, all was wanting to hear the voice
 of God.
 And so it's always been a passion of mine.
 What about you?
 Like when do you think you remember a time when you started hearing the voice of God?
 Well, it definitely wasn't when I was eight.
 I was still a heathen when I was eight.
 I mean, just, you know, stealing mept and cookies.
 It was bad.
 It was really bad.
 You know what?
 We're paying walking the light right now.
 I don't remember asking to hear the Lord.
 I remember realizing that I was.
 Okay.
 If that makes sense.
 And that was probably more like it was after I realized that I heard from him through dreams
 and that kind of stuff.
 And then when the renewal started, I realized, "Oh, I'm hearing things about other people.
 Right.
 I don't know what to do with this."
 I remember having to go to Mark Tippant and say, "I don't know what to do with, I hear
 stuff."
 And he was sort of, and then for a while, there was myself and a girl named Melody that
 ever once in a while, we would prophesy over somebody or whatever.
 And then people would start to bug us at church, like, "Proface over me," and Mark said, "Just
 tell them to read their word, you know, because we were like, I don't know, tell people, you know.
 So let me answer your question on that.
 Yeah.
 Because although this is all under the same umbrella of hearing the voice of God, I hear
 differently for other people than I hear for myself.
 Like when I'm having a quiet time with the Lord, when I just go away to just be with the Lord and ask
 him to speak to me, the way I hear him and how I hear him is completely different from when I stand up, for
 example in front of a group of people and prophesy over some people or when I'm asked
 to minister prophetically, I hear God differently.
 Do you, is that the same for you?
 I mean, there's some crossover to be sure.
 Yeah, when I stand up and prophesy over people, I would say I'm going back and forth between
 seeing and hearing, seeing and hearing, like visual and then hearing information, visual
 and then hearing information.
 And when you say hearing, what do you, what do you mean hearing?
 Because this is a big means no more.
 Inside my head.
 Inside your head.
 You're hearing an audible stream.
 Yes, I've sentences sometimes or like facts.
  </li><li>Okay, so when I'm alone with the Lord and I'm in prayer
 or I'm reading the Bible and I'm journaling as in,
 I've got my laptop in front of me
 and I'm writing out my prayers to the Lord.
 And you know, Lord, this is what my day was like.
 I'm just gonna love some insight.
 When I stop, I hear an audible stream
 and I just write down everything in here.
 That is pretty much the only time I ever hear
 an audible stream.
 If I'm standing up in front of people
 or I'm ministering prophetically in the prophetic ministry
 or at church or whatever,
 for me, the vast majority of us seeing.
 And I may hear snippets of senses,
 but I never get that audible stream.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Isn't that interesting?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then the content is different.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Yeah, I would say probably, I don't know,
 50 to 75% of when I'm promising over people
 in a meeting or something is me hearing.
 But I started off just seeing.
  </li><li>Right.
 And so now sometimes I get pictures in
 and then I just ask the Lord, like,
 okay, what does that mean?
 And then I'll hear the answer to that.
 So, but I recognize that's different than hearing,
 like hearing the Lord for yourself.
 I would say I actually got that skill later
 than I did learning to hear the prophetic stuff
 I need to hear.
  </li><li>Because you're quite surprised,
 I mean, one of the funny things that we talk about a lot
 is we'll be driving somewhere
 and you will deviate from where we're driving.
 And I'll just look and go,
 "Well, where are you going?"
 You're like, "Holy Spirit just told me to do X, Y, Z."
 And nine times out of 10, there was an accident,
 there was something, and you totally avoided that.
 When the Holy Spirit just,
 presumably at that point you're driving the car,
 you're not thinking necessarily about--
  </li><li>I'm not thinking anything. - Communing with God.
 He interjects across your consciousness.
 How does that sound?
  </li><li>It just sounds, well, it sounds like my own voice,
 but it just sounds like turn left right now.
 Or, you know, I'll be driving along
 and I'll just be, you know, thinking whatever
 and it'll be take 27 instead of 427 or whatever.
 Like it used to happen a lot in Toronto
 and it always saved me so much time
 'cause I would miss all these major things.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>How did you, well, I don't wanna say
 how did you learn to hear the voice of God
 because that's a lifelong journey, but who are some
 of the people that taught you what are some of your influences
 and the way you learn to hear God's voice.
  </li><li>Well, to begin with, I would say probably
 watching people like Mark DuPont
 and people that could hear clearly made me realize
 that this is real.
 So that probably helped me because then I could go,
 "Oh."
 And then I remember at one point,
 they, in the church in Toronto,
 shortly after the new old started,
 They started doing prophetic training,
 and Steve, what used to come up from Cleveland,
 Bethel Cleveland at the time,
 I think it was called Metro Church or something.
 And he started doing training,
 and so it was doing those classes where I felt,
 oh, so awkward, and the games were all scary,
 and all that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>That I realized, oh wow, I really can do this.
 I really do hear that.
  </li><li>Is that what you're gonna join the dots
 where you're like, oh, this is that.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 Right. So it was giving a framework to what you could already do for a lot of it.
 Or did you learn new skills too?
 I learned to be able to do it faster.
 Right.
 Because everything was a timed thing.
 Okay. Now you have this person in front of you for 15 seconds, prophesied.
 Now you have the next person for 15 seconds, prophesied.
 So I learned that.
 I already knew that I heard and I then learned I could hear at will.
 I could say, "Okay, Lord."
 And ask for something about people.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>No, it totally makes sense.
 For me, I remember asking the Lord,
 I remember being really distraught
 because I was reading books about people
 who could hear the voice of God,
 but I was so frightened of being deceived,
 partially because of my upbringing.
 I wasn't even sure, does God even speak today?
 And I remember just, that was my prayer,
 like, "Lord, are you even speaking today?
 like, is this still available for today? And my reading one day was in Job 33, verse 14. And this is what it says, "For God does speak, now one way, now another, though man may not perceive it."
 And I remember reading that thinking, "You do speak, it's in the Bible. Oh my gosh, how did I miss this?" And you know, my second question was, "Well, God, if you're speaking, how come I can't hear you?" And that was the revelation.
 you are speaking now one way, now another,
 though man may not perceive it.
 And I think at that point I had the revelation
 and I didn't have the answer,
 but I thought, God, what if you speak
 in a way that's different from the way I hear?
 And that really started peeking my interest.
 And then, numbers 12 or six talks about how God just loves
 to speak to his prophets through dreams and visions.
 And then I realized, oh my gosh,
 I'm anemic in my understanding of dreams and visions.
 And that was probably what directed me to people like John Paul Jackson.
 And then of course, I found Mark Verkler when I was wandering around.
 My real comfort though, so I started all theoretical.
 I think I sailed in my heart that in the Bible, it says this is possible.
 Then went looking for how you make a possible happen, which is probably the way I'm wired.
 But I remember Jesus would often say, I do nothing by myself.
 I only do what I see what my father is doing, which I read for years.
 But if you stop and think that, well, what does that verse mean?
 Jesus was on earth.
 The father was in heaven.
 How did Jesus see what the father was doing?
 And I was like, I don't know, but that's amazing.
 Or when Jesus says, you know, I don't say anything of my own accord.
 I only say what I heard my father tell me in John 12.
 And again, there's this sense that Jesus lived out with a constant
 revelation of its father. And so if Jesus is the model for us in life, I remember thinking
 there's a gap. The way Jesus does life and the way I do life are different. And I just
 started praying. And it was me that it was me. I stumbled one day upon Mark Verclur's
 teaching, which of course we know and we love and we've taught all over the world. But if
 you're listening and you are like, I would love to learn how to hear the voice of God.
 If you just Google Mark Verkler hearing God's voice, he's got some great resources.
 Many of them free on his website on about how to hear the voice of God.
 And that's for me was one of the initial frameworks for hearing the voice of God.
 And that's primarily how I hear the voice of God.
 For me, the rest of it was all through perfect training.
 Yeah.
 No, and I would say that's probably, I mean, I hear for myself mostly through journaling.
 So God still does the weird interrupt me while I'm driving kind of stuff.
 Right.
 Which we're all very grateful for.
 Right.
 I think it's great to do a course like Mark's course or hearing God's voice course because
 the boundaries of what you're doing and how you're doing it and how do you test a word
 and how do you know if it's God or if it's you and all that kind of stuff.
 That there's safety in that.
 because I think quite often I've talked to people that are like,
 "Well, God told me to do this and God told me to do that."
 And sometimes it's not scriptural things or it's things that are like,
 "Did you get any counselor wisdom?"
 "Well, no, God told me to do it."
 Well, so sometimes for some people,
 they've heard enough people say, "God told me this,"
 and it hasn't turned out well that they think,
 "Oh, God's not actually speaking."
 Do you know what I mean?
 Totally agree.
 It kind of gives the whole thing a bad name
 Where actually God absolutely is speaking and sometimes it's just that we're listening through an idol or through a filter or whatever and so that's why training is a great idea because it helps you.
 Really know what you're doing and that's also why communities so important as well yeah because you know the greatest profits I know still have difficulty hearing for themselves yeah.
 Daniel could interpret the dreams of others but he couldn't interpret his own dreams.
 And so that's why we need other people. So I think you're right. The whole art of hearing God
 is in many ways. From the outside, at least it looks entirely subjective. And that worried me,
 I was like, God, this seems so flaky. It's so open to misinterpretation. But the more and more I
 studied scripture and the more and more I studied wisdom, I realized, oh, holy spirit, you're so
 clever. You've put an amazing safeguards for your people to hear the voice of God.
 And Jesus, one of my favorite verses, my sheep know me, they know my voice and they follow me.
 There's got to be an element that the people who are hearing God's voice are also following God's voice.
 And yeah, I think more at workers got some of the most amazing material on hearing God's voice,
 especially in terms of how to walk out with wisdom. Let me answer your question. What do you
 do with what you hear. You hear something. What do you do with it?
 Are we talking during journaling? Yeah, you're just with the Lord and maybe you feel like the
 Lord says something to you. What's your first reaction? Well, if it's for me, I just, I probably
 meditate on it quite a bit and I ask the Lord about it. Sometimes you get timing on stuff and
 sometimes you don't, but just sort of, I just try and agree with God really. Like, okay, Lord,
 if that's your plan and whatever than I agree, I don't try and make it happen.
 I just agree with God and see what God does with it.
 If it's huge things, then obviously I'd be talking to you about it.
 Jeff and Becky are John and Carol or whoever, some people that are in authority of my life
 and say, "Hey, this is what I feel like I'm getting.
 Can you talk to me about that?"
 If they're getting flags, then I'll be like, "Okay."
 I probably process it on my own first then with you, then external.
  </li><li>Oh, in the multitude of counselors, there's safety.
 The whole thing of, you know, you form out before you do anything with it.
  </li><li>What about you?
  </li><li>Same thing, you know, I let it percolate in my heart.
 And I think with practice, I'm not saying with practice,
 you don't need to discern it.
 Like weighing prophetic words as one of the greatest responsibilities
 in New Testament church, but for sure, you know,
 When you begin walking with the Lord consistently and listening for advice, you build up a rapport,
 you build up a sense of who he is and what he's like.
 And of course, all the revelation you're receiving gets weighed against Scripture.
 That's your benchmark for not going awry.
 But most of our big decisions that we're praying about, we're asking the Lord for, we're not
 just relying on what we hear from God.
 We're relying on input from friends and from family and wise counsel.
 asking for confirmation and for revelation. I would say that hearing the voice of God
 coupled with the revelation of the Father Heart are the two things that have probably changed my
 life the most. I would say somebody who was incredibly skeptical that you could hear God's voice,
 but at the same time my skepticism was matched with hunger to hear God's voice, if it was real.
 It thrills me to think I'm now at the place where I hear God's voice as often as I choose to listen.
 and I know that, you know, in James, it says, "Draw near to God and He will
 draw near to you." And I know that if I will just set aside time and go and be
 with God and speak to Him, He will speak to me, absolutely. And the promise and
 the ability for that is not any gifting that I have. It's just a promise.
 Because you're a child of God.
 Because you're a child of God. And I think it's sad that there are so many
 Christians out there that don't even know that's available and don't know that's a reality,
 which is why we love Marx teaching and it's the teaching we did this week at the
 school. And I just love that there's now a whole bunch more students who have been
 trained how to hear God's voice. And they're amazing. I think it's amazing. Within an hour
 and a half, two hours, they can all hear God's voice. It's amazing. And four simple steps. I
 absolutely love it. Yeah, it's it's also like when you think about it, when you can hear God's
 voice, you're you're no longer alone. You know, I mean, you can know theologically, I'm not alone.
 But when you can hear him, you know, that you know that you're not alone. You know, it's different.
 Absolutely. I have a couple of closing thoughts for you to wrap this thing up.
 Okay.
 Is the fourth movie.
 What's the guy's name? Darren Wilson? I want to say Darren Wilson. Yeah, I did the finger of God
 and did the father of lights videos and whatever the other one was called.
 It's got a new movie called Holy Spirit being premiered on the 20th or premiered for my
 European listeners. On the 20th of this month at Rockettown in Nashville, Grace Center is the
 host church for that. We're going to be there for information about how to do that. If you visit
 our website, we'll put a link in the show notes on how to find more information about that. But
 that's going to be an amazing movie to go to if you're hungry for more of God, hungry for more of
 the Holy Spirit. I really encourage you to go to that. If you live in Nashville, then congratulations.
 Starting October 26th, 23rd to 26th of Beige Parn, we have a Heaven declares conference with
 John Paul Jackson who's an amazing prophet. Bobby Connor who's also an amazing prophet an arty
 candle who is an amazing theologian, someone who loves Jesus and loves the prophetic. He's probably
 the funniest theologian I've ever met. I'm not sure they're known for their sense of humor, are they?
