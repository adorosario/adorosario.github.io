<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 -Mister Jones. -Mister Jones.<br/>
 Tell me about your week.<br/>
 It was a great week, wasn't it?<br/>
 It was a busy week.<br/>
 It was a busy week.<br/>
 We're back to having busy and great weeks.
 Yes, but that is life for eight months of the year when the school is on.
 Very true.<br/>
 You spoke at Evanet, didn't you?<br/>
 didn't you? I did. I continued my theme on on blessing. Yeah, it was really, really good.
 What else? I'm trying to think, gosh, it was a full week, wasn't it? Well,
 kicked off with the Ammonate. We weren't teaching the school this week, which was, oh, we did a
 few bits here and there, but we weren't really teaching. Oh, that's right. The reason that you
 can't remember this week was you're constantly looking forward to having our friends stay with
 us this weekend. That is true. We have friends with us, Krista and Jason Wendell, that we've
 actually mentioned them on the podcast before, haven't we? They're the ones that I wanted to do
 a spinal tap on and then try and clone them because they're amazing.
 Yeah, they are.<br/>
 Yeah, they're two of the most remarkable people I've ever met.
 Very intelligent, very loving, very funny, very sappy, very sappy.
 Keeping me in check was huge amounts of sass.
 Yes, it's a beautiful thing to behold.
 So yeah, we knew they were coming on Saturday, but of course, on Friday was the inauguration.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So they came, they live in DC.<br/>
 They came from DC.<br/>
 Meanwhile, Donald Trump was being inaugurated.
 Is that what's called inaugurated?<br/>
 Well, I don't know.<br/>
 He was being made the president of the United States.
 Something like that.<br/>
 And you watched the inauguration.<br/>
 Yeah, it's the first time I've ever watched one.
 So I watched it obviously on the television from Tennessee.
 But I was pretty impressed with the amount of God stuff that was in the inauguration.
 I didn't get to see it.<br/>
 I was.<br/>
 Where was I?<br/>
 Friday.<br/>
 Oh, yeah, I was getting our car fixed.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So we have a new president of the United States.
 We do.<br/>
 So God bless America.<br/>
 God bless Donald Trump.<br/>
 And we are now, this is the thing.<br/>
 When we got to the United States,<br/>
 George Bush was the president.
</p><ul>
  <li>Oh yeah, for like a month.
  </li><li>Something like that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, well we got here December, 2008.
  </li><li>That's right, yeah.
  </li><li>We were praying for George Bush.
 And then when President Obama was inaugurated,
 we were praying for President Obama.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we'll be happy to pray for Donald Trump too.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And you know, I remember even when Obama came in,
 you know, for the first time,
 being with a group of Christians who were super concerned about Obama, you know, and
 what was this going to mean for a nation as the whole place is going to fall apart.
 But I remember the moment that he got elected, this one person who had been like crazy worried
 about it just said, "Well, he's now going to be our president, so I begin to pray for
 him that way."
 And I was like, "Oh, yeah."
 You shift the focus of your prayers, don't you?
 Yeah.
 It's so clear in Scripture that you pray for your leaders.
 Yeah.
 I'm absolutely happy to pray for my leaders to pray for incredible wisdom. That's got to be the hardest job
 I would not want it. Yeah, I'm I'm fascinated to see
 What's gonna what's gonna happen? And I don't mean that and with any sense of morbid curiosity
 No, I am I'm full-on optimist about what God's gonna do for our nation. So I'm excited about that. Yep
 Then our friends came Saturday. Meanwhile, I left and my friend and I brought we drove to Kentucky
 You did and I did a mini a mini
 What would you call it?
 Boundaries workshop.
 Many boundaries workshop.
 Yeah.
 I'm not sure it's the wisest thing to just do boundaries in a few hours.
 Right.
 Because it's such a radical departure from how most people live.
 And there's so much information.
 Yeah.
 And you don't have a lot of time to unpack it.
 And so the shortest I've ever done it is in two days.
 And at least that gives some time for people to--
 I think whatever you're learning, if you learn it in the concentrated format,
 it's not ideal.
 So if you were at that workshop, I hope you're doing okay.
 But it was great.
 I just, I love the legacy family of churches.
 They're amazing.
 It was really joyful to be there.
 And then it's been nonstop ministry because you were speaking at grace
 out of this morning.
 It's true.
 But why do you abandon leap, your money?
 I, I owe banning leap, your money because I have plagiarized his
 message almost in its entirety twice.
 Yes. So I heard him speak in August, I think, or maybe September. And he spoke on the importance
 of church being family. And it just put into place for me so many things that I couldn't quite
 put my finger on. Why does this bother me so much? Or why does this function like that?
 Why doesn't it work for me? And him putting everything in the context of family made
 Thanks so much, Clearer, for me.
 You were just championing that message when you came home.
 Oh, I was, I was processing it for weeks.
 I'll put Link in the show notes to his version and your version.
 There you go.
 That'll be fun.
 It's a, it's a great illustration, great teaching.
 Yeah, amazing.
 So I just, you know, I just was like, uh, I need to do this teaching.
 And we ended up having lunch with him and I asked him if I could steal it.
 And so he said, yes, he was gracious enough.
 Well, he was really funny because even at the Go conference, you know,
 Lyle was talking about how one of the first messages he ever spoke and he spoke at all
 over the place was one of banning messages that he stole off of, you know, banning and
 banning when banning got up.
 He said, actually that's a message that I stole off of Bill.
 So he's like, you know, it's all public property stuff.
 But yeah, it was, it was quite fun this morning.
 So that was our week.
 Yes.
 It went by with the blur.
 It did.
 Let's talk about our main topic.
 Let's do that.
 We're very excited to have a special guest.
 We're super excited to have a special guest.
  </li><li>Mr. Dan Farrelly.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>All the way from California.
  </li><li>Yes, it's like he walked here or something
 all the way from California.
  </li><li>Dan Farrelly, welcome to our podcast.
  </li><li>Glad to be here.
  </li><li>We're still not walk here.
  </li><li>We're so glad that you're here.
  </li><li>I was tired enough to feel like I walked here,
 but I'm good.
  </li><li>Dan, for those of you who don't know,
 is one of the associate pastors out
 at Bethel Church in Redding, California.
 You're also the Dean of Students
 at your fabulous school of supernatural ministry.
  </li><li>Yeah, absolutely.
 and you're part of the senior team at Bethel.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>What a lot of people don't know,
 although probably people do know,
 'cause I hear you all were always introduced,
 but you predate Bill Johnson at Bethel.
  </li><li>At some level I do.
 So yeah, I've been there 25 years since 1991.
 And when the bill joined the team.
  </li><li>I think he got there in '95 and maybe,
 kind of said yes to the opportunity then started in '96.
 That could be wrong, sorry.
  </li><li>Is that when you started mentoring him then was--
  </li><li>No, no, he started mentoring me.
 I have my seminary degree and I've been to church growth education at a fuller seminary
 and Bill coached me up pretty good.
 That's good.
 That's good.
 I had a plan to do a seeker sensitive singles group and Bill very gently said, "Dan, you
 can do that if you feel like the Lord's called you to, but I don't think that's where the
 church is going."
 He was talking to the church in general.
 He said, "I think the church is just in for the days of the raw power of God being poured
 out on people, which was a far cry from the seeker sensitive thing I was like I was heading
 towards.
 What was your grid for the raw power of the Holy Spirit being poured out on people?
 Oh, I don't really know.
 I don't really know.
 I mean, lots of tongue talking.
 I imagine we'd be part of it.
 But, you know, we'd seen like the move of God hit Stacy in West Campbell a little bit and
 watched Stacy prophesy, you know, in a kind of a ecstatic place and just, you know, be
 very powerful and persuasive with the words all the while her head was going back and forth.
 And we're watching this on videotapes if some of you might need to Google what a videotape is.
 But we're like, wow, is that God?
 I hope it's not God.
 That's that makes me uncomfortable just watching that.
 So I remember a friend of mine watching those videotapes and they said, if her head goes all the way around,
 we're here.
 Well, it was amazing that she could stand.
 Like I just didn't know how she didn't fall over with her head whipping back and forth that fast.
 Yep, absolutely. And the sound stayed pretty true. I guess when you're on the videotapes,
 you're like, I'm not sure how that's working. Yeah. Yeah. So that was what Bill met by the raw
 power of God and many more things that we're still seeing now. But he told me like, you're
 free to you. I had freedom to do it, but I was smart enough to kind of go, I think this guy
 I know something that I don't know.
  </li><li>I think he owns us.
  </li><li>And what I'd be right, if he arrived in '95,
 Bill and Benny would have been touched
 by what the Holy Spirit was doing up in Toronto
 at that point.
 Is that right?
  </li><li>Yeah, they had been.
 They came into the interview, our church board,
 our previous pastor left, our church board invited those of us
 that were on staff.
 It was only like five of us, you know, music pastor,
 family life pastor.
 I was doing singles in college and...
  </li><li>This is all at Bethel, sort of things.
  </li><li>This is all at the church church.
 We know as Bethel.
 Bethel writing.
 We're about a church of 2000 at that point.
 Wow.
 But it had shrunk a little bit in our transition time and then under our capable leadership
 of us without our previous pastor.
 We lost probably about 300 people as well.
 And so these are kind of estimates.
 But I'd imagine there's about 1800 to 1700 people that called Bethel home when Bill
 was being interviewed.
 And they let us sit on the meeting.
 I always thought it was very impressive of the board because in the tradition that I
 I was from, it was kind of like when the baseball managers fired, the batting coaches fired,
 the pitching coaches fired, the youth pastor.
 And so, that's probably what we were in for.
 But they let us be in the interviews because they said, "Hey, you guys are leading the
 church or the fathers of the church, so we'd love for you to be in there."
 So they let us be in on the interviews.
 And Bill had said, "I've been ruined for anything but revival.
 The Lord had touched me like this in Weaverville.
 I didn't know how to steward it.
 I kind of just went back to my programs.
 And he said, if you touch me like that, again, I'll never change the subject.
 So I'm listening to that going.
 Are you all listening to this?
 Cause he's going to, he's going to make this a weird place.
 Like, uh, this is not going to be this nice.
 Do you guys be the truth to any of the Toronto stuff?
 Just from, uh, videotapes of watching, uh, maybe Rodney Howard Brown or I'm
 actually, but he was Rodney Howard Brown and some of those meetings and then
 some of the videotapes and what was your thoughts?
 Oh, uh, horribly afraid.
 I mean, at some level, like, right.
 It was that thing like, is this God?
 I just don't know if it is.
 I don't, I've never seen this side of God.
 I'm uncomfortable with God.
 And, you know, people like being stuck in places, you know,
 for hours or laying down in a parking lot or, you know,
 at restaurants just being in the oil spill of a parking,
 you know, parking stall, like, oh, okay.
 I would go do that.
 Why would God do that?
 Where is this in the Bible?
 You know, in some of those things.
 So it was, but the call of God was obviously on him,
 even though we were like, I was hesitant,
 like I would look around and go,
 you all are nodding your heads,
 "Yes, this is gonna be great."
 I'm like, "You realize we're gonna lose a whole bunch of people."
 Like, this is not normal.
 Right.
 And so I actually thought to myself,
 he's gonna wreck the church.
 Like he's anointed, he's an amazing teacher.
 His kids love him, his family's thriving,
 but he's gonna wreck this church.
 Andy did.
 And I heard that's what happened.
 Like half your people laughed.
 I would say probably about half.
 These are rough numbers again,
 but if we were around 1700,
 it felt like we went down to about 800 or so,
 which is a far cry from, yeah.
 Oh, we were the lampstand church.
 We were the biggest church in town.
 We were doing things in the city.
 We were a classic good quality church.
 We had an evangelist as a pastor
 who loved people as a fabulous teacher.
 We all were assigned, the model of growth there
 was you grow a big youth group, you get a big choir,
 you get a big, we'll get a big Christian school.
 And so we all just ran our ministries
 and didn't scare anybody, weren't too weird, but we still,
 we still had our, we spoke in tongues
 and we could raise our hands in worship
 and a little dancing every once in a while.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Ooh, well we had one lady that used to dance,
 the whole congregation didn't,
 but one lady would used to dance and we were kind of
 didn't know what to do with her.
 So she would dance and we kind of,
 we said, if you must dance, go dance in the corner
 back there.
 So we'd have her dance at the farthest corner
 that we could in the church.
 And everyone saw in the joy of the Lord,
 she would just dance up towards the front
 and our ushers in their maroon jackets
 with all like just gently growler back.
 Like, this is your video.
 I mean, that's your spot back there.
 So far cry from the freedom and the joy,
  </li><li>That's a special worship that Bill was leading us in.
 So that was our one dancer.
 There was a prophetic word.
 I've heard of Tom Kinsett.
 I see a time when all the front is full of dancing and banners.
 And I remember being in the staff meeting
 and we all were saying, no, that's not gonna happen.
 Like she is a tremendous prophet, but that's not us.
 You just, like prophets are not batting 1,000 all the time.
  </li><li>Right, yeah, she could be missing it.
  </li><li>She's missing there.
  </li><li>Don't be discouraged, keep trying, love.
 Exactly.
 Exactly.
 But you know, sure enough, 18 months later, there was this joyous praise.
 And so the Holy Spirit begins to presumably Bill gets the job.
 We did.
 I hired him.
 Okay.
 Kidding boss.
 Yeah.
 They said, come on along.
 I love that you think that Bill listens to our body.
 Sure.
 He's probably never going to get this.
 Oh, that was a joke to boss.
 I see I'm going to have to edit this podcast very seriously in order for you to have jobs
 security.
 So, Bittle gets hired and his openness, his love of the presence of God and the Holy
 Spirit begins to change the shape and experience of your church services and about 800,000
 people leave.
 Yeah.
 How's everybody feeling at that moment?
 Well, I mean, lots of different ways.
 So the quality, steady, eddy, admin people were like, oh, we can't stay with this.
 This isn't great.
 Financially, even if folks were attending, maybe they weren't giving as a way of saying,
 we're not sure about this situation.
 Then the choir director, who's just fabulous, we were the church that had 8,000 people come
 in over eight Christmas programs.
 And so we had of 8,000 people in the community come watch our program.
 He says, I feel like the Lord's not going to have me lead a Christmas pageant this year.
 And I remember Bill saying, please, please don't kill that too.
 The congregation thinks I'm killing all these ministries.
 I actually love them.
 I love them.
 And I, you know, I don't want them to go away.
 So, but he felt like that, that, that market heard from the Lord and that.
 So he's like, okay, if you, if that's what you think we're supposed to do.
 So in the Lord had told Bill, go slowly.
 The Lord and Bill's idea of going slowly
 was a little different than my idea of going slowly.
 (laughing)
 I'm like, that's slowly.
 But then he said that the Lord told him,
 okay, you don't need to go as slowly anymore.
 And we went more aggressively and to just free,
 this sorts of things like people just wooing in church.
 And just shouting in church,
 I'd be like, what is going on?
 Like that's not--
 And are there manifestations or people falling over?
 Are people shaking?
 Are they laughing?
 There's not a ton.
 You know, but like, remember, I think Bill tells the story,
 but he was preaching one Sunday
 and holy laughter hit one person.
 The rest of the congregation wasn't touched
 or didn't join in.
 And but Bill said in his heart, he knew like,
 all right, it started.
 We're on this adventure.
 And you know, I was probably thinking like,
 how do we get rid of that guy and send a measure over there?
 (laughing)
 So let's talk about your personal journey with that.
 So as the manifestations,
 as the presence of the Holy Spirit begins to,
 the tangible sense of His presence begins to rise
 and perhaps behave your manifestations
 outworkings of that are outside of your comfort zone.
 What, how are you feeling when the happens?
 Uncomfortable because you're thinking about.
 They're outside the comfort zone.
 I mean, at some level, I just had not seen these sort of things
 and we were losing people I really cared about.
 and the people that were in the church
 that had been kind of lifers
 were like, we just are not comfortable with this anymore.
 And in your head, if the Lord's in it,
 it's gonna go smoothly.
  </li><li>Of course.
  </li><li>And everybody's gonna agree.
 Of course you look at scripture and it doesn't go that way.
 But, so uncomfortable with the, I don't know,
 the expression, it was confusing to me.
 I guess it was confusing.
 I didn't like not being respected
 like the other churches in town
 were like, what's going on up there?
  </li><li>Right, what have you done?
  </li><li>What have you done yet?
 you were the Lambstand Church and now you've lost all these people. They're kind of landing
 in a couple of other churches going, "What's going on?"
 And everybody's speaking rumors no doubt.
 Yeah, they're like, "Are you really sacrificing animals up there at the church?" They know
 that's not actually true.
 Thanks for asking.
 Thanks for asking.
 But yes, you can rest assured we're not doing that. So it was difficult to bear the stigma
 and when it wasn't looking successful either.
 Right.
 we have two full services of a thousand folks in the car in the you know on a Sunday morning
 and we end up kind of collapsing down to one service that's you know about three quarters full
 and that says you know you poured yourself into a place seeing that happen you're just
 disappointed share those disappointed share and confused about that and you don't know what it's
 on to either because it's not like the whole experience like no no there's no model like well
 it's going to turn into this like i am like i had never been to Toronto so like the idea of
 turning into Toronto was i'd foreign to me and and not that interesting to me because i i liked
 like how it was.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, I liked it before.
 So that was part of that process.
 You know, I think in that season, Bill was doing the best
 you could to explain, and I was kind of desperately,
 you know, thinking, you know, talking to the Lord,
 like, what is going on here?
 And there was no expectation that you had to like get it all,
 like, which I appreciated about Bill.
 Like the first time I saw a fire tunnel,
 which for us is instead of people lining up for prayer,
 which was spooky enough at some point
 when they would do that,
 like you're we're going to take down the chairs and line up for prayer. What's what? All right.
 Then they're like, instead of that, we're going to actually, you know, put the prayer team on both
 sides of a tunnel kind of and let people walk through. And you know, they would get hit by the
 power of God or holy laughter or just, you know, just look silly. The first time I saw that happen
 in my own church on a Sunday night, I'm in the back going, never, I'm never going near that. Like,
 I have no spot. I work out for you. My box. Well, I, you know, I appreciate Bill's graciousness.
 I stopped being, I said, I was completely uncomfortable with that.
 Like I, there was way too much flesh, way too much.
 I don't know the motives of the people.
 I haven't seen that before.
 I just extreme then comfortable.
  </li><li>So you are struggling.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And Bill's like, Dan, don't worry about it.
 If you, you know, you don't have to figure this all out.
 Just I'm good with you and, you know, we'll figure it out.
 So I'm struggling.
  </li><li>So you clearly, so on the one hand,
 you are struggling with what you're seeing.
 It's outside your paradigm.
 You have no grid for it.
 either biblically or practically.
 But it's clear on the other hand,
 you have deep respect for Bill.
  </li><li>Yeah, exactly.
  </li><li>And so you're like, okay, I don't know what's going on,
 but I do trust you, God, would you help me?
  </li><li>Yeah, absolutely.
 And then of course, going into the scripture
 and you begin to realize,
 scripture's actually pretty spooky as well.
 Lots of weird stuff happening.
  </li><li>Cheers.
  </li><li>Really, that we've totally like,
 just go over like it's nothing.
 And suddenly those things are coming alive
 And just as simple as the church deciding to not
 have circumcision for the Gentiles,
 I mean, that's like classic break in the Bible law there.
 And they're like, no, it's for change in that.
 And now Jesus got appears and a sheet comes down
 out of heaven and an angel says,
 "Go ask that guy at that guy's house and he has the vision
 and then there's the knock at the door
 and come preach to us."
 And then, well, finally it ran into tongues.
 Then the power of God fell
 and they began to manifest the Holy Spirit
 in Cornelius' house.
 So you began to see lots of times
 there is an experiential gospel,
 and lots of times in the Lord's doing a great thing,
 there have been profound experiences.
 And you realize the Quakers are called the Quakers
 for a reason.
 And the Shakers are called the Shakers for a reason.
 We're used to them being stoic, no fun people.
 But they actually had these manifestations before.
  </li><li>And the Pentecostals were probably
 the Holy Rollers for a reason.
  </li><li>Yeah, for a reason.
 it was like I was always kind of smugly satisfied that I wasn't one of them. I was like a third
 waiver. That was the name that kind of C.P.R. Wagner had called it. It was the evangelical kind
 of gently coming into some of these more spiritual things. It's Evangelicism++.
 Yeah. You know, we're slightly cooler. We know stuff that you don't.
 So then what shifted for you? How did you shift from just a mental ascent,
 You know, theological nod.
 I see that is in the Bible to embracing it.
 Well, I mean, I was still having to preach to my singles every week.
 And so, and they were confused.
 Like, so I had this little mini congregation inside a larger congregation.
 And so I'm, I'm trying to sort through, you know, is this a Lord?
 And if so, how is this a Lord?
 You know, I came up with a bunch of dumb, you know, internal theology.
 Luckily I didn't teach.
 But I remember, you know, one of them was like, okay, Lord, maybe this
 in the dry seasons of people's life,
 they have, with their bare hands,
 hewned out a cistern of a repository
 of the presence of God.
 And I have been lazy and have not dug out a cistern
 in the myri clay of a place to catch the move of God.
 And so they're celebrating this outpouring
 that I'm unable to, ah, ah, you know?
 In other words, I wasn't, I didn't earn it.
 You know, I didn't work for it.
 So some of those things, you know, bit by bit,
 I think my front banning was involved and we were trying to figure things out a little
 bit.
 And people I had trusted were having experiences.
 And I'd quizzed about that.
 Like, "Okay, were you...
 Could you have got up?"
 I saw you fall down.
 Did you have to fall down?
 Or...
 I love that.
 So I just started really kind of interviewing people and trying to understand what their
 experience was.
 And over time, over time, where I got to, is realizing that it's God and moving on a
 human.
 It's always both flesh and the divine involved.
 And you're like, okay, so I shouldn't be like,
 I had to kind of give up being the flesh police.
 And I kind of like, is that 99% God?
 Is that 97% pure, you know, Holy Spirit interaction?
 And I had to realize, you know, it actually gets placed.
 If that's 5% God and 95% human,
 I'm actually good with the 5% of God
 that somebody's experiencing in this particular move.
 And then, you know, later on, I can say now, like,
 That's actually how it is all the time, right?
 We have a, in the moment of generosity,
 there's a mixture of the divine moving on us.
 And when we preach, there's a moment when you feel like,
 this is the Lord is speaking through me.
 And then there's, if you're like me,
 there's lots of moments when you,
 you're not quite sure you're speaking through you.
 You're the best you can.
 You hope he's gonna do something good.
 You're cooperating with him as best you can.
 And be like, oh, you always love to fall on people
 and to do this together.
 And so I kind of, you know, got a little bit more comfortable
 with like that.
 It had to be fully divine.
 I mean, you had to be in a trance to give a prophetic word.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>The idea that you could, if you prophesied,
 you have to prophesy perfectly,
 or we're gonna stone you.
 Like this is clearly led out of the Old Testament.
 So it was moving a little bit and realizing,
 oh, that's not quite how prophecy works.
 They tested the spirits and the New Testament.
 And so it's like, oh, you could have a wrong prophetic word
 that the church said, hey, you kind of missed that one
 and we're doing something else.
 So going to the Bible, I guess, was part of it.
 Seeing trusted people have experiences.
 And then ultimately, I don't remember really,
 I think it was like 12 months in or something like that.
 I got hit by the power of God.
 And at that point, I remember going, oh, oh, oh,
 I'm so sorry, Heavenly Father,
 I didn't know this was so true.
 Wow.
 That was at a moment when that intellectual guy is like,
 I could not figure it out,
 but then he'd touched me physically and I'm like,
 oh, please forgive me, I didn't realize this is true.
 At some level, I was at a patronizing sort of like,
 I'm sure that's good for you.
 And you likely did drugs previously.
 I've never done drugs myself.
  </li><li>Right, you must be slightly broken.
  </li><li>Yes, you must be slightly, exactly.
 So the Lord is understood you and graciously hit you
 with ecstasy, which I don't need, I have faith.
 But, (laughs)
 so, but you know, after the experience like,
 oh, oh, that's what they're talking about.
 It made a lot more sense after an encounter,
 which I'm grateful to the Lord,
 because I know some folks are in our environment
 and don't have like a moment like that.
 And I don't even tell them that they have to have
 a moment like that.
 like, but it is weird being what feels like the only sober person at a party.
 Yeah. And I love that you went through that questioning that, you know, we come up with faulty
 theologies to explain our what we're not experiencing. And yes, I remember thinking, you know, do I
 have a pulse? Am I insane? Repentive everything I can think of. But I love what you said at the end
 that you had this experience. Remember, John Arnott wants to throw away statement. He said,
 "A healthy dose of experience does wonders for theology."
  </li><li>Yeah, I thought that's, he said,
 you know, Saul had really great theology
 until he got knocked to the ground, blinded by light.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>A healthy dose of experience does
  </li><li>But I love the, I love the,
 how do I say the gentleness?
 Like that's not unequivocal.
 'Cause I would be nervous if you said
 experience is what you need, right?
 'Cause then you have another experience
 and your theology changes.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, as John said, it's a dose of experience.
  </li><li>It's the teaching of the church that the saints have experienced,
 that Christ gave to us.
 And so I think having both of those together.
  </li><li>It's amazing.
  </li><li>But every once in a while, we got a little cavalier,
 like you're only one experience away from having a new theology.
 And I'm like, I actually don't like,
 I get what you're trying to say without.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You're trying to invite people into,
 he's more than the God of your mind.
 So I get that, but I am uncomfortable with the implications of that.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'd recommend, no, I actually said to a couple of my friends,
 like I wish you could say in that.
 I wish you'd be more nuanced.
 (laughing)
 Because I could see how that's gonna become
 one tweet away from heresy.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yes.
 That was before tweeting.
 Just by the way, we're still in '97, '98, 2000.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Good thing too, right?
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Oh God.
  </li><li>Could you imagine live streaming that,
 as that was happening?
 Okay, we'd have seven people in the church.
 So.
 (laughing)
 It is crazy to me, and it must be crazy to you.
 You must have to stop and think about what God has done
 in your church history.
 Does it occur to you that you guys are a revival center
 that is ministering to the nations,
 through everything you're doing,
 through Bethel worship, through Bethel media,
 through your schools, through your mission?
 I mean, how many students do you send a year
 out on their outreach and mission strips?
  </li><li>Oh, well, if there's about 2,300 first, second,
 and third year students.
 So, some percentage, so 1,800 of them or so
 go out for 10 days.
 It's amazing.
 Two weeks ahead all over the earth.
 But between all the teaching, the schools, the books, you've done a phenomenal job.
 Those aren't all my books that you're talking about.
 Thank you.
 Yes.
 Too clarifying.
 The millions of books you've written down.
 Bill and Chris are dead.
 Right like crazy and Paul Manwaring as well.
 But your whole team, I mean you guys have done an amazing job.
 Everybody but me.
 Yes.
 You've done an amazing job of resourcing the body.
 Did you ever consider that in the early days?
 No, not in the early days.
 I mean, I'm happy that the board didn't,
 they stayed with Bill.
 Like when you go from,
 we've got a brand new sanctuary that's with a bigger mortgage
 than we've ever had to pay
 and you go from two congregations to one.
 And yet they were nervous during that season.
 And we were poor during that season.
 There's about seven years when we were like,
 "Hey, don't spend any more money.
 We're out of money."
 And several times they had to hold our paychecks.
 One time, I remember one of the businessmen
 in our church actually took out a home equity line
 to pay our two week salary
 because the church couldn't do it.
 And several times, hey, wait till,
 could you guys wait till next Sunday, if at all possible?
 Those of us that were living check to check,
 it was like, we'll do something.
 Chris talks about how, you know,
 these are the 90 days due, these are the 60 days,
 these are the 30 days in figuring out
 how we're gonna pay people.
 So we did not feel like a worldwide apostolic center
 you know, in those days.
 And Steve D'Souva, who was our com controller at the time,
 he said, since there was no money to count,
 he would actually just go over to the prayer house
 and just hold the books before the Lord
 and say, Lord, you have to come through here.
 We can't do these things.
  </li><li>But this is the thing I love.
 I love all of this.
 I love, you know, from,
 I'm more familiar with Toronto's history
 than I am, Bethel's history,
 but I just love that people jump into a point in time
 and then begin to make assumptions
 about what they know of you from now.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And are completely unaware of the history
 of how you got where you are.
  </li><li>Well, what it cost you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I remember hearing a story that Bill had caught wind
 of the fact because of the financial situation
 that missionaries that you guys supported,
 you were gonna have to withhold their--
 Yeah, it's just that in our wisdom,
 when our previous pastor left that we thought,
 you know what, we can't really afford this.
 We can't afford to pay our missionaries.
 So during that nine months before Bill came,
 we had decided in the great wisdom of the Lord
 and our giant faith that we would write a very polite letter
 to our missionaries that we would not be able
 to support them for several months,
 but we would look forward to supporting them in the future
 and they hadn't done anything wrong.
 But we're totally good with you.
 We just don't have the money.
 And Bill, like somewhere again,
 again, this is a long time ago and we never bothered to write it down because you don't
 think because it looked like he was going to get fired and we were going to.
 So he kind of said to us and there's only fibers though he said, I understand that you
 guys have stopped supporting the missionaries. I just found that out and we're like, yeah,
 it's just, you know, could we can afford it? And he's like, oh, you know, that's, that's
 not all right. Like we're going to, we'll do whatever it takes, including us not drawing
 salary in order to pay them back immediately all that we've held over the four months or
 five months or something, whatever it had been.
 And we're going to ask the forgiveness and write them an apology letter, and then that
 is unequivocal.
 We are not, that is a bill we will never, we'll pay, we'll not pay other people, but it's
 not going to happen to our missionaries.
 And so it was a very interesting moment where it seems smart at the time that we made that
 decision.
 Like, yeah, it's hard to do, but yes.
 Frankly, it wasn't that hard to do.
 These are strangers on the other side of the world
 at some level.
 I'd like to say now it was hard to do,
 but just not sure I actually felt the burden
 or the weight of it when we were doing it.
 Please forgive me, Lord, and missionaries.
 So he restores, he sends that to them.
 And as soon as he says it, it feels like, of course.
 That's one of those things where,
 yeah, I've got a Bible degree
 I got a master's of divinity and you think you're making great choices and he's like,
 "No, no, we don't send people to battle and pull back from them."
 And you're like, "Yeah, sorry." That was bad. But it was that sort of integrity, right? So when
 spooky stuff's happening in church and he's okay with it, you're like, "I think I corrected
 me pretty gently." And in the moment, I knew he was super right. And I'm like, "There's
 something to this guy." So here's something I've always been fascinated to know.
 I know that God is super intentional.
 I know that he does nothing without telling the prophets first.
 And so you're describing to us what the Bethel, the local church, looked like,
 how many years were you talking about 20, 20, 30 years ago?
 And now Bethel, the church is this resource center for the world, just with tremendous
 significance. There's churches around the world who, and I always get a google out of this,
 would probably maybe not even agree with some of Bethel's theology, but love Bethel's worship.
 That's inconceivable. And aren't aware of where this incredible
 anointed music came from. You know, stuff like that. Your impact in the nation is on a tremendous
 degree. My question is, what was the mindset shift that had to take place in the lives of the
 individual leaders and the corporate sense to come into agreement with God, saying, "Hey,
 you think of yourself as a local church with local influence, but you're actually
 an apostolic resource center for the world. Talk to me about that. How did that happen?
 Yeah, that's, you know, there's not one decision or one moment. There's like a thousand moments
 in that. I think that Bill's spoken about this, that he used to preach when he was in
 Weaverville. So Reading has about 100,000 people around. And then we're the biggest thing for two
 and a half hours in either way. And Bill was up in about an hour and a half up into the mountains
 at a town of 3,000 people and he had about 200 people in the church or so.
 So size wise, percentage wise, he had a large amount of the town in his church.
 But he was there for 17 years and he used to preach them like you guys are touching the
 world.
 They had sent people to China, to minister in China.
 They had a ministry to the orphans in Mexico.
 And so he expected, he would talk to them like they were leaders that were going to impact
 the world.
 And he has, I think he has a book about the,
 it's the center of the universe.
 He used to call, we were able to center of the universe.
 And he would write weekly in their bulletin.
 And as he was kind of learning the craft of writing
 and trying to honor the Lord's calling to write,
 you know, I don't think he'd written a book till he's 50 or so,
 which gives me great hope.
 (laughs)
 Being such a young man as I am.
 But the--
  </li><li>Says spring chicken.
  </li><li>Yeah, so he would, he began to,
 he always kind of internally,
 I don't know if he had this idea of this,
 it would be this big,
 But the idea that God was this big
 and that the people of God should set their sights
 on this level of impact.
 And then his right hand person, Chris Valtin, who's my boss
 and I love him too.
 Chris owns a part store and a Dick Joyce
 a prophet prophesies him, says, "Behold, a pillar
 in the house, the Lord, the Lord talks to Chris
 at one season says you're gonna stand before leaders
 and government officials."
 And so there's this idea that they have
 that it took, it's been taking 30 years to come to pass,
 but the Lord had been speaking to them prophetically
 about what they would be doing.
 And Bill's teaching gift was always amazing.
 Like even when I was afraid of what he would,
 the move of the Holy Spirit, he was championing,
 he was preaching out of Daniel and it was rocking me
 as I listened on the cassette tapes in my car.
 Yes, which by the way, I still have a cassette recorder
 in my car.
  </li><li>That's impressive.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's only when I get my radio to actually turn on,
 but that's another story.
 (laughing)
 I have to put a cassette tape in, hit a jacked,
 and then my radio will work.
 But yeah.
  </li><li>Wow, that's fancy.
  </li><li>That's fancy.
  </li><li>That's a lot of people have things like that.
 So it's been in him, but I don't think we saw
 what was gonna be happening in the same degree.
 People, remember, we were kind of beginning to believe
 that apostles were still for today.
 We were not even totally sure of that.
 And then people, other ministers were around Bill going,
 we think you're an apostle and Bill's like,
 "Ah, you know, I don't."
 He was slow in coming to that.
 He's always never wanted to call himself that
 and felt like if the gifts and call of God were there,
 the church would recognize that at some level.
 And then we're not, you know, again,
 we just call him Bill and some folks, Pastor Bill,
 and he's much more Apostle Bill,
 but Pastor Bill fits better.
 So he had a growing sense why we were,
 we had to kind of relook at Scripture and go,
 "Are apostles for today?"
 You know? - Right.
  </li><li>And sort that out.
 And when you answer like, "Yes."
 And then we think prophets are for today and that they should be deeply involved and maybe
 not the pastors and leaders, I'm sorry, the pastors and teachers leading the church, but
 the apostles and prophets leading the church is like, there was partly that switch.
 So some flexibility there was part of it.
 People loved listening to him.
 And early on it was like some prophetic work came that said we needed to let Bill travel
 and he needs to be sewn into the church nationally.
 And again, that's hard to do when you're shrinking and your senior pastor is not in there on
 a Sunday and somebody else is having to cover.
 And there's a thing where the board would be like, what are we paying you for?
 Our board didn't do that, but it'd be natural for boards to do that.
 And it'd be natural for the people to do that.
 But the prophetic word is like, you need to sow him.
 And so we're like, okay, you know, we'll figure that out.
 At some levels of congregant didn't feel like they had much choice about that.
 Like he wasn't asking permission.
 And so he was traveling more and then he was bringing people in and that were carrying
 the anointing.
 And during that season, we learned to value the anointing even if the person had some
 rough edges or it was difficult to appreciate parts of what they were doing.
 And I had a very much a mindset that the shepherd, the pastor, protected the sheep.
 I remember the Sunday when Speaker was there and I'm like, I was just uncomfortable by
 the guy preaching a 45-minute offering message.
 Like I'm like, and then taking his own offering.
 I didn't know I had a rule against that,
 but as soon as he did it, I went,
 "Oh yeah, yeah, you don't,
 "if you're gonna preach for 45 minutes,
 "you should not take your own offering."
 My evangelical rule.
 So then I'm looking at Bill,
 like Bill, get up and kick that man off stage.
 Like what are you gonna do?
 Like get up, go get him, get the hook.
 I grew up in an environment where the bastard,
 no problem going and getting the hook.
 I'd actually walk him on stage,
 said, "Brother, sit down, please."
 And then we're going to re-teach or fix something that happened.
 But Bill was very much like I won't be offended by the container
 the annoying comes in and I won't bring somebody in and try to control them.
 I'm going to trust my sheep to be able to figure out what the good parts are
 and what the bad parts are.
 And then he would not the next Sunday kind of clean up a mess either.
 It was like, I would have been so like, let's talk about last Sunday.
 Bill's like, no, it'll be fine.
 And he was okay with us having private conversations.
 And when people would come, he didn't like, you know, mandate, listen,
 just, you know, this is what you say.
 He was just like, this is, we'll just work this out as a family.
 When we got this 70% great message and 30% that wasn't so great.
 So that's some, that was part of some of our flexibility that was growing.
 And you talk so casually about the ease of this.
 Was there never any doubt?
 Was there never any wrestle?
 Was there never any?
  </li><li>I had doubt and wrestle.
 I think that Bill didn't, Bill talks about this.
 Like he knew at the Lord, he called,
 that the Lord was in these manifestations
 and that it was a revival of joy,
 that we had revivals based on hunger
 or something else, but he's a revival of joy and grace.
 The Lord is in this.
 And so he moved with great assurance in these things.
 A little more than I was comfortable with.
 I mean, I wanted to, I'm used to a little bit of
 human doubt in there a little bit and like I would have felt a little bit more like acceptable.
 But he was resolved and he knew Papa was in it. I think that one of the interesting things about
 working with Bill is I'm working for a guy who doesn't have a classical education and Christian
 education. He's a fifth generation pastor. He's grown up in the School of Faith, not the School of
 Western culture and what you know, I love my education, but I'm, I think sometimes we are
 schooled in doubt, even in Bible college and in seminary, and set up being schooled in faith.
 Like here's how to operate in faith and here's how to, you know, what faith actually looks like.
 And this is how we press into faith. You know, I didn't have a lot of that. I was like,
 what is Augustine's position on this or, you know, what, you know, what were the successful
 parts of Luther's, you know, Reformation and what are the unsuccessful parts.
 And so we talk a lot about and then sometimes it's like, well, all that is in the spiritual
 formation department, you know, of your education.
 And so I think in being with Bill, I have a guy who hangs out with Jesus who recognizes
 the presence of the Lord, who's been walking this road for a long time.
 And he's taught me a ton about faith and being a follower and letting be, you know, abiding
 in the Lord and walking with him into the things that are ahead for you.
 That's amazing.
 Yeah, I asked Danny the same question Danny spoke was here last year and I asked any the same question and he gave me exactly the same answer.
 And I don't know whether I was looking for something more I think I was like no please please identify with struggle tell me the you know but you're like no we just believed.
 And I was like oh I'm sure the something in the Bible about that yeah yeah there's faith and I think there was there was fruit as well in the sense of the quality of relationships I.
 And then when Bill and Chris and Kathy and Danny and Sherry were in our life,
 you could see the quality of covenant love that was there.
 And these folks that would laugh together very hard,
 who'd gone through just crazy situations in their mountain town,
 who had crazy stories about each other.
 There was a real deep affection of folks who'd walked together for a lot, a lot of years.
 And I often talk about like the part of this secret of Bethel is this
 at the core with Charlie Harper and Julie Harper, some other folks, there is this radioactive core
 of covenant friendship that emanates like a nuclear reactor just feeding the whole environment.
 There's a settledness about these long-term relationships. Even with Eric and Brian coming
 up into their ministry, within that there's this network of affection and shared history
 that beats at the center of what we're doing one of my favorite things that
 Danny did when he was here was he showed his wedding video yes and he you know so here's the video
 that presents these world changers in a fairly unflattering light see you but look at the
 sure person bill no he's showing that to me.
 He's a bit scandalous time.
 Would you would you ever have thought that this room full of somewhat socially awkward people
 whatever be world-changing.
 I'll tell them you said that.
 And I'm quoting.
 But I so, there's something so endearing about that story.
 And I love dropping in where we are right now and looking backwards.
 Because I think a lot of people drop in and look at what you're doing now and go, "If
 I do what you're doing now, I'll get what you have."
 And you're like, "No, you have to do what they did for 20 plus years."
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 lot of up sowing and way ahead of the fact.
 And we were learning on the fly.
 So hopefully you don't have to make all the mistakes
 that we made, but there will be some price to pay.
 Some, you have to kind of learn some things.
 And we don't think there's a formula to follow obviously,
 but it has been about following the presence of the Lord.
 And early on I asked Bill, like, hey,
 we need a mission statement.
 And Bill's like, I don't want a mission statement
 that's going to sit in a file cabinet.
 Like I'm not interested in.
 And I'm like, I'm trying to give people context
 for why they should stay at this church
 and why they should come here and what we're doing
 because it's pretty strange.
 You roll in, you don't know what's happening.
 A lot of our steady eddies had left.
 The ushers were, it was just all different.
 One morning this was no lie during a joyful worship.
 We had a guy do back flips across the front of the sanctuary.
 So just, joo, joo, joo, he's up there
 and he did them quite well.
 Got a lot of height on that.
 I give him a 10.
 I got all the pastors held up.
 But I remember that happened.
 I was just so frustrated with that.
 And I was like, what?
 Are we doing backflips in church now?
 Tell me no.
 So I look at, I should build a look
 and Bill kind of looks at me and Cox has had his head
 and said, well, that's, you don't see that on church
 every day.
 And I'm like, yeah, you don't because it's terrible.
 You know, that's my eyes.
 I said back to him.
 (laughing)
 And so, but I'm trying to follow the lead of my pastor.
 So I kind of walk over,
 I was sitting a little bit away from him.
 I said, "Are we all right with these backflips?"
 And I remember Bill said, "Well, I don't know."
 And I think he told the guy just to one more time.
 If you feel that of the Lord,
 you could do it one more time.
 He did the backflips one more time.
 And then we're like, "Okay, let's not do that anymore."
 And that time, the town had already thought
 you guys are a circus up there.
 And I'm like, "Yeah, it's happened.
 "It's a circus."
 Oh, he needed some snakes to bring in the snakes.
 And we never had crevat.
 But that's part of that,
 you know, that his wanting to follow the presence.
 So we're working on this mission statement and I said,
 you know, we had a bunch of goes at it and we're writing it.
 It was like, oh, we're just, you know,
 we're, it's the advancing of the kingdom,
 personally, regionally and globally
 through his manifest presence.
 And so it's revival.
 So this idea of the manifest presence,
 the Lord kind of became very central.
 And then one of the, you know, we would, our shorthand was, you know, revival through
 his presence and then revival through the local church.
 So that's always been in Bill's heart that the local church would be the source of revival,
 not even Bethel in not Toronto, but the local congregation would have, would find its expression
 that's unique to them and then it would bring the kingdom and its environment.
 That's so good.
 Gosh, I love that.
 That's amazing.
 Thank you for taking us a trip down memory lane.
 We've had the privilege of having you at our school for the last five years.
 Is that right?
 Five years.
 We bring you in every year to teach on this whole topic of brave communication.
 You're consistently rated as one of our crowd favorites.
 And the whole message of brave communication has been super powerful for our culture.
 Grace and I give us a 30,000 view of brave communication.
 Yeah, it's a set of tools I learned in my 20s that I didn't have before.
 So they were revolutionary for me.
 It's like, wow, I could actually learn communication skills.
 I thought you were just stuck with them.
 The ones you learned in the home you grew up in.
 And it was kind of the way I say it now is the capacity,
 can you actually hear somebody else's heart?
 Do you know your own heart and can you share your heart?
 And then with that information, create a new normal going forward.
 And so these are tools to help you--
 and lots of us just withdraw.
 If something goes weird, we would withdraw.
 or we attack, those are the only two tools we have
 and fight or flight and we fall into these ongoing traps
 in this area.
 So brave communications, here's somebody else
 and then actually know what's going on with you emotionally.
 I think that our emotions are powerfully involved
 in our communication.
 We tend to, we imagine that it's mostly information,
 that the world moves on information
 and that's what's the most important.
 And if you just had the right ideas,
 you would agree with me and it actually doesn't function
 way, our emotional world is central to our communication. And so we talk a lot about how to
 like understand that emotional world and then use that to build intimacy in the moment of crisis.
 And I'm hoping that you don't have to have the talk with people. But you can have lots of small
 conversations and make adjustments as you create your relationship along the way. So that would be
 that the goal of it is to actually build intimacy and connection in the time of crisis.
 You don't use it all the time.
 It's just when you have strong emotions or they have strong emotions when we're problem-solving
 and when there's confusion.
 These are just simple tools to use.
 And where did you learn when you said you learned them in your 20s?
 But where did you learn them?
 You've clearly refined them over the years as well.
 They've grown.
 I mean, they became so handy to me.
 I remember as I was 24.
 I think I was going to be a camp counselor at Redwood camp and outside Santa Cruz in
 California.
 And they were simply, you know, these skills of reflective listening, active listening
 and I message about how much it warms the human heart to be listened to.
 And it was like, wow, why haven't I learned these things?
 This would have been so helpful when I was a junior high pastor, you know, and when I,
 because I was, you know, through my Bible college years, I was also a junior high pastor, just
 even in dating or going through conflicts. And then over time, I think I learned more about
 emotions. And so that's kind of come into the discussion a little bit more. But that's
 where I learned them. It's just they want us to know how to relate to junior high and elementary
 kids without controlling them and without running them over. How do we listen to more conversation?
 And it turns out those are good skills for all humans, not just small children.
 Absolutely. I think one of the things I've loved hearing you share in your preamble,
 in your setup when you come in, you teach. You talk about feeling like a ninja. I've got some tools
 in my back pocket that I don't need to let anxiety grip my heart when I sense conflict is coming.
 It's not that I can outsmart you, but it's that peace going, "Actually, I'm not scared of the
 conflict that you can come because I'm going to be really good at listening to the message
 behind the message." I feel confident that I've got some good skills to make my heart known.
 And actually, I've got some confidence
 that we're gonna get through this.
 And that just lowers the anxiety considerably
 in relationships.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>And I love what you teach that, hey,
 when I teach you these skills,
 the skills at first will feel artificial.
 But the more you practice them,
 the becomes second nature to you.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>What have you seen happen in your own culture
 as you've been teaching the people
 in your own environment these skills?
 Well, they don't need to run from difficult conversations.
 You know, they can, and they can,
 nobody's caught off guard like,
 why are you speaking to me this way?
 Or, you know, why would you say that to me?
 You know, so it's, I think it goes alongside with our,
 the culture of honor we've talked about is that,
 is best we can, as it depends on us,
 we are gonna act in honor towards people.
 And honor can sometimes be, you know,
 an ethereal, you know, just kind of a concept.
 But I think that this brave communication
 where you're listening to somebody's heart
 and sharing your own is actually like a tangible way to say,
 and my honor and my love is gonna be manifested this way.
 And when you do, when you are prepared,
 you feel more confidence.
 And if you come to the moment of crisis
 in the relationship or a moment of just,
 "Hey, we need to create a new normal.
 "It's not a crisis.
 "There's some wear and tear.
 "Like we're not quite thriving,
 "or at least I'm not thriving."
 When you have some tools,
 you come with a playfulness and hopefulness
 that we're gonna get through this,
 I don't mean to catch off guard,
 but there's some things I'd like to sort out
 so if we can find a new way forward.
 So that's how they function.
  </li><li>It was either, we heard Danny's there
 or is in Danny's book, A Culture of Honor,
 where he talked about a culture of honor
 will never actually come into play
 without a healthy culture of confrontation.
  </li><li>Absolutely, yeah.
  </li><li>Because we end up avoiding it.
 Like it's not people mistake, I think, we do honor
 and you get in their environment and their culture,
 like you guys just don't tell each other the truth.
 Some of you won't even give yourself an opinion
 because you don't feel allowed to because honor says
 you can't say anything and we're like,
 that's not how fun it feels.
 That's not how honor works at all.
  </li><li>It's not a culture of honor,
 if all I do is tell you you're awesome.
  </li><li>Hey, totally.
  </li><li>Well, it's not real, isn't it?
  </li><li>Totally, yeah.
 And confrontation used to be a really scary word,
 but we talk about confrontation with a small C,
 that it's a really healthy thing.
 Like I love you enough and value our relationship enough
 to let you in on the stuff that is degrading
 my quality of connection.
  </li><li>To not abandon you,
 just like to continue to put up and put up
 until I disappear or I make you disappear.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Or I blow up, so it's like, let's work this out now.
  </li><li>At dinner tonight, you had this great phrase
 where you talk about, you know,
 healthy maturity allows us to disagree without divorce.
 And you had this other thing,
 talk a little bit about the importance of feelings.
 Dinner, you were talking about,
 sometimes we think that other people's emotions
 are getting in the way of the content.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's exactly what it's like.
 When I say somebody's value to me,
 that they're having a genuine emotion about a situation,
 we're talking about the election.
 Like there's folks who have it on different sides
 of the election, and they are very frustrated
 with the emotional response they're seeing,
 and it's even easy to just kind of wash your hands
 and go, well, we just don't get each other
 or all these, whatever we wanna do
 to kind of solidify our own viewpoint.
 But because folks on the other side of these,
 the election results on whichever side,
 because they matter, 'cause we love people's Christians,
 their emotional world has to matter.
 Even if we don't quite understand it,
 but because I value you, I value the experience
 that you're having in your emotional world.
 And I'm gonna try to understand as best I can
 and be gracious with it.
 While knowing, I'm not, it's not necessary,
 we completely agree with the level, the intensity,
 or even the nature of the emotion.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But we can have a discussion.
 I don't want to just tell people like,
 hey, stop doing that.
 Just grow up, man up, you know?
 But to give people, part of the conversation will be,
 not just here, let me give you a set of ideas
 and you won't feel that way anymore,
 'cause it actually doesn't work that way.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So you prioritize connection,
 and then sometimes connection builds a pathway for content.
 But if there's not a connection,
 then the content falls in deaf ears oftentimes.
  </li><li>Some of the stuff that we've heard is close to this.
 Its goal is to make the bad feelings go.
 It's to minimize it as quickly as possible.
 Yeah, and get me back to feeling safe.
 Where you've really taught us not to feel fearful
 and distress and to give us tools to communicate our hearts
 really, really well.
 There's two resources I really want our listeners to know
 about.
 The first is your DVD or MP3 or CD set.
 You get in three different flavors at Bethel's Resource Store
 called Brave Communication,
 which is how I actually first got introduced to you,
 which is how we ended up getting connected.
 It is, it's a brilliant overview.
 It's three sessions and in the first two sessions,
 you cover a lot of the brave communication material.
 You've expanded over the years, but excellent.
 The last session is you and Benning talking backwards
 and forwards unpacking in real time conversation.
 Some of the stuff you've already taught.
 It was a podcast before podcasts were invented.
 And it's great.
 You had your time.
 You really were.
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 If you haven't heard this teaching, guys,
 I can't recommend it enough.
 It's been pivotal for our culture and our community here
 at Grace Center.
 It's something we teach all of our students.
 And it's something that's really helped,
 AG&amp;I in our marriage and also as leaders with our staff.
 So I really wanna recommend that.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>And then you have a book coming out in May?
  </li><li>Yes, talk to us about the book.
  </li><li>It is like, as we were doing the school
 supernatural ministry, 'cause it's just been
 such a blessing, it's grown over the 18 years
 from 36 students to 2300 students.
  </li><li>Unbelievable.
 And just a wonderful privilege before the Lord to have these amazing people say, "I'm
 going to lay down my life for a year and come and be trained in this environment."
 So it's almost too good to be true.
 But we realized that a lot of was being caught in our environment, which is wonderful.
 But also the students couldn't quite articulate.
 It's so content heavy, you know, as well as joyful and as well as there's a great deal
 of momentum and affection in the environment.
 But it would be a little bit difficult to go home to your senior pastor, like, "What
 do you learn at that school?"
 It was just hard for them to articulate.
 So we thought we're going to lay these out in just simple core values.
 And so this is one of the things that's kind of gleaning the best of what Bill and Chris
 and Danny and Paul have been teaching.
 It's been scattered through our worship songs and our books and our sermons and our various
 schools.
 There's some of the essence in one place,
 make them really accessible.
 So it's like 13 different studies
 that you can journal through or use as a curriculum,
 use as a sermon starter.
 It's probably 52 weeks of sermons, you know,
 in here when you kind of,
 if you take each of the ideas and begin to read
 and study the scriptures on your own,
 look for your own testimonies and breakthrough there.
 And I think also a framework for thinking up
 some of the big systemic problems in our environment.
 So it's got the core values, number one, God is good.
 And number two is our salvation creates a joyful identity.
 I didn't really have the idea that salvation created an identity.
 I thought, just save me from sin.
 Let alone a joyful identity.
 That's now because I shake, rattle, and roll.
 So that's the joy component of it.
 And then that we're responsive to grace.
 You know, that the grace is a power to be transformed by God as well as his undeserved
 love.
 And part of the church is creating healthy families, focusing on his presence and just
 more and more, 13 of those different core values.
 So it's a chance to kind of have a thumbnail sketch of the incredible amount of content
 we pour out.
 That's brilliant.
 What's the name of the book?
 Kingdom Culture, Living the Values that Disciples the Nations.
 Sounds amazing.
 Wow.
 I'll try and find the link if it's not available.
 Yeah, maybe there's a pre-order page or put a link in the show notes and then I'll remind
 people when it comes out as well.
 Dan, thank you so much for coming and being on the podcast.
 It's been a huge privilege.
 It's a huge privilege just to get to know you and have you come out.
 every year for the last five years.
 It's we really look forward to it.
 But thank you.
 It's so fun for them to get to hear from you.
 So absolutely my pleasure.
 I enjoy my time out here so much.
 And then I agree with you.
 Thank you so much for being with us, not only at the school, but also our podcast.
 I'm wondering if I could ask you to pray and bless our listeners and then we'll release you.
 Yeah.
 Love to.
 So Heavenly Father, that's exactly who you are.
 You are Heavenly Daddy and you've given us identity.
 You've graciously brought us into your family.
 You teach us your ways and how to be part of your family.
 And not only that you give us grace to be able to cooperate with you
 and to help build a kingdom with you.
 So I'd ask for that grace to be poured out on all those that are listening
 and that there would be a in their in most being there would be a power
 loosed to be able to follow your spirit, enjoy your presence and to bring the kingdom
 to wherever they have a place of influence.
 And I bless them in the name of the Lord.
 Amen.
 Amen.
