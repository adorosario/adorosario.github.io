<p> I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones episode 247.<br/>
 Dear, yes.<br/>
 I'm a little bit excited.<br/>
 And so you must sing.<br/>
 You can't lock this up.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 I've tried.<br/>
 How the heck are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 How was vacation?<br/>
 Oh, well, it hasn't happened yet.<br/>
 Yeah, we're recording this episode before we go on podcast.
 Nope.<br/>
 We're recording this episode before we go on vacation, which you can tell me to vacation
 because we can't spoke proper.<br/>
 So we're going to pass over to future L&amp;AJ to find out how our vacation was.
 Oh, that's a good idea.<br/>
 We're back from Universal Studios.<br/>
 Disney. Oh, that's right. Disney completely forgot.
 I was like, wait, what are you talking about?
 We had an amazing time at Disney World with our kids.
 In fact, we had such a good time at Disney World.
 The next episode of the podcast is all going to be about our family trip to Disney World.
 Yeah. So you can skip it if you're not into hearing a family trip to Disney World,
 the get super nerdy and technical thanks to my wife,
 where we spent a lot of the episode<br/>
 protesting that we're not Disney nerds
 and then get fairly nerdy.
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, I don't remember me ever saying I wasn't a Disney nerd.
 I think you're the only one that's claimed that.
 Yeah, but I'm not a Disney nerd.
 Yes, yes, I had a wonderful time.
 It was so great.
 And we got hats, matching hats.
  </li><li>We did.
 On the very first day, I did an Instagram story about this,
 but on our very first day, we took our kids to buy,
 like, I don't know if that's our family tradition.
 We went and bought like Disney hats.
  </li><li>We always go and get a hat, yeah.
 Because of course, Florida, keep the sun off your head.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 And I found this Disney dad hat, and T.
 I found a Disney kid hat, and we searched high and low
 for a Disney mom hat, which we could not find.
 Right.
 And my first suspicion was, well, perhaps that's
 because Disney doesn't really like moms.
 Right, because most Disney characters,
 like most Disney princesses, don't have moms.
 Or if they do, they're evil stepmothers.
 Right.
 And if they had nice ones, they all died.
 And that's part of their story.
 Yes, that's right. The moms are dead.
 So try as we might.
 We couldn't find any.
 But undeterred, we eventually found one.
 In fact, we found eight, the eight remaining ones
 at Disney sold out online.
 There's only eight available Disney.
  </li><li>And then we spent like an hour driving around trying to,
 'cause the parks were closing,
 somebody in one of the stores helped us.
  </li><li>Yeah, they looked at the school
 and they said it's at this resort.
 So then we had to drive to the resort.
 They wouldn't let us in because we weren't resort guests.
  </li><li>So we had to sweet talk the parking person,
 security person and say,
 "Please, we're just trying to get this one hat."
 And anyway, he took my ID and all this stuff,
 and then we drove in,
 and it was the wrong contemporary resort.
 But they helped you do that.
  </li><li>Yeah, thanks for the woman there.
 She managed another store, and she said,
 "I know exactly where they are,
 and we have them, I'm gonna call my employee right now."
 And they put them aside, so we drove you further.
  </li><li>Yeah, to another place.
 The trouble is, my little ears, they often go back,
 so now look more like a rat.
  </li><li>Like a rat, or an angry mouse.
  </li><li>An angry mouse.
  </li><li>But we had a great time.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>You'll hear all about it next week.
  </li><li>Such a good time.
 Really, really fun.
  </li><li>Now back to past Alan and AJ.
  </li><li>See ya.
 (upbeat music)
  </li><li>Our main topic for this week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Comes from that beautiful list
 that our Instagram followers sent us
 about things they would like me to write a book on.
  </li><li>And we're running out of things on that list.
  </li><li>We are, so if we actually need some more topics sent in.
  </li><li>Yeah, we'll post something on Instagram
 and collect more topics to talk about.
 But we cheated, we said we'd write books about this so far,
 none of us have written any books,
 but you have provided us with the plethora of topics.
 The topic for this week is conversations
 that brought about more of God,
 or like more revelation of God, an aspect of God
 we didn't know about, or perhaps an aspect of ourselves,
 just general understanding that came out conversation.
 And I was thinking about that today.
 I was thinking in the Gospels,
 and I haven't done an exhaustive, like biblical study on this,
 But from memory, it would appear that there are far more conversations that Jesus had
 that were recorded than sermons that he preached.
 Yes, I would agree.
 And I was thinking about the power of transformation of a conversation, the intimate nature of
 a conversation.
 It's funny, we, Ajay and I had dinner a meal this week with some of our graduates.
 We were talking to them, we were literally having a conversation with them, and at one
 point they were like, "Wow, that's amazing."
 And I was like, which part is amazing?
 They're like that thing that you just said.
 I was like, I said, I'm not trying to shame you
 in asking my question, but I really am so curious to know
 that sounds like that that's new to you.
 But that's something we've talked like over and over again.
 You've been through the school for three years,
 like helped me understand.
 They said something fascinating, they said,
 there is a difference between being talked at
 and talked with.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I was like, oh, and I thought that dovetailed.
  </li><li>It does.
  </li><li>So nicely. - Perfectly.
 this topic this week.
 So we're just gonna talk about,
 like we sat down and we kind of reminisced a little bit
 about conversations that had really impacted us
 over the years.
 I will admit that I've got a little bit of
 pre-shame about this because I realized
 as I was thinking about the people we're gonna talk about,
 this could sound like one big name drop episode.
 And it's just the reality of our experience
 that God's been so gracious and connected us
 with some amazing people in the kingdom.
 And so as we walk down memory lane about conversations with so,
 so we're honestly not trying to name drop.
 We're just, yeah.
 Some of these people are in deep close relationships
 with some of these people just by the virtue
 of what we do, our paths have crossed.
 Yeah.
 But age of jumps, take it away,
 tell us about a conversation that you've had
 that has changed something about your walk with God.
 Well, I actually thought of one while I was putting
 on my lip gloss.
 And it was because I thought of a previous one
 that was in the same sort of format,
 but when we were youth leaders in Toronto,
 every once in a while,
 all the youth leaders would go over
 to John and Carol's house for night.
 And--
  </li><li>So, lying back the clock,
 how many years ago is this?
  </li><li>So long ago, so--
  </li><li>Come on, you're almost 50.
 How old were you when you were a youth leader?
  </li><li>Oh, 22, 23 in there.
  </li><li>So this is 28.
  </li><li>Yeah, like so--
  </li><li>Well, vintage.
  </li><li>Vintage.
  </li><li>Conversation.
  </li><li>Information.
 Take it away.
  </li><li>And there's, you know, these, both of these sort of nuggets
 happened in the same, you know, environment.
 I don't know if it was the same night or not,
 but it was in their living room,
 and which I remember was pink.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>I have no trouble believing that.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was pink.
 Anyway, so this first one, I remember, you know,
 some of our youth leaders were,
 well, I was an intense person,
 but I guess I was just intense about different things.
 but some of them are really intense about pre-tip,
 trip, post-trip, you know, all this kind of stuff.
 And really wanted to get into that with John.
 And John was, it was interesting 'cause I don't,
 I just remember him, he's like, you know what,
 I don't think I know the answer to that,
 but I think I'm just gonna live full on for God
 either way and not worry about it.
 Like, I mean, his encouragement was sort of like,
 I think we can spend so much time, so much time,
 I'll be fine, trying to know something
 and know it like, no, I know that I know.
 And he was like, it's kind of wasted energy.
 Live full on for God.
 Live loving him with everything that you have.
 Live like we're still gonna be here
 and if we're not great, but he's like,
 of course, I'd rather be taken up.
 but then who gets left here?
 So he sort of, but I just thought it cut across all of this like.
  </li><li>Need for an answer. - Need for an answer.
 Need to argue, need to be right, need to whatever.
 And he's just like, it doesn't actually matter.
 Live the same way.
  </li><li>Yeah. - You know?
 And I was just like.
  </li><li>Sounds like Fintish John.
  </li><li>Right, okay.
 And for me it was super helpful.
 I was like, oh yeah, I don't want to major on minor things.
 Like there's nothing I can do about that.
 No matter, it's not minor things.
  </li><li>How's the world there?
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, but I mean, I'm not gonna have influence
 over that, but I have an enormous amount of influence
 and responsibility over how I live.
 So for me, that was just like a super freeing kind of like,
 oh, and I think about it fairly often.
 I'm like, when I feel myself getting super aggravated
 about something, I'm like, in the end,
 does this actually matter in terms of,
 do I need to change how I'm living?
 you know, or is so, I don't know, that was one of the ones that came to me.
 You said it was a thought that, uh, followed up from a previous thought.
 Was there another, like while you were on a John and Carol over at their pink living
 room house, was there another moment that you thought of of a conversation?
 Oh yeah.
 We were talking about somebody that was sort of new to the youth leadership and didn't
 really know John and Carol as well as some of the rest of us did made a comment about,
 Hey, you guys are like the same sitting in your living room as you are standing on the
 platform. And they were, they both sort of laughed and, you know, gave him a nice smile
 and whatever. And he's like, yeah, you know, he's like, because it, you know, basically,
 we are the same people at home that we are at the grocery store that we are on the platform.
 It's not a show. It's us getting up and being who God's made us to be. And, you know, and
 hosting the presence of God, essentially. But like, it, he's hit, he even went so far
 to be like, I would be cautious about people that are different on the platform than they are
 off. Yeah. And so that was another thing that I sort of,
 to very early on before you even in a ministry, you're hearing that about you.
 Way before. Yeah. Way before. And it's, it has stuck with me like, oh yeah, like actually,
 how real is it if you're not the same person on the platform and off the platform? Like, you know,
 How true am I being to myself?
 Like am I trying to be a super me?
 Am I trying to fool somebody?
  </li><li>Especially when Paul says emulate me as I emulate Christ.
 Like which part of you should I emulate?
 The part I see on Sunday stage?
 Or how you are the rest of your week?
  </li><li>Right.
 So, and you know, of course John and Carol
 consistently demonstrated vulnerability and honesty
 and just being where they're at.
 And you know, I think it just really helped
 and setting me up well for ministry.
 Though at the time that they said it,
 I had no intention of going into ministry.
 I was like, but it's still, I retained it.
  </li><li>How long was it from those meetings
 before you did go in a ministry?
  </li><li>Oh, gosh, I don't even know.
 A couple of years at least, four, five maybe.
 Maybe even more than that.
  </li><li>Yeah, it sounds like more.
 Like you were 22, when did you start going in a ministry?
  </li><li>Well, I don't know if I'm trying to remember like,
 so they did these for a while.
 So I'm not really sure which one of them. Yeah, which which one of them it was and I'm trying to remember which building we were in
 Because I don't think it was the old building and the old building is when I had that whole
 and counter with James Riles speaking and
 Realized I and the Lord was like no you're going into ministry doesn't count because James Riles I wasn't a conversation
 That was a mess. I know but I'm saying I'm trying to track it like you're trying to carbon date yourself
 from the message. And I can't remember. So I was thinking, and it was perhaps just because
 I was hanging out with Gary last night and the night before. So our friend Gary Morgan,
 you met Gary before I ever did. Yeah. You did a conference with him in London. Yeah. And
 John Mark McMillan. Yeah. And none of us knew each other. The three of you did that conference
 together. You came home, you said, Oh, you've got to meet this guy. Yeah. I met maybe six
 months after that. Yeah. But that. And I met him in Wales. And Gary was the
 the first person I had ever met who was,
 I don't know if he was the first person
 I'd ever met who was a prophet.
 I'd met a couple of prophets before.
 But he was the first person I'd ever met
 who was confident that he was a prophet
 and not enamored with the fact that he was a prophet.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like being a prophet was no more significant
 to him than being a male or being Welsh.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like, or having two eyes.
  </li><li>It just is what it is.
  </li><li>Like the most natural thing.
 And I was so astonished to be around somebody.
 A with such an astonishing gift.
 And B, this kind of ease with having that gift.
 And I remember meeting him,
 and I remember we hung out the whole day.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh,
 you guys talked like Chipmunks on speed in the back seat.
  </li><li>Yeah, I just peppered him with every single question
 I ever wanted to ever ask a prophet.
 And I was amazed by the answers.
 I remember asking him,
 "So Gary, you know your prophet."
 And he's like, "Yeah."
 I was like, "And do you know this fear
 "to what you're called?"
 And he's like, "Yeah."
 I said, "Do you know that you're called as a prophet to the nations?"
 And he's like, "Yeah."
 And I was like, "But you haven't left Wales."
 Right.
 Right. So how do you reconcile that?
 And he's like, "Well, that's what I'm called to.
 I'm not there yet."
 And I couldn't get over the fact that he wasn't being bragadocious.
 He wasn't interested in him being a prophet.
 And yet he was also happy to talk about it.
 It was just this really surreal mix.
 Yeah.
 It was like I was an alien from another planet and going like,
 so you have two arms and like you have degrees of motion.
 That's a man.
 How does that work?
 And they go up and down and, you know,
 he was fine to entertain this alien species who's fascinated by the limbs of this other race.
 That's what it was like with his gift.
 And I just remember asking him all these because at that time,
 I was having these kind of emerging prophetic experiences encounters.
 I don't really have any profits around me to help me understand what was happening.
 I just remember every question I threw at him,
 which were admitted like somewhat weird.
 He wasn't phased by and he was so kind and calm to just answer them and didn't
 seem frustrated or bothered by the fact that I was just peppering him with questions.
 And I think the takeaway from me, the bit that that revealed more about God to me
 was how come this kid, because I don't know how old he was, young, young is so
 settled and confident in who he is and what he's called to. And I'm not. And yeah, I'm
 not short of revelation because I've got lots of stuff that God's told me I am and what
 I'm called to, but none of it settled in my heart. And I was really struck by the peace
 that he had and I was the peace that he had the power that he ministered in. Yeah. Which
 to this day hasn't faded. Like, you know, every time I talk to him, he's got a testimony
 of some of God's do. I love that. But that was one of the first conversations I ever
 had with somebody who was confident in who they were. And it didn't feel like a Dollar
 Tree or didn't feel like it had to, you know, you have to recognize me as a prophet. Like
 he just didn't, he just didn't, like, I don't want to go and go, you have to accept me as
 a man. Right. Like that just, I just got on with my life with being a man. It's not something
 I think about. And that's what it was like being around this prophet with an extraordinary
 gift to knew the secrets of people's hearts and was just one man walking revelation.
 Yeah.
 Like all the time.
 Yeah.
 So all right, you do one.
 Okay.
 I was trying to think I thought of a bunch like we were thinking about like when we were
 talking about it beforehand, you were saying babe, like think about different people that
 have impacted your life.
 And you said something about Patricia King and I thought gosh, I've had like a series
 of, you know, I have definitely been impacted by her teaching, but much more by conversations,
 just, you know, over food, where she has said something that maybe isn't even that big,
 but has landed as like a, oh,
 could you add like a 20 year friendship with her?
 Yes. Yeah. And tell us some of them.
 Well, I was thinking when I first felt like, oh, you know, the Lord had called me into ministry and whatnot.
 And I had done this deliverance school with her.
 So she had come and taught this like three weeks school and there was about 25 of us on it.
 It was pretty intense and it was epic.
 But at the end, we were all going to have these deliverance sessions, like two hour sessions with her or a couple of her different team members.
 And so I remember going into that and she just said,
 I think the Lord has said that we're not doing deliverance.
 I'm calling you to life.
 And so she spent like literally the whole session
 just calling me to life prophetically
 and all this kind of stuff.
 And so then after that, she had said,
 whenever I'm in the same town as you, let's have food,
 which she was super consistent and reaching out and saying,
 hey, I'm coming in.
 Do you want to get together?
 Hey, whatever.
 And so like some of those conversations were things like,
 I remember having breakfast with her and Ron one morning.
  </li><li>Ron's her husband.
  </li><li>Ron's her husband.
 And he's like, he's quite quiet and Patricia's quite not.
 I mean, she's not loud, but you know, like she can be.
 Anyway, we're in this mice restaurant
 with white tablecloths and whatever.
 And I had been in this season
 where I was studying all of God's generals.
 And so I was reading everything I could about, you know, all these different things.
 And I had felt like the Lord was talking to me and saying, you are like an Amy
 simple McPherson, like you're going to carry the presence of God.
 You're going to preach.
 You're going to whatever.
 And I wasn't doing a ton of that at this point.
 You know, and, and so just paint the picture for everybody.
 What were you doing?
 You were in middle management and the car rental company.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So you're not in ministry.
 You're just now.
 No, not really.
 I'm, I'm serving anywhere I can in the church.
 You know, I'm a youth leader and you have a regular job.
 regular job. Yep. So, being on the ministry team, you know, just that kind of stuff. Anyway,
 so we're having this nice breakfast and talking about, you know, what's God talking to you about
 and I was like, oh, you know, because Patricia's amazing at asking questions. But anyway, I was
 like, oh, yeah, talking to me about Amy, Simple McPherson, I felt like the Lord said this and
 whatever. And she was like immediately like, yes. And she was actually my great aunt and I went
 to my uncle. I might be getting the wrong. She might be great, great aunt or something like that.
 But she went to the son of Amy Simple McPherson, who is a family member of hers and said,
 "I want her mantle. I want you to pray her mantle on me since nobody's picked it up."
 And so she's telling me this and she's super excited. And again, it's a really quiet restaurant
 with white tablecloths. And then she just stood up and she's like, "And I am going to pray her
 mantle onto you and then she just stood behind me and just started praying like super loud.
 And I thought, like everybody's looking at us and I literally remember thinking, okay,
 I have a choice right now.
 I'm either going to worry about what everybody else in this room is thinking or I'm going
 to receive something really great.
 And so I remember just being like, all right, let's do this.
 And Ron just kept eating and just sort of smiled.
 That's the moment when conversations turn to ministry time.
 It was interesting.
 And then she just sat down and we just kept talking and there's several like that.
 Yeah, there was also the one, and I think we've shared about it on the podcast before,
 but when I was going through this whole thing of being called as a prophet,
 like meeting with her for lunch and her just sitting there and telling me her story and
 of being called as a prophet and then she basically was like, you know,
 "Well, give that story in a nutshell." So then her story in a nutshell was that she
 could prophesy, obviously, and she'd received this prophetic word as being
 by a recognized prophet saying, "You are called as a prophet." And so she had decided,
 she'd been invited to travel with some big minister in Europe. And so she was going to go
 as the prophet and prophet's eye and she said, you know, AJ, the whole time that I'm traveling
 with this guy is like, for the first five weeks, I'm getting nothing, like nothing.
 And they end up at the church where this prophet is that called her out. And so she's like,
 can I talk to you? And so she says, you know, you gave me this word and, you know, I haven't
 been able to get anything and I want to go home and whatever. And basically that, that
 that man had said, well, that's because you haven't actually agreed with the word.
 Like, you're still not, you know, you're not saying yes, basically.
 And so she had said that profit guy was like, Patricia, you're not leaving this room until
 I hear you say I am a prophet.
 And so we were talking about that because I was talking to her about how I felt like,
 oh, it's super presumptuous.
 Like, yes, I have had several different profits call me out.
  </li><li>Many. - Many, many.
 But still like, oh, it's so presumptuous.
 I don't wanna say that.
 It looks bad.
 It looks like I'm looking for something.
 So I was like a fair amount of fear of man
 and all that kind of stuff.
 Anyway, so she told me that story and I was like,
 wow, that's intense.
 And she's like, yeah, and he didn't let me leave.
 And like, right at the meeting is about to start.
 And I'm saying, I gotta go.
 And he's like, and you're not leaving this room
 until you say, you know, whatever.
 And she's like, and I said it,
 and then something shifted and I went out
 and you know whatever, I was like, oh, that's so great.
 And we needed to leave to go to the airport.
 Ron was driving me to the airport.
 And so I was like, well, I'm so encouraged.
 Thank you.
 That's a great story for you.
 Because I wanted-- like, I came to sort of share and say,
 here's all these different people that have called me.
 I was a prophet.
 What do you think?
 Kind of half thinking she'd go, yeah,
 I think they've missed it.
 And then I could go, oh, yeah, good.
 So yeah.
 So she said, yeah, you're not leaving until you say you're a prophet.
 And I was, and I'm literally like, we should have left 20 minutes ago.
 I got to get to the Phoenix airport, you know, kind of thing.
 And I was like, uh, you know, and, and I just started crying.
 Cause I was like, anyway, so I eventually did say it.
 And she goes, yeah, you're going to need to say that louder.
 So, and there's some other prophet guy who's from Canada.
 And I can't for the life of me remember his name, but he was really lovely.
 sitting there and he's like, "Yep, it's gonna need to be louder. Set it again."
 And then the third time that I set it, I felt like I heard a balloon pop right
 behind my head. And as soon as I heard this balloon pop, which where she goes,
 "You're good. You need to get to the airport." Ron just drives me to the
 airport and I was like, "That was so weird." But she's been one of those people
 where it's been conversation at pivotal moments in time. Like she's why we
 started looking at creating things as schools as opposed to random weekends
 because she was like hey you can just build much more on it I encourage you to
 put your material into like little mini schools for weekends and whatever so
 yeah I mean there was she's done a lot of shifting just through conversation.
  </li><li>Oh for us yeah we've talked many times about the prophetic word and I don't want
 to veer into that because it's a prophetic word rather than conversation
 but she's been hugely influential in shifting seasons in our life.
 Yeah.
 On the topic of prophets, this is somebody we didn't know, didn't know well at all, but
 we had the privilege of hearing and sharing some dinners with and our paths crossed as
 John Paul Jackson.
 Yes.
 So John Paul Jackson, one of my favorite prophets, now with the Lord, died a number of years
 ago and hugely influential on me.
 He was the first prophet I ever heard that could teach.
 And so largely what I learned about prophetic ministry in Scotland was that he was a great
 from John Paul Jackson. I just order his tapes and listen to it and hit the most outrageous
 stories. But he became friends with a pastor in Scotland in Edinburgh. And he'd often come
 through. I didn't know the pastor, but I'd go to the church or I'd go to the conference
 and I'd hear him and this particular story I got to speak to him while I was in Scotland
 after a message. And a couple of weeks before John Paul came to this church, I have a dream.
 And this is probably right at the cusp of me beginning to have dreams and thinking,
 do I actually hear from God in dreams or am I making this up?
 Or am I just listening to all this stuff
 and I want to be super spiritual, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 And so I have this dream and in the dream,
 what was really significant is I meet John Paul Jackson.
 And John Paul Jackson and I are on a train together.
 John Paul has this beautiful thick, luscious silver beard,
 which he didn't at the time, he was completely
 in shaving.
 And he wrapped my left foot in silver duct tape.
 And I forget how many times it was.
 I remember how many times he wrapped it.
 And he speaks to me in the dream and gets off the train.
 And this big, thick dream.
 And I'm like, I've got no understanding
 about how to do dream interpretation.
 And so it happens, he's in my city.
 He's speaking at a conference.
 I go listen to the conference.
 And at the end, I go up to him.
 And I just say, hey, John Paul, I said,
 I'm sure you get people coming up to you all the time
 about dreams.
 I said, but here's what's crazy.
 I said, I had a dream a couple of weeks ago
 that you had a thick, luscious silver beard.
 And what do you know?
 He's now sporting a thick, luscious silver beard.
 And he starts laughing.
 He said, yeah, he said, I started growing this
 like a couple of weeks ago.
 Like that, you know, that's crazy.
 And so I tell him the dream,
 and he interprets the dream for me.
 He says, yeah, this is what the dream means.
 And he talks about, you know, your soul,
 the left soul is like your soul
 and the silver, the silver tape is all about redemption.
 And just starts unpacking this dream in ways that I'd never,
 well, I didn't know anything
 about dream interpretation at the time.
 And that one little conversation really shifted something for me
 and that yeah, like I do hear from God.
 And I don't want to say since then,
 but a remarkable thread of my dreams is that prophets frequently show up in my dreams.
 Like just this week, last week I had a dream.
 We were all staying at Prophet's house and, you know, he ministered to me.
 And John Paul would frequently show up in my dreams.
 And I, you know, that was a simple conversation.
 lasted maybe two, three minutes.
 There wasn't of any depth.
 I doubt he ever remembered it,
 but it was a pivotal nudge from the Lord.
 Like, yeah, see, you do hear from God.
  </li><li>That's so cool.
 We'll have another John Paul Jackson.
  </li><li>Tell me your other John Paul Jackson.
  </li><li>Well, I was thinking about one of the times
 that he came to Toronto.
 And we just ended up, I don't remember what,
 we were like the only people in the green room
 with him for some reason.
 We had dinner with him and a bunch of our staff at the time and then they
 They left and then it was just the three of us in the green room
 Yeah, so we were just chatting and you actually were the one that was like babe tell them about your dreams because
 I am an unusual dreamer for the most part. I very rarely dream dreams that require interpretation
 They tend to be fairly literal
 Or very literal very literal very literal. Yes, you don't have dreams and you're no use to me when I tell you my dreams
 You know, so the Lord, I mean, he's wise,
 he gives me literal dreams, that's lovely.
 But I also have dreams where I'm really just in what feels
 like a dark room, not scary dark,
 but just there's, I can't see anything.
 And I'm having an audible conversation with the Lord.
  </li><li>Well, you describe it as you're in a dream,
 but you're fully awake.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So you know you're in a dream
 'cause you've gone to bed and you fall asleep.
  </li><li>And I'm literally like, oh, I'm dreaming.
 Oh, I'm in that room again.
  </li><li>If you're up.
 Yeah, that's a dark room and you speak audibly to God. Yeah, and he speaks back and we have conversations and then I wake up
 Yeah, yeah
 Everybody else super frustrated by those dreams meanwhile I have John Paul Jackson with a beard on a roll of duct tape
 Taping up my left foot and it means something
 But I you know anyway, so we were like
 Explaining and he's like yeah, the other ones the other literal dreams and then he was talking about those ones
 And he said we would call those visitations of the night. Yeah, he said though
 Oh, those aren't dreams. Yeah, those aren't dreams those are visitation of the night
 Like casually.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like no, no, that's not a sausage.
 That's a taco.
 And you're like, oh.
  </li><li>Oh, I need to eat it.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>But that's the situation tonight, okay.
  </li><li>So that was another one that was like, oh.
  </li><li>What did that do for you in terms of shifting that?
 Like having that terminology is helpful,
 but what else did it do?
  </li><li>Well, I think it just gave me an enormous amount of peace
 because I didn't know anybody else that was receiving,
 or having dreams like that.
 So, and I would always just say, oh yeah, I had another one of those dreams, you know,
 where I'm in a dark room and the, you know, and I always, I felt a little weird.
 Yeah, but I'm curious about like basically all, I don't mean to demean this, but all that change
 was the name used for it is different. And yet it felt more than just learning a new piece of
 vocabulary. It felt like something shifted for you. I think, yes, because, well,
 Visitations of the night.
 Well, it's, I think because it was this guy who was like the dream guru who didn't
 use what guru dream expert who didn't think it was weird.
 Who didn't, you know, it didn't face him.
 He was like, Oh yeah, that's not a dream.
 That's a visitation of the night.
 But it wasn't like he was like, and now we should send you to the deliverance team or, you know, whatever.
 So I think there was just a huge amount of peace on.
 Okay, I, because usually I just didn't talk about those.
 Right.
 Because it felt odd.
 Yeah.
 And people didn't have really a grid for that.
 So I just was like, think I'll just not.
 Hmm.
 God bless John Paul Jackson.
 What a gift.
 What a gift that man was.
 Sure.
 Moving away from the prophetic.
 I remember, I tell the story when we teach on boundaries and it, it, it happened
 on the Monday following the worst fight that we have ever had to date.
 I think.
 Okay.
 Do you remember the one I'm talking about?
 I don't know which one we're talking about.
 We've only had like a couple that are like bad.
 This is on the 407.
 I commanded you to pull over and I was going to walk home.
 Do you remember that?
 No.
 Oh, come on.
 Let me tell me.
 Let me tell you.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So I've told the story before and so let me set up the preamble.
 Then I'll tell you about the conversation that changed everything.
 The preamble is age and I, the season of our life travel for a living.
 We would come home, we're exhausted.
 We've got a day off.
 It's a Saturday.
 We're both high planners.
 And so without communicating, this is like early on in our marriage.
 So probably our first year of marriage.
 Yeah, it would be a first year marriage.
 And I wake up and think, great, I've got the whole day to just stay home and video
 edit.
 And I was thinking of this in the bathroom.
 Go ahead.
 I know what you're talking about.
 And AJ's thinking, Oh, this is so exciting.
 I'm going to go to the mall and me and Alan are going to have a great day.
 And so we've both instantly made a plan without communicating it to each other.
 And so when AJ shares her plan with me, she doesn't realize it cuts straight across
 my plan and I can't believe how insensitive she is violating the plan I haven't
 communicated to her. So already there's like some cross talk.
 And so then we compromise.
 AJ says, well, honey, why don't the two of us high quality time?
 This is before I was high quality time.
 Why don't the two of us go them all?
 We just got to spend some time together.
 And then, you know, we can come home.
 You can have all afternoon and all evening to yourself.
 So just play with your computer or do some video editing.
 And I was like, actually, that sounds great because the mall has an Apple store.
 Yeah, and a Starbucks.
 So let's do that.
 And so we go out to the mall.
 We have a great, we have a great time.
 It's about 30 minutes from our house, 40 minutes from our house.
 Yeah, about that.
 And we were on the 400 and the four seven.
 That's where you lost me.
 Oh, isn't the four seven of the transponder?
 It's the three.
 But we worked on that.
 We were on the 400.
 All right.
 So anyway, we get them all and you know, we're just great and we're leaving them all.
 And who do we bump into, but AJ's cousins?
 And if you know AJ's story, her cousins are hugely important to her.
 And, you know, we've been traveling.
 We haven't seen them forever.
 And so, you know, her cousins stop her.
 They're so excited to see her.
 The cousins are just putting a pool in their backyard.
 They're like 10 minutes from them all.
 You're going to be more like half an hour.
 OK, well, close by.
 Yeah, they're nearby the mall.
 Toronto, that's pretty close.
 Yeah.
 And so they're just like, well, when you come over, the kids would love to see you.
 ages nieces and I'm looking at AJ thinking of course,
 ages are going to say, oh, guys, we'd love to, but we've already made plans.
 But instead AJ looks at me like, can we, can we, can we?
 And I'm blinking her a message like, no, we blinking well, can't,
 because we already made plans to go home.
 And I can't even believe we're putting me in this awkward position.
 And so being the powerful, boundary, full man that I am, I just said, sure.
 But in my head, I'm in a heck no.
 And my mouth is like, yeah, that would be great.
 And so we then go our separate ways and we drive over
 and the whole way over to the cousins.
 I take the really mature response of just shutting down
 and just shunning AJ because she jolly well knows
 what she's done wrong and she needs to be punished
 with my silence.
 So I'm furious because this woman that God put with me
 broke her word, completely shafted the plans that we had
 and now I don't get to be on my own in a dark basement
 playing video games and I can't believe how selfish she is.
 I'd like to repent for just a second.
 This part of the story was on the 407.
 OK.
 Yeah.
 So if this is when you were mad enough to get out,
 this was on the
 This was on the way home that we were so mad.
 We are like, it just escalated.
 And so, you know, ages doing the baby.
 You're OK, you know, and I'm doing the if you have to ask, you know, then there's
 no point me even explaining like just real mature, healthy communication, all
 that sort of stuff.
 And so then, you know, to make things worse, we get there and I just turn on the smiles
 and everything's OK.
 And I'm schmoozing with the nieces and throwing them in the pool and we're
 having a great time and I'm just biting the time till we can leave.
 And then when we leave on the way home, that's when I just kind of like unleash
 all this torn by I can't believe blah blah blah blah.
 You know, I'm just total victim.
 Like I can't believe how horrible you are.
 And you're blah blah blah blah.
 And anyway, our fight was getting so bad that I remember,
 you know, you pulled over.
 I didn't ask you to pull over.
 You pulled over and just said,
 "Goo!"
 And I was like, "Viren!"
 And so I get out the car and then I'm thinking,
 "I'm gonna walk home."
 Which is hysterical because I have no sense of direction.
 And I'm on a, you know, I don't know,
 like an eight lane freeway in the middle of like,
 greater Toronto area.
 And I don't even know which way is north.
 Or if that would even help me because I don't know if I live north of where I am right now.
 And, you know, we, we are screaming on the side of the highway each other.
 I don't remember this one at all.
 Yeah, you don't remember?
 Uh-uh.
 Then we get home and we're just fuming and I'm thinking like, you know,
 I know that this isn't ideal, but like if I had to weigh up who was at fault,
 it's probably 80% age eight and 20% me.
 And like, yeah, did I react unkindly?
 I did, but it's only because she was so mean.
 like, so I'm in just total victim mindset.
 And so we think we need to speak to our friends, Gordon and Kathy,
 who are pastors in Toronto and friends of ours.
 So I remember Monday, we booked an appointment like, hey, you know,
 because we go to church Sunday and it's frosty and it's hostile.
 And we speak to Gordon and Kathy is like, you know, sorry,
 we're coming to you tomorrow.
 So it's Monday afternoon, we go into Kathy's office in Gordon and Kathy
 or with us and it is a conversation.
 And they're like, tell us the story.
 And so I tell the story, albeit less humorously, without owning any of it.
 you know, like I tacitly nodded.
 You could tell where the story is going here,
 but at the point it was like all her fault.
 And so I'm telling the story and, you know, I finish.
 And Kathy says, "Oh, I see, I get the problem."
 That's really helpful, I get the problem.
 And the problem is that you gave away your afternoon.
 And she says that to me and I'm like,
 "No, the problem is she stole our afternoon."
 And she's like, "No, because the way you told it,
 She asked you, "Hey babe, can we go?"
 And I was like, "Yeah!"
 And she knew that we already had a plan.
 And she's like, "Yeah, but it sounds like she was asking you
 to alter the plan."
 And then it sounds like you gave a powerful, "Yes babe,
 let's do that."
 But in your heart, you meant,
 "No, I don't want to do that.
 Can we please uphold our boundaries?"
 And I'm like, "Exactly!"
 And she didn't pick up the cue.
 She's like, "Oh, so the problem is your wife
 isn't a mind reader."
 The notion that somehow in that story,
 I was to blame,
 was hitherto like impossible.
 And it's only 'cause I have such value
 and trust for Gordon and Kathy.
 I could not see how I was at fault in that story.
 I was literally expecting them to lambast you
 and then you would go, babe, I'm so sorry.
 I really did deserve you, you know,
 going up one side of me and down the other
 and yelling at me and, you know,
 you're absolutely the right answer.
 I was shocked that I was to blame for that, you know,
 And it really shifted something about like, wow,
 how powerless am I in my relationships?
 Like how much is it that I've got a revelation
 that I expect you to all have to
 and abide by my understanding of something?
 Oh, you expect me to actually speak up and use my voice?
 Like, and it occurred to me.
 And so that was a pivotal.
 I did not like that conversation at all.
 And then, oh my gosh, talk about life,
 giving and life changing.
  </li><li>So do you remember that?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Now?
  </li><li>I remember sitting down with Gordon and Kathy.
 I don't remember the yelling on the side of the highway.
 I don't remember that at all.
 Maybe I blocked it out.
 Maybe I had to go get the worst conversation.
  </li><li>The MDR or something, maybe.
  </li><li>What do you remember about Gordon and Kathy's conversation?
 Like was that clearly that conversation was pivotal to me
 and really changed that way in order?
  </li><li>I remember going in and you,
 I remember you looking at me like you're about to,
 you know?
  </li><li>Oh, you're gonna get out.
  </li><li>You're about to hear how bad you've just been.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I thought, oh gosh, I'm about to hear how bad I've just been, you know, kind of thing.
 Because really you told the story.
 I didn't even, you had, you had so much passion to be heard.
 Passion to be heard.
 And I remember just like, again, when Kathy went, oh, actually, you know, basically you're
 the problem.
 I was like, oh, oh, oh, what was that?
 What was that?
 I think I was like, I didn't know what was happening.
 You know, like I remember being like,
 I don't know why we're this mad about like,
 it seemed such an enormous reaction.
 And I didn't understand your behavior.
 Like I couldn't.
 And so I'm like, I mean, even if we'd gone in
 and they'd been like, yeah, AJ, blah, blah, blah.
 I would have wanted to work on whatever,
 but I remember just the relief of like, oh good.
 Oh, I didn't cause the last two days of, you know,
  </li><li>Exhale. - Adious behavior.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>So bad. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, thanks Gordon and Kathy
 for changing the course of our lives in our marriage.
  </li><li>I remember another conversation or story.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>From another fight. - Yeah.
  </li><li>So this was the one where...
  </li><li>Please let it be the one where you wanted
 to poop in my shoes. - That's one.
  </li><li>Okay, great.
  </li><li>I think I wanted to pee in your shoes.
  </li><li>Okay, well, oh, that's so much better.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I had a friend who heard that podcast
 and they're like, "If you wanted to know how to pee
 "in some shoes, let me know and I can actually show you."
 I could do that, which may be that.
 But anyway, so I was very pregnant with Tia.
 I don't know how pregnant, seven, eight months pregnant.
  </li><li>We lived in our old old house.
  </li><li>Lived in our, the first house that we lived
 when we moved to Franklin.
 And there were lots of stress.
 So that era is marked by so much stress.
 Not that the excuse is anything that happens next
 and how unreasonable you were,
 but you know, pregnancy just locked your hormones.
 So I understand.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
 And I still don't remember what we were fighting about.
  </li><li>Isn't that funny now, do I?
  </li><li>I, but I remember being furious
 and I remember turning around in the kitchen
 and looking and saying, "Get out!"
 Like, "Get out of the house!"
 And you were like, fine.
 And you left and drove away in our minivan.
 Yes.
 And then well, now you pick it up with your.
 Well, I remember I remember driving along highway 96.
 And by the way, as bad as this is, it still wasn't as bad as the fight that we
 just talked about, at least in my head and the ranking.
 Yeah, no way.
 And I think in, you know, that woman on supper ball and I'm thinking about
 peeing in your shoes while you're gone.
 I'm so mad.
 Yeah.
 The woman that God put me with like, you know, God, like that woman is like, and
 I'm thinking I'm gonna punish you with silence.
 And that's where I'm thinking I'm just gonna get hotel
 for the man and not come home and not tell you where I am.
 This is pretty like iPhone find my friends.
 You wouldn't know where I am.
 You're gonna be worried, sick about me.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>I'm gonna show you.
 And the Holy Spirit's like,
 "Ah, it's a great plan.
 "How are you gonna afford that?"
 And I was like, "What?"
 He's like, "You can't even afford the Starbucks
 "that you're driving to."
 Like, 'cause I was gonna drive the store.
  </li><li>We have no money.
  </li><li>No money, like no expendable income.
 He's like, "So where are you gonna stay?
 "Like, how is this gonna work?"
 And I was like, dang, like, foiled again finances.
 I can't punish my wife.
 And so I drove to Starbucks and sat in the car park,
 didn't order anything due to the aforementioned no money.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And then you decided to phone Jeff.
  </li><li>Well, didn't you phone Jeff?
 I know I did, I remember phoneing Jeff.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I just had buddy, like, you know, I just,
 I need some help.
 Like I need my pastor and he's like, what's going on?
 And I just told him, I said, I just had this huge fight
 with AJ. And, you know, and here's what's happened. Like, this is growth from Gordon
 and Kathy. Yeah. You know, I wasn't blaming you. I just said, we just had this amazing
 fight, not amazing horrible fight. I'm sitting in the parking lot. I don't want to go home.
 I'm so mad at her. I don't think she wants me to come home. She told me to get out and
 Jess just like quiet, like, you know, and then he just humorously just says he said to Alan,
 you know, like, would you rather be right or would you rather have a relationship? And
 I'm like, I'd rather be right. He's like, let me, let me ask that again. Would you rather
 be right or have a relationship because the truth is he who apologizes first wins.
 Yeah, that's what he said.
 And I'm like, I don't even know why I have to apologize for she's the one that kicked
 me out. And he's like, yeah, I bet if you sit with the Holy Spirit for a little bit longer,
 you can probably find one thing you need to apologize for.
 Yeah.
 And then I just remember, because to this day, I can't remember what the fight is.
 How funny is that so funny, but I still remember those two statements. Would you rather be
 right or have a relationship? Like, would you rather sit there in your rightness or would
 you rather go have the conversation that needs to be had and own and work it through.
 And then what was the second thing that you just said?
 He apologized first wins.
 Yeah, I was just like, oh, and that's, I mean, that's now stuck with me for 12 years.
 Can't remember what the fight was about.
 Do you remember becoming home?
 I remember the slow drive back.
 I mean, it's like the court of a mile part of the slow drive.
 But I remember driving back to our neighborhood, like it's literally a straight line.
 Yeah.
 just thinking, like how you're going to know I'm coming in the house because you're going
 to hear the car, you're going to hear the garage door, you're going to hear me coming
 up the stairs, what am I going to be greeted with?
 And you know, I'm going to apologize, but I'm hard.
 So I hope she apologizes to, you know, like, you know, when you're armed, not, you know,
 you're armed with an apology.
 Yeah, I'm going to apologize, but you better apologize to you.
 Yeah.
 Do you remember how that got resolved?
 Uh-uh.
 Do you?
 Nope.
 Not at all.
 I don't either.
 That was the funniest thing ever.
 And thought, don't laugh, don't laugh.
 Like this is not the time it laughs.
 She is heavily pregnant.
  </li><li>I think I was crying a lot.
 Well, maybe that's why I couldn't figure it out.
 At a pea in your shoes, I was heavily pregnant.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>All right, so about that,
 I was thinking of a conversation.
  </li><li>She peeing away.
  </li><li>Well, no, I was thinking about like,
 it's so funny that in the first instance,
 I can remember exactly what our fight was.
 And your recollection was, man,
 that reaction seemed way too big.
 And then the second story that we just told about that fight,
 which neither of us can remember what it was about.
 So it kind of been that significant.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>I was thinking about something we already knew.
 Like John and Carol taught us this.
 That if the reaction is larger than the event warrants,
 the issue is not the issue.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 A chip would say you just went home, right?
  </li><li>That's what I was gonna tell.
 I was thinking about a conversation that we had with Chip
 where Chip said exactly that.
 Like anytime that your reaction is larger
 on the event warrants. Yeah, you've gone home. Yeah. As in what you're reacting to. So if you think
 about that situation, me reacting about having to go to an outdoor swimming pool and spend some
 quality time with my nieces for like an hour, instead of being able to go home as the plan was,
 my reaction now I know, then I didn't was about like being betrayed by you. That word betrayed
 is so big. Okay. So I've gone home. What does chip me in my go home? He's like, it's all about
 your childhood experiences. Yeah. Well, the probably the defining characteristic of my childhood was
 I was not in control of how my time was spent. My mother got, you know, not a criticism against
 my mother here at all, but my mother high influence or high, you know, museums are good for you,
 walks are good for you. You know, you should be social. So let's be, you know, let's arrange family
 walks and get togethers and go be with your friends and do anything but be indoors and play
 play on video games, which is hard when you're emerging nerd.
 Right.
 That's just, I'm re that whole thing of like, you're still
 a man not having my time valued or me not having time to be at home
 with computers and video or having a voice or having a
 voice.
 It was just my childhood story.
 Like, and the primary woman in my childhood didn't honor my, I
 don't want to do that.
 I would rather do something else that has no value in your eyes.
 And now the primary woman in my life is blocking the same goal.
 Of course you aren't, but the story is so familiar.
 You know, and I basically had a grown up temper tantrum.
 What happened?
 I went home.
 Yeah.
 So even having that insight from Chip and from the guys at
 Seich Hill is like, Oh, okay, like that's that's pivotal.
 Yeah.
 So on the topic of Seich Hill, I remember one of my group leaders,
 Dane, him sharing, you know, he, I remember him listening to
 listening to me, like in distress and bravura.
 And with this conversation, it's just like,
 Alan, are you aware of how much oppositional energy
 you expend on a daily basis?
 And I was like, well, first of all,
 I'd need a definition of oppositional energy
 to understand.
 He said, are you aware of like, how much intention,
 how much effort, how much energy you're spending
 to not be something?
 And I was like, I'm not.
 Like, he said, I just listened to the way you talk.
 like you are so crafting your time, your speech,
 your energy, your interactions to not be like leaders
 you know who have hurt other people
 or authority figures who have hurt you
 or to not repeat the behavior of people that hurt you.
 All of your focus is on not being something
 and I'm watching how exhausting and draining that would be
 and what would it be like for you to instead
 of allocating all that energy to opposition,
 I won't be like this,
 to actually just being who God's created you to be.
 It was like, I literally have,
 A, didn't realize I was doing that.
 B, literally, that makes so much sense.
 And oh my gosh, now that you've said that
 I can absolutely see how much of my motivation
 is not to become this person or not.
 Now, if you think about it,
 all that energy is fueled by judgment.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, hopefully like wise judgment,
 like, you know, like, do I think Hitler behaved well?
 No, he did not.
 Do I want to be like Hitler?
 No, I do.
 I mean, like that's a judgment, but you scale it down
 and you're just like, okay, I don't want to be like this
 person, that person, that person, that person.
  </li><li>Right, right, right.
  </li><li>And so now you're navigating your behavior
 through a checklist rather than just living
 and staying in step with the Holy Spirit.
 And that was a conversation that really helped me understand,
 you know, I sat with that a little bit like,
 Lord, what is it that is not allowing me to actually trust
 that you'll lead me into paths of righteousness?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Lead me along paths of righteousness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I'm actually, you know, like, which path we're going in?
 You know, is it better to go here?
 'Cause that path could look too similar, like, you know,
 the path that this person took.
 And anyway, oppositional energy,
 that was an eye opening thing for me.
 And as I've sat with that, I am aware,
 not only how much I exercise oppositional energy,
 but as I'm with people I'm mentoring and helping,
 I'm realizing how much we all don't know
 if it's a human condition to not be something,
 rather than the purpose to be who we are.
  </li><li>I'll have to think about it.
  </li><li>All right, well, I hope that was fun.
 That was fun for us, just reminiscing about
 the wisdom we've experienced from friends, people,
 conversations.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I hope you enjoyed the podcast.

 of joining a group of very good looking, very distinguished
 people.
 You can do so from as little as $1 an episode.
 Here's how it works.
 You subscribe at any level that you want to be,
 and you help support the show.
 and you only get billed when we publish a show.
 So it's not like a recurring billing, like if we stop,
 like we've just been on vacation for two weeks,
 none of our members got charged anything
 'cause we didn't put out a video.
 It's a great way of just investing a little bit more
 into the podcast.
 We hope that you get incredible dividends from it.
 Also help support the show.
 And it goes without saying, except it doesn't go without saying
 'cause I'm saying it, that we wanna say a very, very big thank you
 to the members of the show who help support the show.
  </li><li>Thank you very much. - Keep it going.
 We greatly appreciate your membership and your support.
 If people want show notes for this week, you would go to Alan and AJ.com/247.
 There we go.
 And if you have got questions that you would like to ask us, if you need clarification on
 anything we said, or if there's specific topics you'd like us to talk about, head over to
 allenandagia.com/ask.
 All right.
 Have a great day.
