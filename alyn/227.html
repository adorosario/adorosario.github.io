<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in ages but gots for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Mr. Jones, I heard you got some news to share with everybody.
  </li><li>I do, it's big, big news.
 I tested the waterproofness of my phone.
  </li><li>And how did you do that?
  </li><li>I dropped it in the toilet.
 Like a minute ago, Edgy came to the stairs ready to record a podcast.
 She's like, guess what I did.
 And I was like, well, she's like, I dropped my phone on the toilet, which ensued a number
 of necessary questions.
 Like, was there anything in the toilet when you dropped it in there?
 Which thankfully there wasn't.
 Okay.
 Thankfully it was clean.
 But your phone, they're waterproof.
 Yeah, it would be fine.
 I did scream.
 I didn't hear it.
 Yeah.
 Well, I did.
 I screamed.
 I, I've never, I've never dropped any device in water before.
 And I'm thankful that this is waterproof, but I just, it just happened.
 It was so fast.
 I remember one time leaving my phone in my pants and I went through the laundry
 and everybody accused me doing it deliberately so I could upgrade to a new
 phone that was coincidentally around that time.
 And it absolutely was not, but nobody would believe me.
 I wouldn't have believed you either.
 What?
 No.
 When do we get to trust?
 Oh, that's a feeling.
 Oh, it's not a feeling.
 Sorry.
 Talk to Chip.
 How is everyone doing?
 We hope you had an amazing week this week.
 We've had a really good week.
 All things considered.
 We have.
 It's been a good week.
 I think partially because we had that Greek salad
 we talked about last week, twice this week,
 including about an hour ago.
 I tried to take Alan's leftovers.
 Like he wasn't eating it fast enough.
 I push my plate away to check something on my phone
 and that apparently is universal sign for spouses everywhere
 to go, are you done with that?
 Which is normally the roles are normally reversed.
 That's what you do with me.
 It's such a good salad.
 There's something else you're excited about
 that you launched last night on Instagram to everyone's great surprise, including myself.
 Yes. Well, you did know about it.
 Well, I knew about it in the, I had like about 24 hours notice from everybody else.
 Cause you were like, I would like to do this thing.
 Could you make a video?
 And I was like, yes, but it was all your idea.
 I had nothing to do with it.
 So tell the good people what you've done.
 Yeah.
 I'm going to be doing a 12 week live course this summer.
 When you say you're going to be doing it, like you mean you're doing it or you're
 leading it.
 Well, I'm leading it.
 So the material has already been created.
 So we have a book that we're going through.
 We have videos that we're going through and then I'm going to be meeting
 live with everybody on Saturday, those that go through the course and just sort
 of having coffee.
 That's perhaps my favorite part.
 Coffee makes everything better.
 And the answering questions and praying for people.
 Things like that.
 So, if I'm listening and I tell me more about that, so I'm interested.
 What am I going to get out of it?
 You are going to get out of it, being able to hear God's voice, having hindrances broken down
 between you and the Father and having more intimacy with the Lord.
 That's amazing. And so you've written a book, for those of you who don't know,
 ages written a book called Finding Father, that as you said, has been out for 10 years.
 10 years.
 Astonishing.
 I know.
 So you're going to people are going to be using the book.
 And then they'll be working through the videos that accompany the book that they'll have access to.
 And then every Saturday morning, you're going to sit down with everybody who's on the course
 and just do a live chat, live stream.
 Yes.
 And you're excited about coffee.
 I'm so excited.
 And I'm excited to meet the people that are going to go through it and help them.
 If that sounds interesting to you, how do the people who that sounds interesting to find out more information?
 Go to alan and hj.com and you'll be able to see all the information there.
 Here's the thing though, you're kicking off June 1st.
 I am.
 Which gives you not a lot of time to decide whether you want to do this.
 and actually registration for it cuts off May 31st.
 Yes.
 And you've decided to steeply discount, because we have a video course that goes along with your book.
 Yes.
 That's normally 200 bucks.
 You've decided you're going to cut that in half.
 Yes. Just for this.
 Just for this.
 To do this.
 So if you've ever wanted to do the video course, this would be perfect because you get the guide
 who actually wrote the book and speaks in all the videos to accompany you.
 Yeah. It's going to be great.
 All right. Well, we've been in this series on feelings.
 We've had a lot of fun with it.
 It feels like it's really resonating with you.
 Thank you for all your encouragement that you've been given us.
 It's nice to do a podcast where there's so much energy around.
 It feels like people are really getting into the topic.
 I'm loving the continuity too of just being able to do one after another and kind of, you know, see what that looks like.
 And we've been doing this out with the work of Dr. Chip Dodd.
 He came up with this premise that there's eight core feelings, just like there's eight musical notes in an octave, just like there's three primary colors.
 And we've talked about five of the feelings so far.
 And our sixth feeling, trying to say that fast.
  </li><li>Sixth feeling.
  </li><li>Is what we're gonna be talking about today,
 which is shame.
 But I do wanna put a little teaser.
 We've got a very exciting announcement
 that we wanna tell you about.
 If you've been loving this series,
 you're gonna love my announcement.
 We're gonna be sneaky and keep it till the end.
  </li><li>It's interesting to talk about shame,
 because if you're, you know,
 if you've listened to our podcast for a while,
 or you're from a similar church culture to us,
 we've done a lot of ministry and a lot of talking about shame,
 and it's actually not the same thing
 that we're talking about today.
  </li><li>Yeah, this totally threw me.
 When I read Chipps book, again, I rolled so much
 when we got to shame because in our world,
 in the inner healing world, in the school
 supernatural life world, if you've been a grace
 or if you've done it in Canada, we've talked
 and teach a lot about shame, about why shame is a bad thing.
 We talk about being a shame-based culture.
 We talk about the shame-fear control cycle.
 We talk about shame, boo, get rid of shame,
 that's something we want to work on.
 And now we come to something using the same name, shame,
 but we're gonna realize we're talking about something
 completely different.
 So this week's episode is gonna differ a little bit
 in format from the way we've done the previous episodes.
  </li><li>Yeah, so in previous episodes,
 we have talked about what the feeling is
 and then we talk about what the gift is of that feeling
 and then we move on to the impairment.
 But because of the potential for confusion,
 we're gonna do it backwards today.
 So we're gonna actually start by talking about
 what the impairment is.
  </li><li>So we're gonna talk about the impairment of shame.
  </li><li>Yes.
 is toxic shame and you might be thinking, wait, what?
 So here's our cheat sheet to help you understand
 toxic shame is chips terminology
 for what we previously referred to as shame.
 So let me give you some meat on that.
 So in the past, when we've talked about
 the shame for control cycle, when we've done ministry
 into shame, if you've done the school with us,
 if you've been on encounter weekend
 and we minister into shame,
 technically what we're ministering into
 is what chip calls toxic shame.
 So then the next question might be,
 is well, okay, if I now know what toxic shame is,
 like the bad stuff, and don't worry,
 we'll describe it a little bit more detail.
 If that's the impaired version,
 then what is like the other shame that we speak of?
  </li><li>Right, like what's the goodness that is found in shame?
  </li><li>Right, like what's the feeling shame
 if what we know a shame is toxic shame or impaired shame?
  </li><li>That's a great question.
  </li><li>How many shames could we mention in this thing?
 Well, the shame that we're talking about,
 just to make things simpler,
 like the feeling that we're talking about shame,
 let's refer to that as healthy shame.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Which again seems like a paradox
 for those of us who have done work in shame.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So healthy shame is this beautiful feeling
 that inside the feeling that lets us know
 that we have limitations,
 that while I might have gifts, actually I'm not God.
 Healthy shame gives us these parameters
 that we are limited by design.
 We're limited in that we need other people,
 we're limited in that we need God,
 we're limited in that we can't do everything ourselves.
 We're limited in that we flourish better in community.
 We're limited a bit like we're talking about last week
 that I'm really good at speaking,
 but I'm not really good at plumbing and that's okay.
 That's healthy shame.
 Now, you might be thinking,
 that sounds nothing like the shame,
 when I think about shame, that doesn't sound like shame,
 precisely.
 Chip is introducing us to this new concept
 that feeling shame, being aware of our limitations
 is actually a really, really good thing.
 And all the other kind of negative side of shame
 is what he would refer to as toxic shame.
  </li><li>Yes, yeah, so healthy shame is often the feeling
 that we hate the most because it reminds us at our core
 that we're actually limited and needy people.
  </li><li>Right, and we've been trained in the culture
 to hide our needs and not have limits.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I was just gonna power through,
 just gonna ace through this thing,
 limitations are for losers.
  </li><li>That's right, type A personalities,
 we're gonna do this.
  </li><li>Right, and that's like, no, that's not how we're built.
 So healthy shame, this really good thing
 that tells us we have limitations.
 Toxic shame is the impairment
 when we don't want to feel the shame of having limitations.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The gift of healthy shame is...
  </li><li>Humility.
  </li><li>And here's how humility works.
 Humility comes from us understanding
 that we actually have limitations.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That while we're wonderful, and we are,
 and while we have gifts,
 at the same time, we have limitations.
 And all our giftedness and all of our awesomeness
 is still not enough because we still need other people
 and God to be who we are in this world.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that's humility.
 It's just an understanding that like,
 that's actually okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, humility is a right understanding
 of who you are and who you're not.
  </li><li>Oh, why don't you just say that earlier?
  </li><li>Well, I don't know.
  </li><li>It's gonna be triple over my tongue.
 We often talk like in our culture
 about our love of people who walk with a limp.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And what we mean by that is there's something beautiful
 about being around people who've had brokenness in their life
 because they quote unquote walk with a limp, right?
 Which comes from the Bible, you know,
 when Jacob wrestled with God
 and then do the angel of the Lord touched his hip
 and from that day on he walked with a limp.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>There's something beautiful about being around people
 who are aware that their giftedness
 is not everything about them.
  </li><li>And there's equally something scary
 about being around people that haven't actually
 experienced failure or have done everything
 to avoid it and have done everything
 to avoid humility, basically.
  </li><li>What's the fear?
 Like you say it's scary.
 Like what do you think the fear is for you?
  </li><li>For me, I find it difficult to trust them
 because I think you learn so much about yourself
 and you learn so much about God
 in having to come through your own weakness.
 And God meets you in the midst of it
 and you learn about yourself and you learn about,
 you know, your strengths and your weaknesses
 and you can have a weakness.
  </li><li>Right, I'm deeply suspicious of people
 who present an appearance of being flawless,
 of having no difficulties, of having no trouble.
 Because I'm like, I don't think that's true
 of the human experience, so I feel like you're lying to me.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But that could just be me.
  </li><li>And me.
 (both laughing)
  </li><li>Apparently both of us.
  </li><li>So that dynamic that we're talking about,
 like walking with a limp,
 that's one of the ways that humility
 is worse than our life.
 So we all have giftedness. We're all gifted. We are all indeed gifts.
 But until we experience some level of brokenness, we tend to use that giftedness to promote ourselves,
 to protect ourselves. We form our identity around our giftedness, which is terrible, by the way,
 because you don't take your gifts to heaven. There's no need for your giftedness. Heaven is not
 waiting for me to get there and be a good teacher. Heaven is not waiting there for
 age you to make them a Greek salad, right? So you don't take your gifts to heaven, you take your
 character to heaven. We don't know that heaven is not waiting for my Greek salad, we're just saying.
 Remember we're talking about healthy shape. Yes, never mind.
 But seriously that salad was so good it could be heavenly. I understand where you're going.
 So if we have an experience brokenness, we make our whole identity our whole life about our giftedness.
 The beauty of brokenness is that we understand in real terms, not theologically, not theoretically,
 that we have limitations, that our giftedness is not enough, that our community doesn't really
 need our gifts, our community needs us as a package. And so once we experience that brokenness,
 the motivation for why we operate in our gift changes, that the motivation changes, that like,
 I now allow myself to be part of a community where my gifts are wanted, my gifts are welcome,
 and I serve others rather than serving myself with my giftedness.
 Yeah.
 Does that make sense?
 So rather than use the gift in me to promote me, to keep me safe,
 to form a view of me that seems more acceptable to other people,
 I now actually use my gift on a platter of servant to serve other people.
 Yes.
 And it's beautiful.
 Yes.
 And when you've got a community of humble people who know their gift in this
 because humility is like, no, no, I'm not very good at cooking Greek salads.
 No, I'm not very good at teaching.
 It serves nobody because when you're in that fake false
 humidity, yeah, when you're in that false humility, you deny the
 gift that you are to the community that you have. Yes. And
 it's one of the most nauseating things in the church today.
 But I'm just going to slow myself down and calm myself down.
 I think humility also like having to acknowledge weakness and
 choosing to move towards humility kind of gets the spiky
 edges off of people. You know that thing with the experience
 where you're like, I don't know what it is about you. But when I
 touch you, I feel like, you know, there's a sharpness that doesn't feel.
 I wonder if the sharpness comes from a territorialness of like, actually, I am
 the gifted, whatever, like, this is my gifting.
 And so I'm feeling some level of competition.
 So I have to scare you off because this is my thing.
 And this is what I've built my life around.
 Or maybe you just need to be perfect.
 Ooh, because you can't be perfect and have shame.
 So the value of pain and brokenness is actually that we get to see our own
 neediness and limitations. Yeah. Which comes back to what we
 talked about last week that the joy is a tender response to
 weakness. Yeah. There's something beautiful about being
 around broken and vulnerable people who are not trying to
 hide their brokenness and their vulnerability. Right. And
 equally, there's something terrifying and nauseating about
 being around people who are trying to hide what everybody else
 can see and what we all know. Right. This afternoon, I had just a
 really sweet tender conversation with two of my oldest and
 Dearest friends, Glenn and Anna.
 They live in Scotland, I obviously live in America.
 I've known Anna since I was 15 years old.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>We went to the same Bible study
 when we were both in high school.
 And I met Glenn, I met Glenn in my first year university.
 He was fresh off the boat from Ireland.
 And I don't know how, he was probably like 18 or 19.
 I've known them both for over 25 years.
  </li><li>One might say you've not only known them that long
 but terrorized them at times.
  </li><li>Sure. (laughs)
 To know me is to be terrorized by me.
  </li><li>It's true, it's true.
  </li><li>So these dear friends of mine that,
 like we have this rich 25 plus year history
 and we stay in contact, I was the best man at Glenn's wedding,
 Glenn was the best man at my wedding.
 They've, you know, they've got three beautiful daughters.
 I love them at pieces and I have terrorized Glenn
 my whole life. - Yes.
  </li><li>Oh, the stories that man could tell.
 And just talking to you today was beautiful,
 just catching up with them, having this rich kind of connection
 that you can only have with people that you've known 20 plus years over FaceTime,
 just having a conversation.
 And I was thinking about a conversation many years ago I had with them when I,
 when I lived in Scotland and I remember dearly,
 I remember their apartment and they lived in the kind of like attic of this old,
 uh,
 couples house in Edinburgh, beautiful house, probably worth millions,
 but they lived in this kind of like creepy attic part.
 And I remember them sitting down,
 sink me down and trying to what I would call give me a confrontation like with kindness and with beauty.
 And they, you know, these are people who love me.
 They know me probably better than anybody else at that time.
 And they're sitting down and all they're trying to do is say, Hey, Alan, you probably don't realize this,
 but this is how you're being experienced.
 Like we experienced it.
 If we're experiencing probably other people.
 And I remember listening to them and I remember like doing the nice Christian, like nodding.
 And then my head just thinking, Oh my gosh, they're so adorable.
 And then when they finished,
 tell me all the stuff that was clearly wrong,
 I remember just doing the nice sweet, sickly Christian,
 well, thank you, I will pray about it.
 And I remember my prayers were like,
 Lord, what's up with them, my critical spirit much.
 And honestly, just throughout what they were trying to say,
 like I could not hear the weaknesses
 that they were trying to point out,
 presumably because having a weakness meant I was flawed
 and I didn't, you know, I'm resisting,
 but humility basically, moving to toxic shame.
 Because probably, again, I don't remember much,
 I do remember thinking you're wrong.
 And then my timing might be off,
 but maybe about a year later, two years later,
 I went to work for a boss.
 I think everybody needs to work under a horrible boss.
  </li><li>At some point?
  </li><li>Yeah. - I've done it,
 so I don't need to do it again.
  </li><li>I just think it accelerates the thing
 that we're talking about.
 Like having unjust authority labor over you
 produces character far faster, at least it did in me.
 He is a pressure cooker, a character formation.
 And I remember working for this ogre of a man.
 I mean, he was a cross between
 pre-Donkey Shrek and Darth Vader.
  </li><li>Oh, okay, oh, there's a visual.
  </li><li>Gastly, aggressive ogre of a man.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And I remember maybe working for him
 for like a week or two weeks,
 and I remember going back to Glenn and Anna going,
 "Everything you said was right,
 "'cause I could see in him
 "everything they were saying to me."
 Like, you know, it's that whole thing of, you know,
 God will use the weaknesses of others
 to refine the weaknesses of you.
 And that's what was happening.
 This man was me.
 Like everything I hated in him,
 I had to admit was so present to me.
  </li><li>Like where you were headed?
  </li><li>Oh, well, not even where I was headed.
 I think I was neck and neck.
 And I just saw it in a mirror like, oh God, like,
 this is what you're, oh, this is what I'm like.
 And it was horrible, but a gift from God.
 And it's that whole thing of like,
 God will use a kind messenger and a hard messenger.
 Glen and Anna was a kind messenger and I couldn't hear them.
 You were like, yeah.
 It's a God-set like art messenger.
 It's again, like you either fall on the rock or the rock falls on you.
 Yeah.
 So what was the point of that story about weaknesses and humility?
 Like they tried to point out my weaknesses.
 I had no humility.
 I got ground into a pulp by this ogre of a man.
 I learned humility in that season.
 Yes, you do, don't you?
 So healthy shame in marriage is actually really wonderful because I can acknowledge my weaknesses
 and my strengths and take your time via slow and as methodical as you'd like.
 Thank you, darling.
 No, I'll finish this.
 This is not an example of healthy shame at all.
 But a couple of weeks ago, we were on a podcast and I said something and then you corrected me.
 And I was like, I don't think I said that.
 that you're like, "No, you did." And then because it's recorded when I'm going back to editing,
 I was like, "And a clip, and clip, and I'll save that for later."
 Because you didn't, you mean? I didn't. I didn't. Well, okay. Ignore everything I just said,
 because that's not an example of healthy shame. But you're talking about marriage.
 That was keeping it later for a toxic shame episode. How mostly...
  </li><li>I love keeping a record of wrong.
  </li><li>Yeah, exactly.
 Yeah, I mean, I think without healthy shame,
 you would keep a record of wrong.
 It's like you live like that, you know?
 We'll just ignore what you just said a few moments ago.
  </li><li>Well, you would, yes, score keeping, which we've done.
  </li><li>Yeah, we have.
  </li><li>Are you kidding me?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Absolutely, I will save that as ammunition
 for later when I need to snipe you.
  </li><li>Yeah, and so it's interesting actually,
 'cause even in processing with the kids,
 like they'll come in and MJ will say stuff like,
 "Mommy, you know, whatever, you cook more than daddy
 "or you cook better than daddy or whatever the thing is."
 And I'm like, "Hey, that's one of my strengths."
 You know, daddy's strengths are Zelda.
  </li><li>What are my strengths?
 Say them out again.
 Slowly, methodically, clearly.
  </li><li>Very slowly and in list formation.
 But they understand that we balance life
 by playing to each other's strengths
 and not being like critical of each other's weaknesses,
 but just going, hey.
  </li><li>Which has not always been that way.
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>I can think of plenty of times I've shamed you
 for not being good at what I'm good at
 and not having any grace for it.
 'Cause I'm just like, it's just a DHCP server.
 Just reconfigure your IP.
 It's like not, just renew the lease.
 And you're like, I don't know what you're talking about.
 And then, conversely, you're just like,
 it says fold it in, not whisk it.
 And I'm like, what's the difference between folding
 and whisking, well, but I don't know.
 Stop yelling at me.
 I've got TCIP servers.
 I don't care.
 That's probably not even the right letters.
 Well, it's close.
 It had the right letters.
 Yeah.
<strong>TCIP.</strong>
 There we go.
 OK, there you go.
 So I can think of times when we've absolutely--
 and we're not trying to paint an unrealistic picture
 of our marriage.
 There are days when we are not gracious with that.
 Absolutely.
 However, I would say this has really, really helped
 us understand the gift limitation thing.
 And again, it introduces joy into marriage
 because if we can treat each other with tenderness,
 like there's a joy that I can help you when you're weak.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I've just think about last week
 when I was helping you with spelling,
 that was not joyful.
  </li><li>No, no.
  </li><li>Do you wanna talk about that?
  </li><li>We could.
 Okay, so the thing is, is I can't spell.
 Like, I can't, I just can't spell.
 I've never really been able to spell well.
 I heavily rely on spell check,
 and if it doesn't pick it up, I assume it's fine.
 And then--
 I love hearing you make your visible thinking.
 I never knew that part.
 And I randomly capitalize things,
 because it just looks right in my head.
 So if I look at it--
 Agent has a condition called "capitalitis,"
 where it's just random capitalization,
 with no rhyme or reason.
 You know what?
 It feels right to me.
 Yeah. So last week, I actually sent a text message. Well, the problem number one was I wasn't wearing my glasses when I texted and I can't actually see my phone now unless I hold it really far away, which I didn't do.
 So I fat-thumbed it and sent this text, which I thought was probably fine. I couldn't like see it properly.
 Your turn had coffee.
 I hadn't had coffee.
 It was very early in the morning.
 There was a whole bunch of things stacked against me in this scenario.
 But anyway, I sent it out to our whole senior team,
 and to which Alan appeared after a few minutes and was like, uh,
 I was like, are you having a stroke?
 I think it's actually what I said.
 Are you having a stroke?
 Was that text a cry for help, which didn't set the tone for,
 Hey, you have some limitations.
 Would you like me to help in your limitations?
 Well, right.
 So I had realized after I'd sent it,
 I put on my glasses within about 30 seconds of that before he showed up and then I was like, oh my gosh
 What did I just send and I'm thinking okay? I have to fix this. I'll go back in I'll make it make sense
 And then he appears I was trying to be jovial, but it came across as patronizing. Yeah, it totally did
 Right, it didn't come across as jovial. So I was like, okay
 I'm gonna fix it to which you responded
 Do you want me to stay and read it over for you afterwards and which one I hear that said back to me like probably wasn't my smartest move
 It's like hey you big idiot
 And read this for you because even with your glasses on I'm not sure you know
 Fair what happened?
 Well, it depends on how you really tell this story
 so
 You know anyway, it's it's it's too an our team and I I fixed it and it made sense
 But Alan afterwards when I came downstairs. Do you want to say you said?
 Mr. Keeping no record of wrong well the the so my reason to stay behind the help was I
 Anticipated that the same problem would repeat itself, which it did
 Because there was now 13 errors instead of like when he's
 He's like there's two shouldn't have been two spaces instead of one. I'm like nobody cares about this
 This is like a speed piece of information
 Because the story gets changed
 But I probably haven't still in my lab thought where we could pull it up and I could show you your unedited version
 This is going terribly. Let's not use this example in the podcast. So this is an example a
 Recent example of us not being okay with one another's limitations like I am not okay in that moment with your limitations
 Sure, and I wasn't okay with my limitations either, right?
 But I think I wanted
 Grace extended and I didn't feel any grace from you. Oh, and when you retell it like there was not much grace
 Yeah, I feel like I should apologize again. You go ahead. Did you want to apologize? Yeah, baby?
 I'm sorry. I was insensitive and I didn't treat your limitations with kindness. Thank you. Would you forgive me?
 I do. I forgive you of course. Do you wanna have special kettles? Okay?
 Let's finish podcast first. Okay, I could be better. Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you just suggest the podcast would be foreplay the one about shame?
 Let's move on, shall we you know you talk about the beauty and there is beauty like we've given an example where there's not beauty
 But there is beauty in marriage and understanding one another's limitations like I experience on a daily basis from you
 You are very very good at serving me in my limitation
 You really are like you know if I was left to my own devices had just eat Snickers
 And that would be like my nutrition.
 I'm like, well, the peanuts in it.
  </li><li>You might even try to fry them.
  </li><li>It's all free food groups, it's fine.
 And you take care of me.
  </li><li>Well, babe, but you do the same for me.
 You take care of my technical stuff,
 you like make all of my devices work
 and do all of the online everything.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm the online everything guy.
  </li><li>Yeah, you make us look good.
  </li><li>But thinking about that, I was thinking this afternoon,
 knowing that we're gonna go record a podcast today.
 I was thinking about one of the beautiful things
 about working at Grace Center.
 And really to give on awareness, do Jeff and Becky
 have done a beautiful job of creating a culture
 where you don't have to be perfect to be wonderful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like what I love about our community that I've experienced
 and this comes straight from the top
 is that many of the things that I would think
 are limitations, Jeff somehow isn't dissuaded by that
 and has created a team where like,
 they generate a part of the senior leadership team
 the Gray Center. And when I think about that team, it is this beautiful team of people who've
 got very, very strong gifts and very, very significant limitations.
 Yes. We would all say that. Like, I know I am a severely limited in many areas. And I
 also recognize I bring many gifts to the table. And that's true of everybody I sit at the
 table with. And somehow that works that our strengths and our weaknesses cover for one
 another. And I think that's beautiful. Yeah. That were, I am not shamed because I'm not
 like Tony. Tony is celebrated for being Tony. Alan is
 celebrated for being Alan and so on and so forth. Right.
 And it's beautiful. Yeah. And so all of this freedom where I get to be me, you get to be
 you, Jeff gets to be Jeff and so on and so forth. And nobody's shame for their weaknesses is
 beautiful. Yeah, it's wonderful.
 Chip has this great saying. I was reading his book. He said it out one of the lectures I wrote down
 It was so good.
 You said the greatest fulfillment in life
 is to be of maximum service to others
 through being yourself.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And that's what I feel like,
 I feel like my job, I get paid to be me full time.
  </li><li>Yeah, me too, I love it.
  </li><li>Which I love.
 So if you can find a job where you get to have maximum impact
 by being yourself and get paid for it,
 you've won.
  </li><li>And we've actually, I mean, again, obviously I love
 Grace Center, I love being at Grace Center,
 but it's just been really fun.
 even with the people we lead,
 to be able to hand that down as it were,
 like to be like, no, this is, you get to be you.
 And you get to be the best version of you,
 and you don't have to look like the other person beside,
 you know, like, so we all get to help each other
 in this great team environment, I love it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think too, if you can't admit that you have a weakness,
 you actually can't ask for help.
  </li><li>Oh, absolutely.
  </li><li>Right.
 So then you really are in trouble.
  </li><li>Right.
 have a weakness and I'm willingness to ask for help. And so whatever it is that you end up doing
 is not going to be what you wanted. Chip says in his book, and I'm quoting here,
 but I'm adding in the word healthy before shame. Yes. Sorry, Chip, for adjusting your manuscript.
 Healthy shame is the feeling that first brings us into relationship with ourselves,
 because it makes us conscious of our incompleteness. Even in our confidence and ability,
 Healthy shame helps us see that we need others.
 It points out our shortcomings, our humanity,
 so that we better understand ourselves for who we uniquely are,
 so that we can value ourselves for how we were uniquely created.
 Despite all our shortcomings, we're quite capable and competent,
 sometimes even extraordinary.
 Healthy shame reminds us that we're not God.
 Yeah.
 Healthy shame says I have limitations and that's totally okay.
 Healthy shame is a prerequisite for boundaries.
 I have limits and so I'm going to have boundaries to help preserve those limits.
 Healthy shame is a prerequisite for healthy life.
 Boom.
 You were talking earlier about, you know, if you don't have healthy shame, you can't ask for help.
 Yeah.
 I was thinking about Jesus' words, you know, the whole "come unto me."
 All who are weary and heavy, lightened, and I will give you rest.
 Rest.
 All right.
 Take my yoke upon me.
 Well, let's just actually read it rather than miss Kota.
 Okay.
 Matthew 11, 28 says, "Come to me, all who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
 Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble and heart, and you
 will find rest for your souls.
 For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
 You can't fulfill this verse without first understanding that you need his rest."
 Yeah.
 healthy shame to understand like I'm limited, therefore I need some rest.
 Right, we're in contrast. Pride says, no, no, I'm all good. Thanks. I don't need rest.
 I don't need help. I'm all good. Yeah.
 Whereas humility says I can rest because like I'm not enough. I can rest because I'm human.
 Yeah. I can rest because I need rest.
 Right. I can rest because the world doesn't depend on me doing everything.
 Right. So let's go back now with an understanding of like, this is what healthy shame is. This is
 This is the gift of healthy shame.
 It's humility.
 Let's go back now and talk about toxic shame with which we're familiar.
 Yes.
 Hither to the artist formerly known as shame.
 Right.
 Now known as toxic shame.
 Toxic shame says humility means weakness.
 Yes.
 Toxic shame says needing rest is for pansies.
 Yeah.
 It's for wimps.
 Toxic shame says if you make a mistake, that means you're written off.
 You're useless.
 Yeah.
 inability means worthlessness. And we notice that a lot. So part of our job is to help raise leaders.
 We notice in the very early stages, the embryonic stages of raising leaders,
 their performance is up so high because they're leading other people who are going to make their
 own decisions, which they think are going to reflect on whether they're a good leader or not.
 Yeah. So we often watch in our early stages of raising leaders, they step in a codependency
 to seemingly help the people they're leading, but really it's narcissism.
 They're only helping the people so that they don't look bad as a bad leader.
 And that's toxic shame speaking.
 Like I'm only I'm only as good as the behavior of the people I'm leading.
 And I'm like, oh, body.
 Wow.
 So toxic shame basically denies that we're needy humans or if we have a need, then we're broken.
 Yeah.
 Oh, we're revolved.
 So like we need other people, why can't I just make it like with somebody else?
 That's toxic shame at work.
 So does it seem to you like perfectionism is what feeds toxic shame or one of the things that can
 be it? Oh yeah I'm sure. Yeah. Oh absolutely. It's like it's a mask that you can wear so that
 people can't see how you are. Like the root of toxic shame is like I am flawed. I'm uniquely and
 hopelessly flawed. I am wrong. So I will just cover up with whatever performance addiction to
 hide that so that the world can't see it. Right. Doesn't work though. So remember last week when
 when we're talking about fear and the impairment of fear had two impairments.
 It's the same with toxic shame.
 It's a two for one.
 Yeah, a two for the the impairment of shame is toxic shame, but also the impairment of
 healthy shame is also contempt. Really contempt for who we are, contempt for how we're made,
 contempt that God made us with limitations, contempt that I have need,
 contempt that it's utterly unacceptable that I can't do everything.
 Yeah, I actually remember a fairly long season in my early 20s where I had so much contempt for other people's weakness.
 Because, and I didn't realize it was because I had so much contempt for my own.
 Oh sure.
 And I couldn't admit to my own.
 So I openly admitted to my contempt for others.
 Great.
 Yeah, it was beautiful.
 So much easier to just point out the flaws in others and then look at ourselves.
 So much easier.
 Yeah.
 Thanks.
 Glen and Anna.
 You know, it's that whole, you know, spec and log scenario.
 You know, oh, there's a spec.
 Oh, I have a tree.
 Well, listen, just disregard the tree.
 You're spec is terrible.
 Like that's back.
 Somebody once told me that the acronym for shame stands for
 should have already mastered everything.
 Yes.
 Right.
 And this content, this toxic shame, it speaks harshly to its host.
 Yes.
 There's no winning.
 It's just going to completely live in condemnation.
 Yeah.
 In his book, Voice of the Heart, Chip says, "Toxic shame."
 I'm having to hold the book about six feet from age of space.
 It's social distancing reading.
 It's, but this is like shame.
 You know what?
 I can't read it closer.
 So I can admit my limitation and just say,
 and I'm happy to help hold it away from you.
 You can hold it way over there so I can see it.
 Okay.
 So toxic shame helps us deny our natural condition
 that we are left with anxiety, dread of what will happen, and a demand to control,
 struggle to keep others away from our hearts. In healthy shame, we say, "I am limited,"
 which leads us to ask for help. In toxic shame, I am limited becomes I am a mistake.
 This poisons the truth of our hearts and forces us to go it alone.
 Continuing chips as this, those who feel toxic shame are very hard on themselves.
 They're always trying to earn everything from love to grace.
 They live with a millstone around their necks.
 To hide this pain, many shame-bound people spend their lives achieving
 and obtaining great things, but never experienced the wholeness for which they were working.
 Comes back to your perfectionism.
 So sad.
 So that's our sixth feeling, which is healthy shame or shame, as Chip calls it.
 So if you the gift of shame or healthy shame is humility and the impairment if we refuse to feel our limitations if we
 refuse to recognize we're not god if we refuse to feel our healthy shame we move to toxic shame and we move to contempt
 Doesn't sound like a good idea does it?
 So here's what i'm excited about that i wanted to share with you
 I reached out to dr. Chip dot earlier today
 And just explained who we were and what we've been doing and said i would love it
 it would be super special if we could have you on the podcast to do kind of like a bonus
 session at the end where you could maybe answer our listeners questions. And he emailed back
 and was like, I would love to. Let's make it happen. So I don't know when that's going
 to happen. But here's what I'd love you to do. If you've got questions that you've been
 hearing us talk, because again, this is an our revelation. We've just been impacted
 by it. We're we've got our own limitations and our understanding of it. But we're going
 to have literally the person who wrote the book on the show. If you got questions for
 Dr. Chip, just go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask.
 And you can fill in a form, you can send in a question,
 and we'll do our best to ask in those questions,
 get in to answer them.
 Yay for that, I'm super excited.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm so excited, he's so lovely, Chip.
  </li><li>Oh, super sweet.
  </li><li>You can get the show notes for today's episode
 at <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>.
