<p> Mrs Jones mr. Jones Saturday night Saturday night and i'm wearing a shirt and tie you are and i'm wearing pajamas.
 Well i should even as i were not too formal not to inform anybody can come over to our house and feel comfortable right now no matter what they're wearing exactly yeah i love that we are such high producers that we live to give even in our fashion.
 How do we.<br/>
 I was it was a hard week it was a hard week yeah yeah we'll get that in a second.
 Our kids were on fall break they were yes and they go back to school Monday.
 You were an awesome mom you took some pottery painting.
 I did take them pottery part of what it's like taking seven and the five year old.
 Partry painting well and only one of the ones to go yes well seven year old have a yeah.
 She's quite proficient on her own, except that she got things with intricate little details in it, and then she wanted me to do that.
 But otherwise, she did most of the painting on her own was pretty self-sufficient.
 Tea on the other hand.<br/>
 Not so much.<br/>
 It was a slap and dab kind of job, and then she would get frustrated and say, "Mommy, fix it. Fix it."
 So really, I painted tears.<br/>
 i'm so glad i won rock paper scissors on that one.
 yeah.<br/>
 i'm willing to school this which they just love yeah they do love being there being part of it and then i introduced into charlotte fact for this week.
 Mm hmm which they asked for again today.
 I don't know that i've ever seen it.<br/>
 Maybe you've got to read it first.<br/>
 Okay roll down all do that on my spare time.
 Then we're teaching this week on school. We were teaching this week on school what we talked about on the podcast last week, how to be utterly awesome in everyday life,
 right, how to handle humans, how to negotiate.
 Stuff, how to build wealth in the kingdom, how to be on time.
 Yeah, I love all that practical stuff.
 It's very good stuff.<br/>
 And then you spoke at emanate on Martha Plexi.
 I did.<br/>
 Tell me what Martha Plexi is.<br/>
 Well, it's essentially being a human doing instead of a human being.
 That's very clever.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 It's basically just, essentially, I'm not really speaking on Martha Plexigam speaking
 on how to live your life from a position of rest and what the benefits are, that sort of
 thing.<br/>
 When I hear your testimony, which I've heard a couple of times, and I love hearing your
 testimony, I am amazed how you never reach burnout.
 Burnout.<br/>
 I never do or I never did.<br/>
 never did. Or do you think you were just so dysfunctional? Like were you? I mean, I just,
 you know, no, but I'm serious. Like the amount of stuff that you did, your homeless runs and
 your drama ministry and you're singing on the worship team and then prophetic ministry and
 being on the ministry team and then holding down a job. And, you know, all of this, I think
 the sad part for me is all of your doing was just your heart crying out for affirmation.
 Yeah, and also not being able, I didn't want to stop because if I stopped, I might actually
 have to think about the realities of my life, which I didn't think I could deal with.
 So I just thought if I'd go fast enough hard enough, I wouldn't have to think about anything.
 Well, that makes me sad.<br/>
 There's no healing in that.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Do you want to know why I like your Martha Plexi message?
 Why?<br/>
 the first time I ever came to Toronto in 2002, before I ever met you, you were speaking at
 a conference at Toronto and the afternoon session that you taught on was on Martha
 Plexi. You said hello, my name is H.A. Mallet and I'm a recovering Martha Plexic.
 That's true. And I remember thinking, that's very clever. And you had Toby Elliott wander
 around as a minstrel with her guitar and you made us all soak and I thought that was the
 the weirdest thing ever.<br/>
 That's amazing.<br/>
 Yes, that's true.<br/>
 I did that.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 Before I fell in love with you, I knew you as a conference speaker.
 Well, you know, then you just wanted to get in good with me after that.
 Is that what happened?<br/>
 That you can say.<br/>
 That came a bunch of later.<br/>
 And then so you taught and soaking and we wrote an article on soaking.
 That's up on the website.<br/>
 That got released this week, which is cool.
 And then you made.<br/>
 So here's my new thing for the website.
 I can only imagine how frustrating it must be listening to our podcast when we talk about food at least every week.
 I'm sorry, I need to post these recipes.
 You do.<br/>
 So I'm going to force you to because you already take the nice pictures.
 I do.<br/>
 Instagram.<br/>
 I do.<br/>
 But you made a delicious paleo panan.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 That was so good.<br/>
 Anchor.<br/>
 Yup.<br/>
 It was very good.<br/>
 What did you use instead of rice?<br/>
 Rice to cauliflower.<br/>
 When you say rice to cauliflower, what do you mean?
 stick cauliflower in a food processor until it looks about the size of rice and then you
 can steam it or fry it or I mean it sort of depends on what you're eating.
 It was so good.<br/>
 I had thirds.<br/>
 Oh, that explains it.<br/>
 I had a main portion and then I said, can I have seconds and you said yes.
 Then you went upstairs and I took advantage of that to have thirds and I was going to
 have fourths but you came down and you wanted seconds.
 So I gave out with my...<br/>
 You're so sweet.<br/>
 You know what?<br/>
 I love to give you.<br/>
 or fourths or thirds or fourths.<br/>
 That's that's lovely.<br/>
 And then I guess the thing that overshadowed our whole week was our friend
 Ben died this week.<br/>
 Yeah, Tuesday morning.<br/>
 But we're devoting the whole topic of the podcast of Ben.
 So we'll talk about him and his awesome wife in a second.
 Yes.<br/>
 We had a listeners question that I want to run through from Laura.
 She said, could you talk about journaling?
 I hear people talk about journaling all the time and how awesome it is.
 But I'm never really sure what it consists of.
 Oh, cool.<br/>
 Go for it, baby.<br/>
 I can tell you.<br/>
 If you Google Mark Verkler,<br/>
 the IRK, LER, or don't even bother Googling,
 just look in the show notes and I'll post a link to his website.
 Mark wrote this incredible teaching,<br/>
 I don't know how many years ago, about the four keys to hearing God's voice.
 And the four keys are, you quiet yourself down,
 down. Again, a quiet place. You fix your eyes on Jesus so you want to look for vision as you pray.
 You, number three, you want to tune to spontaneity, recognize that God speaks in a spontaneous flow.
 And then number four, you want to write it down. Now, I'm sorry I said that so quickly. You want to
 read this article. It's all from Habakkuk too. It's an awesome practice that I learned. I don't know
 how many years ago and have been doing almost every day. But basically journaling is when you sit down
 and you write out your prayers to the Lord. Hey, Lord, I'm here today. I'm just wondering what
 today has in store for me. I'm just wondering if you want to say anything to me and then you
 pause and you listen to what the Lord says to you and you write down what the Lord is saying to you.
 And then you just go back and forth. That for me is two-way journaling. So when you've heard us
 talk about journaling, I'm literally talking about sitting down and writing out a flow of
 thoughts to the Lord and then writing out the flow of thoughts that he responds back. Most of the
 the book of Psalms is two-way journaling. A lot of the prophetic books is two-way journaling.
 The book of Revelation is pretty much a recording of a revelation that John the Blub had had.
 So in essence, that is what journaling is about. If you were to come on the School of Supernatural
 Life, the very first thing we did to you, day one, is how to hear the voice of God and
 how to journal. And it's an amazing teaching. We're very grateful for Mark for giving us
 that teaching. But anyway, check the show notes for more information about John Lennon.
 So, Asia Jones, let's talk about Ben Farley. For those of you who never had the privilege of being
 Ben, Ben was a young man at a seven-year battle with what turned out to be the rarest form of
 cancer that has ever been diagnosed in America. I don't know why I say that so cheerily.
 Like he won an award for that, but that was the truth, a seven year battle with cancer.
 And he died this week on Tuesday.<br/>
 We just had his funeral today.<br/>
 So we're feeling a little bit raw and a little bit heavy hearted.
 It's amazing how we found out on Tuesday.
 And I for me just put my head down because I thought I literally don't have any
 time to process any of this with all the commitments we've got for this week.
 I think I'm just going to push through till I get to the funeral and then I'll grieve.
 But it's amazing how grief doesn't fall into line with your schedule.
 No, it's strange.<br/>
 It hasn't been very compliant.<br/>
 So I came home and I'm like, "And now I will grieve."
 I guess nothing's happening.<br/>
 So maybe grief will hit me tomorrow, I don't know.
 But that's not just having been grieving, but I haven't...
 You did cry several times going through your presentations.
 I did.<br/>
 Preparing a funeral was hard.<br/>
 Especially for Ben.<br/>
 time I read it, I would start crying. But I don't think I'm as in touch with my feelings
 in my heart as I will probably be. But for those people who don't know Ben, young man
 loves Jesus. Give me five words to describe Ben for me.
 And he joins starting with number one.
 He's a character. That's four words.<br/>
 Oh, integris.<br/>
 Integris? Good. Next one.<br/>
 Funny.<br/>
 Um, genius.<br/>
 He's a genius.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, he was always quick off the, you know, with the comments and all that.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So, um, party animal.<br/>
 I know that's two, but I'll hyphenate it and get it.
 Let it slide under one.<br/>
 You let me have it.<br/>
 Um, lover of Jesus.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, no, you've just come on.<br/>
 You're going to have to go regarding the rules.
</p><ul>
  <li>Lover, hyphen of, hyphen Jesus.
  </li><li>Absolutely, yeah.
  </li><li>I could hashtag it and squish it all together.
  </li><li>Oh, you're so clever with your hashtag.
  </li><li>Yeah, thank you, thank you.
  </li><li>Give me your best Ben Farley memory.
  </li><li>Ah, my best Ben Farley memory.
  </li><li>The best that you can think of,
 given I've just thrown this at you.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 When Ben hosted us at the school last year,
 he had like a song picked out and did like a rap
 and all this stuff.
 And then he wrote us each a letter
 and gave us each a gift.
  </li><li>He gave us gifts, plural.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think his letter, which we've still got somewhere,
 I wanted to find him.
 I'm not even sure I'd read out if I could find him,
 but it's somewhere in the house,
 because we're in a scam. - I'm pretty sure I'd try.
  </li><li>But yeah, that would be an example
 of Ben's total intentionality.
 you ask Ben to do X and he does X plus plus.
 So, hey Ben, could you, you know,
 we teach all our smoke-out leaders how to host
 a speaker for the week.
 So, you know, they look at their bio,
 they introduce them, they are their runner
 for the week at the school, they introduce them.
 And so, you know, it wasn't,
 so Ben had seen all the stuff do that.
 When it was his turn, it just happened to be us
 that was speaking at the school that week,
 not some famous speaker.
 But Ben went, again, nobody asked him to do any of this.
 This was just Ben going, oh, how can I do this brilliantly?
 Well, I don't even think he saw that.
 I just thought, how could he do it?
 And because he's brilliant, everything he did was brilliant.
  </li><li>Yeah. - So yeah, he went
 and got me Fiji water. - Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Because he knew it was my favorite water
 and it was square in the square bottle.
 So it wouldn't roll off the podium
 'cause he knows the bottles of water
 would roll off the podiums.
 He got us hot towels.
  </li><li>He did. - It was amazing.
 He bring up steam towels for us to like,
 I mean, like who thinks that?
  </li><li>He's like, it's for your face.
 I was like, Ben, honey, I wear makeup.
 I put them on my face and I'm gonna look like a raccoon.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Then he brought his DJ decks
 and he had a theme song for us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then he wrote us those beautiful letters
 and gave us gift baskets.
 Like mine was hand-picked barbecue sauces,
 his favorite six barbecue sauces from around the south.
 And I worked my way through every single bar.
  </li><li>He did.
  </li><li>And it wasn't, he just went to the grocery store
 and just pulled off six random ones.
 these were his that he like I stand behind these. These are the best sources.
 Yeah, I have. He got me a Williams and so my gift card.
 Right. So he, I mean, just so intentional and lovely.
 I saw the jam, you know, the coffee shop in Nashville that this morning,
 they were giving away free Lucy Rizzo, blueberry muffins because they said
 there were fans favorite muffins and he was so in love with them that he'd
 buy way more than he needed just to give them away so that other people could
 experience them. And I thought it doesn't matter what Ben was into. He was an influencer to the
 Max. Whatever he was into, he would ensure that you were into two just because of his love.
 And you wanted to be into it because he was so enthusiastic about things.
 I think the most amazing thing about Ben is, you know, his dad at the funeral today,
 I was fine till Mr. Farley started speaking and then I just lost it. But he was just saying,
 I watched my son go through the most horrific things and I never ever saw him complain.
 Seven years of cancer eating away his body and all the tests and the procedures that go with it,
 none of them pleasant, a whole lot of experimental stuff. And he said he just never, never complained.
 I think that was the amazing thing. As a pastor, it's hard not to compare people's trauma.
 so you go from being with bane on monday and he's maybe just being told by the doctors he has three months to live i come back to that.
 And then you meet with somebody who's upset because
 boy that they thought that really liked them doesn't actually like them even though the boy doesn't even know that they exist and never actually communicate and you you have to go you have to not go do god please have to gather woman.
 Because that's a real thing to them but in relation to where poor bens heart is just like you don't have cancer you're not dying.
 But in Ben conveying to us his heart of what was going on, never once was there any sense of drama or anything.
 You know, he seemed so detached.
 Ben wasn't like that.
 Like people would come up to him and ask for prayer for a cold.
 And it's not like he was like, you know, are you kidding me?
 You want prayer for cold?
 I got cancer.
 I mean, it's not like he was like that at all.
 He'd be like, yes, you know.
 And he'd see people get healed of stuff.
 It was amazing.
 One of his servants that he did as a student was on healing.
 Unhealing.
 healing and he would see. And I just think that the dichotomy of what he was going through and
 yet his spirit was so joyful and so happy. He would have by all rights. If he had been,
 gosh, I mean, he just wasn't negative or anything. You would not know to look at him or talk to him
 that he was going through what he was going through. No, no, it's all. He didn't feel
 story for himself. He didn't nothing. It's just amazing.
 The last text I got from Ben, I think it was almost the last text. But I didn't know he
 was in hospice at this point, but he'd just been moved to hospice where he later died
 in hospice. And he sent me a text. It was early Saturday morning. And I think this sums
 up. He's towards the end of his life. He's clearly dying. He's aware that he's dying.
 And this is what he said. He said, "Hey, Alan, I wish I could send this in a more formal way than a
 text, but I'm not really up to writing in any other way at the moment. No matter what seems to
 happen or what doubt tries to come at me, I cannot seem to doubt the goodness of God.
 Just impossible for me to see him as bad. No matter what happens in life, no matter how much
 pain or suffering, there seems to be, my mind will not even let me go down that road.
 I was just thinking, "Lord, how did he have that resolute passion on a revelation of your goodness
 when at times it feels like, you know, we're huge proponents of the goodness of God,
 but we can get fickle. Oh, they've run out of chocolate milk. Oh, my day is ruined." You know,
 And you're just like, get a grip, Jones.
 And so, but that was testimony to Ben's inward focus and his love of Jesus that was just
 remarkable.
 I am earlier this week in preparing for the funeral.
 I asked people to write in and just, you know, tell me some stories about Ben and the way
 the funeral ended up going.
 I'm sorry.
 I don't actually use any of the stories.
 I felt like the Holy Spirit said go in a different direction, but I wanted to share some of them.
 Hope that's okay.
 I guess people shared them, knowing that they'd be used publicly anyway, so they're just
 being used publicly here.
 So, well, there's a great story, two stories here from Quinn.
 I said, "I have a couple of stories, not the most dramatic, but they say something about
 Ben.
 First one was when we were treasure hunting in Kroger.
 By the way, treasure hunting, for those of you who are not familiar with that, is an
 evangelism, not technique, but something we encourage at the school.
 Basically, people go out in twos and threes or maybe small teams.
 And before you go out, you ask the Lord for a place, a person, you know, a person's name,
 a malady situation or whatever.
 And then you go to that place, you look for the person, and then you just wander up to
 them and say, Hey, I'm on a treasure hunt.
 I think you might be one of my clues.
 Do does anything on my sheet of paper mean anything to you?
 And so basically you're looking for people that you can encourage through prophetic evangelism,
 evangelism healing or share the gospel.
 So anyway, first one was when we were treasure hunting in Kroger.
 It was a supernatural evangelism week, I think, and this was our homework.
 So we were out on a Friday night after having fortified ourselves at Chick-fil-A.
 We're wandering around Kroger and we see this guy on crutches.
 He's on crutches because of his left leg from the knee downwards is missing.
 Just then bends phone rings.
 So he takes the call.
 It's one of his buddies.
 It was always one of his buddies.
 because he had like one and a half million buddies. And he's saying, yeah, bro, dude,
 I got to go. I'm in Kroger with Quinn. We're about to see someone's leg grow out. I almost
 passed out. But that was the zeal and the passion and the faith which Ben would approach
 everything. The second one was when I met him for breakfast in the pancake pantry. We got
 the small table, which had four chairs around it. He took a seat and I took a seat immediately
 to his right, i.e. not facing him. After I'd sat down, he got up and changed places so he was
 directly opposite me. I then realized influencers really do need eye contact.
 Here for another one. This is from Micah Antonitis. Probably my favorite band memory is when we were
 on outreach with School of Supernatural Life last spring at Auburn. We were on Ben's home turf
 and he was pumped. One afternoon I just tagged along while he made his rounds around campus
 to connect with people, old friends and his favorite places. Everywhere we went we ran into friends,
 everywhere. I already knew Ben was a living legend but he was sealing the deal right in front of my
 eyes. We stopped by his old fraternity house where he was intent upon finding the house moms
 who cooked and cleaned so that he could pray with them. They were overjoyed to see Ben.
 They both had pain in their backs and needs from standing and working all day so we prayed with them.
 They were so grateful and full of joy in life just like Ben.
 They both felt better and wouldn't stop hugging us.
 Not just Ben but both Ben and I.
 I was a friend of Ben so I was their friend too.
 This moment so epitomized my experiences with Ben.
 With Ben I was always getting into fun, uplifting, supremely human and surprising social situations
 which I would never have found myself in otherwise.
 I always came away happier. He carried joy in his bones, he grabbed hold of faith and stepped into the fun of the kingdom.
 He against all odds chose life for every turn, and he brought everyone along for the ride.
 Oh, that was lovely, Micah.
 I, you know, the funeral this afternoon, I was sharing this verse which I said, and I agree with.
 If there's a verse in the Bible that perfectly sums up Ben's character and Ben's attitude,
 it would be 1 Peter 3.15. It says this, "Through thick and thin, keep your hearts at attention
 in adoration before Christ your master. Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks
 you to give the reason for the hope that you have." Again, against all odds, Ben had this incredible
 hope that he never let go of and would share with every single person that came in contact
 with him.
 What was the other verse that you read this morning at the funeral?
 I think it's maybe from Corinthians or something.
 Oh, in Philippians?
 One of the eons anyway.
 Yeah, one of the eons.
 Paul says, "I forget how the NIV puts it, but the message is this, 'Alive I'm Christ's
 messenger and dead I'm his bounty.
 Life versus even more life.
 I cannot lose.
 Yeah, that's something.
 And Ben used to say that.
 He said, you know, he was used to say that, you know, Alan, when
 doctors tell you that you're going to die, it's not life and death.
 It's life and life.
 He said, you know, after like the third or fourth time of being told
 how you got three months to live, he said, you start believing them anyway.
 And he, you know, even towards the end, he was just like, you know, if I
 get healed, that's awesome.
 I don't get healed as even more awesome.
 I go to be with him in glory.
 Tell the dream that you had just before you died.
 Yeah, it was last week.
 And in the dream, it was so vivid in the dream.
 It was from the perspective of coming into heaven, kind of like coming off of an escalator into heaven.
 Right.
 And ahead of me was this huge balloon arch.
 You know, those, um,
 Blue Narch is that they make for parties.
 Sure.
 But it was rainbow and it was massive.
 It was like 200 feet tall and there was balloons and people everywhere.
 Like it looked like it was the president's birthday.
 There was so much activity and so many things, you know, it was an obvious celebration.
 Right.
 And there's hundreds and hundreds of people.
 And I looked over to the right and there was these two men standing there.
 And so in the dream, I was like, Lord, who are those men?
 and he said they're Paul and Silas.
 And I was like, wow, what are the, you know,
 what are the, why are they here?
 And he's basically a memo had gone out,
 like that somebody famous was coming to heaven.
 And I knew, you know, I just,
 I knew that they were just waiting for Ben, you know,
 that the memo had gone out that somebody famous was coming.
 And it's funny, I'm gonna have talked about it this week,
 was heaven ready for Ben, you know?
 (laughs)
 I'm sure heaven is a lot more fun now that then dance parties and it's a strange mix of emotions,
 isn't it? Because you're very sad that Ben's no longer with us.
 Yeah, but you're equally as joyful that he's no longer in pain.
 And then you're, you know, slightly jealous that he is in heaven.
 And that's a radical thought.
 I remember thinking that, you know, waking up Tuesday and getting the phone call that Ben had just passed away.
 and just thinking, "Oh, real time is now in heaven." The kingdom that he so loved to preach about
 is where he is right now. And then of course, there's the grief and the sorrow that you feel
 especially for his family who've lost, you know, brother and a son. And in the midst of all of that,
 life has to continue. You still have to cook meals and it's just such a bizarre week.
 We love Ben Farley and we love his family and if you knew Ben, you know exactly how we're feeling.
 And if you didn't know Ben, I'm really sorry you didn't get to know him. He was absolutely amazing.
 Two thoughts for you. One somebody this week and I maybe you'll remember who it was said,
 you know, because heaven is outside of time. It's a split second before we see him again.
 Right.
 You know, for him.
 Um, the other thing is I loved in, in the obituary for Ben, one of the things that they said
 was, you know, do something nice for somebody, because Ben was always doing something nice for
 somebody, you know, going out of his way to bless someone or be helpful or be a source of joy.
 And so they said, you know, hey, do something nice for somebody and then send them
 and email and say, "What did you do?"
 And Ben's name, you know.
  </li><li>Wow, I love that.
  </li><li>I love it that his family,
 I mean, his family is just amazing.
 And even in the midst of all of this,
 they're still thinking, "What would Ben have done?
 "What would honor him the most?"
 But what could be part of his legacy?
  </li><li>Right.
 just yeah, amazing family.
 And I mean, his legacy, you know, as you say,
 you're saying today at the funeral,
 we, some friends of ours went to Africa
 and in some remote village,
 somebody was wearing a team, Ben bracelet, you know,
 it's Ben's reach was really, really, really far.
  </li><li>Yeah, really was.
 Well, baby, not to end on a,
 I hope that's not a diner, it's not a diner,
 It's awesome. Ben is amazing and he loves the king and the king loves him and he's with
 him right now.
 He's with him.
 We get to see him, like you say, in a blink of an eye. If Ben, on his death, Ben, could
 rejoice in the goodness of God. Then we push back all our circumstances and just say, "God,
 you're good and you're kind and you're amazing."
 So guys, I hope you have an amazing week, a phenomenal week, and we will see you next
 week, same time, same place.
