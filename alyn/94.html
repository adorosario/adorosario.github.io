<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the chances.
 Hello, my bearded wonder.<br/>
 Now let's start there.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 What happened this week?<br/>
 You got it trimmed so you don't want like a homeless person anymore.
 Yeah, I've gone from the look of laziness to the look of deliberate lifestyle choice.
 You have.<br/>
 As big as my barber is amazing.<br/>
 He is, he definitely helped make it look less terrifying.
</p><ul>
  <li>When I went to see him about five weeks ago,
 he said, "Don't touch a beard, don't do a thing."
 The key ingredient to growing a beard is to not trim it.
 And then when I walked back in,
 looked like a werewolf that had been pulled through that,
 a hedge backwards.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I said, "Can we touch it now?"
 And he's like, "Yeah, I'll take care of that for you."
  </li><li>Yeah, it looks much better.
 And you got a haircut, you look very handsome.
  </li><li>Thank you so much.
 In all honesty, what do you think about the beard?
 I mean, has it grown on you?
 I, I, it looks nice on you.
 Oh, look at that.
 A genuine compliment about the beard.
 I don't want you to keep it though.
 What about keep it at this length?
 For a limited amount of time.
 Sure.
 And what's your worry with me keeping it forever?
 Uh, cause I didn't marry Lyle.
 I married you.
 Oh, all that I would have a beard like Lyle.
 I'm not a beard fan.
 I don't like kissing it.
 And very few women actually do like
 how about I shave like a big enough hole around
 that's disgusting.
 So no, you didn't even let me finish.
 I don't need to let you finish.
 I understand where your little mind was going.
 All right.
 So yes, tell me about this week.
 It was different than most other weeks for the last eight months in that we didn't
 have to teach at school.
 Has everyone been asking you what you're doing with your time now that the students are away?
 Yeah.
 Like somehow we're on vacation.
 Like we just sit at home and like, I don't know, stare at the furniture or something.
 To put it in perspective on any given week when we're teaching the school, we could be teaching anywhere between 10 to 12 times.
 Yeah.
 And those are our in 15 minute sessions.
 Yeah.
 In a week.
 Yeah.
 This week we taught twice.
 That's our dramatic drop in preparation delivery.
 because as much as we enjoy teaching and we genuinely do, it is a physically exhausting task.
 It's an enormous amount of work.
 Well, no, I just mean the actual presentation part of it. There's an awful lot of work that goes
 in preparing for it, but actually talking the amount of energy that that takes as ridiculous as it
 sounds. But anybody who's a professional public speaker, a teacher, a lecture, or anything like
 that will understand, man, you sit down and you hit adrenaline fatigue.
 Yeah, but I think still like the 40 or 60 hours worth of work that goes into producing weekly material
 like the amount that we produce is
 More that's more the drain to me than actually even delivering material. So it's so nice to not have that being prepared
 Yeah, I can get cut up and all the other stuff that's not getting done. Well, that's the thing people are saying. Hey
 What do you do? Are you less busy and we're a different kind of busy?
 We're just as busy, but we're busy at a different pace.
 Yeah.
 Doing different things.
 Yeah.
 People busy.
 Yeah, people.
 We're trying to meet with all the people that have been waiting and all that kind of stuff.
 So yeah, it's good.
 It's a nice switch.
 And you spoke this morning, didn't you, babe?
 I did speak.
 I spoke on the kindness of God.
 And then last Monday, you spoke on hell.
 Yeah, I like to balance that my teaching.
 Well, the reason I taught in hell was Gary Morgan gave me a word when he was here and he said that I was going to
 to use my brethren upbringing to bring people who are in the kingdom to an understanding
 of what they've missed.
 I think especially for my journey, I was raised in a very conservative evangelical church
 background which I'm forever grateful for.
 When I met the Holy Spirit and moved into more charismatic circles, I had a foundation
 of a bunch of stuff that all fit on top of.
 I think for a longest time I've assumed everybody's had the same foundation as me, and not everybody
 has.
 Right.
 And so I've been wanting to, for a long time, teach on the basics of our faith.
 In fact, earlier this year when we were planning our emanate meetings, we blocked out the
 month of March anyway.
 And then along comes Gary, and he gives me a word about that thing.
 So I started a series at emanate called "The Foundations of Our Faith."
 And last week we looked at what are we saved from?
 Yeah.
 safe from death, Hades and the fiery lake. And we talked about why hell is real and universalism
 and annihilationism. Thank you. Our nice thoughts. But they're not biblical.
 There's not a biblical support for us. So yeah, it was a heavy topic. It was going to be more fun
 tomorrow night because on Monday, I'm teaching on what are we saved for? Right, which is way
 more fun to talk about way more fun. And this morning, of course, was me just standing up talking
 about how amazing God is.
 Which was awesome.
 I was the kindest person I've ever met.
 And you didn't cry.
 I totally expected you to cry.
 I cried a little bit in the first service
 and I teared up in the second.
 But I'm a grizzled professional, so I just moved on.
 Yeah, whatever.
 Every time you speak about the kindness of God, you cry.
 Well, you know why I didn't cry?
 Why?
 Was Blake Stratton wasn't there to make me cry?
 OK.
 So what, no, in all honesty, because Blake sits at the back.
 And when I'm teaching on the kindness of God,
 and I connect eye contact with Blake.
 I can see that he's being moved, that I'm being moved, and then we both tend to lose it.
 So it's Blake's fault.
 It's totally Blake's fault.
 Absolutely.
 It's your fault.
 Speaking of Blake, this is the way my brain works.
 So Blake, Bethel, new Bethel album.
 Yes.
 Oh, it's so good.
 So good.
 If you haven't checked out a new Bethel album and it came out just only a few days ago, we'll put
 link in the show notes.
 It's just a superb album.
 Yeah.
 They're doing such a great job.
 They really are.
 Our kids love Bethel kids.
 Tia yesterday asked if she could join Bethel kids.
 Oh, do you think there's space for another dancer?
 Because I've been practicing my moves and I know all of the words.
 I'm like, you are adorable.
 Oh, that's so cute.
 MJ still just thinks of the top of his lungs.
 Yeah, he does.
 So adorable.
 I went to the Apple store with Tia on, well, actually last night.
 Yeah.
 How that happened is Tia's iPad stopped working.
 Well, it's not it would take forever for her Wi-Fi to get connected.
 So she came up with the idea she said, "Daddy, you can't fix it.
 I think we should go to the Genius bar."
 So we made her an appointment using her Apple ID.
 So when we walked into the store, they must have known to be looking for a little girl,
 because it knows her age.
 And so they said, "Are you Tia? Do you have a Genius bar appointment?"
 And she was like, "Yes."
 And we'd rehearsed what she was going to say to the Genius.
 And it was sure I had fixed that was fun to be on a date with her at the Apple Store.
 Did she actually talk to the genius or did she get shy when she got there?
 She buried herself in my chest until the genius said, "Do you like Shopkins?"
 And then she couldn't get her to shut up.
 Right.
 Okay.
 So she was fine after that.
 Okay.
 That's so cute.
 One of the things we did this week, which we don't normally have time to do is we had a bunch of people over.
 Yeah.
 I mean, every year when the students go on outreach, we try and have those people that weren't able or chose not to go on outreach over for food.
 So we had a burger party at our house.
 It was a very limited burger party.
 Yeah.
 But there were burgers and it was a party.
 So I guess I qualify.
 Yes, a burger and chip party.
 But it was great.
 I just love having people over.
 It was so fun.
 And it was the first grill of the season.
 It was.
 And you discovered what about your grill?
 Well, Gary and Sarah Morgan, God bless them, bought us a beautiful grill.
 Not last time I was here with a time before.
 Yes. And it's just a gorgeous grill. It's an amazing grill. And we went, we were in
 home deep for the other night, when we were looking at grills and I went over to the grill
 that we haven't opened up. And I just kind of chuckled to myself that they disassembled it
 wrongly. Right. Until I realized, oh, they've assembled all of them wrongly.
 And you actually flipped it over to make it right. Well, that's what's, yeah. So basically,
 I opened up the lid and I realized that they're, what do you call them?
 Grills.
 The actual grill plates.
 The grate.
 The grate.
 In my mind, they were upside down.
 So I turned them over and then thought, I wonder if they've put them all upside down
 until my shock they had.
 But I pointed out to you that, oh, it looks like those are actually little feet that
 are now sticking up in the air.
 And then I had this horrible realization for the last three years I've been using my grills
 upside down.
 No wonder they're so hard to clean and they're paying to flip.
 Oh, and so I turned them over and I was like, that makes so much more sense.
 Yes.
 So it was an educational trip to Lowe's this week when we went on our date and we on our wander date.
 I think that's probably the equivalent of me when I go and help people with their iPads.
 And I'm shocked to find out that rather than just turning the screen off, they're physically powering down their iPad and then powering it back up the next time that you need to use it.
 And I'm the are you on drugs?
 That's probably what a grill master would look at our grill thing.
 Oh, what are you doing?
 Luckily, we didn't encounter any grill masters who could question you in such a way.
 All right.
 Do you want to know our topic is for this week?
 Well, we didn't talk about one more thing from this week.
 Oh, tell me, which was grilled.
 I love it.
 OK, this is going to be fascinating for everybody.
 Go on.
 Well, we're eating a lot of fish right now, which we'll talk about in a couple of weeks.
 And because they're eating a lot of fish, we decided to try halibut because I hadn't tried it.
 And I grilled it on the Breville contact plate griller.
 Look at you.
 So your fancy terms.
 Thank you.
 And it only took about three and a half minutes to cook the whole thing.
 To cook the whole thing.
 And I was a little worried because I'd never done halibut before, but it was yummy.
 Yeah, we're eating fish every single day every day.
 So we're trying lots of different fish.
 Yeah.
 We've discovered that we love cod.
 Yes, we do.
 Didn't think that I would love cod.
 I've never had halibut in my life.
 Halibut to win.
 Halibut is delicious.
 Seabass is delicious.
 Well, that's because you marinate and you're
 long. No, you could pretty much do anything to see
 bass and it's delicious.
 Mahi Mahi.
 You don't like Mahi?
 It's not turning out that well when I cook it.
 Well, kind of drying out really fast.
 At least you're not eating tuna out of a tin.
 No, I'm not.
 Why?
 because I'm allergic. So, you know, I think we should test and see if you're healed.
 Okay. I'll have an EpiPen standing by just in case.
 Let's do it. All right. Our topic for this week,
 because we're in this super laid back chilled mode and, well,
 Sunday was a busy day because we were teaching.
 We thought we don't have a topic for our podcast,
 but we do have a backlog of listeners questions.
 And every week we ask for listeners questions and they come in,
 but we never actually answer them. Well, we try and answer them.
 Okay.
 But we're going to do a mammoth run of listeners' questions.
 Okay.
 Do you want me to read you the first one?
 No, what I want to do right now is talk about the topics that we're going to be
 talking about so people can decide whether they want to stay listening or not.
 Oh, because sometimes if I was listening to this, I'd be like, I don't listen to
 listeners' questions.
 I want to listen to a topic.
 Okay.
 So the topics that we're going to be answering questions range from depression,
 school of supernatural life, wisdom and discernment in the spiritual realm, soaking music, how to
 remember your dreams, the difference between experiencing God with people and experiencing God
 on your own. That's where we're going. There you go. That's what we're talking about.
 If that sounds interesting, stay tuned. If it doesn't, we don't blame you at all.
 Have a nice week. We'll see you next week. We'll see you next week.
 All right. The first question. Yeah. Do you want me to read it or you want to read it?
 I'll read it. All right, go for it. It says, "I've been going through a season of serious depression.
 I'm disconnected from my community. In many days, I find it hard to listen to any voice,
 but the one of condemnation and self-hatred. On my worst days, I am frustrated with God,
 though I can't really give a good reason for it and ignore everything that is life-giving.
 I know with my head that this is all unreasonable, but I am so low on love that I can't do anything
 to snap myself out of it. I still talk to God, but have difficulty hearing him reply.
 I've reached out to friends to let them know what I am dealing with, but they can't give
 me what I need, whatever that is.
 Alan, I've heard you mention your nervous breakdown and period of depression many years
 ago. Do you believe you were saved before and during this period of your life? More
 broadly, is it possible to be saved and still be deeply depressed?
 Lastly, what are some things that I can do to leave this season behind?
 What a fantastic series of questions.
 This is an anonymous question, so I don't know if you're male or female, so forgive me
 if I get the gender wrong.
 You're absolutely right.
 I did have, in fact, I talked about it this morning at church.
 I shared from my life experience.
 When I was 21 years old, I had, I don't know what the proper clinical term was, but I probably
 should have been hospitalized.
 I was on lithium as a long-term stabilizing drug.
 I was easily clinically depressed.
 I was seeing a psychiatrist.
 I was just in an absolute state of despair.
 I stopped sleeping.
 I couldn't think straight.
 I was hearing voices.
 It was just the worst season.
 It was beyond anything I could have imagined in terms of bad.
 And you do a pretty good description of describing what it's like.
 And I have a keen interest in mental health, obviously because I went through that, but
 also learning what not to do and what to do.
 And I don't have all the answers at all, but let me tell you what I learned and subsequently
 have read from wiser people than I.
 Depression and mental health issues mental illness in and of itself is grossly misunderstood by the body of Christ
 Yeah, so advice like cheer up or snap out of it is not helpful because it's not something that you
 Have chosen to be sad about and it's not something that you decided to snap into and there are a number of reasons why
 Depression lands there's
 Biological reasons so there's chemical levels in your brain
 There's emotional reasons or environmental reasons for example. You're under stress. You've had burnout you're working too much
 There's hereditary reasons things can be passed on from your generation and then there's spiritual reasons there could be deep dark depression
 that's demonically inspired so there's this whole soup really of
 varying things that could impact a person's state and
 I think the church is ill-equipped because if you go to church with a cast on your leg
 People understand what's wrong and people have different expectations of what you're capable of because they can see the cast
 They can determine are you're immobile. Let me get the door for you
 There's grace for you not being able to move as quickly as you might do
 But when you're suffering from depression, there is no outside
 signals for people
 other than you're chronically sad and lifeless and people just think, oh, I feel like that.
 You just snap out of it. But until you've lived through clinical depression, it is not possible
 to imagine what it's like on the inside. It feels like you're completely out of control
 of any of the volume knobs on your life that determine your satisfaction, your appetite,
 your joy, your hope.
 And it's horrible, it really is.
 So my deepest sympathies and great compassion go out to you.
 In terms of telling your friends,
 again, unless they have dealt with what you're dealing with,
 it's not their fault,
 but they're not gonna be that much use.
 And it's also, as my friends told me later,
 you're not a joy to be around.
 And that's not your fault.
 I lived with three guys during my season of depression,
 and they would tell me
 horror stories of what I was like,
 most of which I was unaware of,
 or how I was affecting other people.
 But can you be a Christian and be depressed?
 Absolutely, you absolutely can.
 There is, I mean, if you read through scripture,
 you'll find many people who were devoted followers
 of the Lord, and yet they had bouts of depression.
 If you read the Psalms, for example,
 if you read Lamentations, if you read Job,
 there are these people who have a rich relationship with God
 and they weren't spared the darkness
 that often comes with depression.
 So in terms of more broadly, is it possible to be saved
 and still be deeply depressed?
 Absolutely.
 I myself have experienced that, I have ministered
 to many people who've been in that.
 And in terms of what can you do to leave the season behind, I would attack this season
 with a multi-pronged fork.
 I would go find a very sympathetic GP or doctor and explain what's going on, explain
 any reservations you have about any of the treatments that they might suggest.
 I would also find a skilled inner healing minister.
 Not that I'm suggesting that what you have right now is all demonic and just a deliverance
 session will take it. You're looking for somebody who knows what they're doing. John
 and Paul Sanford, who are grandfathers of the faith, have written some excellent material
 about dealing with depression. And I'd encourage you to read that. But if you can find somebody
 who is a skilled counselor, somebody who is well versed in the human heart, well versed
 in inner healing and deliverance, because they will be able to spiritually attune what's
 going on and they could be of great help for you. So yeah, attack it from a medical perspective,
 by all means, and attack it from a spiritual perspective too.
 It would be good to also go to restoring the foundations and maybe get a healing week there,
 be helpful. Our friends run a ministry called restoring the foundations and it's absolutely
 excellent. That wouldn't hurt either. But I think in the meantime, my encouragement to you is,
 This is not the rest of your life. This is a season. And the goodness of God, all the promises
 that you've heard still apply to you. And it's trite to say, but it's the truth nevertheless,
 please don't doubt in the dark what you learn in the light. Yeah. And again, this is not what
 God's called you to. This is not your norm. So I'm not sure that's how helpful that is. I'm trying
 I think of how I would have received my advice just then when I was in my deep dark depression.
 But anonymous would have prayed for you that that season lifts.
 Yeah.
 All right, AJ, I have a question for you. It sounds like a shaper question.
 Okay, I'm ready.
 This is from Melissa.
 Yes.
 And she says, my question for you is, what advice do you have for future students who already have
 jobs, they will have to balance? I'm trying to decide when it will be best to give my boss a
 heads up about the school. Is it best to wait until after I've put in the application or
 until I know I've been accepted? Also, what's your advice for S.O.S.L. students on balancing
 the school, jobs and rest, especially for those who might choose to work Wednesday through
 Saturday and also do church on Sundays? As an introvert and a high contemplator, I love
 having an empty day in my week that I can dedicate to processing, journaling, being creative,
 recharging, etc. But I know it's possible that this may not be an option for me.
 Well, Melissa, those are great questions. The first thing I would say is wait until you've
 been accepted to speak to your employer. Because there's some time that happens between filling
 out your application, hearing back from the school, all those kind of things. So then you're
 talking to them about a real for sure thing as opposed to running it by them a couple of times.
 So I would say fill out your application, wait until you get accepted and then chat with your employer.
 In terms of a day off, like if you're planning on working Wednesday to Saturday, I think
 that would be up to you. What you need to look at is can you financially make it
 having a day off and then work three days? Do your finances look like you could do that?
 Or do you need to work the four days? In which case you might have to just be really smart
 about guarding some evening time or, you know, morning time depending on when you work,
 that is just your time to make sure that you get your introverted fill up time.
 Right. So that would be my advice. Yeah. All right. I've got a question for you,
 Mr. Jones. Yes. This is from Faith. Hi, Faith. She says, "I want any advice or wisdom you may
 have on discernment. Discernment is something I haven't heard much teaching on, but something I
 I feel strongly almost every day.
 For example, I can be totally fine and going about my day, but when I get in an atmosphere
 with lots of people, I tend to feel tons of different feelings all at once.
 I can tell a difference now between what's my feeling and what somebody else is feeling
 with the help of the Holy Spirit, but I don't know what to do with it.
 I can't choose when to turn it on or off, but it'll just happen all at once and it's
 It's not like I'm feeling one person's struggles, but multiple different ones at the same time.
 All I want to do in those moments is somehow get a microphone and ask, "Who's battling
 with X, who's battling with Y and Z and pray for them?"
 But it's not my position or authority to do that, and I end up getting overwhelmed and
 just sometimes weep uncontrollably for things that aren't even my own struggle.
 So how do I get to a place of not neglecting the gift even when it's hard to carry?
 Do you guys have any experience with this?
 Do you know anyone who deals with this
 or have any book suggestions for me to learn more about?
  </li><li>I don't have any book suggestions.
 Maybe Alan can suggest something,
 but Faith, you are a wonderful mix of a feeler
 and an evangelist.
 I just love that your gut is like,
 oh, I wish I could get a microphone and just say,
 okay, who is this?
 So I can pray for you.
 I have gone through seasons where feeling
 was my primary way of knowing what was going on with people.
 And it is overwhelming at times,
 especially if what they're feeling is overwhelming,
 like grief or depression or any of those sort of things.
 But typically if I'm in a room with a lot of people
 and I can feel a bunch of stuff,
 I either ask the Lord to highlight to me anybody
 He wants me to go and talk to and pray with them, whatever.
 or if he's just, if I'm just feeling,
 and I don't feel any sort of knowing as to who to go to
 or what to do with it, then I just sort of pray
 through the feelings quickly and then ask the Lord
 to take them away.
 I don't know if that's the right thing to do or not,
 but I think sometimes he shows you so that
 when you start talking to person X,
 you're gonna have an idea of what's going on
 and how you can encourage them.
 But if it's just like absolutely overwhelming
 and you've not the foggiest clue.
 I think it's okay to say, "Father,
 can you either clarify or could you lift this?"
  </li><li>Right.
 I know that several of my profit friends
 went through seasons like this where,
 when I spoke to them about how they handle that,
 they say, "I've learned to change the radio station."
 And I said, "Well, what do you mean?"
 He said, "Well, if you go into a restaurant
 and you're having dinner with your wife,
 you're listening to your wife,
 but just because you're listening to your wife
 doesn't mean you can't hear everybody else's conversations.
 Right.
 But you've tuned out of those conversations
 to listen to the one that matters.
 Right.
 But you could equally stop listening to your wife
 and tune into the conversations happening behind you.
 And so I've had friends who've just said,
 over the years, I've learned to do that.
 I've learned to zero out of that.
 I'm much more sea stuff than I feel or hear stuff.
 And so with my thing of seeing it a little easier
 because I look in a different direction.
 Yeah.
 But anyway, hopefully that's helpful faith.
 We are blasting through these like nobody's.
 Come on.
 I got to get to the gym, baby.
 Yeah, you do.
 Come on.
 All right.
 Read me the next one.
 All right.
 This is from Catherine.
 And she says, is soaking music necessarily without words?
 Do you have any soaking music that you recommend?
 I've been looking and not finding much success.
 Love your podcast.
 Love you, Catherine.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, thank you, Catherine.
 And if you come to the right place,
 because we can just tell you immediately what to do.
 No, soaking music is not necessarily without words,
 depending on how you're feeling.
 You can have completely instrumental music
 or you can have people singing.
 For the longest time, the only soaking CD
 that I would listen to would be Laura Woodley's home.
 I still highly recommend it.
 Anything from Laura Woodley,
 now Laura Woodley Osmond is gonna be incredible,
 but she had a couple of albums
 that we would soak all the time.
 In fact, she just used a brand new one.
  </li><li>In love, yeah.
 And then the Rivera's Alberto and Kimberly Rivera,
 they have a mix of instrumental, spontaneous
 and songs with words and Julie True,
 who goes to Grace Center also has a mix
 of instrumental and singing stuff.
 So whatever floats your boat,
 we'll put links to all three of those artists
 for you to go check out on iTunes
 and hopefully you can find something that's super awesome.
 I'll tell you the other thing,
 the thing that I almost exclusively soaked to right now
 is the last night of the more conference a number of years ago, Jesse Early and the rest of
 worship team, Chris McLawney is in there and Luke Finch is in there and the Grace
 on our worship team, Josh Barson is on his awesome guitar. We just captured the most amazing
 spontaneous time and I'll put a link to it. It's called Glory. It is 33 minutes of just
 spontaneous uzanas. I interrupt it in the middle by praying. I apologize in advance,
 But I love it. That's what I pretty much do all my sermon prep to my soaking to it. I love it completely again show notes for all links to that
 Woo-hoo. All right next question. This one's from Camille. I'm enjoying listening to your podcast and have now listened to about 20
 I'm learning so much excuse me if you've answered this already
 But my question is regarding how to remember your dreams. I wake knowing that my night was busy
 yet only have vague impressions of the activity if i remember even one detail i'm thrilled.
 Maybe once every two months.
 Will i have a strong memory of a dream is a trick to teasing a dream out of my memory.
 All i'm so glad you asked this question because this is my whole experience i remember listening to bob jones talk about his dreams and i remember saying to lord lord i don't have dreams from you.
 and the lord kindly pointed out that you do not have because you do not ask.
 So I started asking the lord that he would speak to me in dreams.
 And with that prayer, I matched that with an expectation that he actually would.
 And I would keep a pain and a notepad beside my bed with a light and easy reach.
 And if I had a dream and I woke up with a dream, I would immediately record it.
 To this day, I just do it on my phone.
 In fact, last night I had a dream, I had a brilliant dream.
 And I, as soon as I woke up with a dream, I just typed it out on my phone.
 I'm not sure how much sense it makes.
 Now I'd have to go reread it early morning typing on the phones, not the best, but right.
 When you, when you prepare to hear from the Lord, you're telling the Lord, I'm going to value the revelation that you give me.
 So that's one thing, get pen and paper out.
 Another thing is to pray.
 And the third thing is if possible, don't set an alarm clock.
 Because sometimes your alarm clock interrupts you as you're dreaming.
 Yeah. In terms of teasing things from your dream, in the book of Job, it talks about how God hides
 things from people in dreams. And it's not like God's being mean, but he locks up stuff in your heart
 that he's going to reveal later in life. So he's not short on revelation. So don't worry about the
 dreams you have had, but you've missed asking for new ones and try those tips that we gave you and
 see if they help. Yes. All right, baby. Last question from Madeleine.
 I'm Adeline. She says, and on AJ, I have noticed that there's a difference in what I experienced when
 I'm completely alone with God versus when I'm with other people. I find it so much more difficult
 to connect and commune with God and assessing with other people around me than when I'm alone
 with him. Is this a bad thing? What could I do to change it? I would say, Madeline, I'm exactly the
 same. I find it much more difficult to connect with a group of people. But typically, when you're
 with a group of people, you're there to worship and you're there for corporate worship.
 And so if I'm there for praise and for worship, I'm okay that I am just choosing to lift him
 up and choosing to praise him.
 I don't feel as intimately connected as I do if I'm journaling with him or soaking
 or any of those sort of things.
 I think there's probably different kinds of connections for different activities.
 What's your thoughts, babe?
 I had exactly the same experience.
 In fact, one of the most difficult things I went through at the School of Ministry was
 we would do soaking every Thursday afternoon.
 So there'd be a room full of 70 of us lying down.
 I would get so angry that I'd want to storm out and leave.
 I remember my small group leader coming over, Sean.
 And he was like, "So, what's going on?"
 I was like, "I hate this.
 This is so stupid."
 A little bit of a lie.
 What it turned out to be was I didn't like having to share God with other people.
 Now, that sounds ridiculous.
 It was going back to my childhood that I'm the only boy I had three sisters.
 Yeah.
 And I didn't like there was a sibling rivalry I just realized and there was all this hurt
 and woundedness in my heart that I hadn't extended forgiveness from when I was a young
 boy.
 So I hadn't extended forgiveness.
 So all I needed to do was actually just forgive my sisters.
 Let's face facts.
 I'm done anything wrong.
 Right.
 They just existed.
 They just existed and competed for my parents affection.
 Right.
 That happened.
 I realized, oh God, other people's blessing doesn't come in the expense of mine.
 Okay, there's plenty. Yeah, but to this day my still my favorite way to access the Lord is on my own in
 Inness. Yeah, me too. All right, let us ask you dear listeners a question because we've been answering yours
