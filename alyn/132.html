 Yeah, can you tell me why have you not been to school today?
 Um, because I wanted to stay home.<br/>
 Is it because you've been smoking too many cigarettes?
 Yeah.<br/>
 Is that why your voice sounds weird?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Oh, I need to go poof.<br/>
 One second.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 to take off my headphones. When I come back I'll come and talk to you.
 I hate to hear. Hi. Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. Happy-Gill Jones. Yeah.
 How are you? Good. How excited on a scale of one to ten are you for Christmas? Ten. Tell
 everybody what Christmas is like in the Jones household. Uh, well, we open our stockings
 and then we eat our breakfast and then we eat open our big presents. And what's special
 about our breakfast. It's blueberry french toast. And it's the best isn't it? Uh huh.
 Can you tell me what you're most looking forward to about Christmas day? Uh... our
 blueberry french toast. That seems to be a winner. Abigail likes blueberry french toast
 too. Can you tell me why do we celebrate Christmas? Oh I know why because they're... it's Jesus
 It is Jesus' birthday. Tell me, what do you love about Jesus?
 He loves me. He does love you, doesn't he? Let's see if I can remember the story of
 the Nativity. What's his mom and dad's name? Is it Mary and Jacob? Is that who it is?
 Oh. Wait, I'm confused. Joseph and Martha, that's right.
 No. Well, who is it?<br/>
 Family and Joseph.<br/>
 And where was he born in a hospital?<br/>
 No, he was born in a barn.<br/>
 In a barn? Where is parents hippies?<br/>
 Were they all like home birth people? Or why not in a hospital?
 Do they have hospitals?<br/>
 Oh, so they just thought let's sleep in a barn.
 I guess. No, there was no room.<br/>
 They couldn't find Jiddy in.<br/>
 And any room at the inn? So Jesus was born, that's right.
 He'd born in Bethlehem.<br/>
 And then who came to visit him was it is why is man and they brought three.
 I'm gifted on iPhone and I pad on a pod yeah what was it.
 Gold so we're in forgot the last one yeah I think the wise man should have had like an Amazon wish list so that Jesus could have got what you wanted.
 Cold Frank is so severe.<br/>
 Um, are you in the mood for singing a song?
 Yeah.<br/>
 Go to the man, to step to the sky, to the bone.
 That's a good song.<br/>
 And a bad for him.<br/>
 Do you know the song "Away in a manger"?
 No.<br/>
 "Away in a mane."<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Do you want me to play it?<br/>
 It's by Faith Hale.<br/>
 If I play it, would you sing it?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Okay, let's play it.<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;&acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Oh, we're the angel &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; No crib for his bed &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; The Lord Jesus laid down his sweet head &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 The stars in the sky look down where we lay.
 The lips the Lord, Jesus, and the sea.
 We ponder the hey.<br/>
 From our family to yours, have a very Merry Christmas,
 and we'll see you in the new year.<br/>
