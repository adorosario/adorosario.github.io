<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Hello, sir.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 Anything you want to say to me today?<br/>
 You look handsome.<br/>
 Try again.<br/>
 Happy Father's Day.<br/>
 There we go.<br/>
 Happy Father's Day to everybody in the UK or North America.
 I found out that in New Zealand, it doesn't happen until September.
 Really? Yeah, our friend Stuart texted me and said, "Hey, happy Father's Day." I was like, "Oh,
 and I thought I was being clever going. Happy Father's Day to you from yesterday." And he was like,
 "Actually, now till September." Well, I had no idea. What about Australia?
 I'm imagining it's the same, but I'm not up to speed on my world Father Day events.
 Here's some things that I think of. Why wouldn't we all celebrate on this same day? I mean,
 it seems like that's one of those things we could have gotten the same day on. I understand
 Like the birth of your nation is going to be on its own day because, you know,
 it's hard to really get that all in the same day.
 Coordinating those things.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 But I feel like Father's Day and Mother's Day really could have been those kind of days.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I wonder if it's for Hallmark to spread out their earnings around the year.
 Possible.<br/>
 The other thing I wonder about is go on.
 Why sign language isn't the same in every country in the entire world?
 You're using your hands.<br/>
 but how different is it?<br/>
 Like how different is different?<br/>
 It's really different.<br/>
 It's a completely different language.<br/>
 Oh, wow.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So I mean, I can speak ASL, but I can't, which is American sign language.
 But like, for example, when we get together with RT and Louise, she speaks
 British sign language.<br/>
 It means nothing to me.<br/>
 We should start a separate podcast called AGS musings.
 Will you just think out loud?<br/>
 the hots. Dude, if you drop your keys into a river of molten lava, just let it go because they're gone.
 Let's talk about a week.<br/>
 Rescue rescue me.<br/>
 Do you want to know the highlight of my week was? Yes.
 You already know the highlight of my week.
 Was it kissing me? No.<br/>
 Was it?<br/>
 This is taking too long.<br/>
 The breakfast I made for you this morning?
 No, it was the Apple Worldwide Developer Conference.
 Yes, I knew that.<br/>
 It's my Super Bowl.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So I...<br/>
 Thankfully, there's no men in tight, so I'm okay with this.
 It's my nerd fest.<br/>
 I mean, Apple puts on a couple of events each year, you know, the launch of a new iPhone, perhaps a launch of a new product, like an iPad Pro.
 But generally, the worldwide developers conferences where they preview all their new software, they come out with the gates and say, "Hey, this is what we're going to be releasing."
 And it gives you some hints to the new products that are coming September.
 But this year they released four new operating systems and every year I tend to
 not learn from my previous years and just go ahead and install the betas.
 It is true.<br/>
 Every year I dread this conference because you will install the betas and then
 everything crashes for you for months.
 Well, it's like I'm using Microsoft products.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I'm asking about it.<br/>
 See how the other half live.<br/>
 Should we have a moment of silence for those that live?
 But honestly, here's the thing in previous years, you're absolutely right.
 that the developer build that they release at the conference is so flaky.
 It's not even a beta.<br/>
 So they release a developer build.<br/>
 You put it on your device.<br/>
 It is really flaky.<br/>
 And then two weeks later, they will give you the first beta, two weeks later,
 the second beta usually.<br/>
 But this year, I found the developer builds to be really stable.
 Yeah, me too.<br/>
 You're not running them.<br/>
 No, but my phone feels really stable.<br/>
 I'm considering running them because normally.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I just watch you exist in frustration for several weeks until things get updated.
 But don't you think it's glorious frustration?
 No.<br/>
 You don't think there's any joy in it in mind?
 Nope.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, do you remember last year I upgrade?
 I did the upgrade with you and then I made you switch it back.
 Right.<br/>
 Because I was like, you know, I don't need this level of frustration in my life.
 I don't remember that.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I made well of done, but I don't tend to remember things that are, you know, outside
 of your mind, Alice.<br/>
 Speaking of your mind palace, where is the cable for actually charging my pencil?
 You know, it could be numerous places.
 We're in the stage of packing and so it could be in a box of linen.
 It could be anywhere, but you can just shove it in the bottom of your iPad
 and it'll charge up overnight.<br/>
 It doesn't look very good, but it will accomplish the same thing.
 Oh, that's basically all that happened this week.
 I mean, the second most exciting thing from the World of Odds of Outers Conference.
 I want the dentist again. I mean, that's how mundane our week was.
 It was a very strangely slow kind of week, which I'm kind of grateful for.
 Yes. I mean, intermingled in there was parties and getting to be with friends and all that sort.
 I went to a dance party on Friday. I stayed home.
 Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dance. Yeah.
 It was a really bad 70s disco. No, it was very fun, actually.
 Okay, you enjoyed that? It was very good. You're a little dancing queen.
 Yeah. How excited are you about our new house? I am super stoked and I wish we could go in it
 and measure it and plan things. My shaper is somewhat stifled. Oh, well, there's a fun story.
 Yeah. He said, "Relising is probably not that fun to the vast population." Well, it's fun to ask.
 Do you want to tell the story? Yes. My husband, the super sleuth.
 Is this your super handsome? Super handsome. Super talented, super sleuth.
 Yep, there we go.<br/>
 Used his former hacking skills.<br/>
 Now that's a great exaggeration.<br/>
 Uh huh.<br/>
 You were a hacker, just a minute.<br/>
 It's good for you to ultimately track down and find plans for our house that we bought.
 So we have like the builders plans.<br/>
 Yeah, which I then imported and redrew because there were 10 year old plans, some of which were hand drawn from the builder who very kindly found them in their archives and they wanted to fax them over.
 but I was trying to explain that I live in a different century.
 And so eventually they scanned them in and emailed them over, but they had the
 resolution for postage stamp.<br/>
 But nevertheless, they were super helpful.
 But we now have actual house.<br/>
 So you're now dreaming in two dimensions, aren't you?
 I am.<br/>
 I am.<br/>
 I am.<br/>
 Yes, I have.<br/>
 I have like 14 or 15 pin boards.<br/>
 One for each room.<br/>
 I counted 27 thumb swipes the other night when you were
 showing me them. Well, that's also some food recipes and things. Yeah. And that's actually just the title pages as your thumb
 swiping. It's not the actual pages. Good Lord. But you know, you got to do what you got to do. I'm more excited about moving
 into this house than I was about moving into our current house, which is strange because we designed and built our
 car in house.<br/>
 True.<br/>
 But for whatever reason, I'm super giddy and can't wait.
 I'm really excited too.<br/>
 But we're packing like crazy people.<br/>
 And we're trying to work out how we're going to live in a packed up state.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I vote for living here, Oh camping style until the last moment.
 I'm fine with that as long as the camping is indoors and we have Wi-Fi and air conditioning.
 It'll be indoors with Wi-Fi and air conditioning.
 just not much else. Just mattresses on the floor.
 All right. Let's talk about our main topic for this week.
 Yes.<br/>
 It is, as I said, Father's Day today, the day that we record this, and tomorrow will be the week of Father's Day.
 And we had some, we had some musings about Father's Day, didn't we?
 It was spearheaded by Pastor Jeff's amazing message this morning at church,
 that he was talking about fathers and sons. And do you want to kick us off with that?
 Yeah, I thought it was really, really good.
 He did say some really interesting things.
 I loved his revelation about how a father, the true nature of a father, he said,
 is that they want to give, which I thought was amazing.
 And then he was contrasting that with sonship is all about valuing fathers.
 And it's all about positioning yourself to receive from a father.
 That's a really interesting topic. I think it was Paul who said you have many teachers,
 but few fathers. Jeff made this distinction between a father's not someone who instructs others,
 but one who reproduces themselves. This whole nature, the true nature of a father,
 like you said, is somebody who wants to give. I think in the church, we hear all sorts of
 stories, horror stories, really, of people saying, "Hey, I'm going to be your spiritual father."
 And really, the horror stories is what that actually means is I want you to serve me for free.
 Right.<br/>
 You're my new slave, which is entirely different from our experience of being
 fathered, saved by John and Carol, right.
 Where John and Carol's heart, especially, I mean, speaking from my experience was the whole
 time I was with them, they basically supplemented my lifestyle for a whole year
 while I traveled with them.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 There was no sense that I was paying them anything.
 But on the other hand, there was this enormous sense in that if the true nature of a son is they want to receive, I positioned myself to receive.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I think I've also worked really hard while you worked for them.
 Sure.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 But that's that whole thing of you want to receive.
 And I think I think we've both seen these lopsided relationships where the onus is on the sons to serve, but the fathers haven't got the revelation.
 and they need to follow well in giving.
 Or there's people who are trying to give away
 to people who aren't really sons or just followers.
</p><ul>
  <li>Right, and they're not actually looking to receive.
 They're just looking for you to open doors for them.
  </li><li>To unpack that a little bit.
  </li><li>Well, I think it looks different to,
 from a heart position to want to receive from a father.
 Because a father, like one of the things that Jeff said today
 a father opens doors for their sons.
 But I've also seen dads that open doors for sons that actually never received any discipline
 or instruction.
 And that usually goes badly.
 So the heart of the father is still good.
 I want to open the door for the son or the spiritual son.
 But if the spiritual son actually never positioned themselves to receive from the father, sometimes
 that can end up in a bad place because they haven't actually received the other stuff
 the discipline, the encouragement, the character, all the stuff that the father can build in the sun.
 But they have taken advantage of the doors open. Well, I'm so-and-so spiritual son,
 whatever, and walk through those doors without actually having received the stuff that the dad
 had actually received through life that would empower them to go further.
 And then I suppose, conversely, we've seen the opposite where you have genuine sons who are
 living to serve these fathers. But it's doubtful that these fathers were ever
 followed well, because while the sons are being earnest in their efforts to receive,
 the father thinks that they're just free fuel for their ministry.
 Right. Yeah, we certainly, I mean, you certainly see both. And then you also see really healthy,
 you know, father, son, or child, spiritual, parent relationships that are,
 their life on both ends there's a life flowing from the spiritual dad into the kids and there's life
 flowing back and honor flowing back and those are the ones that are just exciting to watch because
 you know that there's a generational blessing that's gonna unleash things you know it's gonna
 change things so i would say the big mistakes that we've made is that it took us a while to
 realize that you need to transition skills from being a son to being a parent.
 So I think when we got here, we very much viewed spiritual parenting in the same way that we've
 viewed spiritual sonship and they're two completely different skill sets.
 I once asked John, John, how do you know the difference between sons and daughters and people
 who are following you. And he said, "Well, I think you just know," which wasn't very
 helpful because I didn't just know, hence my question. And I asked the same question to Gary
 one day, Gary Morgan. And he just answered with a wink, you know, that little rygrine that Gary
 has. And he just said, "Well, brother, you know the answer to that. It's John chapter 1 verse 12."
 And so I'm racking my brain like, "What's John 1, 12 saying?" So I look it up. And he says this,
 but to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.
 That's a new living translation. I think a new international person says,
 to all who believed him and received him, he gave the right to become children of God.
 So usually your followers will listen to you, but the people who are going to position themselves
 as sons and daughters receive from you. It's that whole, we're trying to share this with some
 of the leaders in Iceland a couple of weeks ago when we were there, you know who you're
 positioning in your life as fathers because those people's words are big in your ears.
 It's not just that you're listening to what they're saying, you're now applying it to
 your life sometimes with great cost or great inconvenience.
 Because you're choosing to believe that their words have wisdom larger than you concurrently
 see.
 So even when you don't understand, you apply the wisdom that you receive from them because
 you're choosing to honor what they have over what you think you have.
 Right.
 I was thinking about this.
 This week I spoke at Emney and I don't even remember.
 The topic was, "How good is your God?"
 And one of the things- Great message.
 Thank you, baby.
 One of the things I didn't get to say but it fitted in with it was the story.
 When we got this house, the house that we live in now, when we moved out with it from
 the house that we were renting, we have a great friend.
 Richard Vouters, he's just an amazing man of God and somebody we love dearly and he lived
 with us for a while, something we love to do, we love having people live with us.
 And Richard got engaged and then married to Michelle, who's one of our fabulous pastors
 at M&amp;A.
 And of course we're thrilled, we're absolutely thrilled that they're moving out and they're
 getting married, that's incredible.
 But Rich Living here helped cover the cost of our mortgage.
 What we charged him in rent was super helpful.
 I remember one day, Jeff came along and just said, "Hey, guys, I've been praying for you
 and I have a thought for you."
 And we're like, "I go on."
 And he said, "I wonder if you should take a break from having people live with you."
 And I was thinking, you don't know our bank balance.
 Right.
 You don't know why we do this, obviously.
 I mean, aside from the fact that we love to pour into people, there's the very real
 effect that it actually helps us make ends meet.
 Right.
 Yeah, I totally understand that, but I think you guys have a higher value than making ends
 meet and that's your value on space.
 And I just think in this season of your life as things are ramping up, you're going to
 want space and I know you love having a God room and I just wonder if, you know, pray
 about it.
 And so that was one of those examples where, you know, Jeff's words are obviously very
 big in our ear.
 We've positioned ourselves in our lives to receive input from Jeff and Becky and we trust
 that God speaks through them, especially in areas that we might not hear.
 Right.
 And so despite the fact that it was going to put us at a financial disadvantage,
 we just thought, look, he's got nothing to gain by giving us that input.
 Right.
 He was praying one day, he felt that the Holy Spirit shared something.
 We're not hearing something either way.
 We're OK, your words are big in our ears.
 So we said, we're not going to do that.
 And two things happened.
 One, miraculously, our needs were met financially without having to take
 a tenon. And two, we found that the room that Rich was renting became our God room.
 Yeah. That's where we'd retreat to just have time with God.
 So I mean, yeah, I mean, even in that story, the wisdom of Jeff, and I remember when he told us,
 I thought, gosh, I don't know. I don't know that we can do that, but I'm also willing to hear and
 try it. And as it turns out, it was great wisdom for us in many ways. And it was also
 great to have a season where it was just the Joneses in the house, I think for the kids
 and for us and everything else. So on so many different levels, that was great wisdom,
 but we probably wouldn't have thought of it ourselves because we were sort of stuck in
 what we thought we had to do as opposed to what could God be saying about this next season?
 Right.
 I remember, we've mentioned this on the podcast before, but John and Carol, they would always
 say to us, "We really want our ceiling to be your floor."
 And I don't think I really understood that until I had kids, because one of the things
 that Jeff said today is, "Of course, you don't want for your kids for them to have had a
 a hard time when you had a hard time. You don't want them to go through the school of hard
 knocks just because you did. You want something better for them. And I think whether you're
 a parent or a spiritual parent, that's the cry of a parent is actually, "I want to make
 the road smooth for you." I don't mean you can take all the bumps and wrinkles out of
 it and I don't mean lessened free. But certainly, I want my ceiling to be my kids' floor. I
 I want them to, you know, it's amazing to me
 that our son is three and he prays in tongues.
 You know, like I didn't start praying in tongues
 until I was in my twenties.
  </li><li>Same here.
  </li><li>You know, it's, all that stuff to me is just like,
 God, you're so good that they don't have to wait
 as long as we did, you know, to see the things that we see
 or to believe the things that we believe.
  </li><li>Well, it's like when Tia got her American passports.
 So we have three children, one of them was born in Canada,
 the other two were born here in the States.
 And I remember the day that Tia, who's our first born child in the United States, got
 her American passport.
 I remember being in tears really, I opened it up and I looked at the US passport and
 I began to cry.
 And my wife's mocking me right now.
 I remember you crying.
 Oh, this is my love of America really.
 You're so cute.
 But I remember thinking about this whole thing of sonship, of my daughter gets for free,
 has cost me thousands of dollars in many years. And that's what dads do. They position their lives
 so the kids get an inheritance. And it's the same in the spiritual. It took me probably two years
 of diligent study and huge levels of skepticism and extreme hunger and tons of study to understand
 the things of the Spirit took me even more in time and money and effort to receive the
 inheritance that Toronto is and was. I moved my whole life there for a touch and God's
 kindness made me a son there. My kids were born into John and Carol's house literally.
 The first place they went when they came out of the hospital was back to John and Carol's
 house. Two of our kids are named after them. Our kids, John and Carol, these world leaders
 of revival are Mamet and Papa. I don't think they'll understand. How would they understand?
 It's just a normal film. It's just Mamet and Papa. For me, looking at that, just thinking,
 "Lord, these people who are distant heroes of mine, you've done something where in my life
 that's part of their lineage now. They're growing up with grandparents who've overseen the longest
 running revival in church history. Then you just take a step back and go, "God, what are you doing?
 That's unbelievable." The crux suggests message this morning is he's speaking to fathers,
 but he's speaking to everybody. The decisions you make today are setting up your legacy.
 And it was such a powerful message. I really loved it.
 talk about what we talked about when we got home from going to movie went to go see finding door you took the kids i'm not sure em j is really at the stage where he's enjoying movie theaters he wants to around to does.
 The girls left it so this was this i think is one of the benefits again living in america that Americans place a high value on celebration yeah,
 my upbringing so i don't want to speak on behalf of britain but my upbringing i would say that we.
 What i did so you come to father's day you come to mother's day you come to found times day you come to birthdays and you can have this kind of cynical edge of a just about making more money blah blah blah.
 I remember trying to celebrate my dad i was one of his birthdays is a little kid going hey dad your birthday are you excited and i remember that's in.
 No just another day and something got written on my heart there i'm not playing with my dad i'm talking about the culture group and something got written on my heart there.
 Why even bother is just another day right it's not different than the day before right and even with christmas although we made a big deal about christmas.
 There was often this undercurrent that it's much to do about nothing i mean of course we'd acknowledge it's the remembrance of the birth of our savior but generally speaking.
 you know it felt like we would play the game of celebrating but there wasn't a real undercurrent of chain you enjoy and rejoicing and that would spill over into.
 Anniversary so somehow i realized i've got to the stage in life where it's father's day i wake up really with no expectation of being celebrated i'm thinking that the kids are gonna make me some.
 Crap a little hand on cards you know which they did and you're probably not gonna have made any plans.
 and i don't care you know it's not like i'm was me i'm not feeling celebrated but
 we'll just kind of get through the day but
 then i go to church and i realize everyone everyone is like ai alan happy
 father's day hey i'm getting texts and
 you know people who are just saying hey thank you you know you've been a
 spiritual father to me thank you for what you do hey i love watching you parent
 your kids and and i'm just surrounded by a culture that is really celebrating
 and you know jeff is cutting short his message that people can take their
 dads out and meeting people's dads who've come to church with us and i'm just
 like, "What's wrong with this picture?" And I'm realizing the depth of my value on the
 day is really, really shallow.
 Right.
 Which, as I've said before, I don't, you know, it's neither here nor there. It doesn't...
 I'm not saying this out of South Pity. I was like, "Oh, I want to be celebrated." But
 then I began to think, "What am I writing on my kid's hearts?"
 Right.
 I'm actually in my efforts, or my non-efforts, because this applies to Mother's Day. When
 Mother's Day happens were equally as lax about anything because I don't think...
 You sort of figured out in the car on the way home from church.
 Yeah, great.
 Do you want to go somewhere and don't get food?
 I guess so.
 Right.
 Which doesn't feel special to you either.
 But again, I think we don't care.
 We both probably had a similar sort of upbringing where it's like, I mean, you had enough trauma
 in going on in your life that...
 Yeah, I don't remember any Father's Day or Mother's Day.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 is I'm thinking about what am I teaching my kids? I'm teaching my kids something that's completely
 contrary to my values. Because if I stop and if you were to say, Hey, Alan, our moms and dads
 important, I'm like, yeah, they're super important. Like, Hey, have you been impacted by your mom
 and dad? Yeah, I'm the man I am because of my mom. You know, when you take a step back, you're
 thinking, it's actually a really big deal. Right. And I'm realizing that I've because I've never
 replaced a value on the day, the subtext is I'm not really placing a value on the role.
 So we had a conversation just thinking, I actually don't want my kids growing up and
 assuming the role of a mother and a father as a valueless role.
 Yes.
 I mean, it has inherent value because you see kids, but there's something about pausing
 and having an external honor added to you that helps along the journey of life.
 Yeah.
 And I thought, I'm teaching my kids not to celebrate.
 Yeah, yeah, I think that's, I think it's good.
 I think we'll both have to percolate on what that looks like in the future and what we want
 to make that look like.
 I mean, I think that's definitely the thing that has sort of slapped us in the face as
 it were the most in moving to the United States is the whole thing of celebration.
 And that Americans love to celebrate.
 And as I said, you know, I've said this several times to begin with, I was like, oh, come on,
 like this is.
 Again, this is about money or this is about whatever,
 but I realized actually my heart isn't good at celebrating.
 But Jesus is great at celebrating
 and the father loves to celebrate his kids.
 And so I actually need an adjustment.
  </li><li>I remember when we did Danny Silk's premarital class.
 He talked about this concept of defining new normals.
 Talk about that,
 'cause I thought that was a brilliant point that Danny made.
 Well, he talks about everybody comes into marriage,
 like when they first get married with their own normal.
 So, you know, you have a normal that this is what lunches
 look like and dinners look like,
 and this is what family gatherings look like,
 and this is what Sundays look like,
 and this is what, you know,
 everybody has their set of normals.
  </li><li>Like, for example, dessert with every meal.
  </li><li>That's right, well, that was definitely one
 of your normals, that I was like,
 what is your problem?
 We had dessert like two weeks ago,
 and why are you asking me every meal for dessert?
  </li><li>'Cause it was a normal in my life.
 Growing up we had dessert with every single meal,
 including breakfast.
  </li><li>I know, I know.
 I didn't figure it out until we actually went home
 for a visit and I realized, wow,
 I'm being served dessert with every meal.
 This is so strange.
 And then I was like, oh, this is why he keeps going.
 There's no dessert, there's no dessert.
 And I'm like, it's not your birthday,
 why would you have dessert?
 Yeah, it's alarming when you run headlong into your spouse's family's normals.
 You're like, "Oh, that's how you guys do it in this house.
 Okay, full contact, I understand."
 So, yeah, I mean, we had a whole bunch of new normals to form together because,
 you know, I like some of my normals. You probably like some of yours,
 but it's way more fun as a family to just sort of sit down and go, "Hey,
 What do we want our normals to be for our kids?
 Right. And that's the fun part, realizing, oh, we're not stuck with these normals.
 We get to choose what comes into our family.
 Right. We can glean from the best of them, but we can make up new ones.
 And then we get to be intentional in crafting ones that will become the norm for our future
 generations, hopefully. Right. So we have some new normals to create around Mother's Day and
 Father's Day. And just celebrating in general. Yeah.
 I mean, sadly, I think even to our kids' birthdays, I think you do an amazing job of making the kids' birthdays fun.
 But I tend to opt out the whole experience because I'm just like, it's noisy, it's expensive, it's tiring.
 And I'm like, "Oh, wait, what's wrong with that? You know, there's something wrong with that."
 Right.
 Right.
 I think their birthdays are probably the only thing I am good at celebrating.
 because I'm quite intentional about what they want to look like and making sure that they feel like they were heard and they're loved by whatever it looks like, whatever the theme is that time or whatever.
 But I'm also really happy when the day is over because I'm usually exhausted.
 And I still think like I'm usually trying to get through the event rather than really enjoying the event.
 Yeah, but I think that's necessary.
 Like I think your love and your care for the event is evident in the planning of the preparation.
 And then it's like a war zone.
 I mean, you put 20 small children in a room.
 Right.
 You don't have time to enjoy the event.
 It's not about you.
 It's about you getting through with your sanity and chanting,
 "Thou shall not kill those shall not kill."
 We're just thinking about, "Oh, at seven o'clock, everybody's going to bed.
 I'm going to sit down and drink wine."
 I'm loving watching our kids become very dominant in their life languages.
 So, you know, both of us are high shapers, so we love plans.
 And I'm watching both Abigail and Tia, nine and seven speak the
 shaper language very fluently.
 Yes, they regularly want to know the plan.
 What is the plan?
 And then when we tell them the plan, they recap the plan to us like a good
 shaper.
 So you are saying we are going to church.
 We are not having snack at the break.
 Then we're going to church again.
 Then we're going to go out to Chipotle.
 Then we're going to go to see Finding Dory.
 Then we're going to go home and we can play.
 Then we're going to have dinner and then I can have some play time before bed.
 We are saying that and we'll be tied you if you deviate from that plan.
 That's true.
 Yeah.
 If we had to make a switch, then we basically have to negotiate with terrorists.
 But even with the house move, Abigail understands that there's a because of the two different days
 that we're closing on this house that we're selling.
 And a couple of days later, the house that we're buying, she's like, well, then where are we going
 going to live. And so every couple of days, she's like, have you started out where we're
 living yet? And I'm like, Oh, honey, that you don't need to worry about it. She's like,
 I'm not worried. I'm just interested. She wants to know the plan. She loves to know the
 plan. Yeah. MJ too, though, is the same. He'll, he'll say, I'll be like, baby, it's almost
 time for bed. And he's like, do I have three minutes to play? Do I have five minutes to
 play? No, he doesn't actually understand timing. He doesn't. Because I said, you have 50 minutes
 to play. And he goes, Oh, mommy, can't I have three? So he thinks three is more. So I
 I think, yeah, baby, you can keep asking to set timers.
 Yeah.
 So he says, you know, Alexa, set a timer for three minutes.
 You know, he wants he wants his chunks of time.
 Yeah, it's adorable.
 With this whole thing of what kind of normals do we want or in what areas are we
 not good at celebrating this weekend?
 We watched a video by Pastor Stephen Furtick who passes elevation church.
 It's the church, my sister and brother-in-law's family go to which is how we got
 with them. And he had a great little vignette, a 30 minute video that we watched. But one of
 the lines he said that really stood out to us, he said, is what isn't healed as handed down?
 Yeah. And I thought, I don't want to hand down my apathy. I don't want to hand down my
 cynicism. I actually want to hand down really good things to my kids.
 I don't want to hand it down either. I was thinking too, you know, like most of what
 Stephen was speaking about was it was sort of on the topic of racism, but
 You know, I don't want to hand down an ability to celebrate good things
 Because I think it sucks life out of great moments, you know, so there's there's lots of stuff that I
 I felt challenged like oh, yeah, I don't want to hand that down
 Which means I probably need to make sure that I'm allowing the Holy Spirit to heal that part as with everything
 we talked about this week, we'll put links to everything we've talked about in the show
 notes. If you want to listen to any of those messages, we'll put links to. But we've got
 some questions for you as we finish this topic and move in our listeners' questions.
 So the first one would be, how is your heart at celebrating?
 Yeah, if you were to have a celebrate ometer, which patent pending is coming soon, you know,
 how good are you celebrating? And think about how good are you celebrating others? Maybe
 you're great, but are you good at being celebrated?
 Yeah.
 Second question is what normals do you want to change about your life?
 Even if you're not married, even if you don't have kids, what are the normals that
 you've inherited because you're not stuck with them?
 You can choose to upgrade them or change them or delete them any time you want.
 Right.
 That's a good one to journal about because sometimes we're not even aware of what
 our normals are.
 Right.
 Like it's not normal for you to have catch up with every single food group.
 You weirdo.
 Yeah, that's really strange.
 And finally, who is the person in your life whose words are big in your ears?
 Yeah, who are you positioning to receive instruction from?
 Yeah, you don't want to be a lone wolf out there.
 You want to have people that can speak into your heart and speak into your life
 because actually that's what causes you to grow.
 All right, it's time for a listeners question.
 All right.
 We're gonna listen to questions, Jingle.
 I didn't mean right now.
 I'm in in the future.
 Okay.
 Mm hmm.
 So here's the question.
 Um, this person says, I want to know what is the difference between gossip and slander.
 Also, if you feel the conviction of the Holy Spirit that you have engaged in gossip or
 slander of a leader, and if you respond by repenting from it, will you still reap negative
 fruit from it?
 I personally believe in the law of sewing and reaping. Is that still in effect, even if you repent
 and ask God to forgive you and cleanse you by the blood of Jesus?
 That's a great question. I'm going to do the dictionary definition thing, because I was like,
 what is the difference between Gossip and slander? Are they synonymous terms? Gossip is casual or
 unconstrained conversation or reports about other people, typically involving details that are not
 confirmed as being true. Slander, on the other hand, is a false and malicious spoken statement
 that is damaging to someone's reputation. Basically, slander is gossip. Gossip is the umbrella term
 for, I would say, negative speech about somebody. Here's what's interesting about slander,
 though. Derek Prince, who, to this day, still remains one of my favorite Bible teachers ever.
 He taught that the Greek word that we find in our New Testament, this rendered devil,
 literally means slanderer. Wow. Right. Right. And so Revelation 12, we were told that the
 devil is the accuser of the brethren. He's somebody who's constantly going around accusing
 God's people. And Derek's point was that every time we slander about another Christian leader
 or another Christian brother or sister, what we're actually doing is the devil's work for him.
 And I was like, when you put it in that phrase, I'm not sure I want to agree with the devil about
 and a thing. Right. Absolutely not. And as far as the law of sewing and reaping goes,
 it's in effect and it's only actually broken by the blood of Jesus.
 Right. So the great news is that anything that you sow, you have to reap unless you confess it
 as sin and you ask the Lord to forgive you. So I would always check in with the Holy Spirit and
 just be like, "Okay, hey, is there anything that you need to bring to my mind that I've done wrong
 so that you can actually repent of those things and see any cycle of sewing and reaping actually
 get broken. Because your words of your mouth, they're very powerful. And you really want the words
 of your mouth and the meditation of your heart to be pleasing to the Lord. So I would say, of course,
 the cycle can be broken because the cross has broken that cycle, but you need to appropriate that
 by actually repenting and inviting the Lord into the process.
 Yeah, one of my favorite verses, the one who just quoted Psalm 19 verse 14,
 "That whole thing of me, the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart,
 be pleasing in your sight, O Lord, of my rock, and my redeemer."
 If I find that I'm telling a story that is not helpful and the Holy Spirit's like,
 like that happened to me this week, I'm realizing, I'm having a conversation,
 I'm like, "Oh, actually, I'm being negative about this person."
 and the Holy Spirit is like, really? Is that what you want to be? Stop right there. I would rather
 appear the worst storyteller in the world than finish a story that's negative about somebody else.
 I'd rather appear foolish than I would be dishonoring. And so the Holy Spirit is so good at being like
 this filter on your mouth and on your mind. And just going, "No, no, no, no." But absolutely,
 the law of song and reaping. And we did a podcast on this a while back. So if you're like, what
 is the law of sewing and reaping you speak of? You can listen to it to allenonagia.com/85.
 It explains the whole thing. But yeah, the law of song and reaping is this impartial thing that
 will keep going. But where you're reaping negative fruit, you can absolutely confess it to sin.
 Just say, Jesus, I read that I've been doing this. Would you forgive me of that sin? And would you
 cut down any fruit trees in my life that's producing bad fruit as a result of my bad choices.
 That's one of the things he does. He's brilliant about it.
 So I hope that helps. Slander and gossip are pretty much the same thing. Gossip is the umbrella
 term under which slander fits. Absolutely. If you feel the conviction of the Holy Spirit,
 respond to it immediately and you will be free from the effects of it just because
 that's what Jesus does. He's amazing. He makes everything new.
 So we finally have a boy named Ben back in stock.
 Yeah.
 It's properly printed.
 And you worked very hard with our publishers and that, babe.
 Thank you.
 And you exercised tremendous patience as you went back and forth with them.
 It was a very frustrating process.
 But here we are.
 And so if you have bought it, look for an email that tells you how to replace the one
 that you have received if there is a printing error.
 And if you'd like to buy a copy, then just head on over to alan and AJ.com/ben.
 And if you want to show notes for this episode, head over to alan and AJ.com/107.
 And we would really love your prayers. We've got a busy couple of weeks coming up. We're moving
 in a week and a half, two weeks. And so we've got a lot to get done. We want to have some sanity.
 So your prayers would be especially welcome in this season.
 And if you can just, as you're praying, if you can pray that the kids don't feel any of the stress or pressure of the move, that would be sort of my number one.
 Right.
 That it would feel fun to them.
 I mean, that's sort of my goal is to make it like, "Hey guys, we're camping in our house."
 You know, but to make it fun so that they don't feel in the stress.
 Have a great week.
 Yeah.
