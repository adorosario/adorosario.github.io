<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones. - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>How the heck are you?
  </li><li>I'm so good.
  </li><li>I like that I'm in a short sleeve shirt
 'cause it's roasting down here
 and you're in a cable knit sweater.
  </li><li>It is not roasting down here.
 It is, I think I dressed in the sweater for being upstairs,
 where the air conditioning is booming at like Arctic levels.
  </li><li>Well that's just 'cause we got it back.
 We, so last week you probably saw a post on Instagram,
 Facebook, Twitter, wherever, that we just said,
 hey, we're taking a week off.
 It was a rough week for a number of reasons.
 Our nation was on fire, but for us, particularly,
 we actually tried to take vacation two weeks ago.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Two weeks ago we went camping, which is always fun,
 except we discovered this thing that when we're camping,
 there's no point in sending the kids to bed
 at their normal hour because.
  </li><li>They don't go to sleep.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, it's too bright.
  </li><li>It's too bright. - So we let them stay up
  </li><li>So like nine, nine, 30, at which point we realized
 we haven't had any time to connect.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So we usually step to like midnight, 12, 30.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then we forget that the sun gets up at like five,
 30 and we're awake.
 And so a little bit tired from that.
 And then on our last night, it was easily--
  </li><li>The most epic storm ever.
  </li><li>Most impressive thunderstorm I have ever been in.
  </li><li>Yes, and we're in a tent.
  </li><li>And we're in a tent, thunder, lightning,
 like colossal peels of thunder.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I didn't realize we shouldn't be in a tent
 when there's a lightning storm.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I realized that we're surrounded by trees.
 We're gonna be fine.
 I mean, we fall in the--
  </li><li>But the kids all ended up in our cots
 because it was so loud and they were so scared.
 And it was pretty scary, like it was really loud.
  </li><li>And it poured,
 trentially, for two hours, so it didn't pass.
 All that saying, by the end of two weeks ago,
 we could barely keep our eyes open.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Only to come home and find,
 well, when we left our air conditioning
 in the downstairs was broken.
 Now, if you're not from America,
 let me just say this.
 If you're in Britain, you don't need air conditioning, right?
 Because it rarely gets warm enough.
 And if it does, you just open the windows.
 And if it's cold, you use your gas central heating,
 which warms one part of your wall.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 But here in the summer, we're often
 it's like 100% humidity.
 And--
 You can get epically hot.
 Really, really hot.
 You need air conditioning.
 And so our downstairs unit broke.
 We went camping, so it didn't really care.
 It got fixed while we were away.
 No, it got fixed the day we got back.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then the next day we woke up to find
 that our upstairs unit had died.
  </li><li>I broke it, yeah.
  </li><li>And it took six days to get some of that,
 'cause that weekend I think was the benchmark,
 the opening of summer or something like that.
 Every air conditioning engineer was overwhelmed.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So for six days, our upstairs was completely uninhabitable.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was 97 degrees upstairs, one of the days.
  </li><li>35, 36 and Celsius.
  </li><li>Oh, it's so hot.
  </li><li>I mean, it was just stifling.
 So now we've got air conditioning fixed almost.
 Our upstairs unit is still not fixed yet.
  </li><li>It's not yet, but by next week it will be.
 And right now--
  </li><li>But downstairs is nice and nice and cool.
 So I'm generally speaking--
  </li><li>You're often sitting?
  </li><li>Well, I like things being cold
 and you like things being hot.
  </li><li>Yes, all the children are saying,
 it's so cold in here.
 And I'm like, this is great.
  </li><li>I'm like, shut it.
 Which, to explain, as you're thinking of,
 horribly aggressive father, it was Tia's birthday yesterday.
  </li><li>Yes.
 birthday, she decided that she went daddy to speak in a Scottish accent.
 But I've forgotten how to speak in a Scottish accent, even though right now I'm probably
 still have a Scottish accent.
 If you're an American accent, if you're used to hearing an American accent, mine does not
 sound like an American accent.
 If you're listening to this in your Scotland, I know I don't have a Scottish accent anymore.
 Have this weird hybrid American thing.
 Anyway, I couldn't remember how to speak Scottish.
 So all I did was quote Mike Myers from So I Married an Axomer.
 would just say shut it and you caught me bird a lot. I don't
 eat but yeah, so that's where that came from. So anyway, that's a
 quick recap on our week. We hope your two weeks have been
 amazing. I hope that you are doing well. We are journeying
 through. And we're at our last feeling. Yep, we have finally
 made it to glad the one that everybody wishes that was the
 only feeling available. Yeah, as soon as we like whenever we
 teach this and put it up on the screen, everyone's like, why is
 there only one good one? Today, we're talking about the one good
  </li><li>Yeah. - I've got some fear to use my feelings.
 I've got some fear about talking, about gladness.
  </li><li>Why? - My fear is everyone's been waiting
 for the good one and I fear that they're not gonna be happy
 when they hear it's not as good as they might think about it.
  </li><li>But I think we've already established that they're all good.
 They all have a purpose and they all have a gift.
 So hopefully by now you've listened to the previous seven feelings
 and you realize they're all good
 and so maybe can that alleviate some of your fear?
 Yeah, but still, like, let's do a quick survey.
 Hey, baby.
 Yeah.
 Today is Saturday.
 Would you like to feel sad all day or would you like to feel glad all day?
 They're both good.
 Well, yeah.
 Okay.
 Like, so my point is like we're hardwired to want like good things.
 Yeah.
 And the more and more we, as soon as we start talking about glad,
 there's going to be temptation to go, that's glad.
 But bear with us because glad is beautiful and glad is great.
 Okay.
 So I probably already hinted at this in my little fear preamble, but being glad is
 not about being happy.
 Right.
 But I think you probably already know this,
 but the word happiness actually comes
 from the word happenstance.
 And so it has a lot to do with our circumstances,
 you know, more than our reality.
  </li><li>Right, so happiness is about how things are going for us.
 The circumstances around us dictating the level
 of okay that we feel.
 That's not glad.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Gladness is not about circumstance.
 Gladness is basically about two things.
 Gladness is about desiring deeply and being willing to endure pain for that desire to come to fruition.
  </li><li>This sounds very fun. - Exactly.
  </li><li>Being able to endure pain, but you just were like, "And we're good. Peace out, folks. I gotta go."
  </li><li>I don't need this on my Monday. - That's right.
  </li><li>I thought my fear. - That was my fear. - I thought my fear was gonna be epic.
  </li><li>Okay, so that's my fear right there. Basically about two things.
 It's about desiring really, really deeply and being willing to endure pain
 Okay. To see that desire be met.
 Okay.
 But it gets worse than that.
 Oh no.
 Yeah, because your gladness isn't dependent on that desire being met.
 Okay.
 So you could go through all that pain.
 Still not have your desire be met and still have gladness.
 Right.
 So this is why I like welcome to the club.
 We've got jackets.
 It's better than you think it is, but it's worse than you thought it was.
 Oh, sorry.
 So that's what I'm tuning in for glad going like, Oh, praise God.
 Like we've endured the other seven.
 And finally, we get to the eighth one.
 And then they just hear, it's like,
 it's about keeping your heart open for desire
 and enduring pain.
 And even if you don't get it, that's still gladness.
 This is what I signed up for.
 So it's like way worse, but as we keep talking,
 you'll realize, oh, it's so much better than you think it.
 So stay with us.
  </li><li>Yeah, yep.
 So babe, explain how gladness still shows up
 even if we don't get what we're desiring.
  </li><li>Right.
 Well, the gladness is all about actually having a heart
 that is full enough to risk desire.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And the process of enduring pain
 and reaching for that thing that you desire
 is about, you can only do that if you live fully.
 And so the gladness comes from actually
 purposes in your heart that I am gonna live fully.
 Like I think, I remember listening to Graham Cook once
 and he just said, "It doesn't matter.
 "How many times I'm stabbed in the back.
 "How many times I'm rejected.
 "How many times I'm isolated.
 "How many times I'm lied about.
 "I refuse to step back from community.
 "I refuse to step back from living
 "because then I go in a prison."
 And that's what we're talking about.
 Like circumstances would say,
 nobody has to treat me poorly.
 I get everything that I want.
 I can sit my ties by the beach.
 I can eat ice cream all day and never put on weight.
 And then I will be glad, aka happy.
 And it's not that now.
 To be sure, will you feel glad if you have a big desire,
 you endure pain and you get that desire?
 For sure.
 But the amazing thing about gladness is,
 gladness will show up even if you love fully, live fully
 and don't get what you were actually desiring for,
 there will still be gladness in the pursuit of that thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's one of those crazy things about life
 that's true that sounds horrible on paper,
 but is what makes living full-heartedly.
 That sounded quite Scottish,
 living full-heartedly, a joy.
 As horrible as it may seem,
 gladness is not about outcomes, it's about living fully.
  </li><li>Yeah, Chip talks about that a lot
 in his chapter on gladness.
 Gladness comes to those who know
 and persistently pursue their hearts desires.
 To find gladness, we need to be vulnerable
 to our hearts intentions and pursue desires
 that we know in our hearts to be true,
 noble, right, pure, lovely, admirable, or excellent.
 Knowing our hearts intentions and desires
 requires feeling fully.
 For every feeling identifies our needs
 and illuminates our desires.
 gladness then is a result of our willingness to feel the other seven feelings.
 So basically if gladness is not about outcomes, but about living fully,
 then we're actually never going to get there to that fully living without
 feeling all seven feelings.
 The other seven feelings and also feel gladness.
 You're right.
 Which is why now for the second time people are like, and we're done.
 Don't stay with us.
 Stay.
 I promise.
 Okay.
 So let's say I'm prepared to feel all my other seven feelings.
 Yes.
 And I am going to now, I'm going to feel glad too.
 Yeah.
 What is the gift of glad?
 Right.
 So remember, every we've been talking about, if you're willing to feel a feeling,
 there's a gift and a feeling.
 The gift of glad.
 Yes.
 Is joy with sadness.
 Well, that sounds awful.
 You're like, can I have just a joy and hold the side of sadness?
 Please.
 You know, like you're ordering.
 Yeah.
 Can you hold the mustard? Yeah. Yeah. Hold this sadness. Yeah. Now, ask me why does sadness have to show up?
 So why does sadness have to show up? Well, gladness can only appear in our lives if we're willing to accept life on life's terms.
 Yes. That's another Chippism, right? So, Chip talks about like living life on life's terms, which, by the way, is the only way.
 And what what I think he means by that or when I think about living life on life's terms, I'm talking about like life is replete with a bunch of things, like mystery.
 Like that's honestly what we're walking through as a nation, as we're walking through as a church.
 Like in our team meetings, we've been talking about, like in our church, Jeff Dollar, our senior pastor,
 has spent the last six months talking about faith.
 And then the coronavirus starts up and we're shut down.
 And so like, what is our response as the church to care for people, but also move in faith?
 And you know, it's mystery.
 Yes.
 It's filled with tragedy.
 It's filled with heartache, but it's also filled with reunion and glory and potential and goodness and sadness and birth and death and memories and you only get memories when something is lost.
 You know, it's just this collage of stuff.
 And if you're going to live life's own life's terms, you have to accept that all of those are coming your way.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 And I think sometimes, I mean, I think I've definitely had this conversation with several sort of newer believers,
 where they're like, well, I don't understand.
 I gave my life to the Lord and I still have things to deal with.
 And then there's still sad things and there's still hard things.
 And I was, I was like, we're never promised
 that it's going to be any different than that.
 It's just that you're going through it with somebody else hand in hand, you know.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 So I mean, life is full and it's full of lots of stuff that we probably don't want.
 Uh, and it's full of lots of stuff that we do want, but still, babe,
 You haven't actually told me why sadness accompanies joy and gladness.
 Okay. So let me give you a really practical example.
 Something you do every single morning.
 Okay.
 You pick up your phone.
 Yes.
 You open up that dumb app with a dinosaur on it.
 What's it called?
 Yes.
 A time hop.
 Now, did you see her face?
 If you watched a video, she just she didn't know where I'm going because she
 hasn't seen the notes for this week.
 I talk about time hop.
 What do you feel when you look through your photos and time hop?
 Oh, so much joy.
 And some sadness.
 Yeah.
 So you scroll through Timehop, for those of you don't know what Timehop is,
 it's an app that periodically shows you, hey, four years ago on this day,
 you posted this picture to Facebook or Instagram.
 So you scroll through Timehop and you might see a picture of like the kids.
 Yeah, I mean, I mostly just post pictures of the kids or food.
 OK, but also like the stuff you've posted to Instagram, so like dinner with friends.
 So like you might go, oh, I remember having dinner with that person.
 And the gladness of remembering dinner and then the sadness that I'm not in
 relationship with anymore because they passed away. Yeah. Or they live really far away. Or most often you look at the kids and
 there's joy at the kids sadness. They're no longer that age. Yes, right?
 It's not that you don't want them to be who they are today, but you look at me go
 Oh, I remember when MJ was three and he said we go beach. Yeah, I want go beach. What is it that you want to do?
 You want to go to the beach? Yeah, go beets. Can I tell you something?
 Yeah, we live in Nashville. There's no beach here
 Get dressed and go to the beach
 Yeah, and you're like oh, it's so doorless not that you're wishing that you didn't have your seven-year-old version of that
 But you're longing for a day gone by that you can no longer have back and there's oh getting teared up
 There's gladness about that, but there's also sadness that that's gone
 Yeah, that makes complete sense to me.
 And so that that that completeness of the joy with sadness is what gladness is all about. Excuse me for whatever reason
 I'm feeling really glad and it's making my eyes water. I think I'm allergic to gladness.
 Yeah, that's probably what it is.
 We have got friends who have either gone through empty nester phase or are in empty nester phase
 and they've got the joy that their kids made it through their teenage years without them killing them.
 them. All right. Enjoy that they've got into university or joy that they're getting married
 and moving out. Yeah. But sadness at that era of life that they're no longer living in
 their home is anymore. Yeah. There's gladness. Yay. And there's sadness as well. Think about
 graduation. We just did graduation for our S.O.S.L. or I, personalizing, I remember graduating
 from university this gladness. I have accomplished them like four years of hard work like ah. And
 And then the sadness of leaving all of my friends
 and everything that's familiar behind
 and not knowing what's going in,
 but the gladness of what's coming.
 Think about moving here.
 Like the gladness of a new adventure of moving to America,
 which was one of both of our heart's desires.
  </li><li>Yeah, but the sadness of leaving behind our family
 and friends and church and, you know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So that's what we're talking about life on life terms.
 Did we feel glad boarding that plane in Toronto Pearson
 to land here?
 Absolutely.
 And what was in there, joy about what was set before us,
 but sadness about what we're leaving behind.
 So that's why sadness always shows up.
 Anytime you find joy,
 you're gonna find sadness nestled in around them.
 And again, because sadness is not bad,
 that shouldn't surprise us.
 But the temptation to only have joy without sadness
 is what we're gonna talk about later
 when we come to the impairment.
  </li><li>Okay, I think that makes sense, babe.
 I think when you're thinking about as Christians,
 our biggest source of joy
 is that we have peace with God.
 But we also recognize that that peace came
 at the cost of Jesus' life.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So there's joy with sadness.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you get acutely aware,
 like I don't think it was until the passion of Christ
 when you're watching the loss of Jesus' life
 and what he went through.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Do you get in touch with the sadness?
 Like I went through years of communion
 in the little brethren assembly I grew up in
 going, why is there ever been so miserable?
 And they're miserable because they're proclaiming
 Jesus is death until he comes.
 Like there's that weekly reminder,
 at least the way we did it growing up,
 weekly reminder on the communion table of like,
 "Ah, what I have, I got for free,
 "but it cost you everything."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Joy was sadness.
 I mean, it talks about, you know,
 for the joy set before him he endured the cross.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So that's, that is why sadness shows up.
 That makes sense.
  </li><li>It totally makes sense.
 So babe, if we don't want to pay the price of, you know,
 joy with sadness. We don't want to pay this sadness part. So we're just like, no, I'm going to skip it. I'm not going to feel this. What's the impairment?
 The impairment of gladness is this really clunky phrase that Chip uses called central pleasure without heart.
 Central pleasure without heart.
 It's trying to manufacture the feeling of glad without paying the price of feeling the other feelings.
 Wow. Okay.
 Basically what we would call in our previous teachings, you know, in the orphan spirit and stuff like that,
 counterfeit affections. So the human form is amazing at managing to twist anything into idolatry.
 So it's basically trying to get away from the feelings with stimulus that feels good.
 And that could be anything, shopping, alcohol, sex, pornography, hard work, hyper religious activity,
 video games books, hiking, running anything.
 hide and try and produce like a counterfeit feeling better.
  </li><li>How do you be present without your heart and feel good?
 It's the birthplace of addiction.
 It's sensuality without heart.
 It's like I want to, as Chip says,
 lift fully without having to pay the price of living fully.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I'm acutely aware, for example,
 when I get a new video game that's brand new,
 that's unexplored territory,
 there is something beautiful about getting lost,
 like stepping away from the responsibilities of my life,
 the craziness of the world,
 and like right now I'm trying to cross breed flowers
 in Animal Crossing.
 I'm trying to build, I'm trying to breed a blue rose.
 So right now, it feeds so much of my personality,
 like, oh, I get to do research and I get to optimize
 and then I get to build and I know it takes time
 but there's hacks. - And you have to set this up
 before this. - Because I can time travel,
 wait, I can get other people in and I've got a goal
 that's gonna be achievable and I know I can do,
 And I'm aware that when I'm doing that,
 oh, it just lets me escape from all of my responsibilities.
 And there is a certain goodness of that.
 That's why we have hobbies.
 I'm also aware, oh, I could live in there
 and refuse to live out here.
 And that's when I stepped over in a danger zone.
 And like I said, as humans, we're really, really good
 at making ideals out of anything.
 So, and it's not just the bad stuff.
 Anything can become bad.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like our cell phones.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 trigger finger muscle memory for, do I have an email?
 Do I have an email?
 I'm looking for stimulus.
 And there's a danger that we settle for that instead of
 wanting to live fully from the heart.
 Anything you want to talk about?
 Like, as we're walking in the light,
 I've talked a little bit about video games.
 I mean, I could just bring up my Amazon purchase
 here, anything you want to talk about?
  </li><li>I could also, I could relate to the video game thing.
 I haven't gotten quite as much into that one
 as when we got Zelda.
 I totally hid in Zelda for months, just like,
 oh, I can disconnect and hide and not feel anything
 and just be in this place and whatever.
 But I've recently started reading again, fiction.
 And so I've realized you're playing the video game,
 like when we're having those super stressful days
 or whatever, it's like, oh, we both sort of hit our max
 and go, all right, you're gonna play video game.
 and I'm gonna read.
  </li><li>But also like when we're on vacation,
 that's where we would like veer to.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I think what I'm encouraging people to hear is like,
 you could hear this and think, okay, so anything I do,
 like there's a thin line between self-care
 and falling into idolatry.
 And I think part of the feelings work
 gives you more awareness of what your heart's doing.
 I think previously I wouldn't have had the awareness
 to know what is happening.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yes.
 I think, when I think back to the Zelda season, for example.
  </li><li>Yeah, oh, the sweet Zelda season.
  </li><li>The sweet Zelda season.
  </li><li>When I ran through the fields in Hyrule and, yep, go on.
  </li><li>So, I mean, for me, I'd never been into a video game
 before. - Ever.
 In fact, you despised them.
  </li><li>I did.
 And so for me, there was a lot of paying attention
 because I didn't even know how to make the buttons,
 do different things and all that kind of stuff.
 but I did know I was using it as an escape.
 Like I literally was like,
 I'm gonna go play Zelda for an hour.
 I cannot think about anything else while playing Zelda
 because I have to focus on the buttons.
 And I remember making an intentional choice
 that saying I'm gonna set aside this time
 or I'm gonna go play, you know, because I can't.
 Because I can escape.
 And I think it's okay to escape,
 but I mean, I recognized what I was doing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But then it can become like,
 oh, actually it's so much easier to escape than to feel.
 And I think that's when it becomes--
  </li><li>Danger zone.
  </li><li>Danger zone.
 Like not, I'm choosing to do something that is like--
  </li><li>Kind to my heart.
  </li><li>Kind to my heart and I get to disconnect for a bit
 or whatever, I think that's fine.
 It's more when it's now become the only way
 that we're coping with life is I will escape
 to this video game or I will escape to these books
 or I will escape to Netflix or I'll escape to, you know,
 and in order to not feel.
  </li><li>And it's easy to vilify,
 like especially in our culture,
 Christian culture I'm talking about,
 it's easy to vilify the bad things.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right?
 So we've got like, and depending on your church background,
 depending on what you've been brought up in,
 like we have a list of what's really bad.
 The danger is when what we're using
 for central pleasure without a heart
 is not only acceptable but rewarded.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So evangelism, witnessing, hyper-religious activity,
 you know, going through your, your prayer list. Like anything that we're doing to take control of our
 powerlessness is an attempt to run life. And a lot, you're not going to reach gladness till you realize how
 little control you have over what goes on in life. Yeah. That kind of makes me think about that season. And
 we've talked about it before. I've taught about it, but the whole Martha Plexi thing. Yeah, go talk about your
 Martha Plexi addiction.
 You know, I, I had a long season, particularly at the beginning of the renewal, uh,
 where because I was way more of a human doing explain the renewal, because you've
 got people, I forget that it was 1994 when it happened.
 And you got people listening to this podcast who weren't even born.
 So paint the picture of what renewal looked like.
 So in 1994, uh, the Holy Spirit showed up in a very powerful way, uh, in the
 church in Toronto where I went and we started seeing amazing things, you know,
 miracles, miracles and marriages, healings, all kinds of stuff.
 But you're having church meetings every single night.
 Every single night.
 And there's no discussion about what you and your friend group are doing.
 Right.
 And at this time, there's no, there's no real internet.
 If it were to happen now, it'd be a totally different scenario.
 But people were coming from literally all over the world to this little church
 at the end of the runway.
 And, you know, within the first couple of years,
 like it was like five or six million people that had come
 to just see what God was doing
 and to experience the Lord.
 And it was amazing, but in the midst of that,
 there was a tremendous opportunity for those of us
 that were like me who were a bit more,
 I was more of a human doing than a human being.
  </li><li>You were a Martha Plactic.
  </li><li>I was a Martha Plactic.
 And I earned affirmation by serving.
 I didn't actually know how to receive affirmation
 from the father at all.
 And I really didn't wanna deal with any of the big stuff
 in my heart.
 So my plan was stay as busy as you can all day long.
 And then you'll fall into bed exhausted
 and you won't have to think
 or deal with any of your emotions.
 Get up the next day.
  </li><li>Or be present with your heart.
  </li><li>Right, and do the exact same thing again.
 And so there was so much opportunity
 to do great spiritual things,
 but I recognize that that was one of the ways
 that I was actually hiding from my own emotions.
 And the Lord, in his kindness,
 after about, I think it was like eight or nine months,
 he called me on it.
 Just I remember being at this big meeting
 and being in worship and having my hands in the air,
 like just worshiping,
 like, and the Lord said to me, I want you to put your hands down.
 And the short version is he basically said, I don't want you to raise your
 hands above your heart until you understand that I want your heart and not
 your hands.
 And so that started a pretty difficult season for me for about two and a half
 years where I was trying to learn to not run.
 And, uh, you know, it was tricky.
 Because that was my, that was how I've always coped.
 Get busy.
 Right.
 Busy.
 Busy.
 Most acceptable drug today.
 Yeah.
 And it looks good.
 Mm hmm.
 Yeah.
 Your description is beautiful about the full spectrum of how we as humans can
 experience sensuality without heart.
 You know, we arrange our lives with busyness, with entertainment, with
 things that give us purpose without having to be present with our own hearts.
 Yeah.
 And that's the impairment of gladness.
 And the tragedies you miss out on gladness,
 you get the high from achieving things,
 but you're left with an emptiness after it happens.
 Of course, gladness is something
 that the Lord loves to give us.
 I mean, your relationship with the Lord,
 the by-product of that is gladness.
 Listen to this, this is from Psalm 4, verse seven and eight.
 "Says, you've put gladness in my heart
 more than when there are grain and new wine abound.
 In peace, I lie down and sleep for you alone, O Lord,
 make me dwell in safety.
  </li><li>I love that, babe.
 You have put gladness in my heart.
 God puts gladness in you.
  </li><li>More than when there's grain and new wine.
 So he's talking about, like,
 it's not dependent on happenstance.
  </li><li>It's not dependent on the season of abundance.
  </li><li>No, I, you know, we've talked about this a lot
 and we've joked about this,
 but there have been seasons of our marriage
 when we have had no money, less than no money.
 crippled and dead, no money, no seeming way out.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And at the same time, feeling like the wealthiest people
 in the world.
 Like I remember going to bed when I think in the Lord,
 I have like negative net worth.
 And I feel like the wealthiest person in the world.
 Because of the gladness that the Lord's putting our hearts.
 It's a beautiful, beautiful thing.
 I was laughing, I was looking through our notes
 about what we're gonna share today.
 And I realized, we have something at Grace Center,
 called Grace and her University.
 It's our continuing professional development for our staff.
 It's like once a month where our staff get together.
 And last year, I think I was teaching on feelings.
 And on the week that I was teaching about gladness,
 I was just looking through my notes and I realized
 the night as I was preparing to go speak on gladness,
 I'd lost my wallet, which happens a fair amount.
 But in this particular occasion,
 it was really, really stressful
 because you need your wallet for a lot.
 but what I needed my wallet for was on Friday.
 So this was Monday night, this was Tuesday night.
  </li><li>I remember this without you even having to prom me.
 I know exactly what you're talking about.
  </li><li>So Wednesday I'm gonna go speak on gladness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Friday, A.J. and I have our appointment
 with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
 to see whether it will be eligible
 to become United States citizens.
 And the first thing they require,
 to even get in the building is your driver's licenses.
 That's what it says, like please bring your driver's license.
 So on Tuesday night, I can't afford to look for my wallet
 because I've got to be present with preparing this
 so I can deliver something to our staff.
 And I'm aware that in my heart,
 I've got an opportunity to rage
 because I don't want to feel fear, right?
 So I could just rage and like,
 ah, you know, I'm really scared.
 I've got lots of toxic shame.
 Like why can't I be organized enough?
 Why, you know, can't find my wallet?
 And I can feel the panic rising.
 And then I remember, wait, I've got other options.
 I can actually feel those feelings without raging at AJ and the kids and without, you
 know, forecasting, just doom.
 I can just be with the Lord.
 I remember just quietening myself and being with the Lord going, Lord, I know you.
 Like I know what you're like.
 I know that you're a good father.
 I know that you're planning my goodness.
 And I know that either you will find my wallet for me or you will solve it another
 way.
 And the peace and the gladness that came wasn't dependent on me finding my wallet.
 It was just waste of a confidence that I have that my father is going to turn all things
 for good for me.
 Yes.
 I've got a trite record of it.
 Yeah.
 Just this 40 plus years of knowing that God has got my back and is either going to restore
 the situation or redeem the situation.
 Either way, I'm going to come out smelling like roses.
 And that was this beautiful thing where I was like, okay, I know what the old Allen would
 do.
 I'm loving feeling glad and the unlikeliest of circumstances.
 Now is your memory of that the same as my you telling of that story? Yeah, that's I mean
 I just knew that that's what you were gonna talk about because I remember you being like I
 Can't find my wallet and then like oh I have to actually do this thing in in the midst of I can't find my wallet
 And it's kind of a big deal, you know, so yeah, that's yeah
 I can't find my wallet right life on life's terms. I can't find it and I've got a good heavenly father
 Yeah, and he's gonna turn out now what happened
 And I don't even remember how it resolved itself other than I found it.
 I can't even remember.
 But we had it.
 Yeah, we had it.
 It wasn't a problem.
 But it was touching go for a couple of days.
 So babe, just I was just thinking talk about group this week because you know, I'm watching
 you come out of group and you've got puffy eyes, you've clearly been crying and looked
 like you, you know, had quite the ordeal.
 Yeah.
 And you were like, Oh, group was amazing.
 Yeah.
 So, let me talk a little bit about groups.
 Some of you know, I've been in group therapy for like two and a half years, I think,
 or maybe longer.
 I'm useless with dates.
 And this week was like a real gift for me.
 So you know, you keep confidence in group, but what I'm going to share is all about me
 and my experience.
 So I'm okay.
 But I remember that because we're doing group virtually because of COVID.
 So we're doing like group via video conferencing.
 I come out my office and I pad through to speak to agent.
 I mean, you're right.
 I was worn out.
 I feel like I had just wrestled a bear.
 Wasn't even sure if I won.
 My eyes were puffy because I've been crying
 for the better part of an hour.
 I mean, it just took out of me being in group.
 And you said, you know, I was group.
 And I don't know what you're expecting me to say,
 but I was like, oh, babe, I feel so glad.
 Like I had such a great group.
 And you were like, you're--
  </li><li>Tell your face.
  </li><li>Tell your face.
  </li><li>Tell your face, honey.
  </li><li>So what happened is on any given group,
 it's like whoever needs time gets it.
 And on this particular week, it was my week to, you know, I just said, Hey guys, I need some time.
 And I just started sharing and asking the men in my group for some feedback.
 And they were very brave and gave me feedback.
 Now, their feedback about a characteristic in my life and about a trait in my life and about how they experienced me.
 Honestly, some of it was really hard to hear.
 It was really, I was hurt hearing what they had to say.
 I was really sad.
 I was really frightened by some of the sweat they shared.
 I was frightened about not knowing how to fix what they were sharing.
 I had like toxic shame that that meant I wasn't doing a good job in group or I'm not good
 enough.
 And you know, so we just ran a huge roller coaster.
 But even after sitting with these men and they're giving me this brutal, real, honest
 feedback, which was hard to hear at times, I was left with this overwhelming sense of
 gladness because I got more of me from their feedback of me.
 Yes.
 Like so.
 And that's how it should be like that's the working like I felt all the other feelings and was left with glad joy with sadness.
 You know, joy about my, my shame, my healthy shame like joy that actually I have wonderful gifts and I have glorious limitations and that's okay.
 And we were focusing majorly on my limitations this week.
 And so it's hard to hear that you're limited, especially when we work or especially when I work so hard to minimize my limitations.
 and they're just like, "Hey, your limitations are going to show up no matter how much work
 you do about it."
 And we appreciate like you get an A for effort, but like what if it's not needed?
 Like what if all that work for you to minimize your limitations actually just makes us all
 feel lonelier with you than if you just accepted you had limitations?
 I was like, "I want to even show that was an option."
 And so I leave this week with just this tremendous gladness about being known and about being
 understood and in the process knowing these men more and understanding them and I think
 what I want to encourage is if you're waiting for your life to change until you can feel
 glad you've missed what gladness is about, you're seeking happiness to age's point,
 happenstance and you have the availability, you have the option of feeling glad right
 now without anything changing in your world which is a gift from God.
 Yes.
 It just requires that you're willing to open up your heart and feel the other feelings.
  </li><li>Yes, so good, babe.
  </li><li>So scary.
  </li><li>So scary.
 So that's the gift of gladness.
 So if you choose to feel your feelings,
 then the gift is joy with sadness.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And if you choose not to feel your feelings,
 then it's sensuality without heart.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's your impairment.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This was supposed to be a nine part series on feelings.
 Like when we started, we're like,
 okay, this should be like nine parts, easy.
 Like we'll do an introduction,
 and then we'll do the eight feelings that will be nine.
  </li><li>Yes.
 It's like it's going to be a 10 or 11 week series.
 Here's why.
 Next week, we're going to be talking about how you feel
 your feelings.
 So like we've covered the basics of all of the eight feelings.
 We've done our introduction.
 Next week, we're going to talk a little bit about what
 is some of the work that you can do to feel your feelings
 and what do you do with them?
 The week after, we're going to have the author of the book
 that we've been going through, Dr. Chip Dog.
 I'm so excited.
 He's going to be on the podcast.
 He's going to be answering your questions.
 If you've got questions you want to send in,
 send them to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask
 and we'll ask those questions about all of us.
 But I do wanna give you warning.
 So for many of you who've been enjoying the podcast,
 you've been watching them on YouTube,
 you've been watching them with video.
 In my opinion, it's the best way to enjoy them.
 Like we're such expression full.
 We, how do you say it?
 We've got faces you wanna look at.
  </li><li>We're expressive.
  </li><li>We're expressive.
  </li><li>We have faces, you wanna look at it?
  </li><li>Look at this money maker right here.
  </li><li>Check it out.
 But our videos are gonna be going away for the general public
 after we've done our feeling series,
 because our videos are a perk of being a patron
 of this podcast.
 A patron is just a good looking listener
 who's decided that they want to become part of the community
 they give from as little as a dollar an episode
 and then doing so, not only do you get access
 to all the videos going forward,
 you also get access to our archive of video shows too.
 And so I just wanna give you fair warning.
 We made them available to everybody doing the COVID pandemic
 when we started back up podcasting.
 But after we're finished with this series on feelings,
 it's gonna be audio only for the general public.
 And if you wanna become part of the patron community,
 you'll have access to all the videos.
  </li><li>To learn how to become a patron,
 go to <a href="mailto:allen@hj.com">allen@hj.com</a>/patron.
  </li><li>If you've been regular listeners of the podcast
 or you've been following us for a while,
 you know that we're huge fans of something called
 the School of Supernatural Life.
 It was a school that we helped found, helped build.
 Currently, teach on, in fact, you are the head honcho.
 What are you?
  </li><li>Yes, the head honcho.
 That's what it says in my badge.
  </li><li>You are the director of the School of Supernatural Life.
 And I just heard that the school has extended the deadline for applications.
 Yes.
 Tell us about that.
 So because of COVID and because of all the uncertainty and everything that
 people have been feeling and experiencing, uh, we have wanted to extend the
 deadline.
 So we've extended it to July 1st.
 Um, so you'd have to apply by then.
 And yeah, we just extended it by two weeks just to give people a bit of a extra
 window.
 Awesome.
 So if you've been thinking about doing the school and by the time you listen to
 you thought the deadlines of clothes,
 this could be a sign from the Lord that you to do it
 'cause I've extended it for another two weeks.
  </li><li>There you go.
  </li><li>Go to schoolofsupernaturallife.org
 to learn more about the school
 and to have any questions you have answered.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's lots of videos on there,
 testimony videos and it gives you all the information
 who comes and speaks and all that kind of stuff.
 So you can check it out.
  </li><li>But for now, thanks so much for being with us this week.
 We look forward to being with you again next week.
 Until then, stay safe, feel your feelings and your life.
  </li><li>See ya.
