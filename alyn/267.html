<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Mrs. Jones?<br/>
 Episode 267.<br/>
 Whoop, whoop.<br/>
 Here we are.<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses.<br/>
 It's so cold in here.<br/>
 It's going to be like that for the next couple of months.
 Yes, but we're actually in the middle of a storm right now.
 Like a legit snowstorm.<br/>
 A legit?<br/>
 Yes, no storm.<br/>
 One of the episodes we recorded, we were also in a legit snowstorm.
 I know that's two this year.<br/>
 That's so weird.<br/>
 I think this is our third snowfall this month.
 Like third significant.<br/>
 I think we canceled church on a Monday, remember?
 Because of snow.<br/>
 And the kids went back to school and then we're off for two days.
 Oh, that's right.<br/>
 You're right.<br/>
 You're absolutely correct.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Say that again, but louder and clear.<br/>
 You got one right, Jones.<br/>
 Give us our weekly catch up.<br/>
 Do you even remember this?<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 It's it.<br/>
 No, no, no, it shouldn't have that long.
 It was a great week. Oh, anniversary.<br/>
 Yeah, that's right.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 We went away for the weekend.<br/>
 Well, we went away overnight.<br/>
 We went away overnight.<br/>
 It's our 17th anniversary.<br/>
 We went to a hotel in the same city we live in.
 Yeah, it's our 17th anniversary.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 I got this revelation to start the year.
 I'll talk about later about, you know, this words from the Lord about you need to learn how to celebrate.
 And then along comes our anniversary, like really early in the month.
 So I was like, okay, what are we going to do?
 Like COVID numbers are higher than they have ever been since it started.
 Where are we going to go?<br/>
 We can't really go anywhere.<br/>
 The good thing is our kids are old enough that they can kind of watch
 themselves.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I think on paper, it, I'm kind of resoled with it.
 It sounds dumb to just go away for a night in the same city that you live in.
 But what did you think a 24 hour get away?
 I loved it.<br/>
 It just, it felt fun to just be just the two of us for 24 hours and not have to
 think about either putting somebody to bed or making them food or making sure
 they did their homework or whatever the deal was.
 Right.<br/>
 So yeah, we stayed in bed.<br/>
 I don't think we got our bed.<br/>
 We had breakfast in bed.<br/>
 We did love room service.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Didn't get a bed till like 11 30.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Just in time for lunch.<br/>
 I know then it was just yeah, go upstairs and get some more.
 And then we came back and just chilled more.
 Yep.<br/>
 Lots of chilling Netflix and chill.<br/>
 We had a great time.<br/>
 Happy anniversary, baby.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 That was the telling of the week, the store, the week our friend, Dan Farley from Reading, California, came in.
 Yep, so great.<br/>
 He was teaching at our school in first year on Brave Communication.
 Yes.<br/>
 I love Dan.<br/>
 Yeah, he's so wonderful.<br/>
 We haven't seen him in three years because of a combination of COVID, shutdown, him writing a Bible or Bible commentary.
 Yeah.<br/>
 But it's great to catch up with Dan.<br/>
 That was really good.<br/>
 And then I was teaching and I was teaching on feelings.
 You did?<br/>
 Yeah, I loved teaching on feelings.<br/>
 That was the second year.<br/>
 Really good.<br/>
 That feels like a long, long time ago.
 It was a long week and it was nice to just get away overnight and just be the two of us.
 We had a couple's massage.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 We had a couple's massage.<br/>
 And now here, I think she put our full elbow.
 I mean, she was like, well, five foot two.
 Yeah, tiny, but good God.<br/>
 You know, and she said, you know, what kind of pressure do you like?
 And I was like, I like it for a minute, a couple of times.
 You said intense.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I was like, you're insane.<br/>
 I would never tell massage therapy.<br/>
 I like it.<br/>
 Well, I realize it's not like intense on my shoulders, but everywhere else, like she's doing whatever muscle is there.
 I don't have a muscle there.<br/>
 So I'm like, lady, if you're digging for muscle.
 It ain't there.<br/>
 There's a back off.<br/>
 So yeah, it was really nice to be home.
 We had to cancel church.<br/>
 We did because of the potential for snow, which I'm glad we did because we woke up and it was tons of snow and we're getting more.
 Hey, we got something exciting.<br/>
 We're going to be launching a brand new course in a couple of weeks.
 So about how to fix your finances and position yourself to live under the
 blessing that God has for you.<br/>
 Stay tuned till after the main topic.<br/>
 And we'll tell you how you can get more information about that.
 But, AJ, talk about our main topic.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So this episode is being released on Martin Luther King, Jr.
 Day.<br/>
 And we wanted to actually have a friend on to talk about Dr.
 King and the significance of his life.
 So we've had our friend, Remington, come on this week and talk about him.
 All right.<br/>
 Let's play the interview.<br/>
 We are releasing this episode on Martin Luther King day.
 I think it's called that MLK day, Dr.<br/>
 Martin Luther King day, Martin Luther King, junior day.
 I mean, I'm sure he's fine.<br/>
 We've got a special guest.<br/>
 I'm going to introduce in a second, but some of you might be thinking, Hey,
 Jones, this is maybe the first time in the history of the podcast.
 You've synchronized an episode to match an event.
 'cause, "Eiji and I always forget to do, like,
 "fathers day or mother's day episodes."
 Here's what we're gonna do this episode.
 At the start of the year, I always like to go before the Lord
 and ask the Lord for a word for Alan.<br/>
 Like, "Lord, what's the word that I can cooperate with?"
 And this year, the Lord said,<br/>
 "I actually want you to spend time, energy, and money
 "learning how to celebrate."<br/>
 So I got out of my calendar,<br/>
 and I looked up all the events that are happening,
 like in our family, I've got a 15-year-old,
 a 14-year-old turning 15 to 12,<br/>
 turning 13 and nine-year-old turning 10,
 AJ and I just celebrated our 17th wedding anniversary,
 tons to celebrate.<br/>
 And right there I saw MLK Day.<br/>
 And I have got a shorter history,<br/>
 which I'll cover in a second.<br/>
 But the short, long version of it is,<br/>
 when I moved to America,<br/>
 I was introduced to all of these holidays.
 I knew nothing about,<br/>
 like I had no historical connection,<br/>
 no emotional connection.<br/>
 So, I mean, the comedy is when we started,
 I don't know if you remember this,<br/>
 when we had the more conference,<br/>
 we'd run it on Memorial Day weekend.
</p><ul>
  <li>I do remember that.
  </li><li>And not know.
 We would have school on Labor Day.
 People were like, "Tentically, that's illegal."
 And I remember being challenged about like,
 "Why do you have school in Martin Luther King Day?"
 And I remember that like what I knew about,
 you know, Dr. King would fill a thimble.
 Literally what I knew was that I have a dream speech
 only because it was on the Microsoft Encyclopedia.
 Come around the UK.
 And so I had to study a little bit in our civics exam
 for citizenship, but I realized, okay, now I'm an American,
 I actually want to know,
 I kinda wanna fast track on what I have missed out on
 culturally, like, so you know,
 when Thanksgiving happens, I ask people,
 "Well, like, what are we supposed to do?"
 And I didn't wanna read,
 I have read the Wikipedia article,
 and I have watched movies, and I have been reading books,
 but I didn't wanna just regurgitate what I learned in,
 like, you know, a couple of months.
 I was like, I actually want to have something on the podcast
 who has got a rich history with Dr. Martin Luther King
 and Dr. Martin Luther King Day.
 And learn from you.
 And so, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure
 to introduce our friend, Remington.
 And Remington, why don't you tell the people,
 like, like, priest synopsis of you,
 like, who are you, where you from, what do you do,
 how do we meet, you know, what's your connection to us?
 I feel I'm so happy to be here.
 I'm really glad we're doing this.
 I feel I can't wait to hear how it sounds
 to have your Scottish accent with my Southern draw.
 I can't wait, it's gonna be really cool.
  </li><li>Whenever we have conversations, which you'll testify to,
 we frequently stop and comment on the way we say things.
  </li><li>Yes, we do.
  </li><li>And we have expressions that each other don't have.
  </li><li>That we don't know.
  </li><li>Yeah, like what did I just say up to you?
  </li><li>You just said something upstairs about green,
 red and green don't touch without something in between.
  </li><li>Yeah, red and green should never be seen
 without something in between.
 I've never heard that in my life.
 I don't know.
 It's straight from heaven, but I digress.
 Continue.
 So my name is Remington and I am a diversity equity and inclusion
 consultant for schools.
 That is my job, but I am--
 who am I?
 I am a black man from the South.
 I grew up in Tennessee, West Tennessee, Jackson.
 And I came to Nashville for college.
 I went to Vandy.
 I'm going to study right there.
 'cause you said stuff that's gonna mean stuff
 to people who live locally here.
 We have an international audience
 who are gonna not,
 not, might not know what our racial and diversity,
 any of those words,
 and they might not know the significance of Vanderbilt.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So would you just explain what that is in a nutshell?
 But 10 time, not from here,
 and I'm five, and you small words, right?
  </li><li>So when I talk about diversity, equity, inclusion,
 being a consultant for schools,
 That means I help schools who are having issues
 with race relations or serving different populations
 that aren't white and serving them well,
 I help people with that.
 I'm a former classroom teacher,
 and I come from a long line of teachers.
 My grandma was a teacher, my mom is still a teacher,
 and so I used to teach in the classroom,
 but God called me to start my own consultancy
 and start talking with educators
 and all kinds of people about the impacts of race
 in the United States and how that has affected all of our history.
 And so like it's really cool to be here on this platform talking about MLK Day.
 You gave it.
 I remember one time we hung out and you were telling me,
 give me some examples of what you did.
 And this is, I understand this is a gross oversimplification.
 But this one little example you gave me was like, I, I understand what that means.
 Is helping perhaps a predominantly white school understand perhaps why some of
 their examples or teaching examples or cultural values that it would point to as examples
 might not translate well to people who are not white. Right. In really practical terms.
 Yeah. And so yeah, that's, I mean, that's the, that's the nitty gritty of it, you know,
 helping people. Super helpful. Policies and even, you know, down to classroom rules or
 the ways that we celebrate certain things, you know, that may not translate across lines
 of culture that are not white people.
 So yeah, beautiful.
 And then Vanderbilt, you can pick up yourself.
 And that's a big deal.
 Yeah, that's funny because I didn't know
 Vanderbilt was a big deal when I went there.
 And so that was another thing that didn't translate
 across cultural lines for me.
 So yeah, so like growing up in Tennessee and, you know,
 doing well in school, like I loved school.
 And I thought it was like pretty natural to like school
 and be good at it.
 And then, you know, once I got into Vanderbilt, everybody that I told during that summer,
 like, oh, I'm going to Vanderbilt, they're like, oh, my goodness, congratulations.
 So I had to look it up too.
 So if you don't know, it's, it was a very, it's very highly ranked university.
 Um, and I got my undergrad degree from there in education.
 And at the time, they were the number one education school in the world.
 And I'm assumed they're probably still top.
 They're a big deal.
 So big, significant, important school with rich history.
 Yeah.
 All right, so your credentialed up to the eyeballs.
 I think it's important people know that you know what you're talking about.
 Yeah.
 That's valuable.
 And I want to draw audience to understand that.
 Yeah.
 And from a professional stance, like, yes, but I think also from my personal stance,
 which I think is like a part of the messaging right now about race in the United
 States that's really hard is like there is a very personal experience that people
 need to be allowed to speak to and speak through. And there's a professional side. And so like
 a lot of the folks that I've worked with have really talked about how I do a good job combining
 the two. And so yeah, that's a good thing to play with.
 That would be my experience hanging out with you. Yeah. Just in the times that you've helped
 me bridge the gap of things I don't see. And maybe we'll get into some of that.
 Oh, I'm sure. And so we met through eminent. We did. We did.
 Yeah, are we like I mean I must I've been here 13 years
 Ammonate's been running for like 12 and a half. Oh wow. You were fairly early on in the aminate. Yeah
 And you know remember you walking up to me. I don't know why I've never forgotten this but like oh god
 Good
 Noun stories from my past. I'm buckling up
 You, I think it's just like after I emanate service and I just like walked up and just
 introduced myself.
 You had probably spoken and you asked me if I'd done the school and it was ironic because
 like I hadn't been at emanate for very long.
 And so I wasn't super familiar with the culture of emanate or grace center.
 And a lot of people had asked me if I had done the school.
 And I think you were the first person who I asked like, why did you ask me that?
 Like I said, you know, like what does that,
 you're not the first person to ask that
 and I'm picking up that it means something
 and your response was,
 you just strike me as a very healed up person.
 And I was like, oh.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>I love that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, it's a great story.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was a great story.
  </li><li>Okay, yeah.
 One of the things I was most curious about is I,
 I had this minuscule knowledge of who Dr. King was,
  </li><li>Which is mind-blowing to me, where I said it,
 I was like, oh, but it makes sense.
  </li><li>I would imagine everybody in America
 when they go through school will learn that.
 Like my kids learned that in elementary school,
 they would come home and they would tell me,
 you know, this is who Dr. King was,
 and this is what he did.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But in, come as a shoot, who's shocked,
 in Britain, we don't do American history.
  </li><li>Oh, wow, wow.
  </li><li>So when I got here, I was like,
 he did something to fight racism, right?
 But I couldn't tell you the era he was in,
 or how he died.
 I didn't even know he was a Christian Baptist minister.
 Yeah.
 Like, didn't, didn't you?
 So I'm imagining you and I had very different experiences that.
 And I am curious if you have any stories around, you're a young boy,
 you're grown up in Jackson, Tennessee.
 Do you remember when you became aware of who Dr. King was as significance?
 So that's a, I feel like that's a really interesting question for me as a, a black person.
 And like, I don't know if I know many stories of black people becoming aware of Dr. Martin
 Luther King.
 So like, especially with me growing up in the South, I am acutely aware every day that
 the history of this soil is like rooted in things that are not for me, you know, like
 the whole, the whole reason that Dr. Martin Luther King is celebrated is because of how
 America was established. And so I have known to look out for racism and exclusion all of my life.
 Like from, I would say as early as kindergarten. So like, I don't remember a time not needing to
 know about Dr. King. Like it didn't come into my learning. I was born into that.
  </li><li>So you never remember like, like my kids probably can't tell you because they can't remember.
 I can tell you like, you know, second grade they came home or like daddy's, you know, who dr. King is
 Do you know what he did?
 You know this is what we're gonna do on you know, I remember that they didn't know it and then they learned it in class
 And you're just saying I was aware of him
 I tell me how like what what you know family stories talked about at home. Help me bridge that gap. I think um
 Gosh, and maybe I'm not I don't know if I'm remembering this correctly, but I also would assume that in our house every Martin Luther King junior day like
 the someone errors that I have a dream speech which is like what a
 Lot of Americans especially white Americans know about Martin Luther King jr
 But then also I would assume that in in school when it's brought up
 It impacts me differently as a black boy because chances are, and being a former teacher, a lot of black content in schools is not taught until January or February and only in January and February for Martin Luther King Day and Black History Month.
 month. And so I would imagine that when January rolls around, the first time this comes up in my
 curriculum, it is probably the first time I've seen a black person in a book at school. And so
 like, because they are not in, they're not in the curriculum in the United States. And so I would,
 I feel like when that was introduced, it was first and foremost, like I'm drawn to,
 "Oh wow, like there's a person that looks like me
 "who made it in a book."
 And so I'm gonna certainly read this chapter.
 I may not have read the homework
 for the last two or three weeks,
 but I'm gonna read this chapter.
 And then I also, for me in particular,
 knowing I knew at an early age, not kindergarten,
 but like I knew at a very early age
 that God had called me to talk about race
 and help to heal racial wounds specifically
 in the United States.
 So I think it was an easier transition for me to latch on to Dr. King and kind of say,
 "Oh, this is what God's talking about."
 Here's a model of what I feel God's talking to me about.
 Yeah.
 And so like, I think it just became very natural to me in particular.
 How old are you when this begins?
 When you begin to have an awareness of the Holy Spirit drawing you towards Him, how old
 are you?
 earliest, I remember it's either first or third grade. There was, there was
 ages first grade six, six, six years old. And so like, I just remember going to, I
 think I went to a majority black elementary school, but because of the way
 academic tracking works in the United States, like you are placed in classes
 based on how you perform on tests.
 Like if you're, there was like a smart class or an honors class.
 And one of the ways that race still shows up subliminally in the United States
 history is that if you're in honors classes, it's majority white kids,
 whether you go to a majority black school or not.
 And so a lot of my friends were white children.
 And I think I noticed like, so the times where we would go to recess and
 lunch when it's like the whole grade versus me just being a part of my class.
 Like I look around the cafeteria and I'm like, oh, like the rest of the first
 grade does not look like my class.
 It was a majority black people.
 And so, um, I recognized that, and I may not have known whether it was good or bad,
 but I knew that there was some kind of separation.
 There was a reason why I wasn't with the rest of the black kids and they were all
 together, you know,
 What do you remember and maybe you're having a look back?
 Yeah.
 And attach a thought to it.
 Yeah.
 Both are fine.
 Do you remember what that did in your heart?
 Do you remember what you remember thinking?
 Like, we often try and find meaning and we spot difference.
 Yeah.
 Do you remember what the meaning was for you?
 I think there are a lot of meanings.
 The one that immediately comes to my mind that I think I've
 been aware of for a really long time.
 So it's a very young age is like, this has.
 For a large part of my life felt like a bird.
 Like what's this the being one of few black people in the midst of white people when there are other black people to be with.
 That feels like a burden that has always felt like a burden to me and ex like exclusion or even rejection at times of like why can't I be one of the black boys or one of the you know like.
 of the, you know, like, yeah, and you know, even remember as early as fourth grade, coming
 from Jackson is like a small town.
 I think it's like maybe 200,000 people like it's small compared to Memphis and Nashville.
 And it was, I lived out in the country, like we say, we live in the boondocks, like I live
 between two corn fields, but the school that I went to also bust kids from the city and
 Every kid that got off the bus from the city was black and none of them were in my class
 So I'm like, oh, but like why can't I go with the other black people?
 You know and sense of belonging and separation. Yeah
 Yeah, at the same time and so and I think that kind of also adds to that idea of like
 It's not the awareness is more progressive. It's not a moment
 It's the putting together of all these little things, you know, right?
 Yeah, yeah, so it wasn't like
 It is like you're you're going through and you're collecting these differences and coming to awareness
 And do you remember exploring those at home?
 Oh, you know
 Why this what what happened so gosh? I feel I feel like there's so much there's so much here
 I'm gonna I'm gonna tell the story the way it's resonating in me right now
 So like I was raised by my great grandmother and she was
 I'm gonna go with
 62 when I was born and so
 She was my primary parent and so like I am just recently realizing
 How different my childhood was having access to somebody that age versus
 Like whatever age my mom or dad would have been at the time
 Yeah. And so because we grew up poor, you know, living out in the boondocks and we,
 we were on welfare as a kid. And so like government assistance, my great-grandmother, great-grandmother
 received food stamps and welfare money to help take care of us because she was obviously
 too old to work. We, a part of like getting approved for getting those services was that
 people had to come to our house once or twice a year
 and like interview my great grandmother
 on what she's doing with the money, like taking it.
 Are you actually using to take care of the kids?
 Like how are you spending it XYZ?
 And so I kind of was,
 I was kind of forced to pick up that too,
 because she was always so tense when those meetings came up.
 And so, and the person who came to do those interviews
 was always a white person.
 And so like I would hear things like,
 oh, the white woman's coming to our house tomorrow.
 I gotta make sure everything is clean
 and I need you to go in your room and play
 and go, I gotta talk to the white woman.
 I gotta talk to the white woman.
  </li><li>All of that is having meaning.
 All of that has meaning.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That's just by osmosis, it has meaning.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I remember being, I don't even think school age,
 Like I specifically remember sitting in the living room,
 playing with some Power Ranger toys,
 and then all of a sudden I had to go to the room
 'cause the white woman was coming, you know?
 And so like there is just so much
 in the experience of race for me as a black person.
 It's never not present somehow, someway.
  </li><li>So we're staying with your childhood.
 Do you remember how Dr. King was remembered
 as you were a child?
 So your child, MLK Day comes around.
 Do you remember how he was remembered?
 Like what like a bit easier way of saying is that?
 What did MLK Day look like for you
 in your home when you were a kid?
  </li><li>The only thing that I remember specifically about the day
 is that the I Have a Dream speech was on all day.
 And like it was the background of the entire day.
 And I was a kid, I don't know how long it played,
 but it was on the living room TV.
 We had a huge box television that just like sat on the ground and it just played all day.
 And also like the whatever radio stations that we listen to because obviously like we're
 listening to radio stations that have black DJs and that are geared toward black people.
 So I get in the car.
 They're even playing spirituals and civil rights movement songs on the radio that day.
 And so, you know, there, there, I guess there was all these subliminal moments of reflection
 and reverence that I have not thought about in this way before this conversation, you
 know?
 Right.
 As in, it was my norm.
 So you're asking me to go back and point out something that was, it's like somebody
 saying, Hey, you know, what color was your carpet growing up?
 You're like, hang on, let me, let me, it was always there.
 It was just there, you know?
 Yeah.
 And was there, I don't want to be flipping it
 and asking this question.
 I'm really not, but what I've learned is fireworks
 go with Fourth of July.
 You know, hamburgers go with Memorial Day
 and Turkey goes with Thanksgiving.
 Was there anything that would go with MLK Day?
  </li><li>Not that, like not something so tangible that I remember,
 but like the speech and the even they would play
 like throughout the day, the radio announcement
 or the television announcement of Dr. King's assassination.
 And so like there were, it was on a constant loop
 for 24 hours.
 And so like if I had to say,
 what is the thing that goes with that day?
 It's the speeches, it's the marches.
 Like I have seen that all of my life, you know?
 And didn't really recognize it.
 'Cause like, yeah, one of the things that obviously
 I've had to talk about a lot in the last few years
 is Black Lives Matter movement, George Floyd,
 like all of the protests and things of that nature.
 And my white friends and colleagues feel like
 this is unprecedented.
 But to me, it's like, oh no, I've been watching this
 as I was little, like this isn't new, you know?
 And so like, yeah, when America does not treat us well,
 we take to the streets and make it known.
 And so yeah, I would say freedom fighting
 is what goes with MLK Day to me.
  </li><li>Do you remember like family talking about it?
 Like adding, I don't mean adding value.
 I mean, adding meaning or like anybody explained to you,
 this is what that was or it was just.
  </li><li>It was very apparent.
 Like, you know, it was very apparent.
 Like when he, and I don't, I'm thinking,
 I keep seeing the, there's a,
 the way that the speech is recorded on video
 is it goes between a tight shot of Dr. King giving the speech
 and a large shot of the number of people who were there.
 And I honestly think that in my mind,
 there is no difference between that,
 that video and when I watched like a presidential inauguration, like, and I would be, I would be
 interested if I could even tell you how long it took me to understand that Martin Luther King
 Jr. was dead. Like, I don't know if, I don't know if I understood that in the first few years of
 knowing, because he was always present. Yeah, he was always present. So like, I don't know if I
 understood that he was dead when I was, you know, when I was watching.
 Because it because what he was saying was still the experience that, you know,
 like it wasn't the site.
 I guess if we take a specific line from the speech, little black boys and little
 black girls will be able to run through the streets or hold hands in the streets
 or whatever.
 I was very aware in the first grade that adults got some tense feelings when I
 was friends with a white girl.
 And so for him to be speaking about this,
 and maybe the only reason I knew it wasn't present
 is because it's in black and white,
 to see, to hear him saying that and still know
 that I am experiencing what he was talking about
 however many years ago, that there's something to that.
  </li><li>That made it present, not historical.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's not historical.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That fascinating, Remington.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like hearing that, like,
 I don't think I even knew he was dead.
 Yeah, I don't think I don't know when I found out he was actually because he was speaking to my experience.
 Right, exactly.
 So as you've grown up, right, and certainly with what you do now as a profession,
 how has what Dr. King did, what he stood for, what he's known for,
 influenced or informed what you do?
 Or how you think, or, you know, how you are.
 Like the civil rights movement and you know, again, I'm, I feel like I'm coming to this understanding and this revelation while we're having this conversation.
 The civil rights movement and those images and the purpose and the spirit of that time has never a day in my life been outside of my body that I can remember.
 Like it is in me.
 It is who I am because it didn't fix it.
 Like it didn't fix the problem.
 Mm hmm. And so like when it comes to
 Working with I'll give an example like working with the school like one of the most tangible things that a school that has majority white
 You know kids families administration
 One of the things that they'll grab on to is like oh should we do a black history program or how should we celebrate dr
 Martin Luther king and
 in that sense
 what maybe not what he did, but the way we have frozen
 what he did in time and uplifted him in a way
 that is like almost a shrine.
 It takes a lot of responsibility and action ability
 out of people's hands today because there is a holiday
 because it was like, oh, we're being reverent,
 we're being honorable, but we're also still being racist.
 And it's just like, come on man,
 like that's not the point, you know?
 And so there, there is,
 the action is not there.
  </li><li>A-fraffa.
  </li><li>You know, like, you missed the mark.
 You missed the mark.
 Good's just a swing, anime.
 It's like, you know, I get it.
 Good, good swing.
 But like the things that we need to be doing
 are not being done, but for some reason,
 we still stop and pat ourselves on the back on January 15th.
 And it's like, and I think it kind of gives people this,
 this out to be like, oh, well, look how far we've come.
 And a story that, gosh, I will never forget.
 So when I was teaching, this was maybe four or five years ago,
 it's teaching at a school that served 98% black and brown kids.
 But I would say the staff of our school network,
 and so it was a charter school,
 so like we had like three or four schools
 in our network at the time across two states.
 I would say the composition of our network-wide employees,
 teachers, and men, everything.
 85% white, 90% white.
 And so at some point, someone decides,
 Okay, well, we're serving all of these black and brown kids,
 and the majority of our staff is white,
 but because there's a teacher shortage
 and like it's just hard to recruit black and brown teachers,
 we need to start doing something in the interim
 until we can recruit people who look like our kids.
 And so one of the bright ideas is that in the summer,
 the first day that we come back for professional development,
 we're all gonna get on a bus, drive to Memphis,
 and go to the Civil Rights Museum.
 And so, and it was a mandatory trip to go.
 And so, we met at the school
 and you could just feel all the black people
 trying to get in one place and just be like,
 yeah, and we call this the cookout or the caucus
 whenever there's like, you could be in a room,
 be a thousand people in there. The two black people, their eyes are going to meet and we're
 going to be like, whoo, you know, we see each other, you know, like it may not be a lot of us
 in here, but we're going to we're going to pull through this thing. And so, you know, the whole
 ride there, black people together are just kind of talking like, yeah, I don't want to be here.
 I don't want to do this. Like, what are you feeling in that moment?
 that this is another reverent moment.
 As soon as y'all leave this exhibit,
 we're gonna go right back to race to schooling.
 And we certainly did.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Nothing ever came of it.
 And so, the me and one of my good friends
 who was in school leadership at the time,
 another black man, we walked in.
 And I'm from Jackson, it's like an hour from Memphis.
 And I think I had been to the civil rights museum,
 one time in my entire life.
 And I found out on that day that we went as a staff, why?
 Like there was a room, they did it in section.
 So they were like, okay, we're gonna take 40 staff members
 and a tour guide is gonna give you a tour of the first room.
 Then when y'all move to the first room,
 we'll take the next 40, go on the second room.
 And so me and my friend go in the same group
 and the first room is this white room,
 completely white and it just has black and white pictures with a plaque on and those are the exhibits and
 so there was probably
 15 pictures around and it was things like this is
 indentured servants working on the cotton field or this is the first cotton gin or what ends like or
 Emmett Till was killed on this day and this was the picture of him in this casket and so I
 probably got to picture seven and
 And in my head, I go, this isn't history.
 This is the news.
 Like, this is just what's happening.
 And me and my friend, we caught eyes and we said, we are.
 And we just left.
 I was like, I refuse to look at the difficult times, the,
 you know, like, I refuse to behold my ancestors,
 like this in front of you, where you don't get it.
 And you're not even like trying to get it.
 It's like, what were they not getting that this is happening today?
 They're looking at going, this is a relegated thing to the past.
 Exactly.
 They're like, Oh my goodness, I didn't know that such and such died this way.
 Or I said, I'm like, well, you know, Tamira Rice just died like this last week.
 So like, you know, what do you mean?
 And so it was just, I remember it was just too much.
 Me and my friend, we skipped like we left that first room and we both wanted to
 actually see, because like a part of the museum.
 is that they have preserved the hotel room
 that Dr. King was shot in.
 And that's what we wanted to see.
 And we both, we walked straight up
 to the end of the exhibit
 and we just both kind of stood in front of that exhibit.
 And I know I felt the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King.
 Like, and it just felt like a moment
 to actually lay him to rest in a way
 that wasn't a spectacle.
 The fact that it was just me and this other person
 who really gets it.
 And we kind of exchanged a couple of words
 and said a little private prayer in our head
 and was like, okay, I feel like we're done.
 Like, and you know, we just kind of went about our lives,
 walked around a little plaza or whatever
 for the rest of the time that everybody else was touring.
 But like, that was such a traumatic experience
 to be forced to go watch people,
 watch something so sacred to you
 and not even have the ability to express
 what these things mean to you
 or what they should mean to the other people.
  </li><li>So I ask you, how is Dr.
 in your work and your life now as a grown man,
 how is his life, his legacy, his values influenced you?
 And you go straight to that story.
 So there's huge amounts of meaning in there.
 Where does Dr. Martin King's life legacy,
 like you've told me that story for a reason.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I don't want to miss the reason.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>He's out for me.
 What pushed that story out?
  </li><li>I think what is attached to that particular story
 is like for some reason to most Americans,
 his legacy lives in the past.
 And that is not the case for black people
 who need rights now.
 And so like to be in the place where he was,
 where he did all of his work, where everything happened.
 And then also to be living in the future
 that he prophesied that didn't come true.
 Like it lets me know that there is so much work to do.
  </li><li>There is.
  </li><li>There's so much work to do.
 And it has to be done in the heart.
 It can't be done by marching alone.
 It can't be done by even like one of the hardest things
 about the civil rights movement was that
 black people put their humanity on display.
 And the response from white America is
 we don't care firehose dogs.
 And so like in our culture and black culture,
 it's a very relationship based culture.
 There is nothing anyone can give you
 that's more important than the heart.
 And for us to put everything we had on the line
 during the civil rights movement
 and we're still met with resistance.
 And then the moment Dr. King died, it all stopped.
 It just says that there is so much for us to do.
 Like this holiday is not enough.
 It's not the goal.
 It's not the finish line.
 Like I think if I could if I could shoot on us for a moment,
 like somebody should have passed the torch at that moment, you know,
 like it shouldn't have faded into into black.
 It shouldn't have just gone away.
 And so I think that is what drives me now.
 is that somebody has to do it.
 Because it hasn't been done.
 You know, he got as far as he got and then white people killed it.
 So it's like, well, all right.
 And so we there's so much to be done.
 So let me ask you this.
 Yes.
 Marlitha King Day.
 Hopefully.
 I don't know when you're listening to this, but it released.
 Can you think of some things that we could practically do on Marlitha King Day
 that would not just honor his legacy?
 You know, and like feel good, but help nudge the needle forward, bring meaningful change.
 I think this is the question of our generation, right? For black people ever since the murder of
 Tamir of Trayvon Martin, but for white people ever since the murder of George Floyd,
 the question has been that has been on the table. What do we do? So, you know, every client that I
 do an intake interview with everybody who reaches out to me during social through social media,
 that is their that's their overarching question like what do we do? And I don't think it is the
 most immediate question we should be asking a couple of questions come to mind. How do we get here?
 I think is a more salient question or you know, what am I doing that goes against Dr. King's dream
 whether intentional or not, like this is about impact.
 If I had to give an action, I would say like, you need to talk to a black person
 and listen, like don't come and say, I listened to this podcast and they told me
 to talk to a black person.
 Here's what I think.
 Like I thought I thought I was being so good by celebrating Martin Luther King
 junior day.
 I donate to charities.
 I volunteer at the YMCA data.
 Like, no, go and ask some of these like deeper questions.
 Like I've got a project going on right now
 within organization and they are like,
 they came to me and said,
 and this is an organization of all white people
 and they came to me and said,
 "We read all the stuff we're supposed to read.
 "We watched all the movies we're supposed to watch."
 And we have come to the conclusion that it's not enough.
 like he's and they hired me to give them an experience that answers this question like
 what else should we do? And so they had kind of three rotations of assignments for me and each one
 got progressively more difficult. And the final question that's on the table for them right now
 is go to a person of color, preferably a black person, who you feel close to that you have good
 relationship with and ask them, how do I help or hinder your
 cause? And just listen. And so like, I think it's stuff like
 that. It's not about putting on another march building another
 institution donating a library. It's about us. It's about our
 hearts. And like, you can't like, and I think, Alan, you know,
 this very well as someone who teaches people how to access the heart and feelings.
 We are not very good at it until we're taught.
 And so like we have to kind of go into this with a sense of humility that there is
 something someone close to me is going to see in my heart that I can't see.
 And so I think that's the heart of that question.
 It's like, how does the way I show up impact you in a way that I might not be aware of?
 Say that again, because I'm going to write that down.
 We're putting the show notes because that is a great question.
 How does the way that I show up impact you in a way that I might not be aware of?
 You got to be very brave to ask that question.
 Right.
 And you got to be even stronger to not defend yourself when you hear the answer.
 Come back.
 Yeah.
 It's hard.
 Like I'm not it's not easy by any means.
 No, it's it's a it's a better thought out, better structure question than.
 the one I teach, which is, you know, how do you experience me?
 And all I know is you better be prepared for the answer.
 And you, you know, you might not like it.
  </li><li>Or you, or don't, like I don't think anybody,
 if this is like your first foray into race relations
 or a question like this, you're not ready for the answer.
 'Cause it's gonna, it's chances are it's gonna hurt.
 And that's okay, like be prepared to not be prepared.
 you know, whatever it means for you to take care of yourself after hearing
 something that's difficult to hear, have that on speed dial because you're going
 to need it, chances are, but that's like, that's where we start.
 All right.
 So the Monday, Marna is a king day.
 Find a person of color, preferably black and ask them that question.
 One that you have good relationship with.
 Don't just ask it all by now.
 And if you don't have any, it's another question.
 How did it get this way?
 How did I allow this?
 It's hard questions.
  </li><li>I feel like I'm full.
 I feel like I've eaten this beautiful, rich food.
 And I'm wondering, 'cause you just dropped a bomb,
 you dropped some challenge for us.
 I'm wondering if you'd pray for our listeners,
 pray for us, pray for the Spirit of God to help us,
 see what we don't see, can't see.
 might not want to see. Yeah. Would you do that first? I will.
 Thanks, Remington. Lord, we thank you for every, everything
 under the sun. Lord, we know that you have brought us here
 today, tomorrow, whenever people are listening, nobody's here on
 accident. You've brought us all to keeping up with the Jones
 is for a purpose. You brought me here for purpose brought Alan
 and I together for a purpose.
 And I know for a fact that it is a part of God's plan
 for people to experience freedom.
 I know for a fact that is a part of God's plan
 for America to be able to be an example
 of how to love people well regardless of difference.
 And I just pray right now that everybody under my voice
 and under your reach of the Holy Spirit would be quick
 and would be moved in the way that you have for them
 to sit forth and fulfill that promise
 that you have given us, Lord, the promises
 that Dr. King prophesied in his speech,
 which I honestly believe were straight from God's mouth
 and out of Dr. King's mouth.
 And I just pray strength and vulnerability,
 love and compassion for all of our listeners to be able to ask these hard questions and do the work
 to heal and help others heal when they receive the answer. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
 Dr. Remington. Bishop Remington.
 Where can people get more of you if they want more of you? Where are you on social media?
 Tell us how people can get in. Gosh, I have so much. Let me think about where I want to send people.
 So I think I'm most accessible in terms of just daily posts
 and access on Instagram.
 So my Instagram is Remington_RHC,
 which stands for Remington Hold Consulting.
 And that will just kind of be your--
  </li><li>Gateway drug.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's your gateway, Dre.
 It's like just low level kind of reminders and quotes
 and things that just kind of stir you on the daily.
 But I also have another project called Take a Seat Race Talks.
 And that is on YouTube,
 and it is just me sitting down having conversations
 with white people very similar to this.
 And it's from all of my white friends,
 I've heard that they've learned so much
 from those conversations.
  </li><li>I'll put a link in the show notes
 to both of those things.
  </li><li>For sure.
 So take a seat race talks,
 and then if you are a school or an organization
 that is wanting to talk to me about perhaps being able
 to help you develop equity and diversity goals
 and metrics and just culture for your workplace
 and the things that you're doing.
 Remington-Holt.com is my website
 and you can just fill out a contact form
 and somebody from my team will get back to you
 and we'll get something together.
  </li><li>Dude, thank you so much.
  </li><li>You're welcome. - Thanks for giving up your time
 to come and be with us today.
 Yeah, it was great.
 This was good.
  </li><li>Cultural sensitivity training.
 Do people say happy Martin Luther King Day?
  </li><li>Maybe, I don't know.
 I don't know what they do or not.
 It's just like a-
  </li><li>That was so gentle.
 So that's a no.
 That's a, that's a negative story, good buddy.
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>We're still like, we're in black people.
 We see each other on MLK Day.
 We walk ahead, hell, high.
 We know what's going on today.
 Like we just kill it.
  </li><li>Okay, so you don't need a happy MLK.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm really don't, but that don't mean,
 I don't know. I don't make the rules.
 Okay.
 That's my cultural edition.
 That's an immigrant to this country.
 Oh my gosh.
 Thank you so much.
 You're welcome.
 Thank you.
 Big thank you to Remington for coming on the podcast today.
 Really, really fun.
 Mr. Jones.
 Yes.
 You have a course coming out.
 Yeah, we do.
 Been hard at work creating a course for about, well, about five years, but the last year,
 Well, about five years, but the last year we've been putting together filming it and getting ready to create it.
 Because we know, just from speaking to our listeners, just in chatting and reading comments and just being around people,
 we know that you, that Christians, they want to live with all that God has for them.
 Yes.
 But sometimes it's hard to know how to do that.
 Especially when it comes to really practical things like finances.
 because it feels like everybody's got an opinion or a teaching or a viewpoint on whether that's
 tithing or giving or prosperity or abundance. And it's really hard to know who to trust,
 who to follow. I think one of the consistent pieces of feedback we've got over the years
 is that one of the gifts on our life is to be able to cut through the clutter and just give clear
 concise biblical teaching. And it's a journey that we've been on. We've been on this journey where God has been leading us into an understanding of blessing and of abundance.
 And we have taken everything we really know and not just know, but lived out, battle tested and put it together in a video course.
 I love that you said, battle tested.
 Yeah, it really is.
 Isn't it?
 Because we know what it's like to live in debt, like just incredible debt and be doing everything
 you know to do and be doing everything right.
 Correct.
 And still it feels like nothing shifting yet.
 And the pressure of that is astronomical.
 But then about five years ago, something really radically shifted for us.
 And I remember when it happened, I remember the year before it happened, because the Lord
 was really speaking to me about it.
 And it felt like it didn't feel like the Lord was taunting us.
 But just the very fact he was inviting us to think about the things that were causing us so much pain,
 felt unkind only to find 12 months later the Lord answered the questions that he was asking of us.
 And really for the last five years, he's changed our outlook, changed our finances,
 changed our circumstances quite radically.
 And we want to give away everything that we've been given to.
 Yeah.
 Just practically talk about what did we find?
 Yeah.
 So we've taken all the lords toss.
 We've put it into a course.
 And here's how we do it.
 You sign up, you register for the course.
 Step two is you just watch the videos each week.
 Step three is you join with us for live calls for as long as the course
 lasts, where we get to answer your questions, where we get to talk through
 that week's teaching, maybe help with some specific.
 Yeah, how about that?
 Exactly.
 And then you get to prepare yourself for the blessing and the abundance that you were called
 to live under.
 So here's what I want you to do.
 Go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/more to sign up to be notified when the course launches.
 We'll send you an email with all the information you need to know.
 So you can stop living with lack and instead partner with heaven to live with more than
 enough.
 That website again, <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/more.
 If you want the show notes for today's show, go to <a href="mailto:alan@naj.com">alan@naj.com</a>/267.
 If you want to ask us a question, we've got a great question next week's episode.

 Okay, it does.
 Protecting your kids against pornography.
 Thank you.
 That's better.
