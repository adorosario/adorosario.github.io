<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 216 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 This episode is brought to you
 by the generous support of our patrons.
  </li><li>This week we wanna especially thank Sarita
 for her generous support of the show.
  </li><li>Age of Jones?
  </li><li>Yes, sir.
  </li><li>Last week when you were on the podcast,
 your voice was going,
 tell us what happened between then and now.
 I completely lost it and now it's on its way back.
  </li><li>When you say you completely lost it,
 you mean in life generally or just your voice?
  </li><li>I didn't realize I was getting fairly sick on Sunday.
 And so I ran a fever for three days
 and I hacked and coughed so much
 that I actually lost my voice.
  </li><li>You did?
 And the trouble is you're still
 supposed to be teaching a Wednesday night class.
  </li><li>I was also supposed to be teaching on Monday
 and Tuesday at the school.
  </li><li>There is that.
  </li><li>Yes, and Wednesday night class.
 So we had to roll video for Wednesday, didn't we?
 And I spent three days in bed.
  </li><li>I would say this was one of those weeks
 that you would call challenging?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because we had Abby was sick.
  </li><li>The week before.
  </li><li>And then you got sick.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then just as we thought that you were in the clear,
 MJ got sick.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So we've had a lot of sickness.
  </li><li>Yes.
 our friends and their three children staying. Yes. So that's a house of...
 There was 11 of us here. 11 of us in the house. And then it was just super busy
 and lots of unexpected things. Yeah I would have preferred to have been well
 with our friends being here rather than feel like dirt. That was a bummer. Yeah
 Yeah, it wasn't great.
 I'm trying to think of what else happened this week.
 You spoke this morning?
 I did.
 You have been in a three week series on Blessing.
 It was amazing.
 It was really good.
 I watched from home.
 I couldn't cheer from home and you hear it.
 I had lots of compliments of people saying thank you and I thought only at Grace Center
 could you refer to your audience as swine and still have people say really enjoy that.
 I did laugh when you were like, anyway.
 Yes.
  </li><li>Great buddy.
  </li><li>Thank you, great center people for being so patient with me.
 Well I...
  </li><li>Babe, it was great.
  </li><li>Yeah, I know, but I,
 you know, in hindsight,
 I basically I pause halfway through my message.
 Anyway, you could go watch it for yourself.
 We'll put a link at the show notes so you can see what happened.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was a lot.
 Anything you want to follow on from last week's topic?
 We got the great feedback by the way.
 Thank you, thank you to everybody who reached out
 and said how much they enjoyed the episode last week.
 We're talking all about feelings.
 Talking about our
 4a's into group therapy. Yes anything you would like to update our listeners on well I
 Signed up for group
 So I'm supposed to start this Thursday. Yeah, then I just realized that Tia's
 third grade class show is Thursday at 6 so you can't go so
 To which to if it's a group. Yeah, yeah, yeah
 So I just emailed and said I can't imagine that leaving early on my first day would be a wise decision
 So I'm gonna have to start the following week. We're excited. We'll be here waiting for the
 Yes, how do you feel about gonna group there nervous? I think I'm I don't know. I don't know what I feel. I'm excited
 slash nervous slash
 Uh, I don't know. Oh, I'm so proud of you. I'm super excited. I can't wait to hear all about it. Okay
 So our topic this week is this week we've actually asked our friend and pastor and leader Jeff
 dollar to come back on the show and talk about his new book that he just wrote.
 But when he came over you were sick and bad with a fever so you can interview him.
 Yes.
 So we're doing that thing where we go back in time to earlier this week where I sat down with Jeff
 and we're going to make that happen. Jeff dollar.
 Yes.
 How the heck are you?
 Good.
 I looked at my nose.
 It was really good.
 You haven't been on since episode 20, which was 2014.
 That was five years ago.
 So the question is, what have you been doing
 for the last five years?
 Well, I've been working on my poor self-esteem.
 (laughing)
 I thought, wow, you know, Alan had me the last time
 it was 2014, and I remember he said,
 "And we got such great feedback.
 We need to have you back on."
 (laughing)
 And then he never did, and I thought,
 "Well, I need to go to counseling."
  </li><li>And true to my word, five years later, here we are.
  </li><li>Here we are.
  </li><li>On episode, what is this, 216?
  </li><li>It's okay, I feel fine.
  </li><li>It's fine.
 You wrote this book.
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>How does somebody who's poor self esteem write a book?
  </li><li>Well, you get pushed into it.
 Someone held a gun to my head.
  </li><li>Tell me about it.
 It's letting it go with the need to be right.
 Talk to me about the book, where to come from,
 what's the idea?
  </li><li>The idea is basically my life story
 and all of the lessons that I've learned
 from arguing with people who were trying to give me feedback
 on the way that they experienced me
 and I basically couldn't hear it.
  </li><li>How scary is it right in a book about that going forward?
 Because if anyone tries to give you feedback
 and you don't listen to you go,
 "Hey, you wrote the book, no, no, no."
 It says you have to listen to me.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh, that's, yeah, now I've given everyone ammunition.
 Absolutely.
 Oh, it's very scary.
 It is, I've made myself a target, so to speak.
  </li><li>So where did the idea of the book come from?
 Like you said you were pushed into it, like I know you,
 you were the last person who's like,
 you know what I'm gonna do?
 I'm gonna just attract some more public attention.
 I'm gonna write a name on the book,
 and I'm gonna suggest people should read it.
 Like that's as far from you as possible.
 So how did you end up--
  </li><li>Well the way that started was there's a lady in our church
 who once she heard that Grace Sinner
 had adopted this village in Mozambique,
 She said, "Oh, hey, you should write a book."
 And I was like, "I don't want to write a book."
  </li><li>Out of boy.
  </li><li>And she had worked with other publishers
 and then helped other people write books.
 She said, "No, I would help, I'd like to help you."
 So I kept pushing her back, you know,
 pushing her away, going, "Ah, I don't think so."
 Finally I said, "Okay, we'll do it."
 And all of the proceeds go to the village that we adopted.
 She said, "Great."
 And I was like, "Oh, shoot."
 I thought that would have turned you away.
 So she came in and began interviewing me
 And then she said, "Whoa, she's a Jeff."
 You know, that is a book in itself,
 but actually the book that needs to be written
 is this one on your life.
  </li><li>So she started thinking,
 we're gonna write a book about the village in Mozambique.
 And then the more and more you talk, she was like,
 "Man, your story's so messed up.
 We need to put this in print."
  </li><li>She totally did.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>She totally did.
  </li><li>You can't, it was a great title.
 Letting go of the need to be right.
 My question is, why do you think we, not me?
 And sorry about you.
  </li><li>Yeah, but other people. - Yeah, but other people.
 Why do you think the need to be right
 is so important to us?
  </li><li>Oh, and that's the question everyone asks.
 I think, now, so I could say this in our language,
 'cause you would understand what I'm talking about.
 I think it is connected to the orphan mindset.
 I think it's attached to this.
 No one hears me, no one sees me, no one understands me.
 I've got to hold on to this rightness.
 It's the last thing that I have.
 And I've seen people, you know,
 you and I've talked about this.
 We've seen families split over one person
 just refuses to release this need to be right,
 that they're rightness.
 And so they will go down with the sinking ship.
 family split apart and you're like,
 oh, if you would just listen to the feedback
 that someone's trying to give you.
 So, you know, I think it's, as I've thought about this,
 because people have been asking me,
 you know, that question that you just asked,
 I think it is the more I thought about it.
 It is the one universal issue.
 It transcends race, religion, age.
 That's why you're two year old.
 We'll argue with you over this thing
 where they think they are right,
 as well as your 92 year old person
 who will argue over this thing.
 Yeah, so you see Christians, non-Christians, politicians.
 I mean, it just the top CEOs, the poorest of the poor,
 it's just one issue that transcends the human race.
 It's--
  </li><li>What do you think the payoff is?
 So, you know, like, I get to get what you're saying.
 We do it 'cause it feels like a piece of us.
 Like, I think at times when I've been so stubborn
 that I wanna be right, I remember early on our marriage,
 early on our marriage 'cause we don't do this.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>Early on our marriage, we would fight about something
 factual, like, no, no, it was a Wednesday.
 It wasn't a Friday, no, no, you're wrong.
 And then the more mortgage age you would explain it to me,
 the faster, faster would be like, oh, crap, she's right.
 and I'll never get away with it, right?
 So there's that's a silly, futile example,
 but still you're holding onto it
 because I don't want you to win over me.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What is the payoff?
 'Cause there's no payoff for me in that one.
 I've now got a hostile wife.
  </li><li>I don't think it's a payoff.
 I think it's the fear of the loss.
 I don't think it's a payoff.
 I don't think you do it to get something,
 you do it because you're afraid of losing something.
 (clears throat)
 And I think that's the--
  </li><li>And what's the loss?
 Like what are you losing?
  </li><li>The loss is...
 So like with me and Becky, when we used to have these arguments, because we don't do this.
 Long and long time ago, before your accident.
 Oh yeah, before your accident.
 28 years.
 We have learned this.
 Let me just tell you.
 Again, it's that, let me ask you this, why is it so hard for people to say I'm sorry?
 It's hard.
 Like with me and Becky.
 I'm asking the question.
 You're the guest.
 Don't be flippin' this.
 I haven't written a book.
  </li><li>Okay, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
 No, but I was thinking about that by self-slight.
 Why am I having such a hard time of saying, I'm sorry.
 I think it's probably connected to our fallen nature.
 You know, it's something that's connected to the fall.
 And, you know, the thing about being married to Becky,
 which I think I talked about in the book is, you know,
 that's like being married to the Holy Spirit.
 And she just refuses to argue.
 She, you know, when she sees, she's at fault.
 She's the first one to say, "I'm sorry."
 And that's why I coined the phrase,
 first one to say, "I'm sorry, wins."
 Because, you know, I wanted to keep fighting.
  </li><li>She just took away all your ammunition.
  </li><li>Took everything away, so I'm so sorry.
 And then I realized she's the one walking away with peace
 and I'm the one walking away with agitation.
  </li><li>Oh, sure, you're sorry.
 You all say you're sorry.
 (both laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I think so, the payoff, I think it's this whole thing
 I'm not wanting to lose.
  </li><li>It's horrible.
  </li><li>It is.
 And that transcends genders.
 That's not a male thing or a female thing.
 It's this we have this inherent fear of losing.
 And that's the whole thing.
 The Lord is saying, "Lose, go ahead and lose.
 "Be the first one to lose.
 "Lose your life so that you'll find it.
 "Lose, fall on the rock.
 "Fault, lose.
 Go ahead and be the first one to sacrifice.
 This is the way of the kingdom.
 You'll find, people ask what's a takeaway from this.
 It's like, it is a key that opens up.
  </li><li>That sounds better than what I thought you were going to say.
 I thought you were going to say,
 what's the takeaway?
 Die quietly and die quickly.
 (laughing)
 And then you'll find your life.
  </li><li>And you'll find your life.
  </li><li>Yeah, no, but it's, it attracts.
 It's a magnet that attracts his presence, his favor,
 his, like it's bizarre.
 I talk about it in a book where I'm actually stuck
 in my life and it's where God asked this one question
 and to this day I can't explain it.
 I can't, he asked me, what would it look like
 if you were wrong?
  </li><li>Set that up, set up the story
 'cause it's such a great story.
  </li><li>So we are, we have two small children
 barely making ends meet, we are living in a space
 that's about 600 square feet, one bath,
 and two small children.
 So we're thinking we're gonna be there for a couple of months,
 we're actually there for three years.
 And everything that I try to do,
 I'm just not, I'm not moving ahead.
 All my friends are getting blessed,
 they're getting jobs, they're getting promotions,
 they're getting, and I'm still stuck in this one spot.
  </li><li>Formal.
  </li><li>And I'm doing everything that they're doing.
 I'm tithing, I'm giving.
 I'm, so I just, I cannot figure out why this,
 the gospel or the Bible is not working for me.
 I'm like, what's the deal?
 So I come up with this, "Ungodly belief."
 Oh, he likes everybody else but me.
 He wants to bless everybody else but me.
 Obviously, because look at my life and look at their life.
 So I learned to be content and just being,
 I'm just one of those unchosen.
 I'm the happy unchosen.
 And I'll be the one that stands before him
 and just say, hey, just wanna let you know,
 I tried your manual, it doesn't work.
  </li><li>Wow, good one.
  </li><li>Yeah, oh yeah, I had him.
 So--
  </li><li>And I had luck.
  </li><li>And I had luck, totally.
 So he, so this whole,
 my life was starting to crescendo of just frustration,
 just absolute frustration.
 And we're attending another church at the time
 that they did this outreach into the city
 and invited all of these people
 who are unchurched to come to church.
 So walking into church,
 and there's all these people outside,
 tattoos and piercings and smoking,
 and I'm thinking, what is going on?
 And I'm watching my very impressionable children
 at the time, Bethany, it's like five.
 It's like, hey, what's that sticking out of your mouth?
 I wanna try that cigarette.
 You're like, uh, so now that put,
 That was the thing that pushed me over the top.
 I thought, what are they doing?
 Don't they know that they're bringing harm
 into our safe environment?
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, oh, I was fuming.
 So worship starts, everyone stands up
 and I'm sitting down.
 I thought, well, I'll hold Joel 'cause he's young.
  </li><li>And that'll show good.
  </li><li>That'll show good.
 Well, the whole time we're talking,
 he and I are talking, I'm like,
 I cannot believe that these leaders have done this
 and I'm gonna talk to them about the law.
 And the Lord said, hey,
 What do you think my ministry looked like?
 I'm thinking, he said, you know, prostitutes
 and tax collectors and somehow I said,
 yeah, that's different.
 You know, that's back then.
 This is now we should know better.
 Whatever it was, I don't know.
 That didn't get through.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Then he said, hey, how would you know if you were wrong?
 And so this is the part that I have
 the hardest time articulating
 because that one questioned disarmed,
 It was a disarming question.
 If he would have said, hey, I think you're wrong,
 I would have dug in.
 I would have, sounds crazy, talking to God.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But I probably would have dug in.
 What do you mean?
 I don't think I'm wrong.
 Like, I don't think I'm wrong.
 I'm just talking about this.
 But him flipping it and saying, hey,
 how would you know if you were wrong?
 And honestly, it's done me because I had no answer.
 So when I say it's disarming,
 somehow this thought structure that I had,
 that I didn't know that I had.
 This was the key that went click and unlocked it
 and the whole thing fell apart.
 And I'm looking at the pieces of this thought construct.
 Like I didn't know that I had this,
 I didn't know I had this system
 of being able to receive correction.
 I didn't know that I had that
 'cause when he asked me, hey,
 how would you know if you were wrong?
 I had such a hard time with it.
 He said, he was helping me.
 describe the scene in which you are going to realize that you are wrong.
 And I'm like, what do you mean?
 He said, well, who are the characters?
 What, what is the scenario?
 You just, you tell me how you would know you are wrong.
 And I'm like, why am I having such a hard time answering this question?
 So I begin to think, well, you would tell me, God, you would tell me if I was wrong,
 or the Holy Spirit would tell me or the Bible, I would read it in your word.
 Or you'd send an angel, I mean, somehow you would let me know.
 And I realized I wasn't getting anywhere
 and immediately he said, "Hey, would it look like this?"
 And so these three things that I'm about to tell you,
 they all happened in one week.
 He said, "Would it look like your boss
 "calling you into his office and saying,
 "Hey, Jeff, can we talk?"
 I've noticed you got a bad attitude.
 And I'm sitting there thinking,
 I'm not the one with the bad attitude.
 You're the one with the bad attitude.
 Nobody even wants to work for you.
 And so the Lord, before I could even flesh out that thought,
 he said, or would it look like Becky, saying to you,
 hey, you're being harsh with me.
 And I'm thinking, I told her, I said,
 I'm not being harsh with you, you're criticizing me.
 And before I could flesh that thought out,
 he said, or would it look like Bethany,
 who at the time was about five,
 saying daddy in her little childlike way,
 you're being harsh, you're being,
 I can't remember what she said.
 Yeah, yeah.
 And I said, I'm not being mean, honey,
 I've told you 27 times.
 You know, on the 27th time, I'm gonna be mean.
 You're not understanding.
 And then he said, it packages them all together.
 And he said, "Would that look like you're wrong?"
 And I was, he had me pinned.
 There's no way, I was like, oh my gosh,
 I thought it was all them.
 It's me.
 The issue was he was trying to send a message through,
 you know, we all have concentric circles of friends
 and acquaintances.
 This is my closest circle.
 This was the bull's eye, my wife, my daughter, and my boss.
 These three see me more than anybody else,
 more the people at church, more than people,
 you know, my friends, they see me more than anybody.
 And this nucleus was trying to give me feedback
 on the way that they were experiencing me.
 And I couldn't hear it.
 And the reason I couldn't hear it
 is because I had discounted their message
 because of the fault that I saw
 in them being the messengers.
 Oh yeah.
  </li><li>You do a great job of describing what the books are about.
 (both laughing)
 But only humble people are going to want to read this book.
 When did your publishers say,
 "So you're writing a book about how you can find out you've been wrong the whole time?"
 What are the, I mean, because that's the essence,
 like, "Hey, here's a manual to help you understand why you're not as right as you think you are."
 Well, interesting. The first thing they said to me was,
 "I know so many people that need this book."
 And I went, "Uh, yep."
 And actually, you're one of them.
 (laughing)
 So, if you've been listening to this podcast
 and thinking, man, I need to get that book
 for my mother-in-law.
 Maybe by two copies.
 (laughing)
 Know what I'm saying?
 But it's hard, isn't it?
 It's like a whole--
  </li><li>It's very hard.
  </li><li>Let me get that spec out your eye.
  </li><li>Oh, totally.
  </li><li>Well, I got this huge enormous log in my eye.
  </li><li>The publishers told me, they said,
 "Jeff, you're the title is so compelling
 "that we have to put kind of a fun,
 type looking cover to it or no one's going to pick it up or no one's there their question is is the
 will someone read this on the airplane meaning the person beside me who knows nothing about me
 are they going to look at that and go hey what's that about or is a reader going to be too embarrassed
 that that someone's going to think wow what's your problem what are some of the signs
 Because we're the last people to know.
 Based on my experience, I'm the last person to know what everybody else is already discerned
 about me.
 What are some of the signs that begin to manifest when we think we're right but we're actually
 not?
 So for me, the signs were I was getting timely specific feedback.
 But you were ignoring it.
 I was ignoring it.
 Oh, totally.
 had to, you know, again, put me in a headlock and said,
 "Out of the mouth of two or three witnesses."
  </li><li>Wow. - I was like, "Oh."
 So some of the signs are, he will begin to send people
 and they'll begin to say the similar thing.
 Point to a similar area.
 You'll begin to see.
  </li><li>Have you noticed that when that happens,
 geography makes no difference?
  </li><li>Oh, absolutely.
  </li><li>'Cause we, so we're pastors.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>And so often people will come to our church
 who've been in maybe three or four other churches before,
 and the reason they've left those other churches is
 because they were getting consistent feedback,
 and they come here and they get the same feedback,
 and they're like, "What is it with all you people?
 "This is the only feedback I ever get."
  </li><li>Well, again, they think it, you still don't see me.
 That was my core thing.
 You don't understand me.
 You are not getting me.
 If you were getting me, you wouldn't be treating me.
 You wouldn't be saying the things that you're saying.
 So obviously you don't understand me.
 So, Tibetan, of course you don't understand,
 you're only five years old.
 Honey, if you were an adult,
 you would understand the pressures I'm under,
 you'd understand all of this.
 But to God, it was like, "Nk."
 Tabeki, you know, "Hey, you're not understanding me.
 "If you understood, I'm trying to make a living here.
 "I'm trying to do this."
 And she's like, "That, irregardless,
 "you're being so mean to me."
 And that was the message that God was trying to send my way
 was, "Hey, your behavior."
  </li><li>Hey, you're the common denominator.
  </li><li>You and everybody's feedback.
  </li><li>That's right.
 No, that's the truth.
  </li><li>Yeah, you are the math problem.
  </li><li>This might be obvious, but maybe it's not.
 What are some of the damaging side effects
 of refusing to hear the mass injures in your life?
  </li><li>For me, the damage that it did to me was
 it actually put my life on pause.
 So I was like, oh, why can I move forward here?
 Why am I not progressing here?
 There's this, I think I talked about it in the book.
 There is an incredible message around King Nebuchadnezzar
 in Daniel, the book of Daniel.
 And it's when King Nebuchadnezzar gets sentenced.
 So it's a wonderful chapter, 'cause it talks about this,
 all this heavenly language.
 These watchers who are watching, they came down
 and they made this announcement to him
 and basically sentenced him to seven years
 of eating like an animal, looking like an animal,
 which when you first read it, you're like, wow.
 That is a harsh sentence.
 But in their message that they give him,
 they basically say two or three things.
 Basically, the earth is the Lord's and all that it contains.
 He puts men into place.
 It's His kingdom.
 He appoints rulers and He appoints it over the lowliest of men.
 So basically, I think this council was meeting looking at Nebuchadnezzar's life and looking
 at how arrogant he was and said, "Hey, according to the rules of His kingdom, humility and
 authority go together. We've put your life in the balance and you're lacking in
 humility. If you were to continue ruling, which we want you to do, you've got to
 have a measure of humility in order to counterbalance that authority or they
 could have just nuked him. But it's like, no, we're gonna, this is actually an
 act of mercy where we are going to let you continue to rule, but you've got to
 have a measure of humility because we've looking at your life and there's none.
 So, after that, when he's...
 So the seven years ago are completed and all of a sudden he comes into his right mind
 and he says, "The Lord God of heaven, He is the one who is the ruler.
 He is the maker.
 We are..."
 And you see his entire attitude shift and come into alignment with all of the Lord's
 subjects.
 someone is? That was also that one of the thoughts around this was Moses. So if you look in the
 Old Testament, Moses is the only one who sees God face to face. God says, "Hey, I treat
 him like a friend. Why would you not have any sort of fear about talking bad about my
 friend?" And so I was paying attention to that and looking at that because I was like,
 That's what I want.
 I would love for God to talk to me face to face.
 So first I used to think,
 well, that was the specific call
 that was on Moses's life,
 and that's why he did that.
 And he's got a million people under him,
 and so it's got to have some sort of.
 And then you read this verse in the New Testament
 where it talks about that God's no respecter of persons.
 So that kind of nullifies that thought.
 So you're left back to ground zero asking the question,
 Why is God choosing to speak to Moses face to face?
 This is bizarre.
 And then you read, I think it's in Numbers 12
 where Moses says, "And now Moses was the most humble man
 on the face of the earth."
 And you're like, "Oh, could there be a connection
 between the humility of man and the face of God?"
 See, I think there is.
 which makes me wonder what did Moses look like?
 'Cause he stuttered, so he was probably had this,
 there's a teachability factor about Moses though.
  </li><li>The danger for me is every time I hear a principle
 like that, I start defining humility on my terms.
 Well, this is what, I'm humble,
 like I'm humble because I do this,
 and I'm like, oh, you can actually get to decide
 what humble is, but a great definition of humility
 is that you can hear input from the loneliest of sources.
  </li><li>Mm.
  </li><li>So, I can think of seasons of mouth.
 I'm horrified to think I might be in a season right now
 because this is the gift of hindsight.
 You can all see what you do in present-lay.
  </li><li>Presently.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I can remember thinking I was humble.
 I remember my friends came to me and they're like,
 "Elyn, you're like this and this and this."
 And I had this great Christian response.
 You know what, I will pray about that.
 And so my prayer friend went,
 Lord, what is with them?
 They're fruitcakes, right?
 We both agree they're completely...
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>But you know, someone in Bathroom was like,
 "Hey, pray about it, couldn't hear anything."
 And then I went and worked for a psychopath.
 And this psychopath just ground me into it.
 And I realized everything they said about me
 was true of him.
 And I saw myself in him.
 And I had to go back.
 Prior to that, my measuring scale was, "No, I'm good."
 But I guess I'm hearing you say,
 "We don't get to decide our own level of humility."
  </li><li>Ooh, it's a, so you know, one of the things,
 so this book is probably, it takes humility
 and turns it so you can see the different facets
 of what humility looks like.
 Humility, I would think, someone talks about being humble.
 I immediately think of a person who's a doormat
 and everyone walks over them.
 You know, they're the ones that's serving,
 they're the ones serving, you know,
 different places, they're the best boys,
 they're the, you know, whatever.
 There's no ambition, no nothing.
 They're just happy to be alive and, you know,
 just to be in your space, thank you for smiling at me.
 Right.
 And so one of the things I talked about in the book is Naman.
 So in 2 Kings 5, he is the vice president of Syria, a great warrior, and he has leprosy.
 And so if you read his life, there's a particular place where he goes to the man of God and
 he says, "Go dip in the Jordan seven times."
 We all know the story.
 He's lived, lived absolutely, you know, and if you look at it, you know, the man of God did not
 give him any respect. It goes through this whole thing. I'll talk about it in the book.
 Basically, the takeaway is, is that Naaman was able to hear from people who were beneath him,
 which is so being teachable. I say this when I share this story, you know, if I were to ask you,
 Are you teachable? Everyone would say 100% absolute totally totally and then I realized and I would say the same thing
 Until I realized being teachable is not the ability to receive information. It's who you can receive it from
 So that's that's what I'm saying this book. I'm like, uh, I didn't know I had a social caste system
 I had all the important people all the educated people Bill Johnson. Oh
 Oh absolutely. You can speak to me.
 Absolutely.
 Kid of me, I would just drop everything, whatever he said.
 Jeff, you know what, your pants are on backwards.
 You know what? I'm going to go to luck.
 I agree. Everything's on backwards.
 You're right.
 My wife?
 My wife.
 Oh.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 How dare you talk about this horrible.
 That's horrible.
 That's horrible.
 Oh.
 Horrible.
 Horrible.
 Or even people whose life is not even put together that way.
 Right.
 And like, how are you able to--
 I can dismiss the voice of God in your life because I have to certain that you don't have it.
 Totally. Like stop, stop poking me with that log in your eye and you're trying to get the spec out of you know,
 but yet the Lord's going to, hey, just pay attention to what I'm telling you.
 So yeah, I think that was the biggest thing.
 I'm now remembering why haven't had you on in five years.
 No, but we, we grade the level of messengers that that actually slip, slip through.
 our filters that we're able to hear from. Oh, oh, hey, this is, look, I wrote a book about it.
 At least you get to have yours, your throw-ups over in quiet. I publicly just threw up.
 I think, you know, one of the things that has been difficult for me to answer, because people
 ask a question, why did you write the book? And, you know, the book is a book about the heart.
 It's not really a how to type book.
 It's a how not to type book.
 Which is an underrepresented marketing books.
 You've got how to be successful, but not how not to do things.
 Right.
 No.
 And so they were asking me, hey, could you write it in a format of these are the five take
aways.
 Here's the five keys to.
 I was like, no, actually I can't.
 It's not really a how to book.
 It's more of a how not to book.
 And it's done on the best basis I know, which is just tell the story of my life.
 People ask me, "Why did you write the book?"
 And I didn't write the book to point a finger at someone who treated me unjustly.
 I didn't write it for that.
 I read it.
 I wrote it because it was a key that actually unlocked the forward progress of my life.
 This was it.
 It's like the Lord was saying, "I can't move you forward further into my kingdom and into my blessing."
 If you're going to hold on to this need to be right, you have to let go of this.
 Otherwise, the kingdom's not going to work for you.
 It's like a shark repellent.
 You've got this God repellent on you.
 God opposes the proud.
 He gives grace to the humble, that sort of thing, even though I'm his son.
 It's like your behavior is actually, you don't realize it's repelling the natural
 God benefits that I would want to develop your life, clothe you in this, but I can't really clothe
 you in it. It wasn't until the prodigal son realized, gosh, I made a mistake. And when he went back,
 That's when he got the right clothes.
 That's when he got the promotion.
 That's when he got the ring.
 That's when he got the shoes.
 That's when he got, you know, but it wasn't until he went,
 oh, snap, I was wrong.
 Dad, I was so wrong.
  </li><li>Dang.
 All right, well this is letting go of the need to be right.
 It's available everywhere, isn't it?

 And we're back
 I'm bummed that I missed the interview. It looks like you had a good time. All those have a good time with Jeff
 I know the hard part was kind of a party waiting a half in actually the hard ones we both laughed so much
 that I couldn't work out which microphone to focus on when we're laughing so yeah that was
 Sounds about right that was humorous. Would you like a listening question? Sure. That's a great question. Okay about soaking
 hold on
 This is question. This is from Megan Megan says how often do you fall asleep during soaking?
 Maybe your answer is never it's not never but I have found that every time I grab my pillow and lay down to soak I fall asleep
 And then I wake up feeling like I just wasted four or five minutes.
 I do believe that soaking is valuable.
 I trust people like you and John and Carol and my bickle who say there's pyrone soaking.
 I just don't think I'm tapping into it.
 Help.
 Suggestions.
 Over to our resident soaking expert, Eiji Jones.
 So I have fallen asleep while soaking many times.
 Me too.
 I still think it counts, but it's not the goal.
 So I get what you're saying.
 So typically I do things like I don't soak if I'm already tired.
 So if I know like, oh my gosh, if I were to shut my eyes right now, I'm going to fall
 asleep.
 I don't soak them because I'm just not setting myself up to succeed.
 If I know I'm going to hang out with the lawyer this afternoon and I'm going to do
 some soaking, I'm actually going to plan my lunch for that.
 I eat.
 I'm not going to eat pasta or things that are heavy that make me tired, that kind of stuff.
 By pasta, do you mean pasta?
 Oh, pasta.
 Yes, we're in America now, we mostly have all stuff.
 Why are you speaking with English accent?
 I don't know.
 I don't understand why you say pasta.
 You basically have all your heavy carbs.
 Avoid heavy carbs.
 Yes.
 I think if you fall asleep, if you go to lie down to sleep and call it soaking, you're
 not soaking.
 But if you go to soak and you fall asleep, you probably needed the rest.
 And actually there's plenty of examples in scripture of God meeting people in their
 dreams.
 So you chalk up to that.
 But I also think like I used to never soak on my bed
 because my bed is my cue and falling asleep.
 So I'd soak on the floor, pillow on the floor,
 lie down, pay attention to the music you're using,
 pay attention to the time of day that you're doing it.
 But I wouldn't beat you up.
 It might just be an indicator of how crazy your life is.
 And you might want to look at other avenues
 of getting some rest before adding that.
 But he wouldn't beat you up.
 No, no, no.
 I'm just saying don't you beat yourself up.
 Don't you beat yourself up?
  </li><li>Yeah, I would say I also, when I used to have my Godroom,
 I literally would make sure that I wasn't comfortable
 enough to fall asleep like what you were saying about
 don't soak in your bed.
 So I just light on a hardwood floor
 with a pillow kind of thing.
 I don't know if you need to go that far.
 I will often soak on our couch,
 but I soak sort of upright,
 which isn't typically how I fall asleep.
 So not upright, but you know what I mean?
 Resting upright on a couch.
 So yeah.
  </li><li>A demental image of Ajay tipping our sofa upright.
 (laughs)
 and then soaking.
  </li><li>Apparently I need to go soak right now.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't know, Megan, it's a great question.
 I honestly wouldn't worry about it.
 I'd also try, this is gonna be stretching,
 soaking with some other people,
 invite people over for a soaking time.
 That way you tend to be a little bit more,
 not that the goal is to be self-conscious,
 but it then becomes a communal activity
 and you're less likely to fall asleep.
 Though based on the number of times
 we've done soaking with our students
 and the number of people who snore.
  </li><li>People fall asleep every time.
  </li><li>You might not be a remedy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>There's nothing wrong with you.
 Maybe you just need to get more sleep.
