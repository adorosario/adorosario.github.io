<p> I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
</p><ul>
  <li>Eiji Jones. - Yes sir.
  </li><li>Episode 264. - Yes.
  </li><li>And first of all, I know that most of our listeners
 can't tell, but you've done a spectacular job
 on decorating the studio.
  </li><li>Yeah, I had some fun with that.
 It was, it's anytime you say to me,
 here's some money you can go and get decorations.
 I get so excited.
 So I went to the home store this time and found something.
  </li><li>But the portrait of me in swaddling clothes
 is beautiful.
 I don't know how you can mention that.
  </li><li>It is stunning.
 Well, you know, I have friends in high places.
 And so, weird.
  </li><li>Yeah, for our members,
 this is our progressive Christmas-ization.
 Christmas-ization?
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Well, but last, no, next week is gonna be
 the last episode of the year.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It's gonna be a Christmas bonanza.
 So what can you do to make it more ChristmasI 
 don't want to ruin the surprise.
 So we'll have to up our game even more.
 I have a wonderful sweater for you to wear.
 Oh my God.
 Do you really?
 No, but I will have.
 If that's not a reason to become a member, I don't know what is.
 We're having slight deja vu.
 We are.
 You don't think we're having slight deja vu for 3am this morning?
 Yes, we are.
 Yes, I hear you.
 So last night, our country, actually, America.
 Yeah.
 I guess you didn't know.
 Yeah, in case you weren't aware.
 Go ahead by some really serious weather patterns.
 Yeah.
 And about 3M we had a tornado warning, which means a tornado has touched down somewhere
 in our area.
 In our county.
 Yeah.
 And so over there, what you can't see is three of the walls are underground.
 So that's our, what are you calling?
 Storms, storms, shelter.
 So about 3 o'clock I wake up all the kids, wake up AJ.
 Wrap them all up and blanket.
 Well, here's the funny thing.
 I go up and I'm like, "Abby, Tia, you have to get up.
 Could you grab your blankets and come to the basement?"
 And I see them all come downstairs and they've grabbed their iPhones, but no blanket.
 They are your children.
 My heart is warm.
 But you will be freezing quickly.
 Yeah.
 Oh, there's no heat in the basement.
 Yeah.
 So, yeah, we were here.
 We got off unscathed.
 There's no property damaged to us.
 And we've got friends here without power.
 And if you've, depending on where you are in the world, if you read the news,
 just being some tragic loss of life.
 But it just feels a little bit weird coming back
 during daylight hours and going,
 "I wasn't here just a couple of hours ago.
 Are you looking at my hair?"
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah, it's--
  </li><li>I'm not sure what it's doing right now.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I just noticed as like, "Oh, a very cockatoo of you."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Which leads us nicely to our Christmas wrestle.
  </li><li>Our Christmas wrestle.
  </li><li>Do you wanna share with our listeners your plan, my veto?
  </li><li>Well, here's the thing.
  </li><li>Ah-ha.
  </li><li>I want to get our children guinea pigs.
 So this is where it all started.
 I was at therapy on Friday
 and spent most of the time in therapy talking about--
  </li><li>Oh wait, wait, wait.
 Are you playing the therapy card?
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>'Cause you introduced the therapy card for me.
 Now I'm just gonna look like a horrible
 obstructor of healing to your heart.
 'Cause I'm a monster.
 You never played a therapy card with me.
 Okay, getting, no, just let me finish what I'm saying.
 So we're talking about--
  </li><li>I don't love me, you would love me.
  </li><li>You would love me, you'd love me, get them, guinea pigs.
 We were talking about my dad
 and introducing my kids to my dad, basically,
 because basically I just never talk about him
 'cause I don't wanna answer questions about how he died.
 And 'cause I don't think they're old enough.
 So I'm like, I just basically pretend I like,
 but for me, here I have emotion every Christmas
 for my dad.
 So because it was like one of the times
 he was good at things.
  </li><li>I'm trying to stay with you,
 but I'm just not feeling like the worst husband in the world.
  </li><li>Why?
  </li><li>Because this is your preamble and settle set up for.
  </li><li>No, I didn't mean to start trying.
 I'm not trying to find it, but I'm kidding.
 guinea pigs. So anyway, but what my dad was great at was paying attention to like throughout
 the year. What, what did I like? What did I notice? What did I talk about? And at Christmas,
 he was such a good gift giver. Like he gave me gifts that said, you've listened to me
 this year. You paid attention. And so one of the things that Samuel said was like, do
 you give gifts? Samuel, your therapist. Yes. Do you give gifts like that? Like, is that
 how you do as well.
 I try, but we have them do Amazon list,
 which is what we do blah blah.
 But I was talking about how my dad used to like
 disguise presents and like, he would,
 I remember when he bought us stereos,
 he cut air holes in the boxes and asked them to stamp on it,
 keep refrigerated and we guessed for weeks what was in there
 and he would periodically move the boxes and be like,
 oh my gosh, they must be moving and, you know,
 so he would just make it this, you know, big thing.
 And I just started pondering that and I thought,
 oh, I'd love them to have like some significant gift memories.
 That's all.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So didn't think anymore of it.
 That was last Friday, Thursday.
 We're at one of our good,
 Jillian Christmas parties that happened this week.
 And for white elephant, you know,
 we all brought white elephant gift
 and then you can steal off of somebody.
  </li><li>Which sounds like the worst game ever.
 It's a complete antispera of Christmas.
  </li><li>Well, it's not a good game for somebody
 who's a gifts person because like, anyway,
 but I, you know, in the spirit of whatever,
 I, my number gets called, I'm like the second to last
 or third to last person.
 And I go and steal these earrings off of Leona.
 And so she was like, I knew I wouldn't get
 to keep them, you know, kind of thing.
 And so, but anyway, so I had those and then somebody else went
 and then when that person went and stole something
 from Leona as well, Leona came back and got the earrings.
 And I was like, and so there's two guests left on the table.
 And I, because there's two steels that have happened,
 I have to take a gift from the table.
 So I go over and I'm like looking at them.
 Anyway, I pick one and I open it and it's a fish.
 somebody has brought a fish to a white elephant.
 And it's, you know, like it's in a bag,
 but it's coming with the, you know, the fish nutsaw.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>This is a dark game.
 (laughs)
 Fish food.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And all that kind of stuff.
 Anyway, and I was like, oh my gosh,
 this is amazing.
 The kids are gonna love this.
 They've been asking for a pet.
 This is great.
 This is so great, you know?
 And it's, I promise you, the ugliest fish I've ever seen.
 It was some sort of weird-eyed fish where the eyes were like on the top.
 It was such an ugly fish, but I was like, I don't even think they're going to care.
 I think they're going to love this ugly fish.
 And, but then the last person goes and they steal the fish and you can't steal
 something back.
 And so I was like, which it was appropriate.
 This was a younger girl who wants to give it to her sister for Christmas.
 And I'm like, I mean, realistically, I can buy a fish, you know?
 So I go and steal the earrings back, of course,
 which I'm super happy I got the earrings.
 But anyway, all that to say, as I'm driving home,
 I realized I was so excited to be able to give the kids a pet
 'cause they've been wanting a pet.
 And Tia really has been like,
 like was it last year, two years ago,
 some random person on Christmas day dropped off.
  </li><li>It wasn't Christmas day.
  </li><li>It was, oh my gosh, your story.
  </li><li>It was on Christmas 'cause the Jacksons were here.
  </li><li>It is fanatical.
  </li><li>Was it not Christmas day?
  </li><li>Day after Christmas?
  </li><li>It wasn't Christmas day.
 I don't even remember it being Christmas.
  </li><li>It was Christmas, us, Tia.
 It was Christmas.
 It was around Christmas.
 And because I remember we were,
 I was on the phone with Lindsey
 who was trying to pick up these rabbits
 that had been dropped off and take them to the shelter
 while we were doing the Christmas lights tour
 at Opry Land.
 So it was Christmas, the Jackson's were here.
  </li><li>So somebody drops off two rabbits at our house.
  </li><li>One rabbit in each box in front of each minivan
 and disappears.
 And we're like, what the?
 you know, like why?
 And they're massive rabbits and we were not looking for,
 but Tia has been sad for two years
 that we gave away those rabbits.
  </li><li>Okay, Tia has not been sad for two years.
  </li><li>She has, she mentions them all the time.
 Anyway.
  </li><li>This is what I'm facing.
  </li><li>So anyway.
  </li><li>We're getting puppies.
  </li><li>No, so the kids have also wanted puppies,
 but because we're adopting, I'm like,
 I am not ready for that.
 That's like adding another baby into this scenario.
 And I'm convinced you and I would be doing--
  </li><li>This is the longest story I've got to the end.
  </li><li>All the care, anyway, so I did a little bit of research
 and then yesterday I went to the pet store
 to just talk to somebody about--
  </li><li>I don't know, talk, just purely research.
  </li><li>It's purely research, you know,
 our hamsters good, our chinchilla is good,
 like, what would work for a good first pet?
 And talk to the lady there, and I don't really like hamsters,
 they're just like little rats or little mice, I mean,
 But anyway, she said, no, you want to get a guinea pig.
 OK, so they're cleanest brother.
 Yeah, so you come home without the bit about your dad, I might add, just launches
 into OK, we've got a great idea.
 I think I've heard from God.
 You played the God.
 Because I haven't bring about all week, like I want to get this great gift for the kids.
 And I thought I'm not saying the Lord has said, get them guinea pigs.
 That's not what I'm saying.
 This is what I'm talking about the podcast because it kind of brings it down from.
 No, honestly, the Lord in person visited me.
 No, he never said that.
 I never said that.
 No, but also Tia hasn't for two years been sad about.
 Well, she's mentioned it.
 OK, OK, so you don't break it from.
 She's had clinical depression for two years.
 Unable to get out of bed.
 Look, back at the five minutes ago, I never said she was unable to get out of bed
 or was clinically depressed.
 I said, she is been sad that we gave away those funnies.
 I don't know if you ever since ago where we're talking about like you're you know
 you're the love for a plan sometimes gets confused as no but God's told me all right
 right is this one of those things or is this just a and what I feel like is you're
 about to spend a couple hundred dollars on disappointment because after the first
 couple days the kids are not going to be interested in them they're never going
 clean out that they're never going to clean out their stuff.
 And there's potential they're going to lose and drop them or they're going to die.
 And so I'm like, what, like, why are we doing this?
 And you said, we don't even know that they want them.
 I haven't heard them mention that they want pets and they won't care for them.
 And blah, blah, blah.
 So today at lunch, you sort of soft launch.
 I soft launch.
 Hey, mommy's the psychopath and she's decided to ruin our lives.
 Who do you trust more?
 Mommy or daddy for picking Christmas presents.
 And two of them pointed to me and only, only MJ thought you might have a good idea of what he wants.
 Which fair enough, you do.
 He doesn't really want to pet.
 No, but both the girls want.
 I really hope our kids don't listen to our podcast.
 I mean, I don't think they do.
 We'll keep them from listening somehow.
 So, Adrian wants to get guinea pigs to guinea pigs.
 You have to get to because they have to, they're like, um, not friendship animals.
 They stay in groups.
 I don't know why you call them.
 They need to be together.
  </li><li>They're pen piles.
  </li><li>They're pen piles.
  </li><li>They like, yeah, anyway.
 They like to cuddle.
  </li><li>It's illegal in Switzerland to own one guinea pig.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, the pet smart said,
 they prefer that you not to sell just one.
 Like they're like, you know.
  </li><li>But did you point out to American,
 we can do what we want?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I don't know whether the reason is
 that somebody might be just adding a second
 to their original guinea pig or whatever, but they're,
 it doesn't matter.
  </li><li>Anyway, the point is,
 The point is this afternoon I want to go and buy.
 Oh, wait, is that?
 Can't we even let this episode get released
 and get feedback from listeners?
 Oh, absolutely.
 So what's the point of telling the story?
 No, because they're going to enjoy that.
 That's what you're doing.
 Listen, I've talked to some moms that have had guinea pigs
 at home, including your sister.
 Yeah.
 And I've talked to also a friend who-they 
 had hamsters, not guinea pigs.
 But they're like, you would be surprised how much joy
 that kids get out of just having this,
 a little furry thing to take care of.
 And so--
  </li><li>So effectively I'm overruled, is that okay?
  </li><li>You're overruled, and I want to go and pick up
 the guinea pigs today before somebody else
 buys the two cute ones I saw yesterday.
  </li><li>Can we please call them Thor and Loki?
  </li><li>Well, I think the girls get to name the guinea pigs,
 but you could suggest that.
 Certainly one of the two guinea pigs I saw,
 one of them is black and brown,
 and the other one is white and beige.
 So you could have Thor and Loki.
 You could have Lincoln Zelda.
  </li><li>You know, Lincoln Zelda.
  </li><li>And so they're both girls, aren't they?
  </li><li>They're both girls, but who cares?
  </li><li>Well, yeah.
  </li><li>So, yeah.
  </li><li>So my dream of getting a puppy, we just got crushed.
  </li><li>Well, we weren't going to get a puppy anytime soon.
 We need to get baby, have baby trained,
 and have kids that actually have shown some responsibility,
 perhaps with guinea pigs.
  </li><li>Our kids can't even brush their teeth on a regular basis,
 let alone care for another animal.
  </li><li>I think this is a great opportunity for them to learn.
  </li><li>Okay. - Yes.
  </li><li>Well, clearly, it sounded like--
  </li><li>We're getting kitty pics.
 (laughing)
 I'm so excited.
 And I think I'm just gonna lock them in Kate's old room
 for right now.
 I'm gonna lock the door so that the kids can't get in.
 And I'm gonna-- - But the trick was,
 Abby needs to move in Kate's room.
  </li><li>Well, not 'til next week.
 And by then, I will move them into our closet.
 Yeah. - It's almost like
 I have no say in this.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You want them to have a wonderful Christmas
 where they feel surprised and excited
 and they're gonna have a great time.
  </li><li>Well, I'm surprisingly in need of,
 you don't wanna just sign on the memory of my dead father.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I'm not saying that at all.
 And I just say, if you let me get this,
 I can see that ace though,
 poking here with your sweetie.
 On the topic of babies.
  </li><li>Yes, thanks.
  </li><li>We got some amazing news.
 So we are fundraising the moment
 to help pay for our adoption.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we've been working with a 501(c)(3)
 organization called Lifesong for Orphan.
  </li><li>Yes.
 a phenomenal organization.
 And one of the reasons we're really interested in fundraising with them is at least here in America,
 I think charitable donations work differently in different countries.
 It certainly works differently in the United Kingdom.
 But here in America, if I donate $5,000 to a charitable organization,
 I will get a tax receipt that allows me to offset $5 from my taxes.
 So it really, really incentivizes people to give.
 And Lifesong for adoption, we applied to them to say,
 "Hey, we're interested in adopting."
 And so they did a background check, they've had us,
 they looked at all our finances, they saw our blah, blah, blah.
 And they got back to us and said, "Yeah, you absolutely can."
  </li><li>Yeah, so they've approved us to be able to give tax receipts.
  </li><li>Which is great.
 So if you're an American taxpayer
 and you would like to donate,
 you can get a tax deductible receipt for your giving.
 That's beautiful, that would be enough.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But then shock of all shocks earlier this week,
 they wrote us and said,
 Hey, we've given you a $10,000 matching grant.
 Right.
 Which is amazing.
 We were like huge amounts.
 Huge amounts.
 So any gifts that are given up to $10,000 will automatically be matched.
 Yes.
 And one of the so life song are putting up five grand of that.
 So big thank you to life song.
 Yes.
 So, Tim Tebow's foundation.
 Which is giving the other five, which I think is, you know, at least I know who Tim Tebow is.
 He's a famous hockey player.
 And I only know he's not a hockey player. You're so funny. I didn't catch that to be in football.
 Yeah, I don't think I could pick him out in the crowd. I don't even know how to play for it.
 But I know he's a Christian. He's a Christian. And the only reason that I know about them is
 our friends, the Tanny Hills, talk about, you know, Tim Tebow Tim Tebow. So a big thanks to Tim Tebow
 Foundation as well for putting up that. So that was big adoption news. We haven't heard anything
 knew about being matched with a birth mom or like that.
  </li><li>We have not, we've applied with a new agency.
  </li><li>Yep, we've talked about that.
  </li><li>Yep, just wait.
  </li><li>And then the last couple of weeks
 have just been nonstop Christmas parties.
  </li><li>So many Christmas parties.
  </li><li>Well, only three.
  </li><li>Well, it feels like a lot more.
  </li><li>Well, I think 'cause we're both introverts
 and even though we love people,
 parties like that are definitely a spend
 'cause it's so much interacting.
 And I was talking to, again, my therapist
 And he was like, why do you think it's a spend for you?
 I'm like, well, I just, because I want to be present
 with each conversation and I feel like, you know,
 I spend to do that.
 And even though I really love and enjoy the people
 I'm talking to afterwards, I'm like, oh my gosh,
 I need to just be with myself in silence.
 Like when we drove home from one of the parties,
 it had been like a pretty loud reverberating kind of room
 with lots of TV screens and stimulus
 and then, you know, lots of people.
 And so we got in the car and you put on Nora Jones
 I was like, please turn it off.
 I really don't even want to talk.
 Like I just need, I need silence.
 Cause I just like, it's too much for me.
  </li><li>And so we arrive home.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I come in and I'm chatting to our babysitters
 and I'm saying goodbye to our babysitters.
 I'm like five or six minutes have passed.
 And I'm like, where is AJ?
 I'm so like, I go back into the garage and I open the door
 and she's sitting in a lot of car with the car off
 in the dark and I'm like, are you okay?
 She's like, just let me have some more silence
 and then I'll come in.
 So yeah, it was a spat.
 I had a need for silence.
 And teaching I taught in boundaries and I've taught on what's the other thing I taught on brain science.
 Yeah.
 You've taught at M&amp;A.
 I did.
 Last talk.
 Yeah.
 Oh, we had the fun of helping out children's ministry.
 Yes.
 Last week and also this week we're going to be helping kids ministries.
 Yeah.
 So that's all.
 I've really enjoyed that.
 I've really enjoyed getting to meet new people
 to our church and welcome them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I've really enjoyed, just as a great,
 where you stand, everybody who's dropping off kids,
 you can say hello to them.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think too, like I've always thought
 our children's ministry does a great job,
 like, you know, sharing and charlotte and everything.
 But I've become more aware of just how much stuff goes
 into making Sunday morning look easy.
 So just super impressed with our team.
 So yeah, do you want to talk to them about your new Apple fitness regime?
 I don't want to bring up.
 You're new.
 Is there a particular one that you want me to talk about?
 You're doing.
 Yes.
 The, uh, the dance fitness.
 Okay.
 So our daughter, Tia, who's 12.
 Yes.
 As you got a new Apple watch for her birthday.
 Yes.
 And then you gave her your old Apple watch.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Just wondering if T is going to be into it.
 Tia is super into it.
 And so.
 We're into closing her rings.
 Yeah.
 So Tia challenged me to a fitness battle.
 Yeah.
 And you thought you were just going to annihilate her.
  </li><li>Oh, she was just 12.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>No, she absolutely crushed me.
 I won, which isn't the same much,
 'cause you know, yeah, I beat a 12 year old girl
 a fit of athleticism.
 And I only won because she didn't go to youth that week.
 And if she'd gone to youth that week,
 I would have been--
  </li><li>And she goes to bed hours earlier than you do.
 So she has to be like, yeah, on it.
  </li><li>But anyway, in order to make sure
 that I beat my 12 year old daughter,
 I had to do the Apple fitness thing where you just,
 You can pick anything from like a high intensity workout to, you know,
 running on a treadmill to Pilates.
 I love it though.
 Yeah.
 I've really enjoyed it.
 Oh, yeah.
 It's great.
 Well, one morning I come down and I'm like, I've, you know,
 I've been hitting treadmill pretty hard.
 I've my shoulders are sore from doing some Pilates.
 I'm going to try dance, never having done dance.
 I'm like, I couldn't be bothered putting my shoes on.
 That was the thing.
 So I'm like, I'm in our, I'm in our area on the stuff.
 It literally was that one or she was all right.
 Okay.
 And so I've had work in dance speed and I confirmed what I've always suspected, which is I have no internal sense of rhythm or coordination.
 Like none.
 And it is clear from watching the video that like in a lot of the Apple fitness videos, there's the main person and then to the left of the person as you're looking on the screen to the right of them is somebody doing kind of like a step down modified version.
 So if you're new to treadmill, you have somebody walking instead of running.
 If you're doing a, you know, I don't know, a Pilates workout or a high intensity
 workout, instead of doing like a press up, you'll do a knee press up.
 They'll show you the modified version, no such modified versions with a dance.
 And with the way that I just go, okay, and then we're going to walk to the right for
 four and two, three, and then to the left.
 But they're like grapevine.
 And I'm lost.
 And they're like, you know, and then back and then knee kick.
 And then I'm trying to do it all right.
 And I am so uncoordinated.
 So, so I don't realize that's what he's doing this particular morning.
 And all I can hear is him downstairs laughing and then saying stuff.
 And I thought he was working out while on the phone with somebody that he was
 laughing about jokes.
 I couldn't figure out what was going on until he starts yelling, AJ, AJ.
 And then I thought, Oh my gosh, she's falling off the treadmill.
 Uh, so I come down.
 She has.
 And in fact, uh, the whole thing was him talking to the screen and howling laughing.
 Well, he's cause I can't do a thing.
 Like he can't do it.
 Over the course of half an hour, I got the walking to the right and wasn't
 too late.
 But then they start putting in an upper body part that you're supposed to do
 syncopated with walking.
 I cannot do it.
 It's the funniest thing.
 I literally, because so where I was standing, the screen is sort of beside me,
 but I'm watching him and he's watching the screen trying to do it.
 And I cannot imagine what it is that they're doing on the screen to.
 That's producing my results.
 He's doing what he's doing.
 And so like I watch him for a few minutes and he's like,
 "No, it's building a routine and it's the same thing over and over again."
 And I watch him and I'm like, "What the heck?"
 And then I look at the screen and I'm like, "Oh my gosh."
  </li><li>And you're looking at three graceful dancers who are syncopating.
  </li><li>Oh my God, they're not graceful dancers.
 They're really not, but you're like...
  </li><li>I'm so ungainly that they look graceful.
  </li><li>Wow. - That's what you're saying?
 So anyway, what I've done is I've committed to doing that routine once a week until I can do it.
 Yeah. And then you're going to like perform it for Ben and Sarah when they come for Christmas.
 Nobody needs to see it live.
 No, that night I was telling the kids and they're like, can you show us it?
 And so I put it on and all of us try to do it.
 Yeah. And it was just calamity.
 You were a dancer, weren't you?
 Yeah, I did. I did that routine. I didn't find it difficult.
 Yeah, I did.
 I want to watch you do the routine. I'll be the judge of that.
 Okay. I'll be the judge of that.
 I've since done a couple of them because I thought he had so much fun doing that and I had fun doing it in the kitchen while I was.
 I'm not sure I had fun. I think I hit that whole thing of how can I be this bad at it?
 Like it didn't strike me as a complicated routine. It's right to me as basic building blocks.
 It strikes you.
 Struck?
 I don't know.
 You know, you.
 I've had some brain damage, but like even clapping on a beat four times, I just.
 I was I was tricky. I understand I was really tricky anyway. Listen guys if I can somehow sneak a video
 Violation about what do you did?
 I don't know. Do you?
 She because Allen said you know I'm gonna come on guys like do this dance videos with me
 I'll show you how hard it is and Tia went and got her phone and she's figured out how to run her video like to record video
 From her watch so that nobody knows that she's recording
 So she plays her phone to try and like start it so that she could sneakily, but Alan caught on to her before she got her
 Sneaking is from somewhere. Yes, it wasn't me. I'm not sneaking. I'm just adorable
 Thanks
 Vegetables wonderful yes, you can serve them with vegetables too in some parts of the world. Oh wow
 All right, our main topic this week on that note a couple of weeks ago,
 we were talking about five things we didn't know about therapy.
 Yes, we've got some great feedback.
 People said, do one about five things I didn't know about inner healing.
 Oh, OK, so that's what we're going to do.
 That's where you got the.
 Yeah, that's where I got the idea from.
 I thought you didn't know what we were going to be talking about.
 I was like, I asked you.
 I know I have my five points.
 I just didn't know that's where.
 Yeah.
 And I don't know like we talked a little bit about the difference
 the distinction between inner healing and therapy and the process ultimately leads to
 whole-hearted living. Yes. But I would say that inner healing is an approach to applying
 what Jesus paid for on the cross to the emotional and relational aspects of her life. Right.
 But do you feel that? I'm trying to think of... I suppose to... Well, if nobody's familiar
 with inner... I didn't know what inner healing was until my late twenties. I didn't know what
 it was. And it's, you know, it's a broad category of prayers to bring freedom to you.
 Yeah, prayers and prayer methods to, yeah, unhook from things.
 Right. So if you're stuck in patterns.
 Yes. So also there's like, where, where for me therapy doesn't seem to have touched the
 spiritual stuff. Yeah.
 Inner healing is like disconnecting from spiritual things as well.
 Virtual realities that are keeping you...
 Yeah, eating your lunch.
 Hintered.
 Yeah.
 From receiving what Jesus has already purchased for you.
 Yes.
 Do I get to go first as we do?
 You go first, yeah.
 Yeah, no, I'm interested in what you got.
 Or we could alternate, but that'll get confusing.
 Just do one through five.
 No, I get to go first.
 All right, point number one, go.
 Forgiveness is super powerful.
 So I think if there was one thing we got really, really good at
 was forgiveness.
 we'd probably experience much more healing.
 You know, with forgiveness being super powerful,
 it counteracts things like bitterness and resentment
 and things that--
  </li><li>I'm packed that a little bit for us.
  </li><li>So it's kind of the opposite.
 Like we can find ourselves,
 or when we find ourselves operating in bitterness
 or in resentment, the key to that is releasing forgiveness.
 But sometimes because we feel so justified
 about being mad about something-having 
 bitterness.
  </li><li>And, well, I don't think originally
 we're going for bitterness.
 We're just, we're mad, we're sad, we're whatever,
 but we camp there and we don't release forgiveness.
 And eventually that's always gonna become bitterness.
  </li><li>You said that and I just wondered
 if there's a big difference between inner healing
 and therapy is because one of the things
 we've taught for years, which I do think is important,
 is often we stay not forgiving
 because we don't feel like it.
 Yes.
 Well, you don't understand, I'm so horror,
 and I think one of the shortcomings of us is,
 well, just forgive and then the hurt will go away.
 Like one of the shortcomings of our approach.
 But also just because you don't feel like you need to forgive
 or you can't forgive doesn't mean that you shouldn't.
 Right, and the thing is scripturally,
 we don't get that out.
 We don't get that option.
 Yeah, that's not an option for us.
 It's, you know, you need to forgive
 as your father in heaven forgave you.
 I mean, there's not, there's not a option to not forgive,
 but certainly I've chosen that option a number of times.
 I remember John Arnott saying,
 the evangelical church has done a wonderful job
 of preaching the need for forgiveness of our sins,
 but has done a terrible job in helping people
 understand that they too need to forgive.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I would say that I had no clue the power
 of forgiveness to I heard your testimony.
 You would be the person who introduced me to that.
  </li><li>Oh wow, that's cool.
 Yeah, so I mean, again, moving away from forgiveness
 moves us towards bitterness, judgment, resentment,
 and those are all places we don't want to live
 from as believers.
 So the power of forgiveness, it's awesome.
  </li><li>One of the things that I've heard
 is that we don't want to forgive somebody
 until they've actually repented.
 What do you think about that?
  </li><li>I don't, again, scripturally, it doesn't say,
 "Go ahead and wait until they've repented."
 Many of the people that I've forgiven and family included,
 they've never said that they're sorry.
 They won't own it.
 It doesn't matter.
 Scripturally, my responsibility is still
 to release forgiveness when I recognize that I'm hard-growing after them.
 Yeah.
 You're not forgiving them for them.
 Yes.
 I mean, one of the things that I quote from this email that I got like 20 years ago was,
 there was this line that said, "To forgive is to set the prisoner free and then realize
 the prisoner was you."
 I think that's the deal.
 Like, I think we forgive for us, which is why it's in the book.
 Like, actually for you, for you to walk out this Christian lifestyle, get good at forgiveness.
  </li><li>That's the parable of the unmerciful servant, isn't it?
 What are the most common obstacles you hear
 for why people don't forgive?
 Most common reasons they give?
  </li><li>I think a lot of people think,
 "Well, if I forgive, that means what they did was okay,
 "which it doesn't."
  </li><li>If I forgive you, it means what you did to me was okay,
 or doesn't matter.
  </li><li>Right, it doesn't matter.
 It's not important that I was hurt or any of those things.
 And that's not true.
 You're not saying any of that.
 You're simply saying, "Hey, I recognize you owe me a debt.
 "I release you from the debt you owe me."
 And you don't have to have that conversation with that.
 No.
 Like one of the most down mistakes.
 No, I think that's one of the mistakes we make.
 Is that, you know, hey, Alan, you know,
 tell us the real story from you being at the conference.
 Oh, and Jack Frost.
 Oh, yeah, we were, it was a conference when we were in Toronto
 and Jack had said, you know, if there's anyone in the room
 that you need to forgive, just go ahead and forgive them.
 And he's, you know, taking it into this ministry time.
 And so during the ministry time, this person came up
 and sat down and she said, you know,
 I forgive you for, and she got super emotional.
 She was like walking by me at every conference
 and never saying hello and never giving me a hug.
 And so she's going on and on.
 I have no idea who this woman is.
 Like wait, there was thousands of people
 that came to every conference,
 but she had taken personal offense at me not stopping
 and hugging her and talking to her.
  </li><li>I didn't know who she was.
  </li><li>I didn't know who she was.
 Yeah.
 So we don't need to do that.
 I mean, for me, I was like, you know, like I--
  </li><li>Thanks, kind stranger.
  </li><li>I had no idea and actually this was between you and God,
 not you, me and God.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, and really that's the case,
 even if you do know the person,
 you need to do your work on your end first.
 And at some point the Lord orchestrates a conversation
 or challenges you to have a conversation, great.
 You know, but do your work first.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>Number two--
  </li><li>Number two, go for it.
 is how easily it is to be making friends with your ungodly beliefs.
 Okay, well, first of all, you have to explain what ungodly belief is.
 Okay.
 So according to Kaelstra's, an ungodly belief is something that appears to be
 absolutely true based on the facts of your experience, but is absolutely false
 based on God's word.
 So you may have an ungodly belief that God doesn't love me or God doesn't care
 about me, but scripture says things like he's loved you with an
 everlasting love or he's numbered the hairs on your head or, you know, so it's a belief that is
 at odds with Scripture, but we absolutely believe it because of some things that we've experienced.
 And ungodly beliefs are super tricky because they masquerade sometime as wisdom, right?
 I helped me understand that.
 Well, they're things that we use to protect ourselves because of our experience, right?
 So we may even have ungodly beliefs or UGBs as we call them for a short form that are things like
 never trust a man, you know. So for me, I had some ungodly beliefs around men because of course,
 I had an enormous amount of abuse as a child. Then I had my first husband who had an affair and left.
 When you've been married before?
 very funny. And so I set up like a whole, I had no idea, I'd set up a whole new set of
 ungodly beliefs to protect me from men. So the heart that men call men are, you know, men are not
 trustworthy. Things like now that I'm my experience, they haven't been. So to me, that seems true.
 And if you get close to men, untrustworthy, right? And it really was like tearing those
 things down that allowed me to even be able to have relationship with you when you came along.
 You know what I mean? So they seem like wisdom, but actually they're often robbing life from us in ways that we have no idea.
 Here's the funny thing about ungodly belief and by funny, I mean horrifying.
 Yeah.
 Is you can know all about ungodly beliefs and the knowledge of what they are and where they come from and how they operate.
 Yeah.
 Doesn't keep you from making new ones.
 For making new ones or even having one.
 No.
 And part of the problem with ungodly belief is they, like you said, they sound like wisdom or they sound like truth.
 other, especially your core on God beliefs, they're impossible for you to see because they back up
 your reality. And I remember when we did our healing week with Chester and Betsy, and I remember
 Chester read to me like 12 or 14 ungodly beliefs. I argued with him about every single one of them,
 like that's not an ungodly belief because of X, Y and Z. Because it was so true to me, like,
 you know, and also like I need to fight for it to be true. Because if it's if I'm wrong about
 that, then what else about my outlook is wrong?
 Right. And these are the things I used to protect my heart from being disappointed.
 And you sing all that sounds like very cognitive and it isn't. It's all down here.
 You know that I'm doing this to protect me. Nobody thinks like that. It's all this kind of like
 under the surface stuff. Can you remember any ungodly beliefs that, you know,
 majorly shifted stuff for you in your life?
 I mean, a big one for me was I had an ungodly belief that sounded a lot like
 it's not safe to love if you love they will leave.
 And so never let anybody close enough that you can be disappointed when they go.
 But as you can imagine, that means you have absolutely no real relationships at all.
 So you feel lonely anyway.
 You're trying to protect yourself from feeling lonely and you create an environment
 where now you are lonely all the time.
 Do you remember where that ungodly belief or how that ungodly belief got identified?
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I think I was teaching on ungodly beliefs
 on one of the encounter weekends in Toronto.
 And the Lord was like,
 hey, do you wanna talk about the ones
 that you've been making recently?
 And this was like, oh, I mean, I'm teaching on it.
 And I was like, I'm not making more, am I?
 But this again was between,
 after my first husband had left in,
 and this is where I realized, oh my gosh,
 I've made a whole new set.
 And again, I get it.
 It's based on my experience.
 And we make them so quickly that we don't even realize, you know?
 But for an instant, they make us feel protected.
 But for the rest of the time, they just rob life.
 They're absolutely stealing life from me.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And godly beliefs are not your friends.
 They are not your friends.
 They're they are.
 They are as great as wisdom.
 They're vicious.
 OK, number three.
 Number three is there is nothing that God cannot heal.
 Oh, I love that.
 I've certainly had this perception.
 like I remember feeling like I am so broken.
 I am so messed up.
 There's no possible way that God can heal me.
 I mean, He can heal the people with the less scary testimonies
 that might, you know, but there's just no possible way
 that God could heal me being as messed up as I am.
 And I have seen Him over and over and over again
 do exactly what I thought He could not do.
 And so just that there's nobody that God cannot heal.
 Now, it's gonna require work on our end, right?
 We have to actually do our part to partner with Holy Spirit
 and work through the things that he's bringing up.
 And that doesn't mean digging in your own garden
 and constantly like looking at your own navel.
 Like, oh, what's next?
 What should I go for?
 But just responding to God as he brings things up
 and realize, hey, he is gonna complete what he started in
 and what he started is healing you up
 and making you look like Jesus.
 So that's my number three is there's nothing God can't heal.
 One of the biggest juxtapositions I experienced when I met you, and so you got to remember
 that I met you as a public figure before I ever met you as a person.
 So I actually remember a year before I ever met you in person, I came to a conference
 and you were the keynote speaker.
 You were a breakout speaker.
 One of the speakers.
 You were teaching on Martha Plexi.
 And then a year later I'm in the school and you're teaching and you're sharing your testimony
 And I remember being unable to reconcile the story you were telling with the person who was telling it.
 Because I was like, you're so radiant.
 You're so full of hope.
 You're so full of love.
 And I don't know how somebody who's endured what you endured comes out the other side looking like that.
 And I remember you saying, guys, you don't get it.
 I was the person that people would walk around at church.
 Like I was just this aching bottomless pit of need.
 Yeah.
 I was just, I just don't recognize you as that at all.
 And that's very sweet. Thank you. I mean, again, that's why I'm saying you have to, you have to actually do the work. Like, I recognize I can't keep living the way I'm living. And I could feel the Holy Spirit going, Hey, there's something better. Hey, there's something more. But you still have to go and realize, Oh, there's for me, I felt like there's a whole bunch of work to do before I get to where I live from hope and that kind of stuff.
 from hope and that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>And one of the work you have to do comes at number two
 because you probably had an ungodly belief
 that God can heal everybody else except me.
  </li><li>Oh, absolutely.
  </li><li>So you had to come to terms with that ungodly belief
 that you could before. - And there was so much
 forgiveness to do, like layers and layers
 and forgiving like my dad, my family,
 for the same thing over and over again,
 every time it came up, not letting it go,
 not letting it fester.
  </li><li>Well, it's interesting you said,
 'cause not only would you be forgiving the same thing
 in the past, but how it affects me in the present.
  </li><li>Well also those patterns of behavior
 would be repeated afresh.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>You're like, oh I need to read for the views of it.
  </li><li>Yeah, but just realizing my other option is,
 I mean I was, I had a need to disorder, I was suicidal,
 I was barely, I mean these are my options.
 I can stay letting the enemy eat my lunch
 or I can apply everything that's been given to me
 because of the cross and all of these kingdom values
 and see what God can do with my life.
 To me, those are the two options.
 This one's gonna take so much more work.
 This option of forgiveness and working through,
 yes, it's good, but there's life at the end of that one.
 I don't know what I look like if I'd stayed in the other.
 Well, I mean, I'm confident I wouldn't be here.
  </li><li>Well, it's terrifying. - Yeah.
 You ready for number four?
  </li><li>All right, hit me with number four.
  </li><li>True identity is on the other side of inner healing.
 But so basically what I mean is,
 I am not what I survived.
 My identity isn't wrapped up in my testimony.
 My identity is wrapped up in who God says I am.
 Again, that's only on the other side of inner healing.
 I don't think you get to live that way.
 I mean, you could probably brute force live that way.
  </li><li>I know a lot of people who do.
  </li><li>Yeah, brute force live it.
 Throw scripture first at it.
  </li><li>But you know, whatever.
  </li><li>I don't have to fight for my identity.
  </li><li>Yeah, when people are doing the thing
 that you're describing,
 It feels like they're handing you a resume
 or a marketing pamphlet and say,
 "Hey, believe this about my life."
  </li><li>Yeah, as opposed to just experiencing what you radiate.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 It's like, yeah, if you have to tell somebody who you are,
 they're never gonna believe you.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 So, I mean, that's a kind of a short one, but it's just--
  </li><li>I'll take a short one, number five.
  </li><li>Number five is, I already kind of referenced this,
 but it's worth the work.
 to get to the other side of healing.
 And if you get stuck, get help.
 I think there's many wonderful,
 and we've referenced them,
 many wonderful different inner healing type tools
 and ministries out there for, hey, I'm trying to do this.
 I'm trying to work my process.
 I'm trying to get healed, and I need help.
 I think that's a worthy investment of time, of resources.
 Do the work, get the help,
 because on the other side, you're gonna go,
 Oh, freedom is something that is,
 there's, you can't put a price on it.
 Those are my five, what are your five?
  </li><li>Well, I wanna pause and say,
 I didn't understand anything about inner healing
 till my late twenties.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I read about it called the transformation
 of the inner man by John and Paul.
  </li><li>It's like a huge, it's such a good book, but it's--
  </li><li>It is, so John and Paul and Samford
 are really kind of the great grandparents of inner healing.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I knew nothing about it, like nothing about it.
 And it's kind of really a resource book that you dip into,
 not necessarily something you start at the beginning
 and work through.
  </li><li>Yeah, but that is what I did.
 I read through the whole thing.
  </li><li>I was like, I don't understand any of this.
 And here's my first point.
 Inner healing is basically just the process of sanctification.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So the church culture I grew up on was big on sanctification,
 the sanctification is by which the way
 that we are being made holy.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Neither writer of Hebrews talks about
 were both made holy and being made holy.
 So it's the process of walking out
 and becoming more Christ-like.
 But nobody ever talked to me about inner healing
 and actually nobody ever talked to me
 about the process of sanctification
 other than it was something that just happened to you.
 Like life circumstances are sanctification.
 Not understanding that you could sign up
 and you could speed up the process.
 And that like a lot of the stuff that was happening to you
 wasn't sanctification.
 It was just the results of your judgments,
 your bitterness, demonic strongholds.
  </li><li>Yeah, you did.
  </li><li>And I didn't know any of that.
 So I think Inner Healing was just kind of like
 this vague voodoo new age thing, right?
 Until I understood what it is.
 And I'm like, oh, it's just a biblical process
 of being made more Christ-like.
 It's the work of the Holy Spirit.
 So that would be the first thing I did not know was,
 oh, it's just another word and another way
 that you become sanctified.
  </li><li>Yeah, good.
  </li><li>Number two.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And this could sound depressing.
 Is the inner healing is never done? Oh, yeah, it's not like oh, I did inner healing. I did an encounter. I'm healed. I did a healing week. Yeah, I did a weekend away. I did, you know, a thief.
 Yeah, you know, healing inner healing isn't something that you have done. It's something you continue to do until glory.
 I'm going process and that can sound depressing to some people or can sound powerless to some people. Well, why do it if you're never done? I'm like, well, one where we live in a fallen world.
 And number two, the very nature of inner healing is that it's progressive.
 So the stuff that I'm working on this year in many ways is just like a plane,
 like a woodworking plane, just an iterative process of the same thing I've worked on maybe 10 years ago.
 And it's just like surprise, this thing's showing up.
 And it's not, it didn't work the first time. It's just another layer of healing, refinement, sanctification has happened.
 Gotcha. And then equally the stuff that I've worked on this year that I don't think I would ever have been able to work on if I hadn't had previous years of inner healing.
 Like I remember when we went to the Kaelstra's. So we went, Age and I went away for a week intensive of inner healing.
 And we greatly respect Chester and Betsy Kaelstra. And we are very familiar with the work, we've taught their work for gears.
 And in many ways we've been through the healing week material. And so Age and I are driving up there.
 And on the one hand, we don't want to be these kind of arrogant pastors who are like, we teach the stuff, you know, what could they possibly find because we know that's folly.
 And the other hand, we're genuinely doing an inventory of our soul going.
 I don't know what I don't know what we're going to focus on this week, because all of the big stuff in our life, we've brought into the light, we've dealt with it's not like I'm like, well, it's finally time for me, let go of my cocaine addiction and maybe you should walk in light about your secret porn addiction.
 Like there was nothing like we were literally curious and then we get there and there's just
 this wealth of stuff we didn't know that needed to be dealt with. And that would be an example
 of, and I remember speaking to Chester about that, like, how was all of that there and we didn't see
 it? And Chester talked to me about this, two verses in the Old Testament, Deuteronomy 7.22 and I think
 Exodus 23.29. They're both about the same thing, but the people of God are inheriting the promised
 land and the Lord says to them, I'm not going to go and drive out all the enemies in the land at once,
 because it would be too overwhelming for you. And I thought, that's kind of like inner healing.
 Like God and his wisdom, you deal with it process by process by process. You deal with this hurt and
 this area of unforgiveness and this area of stubbornness. And you know, you're in one
 sense, you're never done. And that's one of the things that we get. You know, we meet people all
 the time who or maybe they do SSL and they're just like, well, it didn't work because you
 know, I did a year two and issues from year one still came up. But I'm like, yeah, I'm
 going. You dealt with it for you applied 20 minutes of ministry time to something that's
 been affecting your life for 20 20 years. Give it a chance, you know, let you know, continue
 to work out. So yeah, it's it's not a thing you did. It's something you continue to do.
 I thought that we John and Carol would say they would go for an inner healing appointment
 every two years.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And they would say, it's like the dentist.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You go to the dentist when there's nothing wrong
 for a checkup.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you sometimes go to the dentist
 when there is something wrong.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And in life there will be presenting issues.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Maybe, I don't know, you get married
 and suddenly you have this issue
 where I don't believe I can trust my spouse.
 Where did that come from?
  </li><li>There's some things that don't come up
 until you're in a particular situation.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And there's other times, like I remember
 when my mom passed away, I remember meeting
 with Christine going, "Christine, I think I'm okay
 with my mom passing on the grief.
 Can I come and just become an appointment with you?
 Because I don't wanna lie to myself and just,
 there was nothing presenting and I just,
 wanted to come for it that I'm not lying to myself.
  </li><li>Can I tell you the funny thought
 that just went through my head?
 'Cause you were talking about when we went
 to see the Kaelstra's and we didn't think
 we had any big things and--
  </li><li>Well, again, yes, I suppose it's true.
 We didn't think.
  </li><li>No big presenting things that we knew,
 like we both went thinking,
 I have no idea what they're gonna touch on.
 And for me that week,
 I mean, both of us were, it was different than we expected.
 But for me that week, they kept saying,
 "No, no, I don't want you to read the extra thing.
 I want you to rest."
 No, no, I want you to do that.
 I want you to rest."
 And that became like a,
 what, they're making me read and you're get to rest.
  </li><li>Oh, they gave me so much access to the whole world.
  </li><li>And I remember just feeling like,
 oh, I get to rest 'cause, you know,
 I guess I've just, I've done years of work
 and this is great that I get to rest.
 And I just thought about it.
 Like I was just thinking about how much joy I had in,
 I get to rest and I never realized until just this moment
 that actually that would have been
 because being not being able to rest
 was one of my big issues.
 Like I was, I would always strive, perform.
 You know, like that was my thing.
 And really looking back,
 it was probably seven years of the Lord talking to me
 about rest before I started implementing rest.
  </li><li>Wow.
 you know, like having a day of rest
 and figuring out how important this was.
 So I was sort of, like I'm literally sitting here
 sort of laughing like, oh God, you're so funny
 'cause I was thinking, oh yeah, they just wanted me to rest.
 Isn't that sweet?
 Not realizing, yes, it's sweet,
 but actually it was the Lord saying,
 hey, this is what's eating your lunch.
 You don't actually know how to enter into rest.
  </li><li>And as I said, inner healing is never done.
  </li><li>It's never done.
 So I just, I was just sort of having a little snicker
 with the Lord like, oh, you're so funny and clever.
 And I never saw that until just now.
 So anyway.
  </li><li>All right, number three.
  </li><li>Number three.
  </li><li>It is essential in our Christian faith
 to understand that God works both in sovereignty
 and in process.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So some of the most vocal critics of inner healing,
 people who would say inner healing is not needed,
 would call, you know, the oldest guy on the news come.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>All right, you know, your new creation.
  </li><li>Yeah, you're a new man.
 Yeah, and so it's all under the blood, it's all under the cross.
 Jesus died for it.
 We don't need to do any navel gazing.
 No Christian psycho-babbel.
 This is just pop psychology.
 Just get on with the work of the kingdom.
 You don't do anything.
 And so they love to quote that verse in secular,
 "Kornethins 517."
 That's Corinthians, not Kornethins.
 So they love to quote Paul's writing, like,
 "Hey, the oldest guy in the news come,
 "but hold you on my new creation in Christ."
 But they seemingly overlook the other areas of Paul's writing,
 like Romans 12, where he talks to us about
 is by renewing of the mind, present tense,
 that transformation happens,
 that we're to be people who walk out our faith
 with fear and trembling,
 or that we need to be people who get rid of all rage
 and anger and brawling and malice.
 Why are those things there in order for us
 to get rid of them if it's all under the cross?
 Or the instruction to put off the old man
 and put on the new.
 And so, of course, God works sovereignly.
 I think we can all recognize when we got saved,
 there were things that instantly changed about our life.
 Like, you know, we stopped smoking, for example,
 maybe the addiction of nicotine just went,
 or in your case, you stopped swearing like a trucker.
  </li><li>Well, that wasn't, that wasn't so.
  </li><li>No, that was, that was processed.
 You worked out.
  </li><li>But like, not to be funny, like I do have some things
 that like happened in an instant.
 Got touched down, it happened,
 I never struggled with eating disorders
 and suicidal thoughts from the moment
 that he encountered me at that one service.
  </li><li>Isn't that amazing?
  </li><li>But there's other things that I've had to walk out
 for years of just pressing in again, pressing in again,
 pressing in again for healing.
  </li><li>So I think having an understanding
 for Sovereign Train process is beautiful
 'cause it gives you something to do
 because I realize so much of my life,
 I outsource to, well, if God wants to do it,
 he will do it.
 His God is just sovereign.
 Not realizing that I can partner with him.
 Just simply in the book of James says,
 "If you draw near to God, he'd draw near to you."
 So actually, what are you laughing at?
  </li><li>He draws me, you said it,
 you just said it funny coming from the guy.
 Yeah, sorry, when I get excited.
  </li><li>He will draw near to you.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>You draw near to God and he will draw near to you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Resist a devil, submit to God, he will draw near to you.
 And so that whole thing of like,
 actually I can influence how intimate I am with the Lord.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Just by how I spend my time.
  </li><li>Draw near.
  </li><li>I didn't know that verse.
 I just thought, well, I guess some people are God's favorite
 and other people aren't.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And have a cold distant relationship with the Lord.
 I guess this is my lot in life and just parts of fear.
  </li><li>Right.
 As opposed to we have the level of relationship we want to have.
  </li><li>Right.
 in the same way that your relationship with Christ can be influenced by you and not him.
 So can you're the amount of wholeheartedness that you have.
 Yes, I agree.
 Like you can move towards the Lord in your brokenness.
 But it's fascinating to me when the blind beggar is like, "Son of David, do not pass me by."
 And then the Lord stops us and says, "What do you want me to do for you?"
 Yeah.
 Like, "Duh, can you take a guess?"
 Yeah.
 "I want to dance."
 No, I want to be able to see.
 Yeah.
 Right. But the Lord invites him into the process. What do you need?
 Yeah. And I did not know that I could come to the Lord, especially with things I
 deep shame about. So when I think about like my sexual sin, I would never,
 historically, I never went to the Lord to talk about that, because I'm
 spending all my life keeping it covered and hidden. But I didn't know that I could
 just go and be with the Lord and walk in the light with him, or maybe walk in
 the light with another person. Right. Yeah.
 The prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective.
 You know, so you confess your sins one to another,
 this way you'll be healed.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I didn't know that I could willingly choose
 to get free from some of the stuff in my life
 by just going and humbling myself
 and confessing my sin to somebody else.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That by the way is inner healing.
 You're like, no, that's just New Testament Christianity.
 I know.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>They're like inner healing is just to collect the terms
 for stuff that's already in the Bible.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Didn't know that.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>Perfect.
  </li><li>Ready for number four?
  </li><li>I am.
 I did not know demons were real.
 I knew demons were real in the Bible,
 but did you, when you got saved?
  </li><li>Well, yeah, I mean, I used to have night terrors
 and things like that,
 and I used to have things that would move in my room.
 So I knew there was like demonic stuff going on.
  </li><li>No idea.
  </li><li>Yeah, you should grow up in Scotland,
 there's no demons there.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
  </li><li>So when I grew up in Scotland,
 when I went to church, I certainly believed
 that demons were real, 'cause the Bible said they were.
 But I think I relegated demons to Jesus' time
 and to far off countries.
 So maybe if demons were alive today,
 I mean, I wouldn't doubt it, but it's probably like only
 in deeply occult nations where missionaries are at work
 and maybe they have like a weird story to tell.
 But demons weren't real in our modern world, right?
  </li><li>Wow, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Didn't know that at all.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Narrowed down a bit more.
 I didn't know that demons could have flicked Christians.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>At all.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Right?
 And that was a misunderstanding on my part about like,
 well of course, you know, Christian can't be possessed
 by a demon because they're possessed by the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>What was Derek Prince's famous line about like,
  </li><li>Can a Christian have a demon?
  </li><li>Yeah, Dr. Prince, can a Christian have a demon?
 And he pauses, I suppose a Christian can have whatever
 he or she wishes to have.
 And I was like, because the devil is empowered
 by human agreement, Paul writes to Christians,
 "Do not give the devil a foothold."
 The Greek word for foothold there is tapas,
 from which we get our, you know, word topology,
 a spa, a place, a literal place.
 Don't give the devil a literal place in your life.
 It can also mean like a license.
 If I was gonna start a food stand in Franklin,
 I would need a license, a permission to operate.
 And so Paul is saying to Christians,
 don't give the devil a license or an opportunity
 to operate in your life.
  </li><li>I didn't know. - Which means you can.
  </li><li>Which means you can.
 I didn't know there was patterns of behavior
 that I would exhibit in my life
 that was literally opening the door for me
 to be oppressed by the demonic.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I had no grid for that.
  </li><li>Yes.
 story. It's a humorous story. And I hope that you understand the point of my story is to make fun
 of me and not my father. Okay. Okay. So my father and I, I mean, we both love the Lord deeply, but
 our expressions of faith were very, very different. Sure. My father was a staunch cessationist. Yes.
 So no belief in the supernatural here and now. So God doesn't speak. He certainly doesn't speak
 in dreams. There's no speaking tongues. There's no spiritual gifts. God could heal because he's
 God, but he doesn't tend to. I mean, we can pray for him to do it, but we can't expect
 the miraculous stuff that we saw in the book of Acts because that was just to get the church
 started.
 At least just for them.
 And now that the Canon of Scriptures closed, now that the New Testament church has been
 launched, it's just about perseverance, right? And so I remember one day after I had married
 you, we were talking, my dad was talking about, he was questioning me on my theology
 about healing.
 Yes.
 And like, you know, well, you know, at the time, some well-known prominent preacher,
 daughter was sick and he was like, well, this person's a faith healer. How can their daughter be sick?
 So I'm like, well, dad, I could give you 30 reasons why God wants to heal somebody and 30 reasons
 why people don't get healed. I said, I'll give you a simple example. Let's say,
 are you come to me and say, could you pray for me? I have a headache and I'm praying for your
 headache to be healed. But what I actually need to be praying is for a spirit of infirmity to leave
 you. I'm praying for the wrong thing. My dad was like, well, that's preposterous because
 because a Christian couldn't have a demon.
 And I was like, pick the worst example I possibly could.
 And that's how I would think.
 I didn't think that a Christian could afflict a demon.
  </li><li>A demon could afflict a Christian.
  </li><li>Well, both actually.
  </li><li>Well, a Christian can afflict a demon.
  </li><li>But I didn't think that a demon could afflict a Christian.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because partly I didn't believe they were real.
 And partly I didn't, I hadn't zero understanding
 of how the demonic works.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And that inner healing and deliverance go hand in hand.
  </li><li>Yes, they do.
  </li><li>Forget who wrote the book.
 It was either the Kiltras.
 I actually think the Sanford's re-released similar work.
 And they called it a comprehensive guide
 to Inner Healing Deliverance.
 I'll look up the book and I'll put a link in the show notes.
 It's fascinating showing how both of those go together
 that if you do deliverance only without Inner Healing,
 you're often your deliverance session
 is gonna take a long time.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you actually haven't helped the person
 because you haven't removed the top horse.
  </li><li>The stronghold that they can--
  </li><li>Yeah, they can just come back.
 with sevenfold and that person ends up in a worse place. Jesus taught about that. But to do
 inner healing only and not cast out the demon that was there is not effective. And so they go
 hand in hand. I didn't know anything about that. Oh, wow. Okay, good. All right. Love it. What's
 number five? Number five drum roll, please. All right, I'm ready.
 I didn't know how powerful simple words could be.
 What I mean by that is, if you think about deliverance, if I had to guess how deliverance worked,
 it probably looked like a lot of shouting and quoting scriptures and maybe just a big tug of
 war between you and the devil. Maybe you had to fast for 30 days.
 Well, I just have some people do it.
 But the same was like inner healing. If you think back, you were talking about,
 I didn't think that it was any healing for someone like me. Your journey to getting healed
 was probably mostly underwhelming for somebody looking on from the outside.
 What I mean by that is that probably the root of all inner healing is two simple things,
 repentance and forgiveness.
 Yeah, simple prayers.
 A little bit more than that.
 Now, it shouldn't surprise us that simple words are effective in the kingdom,
 given we get saved from a kingdom of darkness into a kingdom of eternal light by simple words.
 By simple words.
 Paul says, if you believe in your heart and you confess with your mouth, you will be saved.
 Yeah.
 There's no other name under heaven by which man may be saved.
 And so we get saved by confessing Jesus Christ as Lord.
 Yes.
 So getting into the kingdom was as simple as saying some words, advancing in the kingdom and being
 set free from demonic torment can be as simple as, I mean, we do this every year in our school,
 the very second week of our school.
 Like welcome to school of supernatural life.
 Is it so weak of inner healing and deliverance?
  </li><li>The third week, but yeah.
  </li><li>Is it the third week?
  </li><li>It is, yeah.
  </li><li>Well, it's the first week.
  </li><li>The first week is hearing God's voice.
 You teach it.
  </li><li>And second week.
  </li><li>Father, I heard of God, I teach it.
  </li><li>Third week.
  </li><li>Well, I'm so sorry that I just jumped.
  </li><li>You just were like, hey.
  </li><li>I knew it wasn't the first week.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But what we have to often coach people through
 is the ungodly belief is it's not working
 because it's not spectacular or dramatic.
 Because it's people just reading out a prayer out loud.
 Yeah.
 But it says in the scripture that Jesus is the high priest of our confession.
 Yeah.
 The, and then the not words have power.
 So much power.
 Like we are betrothed.
 We are in a lifelong covenant that is recognized around the world by earthly
 governments because we said two words.
 I do.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And I'm like, OK, so in our healing doesn't have to be exhausting, spectacular.
  </li><li>Yeah. - It is most often just activated
 by the confession of our mouth.
 I didn't know that.
 I thought it had to be like ninja stuff in the spirit.
  </li><li>Yeah. - So there's my five.
  </li><li>That's so good.
 I was trying to think of other two words that would be funny.
 Like when, 'cause I didn't know you were gonna say that.
 You handsome.
  </li><li>Excuse me.
 All right, I have a list of questions for you.
  </li><li>Okay, and then I'm gonna go buy guinea pigs.
  </li><li>You're fixated. - Okay.
  </li><li>All right, this is from Daniel.
  </li><li>Yeah, sorry Daniel.
  </li><li>Did it think? - Try and book it.
 Hello, Ellen and A.G.
  </li><li>Hi. - A few weeks ago,
 you talked about dreams.
 Do you remember that you in the fabulous Sarah Jackson
 were talking about dreams? - We did.
  </li><li>I grew up in a culture where dreams are said
 to have been ways God speaks to us in the biblical times,
 but not present day, so did I.
  </li><li>That's you. - Yeah, that was me.
 I have recently been praying that God
 would open up my mind to dreams from him.
 I have since then been writing all of my dreams down,
 but I'm not sure what to do with them.
 I was wondering how to distinguish dreams from God
 and dreams that don't really have much meaning.
 So this is a question from episode 261,
 that you and Sarah did about dreams.
 We're both dreamers.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How do you distinguish between dreams that are you
 and dreams that are God?
  </li><li>Well, so we're both dreamers.
 You're probably both doing this differently.
 I distinguish it by the residue of what I feel
 when I wake up or after I have it.
 Like I, when I know that a dream is from the Lord,
 I have a, like a, I feel the Holy Spirit resting on me.
 Even if it's a warning dream,
 I feel the Holy Spirit resting on that dream.
 And I'm like, okay, whatever this dream ends up meaning,
 I know that this was the Lord.
 And Sarah talked a little bit on that podcast about,
 you can also have dreams that are from your own heart.
 Like, so they're not,
 it's not that they're from a bad source.
 They're a dream that actually references the things
 that you're pondering, the things that are going on
 in your heart as well.
 But for me, I know it's a God dream
 by what's resting on me after I wake up.
 Does that help?
  </li><li>Well, it really helps.
 I think, I mean, I love your question, Daniel,
 because I had exactly the same question.
  </li><li>I love that your name's Daniel.
  </li><li>Yeah, I love that your name's taking your inheritance
 is to be one who dreams.
  </li><li>Dreams, yeah.
  </li><li>I'm a firm believer in Luke 11, 11, I wanna say.
 You know, when Jesus said, "Which of you fathers
 if your son asked for an egg, you give him a snake.
 Right.
 So is when you ask my father, egg snake,
 is it egg stone stone?
 It's one of those things you basically, which of you are
 asleep others?
 If your son asked for something good, you'd give him something bad.
 Yeah.
 So I just had to trust that God, when I asked that you're going to speak to me
 through dreams, that you will speak to me through dreams.
 Yes.
 So first of all, I love that you're doing that.
 Second thing I love that you're doing, Daniel, is that you're writing them down.
 When we write down our dreams, we are saying to God and we're saying to
 the spirit realm, I am willing to receive revelation from you, and willing to humble
 myself and choose to hear the way you speak, rather than demand that you speak to me the
 way I hear.
 Yes.
 And so I think if you keep doing those Hebrews 514 says is by constant use, the mature
 learn to distinguish good from evil.
 The more you do that, and the more you build up a repertoire of your dreams, you will find
 by reason of use, which ones are like the Lord speaking, which ones are the ones that
 are just, you know, pizza or whatever.
 for now, I would just encourage you to do what you're doing.
 And as you honor the Lord in that, I think you will find a language you will
 find perhaps what age is talking about, like a discernment about when is the
 Lord speaking.
 Yeah.
 Uh, I love that you're doing that.
 It's so humble.
 It's so childlike and the Lord will honor you in that.
 So I don't have a, I mean, what happened for me, Daniel, I'm almost too scared to
 tell you what happened for me, because I'm worried that if this doesn't
 happen to you, you're going to think it's not going to work for you.
 But I did the same thing.
 I just started asking God, would you speak to me?
 I was kind of skeptical.
 Or do you really speak in dreams?
 Like this kind of feels weird.
 And I did what you were doing.
 I just wrote down my dreams and here's why it's beautiful.
 I had one dream that I had a dream that I was in Brussels and I was leaving a train.
 And as I left the train, I walked up a flight of steps and some people at the top of the steps handed me a flyer.
 It was in French.
 I was trying to read it in the dream.
 I'm trying to remember my school by French.
 And as they come over to me, they asked, do you understand what you read?
 And I said, "No." And I said, "Can we pray for you?" And I said, "Yes." And I fall down on the floor.
 And I'm thinking, "That's got to be a God dream." Right? Because, you know, I fall down the floor in the Holy Spirit.
 And I remember, bright light, I remember waking up. I write it down the dream, think, I don't know what that means.
 I don't even know if I made that up. I don't even know if God's speaking.
 Forgot about it. Month later, I'm literally in Brussels. I'm on a day off. I take the train into the city.
 I get out of the train. I climb up a tall flight of steps from the train station to ground level.
 as I do, at the top there, somebody hands me a piece of paper.
 It's in French, I'm reading it, I don't understand what it says, somebody comes over to me and
 says, "Hey, do you understand what you're reading?"
 I said, "No."
 I said, "Oh, we're students, we're from a church in Brownsville, in Florida.
 Can we pray for you?"
 And I'm like, "Yes."
 And as they pray for me, I fall to the ground.
 As I'm on the ground, I'm like, "Oh my gosh, I had a dream about this month earlier."
 Yeah.
 And so I stand up, I have my journal with me, I open up the journal and I read them the
 dream. They're freaking out. I'm freaking out. And that I got my answer. Does God speak?
 Yes. He does. In Job 33 14, does God speak now one way, now another in a dream and a
 vision of the night? Yeah. Okay, God, you do. I would never have known that if I hadn't
 recorded dream, who knows if I would have forgotten the dream? Write them all down.
 Write them down. And you'll build up a language of God speaking to you in your dreams. But
 the most important thing, Daniel, is your demonstrating hunger and the Lord will reward
 you for that. Yes. Okay.
