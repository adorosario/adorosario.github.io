<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Episode 285 of Keeping Up With The Joneses, how are you today?
 I am good.<br/>
 You look beautiful.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 A comment if I may.<br/>
 Oh, no.<br/>
 It's the pause.<br/>
 It's the pause that's really concerning.
 I haven't checked the weather, but this week we've
 had temperatures that have exceeded 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
 Yes. And you're wearing a corduroy shirt.
 The third well corduroy shirt.<br/>
 Yes, I am, but I am.<br/>
 You're a freak of nature. I'm always cold in the house and it matches your shirt and
 that was a look you're going for. And I so badly need to do laundry that it was.
 The another two.<br/>
 The easiest.<br/>
 Yeah, it's laundry situation. It's chaos.
 It's chaos.<br/>
 It's chaos.
</p><ul>
  <li>We'll have more to say about that next week.
 Talking about weeks, give me a weekly catch up.
 How was this week?
  </li><li>It was full as usual.
 It just feels like the--
  </li><li>Do you even remember any of it?
  </li><li>I don't.
  </li><li>No, so when I--
  </li><li>I remember nothing.
  </li><li>I--
  </li><li>We had a friend.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Before we start recording,
 I have to put up my calendar to review it.
 And often I'm like, that was this week?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So for example, do you remember
 that it was Tia's birthday this week?
 No, I didn't.
 So our dollar was 13.
 That feels like two weeks ago.
 Yeah, poor sweet tea.
 She-- Tell them about it.
 Her birthday was on Sunday.
 Yep.
 I mean, you're six days ago.
 And mere six days ago.
 And she went away to camp the previous week.
 It came home with some sort of cold or something
 and then woke up on Sunday morning with a fever
 to go with her cold symptoms.
 So happy birthday.
 You get a COVID test.
 Happy birthday, yes.
 And then she had to stay home.
 So she didn't get to go to church, see her friends,
 on her birthday, we didn't go and celebrate.
 Normally we'd go out for dinner.
  </li><li>I'm gonna do a family dinner.
 At the cheesecake factory, didn't get to do that.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Except I just worked out what we're doing for dinner tonight.
  </li><li>You did?
 Is that what we're doing?
  </li><li>Well, we should.
 She didn't get to go to cheesecake.
  </li><li>But Abby's working.
 Abby won't be there.
 Eh, it's fine.
 Well, anyway, we can figure that out.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And then she was supposed to be helping at VBS all week,
 which she was super excited about, but she couldn't.
 'cause she sounded like she was a chain smoker,
 she was coughing so much.
 Eventually took her to the doctor.
  </li><li>Three COVID tests, two rapid, one PCR, all negative.
 And the doctor was really sweet, checked her lungs
 and gave her some steroids.
 We didn't really make her that hyper.
 Normally when they give me steroids, I'm hyper.
  </li><li>Well, you're, anyway.
 You're, yes, you are normally hyper if you get steroids.
 That is correct.
  </li><li>I love, like, so they give you the steroid in your butt
 and it burns, but then I feel like I'm on a rapid battery charger.
 Like I can feel it go.
 Yes, but they gave her slow release serum.
 So that's different.
 So I need slow release serum.
 That sounded like a drug addict.
 Yeah. Anyway, anyway, and some cough syrup, some like prescription
 to have her blood sound much better than she did, which is just as well.
 Cause she is going on a camp.
 And now she doesn't sound like she's about to die.
 Well, now I feel like a good parent that I'm sending my child off,
 not infectious to infect other children.
 And she does have energy, blessed this whole week.
 She was just pitiful, I felt so bad.
  </li><li>And we had to cancel her birthday party
 and then move it to yesterday.
  </li><li>Can we talk about temperature?
 It's a very British thing to do.
 But this week, our heat index reached 111 degrees, 105
 in the shade.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What's that?
 That's like 40 degrees centigrade for our non-American
 listeners.
  </li><li>It was horribly hot.
  </li><li>Hi, yeah.
  </li><li>It was hot.
  </li><li>It was hot.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But yes, so that was Tia's birthday,
 birthday to ya, 13 years old.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Super proud of her.
  </li><li>Yeah. - So brilliant.
  </li><li>And then your friend came.
  </li><li>That's right, I always love it
 when people from Scotland come.
  </li><li>That your friends with?
  </li><li>To America.
 Well, I just love any Scottish people coming to America.
  </li><li>Right, right. - But it's especially special
 when it's people I know.
  </li><li>Yes. - And so, Graham, hello.
 He reached out to me via Twitter and said,
 "Hey, I'm gonna be in Tennessee."
 I was like, "Oh, can we show you some hospitality?"
 He got to come and partially celebrate Tia's birthday.
 You know, I had to text him and go,
 "Okay, slight change of plans."
  </li><li>Yeah. - We've got a sick girl.
  </li><li>Yeah. - She does live at the end of the house.
 She did have a fever, it isn't COVID blah blah blah.
 But he was very brave too.
  </li><li>He rolled with a great, I mean, he has kids though too.
 So yeah, he wasn't thorough.
  </li><li>But the best thing is he brought a stash of chocolate.
 I don't want to say the best thing,
 but a really good thing. - It was lovely having you, Graham.
 But it was also great.
  </li><li>I got Percy pigs. - You did?
  </li><li>We got arrows. - Yeah.
  </li><li>We got Cadbury's, of course Cadbury's buttons.
 And then you got, do you want to wax lyrical
 about your thing? - Well, first of all,
 I've got minstrels, which is like my go-to, right?
  </li><li>I hitherto, your favorite chocolate.
  </li><li>Yes, until such time as the UK got on board
 with what I could previously only get in Australia,
 and now you can get Cadbury's Marvelous Creations.
  </li><li>Which is like a bunch of people who were stoned
 got charge of the Cadbury's recipe machine.
  </li><li>And just threw into the chocolate mix,
 Pop rockets, gummy bears.
 Pop rockets, pop rocks.
 Pop rocks.
 Things that like pop on your top.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Dummy bears.
 Like M&amp;M.
 Frunchee, M&amp;M.
 But like that kind of equivalent.
 It's like those bars that they make,
 the dairy milk bars that have like hazelnuts
 and raisins in it.
 Only it tastes way better
 and you're not having to like eat around
 hazelnuts and raisins.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 But with a whole lot of penny chews,
 which is what we'd call them a Scotland thrown in.
 Okay, yeah, you know what?
 It's glorious.
  </li><li>So we had a visitor, which I always love.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That was fun.
 I spoke at emanate Monday night.
 I taught on healing,
 and I didn't wanna teach on it.
 I really wanted to demonstrate healing
 and then get people active in healing.
 And I got a lot of revelation actually,
 which always feels like cheating,
 'cause I got it while I was falling asleep.
 But I was thinking about Jesus at the pool of Bethesda,
 when he heals that man has been sick for 38 years, isn't it?
 Remember?
 Yes.
 You remember when we went to the falls of Bethesda?
 Yeah, yeah, I remember the falls.
 And the Pharisees are ticked at Jesus, but Jesus kind of blame shifts.
 And it's basically like, I'm ad-libbing here, but it could be interpreted as,
 I'm just doing the work of my father.
 And actually goes one step further and says, the son can do nothing by himself.
 He can only do that, which he sees as Heavenly Father doing.
 And that's like, guys, that puts us in a good standing because you and I,
 we can't do anything.
 We cannot heal the sick,
 but what we can do is do what we see our heavenly father doing.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then I thought about,
 well, I didn't think about it.
 I saw it in a dream.
 That whole thing about our father who art in heaven,
 how do your name?
  </li><li>Listen, you cheat.
 You cheat because when you're getting ready
 to minister often, you have it.
  </li><li>How always?
  </li><li>Not always, often though.
 You have a dream where you see what you're speaking
 and then you just wake up and write it down.
 That's called cheating.
 Well, what?
  </li><li>Nothing, I do love when that happens.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I wish it would happen more, but I do love it.
 I love, you know what it feels like?
 It feels like lying down and then revelation falls on you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I do love it.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, it's cool, but cheating.
  </li><li>But anyway, we were talking about that
 and then we set people loose to pray for the sick,
 which was a lot of fun.
  </li><li>Yeah, and MJ had VBS this week.
  </li><li>Which he absolutely loved, Bravo,
 our Grace Kids staff and volunteers.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, this year,
 Sharon wrote all the material for it and everything.
 Like she just really wanted to pull something together
 that represented what the Lord had been speaking to her about
 for the kids and it was amazing.
 From the decorations to everything that they did,
 like they, MJ came home just so full of life
 and he wanted it to be longer.
 He's like, I wish it didn't end at noon.
  </li><li>I would ask him what was your favorite thing
 and he would just say everything.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Everything.
  </li><li>It was so good.
 So good.
 And then we had to postpone Tia's birthday party
 'cause she wasn't well.
 And so took a couple little friends to Nashville.
 Shores, yesterday.
  </li><li>For the main part.
  </li><li>Big water park.
 So we were there for about four hours yesterday
 in the heat and man was it hot.
 And I didn't actually go in the water
 'cause I needed to sit with all of our stuff.
 We had so much stuff and I just,
 it just feels like.
  </li><li>Did you just read a book?
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>Moved cigarettes.
  </li><li>Yes, moved cigarettes.
  </li><li>Moved cigarettes, you know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Classy.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was great.
  </li><li>We're recording this on a Saturday.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Tomorrow is a very special holiday
 in the United States called Juneteenth.
  </li><li>Yes, it's a new holiday.
  </li><li>It's a new holiday just signed into,
 I mean, it's been a holiday for years,
 but it's finally recognized as a national holiday
 signed in by President Biden last year, 2021.
 Are we 22?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 more June 19th. But the day this episode comes out is the day that we're observing at Grey
 Center in honor and celebration of the emancipation of slaves.
 Yes. So we're hoping that our fellow Americans are having a great vacation. Does everybody
 get off? I guess it's a national holiday. I think you have to, don't you?
 Absolutely. Our main topic for today is we actually have a special guest on the show.
 His name is Stephen James and he's with Sage Hill.
 You've probably heard us talk a lot about Sage Hill on and off through the podcast.
 They are a counseling agency, counseling service, a collective of counselors and therapists
 here in Nashville, Tennessee.
 Stephen is the co-founder or founder and CEO and a remarkable man in many ways.
 We met him through doing the Sage Hill training.
 Yes.
 halfway through the training, we realized that Seychael's values and Grace Center values in terms of
 having people live whole-hearted lives were very similar, but we approached them in two very different
 ways. And he was so gracious. Remember, he hosted a lunch for a lot of our pastors and our senior
 team to go be with him. And just so that we could fire questions at him, like, what about
 deliverance. Where does the demonic fit into this? What about the spiritual realms?
 And, you know, a fascinating conversation came out with that. And then when I went back and did
 Sage Hill training year two, I got to sit with him. He was leading that elective and just
 fascinating fellow, been trying to get on the podcast for a while. Very good friends,
 a great long history with a man called Chip Dodd that we had on a year ago, two years ago.
  </li><li>I think it was last year for me.
  </li><li>I put Lincoln and shut up the feelings doctor
 was that episode.
 And so I just got to ask him a lot of questions
 about things like trauma, things like hope,
 things like codependency, and got a far questions.
 I'm hope you enjoy the interview.
 Stephen James.
  </li><li>Hey.
  </li><li>I am so freaking excited to have you on our show.
  </li><li>Well, I'm a little nervous now.
  </li><li>I don't know how long I've waited for this.
 We had Chip on, I don't know, a year, half ago.
 And you can imagine what that would be like.
  </li><li>It's a lot.
  </li><li>Yeah, you do a lot of episodes with him.
 You know when people write resumes and they fake them?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You know, like, hey, I'm fluent in conversational French.
 And by that, I mean, I can ask where the bathroom is.
  </li><li>It took French too in college.
  </li><li>And what would you weekend like and that's it.
 I was thinking about you and how to introduce you
 to our audience.
 And it's gonna sound like I'm making up your resume.
 But it's true, like you are a founder, a CEO, an author,
 a podcaster, a father, a husband, a nature lover, an adventurer, a storyteller.
 Like, I'm curious how you manage to fit all that into your life so far.
 Badly.
 Just stuff it in.
 Just stuff it in.
 No boundaries.
 Man, that's yeah.
 Yeah.
 Tell the people who you are, what you do, how long you've been doing it.
 I've been being me.
 I'll start with that.
 Yeah.
 I started practicing being me 18 years ago.
 Wasn't, I've tried not to be me for a long time.
 And so around my 30th birthday,
 I ran out of energy to fake it anymore.
 Tell me what were you doing in your 30 years old.
 I was in seminary.
 You were in seminary.
 All right, so I was a student.
 I knew that professionally,
 I wanted to do something meaningful.
 I was working in a marketing and business development job
 at a religious publisher.
 I found it horribly soul sucking.
 Like it was not, I'm sure some people love that.
 For me, it was awful.
 I need to be working with people about people
 and the story of people with God.
 I didn't know what that was.
 And so the closest thing I could come to
 was I first started a PhD in higher administration.
 That took two classes in that.
 It hated that like administration and bureaucracy.
  </li><li>You get PhD in bureaucracy is not my foretelling, right?
 That was out of burn down in university,
 if I was present, right?
 So I quit that.
  </li><li>I can also tell how much you didn't know about yourself.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
  </li><li>So you thought, you know what would be a genius idea?
  </li><li>Yeah, I knew I wanted to lead and serve,
 and I knew there are certain institutional things
 in the world that create good, right?
 Universities, schools, churches, hospitals,
 like there's certain foundational things,
 and so I had an eye for those things.
 So I went from a PhD in education to a master's in divinity
 at a couple of different places.
 And they didn't like that very quickly realized
 I did not want to learn about the academics of divinity.
 That wasn't good.
 Some really heady schools.
 And then I was working with Chip Dodd
 on his book, Voice to the Heart.
  </li><li>But from a publishing site.
  </li><li>Just 1998, 1999.
  </li><li>Any of this.
  </li><li>Yes, that's a we, oh wow.
 I just assumed you've always been therapist,
 fond of voice,
  </li><li>Oh gosh, that's so feeling person.
  </li><li>I've always been full of something.
 (laughs)
 Just not myself or the spirit.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>So I was working at this publishing house,
 learning a lot, had been married a couple of years,
 was horribly depressed.
 I would go at lunch,
 I would leave my job and go to the cul-de-sac and journal,
 and just kinda like pray,
 and everything felt so wrong.
 I thought it was vocational and really it was all emotional, spiritual, psychological.
 Like I was so...
 Do you know anything?
 No.
 No.
 Any experience with therapy or...?
 Went to one therapist.
 My mother took me to see a therapist by Sister and I and I used a very choice language with
 the therapist and walked out.
 That was my only therapy experience.
 Wow.
 And so Heather and I went to pre-marriage counseling and we went to the kind of counseling
 we could afford.
 Say no more.
 Right.
 right? And all you needed.
 And we, the person was a hundred percent right in what they told us at the
 second session, but they told us with no art. And we felt so exposed in a
 shame that we fled from that in denial. And so those are my two counseling
 experiences, right? So after this, like thinking it was professional, I, you
 know, and then I met Chip Dodd in 1998. And he had this idea for the book, The
 voice of the heart. I wasn't called that at that time. I had the honor to work with him
 to develop the manuscript. He and I met every Thursday for about three hours. He first taught
 the whole thing on audio. I had a stack of papers. If you've ever encountered chip and
 you could imagine a recording chip for like three or four hours.
 I had that much transcribed.
 And then my job was to organize that into a manuscript and then to begin to
 edit and write the book.
 And so I would take what he said.
 I would kind of clean up the manuscript from what he said.
 And then he and I would sit with each chapter and I'm left-handed and he's
 right-handed and we would go over the manuscript line by line.
 And we did that for about a year, right?
 page by page.
  </li><li>What an education.
  </li><li>Well, here's what was really happening.
 Because he's so authentic and can't tolerate any
 inauthenticity.
 The first hour, hour and a half was a therapy session for me.
 I didn't know it.
  </li><li>Of course.
  </li><li>Right, but I was beginning to bump into myself
 and bump into my story and begin to face my own addiction,
 idolatry, shame, performance-based identity,
 abuse narratives, I mean, all the stuff that I had been,
 not trying to face and to survive.
 We start talking about the voice of the heart.
 I couldn't help begin to ask, "Qued,
 I'm a very curious, challenging person.
 Like I'm an integrand eight, so I'm gonna challenge him."
 He's gonna challenge me back.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you're both gonna love the brothel.
  </li><li>Yes, and we're both gonna end up crying at some point, right?
 And so he and I became very close,
 and I became very exposed and grew a ton in it.
 Like really grew.
 And I know I needed to make a change.
 there was a needed change vocationally that I needed to make.
 I wasn't being myself and I needed to pursue something that was more me.
 I narrowed that down to being a professional soccer coach or pursuing God's people in their story.
 That was the two options that I thought out was me.
 Well, when Chip finished the manuscript, I asked him, "Who do you want to endorse the book?"
 And he said, "I want, so funny." He goes, "I want C.S. Lewis,
 Billy Graham, and Dan Allender."
 (laughing)
 Or Franklin Graham and Dan Allender.
 And I said, "Well, pretty sure C.S. Lewis is dead."
 (laughing)
 Right, so yeah, but that's who I want to endorse the bus.
 Okay, he's dead, so, and I think we can get to Franklin Graham,
 and I don't know who Dan Allender is.
 And so this was, you know, it wasn't pre-internet,
 but this is where you still like,
 wrote letters and sent packets.
 So I wrote, I found this guy, Dan Allender in Seattle.
 He was the author of a book called The Wounded Heart.
 I sent a packet to Wounded Heart Ministries,
 and I got back several weeks later,
 I got back an endorsement saying,
 well, we asked him to write the forward.
 He said, "I'm not gonna write the forward,
 "but I appreciate the book so much.
 "I'm gonna write you a lengthy endorsement."
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And at the bottom, it said,
 "Dan Onder, president of Marshall Graduate School."
 And I was like, "Well, that's interesting,
 "Marsal Graduate School."
 And I had just quit the PhD program
 and a divinity program.
 So I turned on the internet and bee kind of thing.
 And this school showed up and it talked about
 tech, soul and culture.
 And this was at the beginning of kind of way beginning
 of postmodernism in the church
 and before became deconstruction
 it was kind of revitalizing theology
 and rethinking stuff.
 And because of this publishing house and my age,
 I got to be at the table with all the thought leaders
 in that world.
 So that was, I was already thinking about that and thinking about how to engage the world with the, with the true story and in culture it and wherever culture I'm in.
 And so I started reading this website, I started crying and I called Heather and I read it to her.
 And then she said, it sounds like we're going to graduate school, it sounds like we're moving to Seattle.
 And I said, I don't know.
 And then a year and a half later, there's a whole lot of story that goes with that about
 what God did and timing and provision and surrender.
 We moved to Seattle.
 I started at Marshall Graduate School in the Divinity program, Master's in Divinity
 program.
 At the end of the semester, my faculty supervisor came to me and said, "Hey, we've talked and
 we think you'd be better in the counseling program than the Divinity program."
 I said, what does that mean?
 And he goes, well, you would just switch programs.
 It's a two year program, not a three year program.
 I was like, well, Heather's gonna love this.
 Like she didn't wanna be here.
 So let's, I'll go home and tell her that.
 And she was a trained counselor from Vanderbilt
 University at that time.
 So and she'd worked at Daystar Counseling Ministries
 and ran a counseling program at St. Paul Christian Academy
 and all this stuff.
 So she was a counselor, right?
 So we go, I go home and I tell her, I say,
 "Hey, I'm gonna switch the counseling program."
 And she laughed because you a counselor,
 like you're not touchy feely,
 you're kind of a brops, you're a little bit rude,
 you cuss too much.
 I'm like, I know, but I get out in two years
 and you actually get paid to be a counselor.
 You don't get paid to be a divinity person.
 I didn't wanna work in a church.
 That was not, I wanted to work with God's people
 and their story.
 That was what I was called to do.
 And so I switched degrees, got a counseling degree,
 move back to Nashville.
 I thought you just started private practice.
 So I started a private practice.
 Chip worked out a deal in Murpiesboro.
 I was paying a guy like 40 bucks a month
 for an office in the back top behind something.
 And I took me about five years to provide for my family.
 While I was doing that, I ended up working for the school,
 working with Dan, became a really,
 became a really significant mentor in my life.
 I helped that school navigate a lot of change.
 And from Nashville.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was running a team out there from here
 and I would travel back and forth,
 which began to introduce me to the idea
 of how important leadership is
 and the sacredness of leadership
 and watching Dan navigate some of the changes
 he needed to make in his own life.
 And that was, that plants a seed later for me.
 And then I did private practice for several years.
 I went on staff at a church.
  </li><li>Just to help everybody.
 Private practice as in,
  </li><li>Yeah, it's just a therapist.
  </li><li>Careful, therapist, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's running private practice.
 At the same time, we had twins, I freaked out,
 we had four kids, four and under.
 I thought I needed health insurance,
 so I got a church that was a referral partner of mine,
 asked me to come on staff for a couple of years.
 I kept my private practice, which was really good,
 because me and big institutions don't,
 we don't go well together.
  </li><li>I'm very much a profit.
  </li><li>I'm a change agent.
 They happen to be going through a lot of change at that time,
 so it worked.
  </li><li>But you also caused change.
  </li><li>Yeah, I did.
 I'm an irritant.
 I'm a spiritual irritant,
  </li><li>Yeah, I'll accelerate.
  </li><li>To be kinder.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 It's my practice grew and I wrote some books
 and those did really well, surprisingly,
 and then I wrote some other books that did really badly,
 surprisingly.
 It's like a, like the debut album always does well.
 The next couple albums might really suck.
 And they suck.
 But then I, you know, just kind of grew and became
 and God favored me with a lot of influence
 and humility came through that.
 And so after being in private practice alone for a long time, I realized the need to build
 community around it.
 So I started with Chips Blessing.
 I started a company called SACIAL Counseling.
 The idea behind it is that if we can build a thriving, vibrant, verdant community that
 supports therapists, they can support clients better, that we're better together than we
 are alone.
 And so I've been leading that for the last nine years with help of other people along
 the way. And then most recently, after 20 years of being a therapist, I noticed signs
 and burnout in myself. And so I started a transition away from private practice. And
 I started another company called the Leadership Lab. And we work with leaders, entrepreneurs,
 professionals to be more wholehearted and fullhearted in what they do so they can lead with
 integrity, hope, faith, love, justice, both at home and at work, and really give them a
 platform to be themselves, take their armor off so they can then go back to their context
 and live out their story with just greater intention and meaningfulness and impact.
 So that's grown really well.
 It's taught me a lot of, I get to be around really bright, accomplished people who are
 still needy and vulnerable and deficient and lonely and hoping and thinking that the success
 that they got them was somehow going to save them from the human story and the struggle.
 I get to reintroduce them to that and how to do it well.
 So I've built a community here in Middle Tennessee that as it's a community of leaders and we
 meet regularly and encourage each other.
 I feel very much passionate and connected to my calling and professionally I've never
 been more satisfied.
 It's like how did I get here?
 started with me stopping running from myself and beginning to accept my gifts and my limitations
 and my need andness of other people, continuing to let myself let go of what I thought I had
 to be or should be so that I could become more of who God made me to be.
 And that's a daily practice, right?
 I was telling someone this morning, I've got an email during a meeting and I was like,
 "Oh, I need to quit doing that."
 Like I clearly suck at that.
 So I'm going to stop doing that now too.
 There's some things I'm continuing letting go of as a spiritual discipline so that I could be more of me
 Have more to give and more to receive and I mean, I'm not sure what you asked me, but that's a great introduction
 My experience of you Stephen our lives of intersected
 I was trying to find the first email I ever received from you. I don't know if you're aware of this
 I'm not years and years ago probably maybe a year after I moved here, so we're going back
 2009-2010. Yeah, we have a mutual friend. We have lots of mutual friends, but Todd
 Prevoast. Oh, yeah, so I'm having yes. I'm having coffee with Todd. Yes years ago, and I can't remember
 I just taught something at church Todd had listened to it Todd really latched on to something I'd said and he began talking
 About you and his feelings chart and I was like, oh, that's so exciting like, you know
 And I had, didn't have any revelation of the voice of the whore
 or your feelings chart, but had something along the lines.
 But he tried to connect us.
 I don't know if you remember that,
 but you wouldn't remember it was me being tried to connect us.
  </li><li>I remember, well, I remember this moment in Todd's life.
 And so I know what you're talking about.
 And so, and I forgot you were you.
 (laughing)
 You know, I don't know who Stephen Jay was.
 Just a Todd, I like Todd and Todd's like,
 I think you'd really like this guy,
 you two are very similar.
  </li><li>Todd is a connector.
  </li><li>Plus you get connected, never word out.
 But then I remembered when the, you know, the kind of the weave of you in and out of my life is when my parents died, I reached out to Todd because I knew Todd knew lots of.
 And I was like, who do you recommend? He gave me your name. I emailed you. You're like, I'm too busy. But here's some people that recommend ended up going to see Will who was a Sage Hill at the time.
 And then Meddane and then did the Sage Hill training. So are.
  </li><li>I love Zichl's right.
  </li><li>I'm connecting.
 And people who have listened to the podcast for a long time
 will know they'll have heard of you,
 they'll have heard of all the feelings
 where it voice the heart, say it to you.
  </li><li>As I, there's a version of me that people have heard of.
  </li><li>I'm sure.
  </li><li>He precedes me.
  </li><li>Well, just even hearing that story.
  </li><li>And he ain't me.
 I'm funny, I've just assumed that, you know,
 out with a womb, you've always been a therapist.
  </li><li>So I was my mother's therapist out of the way.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>We have to hold other episodes.
 Shire to be my father's therapist, he didn't want that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 My emotional spiritual DNA is made with a sensitivity
 to the story of people and the sensitivity
 to the story God's telling.
 Like I've, as a child, my father worked for Sony and then RCA.
 We had every electronic device and TV and VCR
 that was available in, which means I had access to stories.
  </li><li>Wow.
 So we had movies and I watched movies
 and I would watch multiple movies.
 And for me, it wasn't about,
 even at that age, it was about like
 something's going on here, what's going on, right?
 I was thinking at it and feeling the narrative.
 And that was being tutored in me very early, right?
 Like that's just a part of who I am.
 And I really do love people.
 Like I love people.
 I care about people, sometimes without boundary
 and I've learned to have boundaries about myself
 with people, but so it's story and care and love.
 And man, that's been who I've been out of the womb,
 learning how to be more than just by performance
 in those things and learning how to be me as me
 and offer me and receive in myself has been a, you know,
 1998 to 2022 journey.
 There's lots of iterations of that,
 but there's a professional public version of me
 that I hear about a lot.
 You know?
 It's like I have to come from somewhere.
 It does come from somewhere.
 Well, you know, it's not fiction.
 We did this conversation at a training I had at St. Chil,
 a few months ago, and my question was,
 before you enter the room, what precedes you?
 And we were like, well, so me,
 like you know I'm coming in the room, what's preceding me?
 like, oh gosh, there's gonna be noise, there's gonna be shame,
 there's gonna be fear, there's gonna be play,
 there's gonna be, it's like we all know it's coming.
 It's like, uh-huh.
 And we went around the room and like,
 we all have a version of ourselves that's proceeding us.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Right, that's a part of us.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>But it's not the whole part of us.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>You know, and as a challenger, an instigator, initiator,
 it surprises a lot of people that I'm as tender as I am.
  </li><li>That would be my experience.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>In the times that we've had offline conversations,
 maybe between sessions,
 I'll be shocked by some of the stuff you say.
 Like never in a million years would cross my mind.
 I remember one day you were saying,
 I get really angry when people leave me.
  </li><li>Oh God. - And I was like,
 my gosh, I thought you would be so indifferent.
  </li><li>Oh no. - That was my, you know.
 I wrote this about you.
 Like as an introduction, just thinking about
 where we're gonna go.
  </li><li>You didn't tell me this could be a therapy session.
  </li><li>Well, you know, we could go in so many different directions.
 But what I wanna let you know is,
 let me read this 'cause I liked what I wrote.
 I said this, I know you to be a generous man.
 A brilliant thinker and someone who tells the truth
 and is fiercely curious,
 even when those things may get you into trouble.
 That would be my experience of you.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>In every interaction of it,
 the astonishing generosity that you've shown me,
 our church, our staff,
 I mean, I think honor, we're honored to do.
 I don't think we would have got through COVID.
 We would have got through the transition we've been
 in without all the stuff that you've given us,
 the stuff that you know you've given us through training,
 but also the stuff that you don't.
 And here's some of the stuff that you don't.
  </li><li>Oh God. - Here's what I've done is,
 I have, you know, I mentioned,
 I've sat in classroom environments with you,
 I've sat in small group environments with you,
 we've had one-on-one conversations.
 One of the things that angers me most about you,
 and you catch this every time,
 is your throwaway one-line statement.
 You're not trying to be pithy or witty or,
 you just, in the course of conversation,
 you'll say something, you're on the next thing,
 and I'm angry because I'm running after you,
 picking up that thing, but like this thing is like,
 you know, it's got like a megaton of revelation,
 unpack it, and you're on to the next thing.
 Because I've got you locked in my basement,
 I collected them in a file.
  </li><li>Oh my God.
  </li><li>And so now what I'm gonna do, if you're okay with this,
 asking for consent, is I wanna read them back to you.
 These are just little one liners.
 And ask if you can unpack them, give some context,
 where they come from.
  </li><li>Oh, love them, this is so fun.
 Well, thank you for listening.
  </li><li>Thank you for listening.
  </li><li>I've saved them.
 So here we go.
 You, again, I can't tell you the speed
 with which these would be thrown out,
 often in the context of, I don't know, Q and A
 with an audience, and somebody would ask you a question,
 and on your way to answering the question,
 you'd throw this out, and I'd be like,
 "Buh, bu, bu, bu, bu, back up!"
 (laughing)
 Okay, so here we go.
 Whatever causes you to hate your hope
 is what you need to grieve.
  </li><li>Yeah, 1000%.
  </li><li>You can't just say yeah, you have to explain that.
  </li><li>I thought you were gonna read the list.
  </li><li>Nope, that's the first one.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Whatever causes you to hate your hope
 is what you need to grieve.
 Talk about that.
  </li><li>Hope is the most painful.
 Next to love, which is the most powerful thing in the world.
 Hope is the most painful thing we'll ever experience.
 Love is deeply painful.
 Hope is this insatiable energy
 and lean forward, leaning into the possibility
 that at any given moment, everything's gonna be okay.
 Everything's gonna get better.
 And we are made with that in us.
 We as Western modern thinkers, our vocabulary has turned
 the word hope into like wishing, right?
 And hope isn't a wish.
 Hope is a part of our energetic, psychic, psychological,
 emotional, spiritual self that can't help but lean
 into the idea, the reality, the possibility
 that everything is gonna be made well in just a second.
 My hope is fashioned by where my hope has been deferred.
 And hope deferred makes the heart sick
 and the longing for fill is the tree of life.
 So where I have had to defer my hope,
 where I've been aware of my desire
 for everything to be made whole and it hasn't.
 That's gonna break my heart.
 and that's gonna break my heart over and over and over again.
 And our hearts are made to be broken and made to be mended
 and made to be broken and made to be mended.
 And so hope is the wellspring of life.
 Like it brings us so much possibility and so much trouble.
 And so we tried to defer it
 because we cognitively know that it's not gonna happen
 but we emotionally and spiritually know
 we're made for it to happen
 and we know it one day will happen.
 and we're living in that tension all the time, right?
 And so specifically for me,
 the things I hope for are places I'm sensitive to
 and you were sensitive to and everybody listening
 and based on your own story,
 where you hope the most is where your heart's been broken
 the most and where you need to grieve the most.
  </li><li>Can I ask you a question for that?
 I don't want to interrupt you and flow to heart.
 I think you're okay with being here.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah, please, enter it.
 I mean, again, it's like a fractal.
 There's like a thousand things coming off that question.
 Are we aware that we're like, I hear what you're saying, hey, we're built to do this.
 Are we aware that we're doing that?
 Are we more conscious with the ways that we're trying to stay away from our hope?
 So I agree, we're all built to hope.
 And yeah, I know in my own story, I know in the lives of the people I work with, I am
 more cognitively aware of me hating that hope and killing and pushing away and not being
 present with it.
 Because it means pain, right?
 Yeah.
 That's still going on under the surface.
 Yeah, you can be mad at that, but that's still going.
 One of the signs that's still going,
 even though we hate it,
 we're trying to dead in our heart to hope.
  </li><li>Man, that's a tough question.
 That's a good question because it's causing me to think,
 which thank you.
 We can't not be aware of it.
 Like it is, it's like, are you aware that you're breathing?
 No.
 And then sometimes you are, right?
 You're always breathing.
 You're always hoping.
 It's so much a part of us that it's just who we are.
 You're always blinking, your heart's always beating, right?
 You can practice being aware that your heart is beating
 and you can, even with real deep meditation,
 but you can change the rhythm of your heart
 and you can slow it down and you can speed it up.
 You can practice your eyes, I'm aware my eyes are blinking.
 I can try not to blink and I'm still gonna blink.
 Hope is more like that than it is like an idea
 or like a feeling.
 It's so much a part of us.
  </li><li>Okay, that's super helpful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 One of the downfalls that we've experienced
 out of the 20th century and the psychological movements
 of the 20th century is the idea that if we understand ourselves
 and we do it different,
 there's a way that we can be healthy,
 I hate the word healthy,
 quit using the word healthy everybody,
 I can be healthy or I can not be dysfunctional
 or I can not have to struggle
 or I can not have to be depressed or be anxious
 or like have feelings.
 Have feelings, right?
 And feelings are so like rudimentary.
 You know, like hope would be like trigonometry, calculus.
 Feelings are like one plus one equals two, right?
 And we're doing those all the time too,
 but hope is, there's a part of us like on a,
 I don't know this, I believe this.
 This isn't, I don't, I mean, I don't know if this is proven
 or not, but it's proven to me.
 Our like DNA molecular, like there's, we are,
 this is so weird.
 We are more nothing than something.
 I went from a molecular level, like there's more space
 in us atomically than there is actual substance.
 And you get down to the atomic level,
 but something's filling in those gaps
 that's not measurable in the temporal world, right?
 And we call that in the church, we call it spirit, you know?
 I think another word or another face of spirit would be hope.
 It is the thing that binds us.
 It is the thing that moves us and it is us
 and it is a part of the image of God that we carry
 and live out in the world.
 Whether we want to or not, like we can choose not to be,
 that you can't not hope unless,
 I mean, that's what a lot of suicide ultimately is,
 is a desperate attempt to extinguish hope
 because hope is so painful.
 And so I can't stop hoping and it keeps nothing keeps changing.
 And yeah, and especially adult, adult suicide, adolescent suicide
 is a different thing, but a lot of adults suicide is the attempt
 to extinguish the hope because hope is so exposing of our
 parallelistness.
  </li><li>And the grief then, whatever you cause you to hate your hope
 is the thing you need to grieve.
 Talk to me about the grief, how does grief fit in with hope?
  </li><li>Well, I love team.
 I love, I'm my best when I'm coming alongside great people
 and helping them be great.
 Like that is my best.
 I'm not my best when I am trying to make myself great.
 Some people are, some people are like,
 made to hit home runs.
 I'm made to help you hit home runs.
 And I love that about me,
 'cause I get to like enjoy that with you.
 That comes from someplace in me, right?
 That comes from a family rot with addiction and trauma.
 That comes with a lot of loneliness.
 that comes with a lot of like a places in me
 that were undeveloped, un-nurtured, un-secure,
 that touched kind of who I am
 and I started making a version of myself
 that would try to make up for that stuff.
 So I hope for the depth and relationship
 and connectedness that is so secure.
 The problem is I'm like relationally malformed,
 I'm really bad at attachment.
 Right. So I have to continually grieve my lack of attachment skill,
 my lack of attachment structure so that I can like lean into what I can have
 and enjoy what I can enjoy.
 But then the minute I start to enjoy it, I have to recognize that like,
 oh, this is what I've been missing. Right.
 So joy and grief, like go hand in hand, you know?
 And so I, my hope exposes in me what I need to grieve.
 And then grief leaves to acceptance and acceptance leads to fulfillment and
 and all this stuff, right?
 And we try to disconnect it and we wanna solve the problem.
 We call it the problem pain.
 Praying's not the problem.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know?
  </li><li>So we try to alleviate the problem of being human
 with hope-filled hearts by being realistic,
 by being measured.
  </li><li>That's one way.
  </li><li>By being managed, controlling other people.
  </li><li>And being stoned.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's another way.
  </li><li>Opting it was real.
  </li><li>The list of what humans can do to avoid being human,
 like we can make a list like as long as all
 of the arms of the world.
  </li><li>It's funny you should say this.
 (laughing)
 'Cause the next thing that I have is stress
 is an inability to hop out loud.
 These are all things you've said.
  </li><li>Oh.
 (laughing)
 Stress is an inability to hop out loud.
 Unpack that.
  </li><li>So sometimes I say things,
 and I'm not sure what I'm saying,
 but I believe they're true.
 It's like, "Oh, that sounds good, that's true."
 I've written things, I'll go back and read my own books
 and go, "Man, who wrote that?
 "That's really good."
  </li><li>I'm pretty sure I know that.
 when the audience is like, say that again, you're like,
 what did I, I'm always fear.
 That's the Holy Spirit.
 Oh, in the flow.
 What did I say?
 You said stress is an inability to hop out loud.
 Yeah, so my hope is not made to be held within.
 It's made to be expressed and shared, right?
 And so when I share my hope, you're gonna share your hope,
 and now there's something happening in the world,
 the energy of that.
 And when I am in distress, right,
 or fear that my, that what I'm hoping for
 not going to come true, right? I'm going to hold that in and that's going to cause a dissonance
 in myself. It's going to cause a friction, right? And that stress, right? It's like,
 I'm not living in congruence. Stress isn't bad. I encourage everybody is listening and
 watching to us. It's easy to hear some things I talk about in a dualistic, right? Good,
 bad. There is evil and love. Those are true things. Not everything that's good is love
 and not everything that's bad as evil, right?
 And we love to make everything dichotomous.
  </li><li>Now you have to write new things though.
  </li><li>I know, so when I am in distress,
 or I am in incongruence, or I have a sense
 that the world is not gonna be the way I wished it to be,
 and want it to be, like gosh, I need to be expressing that.
  </li><li>And if I keep it inside?
  </li><li>It's (imitates
 (imitates
)
  </li><li>It's not made to be inside, it's made to go,
 it's made to expand.
  </li><li>Beautiful. - Yeah.
 Addiction is an intolerance to vulnerability.
  </li><li>That's a direct quote from Chip Dodd,
 give him credit.
  </li><li>All right, I heard you say it, but the Chip, thank you.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's what it is.
 That's in the book, "Hope and the Age of Addiction."
 We write a lot about that.
 But we are made as emotional spiritual creatures.
 We are all very sensitive.
 Life bothers us.
 It's made to bother us.
 We're made to be bothered by it.
 That's not a design flaw, that's a feature.
 It's wonderful.
 pleased to empathy and compassion.
 It hurts so much to live and I get tired of it,
 especially if I grew up in a place
 for about hurting wasn't met by the benevolent care
 of another with power, an adult,
 to the degree that in every family it's not,
 the more it's not, the more intolerant
 I become my own feelings,
 'cause the adult can't hold my feelings,
 they're intolerant of my feelings,
 so I'm intolerant of my, I'm becoming tolerant of my feelings
 as I get older.
 I don't have the skills to manage my own self.
 So I have to look for something
 that's gonna manage my feelings for me.
 And so I'd turn to something and I find something.
 And whatever that thing is, I find that takes my shame
 and my fear, fear of abandonment
 and the shame of being needy,
 whatever resolves that, my brain and my heart say yes to it.
 And it's like, oh, that's good.
 I'm made to feel like this way.
 And then I start unconsciously looking for that.
 And those are good things.
 We only do good, find good things to do that with.
 Only good will satisfy the heart.
 But then we start looking for ways to satiate the heart
 and not be satisfied.
 We wanna be satiated.
 We want to not feel this way.
 So we unconsciously start looking and looking and looking.
 We find them.
 And then on an unconscious brain level,
 we start using those things to process those
 and substances to not have to feel,
 to not be vulnerable to our own experience.
 And sooner or later, that is such an automatic process
 that it owns us and we become possessed by this thing.
 And that's addiction, right?
 That's a slight enslavement.
 That is a normal human process.
 But everybody's an addict, everybody's an idolater.
 And it's our admission of that
 that actually leads us to greater freedom
 and greater humility and surrender
 and more power in the spirit and all those things.
  </li><li>The hypothesis is so freaking expensive.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yeah, it costs us a lot of ego
 and a lot of self-sufficiency.
  </li><li>It's agonizing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's the crucible for silver, the furnace for gold,
 but the Lord tests the heart.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>It's, you know, it, like, oh.
 And we'll talk about that in a bit.
 That's beautiful.
 What a great, what a great explanation you wordsmith.
 The inability to make meaning from your story
 leads to trauma.
  </li><li>Okay, so anybody that has been reading
 or listening to anything psychological
 the last 15 years is gonna have a problem with what I say.
 (laughing)
 Right now, so this is where I lose friends and fans right now.
 But I want to have my whole thought heard.
  </li><li>Sure, okay.
  </li><li>Trauma's normative.
  </li><li>We're living in a fallen world.
  </li><li>It cannot be avoided and it must be dealt with.
 And we live with a lust to try to create a world where trauma can be not had.
 Okay.
 This is the psychological, clinical, accepted definition of trauma.
 About to give you what it really is, not what we think it is or what it feels
 like.
 This is what it is.
 It's the inability to make meaning of an event.
 That's what trauma is.
 When something happens to me, or I experience something that overwhelms my
 senses, emotional, physical, spiritual, everything in me, like can't hold that.
 And it over does my senses, all senses.
 It doesn't make sense to me.
 And so I don't have a category or a way to, this isn't cognitive.
 This is like deeper than cognitive.
 This is emotional, spiritual, psychological that can be invaded by something.
 I can be exposed to something.
 I can be, I can have something to be taken away from me or lost.
 and I don't have a way to hold or make sense of that, right?
 And that's called trauma.
 I can't make meaning of this event.
 And as humans, we're meaning making creatures.
 We're always writing a story.
 What's so weird to me is that all and trauma
 are like hairs width apart.
 'Cause all is like, I can't, I don't have words.
 And trauma is, I don't have meaning.
 And the difference is with awe, it's meaningful.
 And trauma is meaningless, right?
 And my work, my responsibility as a human being
 and my responsibility with other human beings
 is to make meaning of the things that are meaningless to me.
 We're meaning making creatures.
 And I need help and practice in making meaning of things
 as things happen to me, as I'm being undone
 over and over again in my life.
 You know, and as a parent, some of the most undoing things have happened not to me.
 They've happened to my kids that have no control over, right?
 It leaves me terrified and unsure.
 And I thought the world and God was one way and it's not.
 And how do I make sense of this?
 And there's not an easy answer.
 There's lots of complex answers and lots of feelings and lots of needs and desires
 and longing and hope that happened in that.
 And so those of us who've experienced trauma, which is every human being that
 has ever lived.
 Birth is traumatic.
 We wouldn't call birth bad.
 Birth is a traumatic experience.
 A child goes from like perfect connection,
 floating, warmth, like everything I need is right there.
 I mean, I have to be hungry
 'cause it just fed me, like it stimulated just enough
 to, right, and it's a life or death experience.
 Like it's a very dangerous passage.
 So our initiation into life is trauma.
  </li><li>So trauma experts right now are agreeing with me
 and they're having trouble with me
 because there's a lust to eradicate this
 as opposed to do what I think is a more durable approach
 is how do we help people make it meaningful?
 How do we normalize it and not criminalize the idea of trauma
 and they go, yeah, when it happens, here's what you do.
 Not how do you avoid it?
 'Cause it's gonna happen.
 And so, you know, depending on what it is,
 like how do you deal with it?
 And so when the rug comes out from under you,
 the good news is you will land.
 It hurts, but like the rug's gonna be pulled out sadly
 at different times.
 You can't predict when it's gonna happen
 and it's not always somebody's fault,
 but often is, but not always.
 And you hit the bottom and the work we get to do
 as humans then is what's the meaning that we get to have.
 And what's curious about that process is,
 I heard you say, you know, people have a problem with that,
 is meaning has already been prescribed.
 You know, we've been with enough people,
 we've done our own work about our own trauma.
 We had meaning about what that trauma meant.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And part of the healthy work.
  </li><li>I told myself a story about that.
  </li><li>Absolutely, is having that story interrupted
 and considering another one.
  </li><li>That opens up the possibility for something
 other than what I expect.
 So again, so if I've experienced trauma
 and I make meaning that like,
 well that happened because I'm a bad person
 or that happened because all men are bad
 or because these people aren't trustworthy or,
 you know, and now I've made a story,
 I've made it meaningful, right?
 And then if I open myself up to a different narrative,
 guess what could happen again?
 Something else is gonna happen, right?
 And so we try to live a small story,
 we're made to live a big story, you know?
 One of the only freedoms we have
 is to determine our attitude in any given situation.
 That's one of the greatest human freedoms.
 That doesn't mean I get to choose to be happy.
 That's not what it means.
 It's not like, just be happy.
 It means that in any given situation,
 I get to make it meaningful.
 Like I get to determine my response to this.
 Is it going to be hope?
 Is it going to be grief?
 Is it gonna be, I don't want trauma.
 I'm not looking for it.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's an escape of it.
  </li><li>And yet there's gonna be a moment in my life coming
 that I don't know what's happening.
 It's not, and I'm gonna have to unlearn the narrative
 I'm living in so I can have a bigger story.
 and I need help with that.
  </li><li>So beautiful.
 We get stuck in life when we refuse how we're made.
  </li><li>Yes.
 (laughing)
 I agree.
 Next question, the statement.
 That's good.
 Yeah, we do get stuck in life when we refuse how we're made.
  </li><li>So my observation is most people would not agree
 with that statement say, we get stuck in life
 when people are jerks and my boss this
 and the government that,
 and we move outside of ourselves to just blame shift
 without even considering.
  </li><li>Yeah, who am I in it?
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Unpack that, which we're probably gonna do
 before I interrupt with that.
  </li><li>No, no, no, I appreciate the time you gave me
 to think that what I wanna say.
 We get stuck in life when you resist how we're made,
 we refuse how we're made.
 I'm made to live.
 You're made to live.
 We're made to live fully.
 Living fully gets me into trouble.
 It gets me out over my skis.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Right?
 When I'm over my skis, I get too much momentum.
 And I like, ah, I wanna stop, it's scary.
 and I can't stop and then I fall down and I get hurt.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>That's wonderful.
 Or I think I've gotta be more than I am.
 I have to over function and I won't just stay in my lane.
 I've gotta worry about everything.
 I confuse worrying about people with loving people, right?
 Or I confuse being in control with being responsible, right?
 So I will over function.
 Or, right, I'll under function.
 I'll pull back, get really small.
 Like I don't wanna interrupt anything.
 you know, excuse me.
 I'm sorry, you know, before we start recording,
 I just came back from Ireland and Scotland,
 and everybody's apologizing for everything in Scotland.
 So sorry.
 Can you move, please?
 Like, why are you apologizing for me being in your way?
 Like, it was so polite.
 It was so polite.
 Horrifying.
 So sorry.
  </li><li>What I grew up with.
  </li><li>So sorry.
  </li><li>To me, long time to escape.
  </li><li>Yeah, and, you know, no one wants to be in the way, right?
 And I wish some Americans, I wish we were less willing
 to be in the way sometimes.
 We're very good at being in the way
 as an American culture.
 But either make myself over function
 or make myself under function
 so that I don't have to just be me
 'cause being me leads me to neediness, dependence,
 asking for help, stepping into affirmation.
 You know, I have to continually practice saying,
 when someone gives me a compliment saying, thank you.
 I don't wanna say thank you.
 I wanna say, let me explain.
 Right?
 Because in my story, if you delight in me, there's going to be a string attached.
 And I have like, that's not always true, Stephen.
 Right.
 But in some places that I came from, that was so true.
 People use words to get what they needed from you.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 They would use affirmation, joy, delight, care to get me to give them something I wasn't
 made to give them.
 Wow.
 Right?
 Yeah.
 to another person's delight in me is a lifelong work for me.
 And that's me being me. I made them into God. I made to be delighted in.
 I made to be enjoyed. I made to be celebrated. And so are you.
 And so is everybody. But for me, because delight is often, it cost me something.
 I'm always thinking about how am I about to be used? How am I about to be used?
 That's not me and me living with a guard up.
 I'm so much better than I used to be.
 And out of that has come generosity.
 It means the world to me that you recognize me as a generous person.
 Over the last probably six, seven years, another thing I've seen emerge as I've lived a less
 guarded life and a less defensive life is kindness.
 Like I so appreciate kindness and I'm so much more gentle than I've ever been.
 I'm just like, oh, that's so wonderful.
 but that's come out of my actually ability
 to receive love and gentleness.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, it's like, that's weird.
 Like the more I'm open to just being me
 and being delighted in and receiving kindness,
 the more kindness comes out of me.
 Huh, oh, okay.
  </li><li>And that plays right into the refusing how we're made.
 Like you were surprised that when you do these things,
 this fruit comes.
  </li><li>Yeah, you know, we're fearfully and wonderfully made.
 we are made in the image of the most beautiful thing ever.
 Right.
 Like we're just a hair off that.
 I mean, humans are incredible,
 not because of what we've done or who we are,
 but because what's been done for us and who's we are.
 We get to reflect that.
 We get to stand in that.
 So anytime I am not standing in that,
 I'm not reflecting that,
 I'm refusing the dignity of God.
 Like I'm rebellious.
 and you rob everybody else is a greatness God put in you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>This is one of my favorite ones.
 Codependency is living with an external focus
 to do or say whatever I have to do or say to not be abandoned.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, in one sense, it's self-explanatory,
 but unpack that a little bit more.
  </li><li>Yeah, codependency is another way of saying
 is an over-functioning of empathy.
 It's a hyper-impathy, right?
 And you define empathy.
 Empathy is the ability to build an accurate map
 of another person's insides.
 That's what empathy is.
 It doesn't mean you actually care.
 It means I can read you as a human being accurately enough
 based on my own human experience to go,
 I kinda know who you are.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I kinda see how you're like me,
 you're like other humans.
  </li><li>I'm glad you said that because that description
 sounds like it was care for them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But it's really narcissistic, it's care for you.
  </li><li>It's just, it's not narcissistic yet.
  </li><li>Oh, it's not?
  </li><li>It's just how we're made to read each other.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Okay, are you, are you like human?
 Like, are you are like a human?
 "Oh, you must hurt too, I must hurt."
 I can recognize you're hurting.
  </li><li>But in the context of cool dependence.
  </li><li>So now here's where this goes.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So then I learned that if I do something for you,
 you like me, or if I say, "My shirt, you think well of me,
 you drop something, I pick it up and give it to you,"
 or I better that I anticipate your needs
 and meet them before you even know you have them.
  </li><li>Right, you must really appreciate me,
 you must really need me.
 So now my identity becomes in reading the outside world
 to anticipate what other people need
 so that they'll think well of me.
 Then it comes to the place where I'm not okay
 unless you're okay.
 So then I live with the narcissistic demand
 that you be okay and it's my job to fix it.
 My job to do it.
 That's the extreme.
  </li><li>That's a sliding scale.
  </li><li>Yeah, yes.
  </li><li>From health and kindness,
 just being a decent person.
  </li><li>Yeah, being aware.
  </li><li>All the way to being,
 and we ends up turning around to being,
 like it comes out of a sense of like,
 oh, I see you're like me.
 And then it goes to using that to earn love
 and earn appreciation and learn acceptance
 and perform for my worth.
 And that ends up, when it turns to relationship,
 that ends up being co-dependency.
 I am dependent on your need of me for me to be okay.
 I'm hearing a story recently of a guy
 that was on a trip with another guy
 and he was putting a tin up.
 And this guy came over to him and said,
 "Hey, let me help you with your tent."
 He's like, "I got it."
 And the guy said, "No, no, I'm gonna help you."
 And he goes, "I actually want to,
 I really need to do this by myself.
 Like there's something going on for me,
 and I just wanna put this tent together with my kid,
 and it's kind of our thing right now."
 The guy said, "I'm gonna help you."
 And he goes, "Hey man, like, no."
 It's like this guy's, this other guy's codependency.
 Like, and it got really weird after that.
 doesn't know what to do not being needed.
  </li><li>Yeah, not being able to offer help.
 And the trip he was on,
 he was on the trip with a bunch of healthy guys
 who knew how to ask for help when they needed it
 and knew how not to ask for help.
 And this said this one guy didn't know what to do
 because no one's, and there were some outfitters around
 that were taking care of all the needs.
 So you were just there to receive and enjoy.
 And this one guy is identity is being useful and helpful.
 He literally went kind of nuts.
  </li><li>Oh, I bet.
  </li><li>And poor guy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, so that's like,
 that's an addiction to people pleasing,
 or an addiction.
 We're all made to please other people.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like people pleasing in and of itself isn't bad.
 We're made to bring delight to the face of another.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Well, why don't I don't know who I am
 without being helpful in trouble.
  </li><li>Yeah, now, when my identity is bringing you delight
 so that I can receive delight,
 it looks like help that's really using you
 to make myself okay.
  </li><li>I want it sickly.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 but it feels so good.
  </li><li>This is less something that you've said, right?
 This is more, I'm tapping you for some wisdom.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So, you know, we've talked a lot on the podcast.
 We did a whole summer on Feelings.
 I was just with some guys this week
 who've been doing some work.
 And you'll know this pattern,
 'cause I experienced it, I'm sure you did too.
 And it's hard to ask this question
 without sounding elitist or too-tourism,
 but here's the dynamic.
 You start the process of some work,
 whether that's therapy, whether that's group work,
 whether it's facing all the stuff that you've been talking about.
 For me, I start to cover your spiritual direction.
 I started in group work, and I suddenly realized,
 "Oh God, I've been running from my feelings my whole life."
 Didn't know how lonely I was,
 didn't know how fearful I was, et cetera.
 I've been running from how God's made me for a long time.
 Then I get in touch with that,
 and it's horrible and also great.
 But the horror extends that when I leave group or leave therapy or leave,
 and I go interact with my family system,
 my work environment, and my friendship group,
 and realize they are not aware of the thing that I'm now aware of.
 What do I do in that loneliness?
 And I remember you would say, which I broke the rules, where you would say,
 "Hey, when you learn this stuff, don't go do it with your wife."
 It's just for you.
 Just don't do it.
 I take it to my whole work place.
 Yes.
 What are you doing that tension of you've got a piece of you,
 and now you're angry for everybody else to get a piece of them
 so that you can have more of them?
 So you won't be lonely.
 So you won't be lonely.
 But all right.
 And you have this good thing you want to give away.
  </li><li>What would you do with that tension?
  </li><li>Yeah, attention's a wonderful teacher, right?
 Because it creates more feeling,
 creates more tolerance of feeling,
 it creates more patience, it creates more dependence,
 it creates more wisdom, it is a hard thing to do.
 But also over, I wouldn't call it tears,
 I'm gonna call it, that's actually like a point
 on the journey, right?
 It's almost like when you come to faith,
 like you know you have something other people need.
 And so then you try to like shove it down everybody's throat,
 or you judge people for not believing what you believe.
 Instead of coming to understand over time
 that like, man, the spirit is moving.
 And where can you join in where the spirit's already working
 as opposed to you being the spirit, right?
 But you have to kind of go through the first phase to--
  </li><li>Which is awkwardness.
  </li><li>Awkward, yeah.
 So self-growth, self-awareness, healing work, maturity work,
 it certainly comes to a place of like,
 I need the people in my life to have this.
 And some people stay in that longer.
 Some people grow through that quickly,
 but Alt me comes to a place of recognizing,
 oh, this person, I was where they were.
 Like they're right where they need to be.
 And when you can't make someone take what they don't want,
 you know, I was with a guy,
 I was having lunch with a guy a few weeks ago.
 And someone introduced us because this person recognized
 that I might be able to help this person.
 So it's like, well, let's meet for lunch.
 This guy doesn't want help.
  </li><li>He's perfectly happy, satisfied, content,
 running his success route.
  </li><li>But this intermediary wants you to fix them.
  </li><li>It's really obvious,
 it's really obvious that this guy is gonna have a,
 the higher you climb the further you fall.
 He's gonna have a big destruction.
  </li><li>And he's unaware of it.
  </li><li>Yeah, totally.
  </li><li>And it's obvious to any of us
 who've experienced our own destruction.
 It's like, oh, I know where you're going.
 Like that's all.
  </li><li>And you don't have ears to hear and that's also okay.
  </li><li>Yeah and I've got like, I'm not God.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like Jesus is so big.
 It's like, oh, wherever this guy goes, God is,
 he'll be fine.
 God's there to meet him.
  </li><li>It's that whole thing of we walk in the light
 of the revelation we've received.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>So we know what we have and we're angry
 for other people to have it too.
 Sometimes for good reasons, sometimes for bad reasons.
 Take good and bad.
 I would say sometimes for water, pure reasons
 and sometimes for dirty reasons
 and together you get mud.
 and you're not gonna separate that.
 I think, again, this idea that we can get to the bottom
 of ourselves and separate the good from the bad,
 that's the spirit's work, right?
 We're muddy.
 We're muddy.
 We're actually, you go back to the first story,
 we're made of clay.
 We're molded of clay, right?
 Like we're made of the dirt of the earth.
 It's where the dark and the light meet
 and we're put together in that.
 And like, that's awesome.
 And if we would quit worrying about trying to like be so good and turn all that over
 to God and be ourselves, we could not try to be perfect and you could be out and I could
 be Stephen.
 And if I make some mistakes, you can tell me about it and I can go, Oh, gosh, I did that.
 Yeah, I did do that.
 That makes sense.
 I do do that.
 Like I'm so sorry.
 I've got some fundamental problems and they're changing and they're going to change a little
 bit more and I'm going to get a little bit more full-hearted.
 But I've got a log in my eye, then you got a speck of dirt in your eye.
 And if I can just recognize that I got this log and it's my log and it hits people upside
 the head when I turn to talk to them, you know, that plank is my plank.
 It's the thorn in my flesh.
 And how do I own and take responsibility and accept that I am made limited, you know,
 and it's okay.
 And that starts to be grace and mercy.
 And so to kind of go back to like,
 what do I do when I get this thing
 and I want everybody to have it,
 it's like recognize they may not want what you're selling,
 but when they're thirsty, they'll drink it.
 But dogs return to their own vomit too.
 So they might have to drink some vomit for a while
 until they find out there's some cool water somewhere.
 It's like, that's the way we are.
  </li><li>Let's end there.
  </li><li>'Cause that is profound and beautiful
 and horrible at the same time, which is--
  </li><li>This is a human story.
 Where can people find out more about you,
 the work that you're doing, the books that you've written, the podcast you host.
 You know, there's a state show podcast.
 You can check that out.
 Google, Stephen James on Amazon.
 There's two of us.
 So the one with the pH, I sometimes get his royalty checks and he gets mine.
 It's very straight.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We have the same publishers.
 That was weird.
 But coming a dad, parenting with heart, hope the age of addiction, the Zis dress made me
 look fat.
 How did it occur, ball girl?
 The perfect steak can be a real man.
 I've read some really good books, really bad books.
 All things Art of Noat, of Nurturing Boys is probably the most notarized book I've written.
 I'll put a link in the show.
 Yeah, thanks.
 All those things.
 Social media.
 Social media.
 You know, I have been off social media now for about 16 weeks.
 I love, I've missed it.
 I think it's actually really cool.
 I was recognizing for myself it was creating some anxiety and some, I love the likes, like
 I love them.
 And I love looking at other people's cool stuff and I like buying shoes off Instagram.
 I was like, this is weird.
 So I've been off social media.
 You can look me up on social media.
 Sacial counseling, the company that I lead,
 a group that I lead.
 And then most of my time these days
 is spent with the leadership lab.
 And if you're an entrepreneur, leader, executive,
 want to have more full-heartedness,
 we are building a very vibrant community here,
 Middle Tennessee, probably 80% of our people
 from Middle Tennessee, another 20% from outside
 that come in.
 And that's a great way to engage the work
 that I'm doing and the work we're doing.
 We're starting back evenings at Sage Hill.
 So if you're here in Nashville once a month,
 we host a community gathering or me
 or somebody from our team teaches
 that's gonna start back in August.
 I would say this, I love interacting with people.
 I love talking about life.
 There is in us a lust for a king.
 There's a lust for a guru and there's a lust for a messiah.
 And I am so glad to encourage people, but I ain't your guru.
  </li><li>Right.
 You've got to live your life.
 I'm a rabbi to some people and I get to choose who those people are.
 And I love teaching and training and developing people and mentoring people as
 like coaching people.
 That is a passion of mine.
 I come in alongside people and helping them be them.
 And like if I've said anything that encourages anybody, thank you.
 Right.
 And like go find someone who encourages you.
 Like I'm not the answer to your life.
 So healthy boundaries right there.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But you have social media.
 Yeah.
 Well, thank you so much for giving up time.
 Oh, I feel fed.
 This is so fun.
 Joy to have you.
 We'd love to have you back.
 I would love that.
 Thanks for being with us.
 Thanks, man.
 Our thanks to Stephen for coming on the show.
 Yeah, thank you for listening to and a huge thank you to our members as well who make this episode possible.
 If you would like the show notes for this week's episode with all the links that Stephen and I talked about, go to Alan and age.com/286.
