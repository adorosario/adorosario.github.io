<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>AJ Jones. - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>Episode 244 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And you're back from your vacation.
  </li><li>Yeah, oh, is that what we're calling it?
 Sure. - No, I'm being facetious.
 Last week, we had our dear friend, David Wagner.
  </li><li>Yes. - Who jumped in
 to cover for us. - Cover for me.
 Yes, yeah, to make it possible.
 Yeah.
 Because you had an interest in weeks.
 So this week's weekly catch up is going to have a surgical flare to it.
 Yes.
 Well, I think it's like most of the podcasts, isn't it?
 Most of the podcasts is you telling us your story because I gave a little preview.
 You said, I want to tell a story.
 Okay.
 And so I'm going to be interested to see if I'll let you like jumping in.
 I'm going to be interested to see if you will do my best on history.
 I think not.
 AJ Jones, take it away.
 So that's the story.
 Let's go back where you've been and what's been happening way, way back to the end of May.
 We went to Charlotte to visit your sister.
 Hold the phone.
 That was back in May.
 Yeah.
 End of May, very end of May.
 Right.
 Dang.
 So we went to Charlotte to have a visit with Caris and Ben and the kids.
 And, you know, it was wonderful.
 However, while we were there on the Wednesday, I mean, I woke up feeling fine, but I was in the shower and shaving my legs.
 And I all of a sudden felt like excruciating pain. And I was like, I don't know what's happening right now.
 There's, you know, there's something wrong. So turns out I didn't remember to shave the other leg.
 Found that out later.
 These are the details that you tune in for.
 Yeah, yeah. These are most of them.
 She had a lot of sighted hair legs.
 Basically, yep, and crawled out of the bath and texted you and said,
 "Hey, babe, I need you."
 And you responded and said, "Watching the kids in the pool and working outside.
 Come on down." And I was like, "Uh, I need you."
 At which point I hear you running up two flights of stairs.
 Yes.
  </li><li>Point of interjection? - Yes.
 Okay. So we've talked about my bathing habits that cause you concern.
 Your bathing or showering habits, you have something interesting
 that you continually overheat yourself in either the path of the shower.
 Yes.
 So it is not that uncommon for you to have to text me and meet
 to come into the bathroom and find you like, you know, just face down on the floor,
 trying to recover.
 And I just thought, oh, you've just overheated yourself.
 It was one of those.
 Yeah.
 Because also that guest bathroom doesn't have an extractor fan that really moves
 any of there.
 So as soon as I opened the door, I thought, you just overheated yourself.
 Yeah.
 And I'm actually sitting on the floor in, in, you know, it's
 significant pain.
 And how much ibuprofen
 are you taking at this point?
 None.
 So none of this
 part. No, no, no.
 So you helped me get into
 our room and that's called a
 fireman's lift just through her
 over my shoulders,
 baby, knees and just carried
 a dump on the bed.
 That was how I remember it.
 And nobody needs to know.
 OK.
 So yeah, I took four ibuprofen
 which is how many milligrams
 for 800.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm. - Milligrams.
 And it didn't really do much.
 I lied there for a while.
 I was getting ready to try and take some more,
 you know, a couple hours later.
 And then I think that's when I started vomiting.
 And then I texted you, 'cause you were still downstairs
 taking care of the kids and everything
 while I was lying in bed.
 And I just said, I think I have to go to the hospital.
 So we went to the hospital.
  </li><li>Wait, you're skipping all the good bits.
  </li><li>Oh, I had the good bits.
  </li><li>This is why-- - This is why
 I like to tell the story because--
  </li><li>Okay, no, but you tell interesting bits
 that didn't happen, so this will be interesting.
 What are the good bits that I missed?
  </li><li>Do you not remember a conversation we had
 while we were in the car?
  </li><li>Well-- - So you're writhing in pain.
  </li><li>Oh, yes, okay.
  </li><li>Do you remember the question you asked me?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So you're writhing in pain?
 You've now taken 1600 milligrams of ibuprofen.
  </li><li>Well, I vomited up the, yes, I took it
 and then it came back up.
  </li><li>And you took more?
  </li><li>No.
 No, I took the first set.
 couple hours later, I tried to take more of vomit it right back up.
  </li><li>I don't realize that.
 Okay, so we're driving there.
 Age is clearly in a huge amount of pain.
 This woman has an incredibly high pain threshold.
 So whenever she's in pain, you know, that's significant.
 And, you know, I'm praying and I'm, what age you doesn't know is
 I'm a part-time doctor, so I'm assuming it's appendicitis
 because it, you know, matches all the symptoms.
  </li><li>Uh-huh.
  </li><li>But we're driving there and I don't know whether you're--
  </li><li>Except that it wasn't the right side of the body.
 But anyway, Dr. Jones.
  </li><li>Well, in my defense, you wouldn't let me examine you.
 You're all like where your credentials then we were driving there. I don't know whether you're trying to distract yourself from the pain
 Or whether you're feeling bad, but we're driving there and you say babe, you know
 You didn't you didn't get any lunch because I just made my lunch remember I came up
 So we're in the car and AJ's all like I'm picture the scene. We're racing to emergency
 She's in agony like double over and yeah
 I don't say you were screaming but you were making noises and then I hear you squeal like baby
 but you didn't eat any lunch and so I quipped, "Oh no problem, I'll just pull over here and we'll pick us some jig-ful."
 It was silent and you were like, "I don't appreciate your humor right now."
 And I was like, "Okay, Grant, it's one of those moments."
 It was one of those moments. So, since you're talking about being in the car, when we're in the car,
 I was sort of running through my head like what this could be.
 I don't know if anybody else ever does like worst-case scenario things.
 You've downloaded WebMD offline in your head.
 And I've had endometriosis much earlier in life,
 but it felt like that kind of pain, but worse.
 So I was like, is it that?
 Is it all of a sudden back?
 Is it a tumor?
 Is it, you're thinking all the different things?
 And so as I'm sort of processing that well,
 moaning on the way to the hospital,
 I just hear the Holy Spirit just really sweetly say,
 whatever you hear today, this is not cancer.
 And I was like, okay, so in my head,
 I'm like, I'm gonna hear something.
 Like I'm going to get there
 and they're going to say something.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>So we get to the hospital.
 The hospital was...
  </li><li>We didn't notice at that point.
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>That the hospital was...
  </li><li>No, we just went to the nearest hospital.
  </li><li>My sister says, hey, what's the best?
 You know, what's the closest hospital?
  </li><li>Yeah. - And so she told us
 we drove up. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Were you gonna say the hospital was somewhat sketchy?
  </li><li>Oh yeah. - We didn't know that
 at the time. - Super sketch.
  </li><li>'Cause we pulled in and I'm not allowed in,
 of course COVID precautions.
  </li><li>Right. - And so they were there
 with a wheelchair.
 You know, they said we saw you get out of the car.
  </li><li>Right. - And they said, "Man, can you speak?"
 And I'd already prepared your driver's license,
 health insurance card and our HSA,
 you know, the health savings account card.
 They gave you those three things, they wheeled you in.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I'm going in and out of feeling like
 I'm gonna pass out from the pain.
 And then they like wheel me up and they're asking me
 questions that they can find on my driver's license.
 So I'm a bit like, I mean, really, but anyway.
 So we do that.
 And then they just sort of wheel me over
 and stick me in the corner and leave me there
 for about 25 minutes or something.
 And I'm--
  </li><li>And I don't know any of this
 because as you pointed out, I haven't eaten lunch yet
 and I'm realizing there's not much I can do literally.
 like ER, it's gonna be an hour before I know anything.
 So thanks to Apple Maps, it tells me,
 "There is a Chick-fil-A, not two minutes away."
 So I'm thinking, I'm not gonna find Mark and Spock anyway.
  </li><li>It was a provision from the Lord.
  </li><li>So I drive to Chick-fil-A.
  </li><li>Get your lunch.
  </li><li>Eat my Chick-fil-A thing.
 Nothing is really happening.
 I drive back maybe 45 minutes, 50 minutes later.
 And I call the hospital.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Did you have your phone?
  </li><li>I did, yeah.
  </li><li>I thought I'll call the hospital first.
 So I called the hospital and they said,
 "Oh, you're in the waiting room.
 At which point I want to hit the roof like,
 why is my wife in the waiting room,
 like has she not been seen?"
 And I think you called me and you filled me in.
  </li><li>So basically in that 45 minutes or an hour or whatever,
 you know, I waited in the waiting room
 and then they took me into the triage thing
 and the nurse practitioner came in and said,
 "You know, clearly you're in a lot of pain.
 We're gonna give you something to help with pain.
 Have you ever had a gallstone before?
  </li><li>Kidney stone.
  </li><li>Kidney stone before, you know, no, heaven.
 Okay, it's, you know, it's probably that,
 but we're gonna need to do a CT scan
 and we're gonna, you know, get you something
 and I'm just repeating as long as you don't give me
 dramamine 'cause I'm allergic to dramamine.
 And I've been injected with dramamine
 at a hospital wearing a bracelet saying I was a picture.
  </li><li>Well, that's a funny thing 'cause they all very quickly
 go, "Well honey, we already know you're allergic to dramamine."
  </li><li>Like, that's nice.
  </li><li>And you're like, "I know, but the last hospital
 "I was in also new and I had a big red bracelet
 I said algae and they still injected me with.
  </li><li>Right, and this place looked like,
 like I don't know, a clown might have been running
 on the second floor.
  </li><li>Man, I've set the scene.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>So you know how most D.R.s you go in and there's a desk
 where they would check you in and there's a big waving room
 where they take you back to triage
 and then you're wheeled into a ward or a room.
 I don't know whether they were.
  </li><li>I think they were super busy.
  </li><li>You said they're super busy, but what they'd done is
 they turned the whole waiting room into a makeshift ward.
 And by makeshift, I just mean, you know,
 every six feet they'd put up a mobile partition
 and patients were just lying there, you know,
 like gurgling or hunched over or in pain,
 just waiting for doctors to see them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So when I eventually got in because you had been seen,
 you were in the waiting room,
 which I later learned was a ward.
 Like literally there's a piece of photocopy paper
 above your head with a number
 and that was the ward that you were in.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So they must have been jam packed.
 Yeah, yeah.
 And I don't know how to say this delicately,
 but they, I don't know if it was a rough area of town,
 but they seem to be serving either a large population
 of homeless people or people in an area
 with mental health issues, as well as physically.
 Yeah, it was an interesting group of people
 that were even just sitting waiting.
 And because you're in the room, there's no privacy.
 You can overhear everybody's case file.
 Oh yeah, I mean, I literally was sitting there once they,
 Well, first of all, let me just finish.
 They did the triage.
 She said, she can get me drugs right away.
 We'll be in the hallway to say we're bringing you the drugs right now and left
 me for another 20 minutes in the hallway.
 I'm literally starting to vomit.
 I'm in so much pain.
 And then they show up and they're like, Hey, we're gonna give you some pain meds.
 And I'm like, okay, great.
 They've already put in like a port for, um,
 a USB C port.
 Yeah.
 USB C bar, you know, intravenous or whatever.
 And so they give me drugs and then they wheel me back out into the front lobby.
 And that's when you called and I called you was they had just given me drugs.
 I promise you, I'm trying not to vomit. I'm so nauseous.
 They've just given me morphine and then wheeled me back to where nobody's
 actually watching me into the front lobby,
 where I get to hear charming conversation about somebody's man parts very loud that
 is happening right behind me because that's their room in quotation marks.
 And I'm just like, where did we come to?
 Like, what is happening right now?
 Anyway, so--
  </li><li>So many fun stories that we heard.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, somebody that needed some sort of
 gastrointestinal surgery,
 and while the doctor's explaining this to the patient,
 she's eating a cheeseburger.
  </li><li>Wait, she had her friend bring after they said
 she couldn't have food.
  </li><li>And the doctor's like, where did you get that from?
 She's like, I was hungry.
 And he's like, yeah, but you have all like a bowl.
 Like, that thing is wrong about the surgery.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So then largely, you know, lots of VR is hurry up and wait.
  </li><li>Yeah, so they just basically kept dosing me with morphine.
  </li><li>Well, what was crazy is the morphine,
 literally it was five vials of morphine.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the morphine was supposed to give you like four hours
 of relief.
  </li><li>It was lasting about an hour.
  </li><li>Less than an hour.
 Like it would take a, you know, a hot minute to kick in,
 and then it would give you maybe 50 minutes of reprieve,
 and then you would start cramping back up again
 start yelling and moaning and getting sweaty and pasty white.
 And I
  </li><li>I'm charming visual.
  </li><li>I know, I kept trying to get...
  </li><li>I looked great.
  </li><li>Who is so fantastic.
  </li><li>I kept asking for, um, delodid.
 I was like, she responds really well to delodid.
  </li><li>And they're like, we're not using that here.
  </li><li>Which may have been our downfall for later,
 but you could not get comfortable.
 You were either vomiting or crying.
  </li><li>Right, and I'm just sitting in a chair
 where everybody who's walking to the hospital
 can see me in my room in quotation marks.
 So anyway, go for the CT scan,
 which again, super weird.
 And they inject you with like weird stuff
 that makes you feel like you're having hot flashes.
 And then come back out.
 And so the doctor comes to us and says,
 okay, so you had assist, a large cyst that ruptured,
 but also the CT scan showed that you have a tumor
 on your left ovary.
 And we believe it's probably benign,
 but you're gonna wanna get it looked at
 and we're just waiting 'cause we wanna,
 the G, Guino doctor there needs to look at it
 and find out does he need to do surgery right now
 because it was kind of large.
 So we're both looking at her and she's like,
 "So you understand what I'm saying?"
 And I think part of what she was waiting for was a big reaction.
 But again, I'm expecting to hear something because the Holy Spirit said,
 no matter what you hear today, it isn't cancer.
 So I was like, okay.
 And on the way, the Holy Spirit has already told me, like,
 this is nothing you need to worry about in time you'll laugh about it.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 So yeah, we're just waiting.
 Here we are laughing anyway.
 So anyway, so she, I think she thought we just didn't understand or something.
 So she said it again, we're like, okay.
 So then I go for an altar sound and you know, that was wonderful.
 And then they basically I'm they still haven't managed my pain.
 They they I'm still vomiting.
 You're still pasty.
 Why I'm still pasty and they're like, OK, so the guy here says the surgery doesn't
 need to happen right now.
 So go home and see your doctor in Nashville and here's some prescriptions.
 Well, but the prescription.
 I asked, well, what meds are you giving her?
 And they were like it is
 Neproxin which is basically over the counter a leave right another non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug and so I said and
 What else right you know and they were like well, you know the approximation will take care of it and I'm like
 Which point you know
 You're stabilized and I'm like
 Are you kidding like vomiting?
 She looks stabilized and they're like well, you know heart rate stable or blood pressure stable
 I was like but she's seizing in agony like if I appreciate that your job is to stabilize her and discharge us
 It's 10 p.m. At night by time we get out of here. It's 11 p.m
 I don't have to bring her back in the wee hours of the morning because your five vials of morphine haven't touched the pain
 And they said well then they said well what do you suggest and I was like deluded
 get her deluded and they were like, no, we're not going to get her deluded.
 And I was like, well, can you give her something more than a
 proxy, you know, for the love of all that's holy.
 And we just, the only reason we know about deluded is from a previous surgery.
 It didn't mess me up as badly as most other drugs do.
 Right.
 And it was what they gave me when I had my kidney stone and we know you
 tolerated well and we know that oxycodone makes you a bit loopy.
 Yeah.
 But that's so anyway, they end up sending us home with oxy.
 Yeah.
 And we're breezing through the story,
 but like every step of the story takes an hour, two hours.
 Meanwhile, you know, our kids, God bless my sister
 and my brother-in-law, we're obviously worried
 that our kids are worried, our kids were not worried.
 They were having a great time.
  </li><li>Oh, they're with their cousins,
 having a great time in the pool in the back.
  </li><li>I'm the best I'm ever.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're like, "Mom, she'll be fine."
  </li><li>We get discharged by 11 p.m. and we have to find
 a 24-hour, what's it called, pharmacy?
  </li><li>Yeah, it was quite scary.
 Well, we felt like we were in a scary,
 I don't know if we were or not,
 But, and I'm in and out of it, you know.
  </li><li>Oh, and they did give you oxy?
  </li><li>Yes, they gave me oxy to take before I got in the car.
  </li><li>And then another prescription for oxy.
  </li><li>Yeah, and a prescription for oxy.
 And then we get home and basically just from the effort
 of getting out of the car and into the house,
 I start vomiting again, go upstairs,
 try and keep drugs down, go to bed,
 and, you know, ride out the week.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And we drive back.
  </li><li>Drive back, we pushed back, driving back an extra day,
 drove all the way home on Saturday.
 And on Monday, went to see my gynecologist
 who delivered Tia and MJ, lovely guy.
 And so basically he was like--
  </li><li>Well, we've already sent overall the CT scan,
 the ultrasound, all that sort of stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And so he said, okay, so this thing's about
 size of an orange, which we didn't know that.
 That was that big.
 Six centimeters by nine centimeters.
 Yeah.
 And he said, you know, probably benign.
 You're going to need to have your ovary taken out, you know, blah, blah.
 And you probably need to do that pretty, you know, pretty quick.
 And I was in pain still anyway, and sort of like, great, get it.
 We've got plans at the end of the summer.
 Like let's just get on with this.
 So he recommends me to our surgeon who has got the best doctor name ever and probably
 should have been an anesthesiologist.
 But his name is Dr. Numb Numb.
 Dr. Numb Numb.
 I was like, so many jokes I could make right now.
 And I'm sure he's heard all of them.
 And he was such a lovely guy.
 But even when he said his own name, I smiled because I was just like, it's just so funny.
 Anyway, so go to see him takes about 10 days.
  </li><li>It took about 10 days to get an appointment.
 He does surgery Mondays, Wednesday, Fridays.
 He didn't have an open till Thursday.
 So you're in all this pain, not getting any relief.
  </li><li>Just chewing on Advils and trying to-
  </li><li>No proxy and your oxy and-
  </li><li>No, I didn't keep taking the oxy
 'cause it just messes me up.
  </li><li>It does.
 I've got some great home videos of Adione Oxy.
 (laughs)
 Anyway, so managing whatever, managing through the pain
 and then not managing.
 I wasn't. You were in you were in during the pain. I don't know if you were managing the pain.
 I was still functional. We'll see. Still working. Sure. Okay.
 And anyway, go in to see the surgeon on the Thursday and he says, basically, I would bring you
 into more if I could. We're going to get you in next week, which ended up scheduling for Monday.
 And yeah, you're going to lose the ovary.
 Um, I don't remember him saying I was going to lose a
 fallopian tube, but he took that to, I guess it was like a package deal.
 I don't know how that whole thing works.
 Makes a great necklace.
 So that goes dependent.
 Uh, and so he, you know, he was just like, let's get you in here and get this
 sorted kind of thing.
 So I was like, okay, great.
 But that, that, that week that you were going to get surgery was the week we
 planned to take on vacation.
 Yes.
 So cancel vacation.
 You take sick days obviously for the time you need for the surgeon recovery.
 I take two days, sick days to actually help you.
 I'm still largely working from home, second work around and really you don't need much
 help.
 No, I just needed to lie still and nobody touched me.
 So we went into the hospital in the month.
 Yeah.
 Went into the hospital and I went in expecting he said there'll be three or four incisions.
 He'll try and keep it at three and keep them as small as he can and it's laparoscopic.
 but I did know they were gonna pump me up with air
 'cause that's how they do those, well gas.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And because I've had a surgery like that before,
 I know my body can't get rid of that gas.
 Like, well it's important to note that the gas is not
 like digestive gas, you can burp or fart out.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>It's under the skin that just literally inflates you
 like a frog and shrek.
  </li><li>Right, but all of the paperwork says the gas pain
 will only last for two to three days.
 For me it was 10.
 So it's just my body just doesn't know how to get rid
 it once it's in there. Anyway, so we knew we were doing that and went into surgery and
 woke up and was in just a horrendous amount of pain. And so they gave me delotted and then they
 gave me tordle and then they gave me something or other else. And then they basically loaded
 me in the car and sent me home. Yeah, I came, got you. Well, I mean, I was there the whole time.
 I was shocked.
 Well, first of all, your surgery got delayed by an hour.
 Yes.
 But once I like wheeled you and I didn't get to see you.
 No, I just lied.
 And I didn't have my phone or anything.
 I'm lying in a room watching people walk by for several hours.
 And the surgery he said would take about an hour.
 He was done in 40 minutes.
 Well, that's good.
 And so he came out full of energy like, hey, you know,
 Mr. Oskre, yeah, Mr. Clark went straight forward yet.
 No problem yet.
 That sucker was big, bigger than we thought it would be.
 So I had to do like a couple of more incisions.
 You had to make a paper.
 Anyway, great.
 Yeah, you'll be able to see her.
 OK, bye.
 I'm like, any questions?
 He just was in and out.
 Yeah.
 I was shocked at how fast the surgery was.
 And then you're right.
 They wheeled you out.
 And I was bummed because I like being in there when you're
 just waking up because I can ask you tons of questions.
 Like the last time when you got me
 to say something about parakeets.
 Well, I didn't get you to say anything.
 I just was inquisitive-minded.
 And you had some fascinating stuff to talk about.
 Yeah.
 put a link in the show note to that particular episode.
  </li><li>Okay. - Which I forgot
 to top my head. - Yeah.
  </li><li>So then we came home and we started
 every two and a half hours a...
  </li><li>Yeah. - Oxy...
  </li><li>The pain was pretty brutal for about the first four days.
  </li><li>Five days. - What was it?
  </li><li>You're also multi-colored.
 You look like you had a fight with...
 It looks like Freddy Krueger took you bowling.
 Just like, hch, and then threw you.
 And 'cause you got these like five--
  </li><li>Yeah, I have five incisions.
 And none of them are, I think because of my last laparoscopic thing, you know, they were all like a centimeter long.
 These are all at a minimum an inch.
 There's one that's, you know, two inches on the side, you know, so there's, there were just, everything was bigger than I thought it was me and so much more people.
 So yeah, I was just taking a oxy and Advil and just trying to breathe and
 Well, what was interesting was as long as you were horizontal,
 Those two types of pain as far as I could tell,
 there was the pain from having incisions in your abdomen.
 Yeah.
 But then the gas pain was larger.
 Yeah.
 And when you were lying down, of course,
 the gas pain would dissipate and you were just left with the abdominal pain.
 Right.
 But when you would stand up, I was going to go to the bathroom or to walk around.
 Yeah.
 You were like a fizzy Coke bottle that when you went upright,
 all the bubbles rushed to the top and your neck and your shoulders.
 And then I couldn't breathe.
 Like it would get all up in my ribcage.
 And I literally was like, I can't breathe.
 I can't, like it was just so painful.
 Yeah.
 And it just wasn't dissipating quickly.
 So it was, I had a million amazing ladies on a prayer chain, like praying and yeah.
 So
 you've been recovering for the last two weeks in bed.
 Yes, not back at work yet, but we'll be back soon.
 Yeah, a couple more days.
 Yeah.
 I've been the family Uber driver.
 You have.
 And you're not used to doing all the time.
 I usually do all the family driving.
 Yeah.
 So and when I drive, not a day goes by when I don't think I really should not be driving.
 Yeah, there's not a day that goes by where I'm driving and with you while you're
 driving that I think you really should.
 The number of times I get out of the car and I've left it in drive or haven't
 turned a car off.
 This is why you need a Tesla, I'm like, oh, just a little bit, a little bit cuckoo.
 So yeah, and also our kids have had VBS this week, which they've loved.
 It's an early star and then they had a sleepover at the church, you know, a lock
 in. So that was a late night, early morning, bring them home, bring them, but, you know,
 it's just been a lot of shuttles.
 But I do want to boast on our community, yeah, on our friends and family who have
 brought us a meal and in the midst of, you know, you being uncomfortable and, you
 know, the necessary adjustments with that.
 It was beautiful watching our kids go, you know, why did someone so bring us a meal?
 And why somebody else? Why is everyone bringing us a meal and just getting to talk about what
 community does for one another and watching that turn off the kids. So big thank you to all in our
 community who've been caring for us. Thank you so much. Whether it's bringing us meals, whether it's
 texting us, whether it's checking in on us, whether it's bringing for us. Really appreciate that.
 Yeah. So, so that's it. So I am recovering and in much less pain each day, right now I just
 mostly just feel the pain at the site.
  </li><li>How do you feel sitting?
 Sitting like a pain- - It's not my favorite.
  </li><li>Okay, but like are you in pain?
 Do you need to stand up?
  </li><li>A little bit, but I'll be okay.
  </li><li>Can we look for this week's episode lying on our backs?
  </li><li>Oh, that'd be a good idea.
 Yeah, I mean, no challenge for Chris whatsoever
 and trying to figure out how to film that.
  </li><li>That'd be easy.
  </li><li>Yeah. - You can get it.
  </li><li>It's professional.
  </li><li>I'm curious, you've had a lot of time on your own
 and I've noticed a difference in your recovery process
 than historically would happen.
 Should I be less faked?
 Do you know what I'm talking about?
  </li><li>Yeah, be less faked, 'cause I have no idea what you're talking about.
  </li><li>We've often talked about how when I'm a patient,
 I just wanna be cared for, and I need love and I need attention.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And when easy, and when you recovery,
 you want everybody to leave you,
 you just wanna be on your own.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And this time's been a little bit different.
  </li><li>It has been.
 Well, I think it because again, I'm in counseling now.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And write the, you know, the Friday before going
 in a surgery, my counselor sort of challenged me
 about whether I was able to actually receive
 other people caring for me, and what could that look like?
 And how could that make my life different kind of thing?
 And he was more specifically talking about
 from females, like from nurture,
 I might get it asking for help,
 and my whatever, and the answer is no.
 So he sort of challenged me with all that,
 and I sort of thought about that.
 then also, usually I don't even want you in the room,
 the kids in the room, like I'm just like,
 I'm in pain, I just wanna get better.
 I wanna be able to myself until I feel better.
 But this time actually you would hang out with me.
  </li><li>Well, I've always been willing to hang out with you.
 This time you welcomed me into your,
 you know, your sanctum of solitude.
  </li><li>Well, and I think it's just because Samuel was like,
 what could it look like for you to do it differently?
  </li><li>And you tried it.
 I tried it.
  </li><li>And you had a friend come over, you know,
 one of the nights, I had to go out,
 I forget why I was, I didn't want to leave you on my own.
 And so I said, you know, do you have a friend
 that could come over and just be with you
 and just kind of watch TV with you in the room?
 And I would say that that was the biggest,
 the most monumental spurt of growth and healing
 happened overnight.
  </li><li>Yeah, I felt much better the next day.
  </li><li>That you had a friend being with you
 and it lifted your spirits and you seemed a little bit better.
  </li><li>Yeah, the only thing that was bad about that
 is this particular friend makes me laugh a lot
 and laughter hurts.
 And so I had to ban her from making me laugh.
 But other than that, it was great.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was a good progress on that.
  </li><li>When Shannon came over, she hung out for a while.
 Like previously when I'm sick, I don't want anybody.
 I'm just like, you know, no.
 Yeah, so it was great.
 I mean, from that perspective, yeah,
 I think there was some breakthrough with stuff.
 I don't know what it means.
  </li><li>I'm, I've been curious.
 And this is kind of like a rhetorical question
 'cause I think I know the answer,
 but it's probably worth asking.
 You know, we are big proponents of the goodness of God,
 the kindness of God,
 we're people who preach on healing,
 we're people who minister healing.
 Like, you know, we're all, yay God.
 And you know, we have very, very,
 probably somewhat different views on spiritual warfare
 than a lot of charismatic people.
 And so I'm interested in,
 like it seems really easy to preach all that stuff
 when stuff is going well.
 And here you've just had,
 I didn't realize it was a month long, a month long,
 hoo, hiccup.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Well, I'm curious what happens to your theology in that.
  </li><li>I don't think anything's changed with my theology.
  </li><li>But I'm--
  </li><li>I mean, nothing.
 I don't back away from God is good and,
 he's still big and he's on the throne.
 And so, I don't know.
  </li><li>So your head doesn't go, well, if God was good,
 this wouldn't happen to me.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Or I believe in healing
 or this is the devil attack.
  </li><li>I had plenty of opportunities to go there
 when I was younger with all the other stuff
 that I went through and sort of decided or learned,
 my heart decided I'm not letting go of he is good,
 he is kind and I'm not gonna,
 that kind of stuff I would just take captive really fast.
  </li><li>And you can appoint to the kindness of God
 and actually we just talked about our community rallying around.
 I sort of talked about, for me it was really healing,
 watching you be open to a different way of recovery.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause usually when you're sick, it's so lonely for me
 'cause it's just like, you know, I bring something,
 you're like, "Ouch, ouch, ouch."
 You know, that's what it feels like.
 It might be a little reaction on my part.
  </li><li>It feels like maybe, yeah.
  </li><li>And, but also I was thinking about like,
 you went in and it was a ruptured cyst
 that caused the pain.
 You said the pain was as bad as childbirth,
 it was bad as labor. - Oh yeah, oh yeah.
  </li><li>But with no baby at the end.
  </li><li>Right, and it was funny 'cause when I talked to my,
 my actual kind of colleges.
 He was like, oh yeah, it's awful.
 You know, and yeah, that was,
 but because of that, we found this.
  </li><li>And the other thing, yeah.
  </li><li>And I mean, who knows?
 Like, well, you know, when we would have found it,
 how big it would have been by then, you know, like,
 so again, I do look at it and go, okay, well, you know,
 bummer that I had that, but so thankful
 that we found it, that there was great surgeons,
 that everything could happen quickly, you know.
  </li><li>And the kindness of God right in the moment to say,
 hey, honey, this, no matter what you hear today,
 it's not cancer.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And in fact, all the pathology came back.
 They did take the little, the beastie,
 the orange, the whatever.
 And to the--
  </li><li>I obviously did.
  </li><li>Yeah, did all the pathology stuff.
 And they said, yep, not cancer.
 Like you're clear, you're good to go.
  </li><li>And also, Dr. said, hey, you probably haven't,
 that ovary probably hasn't served you well
 in the last two years.
 too much, probably two years old.
 It's wrapped itself around it, it's strangled it.
  </li><li>Yeah, so you shouldn't know something.
  </li><li>Yeah, so he was like hormones and all that kind of stuff.
 You should feel the same.
 Still have another ovary working great kind of thing.
 So yeah, I mean, in many, in many sense, best case scenario.
 And I mean, I was just thinking,
 like we're going on vacation in a month.
 And I mean, what if it had something had happened then?
 Like what if it had ruptured then?
 You know what I mean?
 So, I'm just thankful for a whole bunch of different things,
 but yeah, thankful the pathology came back with all clear.
 And so now it's just healing from Wolverine's,
 yeah, attention to my stomach.
 And yeah.
  </li><li>All right, well--
  </li><li>You know, the real bummer is that I bought a bikini
 this year for the first time ever,
 and now I look like I've been attacked by, I don't know,
 some sort of garden implement.
 (laughs)
 So there, Ben goes that.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>So that brings us up to the last couple of weeks
 where we've been in the midst of all of that.
 Life continues.
  </li><li>Yeah, we celebrated your birthday.
  </li><li>We did celebrate my birthday.
  </li><li>I mean, kind of, not.
 Normally we'd go out for dinner
 and we'd probably hang out with some friends.
 I didn't do any of that.
  </li><li>I did all of that just without you.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>The only thing that was missing was my birthday belly dance,
 which is gonna be interesting this year.
  </li><li>Yeah, you know.
 very colorful even.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, no, so we celebrate your birthday.
 That was good.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was really sweet actually.
 I got to go out with our kids.
 So part of our family tradition is we got
 the cheesecake factory.
 I mean, historically it's been the cheesecake factory.
 The kids get to choose where they want to go.
 And so I, just the four of us went out and celebrate it
 'cause you were at home.
  </li><li>Yep. - Did I bring you home
 something? - You did.
 Yeah, you brought me food.
  </li><li>And then we ordered in Desanos.
  </li><li>Yes, we did. - The best piece
 and then more importantly than that, I got lots of gift vouchers for the Apple Store
 and so I went shopping and made myself happy.
 Got new watch straps.
 Got some new watch straps.
 Picked up those little, what are they called, air tags?
 Yes.
 Because I am the target customer.
 You are so the...
 People would probably not pick this of you, but literally, you lose your wallet daily.
 Well, it's because I hate having it, and so I just leave it everywhere.
 Like I'm looking forward to when like Apple can,
 and they're coming out with us where you can have your
 driver's license embedded in your phone and your key,
 you know, all that sort of stuff and do the car key.
 Until then, yes.
 So I've been playing hide and seek with my stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Literally the other day.
  </li><li>But sometimes you lose your phone as well.
 But you just happen to be able to ping it from you.
  </li><li>You watch, yeah.
  </li><li>And then your keys, well, I mean, it's anybody's guess,
 which is why I'm so into, he'll try and borrow my keys.
 And I was like, no, find your own.
 Because then he'll have lost both sets of keys.
  </li><li>Just yesterday though, I came home.
 Yeah. And as I've been able to leave where my keys were
 from my wallet and you're like, didn't you just attack?
 Oh, I did. And so then I got to, you know,
 wonder when the house find it.
 There's a thing that helps him find his lost.
 I love the kids play hide and seek with them.
 They just took my keys and they went and hid somewhere
 and then the other one found it
 and that entertained them for a while.
 Oh, really? Yeah. That's cool.
 That's cool. And I've got all the parenting life hacks here.
 Oh, yeah, absolutely.
 So that was fun.
 And I think that's really most of the sort of big stuff
 from the last couple weeks.
 I mean, I don't know, I've been in bed.
  </li><li>Oh, yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You were in a drug-induced haze,
 and the kids did say, "Daddy, when mommy comes out,
 can you ask her which one of us is her favorite?"
 So I did, you got the card, it was like, "Hey, babe,
 are you okay?
 Do you feel any pain?"
 I was like, "Okay, the kids really want to know
 which one is your favorite?"
 And you said, "You are my favorite."
 So I came home and was like, "Ha ha ha, in your face!"
 I'm always, "You're what?"
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's what you said.
  </li><li>You're not just making this up.
  </li><li>No, it's a truth. - There's no witnesses.
  </li><li>I didn't know she'd have recorded it.
 I am your favorite.
  </li><li>You are, you're my favorite.
  </li><li>Do you want a listeners question?
  </li><li>Yeah, sure.
  </li><li>Well, it's directed at both of us,
 but largely I think it's directed at me.
  </li><li>Well, do you want me to read it then?
  </li><li>Sure, go on there, go, listen to this question.
 You didn't bring your glasses,
 so this should be good.
 Do you want me to hold it out here so you can see it?
  </li><li>Uh, yeah, I can't see that at all.
 Can you make the type bigger?
 (laughs)
 That's not gonna help me.
  </li><li>Okay, I'll say it in your voice
 and then we can overdub it on you.
  </li><li>Oh, okay, yeah.
 Alan A.J., how do you schedule time to play video games?
 For example, as you know, Skyward Sword is coming out,
 a remake of an old Zelda game.
 And from what I know about Zelda games
 is gonna take some time to beat.
 How do you plan your play time
 while also balancing life being married,
 having a job, other goals, and having kids?
 Also, how do you plan out your game time to 100% games?
 Do you only play one game at a time?
 I assume you have a set time to play
 and when time's up, you save and you pick up
 on the next session.
 So how do you play video games, Hager Jones?
  </li><li>Well, so I only have played Zelda, really.
 So-- - It's true.
  </li><li>I haven't really, like I've, I tried doing--
  </li><li>But you-- - What was the animal one?
  </li><li>Animal Crossing. - Animal Crossing.
 I played that for a bit and then I was like meh.
  </li><li>Did you 100% breath the wild?
  </li><li>Yeah. - You did,
 you got all the core hooks. - Oh yeah.
 I 100% of it only once, and that took me probably a year.
  </li><li>You have no idea how turned on like that when I was like,
 I mean, I only 100% of once.
 I'm like, babe, you're a special woman.
  </li><li>I've done all the, like I've done Zelda
 and defeated all the bad guys
 and done all of the puzzle shrine things and whatever.
  </li><li>Well, you've done all the shrines.
  </li><li>Several times.
  </li><li>Well, hang on, when we say 100%,
 you've literally 100% it.
 You've got all the locations, all the corals,
 you've got all the shrines.
  </li><li>And in fact, that game is saved.
 like and I started a new game to go and just do it all again from the beginning and then I've
 Completed that and then did it again
 But I didn't 100% the core exceeds on the second one
 She's only on the one and that really took me over a year to do
 So answer the question like did you plan time? Do you have like between seven and eight? I will do this or it?
 Kind of just depended on when the other kids weren't playing we're also
 Sharing a switch so well back then we were a one-switch house. Yes now we're at several switch house hold and that's made it considerably
 But yeah, so it would be we would actually have timed like okay
 You get to play for 45 minutes and then you have to let so-and-so play and then you know
 So we would know okay, I'm gonna get to play for whatever
 Largely during work it would be once our kids go to bed
 Yeah kids would go to bed and we would you know
 Put on Zelda and then you'd play for a while and I'd play for a while
 I mean, I think you completed it long before I did.
 But I remember on Saturday mornings literally being like,
 normally if you wake up at like six or six thirty on Saturday morning,
 I'll roll over and go back to bed.
 But I would wake up and be like,
 "Oh, I first want to wake."
 And I'd make a coffee and run upstairs to start playing Zelda
 so that I got to play that morning before everybody got up.
 You tend to make time for your passions, but in terms of,
 you know, if we weren't playing Zelda, we'd be doing, you know, it's just it fails our downtime time.
 Yeah, it was a great de-stressor, like just, okay, go sit down, play for 45 minutes, play for an hour and just,
 I think particularly for me, I think I said this on one of the podcasts, but because I hadn't played video games before,
 I really didn't, the buttons, I had to really think about.
 You didn't have any muscle memory.
 Yeah, I had to think about everything that I was doing.
 And because of that, because I was like trying to follow the thing and explore and do all
 the different puzzles and whatever, and also remember which button to press where I literally
 could not think about all the other stress factors that are part of just what our lives
 look like being a pastor and all that kind of stuff.
 So for me, it was like a great shut off, you know, for an hour to just not think about
 anything else or anything sad and just play the game,
 which is, I think probably why I fell in love with it,
 'cause it was such a great sort of de-stresser.
  </li><li>And also in the question that you asked,
 you talked about me 100% games plural,
 but the truth is I don't play a lot of games.
 I just tend to play, I probably just tend
 to play one game at a time.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And Zelda was released what, four years ago,
 breath of the wild, four years ago?
 The next one won't come out until next year
 potentially. So you're talking like one game every five years.
 Yeah. And.
 But I mean, like, even with Odyssey or whatever, see, the thing is to
 is our kids play with us. Right. So I play a lot with the kids.
 Yeah. So they'll come along. Like with Zelda, you only one person
 can be playing, but we all
 as a family sitting there and then going, we'll try this. We'll try.
 I think we're supposed to do this. I think you're, you know, as
 you're trying to solve all the different things of, well, what does
 that mean? And what does that riddle mean? And, you know, all that
 Like every Wednesday night is bronight in our house. Yeah, so our girls go out to youth me and MJ have a bronight
 And it's usually me helping him on some sort of video game
 so last night for about an hour and a half we played Hyrule Warriors and
 And again also breath the wilds an exception. It's a massive game that's hundreds of hours to 100%
 other games like I 100% it
 What was the?
 Super Mario the re-release of Super Mario 3D world and Mario what it was called Bowser's
 there's fury. I like 100% of that in a weekend. Like it just
 didn't it's not a big game. It may be to right but even at that
 the kids were in there with you like the almost a lot of time
 then they go to bed they go about it like seven and probably
 from seven to 10 I'm powering through that I might be up
 early in the morning just you know playing it but they'd also
 be like don't do that big boss until I'm awake again and you're
 you know but I don't plan as high shapers as we are I don't
 have like a spreadsheet or timetable just play whenever we
 can. And like I said, you know, Zelda took months and months and months and months.
 Yeah. But to 100% Zelda, we did have an app that showed us where all the
 core exceeds because there's 900 of them. So I could probably from memory tell
 you where all 120 shrines are, uh, and get their pretty, you know, pretty easily,
 just because of what my memory is like, but I couldn't, I wouldn't be able to tell
 you 900. We also have a map of it. You know, we have like a prop where we have a
 cloth map of all of how I'm in.
  </li><li>Oh, you do. - So we need to get
 that framed if we are. - We do.
  </li><li>Well, anyway.
 So there's a simple answer.
 There's not a huge plan.
 I play way less video games than it might sound.
 And because I play so few,
 I only play ones I really, really love.
 And because I really love them, I want 100% them.
 I'm often playing with my kids.
 Asia has only played one game.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I did try Animal Crossing.
 I just, it just didn't, it didn't intrigue me.
  </li><li>Oh, that was also an interesting season.
 I mean, I played that a bit and then it just stopped.
 Like I probably haven't opened that game in over a year.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But when I was playing it.
  </li><li>Yeah, but when I was playing it was also
 the beginning of the pandemic.
 So it was-
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It was an ideal distraction.
  </li><li>And here we go kids, we're all gonna do this game together.
 Which that was also fun 'cause you all had your own houses
 on the island and so it was quite fun.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well listen, if you've got a question about anything,
 can be about video games, it can be about surgery,
 it can be about the Bible, whatever.
  </li><li>Well, probably don't ask me questions about surgery.
 He thinks he's a doctor, he's not.
 And, you know, I'm not sure we can answer surgery.
  </li><li>My friend, Glenn and I,
 I don't know why we pretend to be rib doctors.
 And when I say pretend to be rib doctors,
 that makes it sound like we're children.
  </li><li>What does it mean?
 Rib doctors.
 No, no, don't touch them.
  </li><li>Those ribs.
  </li><li>Trust me, I'm a doctor.
 So, you know, it makes it sound like
 that was a childhood friend.
 No, I met Glenn in his early 20s,
 my own friends, who pretended to be rib doctors,
 I don't know why.
 And so I know why, because it would be the tickle monster.
 So forever, I would tickle our kids and say,
 "Oh, trust me, I'm a rib doctor."
 And so the kids would have a lot of fun.
 And you're not a rib doctor.
 So once I printed up a fake,
 Harvard Medical School graduation certificate,
 but forgot to change the date on it.
 So it was today's date.
 And so I showed them,
 like, "Daddy has a graduation certificate.
 Like I am a proper rib doctor."
 And Tia instantly spotted it.
 It was that today's date.
 So anyway.
 You can ask questions about rib.
 I'm a, you know, rib doctor or surgeon.
 Okay.
 Not of the interesting.
 My point is you can ask us any questions you want.
