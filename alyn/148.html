<p> I'll in an age is got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hey Jones,<br/>
 Hello sir.<br/>
 You look peculiar tonight.<br/>
 I'm wearing a winter coat.<br/>
 Well, that's not that unusual,<br/>
 giving you a cold-blooded Canadian.<br/>
 It's unusual at the end of April, however.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I got rained on a lot today.<br/>
 What is with our weather?<br/>
 The weather has been extremely rainy,<br/>
 And so I just feel damp.<br/>
 You know, you just feel cold right to your very bones.
 You're talking to somebody who is raised in Scotland.
 Yes.<br/>
 So I feel like that.<br/>
 And I haven't been able to actually get my body heat to a place where I feel okay.
 So now I'm wearing a winter coat inside.
 And you also haven't been eating.<br/>
 That's true.<br/>
 That could have something to do with it.
 That's true.<br/>
 You're giving your stomach a break.<br/>
 I am.<br/>
 It's up for debate, whether my gallbladder is doing something interesting.
 Or whether I have some sort of tummy virus or something.
 but I'm finding eating painful, so I haven't been eating very much.
 So you've been on a broth.<br/>
 That's probably making me cold too.<br/>
 Right. I would imagine.<br/>
 So I was more alluding to the fact that we're recording this podcast on a Saturday
 night, not a Sunday.<br/>
 We are.<br/>
 And that's because we've had a fairly interesting week and an incredibly busy
 weekend and tomorrow is killer busy.<br/>
 Yeah, there's no way that we'd be able to record a podcast tomorrow night.
 So we moved forward tonight.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 Let's talk about today.
</p><ul>
  <li>Today we had Abby's birthday party.
  </li><li>Our 10 year old, who turned 10 on Tuesday.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How many little children do we have at our house?
  </li><li>15, I think.
  </li><li>How long did I last at the party?
  </li><li>Oh, I think you made about a 15 minute appearance.
  </li><li>Yeah, and that was just cutting up ice cream, cake.
  </li><li>But you used your muscles for good, for God's mission.
  </li><li>There was a lot of estrogen.
  </li><li>There was.
  </li><li>Oh my Lord.
 But we were supposed to have it outside, of course.
 We were supposed to have it at a park.
  </li><li>But then we had torrential rain.
  </li><li>Torrential rain.
 So I would like to thank the makers of we for the Just Dance game because it saved my
 bacon today.
 We basically just had dance competitions for two hours.
 Which is why I pretty much was nowhere to be seen.
 Turns out though that the Just Dance competitions are much less painful than listening to karaoke.
 Yeah, we had both dancing karaoke.
 A little bit of both and the dancing much easier to tolerate.
 So there you go.
 was the penultimate week of the school.
  </li><li>It was, you know, most people don't use that word
 and so they probably don't actually realize
 that penultimate means like next to last.
  </li><li>I hope it does.
 I've been using it for years and I hope that's what it means.
 Jeff and Becky were in first year
 and me and you were in second year
 and apparently we all covered the same material.
  </li><li>Isn't that funny?
  </li><li>It was, it was my favorite week of the year this week.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yep, I loved being with the second years.
 I think because we taught a little bit
 and then we discussed a whole lot.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm like, I love that format.
 I love teaching second year anyway,
 'cause it is a smaller group,
 and you feel like you get to know them better,
 and you do get to do like that kind of open discussion stuff.
 I think that's awesome.
 Yeah.
 That was amazing.
 And then this week was just richly full of meetings
 for both work and pleasure, and we loved it.
 Yep, we got to catch up with friends
 and all that kind of stuff.
 So I feel full.
 Mm-hmm.
 And then tomorrow we have an action packed day.
 I'm looking forward to it.
 Yeah.
 realized by the end of tomorrow, we are not going to feel like podcasting.
 No, sir.
 All right.
 Our main topic for this week is a follow on from last week's topic.
 Last week's topic, if you're listening to these out of order, which I can't even
 imagine living that way, but, but I imagine there might be some people who
 listen to things unsequentially.
 Can you imagine people doing life out of sequence?
 Shocking.
 Well, no, I'm twitching the thought of it.
 But anyway, last week, we were talking about confrontation, the need for it in
 healthy relationships, how to confront, how to sit down with friends, you know, the step-by-step
 process. And we got a ton of feedback, which was really, really good. A lot of questions
 asking for some clarification. We'll go through those in a second. This week, we're going to be
 talking about the flip side of that coin, which is how to receive confrontation. Last week was
 how to do confrontation. And this week is about how to be the person that's confronted. But first,
 some follow up from last week. Joseph asked this question, "I had a question regarding halt."
 We taught on this principle about you never want to confront when you're hungry, angry, lonely, or tired.
 I've heard you all describe the acronym and what it means several times on the show,
 and was wondering if you might share some real world advice on what it looks like to apply that to your life.
 In other words, what do you do when you realize you are tired or hungry, etc?
 Do you try and fix the need first or seek the Lord or do something else entirely?
 Thank you so much.
 Yes, Joseph, we do.
 So if, if I know, for example, that I'm super hungry or I'm tired or whatever,
 I know that I'm not in the best place to, you know, bring something to Alan's
 attention or to whoever's attention that I need to confront.
 So yes, I would go and eat and let my sugar levels get back to normal.
 Or yes, I might have a little nap and then process with the Lord.
 Okay.
 You know, what part of this is me?
 What part of this is them?
 You know, what part, you know, that kind of stuff.
 So generally speaking, when you're in halt,
 it's not only your worst time to confront,
 but it's your worst time to even process
 the happenings of the day to figure out
 if confrontation is needed.
  </li><li>Right, because everything is a mountain.
 There are no molehills when you're in halt.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it's a good time if you've done your life languages
 to look at your distress flares.
 Like as high shapers, our most common reaction
 when we're distressed is to want to criticize,
 eliminate takeover.
 That's what shapers feel.
 when they're super distressed,
 they're go-to moves, criticize, eliminate, take over.
 I know if either HRI or exuding those things,
 it's not us, it's not us behaving at our best,
 and we probably need to fix some physiological things.
 One of the things I want to stress, however,
 because a lot of the questions that we got
 were not edge case scenarios,
 but like what about this, or what about that,
 and what about the next thing.
 And of course, last week and this week,
 We're talking about the optimal ways of confronting,
 but life often doesn't let you have your way.
 Like I can think of times when it is my job to confront
 and I am feeling hungry or I am tired
 and really you just have to professionalize at that point.
 You just have to recognize, oh, I'm like that
 and suck it up and go through with it.
 Now, optimally, I would prefer not to have to do that,
 but I can think of times when life just doesn't lend itself
 way, our schedules are so crazy that often we have to take the opportunities that we have.
 So again, I'm describing optimal scenarios in this teaching.
 Here's the thing, if you could carry a travel pillow and a snack with you, then you can make
 almost any moment optimal because you could eat your snack or have a little nap right before you
 can fret. It doesn't help with the anger or the loneliness. So that's true. That's true.
 You need a stress ball and a pet.
 There you go.
 We're going to start selling whole kits on lnaj.com.
 Some of the other questions that we got all were based around.
 What do you do when the power is flowing in the wrong direction?
 Because again, we're talking about as leaders, as friends, as fairly confident people who in our
 community have a lot of responsibility and authority. So a lot of the people were confronting
 are either our peers or the people that were leading. So some of the questions we got is like,
 how do you do confrontation the other way? And so I've got a question they asked if I would keep
 their name out of it. So they said, I just listened to your podcast on confrontation. It was awesome.
 How do you feel about confronting pastors? I'm part of a church plant with very sweet pastors.
 I love them. There are several things that I have left unsaid about working closely with them.
 Is it out of line to confront them? What do you think, Mrs. Jones?
 Is it out of line? No, but maybe confronting is less of the issue and maybe just presenting
 how you're experiencing them. Like maybe take the hard edge of I need to confront them off the table
 and sort of bring to them more the, "Hey guys, can I talk to you about how I'm experiencing
 you because I feel confused by X or I don't know how to process this information or this
 behavior and it doesn't feel safe to me."
 Or can I ask for some clarification on a few things?
 A friend of ours wrote in and said, "Hey, would this topic be better called giving feedback
 rather than giving confrontation?"
 And I'm like, "I think there's huge overlaps between giving feedback and confronting for
 for sure, but also when you go to the left and the right of that Venn diagram, there's
 very specific times when it's confrontation and also very specific times when it's feedback.
 My advice when confronting pastors is whenever you're confronting somebody in the powers
 going the other way, like you're confronting a boss, a supervisor, a pastor, a leader,
 a parent, whatever, you really want to increase the grace and the humility that you're carrying.
 I have to chant to myself, I'm not my dumbest when I think I know the motives of another
 person's heart because usually we think we know what's going on in their mind or in their
 world and we really haven't.
 So what that looks like practically is ensuring I have removed all unforgiveness about the
 issue I may be going to confront that the sting has gone.
 Or judgment of previous leaders because we'll tend to put those on the people that we're
 looking at the present.
 Explain that dynamic.
 Well, you know, when you judge anybody, like if you judge a leader, then often you're
 going to reap the same behavior from other leaders.
 So it's really good to sort of sit back and go, "Hey, Lord, have I judged other leaders
 about this particular issue and repent and work that through first?"
 To see if it's more of a filter, because often what happens is we experience something that
 It looks like this similar experience, but the motivation isn't the same.
 But because of previous experience with other leaders, we think we understand the motivation
 of our current leader's heart.
 And that's not necessarily true.
 So it's just good to sort of have a discussion with the Holy Spirit and say, is there anything
 of judgment in here, Lord?
 Is there anything that actually is my part to deal with?
 Am I defiling them in any way?
 And have I assumed that I know what's going on in their hearts?
  </li><li>Yeah, I would hope that all pastors,
 and to another degree, all bosses and leaders
 would want feedback.
 I'm aware that that's not the case.
 I've worked for bosses where they are not open
 to feedback at all.
 And thankfully, you know, at Grayson,
 we've got amazing leaders, Jeff and Becky,
 are absolutely open to receiving feedback.
 And even in the culture that we were a part of,
 which is very pro confrontation,
 that confrontation is not a bad thing.
 I'm thrilled when our leaders sit down.
 I feel very safe when our leaders are like,
 hey, could I meet with you?
 And I'm like, sure.
 And we sit down and they're like, hey, last Tuesday,
 I felt slighted when you said this.
 And I know that you would wanna know about it.
 And so could we just talk about that?
 And usually I'm like, I am.
 It's an off the cuff remark that I've made
 or I haven't been aware of my tone.
 And they've done a great job.
 They've got like 80% of the way in their heart of realizing what I'm believing about Allen's
 behavior is not true to what I know about Allen, but I can't reconcile this last 20%.
 It's great because it gives me a chance to clear the air and go, "Oh, guys, I had no
 clue that that was the effect.
 Would you forgive me?"
 It's a rewarding experience for everybody.
 It's also the only way that we get to...
 It's not the only way we get to grow as leaders, I suppose, but it's one of the primary ones
 when you can actually hear back from somebody about their experience of you and be able to go,
 wow, that's not what I thought I was doing. That's not what I thought I was conveying.
 So there's something that I can learn in that. And again, take to the Lord and say,
 God, can you help me with this? But here's the thing, even with our amazing culture,
 and even though I'd say that we're fairly well experienced in confrontation,
 in the times that we've had to confront our leaders, when I say confront, but bring
 something to their attention, it's still hard.
 It's hard.
 It requires a lot of prayer because you're like, "What if this goes all squarely and they
 misunderstand my heart?"
 But I think that's the risk reward.
 We have a much stronger relationship with Jeff and Becky today because we've risked asking
 for clarification or risked.
 Jeff's so good.
 He'll come and say, "Hey, did I overstep a line?"
 I mean, he's so sensitive and so open to feedback.
  </li><li>But he'll also confront us,
 which also makes the relationship safe.
  </li><li>Very safe.
  </li><li>So it's great, 'cause I think as long as you know
 that the other person can be honest with you
 and you can be honest with them,
 then actually it's a safe relationship,
 even if confrontation is happening on a regular basis.
  </li><li>Right, so let's just summarize.
 If you're gonna confront somebody
 who's in a different authority structure than you are,
 My encouragement is to do with tremendous grace, tremendous tact, tremendous diplomacy.
 Learn our life language, if that's applicable.
 Speak through their filter, speak to their heart.
 Talk about how you're experiencing their behavior.
 Ask us as another way of doing it.
 But please be aware, not everybody has an amazing boss who wants to know these things.
 So there is an element where you want to tread carefully and calculate the risk and the reward
 because you are part of the equation.
 And so you do get a say in how the culture is built.
 So I hope that's helpful.
 Another question that we got asked a lot was, what do you do with low relational equity?
 So in your relationships, friendships, work relationships, where there isn't a lot
 of relational or emotional equity.
 And you have to bring confrontation, you mean?
 You feel like you need to bring something up.
 Well, I think that leads back to what Charlene had shared with us via email.
 Yeah, our friend Charlene, who God bless her, has worked with us for many years.
 She had listened to the podcast and in her role at the moment, she does an awful lot
 of training with leaders.
 So Charlene said this and I'm reading from the email that she sent me.
 She said, "In my new role, I've been learning a lot about the concept of feedback.
 We teach a framework called SBI situation behavior impact and we actively encourage managers
 and leaders to create a culture of feedback. By catching people doing things right and
 taking the time to quickly remind them of the situation, which is the time and place,
 their behavior, what they specifically did, and how it impacted you. This is the feeling
 part of this action. We find if we're doing this on a regular basis, we're pouring in
 real, relevant, positive feedback. So when we need to use the same framework to help give
 more corrective feedback, there's already a lot of trust which has built a high level
 of relationship.
 I think that's brilliant.
 I think again, goes back to if you're creating a culture where you're giving positive feedback
 as well as criticism, nobody panics when you're like, "Hey, I need to meet with you at two
 tomorrow."
 People are like, "What's going to happen?"
 Right.
 I remember when I used to react like that, like if John or somebody was like, "Hey, could
 you meet me tomorrow too?"
 I'm like, "Gosh, could you just bring it on me four minutes before?
 I don't spend three days sweating it out, waiting to see what it is that I'm meeting
 with you about, kind of stuff.
 The more trust that you build in a relationship, the less that you have that.
 I'm not sure if I said it last week or not, but it sums up what Charlene was sharing in
 quite a quaint way.
 It says, "Can't drive a five-ton truck of correction over a three-ton bridge of relationship."
 I like that.
 I think that's great.
 It comes back to what we were saying before that again, that's the ideal goal.
 But again, life does not always set you up well.
 And that's where that metaphor breaks down.
 I've seen people over the years use that excuse to excuse themselves from confronting.
 You know, so I'll meet with my leader and say, Hey, this is something one of the things
 that you need to go confront.
 And then they say, Okay, I'm going to set up a meeting with that person.
 And I say, Oh, how did it go?
 And they're like, Oh, I just, I just feel like I didn't have enough relational equity
 to do so.
 And so at some point, I think, you know, while we're wanting the best case scenario, we do
 have to realize that we are actually grownups and at some point we just have to get on with
 boldness and of course with tremendous humility confront one another in love.
 Yeah.
 And I think too, like sometimes when you're confronting, you're confronting because there's
 an urgency in the behavior and what you believe will result from that.
 And that would be like, I don't assess if I see you about to drive off a cliff.
 if I have enough relational equity to tell you it's a cliff,
 I'm gonna tell you, hey, you know what,
 you're heading in the wrong direction and that's a cliff
 and we can talk about whether it hurt your feelings later
 that I mentioned that to you, but for right now,
 I just want you to be safe.
  </li><li>Right, which that message of I care about you
 doesn't always come through in the lens of confrontation,
 does it? - No.
  </li><li>It used to be followed up. - Yeah.
  </li><li>But again, the whole reason for this is not,
 you're a bad boy or you did something wrong,
 It's like, this is unto greater health.
 I love you and so I want to bring to light something
 I feel like is either hurting you or our relationship.
  </li><li>Right. - I value you.
  </li><li>Right. - Or I value our relationship,
 or I value our working environment enough
 to risk the relationship we have for something better.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Which brings us to the topic of this week,
 which is how to be confronted well.
 Like how do you do a good job of being the person
 on the other side of the table, so to speak,
 who's receiving the confrontation.
  </li><li>So we have four pieces of advice for you.
  </li><li>All right, let me with number one.
  </li><li>Number one is suck it up, suck it up.
 And it really does need more definition than that.
 Just take it, just sit there, listen and take it.
  </li><li>And again, remember, you're wanting this.
 It's free research, you absolutely want this.
 And I think it's important that you have to give people
 brace to be able to do it.
 And they might not do it brilliantly,
 but tell yourself, this is gonna be over shortly,
 I can lower the anxiety by responding really, really well.
 So just brace yourself.
  </li><li>While you're sucking it up,
 don't spend the whole time lawyering up
 about why it should have been done differently
 or it could have been done differently.
 Hear the feedback because that's the point.
 Somebody's been brave enough to come and talk to you
 about how they're experiencing you, suck it up.
 And if you find yourself going to the back of your brain,
 which means you just wanna tip the table over and storm out
 and get in the list of, oh yeah.
 Try and just come to the front of your brain,
 just think about something that you so appreciate
 about this person or about this relationship.
 Call to mind that thing.
 But again, remind yourself, like,
 actually this is gonna be okay, this is gonna be okay.
 So first one, suck it up.
 Number two. - Number two, go for it.
  </li><li>And just listen.
 It's very similar to number one,
 But people know that you're listening by seeing your eyes,
 by seeing a smile on your face,
 by seeing some nodding,
 literally hold your breath,
 listen to what the person is saying,
 realize, give them tremendous grace,
 realize how hard it's been for you
 when you've had to confront people.
 If you're in a position of authority,
 and this is one of your workers coming to,
 if this is one of your employees coming to you
 or one of your leaders coming to you
 as you in a leadership position,
 you have to extend enormous grace.
 They're being very, very bold.
 And if they've got no practice at it, which is common,
 they might be anxious.
 And this might be the worst delivery mechanism ever,
 but just listen, look for the gold
 in what they're trying to say.
 My encouragement, and I've gotten to trouble with this
 in the past is be really careful with questions.
 Sometimes I'm asking for questions
 for clarification, but it sounds like I'm asking questions to be defensive.
 Right.
 So receive what they're saying with kindness because they could be right.
 Don't try to value it whether they're right at this moment.
 Just let them get the revelation to you.
 So number one, suck it up.
 Number two, listen, what's number three?
 Number three is basically write stuff down.
 If it's if it's appropriate and you can ask, hey, I really want to make sure
 that I get what you're saying and that I can take it away and process what you're saying.
 Would it be okay if I write it down so that I can have an accurate record of what you said?
 And also, you know, just as somebody who has been confronted before by people, if you can
 write down exactly what the main thing is that you're being confronted by, then you
 can actually even go and talk to some of your close friends and that kind of stuff and say,
 Hey, have you experienced this in me
 and give them the freedom to tell you the truth?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But if you've written it down,
 then you can literally say,
 "Hey, somebody talked to me this week about this.
 "Have you experienced that with me?
 "Have you seen me do that or whatever?"
 And again, it's free research,
 but it just helps if you can write it down,
 even if you can repeat it to them.
 So what I'm hearing you say is,
 your experience of me is this.
 Thank you very much.
 so that you can now take that and start to process that with the Lord.
 The other thing it does is writing, writing things down gives your brain something to do.
 Like if you're feeling anxious, scared, attacked, whatever, writing things down redirects a lot of that nervous energy.
 And you're giving yourself a task to do is not that you're disengaging.
 Rather, it's helping you train your thoughts and focus.
 Last thing, baby.
 The last thing.
 Your job is not to respond, it is to receive.
 So you can respond later.
 Right.
 So you don't have to have a formulated defense.
 You don't have to.
 You can literally just say, wow.
 OK, I'd love to take some time to process this and you can set up a future
 time to, you know, whatever, apologize to work it through.
 But right now you're just receiving.
 you're not responding and you're not defending.
 The one exception to that is if if it's an obvious oversight and you're not being
 triggered by it, if you're like, Oh my gosh, I can totally see how you would come to
 that conclusion.
 Can I let you in on the behind the scenes?
 Like if it's something you can fix in about two minutes by all means you schedule
 and other meetings and just be like, I am so sorry.
 I've actually been feeling terrible.
 But you know, whatever it is, if if you know what the person needs or if you know
 what you need to do, i.e. repent, apologize, fix. By all means go ahead and do that. We're
 really putting number four, the whole thing about your job is not to respond, but to receive.
 If you're in that state of like, Oh my gosh, do you know the totally blindsided me with this
 competition? This person's attacking me. It's horrible.
 Well, let's talk about that blindsided feeling we get because when I've reflected on the
 times that we've been confronted and we've been confronted a lot, which is great. I've
 thought about the times that it feels really hard, I can break into three fairly distinct
 feelings. The first big feeling is when you feel like you're being attacked.
 And the danger with that is what we want to do is, like you say, lawyer up and either
 point out why their attack is not valid. Here's what makes use for why what you're saying isn't
 real or attack them back. Here's the thing though, you have to commend them for their bravery.
 If you've been feeling that they do the very same thing and you've never confronted it,
 you need to give them credit for actually confronting you first.
 Yeah, for sure. For sure.
 And don't be the person who's like, "Oh yeah, well, you do. That's just not going to help. Let them
 let them have the win. You can process it later." So feeling attacked is...
 But I tell you what, I've been in the room with some of my heroes when they've been feeling attacked
 and watching them just close their mouth and let it wash over them is one of the most remarkable
 things I've seen human beings do. Yeah. Number two, under, you know, basically why it's so hard,
 is often we feel like our motives are being questioned as opposed to our behavior is being
 challenged. That's a huge one. Yeah, because nobody likes to feel misunderstood. Nobody
 likes to feel like, but what you're saying is that there's something intrinsically wrong
 with me.
 Right.
 As opposed to, this is how your behavior affected me.
 Right.
 And but we don't hear that.
 We hear you hate me and you wish I was never born.
 So it's like deescalating all those feelings again.
 Yes.
 And then number three.
 Oh, it's number three is, I kind of mentioned this in number one, you feel like you need
 to confront back.
 You know, when they're saying to you, hey, I need to talk to you about X and you're
 like, "Are you kidding me? You're the king of X. Like, what are you going to run?"
 Just like, "No, let it go. Smile. Say thank you."
 I love what Mike Bickle said. Mike Bickle said,
 "He used to give $5 to everybody who gave him negative feedback."
 But he said, "It blew up in my face because people thought I was mocking them or being
 funny, but I was genuinely grateful that I was getting free research."
 So in summary, be a person who is open to feedback.
 If you're feeling brave, solicit it,
 go to your trusted friends and say,
 hey, I'm trying to do some self-improvement.
 Could you tell me how you experienced me?
 All right, and then follow our one, two, three, four,
 suck it up, literally just told you breath.
 If it's appropriate, write stuff down.
 And number four, don't respond.
 If you practice the skill of making other people
 feel safe in your environment,
 you will find an increased ability to not only give confrontation slash feedback, but also receive it in a really healthy way.
 It's undoubtedly true, babe, that we are better leaders, better spouses and better friends because we have yielded not always and not always gracefully to the feedback that we've received.
 True.
 Listen, if you have other questions about this topic, we'd love to hear them.
 We'd love when we get listened to feedback.
 You can ask us questions at Allen and AJ.com/askallen spell a L Y N.
 If you want to give us feedback, anything that you've noticed, anything you would
 like more information about, you can go to Allen and AJ.com/feedback.
 And lastly, one of the greatest things you can do for us is leaving us a positive
 review on the Apple podcast directory, previously known as the iTunes podcast
 directory, but they changed it this week. To do that, go to alan and AJ.com/review and
 it will automatically redirect you to the relevant page at Apple.
 As ever, show notes are available at alan and AJ.com/148.
 We hope you have an amazing week filled with relational health and we will be back this
 time next week with an incredible podcast with some special guests.
 Yep. See you.

 Paleotronuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
 From Franklin to Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
 (gentle music)
 (buzzing)
