<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 -A.G. Jones. -Yes.<br/>
 -Welcome to episode 270 of "The Joneses." -To 70.
 -How are you? -Cool.<br/>
 -Are you wearing new earrings? -They're not new.
 Sarah Jackson bought them for me like a year ago.
 I just don't wear them often, and I saw them and I went,
 "Oh, I don't wear nose yet." -Give me your weekly update.
 What has happened since the last time we were with
 these fine folks. Oh my goodness. Well, I think everything is overshadowed by at the moment,
 we are waiting to hear back from a mom who's looking at a bunch of profiles about who she would
 love to have adopt her child. It's always that we'll talk tell us during a second just caveat.
 It's always interesting podcasting because sometimes when we're podcasting, we're aware that what we're
 saying is out of date. We're recording this on a Saturday. It's going to be released in two days.
 Normally we don't normally release our podcast way ahead of our recorder podcast the way ahead of
 time. So we're releasing this Saturday. It will come out Monday. We've known about this for about a
 week. Yeah. Came out about last week. Yep. And here's my head and say like we're sharing this
 because we want to share it. But potentially about the time you listen to this, things could
 have changed. Well, I don't think so because we're not really supposed to hear anything back until
 like Tuesday.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, but people might not listen to this episode.
  </li><li>Oh, that's true.
  </li><li>Looking at the stats, there's a hardcore population
 who listen to it Monday as soon as it comes out.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then there's like the slow tale of Tuesday
 when the 30th Friday.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, so it really could have changed
 by the time you listened to it.
  </li><li>And the way to know what's happening
 if you wanna follow our adoption journey in all
 but real time, like you know about half an hour after
 we know is to join our adoption newsletter
 at alanag.com/adopt.
 But tell us where we're at and how we got to where we are.
 Well, about a week and a half ago, there was a posting that we could respond to.
 So we were like, oh, so we prayed about that for about four or five days.
 And then had a conversation with the adoption agency.
 Yep.
 This particular child's in Utah.
 And so we were talking to them.
 And at the end of that phone call, we said, yes, we would love to be
 submitted, to be considered by this mom.
 And not to be pernicious, but you said child.
 This is going to be a baby born at the end of March.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So it will be a child, but it will be a baby.
  </li><li>Yes, a baby that's being born at the end of March.
  </li><li>And this mom was being presented
 with many families to choose from.
  </li><li>Yes, so many families.
  </li><li>So she has about a week where one of the families
 that is being considered.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so what that means is potentially
 by the time you've heard this,
 maybe the mom picked somebody else,
 but maybe the mom picked us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we have to, we're just waiting.
  </li><li>We're just waiting.
  </li><li>We're just waiting.
  </li><li>So what does that do to your brain?
 Where have you been headspace?
  </li><li>Oh, I've been a whole bunch of different places.
 So I think I decided, well, first of all,
 once we were like, yes, we're in.
 The next day, I felt like I got hit by the tired stick.
 'Cause I think I spent five or six days like,
 "Are we gonna, are we not, are we gonna, are we not,
 we are!"
 And then the next day I was like,
 "Crash, you know, so tired."
 But also I've been in this spot of like two different places.
 One, I want to live like I used to live as in
 batten down the hatches.
  </li><li>Don't get excited.
  </li><li>Don't get excited.
 Then you can't be disappointed, you know,
 all that kind of stuff.
 And then I started thinking like,
 but if she does choose us,
 I want to have enjoyed the excitement of this week
 and all the emotions that come along with it.
 And I want to actually always be choosing a healthier way
 of processing things than I used to.
  </li><li>Look at you in your therapy.
  </li><li>I know, so I was like, no, I think I'm gonna choose
 to feel whatever I feel, deal with those feelings
 in the moment, you know, like, so I have felt excited,
 I have felt fear, mostly like fear that she won't choose us,
 but then I'm like, and she really might not.
 I'm like, "What's the statistics when 15 families
 are being presented?"
 And I'm like, "That's not gonna help me."
 So I'm just like, "Oh, okay, well God,
 this was your idea to begin with."
 And if this is our baby, then she will choose us.
 So I'm sort of, you know, right now,
 I feel peacefully excited.
  </li><li>We were talking about this the other day.
 I mean, you went out on a date
 and we were just talking and kind of catching up where we're at.
 And I thought, the beautiful thing about adoption
 Is it forces you forces you the wrong word?
 It very clearly brings into focus your powerlessness.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And at the same time illustrates
 what little control that you have period,
 but what illusion of control you settled for
 when you were having biological children.
 So what I mean by that is like on hindsight
 when we look back at the three kids we had,
 we had no power about when you would conceive.
  </li><li>No.
 power when you would deliver. No. We had no power over whether those children would be
 healthy or not. Right. And we had no power over how they will turn out. Yeah. We could
 influence all of those things, but really no power. But what's curious is in adoption,
 your face to face with just how powerless you are. Well, and it's also the timeline
 is totally different. Like with your biological children, when you do eventually find out,
 Oh, I'm pregnant. You have a nine month process to get used to that and to get ready. We're not going to have that. I mean, you know, being as most agencies are pairing in the third trimester.
 Yeah, you don't you're going to have a much smaller amount of time. And so I think there's that too. Like in the back of my head, I'm like, Oh my gosh, like whether it is this baby or another baby.
 It's like hurry up and wait.
 Like it's wait, wait, wait.
 Oh, they chose us.
 Oh my goodness, we have so much to get ready.
 You know, so yeah.
 The other thing that we are very aware of is if they choose us,
 we have to, how much is this particular baby?
 This sounds so crass that even discusses.
 Well, these are $62,000.
 Just the fees.
 So not the cost of traveling there.
 Yeah.
 Or going out to stay or having to stay there for two weeks.
 hour and of the lawyer's fees. None of that's included.
 So it's 62,000. Right now we have about 35,000.
 Yes.
 So we're acutely aware that, oh, if this is the baby, we have to do some rapid fundraising.
 Yes.
 And super nice of a revision.
 And that doesn't include all the other things like, we'll need a crib, a car seat.
 You know, it was funny. I was talking to a friend of mine on the
 Facebook yesterday and not Facebook. What's it called? FaceTime and
 And she was saying well, you know, you probably have people in your community that would lend you those things and I was like
 He acts if we can't do that because of the home study
 So right the home study requires that we have new not used
 Yes, or we had to have them here when the home study was done and approved for her to approve each item
 So because we didn't we actually anything with a safety rating we have to get new hmm
 We do have a however as of today, we do have a nursery a pre-painted nursery that's ready.
 Well, it's not painted.
 That's why I said pre-painted.
 Oh, pre-painted.
 Okay, I got you.
 It's just what we have is a clean and clean empty room, basically.
 Well, the bedroom that Abby was occupying, but she's moved bedrooms and other things.
 We ousted the teenager from that bedroom.
 So yes, we could get space ready for said child.
 So we're in a world of...
  </li><li>Vah-vah-vah.
  </li><li>And yeah, and it literally feels like,
 what I'm doing is making like go lists.
  </li><li>Like our making go lists like a boss.
  </li><li>Like so whenever the mom picks us,
 whether it's this mom or not,
 we will need to get the following things sorted.
  </li><li>Sorted.
 And then I'm doing any research I can ahead of time
 so we know what the things are that we need.
  </li><li>This ladies and gentlemen is a shaper.
 This is a shaper trying to shape when you can't shape.
 Yeah, so I'm doing all of those kinds of things.
  </li><li>If you would like to follow along with this journey
 in a more on time than like a weekly podcast,
 like I said, go to lnager.com/adopt,
 we can sign up for our newsletter.
 The people on our newsletter knew about this situation
 literally within about 20 minutes of us knowing
 about the situation,
 'cause we love people praying for us in the journey.
 If you would like to help us with the financial cost of it,
 If you go to lnager.com/adoptthere,
 there's two different ways you can give.
 If you would like a US tax receipt,
 you can give the life song for adoptions.
 If you don't care about that,
 or if you're outside of the US dynamics,
 zero difference to you,
 you can also give via our GoFundMe account.
  </li><li>But both links are on that page,
 so it's easy to do, yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, so that's the week overshadowed with that thing.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>What else happened this week,
 in the midst of waiting for the news
 about whether a mom can do this?
  </li><li>I can't remember.
 I mean, you taught Romans.
 Yes, I taught verse by verse through the first seven chapters
 of Romans with Richard.
 And we'll finish that this coming week.
 That was in our school with our year two.
 Yeah.
 You love the whole verse by verse.
 I love it because I think when you speed read any
 of the letters, you miss so much of the content that's there.
 And particularly with Romans,
 like it's such a deep dive if you're willing to take it.
 And it's a great magnifying glass to examine your own heart.
 So I love Romans.
 Yeah.
 It's really good.
 You taught that.
 I taught last week the second part of my series on blessings.
 Yeah.
 And tomorrow I teach the third part of my message on blessings.
 Yeah.
 That's so much fun.
 Neither say it.
 That's so much fun.
 Yeah.
 And then this week, I was thinking about this week.
 This week was all meetings, which can sound down.
 But it wasn't.
 I was meeting with glorious people.
 And I had a great week in terms of,
 like I love teaching obviously,
 but I also love strategy and problem solving.
 And that's what our week was largely was.
  </li><li>That kind of thing.
  </li><li>Yep, we had a date, but that's not that exciting.
 I mean, it was, it's not like we didn't eat somebody.
  </li><li>We didn't eat somebody.
  </li><li>We didn't eat somebody.
 We didn't eat somewhere in that.
  </li><li>That would've been exciting to talk about.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>In other news, the Joneses and Cannibals.
 Yes, no.
  </li><li>The adoption update is interesting, everything.
 But I'm sure everybody's interested in
 on an update. What's wrong?
 There's, um, kale sliding down your front teeth somehow.
 I've been eating seaweed. That's what it is. Seaweed.
 I was like, what is happening right now?
 So, I mean, I know everybody's interested in the adoption,
 but what they're really interested in is how did the 50 hour sous vide brisket go?
 I was disappointed. Me too.
 But here's the thing like to be fair the texture was a divine oh the textures amazing. It's like it's like a fork through butter
 I mean it's divine the flavor was just not good. I think in part because we don't have a smoker
 Yeah, so we had a really nice robin the robin the bark. Yeah tasted great. Yeah, but as soon as you got past that you were like
 Which is why on our day we were researching smokers
 Dedicated to me dedicated to me
 Valentine's Day coming up and I was asking to age you what she wants to do for a date and she doesn't want a date
 She wants a smoker for a Valentine's Day. That's right. I was like no no we don't want to smoke her
 We want a second subwoofer and I was like no I really don't want a second subwoofer. I want to pray for her
 We get a smoker speaking of teeth
 I realized the major faux pas AJ was just like hey, what's going on with our orthodontists like they haven't they
 I haven't called or checked up and I don't know when the last time was our kids saw and so called me an appointment and we got an emergency appointment that day just to see where Abby is and I'm the way and I was like yeah why haven't they and then I have this like misty thought go through the fog of my memory and I remember they called about a year and a half ago and said hey your child's do for North Donna's appointment I was like yeah what was COVID and everything we're just going to leave it for a bit we'll call you so it wasn't
 them. It wasn't us. It was you. Okay. It was totally me. So that was kind of embarrassing.
 So we're rapidly getting our kids back into the orthodontist. But that was our week. It
 was overshadowed by adoption. Yeah. We had semi-good meets, but not really. Yeah.
 Age of wants a smoker. I want to subwoofer. And there you go. And there we go. And, you know,
 for the rest of the podcast, I'm going to try and stay in the room. Because you're leaving
 in your hands. Yes, I'm leaving in my head to like baby items. Okay. Yeah. I checked my
 email a lot to see if they've replied. I know I'm gonna reply on a Saturday. Yeah, I don't know.
 I guess they'll reply whenever she's decided. But all right, our main topic for this week. Yes.
 Continue. Like last week, we're talking about money. We were talking about our childhood experiences
 with money. We're talking about the ungodly beliefs we grew up with about money. We're talking about
 how that kind of got rewired when we came to the church. This week, I want to talk about
 Tithing. I've titled this honestly. I had so much fun thinking about like real clickbait titles, like, you know, why most churches are wrong about
 Tithing or you've been taught wrong about Tithing and I just don't have it in me to be manipulative.
 Basically, with this clickbait title. So I've titled it somewhat, anemically, the truth about Tithing. But one of the things we're going to preach on tomorrow
 is the revelation I've had as I've been preparing it,
 in that we weren't taught the truth about tithing.
 Okay.
 And I would argue that most people in most churches
 don't know the truth about tithing because
 tithing has made up of three components,
 and generally speaking, my whole life,
 I've only ever heard about one of those things.
 Hello.
 This is exciting.
 Right.
 So, okay, I'm ready.
 The component that everybody knows about tithing,
 which isn't enough is tithing would be what?
 Giving 10%.
 Right, that's the thing.
 That's the thing that the church focuses on, you give 10%.
 And that's the what, but they don't really tend to emphasize the where,
 and they don't tend to emphasize the when.
 You're looking blankly at me.
 Remember, I don't know how long ago.
 Like, we're at church.
 When they passed the bucket.
 Number of years ago, I was having lunch with our friend Lyle Phillips.
 So Lyle and his dear wife, Alison, passed her a church here in Nashville called Legacy.
 Super energetic, super fun. Lyle comes and speaks to our church and we had lunch with them a couple of weeks ago.
 But this story happens a few years ago. I'm meeting with Lyle for lunch and Lyle is high.
 I don't mean high on drugs. I mean just field of passion because he's been reading this book
 which I love and if you have not read this book,
 probably pause what you're doing right now
 and just go by it.
 It's called The Blessed Life by Robert Morris.
 An amazing book.
 Anyway, Lyle has read this book and he's come to me
 and he's filled with passion, he's filled with testimonies
 and he's talking to me all about, you know,
 tithing and blessing and extravagance and outrageousness.
 And Lyle's got this revelation about first fruits, right?
 And so I'm listening to Lyle and he's talking about,
 it's not enough that we give 10%.
 It's also important when we give our 10%.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'm like, what do you mean when we give our 10%?
 And so he's talking about the whole thing of like,
 you need to bring your tithe immediately.
 It's like the first thing.
 So I'm listening to him and you know,
 I appreciate his passion and, but in my heart,
 I'm like, well, hang on, what he's saying?
 I'm running straight into the practical reality
 of the way we tithe.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Which was we get paid like many people in America
 on the first and the 15th of each month.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so what we would do is because on the first,
 all of our big expenses came out.
  </li><li>Yeah, there was no wiggle room.
  </li><li>Like our mortgage and our car payment and our car insurance,
 like the big heavy hitter responsibilities
 is when we looked at what we had to pay for,
 we didn't have enough money to tie on the first,
 no problem on the 15th on that paycheck.
  </li><li>You do the whole month's time.
  </li><li>We would tie on the first and on the 15th.
 And in my head, I'm thinking, like in terms of each month,
 God's getting all his money.
 So, Lyall's telling me about how important it is to tithe,
 you know, immediately.
 And I said, well, Lyall, like,
 I'm just thinking about what you're saying
 and I explain that to him.
 And I was like, so are you telling me I'm not tithing?
 He says, not according to the Bible.
 And I was like, but God still gets his money.
 On the 15th, like, I don't think you understand, Lyall.
 God still gets all of his money for February on February 15th.
 And he said, yeah, but for the first to the 14th,
 you're keeping his money in your pocket.
 And I was like, no, no, no, but he still gets all the money.
  </li><li>No, there's nothing left in our pocket, Lyle.
  </li><li>And Lyle looked at me and he says,
 "Ellen, how much faith does it take to pay God last?"
  </li><li>Oh, harsh.
  </li><li>So I punched him.
 No, I didn't.
 I was like...
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Well, I don't think I was okay.
 Yeah, I think I was just like,
 oh, he's been a bit religious.
 Because, you know, when all is said and done,
 each month God has his money.
 But he was just like, no, no, it needs to be first.
 Well, what he said didn't leave me.
 And I remember coming home and I remember telling you,
 and I probably had a pee in my bonnet about it.
 Listen what I said, I'm running a little bit.
 And what do you think, I'm running a little bit.
  </li><li>And it has like our budgeting software
 says something different.
  </li><li>But I just thought, and I think we talked about this as,
 what if the reason that I think I can't afford to tithe
 is because I'm not tithing properly.
 Because the famous passage in Malachi says that,
 if you tithe, bring the whole tithe in this class.
 See if I will not open the floodgates of heaven.
 And I was like, okay.
 And the last point was like,
 I appreciate that you're giving God his money,
 but you're not actually exercising faith.
 So we talked about it.
 Do you remember this?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we were like, oh, okay.
 Let's let I think I'm convicted by it and the conviction was slow.
 It took a couple of hours, but it was that same day.
 You and I decided, okay, for the rest of our lives, what we're going to do is as
 soon as any money comes our way, we're going to tithe on it immediately.
 And that means our next paycheck is coming coming up on the first and we're
 going to decide to give our tithe.
 But that also means we can't pay our mortgage.
 It also means we can't pay these things, but we're going to trust God.
 And I remember thinking, is this wise?
 Yeah.
 And I remember the Holy Spirit saying, is it, are you asking if it's wise to trust God?
 And I was like, okay, I realize that's a silly question.
 So we decided to, and I don't remember what day it was, but we had a couple of, we had, uh, maybe a week or so, maybe 10 days, something like that before that was going to happen.
 The day that we decided, the very next day,
 we got a random check for $20,000.
  </li><li>We did?
  </li><li>We did, you don't remember that.
  </li><li>I don't remember this.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause I remember calling Lyle
 and just saying Lyle, you're sitting down,
 you're not gonna believe this.
 And I told him, hey, man, our conversation--
  </li><li>Yes, we do.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>It's so, it's so struck me,
 Agent and I came home, we made this covenant,
 we're gonna do this, and guess what happened?
 He's like, what?
 I said, we haven't even implemented it yet,
 we just decided we're gonna do it,
 We got checked for $20,000.
  </li><li>I remember that.
  </li><li>He was so excited and he was hollering.
 And I would say that when we learned
 to bring the tithe immediately,
 that was one of the watershed moments in our life
 when our finances changed.
 'Cause the truth is we had been tithers,
 what I now call, we'd been givers of 10%,
 our whole married life,
 but we hadn't seen financial breakthrough
 for most of our married life.
 We saw pockets of it, but we didn't see a consistent change in our finances until we
 did that.
 I remember that.
 That stands out as a watershed moment in our finances with Tizing.
 Not just the amount, but the way.
 Yeah.
 Well, I was thinking about, as you're saying that, I'm thinking about other moments for
 us in terms of risking it with that.
 Do you remember when we lived at at the first house that we lived in I do oh, I know what story you're gonna
 Tell and we started and we decided we wanted to start tithing 11% instead of 10. Yes
 like financially
 That was so hard like that was like one of those like we want to do this
 Do you remember where the impetus came from?
 for doing that I
 I
 Don't other than I just remember you wanting to to like up the ante a little bit like you know
 I don't like we were comfortable. No, no, I remember doing it
 I don't remember why we did it. I don't remember if it was a testimony or a story or a challenge or I don't remember
 I don't remember but I remember like we were looking for like we we were still using like folding chairs and stuff in our house
 And we were looking for like barstools and we are using upside down cardboard boxes
 as bad side tables.
  </li><li>Well, we did that until last year.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>We didn't.
  </li><li>Oh, two years ago.
  </li><li>I beg your pardon, darling.
 I could correct you.
 We graduated from upside down folding--
  </li><li>Oh, TV tables.
  </li><li>TV dinner tables.
  </li><li>Yeah, TV dinner tables.
 Until last year.
 But anyway.
  </li><li>Yeah, we had folding chairs.
  </li><li>Yeah, we had folding chairs.
 And we did have somebody living with us
 that had couches, remember they were moving.
 And so the couches were gonna disappear.
 And then you're like, I think we should tie the 11%.
 And I was like, okay.
  </li><li>But I remember the Saturday night
 before we decided to give the 11%.
 The Saturday night, you and I were doing one
 of our famous dates, which is where you would wander around
 furniture stores or bed, bathroom, beyond our IKEA or whatever
 and just dream.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We did so many of those dates.
  </li><li>We did tons of them.
  </li><li>We would just hold hands and we'd wander around
 and we'd pretend we had money to buy things.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we'd looked at bar stools that night.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And then the next day, a neighbor that we didn't actually know
 that was moving.
  </li><li>Hit a two never spoken to.
  </li><li>Yeah, thanks.
  </li><li>We dropped off groceries at their house
 the first day they moved in, and two years later.
  </li><li>And they never, yeah, we never--
  </li><li>We had never seen them.
 They knock on our door.
  </li><li>Yeah, they knock on our door,
 and they're like, hey, we're moving.
 We have a bunch of things that we don't wanna move with us.
 Do you wanna let us know if you want any of these things?
 And so we go over and they have bar stools,
 they have two couches, and a trampoline very good.
  </li><li>A gigantic trampoline.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And we were like, I mean, wow, you know, so it just we just all of a sudden just felt like,
 Oh, this is like a windfall of all the things that we were like, Lord, we need this, you know,
 and we don't know. We don't have any way of actually getting it in the natural.
 That was a that was on the watershed moment where we learned to
 give if it's so to speak above and beyond the tithe because I think my history and I don't want
 to blame my Scottish culture or my upbringing, you know, one hot chocolate five straws.
 And but but I remember probably my relationship with the tithe was the tithe was a ticket of entry
 to the kingdom of God. But don't you dare ask for the other 90%. Right. Like like you can have
 I don't have a 10% because I was raised well.
 Like that's yours, but the 90% is my dongy-dare ask.
 And I remember being confident
 when there would be a conferences
 and there'd be an offering.
 I just remember being completely resolute
 that I don't need to give--
  </li><li>'Cause I've already tived.
  </li><li>'Cause I've already tived.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And didn't have a revelation of ties and offerings,
 which we'll talk about in another episode.
 But I think that kind of nudging the needle passed to 10%.
 I just thought it was so funny that the night before,
 those were the things we were dreaming about
 and the next day, 'cause it was Sunday afternoon,
 like we'd gone to church, we'd given 11% on our ties,
 we didn't give, yes, we ties 10% given what we were.
  </li><li>We returned, yes.
 And then it was that afternoon, they knocked on the door
 and I was like, "Are you, like that is the craziest thing ever?"
 That's the war and that's the when,
 the where seems to have debate in the church.
  </li><li>Okay, where do you--
  </li><li>Oh, the where?
  </li><li>Where do we-- - Where do we--
  </li><li>Yeah, where do we-- - Where do we--
  </li><li>Where do we give it?
  </li><li>Where do we give it?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Where do we give it?
  </li><li>Well, we give it to church.
 We give it to our church that we go to.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I've met, and you probably have to,
 lots of people who say,
 "Well, I tithe, I tithe."
 And they do, but they're like,
 "I give a little bit here and a little bit there
 and I support my missionary friends and I do this
 and I give some to the church."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'm like, "Uh..."
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But, biblically, I think it goes to the church.
  </li><li>Biblically goes to the church
 and all those other people would come out
 giving, like, right. Yeah. But the problem with that is, you know, in Malachi, the verse that I
 think has been misused over the years is, you know, says bring to the storehouse. So there may be
 food in my house. And so people would argue, well, that's not actually the church.
 Okay. Yeah. Like storehouse isn't the equivalent of a New Testament church.
 Okay. And I would argue, well, it says so that there may be food in my house.
 So I think you want to pay where you're fed.
 Yes.
 So like I don't go to jail,
 examiners that leave without paying and then go over to Chipotle and give them
 and give them a portion of the money.
 Right.
 I, you know, I want to give.
 And I think, and I'm, you know, if you're curious about this, I'll put a link
 in the show note to a service that hasn't happened yet.
 Because this is.
 It will happen tomorrow.
 God willing, it will happen tomorrow where I will preach.
 And I'll put a link in the show note to it where I talk about the parallel
 scriptures about first fruits and tithing and what's interesting in both those cases
 that says both of them are brought to the house of the Lord. Now, in those days the
 house of the Lord would be different than what the house of the Lord is today, but commonly
 what we refer to as the house of the Lord is your local church. So I want to encourage
 you if you are not tithing, I would encourage you to start tithing. If you have been tithing
 but realize like I mean my whole life I thought we were tithing I now realize I was just giving 10%
 On my schedule. Oh yeah, I got you. I'm tithing because you were we were doing it the wrong time
 Is that what you mean? Yeah, yeah, okay
 I would I would play around with that and if you're like actually I've been
 Because one of the arguments I've heard from people who say well
 I give a little bit here and a little bit here and a little bit here and a little bit here and then some to the church
 Is that who's going to support those other things if I give to the church?
 And my answer to that is if you faithfully tithe as it is in Scripture, I believe God will give you
 so much that you can afford to not only tithe but give to those people and have left over.
 Yes. And there's also churches like our church who tithe a 10% of everything that comes in
 from all of the tithes to support missions and all, you know, different ministries.
 So straight off about at least 10% of everything that comes in from our offerings at Grace Center
 goes to our missions, to our compassion fund, to our food pantry.
 We were talking to our kids this afternoon,
 it was a beautiful chapter of Proverbs, Proverbs 3,
 where Solomon's teaching his sons,
 and hey, I want you to be really wise,
 and don't want to depart from the Scriptures.
 And we were talking about the upside-down nature of the kingdom,
 because in Proverbs 3,
 it also talks about not leaving on your own understanding,
 but in all your ways, acknowledge God.
 And we just got to share with the kids story after story after story,
 where we've done things that hasn't made sense to the rational mind.
 But watching God not only come through for us, but do amazing things.
 And I think tithing has that challenge about it.
 Because what God's saying is, hey, if you give me this, you'll end up with more than if you hadn't given me it at all.
 Which is hard to believe.
 It doesn't make sense to the logical mind.
 But we've just our joy is in watching the Lord do that time and time and time and time and time and time again.
 So good.
 I have a listeners question about tithing.
 Oh.
 And it's tricky and I'll be honest with you.
 I don't have an answer off the top of my head.
 So you're not going to ask me the tricky question.
 I'm hoping that you will just access all the revelation of heaven.
 Oh dear.
 You forget that your nose is cold and you can't think.
 I'm so cold and my toes are cold.
 It's so cold in here.
 That's fulfilling my prophecy.
 Okay.
 You ready for a listeners question?
 this is from somebody who said I would prefer to stay anonymous. I tithed years ago when
 I was single. Now I married and my husband wrestles with tithing because of feeling
 manipulated into tithing in churches in the past. I would love to tithe but he's our main
 income and he doesn't want to. What are your thoughts? Just FYI, I don't pressure my husband
 and I'm not looking for justification to push him into tithing. Maybe my overall question
 is how to live abundantly while having a husband who's a believer, but definitely on a very
 different page.
 I think my gut response is, you know, tithe on anything that's directly given to you,
 like, you know, gifts, anything that the wife is directly, you know, earning income.
 Yeah, you could tithe on those things.
 I would just pray that the Holy Spirit would soften his heart to want to tithe.
 I would also like to repent on behalf of people like us pastors who have produced the fruit
 and people where they fell manipulated into tithing.
 Yeah, oh, for sure.
 I don't know how many manipulative altar calls that I have heard, but it's honestly shocking.
 And so I would like to start there and just kind of repenting for that.
 And I agree with Eiji, I think your prayers of like father, I'm asking that you would
 just speak to my husband's heart that you'd minister to.
 I would like to tithe.
 Would you speak to my husband's heart?
 Right.
 And I love the idea of like tithing what you can.
 So like this sounds might sound weird.
 So we tithe, like if I get a birthday present,
 I don't tithe the birthday present
 'cause I can't cut up 10% of a Sonos speaker, whatever.
 But if I'm giving money, I tithe the 10%.
  </li><li>If it's cash, then--
  </li><li>We've any increase that comes to us, we've tithe.
  </li><li>Well, we don't try and tithe on a gift card
 or something like that
 'cause you can't like cut a portion off of the gift card.
  </li><li>Well, sometimes we trade the gift card for cash
 and I do.
  </li><li>Well, then we, yeah, tithe on it.
 As soon as it becomes cash in hand,
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm trying to encourage you that,
 like, you know, you can practice the fine art of that.
 This might be manipulative.
 I don't mean it's a movie manipulative.
 I don't think that you can read The Blessed Life
 by Robert Morris without catching the infection
 of one to be generous.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And so I'm just wondering, anonymous,
 if you were to read that book,
 whether that would be a launching pad
 for the Holy Spirit.
 Like, I could just add a picture of your husband
 what are you reading? And you just waxing lyrical. And that's where I'm like, I'm not trying to
 be manipulative. I get what you're saying, but I'm also thinking, if I read that book and desperately
 wanted to tithe, and that made me even want to tithe even more, and you didn't want to tithe.
 But my hope is that he would read the book and be like, Oh my gosh, this is unbelievable.
 Okay. Maybe that's the worst advice ever. I don't know.
 But I'm just, I'm like, I love your heart. I love that you're like, ah, I would love to tithe.
 I'm imagining you've already had a conversation anonymous, but I wonder what it's like to have that conversation.
 Yeah, I remember Steve Long.
 I talked about this last week, Steve Long saying, you know, let's do a money bag guarantee.
 I wonder if you could just say to your husband, hey, my heart is being stirred in this direction.
 Can we try something for a couple of months?
 Could we tithe for a couple of months and track what happens with our finances or?
 Yeah.
 I mean, you'll know your husband and you'll know if that's a bad idea or a good idea.
 Yeah.
 But I love the heart of a praying wife.
 Yep, come on.
 Powerful.
 One of my heroes, Jack Deere, he was the staunch cessationist.
 And he's at least likely candidate to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
 And his wife had encountered the Holy Spirit and she just prayed for him.
 So I'm a firm believer in the Lord speaking to husbands.
 We've had that.
 Like the Lord's given you revelation about financial decisions that there's no way I'm going to go for.
 Yeah.
 And rather than try and persuade me, you've just prayed.
 I just pray.
 And then I have a dream or, you know, the Lord will speak to me independently and be like,
 Hey, guess what?
 And you're like, Oh, really?
 OK, I'm aware that we've got stakes in the Sufi dubstep.
 We do have stakes in the Sufi.
 My feet are freezing.
 Yes.
 So I want to land this plane.
 I do want to remind people that I'm getting ready to launch a course where we're going to do a deep dive into all of this.
 I had a question this week from somebody saying,
 "Hey, I hear you're teaching on this Grace Center.
 What is the difference between the stuff you're teaching
 at Grace Center and the stuff you're doing on the course?"
 The stuff that I'm doing at Grace Center
 is by necessity limited.
 I'm only teaching four weeks.
 My teaching time is anywhere between 20 minutes and 40 minutes.
 So there's tons of stuff on the cutting floor.
 The course that I'm teaching has got nine lessons
 that are all so practical.
 And of course, I'm gonna cover some of the stuff
 that I've been talking about at Gray Center.
 But where I'd say is if you've enjoyed the course
 at Gray Center, if it's been stirring,
 if you've got questions, if you're like,
 I want to hear more about that,
 if you'd like to learn about some of the more practical things
 about that I don't cover,
 have a look at the course,
 see if it's something that is, you know,
 wedding or appetite.
 And I say have a look at the course,
 but right now I haven't even revealed what the curriculum is.
 I'm right now I'm collecting emails
 of people who are interested.
 And if you're interested in being sent information as soon as it's available, go to allen and
 aga.com/more.
 And there's a page there where you can just put in your email and I will send it out to
 you.
 It's going to be a work at your own progress.
 Is that what you call it?
 Work at your own progress?
  </li><li>Case?
  </li><li>Work at your own pace.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Where you week by week will just work through as much or as little of the courses you want,
 then I will meet with you on a Saturday where I'm going to be available to answer questions.
  </li><li>Well, and that's a big difference.
 like when you say, what's the difference?
 It's not just that there's more content,
 it's that they get to meet with you on a call,
 ask questions that I think is helpful too.
  </li><li>Not only that, but one of the things I love doing
 when we taught the boundary summer school is
 we built this kind of like closed forum
 where if you can't make a call,
 you can ask your questions offline
 and I'll answer them either on the live call
 or I'll respond to them in this forum.
 There's also gonna be like little practical tools,
 Like one of the things that I talk about on the course,
 and one of the things we've used for years,
 which is gonna sound so nearly retentive,
 but it's remarkable, is a spreadsheet that I'm gonna
 upload that you can use.
 It's a template that we use that tracks are giving
 and are receiving.
 Remember that little song you learned as a kid,
 count your blessings name them one by one?
  </li><li>Yeah, we can name them 'cause we track them.
  </li><li>But it's so encouraging.
 And what we've now got is years of history
 where we can look at what we've given
 and what we've received and it's a constant reminder.
 So when we go through a season, we were like,
 Oh Lord, this is a great time.
  </li><li>But right now we were like, we need a miracle.
  </li><li>Well, we can look back and go, God, you are faithful then.
 We'll be faithful here.
 And so I'm really excited.
 You know, my passion is to train and to equip people.
 And I would love to spend time with you,
 helping you have a different relationship with your money.
 Again, allen and ag.com/more for all that information.
  </li><li>If you'd like the show notes,
 go to alanandaj.com/270.
  </li><li>And if you've got any questions that you want to ask us
 about this topic, about anything that's coming up,
 go to alanaj.com/ask and you can ask us questions.
 And if you would like to become a member of the show,
 support the show, get video access, get priority Q&amp;A,
 get discounts to things like the course I've just talked
 about or discounts on AJ's books,
 you can go to alanandaj.com/join to learn more about that.
  </li><li>All right, well, thank you for being with us
 And we will be with you again next week.
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games
