<p> Hello beautiful listener. Here's the deal. This episode is either gonna sound like we're making popcorn next to the microphone or
 It's gonna sound like we've gone straight hipster and have issued this episode on vinyl it
 Once again is full of snap crackle and pop which if it was a breakfast cereal would be ideal
 But it's not it's a podcast and it's one we take huge pride in producing to the highest quality that we can
 Sadly, despite having invested a lot of money in state-of-the-art equipment, we've had nothing but problems.
 So after spending countless hours with people who are experts in this arena and doing our best to troubleshoot the problem,
 we've contacted the manufacturer of one of the key pieces that make our podcast easy to record and are sending it back.
 We just wanted to apologize once again for the quality of the recording.
 It's absolutely not our heart to have it sound like this.
 If it helps pretend you're cooler than everyone else and if anyone asked why this episode is so crackly say yeah i prefer my podcast on vinyl.
 I'm not a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is jones is jones been quite the week it has been quite the week.
 It started off fantastically.<br/>
 It did.<br/>
 Monday, Monday we released a podcast with Henry and Alex Seeley from the belonging.
 Yes.<br/>
 That everybody seemed to love.<br/>
 Well, they're pretty lovable people's.
 They are.<br/>
 And they shared an amazing story.<br/>
 And they have fantastic accents.<br/>
 That's very, very true.<br/>
 If you haven't had a chance to listen to that, we think you'd love it.
 Go to lnag.com/97.<br/>
 But wait till you finish this one because this is going to be awesome too.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, hang on, hang on.<br/>
 I jumped ahead because Sunday night we went to the airport
 picked up our friend Dan Farley from Bethel Church in Reading California.
 Yes, we did. How awesome is Dan? Dan is on a scale of one to awesome, far past awesomeness.
 You know, we've worked hard to try and get them on the show, but when we fly men, we jam him
 pack at the school. So we need to work out a different schedule because the world needs to
 hear more Dan Farley. And he said he's open to it. So maybe it'll work out next time.
 If you haven't heard his teaching on brave communication, I'll put a link in the show notes
 and you can go grab it from Bethel's website. It is absolutely excellent.
 It is. It's fantastic.<br/>
 He's one of my favorite people to listen to, and he's done an incredible job of just being
 himself and in listening to his wisdom and his revelation, it has tempered a lot of the teaching
 that I do. Yeah, and he's also great at sort of demystifying scripture and just making
 loving the word a normal thing rather than like something just the zealots do.
 Dan, fairly two giant thumbs up. Yes. Well, that was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday we began to fall
 like flies. Yes, the family started dropping like flies. Well, in fairness, I dropped like two weeks
 ago. Right. And then Tia dropped last weekend. Okay, but you're on antibiotics, Tia's on antibiotics.
 and then mike john at 10 p.m. woke up on Wednesday night not feeling very well i don't want to talk about because i want to grow people out but it was just.
 There is lots of vomit it was his first time ever being sick she called i'm choking a joke.
 I'm not a joke and well we didn't realize was that that was going to be going on through the night.
 Yes we ran out of bed linen i ran the laundry three times four times four times between the hours of 10 p.m.
 in 3.30 a.m.<br/>
 Yes. We have like six bed sheets for the crib. We used all of them before we moved them into
 our bed. Yes. And I chose to sleep on the floor.
 Yes. But at least I got sleep at 3.30. I called out a night when the sleep woke up at 6.30.
 You just stayed awake through the night. Well, because he just would snuggle into my neck
 and hold onto my arm, which was adorable. And he'd be like, "Mommy, I know if you're good."
 And then he vomited on me. Yeah. Yeah. I changed four times as well.
 sleeping on the floor with no vomit or sleeping in bed with vomit. I think I won out pretty
 well. Yeah, I think he definitely won. So we took him to the doctor on Thursday, turns out he got
 hit with two things, strep throat, which Tia had. Right. And then also this 12 hour tummy bug.
 Yeah, poor baby. And the doctor was like, what time did he start at? And it was like 10 p.m.
 She's like, oh, and he's good. And through to her word, he was. He didn't throw up again after 10 a.m.
 So that was good. And then, but then the poor little muggy, so he had to get a shot in the bum.
 he did we couldn't give him antibiotics via his mouth because the doctor was like he'll just throw up again so.
 We held him down and they stuck trical into his butt it took forever took for every name was so sad and he didn't talk to me for like two hours after that.
 How I became the bad guy I have no idea you were the one that was holding him I know but while holding on whispered in his ear and said this is mommy's fault.
 You are horrible individual and then gets better because on Friday when we got up to start the day.
 poor abigail you know about as pale and way flight as you can imagine i have to
 say that we could have blown on her and she would have fallen over so
 so so sad to the daughter and she has what you had she had the sign is so
 everybody's on antibiotics yes and on probiotics to counter the anti-piotics
 and then friday night you went camping i did help me understand as i'm sure everyone
 knows i don't get the appeal of camping but tell me and i'll try to remain as open
 minded as possible the appeal of camping yet well i don't the appeal
 of leaving a perfectly good house that's warm and has like running water and electricity
 and Wi-Fi or you can eat whatever you want whenever you want and going to sleep on the
 ground under a nylon shell when it's below freezing.
 Well okay so sleeping on the ground under the nylon shell wasn't my favorite part.
 But isn't that like a core component of camping?
 Well first of all I slept on a mattress.
 Ooh upgrade.<br/>
 Yes well like a six inch mattress.<br/>
 I mean, I was not, I could not feel the floor at all.
</p><ul>
  <li>Piddle top, I assume?
  </li><li>Yes, absolutely.
 But it was definitely cold.
 I think the appeal is getting away.
 Like I realized when I got out to the state park
 that I had absolutely no signal whatsoever.
 Thank you, T-Mobile.
 Plenty of other people did have signal, I just didn't.
 But then when I realized that I thought,
 well, that's actually what I'm doing is sort of unplugging
 and just enjoying the people that you're with.
 So that's the appeal.
 The appeal is just enjoying people that you're with
 without all of the frivolities of normal life.
  </li><li>But don't you think the frivolities of normal life
 add to the enjoyment of people?
  </li><li>Well, I think it's easy to just hide in your home
 and not actually have any kind of relationship
 with people at all because you have all of the frivolities.
  </li><li>So you just shiver together and grow a special bond?
  </li><li>Well, we made a big bond fire and we all sat around it
 and then we rotated who got to sit close to the fire
 who had to be slightly farther away.
 And and it's the challenge and fun of making camp food, but it's still being yummy and bonding
 over having not slept the night before.
 There are plenty of people slept fine, but there are all the kind of people that can like just,
 most of them would say things like, well, I just buried my face in my sleeping bag or I went fully
 into my sleep. I can't, if I can't breathe normal air, you know, I can't do it.
 I can't cycle up to you at night because I'm quote unquote breathing your air.
 You can spoon. You just can't go face to face.
 I can't spoon with you.
 You're like, it's you're wrong. I can hear your breathing.
 Well, there's just some people don't like to be touched when they're asleep and I'm one of them.
 Oh, you crack me up.
 So, but it was good.
 And I got to wake up to a babbling brook that was right next door to me at 6 a.m.
 Well, the birdies were I actually asked the Lord to murder birds.
 I was like, no, I'm not ready since angels to murder those birds.
 Oh, it didn't happen.
 OK, well, you haven't redeemed it for me whatsoever.
 It all sounds horrible.
 I got to have really great conversations and meet how much people I didn't know.
 So that was good.
 That was glorious.
 A horrible.
 Saturday, our friend David Campbell, who's in this week, teach on the school, he flew
 in Friday.
 It was a Friday?
 Yeah, he flew in Friday because I was away camping.
 You're going to come and that's right.
 I went and picked him up with the dinner together.
 So our friend David is here.
 David is an amazing leader from England.
 He's Scottish though.
 Yes, he's definitely Scottish.
 I.
 He's a missionary to England.
 Anyway, he's over here for a week.
 End of the brief.
 Please stop.
 Sorry.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 And that's just so great to see him.
 He did a tremendous job speaking at Grayson
 on Sunday morning.
 We love that.
 It was very good.
 It was very humorous, too.
 So it sounds like a bad week, but I'm glad it's over,
 and it wasn't that bad.
 I'm glad that MJ was the only one that got the vomiting thing.
 Yep.
 That could have been horrific.
 Yeah.
 All right, let's stop talking about vomit.
 Let's talk about our main topic for this week.
 What is our main topic for this week?
 We're going to be talking about the BIBLE.
 B-I-B-L-E, yes, that's the book for me.
 I stand alone on the word of God, B-I-B-L-E.
 Pretty good for somebody who didn't grow up in church, huh?
 Somebody who didn't grow up in church.
 Yes.
 Tell me this.
 You obviously love the word of God.
 I love the word of God.
 When we were designing second year, the second year of school,
 supernatural life, you were super excited about not only teaching about the word
 of God, but teaching the word of God itself.
 Yes.
 And you have this year taught verse by verse through the song songs.
 Yes.
 the book of Ephesians, the book of Romans, and most recently, the book of Esther.
 Tell me how you grew to love the Word of God.
 I think it is hard to be close to the Holy Spirit and not love the Word of God.
 I think I'm just thinking like I, when I first got saved, which is when I was 15,
 I was in a Baptist church.
 And so, and they're pretty hardcore word people.
 those baptists. And so I started reading and memorizing because that's what you do.
 But when the renewal started in Toronto and the Holy Spirit started showing up,
 I just found myself getting hungrier and hungrier and hungrier for the word.
 Okay.
 So I don't know that I can give you a method other than draw close to God and
 let him build that hunger in you. Like, Tal got, I want a hunger for your word. You know, some
 people I think have had the word sort of ram down their throats or like, you're supposed to,
 you must love, you know, you should. And luckily, I don't think anybody ever should
 have it on me. I think it was just, I wanted to understand it. And I knew like, because I didn't
 grow up hearing the Bible, I, it was all new to me. So it was interesting.
 Right, but was this from immediately when you got saved or once renewal started?
 Once renewal started, I got way more into it. I liked the challenge when I first got saved of
 memorizing scripture because it was something that was easy for me to do and I could win contests at
 church and stuff. But I'm actually quite thankful for that because a lot of the stuff I had to
 memorize, I still have that. I still have that. I would say I really got much more hungry and
 and really started enjoying the word
 after the revival started in Toronto.
  </li><li>Okay. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Who was instrumental in teaching you the word?
  </li><li>Probably a bunch of different people like,
 I loved when I heard people like John Arne,
 of course, talk or Mark DuPont,
 people like that, that they obviously really loved the word
 and that to me was super inspiring.
 And then later when I met like Patricia King
 And people that know the word backwards and forwards, like they could, they don't need
 a Bible in front of them to tell you what the verse before the verse that was just quoted
 said, you know, that kind of stuff.
 I was like, I didn't know you could know the Bible like that.
 And it's obviously life to you.
 So I want that.
 I actually invented a traveling Bible game at one point.
 Oh, wait, do tell.
 Because I've seen your traveling game.
 No, because you know, we need to go on road trips with people and I would take people that we were
 that I was mentoring on the road, you know, to different things. You'd be driving for six hours.
 And so I invented a game called Link. And in Link, somebody starts with one verse and they just say
 the verse. So they would say, you know, whatever, Romans 8 verse 28, for we know that God causes
 all things to come together for good for those love God and call according to His purpose. So you go,
 Okay. And then the person who was next to them would have to pick another verse.
 And they'd only have like a one minute window to find it.
 That naturally linked with the theme of the previous verse. And if you had to explain
 why you were linking the two, then it was a fail. Like you didn't actually link it.
 Are you telling me that this game takes a minute each round?
 Well, admit you had a minute to find the verse if you didn't know where it was.
 What does every do in the meantime while that person's finding it?
 I mean, a minute I've already lost interest in this game.
 Well, people were, I think a lot of people were trying to prep possible
 verses that they could have come up with so that they could link their thing.
 But like at one point, a friend of mine, Mark and I were doing this road trip and he and
 I were playing the game and we must have played it for like five and a half hours while driving.
 Just back and forth.
 Did Nintendo ever come knocking to license this game?
 No, sadly, but but we had fun.
 But they did use the name Link in the Zelda series.
 Yeah, that's where they got it from.
 That's my link right there.
 There you go. Talk to me about and we're not arguing here because we tease each other.
 But talk to me about your go to translations.
 My go to translations are the NASB and the message.
 I have a parallel Bible that has them both next door to each other.
 It's possibly the biggest Bible I've ever seen.
 It's enormous.
 I'm not going to lie.
 It came with, you see, you brought the Bible and it came with the NASB on one side,
 the message on the other and two years worth of free chiropractic adjustment.
 It should have.
 It should have.
 It works great as a pillow though, because, you know, you don't really scrunch
 your shoulder when you lie down on it.
 It's not the size of the yellow pages.
 It's enormous.
 But I love it.
 It's a great, it's a great Bible.
 I started reading the NSP when I got saved.
 And then when the renewal started, of course, I was in a different
 church because I had moved to the Toronto Airwork Christian fellowship.
 And I remember going up to John and to Mark and saying, what version do you read?
 And they both read the NSP, which is what I was already reading.
 So I was like, oh, I'll stay with that.
 It's obviously a security.
 And it's nice to read something that's familiar.
 You know, you tend to like what you started with.
 Then how the heck did you end up with a message?
 That was totally the Lord.
 There was passages of scripture that I just didn't enjoy, like the song of Solomon.
 And when I started reading it in the message, I was like, Oh, I feel like for the first
 time I'm understanding something here, I'm getting why people like certain books.
 And I thought they're about as opposite as you can get, you know, the NASB and the message.
 So to read the same verse right beside each other, actually, there's a whole lot of discussion
 I could have with the Holy Spirit about, huh, what's actually going on here?
 So it really helped in that department.
 That makes sense.
 We haven't talked about my new foray into old habits.
 Into the land of paper?
 Yeah, I bought a paper notepad the other week.
 Yes.
 And in part, because I've long been aware of the link, the physiological link between
 writing things down and spatial awareness. And I've tried to keep my whole life as digital as
 possible. And I have a fairly good system, except I'm realizing I'm forgetting things. And who
 knows whether it's age or diet or, I don't know, whatever. But I thought I want a way to capture
 stuff in analog with a pen that I will then file away digitally for long-term storage,
 because the advantages of digital are too good to give up. But I realized that a lot of the time
 I will digitally enter something and then haven't a clue where I put it. And it'll take me forever
 while I'm searching, ever know, or did I put it in notes or did I put in my to do minutes? So I
 thought, what if I just capture everything on paper and then file away the stuff I want to keep?
 Because some stuff is just, I'm using paper for temporary access. I need to write down
 something that has been done today and it doesn't need to be.
 Exactly.
 But when Dan was here, Monday night, he spoke at Ammonate and he really challenged me about reading the Bible.
 Of course, I read the Bible a lot.
 But in the same way that I've tried to eradicate paper from my life, I haven't owned
 a paper Bible probably in about 10 years.
 Well, I mean, I've been married to you for 11 and I've never seen you with one.
 And the reason for that is I kept losing them or they'd get stolen.
 Yeah. And I'd spend a long time marking up my Bible. I have a partial photographic memory in
 that when I would read the Bible, I would know the verse I was looking for because it was in the
 bottom left hand corner of that thing in Isaiah. And I'd remember maybe the rough chapter, but not
 necessarily the verse, but photographically, I'd remember where it was, which you don't have when
 you do everything on a computer. Right. And I love Bible study on a computer. I'm frequently in many,
 many different translations and parallels and I've got Greek and Hebrew lexicons open and this
 and so I just love, I love all that stuff. But I have missed quite sincerely just picking up my
 Bible and reading it because reading off of glass for whatever reason, I'm not enjoying. And I
 actually miss holding a Bible in one hand and the field of the paper.
 That's what I've been interceding for for 11 years.
 It is strange though that I am turning the tide.
 But that's presented a host of new problems because for the life of me, I cannot find
 a Bible I like.
 Please before everybody texts me or emails me or tweets me, here's a Bible you'd like.
 Let me give you some clarification.
 So I went to what's the big Bible store in life?
 Life way and couldn't find a Bible I wanted.
 And of all of their Bibles.
 I found lots of things I liked but didn't have any of the criteria.
 So it would seem based on my cursory inspection of the current state of Bibles that publishers
 spend more time, more money, more market research in the covers of the Bible than the actual
 design of the typographic layout of the Bible.
 Because the Bible is going to be the only book that we read that is constantly cluttered
 with unnecessary information.
 So for example, when was the last time you read a book that is in two columns on one page,
 but on either side of the columns, there are tiny little numbers and cross references
 and points and you're just like, oh, that is so visually distracting.
 Then the choice of font that they're using is tiny.
 You can't read 8.75 font size, especially when it's written on tissue paper, where you
 can see the other side of the 8.75 font.
 It's terrible.
 they don't write it on that then that's going to be twice as big split it into volumes.
 It did that with Harry Potter and everyone.
 But nobody wants a two volume Bible.
 Which volume should I bring with me to church?
 No, I don't need it to bring to church.
 I just need it at home so I can read.
 You know, it is already in two volumes or 66 books, like either way.
 You could have an Old Testament and a New Testament or books of poetry or so there's
 ways around this.
 And then, so even if they have that all right, like the typography, like let's boost the
 font size.
 So I realize again, maybe I'm getting old, but I now need large print, not giant print.
 Giant print is you can read it from the other side of the room.
 But large print is what I would call normal print.
 Then the leading, which is the space between the lines is all wrong.
 So I'm just like, seriously, I must have killed the graphic designers who laid this stuff out
 because it's everything against good practice.
 It's possible that there may be not as, what's the word I'm looking for?
 Discerning or picky as you are.
 Well, I tell you who's killing it right now.
 Who's killing it?
 Crossway who are doing all the ESV books.
 Crossway. That's what my journaling Bible is.
 But I don't like the ESV to read for fun.
 I got nothing against the ESV.
 I use it often when I'm studying, but it's not what I want to read.
 I prefer to read the new living translation.
 So what I'm looking for.
 Yes.
 Is a new living translation.
 Yes.
 That I'm fine with chapter headings.
 I'm even fine with chapter numbers, but I don't need verses in it.
 And I want single column, like one block of text per page.
 I want it on nicer papers than tissue paper.
 I want an appropriate font size.
 You may have to print this yourself.
 I don't want to fully justified because it's not a newspaper.
 And yeah, I did think about typesetting it myself.
 Yeah, in all your spirit. I'm sure it's a small job. It's not a very large book,
 but the cross. We've got this ESV readers edition. It's a beautiful, beautiful book.
 I mean, it's gorgeous, but I don't want to read the ESV. I'd settle for an NIV. I don't mind reading
 the NIV, but I really want to read the new living translation. So I'm on a hunt for a new Bible.
 I thought you should you found one. Well, I found one that meets some of my criteria,
 but not all of my criteria. It's a single column, but they're still marking the verses
 down the left hand side and it's set in some like nine point font shocking behavior and
 I haven't seen it in the flesh but nevertheless I want a Bible to read. I've got tons of Bible
 stuff. Do you want it like made from the hide of baby goats that have been smoothed in coconut
 butter and led beside a river for 18 months? Well, they've gazed at me. I feel like you're
 walking me. I don't feel like it's too much to ask the most important book in the world to have some proper typographic treatment.
 Okay.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Yes.
 Like you could pick up any other books and it will read it for the actual words.
 Yes.
 But my point is you don't want to be distracted while doing that.
 Okay.
 I think that is very interesting and possibly unique to your personality.
 I've never been distracted by the like the number references or anything.
 I don't look at them and go, I'm so distracted.
 You know, that's not true though, because when you were preparing all your teaching material,
 your problem of copying and pasting was all the little verse numbers and you wanted a
 way to be able to access it without those verse numbers.
 No, that's not what I was removing.
 I wasn't removing verse numbers.
 I was removing the little tiny ones and twos that A, B, C, that reference all the five things,
 which is a visual distraction for your students, correct?
 I agree, but those don't appear in my Bible.
 Oh, in the Bible copy, you have right.
 They did in this one.
 I was just like, people, please.
 Yes.
 I know before anybody takes me, I know there was a Kickstarter to do a reader's
 version of the Bible, the split in multiple volumes with a lot of the comments
 I've made addressed.
 Unfortunately, it's set in ASV, which which is would remove any joy from reading.
 Because now I need an English literature degree to understand what you said.
 All right. Well, we can pray, baby.
 I'm confident that there's one out there and I just haven't discovered it.
 Yeah.
 But anyway, I'm back in the paper and I'm really looking forward to reading the Bible.
 Good.
 In a book.
 I honestly, I love reading it on paper.
 I don't enjoy reading it.
 I enjoy researching with my computer.
 I don't enjoy reading it on my computer.
 I've collected over the years a list of snippets about the Bible.
 Derek Prince, who's one of the finest teachers, Bible teachers that ever lived.
 He said this, "The Bible is the only book that while you read it, it reads you."
 Yeah, that's awesome.
 And when Dan was here on Monday, he made a couple of great points I wrote down.
 He said, "The Bible is the only book we can read and the author will sit next to us."
 Yes.
 And we have access to the author.
 We can just ask him.
 So...
 Yeah, that's the whole deal.
 Like, I mean, I think that's what I started to understand when I got to know the Holy Spirit
 as I could ask him questions as I was reading and be like, I mean, honestly, I probably at
 this point, hundreds of times where I would go, Holy Spirit, why does this matter?
 Or what's going on here?
 And he would tell me something about the history of the time that I did not know that I had
 no way of knowing and I would go back and look it up.
 And it was true, you know, of course, because the Holy Spirit knows, but I mean, he wants
 to fill in the blanks for us and to make it a less frustrating experience because there's
 life on the word and they're supposed to be life on the word. So I loved it when he was talking about
 that. Like the author is sitting with you because I'm like, yes, no wonder if people don't know that,
 no wonder they don't enjoy reading it. Right. How about this? He said, good preaching points out
 bad thinking. Yeah. George Bernard Shaw said this about reading the Bible. Tiesies do think
 together. He says, no man ever believes that the Bible means what it says. He is always convinced
 that it says what he means. But that's what I love about reading the Bible is every day when
 When you read the Bible, there's a challenge to your way of thinking.
 Yeah.
 And I think a lot of the error that we see shock exclusive is because people have stopped either
 reading the Bible or reading the Bible to prove what they think.
 Yeah.
 Or they've thrown out large portions of it because they don't like it or they don't understand it.
 And so they're coming up with their own gospel message.
 Dan said something that I thought I'd ask you to elaborate on.
 I really loved what he said.
 I think this is part of the reason I want to get a Bible in paper is he said read these
 are his top tips for learning to read the Bible and enjoy.
 First of all, read out loud, sign of all read with the pain.
 And he said, then when you're reading, he said, mark up your Bible liberally.
 And I want to talk to you about the way you mark up your Bible because shock exclusive.
 You have a plan.
 He also said, keep a pad with you and write down three headings, God, me and do.
 And he said, as you're reading, if you learn something about God, put it in the God column.
 If you learn something about you, put it in the me column.
 And if you read something that says you're supposed to do something, write it down.
 Right.
 And then he added a fourth column.
 He said, if you're reading an Old Testament, write down them.
 He said, because you've got to read the Old Testament, the light of Jesus being here.
 But I was like, that's a great little, because normally when I go to study the Bible, I'm
 going into already knowing what I'm looking for.
 But I love the idea of accidentally discovering stuff as your reading scripture, that just
 as part of your daily devotion of reading that you would allow the Holy Spirit to speak
 to you through those three or four different things.
 So let's talk about markup because if anyone looks at your Bible, it's covered in ink
 and you have a plan.
 Talk to you about your plan, where you got it from.
 It's funny because Dan said at one point he's like, "Oh, I used to do multi-colors
 and that he doesn't do that anymore."
 For me, it really fits with my personality type and how my brain works.
 But I ended up, the first thing that I did in terms of color was when I first started
 getting the revelation of the Father Heart of God, I read through the Bible from start
 to finish.
 And I underlined in blue any place where it was talking about the love of God or the
 Father Heart of God.
 So blue is the love of God?
 Yeah.
 And it still is, even in the new Bible, because my older one just got so, I had one that got
 stolen. And then the next one, yeah, I just got so marked up that I was like, it's time to get
 a new one, which is why I got the parallel. So in the parallel, yeah, the love of God,
 or the Father Heart of God message is all in blue. Anything that has to do with healing or
 deliverance is underlined in green. And then beside it, I would write either an H or a D.
 Anything that's a promise of God is underlined in red.
 I have anything about intimacy is underlined in pink.
 I'm trying to think I have things for all the kind of different colors.
 Anything that's just really super important, like, wow, this is pivotal for what's going on in this chapter.
 I've underlined in orange.
 Do you ever underlined anything in black?
 I do. I don't underline in black. Usually I write notes in the margin in black. So I'll tag it with
 my little promises are at P and then prophetic words that we've seen fulfilled are P with a circle
 around it. Oh my gosh. I've written down this legend anywhere. Yeah, it's written in the back of my
 Bible. So how often do you have to consult it? Or is that just? I don't have to look at it anymore.
 But then I will in black, I'll write in the margins if there's something particular.
 Like sometimes the Lord will give me like a little expression or a little rhyming
 something that goes with what he's just shown me.
 So I'll just write that in the margin beside.
 Unbelievable.
 So.
 Unbelievable.
 So it's pretty marked up, but, but it's organized marked up.
 So I can open to a book and I can, you know, look just by the colors.
 No, roughly what it's all talking about.
 All right. Well, we'd love to hear from you. We'd love to hear what version of Bible you love reading.
 We'd love to hear any books that you've read that's really changed where you read the Bible.
 One of the books that we study in second year in the school of Supernatural Life is Grasp and God's Word,
 which I've really enjoyed going through.
 Yeah, it's been amazing.
 Really enjoyed teaching.
 There's some other great books about how read the Bible for all is worth by Gordon Fee and
 somebody else that put links to that in the show notes. But if you didn't catch Ammonate Monday
 I'd really encourage you to go listen to Dan Farrelly teach on reading the Bible.
 He's summarized by saying that the Bible is food, the Bible keeps us from error,
 and the Bible keeps us in faith.
 It's super easy to listen to.
 Again, I'll put a link to that in the show notes.
 Babe, are you ready for one of the greatest listeners questions I've ever received?
 Yes.
 Here we go.
 This is from anonymous.
 Hello, anonymous.
 And he or she says this many times I've heard you give this fabulous advice.
 Find leaders you love and submit to them.
 As you expound on that, it's clear that your leaders work to create clear culture and expectations.
 Have you on their grid, invest in you, spend time and effort and advice on you?
 I'm sure you're aware many leaders do not operate that way.
 I'm at a small church where I believe I'm called to serve and lead for the duration.
 I love my pastor and submit to him, but he is too busy keeping things afloat to create the culture you describe.
 I tend to get very frustrated and discouraged when I hear you talk about the way you are
 led, because I don't and probably won't get those things from my pastor.
 I do what I can to lead in a way I long to be led, but it is difficult.
 Should I pursue him and try to pull leadership out of him?
 Should I make him make time for me?
 Or should I find accountability, encouragement, and vision elsewhere?
 What advice do you have for lay leaders operating and remaining in less vibrant organizational
 cultures. Oh, I love that question.
 Wow. Well, it sounds like you're doing a lot of stuff right in terms of you know,
 that for right now, that's where God has you and you're choosing to serve there and
 just, you know, be in the game, which is awesome. I have also served under leaders
 for seasons of a couple of years at a time that really didn't create any kind of
 the cultures that we value at this point, or that would have been conducive to building
 us in leadership, that sort of thing.
 During those seasons, because again, I knew that the Lord had asked me to be in that particular
 spot, I was just like, "God, I'm just going to trust you that this works out well and
 that you're doing something in me and you're doing something in those that I'm serving."
 We have been blessed to be under amazing leaders for the majority of the time and be in a culture where,
 yeah, we're the things that we value are very prevalent.
 So advice that I would give.
 It seems like from your question that you know, you're where you're supposed to be at the moment.
 So I think it's hard to give advice without knowing the players.
 But, but part of me would say, is there room to talk to the leader that you're serving and just sort of say,
 um, hey, this is how I'm experiencing being here.
 I, I want to be here.
 I feel like God has me here.
 Um, but I, I'd love to know how you're experiencing me.
 And I'd love to know if there's some way to, you know, be, be trained more, be poured into more.
 Right. And I can relate to that because like Asia, I've worked under less than stellar leaders.
 And yet the response that we need to give our leaders is the same whether they're good or bad
 leaders. And that's to honor them, make them look good, get underneath and push up. Because
 whatever you sow into this leader, you'll not only reap when you're a leader, but you'll also
 reap in your next leaders. And it is, especially in some churches where, I mean, we're so blessed,
 we've gotten an enormous, relatively speaking, pastoral team. So not everybody's as stretch as
 they might be if there was a whole lot less of us. But even still, I think, I'm not picking this
 on you, I think, as a general rule of a human race, we teach others how we want to be treated.
 So AJ and I, with all our leaders,
 have been very intentional and with high degrees of honor
 in seeking out what we want from our leaders,
 especially in leaders that don't necessarily think like we do.
 We learn how do they think,
 how can we in the midst of running with them
 and serving them, also inquire of them
 and get the things that we need?
 And one of the things that we've taught in the past
 is how do you interact with leaders?
 Because leaders tend to think differently
 from the people who are leading,
 because they've got way more things to think about than just, you know, often when we are
 feeling frustrated by our leaders, we're looking at what they're doing and thinking,
 well, here's a much better way of doing it, but we don't have all the facts.
 Right.
 So I, one of the things that we've practiced for a long time is being really relational and really
 direct with a small D. I don't mean direct assertive, I mean, direct, clear and saying,
 "Hey, here's something that would really be able to help me.
 "Is that something that you can do right now?"
 And if it is fantastic and if it isn't, it isn't.
 And with all our leaders, we've done that.
 Like I remember when I traveled with John and Carol,
 who are amazing leaders in and of themselves,
 but I remember people who watched me
 as I interned with them said,
 "Oh my gosh, you just draw so much out with them."
 Because I'd ask questions all of the time.
 Now, I would try and realize I'd try and be aware
 like when is a good time to ask questions?
 Are they drained and exhausted?
 let's not do that, let's write that question down
 and ask it another time.
 But I would draw out the information they'd want
 with a friend who used to intern with Heidi Baker
 and she realized Heidi has no time to herself at all.
 But she would realize when she slept on the base
 that Heidi would get up very, very early in the morning,
 she'd get in a jeep, she would drive somewhere
 where she didn't know.
 And so our friend just decided,
 I'm gonna get up earlier than Heidi
 and I'm gonna ask if I can come with her.
 She positioned herself in the leader's flow to draw stuff out.
 Even with Jeff and Becky, we would sit down and we would just say,
 "Hey, here's one of the things we would love.
 Are you able to give it?"
 So we're big fans of being...
 Clearly communicating.
 Yeah.
 We're big fans of, first of all, just sewing where you want to go.
 Same of all, just honoring your leaders no matter what shape they're in.
 Because no matter the degree of the leader,
 that shouldn't influence the degree that you're a follower.
 So you're going to purpose that in your heart.
 And then third of all, just speak really, really clearly in requests, in humble requests.
 And it may be that this person doesn't have that bandwidth and that's fine.
 God is so good at making up the lack that we feel because he's our ultimate leader.
 So I hope that helps.
 I'm sorry that we've maybe frustrated you by talking about how awesome our leaders are.
 But we've helped cultivate what we want.
 You know, leaders don't meet everybody's expectations.
 No.
 So one of the things you can do is either adjust your expectations or help them meet your expectations.
 And of course, and it doesn't sound like you are, but just watch your heart that you don't get better.
 You know, with what you wish it looked like.
 And just trust the Lord to bring it about.
 However, he's going to bring about because he does care about the desires of your heart as well.
 All right.
 I hope that helps.
