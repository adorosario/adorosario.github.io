<p> I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Welcome to episode 273 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Who's 73?<br/>
 You're looking resplendent.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 I might be pushing it.<br/>
 I might be pushing it with resplendent.
 You're looking good.<br/>
 We'll resplendent.<br/>
 You are.<br/>
 Let's just...<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Let's go.<br/>
 Let's go to resplendent.<br/>
 You can't take back resplendent.<br/>
 once you've said it.<br/>
 You're looking glorious.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 You're looking bountiful.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Do you want to tell everybody what your brainstorm idea was about five minutes ago?
 We were cuddling the guinea pigs.<br/>
 You know, we've got two guinea pigs.<br/>
 One of them is really tame, sociable.<br/>
 That's Zelda.<br/>
 Link is not so much.<br/>
 Like, so for example, if I put my hand into the pen.
 It's just more timid and afraid.<br/>
 Yeah, but if I put my hand into the pen, Zelda will come out and see who I am and what I'm
 doing.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And if I pick her up, she won't fight me.
 as Link will run around the pant, does not want to be picked up.
 Yeah, and then she squeaks when you pick her up sometimes.
 So in an effort to traumatize her, acclimate her to me and teach her that I am a safe,
 warm, welcoming presence.<br/>
 You waited for her to run into her hiding hole and then picked her up out of it.
 Yeah, she's done.<br/>
 So she feels safe.<br/>
 Yeah, she runs in the same place.<br/>
 I picked her up.
</p><ul>
  <li>I'm stroking her and I know that they love to borrow.
 So I open up my shirt and let her borrow in here.
 But what I don't plan on is that she's--
  </li><li>It's a dress shirt.
 I was just trying like for people that are listening
 'cause you're showing your shirt.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm so I'm wearing a shirt with a t-shirt
 underneath it like a button up, collar shirt.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And I open up my shirt and she just runs straight in,
 which is fine, that's what I expected her to do,
 was just kind of do a U-turn
 and then stick her head out the front.
 But no, no, what she tried to do was kind of run up
 over my shoulder and then down my sleeve
 and dang those nails are sharp.
  </li><li>And Alan couldn't get her out.
 So she's like, how have we done her sleeve?
 How have we done his sleeve?
 And I had to--
  </li><li>I'm using my right hand to grab my left shoulder
 to stop her going any further.
 And then using my left hand, it's like a game of twister
 and kind of soothe her
 'cause I can feel her heart rate freaking out.
 And then I'm worried she's gonna go up
 over my shoulder and down the back of the sofa.
 So I'm wedging my back against the sofa while anyway, it didn't turn out great.
 -It's a super idea, it turned out pretty bad.
 So I had to go and put down Zelda and come and rescue Link from you.
 -The worst part is it's the second time I've tried to do that.
 -It is the second time.
 -It's not getting better, but I will tame her.
 She will love me.
 -I would prefer if you'd stop trying to like--
  </li><li>Like, "Hush, hush, no child."
  </li><li>Why don't you try not traumatizing here
 when you pick her up?
  </li><li>We need to do a weekly catch up.
 We don't have time for this to pick up.
  </li><li>Oh, okay, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Truth be told, it's been a pretty taxing week.
  </li><li>It was a very intense week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Let's start with the, you know,
 a last week episode, or not last week,
 'cause we skipped a week.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But--
  </li><li>The last episode. - The last episode.
  </li><li>The last episode that was availed.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We talked about, "Hey, we put our name in
 for an adoption."
  </li><li>Yes.
 we didn't get that baby.
  </li><li>No. - And lots of people are really,
 really sweet coming up at church this morning going,
 "Hey, I'm really starting to get the baby."
 Like, we're actually okay.
  </li><li>I'm perfectly fine. - Totally okay.
 And I think people are confused
 about the roller coaster element of it.
 It's not so much an emotional roller coaster.
 It's kind of a, as people like to plan
 and know what we're doing,
 it's more of that kind of roller coaster.
  </li><li>Well, I would say it's also an emotional roller coaster,
 but I don't think either of us felt
 as emotionally excited.
 You know, we were we were just sort of clarity.
 Yeah, we were just like, okay, God.
 So actually when they came back with, you know, they've the moms picked a different family.
 We're like, great.
 Great. Yeah.
 Having clarity.
 It's the waiting that greats on me.
 Oh, yeah.
 The waiting is not knowing.
 Because on the other end of a yes, as the baby will be born in two weeks.
 Yeah, that was the part that was like, honestly, I was like, oh, not having to pull
 everything together in two weeks, because really we're not ready.
 We don't have any baby things.
 I'm not ready for tomorrow.
 Yeah.
 An adult, let alone.
 So the idea of pulling it together in two weeks was like,
 but also wanted to be opened.
 Right. Right.
 So yeah, when she didn't pick us, I kind of felt like, oh, yeah.
 Good.
 So that kind of overshadowed the week.
 I mean, we found out on Friday that we weren't getting the baby.
 So you're going through the week going, will we?
 Will we not constantly checking our email?
 Our sweet kid's gone.
 Have we heard yet?
 have we heard yet? Yeah, we have, we just didn't decide to tell you just because we're
 like that. No, we haven't heard. Then our sweet little boy, MJ, he got sick Sunday, Monday,
 Tuesday with a fever, negative for COVID twice. Yeah. To be honest, the third day he didn't
 have a fever, but our school rules, which I am happy to abide by is make sure child is
 fever free for 24 hours. So that last day, there's literally nothing wrong with him,
 but to comply with the school rules, we ain't send him back. Yeah. But on the Tuesday, when
 he was sick. We had a little bit of a shaperful part where we made a plan and forgot that
 the plan sucked. So you and I have to work. I realized I have to pick up Tia for her orthodontist
 appointment, but I also have meetings at the end, the time I'm supposed to pick her up.
 And oh, yes, PS MJ is at home. Oh, and so I need to feed all those three people, including
 myself.
 And I was to get to work.
 And it was a yeah.
 And then I would say that most of our weeks are pretty meeting heavy, but this week for
 whatever reason was exceptionally meeting heavy.
 Yes.
 All that to say, we got to the end of this week and we were taxed.
 Yes.
 We were depleted.
 Yeah.
 I was just totally spent.
 Spent is a great way of explaining it.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 Like MJ came home on Friday.
 Because we were all exhausted, we were going to go out Friday night, weren't we?
 We were going to go out for burgers.
 Yeah, we were gonna go out for dinner just so I didn't have to and when I told my nine year old that we were gonna get for dinner
 He said to me. He said daddy. I've spent all my people energy at school. I have no people energy left to go
 I and he was in tears more like we
 Understand that we can fix something at home
 And we'll just have a lazy night tonight and we won't do anything
 But like I felt so bonded to my nine year old and I've spent all my people energy like I get that. Yeah, so big week
 Taxing week yes spent week yes, which actually the gift in that is its lent itself to this week's topic. Oh
 What's this week's topic this week's topic is all about loving your limitations? Oh
 Just I would say
 That from doing all of the feelings work the feeling I was least ready to equate myself with was shame
 Yeah, and part of that because our background our culture our teaching our viewpoint is shame is bad
 Back shame back. That's really toxic shame. Yes
 Didn't what I call or what we call shame is what Chip would call toxic shame, right?
 But healthy shame like if you sit with your shame gives you the gift
 If you sit with your healthy shame gives you this gift of realizing you have limitations
 Yeah, that as wonderful as you are and you are wonderful
 you have glorious limitations. I have glorious limitations. And making peace with those limitations,
 I have come to learn can radically improve the quality of your life.
 So what I want to do today is because I know you're tired.
 Yes. I thought about it.
 What cheeky thing?
 No, I was just thinking.
 Were you about to say?
 I was going to share with our audience my interrogation technique.
 AJ was passed out on the sofa.
 I mean, she fell asleep sitting up.
 Literally sitting up.
 So I climbed on top of her, all of my weight on top of her,
 and I interrogated her.
 I said, what are we going to do the podcast on?
 And she didn't give me an answer.
 So I thought it wouldn't be wise to choke out my wife.
 And so I disappeared in my office for, I don't know, half an hour.
 I wrote down some notes.
 OK.
 I want to share five ways to love your limitations, five steps to loving your limitations.
 Okay, I'm excited.
 And I thought I would share them and then you could kind of bounce around with you.
 Yeah, or just ask questions or give examples or those things.
 You don't know these five things.
 I know.
 All right.
 So this is a mysterious podcast episode for me.
 Okay, let's do this.
 Yeah, I just thought it'd be good to like talk about like, how do you treat yourself with kindness
 when you end up with a week like the week we just said?
 Well, like when life leaves you empty, how can you still be kind to yourself?
 Yeah.
 Rather than shame yourself for being exhausted.
 Yes.
 And beat yourself up.
 Good.
 Before we jump into that, though, it is worth noting that if life is constantly
 leaving you depleted and spent, it's probably not a good idea to come up with
 strategies about how to survive that.
 It's probably a better idea to take a good long, hard look at your life and
 maybe make some big architectural changes.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So I would say that we have a busy life,
 but we have a rich life,
 and it doesn't, generally speaking,
 leave us depleted like it did this week.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I would say this is like a particularly strenuous week.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we have many of those.
  </li><li>At that point, these are the things you might do.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I think what I'm trying to say is,
 if you're feeling exhausted, it's worth looking at,
 is the reason I'm feeling exhausted just the season I'm in,
 which is okay, right?
 seasons change. We're coming into spring in Franklin. Beautiful.
 Whether last couple of days. Well, except for the pollen, except for the
 pollen count. Or is the reason you're exhausted just because your life is
 chaotic. I want to read this. And maybe you need some structural changes.
 Yes. Yeah. I saw this posted on social media. I don't know who it was. I
 screenshot it, but it wasn't tagged with under his name. Okay. It says
 this, true self care is not soft baths and chocolate cake. It is
 making the choice to build a life you don't need to regularly escape from.
 That's great.
 So that's wisdom.
 So we're not trying to.
 But this person is not against baths and chocolate cake.
 I hope not.
 Yeah, because those are two great things.
 So a little bit of wisdom here.
 This episode is not all about how do you stay in chaos and survive it.
 Yeah.
 It's about like, what do you do when you just have one of those weeks or one of those days?
 Yeah.
 Or one of those seasons where life deals you a bunch of lemons and the lemonade you made still sucks.
 Like, okay, like, how do you like be kind to yourself in that?
 Well, how do you be kind to yourself in that?
 Well, I'm so glad you asked Mrs. Jones.
 You're right.
 I've got five things.
 You're ready for number one?
 Number one.
 Number one is you gotta embrace the idea that your limitations are healthy.
 OK.
 Yeah, you gotta embrace your limitations.
 Like you're not God.
 Like if you can, if you can convince yourself that you're not God and that you're okay to have
 limitations, that you're okay to be affected by life, you're okay to have good days, bad days,
 you're okay to be a donkey on the edge, right? From the movie track, you can give yourself grace.
 And if you will give yourself grace, you can actually show grace to other people's limitations,
 which actually will make your life go better too. And if you can find people who are kind to
 to your limitations to, then really you've hit the jackpot.
 Like if your friendship group is good at receiving grace
 and showing grace, you'll be a very wealthy person.
 I was in church this morning,
 and I was thinking about that verse that Jesus talks about,
 like you who, you know, be careful when you see the speck
 in someone else's eyes, that you know,
 you got to remove the log from your own eye
 before you try and help others.
 And I thought, but I was just pondering it,
 and I thought, I wonder if we're so attuned at log spotting,
 is because we're good at identifying the thing we hate
 about ourselves and other people's lives.
  </li><li>Well, probably.
  </li><li>Right, so we're like, ah, in group,
 they don't always have that phrase,
 if you spot it, you got it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like, whatever you're attuned to
 is usually the thing you're most sensitive to.
 Anyway, my number one encouragement is,
 get used to your limitations that you are limited,
 and maybe find your limitations
 and treat them with kindness rather than shaming them.
  </li><li>I just realized, I think I've had a breakthrough
 in this area.
  </li><li>Go on, Tommy.
  </li><li>Well, I would say my most consistent,
 ungodly belief in the last 20 years has been,
 I'm failing.
 So whenever anything would happen,
 my thought would be,
 I'm failing because I'm a bad mom,
 or I'm failing because, you know,
 whatever, I suck at my job,
 or I'm failing because I'm a bad wife,
 or I'm failing, I'm failing.
 But there was like this overriding failure message.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I don't know when it stopped,
 but I feel like it's been some time during COVID.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause I, you know,
 I still have my moments where I'm like,
 oh, I could have done that better, you know?
 But it doesn't, it's not going to that.
 And that's because I'm a failure.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like it's not going there anymore.
 So that's interesting.
  </li><li>That is very interesting.
 And we'll revisit that thought in point number three.
  </li><li>Oh, all right then.
  </li><li>But before we get ahead of ourselves,
 point number two.
  </li><li>Yes.
 so important that in order to be comfortable with your limitations, you have to know your
 limitations. And so point number two is get to know yourself. And I've got three questions
 for you, dear listener. Number one is what are the things that cost you the most? Oh,
 wow. And just try and find any way you can to not have to do those things. What? Just
 the things that cost you the most, right? Like don't do those things. Or have limited
 amounts of those things if you can't completely avoid them.
 Right. So for example, in my life, I outsource our landscaping because as much as I would like to be
 good outside work, landscaping, manual labor, anything that requires some sort of dexterity
 with the power tools, it's literally not my skill set. And I feel stressed. I feel attacked
 in the area of my manhood because it reminds me that I can't do it. Now that's crazy. Like
 I remember you being kind. I remember you and Bill, my friend Bill, giving me the same
 encouragement on the same day. Like I think I was shaming myself because I couldn't do something
 and you're like, babe, you're a brilliant Bible teacher. The plumber is a brilliant plumber. Like
 stay in your lane. Right. And you know, that was kind to me, but I can identify things that I might
 want to do, but there is just it costs me so much. And so I try not to do those things.
 What are the things that cost you so much, easy Jones?
 You might have to help me because I'm, you know, I'm never good at answering stuff like
 right off the top of my head afterwards. I'm like, Oh, I should have said this because that
 would have been what are the things? Probably really large meetings where everybody's talking.
 I've got one.
 Okay.
 Shooting videos when you're on your own, you have to read off an auto queue.
 Oh, I'm horrible.
 I'm so bad.
 It's not that you're horrible.
 It is.
 It's not that you're horrible.
 It's that you have a meltdown.
 I do it awful.
 Ben and Sarah here last week.
 I've got I've got a blooper reel of AJ that can never be released or she will be stripped
 of her organization.
 That's not true.
 You thought that.
 Oh, my God.
 I'll release it.
 Oh, God.
 But you can see the planet.
 It's very frustrated and panicked and whatever.
 Because I'm like, but you like you lose yourself in the minute of it.
 Like you can see that's the point where an AJ is hating being a lot.
 Doing this thing.
 It's not my favorite thing to do.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 But you're also saying large meetings, large groups of people.
 Well, I, because I'm super sensitive to sound and I often feel all the emotions in the room,
 my nightmare is being like trapped in a room with people where it's just really loud.
 Everybody's talking. I can feel everything but not hear any one singular conversation.
 Like it's just, to me, all my senses are going off.
 And fair play, you've done a good job of limiting your exposure to those things.
 Yes. So I'm not saying like refused to ever do those things again, but like because those are the things that cost you. Yeah, like me
 You know, I know that one of the number one fears of people is speaking in public. It is not stressful for me to speak in public
 Maybe not me neither
 But to maybe go go and sit in a wedding reception that would cost me a lot more than doing the wedding
 Yes, right. Yeah, I know myself. Yeah, you know yourself, right?
 So the first question is what are the things that cost you the most and try and limit doing those things?
 What are the things that you can do, but you can also outsource?
 So don't do those things when life is closing in. I'll give you an example for you. Wait, so these are all under number two.
 These are all number two questions. In an effort to know yourself, there's three questions.
 Number one is what are the things that cost you the most?
 Yeah. Number two is what are the things that you can do, but you can also outsource.
 Okay, so you were gonna help me with identifying one of those it's Friday night. Yeah
 One of the things I know you can do you do really well and one of the things that actually at times brings you joy is to cook a meal
 Yes, but there's also times when you're like I would rather
 Yeah, so you can outsource that so take out you know go out for a meal which is our plan until our nine-year-old is like
 I can't do that yes
 But think about the things you can do that you can actually outsource because when you outsource things you actually buy back time
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which is kind to yourself.
  </li><li>That's good, yeah.
  </li><li>And then the last question I'm gonna ask is,
 what are the things that you love,
 'cause those are the things you actually have
 to create time to do?
  </li><li>What are the things that I love?
 Well, this is for everybody, isn't it?
 You're not just asking me what I love.
  </li><li>What, but people who benefit?
  </li><li>What do I love?
 I love, right now I love doing my nails.
  </li><li>I was gonna say, like you have spent all weekend
 recovering doing your nails.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, and at various stages,
  </li><li>Did you look like Freddy Krueger?
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>When I come in and you got the file wrap
 for under your fingers, I'm like,
 what are you doing?
 Is Edward Cesar hands or Freddy Krueger?
  </li><li>Yeah, do you know what happened this morning though?
 I scratched my leg, I don't have dip on my fingernails
 right now, I just went back to normal sharp nails.
  </li><li>I don't know what dip is, you're speaking like I would know.
  </li><li>Any of the ladies will know it's like dip acrylic,
 it makes your nails thicker, but it also makes them
 not as sharp, like they're not as scratchy.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, that's just my nails.
 Their nails are really hard.
 And anyway, so I didn't think about the fact
 that I don't have dip on right now.
 And I usually, I'm careful if I'm not wearing something
 like that to not get too close to my face when I'm signing
 'cause I've scratched myself.
 And then this morning I scratched myself getting dressed
 and just started bleeding everywhere.
 And I was like, oh, that's bad.
  </li><li>That's the things we love.
 Not the things we name.
 But in various seasons.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, I have watched you retreat and do your nails
 most of this weekend.
 And it looks like it's brought you tremendous peace.
 I'm playing a video game at the moment,
 which I'm almost at 100%,
 and I have like a complete or finisher in that.
 We discovered a great TV show
 that we've just kind of like immersed ourselves into.
  </li><li>Oh yes, we have.
  </li><li>Cooking can be something that we both enjoy
 and love and immerse ourselves in,
 or going for a nice meal.
 My point is, by finding it,
  </li><li>What costs you and finding out what rewards you,
 you can kind of change how much attention
 you pay in those areas to either deplete from you
 or reward you.
  </li><li>Yeah, sounds good.
  </li><li>All right, number three.
  </li><li>Number three.
  </li><li>Is what you were talking about earlier.
  </li><li>About the failure thing.
  </li><li>Is, number three is pay attention
 to who your judges are.
  </li><li>So you're my judges are.
  </li><li>Yeah, we all have an internal courtroom
 where there's a series of judges standing around us
 condemning us, rarely if ever praising us,
 but usually condemning us.
 So when you are aware in life that you should do something
 because you're not and you suck and you're failing,
 try and identify who those voices are.
  </li><li>Oh, that's interesting.
 I always figured it was just me, me condemning me.
  </li><li>Well, you learn that somewhere
 and you probably learned to read the early in life
 and it probably became really familiar
 and that's what it sounds like your voice.
  </li><li>Probably, but also I think I judged others
 and became the judge of myself.
 Does that make sense?
 Like, I mean, why can't you just do that?
 You know? - Just suck it up.
  </li><li>Press through, what's wrong with you?
  </li><li>What's going on?
 Yeah.
  </li><li>When you feel the pressure that you should be doing things,
 that's a key that you've abdicated your own responsibility
 and now you're living under the rulership of somebody else.
  </li><li>And they're allowed to know should on you?
 Yes.
 In your head.
 Yeah.
 And you're now being driven rather than simply living.
 Like you're being driven to performance
 rather than just enjoying the life that you're living.
 The sooner you can work out who those judges are,
 you can actually evaluate the source of your stress.
 Okay.
 Like do I wanna keep listening to that voice?
 And PS, some of the voices in your head
 are from people who are no longer alive
 but you're hearing them from beyond the grave.
 I don't mean you're actually literally hearing
 from beyond the grave.
 I'm saying, you're so familiar with it, even though they've gone, the pressure to live like they wanted to is still there.
 Yeah, that's good.
 Yeah, we got dark.
 I just think about this as well.
 I remember Jesus said, "My yoke is easy, my burden is light."
 Yes.
 If you find that you're in a season where the yoke is not easy and the burden is not light,
 it's probably not Jesus who's put that burden on you.
 Right.
 And it's worth investigating who am I living up to?
 And who am I living up to it for?
  </li><li>Yeah, so I mean, I would have to actually look
 at the verse where it sits inside of the context
 and all that kind of stuff.
 I guess I always think of when I think of that verse,
 I do think of what you're saying, but I also think,
 but there is a yoke and there is a burden.
 Like there is still things to be done,
 there is still things to carry,
 it's just if they're now overwhelming.
  </li><li>Right, I would say that,
 rule of thumb,
 I don't know why I did that, rule of thumb.
 Here's my thumb. Look at the rule. That's a general rule of thumb.
 We enjoy our life, enjoy our jobs.
 And people often come to us historically and say, I don't know how you do what you do,
 or I don't know how you move at the pace that you do.
 And we are curious as to what they're talking about.
 Devils come out.
 Out in the name of Jesus.
 What manner of man is this that even her sneezes obey him?
 I always sneezed in twos and threes.
 Everything decently in an order.
 It's blossom season now.
 And I.
 Do you know why I discovered?
 I must have looked really weird.
 But I was on my way.
 I was driving up to a meeting in Brentwood,
 and I was driving our minivan.
 And so I had all the windows open and the sun roof open.
 Beautiful spring day.
 And in the 20 minute drive, it took me.
 I got to my meeting.
 My eyes were itchy.
 My throat was scratchy.
 all my allergies and you know full array.
 It didn't have any claritine, didn't have anything I could take.
 But I did have an N95 mask with me.
 And I thought, well, it doesn't look like block particulates and filter out stuff.
 So by the time I got inside and got into an air-condition building, they all subsided.
 And on my 20-minute journey back, I wore a mask in the car, even though I was on my own,
 with all the windows open, zero allergies.
 So my strategy for beating allergies this year is to wear a face mask.
 I'm gonna go get one right now.
  </li><li>But even Thursday night we went out for dinner,
 me and you went out on a date and we sat outside
 on a patio and I just seasoned, seasoned, seasoned,
 and until I put on my mask and then it just stopped.
 Again, I looked ridiculous.
  </li><li>You did.
  </li><li>Dining with my wife in an N95 mask
 and an outdoor restaurant.
  </li><li>You did.
  </li><li>Well, you were talking about Jesus and yolks
 and I think your yoke and your burden
 is the responsibility of life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And my point was you never want any more,
 you never want to have more responsibility
 than you absolutely have to have.
 And there's a grace that comes with the responsibility.
 And if the grace runs out, you need to check
 the responsibility and who put it there.
  </li><li>Sounds good.
  </li><li>All right, number four.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we got this from our friend Dan.
 Dan Farrelly, the man, the myth, the legend,
 a Bethel church.
 When he came here, one of the first times he came here,
 he's had this great phrase.
 He said, "Your head will lie to you,
 "but your body will not."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>If you consistently ignore your limitations,
 your body will let you know about it.
 sickness, sleeplessness, irritability.
 It's like your body's where I've said,
 "Hey, I need you to pay attention to your limitations here.
 I need you to be kind to yourself."
  </li><li>Yeah, I was thinking, that makes me think of,
 I was saying a couple of weeks ago, I went to go see Dany.
  </li><li>Explain who Dany is.
  </li><li>Dany is my, she's my doctor,
 she's a hormone specialist and stuff.
 I went to do my yearly, she checks all the vitamin levels,
 all the different things and, you know, for the most part,
 everything's great.
 But then, you know, my vitamin D, my iron, whatever are, are,
 the very depleted.
 And she just said, hmm, it seems like you're probably pretty
 stressed.
 And I was like, oh, and that's what it made me think of that
 whole thing of like, hey, guess what?
 Your mind may lie to you, but your body won't, you know, I was
 like, all right, okay, I'll support this better.
 What we're going to say next is, is not rocket science at all.
 It's good because so few of our listeners are rocket scientists.
 So it should be fine.
 I mean, everybody's heard this.
 This is just common sense.
 I am amazed still even those common sense.
 I'm still astonished how much better my life goes for me when I do the three
 things that your mother told you to do sleep well, eat well, move well.
 Exercise sleep healthy diet.
 Like when I get those three things going, like my life is better.
 I don't think my mother told me to do any of those things.
 -Just so you know. -You know.
 I remember my mother would not let me have Kiaora growing up.
 I don't even know what that is, so it's probably wisdom.
 Sounds like some sort of weird thing.
 Kiaora is to orange juice as Ribene is to blackberry juice.
 Gross.
 It was a diluting...
 Well done, Mom.
 We call it a squash.
 I wasn't allowed to...
 I don't know what squash is.
 This stuff's revolting.
 Yes, squash that you dilute with water.
 I wasn't allowed potato chips until I was like 12,
 because my mom said it was bad for me.
 Yeah, we didn't, we didn't eat sugar on a regular basis in our house, which you did, but we didn't.
 Hey, hey, I'm just saying.
 I think I know who one of my judges is.
 I actually had a memory the other, the other week about, you know, we would have
 Jell-O packs, you know, to make Jell-O.
 And because we had like no sugar in our house growing up, I would sneak into the Jell-O packs
 and I would cut a little corner off and I'd be like, and you'd eat concentrated Jell-O.
  </li><li>Yeah, I would just dip my fingers a couple of time
 to taste some sort of sweet thing
 and then I'd like seal it back.
 You know, you didn't really seal it back up
 but I remember getting caught with myself in the jello drawer.
  </li><li>Back to those three things, sleeping well, eating well,
 moving well.
  </li><li>Sleeping well, eating well, moving well.
  </li><li>The biggest lie I think I tell myself
 is that I can get away with just doing two, it was a three.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I can do it for a couple of weeks,
 seemingly with no ill effect.
 But I was amazed.
 Was it Monday?
 Monday.
 I knew it was going to be a hectic week, not just a busy week, a taxing week.
 So I got up early, I got changed into my workout gear, I came down to the other end of the
 basement where we filmed this, where we've got like a makeshift gym.
 And I did 30 minutes of a workout.
 Now, when I say workout, I mean, look at your face.
 When I say workout, I mean doing one of the Apple fitness workouts and there's a bunch
 of them.
 Often on Monday, I'm really lazy, no one to put shoes on.
 So I can't use the treadmill with those shoes.
 So I either opt for doing Pilates or dance.
 And I have a nemesis because he doesn't want to put on shoes.
 But I have an nemesis in Apple Fitness+, his name is Ben.
 Coordination. Oh, Ben.
 Coordination is the boss level I'm trying to be.
 But Ben is one of the dance instructors.
 And I've talked about this before, notably at the Christmas episode.
 But I'm still doing the same routine.
 I'm just determined to get it licked.
 So for 30 minutes, it's not particularly strange,
 but it does get my heart rate up.
  </li><li>Don't you think it would be kind for our members
 if I filmed you doing it?
  </li><li>No.
 Did I send you that TikTok?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'll post for members.
 I'll post a video of--
  </li><li>The equivalent.
  </li><li>The equivalent of me trying to do a dance workout.
  </li><li>It's seriously hysterical.
 Sometimes I just think about grabbing some popcorn,
 coming and sitting on the stairs and watch.
  </li><li>It's so bad, but my point is,
 even though I'm uncoordinated, ungainly,
  </li><li>You're moving.
  </li><li>I'm moving and I came upstairs on Monday
 and I remember commenting you going like,
 babe, it's like magic, just 30 minutes of physical exercise
 and mentally I feel so much better.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And again, I'm preaching to the choir here.
 Like everybody, arguably every single person
 listening to this is way fitter than I am,
 but it just goes to show.
 Like even uncoordinated lumps like me
 can benefit from moving.
 There you go.
 Number five.
 Number five.
 Our last one.
 Sabbath always comes at the expense of something else.
 Yes.
 And what I mean by that is I think I used to think, well, I'll rest when I'm done.
 Like if I can just finish doing all this stuff, then I can rest because I can't
 rest with unfinished stuff.
 Yeah.
 But think about that.
 Like for those of you who are adults with responsibilities, listen to this.
 At what point is parenting done?
 I don't understand your point.
 Keep going.
 Well, what I would think is like, okay, I'm building a chair.
 When I finish building this chair, I will then rest.
 The chair is finished.
 I'll put away my power tools.
 I will now rest and take it easy.
 I used to think that in order to be able to rest, I have to finish the job.
 But so much of the things that I'm responsible for, pastoring, parenting, marriage, etc,
 are never done.
 There's no end point.
 Yes.
 In order to rest, it means you're saying yes to resting, yes to Sabbath, and no to doing things that are actually good.
 Right, but those aren't usually the things that robbed me of my Sabbath.
 Like parenting isn't usually the thing.
 It's like cleaning, you know, or laundry.
 Like the list of things at home that I look around and go, I have got to get this done.
 but also I've tried cleaning and doing laundry while resting
 and that's not actually a thing.
  </li><li>Right, that would be a great example.
 When is laundry for a family of five done?
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, it's never done.
 Because they're always wearing something.
 So at some point you just have to call it
 and just say, I don't care that I haven't done laundry,
 I'm going to rest.
  </li><li>Well, I've lowered the goals really now
 to clean underwear.
 Has everybody got underwear?
 Good, okay.
 the bar.
 The bar.
 The bar has dropped solo.
 It's really low.
 It's like, either way, I'll buy more socks.
 It's not a problem.
 Amazon is my friend.
 The other day, I don't want to shame one of my children, but it's the eldest one.
 The eldest one, who shall remain nameless?
 AJ, AJ ran out a couple of days ago and just said to our eldest daughter, "Hey, can you
 Can you do me a favor?
 Can you go take the basket from the laundry room,
 get all the laundry at the laundry room,
 and sort it all out into piles
 of who's it is and put it in each person's room.
 I don't know, she's told--
  </li><li>And to be clear, I said both baskets
 and what's in the dryer?
  </li><li>Yep, so--
  </li><li>Dry didn't happen.
  </li><li>I didn't hear, I didn't know that.
 I just come in the living room
 and I see my eldest daughter on the floor
 sorting out clean laundry into bundles
 and I'm just like, "Oh my God, this is amazing."
 Like my teenage daughter's taking responsibility
 around that, this is just wonderful.
 So I said, "What are you doing?"
 She's like, "I'm having my mum with laundry.
 "That's great."
 I come back about two hours later
 and there's just many mountains of laundry.
 It's like the French Alps of laundry
 all over our living room.
 And I'm like, and she's playing on the sweatshine.
 I'm like, "Babe, are you done?"
 She's like, "Huh?"
 I was like, "I'm pretty sure mum's task wouldn't end with
 "and then just make sure that you've
 "modeled to split Alps with laundry."
 She's like, "No."
 I said, "Mum didn't tell you to put them
 "in any bedrooms?"
 Like, "No."
 And then, Aji comes home and was like,
 "Why is there a laundry everywhere?"
 I'm like, well, our daughter only heard half the--
  </li><li>That's not what happened.
 We were driving home from, I met you guys for lunch
 and I just suddenly thought,
 'cause I wanna make sure that like,
 it's more helpful for me to know
 it hasn't been done ahead of time.
  </li><li>So you can brace yourself for impact?
  </li><li>So I was like, hey, Abby, did you get the laundry sorted out
 and then brought to everybody's rooms?
 And at which point, you both started go flying,
 both you and Abby.
  </li><li>Well, Abby starts like looking, you know, eyes up,
 whistling innocently, and dying,
 'cause I'm like, this is pretty much
 conversation I had earlier that you denied this was the task.
 And then she was like, "Oh, I don't think I heard the part where I was supposed to bring it."
 And I was like, "Remember?" I said, "Go ahead and put my pile just in the middle of our bed."
 And she's like, "Oh, right."
 Quick note, if we left the story in, it's because we got consent from our daughter.
 Yes.
 Like, you know, halfway through the story, I'm like, "Am I shaming my daughter?"
 Like, I think it's a humorous story. She'd probably call it if I had funny,
 but we will ask her for permission to share this story. So if you hear it, we got consent.
 I mean, gloriously, our girls are learning to do their own laundry, which is wonderful.
 So I just have the boys laundry and yours and mine.
 The other thing you've heard us talk about this, so we won't go into it,
 but your Sabbath is for all three parts of your body, soul and spirit.
 Yeah.
 So it is important that you rest. I forget what day was it? Was it Tuesday?
 It was one of the roughest days of the week, and I knew that you'd you taught all day.
 Yes.
 -verse by verse through. -Ester.
 -Yeah. -I know that you had been running around.
 -I also did the live call. -You asked the live call.
 -For you online. -I thought you were going to be exhausted.
 And so why don't you tell the audience how many man points,
 husband points, I won?
 -Oh, so many. A gajillion. Yeah.
 -Because I anticipated you're going to be exhausted.
 I'm going to not only feed the children
 so that when you get home food is ready.
 -You cook dinner.
 you cleaned the kitchen and you ran a bath.
 So when you came home exhausted, expecting that you were going to have to fix dinner.
 Yes. Instead, you found me sitting on a throne wearing a crown, going, "M'lady."
 I found this wonderful bath ready for me. And I was getting home later again because of the
 live call and everything. So it was just like I was blown out of the water.
 Point of that was not just to exalt myself as a husband, but to point out that minister,
 are not only to your body, but also to your soul and to your spirit.
 And I think you stayed in the bath for like an hour and a half.
 Oh, probably closer to your experience.
 Because when I went and picked up Abi from work and came home, you were still in there.
 All right.
 This, the topic that we're talking about explains why there was no podcast last week.
 Yes.
 Like we just realized we could push through and record an episode, but we'd be blowing
 past our limitations.
 Yeah.
 And it wouldn't be kind to either.
 It wouldn't be kind to us.
 It probably wouldn't end up as a good episode.
 No.
 And we set ourselves up for success.
 So apologies, there was no podcast last week,
 but we were practicing what we're preaching.
  </li><li>There you go.
  </li><li>Any other comments on learning
 and learning and learning limitations?
  </li><li>I don't know, I think what,
 the kind of thing that I often think
 when I am being hard on myself is if somebody else
 told me they needed a break because of whatever it is
 that I need, feel like, oh, I can't do it.
 Would I be like, yes, of course you do.
  </li><li>Right. - Do you know what I mean?
 And so that kind of helps me sometimes
 when I realize, oh, I'm not very good at being kind to myself
 and allowing myself the grace to need a break.
 But actually, if Lindsey were to tell me this,
 or Shannon or one of my friends were to say,
 "This is what happened, and man, I just need a break tonight."
 I'd be like, "Yeah, you do."
 So I sometimes do that just to help myself identify
 if I'm not good at identifying for myself yet.
  </li><li>So let me leave you with this, a question for our listeners.
 What is it that you could say no to this week
 so that you could say yes to having a better quality of life.
 Yeah.
 Because you're more than you're to do list.
 There you go.
 Do you have a listener's question for me?
 No.
 OK, but I have a listener's question for me.
 Oh, do you want to read out?
 Sure.
 I brought my glasses.
 Look at you.
 I know.
 Perfect.
 This is a question from Grace.
 Shint it in.
 It's about finances and teaching the legislative grace.
 All right.
 So this is from Grace.
 I've been really wanting to steward my finances in a more biblical way.
 So thanks so much for your recent episodes on money and tithing.
 I am looking forward to learning more about the course you're launching.
 In the meantime, I have a couple of questions.
 If I own a business, would I tithe on the revenue, e.g. every item sold, or just on what
 I pay myself?
 Also, sorry if this is a dumb question.
 Are the principles you are teaching the same as the prosperity gospel?
 again. So first off, there's no dumb questions. So you asked some great questions,
 our Grace. Thank you for sending that in. The finance course that you're talking about
 would actually be a great example of me recognizing my limitations. It was
 absolutely my intent to launch the finance course called more than enough in January.
 Oh yeah. But in late December, my pastor, Jeff, came and just said, Hey, I'd love you to teach.
 I'd love you to teach four weeks of grace and I don't have money.
 And I was like, I can do that.
 But in order to say yes to that, I had to say no to these things and push them back.
 And again, it's just acknowledging limitations.
 But good news is that course is coming out.
 In fact, I built something new for it this week.
 So should be coming out in the next couple of weeks.
 That's my goal to launch it there.
 If you want to be made aware of what is coming out, go to lnag.com/more.
 That's your questions, Grace.
 You asked two great ones.
 If you're a business owner, our recommendation is that you
 tithe when you pay yourself.
 So anytime you pay yourself a salary,
 or you take money from the business that comes to you,
 tithe on that amount, not on anything else.
 That's straightforward.
 The second question you ask, it kind of depends.
 Like I actually don't know what quote unquote
 the prosperity gospel is.
 I think if you were to ask 50 people,
 you get 50 variations on the same thing.
 But what I've heard, like when I ask people
 who seem to get very uptight about the prosperity gospel.
 And I still like, what is that?
 And it's like this whole notion that God wants you healthy
 and wealthy.
 I kind of chuckle because when you look at the life of Jesus,
 he went around healing all who were sick.
 So he fulfilled at least 50% of the prosperity gospel.
  </li><li>Yeah, he liked the healthy.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And then my other problem is like,
 wealth is a relative term.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm not trying to be sly there,
 but the thing that we get upset about
 is usually an internal arbitrary value that we've set.
 I tell this story before, I should tell on the course
 that I'm launching, and you've probably heard me share this,
 but many years ago I had some members of my family
 stay with me, and we're driving to church one day,
 and when in the car we pull up a set of lights,
 and on the way to church there's a really beautiful subdivision,
 and the people in the car who are with me,
 who are not from America, start tucking,
 you know what tucking is?
 (sighs)
 And I check out, and they're like, are you okay?
 Like I'm thinking, is it too hot in the car?
 Do you mean turn on the air conditioning?
 And my family members are offended and upset
 by the size of the houses that they see outside the window.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'm like so curious, I wanna investigate.
 Like, why is it a personal slight to you?
 And they said, it's excessive.
 Nobody needs a house that big.
 And I remember saying,
 well actually, no people who like have houses that big.
 And they're like, well, not Christians.
 Like not Christians.
 And I just thought it was the funniest thing ever
 because my family, the family who were with me,
 they have a large house comparatively.
 So I part of this, I said,
 "If you had believers come, say, from India,
 where maybe they have one family home
 with three generations living in it
 and they see your house,
 they might have the same reaction.
 Like, I can't believe you have one house
 just for your own family."
 And so wealth tends to become relative.
 I think where I run into problems,
 And I've preached about this at length is I believe absolutely that God wants us blessed.
 I think that's a very, very biblical term.
 And I actually think every Christian believes that God wants to bless his children.
 The difficulty comes when we try and define what blessing is.
 Yes.
 And I think where we run into problems is that blessing and money can't be synonymous.
 And if we try and make blessing and money synonymous, then we've narrowed what blessing
 actually is because there's so much more than money for sure. Similarly in the in the culture
 I grew up in if we try and make blessing solely mean spiritual blessings like salvation and everything
 else as amazing and as thorough a blessing a salvation is we're actually limiting the biblical
 definition of blessing. Yeah, I say all that to say that when the Lord was teaching me the things
 that I've been sharing. I'll admit, I was very, very fearful that I was going to end up a prosperity
 teacher. Even I didn't know what I meant by that. It was just that the Lord was leading me into
 areas of my own discomfort. And that discomfort was more about lack than a theological concept.
 That makes sense? The Lord was leading me out of lack, and lack had been my comfort
 that I became uncomfortable. But what I've since learned is I am very, very comfortable
 in moving out of my comfort zone if it's the Lord who's leading me and encourage all of us to do the same thing.
 Allow the Lord to lead you wherever he wants to go and you're going to be misunderstood by other believers and that's going to be okay.
 Good.
