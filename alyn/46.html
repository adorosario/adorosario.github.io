<p> Good evening. Good evening, mr. Jones. How are you I am well? How are you we shouldn't say good evening because most people listen to this in the morning good morning good morning, baby
 So nice to see you this morning. Did you sleep well? I did I'm I was thinking about this week
 Do you want to tell everybody why<br/>
 Well, that didn't mean to do that, but I am I fell over
 carrying mj onto concrete and so in order to make sure he didn't hit the floor i landed on my knees and elbows and
 script up a little bit just a you're such a good mother.
 Yeah he still cried though but at least he didn't cry from pain he cried because he was terrified and i yelled as i was falling to the ground carrying my son.
 I don't know what the neighbors thought.
 No cuz i was like.<br/>
 We didn't really have much going on this week.
 Margipant came to town to visit.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And we'll talk about Mark in a second.
 You spoke at M&amp;A.<br/>
 Yes, he did speak at M&amp;A.<br/>
 It was really good.<br/>
 And we did take him for coffee and honest roasters.
 And he said it was the best flat light he's had in years.
 Yes.<br/>
 And he experienced a cronut and an asai bowl.
 So did he experience a cronut?<br/>
 Did we not get him a cronut?<br/>
 No, they were out.<br/>
 We were remiss and we tried to cronut him.
 I'm not sure.<br/>
 Cronating is an adjective.<br/>
 Let's never say that again.<br/>
 All our students got back from our reach.
 They did.<br/>
 I can't wait for tomorrow.<br/>
 I know tomorrow when we go and we're going to hear all about them.
 And if you would like to hear similar stories, if you tune into
 Grey Center's web stream next Sunday, or I guess this coming Sunday,
 you'll be able to hear them because they're taking the whole service.
 I'm not sure the students know that.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Well if they listen to a podcast they're gonna know it tomorrow yeah no find it and i'm still in if you look around our office right now there's receipts everywhere yes,
 because random piles of receipts as mine can said receipt or it didn't happen and then Easter.
 Easter and and jay look like a television presenter he did he looked like a new zank or something so cute i got not cute though it was cute everybody thought it was cute yes.
 But that's because they're not him.<br/>
 I was that boy.<br/>
 My parents would dress me like that and it dates terribly.
 So.<br/>
 But he liked it.<br/>
 He liked his tie.<br/>
 He can tell.<br/>
 He's two years old.<br/>
 He has no spatial awareness.<br/>
 Well, he's got to do with it.<br/>
 He's got no self concept.<br/>
 When he's 13 and looks back on those pictures, I guarantee you.
 He's not going to be like mom, dead.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 These are awesome.<br/>
 I hope these photos follow me the rest of my life.
 Yes, he is.<br/>
 He's going to think they're great.<br/>
 And his wife is going to be like, Oh my gosh, you were the cutest two year old
 the suit I've ever seen. It's true. Okay, if it's like one tonight, okay, fine, you're
 deluded. There's not much I can do. All right, do you want to introduce our topic this week?
 Well, this week, we actually are interviewing Mark DePont.
 That's right. We sequestered him while he was here. Yes. We did an interview with him earlier
 this week. We did. And you'll hear about Mark anyway, when you can, when we stop talking,
 and you start listening to him. But do you want to give a quick overview of Mark DePont?
 Well, I've known Mark for about 20 years, maybe a little bit more than that, actually,
 22-ish or something.<br/>
 So I met Mark when he was on staff in Toronto, and he actually gave me a prophetic word that
 really changed the course of my life in many ways.
 That's right.<br/>
 If you've ever heard A.J.'s testimony, you will remember that somebody profs had over
 and I'm not going to give away because he talks about it.
 Oh, you guys talk about it during the interview.
 Anyway, Mark's a friend of ours, a very gift to teach him profit.
 We've known him for a number of years.
 And he was gracious enough for us to just peg him with a whole of the questions.
</p><ul>
  <li>Mm-hmm. It was really fun. - Here you go.
 No, we're very excited that we have our friend Mark DuPont with us.
 For those of you who may not be familiar with Mark's name,
 he has spent the last 25 years?
 33.
 33 years traveling the world, millions of miles logged,
 and a number of nations visited.
 Known for your prophetic ministry,
 you love revival, you love the father's love,
 you love health and vitality in the local church.
 My first question is,
 how on earth did you end up in prophetic ministry?
  </li><li>Yeah, it was way back around 1980, 81.
 And I was somewhat involved in leadership
 of a local church in North San Diego
 that was part of the Jesus movement had come out of that.
 And I was also involved in planting a church,
 starting a new work in San Bernardino area.
 Maybe that was a year later.
 So, but at that time, I really felt a call of the Lord
 on my life.
 And as I got engaged, my wife felt that too,
 for more classic ministry, church planting,
 building up a church, building up infrastructure,
 and maybe then moving on and doing more church planting.
 I thought that was gonna be the future.
 And we had a guy who had been instrumental
 in the Jesus movement and had really
 kinda been gravitating towards more
 George prophetic ministry, come to our church,
 did a Sunday morning, Sunday night,
 and I wasn't even sure at that time
 if I believed so much in New Testament prophecy
 or a prophetic ministry today, hadn't been exposed to it.
 But he and a friend of his came to our church
 and did a Sunday morning, did a really good message.
 I remember on problem of sin and sin of gossip
 and slander and all of that.
 And I thought, oh, this is great.
 And then they announced at the Sunday night service,
 he was gonna speak on the presence of the Lord
 and then have a time of waiting on the Lord.
 And I thought, well, why do we wait on the Lord?
 Is he late for the meeting like we are?
 What does that mean?
 And so we spoke on the presence of the Lord,
 being filled with the Spirit.
 And then he just kind of casually said,
 we're gonna kind of officially end the meeting now.
 And anybody needs, they've wants, they feel free,
 but in about 10 minutes,
 we're gonna go into ministry and worship
 and just open it up to see what the Holy Spirit wants to do.
 And I was intrigued by that.
 And he prayed for a number of people
 you could definitely sense. You know, there was this tangible feeling that something was going on,
 heaviness as it were. And the guy that was with him then came up to me and said,
 you know, this morning I saw you and he said, "I felt God give me a prophetic word for you."
 And again, I wasn't, I was a seminary student at the time and I was involved in church planning.
 I believed in the gifts of the Spirit, but you know, when it came to prophecy, I hadn't really
 seen that. I was a little bit sketchy to me. So I kind of was on my edge. I was saying, okay,
 but secretly I was saying, okay, let me where's the heresy going to be?
 You know, picking up stones quietly.
 Is he going to try to push me, knock me over that kind of skepticism? And he had a very simple
 word and he pointed to the guy who was speaking. And there's a guy that had traveled all over the
 world, Africa, and ministered, renewal, and encouragement to churches. And he said,
 what you see him doing, and what you hear that he's been doing, that's what the Lord's going to
 have you do. And that was it. He just kind of turned, walked away. And it didn't make a lot of
 sense to me. But I felt in my heart of heart that same kind of conviction that God was speaking
 a lot like when I first had given my life to Christ, you didn't understand everything about the gospel,
 but I realized something tangible had happened. There was an area in North San Diego County that
 I used to go running in three or four times a week, some dirt hills with some vineyards. The next day,
 I went there running, finished my run. I was leaning up against my car, just catching my breath.
 All of a sudden, I just saw this overwhelming vision of Jesus standing there in the hills,
 and he was huge and he was smiling at me and he never said anything but the old saying
 is the picture is worth a thousand words. At that point, the Lord was conveying to me
 that he is so much bigger than what I understand or understand any plans for my life. And his
 smile, I mean, it was wonderful to have a sense of Jesus smiling at you, of course,
 but had a sense that he was smiling at me like, "You think you know what I have for
 you. And as I began to pray into it, the Lord began to speak. And there was an opportunity
 coming up. My wife and I were going to be married in early July. And our church had been
 invited to participate with some other churches and send some teams with John Wimber, who was
 the head of the Vineyard movement to South Africa. And all of a sudden, my wife and I,
 we felt like we should go on this trip. And we went and were part of a ministry team and
 Minister there and then afterwards we administered in Norway and I began to get different invitations
 to speak and seminars, conferences, church visits and first in North America and then
 beyond that.
 And over at period of time I realized that there was much more of a grace in my life
 for encouraging churches, building them up through prophetic words, sometimes for the
 church, sometimes for individuals, praying for people, talking about mentoring churches
 and training and equipping the gifts of the Spirit, such as knowing the voice of the Lord,
 healing and worship and prayer.
 And so really, although the banner kind of over our ministry for all these years has
 been prophetic, I see the major call upon us is help encouraging churches and leaders
 to move into greater intimacy with the Lord.
 So here's my question.
 That's fantastic.
 But you said you get this word and I love the word that the guy gave the simplicity of
 it.
 The next day you go out for a run and you have a vision of Jesus.
 Have you had visions before?
 No.
 No.
 And you know, a lot of times we use that word vision and obviously the Bible talks about
 the God speaks through dreams, visions, enigmatic ways through parables and all of that.
 And it's a hallmark of, should be a hallmark of New Testament, Christianity, that dreams,
 visions, prophecies.
 But you know, there are, there have been times I've experienced a few visions that have been
 completely overwhelming.
 You can't see anything else, sense anything else, but just the glory of the Lord.
 But a lot of the pictures the Lord gives me, you know, are in just everyday life.
 You can be driving a car at the same time.
 that doesn't mean you become discombobulated
 or you can cure in a conversation.
 But all of a sudden you realize you're in your mind's eye,
 it just is kind of something's landing upon your brain
 that you're not manufacturing.
 And it's actually the imagination is involved,
 but you're not using your imagination to create that.
 Like you're thinking about,
 oh, I'm gonna, how am I gonna paint this room
 or that sort of thing?
 It's just there as opposed to you thinking it through.
 Right. It arrives on the screen of your mind rather than you put it on the screen of your
 mind.
 Yeah. And I like how Mark Verkler puts it that thoughts and pictures that just land on
 the mind. And you know, in this day and age, we would say God's downloading something.
 Right. Right.
 But had you had that experience before?
 No, I never had.
 So do you, and I'm not trying to put words in your mouth at all, I'm just trying to
 have my fascination with prophetic ministry is helping people who don't know about prophetic
 ministry on the stand for federal government.
 Well, one thing that may tie into that is I had always been aware, even when I was in
 grade school and junior high and high school, that although I didn't have the language for
 it, I had a very, what I would call acute sense of discernment that, and I didn't come
 to know the Lord to a 17.
 But if someone was lying either to me or if you were hearing a speech or on television,
 a politician. If something was off, if there was a lie or a mixed motivation immediately,
 I was able to pick up on that. I just thought everybody can do this. Everybody knows when
 there's hypocrisy. But as I came to Lord and later on, they're in my early 20s, mid-20s,
 I'm realizing maybe this is all tied in with the gifting because true gifting is not just the
 charisma gifting at 1 Corinthians 12, but it's tied in with the motivational gifting we find in
 Romans 12. And the prophetic, there's a lot of artists and inventors, designers out there,
 and some teachers that are coming up with new things, new programs are actually prophetic
 in their personality, even though they might not have a charisma gift or even know God for that.
 Do you think the guy giving you the word opened the door for the vision the next day?
 You know how sometimes some words are a catalyst to God. Do you think that's what happened there?
 Yeah, absolutely. And I think, you know, faith comes from hearing, but sometimes we hear, you know,
 from out of faith. And although I didn't understand it, we sure that with me, I did pray into it.
 And I think that's something that people don't understand about prophetic words and vision is that sometimes when they initially experienced something from God, they're quick to jump the gun and they go off half baked.
 And a lot of times it's a process that takes place over a period of time that if you take a word, you begin to pray into it more and more comes and you get the full thing or wisdom for it.
 It's a lot like when Mary, the mother of Jesus,
 saw the things happen to young boy Jesus,
 she treasured those in her heart.
 And I think a lot of times people are wanting
 to grab a prophetic word and share it
 with their 5,000 best friends on Facebook, you know?
 And rather than treasuring something that God reveals to them
 and by treasuring me, taking care of it, praying into it,
 saying, Lord, what are you doing?
 What are you saying rather than broadcasting
 an immediate layer or just acting rashly
 with a knee-jerk reaction?
 I remember you saying, I love this, it stuck with me.
 I remember hearing you speaking Glasgow
 before we ever knew each other.
 You were at Kevin Pete's church.
 And you said prophetic ministry is often a diving board
 into a pool of prayer.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I love that, like obviously the picture is fantastic,
 but that we often say that, you know, 90%
 of prophetic words given today are invitations.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the dangers most people think,
 that's a dumb deal, what, you know,
 if it's God, it'll come to pass.
 You're like, oh, be very careful of that.
  </li><li>That's a bit of fatalism, isn't it?
 Absolutely, but people are not looking for their part, you know in terms of getting their lives ready and talking to God about it and processing and all that kind of stuff.
 One of my life if I could speak into that a little bit. One of my life verses is 1 Corinthians 2 9 that I is not seen, ears not heard, has not entered into the mind of man, heard of man, all that God has prepared.
 I think a lot of times, number one, when we consider our future lives, we don't take
 into the equation the vastness of God's mind, his creativity, his wisdom, that he quite
 why wouldn't he have more for our lives, not only in heaven but here on earth that we've
 ever considered.
 Like Gideon, all of a sudden secretly beating out a little bit of wheat in the winepress,
 as the Lord, the angel Lord saying, "Hey, I'm going to use your delirination." He had never
 considered that. David, as a young shepherd boy, had never considered that he was someday going to
 be key. I mean, he wasn't even part of the royal family. And there's so much more that God has for
 us in just his goodness, his benevolence, but also his wisdom. But the other factor is,
 if we've grown up in a family without a lot of encouragement, or maybe there's been even
 emotional abuse, like some kids unfortunately are cursed with something like you're never
 going to mount anything. You're never going to be succeed. You're always going to be the
 same. And because of that begins to grip your identity, you look at your life, whether you're
 717, 2747, 87, you think, well, this is it. I'm just going to kind of survive and then
 to get to go to heaven. And that phrase, the prophecy can be, you know, they say that prophecy is
 a confirmation of what you already know. Sometimes it is that, but sometimes it's something you've
 never heard before. And so what do you do? Just dismiss it because you've never heard it or
 automatically obey it. No, you take it and pray into it that diving board. And if it is of God,
 Over a period of time, it's like God dials in your heart,
 pass whatever wounds or rejection or limitations you've accepted over yourself.
 And you can be here at God, say something that are far beyond your wildest dreams.
 Mark, when you're talking about how some people have the perception that
 prophecy is always going to be confirmation, it's never going to be the first time that you've
 heard whatever, because I've heard that so many times, like different people saying,
 Well, yeah, they prophesied whatever, but I've never heard that before and it wasn't confirmation
 or whatever.
 But actually for me, the first time I ever heard that God was going to use my life was
 when you prophesied over me.
 And gosh, I think it was 92.
 I didn't know this testimony till about six months ago with AJ, even though my wife and
 I've known AJ for 22, 23 years.
 But before we got to know her, AJ, as Yilt, you'll know it better than I do, but you were
 suicidal.
 father had recently committed suicide and you had to deal with the aftermath and I think
 even cleaning the blood off the walls.
 You were an insomniac, severe stomach problems, incredible depression.
 You had never been exposed to a meeting with prophetic type ministry and somebody brought
 you to the meeting and you're up in the middle of the meeting while I'm speaking trying to
 to find a seat and I stop and point at you and said,
 what's your name?
 And everybody's looking at you, I can imagine.
 And I said, well, AJ, if you're gonna throw your life away,
 why not throw it to Jesus, see what he wants to do with it?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 But let me say that the context
 because when you said what's your name,
 your immediate heart response was, pff, some profit you are,
 you don't even know my name.
  </li><li>That was what I thought in my head, you know?
 But I'd never seen a prophet.
 So when Sandy said, "That's marked upon, he's a prophet."
 I was like, "What are you talking about?
 This doesn't happen anymore, does it?"
 So when you said, "What's your name?"
 I was like, "Some prophet doesn't even know my name."
 But then you started--
  </li><li>That's funny, actually.
 (both laughing)
  </li><li>I was like, "I'm mocking you in my head."
 But anyway, but you started by saying,
 "A.J. your father's dead and he's not coming back."
 which I've never heard you give a prophecy, anything like,
 that sounded remotely harsh and it didn't feel harsh,
 but the deal was I was completely hallucinating
 and thinking I was seeing my dad in different places.
  </li><li>You had to be carried out of a mall
 because you ran after some stranger.
  </li><li>The week, yeah, well, I don't think he was actually there.
 I was fully hallucinating, but I thought I saw my dad
 and so I dropped everything, I dropped my purse,
 everything started running through the mall going,
 "Daddy, wait, wait."
 Like even though I had identified the body in the morgue,
 even though I had cleaned up the suicide,
 I was now convincing myself of a whole new reality
 and I wasn't sleeping.
 And so that was the week where the mall security
 had come and got me 'cause I had dropped to the floor
 in the middle of the bay, which was like Macy's,
 and just started bawling 'cause I couldn't find him.
 And so they'd removed me and I realized
 I was seeing him all sorts of places.
 And that was the Sunday night that you said,
 you started by saying, "Aja, your father's dead
 "and he's not coming back."
 And for me, that was the thing that made me pay attention.
  </li><li>And then the word continued, something like--
  </li><li>Well, for like 10 minutes.
  </li><li>10 minutes.
  </li><li>You like walk through my life.
 So you said, you know, when you're seven,
 you tried to kill yourself, and when you're 13,
 you tried to kill yourself.
 And you wait.
 So these were all things that nobody in that room knew.
 Like even though I'd been going to the church
 for just a couple months at that point,
 I didn't know you, people didn't know me there at all.
 I was the person that cried by themselves
 in the corner kind of thing.
  </li><li>But you even thought Sandy must have called me.
  </li><li>Well, but Sandy didn't know that stuff.
  </li><li>Oh, she didn't.
  </li><li>I mean, people didn't know me.
 I was completely a shadow of a person.
 Like I was shut down, I didn't talk, I didn't, you know.
 So I was just sitting there going,
 how can he know this?
 Like, so it totally got my attention,
 'cause in my mind, I'm like,
 if you know this, then you're hearing God.
  </li><li>And then during the ministry time, you ended up,
 and you had never seen this before,
 you just collapsed from the power of the Holy Spirit.
 on you on the floor laughing uncontrollably.
  </li><li>Yeah, but you finished the prophecy by saying,
 "Aja, if you do, I see your gold box
 "and I see letters in it."
 And I had written suicide notes.
 I had just decided I can't stay, I can't take it anymore.
 And I'd written all these letters
 and I'd put them in this little gold box.
 And you said, "I see a gold box and I see letters in it
 "and I hear the Lord saying,
 "if you don't want your life,
 "why don't you give it to him
 "and see what he will do with it?"
 And I see you traveling the world
 and I see God using your life to heal others.
 And I remember thinking, "Dude,
 Now you've now you've completely gone off the rails like the first stuff that was definitely God
 But if you I mean I can barely brush my teeth in the morning
 So I don't know why you think God could use me
 But you're cute and so then I sat back down because you just went right back into preaching and I was shaking holding onto this tear like terrified
 So Sandy like pulled me into my seat and then at the end you told me to stand up that you wanted to pray for me
 And you got about a meter apart you didn't even touch me and I hit the floor
 And I'd never seen somebody's laying in the spirit
 So I had no idea why I was on the floor and I was shaking and then I started laughing and I laughed for like 45 minutes
 And you prayed over me and then you went on and prayed over, you know other people
 And when I got up off the floor that day never struggled with eating disorders
 suicide anything from that day on and as well I think you said you were healed of depression
 Yeah, I mean like like all the suicidal all the all that negative thinking it never came back never Wow
  </li><li>Wow.
 And that's obviously a great picture of,
 there are times, God gives words,
 that are not confirmation,
 they're just so out of the ballpark, they're more.
  </li><li>That was not confirmation at all.
  </li><li>They're more than our eyes have seen,
 more than our ears have heard.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think, in really in response to,
 this question, the tension between,
 is prophecy always confirmation can be more than that?
 We do not limit God because he is just so vast in his mind, his wisdom, his creativity
 for our lives.
 And you know, well, I love, I mean, obviously I love that story so much.
 I have a wife because you gave that word.
 I mean, well, any sense of hyperbole.
 That's a line in the San day for me, you know.
 Oh, yeah.
 I mean, so I love that story for so many reasons.
 And I've heard AJ share that story all over the world.
 I never cease to weep when I hear that because for me, authentic prophetic ministry is the
 kindness of God on display. There's no getting around it. And if you think about prophetic
 protocol, I mean, you teach people how to prophesy all over the world, we teach people
 to minister, you would never have something started prophetic word. Their opening lines
 are, your dad's dead and he's not coming back. But what nobody else knows in the room
 is that the kindest message her little heart could hear. She's delusional. She's not sleeping.
 She's fabricated an entire existence of her dad who is dead. And that snapped her out
 with that and gave her the okay, what do you have to say?
 And then even the walking through my life stuff, it was like you got my attention with that
 first statement, but then I was like, you must hear from the Lord because nobody knows
 this.
 That was, I mean, so it was just, yeah, life changing.
 Amazing.
 Well, it's interesting.
 And through one of the prophets God said, he speaks to people through dreams, visions,
 but also parables.
 And the word parable in the original language
 is made up of two words that really has connotations
 of the known and the unknown.
 And so when Jesus would give parables,
 he'd talk about things like taking care of the sheep
 or fishing or the woman cleaning her house
 and finding the missing coin.
 They all had elements of everyday life
 that people could really understand,
 but then there would be the element of the Dama
 of parables that was just completely,
 it didn't fit with what people thought.
 And we live in a day and age,
 people want instant information,
 they want everything laid out black and white,
 but quite often God does speak through dreams,
 visions, prophecies, and parabolically,
 because he wants us to think, he wants us to pray.
 And I love that verse in Proverbs says,
 it's the glory of God to conceal them matter.
 And it's the glory of a man or king to seek out that matter.
 And so part of the prophetic is through emerative ways,
 but saying, Lord, what are you doing?
 What are you saying to draw closer to the Lord?
  </li><li>There is a incredible misconception surrounding prophecy
 that people would hear you give a word like that
 and think, dear God, he knows everything.
 But what people don't realize is, and I'll ask you this,
 but I'm fairly sure I know the answer is,
 often when we're prophesying, we do prophesy in part
 and we know in part, but we don't know
 the sum total of the revelation we're giving.
 We're giving it, and by the mercy of God it fits.
 I mean, I would be very surprised
 if you were standing up there going,
 "I totally know how this fits."
 You're just giving what you've got as the messenger,
 and of course it lands in a heart.
 But the, and this is one of the things I love about you, Mark, is that stuff can go to your head.
 You know, it's very easy for people to be like, oh my gosh, you must know everything.
 And the truth is no, I don't know everything.
 Are you kidding?
 Like, I, you know, I get a download and often I don't even know how the download fits.
 And part of the joy, of course, in prophetic ministry is people coming up at the end going,
 you have no idea how that minister.
 And you're like, please tell me because you're giving the, these fragments that you have.
 And of course it means more to the person receiving it because it's about them.
 Right.
 And I think you're, you know, I really want to honor you, Mark, because you've handled
 yourself very, very well in not playing into that mystery.
 I remember Steve Thompson from Morningstar encouraging young prophetic ministers saying,
 please don't be weird.
 Like the prophetic is weird enough without you adding to it.
 It's weird that you would know all that stuff about a complete stranger.
 It's weird that you would know when she tried to kill it.
 I mean, that's, that's disconcerting, but you've done such a great job.
 I would say you're one of the most normal prophets I know.
  </li><li>Well, there's, you know, and this is,
 I'm a lifelong student of the Bible,
 and I always encourage people that if they wanna go deeper
 into prayer and prophecy, they also need to go deeper
 into their knowledge of the written word, the Bible.
 But no matter how much we learned about God,
 and I like what Eugene Peterson said about
 systematic theology, that that phrase is an oxymoron,
 that there are certain tenets of the faith, such as salvation of by grace, the infallibility
 of the Word of God, and so on, and so on, the virgin birth and resurrection. Those have
 to be spelled out. They have to be deeply rooted foundationally. But we dare not do
 away with the mystery of God. And I like what years ago, John Wimber, maybe the
 brothers before him that said it, but biblical faith is spelled R-I-S-K.
 And when we give a prophetic word or when you're sharing the gospel with a complete stranger,
 or maybe your neighbor's little child comes down with leukemia and you send in your heart,
 you should volunteer to pray for them even that child, even though the family might not
 know the Lord.
 There's always risk because there's always a mystery involved of how God works.
 And I would be the first to say that a lot of times, in fact, most of the time when I'm
 profsend over people or a church, there's very much a mystery.
 I don't always understand how it fits, or even if I do understand, my gosh, how are
 they going to make this happen?
 I think part of the prophecy is you alluded to, AJ, that first one of you, wish you were
 going to go to the nations.
 How many nations have you been to?
 We counted it up together.
 Together it was like 42, but me, myself, over 30.
 So you've, you know, I didn't know you and I don't didn't know whether you even knew
 the Lord at that time.
 I didn't know whether you were a Bible school student or in ministry or I was a waitress.
 Yeah, I didn't know you were struggling with suicidal depression things.
 And so to me, it's revelation, what we call a trans rational information that God is
 is downloading that you know what you're hearing,
 but there's a great mystery involved with the rest of it.
 And so I think we never wanna confuse being a messenger
 with being the one who inspires the message.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think that's awesome, Mark.
  </li><li>I have another question just about your testimony.
 A.J. and I have been talking a lot on the podcast,
 our listeners will know this,
 and I spoke at church on Sunday,
 something similar to this.
 It sounds like you got this word,
 you got this vision from the Lord,
 and it sounds like you started heading in this direction.
 I love what you said.
 It seemed like as I ministered,
 there was a grace upon my life for X.
 Talk to me about the transition from beginning to operate
 prophetically to entering, and I'm not sure if we're
 comfortable with the phrase, the office of a prophet,
 but presumably at some point along that continuum,
 people start coming to you and telling you what you are.
 Did you wrestle with that?
 Was that struggle?
 Was that terminology weird for you?
 At what point were you comfortable with going,
 I guess I'm a prophet?
 Like how was that?
  </li><li>Well, a couple of qualifying thoughts there
 and on a very practical note,
 in the original language, as I understand it,
 there is no actual word for office.
 What it's talking about is ministry.
 And ministry is serving people.
 And that word was used because it appeals to a lot of people to, quote,
 have a position, you know, authority.
 And that's, that's not necessarily what ministry is about.
 But, uh, and the other practical consideration is, is I never go around
 introducing myself as a prophet.
 I don't use that label.
 I talk about it.
 I don't think I've ever heard you introduce yourself as a prophet.
 But everybody refers to you as a prophet.
 Yeah.
 So, but I love that.
 But again, but to continue that thought, you know, I hear people say,
 sale the time that they're an apostle, they're a pastor, they're this or that. And I think the
 highest calling upon us is because of Jesus Christ to be a son or daughter of God, to be able to
 call out in your heart Abba Father as Paul talked about. And you know, at the end of the day, I think
 there's not going to be teachers, preachers, evangelists, you know, in the test of time and
 eternity like there is here on earth and we're going to realize that we've already been given
 the greatest title we can be given which is the sons of God because of Jesus.
 And I love that and that's why you're so close to our heartmark because we love that.
 We love that you in all the years we've known you you've never fought for a title or a position.
 And when we see that it you know it grates against us so understand that completely and love your
 your heart totally agree with you.
 And yet at some point for you to fulfill what God's got for you.
 I'm asking this rather than stating this,
 you have to begin to agree with him about how he sees you.
  </li><li>So you have to agree and in your heart
 even embrace the function God calls you to.
 So I think that's rather than the title,
 I'd like to talk about the function
 of a prophetic ministry or a vein.
 Whatever it may be.
 And the problem was in the early 80s,
 we didn't have a lot of resources back in those days,
 even about the basic use of the charisma gift of prophecy,
 let alone a prophetic ministry to the church at large.
 John Sanford's book, The Elijah Task,
 it was, you know, we just read that and reread it
 and reread it, you know, and it was great in many regards.
 But what really helped me,
 what was really important was the church I came to the Lord in in 1974. It was an evangelical
 movement that the youth of that church had been impacted by the Jesus movement. So there
 were a lot of high school and college age kids coming to the Lord. That church was not
 open to the gifts of the Spirit, the charisma gifts, but it had these two great values. They
 love evangelism and they love the Word of God. And so I got steeped in the value of the
 Word of God as our anchor in life, the logos, Jesus, the Word. And what, as I began to believe
 in prophecy and start moving, and it's not that I haven't made mistakes of the years,
 I certainly have, but what I believe has been a mainstay for me is the realization that
 the Holy Spirit is not schizophrenic.
 He will never say anything contrary to the scriptures
 which he inspired.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so, and even not just going off on a small tangent,
 but directional tangents, you know,
 that the goal, you know, and even when we talk about,
 there are personal prophecies such as God is wanting to you
 to step up into this gifting or bring healing in this area
 or he has this for you.
 But I believe the heart of all prophecy is rooted in revelation.
 19, my mind's gone blank, 19 verse 10, I think it is,
 that the spirit of prophecy is the testimony of Lord Jesus.
 And so whether directly or indirectly,
 there should always be an aspect of prophecy
 that's pointing to the person of God,
 that not pointing to us, oh, I want to get this
 and what do I want to do with it?
 But how can I more fully be in the will of God?
 How can I more fully lay down my life for Jesus?
 And so that to me is, as we began to start,
 I had a lot of friends at that time
 in the early 80s began to not only start
 moving in prophecy, but go into other churches
 and then start teaching on prophecy
 and prophesying over people
 and giving prophetic words for churches.
 We did make mistakes and that's human nature.
 anything, including the spiritual gifts as we grow.
 If our hearts are the right place, we learn from our mistakes.
 To stay focused, the central thing was whatever we're doing,
 it has to be in line with the Word of God and the Bible.
 And it has to be always coming back to the love of God,
 the Father, the person of Jesus, and consistent
 what the Holy Spirit's already said through the scriptures.
 I know that you and John Paul Jackson were ministry colleagues.
 You were friends, you ministered a lot together,
 you share a lot of the same values.
 You wrote a brilliant white paper on prophetic ministry
 together along with other people.
 I was watching his memorial and it was fascinating to me
 to watch a long time friend of his.
 And he said, you know, I knew John Paul
 when he was not in ministry.
 The two of us would drive together to work.
 He was an executive for a large American firm.
 He said, "But I always felt like John Paul
 should be in ministry.
 And any time I tried to encourage him in that,
 John Paul would, oh no, I'm not prophetic.
 I couldn't be in ministry, this, that, the next thing."
 And so clearly he got over that struggle.
 Clearly he was like, okay God,
 maybe you do have a call from you in this.
 And I commented on Sunday, I thought,
 praise God he overcame that voice
 because what a tragedy would be,
 how do you live that lie?
 I'm not prophetic.
 But what I found in speaking to many prophetic people
 is that they've struggled with that lie of,
 well, I'm not really prophetic.
 Either because of comparison,
 I'm not prophetic because I don't prophesy like X
 or I'm not prophetic because I don't get revelation like that.
 Was that ever a struggle for you and your journey
 into the prophetic ministry?
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, certainly.
 And I know that by the late '80s,
 by that time our ministry internationally
 began to be established, I was traveling,
 You know, a hundred, 120, 130 days a year
 and had a lot of open doors and people that I respected
 that were really receiving our ministry.
 But then when I looked at some of the other well-known
 prophetic ministries out there,
 I was just at times in awe of how God used them.
 I kept thinking to myself, I'm not like this person.
 I'm not like that person.
 And what really helped me, and this is something
 I've taught a lot about over the years,
 But out of David's writings and prophetical writings,
 I think out of Psalm 139, where he said things like,
 "Even in my mother's womb, the hand of God
 "was fearfully and wonderfully upon me."
 And I began to, it really became firm in my heart
 that God doesn't create any of us
 to be exactly like anybody else.
 He puts great intentionality into his creation of us
 and even the gift package.
 You know, it's interesting you mentioned John Paul.
 I was, it was just a crazy season, a month or two ago,
 and I'd been asked to go to the memorial for John Paul.
 I wasn't able to go.
 I was just, would have wreaked havoc with everything.
 That's another story.
 But a guy who had been on his board,
 the day he passed away, I wrote a tribute to him
 on our ministry Facebook account.
 And a guy who had formerly been as bored,
 posed a statement in the comments
 to that post that, well, who's gonna pick up John Paul's
 mantle and run with it?
 And without wanting to be condemning or parental anyway,
 I said, hopefully nobody,
 because God never does the same thing twice.
 And I said, the question is,
 and I said, this is even what John Paul,
 his whole training and focus was about,
 was to help each believer rise up in the gifting,
 the unique gifting God has for them.
 I said, that's how we can carry on John Paul's ministry.
 Let's encourage believers to find out who they are,
 uniquely in God and carry on.
  </li><li>And it takes off all that pressure, doesn't it?
 Because I am the worst Mark DuPont impersonator.
 Like I'm not called to walk in your ministry
 and in your shoes.
  </li><li>Praise God.
  </li><li>But you're also a terrible AJ Jones imitator.
 And there's a huge freedom in resting in the comfort and the knowledge that, you know,
 we're sons and daughters.
 I get to be a son.
 My, my, your greatness doesn't impinge upon my greatness.
 It's not a greatness quota.
 And because you've got more of it, that's how I get less of it.
 And there's not a shortage in a heaven.
 And I think that comes from a revelation of the father's love too.
 Yeah.
 It's not somehow a second tier awesome.
 It's we're all awesome because we're created in the image of God and we have different functions
 and we have different roles and it's amazing.
  </li><li>You know, in the parable, Jesus told about the wealthy master,
 the steward's and the talents in Matthew 25,
 there's something incredibly important
 that oftentimes is not taught on or recognized.
 And everybody talks about, well,
 there was the one to begin five talents.
 He doubled it, and I said, well done,
 good and faithful servant, here's more besides.
 And then the one with, they'd given two or three talents too,
 but then he got angry at the one
 who hid his talent and called him wicked and evil.
 And so there's always this focus when that is being preached.
 You've got to be responsible with your gifts.
 And yes, that's true.
 But there's a secondary point in that parable
 that I believe is very critical that we grasp
 in that the one who'd been given the two talents
 had only gained two more,
 not gaining five more like the one who became five,
 but his reward was the same.
  </li><li>Right.
 You know the master said exactly as he said to the one with five well done good and faithful serve you and faithful the few things
 Here's more besides now enter into the joy of your master
 And at the end of the day if if each of us is obedient with the gifts the opportunities and the situations God gives us
 Our reward is going to be the same the joy of the master and so that takes the pressure off
 That I haven't been given the gift package you've been given or anybody else and so God's not expecting me
 Right. I mean what if in a Christian's lifetime they led 50 people to the Lord Jesus
 That would be remarkable and they're feeling pretty good about themselves and the judging of the saints
 You know and then all of a sudden they realize Billy Graham is standing in
 And all of a sudden 50 doesn't look so good, but yet they've never received the calling
 The opportunities and the gifteens that Billy Graham received and but yet, you know, I'm saying I do
 I can see the guy tap and I'm Billy Graham sure. Do you mind if I just go in front of you?
 Yeah, it's gonna work out better for both of us. Trust me. Yeah, or can you just assign me a few souls by proxy?
 You're something. Oh, I love that. That's amazing
 When you and other prophets get together do you ever play poker together? And if so is the repoint
 The old question is when two prophets meet each other one says,
 "Well, I know how you are, how am I doing?"
 You know, and the thing, this is a phrase that gets thrown around a lot,
 especially in the last few years, it seems like people are saying, "I'm prophetic."
 And they may move a little bit in the charisma, gift or prophecy. No, you're not prophetic.
 You are prophetic when you prophesy, you're prophetic in what you're doing.
 But you know, as far as speaking about men, we all put our pants on one leg at a time.
 We all use hands and forks to pick up our eating utensils or chopsticks.
 We're all human beings. And I recently have been rereading in the Old Testament some of the
 writings of Solomon and about the reign of Solomon. And it really struck me. There's a couple of
 passages where it says under the reign of Solomon, the people, they had plenty to eat,
 plenty to drink and they were happy. And when you read through like Ecclesiastes and some of the
 other not only writings of Solomon but about his reign, it just talks about enjoying the goodness
 of life. And because there's so much brokenness in society today, so many people coming from broken
 families not known as fathers love or mothers love, it seems like we're trying to almost get
 artificial with our spirituality. And there are times, you know, and I've even experienced this,
 uh, like a few times behind leather jackets, for example, when God has spoken to me, he's done a
 sign and a wonder out of that or thing. But you know, the reality is God created life to be enjoyed.
 And so we can sit down, have a meal together, we can encourage one another, we can have fun
 together, and we don't, we can be spiritual in who we are, as opposed to, you know, getting all
 spooky and weird and thinking, well, I'm prophetic.
 Well, let's start by being humans.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Maybe that's prophetic
 to be a fully alive human, you know?
  </li><li>We have a dear friend, you may know him, Chip Judd,
 and he has this great phrase, he says,
 "Surely, one of the side effects of the anointing of God
 "is that we just become nicer people."
 Like, forget all this, you know, are you a better husband?
 Are you a nicer dad?
 Are you fun to be with for dinner?
 And some people would think that's a low, you know,
 low part of the anointing of God, but I've met quote unquote anointing to people who
 are just jerks.
 Yeah.
 You know, and I'm like, I fully agree with you.
 Who are those people?
 Let's talk about it.
 Yeah.
 Let's do an alphabetical list.
 You know, that would be fruitful.
 You know, and I would say my wife and I, you know, in 33, almost 33 years we've been
 married and we have friends all over the world, very close friends, dear friends like in
 South Africa and England and parts of Europe and Canada. And we've noticed something that
 the people were closest to, not only do they have a deep love for God and love serving God,
 but they love to laugh. They enjoy a good meal. And I mean, they're real.
 And so that God has created us to be supernaturally natural. We don't need these titles and errors
 and this cloak of mysticism to walk around in.
 I love that Mark, because you're so prophetic.
 You've read through my list of questions and answered them before I asked them.
 But one of the questions I did have on here is what brings you the most joy.
 Well, in ministry, if I could talk about that, what really gets me excited is when I walk
 away from a meeting and I know in a real way people have encountered the presence of the
 Lord.
 And I'm not talking about feelings, you know,
 whether people have an emotional vibe or not.
 But sometimes we have breakthroughs and worship
 where all of a sudden you realize
 there's a heightened awareness of the presence of God there
 and people walk away, their hearts are changed.
 You know, the Kingdom of God is righteousness, peace,
 and joy in the Holy Spirit.
 And you see people that have been living with difficulty
 or stress or trauma walking out of that meeting.
 There's, you can sense the peace of God.
 They've got something that they didn't have when they walked in or the joy of revelation
 the Father's love.
 I was sharing last night in the emanate meeting here in Franklin with your church that just
 the night before when we were in a church in Venice, Florida, a lady who she testified
 in 40 years now, she'd not be able to take more than five steps without assistance using
 the walker or a wheelchair that she was so completely healed in her legs and her hips
 her knees her back that she was running around the room.
 And she had not been able to walk as I said more than five steps without assistance in
 40 years here she is running.
 And of course that's a great miracle but as I interviewed her and she's testifying she
 She doesn't know what her laugh or to cry.
 She's just beside herself in the goodness of God.
 My second daughter, her name is Taylor, and she graduated in May of last year from Miami
 University in Oxford, Ohio with a degree in political science and also minor in entrepreneurial
 business.
 And for whatever reasons, you know, the Lord knows she has done a lot of interviews.
 And even though she's done some interning in Washington the past, she just over the last
 nine months or so, 10 months has not been a landed job.
 And she's had some great interviews in different cities.
 But we just got word yesterday.
 She's just landed a really great job.
 And the realm of politics where her heart is at.
 And of course, as a father, you have a unique joy of your children.
 I was just so stoked, so excited. I still am today. And I think that what brings God the father joy
 is when he sees his children. You and I come to know him, walk in his ways. As Moses said,
 "Teach me your ways, Lord, than I might know you," to turn away from lifestyles or habits that
 are destructive, you know, the Bible calls sin, but enter into the goodness of God, know him.
 As Paul talked about the height, the width, the breadth, the depth, the depth of God take great joy and seeing us know him.
 And for me, what brings a lot of joy is whether in worship or in ministry to see life changed.
 You know, that's the whole goal.
 You know, and so, and as well, you know, just in the natural, one of my passions is motorcycle riding.
 And when I'm with some good friends, we're hitting some really good curves in the mountains.
 and the sun is shining and it's not too hot or not too cold.
 You know, it's just, it's, yeah, it's just a killer for me.
 You know, I know that you like good food and I'm getting hungry.
 So I suggest we say thank you very much for your time and we go get some tacos.
 Hallelujah and amen.
 All right.
 Well, I hope you enjoyed that.
 We have, we didn't actually end up going for tacos.
 No, we didn't go for a taco.
 I didn't know what we ate.
 Oh, I remember what I ate.
 We went to graze.
 Yeah, it had pimento cheese in it.
 We went to graze and they were playing
 Bethel worship music at grace.
 Okay, but we still didn't have tacos.
 No, we didn't, but we did have good food.
 We did.
 I've got some listeners questions.
 In fact, I got a great listeners question,
 but because this week's podcast is already too long,
 we can't talk about it the next week.
 We've got a great question about being single
 wanting to get married and how you handle your heart
 and that, so we'll talk about that next week.
 Perfect.
 This week's question is from Danny.
 And he or she says this, "El and Asia, I come from the younger generation.
 I've been told by some people of the older generation that they feel bad for my generation
 because we have to continue to live in America and the world while it goes to hell."
 Wow.
 Some of these people are believers.
 I have been told not to have children because the world is going downhill so quickly.
 I believe God uses my generation and wants to use the older generation to bring a shift.
 How do I handle these criticisms thoughtfully and respectfully?
 And how do the younger adults not feel discouraged?
 Well, I'm kind of surprised by the question.
 I guess I've never heard the "don't have children" because the world is going to hell
 argument before.
 Well, you have probably just caged differently.
 Yeah, but people don't want to go to school or don't want to go into life with Christ
 is returning. And he is returning, but he's been returning for quite some time.
 And you don't know the time or the hour. Right. And Jeremiah 29, 11 says his thoughts
 towards your filled with good things and optimism. So I wouldn't let the discouragement of other
 people and their perspective dissuade you from embracing the goodness that God's put before you.
 There's a brilliant parable that Jesus tells in Matthew 13, I think, where he talks about the
 the wheat and the tears. And the wheat and the tears grow up together. And the parable
 there is, as the world gets darker and more wicked, the good news is God's righteousness
 and the righteousness of a saint also grow brighter and brighter and brighter. So be
 encouraged, the darker things get, the brighter your light will shine. Yes. And also my encouragement
 to you is from Acts 17 where it says, "God determined the time and the exact place where
 you would live."
 So he didn't bring you into this world just so that you could get a front row seat to
 the world sliding into hell.
 He built you with a purpose and with great excitement and looks forward to your sunny
 smile and your brilliant life laid out before you.
 So it's going to be amazing.
 So hopefully that's an encouragement to you.
 I don't know who these people are, but maybe somebody probably told them the same things
 when they were younger.
 Right.
 So don't be like them and spend the rest of your life thinking like that because then
 you'll be old and grumpy.
 Anything else, baby?
 No, I just wanted to say thank you.
 Last week I asked people to go to iTunes and leave some feedback.
 Thank you for those who did that.
 Really, really appreciate it.
 It just helps us feed the iTunes machine.
 If you have a question for us or if you'd like to suggest the topic that we talk about
 for the podcast, go to allen and AJ.com/ask
 and we'd love to hear from you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>All right, we hope you have an incredible week.
 Thank you for joining us.
 We'll see you next week.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Good night.
 Good day.
 Good morning.
 Goodbye.
 Bye.
