<p> I'm good how are you I am fantastic as you say in the French speaking part of Canada okay
 how come you don't speak French have we covered in the podcast I mean you grew up in a nation
 that is literally bilingual. Everything is in French and English.
 It's true.<br/>
 And you didn't pick any of it up?<br/>
 Well, I can understand quite a bit of it. Like if I'm hearing a conversation,
 I can probably understand most of the conversation. But I can't actually speak it.
 Like I didn't retain the words to go, "Oh yes, I say this for this."
 And I think the deal for me was in high school, I had dyslexia and...
 So you were having a hard enough time with English?
 I was having a hard enough time and the Lord healed me of that, which was amazing.
 but not in time for me to not hate French.
</p><ul>
  <li>I just love French.
 I wish I spoke it better.
 I drive everybody who does speak French nuts
 because I insist on trying to speak to them in French.
 And I basically butcher the language,
 but it's a beautiful language.
  </li><li>I think you do pretty well.
 I think also-- - You don't speak French.
 You have no idea how badly I'm doing.
  </li><li>Okay, well, I have heard people speak French
 for the majority of my life.
  </li><li>Okay, too sure.
  </li><li>And my aunt lived in France and my uncle was French.
 So I did hear a lot.
  </li><li>You know what?
  </li><li>I consider I've been put down.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>You've made your point.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I also think,
 you know how teachers really matter
 in what you end up liking?
  </li><li>We.
  </li><li>I don't think I ever had a French teacher
 that wasn't mean as a snake.
 (laughs)
 So it seemed like all the way through school,
 whenever you'd go to French,
 you'd just get the people that didn't seem
 to be friendly, or at least I did.
 So I think I just, as soon as I could drop French
 and I didn't have to take it, I dropped it.
  </li><li>All right, good sidebar on the phones.
  </li><li>There you go.
 You started this week at emanate teaching on something I thought I was going to be bored
 tears on no offense.
 Thanks.
 Because your whole thing was lessons from gardening with God or something equally as cheesy
 and I was like, "What?"
 But it was actually amazing.
 I don't say actually like you surprised me that you were good.
 When you were sharing with me what you're going to be talking about, I was like, "Really?"
 But there was some profound stuff in there.
 Thank you.
 All the stuff you're learning from gardening.
 Yeah, I'm learning so much stuff.
 And you genuinely are enjoying gardening.
 I really am.
 That's so weird.
 And it's so funny because I totally judge my mother as growing up.
 I was like, "Why do you like gardening?"
 Like, just go to the grocery store, get over it.
 But there's something about it being the stuff that you grew and it tastes so much better,
 which I never knew, but it really does.
 And no word of lie, we would easily spend.
 This is embarrassing.
 How much would we spend just on fresh herbs from Whole Foods?
 Every time you go to Whole Foods and you pick up a little box of basil,
 how much would that cost?
 Because it wouldn't just be basil.
 I'd be buying cilantro.
 I mean, I use a lot of fresh herbs because I cook most things from scratch.
 So I would say at least $10 every time we go.
 So not unusual to spend $30 in a week on herbs.
 Oh, yeah.
 And now you get it all for free.
 Yeah, it's all growing in my garden, in my pots and in my, and then like just we go through tomatoes,
 like a crazy person I haven't had to buy tomatoes in probably a month.
 I've been eating those cherry tomatoes like candy.
 Oh, they're so good.
 They are.
 Yeah, and it's been fun. It really has been like, it's like I do something and I'm, you know,
 I'm, we're lucky we have neighbors that help us with share your faux pas.
 A million things. Oh, I should, I totally should.
 but we have the most wonderful of neighbors and didra comes over and grants me wisdom on what to do and things like that and then what we can't figure out together the Holy Spirit is great at saying hey do this hey do that.
 And then after I've done this or that you know I'll find out from somebody oh yeah that was exactly the right thing to do so it's really fun.
 It's really, really fun. You want me to tell my faux pas?
 Yeah, walk in the light.
 Well, so here's the deal. The first sort of month of having the garden,
 I was having to go out and weed it a lot.
 And we should clarify, when you say garden, because in Britain, what we would call our backyard
 would be our garden. In America, like we have a large grassy area with trees and bushes and
 shrubs, that's not our garden. They would call that your backyard or your lawn.
 but on the lawn you have raised gardens.
  </li><li>I have three raised gardens, therefore by eight each,
 if that matters to anybody.
 So I have three kind of large raised gardens.
 And I planted a bunch of tomato plants
 and some watermelon and zucchini and stuff like that,
 most of which was given to me by friends
 'cause I thought I've never gardened before.
 And so I don't wanna spend a whole bunch of money on plants
 if I'm going to kill them.
 So I didn't really buy very many plants.
 I just planted like little, what looked like,
 are these actually gonna become a plant?
 They look so small and, you know, tiny.
 Anyway, so they grew and now I have an overgrowing garden.
  </li><li>You were telling us about the faux pas?
  </li><li>Oh yes, the faux pas.
 So the faux pas was, when I first planted the garden,
 I was doing a lot of weeding and finding a lot of grass
 coming up and that kind of stuff.
 And so I was having to go out there for like, you know,
 maybe a couple hours a week and pull stuff out.
 And I ended up having this conversation with Deidre about,
 I think I'm gonna end up with tons of tomatoes
 and cucumbers and zucchini and stuff.
 So go ahead and take anything, you know?
 And she said, "Oh, well, you know, we'll weed for food."
 And I went, "Ha, ha, ha."
 Well, so fast forward, life gets really busy.
 Your dad passes away.
 I lose track of, you know, sort of what's going on.
  </li><li>Sure.
 And I realized like I go down to check my garden after like a week or two and I'm like, wow,
 it's amazing.
 Like there's no weeds.
 And so I thought to myself, oh, I guess as the plants get bigger, the weeds don't bother
 anymore or, you know, I don't know.
 I kind of thought I had a self-weeding garden or so.
 I don't know.
 And then so I said something to D.D.R. one day, I was like, yeah, I can't even believe
 like the weeds were so bad before.
 And now there's like no weeds.
 And she was just really gracious.
 She just smiled at me and she's like,
 well, I do weed your garden like a couple of times a week.
 And I was like,
 (laughs)
  </li><li>'Cause she gets up super early
 and comes over in the cool of the day.
 And apparently has been weeding.
  </li><li>She's been weeding it.
 And so I was like, oh.
 And then, you know, especially with my back out
 and stuff, I was like, gosh, if she hadn't been doing that,
 I would have, I would have a garden of weeds.
 I wouldn't have any vegetables.
 Yeah, so we're blessed.
 Right. If you want to find all the spiritual lessons,
 A.G. has been learning from gardening, and there are plenty
 up at Lincoln, the show notes to your message on from Monday night.
 Oh, cool. Yeah. It was, it was really, really good.
 Good. Thanks, babe.
 This week we were back to work kind of with the bang.
 Yes. Nothing interesting other than meetings, meetings, lots of meetings.
 And more meetings.
 Yeah. And we'll talk about that a little bit later because we'll talk about meetings later.
 Saturday was clean up day.
 It was.
 We had some friends come over.
 Yes.
 You tackled the pantry.
 Yeah.
 Me and Ben tackled the garage or garage, as we say in Scotland.
 I'm super self conscious when I'm on the podcast and I use American words.
 I'm not, I'm not self conscious any other time, but when I'm on the podcast, I realize garage is something I'd never say.
 Do you know the word I'm having trouble with at the moment?
 What mature?
 So I was speaking this morning at church and sometimes I pronounce it mature.
 Sometimes we pronounce it mature.
 Yeah, like a t or a chir and I can't remember which one is which.
 Well, I can't remember which one is right in terms of herb or herb because I think it's American say herbs.
 Right.
 They just make it a silent age.
 Yeah, that's right.
 I feel like it's cruel to overlook a consonant.
 So I'm a herb.
 It is kind of cruel.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Anyway, we cleaned up and then as a reward for our friends who helped us clean up, we made without any sense of hyperbole.
 the best meal I think of ever eaten really not the best meal the most flavorful meal it was really
 I have ever eaten yeah so when Gary and Sarah our friends from Australia were here in May
 they said guys guys we need to buy you something for your grill and they bought us something called
 the Weber chicken and fuser and roaster which sounds as awesome as it actually is basically it's a
 a, I don't know, it's metal, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, it's-- - With non-stick porcelain
 ceiling or something on it.
 But it's basically a big tray with a big spike in the middle.
 The spike lifts off, revealing a reservoir.
 And you fill up that reservoir with all sorts of goody.
 You put the spike on top, you put a chicken on top of that,
 and you just shove it on the grill
 and leave it for about an hour, hour and a half,
 somewhere in there. - Yes, yeah.
  </li><li>And when you come back, you've got the most amazing,
 delicious roast chicken. - Oh, unbelievable chicken.
 So we've been playing around with that.
 Yes.
 And on Saturday, I think I hit the jackpot.
 You did.
 It did very well.
 We put garlic, lemon, white wine, red chili flakes in the reservoir.
 Yeah.
 Shove the chicken on top, covered it in oil, salt, pepper, garlic, and a little bit of
 cayenne pepper.
 Shove that on for about an hour and 15 minutes.
 When it came off, we I'd misjudged the timing.
 Do you like the way I created that from we to I?
 and so that it wouldn't go cold.
 We just wrapped the whole thing in foil
 and then wrapped that in the towel,
 which unbeknownst to us made that chicken super succulent.
  </li><li>It was amazing.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
 Meanwhile, you made some roast potatoes.
  </li><li>Caspy roast potatoes.
  </li><li>And I put some corn on the grill.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Just straighten our husks, came off,
 sliced the corn off butter and more cayenne pepper.
  </li><li>Yes, well, you can never have too much cayenne.
  </li><li>Yes, you can.
  </li><li>Yes, well, that's true.
 (laughs)
 It's when you're choking on the ground and trying to breathe for air.
 That's too much.
 So there wasn't that much cayenne because the kids ate it and they didn't notice that it was spicy.
 Right. But then the Piesta resistance was the gravy that you made.
 Yeah, I have a gravy gift.
 Do you have a gravy anointing?
 It's true.
 Parking anointing gravy. That's it.
 I that's it.
 Wait, what?
 I don't know how to get out of this.
 So let's move on.
 So you made this gravy.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Will you put all three of those things together,
 the chicken, the roast potatoes,
 and the corn with the gravy?
 It was a clodge of flavors unlike anything I've had before.
  </li><li>Seriously, I struggled because I was like,
 I am full, I don't need any more food,
 but the problem is I need something to put gravy on,
 'cause the gravy was just magical.
  </li><li>I know, what am I gonna do this week with no gravy?
  </li><li>What am I gonna do?
 Last time I tried to make gravy.
 Me and Kate turned into wallpaper paste.
 I'll give you lessons next.
 Yeah.
 Thank you so much.
 Okay.
 And that was it.
 That was our week.
 Except that you spoke on Sunday.
 Yes.
 I spoke this morning on our fivefold ministry series.
 Yeah.
 I so enjoyed it.
 So good, babe.
 Thanks.
 You're so good at taking things that are you're you're going to
 taking things that could be even controversial, but, you know,
 confusing or whatever and just making them plain.
 I love it.
 I love it when you teach.
 Thank you, babe. It's very sweet.
 All right, our topic for this week.
 Yes.
 It's so funny. I sat down tonight to write our topics for this week.
 And I had about four topics and I realized we've already covered this topic,
 but then I realized, you know what, we've got more revelation on these topics.
 So, and pretty much on this podcast, what are we up to? What episode are we on?
 No idea.
 This is our 159th episode. Wow.
 We only know so much, folks. We are going to repeat topics.
 Yeah. Babe, we're way past the 10. I thought we'd get stuff that.
 Is that all you thought you'd do?
 I was like, yeah, I thought,
 what could see us maybe doing 10?
 I didn't know what we would talk about.
  </li><li>Well, here we are revisiting a topic
 and I don't know if you'll bad about it,
 but we're gonna be talking about work-life balance.
 In part, 'cause we had some great conversations
 with somebody we were gonna talk about in a minute.
 I think the simplest way to have a great work-life balance
 is to have a pace that is life to you.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because if you try and keep up with somebody else's schedule,
 doing what they do and you're not built for that schedule,
 you will either burn out or be bored.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So everybody has a threshold of what gives them life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Are neighbor two doors down?
 How often does he work out with the gym?
  </li><li>Every day, I'm pretty sure for hours every day.
  </li><li>Right.
 I just, I have no grid for that.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then I've got other friends who get up super early
 and are spending time with the Lord from like 3 a.m.
 or I'm just like, I can't do that either.
 So the trick is I think finding something
 this proper pace for you.
 Some people have a really, really high bandwidth
 can accommodate loads and they're not intimidated by it.
 Other people are much smaller.
 And by the way, that changes through life.
 Having kids expend your bandwidth, if you notice that.
  </li><li>It sure does.
 And I think different things are a different level of spend.
 Do you know what I mean?
  </li><li>Do you think that varies from person to person?
  </li><li>Yeah, I totally do.
 I think some people have a greater capacity
 for things that are potentially very emotional or,
 you know, which I might find draining,
 but other people might find, oh, this is life, you know,
 where I might find something, you know,
 I was gonna say insular, but that's not really what I mean.
 Like I might find study or something like that life
 where somebody else might find that completely draining.
 So I think you find you have different bandwidths
 in different areas as well.
 I forget who told us this story.
 Maybe it was Lyle.
 I might have been the Robinson's.
 Anyway, that doesn't matter.
 Sorry, guys.
 I'm thinking out loud here.
 But it was a conversation between Heidi and a team
 out of the IRIS space.
 And for those of you who know Heidi Baker,
 she just works incredibly hard.
 I look at Heidi's schedule and just think, no, no,
 I don't know how you do it.
 And somebody, I think they were having a staff session
 and asking about rest and asking about this.
 And how do you do too much?
 Or how do your staff cope around you?
 Do they feel like they have to run at your schedule?
 And Heidi said this great thing.
 She said, I won't judge you for resting
 if you won't judge me for working.
 And it comes back to,
 it's very, very difficult to put yourself
 in somebody else's shoes without being them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like my mum, for example,
 would always have a house full on Sunday.
 I mean, always, easily 20 plus people in our house
 cook for them, never intimidated,
 would host them really, really well, two meals, lunch and dinner.
 Oh, just walking the park.
 Loved it.
 Right.
 My dad, for example, tried to do it.
 I mean, my dad got a blessing.
 You know, he would burn water while trying to make a boiled egg.
 You know, so again, me putting together a sermon last minute, you know, that's fine.
 It doesn't stress me at all.
 I remember when we teach our first year students, hey, you're going to put together a sermon.
 They're like, wait, what are we going to do in two weeks time?
 Are you kidding me?
 So again, it's experience.
 Do you think that we're good at work-life balance?
 Not really.
 I'd like to think that we are.
 It's just that I notice that unless I'm super intentional with Fridays and Saturdays, I can
 easily get sucked into things that it has nothing to do with my kids or with us or with
 with resting or with fun or any of the things that a day off should be about.
 Typically, well, part of the problem is we really love our work.
 Yeah.
 And then when we're not working for Grace Center, like recording this podcast, is this
 work? It's not work for Grace Center.
 No.
 It does occupy an enormous amount of time.
 I mean, I mean, you sing here doesn't take a long time, but after we finish
 recording this, the amount of time it takes to edit, upload, write the show notes, all that.
 That's four or five hours worth of work a week.
 So that's not work, but we get it done.
 Same with housework.
 Well let's leave housework for a side, but there's a lot of stuff that we do on the side
 that is so closely similar to what we do for paid employment.
 Those edges become blurry really, really quickly.
 Yeah, they really can.
 I would say we're historically not very good at this because our work is tremendous source
 of joy for us.
 We tend to or at least I tend to work until I collapse.
 Yeah.
 So I'm actually trying to get better at that.
 And our staff are really good.
 Jeff's really good.
 Danielle Helson, who's our chief administrator, basically our head honcho and is running our
 HR efforts at Grace Center.
 She's so diligent in being on and off.
 She greatly admire the way she manages that.
 And part of her training that she's been doing at church is like, "Hey guys, I want
 to help set a culture at Grace Center to help us increase our work-life balance."
 Right.
 And part of that is, you know, we're migrating away from the backend software that you use
 to run all of our back office stuff at Grace Center.
 And as we're setting everything up, she's like, "Hey, here's some best practice stuff."
 So as we're rolling out this new system, Danielle was like, hey, I'm going to really encourage
 you for a number of reasons to separate your work and your personal email.
 And she's not meaning just, you know, how you can open up whatever mail app you have and
 you can have like work and you can have personal is just separate accounts.
 She was saying use completely different apps.
 And she was saying on a Saturday, when you're checking your personal email, the last thing
 you need to see, even if you have no intention of addressing it as a work email come in,
 then it's in your consciousness, then you have to think about it exactly.
 We'd been doing, or at least I'd been doing that for a while, two separate apps, but it's
 just so much habit for me.
 I think we can get addicted to stimulus.
 Yeah, I mean, I actually hadn't been doing that.
 To begin with, I was a little annoyed.
 I was like, "I don't need that."
 But actually, it's super, super helpful.
 I was like, you know, having them in the two different apps and having the work account
 just, you know, whatever, Sunday to Thursday, I realized I didn't get hooked at all on Friday
 or Saturday into work stuff.
 And typically I do, like typically I see a work one and I don't just sort of pass it
 over.
 I just read it in case it's something I need to know for Sunday or something, you know.
 So as much as I was a bit annoyed with the thought of having two different apps, it's
 actually helping me a lot not be stressed out of my days off, which was her whole point.
 Which is great.
 Yeah.
 The funny thing with calendars is that doesn't work as well.
 No.
 You can't, I mean, you don't get me wrong, we have separate calendars for work events
 and our personal events, but you really need to see both those events on the same calendar.
 Yes.
 use an app called Fantastical, which I highly recommend, and you can set up groupings of
 which calendars you want to show.
 So I've created a custom Jones group, which includes my events at work, your events at
 work, and then our personal events so that I can effectively see when I'm really free.
 Because if I just look at my work events, that doesn't include dental appointments for
 the kids or PTA meetings or any of those sorts of things.
 as if we got a PTA meetings.
 It was the first thing that involved in my head.
 It was good, it was good, baby.
 It made us seem very parental or something.
 Skills for it.
 Yay!
 Can you fix my fantastical then?
 Oh, baby, we actually need to carve out some time
 for me to fix everything on your computer.
 We really do.
 Because it's like, you're like, it should do this
 and it doesn't, it should do that, it doesn't.
 Yeah.
 It needs you.
 God bless you, you have a nerd living with you,
 but you know, I never get around to my surgery.
  </li><li>I don't get tech support really at home.
 It's very sad.
  </li><li>Talk to me about some other tips for work-life balance.
  </li><li>Oh gosh.
 Well, we talked a little bit about guarding your day off
 or your days off.
 And for us, we, because the kids,
 when the kids are in school on Fridays,
 it's just MJ at home and the girls are at school.
 And then Saturday, of course, is the only day that we have
 that we're not working, that the girls are home.
 So Saturday's family day, it's a day to do something fun
 with them and whatever.
 Friday we get a little bit more of a break
 'cause it's just mugs.
  </li><li>But here's the thing, I find if I don't rest on the Friday,
 I have no energy for the Saturday.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And historically, Friday as my day off
 has really allowed me to do all the stuff
 I didn't get to do before.
 Again, I'm falling into the trap of,
 "Oh yeah, no, I can do that on Friday."
 And there's times when that's fine,
 which will come to a moment,
 but at the moment, I'm trying this new thing,
 it's beered on by Danielle,
 where I realized actually I can delegate a bunch of stuff
 during the week, I can say no to stuff during the week,
 so I can say yes to having a day off.
 So for example, we go to a lot of meetings together
 and I realized actually, I don't need to be
 at all the meetings that we both go to,
 because if I say yes to being at that meeting,
 I'm saying no to getting some of this work done,
 which means I'm gonna have to do on my day off,
 or I just be powerful and guard my day off
 and split up some of the work responsibilities that we have.
  </li><li>Right, and that works for some stuff for sure.
 I think for me, like Friday would be the most natural day
 to do a day off, 'cause only one kid's at home rather than three,
 but by the time we get to Friday,
 we have no clothes left in the house
 usually as an absolute disaster.
 when the house isn't clean, I don't feel like I'm having a day off.
 Right. So let's talk about that. The importance of eliminating stressors.
 Yeah. Because I am very proud of us, baby. We have done a very good job the last two weeks
 of keeping our house pretty clean. Yes. And that involves us blitzing it, getting it clean,
 and then staying on top of it and having some sort of system to ensure it stays like that.
 Yeah. Which for everybody listening, this is not complicated. This is being like a grown-up and
 and picking up after yourself, which we don't tend to be good at.
 No, it just tends to be energy dependent, doesn't it?
 It's like you get to the end of the day and it's like, well, I'm glad I spent energy
 with the kids and I'm glad I spent energy at work, but now I have no energy left and
 I'm looking around and I'm thinking, gosh, this all needs to get done, but I've got
 nothing left.
 Right.
 But it's easier to keep a clean house clean than it is to keep a dirty house clean.
 I can't believe I thought that was profound.
 Yes, well, to get a dirty house clean for sure.
 Yes.
 But I'm just realizing we probably need some kind of system, which we haven't managed to
 figure out yet when we go into the school being on because then life ramps up even more.
 Right.
 So I think part of the important part is prioritizing.
 No, realizing you just can't do everything.
 Yeah.
 Your time and your energy is like money.
 You know, if you've got a hundred bucks in your pocket and it's yours to spend and there's three
 things you want to do and all of them cost $100. You can't do all three. You have to pick one of them.
 Right. But at some point you have to wash your underwear and socks or you end up like we did this
 summer at one point where I was like, "Ah, I'll just buy more socks and other words. They get so
 be fine." Because we just didn't have time. And I was like, "Well, Mart, I love you."
 So, you know. Oh, shame-free living. You heard it here first.
 It's pretty scary. What about sleep?
 I think sometimes we do great at staying on track with getting enough sleep so that we have energy for the next day.
 And sometimes we do less great.
 Well, you fool yourself into thinking, I've worked really hard today.
 I just want to unwind going to sleep doesn't feel like unwinding.
 So I'll just stay up and I'll watch another episode of this thing on Netflix.
 And before you know it's 11 p.m. you're rolling into the bedroom.
 You're going to have to check Instagram.
 And then before you know, it's like 1130, 1140.
 Right.
 And you're like, I should have been in bed like an hour ago.
 Yeah.
 Because it's true.
 You know, a good day starts with a great night of sleep.
 Yeah.
 And we sabotage ourselves by, you know, we're not setting ourselves up for
 success by not doing the little things throughout the day that produce great
 dividends.
 Right.
 And there's even medical stuff to support that you may remember better what it's
 called, but the whole thing about how your mind washes itself.
 after a certain amount of sleep.
 Oh, yeah.
 And it dumps all of the stress.
 Your mind doesn't have a connection to your brain system.
 Your brain doesn't.
 And so it actually needs a certain amount of sleep in order for it to dump
 all the toxins, if you will, out so that you can de-stress.
 So it makes sense that if you are not getting a good amount of sleep,
 but you're always pushing it and only getting five or six or whatever,
 you're actually collecting stress in your actual brain.
 Yeah, I'll put a link to that. It was a Ted Med talk that was fascinating.
 It's really cool. It was amazing.
 Yeah. I mean, I remember a doctor Josh saying,
 "You need about nine hours worth of sleep for your body to restore at night."
 And that's for it to recover from sickness, but also to basically not get sickness.
 When sickness is going around, if you were getting nine hours of sleep at night,
 very likely you wouldn't get it.
 When was the last time you got nine hours of sleep?
 I can't remember a time, but I am for eight.
 What which i'm not doing great at either you want to try nine i think it'd be great okay let's challenge ourselves not this week because this week's crazy
 That was classic okay next week gotcha okay this is what you call an addiction circle
 This is like denial of a problem not this way next week's gonna be less crazy for sure oh yeah i'll die i'll die it tomorrow
 It'll be fine.
 That'd be fine.
 Yeah, I'm going to start working on it tomorrow.
 One question that's good to ask yourself is, is the current pace of life that I have a
 season or is this my life?
 It's so important you understand times and seasons because, for example, remember when
 you were in college and you had your finals and for those six weeks of exams, all you
 do is eat sleep and prepare for an exam.
 And sometimes you do less of the eating and the sleeping.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Right.
 And everybody gives you grace to do that
 'cause they're your finals.
 So your social life goes out the calendar.
 Perhaps you stop going to the gym as much.
 Perhaps you're eating worse
 because you're just trying to, you know, cram stuff in.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that's fine.
 It's a bit like when we were moving house,
 you know, your house is in boxes.
  </li><li>Right.
 So you're eating stuff you wouldn't normally eat.
  </li><li>You're eating.
  </li><li>You're eating for fast food.
  </li><li>You know, you've got to get past your own less sleep.
 I think that's fine.
 There's scenes of life.
 maybe this deadlines at work where you're just cramming to get a sales bid into a customer,
 whatever.
 But if your life every week is that level of intensity, you're going to burn out real
 quick.
 Yeah, for sure.
 But there's times of having grace, like the first year that we ran year two, we just
 realized we needed to just take a deep breath, suck it up, and just power down.
 And in doing all that work, it's made the subsequent years way, way, way easier because
 All the work is done and you're now refining and tweaking rather than building as you go.
 So it was fun, though, see, this isn't it?
 Building a plane while it's taking off on the runway.
 It's funny because I love to build.
 That's one of the things that's my favorite thing to do, but it's definitely, it definitely costs you.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well, tell us this week, what are your top tips for work life balance that we
 completely missed out on and we'll love to share them with our listeners.
 Hey, speaking of listeners, don't we have listeners questions?
 Oh, baby, we do.
 I've got two for you.
 Oh, good.
 Well, the first one's for me.
 We do want me to ask you the first one then, since it's okay.
 This is from Laura and she says, you do a lot of teaching on the fivefold ministry.
 I was wondering if there was any recommended reading for figuring out what an evangelist is.
 Yes, ish.
 I could tell you in a nutshell, and obviously an evangelist is a person who has a burning
 passion for the lost.
 They love to be among the lost.
 They're less likely to want to be in church.
 They're more likely to be itinerant and their whole goal is on seeing the loss
 saved and training up other people and inspiring them to save other people.
 One of the best books I read on all of this is called The Complete Wine
 Skin by Harold Eberle.
 I'll put a link to it in the show notes.
 It's not about evangelism or evangelist per se, but it does cover evangelist.
 It more covers the whole of the fivefold that you were talking about.
 And if that sounds interesting to you, I am currently teaching a three-part
 series at Grey Center. Again, I'll put links to the sessions I've taught so far in the show notes.
 Are you ready for your question? I think I am. This is from Hillary.
 Hillary says, "We have a new baby, congratulations, and a two-year-old, and our two-year-old is having
 a hard time adjusting to being a family of four. She is in no way taking out on the baby,
 but is throwing a lot of temper tantrums. How did you guys handle going from a family of three
 to a family of four.
 Oh, wow.
 We, I mean, one of the things that we did was,
 and it's probably too late for this,
 because you've already brought the newborn home,
 but maybe you could.
 We actually brought our two-year-old a gift from our newborn.
 We were like, "Hey, she was, you know,
 "Tia was so excited to meet you Abigail.
 "She wanted to get you a gift."
 And so we got you in, you know,
 she got you in Elmo or whatever.
 And so for some reason that, like right away,
 I made Abby really happy to have Tia home because she was maybe the game games.
 But I mean, being too is just a tough season anyway.
 There's a reason that they call it the terrible twos.
 You know, two years old, you're learning basic trust.
 You're learning that you're learning your nose.
 You're learning when it's okay to say no and when it is okay to say no.
 and all that kind of stuff.
 Like it's just a tough learning curve.
 You're getting language,
 but you don't have enough language
 to express correctly what you're feeling.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>So I've always just found that season
 just really hard for the kids
 and really trying to be patient and realize
 they have difficulty because they can't express
 their frustration.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So they just sort of need a bit more grace.
 Having said that, we didn't really go
 for the kids having tantra tantrums.
 So we would sort of do the thing of,
 oh wow, well, you can choose to do that,
 but you need to choose to do that in your bedroom.
 You can choose to throw down as it were,
 but you can choose to do that in your bedroom
 or on the think about it, Stair.
 And when you're ready to talk, we wanna talk to you.
 Come over and talk when you're ready or whatever.
 So not trying to control them in terms of,
 you're not allowed to do that,
 'cause part of that is--
  </li><li>Good luck with that.
  </li><li>Right.
 But just saying, oh, well, actually that's not behavior
 that we're gonna go for.
 But then also being really careful not to overreact
 to 10 to 10 terms, what?
  </li><li>I love the way you're saying 10 to 10 terms.
  </li><li>I know, I keep getting stacked.
  </li><li>10 to 10 terms?
 also being really careful to not overreact to temper tantrums
 and therefore give them attention,
 but look for the things that you can give them
 a lot of positive attention on
 just in case the temper tantrums are actually,
 I want attention and I think this is the only way I can get it.
  </li><li>Right, yeah, it might have nothing to do
 with a newborn baby at all, like you were saying.
  </li><li>Two's are tough.
  </li><li>And we should point out, two's are tough for them.
 They don't have to be tough for you.
 So when we're saying, it's hard,
 We're talking about it's hard for them because it is difficult.
 There are all the reasons you just said.
 We found that when we removed just like a fire needs oxygen, we found that when you
 remove an audience from a temper tantrum, they lose interest in throwing that.
 If you don't already have a think about it step, we just use the bottom stair of our
 staircase and we would just say, "Oh, buddy, we don't do that.
 If you want to do that, then you can sit on the step and do that."
 will be over here and when you'd like to behave,
 well, come back in.
 And we try to remove the naughtiness from that
 because they really are learning,
 oh, look, when I throw down, I get attention.
 And so we just started looking for good behavior
 to focus on attention on.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And we would say, you know, we're not mad at you,
 understand you probably feel frustrated.
 Can you tell us what's happening?
 But again, when they're two,
 they don't usually have the language for that.
 So you just kind of have to help them work it through,
 but not give them the attention for the negative behavior.
  </li><li>This too shall pass the key phrase
 for many stages of parenting.
  </li><li>And having said that, like I know, I said terrible twos,
 but actually we didn't really see that much
 of that kind of stuff.
 Like they sort of passed through it fairly quickly.
 I would say Tia was sort of the worst
 in quotation marks in terms of that lasting
 a little bit longer.
  </li><li>God's given me this gift
 where I don't remember things in the past.
 So I don't remember any of that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I don't remember whether they were good, bad,
 or indifferent, I think I just moved on.
  </li><li>I mean, as soon as they start getting more words,
 it seriously, it just disappears.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>You know, as long as you're parenting the situation,
 if you allow temper tantrums,
 then I think you probably end up continuing to see them.
  </li><li>The trick to learn, which took me a long time to learn,
 remembering that you're the adult.
 Yeah.
 Because I made the mistake of matching the volume.
 You said they're having a temper tantrum.
 Oh, you want to throw down?
 I will throw down.
 And then you're like, babe, you're dealing with a two year old.
 Yeah.
 You're a 40 year old, but you like a bit of perspective.
 And you're like, Oh, yeah, I'm just adding like petrol to this fire,
 where I need to be kind of removing things from it.
 So while Hillary, all the best, congratulations on your new baby.
 It will be good.
 All right.
 Thank you for listening.
