<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones.
 Hey there. Hi there.<br/>
 Ho there.<br/>
 It's how you want me to start.<br/>
 Everything okay in your world.<br/>
 Yes, I think so.<br/>
 Welcome everybody to a rather psychotic episode of keeping up with the Joneses.
 I was just trying to make it different than our normal.
 Hey, babe.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 Well, that was different.<br/>
 I was a whole bucket of different right there.
 That was.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 That was a week.<br/>
 It was a good week.<br/>
 My mom arrived.<br/>
 She did.<br/>
 God bless her.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 She is 80 years old.<br/>
 She is 80 years old.<br/>
 And she drove all the way from Canada.
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah, she does it in two days, but she drives all the way from Canada.
 Everybody would tell when we say that she's 80, nobody believes us.
 Yeah, most people think she's in her 60s.
 Yeah.<br/>
 She's a spryly young lady.<br/>
 She is.<br/>
 She's quite spryly.<br/>
 She's currently cleaning our dishes because the dishwasher isn't working.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Do you want to talk about dishwasher not working?
 Well, why don't we just say it's a 10 year old dishwasher and leave it at that.
 It is a 10 year old dishwasher.<br/>
 Good.<br/>
 We're all talking about it.<br/>
 So do you think you want to say about the dishwasher?
 No, we're setting up the house slowly, but surely finding things that are wrong and
 fixing them and then unpacking boxes and picking up paintings.
 And it's true.<br/>
 It's funny because the procedure it feels like is just get boxes in the house,
 now get boxes in the right rooms, now unpack the boxes that are urgent,
 or now open every single box to find the things that we didn't put in the proper
 boxes, but we desperately need.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And then, well, it's interesting.<br/>
 I think we've mentioned this in previous weeks.
 It seems like the things that are of most interest to us are like,
 I haven't unpacked any of my clothes, but I do have our stereo system and our internet up and running.
 Well, yes, that was the first day, wasn't it?
 And our Wi-Fi connected light bulbs.<br/>
 Those all happen fast and the kitchen happened fast, but everything else has been
 slower progress. We did have friends that came over yesterday and helped us unpack stuff for five hours.
 And frankly, we couldn't have done what we got done without their help because your back is
 Gammie, I need somebody who we need a better word than Gammie.
 Gammie sounds too close to Grammy or old.
 Oh, OK.<br/>
 My back is sensitive.<br/>
 I need to learn about horticulture.<br/>
 Oh, who do I know in Franklin slash Nashville?
 Who knows about plants and trees?<br/>
 Because I need to trim bushes and your mother was telling me I can't just
 give them a haircut like I was going to.
 She saw me with a giant pair of what do you call them?
 secateurs or what are they those big things that you chop bushes with?
 Yeah, they're like giant scissors.<br/>
 Yeah, this is the amount of help we need.
 We don't even know the color.<br/>
 We don't even know the names of the tools.
 I'm so willingly wielding.<br/>
 She's like, you can't trim that.<br/>
 I was like, why?<br/>
 And she said, well, because you have to learn what the plan is and learn how to cut it.
 And I was like, oh, dang it.<br/>
 That momentarily put it.<br/>
 So if you know anything about horticulture or plants or bushes and you live here,
 please let me know or I can just send you pictures and you can tell me what they are.
 I tried downloading some apps but got so confused. It seems like people who are good at identifying
 plans aren't very good at writing software. That would be my experience from a cursory glass.
 That would be.<br/>
 It is a fairly diverse skill set to be good at in both areas.
 Can you imagine the geekery that would be involved in being good at plants and
 beaters up? Well, you know what my dad- The person probably never leaves their house.
 My dad gets here next month.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 But I fear some of the plants might be dead by then.
 Well, or have overgrown and taken over the house.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I had a conversation with Alison Hendrickson, which I didn't tell you about, about our
 planter boxes because we have these massive planter boxes, you know, three above ground
 ones.<br/>
 And I thought we just need to wait till next year to plant things.
 But she's like, no, you can plant this and that and tomatoes and, you know, so there's
 tons of stuff I could be planting that we actually eat.
 You're going to have to dig them all up for us because right now,
 I know they're full of like the longest grass.
 You've ever received it?<br/>
 We can film something for the mutual of Omaha's wild kingdom.
 We can put some of Alan's or MJ's action figures,
 and run them through the grass.<br/>
 I kind of feel like we should send that out and email
 to our homeowners association to go, don't worry.
 We will fix it.<br/>
 We just don't know what we're doing.<br/>
 We don't know what to do with this.<br/>
 Yeah. You spoke to emanate.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 Do you know what you spoke about?<br/>
 Can you remember?<br/>
 That's like probably some sort of sign about how much was packed into this week that I can't feel life of me remember.
 I just remember a high to get you to land the plane, so to speak, because you were all over the map towards the end of the very last slide.
 I started going off the reservation, but I still care.
 Remember what I said?<br/>
 I was like, shut it down, shut it down, shut it down.
 And you planned the plane.<br/>
 And as if life wasn't full enough, our kids started back in school.
 Yes.<br/>
 So that was fun.<br/>
 They had a half day Friday and they both came home from a brand new school.
 And both of them said, "Mommy, I made a friend today," which is very sweet.
 They also nearly didn't get off the bus and did a tour of Williamson County.
 Yes.<br/>
 So I had to run after the bus and get it to open his doors and they were like, "Yeah."
 I was like, "My kids are still on board."
 And then they're like, "Oh, we didn't know it was our stop."
 I'm like, "Oh."<br/>
 But we just moved here.<br/>
 They're not going to recognize anything.
 Right. That's true.<br/>
 So we might have to just make sure we're on top of that one for sure.
 How do you suggest giving walking talkies electric colors?
 Yes, that would be perfect.<br/>
 Maybe buzzes when it gets near our house.
 I don't think that they would call child services for that at all.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I saw the newborn movie this afternoon.
 We're celebrating Brett's birthday.<br/>
 Yes. And I'm jealous because I've wanted to see it since it came out.
 You had the opportunity to go last week on opening night.
 No, I didn't.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Cindy said can me and H.A.<br/>
 Go see born moving.<br/>
 I was like, sure.<br/>
 And then you chose not to do it.<br/>
 No, that's not how I remember that.<br/>
 Oh, okay. Well, I think you'd like it. It's a bit of a departure from the previous movies,
 I think. But maybe I've just been overthinking it, but I enjoyed it nevertheless.
 Okay. I've been having a lot of fun doing the wisdom 31 hashtag.
 I've been having a lot of fun watching all the hashtag wisdom 31s come in.
 It's been really good, hasn't it? Yeah, it's interesting everybody reading the same.
 If you don't know what we're talking about, we're all reading a chapter of Proverbs a day.
 whatever the day is if it's the eleventh three chapter eleven and then post something either on
 facebook instagram or twitter about what stood out to you and then hashtag it wisdom thirty one
 which i forgot to do last night i mean i posted the verse but forgot to hashtag it and then when i
 look at this one i was like i don't want to repost it because i don't be out of sync so right
 yeah try and remember a hashtag it yeah it's been great it's been good to see the different things
 that stand out to people and even some of the things some of the things that are the same
 same things that stand out to people. If that makes sense.
 Chapter five was a hard one to tweet about.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah, I was on my best behavior. There's so many things that were just brilliant to tweet.
 And I just thought, I don't know how much my readership knows my sense of humor. I'll
 be my best behavior.<br/>
 That's good. Darling, I'm proud of you.
 You know what? I want to talk about this week.
 What?<br/>
 I want to talk about Grace Center.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Because how long have we been at Grace Center?
 Seven and a half years.<br/>
 Good night.<br/>
 Yeah, we started work on the 1st of January 2009 at Gray Center.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Goodness me.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Well, I was thinking, I was actually moved by the post that you made on Instagram about
 this morning service, which was amazing.
 So if you weren't at Gray Center this morning, I would say this morning, second service would
 be a great example of what we love about Gray Center.
 Why don't you describe for the people what happened?
 Well, you know, worship just started.<br/>
 Jesse was leading and it was amazing. And then it just went into this prophetic kind of thing
 where Jesse was just sort of singing the heart of God and it just felt like it went up a level
 and then it went up a level and then went up. It got to where, you know, I was looking through
 Instagram for to see if somebody had posted a picture of, you know, I mean, everybody was standing,
 all hands were raised, worship went for like an hour and a half, you know, it was crazy.
 I mean, in a really good way.<br/>
 But I realized we were also into it that nobody took a picture.
 You know, it was just.<br/>
 We were also into it.<br/>
 We forgot to take up an offering.<br/>
 That's how you know your rivals happened.
 Yeah, seriously.<br/>
 And we didn't even catch it.<br/>
 Somebody else had to come up and say,<br/>
 "What do I do with my offering?"<br/>
 We're like, "Uh, we're going to--"<br/>
 I love that.<br/>
 I know we just had goodbye, but, you know.
 So, but it was amazing.<br/>
 At two different points during the service,
 I could hear angels singing.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 Like it sounded like a chorus of Angel Singing, and it was so loud.
 I do need to speak to Marcus, this morning he was running Sound.
 He's the director of Dark Technical Ministries.
 And also the worship team, because at one point I heard a noise,
 and I could see all the team working out who was making the noise.
 I think that was my assumption from looking at them, looking at each other.
 But I heard this beautiful tone that sounded like it was not feedback,
 but a very pronounced tone I thought was coming from the guitar.
 but it wasn't and I saw our guitarist looking around to see who's making that noise.
 And one of the things I love about, whenever we're in, I'm assuming it's natural because it's
 music city, but whenever Jesse or any of our worship leaders go off the reservation into either
 prophetic song or spontaneous song, the congregation singing is unbelievable.
 You know, it just goes into harmonies everywhere and it's incredible.
 At that point, I sit down because I just want to listen to it.
 Yeah, yeah, there's something there's I mean, I don't want to say it's only happens in Nashville, but
 Well, I've been in other churches where it sounds like a bunch of drunken pirates have together and are right singing
 There's lots of passion, but perhaps not much harmony right right right
 But I mean this is like it's almost like you have a room full of 500 people and all of them can sing right
 You know, it's just a little bit different so
 yeah, it was just<br/>
 incredible and it's fun to watch Jeff navigate following the Holy Spirit and not
 I mean Jeff's great at not having a plan in terms of he of course had a prepared message and whatever
 But if the Holy Spirit's doing something different then that's what Jeff's doing or even if he
 I mean take a step down from there even if he doesn't know what the Holy Spirit's doing
 He's fine not to revert. I would say most leaders myself included would be stick to the plan. We have a plan
 Right. We don't know what God's doing right now. So let's continue with the plan.
 Yeah. And he won't. He's like, what if the Holy Spirit wants to do something different from the
 plan? And I, it's one of the things I so admire about Jeff. His absolute resolute steadfastness that
 he is going to, to the best of his ability, follow the Holy Spirit. And I think the Holy Spirit loves
 it. Yeah. Because you can't go wrong at that point. Because even if you miss it, let's say worst case
 and are you miss what the Holy Spirit was doing, you get an A+ for effort, just for even trying.
 And I've watched Jeff continually in these seven and a half years stop the train for the Holy Spirit.
 Yeah. Just like, okay, guys, we're not going to do church as normal as if we could. But he will
 he will be happy to eat humble pie if he missed it or just just risk something for the Holy Spirit.
 And that's, I want to say that's quite rare.
 I think a lot of times we say we're going to risk for the Holy Spirit, but we risk within
 the parameters of what we're comfortable, especially those of us who are in public ministry.
 Right.<br/>
 Because it's scary.<br/>
 I don't care if you're stepping out with a word of knowledge.
 I don't care if you're got a message.<br/>
 And as you can stand out to speak, the Holy Spirit says, no, change it.
 Anytime you feel like the Holy Spirit deviating from what you feel like the Holy Spirit's
 already told you, there's huge risk involved.
 And you've got hundreds of people looking at you going, this is better work.
 And it's, I thought it was good.<br/>
 Like he talked a little bit about perplexity and how
 perplexity is really just not knowing what to do next.
 And that God can be in the midst of that.
 Like, you know, God can meet you in the midst of perplexity
 and you don't need to rush through it.
 And it made me think about how often when, you know,
 because it can be uncomfortable, those situations,
 you either go with what God's doing<br/>
 or people can get uncomfortable.<br/>
 Because you're like, what is happening?
 How long is this gonna be happening for?
 Is there gonna be a message after this?
 Like he can get sort of sucked into the,
 what's your normal?<br/>
 Rather than just engage with God and see where it goes.
</p><ul>
  <li>One of the things that we've had
 is we've had people come to our church
 and they experience a morning like this morning.
 They experience this wonderful freedom
 for the Holy Spirit to do whatever he wants.
 this amazing sense of God's presence.
 And I think the question that people are often asking is,
 what are the ingredients that we can put in place
 so that the Holy Spirit will show up like he did this morning?
 What would you say some of the ingredients are?
 How would you encourage leaders to foster an environment?
 Because it's very similar to what we experienced in Toronto,
 the joy and delight of the Holy Spirit in showing up.
 And so there's huge parallels and overlaps,
 which we'll talk about later
 between John and Carol and Jeff and Becky,
 but talk to me about some of the ingredients
 that you see that facilitate a move
 of the spirit like we saw this morning.
  </li><li>Gosh, I think there's probably a lot of ingredients.
 I probably think number one is humility.
 No matter who it is, whether it's the worship leader
 or the MC or, you know, Jeff
 or whoever's leading the meeting,
 just having a real knowledge of who you are
 and who you're not.
 And yeah, it's that it's not about you.
 It's not about you getting to do your part.
 It's not about, everybody thinking great about you.
 It's about the Lord and it's about following the Lord.
 So I think some of it is that those are all people
 that have pursued God for themselves to be humble people.
 You know what I mean?
 Like to, "Hey, Lord, would you make me someone
 that's sensitive to your spirit and that it isn't about me?"
 And so there's, it's a great starting off platform
 because you're able to go someplace without it being effort.
  </li><li>Right.
 I would say in addition to the humility,
 there, of course, there's faith,
 but let me use a different word from faith.
 You've got to be willing to risk it.
 I've watched time and time again, increasingly
 in the last couple of years, Jeff go out on a limb
 and to perhaps visitors being there or perhaps other people.
 There's no apparent reason for why he did what he did.
 Other than my perspective is,
 it's not that the Holy Spirit is testing Jeff like a meanie,
 but I think I've watched Jeff obey the Holy Spirit out of obedience,
 not out of understanding.
 So the Holy Spirit's maybe said,
 "I don't need to do anything this morning.
 I want to just sit in silence."
 And of course, Jeff's like,
 "Are you kidding me? We've got people tuning in from all over the world
 and they're just going to watch us sit in silence.
 Are you kidding me?
 We've got visitors or guests here.
 How are we going to explain how weird this is?
 This is sounds.
 And without understanding why he does it, and I think for the Holy Spirit, he's just
 like, oh, I love that you did that.
 And so if I can trust you with obedience and simple things, then I can trust you with
 obedience with multiples of my presence, you know, and that of course requires humility,
 but it's a thing that nobody, everybody wants the fruit of, but nobody really wants to
 pay the price for, which is risk, risking looking utterly foolish.
 Yeah.
 And I just love that about Jeff and Becky.
 I just love the way that they've purposed in their heart to create a space for the Holy
 Spirit, even if it costs them their reputation.
 Yeah.
 Any other ingredients?
 I think our actual, our entire congregation, you know, we've joked around about it, but
 you don't go to Grace Center for the building.
 You know, it's not flash.
 It's not, you know, it's worth thankful for the building, but it's you're probably coming
 despite the building rather than because of it.
 Tell us a story about our architects when they came these.
 We had these architects come through a couple of years ago to, you know, work on some plans
 for Gray Center to expand.
 And they walked through and after looking at our building, they were pretty shocked and
 they said, "You guys must be doing something really right to be, you know, the size that
 that you are and to be growing
 because they're coming despite your building.
  </li><li>Right, and these are guys with like 30 plus years
 of just building churches.
  </li><li>That's all they do, yeah.
 All they do is churches.
  </li><li>Our research shows us that people won't attend a church
 that's not at least as nice as the homes they live in.
  </li><li>Right, and hi, we have a church in Franklin.
 You know what I mean?
 So it's like you're talking about one of the wealthier,
 you know, suburbs or wealthier counties in the US
 and we have a church that's in an old elementary school.
  </li><li>From the '60s.
  </li><li>Right, you know, and unfortunately,
 it kind of looks like that, still, you know.
  </li><li>And they were really taken aback.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And they could just say,
 "We're coming since you're doing something right
 "because people are coming in spite of your building."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I don't want to build a theology.
 Like it seems to me,
 it's 'cause I'll see what you think about this.
 I'm not sure this is true.
 So I'm throwing this out.
 It seems to me in my travels and in my experiences,
 you typically find one of two things.
 You typically find churches that are really, really excellent
 in their architectural details and in their layout
 and in their furnishings and in their appearance.
 And I mean, it's amazing.
 I've been to churches that are just absolutely gorgeous.
 But in terms of the flexibility to accommodate a morning
 like this morning isn't there.
  </li><li>Typically, yeah.
  </li><li>Typically, yeah.
 Or you find churches that tend to be way flexible
 with what the Holy Spirit is doing,
 and yet they're lacking in the looks department.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So maybe that's personality or looks, okay?
  </li><li>Which one do you wanna marry?
  </li><li>It is rare to find both in one package.
 And I don't know why that is.
 And I'd love it if we could get both.
 But here's my sneaking suspicion based on what John on it once told me.
 Because when I traveled with John and Carol, the question everybody would always ask at
 a passage meeting is why your church.
 So all over the world, we'd do these passage and leaders meetings where people could ask
 questions, anything they wanted to about the Toronto blessing and this, that next thing.
 And it was one of my favourite sessions to be in on.
 And listen to John just answer questions from leaders all over the world.
 And people would say, why your church?
 John's first answer would always be, "Well, we were at the end of a runway, so it was
 easy for people to get to."
 He was joking and people would press him for an answer.
 He said, "I don't think we were praying for revival any more than any other church was
 praying for revival."
 He said, "If you had to push me for an answer, I do think that God delights in humble surroundings."
 He wasn't talking about them being humble, though they certainly are.
 He was like, Jesus had the choice of being born in any nation and within any nation in
 any palace.
 And yet he chose to be born in Israel as tiny obscure nation and in a barn and in a stable
 and he could have been in a palace.
 He could have been in the center of world power, but he didn't.
 And so I mean, John, I remember hearing John saying, I hope this is okay, same public,
 He said, I think there's something humble about being Canada that Americans had to cross the border to come and visit, you know, quote unquote, America's little brother.
 There was there's something about this tiny obscure little church in the middle of nowhere that God so loved that he came to just show up.
 So I am not for a minute saying that nice churches are not going to be visited by the Holy Spirit.
 I've been to many amazing churches with the Holy Spirit.
 Yes, absolutely.
 I'm just talking about this kind of observation of me where it seems,
 I'm just talking about this observation where it seems like it tends to be one or the other.
 Do you agree with that? Do you think that's right? Have you got anything?
 I mean, I can certainly think of a couple churches
 that seem to have a nice building
 and have it all together
 and also the Holy Spirit's doing stuff.
 And then you know what I mean?
 So certainly I don't think that's,
 I don't think you can say that across the board,
 but I've seen a lot of the,
 yeah, I guess what you're talking about,
 that the Lord meeting people in these humble places
 where really they meant a hub to pennies to rub together,
 but they have a longing for the Lord, you know,
 and he loves to show up in the midst of that,
 where I think really if you're talking about a service
 where the attitude is, I'm gonna go,
 I'm gonna get my service done, you know,
 punch my hour and a half time clock with God
 and then move on throughout my day, you know,
 and I just want everything to be speedy and perfect,
 you're probably less likely to have the Holy Spirit show up or be able to identify that he is
 trying to show up if the priority is the schedule and stuff.
 It's so hard speaking like this because I'm trying to avoid judgmental terms at all.
 There's no judgment in my heart at all. You don't get a Geiger counter for the Holy Spirit.
 You know the Holy Spirit. Oh, he's here. Oh, oh, oh.
 Yeah, what degrees of Holy Spirit here?
 And so I'm trying to be very, very careful in what I'm saying.
 Yeah.
 Without making a point large on the point I'm making.
 Yes.
 But I don't think God cares what your building looks like is mostly what I'm saying.
 Right.
 I don't think he cares.
 I think he's looking for hungry hearts.
 Yeah.
 We'll make room for him when he shows up.
 Wow.
 We already mentioned John and Carol.
 So for those of you who don't know, our spiritual mom and dad, John and Carol Arnett, our pastors in Toronto, who in 1994 had the Holy Spirit show up at the church that literally changed everything.
 You could draw a line down the churches of the world as the Holy Spirit showed up and did something amazing in 1994.
 And so many ministries birthed out of that.
 So much world revival happened out of that.
 And there's huge similarities between Jeff and Becky, our current passes and leaders.
 Yeah.
 And John and Carol are passes and leaders for so many years when we lived in Toronto.
 Talk about some of the similarities you see between the two of them and drive some of
 the characteristics of a leader that you've grown a love.
 Well, not just the height differences.
 I think, you know, it's funny, both Jeff and John have that thing where they seem like they're being
 random and they may even think they're being random, but it's totally the Holy Spirit, but
 they're willing to go with God on anything, even if they don't get it. And, you know, I love that.
 They both really feel like dads and, you know, obviously Jeff doesn't feel so much like a dad to
 to me as John does, but maybe because we're closer in age.
  </li><li>Right, different seasons of life as well.
  </li><li>But Jeff has this real dad thing
 and this real fierceness and protection
 over his people, over his kids,
 which I've seen many times in John as well,
 just the fierceness of like, oh yeah,
 he's serious about the people that God's given him.
 Becky, I think, is a lot like Carol right when the revival first started.
 Just really, Becky is, she loves everybody.
 She hugs everybody.
 She kisses everybody.
 That's Carol.
 Yeah, they both have this fierceness about them, that when the Holy Spirit's on them.
 I mean, we joke when Becky gets up and takes a microphone.
 There's no mess in our hunt.
 Watch out because, again, neither of them want the platform, neither of them are hungry
 for the microphone.
 Yeah.
 So when they do get up to speak, you better believe that the Holy Spirit set them on fire
 for that.
 Yeah.
 I think also the similarity between Carol and Becky is they both love Jesus.
 Yeah.
 They both love the Holy Spirit so much.
 And you can tell about both of them that that's a two-way street.
 Yeah.
 protectiveness of the Lord for those two women.
 That there's, you know, if there's favorites, they're definitely at the top of that, the
 Christmas list.
 They're also both very prophetic.
 Yeah.
 Both super prophetic, knowing what the Holy Spirit is doing or saying.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I remember when I first, when we first moved here and started hanging out with Becky and
 I just thought, there's no way she's that nice.
 like there's no way she cannot actually be that nice.
 And I thought, I'm just gonna watch her for a while,
 you know, and I remember about six months in thinking,
 I think she might actually be that nice.
 Like, you know, that she's,
 it's hard to put into words just how sweet Becky is.
 She's just, I've never heard a mean thing come out of her mouth.
  </li><li>Right, no malice, no dial, just affection and love.
  </li><li>Yeah, and she loves everybody.
 and so gracious as well.
 Yeah, very forgiving, very loving.
 And out of that love, there's a real wisdom.
 Like I think about times we've been in meetings
 and we will have been talking and then Becky will say,
 I've been thinking about that
 and whatever she is gonna say next,
 you know is gonna be bathed in kindness.
 And really brings it just a completely different perspective
 that's so vital where you're like,
 Oh yes, there's a question in the room.
 Thank you.
 Yes.
 One of us in this room is going to have an Enitz Becky.
 I remember when we first met Jeff and Becky.
 Like we came here with John and Carol, and we did a school.
 Yeah.
 The four of us, John and Carol and you and I.
 And we met Jeff and Becky, and I so impressed by both of them.
 They're loved for the Holy Spirit.
 They're priority for his presence.
 there. I mean, no sense of trying to build anything for themselves, only interested in
 hosting the presence of God, which to this day is still the same. Their whole goal is
 to create an environment that the Holy Spirit would love to be welcomed in. And I just love
 that about them. I've told the story before, but it's one of my favorite stories about
 Jeff. We, every couple of months, we run some Wednesday night classes and this particular
 occasion. We were running, I forget the classes, we had a prophetic class going on. I remember
 that because we were teaching a prophetic class. Jeff had just started doing worship.
 So, you know, I think we should offer worship on a Wednesday night. So we're like, great.
 And then there was a couple other classes running one in the cafe and one in one of
 the other rooms. So we're like, great. And so the worship team was in the auditorium
 where we have a Sunday service. I was in another room and the two other classes were
 in a different room. So we did it for the first week, came back the next week and we
 just debriefing. How did it go? How many people showed up? Do we need to change stuff
 for logistics and chairs? What do we need to change? Only three people showed up for
 Wednesday night worship. That's a major hall that seats several hundred people. A lot of
 people showed up for some of the classes. Why don't we move the classes around? Let's
 put worship in a smaller room. Let's move the prophetic class in a slightly larger room.
 move this class into a bigger room and it all made total sense and so we're all good and we're
 like, okay, great, we'll let our facilities manager know, we'll set up the chairs and we're about to
 move on. And Jeff, ever so meekly, like this is the guy that runs the church, Jeff and back here
 are senior leaders. And he posits this, he was like, I just wonder, I'd like to make a suggestion.
 He said, you know, we don't have much in the terms of our building. But I think we could all
 I agree that the best room that we do have is the auditorium.
 I know it doesn't make sense to only have a small number of people in that large room,
 but I'd really like it if the best room could be given just sacrificially to the Lord.
 As he said that, the Holy Spirit's presence fell in the room and we're like, "Yes."
 -Okay. -Of course.
 -That makes so much sense. -Let's move this back to you.
 And that's just a simple example of their heart to just, and that trickles down.
 And so you see that value because they have that value, our staff have that value.
 And I'm so grateful for Jeff and Becky and for their ability to steer the ship.
 I feel so safe when they're here because they, despite the fact there'll be times
 on a Sunday when Jeff has said publicly, I don't know what we're doing.
 I feel safer with Jeff and Becky quote unquote, not knowing what they're doing.
 Yeah, then with me knowing what I'm doing.
 Yeah.
 Anything else you want to say about our church culture?
 No, I think that's good.
 OK, very good.
 We got some listeners questions.
 We've got as browsing through our archive of listeners questions that we need to get back to.
 We've got several on relationships.
 I want to see if we can knock those out in the next couple of weeks.
 Here's the first one.
 This is a question from Michael.
 Hi, Michael.
 He's this is a great question.
 I love it.
 Hey, Alan, AJ, I had a question about if God will tell you the person you're supposed to marry.
  </li><li>Brilliant question.
 I feel like I have a promise from God about a person,
 and I've been deceived one other time before
 when I was a teenager.
 Does God even tell you who you're supposed to marry,
 and how can I know if I'm being deceived?
  </li><li>Well, how can you know if you're being deceived?
  </li><li>I'll tell you how you can know if you're being deceived.
  </li><li>Go ahead. - Yeah.
 Once you get married, if the person you marry
 was the person that God told you,
 then you were deceived. - And you were not deceived.
 Gosh, I mean, I guess there's a bunch of different thoughts
 on this. I've heard people talk about the one I don't necessarily hold to the the one
 theory. Not do I? Because all it takes is for one person to marry the wrong person and the
 rest of us are in trouble. You know, we've all missed are the ones because somebody married
 the wrong one or whatever. Right.
 So, and I've seen it go really badly where somebody has gotten, you know, they feel that
 they've gotten the revelation that this person is supposed to be my spouse, but that person
 has not had the same revelation.
 So that again.
 So I've seen it go really badly.
 Where one person, say Bob, gets the revelation that Susie is supposed to be his bride, but
 Susie is like, I'm not interested in you at all.
 And I actually want to marry this person over here.
 You know what I mean?
 Like, so I think if you are already dating this person
 and you have a relationship and you know what I mean?
 Like, and that's a legit thing.
 And the Lord starts talking to you about marriage.
 I'd feel more comfortable with that.
 I'd probably be a little bit leery of, you know,
 hey, see that girl across the room?
 That's your wife.
 Now I've heard of that working out a couple times.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know what doesn't work out though in that situation?
 When you walk up that process, I hate you.
  </li><li>You are my wife.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 That's a great way to get yourself labeled to creep.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Don't do that.
  </li><li>Right.
 And I mean, I've also, you have to,
 I guess I need to temper it with,
 like I had somebody who was convinced
 that I was supposed to be their wife.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And would follow me from place to place
 and tried to give me a ring and all this kind of stuff.
 And I was like, go away.
  </li><li>And then we got a restraining order.
  </li><li>Right, literally.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So, you know, it can kind of appear psycho.
  </li><li>But you, the Lord told you I was gonna marry you.
  </li><li>Yes, but in a different way.
 So how that happened was the Lord had given me a list
 and he had said to me one day when I was journaling
 and I had completely given up on the idea
 of getting married again.
 He had given me this list and he said,
 the man I have for you will pursue you.
 He will wear you with kindness.
 He gave me this list of eight things.
 And I remember reading the list and thinking,
 this man does not exist.
  </li><li>No, forged in the minds of Scotland.
  </li><li>Or if he does.
  </li><li>Body of a Greek god, huge from stone.
  </li><li>Yes.
 I thought, or if he does, he's already married.
  </li><li>He's on a boat from Scotland.
  </li><li>He's done a boat from Scotland.
  </li><li>Coming your way.
 So, so when I met you and I mean, I had no idea that you were him until we had our first date and you
 I'm flexed my pecs. That's right. That's right. If you'd done that, I would have known right away
 because that was like number nine pecs of a Greek god. So we went out when we went out for our first
 date, you had journaled that morning and you said, you know, Lord, will you help me put into words
 what my heart is and you read my list back to me like word verbatim with two extra with two with
 two extra um but i remember sitting there and you're reading this list and you started with
 i'm going to pursue you i want to wear you with kindness and i was like uh i know this list and
 i literally ran away from the table i'm vomited because i knew yep there it is um i knew like i'm
 I'm sitting across from the person that I'm going to marry.
 But interestingly, God deliberately did not tell me that you're going to be
 wife. I mean, I asked him outright and it was frustrating to me because prior to
 that, God had told me pretty much everything major that was going to happen
 to my life 12 months before it happened.
 Right.
 So I'm thinking surely God's not going to hide this from me.
 Like the opportunity to screw up my life surely is going to direct me.
 Yeah.
 And when I said to the Lord, I said, Lord, as age, you're going to be the one that
 I'm going to marry.
 And he said, I'm not telling you.
 And I said, "Well, why not?"
 And he said, "Because when things inevitably go through difficulty, I don't want to be
 your scapegoat because I know what's going to happen.
 If marriage gets hard, you're going to be like, "Maybe I didn't hear from God or maybe
 I missed it.
 Or you're going to blame me.
 You told me to marry her."
 Yeah.
 So you get to marry her if you'd like to.
 But that's going to be your choice.
 Right.
 And didn't he also say something to you about no woman wants to be pursued by somebody who
 knows they already get them in the end?
 Right.
 Yeah.
 I said that.
 Well, that's exactly what the Lord said when I was past for him.
 So here's the thing Michael, we know stories of people who genuinely heard from the Lord
 that this is going to be their person and against all odds, against all cultural differences
 and even country differences.
 They met their spouse, they got married and it worked out brilliantly.
 We also know other stories where people think they heard from the Lord, this was going to
 be their spouse and it absolutely wasn't.
 We've got a list of those horror stories.
 So can God tell you that?
 Sure.
 I make that the major pillar on what you're doing, I'd be very cautious about putting
 all your weight on one prophetic word about anything.
 Yeah, and I would also keep it to yourself.
 So like, you know, even after Alan and I had that date and I am sitting there and I now
 know that he is the person I'm going to marry, Alan didn't know that yet.
 And so I didn't tell him anything.
 It wasn't until we got engaged that I actually told him about the list.
 about that whole time that I had with the Lord and PEI and whatever.
 Because he needed to make his own decision.
 And again, I've seen a lot of, I mean, primarily, I guess,
 I've seen women do it, but I'm sure there's been men
 that have done it as well, but of women just saying,
 I know that this person is my spouse,
 and so they're praying, controlling prayers,
 or they're going up and telling them, like,
 you're my spouse and we're supposed to be married and blah, blah.
 And I'm like, there's no way that ends well.
 There's no way it ends well.
  </li><li>And that, I think that was one of the things
 I really appreciate about you
 because in our dating relationship, I went up and down.
 I mean, I remember one time just thinking,
 I'm not, I need to break up with you,
 just out of integrity because I don't think
 I'm gonna marry you.
 So I've got no business dating you.
 And you didn't play your ace card,
 but God said that you're gonna be,
 you know, you just let it run its course.
 And I so appreciated that in hindsight
 because I had to go through the,
 I'm not sure I wanna do this,
 I need to back out with this
 and actually work through my fear of commitment issues
 or you know, the litany of issues really.
 And you didn't short circuit that
 and I felt super protected by you
 in honoring that revelation.
 And like I said, I made the decision to marry you
 because I wanted to marry you not because
 I had to prefer the word, but at the same time,
 I'm not dissing people who do.
 I know people, good friends of mine,
 bona fide a real deal who hurt the Lord, but also their track record for hearing the Lord
 is significantly higher than the normal population.
 So I remember when I was a teenager convinced that God told me how he was going to marry
 and that obviously did not turn out to be true.
 And that was not the Lord.
 When I look back on my consistency and ability to hear the voice of the Lord, my gosh, I
 couldn't discern my own thoughts from the enemy's thoughts from the Lord's thoughts.
 but I didn't have the wisdom to know that.
 So I'm not sure how that answer has helped you,
 but there's our perspective on that.
  </li><li>I think Michael, what I would encourage you with is
 if you really feel like there's somebody
 that God has highlighted to you,
 put aside the whole,
 I think you're supposed to be my spouse thing
 and ask them out for coffee.
  </li><li>Oh wow, there's revelation.
  </li><li>And just see where it goes,
 but don't put that on the table.
 Don't put that, I think you're my spouse on the table.
 You know, because that would be the fastest way to get the reverse result.
 Right.
 That's a terrifying opening for a conversation as well.
 So I ask you for coffee because you are the one.
 Yeah, bad idea.
 Quickly, bad idea.
 Unfriend, walk.
 All right.
 Well, we're going to answer more relationship questions next week, but for now we're going
 to wrap up.
 We talked about Grace Center.
 We actually have a job opening that we'd like to talk to you about.
 We have three actually.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, we do.
  </li><li>Yes.

 and can help us create an environment
 that people are gonna love to come to be in,
 then let us know.
 We would love to hire somebody who can lead a team
 of people to create an amazing environment
 for people to enjoy fantastic coffee.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 We are also looking to hire a children's pastor.
