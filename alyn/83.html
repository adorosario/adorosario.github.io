<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to keeping up with the jones is episode 83 the Christmas edition the Christmas edition merry Christmas baby thanks did you have a good one.
 I did before we get to the excitement of Christmas day it's worth knowing that we are on vacation we are and it feels amazing it does.
 I love working but given the choice i prefer being on vacation once a year i don't know i i kind of miss people but yeah it's nice to like sleeping in chill having said you miss people when we've had a house full of people.
 No i like i don't miss people in general i miss specifically the people that we work with i see that makes a little more sense yeah well the good news is you gonna see them in a week time i know i'm not like dying or crying in a corner making a puddle or anything i'm just saying.
 I really like who we work with.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 That's, that, that seems very, very fair.
 Okay.<br/>
 We have had a very social season.<br/>
 Very crazy.<br/>
 For this last week.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It's been super social.<br/>
 It is the season to be social.<br/>
 True.<br/>
 Starting with last week when we saw<br/>
 store our worries with our friends.<br/>
 We're not going to talk about Star Wars just yet.
 And we will tell you if we're going to talk about it
 so you don't need to be friend about spoilers.
 And indeed we're not going to give any spoilers,
 but we'll talk about that in a second.
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 We went to see Star Wars.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Then we had crazy weather.<br/>
 Crazy weather.<br/>
 Like we put a bunch of cushions in our bathtub and got everything ready because
 the downstairs bathroom is the place to be in a tornado.
 In a tornado.<br/>
 And we were under full tornado watch.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And tornado warning.<br/>
 I forget which one's the most severe one.
 Warning, I think.<br/>
 Well, all the sirens were off, which means a tornado touched down.
 Yeah, they were all going.<br/>
 And poor Cindy who'd been celebrating fake Christmas with us was due to leave
 the next day to drive to Florida to be with her family.
 But when we looked at the radar, the path of the tornado was the exact route she would have been driving.
 Yes, the whole storm system, like the Supercells and everything was exactly on 65.
 And she was like, "No, no, I'll totally be fine.
 We're like, we don't care. You're not leaving."
 Not going.<br/>
 So we duct taped her to the wall and then let her free the next day.
 We stapled her a bit too, because the duct tape wasn't working great.
 And so, yeah, we had sirens going.<br/>
 We got the kids all into the bathroom.
 bicycle helmets on.<br/>
 Yeah, it was a brutal day of storms, and it definitely did damage.
 It just didn't do damage where we live at the moment.
 Which was, we're very grateful for that.
 Very thankful, yeah.<br/>
 And then Christmas Eve Cindy left.<br/>
 We sent her packing to Florida.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And then Richard and Michelle who were driving out from Florida to spend Christmas with us.
 Arrived.<br/>
 They arrived.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And then Christmas Day we had three other friends join us.
 Yes.<br/>
 So we had seven adults and three kids.
 We also did our ticket to ride on Christmas Eve.
 Explain ticket to ride ticket to ride.
 It's actually an idea I got from the meaks, but it's they, you know, they look under
 their pillow and then one night there just be a ticket under the pillow, which means
 they get out of bed in their pajamas, get in the car and we ride around and look at
 all the different Christmas lights and stuff and drink hot chocolate and eat cookies in
 the car, which as mundane as that sounds, they love it.
 They love it for some strange reason.<br/>
 They get so excited.<br/>
 So, they squealed when they found the ticket.
 But then they hate the hot chocolate and then they get bored with the lights.
 Well, no, you get bored with the lights.
 They don't get bored.<br/>
 They're never wanting to leave by the time you're wanting to leave.
 No, I don't think that's true.<br/>
 No, it's absolutely true.<br/>
 I think they were severely bored.<br/>
 You wanted to leave half a song in.<br/>
 You're like, well, we've done it.<br/>
 We've seen, you know, I'm like, no.<br/>
 But I think we made a mistake in bringing the leaf.
 Why?<br/>
 Because they couldn't see anything.<br/>
 We were like crammed in like little sardines.
 If we were in the minivan, it would have been better.
 We've always used the minivan before.<br/>
 I think I think we learned a valuable lesson.
 Oh, it's such a valuable lesson.<br/>
 I'm writing it down in my personal prayer journal this minute.
 Okay.<br/>
 Good. Okay.<br/>
 So anyway, back back from ticket to ride.
 Um, Christmas day was awesome.<br/>
 Seven adults, three kids, many presents, except not for me, you were
 Abby.<br/>
 No, because we all got bikes, right, which was fine.
 Yes.<br/>
 Am I right thing we couldn't cycle on Christmas day because it was crazy?
 It was crazy.<br/>
 The weather was still crazy.<br/>
 Oh, that's right.<br/>
 But we cycled the day before and the day after.
 That's right.<br/>
 Cause Christmas Eve was gorgeous.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Because the supercell system came through with all the tornadoes and everything.
 The next day was like spring.<br/>
 It was unbelievably gorgeous.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yes, that's right.<br/>
 Anyway, where were we Christmas day?<br/>
 You cooked amazing food.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 And then Boxing Day, we hung out with Richard Michelle and educated them in the
 ways of the Marvel cinematic universe.
 Well, which is a very important education apparently.
 Well, we were shocked that there was large gaps in their Marvel viewing.
 I don't know if I would say I was shocked.
 But I'm not sure.<br/>
 You weren't shocked?<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 I was shocked.<br/>
 I was bald.<br/>
 No, I'm appalled when people haven't seen Star Wars, like four, five, and six.
 I don't care that much about the Marvel movies.
 OK, well, they're good.<br/>
 I like I educate them in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
 You did.<br/>
 Darn it.<br/>
 Congratulations.<br/>
 And then the night we went to see your cousins for tacos because they know it's very well.
 Yes.<br/>
 and they were excellent talk.<br/>
 All told, that's an awful lot of people in a short amount of time.
 It was, but it was good.<br/>
 It was full of life.<br/>
 But then today I kind of crashed.<br/>
 You did.<br/>
 I was like, I'm so done.<br/>
 But I went for a bike ride and I came back feeling better.
 You did.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 You felt much better.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And I bike road almost six miles.<br/>
 Look at you.<br/>
 You're unbelievable.<br/>
 On hills.<br/>
 You're like a cycling athlete.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Okay, can I just tell you those slow hills, they're horrible.
 The like slow incline up.<br/>
 I'd much rather have a steep short hill and one of those ones that last forever.
 All right, let's go back in time for a second.
 And let's talk about Star Wars.<br/>
 Now, if you haven't seen Star Wars, we're not going to reveal any plot details.
 There's going to be no spoilers.<br/>
 However, we are going to give you our opinion of Star Wars and that might be
 enough to send you over the edge.<br/>
 So if you want to skip ahead, can we try something?
 What's that?<br/>
 Well, one of us is giving their opinion, because the other one softly hum the
 Star Wars theme in the background.<br/>
 No, I'm featuring that.<br/>
 Softly humming never works.<br/>
 Why?<br/>
 It would be awesome.<br/>
 You don't want to try it?<br/>
 No, not even remotely.<br/>
 I'll just have it in my head.<br/>
 OK, you that you're happy placing your head.
 What did you think of Star Wars?<br/>
 I loved it.<br/>
 And your expectation for super hygiene
 you still loved it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Favorite moments that you can't tell because you can't give away.
 If I can't do a spoiler, I, you know, I, yeah, I just loved it.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I like all the characters.<br/>
 I liked every single character.<br/>
 Yeah, it was.<br/>
 It was a believable.<br/>
 It was a real treat.<br/>
 It was an absolute nod to all the Star Wars fans.
 And I thought JJ Abrams did a great job.
 Fantastic job.<br/>
 the end and the millennium fucking is still awesome.
 Not the end because they just mentioned the millennium.
 All right, let's talk about the end.<br/>
 Let's talk about Christmas day.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 You made salmon.<br/>
 I made what?<br/>
 You made snowman.<br/>
 It's like having no reason to say it.<br/>
 You made snowman.<br/>
 I assure you, I didn't.<br/>
 I don't know what happened there.<br/>
 Tell me about your schmaman.<br/>
 My salmon.<br/>
 The salmon was a stuffed salmon, which is a recipe that I invented a number of years ago.
 What, you invented this?<br/>
 This is my recipe.<br/>
 Okay, you'd never seen it done before?
 No.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 All right, go on.<br/>
 What I had done before was I had stuffed chicken breasts.
 You know, where you slice them almost absolutely in half and then you stuff them with things.
 And I was stuffing them at one point and I thought gosh I wonder if you could just make a stuffed salmon
 So I did one year and I just sort of winged it and it worked really well
 So I wrote done everything I did and that's how I've made it ever since so tell us how you make it
 I actually think we have a link to the recipe on our website somewhere
 We probably do if we do I'll put it in the show notes
 Yeah, but basically you get two large pieces of salmon. Yeah, it depends on how many people are eating it
 But yeah, I got two large pieces of salmon and then you saute
 Garlic onions spinach mushrooms.<br/>
 Um, I suppose you could start to say whatever you want.
 Actually, I don't usually start to say that.
 Oh, this is fast.<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
 You asked me this.<br/>
 Anyway, you just basically put one piece of fish.
 Nevermind.<br/>
 Just look at the recipe.<br/>
 OK, quality content.<br/>
 This we can't keep in with the gym.<br/>
 Well, I just suddenly realized how boring it was sounding even to me.
 But we make crispy potatoes.<br/>
 Oh, I love crispy potatoes.<br/>
 So good. All right.<br/>
 And I made a whole quinoa salad that I forgot to put on the table.
 So we had dinner for later.<br/>
 Yeah, we had that at night.<br/>
 It was good.<br/>
 And I was sad that I hadn't remembered to put it out.
 And then you made paleo donuts.<br/>
 I did. And I made a pavlova.<br/>
 You did make a pavlova.<br/>
 Describe a pavlova because not many people will know what pavlova is
 and then describe where you got it from.
 OK, your mother taught me how to make it.
 And it is your mother's recipe for a New Zealand pavlova,
 which is essentially an American meringue.
 I mean, I mean, what's wrong with us?<br/>
 We're having food related vocabulary difficulties.
 I'm a little bit.<br/>
 It is a, what's it called?<br/>
 A ring.<br/>
 It's essentially a meringue, but it isn't quite as crunchy as a bit gooey in the middle.
 It's a gooey meringue with whipped cream and then raspberries.
 Yeah, and the raspberries help with the sweetness.
 Our main topic for this week, I was thinking it's the last podcast of this year.
 It is.<br/>
 and I wanted you to look back on 2016 and name five of your favorite things from this year.
 Okay, but that will be very prophetic of me because it's 2015.
 How will I just look back on 2015 instead?
 All right, 2015.<br/>
 Five of your favorite things from 2015.
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, you're taking too long.<br/>
 Do you want to hear my first one?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Okay, we got an Amazon Echo.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And for those of you don't know what an Amazon Echo is, it's about the height of two
 or maybe three cans of like beans stacked together.
 Two.<br/>
 Cylindrical tube that just plugs into your electricity outlet
 and then connects your Wi-Fi network.<br/>
 And when we bought it, it didn't do much.
 It was it's kind of like whole house Siri.
 So if you're used to using Siri on your iPhone, it's like a Siri device
 for your house and activated just by saying Alexa. You just say Alexa and away she goes,
 and I apologize if you're listening to this in the ear shot of Alexa because right now she's
 probably asking you what you want. But anyway, you can ask her all sorts of things. And initially
 when we got her, you could ask her to spell words, you could ask her to do mathematics,
 do set timers, that sort of stuff. But it seems like every month I get an email from the developers
 Amazon saying hey we've integrated this feature this feature this feature this feature to the point is just getting better and better isn't she yeah to the point now where.
 She is pretty much running major aspects of our house electrical aspects of our house yeah but also your shopping list as well you can just ask Alexa to order you stuff from Amazon arrives at your doorstep to this later.
 So we can say Alexa turn on our downstairs lights and all our lights come on or Alexa dim the kitchen lights or Alexa turn on the Christmas tree turn off the Christmas tree lights that sort of stuff.
 But she also integrates with her nest thermostat so you can tell her to set the temperature you want to be a.
 What we're seeing is just this rapid increase in the inner connectivity of the things in our house which is amazing because.
 Prior to alexa i do three different apps to control all the different lights and electronic functions of our house or you had to walk over and use your finger to throw this way.
 What are you going to call them horrible but now alexa you just be sure the last thing i want them to integrate is alexa with sonos which is our home house.
 Sound sound system yeah.<br/>
 Because right now you can ask Alexa to play anything from your music list but it just comes through her tini speakers rather than through our house system so number one on my list.
 Was the Amazon echo Alexa.<br/>
 It feels like we're living in our future when we get to one around our house telling her to do things.
 Love it true very cool number one on your list baby number one on my list is a kitchen item called the green pan.
 and I got them at Williamson, San Noma.
 And I actually, I got them as a replacement for the previous enamel pans that I had gotten.
 So, you know, we're using all non-toxic pans.
 So...<br/>
 So what would toxic pans be?<br/>
 Teflon is toxic.<br/>
 So you can use stainless steel or you can use enamel.
 Those are the only two things that aren't going to leach toxins into your food.
 Okay.<br/>
 The problem with using stainless steel presumably is it's sticky.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So I still use stainless steel for some things.
 And then my lacruse has enamel and then these pans have enamel.
 So they're black enamel finished, so they kind of look like they might be teflon,
 except you can tell when you actually feel them or whatever that they're not.
 But they're amazing nonstick pans.<br/>
 And they're a dream to wash up.<br/>
 You just run a sponge over them once and they're totally clean.
 And this is your third revision because you'd previously bought some nonstick pans from Williams and Sonoma.
 Yeah, I had bought the Henkel ones and I really like them.
 They had great weight and good heat distribution, but they eventually lost their non-stickiness.
 So that's useless for me.<br/>
 So you took them back?<br/>
 I took them back a year later.<br/>
 Literally a year later.<br/>
 And Williams and Sonoma said, "Oh yeah, we'll replace them."
 Without even a receipt.<br/>
 They were like, "Yep."<br/>
 I mean, granted the lady at Williams Sonoma does know me.
 Sad, but true.<br/>
 But I chat with her, even if I'm walking through the mall and I see her, I'll go in and say hi.
 I brought them in and said, "Hey, look, the surface is coming off of them."
 And she said, "Have you tried the green pan?" And she didn't own them yet, but she said she
 tried them cooking while at Williams and Snowman really liked them. So I was like, "Alright, well,
 try it. If you don't like it, come back." I was like, "Okay, they're amazing."
 And to be fair, you cook every single day, so they make your life easier.
 Alright number two on my list. Yep. I didn't think I'd like it but I do. It's Apple Music.
 Apple Music. It doesn't need a theme song. So when Apple Music came out we signed up for the 90
 day free trial, the three month free trial and I was kind of like, I was a previous Beats,
 what are they called? Beats Audio? I don't know. And I quite like that. I just found Apple Music
 so confusing like what's my library, what's not. I don't understand why this is working,
 my suggestion stuff to me, I don't really like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
 So it never really went anywhere with me.
 I didn't really like it.<br/>
 And then it didn't work with Sonos, which is primarily how we listen to music at home.
 So I stuck to Pandora and Amazon Music and I forget whatever else we had.
 But just last week, Sonos had emailed me and said, "Hey, would you like to be a beta
 user of Apple Music on Sonos?"<br/>
 And I was like, "Sure."<br/>
 So I signed up for an Apple Music account.
 And suddenly, especially playing it through Sonos, it worked brilliantly.
 And I was like, "Ah, this is amazing."
 And then when Bethel Kids launched their Kids album, and I showed the kids that they just
 fell in love with it.<br/>
 So, you know, Apple Music, for the last couple of weeks that we've been using it, I've really,
 really enjoyed it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And the ability to just almost search any music on Earth and add it to your music collection
 just seems like a bizarre way to live.
 I enjoyed it at Christmas time because I got to listen to Pentatonix Christmas in Johnny's
 Swim Christmas.<br/>
 You know, Johnny's from my get, but Pentatonix I maintain is the only thing that's wrong
 with you.<br/>
 You're perfect in all your ways except for your passion for really bad acapella.
 It's not bad acapella.<br/>
 It's a really good acapella.<br/>
 Therein lies the problem.<br/>
 Acapella in and of itself is terrible.
 It isn't terrible.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 You're adorable.<br/>
 You're adorable too.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 What's on your number two list?<br/>
 iPad Pro, pencil and keyboard are my number two.
 -Wait, you're still in three for one?<br/>
 -Yeah.<br/>
 -You're just making that a combo deal.
 -Yeah.<br/>
 'Cause they all go together.<br/>
 -You've really fallen in love with this thing, haven't you?
 -I love it.<br/>
 -You thought you would love it?<br/>
 -I thought I would love it just for the art stuff,
 which it is excellent for the art stuff.
 -And you do have an adult coloring book.
 -I do.<br/>
 -And I should say it's not adult in content.
 It's just a coloring book for grown-up.
</p><ul>
  <li>It's a coloring book yet.
 It's a coloring book of animals and things like that.
 It's great for a wind down kind of thing.
 But also watching movies on it is awesome
 and playing cotan on it, obviously awesome.
 So it's, yeah.
  </li><li>I don't understand settlers of cotan.
  </li><li>Well, I'm sorry, but that's my number five,
 so I'm not talking about it right now.
  </li><li>Oh, okay.
 So you really love the iPad Pro pencil keyboard that much.
  </li><li>I do, I love it.
  </li><li>Do you think it will replace your laptop?
  </li><li>I don't know.
 Is there a reason that it can't?
 I'm not confident that it can.
 It might be able to for most people.
 I think my only hesitation is if you're actually sitting down typing, it's not awesome for
 that.
 You mean sitting down with a lab?
 Sitting on your lap.
 Yeah.
 But on a table it's fine.
 On a table.
 Yeah, it's fine.
 Okay.
 but I don't usually sit at a table to write.
 I usually sit on the couch or whatever
 and write like that, and it's not great for that.
  </li><li>All right, my number three
 in keeping with technology is an app.
  </li><li>Oh goody.
  </li><li>It's an app called MoodNotes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And when I downloaded it, I was merely intrigued
 by the premise, and the premise is this.
 You make a note of how you're feeling,
 And then if you leave a negative feeling,
 it asks you some questions like,
 "Hey, well, when did you start feeling this way?"
 All right, when you started feeling that,
 did you believe any of these things
 and it gives you a list of things to pick from?
 And then it says, "Well, have you considered this?"
 And it basically takes you through
 this very scaffolded series of questions.
 And after it's done that,
 it takes maybe five minutes to fill in a response.
 and then ask you to re-rate yourself on the emotions
 that you just put in.
 And amazingly, it has helped me get unstuck so many times.
  </li><li>It's great, it's like having your own personal counselor
 in your phone.
  </li><li>It's incredible.
 In the moments where I get stuck
 and I don't know why I'm stuck,
 I'm in negativity swirl,
 I'm frustrated but I don't know why I'm frustrated.
 I've lost my temper or I'm feeling like I'm sinking
 into despair over something trivial.
 I've learned to pull out my phone,
 log the feeling and respond to the questions
 because the premise behind it is the stuff
 that we taught on the brain science week
 that your thoughts, your feelings,
 and your behavior are all interlinked.
 And if you change one of them, you change the other two.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so it sounds really bizarre
 and it sounds, you know, kind of nonsense,
 but it's really, really helpful.
 I found it to be incredibly helpful in getting me unstuck
 and I've recommended it to anybody who's interested.
 So we'll put a link to all of these things in the show notes,
 but that's called mood notes.
 And I'm very, very grateful to Rand has been a huge help.
  </li><li>Cool, very cool.
  </li><li>Number three for you.
  </li><li>My number three is the factory.
  </li><li>Okay, you're very sneaky
 because you are doing multiple things under one thing,
 which I applaud your--
  </li><li>Thank you.
 I am just maximizing my thankfulness.
 Yes, thank you.
 Okay.
 Yeah, so the factory, obviously because it has three of my favorite places to consume things.
 Well, first of all, describe what the factory is to people who don't live in Franklin.
 The factory is an old factory that used to produce cast iron stoves and things like that.
 that they have converted into like a mall with boutique type stores in it and that kind of stuff.
 It's the original building.
 It's the original building. There's still a lot of the machinery up in the ceiling and
 you know, but it's been a really unique place.
 It's a converted space. Yeah, I love it. And it feels super peaceful.
 It's a great place to go and write and you know that kind of stuff or just people watch.
 And so, and then in addition to it being a great space and feeling great, there's Franklin
 juice there so I can get acai bowls or juice.
 Five dollars a bakery just opened there and honest roster's coffee is there.
 So it's like my happy place.
 The last time I was there they just installed a Jenny's ice cream bag as well.
 It's getting very hard to find reasons to ever leave the place.
 I know.
 Well, we did ask Bill if we could arrange for some beds there somewhere.
 I'm just going to start living there.
 Yeah.
 Well, the kids will see us eventually.
 That'll be fine.
 Yeah, you're an odd duck in that when you want peace and quiet, you go to a really busy place.
 I do, but I put it in headphones.
 But sometimes it's not sometimes the factory isn't that busy.
 Like when you're depends on the time of day.
 There is no way you can go to the factory and not not see someone you know.
 Well, I can probably see someone I know, but if I do put my headphones in most of the time, people leave me alone.
 Okay. All right. My fourth one is something I've never actually seen.
 So I've written down here the late late show with James Corden.
 Right.
 So James Corden is an English actor who's moved to America and has taken over the
 late late show on CBS, is it?
 I don't even know.
 I don't even know.
 No, which begs the question, why is it number four on my list?
 It does.
 The reason it's number four on my list is James Corden is completely endearing.
 he's very funny he's immensely approachable
 and i think he's doing a tremendous job on the late night show even though i have
 never watched a full episode of it
 well the reason i think that is
 he cuts out the best parts of the show and put some on youtube
 and i've enjoyed watching some of his interviews with gas but more recently i
 have really really enjoyed his carpool karaoke segment
 which is where he gets
 singers into a car
 and interviews them while singing versions of their songs together.
 And it's brilliant.
 It's just a stroke of genius.
 He's absolutely relatable.
 He's complete.
 I just so appreciate his sense of humor.
 Maybe it's the British thing, but I think he's doing a phenomenal job and
 a breath of fresh air and we take great delight in showing everybody who comes
 to our house, our favorite episodes.
 Yeah.
 And the stick is that those who, whatever famous singer he has on is keeping
 him company in LA traffic because he's new to because he's new and you know, so it's
 carpool karaoke.
 But yeah, we'll put some links to our favorite episodes in there.
 Yeah.
 All right, baby.
 Number four, my number four going along the lines of devices again, be the Apple Watch.
 I cannot believe that the Apple Watch is not on my list, but it's on yours.
 Talk to me about that.
 I well, first of all, I wanted to watch for a couple of years and didn't have one.
 So I like watches, I like being able to just look without having to find my phone and know
 what time it is.
 I'm a shaper.
 Everything's done in 50 minute units, remember.
 That's right.
 So I love that part, but I love that it tracks things that will inspire me to move more and
 things like that.
 You're of course referring to the green ring, the red ring and the blue ring.
 Yes.
 And I mean, I can look at my watch.
 I know what day it is.
 I want I know that's a big achievement well done seriously I sat at the time I don't know you know hey what is it I don't know but I can look at my watch there is.
 I can see what temperatures outside you know rain stuff like I in an instant I know everything I need to know to make a flash decision I got it so I love that.
 And you're sporting a very beautiful turquoise band.
 I am. It matches my phone case.
 Who got you that? Just out of interest.
 Oh, I must have been very sensitive and thoughtful to get you there.
 Yes. And it also like tells you, like again, you can look at it and go,
 oh, this is my next appointment for, you know, that's coming up.
 Like all the information is on it.
 So right now because we're on vacation, it says no appointments today,
 no appointments today, which is like, yay.
 I'm running fantastical and it says no events, enjoy your day, exclamation mark.
 I love that my watch is telling me to enjoy the day.
 It's mandating your day.
 And as a shaper we need to learn to relax, reflect and relate.
 Yes.
 And so it's telling me those things.
 Yes.
 Alright, lastly number five.
 Yes.
 I fear that I may elicit a groan from you and lots of rolled eyes from our listeners.
 Oh dear.
 genuinely on my top five some of my favorite things of this year has got to be Super Mario 3D world I
 Say this because we got our Wii U for Christmas last year we did and in this year that game
 Gave me a hundred and fifty four hours of absolute joy
 We use as I played the game a hundred and fifty nine times
 Oh, I'm sure you did this whole world with intricate design incredible care
 brilliant puzzles, the most excruciating level ever that must have taken me at least 50 of
 those hours to be. All wrapped up in gameplay that I got to enjoy with the girls and having
 friends over the house, which I needed to actually beat the game, I just thought, "Wow, what an
 incredible opportunity to just unwind." And it served me really, really well. So it definitely
 deserves a place in the top five.
 i'm pretty sure that i lost valuable life units listening to the same music over and over again when you're trying to win it champions road undoubtedly and the fan of the name of the name of that level just gives me great joy.
 Yeah well it was on the tv for months.
 All right so glad to beat that lead us out with your fifth one.
 I'm having a hard time deciding on my fifth one big shocker i know what's your short list my short list is either my bike.
 Which I only really just got but I'm really enjoying it you are you look?
 filled with joy every time you write it. Thank you. Um, yeah, I'm really liking it and or
 Settlers of katana my iPad or iPhone. It's on the iPhone now. Okay, so hang on here's some common ground
 Supermarish 3d world is a video game. Yes settlers of katana a video game. Yes
 Settlers of katana is
 strategic and calming. Okay. I don't believe that Mario world or whatever the thing is called is
 it's probably strategic, but it's not calming because there's too much yelling that goes on at the screen. Yes
 The get in your bubble get out of your bubble. Oh no
 True, yeah playing it certainly raised my blood level but beating it blood level
 well that sounds really bad.
 But pressure that would be the one.
 Yeah playing it did raise my blood pressure.
 But it's like watching an amazing sporting event and getting super excited and excited
 about what could happen and then this is probably when it doesn't happen and blah blah blah blah.
 It was just such an engaging experience for 154 hours.
 Why is why is that weird for me but not weird for you to be playing guitar?
 Well, because Katan, I never yell at either of my devices while playing it.
 It's very calm.
 It's, you know, well, that's not true.
 It's not that you don't yell, but you do.
 It's true.
 No, you do get your little fissing.
 Oh, they stole my sheep and the pile of wood and I nearly had that.
 Never.
 So I was going to trade for a bale of wheat and stuff like that.
 And then when you do weigh them, it shows you that.
 know but when you do win and there's that page of confetti you're like i am the lord of cotan
 honor me by before me peasants
 one time you're playing it in bed and i'd fall asleep and you woke me up to show the
 confetti and you were all you were awake you were verbally expressive about how you are the lord of
 of cotan yes on a regular basis. So while there's no shouting there is verbal explosions
 yes while you're playing that game yes so you understand there's a there's a joy to
 put your life on hold and entering into the realms of video game yes but now I've just
 thought of a third thing under my phone. Great okay so it sounds good to man the bike or
 my Bible, my journaling Bible.
 Okay, talk to him about your journal in the Bible because it's really cool.
 It is really cool.
 So it is, I imagine it's designed for taking notes, but it has these large margins at the
 side.
 And there's something called illustrated faith, which our friend Tiffany introduced us to.
 And it's where you illustrate a passage.
 So you spend some time in the word and you ask the Lord for a picture or whatever sticks
 out to you. And so sometimes it's just words that are written in, right, you know, or sometimes
 you actually draw a picture or you paint or you whatever. But this isn't your reading Bible.
 This is your creativity. Bible is as things stand out to you kind of thing. So it's to
 remember moments with the Lord where he pointed out something to you that became Ray Moore
 to you basically.
 Right. And then you illustrate what's impacted you.
 Yes.
 stickers, print, creative mediums, painting, whatever. And it's quite amazing.
 It is. And it meets both the connection. I feel totally connected while I'm doing it.
 But it also is creative and there's an outlet in it as well.
 Yeah, your creativity level has gone through the roof in 2015.
 Yeah.
 really has. I think I'm just re-valuing something that I used to really enjoy and just stopped
 valuing. So there's a view of our favorite things. It's supposed to be five, AJ managed to throw
 in eight. I think I bumper cropped it. Yeah, well done. It might be actually nine if we're doing
 the pencil in the... Anyway, yeah. 2015 has been an amazing year. We've loved it. We've loved
 everything at work and at home. We've loved journeying through the podcast with you, our listeners.
 Thank you so much for joining us each week. You guys are amazing. We're super encouraged
 by your support. We're looking forward to 2016. We're super excited about what the Lord has for us
 individually and corporately and globally. I think 2016 is going to be a year of incredible
 encounter with God and I'm really looking forward to it. So thank you for tuning in. We will see you
 next week for the first podcast of 2016.
