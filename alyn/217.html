<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 217 of Keeping Up with the Joneses, where this week we're talking
 about feelings again.<br/>
 This podcast is made possible by the generous support of our patrons, and this week we'd
 like to especially thank Mr. Will all the way in England for your generous support, Will.
 Thank you for your encouragement and your tireless support.
 Thanks Will.<br/>
 Babe, what a week.<br/>
 Let's focus on the positives.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So my day--<br/>
 I'm positive it was a crazy week.<br/>
 I'm not one for whining.<br/>
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 But this was a--<br/>
 I think I'm just frustrated with sickness.
 Yeah, it's our third week of having sickness in the house.
 And it peaked this week when MJ and Tia got diagnosed with flu.
 Yes.<br/>
 And we didn't expect them because you were all negative for flu.
 Yes.<br/>
 But I don't know if we were negative for flu.
 And if we'd gone back two days later,<br/>
 if we would have been positive for Fluid,
 because what we had ran the exact same course
 is what they had.
</p><ul>
  <li>Tia decided to add in vomiting for just a little bit.
  </li><li>Well, she likes to vomit, so you know,
 there's just a little bit of excitement.
  </li><li>Aside from sickness, we had a good week
 because Lyle Phillips was teaching in first year.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you were teaching in second year.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And Jeff Daller, famed from last week's episode,
 was teaching at Emmeling.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So all of that was great.
  </li><li>That was all great.
  </li><li>And then the small matter of flooding.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we're currently.
  </li><li>Not us flooding, but Nashville is under like a flood warning.
 It's been running for days and days and days and days
 and days.
  </li><li>And not only that, currently right now
 we're under a tornado watch.
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>Yeah, 60% chance of two or more tornadoes.
 Not a warning, but a watch.
  </li><li>A watch.
  </li><li>Wait, which one's less worse?
  </li><li>I think less worse is the watch
 and then the warning is something's touched down
 in our country. - Okay, so we might have
 those terms changed interchangeably
  </li><li>Don't let us educate you on tornadoes.
 We've only been here 10 years.
  </li><li>We're not under the serious one.
 We're under our other's favorable conditions
 for tornadoes until 11 p.m. tonight.
  </li><li>Oh, good.
 Okay.
  </li><li>I didn't mention that the kids
 go and one freaked them out.
  </li><li>Good idea.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So one of the side effects of the floods was Wednesday nights.
 All your classes got canceled, Grace, huh?
  </li><li>They did.
  </li><li>I'm doing the finger thing a lot.
  </li><li>Look at you.
 Yes, we end up canceling again,
 which kinda sucks because that's two Wednesday nights
 that have gotten eaten out of an eight week course.
  </li><li>The other thing that happened was Friday,
 all the schools got canceled because of the flooding.
  </li><li>It's true, but on Thursday, I got to drive to Atlanta.
  </li><li>Talk about that.
  </li><li>Okay, I drove to Atlanta.
 I had to go to the Canadian consulate
 to sort out some passport issues.
 And so I got an emergency appointment,
 so I left at--
  </li><li>Six AM.
 6 a.m. and drove through rain and fog
 and some of the craziest fog I've ever seen
 through the mountains to Atlanta
 and went to my appointment.
  </li><li>It was a long day for you to be freaked out
 by road traffic conditions as a pretty big deal.
 It was just a rain. - It was raining so hard
 and going through the mountains,
 I hydraplained twice and a truck that was beside me,
 it's back end came out from behind it
 and then got sorted out, but it was crazy.
  </li><li>Well, I'm glad you made it back, same time.
 My hands were cramping from gripping the wheel when I got home.
 The benefit is Friday because we were all off.
 We had a much needed family day.
 We did.
 And today's Saturday and I'm technically in pajamas.
 I only had a shower.
 As you made me have a shower before we got on the podcast, but I've been in pajamas all
 day.
 In fact, my lower half are all pajamas.
 This is the beauty of having a desk right here.
 I do.
 I didn't like him dress.
 I was in pajamas until about two hours ago when I decided that showering and doing my
 hair would look better on video than the look I had going on.
 That's our love for you right there.
  </li><li>There you go.
 Our main topic this week is all gonna be about feelings again.
  </li><li>Well, that's because we got a lot of feedback
 that people really, really enjoyed the feeling of.
 So I don't know if it's because you talked more
 and people like hearing you talk
 or whether it was just a topic in hand on feelings,
 but we got a one piece of feedback.
 Remember how we talked about your--
  </li><li>People had feelings about our feelings?
  </li><li>This is good, you're gonna like this.
 You don't know what this is.
  </li><li>I don't know how we talked about your addiction is TV,
 like Netflix, like zoning out.
 And I commented how I gave you an observation
 that when you play Zelda, it looks a little bit different.
 And then I made a joke about it might just be codependent
 with you about not having Zelda's addiction.
  </li><li>Yes, yes, yes.
  </li><li>Well, an anonymous listener wrote in and said,
 "I really loved that episode.
 "I loved that you guys were talking about feelings.
 "I've just started my own feelings work with a counselor
 "or with a therapist."
 And they told them something about Zelda.
 And this is what they said.
 quote. I wanted to mention that this is from a listener's email. I wanted to mention that
 interestingly Zelda has also been my de-stressor of choice. Something that may be helpful for
 you to know is that my counselor explained that doing two-handed activity is great for
 lessening stress because it uses your right and left sides of your brain. So playing Zelda
 actually de-stresses without checking out or turning your brain off. So cool. Knitting is great too,
 FYI. So you mean you can be knitting instead of playing.
 I'll take Zelda any day over knitting.
 By the way.
 I tried to knit once.
 I thought it was interesting.
 It was not distressing for me.
 I wanted to like poke my eyes out with the needles. It was awful.
 So people want to hear about your feelings.
 Well, I don't know. I think people really liked hearing about your feelings and your journey into
 but somebody did write in and say, hey, I love listening to AJ's journey.
 I'd love to hear a little bit more about Alan's journey.
 Well, not to say you were a robot before, but...
 Potato, lumoid, and drool.
 As a high word of affirmation verse that,
 "This is the abuse I live under. Send help."
 Are you gonna cut out the potato line?
 No, I'm gonna help you.
 Okay, well, I'm not saying you're a cyborg.
 I'm just saying you're not like, you know, like super emotional.
 Are you, you weren't super emotional unless it was negative emotion.
 And then it would come out against your will at times.
 OK, you know, it's a beautiful description.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I think it's I remember we have a we have a friend called Alina.
 And she's one of our friends who's highly in touch with her emotions.
 Actually, Elena's been on the podcast before.
 We've had Elena.
 Come on.
  </li><li>Come on, yeah, I'll put a link in the show
 as to when Elena was on.
 So Elena's this amazing, creative, beautiful soul
 who's fully alive, totally in touch with her feelings.
 And I remember we were having dinner with her
 and her husband Blake, who's also been on the show.
 And I remember at one point watching her emote.
 And I remember me thinking,
 I'd like to be able to do that.
 And I remember reaching across the table and I said,
 I put my hand out on the table and said,
 Elena, would you they answer me and pray for me?
  </li><li>To emote?
 Well, I like watching your feelings, which was kind of a turning point for me, and I'm
 not sure where that was on my journey of getting to know me.
 But you would be right in that I would say that you and I were both fairly more cerebral
 than we were engaged with our hearts.
 Yes.
 You tell stories, what movie did you go to?
 We told everybody in the theater to suck it up.
 Titanic.
 I went with a whole bunch of people from our youth group
 when it came out and there was like 18 of us in a row.
 And of course they're all crying at some point.
 It wasn't even when Buddy was drowning or anything, you know.
  </li><li>Oh, spoiler. - Sorry.
 Hey, they drowned in something.
  </li><li>The ship said. - Who knew?
 But it was some other point and everybody's all like,
 (humming)
 and I just leaned forward and went,
 "Oh, suck it up, would you?
 It's a movie!"
  </li><li>So-- - In the middle of the theater.
  </li><li>I don't think I was as shut down as that.
  </li><li>No, but that was also a long time ago.
  </li><li>But yeah, my go-to move was not my feelings.
 And honestly, I probably thought,
 I probably publicly just said that was my personality,
 but probably privately, I had deluded myself into thinking
 that was spiritual maturity, right?
 'Cause I saw a lot of people,
 their feelings didn't actually serve them well.
 All of their feelings just got them stuck.
 And I kind of pride myself that I never got stuck.
  </li><li>I heard the best quote about feelings this week.
  </li><li>Oh, please.
  </li><li>So Shannon shared this quote,
 and I don't know where she got it from,
 but she quoted it as being from someone else,
 so we'll have to figure that out.
 But she said, "Feeling's are like children.
 "You can't put them in the trunk,
 "but you also can't let them drive the car."
  </li><li>That's very good.
  </li><li>So don't put your children in a trunk.
  </li><li>Or let them drive a car.
  </li><li>Let them drive a car.
  </li><li>But I remember actually doing some ministry
 with our friends Chester and Betsy Kildstra,
 and they rather slyly just said,
 Alan, it seems like you've matured yourself out of needing Jesus.
 That's like, wow. And they're like, well, Jesus, it says to pour out your lament upon the Lord,
 and it says that he binds up those who are brokenhearted and heals those who are crushed in spirit.
 And it looks like you never have any laments, and it looks like you never, you never
 like yourself to be brokenhearted. So just wondering what need do you have for Jesus?
 And I remember like being, I don't have a really have an answer.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But I just thought, well, I thought this one thing
 about being kind of reserved and, you know,
 not stoic 'cause I know stoics bad,
 but kind of reserved and maybe intellectual
 and logical was a good thing and they were pointing out
 like, no, no, no, no, you're hiding from your feelings
 and then actually say those words,
 but that's kind of what they're pointing at.
  </li><li>Yeah, so fast forward to, you go to Sage Hill
 and you start seeing your counselor.
  </li><li>Yep.
 And the main reason for you going to begin with was just to be like,
 hey, I don't have a whole lot of feelings about-
  </li><li>It was less about that.
 Remember it was after my dad died.
 So my mom and my dad died within a two year period.
  </li><li>One year.
  </li><li>I think it was two years.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I think so.
 My mom died and that didn't affect me that greatly.
 I think that sounds kale.
 I don't mean it didn't affect me greatly.
 Obviously it was very sad my mom passed away.
 But what I mean is we knew that my mom was dying,
 we got lots of warning, we got lots of closure,
 we got to fly over, we got to say goodbye.
 It was known, whereas my dad was just one day,
 we got a phone call, he's had a heart attack and he's dead.
 So there wasn't much preparation.
  </li><li>Yes, yes, yes.
  </li><li>And I found that my dad's passing affected me more
 than my mom's passing.
 Now, I don't know whether it was because it was my dad
 or whether it was because both my parents have passed on.
  </li><li>Snowball effect, whatever.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But what I remember is I remember after my mom died,
 I went to see one of our staff,
 Christine Stroup, who's our personal ministry's pastor.
 I just booted an appointment with her and said,
 "Christine, I feel like I'm okay with grief,
 but how would I know, can I just spend
 an hour and a half with you and you just give me some feedback
 on what it's like to be with me?"
 And she was like, "Yeah, I think you're doing good.
 I think you're not in denial.
 I think you're processing it, which was great."
 When my dad passed away, I was aware that I started having
 what I call feelings without my permission.
 Like I'd be sitting in a meeting,
 not thinking about my mom or dad,
 not thinking about anything really,
 and this kind of dark wave would just come crashing over me
 and I would just feel like somebody just pulled the plug on
 all my energy and about five seconds later it would pass.
 And then I noticed that I would come home
 and I was withdrawn from you
 and I was kind of withdrawn from the kids
 and I'm thinking, I recognize
 I am sabotaging my life professionally and personally.
 I had a couple of interactions which I was really, really short
 where I was like, I am not in control of my tongue,
 which is not a good situation.
 So yeah, I looked up Sage Hill,
 which is a counseling practice here in Nashville
 and boot an appointment to go see a counselor.
 Was skeptical, I think, of it?
 Because I was so frustrated.
 Based on what you would say when you would come home,
 skeptical would be a good word.
  </li><li>What? - Suspicious maybe?
  </li><li>Well the whole process feels totally artificial
 because you go in there for an hour
 or one hour of 168 hours in a week.
 To a stranger who you don't know
 and you're trying to present yourself
 and you're, I'm trying to be totally vulnerable.
  </li><li>The best viewer, whatever,
 you're trying to be really human.
  </li><li>I'm trying to be present with him.
 But I don't know the answers to any of his questions
 'cause he's asking me, what do you feel?
 And I'm like, I feel like I want to choke you out
 because all you do is ask me.
  </li><li>How I feel. - How I feel.
 And I remember at one point, same to him, I said,
 I hate this process because I've come to you as an expert.
 Like when I have a plumber, come to my house,
 I say, I have this problem with my toilet.
 Here is some money.
 Please make that problem go away.
  </li><li>I love how you just made it rain for a plumber.
 Make it rain, baby, make it rain.
  </li><li>And so the process of therapy is very different.
 It's like, let's be curious together.
 I'm like, let's not, let's not be curious at all.
 Why don't I just speak, you tell me what the problem is,
 and then we make it stop.
 So after a couple of sessions,
 just as I said to him, I came to you
 'cause I think I'm struggling with grief.
 Do you think that's right?
 And he said, yeah, but that's not the part I'm worried about.
 I said, well, what's the part that you're worried about?
 He said, it's all the repressed grief.
 And I was like, what's repressed grief?
 He said, it's all the stuff you're not allowing yourself to feel.
 And so, man, I thought on that for a week.
 So come back the next week.
 So I jump in, I'm motivated.
 I'm like, hey, I wanna pick up on what you said last week,
 like this repressed grief.
 And he said to me, "It looks like you spend an awful lot
 of emotional energy ensuring you never feel
 a negative emotion."
 I was like, "Huh."
 And I was thinking, "Okay, you're an expert.
 Like I don't want to shoot you down immediately.
 But I'm thinking--
  </li><li>I'll take a little time before I shoot you down.
  </li><li>Well, I'm thinking that's interesting,
 but it could be that nothing negative has ever happened to me.
  </li><li>Which is what you said.
  </li><li>It's exactly what I said.
 I just said, "You know, I live an amazing like full
 blessing, replete with the goodness of God. I'm honestly struggling to think of a negative thing
 that's happened to me. And he looked at me dead, and just said, "Yeah, I'm gonna
 aside from losing both your parents in two years. Yeah, nothing negative." And that, like,
 that hit me like a ton of bricks, like, "Whoa." And so it began the journey that I had spent lots
 of my life perfecting the art of moving away from my feelings. I don't even know the question you
 you ask me, but there's an answer to a question
 you may or may not have asked me.
  </li><li>I, at this point, do you remember anything?
 So, you know-- - The fashionals at work.
  </li><li>It's gonna be fine, it's gonna be just fine.
 So yeah, so you decided to go to Sage Hill
 and work on stuff so that you would be more accessible
 for me and for the kids and--
  </li><li>I just realized I didn't know why I was doing it.
 That sounds like the fruit that happened.
  </li><li>That is the fruit, yeah.
 Honestly, I just went not knowing what I was feeling
 and him pointing out that that wasn't actually great.
 And so we'd sit, there's like a laminated piece of paper
 on the floor with eight feelings on it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you can only say what you're feeling
 from one of those eight feelings.
 And I just, I hated that process.
  </li><li>Well, that was how I felt in group when they were like,
 "How do you feel?
 I feel frustrated.
 What's frustrated out of those eight?"
 I don't know.
 Can you tell me you're the person who happens
 to know what's going on here.
  </li><li>Did you guys know how quickly we moved
 to having somebody else tell us what we feel?
  </li><li>Yeah, well.
  </li><li>And that was the thing that he partnered with.
 I was like, wow, you're really quick to do that.
 Why do you trust me more about your feelings
 and you about your feelings?
  </li><li>'Cause I've been a professional,
 shutting them down my whole life.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So then in this journey,
 your sweet counselor
 invites you to something--
  </li><li>Can I tell the story about what I brought you?
  </li><li>Yes. - Right.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So I'm in counseling for, I don't know.
  </li><li>Five months, four months, something like that.
  </li><li>Yeah, maybe that.
 And I just think, I can't even tell if,
 I'm so desperate to be congruent.
 I'm so desperate to be an accurate representation
 of myself, but I don't know the answers to this question.
 So I have this genius idea, I think,
 I'm gonna bring AJ in with me,
 because AJ is a pretty good lie detector.
 She'll let me know if I'm not being myself.
 Plus I feel a little more confident to be me
 when there's somebody else there who knows me.
 So I just said to my counselor,
 "Can I bring my wife next week?"
 And he's like, "You sure can?
 "Do you know why you want to bring your wife?"
 And I'm like, "Yeah, I explained that."
 Like I just think it'll be kind of like
 a checks and balances thing.
 So great.
 So you walk in and what's the first thing you say?
  </li><li>That he looks like your best friend in Scotland.
  </li><li>Which I didn't realize.
 So one of my oldest and dear friends is a guy called Glenn.
 And the way I found my counselor
 I just want the website and scroll through and just picked who looked the most approachable
 Or who looked the most like Glenn. I didn't realize I'd done that so Glenn in my subconscious
 I visit you every week. He misses you. Yeah, well that is not in my subconscious
 That's for real. I do miss you, but I just thought that was so funny. I didn't even notice that I picked Glenn
 He's so funny. Yeah, so what was it like in that section you sitting with me and my counselor?
 I think it was interesting you felt like you yep to me
 That was good for me to hear.
  </li><li>And as sparring and sometimes cantankerous
 as you can be in real life, so that was pretty normal.
  </li><li>I wanted them to meet you
 because some of the conversations
 I would relay with my counselor about us,
 I don't know if he knew what to think of our relationship.
  </li><li>Why?
  </li><li>Because he would often call if I like,
 you speak like that to each other,
 and I'm like, yeah,
 'cause I guess we're a very, very powerful,
 direct communicators.
 And I don't know, maybe it wasn't used to that.
 So I think it was good for him to see you as powerful
 and resplendent and cantankerous and boisterous
 and argumentative as you are.
 I think that was good.
 But that was definitely a watermark,
 a watermark moment for me.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Having you there is kind of like an anchoring point.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which I'm very grateful you came in.
  </li><li>You're so welcome.
  </li><li>Plus my kids wanted to meet him.
 'Cause every week my kids would be like,
 "Where's Daddy?"
 And we'd be like, "Oh, he's learning about his feelings."
 And so they want to meet him and he's a very nice guy.
  </li><li>Yeah, so he came and met them in the minivan and all that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So then our Glenn lookalight.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Invites you to start going to group counseling.
 (laughing)
 Which I think is where more of the magic happened.
  </li><li>I would agree that certainly magic happened
 in our one-on-one sessions, and I would--
  </li><li>Yes, for sure.
 But I would say for me, it was glacial progress.
 I mean, who knows?
 I couldn't see anything was happening.
  </li><li>I don't think any of us are great at assessing
 what kind of progress we're making with that kind of stuff ever.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 My counselor and I reviewed that.
 I said, "Elon, you came in full of denial
 and just spent X number of months just arguing with me,
 just stuck in denial,
 from denial, denial, denial."
 And then you got acceptance.
 And then, you know, he suggested,
 "Hey, I think you should go group therapy."
 And I was like, literally, I would rather
 bathe in my own vomit than go to group therapy,
 which is a really interesting reaction
 for someone who's never done group therapy.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So you've got to ask yourself,
 hmm, why is that fear so prominent, all right?
  </li><li>And then you came home and told me.
  </li><li>I came home and told AJ,
 "Babe, he wants me to go group therapy."
 And you said--
  </li><li>Aw, hell no.
  </li><li>Are you like to say that as a pastor?
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>My health and the Bible.
 So,
 I was like, wow, better you than me.
 I'm not going to something like that.
 That's awful.
 Yeah, I'd that work out.
 Well, I didn't go this week.
 I was in Atlanta.
 No, but you've done group therapy.
 You've done weekends of the stuff.
 I have and I'm joining next week to try it.
 Allen and AJ in group therapy, we are your podcast host.
 We are learning to feel our feelings
 and be comfortable with them.
 But go into group.
 Yeah, well, I kind of resisted
 And then I basically, here's what I thought.
 I just thought I am paying an expert to tell me what to do.
 I'm an idiot if I don't listen to the expert.
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>And that's what I said to him.
 I said, I don't wanna go.
  </li><li>Do you know what I'm an expert in?
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>When I need back massages.
 And dude, tonight is your night.
  </li><li>That's all we have time for this week.
 Thanks so much for tuning in.
 We're gonna go upstairs.
 I have that on tape, so no takebacks.
 Okay.
 So now I'm not gonna be able to concentrate.
  </li><li>I said back massages, did you hear something else?
 (laughing)
 Oh dear.
  </li><li>So yeah, I came back and I told them, right,
 because you say so.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm gonna go to group therapy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And at first I was like, I don't know what I stepped into.
 Here's what I realized, I realized that I had so orchestrated
 my life that I never found myself in an environment
 where I largely wasn't in control.
 That is not the case when you go to group therapy.
 you are not in control at all.
 So I walk in a room full of maybe eight other men
 who I don't know.
 You're just by looking at them,
 I wouldn't think, yeah, I'm gonna go connect
 to those people.
 And I was not prepared for the magic
 that happens in group therapy.
 Hands down, the most remarkable thing
 that happened to me last year, for sure.
  </li><li>You're so cute too, 'cause you get so excited.
 And then like we're on vacation
 and you're mourning the fact that you're missing group.
 And I'm like, what?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I don't know how to explain.
 Like we've done module one.
 I think we talked about the training
 that we've been doing with Sage Hill.
 Module two is about how you facilitate those groups.
 And I really want to do that
 because I want to know the secret sauce
 behind the magic that makes it all possible.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But yeah, group is amazing.
 I describe it as it's the only place in the week
 where none of my superpowers work.
 Nobody's looking for my wisdom.
 Nobody wants prophetic insight.
  </li><li>You don't have to lead anybody in the group.
  </li><li>In fact, if I even try, everybody will punch me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I mean, verbally.
 I'm not responsible for anybody.
 Nobody's asking me any questions for their benefit.
 It's the one time of the week I am there for me
 and it only works if I'm there for me.
 In fact, if you show up with your denial,
 people will confront you on it like crazy.
 Did we talk about confrontations two weeks ago?
  </li><li>I don't think so.
  </li><li>Talk about confrontations in group.
 I don't fully understand what confrontations are.
 All I understand is if there's anything that is in the back of your head that won't allow
 you to be in the moment, then you're supposed to mention it.
 Is that what you're doing?
 Yeah, a confrontation is anything that will keep you from being present with a group.
 So we all start group with silence.
 I've already shared some silence together.
 Which is weird.
 Yep, and then we do a check-in.
 You've got those eight feelings, like who's feeling what today?
 Okay, so this to me is the funniest part of the whole thing,
 because people will be like,
 I feel sad, mad, angry, lonely, glad,
 and whatever the other one is, right?
 And I'm thinking to myself,
 how do you feel all that at once, right?
 'Cause I mean, she's like, I feel glad?
 Oh, I should pick another one,
 'cause it's not gonna sound like I'm really trying.
 So I almost always have glad.
 And then I'm like, "Ah, ah, ah, I'll just pick one, fear."
  </li><li>No word of a lie.
 Part of the magic of group is you learn your feelings
 by watching other people have feelings and name them.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, everybody else in my group
 obviously knows how to do it
 'cause they'll like mention,
 there's eight, most of them are mentioning five or six.
 And I'm still at like two.
 I got to three once, I was so proud of myself.
 The other weird thing is, you know, if I was to stop me
 to the street just now and just say, hey, how are you doing?
 You know, how are you feeling?
 You probably say fine.
 The difficulty, even I haven't done this for months though,
 when somebody says, hey, how am I feeling?
 Whoa, it takes a while for me to slow down,
 get out of my responsibilities, out of my head,
 and actually dialing on like, what am I feeling?
 And the beauty of knowing what you're feeling
 is you are, of course, more in touch with yourself.
 And if you're in touch with yourself,
 you've got more of you to share with others.
 We're talking about confrontations, right?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So yeah, go through your silence,
 go through your shared feelings,
 which as AJ says is kind of random.
  </li><li>It's random.
  </li><li>And then your confrontations are anything
 that keeps you from being present with the group.
 So the confrontation might be,
 guys, I just need to tell you,
 I just came from a really busy day at work.
 I've got to make a major financial decision.
 I realize if I didn't say that,
 I'm going to be thinking about that the whole time
 and check out and I just want to get that out.
 Or it could be, I have a confrontation with Bob.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So like I could confront you
 for being a handsome Scotsman to say how distracted
 I am having to do this podcast.
  </li><li>That might be weird if it was an inclined group
 and you have to leave.
 Because the sexual tension is brewing between us.
 But my favorite confrontations,
 I call them baby confrontations.
 My favorite confrontations are when things get real
 and everybody has a confrontation with somebody
 like say from last week.
 Like I have a confrontation with you from last week.
 Like I felt like when I was sharing this,
 it felt like you checked out the room
 and I just realized this whole week
 I've been making up this narrative
 about where you were in the room.
 Can you tell me whether that was real or not?
  </li><li>No, I'm scared to start group.
 People just like can't run each other
 about whether they think they were in the room?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, your group might be different.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>From mine, I just made that up.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I mean, you know, the other thing a group
 is everything's confidential.
 So you can share your own experience,
 but the story I just told you was entirely made up.
 But yeah, so it'll be stories like that
 where people are...
  </li><li>Confronting one another.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>The beautiful thing is we all think
 that we've got the best track record
 on how other people are experiencing us.
 We're the last people,
 we're the least qualified people
 to know how we're being experienced.
 And when you're in group,
 people tell you what it's like to be with you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it's vital information.
 I learned a lot about myself by being in group
 because people would give you that feedback.
 And I would solicit it.
  </li><li>Okay, all right.
  </li><li>I would want to.
  </li><li>All right, I'm back to being excited.
  </li><li>It is by far the most powerful thing I experienced.
 experienced last year. But I'm a huge fan of it, a huge fan of it.
 I think they got that. Yeah.
 One of the interesting dynamics about talking about feelings and group work and
 therapy is my norm has shifted. Yeah. Right.
 So everything I'm talking about is totally normal to me.
 I don't know what it's like for listeners hearing about this,
 especially if this isn't an environment you're used to.
 So if you have questions about the process or about feelings or about therapy
 or group work, go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/ask and reach out.
 We'd love to answer those questions.
 I love talking about the whole process.
 I'm excited to learn more about how it works.
 I would love to, well, I don't even want to tell you
 what I'd love to do 'cause I'll just get all hyped for it
 again and we've got back massages to dish out.
  </li><li>Well, obviously since I haven't actually been to group yet,
 I don't know what they do in real group,
 not in weekend groups.
  </li><li>So I'm a identical.
  </li><li>Okay.
 But my observation is that you are much more emotionally attuned to me and to the kids and to yourself.
 In your face previous, Alan?
 That's right. And I see the benefit of it, which is a big reason why I want to go, because I want to grow too.
 Not funny.
 We both had the most negative expectations and have reaped incredible benefits from it.
 Yeah. So anyway, send us your questions about feelings and about group.
