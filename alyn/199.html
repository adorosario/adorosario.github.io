<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Those wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode 199 of keeping up with the jones is where this week we're talking about answer prayer before that happy Canada day.
 Thanks baby.<br/>
 It's like an early fourth of July what well.
 Isn't like Canada Day kind of like a fourth of July type thing?
 I suppose.<br/>
 The start of the country.<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 Yes, it is for Canada Day.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I think it's like 1867 or something like that.
 Pretty good timing that you picked the first of July and not like the 19th or something.
 Right.<br/>
 I mean, it's just, I mean, that's Canadians for you.
 Just clever, clever date pickers.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Did they want to do it in June, but it was towards the end.
 This is not going to be memorable.<br/>
 Let's just let the month roll.<br/>
 That's probably how it happened.<br/>
 Exactly.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 When did you burn down the White House?
 It was, uh, was that in 1812, something like that.
 It's funny because in some history books, when you read it here, it says the British
 came in and burned down the White House.
 That's what I heard.<br/>
 It was the British, but they, it wasn't.
 It was the Canadians.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 But what if that's just the Canadian literature saying like it was Canada
 taking credit for Britain?<br/>
 I don't think the British literature says that it was Britain.
 I'd never heard about it.<br/>
 That's for sure.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Anyway, happy Canada.<br/>
 The day.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 We didn't do anything remotely Canadian today.
 We didn't the kids were asking me questions like how do you celebrate canada is a pretty much the same way that you do the fourth of july.
 You have a big party and you do you know fireworks and usually barbecue stuff and then we would always have a big bonfire the cottage that we did let's just roll all into the fourth of July that's what i figure you bring Canadian flag star party i will just drink i'll just dress and write it might update on your fake instagram.
 story for those of you remember i think last week before we found out that a j head of fake instagram account that somebody started
 thanks to you guys we got shut down i mean i like we talked about it sunday night
 Monday the podcast went live and i think by Tuesday it had been taken down thank you everyone so we're helpful internet i still have vertigo did we tell them that last week no we record last week.
 Remember we did i have all ironies the per you know we do a session on time management and energy management.
 I did the very next week, we were like, yeah, we ran out of time and energy.
 Well, and technically we did therefore manage our time and energy by not doing the podcast.
 We got to like nine p.m.<br/>
 Wasn't on a Sunday night and went to bed.
 No, well, we were like, okay, we need to record a podcast.
 And I'm thinking, oh, yeah, we record this and edit it.
 It was going to be one in the morning.
 Yeah, we're not going to set ourselves up for success.
 So we prioritized, and I'm sorry that we didn't get to spend time with you.
 But what you were trying to say was you got vertigo.
 I did.<br/>
 Last Sunday day, I think I thought that Vertigo was a fear of heights.
 Common misconception.<br/>
 I don't think so.<br/>
 Fear of heights.<br/>
 Wouldn't that be a phobia of some kind?
 Yeah, but I thought that was vertigo.<br/>
 No, you know, for next week's episode, we will check up on who burnt the white
 house down and what vertigo is, but your version of vertigo does what
 the world spins.<br/>
 So it started this time when I was lying down.
 I've had it a couple of times, twice before, once from flying with the cold, I think, is
 how I got it that time.<br/>
 And then other time, I have no idea how I got it that time.
 So it's when the crystals in your ear have moved out of where they're supposed to be,
 and that's what determines your equilibrium.
 And so it affects how you walk.<br/>
 And you started blacking out church this morning.
 I did.<br/>
 I wasn't the Holy Spirit.<br/>
 I know I was talking to Shannon, and all of a sudden I was like, "Oh, the room is
 spinning. And then I was like, oh, everything just went black. And so I,
 I used to pass out quite a bit when I was a teenager. And I always knew,
 like, just follow, run your hands down your legs to your feet to get as low to
 the ground as you can before you fall over.
 I don't know why that's a life skill that you have inside out.
 I know, but I, because I passed out so much and I never knew why I was doing it.
 Uh, so as soon as everything went black, I was like, okay, I just said to her,
 I'm going to pass out and then I just got to the floor in the church and she came over
 and prayed for me.<br/>
 You're such a shaper, such a planner.<br/>
 Okay, I'm now going to pass out.<br/>
 This is my warning.<br/>
 Three, two, one.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So how is our, um, as such for vertigo, how is our week?
 The only thing worth talking about is your birthday.
 That's right.<br/>
 One year older, a hundred years wiser.
 Okay.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah, I quite enjoyed my birthday this year.
 My sister and my nephew and niece were in.
 Yes, they were.<br/>
 And it was great fun.<br/>
 The kids played so well together.<br/>
 They really did.<br/>
 Then we mostly amazing food and I got watch TV.
 But yeah, I was basically we went to pool and we didn't we didn't get.
 Oh, we did see the Incredibles too.<br/>
 We went as a famous Incredibles to really like that too.
 This summer is killer for movies.<br/>
 It is.<br/>
 You really want to go see Jurassic.<br/>
 The Jurassic.<br/>
 You said you didn't until I wanted to take somebody else and then you were like, no,
 I actually, I do want to see it.<br/>
 I think because the first time I saw the trailer was like, uh, I don't know if I want to see
 it, but then I've seen the trailer like three or four times now.
 And there's just, you know, that's the rush of being afraid of dinosaurs.
 You know, you just can't beat it.<br/>
 One of the advantages of having your birthday is you get presents, which I'm a big fan of.
 Yes.<br/>
 One of the disadvantages of birthdays, and this is being completely powerless and blaming
 it on birthdays and not owning my choices.
 We came out of keto.<br/>
 Oh yeah, you did. I mean, we did. Oh, wow.
 That was a job and it was a bus driving over me.
 We came off keto. What's your?<br/>
 I mean, I should clarify. We came off keto temporarily.
 We made some bad food choices for like two days.
 What was the net effect of that?<br/>
 I gained half a pound and I felt like dirt.
 Oh, I felt worse than dirt.<br/>
 I was like, is this how I felt before?
 Like so sluggish. Yeah.<br/>
 And the crashing, the whole crashing quickly thing and just groggy and so
 my throat felt gooey. Yeah. Might do feel like they're wearing sweaters.
 Well, you can brush your teeth and take care of that. Oh, but I think it's all the sugar. I
 maybe. And I feel gross. Yeah. So let's not do that again.
 No, let's find a keto birthday cake that doesn't have sugar in it. Oh, okay. I'll try.
 I'll try and find one made from pork rinds.
 Do you want to talk about your garden and the harvest, which includes proportions
 that are pretty much out of this world?
 It's insane.<br/>
 It it rained for like four days this week, didn't it?
 Like just thunder, lightning, thunder, lightning,
 checked it down with rain.<br/>
 They're just stuck in the house.<br/>
 And so yesterday was finally kind of sunny and I went down to check on the garden.
 And I must have zucchinis that are about two feet long.
 I mean, they are massive.<br/>
 They are bigger than my arm.<br/>
 Yeah, I don't honestly, I don't even know if they're going to taste good.
 Like, I don't know if Zucchini's taste good when they're that big, but good heavens,
 they're enormous.<br/>
 And then I must have picked like eight cucumbers and four jalapenos.
 Like, yeah, I just got a huge harvest.
 So I'm going to try and pawn off vegetables to my neighbors.
 Yeah. Well, our main topic for this week is all about answer prayer.
 Yes. If you think about it, my favorite kind of prayers are answer prayers.
 Technically, all prayers are answered. Look at you. Bill Hybels, the famous American preacher.
 I remember when I was a kid. I remember reading a book that he'd written about prayer. And he said,
 "God always answers prayers. Sometimes he answers them no. Sometimes he answers them yes.
 And sometimes he answers them weight." Yeah. And I was like, "That's really clever,
 but it doesn't make me feel any better for the prayers that haven't been answered yet.
 That's true.<br/>
 Is that what you meant when you said technically all prayers are answered?
 That's exactly what I was thinking of.
 Had you heard the same message?<br/>
 Yeah, I didn't know it was Bill Hybels. I think I heard John repeat it at some point.
 So...<br/>
 Who knows who owns all this revelation, but yes.
 John Wimber, you had this great saying which I didn't understand for a while till I started
 eating out more, but he said the Bible is the menu, not the meal.
 I never understood that.<br/>
 I was like, what?<br/>
 And he said, you know, a lot of people read the Bible as, as that's the goal.
 He said, actually, you read the Bible to wet your appetite for what's available in the Christian life.
 Oh, that's really good.<br/>
 Actually, well, when it starts coming to prayer, I got super excited because basically
 every prayer, because basically God loves to answer the prayers found in the Bible.
 Yes.<br/>
 So any apostolic prayer that you can find is there for us to pray.
 Good. Give us an example.<br/>
 I'll give you a, I mean, just pick up any of Paul's writing or pick up the
 gospels and whenever Jesus pray, start praying his prayers because you know,
 those ones are going to be answered. But I, I mean, I don't know if this is
 normal. I remember feeling persecuted for having godly desires.
 What I mean by that is I remember meeting the Holy Spirit and wanting to
 know more about the Holy Spirit and feeling bad for that.
 Can you imagine how insane that is?<br/>
 Well, I kind of get it.<br/>
 Well, I just thought, Oh, I'm so coronal for wanting to be able to prophesy.
 I'm so coronal for wanting to be able to heal the sick.
 And I don't know why I thought that, but I mean, it's in the Bible to eagerly
 desire spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
 So I felt bad, you know, one in God to do the very thing he promised to do in scripture.
 But anyway, I wonder though, can as a side note, I wonder if that feeling bad is
 actually more not that I'm particularly interested in the enemy, but I think he
 tends to tell that everybody the same lies. And if you can keep you from wanting something
 that actually God wants to give you by just making you think that's selfish or self-promoting or
 whatever, I mean, I think he successfully does that with tons of people. So I wonder if you're
 thinking of ungodly beliefs. Yeah, it's just ungodly beliefs.
 I was thinking about Ephesians long been one of my favorite books to read, but that whole thing's
 pretty much a prayer manual. So you read it and Paul says, "Hey, I'm praying for this."
 And again, Paul is an apostle. I'm like, "Right, a prayer that's recorded in the Bible
 is going to be a prayer that God wants to answer." Listen to this. This is what he says. This is
 chapter 1. I think I'm verse 16, I think. Yeah. "I pray for you constantly asking God the
 glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ to give you spiritual wisdom and insight so that you might
 grow in your knowledge of God.<br/>
 I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light
 so that you can understand the confident hope
 he's given to those he called as holy people
 who are his rich and glorious inheritance.
 I also pray that you will understand<br/>
 the incredible greatness of God's power for us
 who believe him.<br/>
 This is the same mighty power that raised Christ
 from the dead and seated him in the place of honor
 at God's right hand in the heavenly realm.
 So he's basically saying, I want you, my prayer,
 that God's going to answer is that you're going to understand the incredible greatness
 of God's power.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 What version are you reading from?<br/>
 Because that's not a familiar version.
 I'm reading this from the New Living Translation.
 Okay.<br/>
 So this is the passage about a prayer that your eyes of your heart may be enlightened
 that you managed in the hope of your calling that one.
 Okay.<br/>
 Look at you with your NASB.<br/>
 But yeah, basically he's saying that the goal of my prayer is that your heart would
 be flooded.<br/>
 Yeah, the eyes of your heart will be opened.
 Yeah, you're right.<br/>
 Ephesians one.<br/>
 I love that.<br/>
 I remember wanting to be wise and have prophetic insight and feeling bad for one of those things.
 And there is in verse 16, I pray for you constantly asking God to give you spiritual wisdom and
 insight so that you might grow in your knowledge of God. I think that's amazing.
 It is amazing.<br/>
 So for everybody who wants to know God more, that is a prayer that God would love to answer.
 And what I would do is when I would read the epistles or the gospel, or anytime I'd read the
 the Bible and there would be a prayer, I would personalize the prayer and make it mine.
 So having read that, I would be like, "Lord, I'm praying right now that you would give
 me spiritual wisdom.<br/>
 You'd give me insight so that I can grow in my knowledge of you.
 Lord, I ask that my heart would be so flooded with light that I can understand the confident
 hope that you've given to me.<br/>
 And I pray that you would help me understand the incredible greatness of your power, the
 same power that raised Jesus from the dead.
 I pray that that would be my normal everyday bread and butter.
 It kidding me.<br/>
 The Lord loves to answer pretty well.<br/>
 So if you're thinking, man, how do I grow in God?
 How do I come like revelatory?<br/>
 How do I have wisdom?<br/>
 You just ask for it.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Seems simple.<br/>
 Here's my question.<br/>
 Go for your question.<br/>
 What's the difference between a prayer and a declaration?
 I give up.<br/>
 What's the difference between a prayer and declaration?
 Well, I mean, I'm just sort of thinking like you were saying, I pray, you know,
 Father, would you do whatever?<br/>
 I guess I was taught to declare it.<br/>
 So to more say, you know, I have scriptural reason to believe that this is something God
 wants to do.<br/>
 So I'm actually going to declare it as opposed to pray it.
 But I think it's the same difference on some level.
 So definitely in a Canadian and a British person, you see, I was just raised to be polite,
 but you're right.<br/>
 It's already made provision for me.<br/>
 We just need to take it.<br/>
 That's a great point, babe.<br/>
 I think that's brilliant.<br/>
 Yeah, you can make that declaration for sure.
 Like, you know, Father, I thank you that you are giving me spiritual wisdom, that you
 are opening the eyes of my heart, you know, that kind of thing, which I still think is
 prayer, but it's like a declarative prayer as opposed to an asking prayer because we
 already know you want to give it to us.
 Look at you.<br/>
 You want another one?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Declare this.<br/>
 Ephesians three starting verse 12.<br/>
 I don't have to do it by rap.<br/>
 Yeah, you could rap it.<br/>
 Because of Christ and our faith in Him, we can now come boldly and confidently into God's presence.
 When I think of all of this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father, the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth.
 I pray that from His glorious, unlimited resources He will empower you with inner strength through His Spirit.
 Then Christ will make His home and your hearts as you trust in Him.
 Your roots will grow down into God's love and keep you strong.
 And may you have the power to understand as all God's people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep is his love for you.
 May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully,
 then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God.
 I don't know what you're doing on a Monday morning, but that is a great way to start your week.
 For sure.<br/>
 Just a declaration. Take it away, Aji. Declare something.
 He wants me to declare something.<br/>
 Go for it.<br/>
 I should have brought my reading glasses in because now I'm feeling my age.
 Father, I thank you that I can come boldly and confidently into your presence.
 I thank you that your glorious unlimited resources will empower me with inner strength through
 your spirit.<br/>
 I thank you, Jesus, that you are at home in my heart and I can trust in you.
 roots are growing down, God's love is becoming strong in me. And I have the power to understand
 as all God's people should, how wide, how long, how high, how deep your love is for me.
 So just basically like that.<br/>
 I love it.<br/>
 It's fun, isn't it?<br/>
 And because it's in the Bible, you know, someone God's going to want to answer. So you
 You have this super confidence that prayer, the answer to that prayer is on its way and
 you're being recharged and transformed as you make that declaration.
 And you're filling your heart and your spirit with truth.
 It's not, there's no fluff in that, is there?
 Right.<br/>
 I remember when I was a kid, I mean, I don't know how old I would have been, early teens.
 And I remember reading at Jeremiah 33 verse 3, which in the NIV, which is how I remembered
 that was called to me and I'll tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I was like, wait, that's amazing.<br/>
 God's going to, of course, I immediately went to God's going to tell me the answers to the
 exam that I have in high school.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 I haven't prepared for it.<br/>
 Great.<br/>
 Unsearchable things.<br/>
 But I don't think I forgot that because I remember again when I started growing in
 the prophetic or wanting to grow in the prophetic in the early twenties, remembering that verse
 was there.<br/>
 I love how it was written in the New Living translations.
 this ask me and I will tell you remarkable secrets you do not know about things to come.
 So, man, if ever I'm stuck in the prophetic or I need revelation, I just remember Jeremiah
 33 verse 3 and I'm like, "Father, I'm asking that you would tell me remarkable secrets
 that I don't know about things to come."
 Yeah.<br/>
 Boom, I get a download from heaven.<br/>
 I get revelation.<br/>
 I can prophesy over people.<br/>
 I love that.<br/>
 So good.<br/>
 I think too, for some of us when you think about God answering prayer is we're very short-sighted
 in terms of prayers being answered, aren't we?
 What do you mean?<br/>
 Well, I mean, we're sort of like, "Okay, God, would you answer this prayer?
 Today would be good."<br/>
 Or this week would be good.<br/>
 And sometimes the Lord is actually answering our prayers and He's actually answering them
 yes, but He's answering them by moving all the chess pieces for the long-term win.
 for it to be the best yes he could possibly give us. Does that make sense?
 Yeah.<br/>
 So he's moving things and he's orchestrating things. I think sometimes in the midst of that,
 it can look like you're actually taking steps backwards or maybe even look like the Lord is saying
 no. For sure.<br/>
 But sometimes I think he's saying hold because actually greater blessing is coming and he's
 putting things into the right place. I remember, I mean, I'm sitting here today and I'm 44 because
 I've just had my birthday.<br/>
 You are very handsome.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 And I remember, like, I love my job.<br/>
 I absolutely love my job.<br/>
 I love my life.<br/>
 I love the people I work with.<br/>
 I love what we get to do for a living.
 Let's just take one part of what I do for a living, which is teach.
 I love to teach.<br/>
 I love preparing teaching.<br/>
 I love delivering teaching.<br/>
 I love question and answer time.<br/>
 I mean, it gives me tremendous joy to do that for a living.
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah, some 20 years ago when I was confused because I felt like the Lord closed the doors
 on me being a multi-millionaire wonder kid in Silicon Valley, I was asking the Lord,
 "Lord, Lord, what do you want me to do?" And he said, "I want you to be a teacher."
 And I thought he was having a laugh. So about that time I was asking the Lord,
 "Lord, would you use me for your kingdom?" 20 years ago, "Lord, would you use me for your
 Kingdom. And he says, go and be a school teacher. I, you know, I had no foresight to see how
 that could be redeemed and be something good. Right. For me, I mean, I think school teachers
 are great and much needed to know if you're. But it wasn't what you were dreaming about.
 No, but I was dreaming enough at all. Right. But I am the teacher today because I learned
 to be the teacher back then. Right. And so, you know, I don't understand why I was quitting my job.
 I don't understand why I was going back to be a student. I don't understand why I was paying my
 my way through school. I didn't understand why I was taking a huge pick. I didn't understand
 any of this. Right. And God didn't feel obliged to tell me what he was up to fancy that. And
 now, you know, 20 years later, I'm like, Lord, are you kidding me? You're a genius. So I think
 our encouragement is if if if you're listening to this goal, yeah, answer prayer would be
 nice. I've been praying. And it looks like my life is going in the opposite direction.
 Could be like AJ says, the Lord's just moving some furniture to make a better blessed
 make a better blessing in your life.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 What about what about you?<br/>
 I'm thinking presumably when your first marriage collapsed,
 you were praying for your marriage.<br/>
 Like when you look back at what the Lord's done,
 gosh, it sounds like I'm fishing for compliments.
 When you look back at what the Lord's done,
 would you say the upgraded marriage?<br/>
 Aren't you happy?<br/>
 That's not what I mean.<br/>
 I mean, it's kind of what I mean.<br/>
 It's not what I mean.<br/>
 Help.<br/>
 Well, here's the thing.<br/>
 like, yeah, I was praying for my first marriage to be restored, but I wasn't the only person
 involved in that scenario. And he wasn't praying for that. You know what I mean? And so God's not
 going to manipulate him or force him. And then of course, God and his kindness after praying for
 to be restored for three, three and a half years just said, will you trust me to restore this another
 way? And it was literally that was my heart shifted at that moment, like, okay, we're fine. You know,
 like you're going to do something different.
 I'm.<br/>
 Did you have an inkling of what that meant?
 No.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So you weren't thinking of a Scotsman with a body of a great God.
 I wasn't.<br/>
 I had no idea.<br/>
 I would have been so excited in that very moment, but I had no idea.
 And then of course it was eight years before we met.
 So it didn't.<br/>
 Well, you talk about answered prayer.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Eight years later.<br/>
 Did it look like it was being answered?
 No, you're seven.<br/>
 No, it didn't look like it was being answered a couple months before, you know, like, I mean, and then
 And everything about how we met was totally God orchestrated.
 Sure.<br/>
 It was like he just, it was the right time and he just moved all the pieces together and
 ta-da, you know?<br/>
 So I'm not thankful I'm divorced, if that makes sense.
 Sure.<br/>
 I'm totally thankful that I'm married to you.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And to be honest with you, I forget all the time that I was ever married before.
 just I don't feel like I have any residue of that.
</p><ul>
  <li>Amazing.
 What about, I was just thinking earlier today,
 I was thinking about,
 we're speaking to our friends, Richard and Michelle,
 who are pastors at Grace and other early on,
 adult pastors, and we were catching up with them,
 and they have a home group that meets at their house,
 and so we were just asking,
 how's your home group going on, our life group, we call them?
 And they were like, Alan,
 age, it's amazing,
 like you would not believe the number of answered prayers
 that we see. And I was thinking about seasons of my life when I've seen an increase in answer
 prayer, coincidentally enough, that would be seasons of life where I was praying more.
 Yes, and usually praying community. Right. So I was thinking about what practical things
 can we give our listeners to help encourage them in their prayer life and ultimately to see
 their prayers answered? Yeah. Okay. Well, I think my number one thing would be to,
 when you're praying, pray out loud.
 I'm saying this is going to sound like I'm using hyperbole here, but
 praying out loud was the first major revelation I had in my prayer life.
 Yeah.
 Why do you recommend people pray out loud?
 Well, there's a bunch of reasons for one thing.
 If you're praying out loud, you know, when you stopped and when you started
 thinking about what you're having for lunch or what has to be done at work or
 whatever it is that got your attention.
 Right.
 So when you're praying out loud, it's more focused.
 Also, your words have power.
 You're declaring something.
 I mean, I think there's a bunch of reasons why it's good to pray out loud.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 Praying out loud was the big thing for me.
 And it actually marks that you're doing something because sometimes when you pray
 in your head, you're actually praying or thinking about praying.
 Yes.
 So it draws, you know, line of demarcation.
 I would say in addition to praying out loud, start writing your prayers down.
 Yeah.
 Because there's so many prayers that are being answered that you've forgotten
 that you actually asked for and having them written down and reviewing them.
 It's unbelievable.
 We do that with the kids every year, don't we?
 We write down a list of prayers with them and things that they'd like to see the Lord do and whatever.
 And then we review them and they get so excited to review them because we get to check off stuff with them and they get to see, you know, God moving.
 Think about like in our department, we kept a sense terrible.
 We kept it in our to do manager, not because it was to do items for God.
 God, I'm allocating you this task.
 If you have it done by next Wednesday, that'd be great.
 We did this as a department.
 We would keep our prayer requests.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And I mean, we've got them all written down,
 but some amazing prayers on there are answered.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Including one that's happening at the end of this month.
  </li><li>Yay.
 Yes.
 We have a wedding happening at the end of the month
 with it was--
  </li><li>That was afraid about two years ago.
  </li><li>It wasn't on our prayer list.
  </li><li>Come on, I love it.
 So prayer allowed write things down.
 Number three, what would you say?
  </li><li>I think getting in groups to pray,
 like, you know, we've done it as a staff.
 We've done it with our kids.
 people do it in small groups and stuff like that.
 I think there's something really fun about joining your faith together and praying together
 and then seeing breakthrough together.
 But there's also that whole principle about where two or three are gathered there, am
 I in the midst of them, which I love, but also if there's agreement in Scripture teaches
 about there's a strength in agreement in your prayer life as well.
 And we've seen the fruit of that.
 That's kind of where I was getting out with Richard and Michelle and all of their testimony.
 So if you're not in a life group or a home group, I'd encourage you to get in one.
 If you're in a community where your church doesn't have those, find another believer
 that you want to do lunch with and set a weekly appointment, have lunch together, pray together.
 You'd be amazed at what happens.
 I mean, a lot of my own history is me and a friend meeting on Thursday nights just to
 pray and I'm living with the fruit of things we prayed for again, some 20 years earlier.
 So I'd encourage you to do that.
 Finally, I'm thinking about this whole principle.
 Jesus taught us not just to pray, but to ask, seek, and knock.
 And I remember when I was learning to pray, I think I had this whole notion of I've done
 my part, I've prayed, so I don't have to do anything else.
 But there's actually a bunch of prayers that the answer to them depend not solely on God,
 but also on us.
 For example, God, give me a job.
 So we've done the asking, but then the seeking would be like, okay, I'm going to look at
 ads and I'm going to find out what's there.
 The knocking might be actually, you know, applying for a job.
 Going for interviews and, you know, just trusting that God's going to help with this
 end of things that you're partnering with God.
 It's not like a life of passivity where God does everything or right or God, give me a
 wife.
 I'm looking for a wife.
 Well, that's great.
 You look for one when you find one, ask one out, you know, actually ask one like the ones
 that are labeled wife.
 We know what I mean.
 Yes, I understand.
 Sorry.
 Let me see what I'm saying.
 Sometimes the spiritual is remarkably practical.
 I totally agree.
 Why don't we pray for our listeners for an upgrade and an excitement in their prayer
 life?
 All right, Father, I thank you that you love to answer prayer.
 Lord, you love it when we talk to you.
 You love it when we bring you our concerns and our hopes and our dreams and even the things
 we're confused about.
 And so Lord, I ask for every single person who is listening today to this podcast, Lord,
 that you would invade their prayer life.
 God, that you would remind them to pray when they've forgotten that you would start the
 conversation with them.
 And God, that you would show them what a delight you have in hearing from them and in answering
 prayer.
 And Lord, I ask for a supernatural grace upon our prayer life.
 Lord, that you would do something in everybody's lives, Lord, who's listened to this, where
 there would be an ease with prayer, Lord, that the conversational nature of relationship
 with our heavenly Father would be a reality, where we would just have this backwards and
 forwards conversation where we're praying and we're seeing answering and we wouldn't
 forget to thank you for the prayers that you answered, Lord.
 And I ask for the practical needs of everyone who's listening, Lord, for jobs and better
 jobs and raises and bonuses and relational upgrades, Lord, just everything that you would
 do something amazing in the lives of our listeners in Jesus name.
 Amen.
 All right, babe, let's wrap this up and put our kids to bed.
 All right.
 Well, thanks for being with us this week.
 We're actually going to be taking a break for the summer.
 Next week is going to be episode 200, but it's also going to be the last episode of
 keeping up with the Joneses until the fall.
 We love recording the podcast, but this particular summer we are thinking about it's our last
 summer with the kids before one of them goes to middle school and one of them starts school
 full time and we just really want to get as much time with them as we can and focused
 attention for them.
 Sure, usually during the school year, our kids are in bed fairly early on a Sunday night
 with school happening on Monday.
 But with this being off summer vacation and the long summer night, we actually want to
 prioritize being with our family.
 So like I said next week's episode is going to be the last one for a while while we enjoy
 our summer break, but look for us to be back in the fall.
 Well actually look for us next week because you've still got one more week of our dulcet
 tones.
 But until then we pray that you have an incredible week with the Lord.
 God bless you.
