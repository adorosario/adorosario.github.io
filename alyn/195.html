<p> I'm not sorry i said lied i'm gonna bail you're gonna have a nice chat and catch up and i'm gonna go finish my garden yeah speaking of cat.
 We need your weekly catch up.<br/>
 But given we're actually recording this on a Wednesday,
 and typically we'll record our podcast on a Sunday night.
 It's only been two days since we last recorded a podcast.
</p><ul>
  <li>It's true.
  </li><li>So what interesting things have happened in the last two days?
  </li><li>We just worked a bunch of hours and I spoke on Monday night.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Which I think went well, but you know,
 it's hard to tell when you're the one speaking.
 So...
  </li><li>I'm sure you were amazing.
 Nobody threw anything at you.
  </li><li>No, that's true.
 They usually don't though.
 And then i put in my garden now in Britain putting in a garden is very different from america putting in a garden when you say putting in a garden what do you mean i mean vegetable garden so.
 Yes i have planted my plants in deep soil and tested the soil and they are ready to grow now i love that i've done nothing i mean i've done stuff but nothing i would verify that i have gotten further in donkey kong tropical freeze which is a marvelous platform.
 game. If anybody's interested in buying one.
 Well, that's so fantastic, babe.
 Give me a break. It's been two days.
 We had our first night off in a while last night, which was wonderful.
 We did and we watched a movie. Well, I shopped for small trash cans for inside
 of the with ladies bathrooms instead of watching a movie.
 Well, I was sort of half watching and then half looking at Amazon for trash cans.
 The reason we're recording on Wednesday is because this weekend we're going to be
 Atlanta ministering with Arise Life Church. I hope I said that right. So we're not going to be able
 to record a podcast on Sunday. So we thought we could think ahead. So it'll still come out.
 You know, there should be Monday when you're listening to this. Well, I don't know when you
 listen to it. Well, this will be released on Monday as normal, but we're just recording it
 four days early, which is great. But because you have this special guest of Mr. Quinn,
 I get to disappear and finish my garden before we go out of town.
 Right. You were just like, why don't you boys just reminisce and I'll exit.
 And we'll see if maybe you can get a boost on your accent.
 Well, we have completely different accents.
 I don't care. I just need some sort of, you know, some sort of refresher.
 Okay. Even if you end up sounding sort of half Scottish half-Irish, like Quinn,
 you know, you can, yeah.
 Good. Go. Live your dreams.
 I'm going to interview Quinn.
 All right.
 So Mr. Quinn, welcome back to the podcast.
 Thank you so much. It's such an honor to be back again.
 Eagle eared listeners, which that doesn't really work as an example.
 We'll remember you.
 You were on the podcast last year with some of our other students.
 If I'm not mistaken, it is the most listened to episode of all time.
 Shocks.
 It wasn't just me.
 Yeah, it was great.
 We were talking about you on the last episode.
 H&amp;I were doing our weekly catch up and we talked about how you were in time, which is always a thrill.
 And then I started describing and I was like, why am I taking time to describe you?
 Let's just get the man, the myth, the legend on.
 And we can hear straight from the horses mouth, so to speak.
 We've got eagles and we've got horses.
 This is amazing.
 So you and I, I was doing a math, have known each other
 for about 20 years.
 Yeah.
 We met probably either 94 or 95.
 Yeah, something like that.
 Because we were both just young pups.
 We were both young students in Edinburgh.
 Yeah. And the interesting thing, the thing we have in common is we're both,
 Agee mentioned accent earlier, we're both Celtic, but not Scottish, but ended up in Scotland.
 Dude, wait, you're not Scottish? No, my parents are Welsh.
 I know your parents are Welsh, but you're not born in Scotland?
 I was, yes. Does that what makes you Scottish?
 It's complicated, isn't it? But I don't think about Scottish.
 Wait, you were born there, you were brought up there.
 You don't think of yourself as Scottish? You think of yourself as Welsh?
 No, I think of myself as a want to be an American.
 hybrid. Yeah. I don't think I've ever thought of myself as Scottish, even though I've lived
 in Scotland my whole life. But I've never thought of myself as Welsh. That's why I
 had to move to America. That's going to help. Sort of that Celtic identity crisis.
 But you're from Northern Ireland. That's right. Would explain to people who might not
 be familiar the difference between Ireland and Northern Ireland. Oh gosh. How long have
 you gone? Somebody asked me this question in the other day and I'm like, wait. Well, Northern
 Ireland is part of the United Kingdom. Right. It comprises six counties and the rest of
 Ireland is the Republic of Ireland. But geographically, it's on the same floating piece of land.
 That's right. It's the same island. Yeah. Well, that doesn't help. I was going to say
 kind of Scotland and England and Wales are all separate countries, but the share that I have
 space. But that's a useless example because they're all part of the United Kingdom.
 Yes. Yeah. United Kingdom is an incredible anomaly of strange mixed up things.
 I mean, are you familiar with CPG Grey?
 No. He's a YouTuber who is a think American by birth, but lives in England.
 And he does these wonderful YouTube videos with stick figures that explains like the
 difference between London and the city of London and the difference between Great Britain and
 United Kingdom and how Ireland fits. You know, he's very well researched and brilliant.
 I'll put a link in the show notes to I think the video that explains what we're trying to.
 I have seen one of those in Maywell have been him.
 Right.
 It was very funny and...
 And thorough.
 And thorough, yeah. Well informed.
 I think I know the answer to this, but a Northern Irish accent and an Irish accent sound different.
 Well, they're totally different, but they don't sound different to people from outside Ireland
 that much, actually. People can't distinguish or can't seem to distinguish the difference.
 I guess that's the same if you're like a California accent and New York accent and an an accent from Alabama or all different but maybe outside it would just sound like an American accent.
 But historically they don't think they have an accent but people here don't think they have an accent.
 Interesting enough most people think I'm Irish in America when they hear my accent they're like are you from Ireland.
 In fact you know it's not that good in fact to listen to this we you have some friends who are over for the conference yeah who are also from Scotland.
 Their names are Ian and Karen.
 That's right.
 And they were shocked to find out that I was Scottish.
 They thought I was Irish.
 Really?
 Because of my accent.
 And I was like, I would have thought better of you because,
 you know, somebody who doesn't live in that country might be able to make that mistake.
 But apparently I had an Irish accent, which I really don't.
 No, I refuse that strongly.
 I wonder if listeners can tell the difference between my somewhat quasi-Scottish American hybrid
 Canadian accent and your Northern Irish lived in Scotland for 20 plus years, accent.
 I don't know. Let us know. Anyway, the whole point was our friendship started 20 years ago.
 We were both students at university, different schools, but we met at the same church.
 That's right. I was trying to think about how we met because I knew of you before I ever met you.
 You kind of lived off in this distant land socially, at least, at least in my head.
 Okay, and I remember getting to know you and you were you still are no doubt
 But I remember thinking of you as this genius piano player
 And I and I think I used to just come to your house and make you play piano is that true or is that just my imagination?
 That did happen
 You were teaching
 You didn't teach a training at that time and you were doing a placement
 I think at a school which is right beside my flat. You also had vinyl if I remember correctly
 I still have vinyl but graciously I managed to look past that character flaw
 You still have vinyl still have vinyl why why does science so much warmer bro?
 That's an warmer
 No, that's bad. That's bad vinyl on a bad turntable of bad stylus. Okay, right there
 We also if I remember correctly this is basically I'm having you on the show to correct my hazy memory
 Apparently we also had a mutual love of things being done well. Yes, that would be true and pizza Express
 that's still true and
 When we in the same home group for a while.
 Yeah, it was your home group.
 It was I was in it for a while.
 OK, yeah, then I left because I got offended.
 Not kidding.
 It was amazing.
 We did have a home group and then our home group got big, didn't it?
 And so we multiplied, we split and multiplied.
 Is that right?
 That's right.
 Vaguely remembering that.
 And I went with the split.
 It wasn't a split.
 It was a multiplication.
 Right.
 And yeah, that's how things grow.
 And then I jet it off to Canada.
 2003.
 May, A.J.
 Yeah.
 You came out for the wedding.
 Yeah.
 Then we reconnected on Twitter.
 Yeah.
 You came out to Franklin.
 Right.
 And that's that's our history as I remember anything to add anything I forgot.
 Well, yeah, I mean, like in the intervening period while you were in Canada and therefore.
 I think I remember calling you every time I had a computer crisis.
 So I remember one I remember one famous occasion when I a wrist.
 my boss's hard drive. I don't really spectacular computer based fail and you talked me through it
 over the phone. Actually, you might not have been in Canada at the time. I don't know. I can't
 think you would have been in Canada if I was calling you. But anyway, anytime I had some sort of
 computer crisis, you help me out of it. And that was our kind of our point of contact and occasional
 with the sisms via email or something.
 Right. And then I remember you coming over, because Adrian and I got married in Toronto,
 at the church, at the Toronto Air Prokostian Fellowship now, catch the fire in Toronto.
 I can't remember where you were on your spiritual journey, but what did you think about
 Toronto at the time? So just for context sake, Quinn and I grew up in an amazing church. I
 I say grew up, but we spent our 20s and 30s in this amazing church in the church that filled
 with wonderful people who love Jesus, who our main focus would be evangelism.
 I don't think it would be uncharitable to say it wasn't a church that moved in the gift
 of the Holy Spirit.
 Probably the leadership were okay with it, but there was no real manifestation of it.
 That would be fair.
 And then I headed off to what was arguably one of the most controversial carers,
 managed churches in the world.
 Yeah, you did.
 And I can't remember where you were on that spectrum.
 Like now you'll hear when audience you'll hear as we're talking,
 Quinn and I share many of the same beliefs.
 But back then, what were you thinking, especially when you came out to Toronto?
 Was that good, weird, exciting, odd, tell me what it was like.
 It was weird.
 It was weird.
 I mean, well, I mean, the actual reality of it wasn't that weird.
 Like, I mean, I was only in the church itself for your wedding.
 Right.
 And then I think I went the next day for this Sunday morning service.
 And that was, that was weird.
 I remember towards the end of worship, I probably enjoyed the worship because I
 always loved, I guess I always loved worship and I love music.
 And so I suppose that was probably the start of my journey was actually learning,
 enjoying spending time in worship.
 But towards the end of worship, whoever was leading the service or somebody got up and was like machine
 gunning people at the front with the Holy Spirit, that would be Duncan. Okay. And I was a little bit
 offended by that. And then John Arnott spoke, I'm pretty sure John Arnott spoke that day, and he spoke
 on dreams. And so we ended up sort of turning to the person beside us and praying for more dreams.
 And that just seemed like, can you, when you bring the word, brother, you know,
 right, you see so outside your grave for somebody to be preaching on dreams and then to activate,
 well, let's pray for more dreams. Never mind that dreams are all through the Bible.
 You know, that heart escapes you. Right. Yeah. Because it wasn't an expositry,
 verse by verse Bible teaching, which is what I was used to.
 Right. And I thought that was good preaching. It is good preaching, but it's, it can be hard
 part of it. It's not always good preaching. So that was my experience of Toronto. It was
 weird. But on my spiritual journey, at that point, I was at the beginning of, I'd been
 a Christian for 20 years, more than 20 years at that point. But I feel like looking back
 now, I was kind of at the beginning of my spiritual journey because in terms of things
 of the Holy Spirit, I was just beginning to awaken to that, I suppose.
 But that was the very early stages where I wasn't sure whether I trusted it or not.
 Right.
 In fact, I was fairly sure I didn't trust it.
 But still you came.
 I mean, I can think of people who were at the wedding who might have thought themselves
 was open, but they didn't come.
 They didn't go to service.
 Because of that?
 Or they didn't go to service, right?
 Yeah.
 You know, so at least you came.
 At least you experienced something.
 Yeah, I was.
 What you told me I should.
 You should totally come to service tomorrow. You'll love it. I was like, I'm not sure
 you knew me that well. Not for the first time. I thought that. Did you go to prophetic
 ministry? That's something that I didn't know. Well, I didn't. To be honest, I don't
 remember knowing that that was a thing. Okay. I'm looking back. I'm like, wow, I wish I'd
 known that was a thing. I would mind you, that would have freaked me out even more probably.
 Oh, probably. So then fast forward a number of years. You know, Asia and I got married.
 ended up moving to Nashville. We stayed in touch via email and probably social media.
 And then one day, I forget, I tweeted something and you replied to my tweet with a spelling
 correction, which just made me smile because I mean, I like to be grammatically correct,
 but you're pedantic. Well, not pedantic. You're more skilled. I mean, you can't be pedantic
 about something that's either right or wrong. Like there's no pedantry in there. You're
 either correct or incorrect. So I like to be correct, but you spot it out and I just
 thought it was amusing. And for whatever reason, I saw that tweet. Oh, my, I was just like,
 Oh, Quinnie, you know, because we lived on the other side of the world separated by
 six hours of time zone and our lives had moved in in different paths. So when I heard from
 you, you know, you have a very, very dry sense of humor. You're very witty. And so I really
 appreciate that your tweet was taken in no doubt the humor with which it was written.
 And I reached out and I was just like, hey, Quinn, you should come visit.
 And I think we were in our first house in Franklin, is that right?
 And surprisingly, you texted right back and said, are you serious?
 No, I didn't.
 You're remembering that wrong.
 Okay.
 This is why you're here.
 Tell me what happened.
 Yeah.
 I think you said you should come out and visit us.
 And I didn't reply.
 And then you said, I've just spoken to AJ.
 She agrees.
 You got to come or something like that.
 And I think I just let it hang because I was like,
 who are you to tell me what to do with the line?
 (laughs)
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Really, really?
 So you just thought, hey, don't tell me what to do.
 Or I'll pack that really.
  </li><li>Yeah, basically, yeah.
 So I just thought that.
 And I was just pride, really.
 And so I just left it.
 I didn't respond.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then it was, I don't know how long
 that the process took, but I mean, looking back,
 I feel like the Holy Spirit
 just kept bringing that to mind.
 that you'd offered for me to come out and visit you. And eventually my rational mind thought, wait,
 hang on, Nashville, Sunshine, a free place to stay holiday. Why not? Let's give it a shot.
 Where were you in your spiritual journey at that point?
 I was moving along my spiritual journey at that point, so I had moved on to another church,
 which was a bit more oriented in terms of the things of the spirit, which is the church that
 I'm currently at. It'd been a slow burn for me, right, with the Holy Spirit. And I feel
 like he had been working in my heart and my life ever since you went to Toronto, really.
 And so I would, you blogged about stuff and I would read about it and not really believe
 it. But I couldn't reconcile the fact that I trusted you as a person. Yeah. And you
 need to be a man of incredible integrity who heard from God or thought he heard from
 God. But he was, I'd say, you did or didn't. But I could see that there was something in your
 life. And you were experiencing all these things that I wasn't. And so, I mean, that was, I mean,
 I was just afraid of it to begin with. You're afraid of the unknown, you know, didn't know
 whether to trust it. But basically, there's this distrust of skepticism of something new,
 different right away from my experience which had been a long time at that point.
 Well, I think we've also all probably at one point in our life experienced what I call
 musly Christians. You know, the flakes, the nuts, the weirdos. Yeah. And so like I think my parents,
 they were alive through the 1970s charismatic renewal. And so I think just I never really spoke
 them about it, but my assumption is that they probably saw good fruit in bad practice and
 alarmed by the bad practice throughout the baby with the bathwater, so to speak.
 And so, just because I know our history a little, but we probably encountered people who,
 I guess we only have a couple of buckets back then, like, okay, you're a good Christian,
 you're a weird Christian. And it seemed like all the weird Christians had similar experiences,
 and I was probably moving into some of that territory for you. And I'm not putting words in
 your mouth, but maybe you were like, Oh, I know this guy. And I also think I know what he's
 experiencing, but these two shouldn't be adding up. Maybe there's a third bucket. Maybe that's
 not a good description. I'm looking to you for clarification.
 Yeah, I guess that is. I never thought of it in terms of the bucket thing, but you know,
 that's, I think that's pretty accurate description. I just, I couldn't reconcile the fact that,
 you know, I thought that I knew what I did know you.
 I think being part of your home group was significant because I saw you leading that
 and with leading that with integrity and just pursuing the Lord and seeing your heart for
 that, I knew your heart was for Jesus.
 So even if I thought maybe initially I thought you were misguided in it, I knew that your
 heart was good.
 I suppose it's the bottom line.
 And then I saw that you were experiencing all this stuff.
 I didn't know whether to believe it, but I felt like basically the Holy Spirit was just constantly,
 you just kept bringing these things to mind.
 And then I just had to acknowledge that either you were completely faking it, making it up,
 lying, or there was something more out there that I wasn't experiencing.
 And through a culmination of circumstances, including my father's death,
 I took some time off and started to explore other churches
 and just find somewhere where I know I am where people love spending time in the presence of God.
 And I find that a magnetic attraction, I suppose.
 So when I invited you out, clearly you didn't know anything about Grey Centre because you'd never
 been and it wasn't on your radar. So you come out and we haven't seen each other in five years,
 six years. I mean, I'd been over to the UK several times, so it probably wasn't that long.
 Yeah, actually there was a thing, you know, so 2008, yeah, I was when my father died,
 you and AJ were over and you were ministering at my church in Edinburgh. Okay.
 And I, so this was a weird kind of, well, looking back at, wasn't that weird, you know,
 you just think actually the Holy Spirit was like a divine setup. But I had just taken a
 break from my church. I was visiting this church, current church, which is just
 Saint Mungos, and I was enjoying being there because of their appetite for worship, their
 their desire to spend time in the presence of God.
 And their ability to hold the two things,
 the word and the spirit equally well
 in terms of priority and importance,
 which isn't always true of charismatic churches, you know?
 Yeah.
 So it was a good place for me to go to,
 haven't been brought up with the word, you know?
 So I was visiting it and I really hadn't,
 I mean, I'd only visited it for like a couple of Sundays
 or something and then a friend said one Sunday
 after one Sunday evening service,
 hey, you know, Alan's gonna be in time,
 like this Tuesday, I'm like, what?
 I had no idea.
 So, and then I just turned up a new minister
 into our youth, actually.
  </li><li>Really? - In our church,
 Bill and you and Adrienne.
  </li><li>I remember this.
  </li><li>I remember Adrienne speaking on the father heart
 and also lying down on the carpet.
 And I'm thinking this is weird.
 (laughing)
 But at that point, I was just wanting,
 like I just knew there was more
 and I didn't know how to get it.
 I didn't know how to access it, but I wanted it.
 So that was 2008.
 And so I was still at my old church,
 but I visited, I took it.
 to create like three month period or something off.
 I was in charge of the worship team there,
 and I just laid it all aside for a few months,
 just a little mini sabbatical.
 And I basically spent the whole time
 at this other church at Mungo's,
 and really enjoyed it.
 And then I went back to my former church,
 and stayed there for a couple more years before
 finally deciding that actually I needed to move on.
  </li><li>So you arrive in Franklin, while I guess,
 Nashville, if we're gonna be technical.
 And so it's your first time in Nashville.
 Yeah, talk to me about what happens.
  </li><li>Okay, so I arrive, I am jet-lagged, I'm a tree,
 I am as 10 p.m. at night.
  </li><li>Hard time.
  </li><li>Yes, I don't know what time it was for me.
  </li><li>3 a.m.
  </li><li>Yeah, something like that, 4 a.m.
 I get a rental car.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I cannot turn on Google Maps
 because I don't have the data, you know?
 So,
 so I had the instructions printed out the directions
 to your house and I pursued the phone pretty well
 until the final turnoff and then I just got completely lost.
 And I was driving around subdivisions for a while
 and then I find your house
 and eventually find your house got there
 and somebody answered the door, I'm like,
 "A.J., do you look different?"
 'Cause you were a babysitter.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause you were at the conference.
 (laughing)
 And then yeah, then you came back and rescued me.
  </li><li>I talked to him about your first experience
 at Grace Center then, like,
 'Cause that was your first, first time at Grace Center,
 first time at the Moore Conference.
 I think it was Gary speaking at the conference.
  </li><li>It was going Morgan, yeah.
  </li><li>So talk to me about that whole experience.
  </li><li>I loved it.
  </li><li>Which is surprising to both of us question, Mark.
 (Mark laughs)
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, well, I was sufficiently along the journey
 by then that I knew there was more.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I had experienced the prophetic to a certain degree.
 Okay. I didn't know any of the parameters, the boundaries, any of that stuff, but I had
 experienced it and was beginning to sense that it was a real thing, but I hadn't experienced
 it in quite like Gary Morgan was doing in terms of the accuracy of his words and knowledge.
 And do you know what I mean?
 You would, I was sitting in the second row, I think behind you.
 And, you know, Gary would be administering and picking people out and prophesying over
 them. And, you know, he'd be sitting and he'd be moving over and saying, the guy who looks
 like a quarterback, you want to stand up and you would turn him in, go, he is a quarterback.
 I'm like, what?
 I just, you know, I never, ever experienced anything like it before.
 So I was, I was just blown away and everyone was so friendly.
 You know, I couldn't get over that.
 Everyone's welcoming.
 I loved it.
 And then the Clarnie was leading worship, which is never a bad thing.
 Well, there's McClarnie and Corey Asbury.
 So you know, you had different worship leaders and I couldn't, I didn't know he was for
 the conference and he was your guys.
 But yeah, McClarnie was phenomenal. I remember that and I remember
 and I am a kiln clared as she was then and
 So you just got done straight in to
 To grace in her culture. Yeah the worship the presence
 Like again, what was your I don't know we've ever talked about this
 Well, I just I just grinned because I felt like the Holy Spirit set you up with some of the choicest wine
 in the kingdom. Totally. And I'm watching you even back then be really celebrated. And
 at least from my perspective, like people really took to you and loved you and you were
 just a visitor. I don't mean just, I mean, you just landed. Nobody knew you from Adam,
 I guess. But everybody seemed to love you and connect with you. It was like your experience
 or was that just my... Yeah, it was. It was completely my experience and I didn't know
 to do with it because I wasn't used to being honored like that. But I mean, but I put it down to
 mostly the fact that you were introducing me and you were a local celebrity, you know, in terms of
 grace center. And so, you know, I put it down to that. I'm gonna have to call my accountant and
 ask him to change my job title and my tax return to local celebrity now. So, excuse me while I go
 to do that. I think I'm an international celebrity. Yeah, you're confused. So that's awesome. So you
 you had a great time there.
 And then didn't, had we launched the school at that point?
 Or were we?
  </li><li>Yeah, I remember the school thing
 because you played like a promo video for the school.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>First time I saw it, I thought that it was so weird.
 Just the fact that it was called
 the school of supernatural life.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like the word supernatural
 triggered all sorts of whatever.
  </li><li>Fascinating.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I remember thinking there is no way
 I would do something like that.
 Or there's no way,
 There's no way I could do something like that.
 Right.
 Which, and you were like, everyone again, you and I, you would sort of prod me and go,
 Hey, you should come over to the school.
 I'm like, nah, I don't think so.
 So was your like internal cynicism rising with that?
 Like what that talk to you about, you like your, your internal reaction to that.
 So you've touched on that a little bit, but I'm just trying to wonder, was your,
 were your protection mechanisms kicking in?
 Were you intrigued?
 Were you want to do it?
 Or we just wasn't even on your radar.
 You just it was not under my radar when I arrived. I mean, right. I didn't know but I didn't know the school existed. I suppose right
 I guess I knew schools like that existed because you'd gone on dumb one in Toronto sure, but I didn't know
 I had no desire to do it. All right, that seemed far out
 So then spoiler alert you end up doing the school right a what change between
 You know, not knowing about it. No interest in doing it and then I mean you made a massive commitment
 I don't want to steal that story, but what switch between I've got no interest to eventually doing the school
 It all switched within that week that I was in Tennessee that first time.
 So to begin with the first session of the conference,
 watching the video, no way I would do that perhaps.
 Maybe move towards, there's no way I could do that.
 Because, and so to be honest, there was intrigue, there was interest.
 It's just that you were talking about all this stuff like healing the sick, prophecy,
 whatever else was talked about.
 Sure.
 And I'm like, I have no good for that.
 I don't know how to do that.
 Right.
 so I couldn't do the school.
 And then the Lord spoke to me and said,
 that's why they call it a school.
 (laughing)
 Andrew, you know?
 It's 'cause you learn to do those things.
 Right.
 And I'm like, oh, yeah.
 And then so I suppose it just picked my curiosity
 and really by the end of that weekend,
 I'd spent so much time in incredible worship
 and tangible sense of the presence of God
 that I wanted more of that.
 And so the school seemed like a way I could come back and learn about all those crazy things, which I was open to the idea of now.
 Right.
 And what a difference a week makes.
 Oh, goodness.
 Yeah.
 Totally.
 Now, it should be part of that for people who, you know, who people don't know you.
 You were a young working professional.
 Like you had a career, you had a job, you had a house, you had a car, you had a whole life back in Scotland.
 You lived, you know, three and a half thousand miles away prior to coming out.
 you had a full-on life. You weren't just wandering aimlessly looking for purpose. You had a career,
 you had a job, you had a really good job, you were a qualified professional. And now you're
 thinking of, well, in order to come do that, you have to stop being all those things to fly to the
 other side of the world to do a school. Because I know you, you're incredibly responsible,
 very diligent. I don't think it's an insult to say your type A personality. You know, you have
 things ordered. Like, I would imagine that the news that you were going to do that would have
 some head scratching back in the culture you came from, perhaps from family friends. At what
 point did it turn from? I think I want to do this to I'm going to do this and talk to you about that
 journey. Okay. What did you poor mother think? My poor mother met me off the plane and we went
 for breakfast. And I said to her, "Mom, I think I'm going to go back." And she sort of looked at
 me and said, "Yeah, I thought that." Like she knew, I don't know why there was the way I looked
 when I came off the plane or what, but she's a spiritual woman. She's got a close relationship
 with Jesus. Yeah, she does. And so she knows stuff sometimes. Yeah. I think she just knew that I had
 been impacted and that I was going to go back and pursue more. And she never tried to stop me.
 I mean, she's not the hugest, biggest fan of America. But she probably her only flaw.
 But she recognized that I was pursuing more of the Lord. And so I think that actually,
 you know, she was delighted by that. Something had changed in my heart. And so I knew there was
 more I wanted it. And so when I got back, I was dissatisfied with what I had. I think
 it was just what I tested over here made me want to come back and do whatever I needed
 to do to make that happen. So yeah, I mean, I don't remember people being skeptical, to
 be honest. I think it was maybe a little bit from my church family who a little bit, not
 much, but a little bit based on the fact that nobody knew anything about
 Grace Center. I remember speaking to my minister to talk it through and he was
 broadly supportive and he knew you and AJ a little bit.
 Yeah, that's Ranta. Right. So he was he was broadly supportive, but some people
 were, you know, why aren't you good at Bethel kind of thing because Bethel
 everyone knows Bethel. Sure. And I was like, I could go to Bethel, but I'm
 and probably be easier based on the visa scenarios,
 but this was the place where I experienced
 what I want to go back and test.
 You know what I mean?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm more of.
 So that's, yeah.
 I remember most people actually
 being surprisingly supportive.
 I mean, even just from the purely secular,
 like some friends here are not remotely Christian who
 are like, oh, you should totally do that.
 Like supporting the idea of just taking some time out
 and going in.
 So nobody thought you were having a midlife crisis.
 Oh, I thought I was having a midlife crisis.
 because you, not to, not to exaggerate anything.
 You literally sold everything you had to come.
 You left your whole way of life.
 And you, I just, I think it's amazing.
  </li><li>Well, let's qualify that.
 So I didn't give up my job at that point.
 And the interesting question would have been,
 if I'd had to, would I have done,
 and I think I probably would have,
 because I was so committed in my heart.
 But I went to speak to my boss and asked him
 if I could have a 10 month sabbatical.
 And I'd been working there 16 years at that point,
 and he said, yes, which surprised me,
 but amazing.
 Yeah, it was incredibly generous of him.
 And so that helped me because actually,
 I knew that I had a job to come back to you.
 If it turned out to be,
 if you all turn it would be fruit kicks, you know.
 Right.
 I could just come back and carry on where I left off.
 So yes, I'd sold my house.
 So, but, you know, I could carry on with my job at least.
 I had that security in the bank.
 So it wasn't a case of dropping everything,
 but it sort of felt like that.
  </li><li>I think you're downplaying your level of sacrifice.
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>The thing is when you're following the Lord,
 sacrifice is on, you know, it's objectively on paper
 to sacrifice, but it doesn't feel like it
 when you're following the Lord.
  </li><li>It doesn't at all.
  </li><li>And the rewards you get from following the Lord
 far outweigh anything you sacrificed.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
 I get what you're feeling, but my observation was, "Dang, Quinn,
 like, well, you know, way to jump in, because you came out in what may,
 and then you were back in September?" Yeah, that's right. That's a fast...
 It was a quick turnaround. But again, God, you know, that was a little kind of...
 You know, you put things out there to test whether or not it's
 of the Lord, and knowing that He would open doors. I guess, you know, I tasted enough
 or I knew enough about the goodness of God to believe that it was a real thing and that
 he was a good father. I mean, I didn't have a fully formed idea of that really, but I was
 getting there. And so I was like, I think I trust the Lord to open the doors to make this happen,
 if it's right, if it's his will right, which is, so this way I saw things very much at that point.
 So yeah, I mean, I put the house on the market and I had some good friends,
 I came running clean my house for me and just got out of the best friends.
 Oh, they are.
 Yeah.
 And I got it on the market and it sold quickly.
 You know, that was, so that was, I mean, the housing was in a bit of a downturn at that
 point.
 So I was not confident that it would sell quickly.
 And if it had been four years earlier, I could, you know, I knew I could have sold my house
 really fast, right?
 But the housing market in Edinburgh was not an great shape at that point.
 And yeah, it's sold quickly.
 And then your boss, of course, giving you your 10-month leave of absence.
 So things are lining up.
 Yeah, exactly.
 All right, so you get here.
 Yeah.
 You're clearly not skeptical anymore because you've put momentum behind your decision and
 you're here and then you spend eight months in the school.
 It's going to be impossible to describe what that was like.
 But so, you know, tell me whatever pops in your head.
 You're eight months in school.
 What do you remember?
 Oh, gosh.
 I mean, I remember very early on thinking,
 this is the best decision I've ever made in my life.
 Very early on.
 But I was just in a, I just walked into this community.
 There was like 45 of us or something in the school
 like year maybe, 45, 50, something like that.
 And everyone just was so lovely.
 And so there was that, but there was just,
 I mean, it's said often about the school.
 It's like drinking from a fire hydrant,
 just the amount of revelation
 and incredible teaching from yourself and AJ
 and all of his Dean speakers that you bring in.
 It was just all, most of it was new to me,
 all the inner healing stuff,
 the father heart stuff that I'd sort of heard before,
 but there's a difference between hearing a teaching
 father heart and marinating in it for actually for a year to be honest because I mean the father
 heart there's a father heart week where you get six hours of teaching or something on it
 plus soaking and whatever else but I think what struck me looking back on the school is that the
 father heart message and the idea of our identity as sons and daughters not having to strive for
 his attention and him being a very very good father and you know loving us loving loving us well
 loving to bless us, loving being for us, not having to try and convince him of things, but
 you know, being for us, that permeated the school from day one till the end. And the church culture
 was the same. So it was the permeation of through the year of the Father Heart message that really
 touched me, I think. I mean, there was many, many things, but that was the thing that really struck
 me and learning to see myself as a son, not as a servant, a huge, I was big on serving,
 I loved serving, still still loved serving, but it was from a place of trying to please my heavenly
 father and trying to try and I grew up or I accumulated along the way, a belief that my heavenly
 father was always a little bit disappointed in me and I worked from that place constantly.
 So I knew in my head, my theology was pretty excellent, if I do say so myself, that I didn't have to strive to get God's attention, that I couldn't earn his forever forgiveness.
 All of that was a free gift through Jesus.
 But I wasn't living that out.
 You know, at the back of my head, I always are the back of my heart.
 I always felt like he was slightly disappointed in me because I wasn't quite good enough.
 And so I would continually strive to be better.
 And it felt like growing up, that was the message that came through in church, mostly
 was you need to be a little bit better.
 You need to try a little bit harder.
 You're not quite good enough at this.
 You know, you could be better.
 Why aren't you a little bit better?
 And so, yeah, man, that suffocates life out of you, doesn't it?
 It does gradually over a long period of time.
 Oh, yeah.
 And then to have the revelation that God is for you not against you, that you're his favorite,
 you're the apple of his eye, that you know, he's, I mean, it's the revelation of God's love and
 the kindness of God is the best kept secret in the church.
 But I'd heard it preached on, but it's just, I think, but I feel like mostly it was preached on in
 evangelistic services, right?
 So non-Christians, they get a nicer God.
 Oh, they do.
 Yeah.
 once and then once you're over the threshold and you've become a Christian, let's talk about all
 the stuff that you owe him and let's start paying back your debt, okay? Right. But I mean, that's not
 overtly said. No, no, the piosmosis. Right. It's kind of undercurrent. And over here, the teaching,
 your teaching and the teaching in the school and the teaching in the church,
 had a different emphasis. It was like, rather than you should be a little bit better, it was like,
 like here's Jesus, here's the Father, here's what they're like, here's what life with him
 can be like, do you want that?
 You know, it was like presented to you as an option.
 Even when you teach in particular, I've noticed that you use the phrase, I would like to suggest
 that something like that, it's like you're putting out an idea there for people to reject
 or accept and embrace if they want to.
 and remains their choice. Whereas a lot of the teaching and preaching that I'd heard was very much, you need to do this.
 Right. It was declarative rather than invitational.
 Yeah. So you're here, you're part of a church, you're at a school, you have an amazing community of people.
 Yeah. What is your heart feeling about the culture you've left behind? Because that's a big deal.
 you're on the other side of the world, your former life that you've known for 30 and a
 bit years is back there. Are you giving any thought to that? Or are you just 100% focused
 from here? No, I was just, I was just, I was just all here. I was like present here.
 Biscuits, Sweet Teas, Chick-fil-A, it's a promised land. Yeah, I put on an extra 20 pounds. But,
 But yeah, I just forgot about it for a season.
 I don't mean that disrespectfully.
 But I think that that's a great way to do things.
 I've always believed that if you move somewhere,
 even if it's just for a short period of time,
 I always want to be present where I am,
 rather than hankering to be somewhere else.
 And so I am personally quite grateful.
 So when I came over to the school,
 I was the only foreign student barring maybe a Canadian or two.
 I don't know, but basically I was the first person to come across.
 And so in my year, for sure, I was the only Jew and non-American.
 And so that made me a bit of a freak show, a bit of a novel day, I suppose.
 But I was, I love just immersing myself in American culture and not,
 not gathering together with other Brits.
 And because it can be a little, like if I was, if I was to do this with a group of Brits,
 I feel like, you know, we maybe sit down and go, Oh, I didn't, this is what I
 I hate about American culture.
 You don't mean it?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Whereas I didn't have that opportunity.
 I was just with Americans all the time.
 And so I just forgot about it
 and just embraced it as best I could.
 And I loved it.
  </li><li>The joy of running a school, as you know,
 'cause we'll talk about your school in a second.
 But the joy of running a school
 is watching transformation happen,
 watching people get transformed.
 And every year we think and we pray
 and we ask the Holy Spirit who we ask back for next year
 to come and help staff the school.
 So it's a glorious thing because the people who've just been transformed are the most eager to see transformation on the people's lives.
 And so we're praying and of course you were on a radar, not just because we've known you.
 Universally you were loved.
 And to this day, this is why we're kind of joking.
 You mentioned it was a novelty.
 It can't be a novelty six, seven years later, right?
 Because every time you come, you're loved, you're celebrated, which I think is amazing, which is amazing.
 But at the end of the school, we all wanted to keep you, but there was a sense of like,
 oh, you know, that seems unfair.
 Like, hey, Quinn, we know that you put your life on hold.
 We know you've got your career waiting for you when you go back.
 Would you like to come in volunteer?
 You know, we can't pay you and you'd have to sort out all your own housing.
 And, you know, on on paper, it's a really bad deal.
 Would you like to come back and just volunteer for us for free?
 And by the way, you're going to have to figure out how to survive because legally
 And financially, we can't pay you.
 So, and we almost decided not to.
 We just thought that's an imposition.
 That's an unfair thing.
 And then one of our staff was just like, Hey, you pre deciding on Quinn's behalf
 is actually a violation of everything we teach.
 And I thought, yeah, like we actually spent a year training people to be powerful
 to manage their yes and their no.
 And we're like, we are out of the goodness of our heart,
 pre deciding that you can't do something without ever presenting it to you.
 And so we just went to and you said, Quinn, would you consider coming back for another year?
 Talk to us about that because you've already made a sacrifice, but now you've already made
 a sacrifice on your terms.
 Like I would like to go do this.
 This is what's going to cost me.
 Now it feels like you're making another sacrifice based on a request from us.
 At least that's one way of looking at it.
 What was it like for you when we were like, would you come back and be staff on the school?
 Oh, I mean, I was hugely honored.
 I mean, and I mean, there was no question in my heart that I wanted to come back
 because it had been them by far the most transformational eight months of my life.
 Best decision I ever made.
 Still say that and just think your cynicism could have kept you from that.
 I mean, it's a mate.
 I mean, I'm not saying that.
 Well, my enthusiasm had mostly gone by the end, I would say.
 I know, but like when you first came out and you were dismissed as a school video,
 I mean, something in your heart allowed you to be warm to the idea, but you could have
 just tonkered down, be like, Americans, look at this, cares.
 I mean, you could have been heart-hearted and never come.
 And yeah, the Holy Spirit worked on your heart.
 You said, yes, whatever.
 And you'd had this, it just makes me think, what do I miss out on because I prejudge an
 experience because it doesn't fit within my paradigm?
 That's, you know, that's my teaching thing I'm throwing out.
 I'm sorry, I didn't even interrupt you.
 You are like, I'd be hugely privileged.
 That's amazing to hear.
  </li><li>I mean, you know, the school was just,
 the school was just the best experience I ever had.
 So why would I not want to come back again?
 I'm sure there were some practical logistical things
 to overcome, like eating, saying rent.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Riffle from my heart.
  </li><li>He says, I mean, well, I don't know.
 I mean, you asked me, well, you very kindly asked me
 early enough, I think a little me and maybe one or two others,
 just, you were conscious of the fact that I needed
 to make a decision before I went home.
  </li><li>Correct, the cost of you making that decision
 was far larger than a US citizen making that decision,
 just because of the logistics balance.
 So you're right, yeah, we did, we gave you heads up
 'cause we were thinking you need to think and pray
 and you've got stuff, you've got a life to manage back
 in Britain.
  </li><li>Yeah, but bottom line was I wanted to come back
 and so it was just, and it felt to me like I wasn't done yet.
 And so I love the idea of coming back and staying in it, just basically just staying in the culture,
 staying in this place for another year ideally.
 But there were some, obviously there were some practical considerations.
 I had taken 10 months off work, and so I didn't know how that was going to play out.
 Hey, boss, can I have another 10 months off?
 And so I emailed him and he very graciously, you know, to say,
 You know what, I'd really love to come back, but it would really be helpful for me if I could work over the summer for you if you would like that.
 And he courageously replied and said, yes, basically what you're asking, you know, basically you're asking to quit, but keep working and get paid.
 That's fine. Well, yes. I'm going to quit. Would you mind just hiring me for another three months at least?
 And he said, yeah, I'm happy to hire you through the summer at your normal salary.
 amazing. It is amazing. It was very kind and gracious of him. Yeah. He was probably prepared
 for the fact that I wasn't going to come back. So I think probably it helped him actually.
 Me working through the summer and allowed him to maybe put some plans in place for a place.
 Yeah. So I went back and I worked for three months and then came back again.
 So I want to pivot a little bit. So you come back, you do another year. This time of staff,
 we were thrilled to have you. You're a phenomenal leader. It would be our dream to keep you, which
 I'm sure we mention every time you come into the event.
 But then you went back to Scotland, talk about reentry because one of the things that we've
 worked really hard doing is minimizing the bubble effect.
 So for example, one of the things we do at our school is we ask people, our school only
 runs Mondays and Tuesdays so that the idea is the rest of the week, people still have
 a job, they can put into practice what they learned on the Monday and Tuesday in their
 and we try and teach the things that we're teaching in the school to help your life, not just for people who want a job in a church.
 So you're literally not just leaving our culture, our grace in our culture, the school of supernatural life culture,
 you're leaving southern culture, American culture, and you're going back to Britain.
 Talk about reentry and how you found that season.
 Reentry was hard.
 I remember my minister saying down with me when I was talking about coming over here for the first year and he said reentry is really hard.
 I was like, whatever.
 It'll be fine.
 I'm not going to listen to that.
 I came back and reentry was really hard.
 He was right.
 And one of the things is that school stirred up a whole lot of stuff in you.
 I mean, it brings all kinds of things to the surface, which you get to deal with.
 But it also brings up good stuff.
 So it brings up dreams, for example.
 It can bring back dreams that you've maybe put aside because you felt like,
 "God, I just need to follow God's will," whatever that thing is.
 And he's not interested in what I want.
 I need to lay down everything that I want in order to follow him.
 Now, there's a certain truth to that, but at the same time,
 a lot of what I learned was that a lot of what was in my heart,
 I made the dreams that were in my heart were actually ones that he'd put there.
 Maybe not 100% of them, but a lot of them.
 Right.
 And so because that's the way he'd made me.
 So you get that sort of startup and then not always like straight after school to those dreams come to fruition.
 And maybe about that.
 I know.
 Right.
 And logically you look at back and think, of course they don't.
 Right.
 But when you're in that bubble, which it is, and I know you try to minimize it, but it is.
 you can build up your expectations of what your life is going to look like.
 And I think most people think they're going to, well, I don't know this is true.
 I think some people think they're going to be propelled into a life of full-time ministry,
 like as soon as they walk out the door. And that doesn't happen. Or it doesn't happen for everyone.
 For me, what was absolutely amazing was that I came back. And even before I left the states,
 Neil and Joe Thompson, who are now my directors at ESST, the Edinburgh School of Supernatural
 Transformation, they had contacted me and they knew me a little bit from beforehand because
 they went to St. Church, St. Mungos, and they had just started a school ministry. They had
 just finished doing two years at Battle School of Supernatural Ministry, come back and started
 a school attached to St. Mungos called the Edinburgh School of Supernatural Transformation,
 they invited me to come and be a part of that, as part of the leadership team, which was astonishing
 because they didn't really know me. I mean, they kind of knew me, but we didn't really
 know each other. Right. So they knew I'd had an experience. They didn't know anything
 about Chris Center, but Joe had journaled and got my name. And she'd asked the Lord about
 it. And he seemed to give her a thumbs up. And so they invited me on to leadership team.
 So from that summer returning in that summer, I was involved in another supernatural school
 where I got to, I suppose, give away, you know, much of what I had been given.
 Right?
 And that was amazing.
 So let me recap from people who are listening.
 While you're doing school over here in Nashville, there's a couple at the same church that
 you're from, St. Mungos.
 and Joe, they are a Bethel. They do two years at Bethel school out in California. They come back
 to Edinburgh after their experience there. They're like, "Man, we want to start a school."
 Obviously influenced by what they've learned out of Bethel. They want to give it away. So,
 while you're over here, they started a school called the Edinburgh School of Supernatural
 Transformation. And you come back having done a school thinking, "Man, what am I going to do now?"
 An unbeknownst to you, the Lord's put you on their heart. And so you get back and they're like,
 like, hey, we started school and would love you to be a part of it.
 Yeah.
 I mean, did that scratch some of that itch for you of like, I've been
 given a ton of stuff and I want to be able to give it away?
 Yes, it did.
 But to begin with, it was difficult because it didn't look like
 how I thought it would right or should or it didn't look like
 SL right, you know, which it shouldn't of course.
 And but that's, I suppose that that's a hard lesson to learn or
 That was a hard lesson for me to learn.
 When you've been somewhere which looks a certain way,
 like to the School of Supernatural Life, for example,
 which looked a certain way,
 you did certain things in a certain order,
 you prioritized certain things,
 and that school has been so transformational to me,
 then I am naturally gonna expect every school
 to look like that.
 And they had been a Bethel,
 which of course was a bit different to us
 was held to be with, but also, you know, our school runs every second Saturday.
 And therefore, you just don't have the same amount of time to deal with the same sort of subjects.
 That's really good.
 I'm just thinking about Matt Kraushorn, who's one of our pastors at SSL.
 He was talking to me this week and he was talking about how exactly what you're saying that we, we get into a framework where God meets us in a certain way.
 And we think just by the way, we're wired that God needs to keep meeting us in that way,
 or our needs will not be met.
 And he's talking about how the subtlety of idolatry creeps into the church, the way we
 like our worship or the version of the Bible.
 And so you're describing that beautifully, not understanding that God's way more creative
 and different cultures, different times, different seasons need different things.
 So it was amazing that you recognized that.
 How long did it take you to recognize?
 My nose is needlessly out of joint here.
 Long as you'd like to.
 Yes.
 I mean, maybe 18 months.
 Wow.
 No, not quite.
 Let me tell you how it happened, actually.
 So I went through that first year with the SST and I didn't know which way was up
 because their teachings were different to your teachings.
 But actually there's the end result is much the same and that people get
 transformed and they get their identity sorted out as do who they are.
 So at the end of the first year, I was this, I mean, recognizing the fact that this was good,
 this was a good thing, and I was really happy to be part of it. But I was still struggling with
 the fact that it didn't look the way I thought it should, you know. And then in the fall of that
 year, I came back here for a conference and I sat in the class of year two, just for the morning
 session, and you were teaching on spiritual fathers and mothers, I think was a sort of overriding topic.
 But in that you made a point of reinforcing something that I'd already heard you say
 during the school. I feel like it anyway, but of the importance of surrendering your own vision
 and submitting to the vision of your leaders in the season of life that you're in, whoever those
 leaders are. And I was convicted. I was sitting there going, "Oh my goodness, that's what I'm not
 doing. It was such a, it was, it was a hard lesson to hear. I remember sitting and talking
 to you and AJ and sharing that and AJ going, hey, Quinn, when you have your own school,
 it can look like S.O.S.L. if you wanted to, but if you're in Neil and Joe's school,
 it's going to look like how they want it to look. I'm like, oh, yeah, it was, it's a really obvious
 lessons. But you know, it's the difference between learning these things into your
 kind, so it's certain lesson, listen to you talking about the importance of
 submitting the vision of your leaders and going, yes, that's right. Right. And then
 the difference between that and the theory of it and the practice of it is
 quite quite something. Yeah. And as I was saying to you, you know, it's easy to
 submit to the vision of your leaders if you are 100% in alignment with the way
 they're doing everything. Right. And when you're when you don't think they're
 doing it quite right, then that's harder.
 Right.
 Now they were, I cannot say they were not doing everything right.
 It's just that they weren't doing it the way I expected them to.
 So I went back and confess that to them.
 And we didn't start afresh, but it was like a it was a new chapter.
 Right.
 They had already given me a lot of favor in the school.
 You know, I was, they'd already asked me to teach on one or two things.
 And, and that increase as time went by and it has become
 I've learned that submitting to their vision has been a gloriously, it brings a lot of
 freedom, right?
 I think that's amazing.
 So that's, you know what you're saying before, it's easy to submit to your leader's vision
 when it's what you want.
 There's actually no submission in that part.
 That's called getting to do what you want to do anyway.
 Submission only happens when their will contradicts your will.
 Yeah.
 That's a really great lesson to learn, but it's not one that you learn in the classroom.
 No.
 I love that there's ESST. I'm from Edinburgh. I had to go to Toronto because I wasn't anything
 like that. You had to come to Nashville because there wasn't anything like that. Talk to me
 about ESST. So anybody who's in Scotland, anybody who's in Edinburgh, or I guess further
 afield, talk to me. When does that school start and what does it look like and how does
 it run?
 It starts in September and it finishes in May.
 So when I go back to Scotland, we will be graduating our students from this year.
 Wonderful.
 It runs every second Saturday, basically.
 So two Saturdays a month.
 And then one Wednesday night a month.
 Great.
 And so do you have people from just Edinburgh or do you have people from Futhera Field?
 Yeah, we have people from Edinburgh.
 We've had people from the border, from Fife, from Glasgow, from Aberdeen, coming down to
 the school.
 And this year, we have someone coming up from England, from Essex, who's relocating to
 Edinburgh to do the school.
 I love that.
 I know.
 That's the same hunger that's prompted you to move from one country to another.
 Right.
 So I think I'm a greatest joy with ESST is just seeing, I mean, it's the same as you
 guys.
 You've seen the transformation in students' lives, from the beginning to the end, you
 know, and reading in particular, second year applications come in and they talk about what's
 happened for them in first year.
 or they're sharing a testimony that will happen to them through the year.
 And you read it or you hear it and you know, something in your heart goes, "Oh, that's
 why I do this.
 That's why I do what I do.
 That's why I get up.
 I get up and leave the house at 7.30 on a Saturday morning on my day off, you know,
 to come and spend all day there and work hard and teach and do sound and do all the little
 things.
 It thrills my heart to see people beginning to understand the goodness of their Heavenly
 Father.
 It's beautiful, isn't it?
 It's just the best job in the world.
 It is the best.
 Yeah.
 I'll put a link in the show notes for anybody who's listening who would like more information
 about ESST.
 I'll put a link to your website.
 Since you've gone back and you live in Scotland, I can't help but notice that it seems like
 you've come back every year for a refresher.
 Is that completely true?
 Sometimes twice a year.
 Sometimes twice a year.
 I came back twice in the first year,
 but yeah, usually once a year.
  </li><li>And talk to him about stepping back
 into grace in our culture.
 What's that like?
 'Cause you bring people with you.
 That's what I love.
 This is how the kingdom works.
 You remember the woman at the well,
 and the Lord ministers to her,
 and then she goes to the village,
 her village and says,
 "Come see a man who told me everything I ever did."
 And many people come back.
 And so I've noticed that about you,
 that you've come here being changed, gone back.
 People have noticed, kind of like I went away,
 you noticed the change in me and you came
 and found out what happened.
 And now I'm noticing the same thing happened with you.
 Like this year you brought four other people
 all the way from Scotland.
 I mean, I don't think you brought them, they wanted to come.
 But talk to you about your yearly pilgrimage,
 so to speak to Grayson or what's that about?
  </li><li>Well, on one hand it's purely selfish.
 (laughs)
 You can't get Chick-fil-A in Scotland.
 bright, you can't get Chick-fil-A and Honey Rose, the barbecue sauce.
 So I love coming back.
 I mean, this is a place where I experienced the greatest transformation in my life.
 And I had the most wonderful two years.
 So coming back here is not a sacrifice.
 I'd love to come back.
 And so when I come back and step into Grace Interculture, it just feels like coming home.
 You know, it's my second home.
 I just walk straight back in.
 People still know me.
 I'm still welcome me.
 And so it's just...
 You really are loved and celebrate here.
 I love it.
 Don't completely get it, but...
 I think it's amazing.
 It is amazing.
 It's astonishing.
 But it's great.
 You know, it's hugely honoring.
 It's a great place for me to come and just get my love tank refilled
 and my spiritual tank refilled.
 You know, I work full time for the church now,
 and so I'm pretty much on all the time.
 All the time. Well, every Sunday.
 And so I don't get to just sit back or stand in worship and just worship and rest and that
 has no responsibility.
 No, there's always responsibility.
 So yeah, so I love to come here and just soak up the presence of God and worship in particular.
 And I love it.
 Well, we love when you come, Quinn.
 In terms of like bringing other people, I had some prophetic words when I left in 2014 about
 about a bridge, about being a bridge, but bringing people across a bridge.
 I don't know.
 I can't remember them exactly, but I knew there was a bridge involved between
 Edinburgh and Nashville.
 And I haven't.
 So I initially, early on, I brought a couple of friends over and they've kept
 coming back.
 But just this recently, this last few months, I felt like the Lord was
 putting it on my heart to extend that a bit more.
 And this part of me doesn't want to because it's part of me, you know, this is my, my
 place, you know, that like, for me, it's like a place where I can go.
 I was going to say not be known, but actually there's so many people here
 know me, but you know what I mean?
 It's just a place where I can go away from home, right?
 Be myself, be whoever, you know, just so that's lovely.
 So in some ways, it'd be nice and tempting to keep it to myself.
 But but it was part of me was like, you know what, the Lord, I think, was
 speaking to me and just saying you're sitting on an incredible gold mine.
 Like, yeah, this is a great place.
 And there's a lot of people you know who could benefit from coming here.
 Now they don't have to.
 And maybe in me, I'm not, I'm not a hugely high influencer.
 So I'm not going to belay anyone in the coming over.
 But when I, um, so I just felt like the Lord was encouraging me to open it up as
 an option for more people to come.
 So another couple come over this year, which is exciting.
 And it's just a thrill for me to see other people come over and experience the
 same place, same love, the same presence of God, the same experience that I had really.
 And yeah, I love it. I love it.
 As we close, my thought to you is what encouragement would you give
 to somebody who's listening to this? And they're wanting more, they don't know how to get it.
 And perhaps our path to getting more isn't a school. But whatever it is, where they're feeling
 like there's a burning bush that they're going to go over and see what this is.
 You know that whole thing, like you saw video and you're like, "I wonder what that is."
 What encouragement do you get to people who are feeling like over there there's an echo
 of something more?
 What's your encouragement to them?
 I think my encouragement to them would be to push out the doors and just if you go after
 it and you go after it with your heart, then he will reward you and he loves to feed the
 hungry and those who are hungry for him will get more of him. You know, seek me, you know,
 find me if you seek me with all your heart, he says. And so I would say, don't let your
 skepticism prevent you from looking for more. And the sort of watchword that I worked by
 when I moved over here was to, I mean, I trusted you guys because I knew you a bit,
 but I made a conscious decision to just to err on the side of belief.
  </li><li>Whoa, that's a great line. I'm tweeting that later.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Oh, my whole life, I err on the side of caution.
  </li><li>Oh, quin.
  </li><li>Mistrust and cynicism, you know, because I was afraid of getting it wrong.
 Like, you're on testimony, you're kind of afraid of being deceived.
 Yeah. And then I decided, you know what, if I trust him, I have not if I really is good,
 or I have even the suspicion that he is good, I am going to just try this because I've tried
 the other way my whole life and it hasn't really got me where I wanted to or I'm not
 experiencing life in all its fullness.
 Oh, Quinn.
 And so...
 Preach it.
 I decided to err in the side of belief rather than unbelief of faith rather than doubt.
 that. And when your father sees that, he just loves to open his hand and bless you with the good
 things that he has for you. What a treasure. That is an amazing piece of revelation. I'm going to
 give you credit for twice, and then I'm just going to start proclaiming as my own.
 Quinn, it's been a joy not just to have you on the podcast and hear some of your story and
 hear a lot of the story from your perspective, because I was just, you know, had a good sense,
 but it's lovely hearing from your perspective. But also I haven't known you for 20 years.
 I love that. I've got friendships that go back 20 years and we've got shared experiences,
 not just in America, but in Scotland and both of our journeys with the Lord.
 During the time we went to the Derek Prince conference and I screamed my head out.
 Yeah, remember it very well.
 But we've got this amazing rich history to draw from and every time we come back to America,
 We, we, me and AJ, but also our whole community.
 Love seeing you.
 And again, thank you for giving up some of your afternoon to just come
 and wax lyrical and take a walk down memory lane with me.
 And I hope everybody who's listened has been super encouraged by this.
 I'll put a link to all of Quinn's social media information on the Schunerts.
 So if you want to get connected with Quinn on Twitter, if you want him to
 correct your spelling, he'd only be too happy to do that.
 It's a reflex for him.
 And but thank you again, Quinn, for being here.
 We love you.
 Thank you so much.
 It's been a huge honor.
 Thank you.
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games.
 Pale you donuts in the kindness of God.
 The things we deal with every day.
 From Franklin, Tennessee.
 They are just like you and me.
 Allen, an A.J.
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
