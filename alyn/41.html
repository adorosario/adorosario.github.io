<p> AJ Jones, how are you?<br/>
 I'm fine. Thank you. How are you?<br/>
 I'm very good. Thank you. Beautiful new pajamas.
 Why thank you. So do you.<br/>
 Thank you. We've had an amazing week. We have.
 You know what I realized was we started last week with a profit.
 We did. And we start next week with a profit.
 Very true. Our life is sandwiched between two profits.
 There you go. So with David Wagner at the school and I emanate last week.
 Which was amazing. Amazing. So good.<br/>
 And we have James Gull with us tomorrow at the school.
 Can you believe we had another snow day this week?
 No, what was that Thursday?<br/>
 I think we've got what like an inch of snow and an inch and a half of snow or
 something on Wednesday night, shuts down the city.
 Right.<br/>
 Are terrified of that white stuff.<br/>
 Yeah, but we don't have any infrastructure to clean up.
 Well, I know, but it was melted by 10.
 I mean, it was fully melted.<br/>
 The.<br/>
 Nobody knows that the night before when they have to make the judgment.
 Well, we experienced the same.<br/>
 When we're trying to cancel church, you have to be wise and I could go one or two different ways.
 Yeah.<br/>
 You were away this weekend. That's probably the most interesting thing that happened this week.
 I was.<br/>
 You went to the women's conference?<br/>
 I did. I did a women's conference up in Owensboro, Kentucky.
 How is Kentucky different from Tennessee?
 Seems flatter.<br/>
 But I mean, I only saw a small portion of Kentucky. It's not like I've seen the whole state.
 But it was nice. We stayed in a nice hotel and I looked over the river and I saw my very
 first river barge.<br/>
 What's a river barge?<br/>
 Well, I'm assuming it's a river barge. It's like this massive long boat that's like the
 equivalent of a train that would carry cargo, but it's on the river. And it's really long
 and skinny and it just moves really slowly.
 I'm sorry.<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 I'm not saying I stared for long.<br/>
 I was just like, Oh, long skinny boat.
 Tell me that's a barge.<br/>
 Tell me.<br/>
 Tell me your highlight of this week.<br/>
 My highlight of the week.<br/>
 Possibly dinner tonight.<br/>
 Mmm, that's amazing dinner.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 We at Corcon Cab in downtown Franklin.
 We did.<br/>
 Was really good.<br/>
 Was great friends.<br/>
 It was fantastic.<br/>
 That was your highlight.<br/>
 Well, I don't know.<br/>
 I have a couple highlights.<br/>
 I mean, Shannon came with me on the weekend.
 It was really fun to get time with Shannon and we tend to find the same things funny.
 So we had a lot of fun just driving together and all that kind of stuff.
 And then Alberto and Kimberly were at the conference as well.
 So it was great to get time with him.<br/>
 They were amazing.<br/>
 And then Lyle's parents hosted it.<br/>
 So they're scream Jeff most their scream. They're amazing and I didn't really know them before I really I've like fallen in love with
 Them in a day. So it was really good. You had a week of highs then I had a great week. Yeah
 It was really good and somewhere in there. I had a cronut -
 Tuesday morning is that when we had cronuts cron never bad thing no so good five daughters bakery
 It's like crack though really.<br/>
 Well chocolate flavor crack.<br/>
 Yes, but now I think about it every day.
 Cro-nut.<br/>
 What was your highlight of the week babe?
 I don't know if I had a highlight.<br/>
 So much as I had a great week.<br/>
 What's good?<br/>
 Seems like you had fun with the kids.<br/>
 You had a date morning and a date afternoon.
 We got matching tattoos. That was nice.
 It's just beautiful.<br/>
 Am Just a beautiful.<br/>
 Am just a nice one as I thought he would.
 Which is nice.<br/>
 because it's on his face.<br/>
 It's a spider web, a brilliant, just beautiful.
 He's ready for prison.<br/>
 I'm enjoying MJ's fascination with playtime.
 He's really come alive.<br/>
 Like you can do distract him from anything just by saying play with trucks.
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 And then you let him out onto the main road and he just goes for it.
 He's doing full sentences now.<br/>
 So he'll let come over and go, "Daddy, me, you play tracks."
 You know, like he's stringing things together, which is amazing.
 Most of the sentences that he says revolves around him
 hating his sisters, though.<br/>
 I hit Tia.<br/>
 I hit Tia.<br/>
 Abby hit me.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Now that we're particularly violent, household, you understand.
 When you're two and you have two noisy sisters, it seems like you make your way
 in the world by hitting.<br/>
 Yes, or shoving or poking.<br/>
 But he always confesses and then sometimes he just goes and sits on the naughty step by himself.
 Yeah, he gets that self control from his dad.
 Okay.<br/>
 He gets the hinting from his mother.<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 Our topic for this week is the topic that you were ministering on this weekend.
 Yeah, it was a spiritual warfare conference.
 And I had a bunch of revelations about me or us and how we don't really experience much spiritual warfare.
 So I think I was going into the conference going, Oh, dear, they've asked the wrong person to come and talk about this.
 So what did you share them?<br/>
 Well, I talked about the two main things I basically talked about were, you know, your expectations really determine your reality, you know, according to your faith be it unto you.
 So if you're aligning your expectations with spiritual warfare and, you know, greater levels,
 greater devils and, you know, the counter attack and all that kind of stuff, then I'm sure you
 experience it because that's what you've aligned your faith with. I don't have faith for the enemy
 to be able to do much of anything with me. And so I don't experience that. Does that make sense?
 And my second point that I made was when I was driving a couple days before the conference,
 to learn to me, I want to remove the house that hurt built.
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, that's a great line.
  </li><li>Right, and I was like, oh yeah.
 And really realizing, I think a lot of the things
 that people would say are demonic attack,
 I would say are inner healing issues
 that are, you know, there's places in our lives
 that are still unhealed, where we're either afraid
 to deal with it or we don't realize it can be dealt with
 or can be removed.
 And so there's landing strips for the enemy
 to actually mess with us in a certain area
 because there's healing that's needed.
 And actually, if you can rip up the landing strip,
 the enemy actually has no legal rights
 to mess with you at all.
  </li><li>Right, so if you're harboring unforgiveness, for example,
 then the enemy's empowered to mess with you
 in the area of that heart.
  </li><li>Right, or if you're, you know, sinning and you know it,
 or you know, like, so, yeah.
 So we looked at stuff like worry and unforgiveness
 and bitterness, that kind of stuff.
 like unresolved wounds, essentially.
  </li><li>I think the most incredible thing on this topic
 that I ever heard was from John and Carol.
 And I remember speaking to them
 because we'd go off and we'd do lots of conferences
 around the world and we never seemed
 to get any counter attack,
 which was amassing with my theology.
 Because my prior theology, my prior experience was,
 if you do anything good for God,
 going to be attacked really, really badly. And so I remember asking John about that one day,
 and he took me to Matthew 28 and he said, you know, read that verse and says, you know,
 all authorities been given to Jesus speaking, saying all authorities in heaven on earth had
 been given to me. And so I read that out and John said, well, if Jesus has all authority,
 how much does that leave for the devil? So I very quickly did the math and realized if Jesus had
 all the authority, then the devil had none. So I said to John, none. And John said, no,
 The devil only has a much authorities choose to give him.
 And his point was, as Bill Johnson eloquently puts it, the devil is empowered by human agreement.
 So if you choose to trespass or traffic in his area, then you will reap sin.
 If you choose to sow sin, then you'll reap sin.
 But if you choose to keep your life free from sin and you choose to live in an area of grace and forgiveness,
 then there's precious little that the devil does.
 Remember John saying, Alan, if what you're saying is true about counter-attack,
 then. Surely Carol and I, having led an international revival for years and years and years,
 should have experienced something. Right. But the most we experienced, if we maybe get cold,
 or we lose our luggage once in a while, which incidentally, I never saw them lose their luggage
 ever. Right. But you know, John had literally removed any expectation for the devil to operate
 in his life, which was amazing. Yeah. But it messed with me. Yeah, for sure. I remember once
 hearing a speaker near the beginning of the renewal talking about the difference between
 charismatic and charismatic maniacs.
 He was talking about the whole thing, looking for a devil under every rock.
 He said, "These are the people that don't change their oil or don't put gas in their
 car and then when they run out of gas or their engine sees us because of oil, they say the
 devil attacked their car."
 He says, "Well, the spirit did attack your car.
 It's probably the spirit is stupid, though."
 I remember just going, oh yeah, it wouldn't occur to me.
 I guess the thing is I don't want to give the enemy any publicity.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah.
 I don't want to give credit for anything.
 And it doesn't occur to me to offer it.
 Right.
 Well, it's like that verse that does say, and people will often quote this, you know,
 alert the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking to devour who he can, basically
 I just paraphrased that terribly but it's late at night and I'm tired.
 Well that verse is one of the verses that I talked about at the conference really briefly
 just because I remember my friend Jenny, she grew up in Ethiopia so she grew up like
 you know as a missionary's kid around lions and she said AJ roaring lions are not the
 ones you have to worry about.
 If they're roaring they're usually roaring because they're old and they're trying to
 scare off other animals or other lions by their sound because they actually can't defend themselves.
 It's the quiet, stealthy lions you have to worry about. And I was always like, oh, that's so interesting,
 you know? And then besides that, of course, we know a bigger lion. But...
 Well, that was John's great lion. You know, you need a bigger god and a smaller devil.
 Yeah.
 And his point was that most Christians have more faith in the devil to deceive them
 then they do in God to keep them from deception. The other verse I think about where Paul writes
 to Christians and says, "Do not give the devil a foothold." The Greek word there for "foothold"
 is "topos," which literally means a license or permission to operate. We often use examples of
 how we're going to open a taco stand in Franklin. I need a license from the city of Franklin to say,
 I have permission to operate a food services car. And Paul's basically saying, just don't give the devil permission or a license or an opportunity to have access to your life.
 And then goes on and says, you know, therefore get rid of all business, rage, anger, mouth, slander, that sort of stuff.
 And it is amazing how we often want to keep on to our bitterness, our judgments without realizing the access we're giving the enemy through that.
 Even the whole, you know, again, a couple days before the conference, I was thinking
 about the, you know, Ephesians 6 with the armor of God.
 And you know, you're girding your loins with truth and you've got a breastplate of righteousness
 and, you know, the helmet of salvation and gospel of peace.
 And I was like, huh, okay, so your loins are girded with truth, which really speaks to
 me of also of purity and that sort of thing.
 Okay, so you're standing in righteousness, you're standing in right, standing with God,
 you're standing in your salvation, you understand who you are and who he is.
 And then your feet are shod with peace.
 And then it doesn't say, after all of that, talking about the what you're wearing, it
 doesn't say now go and fight, it says stand firm.
 It doesn't say attack, it says stand firm.
 So really, uh, warring if warring is done should be from a position of rest and from
 knowing who he is.
 Do you know what I mean?
 And, and, yeah.
 So I think it's interesting we look at the life of Jesus.
 Jesus wasn't preoccupied with what the devil was doing.
 No.
 He wasn't intimidated to preach the sermon on the mountain.
 He just had a perspective of what is his heavenly father doing.
 I remember once traveling with John and we landed in a city in the United States and
 we got picked up by one of my heroes and we got in the car with him and I'd read this
 guy's books and I was interested to spend the weekend with him.
 And as we're driving to the hotel, this guy just starts telling John about how bad the
 territorial spirits are on this area and how they're told under attack and how to yadda,
 yadda, yadda.
 And I'm sitting thinking, "Ah, I don't have a grid for this."
 And so we get to the hotel and we're unpacking.
 I said, "John, I said, 'I don't want to be critical.'
 I said, 'But I'm confused as to this guy's like a hero of mine.
 I've read his books.'
 And yet he seems really, really scared about the devil.
 And can you hand me with that?
 And so John said, " Alan, have you got a Bible there?"
 So I do.
 He said, "Just open it anywhere in the Psalms."
 So I happened to open it.
 I think I opened it as Psalm and I want to start reading from it.
 And he said, "Okay, try again.
 I turned a couple of pages, read from another Psalm."
 And of course, they're all about David's absolute trust and confidence in God to rescue him.
 And he said, Alan, when you don't have a revelation of the father's love, you're actually left
 alone to fight all your battles.
 When you have a revelation that you have a good heavenly father, that he won't give
 you a serpent, that he won't give you a snake, then you actually have a revelation that
 God is looking out for you.
 And I never forgot that.
 I just, you know, it's interesting if you think about when David, when to see his brothers
 and Goliath was intimidating them, their eyes were all fixed on the giant in the land.
 And yet David was accused of being arrogant, but he was just so confident in God's ability to rescue him that he paid no attention to the giant.
 Yeah, the giant seems small.
 So in essence, what would you sum up our approach or encouragement to people who want to understand a spiritual warfare?
 I would say probably push into God for your healing, like, you know, for remove all the landing strips.
 As the Lord to align your expectations with the goodness of God, how much you're loved,
 how much he actually cares about the details of your life and how awesome he is.
 And I think that realigns your perspective of what spiritual warfare is.
 I forget who said it, but I remember hearing somebody in Toronto say,
 the greatest form of spiritual warfare is the kind that magnifies the greatness of God.
 And I love that. So yeah, keep your eyes fixed on Jesus.
 get your heart healed up, have no faith in the devil.
 Yeah.
 God's huge.
 It's absolutely enormous.
 He's a great dad.
 Do you know who's killing it at the moment?
 Who?
 Jesse Parker.
 Yes, she is.
 Jesse Parker early.
 Or Jesse early.
 Jesse early.
 She just did an incredible job this morning.
 Oh, amazing.
 Yeah.
 I love that "Health or Song" that we were seeing.
 Jonathan David and Melissa "Health or Song."
 Yeah.
 Endless Ocean.
 If you were looking for some new music, the song is so incredible.
 I'll be singing it all day.
 Yeah.
 It's really good.
 All right.
 Any closing thoughts?
 No.
 Thanks to the dramatic boss.
 I'm like, do I have any thoughts?
 I'm thinking pillow.
 Pillow.
