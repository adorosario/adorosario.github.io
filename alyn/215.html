<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 215 of Keeping Up with the Joneses.
 This podcast is brought to you
 by the generous support of our patrons.
 This week we wanna thank Karen
 for making this episode a reality.
  </li><li>Thanks, Karen.
  </li><li>Hope you enjoy it.
 AJ Jones.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Tell me about your week.
  </li><li>It was a good week.
  </li><li>You stood up smoking apparently.
  </li><li>Yeah, or I'm like trying to impersonate a frog
 or something.
  </li><li>What happened, baby?
  </li><li>I know, I just been coughing today,
 and my voice is gone.
  </li><li>And little Abigail are 11 year old with sick all week.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I came back from the beach to an 11 year old.
 Well, she's still a baby in my head.
 I was gonna say to my baby, being sick with a fever
 of 102.5 for what, like four days?
  </li><li>Five days, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Should find Friday.
  </li><li>For baby.
  </li><li>Yeah, I hope you're not getting sick.
  </li><li>I hope I'm not too.
  </li><li>I ain't kissing you if you are.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Tell me about your week.
 You were in Florida.
 Hey, how was Florida?
  </li><li>I was really good.
  </li><li>Yeah, being at the beach.
  </li><li>It was nice.
 It was so nice.
 We, it was like 60 degree weather,
 so it wasn't like killer hot,
 but we sat on the beach and grounded
 put our feet in the sand.
 All that hippy stuff.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And just got to chill and, you know,
 spend time with friends and have fun.
  </li><li>I missed you.
  </li><li>Thanks.
 That's new, right?
  </li><li>Totally new, which fits with our topic,
 which we'll get to in a second.
 Give me the run down in the week.
 This week you were teaching verse by verse through Romans.
  </li><li>Through Romans, I love Romans.
 So we've done Romans one through to the middle
 of Romans eight.
 And we're taking a break for this week because we--
  </li><li>I have a question, is that your stomach egg in here?
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>I don't know if podcast listeners, you can hear that,
 but it's either a high pitch wine or a deep rumble.
  </li><li>Yeah, it does both.
 Yeah, just did it again.
 (laughs)
 Hello in there.
 I don't know.
  </li><li>Whatever one's out, keep it.
  </li><li>Do make me laugh.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Oh, baby.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Good job, you're not in a really, really cold basement
 recording this.
  </li><li>Good job, I'm not having to speak today
 or tomorrow a couple times, yeah.
  </li><li>That's been why I'm excited.
  </li><li>Why are you excited?
 because after a nonstop day after day,
 I get two days off tomorrow.
  </li><li>You do.
  </li><li>I'm taking days off.
  </li><li>I'm just chilling.
  </li><li>I'm just gonna.
  </li><li>Chilling like a villain.
  </li><li>Monday I taught on angels, demons.
  </li><li>And other stuff.
  </li><li>Spiritual warfare and heavenly places.
 It's one of the weird weeks of the school supernatural life.
 Like we had visitors that week and I was like,
 "Guys, I'm not sure this is the best week
 "to have people just come in cold
 "and listen to all that stuff."
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I did a refresher with both years on giving a two-minute testimony, how to do deliverance,
 and what was the other thing I taught them how to do?
 I can't remember.
 Oh, how to lead somebody to the Lord, you know, like what do you need to say and what
 do you get them to say and all that kind of stuff.
 So it was fun.
 Oh, my watch has just reminded me, time to start heading to bed.
 Not likely.
 It's so late and you still have to edit this podcast.
 Thursday, Friday, Saturday, we were at a training event,
 which was equal parts so difficult.
 And equal parts absolutely wonderful.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we'll get to that in a second.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Finished that Saturday, our friends Ben and Sarah,
 and their three gorgeous little girls
 arrived from Toronto for the week.
  </li><li>It's so cute.
  </li><li>And then Sunday I taught this morning on.
  </li><li>Finance is.
  </li><li>Finance is a financial blessing.
 And then we had all the small group leaders back for lunch.
  </li><li>Yes, and then you had an app.
  </li><li>Oh, that was, things are awesome.
  </li><li>When it got groceries.
  </li><li>I had an experience last night.
 That is one of those things where I couldn't sleep
 because there was a blue light everywhere I looked
 and I was like, "Holy spirit, is that you?"
 And then I realized, "No, it's my Apple watch
 on the charger, which I never charged up."
 I usually sleep with my Apple watch.
 And I was asleep.
 (laughing)
 And I had this thing called night hold
 and I was just glowing blue.
 And I was like, "Holy spirit, is that you?"
 No, I'm an idiot.
 Okay, this is my app.
  </li><li>That's so funny.
  </li><li>All right, our main topic for this week.
  </li><li>Our main topic is feelings.
  </li><li>Okay, I want you to lead this one
 'cause this was your suggestion this week.
 So tell me, how do we end up talking about feelings?
  </li><li>So we've been attending this Sage Hill training seminar.
  </li><li>So explain who Sage Hill is.
  </li><li>So Sage Hill is, it's a,
 what'd you call it, a counseling house.
 It's a, you know, they offer counseling and grief counseling
 and all kinds of different counseling.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's a company that helps people,
 what's their tagline, help people be who they are
 so they can do what they're made to do.
  </li><li>Something like that, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>But yeah, they have counseling centers,
 they do training, they have books, they have resources,
 they have something called the Center for Professional
 Excellence, which is helping people who are professionals,
 but stuck in addiction.
  </li><li>And they do individual counseling,
 group counseling and they do all that kind of stuff. So we've been on this training thing
 that is we're on module one and we do four weekends a year and we're learning about understanding
 us in the context of being with other people. Which is one of my favorite parts. Yeah.
 So so we do that partially by sitting in on teaching, which is great. And the other part
 is by doing group counseling.
  </li><li>So half of the weekend is like classroom,
 like lectures, which are excellent,
 phenomenal teaching, just world class teaching.
 And then the other half of it is group therapy.
 Tell us what group therapy is like.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well, I actually probably have a better view of it
 after this past weekend than I did after the previous two.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Tell everybody what it's like.
  </li><li>Describe the room, describe how it's set up.
  </li><li>You sit in a room with a bunch of people you don't know.
  </li><li>Co-ed.
  </li><li>It's co-ed and these, you know, the same people
 for the whole four weekends, but like they're not people,
 I mean, they're not people you have any equity with
 or you know, whatever.
  </li><li>You never met them before.
  </li><li>No, and they're all, we're all there doing the same thing.
 You know, getting comfortable with ourselves,
 getting comfortable with emotions, all that kind of stuff.
 And so it's, I've found it really hard
 'cause I'm never really sure what's going on
 and you're just sharing like the first weekend,
 you're supposed to read a couple books
 and then come and bring a list
 of your 10 most traumatic events.
  </li><li>Hello person I've never met before.
 Let me read out my 10 most traumatic events.
  </li><li>And I don't know that I did the right thing,
 but I started assessing whether I thought people
 could actually handle one of the more traumatic ones
 And so I picked lesser dramatic ones because I just thought.
 And what did that tell you about yourself?
 Probably that I'm the hero child.
 Excited now though.
 So you're already trying to manage other people.
 I'm managing other people.
 I don't want to cause them distress.
 I don't want to be too much for them.
 Yeah.
 And I don't think that I'm like I'm necessarily too much, but I think my story is painful
 enough that it could cause damage at times.
 But it doesn't stop you telling that same story to hundreds of thousands of people. Yes
 But then I get to actually coach them through processing it praying it through and going to ministry time
 There's no ministry time in these events. It's like people talk about all this trauma and then we're like, okay
 We'll see you after lunch. What do you say is fair to say that a common theme
 In going through these weekends is what you mentioned before that I'm not quite sure what's happening
 Oh, yeah, I never know what's happening. And how does that make you feel really out of control?
 And usually like usually right now in our lives, I know what's happening usually
 We're the experts whatever it is, you know or part of the team that's leading it. So it is yeah
 It's globally uncomfortable and but don't you think I don't want to lead you
 But what do you learn from that experience of not being in control not being the expert having no grid of whether you're
 Doing it right or not. I
 I don't know what I've learned so far.
 I really don't.
 I'm like, okay.
 The ladies that are leading my group,
 I am confident they know what's happening
 and they're not, like their feathers aren't up,
 they're not concerned.
  </li><li>Is that something you've learned?
 Like on the first week, were you confident
 they knew what they were doing?
  </li><li>No, on the first week I was like,
 I don't think you guys even know what's going on here.
 And I was like, I don't know what we're doing.
  </li><li>And how does that make you feel?
  </li><li>Really unsafe.
  </li><li>Okay. - Yeah.
 And I had a revelation this week that,
 well, and I knew this already,
 I don't really trust people very easily,
 but I sort of just said to everybody,
 I don't really trust you,
 and that's probably something that I'm--
  </li><li>I have a question. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Isn't it funny that in the role that you currently occupy,
 you are never really in a situation
 where you need to trust people?
  </li><li>I trust people all the time.
 You mean, like, I trust them to get their jobs done.
  </li><li>Well, what I trust them with information.
 What I mean is in your job, you're pretty much the top
 of the food chain.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Can you imagine being the bottom of the food chain,
 there's all these people you have to trust.
 Where really the only people you have to trust
 are Jeff and me.
  </li><li>Right, but I have historically had lots of jobs
 where I did okay trusting people.
 It's just I didn't choose these people.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Right, so somebody else put them in a room with me
 and I'm like, I don't know who you are.
 You know, but actually by this weekend,
 I was sort of like, oh my gosh,
 I really feel love towards everybody in the room.
 What is happening?
 (laughs)
 So I was like, I really like these people.
 So yeah.
  </li><li>These people that you've only met on paper,
 I mean, not even on paper,
 but you've only spent, this was the third weekend
 you spent them.
 So in your whole life, you've only spent
 three Thursday, Friday Saturdays.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's kind of weird, isn't it?
  </li><li>It's weird.
 Yeah.
 I realized, oh, I'm looking forward to the next one.
 I didn't feel that way last time.
 I was like, oh, oh, wait.
 So the podcast list of episodes all about feelings.
 What have you learned about feelings, your feelings, feelings in general,
 my feelings, like, to talk to me a little bit about this?
 I think I've learned a couple of things.
 Like I have learned, I'm only comfortable with my feelings
 when the timing is convenient, which it rarely is.
  </li><li>So, again, help me assemble that means.
  </li><li>Whether it's sadness or whatever it is,
 like I will most likely shove whatever it is down
 until I can process sometime of myself.
 But that time may never come.
 So I just end up shoving, shoving, shoving down.
  </li><li>And is there a reason you choose to process it
 by yourself rather than with loved ones?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I usually process with you.
  </li><li>I feel like this is a therapy session.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm gonna charge you at the end.
  </li><li>Okay.
 No, I usually process with you,
 or I might process with Shannon
 or a couple of close friends or whatever.
 But I realized that sometimes I treat emotions
 like they're inconvenient.
 So, but as best I can figure by not experiencing my emotions,
 I'm actually cutting out a large portion
 of what God gave me to experience at any moment.
 So, and I think I figured out
 when I really sort of batten down the hatches on that.
 Like there was in 2014, it was a super rough year.
 We had lots of lots of trauma, lots of loss.
 And I remember getting to December and thinking,
 "I can't afford to feel things."
 Like I just can't afford to feel things anymore.
 So I didn't completely shut down.
 I can still feel things about my kids and whatever,
 but just like negative emotion, I've reached my capacity.
 And so I went and got ministry with the banks,
 and that was a lot better,
 but I don't think I turned back on my,
 or upped my allowances or whatever, you know?
 So this weekend's assignment.
 So the second weekend, our assignment was to take one
 of the traumatic events that we had shared,
 and then to write it out in detail and include,
 like what did things smell like?
 Tastes like, you know, what did the air feel like
 as you're writing out all the details?
 So I did that.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 And then you read that to your group
 and then everybody reacts to a whole statement.
  </li><li>So everybody reacts.
 Unpack that for people.
  </li><li>So you read this thing and the person
 who's leading the group is like,
 "How do you feel?"
 And you tell them how you feel before you read it
 and after you read it and all that kind of stuff.
 And then they're like, "Do you want any feedback?"
 We're like, "Sure."
 "Okay, who do you want feedback from?"
 And then you can ask different people like,
 "How did you feel when you heard my story?"
 And I think what I realized is none of my pain
 as a child had ever been validated.
 So I'm sitting in a room,
 I feel emotional right now just saying this.
 I'm sitting in a room with a bunch of people
 that have just heard not even one of the most
 traumatic events, but like somewhere way down the list.
 And they're like, I mean, just a range of emotions from,
 I am so angry that that happened to you.
 I'm so sad that, you know, all that kind of stuff.
 And I really feel like I was talking to Sarah today
 in the car and I was just saying,
 even though we just talked about it,
 nobody prayed for me afterwards, nobody,
 whatever, it was just a conversation
 and getting people's reaction,
 which basically was all validation of,
 yeah, that's messed up.
 Like that's really not okay to do that to a kid and you know, whatever.
 Um, even though I haven't had ministry since that weekend in November,
 that event feels like all the power has been removed from it,
 which it every time I had thought about it before,
 I'd always felt still really sad.
 So I thought, okay, like there's something to what we're doing.
 Just even the validation is actually bringing healing and,
 and it's allowing me to feel my emotions.
 'cause I just thought, I can't afford
 to have emotions about this.
 So now this weekend, this last weekend,
 we had to figure out basically how do we hide from God?
 So what are addictions are?
 And if your addictions aren't maybe obvious ones
 that we typically think of like alcohol or drugs or whatever,
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>What are your addictions?
 And I called you an empanic from the beach.
  </li><li>Remember, I was trying to fill out--
  </li><li>No. - Yeah.
 I called you from the beach
 'cause I was trying to fill out the forums.
  </li><li>Right. - And I was like, "Babe."
 Like, I mean, all I can come up with is like Netflix
 and social media.
 And what if they think that I'm just in denial?
 Or what if, and you're like,
 "Babe, I think you're overthinking it."
 Do you remember this conversation?
  </li><li>Not really.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was like totally like spinning.
 And you're like, "Babe, I think it's okay."
 Like, and I'm like, "No."
 Like, and then you said, you seem to have some performance
 and shame about not being a good enough sinner.
 That's what you said.
  </li><li>That does not sound like me.
  </li><li>Yes it does.
 It sounds exactly like you.
  </li><li>Wow, so there's that performance again.
 I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's amazing how much that comes up.
  </li><li>Yeah, and we had to answer like 20 questions.
 And you know, some of them I didn't have an answer for,
 which they say is fine, but it's not fine for me
 because I need to have an answer.
  </li><li>Do you know why you need to have an answer?
  </li><li>Yes, because there's safety in having an answer.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yes. So I'm like, I know this,
 like the whole time it's happening,
 it's like I'm on the outside of me as well going,
 "Well, that's interesting.
 Well, look at that right there."
 And then I texted Christine,
 he's another person that's with us on this thing.
 And I was like, "I hope that I'm doing it right."
 And you know whatever.
 And she said, "Just figure out what do you do
 when you need to hide from God
 and you don't want to experience your emotions."
 And I was like,
  </li><li>That's a great definition of addiction.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I was like, it's absolutely like Netflix or Hulu
 or like Instagram.
 It sometimes it's games like--
  </li><li>It's interesting Zelda Breath of the Wild didn't come up.
  </li><li>Well here's the thing.
 Zelda is in my thing that I wrote up
 that I read to the group that it's in there.
  </li><li>And that wasn't me being picky or konyo.
  </li><li>It's fine.
 I just realized like in, I played it a lot
 for the first like five or six months that we had it,
 but recently not that much.
 I mean, I was just playing it today
 because I helped MJ finish his last drawings or whatever.
 And so that made me think,
 oh yeah, I do really like this game.
 But like in the last couple of months, that hasn't been--
  </li><li>Would you like an observation?
  </li><li>What I'm choosing to run to, yeah.
  </li><li>My observation is that Netflix
 would be where you want to switch off
 and not wanna think, not wanna be present,
 just wanna, ah, until you can go to bed.
 Zelda is where you go to actively recharge.
 It's completely different.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Like one you go to hide
 and just don't even gauge with me.
 The other one is I watch it nourish you
 and restore your soul.
  </li><li>Yeah, I have so much fun playing that game.
  </li><li>I could be codependent with you in our addiction.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, maybe we could.
 Yeah, we could.
 Somebody else talk to us about that.
  </li><li>Yeah, answers on a postcard.
  </li><li>Answers on a postcard.
  </li><li>About whether we're in codependency about our Zelda addiction.
  </li><li>They're gonna answer us.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I mean.
  </li><li>Answer us on a postcard.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Nobody sends postcards anymore.
 Leave a comment.
  </li><li>Okay.
 So then we got to read a summary of this is,
 and what they ask you to do is assess,
 how has this addiction cost you spiritually
 in your walk with the Lord?
 How is it cost you emotionally?
 How is it cost you financially?
 How is it cost you in relationships with your kids,
 with your husband?
 How is it into your answering these horrible questions?
  </li><li>In front of everybody.
  </li><li>Yeah, and assessing, well, you read a summary
 in front of everybody, but you're sort of assessing,
 "Oh, this is a real deal thing."
 Like, it may seem socially acceptable to have,
 like to watch Hulu, you know?
 But it's actually not okay.
 You know what I mean?
 It's not okay for that to be how you're dealing
 with your emotions.
 It's not helping me.
 Or hiding from your emotions.
 Yeah.
 So would you say that you have a greater awareness
 of your feelings now?
 Much greater awareness, yeah.
 Would you say that you feel more than you used to?
  </li><li>I think that's hard to assess whether I feel more.
 I would certainly have shoved it down faster before.
 And now I'm just sort of letting myself feel stuff
 and that's sometimes great and sometimes
 just really uncomfortable.
 So what about you?
  </li><li>I just love that I've basically just sat here
 and done nothing and you've just talked the whole time
 And I love watching you step into the benefits of the stuff that I've been doing.
 So for, I don't know how long I should probably work out.
 But for some time, I've been in group therapy, which, I mean, we need to do an episode just on that.
 Yeah.
 That was just, I never thought I would enjoy it.
 I've loved it.
 And I felt like you've watched me love it.
 Go, what do you, I don't understand.
 like why do you like it?
 Like what do you get?
 And it's better felt than tell
 because your descriptions of what you've just been through
 must sound horrifying to everybody.
 Like seems to be--
  </li><li>I'm sure, I'm sure yeah.
  </li><li>But it's such a valuable experience.
  </li><li>It is hard, it is hard.
 It's not like-- - Oh, sure.
  </li><li>It doesn't make you wanna do
 if you're just messing around, but yeah.
  </li><li>No, you come off that weekend,
 Thursday, Friday, Saturday,
 you have an emotional hangover.
  </li><li>Yeah, so tired.
  </li><li>Wiped out.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>What about me?
 Like, do you have a question for me?
  </li><li>Well, you were saying like,
 you know, do you feel like you experience your emotions
 more and blah, blah, blah, that isn't that how you feel?
 Like after. - Well, you tell me,
 what's it like to experience Alan?
 You've been married to me for almost 15 years.
  </li><li>Almost 15 years, well, 14 and a bit.
 But you know me for 15 years.
 What's it like knowing me before doing this particular
 work on my feelings and after?
 I think you are way more emotionally connected,
 like in terms of knowing, reading the room,
 reading the kids, reading me better.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I'm like, I don't wanna use the word volatile.
 I was gonna say much less volatile.
 You won't really volatile, but.
  </li><li>I thought it was stoic before.
  </li><li>Like not in touch with my feelings.
  </li><li>Well, I don't agree with that.
 Like you said you weren't emotional,
 I would say you were emotional.
  </li><li>It's just they were all coming outside with you.
  </li><li>Yeah, they don't come out the sort of the wrong way
 and I wouldn't necessarily know when to expect them to arrive.
  </li><li>That's so funny.
  </li><li>So now it feels like because you're living
 in the moment of whatever it is that you feel,
 I actually feel way more peace because I'm like,
 "Okay, I know you're gonna process it.
 "I know you're gonna talk to me about whatever."
 And then we get to work stuff through,
 and nothing is a surprise or a...
  </li><li>For me, I feel totally different.
 For me, it feels like I am more connected with my heart,
 which is good and bad.
 The bad is I feel things.
 This huge advantage is to not being able to feel things.
 Man, you can be so productive,
 you can just power through.
 You're dead on the inside.
 And so the bad thing is now you feel stuff
 and you're like, I have to do stuff with my feelings,
 whereas before I was so much simpler,
 but my life was muted.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, I can--
  </li><li>It is a productivity killer though,
 to feel all your emotions.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh. - Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>So much more complicated.
 But so much more engaging.
  </li><li>Yes, true.
  </li><li>What would you suggest for people as a next step?
 Like if people are listening to this,
 I don't know if this sounds attractive to you or not.
 I don't know if this sounds horrifying and terrifying.
 I'm just trying to think of me in a previous state.
 would I think, oh, I wanna sign me up for that.
 What would the first next step be for people
 who are like, I'm interested in what you're talking about?
  </li><li>Well, here's the thing.
 I don't think that you're subscribed to our podcast
 if you are not trying to grow and heal in some way.
 So probably you're at least intrigued
 by the information that you're hearing.
 So I would say, Sage Hill actually has a podcast.
  </li><li>Oh, it is so good.
  </li><li>We can link to, right?
  </li><li>Yeah, we put link in the show notes.
 put a link in the show notes and it's really good and it gives you an idea of the main
 guys that are sort of teaching and running the place, gives you a feel for their heart.
 Before we went to the first weekend, I listened to a bunch of the podcasts because I was
 like, "I don't know what we're about to do and I don't know if I feel good about it."
 So I would suggest doing that and they also have a website you could go check out.
  </li><li>"Doddard Chip Dodd, who's one of the leaders of the stage, has written a book called The
 Voice of the Heart, which I hated.
 The first time I read it, oh my gosh, I hated it.
 I disagreed with all of it.
 I was so frustrated with it.
 I've rolled my eyes so much.
 And the teaching in that book is probably now
 the primary tools I use to access my heart.
 But I'd recommend it.
 Tell you what my breakthrough was.
 Was listening to Chip talk about on the podcast.
 So I read the book, didn't like the book,
 listened to the podcast, understood it more,
 reread the book like the book.
 So you're my old jewelry.
  </li><li>Yeah, I liked it.
 I liked it, you know, the voice of the heart.
  </li><li>Yeah, you're probably less internal battle than me,
 or maybe not, I don't know.
  </li><li>Yes, I'm very holy and interhealed.
  </li><li>I just realized something.
 When you're recording a podcast,
 nobody can tell when you pick your nose.
  </li><li>I don't pick my nose.
  </li><li>Yeah, I do.
  </li><li>Oh, okay. - But now that there's a camera here,
 I just realized I'm picking my nose and realized,
 oh, people can see that.
  </li><li>I have an idea.
  </li><li>What's that?
  </li><li>We will, you know how I want to invent taser sheets
 where there's like that taser lying down the middle?
 We can, I can get some sort of low voltage taser
 and just zap you in the leg, maybe in her thigh.
  </li><li>Wow, stay away from I in a thigh with your tasers.
 All right, well, based on the way that you're coughing,
 I'm gonna call it quits.
 Because you're in a cold, cold basement.
  </li><li>I need to go to the warmth.
  </li><li>You do need to go to the warmth.
 But thank you so much for tuning in.
 Thank you for listening.
