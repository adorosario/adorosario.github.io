 I am good. I hate ice cream. I don't think I should have. No, we should never eat ice cream.
 I know. Meant to make feels gross. And yeah, we keep making that stupid decision.
 Because it really seems good at the time. Well, when you walk in a basket of robins and they
 have s'mores ice cream, what are you supposed to do? Not eat it? Well, I didn't eat it. I had the
 world-class chocolate because that's what I always have. There was your error. I had s'mores
 and feel nothing but joy. You are lying. Maybe. Talk to me about this week.
 about this week. Well, it was a full week, wasn't it? We had a church wide fast.
 A three day fast. Talk about the opposite of eating ice cream. The opposite of eating ice cream would be drinking water.
 No, it would be fasting, which is what we did for three days. Well, we drank water.
 Oh, I guess I see where you were going with that. Yeah. Thank you.
 Yeah, we were fasting for these in Jerusalem. The whole Israel Gaza thing.
 We were fasting for the situation in Iraq, with ISIS, or IS as they're now known as.
 And we were fasting for Iceland, for the volcano.
 It seems like to be a lot going on in the world.
 There is a ton going on in the world.<br/>
 And I don't understand a lot of it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 All of it.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Me, except for the fact that Jesus is still in the throne.
 Yes, thankfully.<br/>
 So yes, fasting.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 fasting. I'm I used to be really into fasting. Talk to me about that. Well,
 suppose it was more hunger striking than fasting really.
 What your motors were all wrong? Yeah, it was like, God, I need answers to
 the following questions and I'm not going to eat until you give them to me.
 I didn't really have that revelation until after that that's what I was doing.
 But I did do 40 day fast for a number of years in a row.
 It's amazing. He wasn't moved by any of that.
 No.<br/>
 You're so confident in who he is. It's incredible.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I quite enjoyed our fast these three days.
 Yeah, it wasn't bad.<br/>
 I enjoyed breaking it more than doing it.
 Me too. I don't think broccoli ever tasted so good as it did on Thursday.
 Right. It was amazing.<br/>
 It was great.<br/>
 And I was quite proud of myself.<br/>
 Normally, you know, you're like, what's the smart thing I could do after
 fasting for three days?<br/>
 I know. Staking shake.<br/>
 But thankfully we didn't do that. We were quite wise.
 I'm talking about we never go to steak and shake.
 I know I'm using hyperbole to prove point that after not eating for long period of time, we tend to gorge ourselves.
 Oh, I just thought steak and shake was fun because it rhymed and it's typically gross.
 The first time I ever did a fast, like the very first fast ever, hadn't even fasted for a day.
 And I felt like the Lord told me fast.
 And so I decided I was going to do a 21 day fast on water.
 Over the cheaper much.<br/>
 And I did it with a friend and then we were.
 I thought at 20 days and then we counted it up and realized we were at 23 days.
 So we went to Wendy's and got a burger.
 I almost went to the hospital that night.
 I was in so much pain.<br/>
 I should have read something about fasting and, you know, what it was going to do
 to my body to do that particular thing.
 Like the document I posted to Twitter.
 And perhaps.<br/>
 Yeah, I, for those of you 20 years ago, I don't think about fasting.
 We shared a little bit about fasting at M&amp;A on Monday night.
 We'll post a link to that.<br/>
 And I hop in Kansas City who knew a lot about fasting,
 wrote a very helpful document about do's and don'ts
 when fasting and we'll post a link to that in the show notes.
 Speaking of things, we'll be up on our website.
 I wrote about going to Buckingham Palace this week, babe.
 Did you even know that I posted that?<br/>
 I did, yeah.<br/>
 I saw it.<br/>
 It was like your throwback Thursday or something.
 Yeah, it was a throwback Thursday.<br/>
 My mother, bless her, sent me in the mail,
 the original invite from Buckingham Palace.
 It's not like I forgot that that happened.
 Of course, I remember it happened,<br/>
 but it was some 10 years ago, maybe 13 years ago
 that I got invited to Buckingham Palace.
 And I think at the time I completely,<br/>
 it just didn't really hit me what a big deal that was.
 I think maybe I must have become Americanized
 by being in America,<br/>
 with everybody loving the royal family.
 I was like, oh yeah, that kind of was a big deal.
</p><ul>
  <li>It's a huge deal.
  </li><li>I know, but I didn't think about that at the time.
 I was like, oh, I'm going to the queen.
  </li><li>Tell them where the washrooms are.
  </li><li>I failed to mention in the article
 that I had bleached yellow hair.
  </li><li>And dreadlocks.
  </li><li>No, I didn't have dreadlocks, I shaved my head
 and dyed my hair yellow.
 So I was there in a pin-
  </li><li>With the dreadlocks before or after the shaved yellow.
  </li><li>They were before.
  </li><li>Duck yellow hair.
  </li><li>Yeah, my duck yellow hair.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>The bathrooms are hidden in the walls.
 Now I didn't mention this in the article,
 but I'll mention on the podcast.
 But when you go into the man's washroom,
 so you know, men have urinals or urinals,
 depending on which part of the world you're from.
 And one of the hazards of using full wall urinals,
 urinals is when you pee against the wall, you get splash back.
 Not a bucking in palisades in general.
 They have angled glass partitions that you basically pee over.
 And any splash back gets caught by the glass.
 It so doesn't end up on your treasures.
 Tell them about the bunnies.
 Oh, well, I mentioned that in the article.
 If you read the article, you can read about my slight full
 pa by using the palace of having bunnies in their garden.
 When it wasn't bunnies at all, Jog went up for Jones in a
 sophistication amongst royalty. Are those bunnies? What pretty bunnies?
 It is very good. We've been away all weekend, haven't we? We have. Which is why we're falling
 asleep. That's right. We took our wonderful team with 15 staff. School staff. Yeah, we all went
 away to the middle of nowhere to Big Cabin, did a retreat. Which was awesome. It was awesome.
 We had incredible food. Yes.
 Shared incredible moments of joy.
 Yes.
 Prayed for people.
 Yes.
 Top people.
 Yes.
 And floated down a river.
 We did.
 We really did.
 You love floating down rivers.
 Yes, I do.
 It wasn't a cliff jump, baby.
 Well, there was no cliffs involved.
 Well, it was like a 10 foot cliff.
 No, it was just a rock.
 Right.
 It was a large rock that looked cliff like in nature.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Well, we didn't actually float down a river then.
 We went white water rafting.
 It was a slower version we went our afternoon or two.
 And it wasn't fast.
 We were slowly more, but it was similar.
 All that really matters is that I beat tank at pool twice.
 The sheet verify that statement.
 Well, the truth is, well, I won both games, but it's because she
 scratched on the black.
 Both times.
 Yeah.
 It's very sad.
 It's not a great way to win, but I'll take it.
 Did you play a ping pong?
 No, or heck no.
 Have you seen her play ping pong?
 they were breaking us up like big one.
 It was great legit.
 Yeah, they were.
 They were surprisingly good at ping pong too.
 Yeah.
 And Shelby.
 Uh huh.
 And Matt was doing great too.
 He was.
 Yeah.
 All right, ping pong.
 That's where it's at.
 It's why I didn't play.
 We have some listeners questions this week.
 We have a bunch of them.
 This is from Twitter user spicy BLT.
 And they ask recently I've been pondering upon how to discern between wisdom
 and fear.
 If life is a continuous process of maturing, how do you know if you're ready to do the things
 that God has placed upon your heart? What do you think?
 Well, is that kind of two questions? They're pondering the wisdom.
 Well, I think they're asking, saying the context, Hey, I'll be wondering, you know, what's stopping
 me from moving forward? Is it wisdom or is it fear? So how do you know when
 What's the question?
 How do you know if you're ready to do the things God's place upon your heart?
 Well, like on one level, it's got opening the doors for you to do the things that he's
 placed upon your heart.
 Right.
 I think you're absolutely right.
 You start with whatever doors open to you.
 Opportunities lead to opportunities.
 I think typically, as long as you, if you can be faithful in the small things that
 present themselves that are in the direction that you want to
 head, more doors will open for you.
 I remember my first speaking gig ever was something called
 Marinatha camp was a kids camp. And they said, you know, would
 you come and teach? And I was like, yeah, I would love to teach.
 And so it was just it was five days I had teach once a day.
 And that little opportunity led to another opportunity led to
 another opportunity. And here I am on the other side of the
 world teaching a lot.
 Yeah, I think sometimes people think, well, a door opening will look like somebody asks
 me to come and speak at their conference or something huge.
 And usually the door opening is, you know, you have the opportunity to lead a small group
 or to, you know, minister with children's ministry or whatever, and to be faithful and
 learn your skills there.
 And then continue to walk through the doors that got open for you.
 I still think my favorite thing about John Arnott is that his first
 ministry opportunity, which is teaching Sunday school.
 Yeah.
 And he loved it.
 And he said, yes.
 So yeah, I think blossom where you're planted.
 Yeah.
 Whatever opens for you, step through the door and let your gift lead you.
 I remember Isabelle Allam answering a question, like, how do you know if you're
 a prophet and she was like, well, let your gift lead you.
 Just start prophesying wherever you have opportunity to prophesy and just see what
 happens.
 Give makes way for its giver and all that.
 So there you go.
 Twitter user happy ever Erica asked this question.
 I've had a hard time explaining to people that God doesn't have a problem
 with women in ministry.
 Would you please talk about that in your podcast?
 I love the question.
 It's like it's a very negative version of a positive truth.
 God doesn't have a problem with women in ministry.
 It's not that he doesn't have a problem with women in ministry.
 He made a way for women to have a vital role in ministry.
 and obviously that is a much longer topic than we have time for in a two or three minute
 question.
 We do have a teaching on that don't we?
 We do.
 I don't think we have recorded anywhere.
 We've spoken on it a bunch of times.
 We've been on the school and we've spoken on emanate.
 Chris Veltin however did just teach on it at Bethel did a great job.
 There's a two, I think a two session on Women in Ministry.
 I'll dig that out and post the link to it in the mp3 and that should tide you over until we get a chance to tackle that one.
 Cool.
 That would be fun to do.
 And then lastly, Twitter user,
 "Palin_86" asks,
 I was wondering if you might talk about the process between broken and confused
 and filled continually with a love of God.
 Was it a series of encounters or loads of counseling or both or something else?
 Great question.
 Well, I mean, I think for me, I think probably for both of us, really, it was probably a mix of both.
 I had some actual counseling, some sort of supernatural counseling by way of the Lord just doing, you know,
 theophistic type ministry on me while I was lying on the floor after somebody had walked by and prayed for me and that kind of stuff.
 But I'd say probably it was, in my experience, about 80% of my healing probably came through
 soaking and just letting the Lord wash over me, often not knowing what he was doing.
 And through some of those times, having encounters with him where he would sometimes show me
 what he's doing, sometimes I thought he was doing something completely different until
 later on.
 And then the other 20% was sitting down with people that are trained and saying, "I need
 help.
 I'm not getting past this particular thing."
 Right.
 I think God is so brilliant at everything that He loves to work.
 He's not limited to one method.
 And so I look back at my life and realize, yes, there have been the suddenlies of God
 when something happened and He breaks in and is very powerful, but equally and probably
 more so.
 There's been lots of process with God.
 Do you know that verse that says,
 "Work out your salvation with fear and tremble."
 There's a lot of process in your maturing with God.
 And so yes, I can identify times that people have prayed
 for me and something just instantly shifted,
 but I can also identify lots of this journey with God,
 which is, seems frustrating.
  </li><li>And if you would die and choosing to like God,
 you know, resurrect things.
  </li><li>Right.
 And it seems for strain,
 but it produces just as much fruit,
 especially in hindsight.
 That's probably where you build depth with God when you don't have what you think you need
 and then you persevere for breakthrough. So yeah, I would agree the same. I've had moments
 where the Lord just broke in amazingly and then moments when I've gone and saw other people's
 wisdom and counsel and had people pray for me and deliverance and all that sort of stuff. And then
 also just the sanctification process of dying, which is wonderful.
  </li><li>And exercising tenacity to just keep pursuing God even when you don't understand what's
 going on.
  </li><li>All right, brilliant.
 If you have a question for us, if you go to allonaj.com/ask, you can leave us a question.
 We'll do our best to answer it next week's podcast.
 Love that one to talk about our topic for this week.
 We'll talk about leadership.
  </li><li>Yep.
 So off the top of your head what makes a great leader?
 Well, it's funny because I was thinking about it in the car today and I was thinking are we talking about?
 People that we would pick to be leaders or people that we would choose to follow
 But I'm not sure that the answer makes any difference to that question right so I think a leader is a leader so probably things like
 Being teachable being people that
 hear God well being humble.
 You know, stuff like that, like I would think, whether you're talking about people that
 you want to raise to be leaders or people that you want to follow, you want people that
 are safe.
 So for people to be safe, they need to have some key elements like being teachable, being
 humble, pursuing God, you know, not always having to be right.
 that kind of stuff is, I think, really, really important about eBay.
 I'd fully agree. I remember Derek Prince saying, I'm not sure it was this statement
 verbatim, but it went along the lines of never trust a man who doesn't walk with a limp.
 And so I think about Jeff Dallar as a great leader. There's somebody who's super vulnerable
 and super real. If you've ever been in our church, you can pick that up instantly.
 and he absolutely walks with a limp in by that i mean he's not presenting himself as the answer man behold my children i have all the answers.
 He's just somebody who wants to follow the holy spirit and he's absolutely humble is absolutely teachable.
 I love that i think now that we're in the position where we get to raise leaders of course we've been thinking very intentionally about it.
 and john windber i remember john was a john on it told us the story anyway i heard a story about john windber speaking a seminar.
 On church growth and so he's in the middle of the seminar you know the seminars label church growth and he's probably 15,
 20 minutes into stock and one of the people that he's addressing you know in this workshop puts up his hand said i'm.
 I'm sorry this workshops as you speak about church growth and you haven't mentioned church growth at all.
 and jon's like no trust me i'm i'm getting there and so he keeps talking about fifteen minutes
 later the same guy stands up and says i'm so sorry it feels like i'm wasting my time here
 i came here to learn principles of church growth and you're just talking all about you know character
 and this and that and the next thing and jon's like stay with me honestly we're getting there
 continues for a little bit more than this guy gets up a third time just like seriously like i came
 here to learn about church growth and jon took off his glasses and you know just asked a man this
 brilliant question. He's like, this is about church growth. Let me ask you a question.
 How many people do you want in your church who are exactly like you?
 Now church.
 And the man solemnly thought about for a second, and he said,
 not many, and John said exactly and continued. And his whole point was,
 his teaching was all talking about refinement and character and the need for
 great character and godliness. And I think the question we have when we're thinking about
 leaders is how many more people do we want like this? Because leaders replicate themselves.
 You have done great things. You reproduce what you are. You teach what you know.
 But you reproduce what you are. When Jeff and I were at a
 Bethel a couple of years ago, now for our leaders advanced, somebody asked Stanley Silk the same
 question. I love his answer. He said, "Whenever we're thinking about releasing new leaders,
 the question we ask ourselves is, will this person protect the culture that empowers them?"
 And I thought that gosh, that's amazing because the danger in releasing leaders is if they're
 unhealed, then their focus in being a leader is, well, of course, the focus of any leaders
 leading people.
 But if you're unhealed, there's a temptation to lead them into your own empire that you're
 building, rather than leading them towards the vision of the organization's building.
 And so I think we're probably looking for people with, like you said, healed up hearts
 who are humble and teachable.
 That's a huge big deal.
 And we try and be that as well.
 Right.
 You know, as leaders, right?
 People that you can come to and go, Hey, actually, you know, be teachable and be able
 to receive input as well.
 What is our top three non-negotiables are for releasing leaders?
 My item, I need a moment to contemplate that.
 Do you have top three?
 No, I would say.
 I mean, character.
 Yeah.
 Visible love for the Lord.
 a demestructible of the Lord.
 You're looking at them thinking,
 yeah, I want more people like this.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, that one thing makes it so much easier
 to clarify it in an instant.
 You know, when you can meet someone, go, yeah, I want 10,
 15, 20, 50 more of you, easy.
 Don't pour my life into you
 and raise you up into leadership, absolutely.
  </li><li>I remember, and this is slightly different,
 but the principle will come through, I'm sure.
 I remember when we were running the prophetic team in Toronto.
 And so we would lead our team of prophetic ministers.
 And I remember somebody coming up to me one Sunday morning going,
 "Do you lead the prophetic team?"
 And I was like, "I do."
 And they're like, "Well, I want to be on the team."
 And I'm like, "Oh, well, that's awesome.
 You know, we do prophetic training here."
 And you know, you build a fill in an application form and that.
 And they're like, "Well, I'm a prophet, and I could absolutely read your mail."
 And I'm like, "Oh, well, then I'm so sorry that's not what we're looking for."
 And they were just astonished.
 And I was like, I'm actually more interested in somebody who can represent the heart of the Father
 than I am somebody that can read other people's mail. Because actually I can teach you how to
 prophesy, I can teach you how to access and hear the voice of the Lord and teach you how to
 see in the spirit. That stuff is easy to teach. It's more about the heart.
 But humility and love and the priority on people rather than prophecy,
 that's what I'm looking for. And I think the same thing, there's many, you know, talented people,
 but unless the heart and the characters right the talent is going to run amok and so yeah i do love
 that i think to p you're looking for people that i don't know how to phrase this that love well
 horizontally not just vertically you know that that they're not just showing love and affection
 for people in leadership but they actually demonstrate in their life that they love well
 regardless of title, regardless of, you know, because if you are only loving and honoring
 those people that are above you, then I think something's out of whack.
 I don't know who it was that taught me this phrase, but it's always stuck with me.
 But it was, maybe it was John.
 I forget who it was that said this to me.
 But they were talking about raising leaders in their ministry and they said, "To the
 The degree that you want my platform is the degree that I don't want you on my platform.
 If you're so focused is for...
 To gain favor so you can get a lot of time.
 Stage time, yeah, so that you can be seen.
 Then actually that's the wrong motive.
 And so if you think about the leaders that we've really pursued and promoted and released
 at Grace Center, it's people who that's not their focus.
 That's not what they want.
 And actually our hesitancy...
 It might even really not be what they were.
 Right.
 Our hesitance of the people that want the microphone and the spotlight because they're like,
 "What are you after?
 Yeah.
 Or what is it that makes you?
 Yeah.
 Talk to me about what you think the greatest joys of leadership are.
 You're in leadership full-time have been for many years.
 Yeah.
 Or some of the joys for you.
 Seeing people's lives transformed and getting to be one of the people that gets to call
 people to life.
 When I reflect on my life, there's been key leaders
 that if they were not or they were at the moment
 that they were, I wouldn't be here.
 You know? - Right.
  </li><li>And I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing.
 And maybe I'd be some, I mean,
 maybe I'd still be somewhere doing something.
 But it's been leaders calling me to life
 and believing in me when I didn't believe in myself.
 And so getting to do that for other people,
 like getting to call people to life.
 I love that.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Yeah, very cool.
  </li><li>That is cool.
  </li><li>And I love passing along what you've been given.
  </li><li>Right.
 I love making room for other people.
 Like I, you know, we talked about John and Carol
 doing that for us.
 You know, they are sealing being our floor
 and just how they were in a position to make room for us
 and to open doors for us and to release us.
 And I love, I love looking at people.
 And you know, when you're in leadership, God gives you a different perspective in many
 ways.
 And I love looking at people and telling them who they are.
 I just, I love that.
 And I love helping them along the process of releasing them into that.
 That's a tremendous joy.
 Yeah, I kind of love that.
 I guess being parents in the natural of three small children is, there's a fairly large
 crossover between leading and parenting. And I think I love that process. I love having
 spiritual sons and daughters. I love having a collection of people that you get to invest in
 consistently and diligently. I really like that part. And then watch what God does. I mean,
 awesome. Yeah. Talk to me about some of the costs, your personal cost of leadership.
 I think you can get misunderstood a lot, you know, where people, I think it's, and I did this,
 you know, years ago too, where, you know, you come to church and you bring all of your wounding
 with you and until God's dealt with a lot of it, often whatever authority stuff you've had
 from the way you grew up at home, you just place on the pastor and his wife, you know.
 So I think some of the things that are difficult about it
 are realizing that, I don't know, people misunderstand
 based on the hurts that they've been through
 in previous times.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I also think it's, I mean, for me right now,
 it's hard to balance work and family and, you know,
 that our kids are really super important
 that they know that they're loved
 and they're not second to the church and that kind of stuff.
 So the balance of wanting to make sure
 that the people that you're pastoring know,
 that you love them and that they feel loved well,
 but also making sure that our kids know that they're loved
 and loved well.
 So I think those are some of the costs of the challenges.
  </li><li>We would teach it on this weekend.
 Part of the reason we took our leaders away
 was to kind of give them a training, a boot camp training for the leadership roller,
 about to step in. And I was thinking about part of the cost of leadership, a part of the,
 you know, and so huge privilege. So this isn't a negative at all. But it's actually ensuring
 that you have enough love in the bank so that the people you're leading, you know, when they get
 hurt or they lash out at you, their heart gets absorbed by the love that you have that's an
 overflow of the Father. The danger is when you're running on empty to not send a bad
 example in by lashing out or responding in horror or defending yourself.
 Not thinking it personally.
 I think there is a burden of leadership that's very, very real, but the truth is if we are
 constantly grounded in the Father's love, that burden becomes very, very light. But I
 I love it. I absolutely love the respect. I can a huge privilege to get to lead people.
 I think it's I don't want to do anything else. Brian Johnson tweeted this brilliant thing that
 I saw in favor to the while back actually 49 days ago according to Twitter. He said this what
 I've learned in leading people is if I take two extra minutes to communicate clearly, it will save
 me two years of fixing problems. No, that's excellent. What would you say is the biggest thing that
 you have learned about leading in the last five years.
 Do you like that I'm just throwing you
 these softball questions?
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm like, thanks for the warning babe.
 Please remember my contemplative is my second language.
 The biggest thing.
  </li><li>Do do do.
  </li><li>The biggest thing.
  </li><li>Do do do.
  </li><li>Well.
  </li><li>Ah, thing that you have learned then.
 Let's narrow it down from the biggest thing ever,
 and this better be absolutely precise, too.
 What is a thing that you have learned in the last five years?
  </li><li>What's anything that you have learned in the last five years?
  </li><li>I have learned that my actions
 can be sending disrespect messages to the people that I love
 without me knowing it.
 For example, as a very high doer,
 high-intensity person who likes to finish a task. It is entirely feasible that I can turn up to
 speak at church or conference. And my whole focus is to get my laptop set up and have my
 material ready to deliver so that I can bless the people with the sermon that I've been working on
 that I really think the Lord wants to bring and deliver. But I can be so focused on that task
 that I may have just walked past 20, 30 people who I love, but I haven't even noticed them because
 because I'm so focused.
 And if I'm not careful, it doesn't matter what I say.
 It's that old adage of, I don't care how much you know
 till I know how much you care.
 I've just communicated, I don't care about you.
 I care about saying my laptop up.
 And that isn't true.
 I really do care about you.
 But in that moment, I'm focused on this.
 So I remember Jeff Dollar after a couple of months
 of us running Amine, came to Amine one night,
 and he took me saying, he's like,
 "Hey, can I give you a little bit of advice?"
 I was like, "Sure you can."
 He's like, "I've noticed that you walk back and forth,
 either the sound to ask or to the video board or whatever. I said, yeah. He says, when you do that,
 walk slower. Because he said, you know, your, your, your goal is to get to the back. And of course,
 I'm thinking, of course, is I want to get to the back and make sure that my stuff is working.
 He said, you have it in doing that, you've just passed 50 people and you haven't acknowledged any
 of them. And that's, that might seem like a trivial example, but I've realized in reflection,
 Oh, God, my actions, my words, my tweets, maybe communicating something that isn't actually in my
 heart. And so I actually haven't a think, okay, right.
 Yeah, people need to matter more than the plan.
 Right.
 Right.
 Is my heart communicating disrespect messages that I'm unaware of?
 Yeah.
 And at times they are and I'm deeply sorry if you're listening to this
 that I've ever communicated dishonor disrespect to unknowingly.
 And I would say I'm because we're wired fairly similar.
 I would say a similar thing as I as I think about the leaders again, who
 have touched my life and brought transformation. It's rarely been through their sermon. It's usually
 been through a, you know, a 30 second or a couple minute connect where I felt like I was heard and
 understood and I mattered. And so I could then receive from the Lord again, you know, like that
 kind of stuff. So yeah, I guess slowing down and taking time for the moment.
 I would say the scariest verse in scripture. Rani leader is 1 Corinthians 11 verse 1.
 where Paul says, imitate me as I imitate Christ.
 So the challenge for us as leaders is when we walk in and just say to our team,
 hey guys, just emulate me as I emulate Christ.
 I'm like, really, do I want them communicating to others the way I communicate to others?
 And so it's a great benchmark that Paul set out for there.
 And the challenge and the joy is being empowered by the Holy Spirit to live that
 and be humble enough to acknowledge when you haven't and you know actually keeping
 sure accounts to say oh I'm so sorry I let you down in there would you?
 I missed it. Anything else you want to say about leadership before we wrap this puppy up?
 I think it's fun to be a leader. I think sometimes you can talk about leadership and it can sound to other people like
 leadership sounds horrible. It's not horrible. It's wonderful and it's an incredible privilege.
 But it is challenging and it's because you, if you want to be a good leader, you need
 to constantly be examining yourself so that you're allowing the Holy Spirit to do what
 He needs to do through you in order to do what He wants to do through others.
 I'm going to end this with a reflection from Rick Warren to eat this out.
 This is brilliant.
 He said, "Great people aren't born.
 They're ordinary people who become great by their great commitment to a great cause."
