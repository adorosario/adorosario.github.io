<p> I'll in an age is podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is welcome to episode two oh three of keeping up with the Jones is the weekly podcast with new episodes every Monday.
 Mrs Jones. Yes. What has happened since the last time we sat down to record a podcast.
 Goodness so much has happened.<br/>
 It feels like it's been two or three weeks.
 It's one week seven days, baby.<br/>
 It was one really long, really full but great week.
 Well, last week on Monday and Tuesday,
 not even quite a week yet at the recording of this podcast,
 Steve Long was in town and teaching on the school, wasn't he?
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, our friend Steve, we actually did a podcast interview
 with him last week, if you didn't get a chance to listen to that,
 you can visit our website and just as the episode
 before the one you're listening to right now.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Steve was in teaching on physical healing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 teacher. He really is. He really practices demonstration and explanation at the same time,
 which I love. Yeah. There's something about all these previously Baptist people, their ability to
 teach something is remarkable, isn't it? Baptists make great charismatic, so I'm going to tell you.
 They do. They do. And then on your two last week, you and I were teaching on kingdom parenting,
 which is what? Basically, what are you looking for in spiritual parents? How do you find that?
 all that kind of stuff. And then I do some stuff on what it's like to actually be,
 allow yourself to be parented or reparented. I've never heard you teach because you're
 usually teaching, you know, the way our schedule is set up. As one of the teachings I've never heard
 you do, and I don't think you've ever heard me teach my part. So I hope we're teaching the same
 thing question. I did hear you teach your part this time. Yeah. And it was good. It was good,
 baby. You're so gifted. I also got to teach in second year one of my favorite sessions all about
 how to use a piece of software called Accordance, which is our Bible study software. And I was so
 proud of our students. Usually there's a certain level of panic whenever you talk about technology,
 but this year everybody, it seemed like everybody was gung ho, which is amazing. And then what was
 extra fun for me was this week I got to teach on our third year. Have we announced that we have a
 third year of school is a financial life.
 I don't know if we have on the podcast, but now we have three years.
 We're piloting here three this year.
 And so I got to teach our students who are beta testing year three for us all
 about the hero triangle, the, which is, I just love that teaching about
 interpersonal communication using the Karpman drama triangle and how to get
 out of conflict and how to stop being passive and become powerful.
 Anyway, it was so good.
 All of that, as good as that week was, was vastly overshadowed by the awesomeness of our
 having the Clairs Conference that we just finished last night.
 It really was. It was such a great conference.
 I loved even before the conference began. Like Friday night, we like to get there earlier,
 just to kind of wander around and greet people and meet as many people as we can.
 Lots of visitors from out of state. I got to meet a lovely couple from Indiana.
 Indiana is a state.
 It is a state, yes.
 Some people from St. Louis, some people, basically all over, including a contingent of wonderful
 listeners to this podcast show who'd come down for the conference from Alaska.
 Yes, and they came bearing gifts, didn't they?
 They did.
 Explain to me what it was, because as soon as we walked in the church, somebody said,
 "Does a basket of frozen meat for you?"
 Which is great news to me.
 If anybody offers me frozen meat, I'm excited.
 But this is me.
 I don't think I've ever eaten before.
 Well, it's, well, I mean, it was freshly killed, moose meat and caribou meat that had been
 made into different kinds of sausages.
 So apparently the caribou sausage has jalapenos and cheese in it.
 And it's quite spicy, which I was like, Oh, that's going to be good meat, cheese and
 spice.
 That's all three food groups.
 And then for me, they brought me coffee.
 So I get both meat and coffee.
 You could have coffee, but you refuse to be enlightened.
 In addition to that, our friends and park wrestlers from Scotland and England, we met
 them and they brought with them care packages which you know nothing about and now no longer
 exists.
 Wait, you didn't actually eat the chocolate, did you?
 All in all, the conference was amazing.
 Jones, I was supposed to get some of it.
 You got coffee, so it just all works.
 Oh dear, okay.
 But seriously, the conference was amazing.
 It really was.
 Our dear friend David Wagner was sharing at the conference and it's never dull moment
 with David's in the house. No. And Jack Deere, who you're going to hear from in a second,
 was also sharing the conference. And then worship. Oh my gosh. Well done, Grace and
 our worship team. It was just beautiful. If you weren't at the conference, or even if
 you were at the conference and you want recordings of all of the teaching, the MP3s for the conference
 should be up at our website by the time you listen to this and by our website. I mean,
 Grace and her website, I'll put a link to it in our show notes if you're interested in
 that. But yeah, a great time. Do you any highlights from the conference?
 Trebe? I think I was, I mean, the S tons of highlights, but I think I was super
 struck by here you have two men both with incredible testimonies of brokenness and trauma.
 And they're standing up there and they're still talking about how much they love God and how loved
 by God they feel. And I think there's just a lot of hope in that, like no matter what
 you've been through or what you've survived when you hear those kind of testimonies.
 Right.
 Yeah. So, but I mean, it was also really fun on the final night of the conference. The
 Holy Spirit just really broke out in a way that felt super familiar to me in that it
 felt so much like Toronto in '94. And so it was chaos, but it was wonderful. And God
 was doing all kinds of stuff. And we got home really, really late at night. So we're a little
 tired, but super happy. And I just think the Lord did some amazing things this weekend
 that we're going to keep hearing about. Like the ripple effect is going to keep going.
 Thank you to everybody who came to the conference. I trust that you had an amazing time in the
 presence of God too. And we're thrilled that you came. We announced our new spring conference
 that's happening, our source conference, which will be happening. I'll put a link to all of that
 in the show notes. I mentioned that our speakers this weekend, David Wagner and Jack Deere. David's
 been on the podcast before. He has an amazing story, as you just mentioned, babe. Yeah. And in many
 ways, similar to your story, similar to Jack's story, and that you're listening to it, and you're
 and how can one person have endured this much trauma in their life? It's episode 86. If you
 haven't listened to it, I'd encourage you to listen to after this episode. So we love having David
 David's just a dear friend and a wonderful minister. It was our second time having Jack at the
 conference and we just could not pass up the opportunity to ask him if he'd come on the show
 and be interviewed. And we were thrilled that he'd said yes. Long time listeners of the show
 will know that Jack's book have had a huge impact on my life. I was raised, for those who don't know
 my story, in a very conservative evangelical church, grew up with first-generation Christian parents.
 We loved the gospel of Jesus, but knew nothing about the Holy Spirit. And I meet the Holy Spirit
 shortly after my 21st birthday in my early 20s, had no grade for what had happened when I met the
 the Holy Spirit. And I started reading one of his books called "Surprise by the Power
 of the Spirit," which really helped me understand the work of the Holy Spirit. And then later
 on in my journey into the prophetic and learning to hear God's voice, I was greatly assisted
 along that path by one of Jack's other books called "Surprise by the Voice of God." They're
 two of my most recommended books. Their books, I suggest every believer, reads, especially
 you've come from a conservative evangelical background and some of the charismatic stuff
 that we talk about is interest you, but maybe it's not your experience. I highly recommend
 you reading this book. So on Friday afternoon, Jack came over to the house and sat down with us,
 and we talked about his new book and what he learned about pain and friendship with God,
 and this is what came out of that.
 A.J. Jones. Hello. Ask me how excited I am. How excited are you?
 I am very excited because I have one of my personal heroes in the studio with us today.
 I know, right?
 Dr. Jack Deere.
 Look at you.
 You're in Franklin, Tennessee with the Joneses.
 We're so excited to have you on the show.
 Me too, Alan.
 I feel like I could speak to you all day.
 There's so many stories.
 I want to hear.
 There's so many questions.
 We could wander through modern day church history.
 You've been involved with the vineyard, with the Kansas City Profits, you know, all of
 your books that you've written, the little nerd in me just wants to sit and go, "Tell me the story. Hey, what about that?"
 But you've written this brand new book. I've just finished reading it this week.
 It was a hard book to read because the subject matter is not light and frothy.
 If it was sad to read, I can only imagine how hard it was to write, harder yet to live,
 talk to me about the process of this book and why would you volunteer for all of this transparency?
 So the title of the book is even in our darkness.
 And after my son died, that's a pivotal event in our life.
 My second born son got in drugs when he was 13.
 And at 22, he took his life.
 It's on December 27, 2000.
 And he shot himself in his head with a 44 Magnum, a gun that we used to scare bears away from our house in Montana on top of a mountain.
 I was the one to find him that morning and my wife and I, his brother and sister, we gathered around his body.
 I held his head in my hands and I prayed for God to bring him back to life.
 And we said we're going to pray until God brings him back to life for the
 police come and make us leave. After about 30 minutes the police came and made us leave.
 That plunged us into the darkest, most unforgiving world. Until that morning,
 I had a great story for my life. I was meant to write books speaking churches
 Help people grow in their relationship with God
 But after I found my son, I had nothing to say. I mean, I thought he was gonna be beside me in ministry
 I thought he was gonna get out of drugs
 So I lost my story for for living I couldn't write I tried to write
 But it just came out as these lifeless cliches my wife went down trail of opioids and alcohol
 And ended up in rehab and actually ended up in four rehabs.
 So I thought I was going to lose her.
 And so our life just sort of disintegrated.
 I couldn't write, oh, and then I tried to,
 about four years after I lost my son,
 I tried to plant a church.
 That's the word I used, plant.
 What I did was I took over a dying church
 of about 250 people.
 And I thought, you know, in my past,
 every ministry I've touched has grown.
 And so I just assumed that would happen with this church.
 and it didn't happen. For the first time in my life, I couldn't grow a church, I couldn't write,
 and I couldn't get my wife sober. I thought it was my responsibility to get my wife
 sober. So we just went into a disintegrated life. And for a long time, it was hard to find a story
 for a living. It was hard to find a reason for getting out of bed. And I ended up going to rehab
 for anger. It was in her second rehab. I went there just for family week and it turned out that the
 counselors said, "You're a really angry person." I ended up going into rehab there and it was a
 life-changing experience. I wrote a chapter about it in the book. Anyway, I came out of that rehab
 and for the first time in six years, I was able to write. And I started writing the opening chapter
 of this book. And the words just began to flow out of me. And I decided I want what I want to write
 is a book about friendship with God. But I don't want to write it as though this is an easy thing.
 I mean, I want to really tell the truth about our life. I want to talk about the sins in our
 life, the sins in our marriage. Instead of standing on a stage and pretending that, you know,
 We came out of this pretty well, pretty unscathed, and we have this great faith and all that.
 And a lot of times that's what we preachers do.
 We stand on a stage and we present a version of the Christian life that doesn't exist anywhere.
 But the people listening to us, they don't know that.
 So what they think is this guy is living the normal Christian life and they're the failures.
 And so what we teach them to do is to go underground with their sin.
 They don't tell anybody about what they're struggling with because they think their life is abnormal.
 So I wanted to write a book that was different with all of our struggles, an unsanitized version
 of the Christian life, but integrate that in with how God uses all of that, the pains,
 everything to produce a friendship with Him, which I think is the goal of life. It's being
 friends with God, feeling His affection, enjoying Him, and living out of pleasure as opposed to
 enduring God and living out of obligation.
 I got so many questions out with that, that one response.
 So let me ask you a couple of questions.
 You so casually mentioned, yeah, so, you know, I went to therapy.
 I went to group therapy.
 I know a little bit about your story.
 Well, you tell a lot about your story in this book, but, you know, you are, I
 mean, we'll chuckle about this, but, you know, you are a once upon a time, a
 dignified professor, you were taught to disdain emotion, pain, attention to that.
 It's just the flash, it's the distraction.
 That's the word, the word, the word, the truth.
 What motivated you to go to a group?
 And did you have any internal struggles with that?
 Any objections?
 Was pride knocking at your door?
 Or were you at such a point a desperation
 that you were trying to think of?
  </li><li>Well, prior to actually going into a group therapy,
 I used to make fun of it.
 I thought, look, all you really need is the word.
 You need to have some Christian friends
 and you study the word, you pray,
 And you just, you got a group and you do together,
 you do what the word says.
 And it's like weak people go to counseling
 or weak people go to group therapy.
 And I'm not a weak person, I'm strong person,
 I'm disciplined.
 And at Dallas, we sort of disdained feelings.
 When I was a second year student,
 one of my professors said at the beginning of class,
 liberals feel we think,
 and the whole class erupted in applause and laughter.
 The message was really clear, feelings are bad,
 mind is good.
 And that was just platonic theology.
 That's all that was.
 God didn't make us just minds.
 He made us with hearts, with feeling.
 And we're supposed to be in touch with pleasure
 and all that.
 So I ended up going into a group therapy session
 sort of against my will.
 I went up for family week with my wife
 and my anger was off the charts.
 but I didn't believe I was angry.
 I just believed I wanted to do things right.
 So denial was pretty strong.
 Yeah, and somebody, you know, prior to that,
 I mean, all my life, people have said,
 "Jack, that's so harsh."
 And I go, "It's not harsh.
 I just want things to be done right."
 Right, I care, I care.
 That was kind of, that was the way I sort of processed
 all those things.
 And because I'm a theologian and conversant
 with scripture and theology, I could justify it.
 Yeah, I got to pass on most of the really bad behavior
 in the church.
 as a result, I got the string of bad relationships behind me
 of hurt people, but I just say,
 well, those are just over sensitive people.
 You know, they don't care like I care.
 So I go to this therapy program for my wife,
 I'm doing it for my wife, sure.
 (laughing)
 And the first thing a therapist does is he says,
 do you always interact like that?
 And I said, what are you talking about?
 And he said, just like that, your volume, your face,
 the tone, you're angry, and I go, I'm not angry.
 And he goes, there you are, you are, you are.
 Is this how you interact with your wife?
 And the inside, I was really furious
 because he was suggesting that I was part of my wife's problem.
 I was her savior.
 Not wasn't part of the problem.
 I'm the one that's putting up with all this drinking stuff
 and trying to rescue her.
 I haven't left there.
 And I couldn't see that I was treating her like a child
 and expecting her to make decisions like an adult.
 I did not know that I did not have power over her drinking.
 In fact, I did not know I was powerless over life, right?
 Without me, you can do nothing.
 Well, I had an interpretation that sort of protected me
 from what he really meant.
 So at the end of that week,
 the people in charge of Lisa's therapy
 constructed a therapy session
 where she was able to confront me
 with what my anger had done to her.
 And after listening to her,
 tell some of the stories in front of the whole group,
 from her therapy group, what I had done to her,
 I felt so sad because now hearing that
 and hearing it with an audience thinking,
 how could I have been that insensitive?
 That was the thing that sort of broke me
 and made me decide I wanna go into their therapy program.
 They had a therapy program called Survivors One
 and it dealt with the trauma that happens to you
 from birth till you're 17
 and then they connect that traumatic,
 that all the trauma that was done to you,
 they connect it with the adult dysfunctions in your life
 and then they have a way of helping you
 get over those dysfunctions.
  </li><li>Was that the first time you were able to draw
 the parallel between those two things?
 Or did you had hints of that in your adult life?
  </li><li>No, I didn't have any hints of it.
 I mean, I come out of a traumatic life.
 My mom and dad were at war from the time I was about five
 or six.
 My dad killed himself when I was 12 years old
 and left a 34 year old widow with a 10th grade education
 to care for four kids.
 I was the oldest of 12.
 And then our whole home goes south.
 There's this parade of men in our home.
 I see things a child should never ever see.
 My brothers and sister did do things
 you should never ever see in your home.
 I was permitted to drink in our home from the time
 I was 13 mixed drinks for mom and her boyfriends
 and then drink at the bar with them.
 I just heard and saw stuff that was so defiling,
 but I just thought, well, this is just life.
 You're a child.
 So when you're up with--
 You don't know.
 Yeah, you don't know that's abuse.
 And my parents not only had no Christian friends,
 they had no friends at all.
 So sick homes don't have friends.
 They have secrets.
 And so all this stuff stays inside.
 And there's no way for you to get any help.
 So I grew up with all that.
 I become a Christian at 17.
 Hear the gospel for the first time.
 Jesus died on the cross for me in my place.
 If I would trust him to forgive me
 and give me a new life, he will come into my heart.
 I hear that on December 18th, 1965,
 and I trust him and I'm born again.
 Second verse of scripture I memorized
 was Second Corinthians 5-17.
 If any man be in Christ,
 old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.
 He's a new creature.
 So I go, that past done and dusted.
  </li><li>It just magically disappears on that vein.
  </li><li>Yeah, right.
 So I got theology to back that up.
 That's what he said. Old things are passed away. And so if a person let's say I'm 19, 20,
 22, a person asked me about my life, about my childhood, I say, it was mostly just gray,
 kind of boring. That's literally the way I would describe it. You don't need for any pop psychology.
 Yeah. Well, good. Let's move on. Yeah. So my best friend in college asked me,
 what does your dad do? I said, I killed himself when I was 12. And my best friend said,
 I must have been off and I go, oh, it was kind of hard on us. I mean, mom couldn't
 couldn't pay the bills all the time, we almost lost our house twice, but that was all.
 You'll know this just because of the process you've been through in recovery, but the amount of
 dissociation a child needs to go through to survive the trauma you experienced, you literally
 separate from yourself and you just recompartmentalize and move on. In your book, you talk about how,
 in one sense, it's a blessing and a curse. You find a savior in that you find a system that
 that lets you find the identity, you find theology,
 you find you were previously, I mean,
 I don't wanna sell you by your own words,
 you didn't academically excel
 until you discover passion for languages
 and then are you kidding me, you're off the charts
 in terms of academic success,
 you're in a system that rewards performance
 and it sounds like that's good medication
 to keep all of that pain away.
  </li><li>Yeah, and it was, and it was really heady.
 So at 17, I don't know, a single verse of scripture,
 I don't know God at 27.
 I'm a professor of Old Testament exegesis
 and Semitic language as a Dell seminary.
  </li><li>I mean, that's remarkable.
  </li><li>I can walk into a classroom at 27
 and I can teach Hebrew or Greek without notes.
 It wasn't just, I was good at it.
 I absolutely loved it, breathed it.
 And so that success was sort of overwhelming
 and it just kind of covered the natch.
  </li><li>The pain, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, just numbed all that.
 And then I started church that becomes wildly successful
 and they're a stock receive.
 My city are going to it and my friends are 10 years older.
 They're the CEOs of companies.
 I'm riding on private jets, going to these great ranches.
 And so all that pain is just this distant, distant memory.
  </li><li>Just a little echo away, but just doesn't vanish.
 It's still there and it's gonna eke out.
 I have a friend who describes it as, you know,
 a lot of times with our emotional pain,
 it's like keeping beach balls suppressed underwater.
 You can do it, but the more pain you have,
 more balls you have to manage. And then one day somebody says something to you and this
 beach ball flies up, hits them in the face and they're like, what's that? And you're
 like, well, it's just you're over sensitive. Yeah. And you live a life of justification
 of separate in yourself from your pain and the pain you cause.
 Yeah, somebody asked me either day, they go, how would you describe your story? Now, I
 would never have said this in a 20 years ago. But today, here's how I would describe my
 I'm the kind of guy who finds all these really creative ways to leave God without it looking like I've left God.
 Wow.
 And then he finds all these creative ways to bring me back.
 Yeah.
 And at the time, I don't even know I'm doing that.
 Of course you don't.
 So I give you an example.
 In the 1990s, I'm living in Whitefish, Montana, one of the most beautiful spots in the world.
 We live on a mountain.
 At 95, I start investing in stocks.
 stocks. And this is when the tech stocks were just going on the chart. And so my best friend
 and I started investing in stocks. And on some days, I put all of our savings in stocks.
 And on some days, I'm making more money in one day than I made in an annual salary before.
 And so by the spring of 2000, I figure I've got four or five months to go and then I will
 have enough money if this stuff just keeps on going the way it's going to cash out and
 never have to work another day of my life.
 But in order to do that, I've been doing this for five years now.
 And so I've been paying more attention to the stock market.
 I've been reading more about financial stuff than I'm reading my Bible, than I'm really
 thinking about God.
 I mean, what's firing me up is not God.
 What's firing me up is everything I'm learning in the stock market.
 And I'm still writing a book.
 I wrote that surprise by the voice of God in '96.
 I'm still traveling around the world,
 actually speaking at conferences and all that stuff.
 I'm not going to church anymore.
 My best friend and I aren't going to church.
 We're investing in the market.
 And so God's still there, but he's kind of like,
 I've got him off to a corner.
 What's really exciting is making money in the market.
 And then 2000, December 27th comes,
 and I lose my son, and all of a sudden,
 money is not important anymore. Nothing is important. You can always get money back,
 but you can't get a son back. And I end up losing all that money. Okay, so here's an
 example of God bringing me back. And I didn't know I needed to be brought back. So two weeks
 after we lose my son, we're in Fort Worth. We wouldn't spend another night in our house
 in Montana, we took his body, went back to Fort Worth, his birthplace and my birthplace.
 And we live with our best friends.
 And they have a huge, huge home.
 And so we were in their home two weeks after his funeral, the bill for the funeral comes
 and it's $10,064.69.
 And the funeral company wants their money today.
 They couldn't find us for two weeks.
 They didn't know where we were living.
 And no problem because I still have a lot of money in the bank account.
 I've lost more than half of my money
 'cause the tech stocks collapse,
 but I still have money to pay the bill.
 30 minutes after I get that funeral bill,
 my secretary walks in with a sack full of mail,
 and I know what it is, sympathy cards.
 So I empty the cards on the desk, 38 cards,
 and out of those 38 cards, 22 checks fall.
 One check for each year of Scott's life.
 He was 22 when he killed himself.
 The funeral bill was $10,064.69.
 I total up the checks and they're $10,065.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>I am sitting there, my heart is about to explode.
 And I'm saying, not thank you.
 I'm saying, why?
 Why God?
 I mean, I knew that was God speaking to me.
 I mean, that's not a coincidence.
 That is God speaking to me.
 And I'm saying, why?
 What does this mean?
 And I just sat there with my heart thumping,
 and then I hear these three sentences.
 I paid for his death.
 I paid for his life,
 and I'll pay for everything you need the rest of your life.
 And I just began to weep.
 I had spent the last five years ignoring God for money,
 and it was like God said,
 "Okay, if money's important to you,
 I'll win your heart back with money."
 It was one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
 I found this way to leave him,
 not really thinking I'd left him,
 and he finds a more creative way to bring me back to him.
  </li><li>The kindness of God that leads us to repentance, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>He rears us with the happiness.
  </li><li>Exactly, that's exactly what it is.
  </li><li>It's beautiful.
 There was a story I read in your book
 about you ministering to a young man.
  </li><li>It was that first time I went back to church.
  </li><li>Tell us that story.
  </li><li>Okay, so eight weeks after we lost my son,
 I hadn't gone to church.
 I hadn't laid my hands on a single person
 and prayed for them.
 And I get this church from Emerald.
 It's got about 5,000 people.
 I go there every month, speak.
 I mean, I go to their elder meetings once a month.
 I speak in all their retreats.
 I've been great friends with them for like three years.
 So they call eight weeks after we've lost Scott.
 And they say, all the senior pastors are going to be gone.
 This next Sunday, we have a famous guest speaker coming in.
 Could you come and emcee the services for the weekend?
 You'll only be gone 24 hours, two services Saturday night,
 two services Sunday morning.
 You get back on a plane and you'll only be away from Lisa for 24 hours.
 Lisa says, "Honey, go.
 I've got Stephen and Elise here to take care of me.
 That church has been so good to us."
 They're in Amarillo, Texas, up in the panhandle.
 And we're back in Fort Worth at this time.
 So I get on plane and I'm seeing the first Saturday afternoon service.
 It's over.
 And I'm standing down at the front.
 And we've got maybe 70 people on the prayer team that are praying for people afterwards.
 but I'm not praying for anybody.
 And I look over to my right and I see this blonde lady
 leading a person.
 And I can't tell if the person is a man or a woman,
 a boy or girl, because the person has no face.
 And then all of a sudden she's walking straight to me.
 So I'm by myself, I'm not praying for anybody.
 And she comes up and introduces herself.
 She says, "Hi, I'm Michelle.
 "This is my son, Aaron.
 Six months ago, Aaron was so distraught that he put a shotgun under his chin and pulled the trigger.
 It blew his face away, but he survived it. It's taken multiple surgeries to get him to this point.
 And here's what this point meant. When I looked at him, whether it should have been eyes,
 there were just these slits that were sewn shut. You couldn't even tell there were eyes there.
 And this squiggle in the middle of his face that was once a nose, I mean, it was unrecognizable.
 and then this misshapen hole was the mouth.
 And out of the throat was a permanent tracheotomy tube.
 He was so disfigured, you couldn't recognize what he was.
 And so she says, Aaron doesn't yet believe in God,
 but he came up here because I asked him to,
 would you pray for him?
 This is my first time to be in church
 after losing my son.
 I had not laid these hands on anyone and prayed for them.
 Since the last person I prayed for,
 I held my son's head, his shattered head in my hands
 and prayed for him.
 And now she brings a boy who tried to blow himself away
 with a shotgun, says, "Would you pray for him?"
 So I looked at Aaron and I said, "Aaron, my name's Jack.
 "Would you like me to pray for you?"
 And he puts his finger over the trach tube
 so the arrow goes through his vocal folds.
 And he says, "Yes."
 So I put one hand on his back and I put the other hand on my left hand on his heart.
 And as soon as my left hand touches his heart, I feel power come down the back of my neck.
 It ripples all down my back down the back of my legs.
 And I don't even have to think about what I'm going to say.
 I'm on automatic pile.
 And I said, Aaron, my son pulled the trigger at Christmas, but he didn't make it.
 God has spared you because he has purposes for your life if you want to fulfill them.
 then Michelle began to sob and she said, "I'm so sorry.
 I didn't know you were the son, the minister who's son,
 who, I'm just so sorry.
 Never would have brought him here if I'd known."
 And I said, "Michael, don't cry.
 This is divine appointment.
 God has made this.
 You've done exactly what you're supposed to do.
 I'm glad to be here right now.
 I'm glad to be with you in Aaron."
 And then I finished the prayer for Aaron.
 And then I turned to her and prayed for her
 and had exactly the same experience happen.
 It's just this prayer from heaven that comes down.
 And I watched them walk away.
 And I just, I looked up to heaven at God
 and I said, "You are amazing.
 Nobody is like you.
 Nobody writes stories like this."
 I mean, I knew what he was doing
 that he was speaking to me in that.
 He didn't take an ounce of the pain away.
 What he did was he came down into the pain.
 And it was like he said, "I'm here with you.
 All of this has a purpose.
 And you stay with me and I'm gonna give you power
 to help the hopeless.
 I'm gonna give you a new story.
 It was just, it was one of the most amazing experiences
 of my life and that's what we found God doing
 in those days, not coming into the pain
 but not taking it away.
 We still had to feel every bit of it
 and still had to walk through it.
 And about, I wrote all this down, wrote their last name down
 and then about five years later someone said
 were on Oprah. So I looked at Oprah shows online. I couldn't find them. And just before I finished
 this book, I found them. And Aaron has become a believer. Oh, come on. No, he is talking to
 churches. His face looks so much better. Now he's had many more surgeries. They live in Austin,
 Texas. That's wonderful. That's like, wonderful. Yeah, it's like, God, you're amazing. I mean,
 You're just absolutely amazing.
 And we had those kind of experiences.
 That was the most dramatic, I think,
 but we had those kind of experiences over and over.
 And people told us in those first weeks,
 and they meant to be kind,
 but they said, "You'll never recover from this."
 And what they were trying to say,
 they were trying to tell us that they understood
 this was the worst pain a person could ever go through.
 But saying, "You'll never get over this."
 I flinched when I heard that.
 I didn't want to believe that that one reckless act of my son
 would emotionally maim us for the rest of our lives.
 So about 10 years after he dives, 10, maybe 11 years,
 it's his anniversary of his death,
 which December 27th, I'm sitting there
 and I'm riding an update to people.
 Lisa's recovering from the strokes that she had in hospital
 and this was 2013 probably.
 And I'm watching her and she's not, she's watching TV.
 She's oblivious.
 And I'm thinking, I don't feel any pain.
 It's his anniversary.
 And then I'm thinking, when's the last time you felt any pain?
 And I can't remember the last time I felt any pain.
 And it's like all the sting of Scott is gone
 and nothing but the sweetness remains.
 The sweetness of his life with us
 and then the sweetness of the reunion
 that I'm looking forward to.
 And I thought, I've been healed.
 I couldn't tell you the time. I couldn't tell you how it happened. But Lisa will tell you the same thing today that we are completely
 healed and people ask us to talk about his death and they say I want to bring anything up and I go
 I have not lost a single detail of his death. I remember every single thing, but there's just no pain with it. There's no
 Sting with it. God really has redeemed our pain because you went through the pain. Yeah, you didn't try to avoid it
 Yeah, which requires
 incredible bravery I
 i think one of the saddest things for me about reading your book and it's incredible for a number of reasons not least the levels of.
 Transparency and vulnerability that's uncommon especially for christian leaders to go through.
 The thing i think that made me sad was the loneliness i felt with you going through the book and the loneliness that you must have experiences a child as a young adult growing up and never really knowing it.
 What was it like going through the awakening to the loneliness the sadness the emotions or the emotional realization that these people that i love,
 i've actually been distancing them by my own best efforts or by my own ignorance you know listen to your wife explain.
 These are the ways you hurt me how did your heart respond to that was there any defense mechanism that kicked in or by this point where you just be in black and blue.
 No, I think the worst thing for me was hearing from my wife when she got in a safe environment
 and was protecting by those counselors.
 The one thing that's true of me, I loved my wife.
 I fell in love with her the day I saw her and when she spoke, I heard that sweet, gentle
 voice I was done for.
 I mean, I kept cautioning myself saying, "Hey, this is love at first sight.
 This can't be true.
 Be careful."
 And my mind kept hurling warnings at my heart.
 I've always loved her and always thought she was unique and one of the best persons one of the most spiritual persons I've ever known
 But I've been unkind and I've been angry with her not meaning to be
 And then to hear in front of that group
 Where where she took a list of things?
 that covered a period of years and
 Read them out loud to me if that was I think that was a pivotal point in my life
 that had been some other guy, I would have said,
 "That's the biggest jerk in the world."
 And I wouldn't have counted on someone else,
 but thinking how sweet she is,
 and how could I be that insensitive?
 That was probably the turning point
 that made me soft enough to be willing
 to start taking a look at that.
 And the other thing I was doing,
 by this time I was starting to pursue God
 to become friends with Him,
 as opposed to being a good servant,
 as opposed to doing things will help me have a better life.
 I was pursuing him in order to make my ultimate pleasure in him,
 to feel his affection for me.
 So those two things together,
 actually showing me how I had hurt her.
 And then pursuing God on the other hand,
 it's like opened up a door for him to begin to speak to me
 about that whole area of pain and loneliness
 that I had harbored in my life for so long.
 I'm curious about, I think I know the answer to this, but I'll be interested in your perspective.
 I'm curious, partly because of culture we live in,
 aging, I live in Grace Center, we have an amazing church culture.
 The place is a high value on two things, one honor and one confrontation.
 So we live in an environment where as staff, as leaders, as people in our community,
 we can't go too far without being confronted.
 And what confrontation would be like, hey, Jack, can I just have a sound
 Can I tell you how I experienced you this morning?
 We had the interchange.
 Man, you felt really angry.
 And like, can I talk to you about that?
 And so there's a high value on receiving feedback.
 And I know some of the people that you've walked with,
 some really powerful people,
 did nobody in your life ever confront you
 about these things or like your anger or your pride,
 your unteachable spirit?
 Nobody ever said, hey, Jack,
 can I, hey, that felt really harsh.
 Did anybody speak to you?
 Or was everybody just enamored
 with your gift and backed away?
 I think I got a lot of passes.
 But when it did happen, it was like, you know, said it was like,
 I'm not angry.
 You're just over sensitive.
 You're not really listening.
 And then Wimber and I had some knockdown dragouts behind the scenes,
 never, never in front of people.
 And Wimber is not afraid to confront, uh, but that, but even there,
 you know, I fought, uh, somebody as powerful as Wimber.
 He's one of those powerful people I've ever known.
 And do you think that was just from your own wounds with, with a father?
 Why didn't you listen to a father like John?
 And that's a great question
 because he was a great father.
 And, you know, I've had two great spiritual fathers.
 I had three academic fathers,
 but John was a great spiritual father.
 And then in part of me,
 my heart was so tender toward him,
 but there was another part that was really defensive.
 I remember one night,
 I was debating a very, very well-known prominent theologian
 in front of 500 of his students.
 Basically, most of the seminary had turned out
 for the debate.
 And so John and Lisa and I drove together
 and John was in the audience.
 And this guy assumed, this professor assumed
 that I was like typical charismatic,
 that I believed everybody could be healed
 if you had enough faith,
 and that everybody should speak in tongues
 'cause this is the key to spiritual life.
 And so he was shocked when I didn't believe those things.
 She's a little bit derailed because he,
 because the arguments he came loaded for, he can't use now.
 'Cause I'm already saying, no, I don't believe that stuff.
 And then he made a critical era,
 critical biblical era.
 And I thought about it for a second
 and I thought I could do with him.
 I could go for the jugular vein or I could win a friend.
 And probably two or three years before that,
 I wouldn't have been able to pass it up.
 But I watched John answer questions so many times,
 and he never got hooked and the anger of his opponent,
 he was always kind to every person.
 I just, I would be furious sometimes,
 but I watch his kindness.
 And so I just thought, I'm on a win a friend,
 and I passed on it.
 And after the debate,
 the whole place erupted in applause.
 Everybody was happy with it.
 It was like both sides won.
 And the professor asked me to come to his class,
 to lecture to his doctoral students,
 master's students and I did that for a number of months after. Well, anyway, we're riding home in the car.
 And John says, "You were great tonight, Jack." He said, "I'm so proud of you. You were kind."
 Wow. I fought back the tears because I was being like my father. I was like, that's really
 what I want to do. So he was really a great spiritual father. And there was a part of me that could
 Respond to him like that and want to be like him and there was this other unhealed defensive part that like
 I'm gonna stand my ground here and get angry and
 There's lots of stuff in your book that is really sad
 The bit about john and you and the fact that you
 You two split for four years. That was a bit I
 Cried out loud when I read that there was something about that the grief the sorrow of this
 incredible
 connection between these two people and the brokenness of never being
 fathered or not knowing how it would be a son or not knowing how to
 parent. I was just like, that is a tragedy. And the day that you went to
 repent to him, that so moved me to tears. What was it? Yeah, that got you
 there. Yeah. See, John's father left on the night he was born. So he's like
 me, he grew up without a father. He grew up with serious father wounds and he
 grew up poor. And then the church mistreated him when he went to work for the church. I
 mean, he didn't have money to get his kids teeth fixed and that sort of thing. So he
 had significant anger issues and he could be really cranky with the staff. Never cranky.
 That's the word you use, not critical. Never cranky with an adversary in public. But behind
 the scenes, he was like me. He carried a significant amount of unhealed anger. And he and I never
 clashed in public. It was in front of our wives behind the scenes. I mean, there were
 only spectators this would have been our wives. And sometimes it was just me and him. And
 both of us, I think it was because of the unhealed anger in our lives. So we split up.
 And I was about three years after we split up. I was on top of my mountain in Montana,
 I was praying and I see this vision of me being unnecessarily provocative to John.
 And I just say, Lord, was I really like that?
 And that over the next few days, I saw this stream of really ugly scenes pop up where
 I was being ungrateful, unnecessarily provocative to John.
 And so I called him and I said, John, I'm going to be in Southern California and a week
 or two is okay if I come by and see you.
 He goes, "I'd love to see you, Jack."
 Carol opens the door and takes me into the kitchen to see John.
 And he's in a wheelchair.
 He's had a stroke, a heart attack, and had cancer.
 And he's confined to a wheelchair, probably
 for the rest of his life.
 And he's got a bucket in the wheelchair
 for the son predictable nausea, where he'll just
 throw up without any notice.
 And his cheeks are kind of a little bit
 hollowed out and the sun shining on him.
 but he's got that same jovial expression
 that he has where he looks like he's about to crack a joke.
 And I said, John, we haven't spoken for three years,
 but neither of us has said a bad word about the other.
 And he looks up at me and he smiles and he says,
 yeah, Jack, we've been very disciplined on our bitterness,
 haven't we?
 I just broke my heart.
 I mean, nobody could use humor and go to the heart of an issue like John could.
 Right.
 And he's just confessing for both of us.
 And so I just start pouring out my heart and saying, John, I've been supremely ungrateful.
 I unnecessarily provoked you.
 There were a thousand young men that would have given their right hands to be your right
 hand and you chose me.
 And I just came here to ask you to forgive me, not just for the way I left, but for ending
 our friendship.
 And he said, "Yeah, Jack, but I hurt."
 And I've raised my hand and I stopped him.
 And I said, "I don't want to hear it, John.
 "You would never have hurt me
 "had I been a grateful son."
 And that was as far as I got before
 I fell at his feet and started crying.
 And he put his hand on my shoulder and said,
 "I forgive you, Jack."
 And then we stayed together for a little longer.
 And I walked out of the house and I felt lighter.
 I felt like something left me.
 And I think some dark power did leave me
 that day because of the anger, the unforgiveness,
 in the ingratitude.
  </li><li>Well, it's the foothold, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, it was a foothold.
  </li><li>We gave the enemy a foothold.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And we're warned not to do that.
 And it's the very things like bitterness and rage
 and malice and unforgiveness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And a month later we were on a TV program together
 and a week after that he was dead.
 And I went to Anaheim for the funeral
 and they asked me to ride a tribute.
 And I set up in the hotel room,
 trying to write a tribute and I just started bawling
 and I couldn't stop my tears, washed away the ink
 and I just shook and sobbed and sobbed
 and wished I had another chance.
 I wish, you know, I was just,
 I'm never gonna see him again.
 I just, how could I have wasted the last three years?
  </li><li>It sounds like you had emotions,
 but probably not on your terms.
 As in it took an overwhelming amount of emotion
 to get over the dam that you'd build up,
 either through crisis or sorrow or pain,
 it would break through.
 Were you comfortable with that?
 Like weeping or you could just dry yourself up
 and then other.
 No, no, no, I was actually comfortable with that.
 I mean, it felt good.
 'Cause you're getting rid of something
 that's been pinned up inside you.
 It felt good, but I wasn't paying attention
 to what was really going on.
 I wasn't thinking about my feelings
 and relationship to my friendship with God.
 And once I had a category for that and started praying every day to feel the affection of Lord,
 I don't know if I cry every day, but I probably cry every other day and especially in private with
 the Lord. And it feels so good. I mean, I feel this affection more than I've ever felt it now.
 And that's my basic message to the church, to pastors is the number one thing in life,
 is to feel his affection.
 When I make obedience to number one thing in my life,
 that's when I'm least obedient.
 But when I make feeling his affection,
 then things just seem to fall into place.
  </li><li>If obedience is your goal,
 your outcome is either self-satisfied,
 Phariseesum or deep disappointment,
 'cause you're not gonna be able to do it.
 The difficulty with connection is,
 you have to be prepared to feel your own feelings
 before you can feel his.
 Yeah. Yeah. And that and we're we've been out of trained out of that or reluctant to do it.
 Yeah. I think one one easy way. I'm totally on board with what you just said. I said,
 I think one really easy way to express it is when obedience becomes the number one thing in our
 life, we have two outcomes, either depression or delusion. Yeah. That's good.
 Yeah. Ferris East, they diluted themselves. Yeah. It's amazing that the tools, the very
 sophisticated tools we develop in early childhood to keep pain out. We discover later in life
 are the very walls that keep love out too. Yeah true. It's the same area of your heart
 where you feel sadness and disappointment and shame and guilt. It's the same area you feel
 love and gladness and connected and hope and yeah you can't love if you're not willing to feel pain
 because that but love is taking a risk and there's nobody you love that's not going to hurt you in a
 significant way. So I was thinking this morning that there's, you know, there's people from
 all different places in the world and all different kinds of church backgrounds that listen
 to our podcast. And some of them maybe like I was like, I got saved Baptist and I was
 telling you a bit of my story about, you know, when I the first time I sort of encountered
 the Holy Spirit and ended up on the floor, I wasn't sure why I couldn't stand. I wasn't
 why I was laughing and I didn't know how to make the leap or understand anything that was happening to me.
 And I just wondered if you had any thoughts or encouragement for people that might be in a place of
 I want to connect with the person of the Holy Spirit, but I'm a little bit afraid about that because I've been told
 crazy stories or to be wary of him.
 Yeah, it makes sense. I think, you know, people fear
 Number one, I mean, people fear that if I really get close to God,
 he's going to make me do something I don't want to do.
 Right.
 So or here's another common one you hear.
 Once you make it to your mind, you're going hard after God.
 You paint a big bullseye on your back for the devil.
 Yeah.
 The devil is an equal opportunity hater.
 Right.
 He doesn't wait for just he looks for openings, not people that are going hard
 after God.
 I mean, the safest place in the world is the closest place to Jesus.
 Right.
 And that even includes a cross.
 Yeah. The thief on the cross next to Jesus, we'll see him in heaven.
 Yeah. That was the safest place in the world to be. That was the one place,
 if you wanted to get saved that day, that was the one place to be right next to the one who saves.
 So that's a total lie, but you hear those kind of things and the devil uses it, I think,
 to keep us from taking risk. And God really is going to offend your minds. I mean,
 that is, he's just going to do that. So we learned to put our trust in him,
 not in our intelligence. And part of the ways he offends our minds, he does things in ways we
 don't expect. I mean, I never expected to believe in healing. I was a satisfied seminary professor
 and I didn't, I wasn't pursuing healing or anything like that. And then there are physical
 manifestations that happen throughout the history of the whole history of Scripture,
 where the Holy Spirit does things to people like knocks them down on the ground. I mean,
 I mean, Jesus stands up in John 18,
 and the people coming to take in prisoners say,
 he says, "Who are you seeking?"
 And they say, "Jesus of Nathras."
 And he says, "I am He."
 And that's the Greek for ego and me.
 That's the name of God, I am.
 And when he says that, they all fall down on the ground.
 And John doesn't stop and explain it.
 He just has them all fall down on the ground.
 I mean, they're in the presence of the creator of the universe.
 And sometimes in his presence,
 we have physical manifestations.
 And all these things have happened throughout history,
 and they've happened in famous revivals
 like The Great Awakening in the 1730s.
 Generally speaking, people say Jonathan Edwards
 was the greatest theologian ever.
 He preached two hour sermons in a high pitch voice,
 long, intricately reasoned,
 and when The Great Awakening happened,
 people would writhe and fall down on the floor and scream.
 Some people were transported to heaven.
 Some people had experiences of hell,
 And there was no way that was emotionalism
 because he wasn't emotional.
 That was the Holy Spirit pouring himself out
 coming in a way that was offensive to people.
 And I love what Jonathan Edwards says.
 The Boston minister said he was a tool of Satan
 and they said, you know, those signs people falling
 on the floor and riding, that's not God's a God of order,
 that can't be God.
 And Jonathan Edwards, I'm paraphrasing him,
 but here was his argument.
 He said, when that guy fell on the floor, was riding,
 than motionless for 24 hours.
 He was a God-hater, he was a drunkard,
 and he was a wife-beater.
 When he got up, he loved God, was in the church all the time,
 never laid a hand on his wife except in love,
 and never had another drink.
 He goes, that is not a work of the devil.
  </li><li>No, exactly.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's not maybe not the way we would have done the work,
 but he said, but you don't look at the package
 in which the work comes, you look at the fruit.
 If the fruit is good, then whether you're offended
 with the package or not, is irrelevant.
 That's the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So that's what I would say to people.
 You are, God is going to offend our minds.
 I mean, He's offended by me and He'll still do that.
 It's not like you get over this one time
 and but He does it in order to say,
 what do you trust?
 Do you trust your intellect or do you trust me?
  </li><li>Right.
 Yeah, and in the end, He gets to be God, doesn't He?
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 Oh, and he, oh, here's another good one for us pastors.
 He will take a pastor without a seminary education,
 maybe even with bad grammar and give him a huge church.
 Yeah. And so we guys sitting over here on the side are going, well, I don't know about that.
 That's that search deficient in this deficient in that. And it's just jealousy.
 He's just he's a it's a fence to our minds. Yeah.
 Jack, the last question I have for you is your book, even in our darkness.
 It is an unusual book for the reasons we've mentioned before.
 But perhaps most unusual is it's marked by graphic content in terms of the subject
 matter, but also the some profanity in there.
 You don't shy away from talking about sex masturbation things that most Christian authors don't highlight
 I'm interested to know what was the what was the conversation like with your publisher when you sent your first draft
 Because when you speak you were very courteous to your audience, you know
 You'll often say blankety blank when you're talking about cuss words in the book there. They're just written out in print
 What was that like yeah? So I didn't write this book for Christians
 I wrote it for people who don't know the Lord and and so I don't want to sanitize it because peak non-Christians
 We'll read a Christian book and they'll just toss it away or they won't even get past the past prayer
 It just it doesn't speak to their life. It's just it's so sanitized
 It does it's not real and so those fraudulent. Yeah, so the first thing I wanted to write a book
 Then that an unbeliever a non-church gore
 would pick up and
 Not be able to put down for the beauty of the story and so that that's the reason that I wrote
 But what what you could call graphic, so I didn't think I was gonna get a Christian publisher
 So Zondervin approached me and said we we hear your writing. We want to we want to see the copies of it
 So I go okay, I'll show you what it's like buckle up
 So I sent him I sent him a copy of
 Even in our darkness of parts of it and then I sent him a copy of a second book
 I'm writing which has to do with the stuff I wrote while Lisa was going through his strokes and and they
 They wrote back and they said we love this but these are super powerful stories
 You're a powerful writer when we want to publish this and I said I'm not taking the profanity out
 and they said well well
 There's some Christian bookstores that will not even take a book if it has a single profane word in it
 and that's well
 I'm not writing to the the people that are offended like that and I'm not writing to those bookstores and
 And finally they said we believe you we think the integrity of the story demands you tell it like it happened
 And so we're gonna suffer a little bit on the Christian audience and but we want to
 We want to publish so that wasn't easy for them and we fought over a few
 passages I have
 One well, I'm not even too
 I have there's some passages in there with some sexual scenes that we kind of that did tone down a little bit
 But it's still right plenty in there and and unbelievers are reading it and coming to the Lord
 Which is just beautiful. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, I mean
 Young young people and then there's a friend of mine gave it to his 90 year old 91 year old father-in-law who is an
 unbelieving
 Episcopal and he gave him copy the book. He's an assisted living so my friend went back a couple days later and saw the book on the
 Table and said hey, how'd you like that book? And he said you know I hate religious books
 But I couldn't put that damn thing down
 You get me a couple more copies. I got some friends here. I want to give it to
 91 years old awesome you need down the back of the dust jacket
 Right, so we're finding it's finding an audience and all ages 14 year olds girls
 So I'm we're really thrilled with that
 I'll put a link in the show note to the book. It's called even in our darkness a story of beauty in a broken life
