<p> I'll in an age is but got more Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is welcome to episode one ninety of keeping up the Jones is worth this week I smell like fire.
 No but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the importance of stillness we need to talk about how good I smell right now okay.
 You do smell very fire like and manly.
 I know we've been camping.<br/>
 We almost literally just got home.<br/>
 We got home.<br/>
 Couple hours ago.<br/>
 There's something glorious about loading up all of your stuff and taking it to the woods.
 We're going to talk about that later, but there's something so I don't know,
 permissive about being stinky and smelly.
 Like I haven't showered in two days.<br/>
 Lucky me.<br/>
 No, but I smell awesome.<br/>
 I smell like dirt and suit and fire and smoke and bacon.
 So what did you say?<br/>
 Suit you smell like a suit.<br/>
 No, it's like suit.<br/>
 S O O T set.<br/>
 That's what I'm sorry.<br/>
 I smell like fire and it's green and I look like absolute trash.
 And I think that's what's great about camping.
 Everyone does not look on their a game.
 Yeah, it's simple food and nobody's dressed up and everybody's just have it a nice time.
 It's queen that what you refer to as food was basically a bag of Doritos.
 So when you say, you know, it's simple food, we basically fed our kids hot dogs, hot dogs and chips.
 And I can't imagine another realm on which you would call that food.
 Well, I did feed them waffles and bacon for breakfast.
 Oh, then my point is.<br/>
 So, you know, it's pure health food all the way around.
 But it's glorious. We've got a couple of weeks to catch up on.
 We do because we didn't record a podcast last week.
 We didn't. More on that in a second. Yes.
 So rather than go through a week, I just wrote down some of the things we've done in the last two weeks.
 OK. So our students came back from outreach
 and they shared about their time away and in the nations with S.O.S.L. and with Gray Center.
 Yeah, it was awesome. Listen to them.<br/>
 They were in seven different countries.
 Yes. Is that right? Yes.<br/>
 Seven different tips. Yeah.<br/>
 It was amazing. I just listened to them and I was just thinking back to years and years
 and years ago when I was a school teacher in Edinburgh and the Lord would give me prophetic
 words about traveling to the nations and prophesying over people. I just had no grit. It's not
 like I didn't believe him. I don't think it was just I don't know how that's going to happen
 or what that would look like. And as I'm listening to our students give feedback, the Lord was
 like, "Hey, remember all those words? Isn't it great that not only I taught you how to prophesy,
 but then you taught other people to prophesy and then they in turn have taught other people
 to prophesy. And I was like, Lord, you're ridiculous. And all of your majesty.
 Yes. That's so cool. It really is. We've had Chris Dupre and Alex and Henry Ceeley from the
 belonging at our school in the last two weeks. It's like to have them. You're mine and then you too.
 Yeah. No worthy is I finished Zelda in master mode. And for those of you like,
 We already know you finished Zelda explain why finishing in master mode is a bigger deal
 Well master mode you start off and all of the bad guys are way harder to beat
 so you're kind of trying to avoid them rather than attack them correct and
 You basically went and did enough shrines and whatnot to get the sword to go coke cannon
 So you said that 100% it you just did the minimum that you could do to make sure that you beat the game
 And you helped me. Yes. Both of us having beat the game. There's an optional master
 mode, which like AJ says, everything's like leveled up and harder. And there's a couple
 of additions to the game that make him more challenging. And so you basically start all
 over from the beginning as if you'd never played the game. But because we have played
 the game, we sat down with a little spreadsheet and worked out how many things we need to
 do this in order to do that and then platter our way around. And it wasn't a cheat guide.
 We just were very, we optimized the game.
 We used our game knowledge to get you to where you could beat him.
 And it just took me a couple of days really, didn't it?
 Yeah.<br/>
 A week maybe?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I have no intention of playing Master Mode.
 Oh, you say that.<br/>
 I'm just not going to.<br/>
 I haven't even 100% of the game.<br/>
 I'm at 52%.<br/>
 I'm proud of you for powering through.
 Thanks.<br/>
 I'm sort of bored at the moment.<br/>
 So I have no motivation other than I just wanted to say 100% so maybe I'll finish it
 eventually.<br/>
 That's nice. I quite like the like when I got to the end of the game where all your collecting is 900 car oxides.
 I quite liked that you were just meandering around the countryside, lifting up rocks and finding stuff.
 Yes, I'm having trouble finding a particular weapon and it's proving frustrating that I have to show to a little boy in a village.
 It just doesn't seem like a good idea in the first place.
 You know, if only you had a bona fide a master of Zelda.
 Yeah, but he's not helping me.<br/>
 He's just like, "Meh." I found them somewhere.
 Maybe if you offer him something worthy of trade, he might give up that information.
 Okay. How about some keto chocolate?<br/>
 We'll talk about adventures in keto later.
 Okay.<br/>
 The reason I spent like fire as you've gathered is it was the emanate camping trip this weekend.
 We went away just yesterday, just yesterday, less than 24 hours ago.
 We arrived at campsite and said everything happened.
 Had a great time. Well done, Erica and Michelle for organizing that.
 Yeah, it was great. I mean, there was about 35 or, I think 35 people there, maybe 40
 emulators, which is fun. Got to meet a bunch of new people. And then we all just hung out
 around a fire and talked. It was great.
 I mostly just looked at a fire all night.
 I know you were in the zone.<br/>
 And people were like, "Are you okay?" I'm like, "Oh, are you okay?" I'm awesome.
 I'm perfectly fine.<br/>
 I'm completely content.<br/>
 I'm just looking at fire.<br/>
 And so our kids are a great time.<br/>
 The thing is when you go camping, like I said, it is that permission granted to be
 grubby and dirty and sweaty and smell like fire and earth and all that sort of stuff.
 But also amusingly enough is our kids woke up at 5.30.
 Well, we all woke up at 5.30.<br/>
 Well, there was like a symphony of birds that were having some sort of party.
 I was like, Oh, shut up.<br/>
 what I woke up to was you and Tia having a conversation and Tia was like, "What's that?"
 And you were like, "That's the birds, do you like them singing?" And Tia goes, "Yeah, I guess I
 like their songs, but they just sing the same one over and over again." I was like, "You are my child."
 -And then I was like, "And Abby and MJ weren't awake yet." So I was like, "Tia, just lie there.
 Just, you know, whatever." -It doesn't work. -That didn't work.
 -So then you wake up and you got, you're the only people on the campground with three children,
 and you're trying to keep them quiet yes but we made the mistake of making bacon and every time mj or five year old saw bacon he would declare a loud voice bacon baby i love me some bacon like and jay

 down to a waterfall.<br/>
 Well, I guess it is a waterfall.<br/>
 I've never seen before.<br/>
 It is water coming out with the side of a mountain.
 Yeah, not mountain.<br/>
 It's a waterfall, though.<br/>
 Right. Well, normally water flows off the top and then right.
 Well, this was coming straight out the side of a mountain.
 Because it springs or something. Yeah.
 It was beautiful.<br/>
 It was really beautiful.<br/>
 We posted pictures on our Instagram feeds if you're just dying to see them,
 which won't be there because it only lasts for 24 hours.
 And by the time this episode airs, they'll be long gone.
 So sad.<br/>
 But it was tremendous.<br/>
 And I was kind of freaked out that we had accomplished so much by 813.
 Right.<br/>
 We've gone hiking down to the waterfall.
 We had gone, stopped at another place, took photos of railways, photos.
 Yes.<br/>
 And we took some photos of like a ruined, it's not really a castle, but something like that.
 A little spring.<br/>
 with a spring and went to play or even went to a park and realized, wow,
 we've done all this before eight, 30 and more.
 I had two of my rings before 9 a.m.<br/>
 I watched and then came home and packed everything up.
 My body clocks through enough because we ate breakfast at what?
 Six and then eight lunch at 11.<br/>
 Eleven. Yeah.<br/>
 We couldn't make it any longer.<br/>
 No, I'm, I'm now starving ready to go.
 But anyway, I had a great time and then came home just claps really.
 Me too I slept for like 45 minutes.<br/>
 I should know that we're recording this on a Saturday.
 Normally we'll record this on a Sunday, but tomorrow's going to be a particularly full day because.
 Abby has her birthday party.<br/>
 Yeah our eldest daughter turns 11 so we have a bunch of girls coming over tomorrow.
 This is going to be loudness and glitter but cupcakes will be my reward.
 And then tonight.<br/>
 I didn't really plan on feeding you a cupcake I should say.
 Just so you know.<br/>
 Yes go ahead.<br/>
 Yes, tonight, tonight you get to go out and celebrate the very wonderful Shannon Macleur.
 I do. I do. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. It was yesterday. I knew that. I sent her a text.
 Yeah, me too. From the forest, texting from the forest. I did like that about this particular
 campsite that we went to that I had signal because the other one I don't.
 But also had Wi-Fi. But I could find the Wi-Fi and running water.
 I know. That was great. So our main topic for this week is the importance of stillness.
 Yeah, last week we were getting to record the podcast on that very topic on stillness. It was
 something like, was it 9pm on a Sunday night? I mean, it was such a long day on Sunday and it
 gets to like, I don't know, 839, we're sitting down for the court of podcast. And I'm gathering
 my thoughts and the Lord's like, "What are you doing?" And I'm like, "Oh, we're going to go record a podcast on on stillness."
 And he's like, "Why don't you be still instead of talking about being still?"
 And so I just stuck my head outside the bedroom door and I think you were in a living room.
 I was like, "Babe, we're going to ditch the episode this week and I'm just going to be still."
 And you're like, "Okay, that's like a great dream."
 I was so happy. I think I had a bath in my Tibet. I was trash.
 I don't know why.<br/>
 Yes, last two weeks ago, how long ago was it?
 It seemed like a really, really busy week.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And anyway, it seemed like a smart step
 that we would actually practice being still
 than talking about it.
  </li><li>Yes, it worked well.
  </li><li>Here's what I was thinking,
 depending on the job that you do,
 you're never likely to be finished your work.
 Like if you have a shift work,
 like you just go in at nine, you go off at five.
  </li><li>Right.
 your work when you end your work is determined when your shift ends.
 Yes.
 But if you have almost any other kind of job, it feels like there's always stuff to do.
 I don't know. I mean, I think every other job I've ever had, I didn't take home with me.
 Like when I worked at National, yeah, there's stuff that you're continuing to work on,
 but you don't take it home. I mean, it's...
 I've never had a job like that. When I was a school teacher, for example,
 there's all the stuff you could do this you know so you finish allocating homework and then you've got lesson prep and
 well when you decide to end lesson prep you could always make lesson prep better and let's say you did finish all your lesson prep and mark everything well then you could work on your classroom and make a better learning environment so.
 And every job i've had there hasn't been a and now you're finished and you have nothing left to do yeah and to my point is if you have a job like that.
 You've got to find a better metric than oh my work is done before I can be finished my work right because of it has to be finished then you never get to rest right or forget jobs.
 Your mom let's say you don't have a job a say don't you're not past anymore mom okay.
 Can you ever imagine a moment in your mom life when you have nothing that needs your attention.
 No, you've all the kitchen you've had the house where you like here you've been your
 changes and then are you then and i'm now done i'm not thinking of improving anything else.
 No,
 well i don't know i maybe maybe depends on personality really well i don't know maybe some people are just like once.
 Maybe they're not looking around and thinking i could do this or i could do that i don't know.
 I don't like a man anybody who.
 Well, maybe that conversation doesn't come up a lot.
 I think I just assume everybody thinks like me like just this week in the midst of our business,
 I was like, man, I don't really need to allocate some time to tidy up our garage.
 Like that's a priority of all the things that need my attention.
 I'm thinking, I should really tidy our garage.
 Yeah, would you?
 Yeah.
 My point is that there's always going to be something that wants our attention.
 There's always going to be an outside source that's wanting our attention.
 And practicing stillness in the midst of that kind of life is what I'm talking about.
 Like stillness is just the spiritual discipline of bringing ourselves to peace.
 Right.
 And it takes actually placing a high value on it to even want to get there.
 Yeah, it's refusing to allow the things that we have to get done to dictate what we're going to
 choose to do with our time.
 right. I think in our life, I just think today, like going camping, if I'm not, if I'm not careful,
 if I open up my email, there's all the email that I do need to get back to. Yes. I forget which one
 it was, the Google guy, it's one of the top two Google guys that says their approach to email
 is they open up their email and they answer whatever's at the top with whatever time that they have
 and then they close their email. I was like, oh my gosh, that sounds terrible. But they're just
 saying there's no way for me to answer all my email. Right. Wow. That's the time to do with being
 stillness. It just popped into my head. Yeah, I think that is one of the things I like about
 camping, babe, because typically there's no internet. There's no, I mean, we sit there after the kids
 go to bed and for a couple hours stare at a fire. And sometimes we don't even talk. We just stare
 at a fire. Right. But I feel like even just going away one night camping, like we had a two day break.
 But I think it's because when you're at home, you're constantly faced with all the things
 that could be cleaner, done better, you know, whatever.
 Need your attention.
 Yeah, need your attention.
 But when you're in the woods, you're in the woods.
 You can't do any of those things.
 So you just slow down and you, again, eat simple foods that don't take an hour and a
 half to prepare and foods again in air courts.
 Yes.
 But you understand what I'm saying?
 Yes.
 Ironically, sometimes you have to work harder to reach stillness.
 Like if you think about the weekend, we were just talking about,
 not even a weekend, we went away for less than 24 hours.
 So you are going shopping,
 you are making the waffles that you're gonna serve the kids
 for breakfast the night before.
  </li><li>Pre-make the food, prep all this stuff, load the van.
  </li><li>Load up the car, go get the kids from school,
 work out with their teachers
 that there's gonna be early dismissal,
 drive two hours, then unload the car, set up a tent, set up a, you know, build a fire.
 Yeah.
 And that's, that's a ton of effort to do what essentially to just look at a fire and then
 go to sleep in a bed that's way less comfortable than the one that you have a home.
 That is true.
 But having said all of that, I feel more still in front of a fire than I do in front
 of a TV at home.
 Yeah.
 Well, I think because you're not, you know, like even if you're watching TV, I don't know
 if anybody else does this, but I think because we have such an understanding of inner healing
 and stuff, I'm constantly even assessing like, they said that, they shouldn't have said
 that.
 Like I know that I know that that is a fictional character, but I'm like, you know, and yeah,
 I have found myself praying for people in movies before.
 And then I'm like, what am I doing?
 This is a fictional thing, you know?
 So I think it's hard to switch off.
 Sometimes watching TV.
 For me, for me it is.
 We're watching a campfire.
 I can completely just zone out
 and watch the flames dance around and just chill.
  </li><li>Oh, it's beautiful.
 And that smells awesome.
  </li><li>No, it smells awesome.
  </li><li>And it's gonna be, you know,
 you think I went and turned into hippie,
 but last night I was gonna bed.
 Now thinking we're effectively sleeping outdoors.
 I mean, there's--
  </li><li>Yes, we were sleeping outdoors.
  </li><li>I mean, we're in a tent,
 so there's a couple of millimeters of nylon
 separating us.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>But I'm just thinking about
 how good is it to be breathing all night fresh air
 rather than recircled air conditioned?
  </li><li>Yeah, probably very good.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But--
  </li><li>We just have to get our bed situation sorted out.
  </li><li>You don't like our bed?
  </li><li>No, every time you roll over,
 I feel like I'm gonna get shot on top of the kids.
 Shut up in the mattress.
 Well, there are these cots that we saw at REI.
 Yes. They seem beautiful.
 They do, but they also seem expensive.
 I'm like, "They do. They do."
 For a couple of times a year.
 Yes, except that we might go camping a lot this year.
 I love your enthusiasm for that.
 You have yet to camp in the Tennessee smuginess that is the summer and the humidity.
 That's why you drive to the mountains, baby.
 You haven't answered anything. It's colder.
 I love it. Anyway, I mentioned this morning that I'd already hit my Apple Watch Target
 two out of three by eight thirty this morning. I looked at yesterday and today I've been
 more physically active than at any other point this year. Oh my gosh. And my point
 is that was a weekend where we went away to be still. Right. So it takes effort in order
 us to be still. Yeah, it does. That's a good point. Well, it's also, I think, the pace of our lives,
 not our lives. I'm talking about the royal we, the royal hour, all of our lives.
 Yes.
 Is it stillness is never going to happen accidentally?
 No, you have to plan for stillness and you have to sort of push things out of the way to achieve it.
 Yeah. I realized, just meditating on the topic that I actually build my week around stillness.
 I have a couple of key events in my week that I practice being still.
 And I've learned that if I have those weeks, I have those like chunks of time.
 I beg your pardon.
 Yeah.
 If I have those key times during my week that I've scheduled that I deserve, I try my
 hardest to not let things get in the way of that.
 Sometimes it happens.
 Sometimes we have guests in or we have unavoidable events that we have to attend to.
 Right.
 But when I can ensure that those key times where all I am in those times is still, man, everything's better.
 Yeah, it makes me think about Psalm 46, verse 10, where it says, "Be still and know that I am God."
 And I think it's true that often we want the latter without practicing the former.
 Right.
 Can I just download an app that lets me know God?
 Right.
 Yeah.
 I don't want the stillness part because stillness is going to take too much time and I'm a busy person.
 But I want to know God.
 I think that's one of the values we both learned in Toronto.
 Wasn't the whole emphasis on soaking.
 Yeah.
 For sure.
 Were you I think it was Peter Jackson said, time spent with time spent with
 the Lord is never time wasted.
 Yeah.
 Like some of the most valuable things you can do with your time is just as being still.
 John Paul Jackson used to say this great land used to say peace is the potting soil
 of revelation.
 And for me, that's certainly true.
 The best revelation I get flows from stillness.
 But it seems so crazy.
 So think about it.
 Like I'm going to be speaking next Sunday at church.
 Yeah.
 And so I'm like aware, okay, I have a responsibility.
 I have to go and teach our church on Sunday.
 I need to get a word from the Lord.
 So one mindset would be, well, you need to sit some time and study and pray and seek the Lord.
 But I found I don't get good revelation that way.
 I find if I actually push away all of that responsibility and say, Lord, I'm going to come be with you as, as I try
 do every week. I'm not coming to be with you to get revelation to teach people. I'm coming to be
 with you because I would view all life flows. And I realize that when I say that yes to being
 still with the Lord and no to the responsibilities that are mounting on me, that when I'm with the
 Lord, He gives me everything I need for my responsibilities when I leave His presence.
 Right.
 Do you ever dream what you're going to preach?
 I have a couple times doesn't happen that often or all i'll see a portion of what i'm saying or my favorite way it's quite fun isn't it feels like cheating.
 I feel like often as i'm gonna bad i'm falling asleep i'll watch myself preach and i'll be like that's a great point and then i'll write down.
 And then i literally use it and i'm too scared to tell people just maybe it's fraudulent where did you get your revelation from napping.
 Being still i think varies from person to person what that means for you what do you mean well i think your environment dictates your ability to be still in that place like i can be still in places where you would feel like it's nails on a chalkboard.
 Write or what would be stillness to me would be painstakingly boring for you.
 Yeah, or what you could be still in our bedroom, even if there was like laundry everywhere where I need to run away and horror.
 What is it they say an unmade bed to a husband is just efficiency and made bad to a wife is horror.
 Yeah, I think yeah, I just can't do it.
 So my ability to tune out of all of our environment and just be still is must be frustrating.
 At times. Well, no, it's good. I'm glad that you can do it. It's just sometimes I actually have
 to escape the house in order to be still in an environment that I'm not responsible for.
 One of the things that always means me when you were writing Finding Father Your Book
 is that you would say, babe, I just need to go somewhere quiet to work.
 Then you would pack up your iPad and you would leave and you'd go to frothy monkey or another
 coffee house and you'd work there and I'd be like, "Hey, I don't want to be like the rocket
 surgeon in the room, but why is a bustling cafe? How is that noisier environment calmer to you
 and quieter than, say, being a home?" Well, what's funny is I guess sometimes a little bit of
 distraction helps me too when I get stuck. So I would put my earphones in so nobody talks to me
 me a universal signal, leave me alone.
 Actually, usually I wrote it the mercantile,
 so it's a little bit quieter,
 or considerably quieter than frothy monkey.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And I would just have refillable coffee.
 And when I would sort of get stuck or ponder
 how I wanted to say something,
 I'd just sort of people watch for a few seconds or whatever,
 and that would sort of help me get unstuck
 and sort of back into what I wanted to say.
 Where if I just sit at a desk in a boring room
 with like no sunlight and just I will write,
 I won't write.
 I just, I feel caged somehow.
  </li><li>And is that the same for you?
 I mean, in that example, we're talking about work,
 but again, that's work flowing,
 your revelation is flowing from stillness,
 but for you to go be still and have a God time, for example,
 what's your ideal environment?
  </li><li>Um, either a clean, quiet place, (laughs)
 if the living room and there isn't anything yelling at me,
 just grabbing a coffee and sitting in the living room is great.
  </li><li>Yep.
 the potential for interruption. I'd rather go someplace and put in my earphones and do it that way.
 I think too, like you're much better at tuning out the kids. I can't do that.
 I have a PhD in that. I hear everything. And yeah, so I think that's partially why it's a little bit
 more difficult for me at home. I think environments do matter though.
 Yeah, they do. Last week was the last week, a couple of weeks ago. We were having our
 connect him with Jeff and so the three of us went off and you guys like your coffee so you were like
 you said oh I really want to go to this new coffee place. You know this coffee is amazing
 I really like this place and so we pull up and I'm not there for coffee because I didn't drink
 coffee and the three of us very sad people pray for him. The three of us walk into this place which
 one of our main name was so they're not dishonored and I can't be in there for like I'm in there
 for maybe 30 seconds and I'm like I'm gonna wait for you at the car. Everything is wrong with the
 environment. Like everything is wrong. Like the music that's playing, the things on the wall,
 nothing is straight. I mean, just everything. Like, look at my nonverbal communication.
 Yeah, he's like crunched into a ball right now. My shoulders are in intention.
 And I just had to leave and you guys were just teasing me and laughing at me. But that environment
 like was just so hostile to me where we could go like, I have, you know, one of my favorite
 hotels in the whole world as a hotel in Sydney, Australia.
 When I go there, I feel so peaceful and so relaxed.
 When we'd be there, I would just love to go down to the lobby and sit in the lobby.
 Again, the environment would be crazy as people moving left, right in the center of Sydney,
 but I would just feel so peaceful in that environment.
 Well, the place you were talking about too, their coffee is phenomenal.
 It's just really good, but you wouldn't know because you don't drink coffee, but both Jeff
 and I were both like, "Oh my gosh, this is so good."
 But it's also the ceiling is super low.
 So I think that's what I feel like when I come in,
 I feel a bit like I'm in the hobbit's house or something.
 So I'm not surprised you didn't like it.
 It's not your cup of tea.
  </li><li>It being low was the least of my worries.
 Anyway, here's the thing.
 Stillness is never gonna come about in your life
 without discipline that you practice.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>There's just no way that you're gonna arrive
 at a place where you can be still.
 I think having practice stillness for many years,
 we find that we can be still or be at peace
 in a number of environments,
 but at least when you're practicing,
 it helps to be an environment that is pleasing to you.
 So we have a five-step process for you to practice
 learning stillness dear listener.
  </li><li>All right, are you ready?
  </li><li>I am.
  </li><li>Oh, good.
 Hopefully they're ready too.
 They're probably like, "Yes, I was ready five, 10, 15
 minutes ago, you."
  </li><li>Are you gonna kick off?
 Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. Number one, set a time to practice stillness. So you're literally going
 to put it in your calendar. Otherwise, it's never going to occur. Right. You're never going to think,
 now seems like a great time to be still. Right. There's never a good time to be still. You just
 make a time to be still. Right. Set a non-negotiable time and say, "This is a time when I'm going to
 practice being still, and it's going to seem foolish because you're practicing in new behavior."
 And I would say make it every week, like try and get a time that works every single week at the same time.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 Number two, in preparation for you being still with the Lord, begin to ask yourself,
 what actually restores my soul? Is it like a lone time or kind of a lone time?
 And what I mean by that is like for me alone time, I just want to be left alone.
 I'll just go to the basement, I'll go to our bedroom, I'll go to our office.
 As long as there's literally no other human being in my eyesight,
 I'm content, whereas you sometimes have to go to a coffee shop.
 You like to be around people, but not interacting with people.
 Yes, I just was giggling because I was trying to picture you in the basement right now.
 Surrounded by boxes.
 I don't care.
 I'm alone.
 And then also think like I was also thinking what manifests your stillness in your heart?
 What leads you to stillness?
 Is it an appreciation of art?
 Is it is an ideal time you have a two hour window to wander around your favorite art
 gallery on your own?
 Well, anybody else?
 Is it food? Is it going to a really nice restaurant? I love being in a restaurant with people I love.
 It's one of my favorite things to do in life. It just brings me to stillness. Do you need
 quiet? Do you need nature? Are you one of those people that needs to kind of wander around outside
 to feel connected to the Lord? Walk around Radner or something like that.
 Radner is a park here for those of you who are like, "It's a lake." Yeah.
 Okay, it's a lake apparently. Yeah, I mean, I think it's so funny because I think sometimes it
 It also depends on mood because I can certainly walk around, you know,
 Radner and, and that being something that brings me to stillness,
 but sometimes just walking around in an art store or craft store or something
 and not talking to anybody and just looking at pretty things.
 I, I, you know, yeah, those things are all helpful.
 Uh, number three, how do you love to be with a Lord?
 Like what environment speaks stillness to you?
 We touched on this already a little bit,
 but it's good to have that sort of discussion with the Lord
 and isolate environments that are good for you
 in terms of connection.
  </li><li>I found that if it matters to me, it matters to him.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like he'll meet us in the place that he created us to enjoy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Number four, what's your favorite way
 of connecting with the Lord?
 So the whole point of stillness is knowing God,
 We still know that I'm God, Psalm 46 verse 10.
 So what is your favorite way of connecting with the Lord?
 Is it reading?
 Do you feel connected when you read scripture or just read in general?
 My mother was an avid reader and she would just sit in a corner and she would read, you
 know, my mother would read books that she'd read before.
 That's probably the same as me playing a video game I've already finished because she could
 just enter into that place and you know, there's no doubt of connection with the Lord in that
 point.
 But is it reading?
 Is it praying?
 We talked about soaking journaling is a big thing for me is it dreaming with a Lord.
 I remember we went through a season where we would scrapbook with the Lord, which sounds
 ridiculous, but we'd forgotten how to dream.
 And so the Lord asked us to go buy a bunch of magazines that we'd go through and pull
 out anything that our heart leapt at and paste it into a little book.
 Yeah, I was really fun actually.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And lastly, Ajijon's number five, practice all those first four things and then review
 what's working for you.
 Um, and then yeah, practice again.
 Yeah.
 And measure the fruit of the stillness and the piece that you're enjoying life.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 So there's some of our thoughts on stillness and your, your five step plan to put into
 practice, to practice being still in your life.
 Let us know what happens to you.
 Let us know the fruit of those exercises we'd love to hear from you.
