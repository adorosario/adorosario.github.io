<p> Hello. Hey cuteness. How are you? I am well. I'm good. I have a question for you. Yes. Did you get to 4 p.m. today and feel like you've been hit by a truck?
 Yes, I did. I just felt like all of my energy flowed out through my toes or something. Yeah, me too.
 I still ran on the spot for 40 minutes this evening.
 You're an inspiration to all runners on the spot everywhere.
 Spot runners!<br/>
 That was about this week.<br/>
 It's been a good week.<br/>
 Yeah, all our students were back.<br/>
 They are, and they were so excited and their stories were amazing.
 This morning our students took over the service at Grace Center and told some amazing stories.
 Yeah, they really did. It was amazing.
 We had somebody get their site restored.
 One of the stories they told you was of a lady getting their site restored.
 restored in Uganda. I think that one was. We had lots of legs getting healed.
 Yeah. And then this morning in our church, a boy who broke his finger last week, at least
 her Sunday, got completely healed. Yeah. And he said yesterday it was completely purple
 and he couldn't move it. And then he got prayer, took off the spunting and his finger was a
 normal color and he could move it completely normally. And no pain. Amazing. Yeah, with
 great test rates of people being brought aside over in Scotland and really really
 we're so tired I can't remember the last anyway it was amazing I'll put a link
 in the show notes to the service and you can go watch it that'll be much better
 for you you get some interesting news I did you have walking pneumonia I do well
 I have either bronchitis and sinusitis or walking on you here's the thing I heard
 that walking pneumonia isn't that bad until it turns to lying down pneumonia.
 So your fault.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 I think that's true.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Or sitting pneumonia.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Basically what happened was I went out with Sarah Parsons and Shannon to hang out on Tuesday
 and I started hacking up a lung and Shannon said, "You've been sick for a while."
 And then as I thought about it, I thought, you know, I thought I'd only been sick for
 like three or four weeks.<br/>
 I realized I got sick in Scotland. So I've been sick for eight weeks.
 I think it's funny that you think being sick for only three or four weeks isn't anything
 to worry about.<br/>
 But, you know, I don't like doing antibiotics, so I figure I'll just let whatever it is run
 its course.<br/>
 It's also difficult to know whether it's...
 It could be viral, could be allergies, could be. And we're so busy. I just didn't notice
 that that much time had passed.<br/>
 So I made a doctor's appointment.<br/>
 My doctor was quite funny.<br/>
 She mocked me a little bit, but she just said, it's either walking pneumonia or
 it's bronchitis and sinusitis.<br/>
 And it's a sinusitis or sinusitis.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 And she said, if I wanted to, I could get the chest x-rays to find out what,
 which one it was.<br/>
 And I said, I don't really care.<br/>
 I mean, if the prescription is the same for both, let's just kill it.
 I don't need to spend more money on X-rays.
 So, I have something, but it's on its way out.
 Meanwhile, you found plenty of opportunity to start watching CSI.
 I did.<br/>
 Hulu has CSI.<br/>
 Oh, every season.<br/>
 Every season.<br/>
 All 14 seasons.<br/>
 So you started with season one.<br/>
 Yes, I've never watched.<br/>
 I mean, I've seen CSI before.<br/>
 I've maybe watched a total of 10.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 You check into hotel, you're flipping through channels.
 Right.<br/>
 watch a sporadic episode here now.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 It's funny watching season one.<br/>
 Cell phones are the carbon dating of television and movies.
 I didn't think about that, but you're right.
 So they're using pages.<br/>
 I was like, I remember pages.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Pages and big phones.<br/>
 And then the Apple Watch got announced this weekend.
 You went and tried some on.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 And I really like it.<br/>
 Well, of course you're going to like it.
 It's made by Apple.<br/>
 I know, but I was kind of hoping that I wouldn't like it that much.
 Well, it's your birthday in November.<br/>
 I know, right?<br/>
 But then you'll be buying an early outdated watch.
 It should be perfect.<br/>
 Thanks, darling.<br/>
 That's very encouraging of you.<br/>
 Speaking of birthdays, it's our seven-year-old's birthday on Saturday.
 You'll be eight.<br/>
 She's very excited.<br/>
 She's having a fashion birthday party.
 And her very first tattoo?<br/>
 Ah, sorry, what?<br/>
 I'm going to buy her first tattoo.<br/>
 Oh, you are?<br/>
 Yes, you're going to love it.<br/>
 her and I wanted her to have the Lord supper and then her manna did did she
 Adilistice question for you. Yes. I mentioned this last week. We had a great question. Oh, are you ready? I?
 Hope so okay, you're taking this one. Oh
 What is your opinion or advice on relationships?
 That one side believes to have heard from God that the other one is the one
 For instance, I have been on again, off again with a guy for four years now who knows that I am his wife.
 My family is also in love with him and believe we're going to end up together as well.
 Our friends say the same. The only problem is I have never felt that way.
 That is a substantial problem.<br/>
 That's a problem, yeah.<br/>
 I guess I still don't know. He's been my only boyfriend so it's hard in that regard, I guess.
 I have been unsure this entire time and it's like I've been waiting to wake up and see what everyone else sees.
 I have said to him, "Why would God reveal to you and not to me?"
 And his response is, "There is lots of examples in the Bible where the Lord reveals things
 to one person and not the other."<br/>
 He says he spent a lot of time in prayer, but I thought that I have too and I still
 don't have the answer that he has.<br/>
 I guess I've always wanted to feel in love, which I know is fleeting, but I haven't
 ever felt that way.<br/>
 There's so much mixed messages with the fairy tale Hollywood and their love is simply a
 choice I don't know which to go with.<br/>
 I know it's not hard knowing any of the details on either of us, but in summary,
 I'm sure years of ministry have come across these kinds of situations.
 Oh yes they have.<br/>
 Plenty.<br/>
 Do you have any thoughts and/or comments?
 Sorry if this is a jumbled mess.<br/>
 Thoughts?<br/>
 I think it would be foolishness to go ahead if you don't know for yourself.
 So here's the deal.<br/>
 You can't get married on the strength of other people's convictions.
 Yeah, you just can't.<br/>
 And in my personal opinion, your boyfriend shouldn't have even told you what he knows until you feel like you know.
 So, or what, you know, what he thinks he knows.
 So because at that point, it's just becomes manipulation.
 And, you know, I just don't think that's ever going to be a healthy thing.
 You know, we've told our story before how we ended up together.
 And I knew when we went on our first date, I knew as Alan read back a list to me that
 I had journaled with the Lord the previous year, word verbatim.
 I knew Alan was the one I never told him that because he needed to just come to decision
 on his own and choose on his own without me influencing him in any way.
 And so I didn't actually tell him until after we got engaged about the whole the list thing
 that he read back to me.<br/>
 And I remember asking the Lord one day, like why he wouldn't tell me if you were the one
 or not.<br/>
 And the Lord said, "Well, Alan, the thing is you need to decide whether you want to get
 married because when things get tough, I don't want you sitting going, 'Well, maybe I misheard
 God.'<br/>
 Actually, when things get tough, I want you to remember that you actually chose to make
 a commitment.<br/>
 Not I would source the decision-making process to somebody else.
 So can God tell a person that they are the one?
 Yes.<br/>
 I've heard many people.<br/>
 But I've also heard many people say, God told me that's the one and then that one goes
 and marry somebody else.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And the thing is, is you can ask the Lord to talk to you about it.
 And if you, obviously you have done that and you're still not in a place where you think
 that that person is the one, then maybe go with that.
 That's really the answer you were looking for.
 Or if your family's going to hunt us down.
 But...<br/>
 And find some pastors.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 in your life and run that by them because they'll know you and have insight.
 But at the end of the day, I wouldn't be making any major decision without having heard from
 the Lord personally on it.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 I mean, obviously we don't know you.<br/>
 It could be that there's something for you that is unresolved, that the Lord needs to
 heal and then you'll be able to hear them about the situation.
 So yeah, go to people that know you and love you and maybe don't have a dog in the fight
 and get them to pray for you.<br/>
 I have another question.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 In a similar ballpark.<br/>
 OK.<br/>
 This is from Casey.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 She says, hi, Alan, AJ.<br/>
 I love listening to your podcast.<br/>
 Thanks, thank you very much.<br/>
 I look forward to listening to them every week.
 And it makes for a great Monday coffee routine.
 My question is this.<br/>
 I am a single lady<br/>
 and a huge desire of my heart is to have a godly marriage.
 That being said, I struggle knowing how to balance wanting God's
 best for me and having unrealistic expectations.
 What advice would you have for future spouse expectations?
 I suppose it depends on what are the unrealistic expectations.
 Are you expecting him to be Superman or an astronaut?
 Are you just saying, Lord?<br/>
 Wait, wait, astronauts are real people.
 Okay.<br/>
 It's unreal.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Superman.<br/>
 I'm just saying this.<br/>
 Astronauts, they exist.<br/>
 There's few astronauts in the world.<br/>
 Have a rocket scientist.<br/>
 Well, they also exist.<br/>
 So I.<br/>
 A centaur.<br/>
 I don't.<br/>
 They don't exist.<br/>
 Because I think there's people that are like, you know, it's unrealistic to think that you're
 going to find a godly man who loves Jesus and will treat you like a princess.
 And I think that that's completely realistic.
 But, you know, I think that's a great conversation, Casey, to have with the Lord and just say, God,
 you know, what do you want for me?<br/>
 Who's the person that, you know, what is this person like that you have for me and start to
 believe him for what he's talking about to you about?
 And I'm sure there's conflicting views on the whole list thing.
 But, you know, I'm a big believer in<br/>
 dialoguing with the Lord about everything because he's made you specifically.
 And you have once and you have desires.
 And I think it's a great thing to list about, to say, Father, you're a great dad.
 Because here's the thing.<br/>
 If my daughters came to me and said, Dad, would you help me pick a husband?
 Which I'm praying they do.<br/>
 Um, but if they came and just said, Dad, you know, would you help me pick a husband?
 I would sit down with them and just say, well, what is it that you love?
 You know, and you know, there's some non-negotiables I'm looking for, but there's a whole
 there's a whole wealth of options that the different models can come with.
 There's a terrible like we're cars often men, men models, right?
 But I would be interested in understanding what they are looking for and what they want.
 So I, you know, with God, it's very hard to have unrealistic expectations with God,
 because he says that, you know, no, I see no years heard nor is it entered in the heart of man, but he hasn't stored for those he loves.
 So somewhere what God has for you is beyond what you can expect.
 So I don't think you're going to out expect God.
 Yeah, and my advice to you would be in the, in the process, don't dumb yourself down either.
 Don't devalue yourself by expecting something less so that it's easier to find.
 That's great wisdom.<br/>
 The other thing I would say from experience, I never ever thought I would find my wife.
 Like in the world I lived in my climate, my sphere of influence.
 There was nobody like AJ Jones or AJ Mail at the time.
 So nobody, there was nobody that even compared.
 "Ah yeah." No, I'm serious. It just wasn't. And so I remember even when I met you, I was just like,
 "Okay, who is this person? Why have they not been snapped up?" So sometimes what happens is we
 plan within the confines of our experience. And this goes for everything, buying a house,
 buying a car, thinking about the job you want, thinking what God can do. We often
 put God in the paradigm of our circumstances rather than realizing that his thoughts are not
 our thoughts and he has supernatural options available to him that aren't available to us.
 So, you know, when I was looking around girls that I liked, the law was like, hey, you're great,
 but you're fishing in the wrong pond. I actually have to move you to a completely different country,
 a completely different culture, and a completely different church environment before you're actually
 going to find what you're looking for. I'm so glad he did that. So am I. So I say all that to say,
 It was unrealistic of me to expect the wife I have and yet he was so good he found her.
 So if he did that for me, he'll do it for you.
 All right, Ajay Jones.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I wanted you to share on this podcast what you shared Monday and I am and because it was amazing.
 Go.<br/>
 Well, we got it Monday morning and as is the norm.
 Well, sometimes we've had this conversation like two days in advance, but we had the,
 "Hey, who's speaking tonight? Are you speaking or am I speaking?"
 And I was like, "Oh, I'm pretty sure you are." And so, you know, you of course were like,
 "Okay, that's fine." And I looked down at my phone and it, you know,
 had just lit up with, "Your time hop is ready for today."
 No, explain time hop to people who don't have time hop.
 Time hop is an app that you sign up to and you kind of link your Facebook and your Instagram
 feeds into it or gives it information.
 And what it does is every day it pulls up this day on previous years.
 So, you know, if it's April, whatever it is today, 13th, then, or maybe it's
 a 12th, whatever day it is, then it pulls up that time hop from all the previous
 years.<br/>
 So it will show me stuff from last year, two years ago, seven years ago, like
 just, it's just fun.<br/>
 I mean, it's really fun.<br/>
 And so I was talking about how I loved it because I love that you can actually see growth.
 Like it's fun watching the kids grow on Time Hop.
 But as I was looking at it, like the Lord started talking to me about what do you want
 your time hop to look like next year?<br/>
 Like do you want a picture to be pulled up of, oh that was the day I raised somebody
 from the dead?<br/>
 You know what I mean? Like, what do you want your time hop to reflect about your life and the way
 you're living it right now? So I was like, wow. So I just spoke a message basically on that. Like,
 you know, he knows the plans he has for us and their plans for good and to, you know,
 prosperous and to give us a future in a hope and, you know, God's heart is for us. And he has
 great plans for us and I think often we're not partnering with even the plan for the day.
 So just sort of talked a little bit about, okay, let's lose guide dream with God. If you could
 have in your time hop a year from now or two years from now, what was happening right now,
 what do you want to see there? And so then I gave people some time to go through and pull down
 images off of the internet. You know, it didn't have to be awesome images just to give the idea of
 this is what I'd like my time hop to reflect and then do like a I called a collage, but is that
 what it is a montage a collage something like that and put those images in it and maybe give some
 indication of what they represented because sometimes images are hard to tell and then hashtag it my future time hop and
 Sophie search Instagram for my future time hop all one word you'll see some brilliant examples like everybody just got to it. I loved it. I love seeing Instagram lit up with that.
 Here's amazing.<br/>
 The people everywhere people who were there we weren't there started doing this little.
 My future time hop.<br/>
 My future time hop.<br/>
 My future time hop.<br/>
 And what's cool is if you sign up for time hop next year, this exercise is going to come
 up on your screen like, "Oh, right.<br/>
 Like this is..."<br/>
 You know, so I was just thinking, "Gosh, I want to live forward and unto the kingdom.
 I don't want to live in the past and we've seen amazing things in the past and we've
 seen God do amazing things and amazing miracles and we've been to, you know, so many countries
 and you know, but my life's not over and there's better in the future. So I want to live unto
 the future and the kingdom of God doing stuff in my life right now. So that's that's sort of where
 I was at. Do you know who's very good at talking about the whole living future forward? Who?
 Graham Cook. Is he? As a whole to teaching on that. Cool.
 Do you know who's also coming to speak our church in about a month's time?
 Who, babe? Graham Cook.<br/>
 You're kidding. No, I'm not totally serious. Yes, he is. If you guys live in the Franklin
 Nashville area or you're within travel distance or if you like Quinn and you live in Scotland
 and you're going to fly over here. Yeah. We would highly recommend you come for the more
 conference held at Grace and her May 15th to 16th. It's going to be awesome. We're going to have
 Graham Cook speak, who's phenomenal. We're going to have Jonathan David and Melissa Helser come
 in lead worship who are also phenomenal. Incredible. We'd love it if you join us for that conference.
 It's going to be a great thing.<br/>
 Go to it musthavemore.com.<br/>
 All one word musthavemore.com for information for tickets.
 Very cool.<br/>
 And then I'll just say if you're listening to this podcast, wherever you are in the world
 and you decide to do the MyFutureTimeHOP thing, after looking at the online examples, can
 you tag me in it so that I know to look at your, I just love looking at them when they
 come up.<br/>
 What's your Instagram name?<br/>
 It's at underscore AJ Jones.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 Under score AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, underscore AJ Jones.<br/>
 I just enjoy looking at them.<br/>
 So yeah, go ahead and dream with God and talk to him about what you're built for.
 He loves to have those conversations.<br/>
