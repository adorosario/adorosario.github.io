<p> Well, good evening, mr. Jones good evening darling. How are you today? I'm bearded
 You are bearded. Let's talk about my beard
 Okay, what about your beard? Let's talk about when you're gonna shave it off
 So I'm sensing from that that you're not a fan of the beard. I'm not a fan of facial hair in general
 Or just me pretty much in general well, it's not I decided to grow beard is that I can't be bothered shaving oh
 What's laziness it's complete laziness but then i get lots of positive feedback but i'm not sure if it's a type of positive feedback of all you made a really bad for life choice well now that i've noticed it i'll just say something nice about it i think it's probably that okay thank you for your encouragement.
 Besides that your daughters they don't like it no they call it pokey.
 I don't like your pokey bits. Talk to them about this week. We had an incredibly busy week.
 Yeah, I'm honestly, I could go to sleep now and it's only eight o'clock.
 Well, don't do that. Finish the podcast first.
 Well, then I need to make all the food for the week and the kids lunches and I'm not going to bed
 for hours. Right. But after that, then you can go to sleep. Yeah. Okay. Perfect. You taught the
 school this week. What was your topic this week? Father, heart of God. Oh, it was really lovely.
 And your highlight of the week?<br/>
 I think from teaching.<br/>
 I had a really fun week teaching.<br/>
 Of course love teaching it, but<br/>
 My highlight would probably be when we do the big ministry time on the Tuesday afternoon with the mother and father hugs and
 Just getting to speak over people and teaching them how to engage with God and now it does sound completely surreal
 But basically what we have happened is we have moms and dads, safe moms and dads from our church,
 coming and after a week of teaching, they want to bless the students as if they were their own
 parents and or stand in the place of God and bless them. That sounds really weird, slightly
 uncomfortable. Yet the fact is it's pivotal and absolutely transformational. It's transformational
 a word. Okay, good. It's absolutely incredible to see the change it makes in students lives
 and the testimonies that we've had from people. Incredible.
 And our own experience. Yeah. But we'll talk about that later. So yeah, that was cool.
 Most very cool. Scotland voted on Thursday. They did.
 As to whether to be an independent nation. And I thought it was funny that I must be the
 only Scottish person that a lot of my American friends know because they were all pulling
 me from my input, which of course, as anyone knows me, it's ludicrous. I know nothing about
 politics. Certainly not politics about a nation I haven't lived in for 11 years or longer than
 yeah 11 years I haven't lived there. So I just honestly said I have no clue what's going on and
 and people were saying you know we're using the pros and cons or I was like literally
 I have no clue what's going on but we're praying and intensely and it turned out that
 it's a no to no they're staying everything stays as is yep so we don't have to worry about rushing
 to get MJ's passport.<br/>
 Yeah, it would be in anyway.<br/>
 Yeah, it's not happening.<br/>
 So I'm not going to devote any energy, mental or otherwise to imagine different scenarios.
 Ask me about my highlight of the week was what was your highlight of the week, baby?
 Wait, let me guess.<br/>
 Listen to each one Sunday.<br/>
 Oh, thanks, honey.<br/>
 That's so sweet.<br/>
 Twink.<br/>
 Twink.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And the true answer is new iPhones arrived.
 Yes, they did.<br/>
 Which was a bit of an adventure.<br/>
 We've got new iPhones a couple of different ways,
 including the wake up ridiculously early in the morning
 to go line up at the mall to get them.
 That is always what we do until this time.
 Right, well that's true actually.<br/>
 Yeah, that is true.<br/>
 Wake up at like four o'clock in the morning,
 go and line up at like 4.30 to get an iPhone.
 That's what we call our system.<br/>
 Where as last week I took a bullet for our family
 and stayed up till 3 a.m.<br/>
 To pre it, when I actually stayed up till 2 a.m.
 But none of the servers were up.<br/>
 That'll wait up.<br/>
 And then even then it works,<br/>
 just went to bed at three and got up at six and ordered them then.
 And even then I wasn't even sure if I could arrive, but way to go, T mobile.
 Come on, T mobile.<br/>
 You drop them off at our house.<br/>
 It was a seamless experience to switch from AT&amp;T, just set up our phones, called AT&amp;T.
 One of set up our phones, called T mobile, said, please transfer our numbers.
 Two hours later, that was done.<br/>
 Called AT&amp;T and said, so long.<br/>
 Thankful.<br/>
 What do you do?<br/>
 Thanks for the fish.<br/>
 Yeah, it's a reference to the obscure book.
 Oh.<br/>
 Um, do you like your phone?<br/>
 I love my phone.<br/>
 It's very pretty.<br/>
 What did you get?<br/>
 I got the six in what color?<br/>
 White and what's my location?<br/>
 White gold 64.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I got the six plus in space gray.<br/>
 Also 64 gig.<br/>
 And everybody's asking me, what do you think of your new phone?
 And here's my, here's my honest feedback.
 It is enormous.<br/>
 It is massive.<br/>
 It is absolutely enormous.<br/>
 I think it might eat one of the children when I'm not looking.
 Yeah, I'm a little afraid.<br/>
 It is colossal, but here's what I realize is I actually use my iPhone as a phone very much.
 And when I do it's in the car over Bluetooth.
 So it's not like I'm holding a giant mini tablet up to my ear.
 Most of the time I use my iPhone as a some sort of communications device, which sounds very star
 tricky. So the screen on it is utterly delightful.
 I mean, it's just wonderful.<br/>
 The weird thing is all my muscle memory in my right hand is used for holding a smaller phone that i can operate manipulate with one hand.
 There need some sort of circus level freakish trickery to be able to operate that phone one hand i think i think i think i couldn't probably do it one handed not because he's a circus freak but because he's six foot seven and has very large hands he has hands the size of my face will have to pull him and see if this is actually the perfect size phone for him.
 So while it's a little weird for my brain and my muscle memory of my hand to not be able to do what i could do with my own phone the screen is astonishing the battery life is amazing.
 And the biggest obstacle i have is none of the apps have been or very few of the apps have been updated to take advantage of screen so it's pretty unsightly.
 When you look old you know layout opportunity to practice patience money update i want to go to my eyes out.
 Oh, wow, that's kind of extreme.<br/>
 Well, I stick to the apps that have been updated.
 Where do you go, Avernote?<br/>
 What?<br/>
 What?<br/>
 Where do you go, Overcast?<br/>
 Where do you go, all of Apple's now?<br/>
 Where do you go, Instagram?<br/>
 Instagram has not updated themselves.<br/>
 Well, it's working just fine.<br/>
 What?<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 Fell to the screen.<br/>
 Can I just show up a little bit in my life?
 Does it not?<br/>
 It does not pick so perfect.<br/>
 No, OK.<br/>
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 You use a jennapel's knob.<br/>
 Maybe you should give your phone back.
 OK.<br/>
 You also spoke at church this morning.
 i did talk to that because you did something you know normally do i did something i have never done prophetic dance and a prophetic hip hop rap amazing.
 I was not an invitation for some involuntary beatboxing.
 You've asked hamsters to the vod guest i was that you did you.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Wow, wow.<br/>
 You can stop, please.<br/>
 I need to take lessons from Tink,<br/>
 so I can get some sound effects down.<br/>
 How did your sermon came about?<br/>
 Well, basically, in the month of August,
 had a series of dreams.<br/>
 All of them about revival coming to Grey Center
 and uncapping wells and that kind of stuff.
 And I sort of was--<br/>
 I've just been praying and thinking they're mostly for me to encourage me blah, blah, blah.
 And then the morning that David Wagner came to speak during worship, the Lord said to me,
 I want you to go to Jeff and tell him you have a word for the church.
 That's always comfortable, isn't it?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 It's one of your core values, self-promotion.
 Right. So something I've never, ever done.
 Give me the microphone.<br/>
 Feels awkward. And I mean, obviously we have an enormous amount of relationship with Jeff.
 Right.<br/>
 But I just didn't really want to do that.
 Besides that, I was like, Lord, I don't know that I do have a word for the church.
 And he said, you do.<br/>
 And I want you to, you know, go and chat with him.
 So I was like, oh, so I stalled for about eight hours, no, probably more like 10.
 And then I finally called him Sunday evening and just said, um, I'm fine for you to say no, but, uh, this is what I felt like I was saying and has to do these dreams.
 and I explained the dreams and whatever and he was like yeah I think it's important and
 you know let's get on the schedule. So that was just like two or three weeks ago and so we
 scheduled it for today. I thought you did an awesome job, babe. Thank you. We'll post a link to
 it in the show notes so if you want to watch AJ on YouTube and hear a message which I encourage
 you to, it's pretty stinking awesome. Thanks babe. We have some listeners questions. We have one
 from Sweden. This is Sarah or Sarah. I apologize if I pronounced your name wrong. Sarah Sarah said,
 "Hi, I live in Sweden and our election day is today, September 14th. This week. What is your view
 on political opinions as Christians? I struggle with elections as people seem to be going all
 kinds of ways, accounting it to their faith. Should I just ask God about it? Also, do you think
 church should be outspoken politically. Thanks, love your podcast.
 Well, over to our political correspondent, AJ Jones.
 Thanks, darling, for just lumping me in the midst of that.
 Oh, I think it's really important to vote. I think it's really important to research
 who you're voting for and what they're going to stand for, because later on, typically,
 We tend to complain about government.<br/>
 And if we didn't actually stand up and vote and do the research,
 then I think we shouldn't be having an opinion in the first place.
 That might be a bit of a strong way of putting it.
 If I could get you out of the hazy fuzzy stuff and just tell me what you really think.
 So, I mean, I think, I don't think you can force your opinion on one another,
 but do I think churches should be outspoken politically?
 I don't know, but I think they should educate.
 I think if there's stuff coming up that maybe the average person wouldn't know about or wouldn't
 hear about and would want to know in terms of voting and it's either biblical or not biblical
 or whatever the deal is, yeah, I think it's church's responsibility to educate.
 The flip side of that was out of conversation with somebody actually in Scotland last week
 about their response to voting and they said as a Christian they didn't believe they should vote.
 Why?<br/>
 I don't know. I had a hard time wrapping my head running and then you get to the bottom of it.
 But basically they said they'd rather pray than vote.
 But why can't you pray, ask the Lord what to vote for and then vote?
 I'm not sure.<br/>
 I don't hold that opinion.<br/>
 I was just kind of taken aback that that actually is an opinion.
 Gosh.<br/>
 I'm not sure if this is over simplistic, but it's kind of like me sitting on the sofa
 going, I'm really hungry and I could go fix myself a sandwich.
 But instead I'll pray that a sandwich would happen.
 Yeah, I guess I feel a lot stronger about voting than that.
 Right.<br/>
 So I don't know, Sarah, I don't know how it went down in Sweden.
 Hope it was great.<br/>
 We love your country.<br/>
 It's amazing.<br/>
 We have a thing going on right now with Yes on one.
 And so there's going to be three amendments on the ballot in November.
 This is for Tennessee.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And Amendment one is an amendment to bring the standards for abortion.
 back up to what the national standard is. So basically, Tennessee standards are way lower
 than what the national standard is. So like with the
 Roe v. Wade and all that kind of stuff, there's certain, you know, laws that say you can't abort after a certain time.
 You have to educate the person who wants to get an abortion.
 Parents have to be notified if they're minors.
 Abortion clinics should be regulated.<br/>
 abortion clinic should be regulated in Tennessee and really they don't honor any of those.
 So they don't have minor doesn't have to have a parent involved.
 They don't have to be given informed consent.
 Nobody tells them this is actually what's going to happen.
 This is what's going to happen to your body.
 This is what's going to happen to you afterwards.
 There's no waiting period.<br/>
 There's no regulation of abortion clinics.
 I mean, they can be holes in the wall.
 So Amendment 1, voting yes and Amendment 1 says yes, Tennessee should be brought back
 to the national standard.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 But we didn't know any of that happened until somebody at our church spoke about it.
 Right.<br/>
 So there's an example where we were completely ignorant of that and somebody came and brought
 that to our attention.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So that's super helpful.<br/>
 It is super helpful.<br/>
 It was an interesting thing here in the United States and I don't know enough about a such
 postion comment, but a 501(c)(3), which is the charitable status in the States, there's
 some guidelines on what you cannot and cannot talk about from the pulpit.
 But I think it's pretty clear cut.<br/>
 I think you can share your opinion, but you can't tell your people who to vote for it.
 I should look into that and clarify next week.
 Next question we've got is from our good friend Chad Walbrink.
 Hi, Chad.<br/>
 And Chad, we remember the time that you cooked his dinner.
 You cooked amazing dinner.<br/>
 You did a awesome job.
</p><ul>
  <li>So yeah.
  </li><li>I'm a Cisco.
  </li><li>Vegetables.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I love you guys.
 Oh, thanks.
 Ellen mentioned getting things done by David Allen.
 That's a book in the episode on planning.
 Do you all use GTD in your own work and life?
 And what does that look like for you guys?
 Well, I would say that like anything,
 you read something that sounds absolutely awesome
 and then you put it into your life
 and you work out the kinks
 and you come up with a version.
 And then you realize, oh, my version isn't as good
 the version I read in the book, I should reread the book, which is probably what we're
 due for. But we do have an inbox for everything in life. So we have an inbox for our mail.
 It's right beside our door. So if we walk in, our mail goes there and the inbox goes there
 and we sort it out later that week and then we decide to action it.
 We have separate inboxes for all of the kids, right? For whatever forms might come in for
 them and that kind of stuff.
 That's right. So keep all the school stuff. So anything out of the school folder gets
 dumped in the inbox, so we always know where it is and then we action it or delete it.
 Same with our email, same with our to-do lists, same with people that want to get with us,
 they just go into kind of a holding pattern and then we evaluate that.
 Charlene, our assistant, our wonderful assistant manages that part for us.
 I used to try and do inbox zero with my email, which is where you try and reply to an email
 if you can, if it takes you less than two minutes.
 Otherwise it goes in one of three folders, an action folder, a reply folder, or a save
 folder.
 I am behind on that.
 So yes, we do use GTD in our life, but I think we're due for an upgrade and an overhaul
 on that.
 I probably read it at some point.
 But you'd love it.
 It's a shaper's dream.
 I thought when he said GTD was that thing where you take a test and then you don't have
 to finish high school.
 So, you know, I should probably actually focus and perhaps read the book.
 -They on target. -Stay on target.
 -All right, our discussion topic for this week.
 -Yes.
 -Possibly my most favorite topic in the world.
 -Apple products? -Nope.
 -And...
 -Sex? -Nope.
 -So I'm not sure what's your favorite topic then?
 -The father's love. -Oh, see? That's a good topic.
 -It is an amazing topic. -I think everybody else is probably thankful
 we're not talking about the first two ex-jist.
 though I did think we need to do a podcast episode on sex.
 We probably need to work out what we're talking about and who we're aiming at.
 Yeah.
 But anyway, say that for another day.
 Yes, not today.
 I'm looking forward to the tweets on that one.
 Oh, gosh.
 So what is that about the father's love?
 Talk about this.
 Talk about that.
 Because I was writing an article for the website on them soaking, actually.
 And as I was writing about, I was talking about my revelation, the father's
 love and where I got it and how the revelation, the father's love seems to
 completely misunderstood until you get it. My case in point is Jack Frost, who's one of our
 just amazing father in the faith. He's now with the Lord who helped bring me the message of the
 father's love and I know it's instrumental in bringing it to you and through Toronto as well.
 I remember hearing him in Edinburgh and at first it was called a Father Loves You Conference.
 And I was kind of like, why would you need to go to Father Loves You Conference? Surely everybody
 knows that God as a loving father loves you. Like, what am I going to learn for the whole
 weekend? And then I went and it kind of chiseled away at my head and then finally got to my heart
 and I was like, oh, and then, you know, in the ensuing months, I began on stand where everybody
 was excited about, but then faced the same problem when people would be like, what are you so excited
 about? I have a revelation that the father loves me. I'm like, well, duh, don't you read the Bible?
 Right. So talk to me about what was it like for you to not get it because of course you have an
 interesting history. Well, what I mean, the dynamic that you're talking about there is the
 is that verse, you know, it's one of my favorite verses, 1 John 4 verse 16, which says,
 "For we have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us." And a lot of us
 mentally know, you know, for God so loved the world, you know, but there's a process of
 knowing and then believing.
 And when that information that's in your head actually makes it to your heart, that's
 when you're believing and you know you believe something when you live like it's true.
 So I would say, you know, for me, it was a really long process.
 It was about a probably 10 or 12 year process before I actually started living like it was
 through living, expecting that the father knew what was going on with my life, not panicking
 the same way I used to panic about things, knowing that I'm not alone, you know, all
 that kind of stuff. That was a long process because of the amount of confusion and trauma
 around my dad and just growing up and him dying and all that kind of stuff.
 One of the truths that we've discovered is that your image or your perception of
 God especially the father is actually
 Manufactured for you through your own
 Interactions with your earthly mother and father or authority figures. Mm-hmm. So without thinking about it
 It's most common
 That you will have placed your experience with your father even if you didn't have one or no one
 on to the father.
 Well, yeah, for example, if you didn't have one or no one,
 then often you don't relate to the father at all because he's just not
 something that you have learned to relate to in the first place.
 Or if your father is
 really diligent and hardworking, but had no time for you at home,
 then you begin to just place out and go, well, yet God is obviously
 seriously.
 He's very busy and he's got things to do.
 But he has no time for me and I shouldn't bother him with my problems.
 Right.
 And yet the glorious message of the gospel of the kingdom is that Jesus came to reveal the Father.
 He came to restore relationship with the Father.
 I don't know how I missed that.
 I missed it too. I think a lot of people miss it.
 Was it James Jordan who said, "Jesus came to down the way the truth and the life?
 For Jesus to be the way there must be a destination?"
 I think actually that was Jack Winter, but...
 Was it Jack Winter? Well, but you know, Jack is...
 They all sort of ran together, didn't they?
 And that's amazing.
 For Jesus to be the way there must be a destination.
 Yeah.
 The destination is the Father.
 Yeah.
 And I don't know if fathers are...
 I would imagine that there's a small population in the world who've had amazing fathers and
 the issue of fathering isn't a problem for them.
 But for most people, we have an unhealthy view of what Father God is like.
 Right.
 in to understanding what he's like and what he wants to do for you is I would say the most exciting
 and most wonderful experience somebody can have.
 It's so super important. I think it was Graham Cook that said what you believe about the father
 and what you think that he believes about you will determine everything that you receive in life.
 And it just does. It affects your expectations. It affects your hopes, your dreams, your ability
 you to hope and dream. You know, your outlook, you know, it just affects everything.
 I think it's to the foundation upon which you do everything in life.
 Right.
 I remember Jack Frost. I remember one time here in Jack, it was one of the first times I'd heard
 him speak. And he opened with this line. He said, "Many Christians think that the cross of Jesus
 Christ is the foundation for the Christian faith, but it's not." And I remember thinking,
 "You're heretic."
 You're looking for stones.
 I'm looking for stones.
 Like that's an outlandish statement to say.
 And he said, it's not the foundation.
 It's the foundation that Christian faces the father's love.
 And I was like, man, we're getting off kilter here.
 And he said, would you like a verse for that?
 And of course everybody was like, yes, we want a verse for that.
 Before we stone you.
 Yeah.
 And he said, John 3 16, for God so loved the world that he sent his only begotten son.
 The reason Jesus came was rooted in the love of the father.
 elsewhere, Paul, quoting Old Testament, reveals the heart of God all along, I will be a father
 to you and you will be my son and daughters. So live in as a son or live in as a daughter,
 changes everything. And so the way that we prophesy in the way we approach healing
 the sick and the way we approach and running with everybody is from a place of knowing
 that our daddy loves us and our daddy loves them. I think that helped me understand that
 for prophetic ministry.
 Because you know that the father wants to say something.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 We know that like whoever's standing in front of me, Jesus, well, the father's
 already sent Jesus to die for.
 So he's already given his most precious gift to them.
 So he will absolutely give me revelation about that person to reveal the father's
 nature, which is a wonderful doorway into the prophetic.
 That's amazing.
 The foundation, the prophetic should be a revelation of the father's love.
 I would say.
 Absolutely. Well, the foundation for any kind of supernatural activity,
 you know, whether it's healing the sick or prophetic or, you know, whatever it's...
 What did it look like for you to not get the message?
 Did you think you already had the message and you couldn't understand what everybody was so excited about?
 I was totally... I was aggravated. I am... I remember when I first started going to
 TACF, which was, you know, then TA-VCF because we were a vineyard church, but
 You're now talking 91, 92.
 They just all they spoke about every single Sunday, somehow the message of the Father
 Heart of God was woven into the message.
 I remember about a year and a half in feeling so frustrated one Sunday morning because I
 think there was a guest speaker and I thought, "Oh, thank God, there's a guest speaker.
 They're not going to speak on the Father Heart of God."
 Which is funny, any time you're reacting like that to a message, it probably means that
 you actually need to hear it many times because you're still not getting it.
 But I was just like, move on from that.
 You know, and anyway, he started reading.
 I think he started talking about something in Leviticus and he was going to be speaking
 on healing.
 But then he ended up father-harding us and I was so frustrated that I remember just sitting
 there through the whole service, like pretty close to tears, feeling really frustrated.
 And then at the end of that service, I had gotten to point where I was crying.
 And so I was just like, okay, Lord, everybody is so excited about this.
 And I don't get it.
 I don't get what they're so excited about.
 But clearly I don't get it.
 So would you help me?
 Like would you help me to get it?
 And that night was the first night that I had a dream about the father's house.
 Talk to him with that dream because I love that dream.
 You do.
 I love it.
 How many times did you have the dream?
 Seven times.
 Same dream.
 Same exact dream.
 Seven times.
 Over about two years.
 Yeah.
 Tell us the dream.
 In the dream, I am running up to the Father's house and I have keys and there's a whole
 bunch of other youth with me, all people I knew from church, that were running up to
 the Father's house as well.
 For anybody who's interested, the Father's house kind of looked like Dublin Castle,
 this large and square.
 Not like the Apple store Manhattan, a class.
 Strangely no.
 Okay, that's a new Jerusalem.
 Yes.
 Continue.
 So we run up, I get to the door first and I put in this massive key that I have and
 we all have keys, but I put in this massive key and I swing the door open and we run inside
 and just as we come in the door, you know, there's a hallway straight ahead and there's
 spiraling stairs up to the left, but to the right there's this room and it's a gorgeous
 big room and it's got big pieces of furniture and there's a fire and there's
 mahogany on the walls and it's painted red. I mean it's not the mahogany the
 rest of the wall but it's this gorgeous inviting room and
 there's games set out like board games and stuff and I love board games.
 Anyway, just saying that.
 Thank you.
 Thanks, darling.
 So anyway, everybody runs in there.
 There's about 40 of us.
 Everybody runs in there.
 But I want to go and find the father.
 So I say to everybody, "Hey guys, let's go find him.
 Let's go find him and then we'll come back and we'll play games with him.
 Let's go find him."
 The youth that were with me for the most part, there was four people that came with me.
 other than those four. They're like, "Oh, AJ, just chill." He put out this games for us.
 He put out the hot chocolate for us. You're so intense all the time. Relax. He wants us to have
 fun and whatever. I was like, "Well, yeah, but I want to be with him. I want to see him first."
 And they were just like, "Well, we'll be here." We were like, "Okay." So I took off and went up
 up the spiral staircase and my roommate at the time was Lucy. Her brother's name was
 Paul and he was with us. My cousin Janna was with us and this guy Darren who was a friend
 of Lucy's. I think they just started dating. And so, you know, I ran up this staircase
 and as we came to the top, you know, it was all black and white upstairs. There's no color.
 But I knew which room was mine.
 We all had rooms and I ran to my room.
 The reason I knew which room was mine was it was the only one in color.
 So I ran to this room and it was a bright yellow room, painted bright yellow.
 And the only thing that was in the room was a bed and it was really high off the ground.
 There's no furniture of any kind other than the bed.
 And the window was open and these white drapes were blowing.
 And as I ran in the room, I kind of did like this matrix thing and flipped midair and landed
 on my bed.
 And I was like, Oh God, this is so great.
 And for, you know, a fragment of a second felt very comfortable and like, Yes, this is
 where I belong.
 And then a voice had to me find the king.
 And I was like, Brilliant, I'm going to find the king, you know.
 And so I jumped down off the bed and I ran out into the hallway.
 And again, it was black and white.
 And I heard the voice say again, let the sun in.
 So I ran to the far end of the hallway that I hadn't been to yet.
 And I went over the window and I threw up in the window.
 And as I threw it open, what looked kind of like liquid gold came in through the window
 and started creeping up the walls.
 And all of a sudden everything was in color, you know, as I threw up in these different
 windows.
 And when I had run towards that window in the first place, I had run by Lucy and Darren
 and I had run by Jenna and Paul and Jenna and Paul were in a room together and they were
 leading worship like they you know Paul was playing a guitar and Jenna was playing a keyboard
 and in the other room Darren and Lucy were like feeding young children and interacting with like
 homeless people and stuff and I was like oh that's interesting anyway so once I let the light in
 I started coming up the hallway throwing up in every window and I went in their rooms and threw
 up in the windows and once the windows were open I could see they were still doing the
 same thing but they were on massive beds as well.
 And there was no furniture.
 I didn't really understand that part of the dream until much later, you know, about intimacy
 and that kind of stuff.
 And then I kept going until I went up these three steps into the father's room.
 And I knew it was the father's room.
 And the window wasn't open in there yet so the colors were very almost black and white.
 a really muted I could see it could possibly be a blue or purple type of color. But I
 went over to the window and the window was so high that I couldn't reach it. And so,
 you know, I jumped several times and I couldn't get to the window and I just kind of got frustrated.
 And then the window opened all by itself and this light flooded into the room and it was
 this bright blue gorgeous room and there was a veil around the bed and again there was
 only just this massive bed in the room.
 I went to the end of the bed and when I reached up my hands above my head, the tip of my finger
 still was only half the height of where the top of the bed was.
 Wow.
 It was such a massive bed.
 Of course, I could see these drapes around it.
 Again, I tried to jump a couple times and I realized there was no way I was going to
 make it. So I just reached up my hands and I said, up Papa. And when I said that, it
 was like something, you know, when you pick up a small child and you kind of flip them
 over onto a bed, like it's, yeah, you do, you do with him. Something did that picked
 me up and flipped me onto the bed right through the veil. And when I was on the bed, the father
 was sitting on the bed and he pulled me into his lap and he started laughing and then I
 started laughing and that's where the dream ends. But the first time that I woke up having
 had that dream, only the first time, I could hear God audibly laughing in my room for about
 10 seconds. And that was the moment that I went, you're real. And you're happy, which for me,
 I realized I'd never thought he was. So that's sort of where the journey started. And really,
 for the next two, two years, two to three years, the Lord would every day or two give me a new
 verse about his heart towards me and he would unwind the things that I had thought about him and the things that I
 have believed.
 You know what you want to do?
 What?
 You want to write down all your thoughts and all your verses kind of like
 intricate.
 He's of maybe like 12 week study guide that people could work through so that they can get their own revelation.
 The father.
 You think so?
 I think he should.
 Darling, I have news for you.
 What's that?
 I did do that.
 I did do that.
 You're so funny.
 Oh, that's right. In that book that you wrote called Finding Father. I noticed that the first two chapters of that book are exceptionally well written.
 Really? Do you think so? You have somebody guess right? I did have somebody guess right. I'm thinking they're probably very handsome and very humble and very hairy with a beard that needs to be shaped, but very cute.
 Yeah. And all seriousness, you did write a book called Finding Father. I did. Yeah. And it's a brilliant book. Thank you, darling.
 And what I love about it is it's written so perfectly for somebody like me or like you where
 initially you're kind of left brain and you're like, yeah, that sounds really lovely and emotionally
 alive. I don't relate to that. And it's written really small bite-sized chapters. There's enough for
 one each day and you just kind of work your way through it. And you, I don't know, I love it. I
 think it's amazing. There's also, you know, the first two chapters, one chapters on, you know,
 soaking and connecting with God and the other one is on hearing God's voice, which is what
 we talked about last broadcast, how to hear God's voice and what are the tips.
 What are the exercises to do every week?
 If you have not got a copy of this, and I know this is my wife and she's sitting in
 the same room with me, but I wouldn't hardly recommend something.
 I don't hardly recommend, but I really do recommend a copy of ages book finding father.
 If you live outside of the United States to get a paperback copy, it's quite expensive
 because of the shipping. But because we're geniuses, you can get it for your iPhone or your iPad or
 your Kindle. Because you're a genius. Please don't know. You're making me blush. But I digress.
 But I digress. But yeah, you can get it on your Kindle. You can get it on your iPhone. You can get it on your iPad. If you are an attention to detail person and love beautiful typography, and you love beautiful rich multimedia, there's an enhanced edition prepared, especially for the iPad.
 We'll put links to all of these and our show notes, but you could not do yourself a bigger
 favor than being kind to yourself, buying a copy of this book and working through it
 and getting a revelation or a deeper revelation of the Father's love for you.
 We get such great feedback from people who wrote it.
 In fact, just today, we had somebody come up and said, "I've read it for the second
 time," and you could know it's a visible difference in this person's sanctinence and
 in their personality.
 What we'll put a link to that on our site.
 The other thing I want to mention is we have,
 well, we've had this for a long time,
 but we haven't really done anything with it.
 We have an email list that I'm not a huge fan of email,
 but recently I've been receiving email from a website
 that I really, really, really like.
 It's made me think,
 oh, I wonder if we could do something as helpful as that.
 If we promise you we're not gonna spam you,
 we're not gonna plague you,
 but we have started an email list.
 We've seen that maybe one or two emails a month
 And we want to start giving you exclusive access to content
 before it appears on our website.
 And so if you haven't already joined our email list,
 just go to alanaj.com, scroll to the bottom of the first page,
 and there's a little form that you can fill in.
 Again, you can unsubscribe anytime.
 We are not in the interest of spamming you,
 but we do want to cultivate an audience
 and connect with you and send you content that's not
 available anywhere else and exclusive content
 and give you up-to-date information on what's going on.
 The other thing, speaking of stuff that's going on is we have a conference happening
 at Grace Center, October 23rd to 26th, called Heaven Declares.
 It's going to be amazing.
 Our dear friend Artie Kendall is going to be there.
 Who's one of the finest theologians in the world.
 And he's so funny.
 And then two of our favorite prophets, John Paul Jackson and Bobby Connor.
 If you want information about that go to heavendeclares.info or look for the show notes on our site.
 I'm not afraid of about that.
 Yeah, that conference is going to be amazing.
 We keep hearing from different people that are having dreams about stuff that's going
 to happen at the conference.
 So we're super stoked about it.
 So I hope you can come if you're close enough to come.
 Yeah.
 And if not, we will be having a live stream of the conference too.
 We'll give you some details about that later.
 Before we leave, Ajay, would you pray for everybody who's listening right now, for our
 revelation of Father's love?
 Yeah, Father.
 Wow.
 Papa, you are so good.
 And Lord, I ask for every single person who's listening to this podcast right now, God,
 that you would just show up wherever they are, Lord, whether they're driving or working
 out or just listing at work or whatever, that they would encounter you, they would encounter
 your love and the reality of your presence.
 What I ask that you would take them on a journey just as wonderful as the one that you took
 me on into your heart, into understanding how love they are, how precious they are, the
 good things that you have for them, Father.
 I asked it would be marvelous and that you would be so real to them that they would realize
 that that reality changes everything.
 I thank you for what you're about to do in Jesus' name.
 Amen.
