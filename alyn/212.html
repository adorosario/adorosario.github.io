<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 212 of Keeping Up with the Joneses.
 The first episode of 2019,
 AJ Jones, how the heck are you?
  </li><li>I'm really good, thank you.
 I'm a little cold.
  </li><li>We'll explain why that isn't a second.
 We are doing things a little differently this episode.
 I will be interested to see if our regular listeners can tell what is different.
 We'll tell you what is different at the end of the episode.
 Oh, that's tricky.
 Wow.
 We've been off the air for three weeks, I want to say.
 Yeah.
 I think it's been about three weeks, uh, fill everybody in on our Christmas
 and New Year.
 Christmas was amazing.
 We had nearly three weeks off.
 And so we spent most of that time in pajamas.
 Literally, I probably got dressed maybe four days
 out of the three weeks.
  </li><li>I don't think it was that many.
  </li><li>The rest of the time I was in my pajamas all the time.
 I remember when you were--
  </li><li>And the kids, in their pajamas as well.
  </li><li>I remember at one point you were like,
 babe, when was the last time you showered?
 And I was like, I'm just enjoying being in pajamas
 and you're like, yeah, the rest of you aren't.
 Tia actually said to me, daddy, you smell.
 I was like, what do I smell of?
 She was like tuna fish at that point.
  </li><li>That's a bad sign.
 At that point, I knew it was time to have a shower.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So recap on what, I mean, we,
 obviously we're just in pajamas for three weeks.
 We literally saw nobody.
 We had some friends over for Christmas day,
 but the rest of the time, family, video,
 taught me through Christmas presents.
  </li><li>Christmas presents was really fun.
 You know, the kids got sort of their normal lego-y thing.
  </li><li>Did your husband knock it out the park?
  </li><li>Knocked it out the park.
 That's what the podcast listeners are waiting for.
 Did he not get out of the park? He did. Okay. Do you want to talk about what you ended up with? Yes, I got a Canon
 60 mark to what is that to people who don't know anything about? It's a it's a camera body
 my previous digital camera body is
 15 years old
 Not under about 15 at least
 So it had like six megapixels and just no
 features basically was the first digital body that they released.
 And so this is the updated body.
 The thing does everything probably cook me eggs if I gave it eggs.
 It's great.
 And you were, and you were exceptionally generous to me.
 Because you bought me.
 Unbeknownst to me, I was exceptionally generous to him.
 You bought me an iPad Pro.
 I did.
 I was a keyboard.
 I didn't even know I did.
 I'm not the pencil somewhere else.
 It's true.
 Yeah.
 Ask me how I like my iPad Pro.
  </li><li>How do you like your iPad Pro?
  </li><li>I really love it.
  </li><li>I was sensing that.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm trying to switch over to using it full time.
 And I have a laptop, which I wanna just try
 and leave chain to my desk to do all the heavy lifting.
 The only problem I can't fully replace my workflow
 with an iPad Pro is Keynote.
 And this is only gonna appeal to a small subsection
 of the podcast.
  </li><li>Sorry.
  </li><li>But I use Keynote almost exclusively
 at probably every single day that I'm teaching,
 I'm using Keynote.
 and keynote on iPad versus keynote on Mac OS
 is crippled in one particular way, which really affects me,
 which is when I'm presenting,
 I can't have this slide, the next slide,
 and the presenter notes all at once.
 I've emailed Apple, I've asked them to update some software
 'cause a massive screen,
 I should be able to fit everything on.
  </li><li>It should work.
 And I have to say that there is part of me
 that is happy that it hasn't worked for you either
 because you were trying to convince me last year
 to take just my iPad on some speaking engagements.
 And I was like, no, because I don't like the way keynote is.
 And so.
  </li><li>Come on, Apple, software updates for the win.
  </li><li>Please.
  </li><li>What about our new year?
 What did, I don't even remember new year.
 What are we different?
  </li><li>We went to bed early.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>We were--
  </li><li>Rockin' that mid 40s lifestyle.
  </li><li>It was like 9.30 and we're like,
 wanna go to bed?
 All right, let's do this.
 Yeah, we went to bed early.
 But I'd had the stomach flu.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, you had.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You have to plague.
  </li><li>Well, that was a weird thing.
 I spent a large portion of the Christmas Eve
 in separate bedrooms.
 Talk to me about that.
 Is it wrong that I really like that?
  </li><li>Well, you know what we need?
 Podcast listeners, I need your help.
 I need you to leave comments or something and tell me
 where do you stand on this?
 'Cause this is our ongoing debate
 and you know what I'm about to say.
  </li><li>I do, that's why I have tuned out.
  </li><li>So here's the deal.
 Some people like to be touched.
 when they're sleeping.
  </li><li>That sounds creepy.
 Let me say.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I get into bed.
 I wanna fall asleep cuddling.
  </li><li>He wants to fall asleep cuddling.
 Like him touching me, but we're just sleeping.
 We're not doing other,
 not special cuddles.
 It's like, you want me to fall asleep
 while something's going like this.
  </li><li>I just wanna like, no.
  </li><li>No, no.
  </li><li>Fall asleep.
  </li><li>I don't wanna be touched.
  </li><li>You don't wanna be touched.
 I can't even fall asleep with my arm on him.
 No, in fact, if he does, I just wait from to fall asleep, which it's really obvious once
 he does because, you know, noise.
 And I just, it drove it on his side.
 That's not true.
 You don't even let me do that.
 You're just like, "Get your hand off me.
 Get your hand off me."
 You're a freak of nature.
 And she's convinced that she's normal.
 I am normal.
 There are other people that it's like, you know, it's, we can do all of our wonderful
 married activities but then don't touch me.
 I just want to say we're playing badminton.
 (laughing)
 Are you talking about sex?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Okay, I'm not talking about fall asleep having sex.
  </li><li>I know that.
  </li><li>That would be the worst sex ever.
  </li><li>Listen, I'm not saying anything.
  </li><li>I just mean, I literally just want to snuggle up to
 if we fall asleep and you don't even touch you.
  </li><li>I want some sort of taser lying down the center
 of the bed because some people take over the space
 on the bed. They don't keep their head on their own pillow, their arms and legs are
 everywhere. I just want my space.
 So yes, please give us your feedback, married couples. Am I the freak or is I
 the freak? That's probably the worst research to do. Did you make any New
 Year's resolutions? I did. Oh, I don't even know these. Well, I didn't really.
 Okay, that one. I made a resolution not to make a resolution. Actually, here is
 here's my thing. I think every year I make resolutions like I'm an exercise
 regularly or I'm gonna eat a certain way I'm gonna do whatever and then you
 know you start the whole 30 and it's the whole four and hold two and a half
 four. What are you talking about? So I was like I don't want to do that I think
 so I just had a conversation with the Lord about my heart and I thought I
 I actually want this to be the year that I'm the most thankful.
 So I want to work on thankfulness and having a thankful heart
 and that I gain his perspective more quickly.
 Because I think it's really easy to get stuck in my own perspective.
 And then I want to be quicker to trust.
 Like if the Lord asked me to do something to just know,
 he's asking me because he's going to back me up and just go ahead and do that.
 rather than have the debate, the internal debate.
 So I'd like, they're all internal things
 rather than external things.
  </li><li>If it sounds like there's a herd of wildebeest
 and elephants on the rampage,
 that's because our kids are running around.
 I'm not quite sure why,
 but I don't want our podcasting to be a limitation
 on them being kids.
 So I'll try and edit their noise as much as possible,
 but if you can hear that, that's why.
  </li><li>If they start having a real party,
 we might just go join them.
  </li><li>Turn the hose on them.
 Wait, that's all right.
 Don't call child services.
 Our topic this week is kind of related to New Year's resolutions.
 But it's all about vision
 and the importance of having a vision for your life.
 Here's what I was thinking.
 I've been teaching at the school the last couple of weeks
 and I realized that when I teach the students,
 I remember it was like being in the seats
 listening to somebody teach.
 And when you're a teacher,
 you tell everybody your best testimony.
 So I'm 44. I've been a believer in Jesus since I was seven.
 So for 30 plus years, I've been walking with the Lord.
 And I realize that when I'm teaching, I'm telling everybody my best story,
 your highlight reel, highlight reel.
 And the danger is if you're just listening to somebody like me,
 you're going to be comparing your normal with my highlight reel.
 And I was thinking, I'm sort of thinking about that.
 I'm trying to explain to students, hey, you need to understand that.
 It's not every day I have an angelic visitation.
 every day. I'm not dreaming all the time. I'm not hearing the voice of the Lord every single day.
 The large portion of my life is made up of everyday life, just like everybody else's.
 Normal interaction. Right. And we try and explain that when we have new staff come on, when we have
 interns, they probably come in imagining what our life looks like and are kind of astonished to see
 that most of our life is made up of mundane, ordinary paperwork or admin or meetings.
 And I don't know what they were thinking, but try and explain why you have to have a vision
 so that the mundane, ordinary source of things propel you to your breakthrough moments.
 So you're not just living life or breakthrough, you're living life for everyday life.
 Right.
 That's what I mean by vision.
 So,
 AJ Jones, take us away.
 So I guess my thought is, I think,
 I don't know who said it, but
 I've heard Alan say it a couple times
 the whole thing of vision gives pain a purpose.
 I stole that from Alex Seeley.
 Henry and Alex Seeley who passed the belonging
 were speaking at our school, and I overheard them say that
 and I was like, that's a gray line, so that's where I stole it from.
 Yeah, I think, I mean, last year we sort of,
 we envisioned to be the most generous that we've ever been.
 We envisioned to do things like get out of debt.
 And I think vision actually helps you know what direction
 you're heading in and stay on course,
 even when circumstances are difficult or, you know,
 on the days when you just don't feel like doing anything,
 you have vision that propels you to continue on,
 like to just keep going.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause if you don't have vision,
 you're left with your own brute force strength.
 And for me, brute force strength does not last very long.
  </li><li>Do you remember Patricia King gave us,
 didn't just give us, she came to our church,
 she gave us four amazing, prophetic words.
 You can smile at your future.
 God will greatly bless your seed,
 a thousand fold return in one year.
 And what was the fourth one?
  </li><li>I think it was a hundred fold return, wasn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, a hundred fold return in a year, that's right.
 And...
  </li><li>I can't remember, we took them and wrote them up on our mirror,
 on our master bathroom mirror.
 And so we would see them every morning,
 but we would also stand there in our bathroom
 before we would leave for work when we were getting ready
 and we would just hold hands and declare
 those four things over that year.
 And I would say, I can't remember what the fourth one was,
 but I remember--
  </li><li>There was something similar.
  </li><li>You saw it.
 Like we, it helped our hearts stay focused
 on what we felt like we were hearing from the Lord
 and what we wanted to see happen.
 And that's what vision does.
 Vision helps you get there.
 But also when your world reality contradicts your vision,
 you have something to fight back with.
 Like you can smile at your future.
 There was times when we would get up
 and like especially with our financial future,
 we were like, okay, our bank account is saying one thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Wait, we have this word from the Lord.
 It's written on our mirror.
 It's of the wallpaper on our phones and on our laptops.
 No, I'm gonna declare this.
 So you were talking about New Year's resolutions.
 I wonder if half the time New Year's resolutions fail
 is because we make New Year's resolutions
 without first having a vision of what they're on to.
  </li><li>What is it accomplished?
  </li><li>Right, so if you like take budgeting for example,
 budgeting for budgeting sake is good but it's hard.
 But budgeting with a purpose in mind,
 with a vision in mind, be that a vacation
 or getting out of debt or saving up to buy something,
 you have a vision in mind,
 you have something to head towards,
 it gives pain a purpose.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I also think about the longer and longer
 I walk with the Lord, the more and more I am saddened
 by the number of people who are no longer walking with me.
 I mean, I meet new people all the time,
 but people I've been walking with for years
 who just fall away from the Lord.
 I think it's because they, part of it
 is they don't have a larger vision.
 So they have all these prophetic words,
 but they lose sight of the prophetic words.
 They don't keep them before them.
 And then they use their prophetic words
 as ammunition against the Lord.
 like, "Well, you said you're gonna do this and you haven't.
 So peace out.
 I'm out."
 Rather than going, "No, this is where I'm heading."
 And like today is paying dues for tomorrow's vision.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yes.
 I wonder too, if it has anything to do with their vision,
 not having anything to do with the body of Christ.
 'Cause I think for us, no matter what our vision has been,
 whether it's been generosity or growing in the prophetic
 or what it's been all, you know,
 we want to bless the body of Christ.
 And so if being part of the body is part of your vision,
 you're probably not gonna step away from being part of the body.
 I just wanna do that.
  </li><li>Tell me that again.
 So if your vision is larger than just yourself.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you're serving somebody rather than yourself.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What happened to that?
  </li><li>Well, I think your vision has to be larger than you
 because most people actually aren't that motivated
 to just do something just for themselves.
 So if your vision, which our vision is about blessing the body of Christ and about equipping
 the body of Christ.
 And so no matter what the nuances are of different things that God's talking to us about or
 different areas, it's all going to be within the re-ment of within the body of Christ.
 We want to see this happen.
 And I think that keeps you connected, therefore, into the body of Christ, which keeps you in
 community.
 And I think it helps with a lot of that stuff.
 Let me ask you this.
 Can you think of a time in your life where your vision kept you focused, where there was
 opportunities to be distracted?
 My thought is, I guess the one that comes to mind quickly is in '94 I had all these
 prophetic words about traveling the world and administering and stuff like that.
 But the reality of my life was that I was waiting tables or working as a photographer
 and it didn't look like that is what life was gonna look like.
  </li><li>Right, so doing nothing like what your profanity words say.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>And then in addition, I ended up getting married,
 then I ended up getting divorced.
 And I thought I was kind of disqualified
 from being used by God.
 And then in, I guess 97,
 I was going for this interview with National Car Rental
 I was interviewing with the president and the vice president and it was strange because
 I don't remember thinking about it before I went in.
 But when I went into the interview, I remember saying to them, I have a word over my life
 that I'm going to be in full-time ministry.
 So I'll promise you five years.
 But I don't think I have much past that because I feel like I'm going to be in full-time ministry.
 I've always said, yeah.
 Do they have a grid for that?
 Well, they did and they didn't.
 They sort of like nodded their heads and stuff and afterwards the VP pulled me aside and started asking me questions about what I believed because
 he was a
 Indian guy and
 his sister had just gotten saved in India and like
 Sold all of her. She was a lawyer or something sold all her stuff and opened an orphanage. So he's like I need help, you know
 So I guess it wasn't totally shocking, but yeah, I
 But even at national like there was some really
 tough seasons working under some very interesting people and you know whatever but
 My heart knew this this isn't the end of the story, right?
 so I had vision that this changes at some point so I can give my hundred percent here and not have to worry
 That this is all it is I
 remember being you have told the story many times I remember being a school teacher and
 No, I wanted to be a school teacher, but fell out of the Lord that asked me to be a school teacher
 And so at the time that was the vision for my life like okay Lord
 Let's just settle this debate if you want me to be a school teacher
 Then I will be a school teacher for the glory of God and that vision
 Gave pain a purpose like when I'm like ah, why am I like signing these? Why do I have parent mean?
 What oh yeah because I'm doing something unto the Lord so
 Vision is so important. It really is the fuel for the everyday stuff that we have to get through
 because you're living for a future season.
 And what I've learned is in the economy of heaven,
 everything you do today is an investment
 into your destiny tomorrow.
 And I just want to encourage you, you can get a vision.
 Now, let me ask you this,
 where does somebody get a vision from?
  </li><li>Well, I don't know.
 I mean, sometimes vision comes from inspiration.
 Like you hear other people's stories
 and something lights in your heart and you're like,
 oh, you know, that's what I want to see happen.
 Or that's what I want to be.
 Or the Holy Spirit's like,
 hey, that's what you're built for.
 and vision starts to grow that way. I tend to get vision a lot from dreams and just
 prophetic words or from journaling like things that the Lord is speaking to me about.
 What about you? Yeah, I used to when I was single, when I didn't have children,
 and I had way more time. I used to start off every new year by reviewing last year's journal,
 like it looked for themes and looked for promises, what did God say?
 I used to start every new year by hunger striking. It's almost the same thing. It's where you don't
 eat and you tell God you're not going to eat until he tells you stuff. But you call it fasting?
 Yeah, you call it fasting. Yeah. And I would start every new year by asking a Lord for a word for
 the new year, like Lord, what am I doing? And I don't do that anymore, not because of any great
 revelation, but because I feel like I'm in different season. I'm in a different season. I feel like
 I get continual vision, I think, because of the relationship we have with so many prophets. But
 I get it from journaling, like I'm constantly asking the Lord, Lord, Lord, what are you doing?
 Or the Lord is interrupting my day saying, hey, you know, this is why I want you to focus on,
 which is amazing. But yeah, journaling has been so helpful for me. We'll put some links in the
 show notes about how you journal because we've done some episodes on that before. But yeah,
 prophetic words, hugely important. Do you know where I get most of my vision from right now?
 Where?
 And I'm driving.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 All of the things that I've sort of launched this year or anything new that I've done.
 Wait, it's 20 days in.
 So all of the things you've launched this year?
 Well, I mean, okay, so I mean like in the last six months, like when I think about anything
 new that has like come into my head to, oh, we should do this.
 where probably most of my sermon ideas or whatever
 aren't necessarily coming when I'm having my God time
 or listening to the Bible or anything like that.
 But when I'm driving 'cause I tend to just have it silent
 in the car if it's just me.
  </li><li>I realize I do this.
 I don't know if this is gonna help anybody.
 I realize I pray and ask God for wisdom.
 And so for example, this morning I'm in church,
 I'm in the middle of worship,
 think and an idea pops into my head.
 not thinking about the question I'd asked the Lord, I've been asking the Lord for the
 last couple of months a question or repeated question, Lord, I just need some input.
 Like, what do you want me to do with this? What do you want me to do with that? I'm asking
 the Lord, I'm in worship this morning and think this answer pops into my head and I'm
 about to go, oh, this is just me, like I'm just being destroyed. I want to worship the
 Lord. I'm thinking, wait, I've been asking the Lord for input on this. Here's input that
 has come that has an unusual sense is not something that I would think of. Let me just
 sit on this for a second.
 So I stay in worship, but I stay with this thought.
 I just see where it goes out.
 And I'm like, I think that's the Lord.
 So I want to encourage you,
 don't be surprised if random thoughts pop through your head,
 especially if they seem to be answers to questions
 that you've been praying.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But you can get vision from, you know, all sorts.
 But I like getting prophetic vision.
 And I love having vision confirmed by prophets.
 Like every matter would be established by two or three
 witnesses.
 But you know, if you've got a vision from the Lord,
 ask the Lord for confirmation for it.
 I think we pretty much always do that, don't we?
 Like if it's like big stuff, we're like, okay, Lord,
 think I'm hearing you, would you send me some confirmation?
 And just to qualify that,
 'cause I've heard some interesting explanations
 of confirmation, confirmation is not
 when you go up to somebody and say,
 "This is what I feel like the Lord is telling me to do.
 "Can you confirm?"
 Confirmation is when somebody who knows nothing about it
 comes up to you and says, "Hey, this may seem strange,"
 or whatever, but I have a word for you
 and they tell you the thing that you've asked the Lord
 for confirmation about.
  </li><li>Right. - There you go.
  </li><li>Okay, I have a list of five things regarding vision.
  </li><li>All right, number one.
  </li><li>Well, I have to look at my notes 'cause I won't die.
 Number one is what we've just been talking about.
 Get a vision.
  </li><li>Get a vision.
  </li><li>If you don't have a vision for your life,
 ask the Lord for a vision.
  </li><li>'Cause the Lord has a vision for your life.
  </li><li>And we're tag teaming like nobody's with this.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
 Come on.
  </li><li>Number two, and this is, most people just stop at number one.
 I got a vision.
 Number two, you got to review your vision.
 Keep your vision in front of your eyes.
  </li><li>Oh, that's good.
  </li><li>Yeah, because you will lose sight of your vision,
 you'll get the strides of that, if you're a vision,
 you'll feel like times and seasons
 of taking away from your vision.
  </li><li>Get a dry race, write it on your mirrors,
 like get it in front of you.
  </li><li>Yeah, keep it in front of you, review your vision.
  </li><li>Hey, on that note, I was just thinking,
 one of the people that we know now
 that is one of the more successful people
 that I know of in his field,
 every single year would do a vision board.
  </li><li>Vision board is hugely important.
  </li><li>Right, so we have a friend named Josh Axe,
 and he would do vision boards every single year.
 He'd do a vision board.
 So I remember going over to his house
 and we would see the new vision board for that year
 or whatever.
 And I always thought, oh, that's cute.
 But I'm sure every single thing on the vision board
 has become a reality because it's helped him stay focused.
  </li><li>But we've done vision boards in our life as well.
 Like, if you think about our house,
 like the first time we bought our built house,
 we made a vision board about you.
 Like, this is what I would like in a wife.
 And like, yeah, amazing.
 But I also think like sometimes even your Pinterest board,
 or your Amazon wish list, like I look around my house
 and it's filled with things that,
 I mean, this is kind of materialistic,
 but what I mean is the things that I've asked a Lord for,
 the things I have or not happen since
 are deliberate things that I've asked a Lord for.
 Like, oh, fun parenting moment, this weekend,
 we've set up our kids with bank accounts,
 we've set up our kids with chores and allowances,
 and we're teaching our kids about saving and giving
 and spending.
 and teach them about tithing.
 So we're talking about tithing.
 We gave them their allowance.
 And we said, what's the first thing you do
 when you get your allowance?
 They said, we tithe.
 So we talked about tithing.
 And then we just did a little Bible study
 about why tithing so important.
 And Tia, like my, oh, it's Tia.
  </li><li>Nine. - Nine year old.
 Tia, my nine year old, asked,
 she said, because we were talking about God blessing,
 you're pouring out so much blessing, you won't handle.
 She said, what does blessing look like to me?
 And I was like, that is a great question.
 What would it look like for your life to be blessed?
 And she had some answers.
 And I said, "What you watch, God will massage blessing
 to meet the needs of your heart."
  </li><li>Okay, wait, but one more little parenting thing under that,
 just under the finances thing that was super cute.
 She has a new little student
 that's just joined her class this week, you know,
 and it's January.
 And she's from Korea. - She's from Korea.
 She doesn't speak any English.
 And Tia was like, "Mommy, I would like to,
 now that I have a bank card, I would like to go out.
 I would like to buy her a little present
 and some candy to just say, "Welcome."
 And that you have friends here.
 And it was so sweet.
 So we went and got her little present.
  </li><li>And nerd parent when she downloaded the translator
 to turn her English into Korean
 and then she's gonna write it out for her.
 So, I like that.
 Anyway, where were we?
 Get a vision, review the vision.
 Then you gotta declare the vision.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>A vision unspoken.
 I sound like I had an ancient proverb,
 but I don't know the end of it.
  </li><li>Yeah, if you--
  </li><li>A vision unspoken.
  </li><li>A vision unspoken goes nowhere.
 So you've actually got to dictate to your world
 what your vision is gonna be,
 like who you are, who you're becoming,
 declare your godly beliefs, declare,
 catch yourself when you say the opposite
 of what your vision is.
 So if God's given you a vision
 that you're gonna handle millions
 and you keep saying I'm broke,
 you're delaying that vision coming to a pass.
 So declare your vision.
  </li><li>Good, love it.
  </li><li>I'm a strong, confident woman, cigarettes.
 Don't control my life.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, be careful what you declare.
 Yeah, don't declare that necessarily.
  </li><li>Number four and number five,
 I've been super helpful in our life.
 Number four is so towards your vision.
 So where you wanna go.
 So find people who are already doing what they're doing
 and just sow time, energy, honor, money, prayer.
  </li><li>Whatever you have to sow.
  </li><li>Whatever you have to sow.
 Like for years I always wanted to move to the prophetic.
 I lived in Scotland, I didn't know any prophets.
 When any prophets would come to my country,
 I would go visit them, I'd buy their resources.
 I'd sew into their ministry because I wanted to do what they were doing.
 So I encourage you to do that.
 And then lastly, number five is serve somebody else's vision.
 So important.
 If you don't have a vision, serve somebody else's till you get your own.
 It won't be wasted time.
 I promise.
 You know the other advantage of when you serve somebody else's vision,
 keeps you humble and allows you to sacrifice yours.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 When you are so confident that your vision is from God,
 you can help build somebody else's to come to pass
 because you know yours is all inheritance.
  </li><li>Oh, that's really good.
  </li><li>Yeah, part of the reason we left Toronto
 to move to Nashville was we knew that the blessing
 and the inheritance that's in Toronto
 is not something we worked for,
 it's something that's given to us.
 And so we could go and serve Jeff and Becky's vision,
 knowing that our inheritance in Toronto was still secure.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, serve somebody else's vision.
 Oh my gosh, it's so, so important.
 Because again, you're in part so in where you wanna go.
 Any other thoughts on vision?
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>Okay, there are your thoughts on vision.
 If you have any thoughts, questions,
 test or any comments, please reach out on Twitter @allen
 and AJ and let us know about it.
 Would you like a listener's question?
  </li><li>I would.
  </li><li>This is a hard one, but a really, really powerful one.
  </li><li>I wouldn't then.
  </li><li>No, it's still helpful.
  </li><li>It's still helpful, okay.
 This is A Listener's question is from Sally.
  </li><li>Hi Sally.
  </li><li>And Sally writes in and she says this,
 "I recently learned that my parents are getting divorced."
 Oh, I'm so sorry.
 I would love if you could give some advice
 on how to navigate this.
 I find myself having lots of questions
 questioning what a Christian marriage even means,
 while my parents are separating,
 even when there's been no abuse or adultery.
 I worry about how it will affect my own relationships
 in the future.
 I realize I'm harboring lots of bitterness towards them
 for making what I feel is a selfish decision.
 I don't want my heart to cause me to hurt other people
 or to grow bitter and hard-hearted.
 Can you offer some guidance or resources
 on how to still believe in marriage
 and how to begin healing?
 Thank you so much.
 Love you guys.
 I thought you'd be excellent at this question
 because your parents are divorced
 and you've been through divorce.
 So over to our divorce while keeping a happy heart expert.
 Kijo Jones.
  </li><li>Here's the thing I never wanted to be an expert on.
 I'm not sure I am actually.
 I think my best advice is to just keep having a discussion with the Holy Spirit about how
 you're feeling.
 Because your feelings are real and it is disappointing and it's hurtful and it's a painful thing
 to go through.
 And I guess really not knowing the circumstances of stuff that's going on, it's hard to be
 specific other than to say you want to keep your heart soft and you never want to base
 your theology or what you believe to be a good thing. You know, scripture says marriage is a good
 thing and you don't want to stop believing something is a good thing because you see examples of it
 being difficult if that makes sense. Like you don't want to lower what you know to be true
 based on experience. So my encouragement to you is to just be honest with God about how you're
 feeling and maybe even get in a group or get some, get with some people that you can process with.
 who can pray you through and help you realize if it seems to be turning towards bitterness
 or any of those kind of things.
 Because, you know, anyway, it's easy to get angry when we don't understand.
 Sally, the other thing I was thinking about, and honestly, I'm genuinely sorry you and
 your parents are going through this.
 The other thing I thought when I read your email is because we don't know you, we don't
 know your circumstances, I don't know how old you are, it could be that your parents
 are protecting you or keeping things from you for your own heart's sake.
 And I think that the, the safest thing that you can do is refuse to judge,
 which is really, really hard where it are done.
 So hard.
 When we think we know the motives of another person's heart,
 but refuse to judge, refuse to embrace bitterness.
 And you've got to remember everybody does the best they can with what they have.
 So not everybody has access to amazing resources.
 Not everybody has a relationship with the Lord like everybody else does.
 And you also got to understand that you want to be careful not to judge because
 you will reap whatever you judge and you don't want to do that.
 So you have to be this person who is asking the Holy Spirit for grace that you
 can extend to other people.
 You can extend to your parents.
 You can extend to your own heart.
 You can extend to those who've hurt you.
 But if you can, like ages says, pour out your lament to the Lord.
 like don't deny your feelings, say, "Lord, I am angry,
 "or I am sad, or I am lonely, or I am hurt."
 Pour those laments out to the Lord.
 He really wants to hear about those things.
 And I'm not suggesting, "Hey, when we're saying
 "you've got to forgive and you don't allow bitterness."
 We're not saying deny your feelings.
 I'm saying take those feelings to the Lord
 and ask for grace.
 He loves to give self to the bits of our heart
 that are hurt and wounded.
 And I'd also encourage you, surround yourself
 with people who've got great marriages,
 so that you have an antidote to the issues
 that are presenting.
 If you're constantly surrounded
 by the wounds of your parents marriage,
 find other people who've got amazing marriages
 so that you can see a contrast.
 It's hugely important.
  </li><li>Seem white from your question,
 and I think actually it's kind of a common belief
 that if your parents marriage doesn't make it,
 then how do you have any kind of chance or whatever?
 But I actually know lots of people
 where their testimonies would be close to mine
 in that my parents are divorced.
 It was a pretty bad situation.
 And I actually have an amazing marriage
 and I love being married.
  </li><li>Just a light being cuddled at night.
  </li><li>Just don't like being cuddled at night.
 Well, not, I just, anyway.
 So, I don't, you know, I would say,
 what you don't wanna do is write off your future hope
 based on what your parents are working through right now.
 'Cause actually God can redeem anything.
 So I love what Ellen was saying about get around
 other people with healthy marriages.
 And let that kind of restore your heart.
 I had the privilege of being around a lot of people
 with healthy marriages and it does start to restore
 and heal you.
  </li><li>And remember, you are not your parents.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Which is beautiful.
 Thank you for writing in Sally,
 we'll be praying for you and your family.
 And thanks for sharing your heart.
 Hopefully that's of some help.
 To everybody else who's tuned in,
 thank you so much.
 Did I freak you out?
 I'm sorry.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 He did. Yeah, just right there.

 We hope you had an amazing Christmas and an amazing new year.
 We're excited for your 2019.

 If you're wanting to know what's different about this episode, you may have noticed
 a difference in sound perhaps.
 That is because we are actually recording it in our video studio.
 So we are wanting to get more into doing video.
 And so we are actually, do you call it ripping the sound?
 We're...
 Yeah, normally we record it in our podcast studio that's upstairs and it's kind of like
 like a room that's treated and we've got proper microphones
 and headphones.
 Like as you said, we're recording this in our video studio,
 which I don't know how that sound quality
 is gonna turn out.
 Like so give us some feedback on what you've noticed.
 Hopefully it sounds good.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're hoping it's gonna be good.
  </li><li>But we're trying to practice getting more
 and more into video.
 And I'll be honest, I'm super uncomfortable
 in front of a camera.
 Like it's really easy in our podcast studio
 'cause you can't see us and we can do multiple takes.
 But when you're on video, it's like,
 you're constantly aware there's a camera right there
 and an audience, but I also realized
 we're never gonna get good at video if we don't practice.
 And when we started normal podcasting,
 we had all the same sort of fears
 and it's only by practice.
 So that's what's different about this week.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And actually, it's quite funny.
 Are they gonna be able to see this video?
  </li><li>If you're one of our patrons,
 you will be able to watch this video.
 If you're not one of our patrons,
 you can become a patron.
 And basically you can watch AJ
 in a super thick.
  </li><li>I'm in my parka and I just realized,
 I've been sitting on this hand,
 look at it's kind of like,
 to try and make it so that I'm not waiting
 for my hands around so I thought,
 I'll sit on one and then put one flat on the desk.
  </li><li>Right now it's like, what's the temperature outside?
  </li><li>Well, I think it's Celsius,
 but it's minus something in the Celsius.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's minus three degrees Celsius.
 It's something like, I'm called 31 degrees Fahrenheit.
 It's freezing outside and we're in our basement,
 which is freezing cold.
 But anyway, if you wanna watch AJ Shiver
 through this podcast episode,
 again, if you're a patron, you know where to look for it.
 If you'd like to become a patron,
 just go to lnajor.com/support and you can watch it.
 And if you would like us to answer a question,
 head over to ln and AJ.com/ask
 and we'll do our best to answer your question on the show.
 But as always, we're thrilled that you tuned in.
 We're glad to be back.
 We're excited to accompany you through 2019 this year.
 And we'll be back, same time, same place.
  </li><li>But how do we get feedback on the touching, no touching?
 Can they like vote on Instagram or can they,
 can we put something?
  </li><li>We'll put out, you know, one of those Instagram polls,
 if you don't follow us on Instagram,
 we're @allenandaj and we'll do an Instagram story
 sometime this week where you get to vote
 and we can poll on.
  </li><li>I need your help people.
  </li><li>Touching and cuddling before you go to bed at night.
  </li><li>I just wanna know, when you're asleep,
 I just want to go on something.
 Do you want someone to be done?
 (laughing)
 What's so wrong about that?
 You're adorable.
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 All right, we pray you have an amazing week.
 God bless you.
 Bye-bye.
