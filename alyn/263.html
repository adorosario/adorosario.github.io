<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in ages, but I'll ask for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 263 of Keeping Up with the Joneses.
 Mr. Jones.
 How are you?
  </li><li>I'm good.
 I'm so good because I'm so rested.
  </li><li>You don't see, sure about that.
 Oh, okay, because you're so rested.
  </li><li>Well, the thing that you're seeing is me just not on,
 'cause I haven't done anything for seven days.
  </li><li>Yes.
 I've just been completely off and I have to tell you,
 I feel like a new man.
  </li><li>See, that's so great.
 And we, and we gussied up our set.
 I mean, we gussied up our set.
  </li><li>We gussied up Mr. O, he's not the right way for putting it.
 We Christmased up.
  </li><li>Here's what I thought.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I kind of feel like I need to apologize.
 And then I realize only our members are gonna see this
 and everyone who's listening can't tell.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I had vast hopes of decorating our studio
 in a Christmas theme 'cause we've got three more episodes,
 well, two more including this one.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we're gonna go like Christmas tree.
  </li><li>I'm trying to get more progress with Christmas.
 So I have a Christmas tree.
 I have my stalking, 'cause I'm on Santa's nice list
 and you're clear to him as naughty list,
 'cause I don't see an AJ anywhere.
  </li><li>Well, that doesn't say that.
  </li><li>I hijacked some--
  </li><li>It says A, that could be my stalking.
  </li><li>Shh, I decorate as much.
 Anyway, I think the last time I've learned
 is I suck at decorating and it takes way more work
 than just coming down and throwing a few things up there.
  </li><li>Well, yes, but I was thankful
 that you wanted to try because it gave me time to have a little nap.
 Yeah, and a nap you did have.
 I just want to go back to this talking for a moment.
 For those of you that aren't members, you can't tell that all it has is the letter A
 on it, just a big A.
 So it actually has half of my name and only a quarter of yours, so it's probably my stocking.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 I couldn't understand your math and then I got it.
 It's like half?
 What?
  </li><li>Yep. - All right.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>The reason we're so relaxed,
 and probably this episode is gonna be very all over the place.
 This 'cause we're so woo-hoo, is,
 and this throws it, again, depending on when you listen to it,
 we're recording this at the end of our Thanksgiving week,
 but this won't be coming out 'til the beginning of December.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, comes out like 10 days later, or whatever, yeah.
  </li><li>And all I wanna say is add a great Thanksgiving.
  </li><li>Oh, me too, it was so good.
  </li><li>So our weekly catch up is gone,
 and tell us what we did for Thanksgiving.
  </li><li>Well, we mostly just spent time with the kids
 and ate a bunch of food, a lot of food.
  </li><li>It felt weird putting on clothes today.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well, I did actually work.
  </li><li>I know, but I wore pajamas pretty much exclusively
 the whole time.
 So I put on clothes like that, man,
 these pajamas feel, oh, these are jeans.
 Okay, I wonder if I can get jean-like pants
 made from pajamas.
 Jean-like pants made from pajamas.
  </li><li>So, you know, I can go to work.
  </li><li>Maybe.
  </li><li>Where it looks like I'm dressed, but I'm still in pajamas.
  </li><li>I think they make those.
 I'm pretty sure Lulu Lemon makes something like that.
  </li><li>Well, if Lulu Lemon makes it,
 I'm sure they'll be quite nice,
 but I was just terrified at the thought
 of you doing a Google search and buying some for me.
  </li><li>It seemed like pajamas, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, we set off the kids were off.
 And so we took the whole week off,
 work, which was nice.
 Continuing Alan A.J.'s movie review,
 we watched, which I had,
 minor offense and huge prejudice against, but ultimately ended up enjoying the Home Alone reboot.
 So this is a neighbor of Fox, which gave them all the property rights.
 And so they've rebooted Home Alone, aside from the title and a recurring cast from the original movie,
 no spoilers.
 It is really good.
 It is a reboot.
 It is a totally different movie.
 A totally different movie.
 But they did a great job.
 Well, but I don't want to give any spoilers, but at least 75% of the way through the movie,
 I was like, I don't like where this plot is going.
 And then they redeemed it quite well.
 Yes, I thought they did a good job as well.
 And we watched the Bond movie.
 We already talked about that.
 This is how relaxed we are.
 Oh my gosh.
 It's all blending together.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 What I will say about Home Alone is it clearly wasn't made for a 50 year old and a 47 year
 old, but are two youngest kids?
 Oh, barely.
 They loved it.
 mean they absolutely loved it. So I thought they hit the recipe really, really well.
 Yes, for their group. I got a booster shot. You did. And it knocked me on my
 butt. Yeah. So I was vaccinated with Pfizer, two shots of Pfizer. And from
 everything I've read, it's like, he mixed up if you had Pfizer go from a
 durna, which is just so happens that the boosters that were available in my
 area were Moderna. So I went and got the jab and I felt okay. And I got a
 lunchtime. I got lunchtime Tuesday by like most of the afternoon, Tuesday, I felt like I'd taken
 three Valium. I was like, "Ooh, you're like really drowsy." Yeah. The next day. You were useless.
 I was useless. I was so tired and just couldn't think of anything.
 That's sick though. Just tired. Just really, really tired. And then at about 7 p.m. I spiked a fever
 And by 8 p.m. I went to bed because I couldn't stay awake.
 And the next morning at 6 a.m. after an hour of sleep, I was from that to life.
 But so I'm whatever that is. Yeah, I'm I'm
 boosted people. I'm absolutely boosted.
 I tried my bow and arrow this week.
 Oh my gosh. I should I'll cut in a video right here for the members to see you
 shooting your your bone. Oh, that'd be fun.
 Yeah, I took it out and I wounded myself.
 I don't think we've talked about your bone arrow.
 You just said, I try my bone arrow.
 Like that's a common thing we've talked about.
 Oh, yeah.
 We haven't talked about.
 Well, so here's the thing.
 Like I, uh, I have thought about shooting a bow and arrow for a while.
 And then when COVID was happening, I can stop you right there.
 Yeah.
 I thought about finding a bone arrow for a long time now.
 Like what's that?
 A couple of years.
 Yeah.
 Where'd that come from?
 It came from the Hunger Games.
 No, it didn't come from the Hunger Games.
 It came from in Toronto occasionally when I would get really hit by the Holy Spirit and
 manifest, like my body would do something.
 It kind of looked like I was shooting an arrow and I had so many different people say to
 me, "Oh, it looks like you're shooting arrows."
 True, you do have that manifestation.
 And I thought, "Oh, that's interesting."
 Anyway, then with COVID getting sort of locked down and whatever, I kept thinking, "What
 am I going to do to get outside and do something?"
 And I thought, I actually looked up, is there an archery club in Nashville, you know, at
 like a summer and a half ago, walking around the neighborhood, getting a puppy, running
 on a treadmill.
 None of those float to the front of your brain.
 But I wonder if I could join an archery club.
 I didn't know why.
 I just always wanted to try it.
 And so, and then in October, I did the Southgate Ladies Retreat and we got to try archery.
 And you know, we each got to shoot like five or six arrows, but I loved it.
 And you know, the guy was like, actually, you're naturally pretty good at this.
 And I was like, very cool.
 So I decided for my birthday that I would put that on my like Amazon list.
 I would like a bow and arrow and some arrows in a target.
 And so some sweet friends bought it for me.
 And all the stuff came in like the glove and all that.
 And so I was like, "Babe, I'm going to set it up and shoot it."
 So you came and you filmed my first--
 I did.
 My first five arrows, my first quiver of arrows.
 You did a great job.
 Thank you.
 I'm also thinking that over there, you could set up an indoor firing range.
 Yeah, I could.
 There's like nothing in there.
 But I don't think it's going to be good for the arrows to potentially, if I did miss
 and hit the concrete, then I would ruin my arrows.
 We can stick up some of those boards.
 We'll figure it out.
  </li><li>In fact, in decorate a set like a boss.
 And by the way, you chose to come dress the Santa Claus,
 which I thought was really sweet that outfit.
 Then I can set up a firing ring.
  </li><li>Listen, I kinda match you.
 You're in blue and red.
  </li><li>Yeah, I know.
  </li><li>I'm in jeans and red and white.
  </li><li>We did mistletoe over here.
 Can you work your magic and make this more Christmas-y?
  </li><li>Oh, I'll see what I can do by next time.
  </li><li>Yeah, all right.
 Okay, watch.
 It's gonna have snow, there's gonna be penguins, ice skating.
 It's gonna be marvellous.
  </li><li>Anyway, I managed to wound myself.
  </li><li>Shull on the wound.
 really? Okay. I can't. I'm wearing long sleeves. Okay. I'll post a picture right now. That's
 what it looks like. Yeah, it's awful. I and it's from two badly done shots. So basically,
 you know, there's certain form to doing it and you're supposed to keep your front arm
 slightly bent so that the string doesn't catch your arm. And turns out that's pretty important.
 Yeah, so I only shot maybe about 30 arrows, but twice I didn't pay as much attention to my front
 arm as I should and hit the exact same spot twice because I straightened my arm fully.
 And I have a Bruce roughly the size of a baseball.
 You have a belter of a bruise.
 Oh, yeah. It's black and blue mostly with some green. So, you know, it's festive.
 You shot 30 arrows? How many arrows did you get?
 I only have five.
 Oh, okay. You went back.
  </li><li>I know went back, pulled them out,
 but I have it on my Amazon list to get another set.
  </li><li>You should get trick arrows like on Hawkeye.
  </li><li>No, yeah.
  </li><li>It's on all of them.
  </li><li>In addition to being on Thanksgiving,
 our tradition is to set up our Christmas decorations
 the next day.
 And so now our house is decorated for Christmas.
  </li><li>We are.
  </li><li>Good to go.
 And I raked the front yard.
 And I don't think all rakes are created equal.
 I think we have a horrible rake.
  </li><li>Wouldn't surprise me.
 I did no research on the purchase of that rate.
  </li><li>I am shocked in a pod.
  </li><li>So that was our week.
 If you're American, I hope you had an amazing Thanksgiving.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's a thing I love, now that I've been here,
 now that I'm an American, I think I get Thanksgiving.
 It's like a dry run for Christmas, like a dress rehearsal.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Does that make sense?
 'Cause like now I can't wait for Christmas.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You know, just a week of just eating amazing foods
 and you made a cheesecake that was phenomenal.
  </li><li>A keto cheesecake.
 Which, honestly, is better than any cheesecake I've ever had.
 It's grain-free and sugar-free.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it is amazing.
  </li><li>It's really good.
 I really like it.
  </li><li>Sometimes the keto stuff has this kind of alcohol,
 chemical alcohol aftertaste.
 That thing did not.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>And it wasn't too sweet.
  </li><li>But I think that's 'cause it's made with swerve.
 Swerve doesn't have that taste to me.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Well, either way, it was absolutely delicious.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So, there you go.
  </li><li>All right, you have a cheeky grin on your face.
 You think about cheesecake?
 You're thinking about me.
  </li><li>Well, yes.
 Hello. Hello. All right. Our topic for this week. Yes. Honestly, because we're not
 like a lady because we're relaxed and unwinding. Yeah. We were thinking about like, you know,
 what are we going to talk about? And we've thrown around this for a couple of weeks and
 just kept putting it off. Yeah. We want to talk about five things we did not know about
 living in the South. Yes. Okay. Caviat. Yes. What's our caveat? Well, the South is a generic
 term for the southern states of the United States.
 Yes.
 And I'm sure all of the south isn't the same.
 I'm sure if you go to the Carolinas or Louisiana or Texas, it's going to be very different
 from Tennessee.
 So we are talking about our Allen AJ's experience, things we did not know before living here.
 And now we do like all of us.
 I don't know what's on your list.
 You don't know what's on mine.
 I want to go first this week because you got to go first last week.
 Okay.
 I'm worried you're going to take some of mine.
 Go ahead.
 And I took a leaf out of your book,
 and I'm actually reading a book right now.
 Look at my list.
 Look how short it is.
 Last week, Asia was like, "Ah, babe,
 "you've just got written prose."
 But when I sit down and think about what I wanna say,
 I can't stop all the thoughts, I just write them down.
 That's why this doesn't have prose.
 But I've been reading this book,
 and it's talking about actually being less,
 doing what I do and being more spontaneous,
 and I'm gonna give it a shot.
 And my thought is it's gonna make me a less engaging podcaster,
 but you know what, science, let's try and see what happens.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>All right, here's my...
  </li><li>Number one.
  </li><li>I appreciate it in these episodes.
 Here's my five things I don't know about living in the set.
  </li><li>Number one.
  </li><li>Number one.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How stinking relational it is.
  </li><li>How stinking relational like...
  </li><li>How relational?
 Like the way of life here is super relational.
 And I had to have that pointed out to me.
 I remember meeting with a friend because I don't know,
 I'd go here maybe like within a year, two years,
 and I just couldn't understand why everybody
 wanted to meet with me.
 Like all the time, they wanted like breakfast or lunch
 or let's do coffee and you know,
 I'd be like, I don't even drink coffee.
 And my friend had to sit down and go,
 "Yeah, it's not about the coffee."
 And I was like, "What do you mean?"
 He said, "Ellen, look at where we're sitting.
 "And if you were to draw a circle around us,
 "count up the number of coffee shops
 "that are at breakfast bars that are,
 "wine bars that are cigar stores that are,
 Think about people's homes.
 They have front porches to sit laminated and sweet tea on.
 They have fire pits out the back like the whole of the South is built with
 relationship in mind.
 Oh, yeah.
 That's really good.
 And I was like, yeah.
 So if you think about it, that now that I think my favorite thing, I'm
 in Soak's Day because this is partly why I didn't know about living in America,
 too.
 But in my whole life, in living in Scotland and living in Canada, it never,
 ever occurred to me to go out for breakfast.
 The breakfast is not a meal that I'm going to eat out at.
 I'll meet you for lunch.
 I'll meet you for dinner.
 But the south is so relation.
 It's like, let's go for breakfast.
 Yeah.
 I see.
 I'm trying to think if I ever went out for breakfast.
 But and when you go to breakfast, it's packed.
 Like there are restaurants here that are breakfast only restaurants.
 Plenty of them.
 And when you go there at like seven a.m.
 packed and packed often with one of my upcoming points. But that was the thing that I was so
 odd to me. And I now so deeply and richly appreciate. I just think even about our community. It's
 always fire pits or it's always hanging out. I think about like, you know, one of my closest
 friendships I have like every Friday, it's a bit too cold now, but every Friday we'd sit on this
 porch and we just sit in a rocker and we would just talk for hours.
 And I love that.
 I love it.
 That's a really good one.
 That's number one.
 Yeah, I like it.
 Number two, which is kind of similar.
 OK, now it's also worth pointing out that the passion with which I'm talking
 doesn't mean that what we have is better than what you have.
 It's just it's just different.
 Right. Right.
 And so the one I'm about to mention sounds like it's comparative.
 And it's only comparative to what we know.
 It's not comparative as in better or worse.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I think part of our excitement
 about talking about this today is we were out for lunch
 with some new friends from California.
 And they're new to Tennessee, have just moved here.
 And we sort of got excited about Tennessee things.
  </li><li>Right, what we love.
  </li><li>What we love, so.
  </li><li>Right, number two.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The slow pace of life.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Now, a couple of things I want to mention is,
 You could argue that we don't have a slow pace of life,
 but I would say that Nashville Franklin,
 where we live is slower pace than anywhere else I've lived.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I agree.
  </li><li>All right, and people would argue,
 so funny story, before we even moved here,
 we came to kind of like see what is it like,
 is their favorite here,
 we've probably told the story before,
 we come, we check in to a hotel,
 we pick three different hotels to see,
 three different parts of the city,
 and we check in hotel in downtown Nashville.
 And we wanted to go, where did we want to go?
 We wanted to go down to Franklin.
 And it was about, it was Friday night,
 it was about 4.30, quarter five,
 and as we're heading out, the concierge in the hotel said,
 you know, do you need a car, do you need a cab?
 And we're like, no, no, we got our own car.
 We're headed down to Franklin.
 And he was like, that's probably the wrong time ago,
 you know, like traffic will be a nightmare.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And we were like, you know, even if it is,
 we don't mind.
  </li><li>We're from Toronto.
 We just want to look around, we want to have a feel.
 And then we got in what was rush hour traffic.
 And we just giggled because we were like, oh.
  </li><li>'Cause it's still moved.
  </li><li>I'm like, this is not right.
 This is, to what we were used to,
 how many lanes is the four or one?
  </li><li>It places 20 something lanes across here.
  </li><li>So like the level of traffic that we were used to.
 Now it's not that everyone just sits around smoking cigars,
 sipping sweet tea and nothing gets done.
 'cause there is a huge entrepreneurial spirit in here
 where people are hustling and people are getting things done,
 but it is still a super slow laid back.
  </li><li>Way more laid back, yeah.
  </li><li>And I love it.
 I love the pace of life in general
 and I love the pace of our life.
  </li><li>And I would say that's evidenced in the driving as well.
 I'm like the first couple of years.
 Can you grow up?
  </li><li>Is that on your list?
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Okay, you can have some time.
  </li><li>Would you grow up driving in Toronto?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Basically, if you are not an aggressive driver in Toronto,
 you are not going to change lanes.
  </li><li>You keep saying aggressive.
 I mean, a decisive driver.
 You say aggressive, I think you're using your horn
 and flipping people off.
 I just mean decisive.
  </li><li>Decisive.
  </li><li>I'm going and you know I've gone 'cause I've gone.
  </li><li>Yeah, but I mean, you have to just be
 kind of in it to win it.
  </li><li>I'm mostly your way in.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 And then you come here and like half the time people
 aren't even driving the speed limit,
 they're just having a nice time looking around
 and I'm like, what are you doing?
 Yeah, so it took me like years, literally years,
 to not be frustrated by the driving here.
  </li><li>Are you claiming that you've now moved past frustration?
  </li><li>Well, I'm pretty sure I was in the car with you.
 This is we.
  </li><li>I'm in a much better place than I was,
 is all I'm trying to submit.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>All right, number three.
  </li><li>Yes, number three.
  </li><li>The food.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I didn't know it, but I was built to live in the south.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 introduced a whole of the foods that I did not know exist, which are perfectly curated for my pallet.
 Yes.
 You talked about a church this morning.
 I did.
 You spoke, but let me just, you know, how I love the let me list some things like
 pimento cheese.
 I didn't know what pimento cheese was.
 Pimento cheese is like the most delicious cheese on the planet.
 Is it though?
 See, she has got irony of irony.
 I grew up in Scotland.
 I grew up in Great Britain,
 where what's the thing that everybody drinks all of the time?
 Iron brew.
 Tea.
 Oh, tea.
 (laughing)
 Love your favorite, too, so.
 (laughing)
 Whiskey.
 What?
 (laughing)
 The thing that everybody would drink all the time
 is tea, do you want a cup of?
 And ironically, I never drank tea.
 Right.
 The whole time I get here,
 and I discover the way to get out and drink tea
 is just serve it cold over ice.
 It's delicious.
 Sweetened.
 I have unsweet tea.
 You do now.
  </li><li>Yeah, but when we first moved here,
 you were like, you were a walking sweetie.
 You would get so excited, we would go out
 and you'd have like three or four sweetie at one meal.
 And then you'd be like, I don't know why I can't sleep.
 I was like, ooh, pick me, pick me, I know why.
  </li><li>Okay, thank you for empty.
  </li><li>I mean, didn't Jeff once say,
 just because they've offered you a refill,
 doesn't mean you have to take it.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well, don't even get me started on refills.
 That was a paradigm shifter, but I lived here so long.
 That's not just picking the norm.
 But I remember when they were like,
 they give you free?
 Yes, they'll.
  </li><li>Free refills a lot.
  </li><li>They give you free refills.
 But tea, like I never drank tea growing up.
 And now I've made up for lost time.
 I love ice tea.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Biscuits and gravy.
 Now, this is what was so confusing
 because in Great Britain, biscuits is something
 you have with your tea.
 You dip your biscuits.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're like cookies, like biscotti
 and things like that.
  </li><li>Yes. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Yes, sure.
 Biscuits over here are the closest we have to scones.
 Like a savory scones.
  </li><li>Scones are denser.
 Biscuits are like a little bit fluffy.
  </li><li>As somebody had eggs benedict on biscuits today,
 I can tell you it was a scone.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But biscuits and gravy,
 the thought of having like a rich tea biscuit
 or a digestive biscuit with brown gravy over it,
 it was horrifying.
 So I stayed away from it for like 12 years.
 It was only this year I was having breakfast,
 out for breakfast with a friend at the country boy.
 (laughing)
 There's a restaurant that is older than me
 called the country boy in Leapers Fork
 and it's an experience to go there.
 And so I thought, I'm gonna have biscuits and gravy.
 And I was like, where have you been all my life?
 And it's, you know, it needs a branding,
 needs a marketing overhaul for foreigners, but it was delicious.
 It was scones with like sausage.
 Oh, no, stop.
 It was delicious.
 But you're talking about that banana pudding.
 Like Southern white.
 I'm talking about that.
 That's what you're talking about.
 Disgusting.
 Gross.
 Have you actually had it?
 No.
 Yeah.
 I'm taking you to the country boy.
 I'm not having it.
 You are selling your best table, please.
 The lady and I will have some.
 This is crazy.
 You will love it.
 I'm just, but the food is, you know,
 anything deep fried?
 Yeah. Deep fried okra.
 Everything is deep fried.
 Oh, waffles and chicken.
 Well, I can see the deep frying thing
 being appealing to you because the Scottish like to deep fry things like Mars bars.
 Yeah.
 Things like that.
 So we are a nation of culinary geniuses.
 Yes.
 Nevertheless, still stuff I would never think that.
 The only thing I haven't been persuaded by is grits.
  </li><li>Grits, awful.
  </li><li>I mean, it sounds awful,
 it needs a marketing overhaul.
  </li><li>It is, it is.
  </li><li>But anyway, the food I was built to live in the South.
 What are you gonna say?
 It looks like you've got a low-QC comment.
  </li><li>No, I mean food is on my list too.
 I'm gonna wait until I get to do my list.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, that was food.
 Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.
 Number four.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>This has, well, this isn't all like good things.
 Right? This is just things we didn't know.
 Yeah, yeah.
 I did not know what it was like to live in the Bible Belt.
 Yeah.
 Now again, the Bible Belt is just kind of thrown around term.
 And I'm sure you could visit lots of countries, countries, lots of states in the
 south and experience a different facet of the Bible Belt.
 Yeah.
 But I remember when we moved here, have it moved from Toronto, which would be
 decidedly not only multicultural, but multi-faith.
 Multi-faith.
 Yes.
 right? And you would, and you'd be very aware of that everywhere you'd go to here, where you know,
 you'd go into Panera Bread or you go into Starbucks, you'd just be around your business, you know,
 just running your own business. And there would be like maybe a men's group having a Bible study,
 you know, at lunchtime, and nobody's back in eyelid, totally normal music playing in, you know,
 in Walmart or in department stores or not odd to go out for lunch and see a table just by their head
 in prayer to say grace and nobody's batting an eyelid.
 Right.
 That Christianization has both good and bad elements to it.
 Okay.
 The good is like it's really easy to talk about, you know, Christian things.
 There's a cultural thing that you can tap into, which is really, really easy.
 Um, there is very strong sense of Christian values.
 Like our kids are in public school.
 They're not in private schools.
 are not in Christian schools and is very clear as we've met our teachers that they are practicing
 Christians.
 Right.
 It's not that they have posters, it's not that they talk about it, but it's just by lifestyle,
 it's very evident to tell what that's going on.
 The downside to that is, as we were talking to a friend today, I asked her for permission,
 I'm not going to use her name, but she was talking about what has been like dating in
 Nashville.
 And she was like, the problem with dating in Nashville is everyone is a Christian,
 but you have to find out what that term means to them.
 Right.
 And I love the way that she said that, because by and large, everyone you meet
 is a Christian, but I'm a Christian means different things to different people.
 Because there's an aspect of being Christian means I was just raising church,
 and it might not mean they actually have a personal faith with Jesus.
 Or it might be that they pray the sinners prayer back in sixth grade, but they've moved no further forward that in the kingdom.
 So that becomes really, really difficult with evangelism when you're trying to introduce people to Jesus,
 because they might think they already have them when probably biblically they don't.
 It also means anybody who's been hurt by Christians, by a church, by a church organization,
 you're automatically tarred with the same breath.
 So there's good and there's bad about that.
 that. I was just shocked about how pervasive Christianity is in our culture. I was not prepared
 for that. Yeah, I agree. It's really easy when you go first. All right, number five.
 I remember we visited our friends in Shalot, North Carolina. Shalot!
 And this is before we'd ever moved to South. And we were hanging out with some friends who were
 our age. And we were over some other friends of ours who were probably our parents age.
 Yeah. Right. And we would call them, you know, Ron and Clarisse. These were, you know, friends,
 you know, Ronnie would say, "Hey, do you want to, you know, do you want to drink?" Yes, please,
 Ronnie, I have one of those. But whenever our friends who lived there would respond to Ron and
 Clarisse, they would always call them Mr. Ronny and Miss Clarisse. Yeah. And I was like, is it
 because they don't know them that well? And I remember asking them, why do you,
 why? Like once I hung out with them and I realized, no, no, these guys have known each other for years.
 I was like, you know, when I grew up, I had my real aunt and uncles, right?
 You know, antigen and uncle Pete, like biological, and some uncles.
 Yes. And then I also had, you know, an anti-an an uncle gym.
 They were just my parents, friends, that when you were a little kid, you called
 them. Like our kids have. Maybe it's a cultural thing.
 So I asked them that and they're like, no, no, it's just, that's what we do.
 They didn't even know how to answer it.
 My point is number five would be the yes, sir.
 No ma'am. Yes, Mr. Allen. Hi, Miss AJ.
 Titles.
 You're our pastor.
 Yeah.
 Yes, pastor. No pastor. Yeah.
 That I was not, I was not ready for that.
 And now I love it.
 Now that I have kids. Yes.
 I love hearing my kids.
 I don't let my kids call me, sir.
 And they don't call you, man.
 Like that's the thing in the Southern.
 You know, especially if you're in trouble, you know, no, no, no, sir.
 I don't want to ever my kids to think of me as sir or ma'am, right?
 But I love watching my kids use sir and ma'am with other friends or if they're they're closer friends
 You're Mr. Chris and yeah, you know, I think that's really sweet that I don't know if it's politeness
 I don't know if it's honor. I don't know if it's just a cultural
 Not but I like it and I'm converted. I like it too. I've even
  </li><li>That's weird, it was so weird when we moved here.
  </li><li>So weird.
 It is not my preference to be called Pastor Allen,
 but I've given up asking people to stop calling me Pastor Allen.
 Like I'd prefer they just call me Allen,
 but people do all the time.
 And I'm like, okay.
  </li><li>But equally we have people that just call us Allen or AJ.
  </li><li>Of course, of course, people who know it,
 still don't know what people are like,
 excuse me, Pastor, can I ask you this question?
 And I'm like, okay.
 I've fully asked you a thousand times,
 please don't call me Pastor.
 But there you go, that's my--
  </li><li>But I think that's an honor thing.
  </li><li>I think so too.
 Yeah, I think so.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't know anything.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>Let me look at my five.
  </li><li>All right, hit me with your one.
  </li><li>So my first two are about food.
  </li><li>You got two about food?
  </li><li>I did.
  </li><li>I feel like I failed.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, I mean--
  </li><li>If number one is sweet tea and number two is,
 I'm sweet tea you've cheated.
  </li><li>No, my first one was I did not know
 that certain vegetables existed until we moved here.
 And I was trying to think of all the different ones
 that I've been shocked by,
 The main ones were okra, never heard of it, never had it, never wanted to have it, mac
 and cheese is not a vegetable, and collard greens.
 I had charred, which is similar, I think, but anyway, collard greens and okra.
 I don't think you can get them in Canada.
 But also okra, the first time I'm right in thinking about it, the first time we ever
 had both of those things was a daily dish and they were both gross.
 Yes.
 And then we just slimy.
 Then we discovered two pillow honey.
 And how do they serve there?
 They do them blistered.
 So they're not breaded.
 They're basically baked or roasted in an oven.
 I'm yummy.
 I'm in my tongue.
 So good.
 So I bake them that way at home now.
 But yeah, the first couple of times I had okra, I was like, but then we ended up trying
 it because somebody else ordered it blistered and I was like, oh, yes.
 I will have this.
 I will have those.
 I'm still not a collard greens fan.
 And you know, I'm always worried when we do podcasts like this because inevitably when
 I say I don't like grits and I don't like collard greens, what people say is, but you
 haven't tried mine.
 And when we first moved here, I must have tried eight different people's grits and I
 just, it's the texture.
 Can't do it.
  </li><li>Same with meatloaf.
 You're just not a meatloaf.
  </li><li>I cannot do meatloaf.
 No, no, it shouldn't be formed into a breadloaf.
 It's not right.
 My second one was--
  </li><li>Other food related.
  </li><li>Other food related was, yes,
 we already talked about white gravy, yuck.
 It's not gravy, it's flour and white stuff.
  </li><li>Wait, wait, wait, wait, you've lost me.
 Your number two is you're arguing about gravy.
  </li><li>Yeah, well sort of.
  </li><li>So white gravy is not gravy.
  </li><li>Other wonderful foods.
 So my number one was these vegetables I did not know existed.
 Number two, continuing on food theme is weird foods that I've encountered here.
 So white gravy versus brown gravy.
 Why, why would, why?
 Right.
 I think you just admit that white gravy, the biscuits and gravy isn't gravy.
 It's not gravy.
 It's a completely.
 And I'd be fine if people just called it biscuits with lumpy white sauce or liquidized
 sausage.
 (laughs)
 Which granted I don't like sausage either.
 But I understand from talking to people today.
 Do you like breakfast sausage?
 No.
 Oh.
 That some white gravy has sausage in it
 and some is just flour and milk.
 Well, that's not gravy.
 So that's all I wanna say about that.
 So, and when we moved here
 and I would order gravy at a restaurant,
 and I love gravy, I mean, I love gravy,
 When the white stuff would show up,
 I would get so confused because I think it's wrong
 that it's called gravy.
  </li><li>You start asking for brown gravy
 and getting weird looks.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then they'd be like, we don't have that.
 I'm like, okay, then don't say you have gravy.
  </li><li>Yeah, I just had a one person mission
 to educate the South.
 Is there other weird foods in that category?
  </li><li>Yes, I felt like everything got made into a casserole.
 Like there was so many--
  </li><li>Grieving casserole?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Sweet potato casserole?
  </li><li>So when we first moved here,
 We got invited to tons of people's houses for food and we have lots of casseroles and I don't think I'd ever eaten
 Casseroles as like a we even had mac and cheese casserole. Yeah all kinds of casseroles
 I mean it just felt like you know anything could be hiding in there. What what makes a casserole a casserole?
 I have no idea. Maybe you cook it in a casserole dish and ta-da. It's a casserole
 Usually it's got some kind of sauce and usually it's hidden under some kind of cheese. It seems like sounds like an anacolada
  </li><li>But it could be anything in there.
  </li><li>Hmm.
  </li><li>Yeah, so casseroles.
 And then you already mentioned this,
 but I cut you off banana pudding.
 Where was banana pudding all my life?
 Goodness.
 It is so good.
  </li><li>Do you know another thing that's on my list
 that I forgot to mention?
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>That might fit under this?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Is brisket.
 Barbecue brisket.
 I mean, I had brisket before.
  </li><li>Oh, barbecue brisket.
 I mean, yes.
  </li><li>But barbecue brisket?
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause my mom makes a mean brisket,
 but it's a roasted brisket.
  </li><li>She, no.
  </li><li>Fair play, Patricia, you do, you make a very good brisket.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It is not, it's like gravy and gravy.
 Her brisket and--
  </li><li>You're talking smoked brisket.
  </li><li>Two different things.
  </li><li>Oh, so good.
  </li><li>But we never had that before.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So we move here.
  </li><li>Yeah, and that's why we need a smoker.
 So we can provide ourselves with more red meat.
  </li><li>Oh, Santa's coming, babe.
 (laughing)
 Yeah, the carnivore diet.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Oh, number three would be the American thing
 of celebrating everything.
 I remember--
 Southern thing or that's just an American thing, but you discovered it by living in the South.
 Yeah, I mean, I don't know. It might be an American thing or it might be a Southern thing,
 but I remember to begin with, I was like, you're having a graduation party for your kindergartener
 or your preschooler, or like there's, we're having a party or a celebration to celebrate
 anything and everything. And to begin with us, I don't get it. And then I thought, actually,
 this is brilliant, like celebrating every milestone, even little ones. I mean, the good
 that that must do for little tiny hearts to be celebrated like that. But it took me a
 while, like to begin with, I was just shocked. And I mean, it comes down to everything. I
 I mean, they're going to celebrate every holiday here.
 It just seems like it's sort of more lights, more decorations, more,
 whatever than I've ever seen.
 Um, but I think it goes along with this American thing of actually.
 And kind of celebrate.
 Yeah.
 Celebrating.
 I'm just so good at it.
 So good, which I thought it to begin with found really challenging.
 And then I was like, actually, I need this challenge.
 You know, so it's really good.
 So number four, you already kind of said this, but that people are so warm
 and welcoming.
 And it's not just like the front porch, you know, backfire pit thing,
 but just even just going into normal stores or whatever people strike up
 conversations all the time.
 They're just super kind.
 You don't tend to walk by each other.
 You are raking leaves.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Neighbors walk by and say hello.
 I used to think that was an American thing.
 And then I learned it's not because you got a New York, go to New York City.
 Right. Well, there's no yards to rake in New York City.
 But different. I mean, so here's the thing.
 Anywhere from the UK in America is going to have miles better customer service.
 Yeah, just general. Yeah.
 But then when you saw that's America in general, but then you're right.
 When you moved to the south, I don't know if it's more
 more genuine, more frequent, more culturally the norm.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But yes, people are sing song and friendly.
  </li><li>Yeah, and like you wouldn't think anything of
 if somebody walks by you with like a little toddler
 and you go, "Oh, she's so beautiful," or whatever.
 Like that would be totally normal thing to do.
 And nobody would look at you like you, psycho or, you know,
 whatever, which you probably wouldn't necessarily do
 as much in other places.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So anyway, I just thought that really struck me the sort of friendliness of everybody.
 And then number five was big thinking.
 I think there's, and maybe this is an American thing as well, maybe not just a Southern thing,
 but just the thing of like, hey, this sky's the limit.
 I think I trained myself to think reasonable things,
 have reasonable dreams, that kind of thing.
 And it feels like what's in the air here is
 you could do anything.
 Yeah, so that was my number five,
 was just a challenge of big thinking.
  </li><li>I also think about like we just personally,
 we've seen that big thinking lived out
 in many of our friends lives, where they don't just have a dream, they head towards that
 dream and something happens. And that's remarkable to see. All right, well, there is our five things
 that we did not know about the South till we lived in the South. There you go. Let us know what we
 missed. If you live in the South, I wonder if because you live in the South, these will sound
 normal to you because it's all you've ever known. Well, but so many people have migrated here.
 That's true that they might have different experience.
 What do we miss?
 Yeah, yeah.
 What do we miss?
 Plenty.
 I mean, like four of ours were about food.
 So, you know, if you're not a foodie, there might have been other things that we're
 impressed upon you.
 Yeah.
 Um, well, we didn't even touch the love of hunting and football.
 We didn't even get into rivalry.
 We don't know anything about hunting or football.
 Really?
 You're a hunter now.
 You've got a bow and arrow.
 You're going to go bull hunting elk.
 It's going to be awesome.
 Oh, yes. No, I've been told that a hunting bow,
 like my bow has 20 pounds of pressure and a hunting bow has upwards of 55,
 I think 55. I think of the brews you can get with that.
 I can't imagine the brews. I think I would have just dropped to my knees.
 I have a listen's question. Yes. That is so good. Oh,
 and I'm going to let you answer it. Okay. No pressure.
 And it's a brilliant question. All right. Yeah.
 And it is, I'm so sorry that you did send this in
 and it's taking me a while to get to it.
 But I've loved it, right?
 So here's the question.
 Hey guys, I've got a question regarding one of Alan
 and AJ's favorites, Zelda.
 My boys have started playing the game with my husband.
 There are elements that I really like about it,
 like the Exploring and Problem Solving.
 However, I don't love that they go to shrines
 and wing things called "spirit orbs" and other "new-agey" I guess you could call it "nots".
 They're also getting into Pokemon cards.
 My husband says that these things like potions and magic wands are in most all of video games.
 I'm just trying to know how to guide my kids to be wise about witchcraft without making it weird.
 I don't want to be the super sheltering mom,
 and I also don't want them to be confused about play magic and real magic.
 I wasn't into much of this growing up,
 And I don't want to make decisions about it out of fear, but out of wisdom.
 We'd love to hear your insight on how you make these decisions about what's
 okay in regards to games for your kids and how you talk to them about it.
 Thank you guys.
 Good question.
 Well, I'll start by saying I don't really know much about Pokemon.
 OK.
 I never got into Pokemon.
 I do remember hearing some sermons about not getting into Pokemon.
 I don't remember what they said.
 So I can't really speak about that.
 Zelda.
 So there are parts that I don't love.
 I don't love that it's called a spirit orb, but for me, those things are not real
 like spells and things like that.
 Those can be real things.
 Spirit orbs are not a real thing.
 It's a thing that got made up for this game.
 And while they call them shrines, they're basically giant puzzles.
 You don't go in there and Zelda doesn't worship anything or link or whatever.
 He just runs through and solves a puzzle in that the end, he gets this circular thing called a spirit orb.
 So for me, that doesn't, it doesn't really trigger anything.
 I don't love the whole scene where the because they're basically like a little guy.
 I don't know what you even call the guy, a little monk sitting there who gives the
 spirit orb and then he like disintegrates because I don't love that visual.
 I just fast forward it.
 Like we just skip the visuals of that.
 Um, and so for me, yeah, most of the game is running around, exploring, making foods,
 but there, um, let me, let me play devil's advocate here because there's
 Also, the overarching thing is that, you know, in the history of Zelda, there's the goddess
 Hylia.
 Right.
 We don't like goddesses.
 Right.
 Right.
 We have a god.
 Yeah.
 You do trade the spirit orbs in by praying at a statue.
 Yeah.
 So there's something like there's some really questionable stuff there.
 Sure.
 That I'm so curious isn't a stumbling block to you.
 I think I know why.
 I'm so curious to ask you about like, what is that?
  </li><li>I think because none of it registers as a real thing for me.
 I'm praying is a real thing,
 but like trading in again,
 nebulous orbs for a heart,
 you know, like things like that, I'm like, okay.
  </li><li>Or stamina wheel. - Or stamina wheel
 or whatever, like all that to me is just like,
 oh yeah, it's just the story that they've written for the game.
 But there is, I know there's like a little dark guy somewhere where you can trade things in, whatever.
 I never do that.
 I don't do it because I'm just like, that's, I have to do, like I have to finish the shrines to finish the game.
 You don't even, like, you don't even, but I trust the justification.
 Well, I mean, you do the shrines to complete the game.
 I don't actually have to interact with the little dark guy to finish the game.
 Right.
 And you know, there's even a little guy that sells monster parts.
 And I don't go and sell monster parts either.
 Not that monsters are real or that I just don't.
 I like the running around.
 So OK, yeah, but I get that.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>So it's gonna sound like I'm arguing against you.
 I'm just trying to tease out.
 Because we're in the realms of vagueness here.
 Because I could equally bring up
 a completely different franchise
 and apply the same rules that you've given me,
 your internal rules for what's okay and what's not.
 Like Lord of the Rings.
 And you've got a very strong reaction
 to not wanting to be part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
 Don't want the kid watching it, you don't like it.
 And yeah, I could equally argue.
  </li><li>But this for me, they are, it is casting spells
 and chanting and all that kind of stuff.
 It's not, to me, it's not the same thing at all.
  </li><li>So you don't wanna go speak to Kilton,
 who's just made up, but you're happy to pray statue,
 your in-game character,
 you're happy to take your in-game character
 and make him pray, do you know what I mean?
 There's like...
  </li><li>I don't think that's the same thing
 as the Lord of the Rings though.
 I think that's completely different.
 Right, but somebody who's like, we've got lots of friends who are great Christian believers.
 Yeah.
 Fanatical about the Lord of the Rings.
 Yes.
 I haven't read the Lord of the Rings or watched it.
 I was so bored, you know, I was like, what is going on here?
 Yeah.
 All right.
 So I don't have enough to argue about it, but I'm sure the internal rules that you've got
 to keep yourself safe in Zelda could equally be applied to different franchise.
 Now, I'm just, I'm trying to get your thing to break down.
 Maybe to different.
 Yeah, maybe two different video games, maybe.
 You know what I think answers?
 What my guess would be that you're trying to put a rational reason to what you feel in your spirit.
 OK, because my experience of you is I can be playing some music or I can be doing something
 and your spirit is just like, what is that?
 Turn it off without you ever knowing what it is to weigh whether it's good or not.
 Does that make sense? Yeah.
 Like you are so spirit led.
 Like you have like a attuning fork in your spirit.
 Yeah.
 And so yes, on paper, what you've just described about that Zelda game sounds
 horrendous.
 Like, could you imagine knowing nothing about the game and say, oh, yeah,
 my kids are playing this great game and they collect spirit orb from monks in
 shrines and then they trade them in by praying to a goddess and she gives them,
 you know, stamina vessels and heart vessels.
 You'd be like, there's no way my kids going to play that game.
 Right.
 On paper, that sounds absolutely horrible.
 But when your spirit engages while playing the game, it kind of worried me when you picked up the game like, I wonder how she's going to do this.
 And you loved it and it never raised any flags for you.
 Now, and you're a super sensitive spiritual person, my experience of yours.
 You're way more spiritually challenged by environments and content than say I am.
 And I would say I'm fairly sensitive to a lot of stuff.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Right?
 So it was just, it was,
 I'd always wondered, why did that not?
 And there's other video games that I have downloaded
 and I have played and I thought,
 "I can't have this content on here
 "and expose the kids to it."
 And actually on paper, it's not that different from this.
 So why is one okay and one is not?
 I'm like, I'm just trusting my,
 like the big argument that people make is,
 'cause you love the Chronicles of Narnia.
  </li><li>Yes.
 But you don't like Lord of the Rings.
 I'm not a literary person.
 I don't know.
 There's of course, Tolkien and C.S.
 Lewis were friends and it's a fantasy world, but one doesn't
 trouble your spirit and the other does.
 Yes.
 That's what I think is going on.
 I don't know if that's true.
 You're trying to use what your spirit feels and put it into a structured form.
 But the trouble is the structured form can easily be.
 It's easy to point out the inconsistencies in your
 structure form.
 I think if the little guy in the game, if Link in the game had
 to go and cast spells to get a heart or go and whatever,
 I would not play it because that would disturb me.
  </li><li>Right, but praying to a goddess doesn't disturb you.
  </li><li>Well, I guess it does, because--
  </li><li>That's what I'm trying to say, like on April,
 they could be the same.
 'Cause the Bible says, like, you shouldn't have any
 of the gods before me and witchcraft is bad.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And that's what I mean.
 Like it's not something up here that you're rationalizing
 'cause it's inconsistent up here.
 But in here, it's very consistent with,
 like your bead on what's right or wrong
 has stayed consistent the whole time I've known you.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, it doesn't bother me.
 And sometimes, I mean, there's been some other games
 that you've tried playing where I'm literally,
 I can't be in the room.
  </li><li>That's what I mean.
 And you haven't even looked at it to object to maybe the graphical content or the,
 you know, it's just like, whatever that is, could you not play around me?
 Yeah.
 And by and large, if the games I'm thinking of, I haven't continued playing them.
 Yeah.
 So I haven't enjoyed them.
 Yeah.
 But that's, that's what I think is going on.
 Yeah.
 So the, because I can think of movies that you've, that you have maybe two movies,
 and I can't even think of them talk in my head, but I know this has been true
 where we've watched two movies, broadly similar story, broadly similar context,
 and one is fine, and the other's like, "My spirit doesn't feel good about this."
 Yeah.
 And I'm like, "Okay, I trust your nose on that."
 Yeah.
 And if I go down the line of, "Yeah, but why are you like this, and why don't you like that?"
 That's not where the decision is being made up here and down there.
 Yeah.
 So how do we answer this person's question?
 She's a mom.
 She's been disturbed by some content.
 Is this okay?
 What do I do with it?
 Yeah.
 What would your wisdom be?
 I guess talk talk to your husband and arrive at a place together
 Would be my I mean that's the thing Alan and I don't always agree on
 Everything in terms of content or whatever
 But we can hear each other's no especially with the kids like if we're like actually I'm really not I really don't want
 You know that game or to participate or to watch this movie or whatever
 We're we're fine to disagree and still agree that if one of us has a no, then we have a no
 So I would say yeah talk to your spouse and see if you can sort of you know
 It's it sounds like from your question you're able to identify what it is it bothers you
 Yeah, and also listen to what bothers you and take it to the Lord. Yeah, like have you know have a conversation about it like what?
 Hey, Lord, you know my you know
 Is this you is this me is this my you know objections yeah, and and see where that goes
 Boy like we're so much for just throwing to your right brain and just clumsily
 Podcast episode, but that's that's the best I've got in terms of my in terms of my my thinking is
 Following the piece of the Holy Spirit and the radar that comes with that
 Yeah
 But now describing how what you do in Zelda sounds so odd. It does it definitely does yeah, all right
 We're gonna burn every copy of Zelda and I have no one up
 All right, well if you'd like the show notes from this episode go to Allen and AJ calm slash
