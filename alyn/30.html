<p> Hey babe, I believe in miracles.<br/>
 Where are you gone? You sexy thing.<br/>
 It's where you're from, not where you go.
 Okay, try again.<br/>
 Hey babe, I believe in miracles.<br/>
 Where are you from? You sexy thing, sexy thing.
 I'm from Dundee Scotland.<br/>
 I believe in miracles.<br/>
 My birth.<br/>
 Do you know what that is?<br/>
 Do you want that time to us that was our podcast listeners leaving by the drill. Oh, don't come back come back. We didn't mean it
 I wanted jingle. Talk to me about your hair. Okay. What about my hair? Oh
 Yeah, we just sounds like you just choked on it. I did I got all excited
 Your hair I went to a place so they're opening these weird places now that are called blow dry bars
 And you go in and they wash your hair, you know, like washing condition and blow dry. That's it. They don't like
 You know cut it or color it or anything like that. It's just for if you want if you're going out or
 I'm sorry. I fell asleep<br/>
 You're talking about something that has absolutely no relevance to a good 50% population
 Well, the other 50% would be very interested because it was very cool, but fair play you got it done on
 Thursday Thursday and it still looks magnificent. Thank you
 I am gonna wash it tomorrow morning, however, because I just can't go longer than four days. It's not right. Okay. Okay
 And I got a great headband you did darling. Yeah, it says Nike
 Doesn't say Nike, but it actually holds my hair and hasn't slipped off my head and it's been on since six o'clock this morning
 That is remarkable. It's after ten o'clock at night, baby. That's incredible
 Things we suffer as women<br/>
 Sorry go ahead talk to me about what talk about this week let's talk about MJ and his fascination mj is so cute
 What does he love right now right now he just wants you more than more than me or anything else
 There he's just like<br/>
 Attached you like a monkey and I keep forgetting that they go through this face
 They do and what I'm gonna forget is that he's fascinated with me because in a couple of months
 it'll switch and all he'll want is you.
 And I keep forgetting that I had a phase where he wanted me.
 Right.<br/>
 And then I have to remind you and then you go, no, I didn't.
 So this will be good because now it's recorded.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So he just wants me all the time.<br/>
 And it's amazing.<br/>
 I love it.<br/>
 It's so cute.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 He, although it was pretty sad today when I had to take him downstairs,
 because you were preparing for the meeting tonight and he just balled at the top of his
 lungs. He was yelling at the stairs.<br/>
 And that's why we have chocolate.
</p><ul>
  <li>Okay, well I used a puzzle instead.
  </li><li>Okay, good.
 Yeah, that's awesome.
  </li><li>I didn't feed him the puzzle though,
 and I'm too clarify.
  </li><li>I'm very good.
  </li><li>Let's run through a week.
 Monday, you're teaching on song songs?
  </li><li>Yep, song songs Monday and Tuesday.
  </li><li>I like that.
  </li><li>And to see week at the school really well,
 the students were great, it was very fun.
  </li><li>Monday night I taught on the anointing at Amine.
  </li><li>Yes, you did.
  </li><li>Which was fun because I did something I don't know what we do
 in the, I didn't know what I was teaching on till the middle of worship.
 And Jesse early killed it.
 A show of dozen worship.
 Yeah.
 But in the middle of worship, I dropped down a lot of the thoughts I've been
 having on the anointing and I don't have enough thoughts on the anointing as far
 as I'm concerned, but I shared what I had.
 Oh, cool.
 And then Wednesday we had Ryan's birthday.
 Yeah.
 I mean, whatever you, I wasn't there on Monday night, but Tuesday morning, a bunch
 of the students were still drunk from Monday night.
 So, you know, I mean, I'm just thinking about the anointing.
 I've seen an anointing.
 And I think, I think there's a facet of the anointing that I have no comprehension of
 whatsoever.
 So I read a couple of passages that I said, you know, if you, I want you to follow along
 with me and see that they're in your Bible so that you don't think I'm that I'm lying.
 And I just talked about how, you know, that verse where people are burying their friend
 that a band of raiders come in, so they just throw the dead body into a cave and
 have to touch a lysus bones. And as soon as it does, he comes back to life.
 Yeah. Nobody prays for just the anointing, the resitual. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like,
 that's amazing. And then we were looking at, you know, the handkerchiefs that
 touched Paul's body that were handed out to sick people and they got well. And
 then I've seen about the garment, you know, that people just touched the hem of
 Jesus' garment they were healed. And so I started thinking about the anointing as
 of substance that performs miracles without anybody doing anything.
 Yeah.
 And I was just wondering, where is that anointing today?
 That's a good wondering.
 I know.
 It's my great wondering.
 So I'm actually asking the Lord all those questions.
 But anyway, I digress Thursday.
 We had our staff Christmas party.
 We did.
 It was amazing.
 I know Jeff dressed up as a reindeer.
 He's pretty good.
 He was a very tall reindeer.
 It was great to see all our great stuff together.
 It is. And it was lovely. The food was amazing. The people that hosted it were amazing. It was just amazing. It was such a great party.
 We really enjoyed it.
 Yeah.
 Then Friday you started your Christmas shopping, but you didn't really, because you did it all online.
 That's still count-starting. It's still Christmas shopping. It just means that I'm smart enough that I don't have to go and park somewhere and go through crowds.
 You are smart enough.
 Do you want to know what the highlight of my week was?
 what was the highlight of your week that i did not get dressed all day yesterday
 no you did not you i just want to run your boxers i did well my i was in a pajamas but now the secrets i i want to run t-shirt and pair box shorts
 all day you did and all i did was really what i would call nerdy cleaning
 did you even know we had air raiders
 i did know that we have air raiders yes oh come on please give me this do you want me to say i didn't know darling i didn't know we have
  </li><li>All right, what's an aerator?
  </li><li>An aerator is that like sieve thing
 in the bottom of all the faucets.
 Like when you turn on the faucet,
 like where the water comes out there's a--
  </li><li>Do you know what an aerator is?
  </li><li>Of course I know what an aerator is.
 What was I born yesterday?
  </li><li>I didn't know what an aerator was until yesterday.
  </li><li>Oh. (laughs)
 Well, there you go.
  </li><li>When we bought our house, we got a manual for our house.
 And I seemed to remember that when we bought,
 I flipped through, but it was like 200 pages, so I got bored.
 But I thought, I wonder what sort of stuff we should have done.
 And it said we're supposed to clean out our aerators
 every three or four months.
 Well, we've been there for two years
 and I've never done it.
 So I thought, well, let's turn over a new leaf.
 So I went and cleaned out our aerators
 and I didn't even know we had them and it was pretty cool.
 It's the thing that stops your water splattering
 and it mixes your water with air
 so you get a steady stream.
 And, but then I did some, then I got started thinking about,
 I wonder if these are just playing off the shelf pedestrian aerators.
 I wonder if there's like the BMW of aerators.
 So I did some research and apparently there are.
 So this Christmas list is going to get really, really nerdy.
 Ooh, sounds exciting.
 New faucet aerators for Alan.
 If you think that's exciting.
 So basically what I did yesterday was download the PDF manuals of all our home appliances
 that I've never really wondered how they were.
 So for example, our dishwasher turns out we've been using our dishwasher wrong.
 Yes, upside down in fact.
 No.
 So I read this thing on the wire cutter or sweethome.com both sites which I highly recommend.
 And they were saying if your dishwasher isn't working to your satisfaction, here's like
 10 things to check.
 And lo and behold, one of them is that you are rinsing your dishes before you put them
 in.
 Now I was raised that you radically do that you wash the dishes and then load them into
 dishwasher. But newer, more modern dishwashers have an optical sensor that check. And if you
 have rinsed off a lot of the gunk off the dishes, it thinks they're cleaner than they actually are.
 And so this article was suggesting you load them fairly dirty and clean out the filter,
 which I did. And then I made my own cleaning solution out of white vinegar. So I was both
 nerdy and hippie. It looks brand new. It's amazing. But the Piesta resistance.
 Yes, go there baby. What did you do?
 My day at home.
 Oh,
 was I attacked our laundry machine.
 You did.
 I drained, manually drained the pump.
 I removed the filter, which was covered in the most horrendous
 sludge and mold,
 which explains why all our clothes smell like a refugee
 I'm watching a closing beat juice and pee is just a bit i cleaned up slightly over exaggerating well i found our laundry machine has a tub feature where again you're supposed to run it once a month and it self cleans.
 Yes we've only done three times i know so guys if you've ever noticed our clothes now like a.
 Beat juice and be apparently worry not.
 We should be better but anyway that was a high on my week it's amazing how productive I feel when I find obscure tasks I didn't know exist and then do them yes.
 Do you think that's a man thing yes.
 Let's move on.
 Doctor arty kennel was with us this morning he was was great scream isn't he he is so funny.
 You preach a great message on 10 things you to implement to finish well I thought it was excellent it was really really good.
 And then tonight we had our School of Supernatural Life Year 2 information meeting.
 We did.
 Can we talk about that?
 Yeah, it was so fun.
 Yeah, we've been thinking, dreaming, planning up year two for the last two to three years.
 And of course, announced it in October.
 And tonight we had the information meeting where we had, I don't know, between 50 and
 60 students there.
 previous year one graduates who are interested in year two. And so we had our
 information meeting with them and just had some nice desserts and hung out and
 it was so nice to see all their faces again. It was great to see everybody.
 Yeah. All right, our topic for discussion this week. I want to hear about your crazy
 Canadian Christmas traditions. Crazy Canadian. Well, not crazy Canadian ones, but
 your family traditions. What was Christmas like going up in your house? Well, we
 I guess we had a bunch, some, most of them revolve around food, I suppose.
 Like we always had tortilla at Christmas.
 We always have what?
 Tortilla is basically a meat pie.
 It wasn't my fave.
 But we always had tortilla.
 We would, at the cottage, we would go and my grandparents had a,
 it had like a 19 foot ceiling.
 And so we would go and this tree farm would help us find the tallest tree
 tallest tree that we possibly could. And it would take all of us to go. We'd
 tromped through the snow and we'd cut it down and then we'd all get in between
 the branches and pull the tree and then they'd put it on top of the vehicle and
 we'd dry it would be like a whole day event but we'd go and get the tree. And
 then the little kids decorated the bottom and the bigger kids the middle and my
 sister always decorated the top. Can I just say that nothing about lessons
 appealing whatsoever? I was so funny. It was so fun. It was freezing gold
 well, to pull down a 19 foot tree.
 Yeah, it was great.
 And then the decorating took forever because it was like the world's most massive
 tree. Yeah.
 You guys didn't have Nintendo when you were young?
 No.
 But it was the worst video game ever.
 And then, yeah.
 And then we put out crushes and all that kind of stuff.
 Grandma's place was very fun at Christmas.
 Talk to me about Christmas morning because I have noticed that there's some
 weirdos out there that will get up and not open the presents till the end
 of the day. Like, are you kidding me right now? Were you one of those weirdos?
 No. Well, first of all, I wanted to tell you that my dad at Christmas used to like to disguise
 presents because he, if you shook it or whatever, he wanted you to have no idea what was in there.
 And the pinnacle of that particular thing, which he would try and disguise things every year,
 was one year they bought a stereos. And both Evan and I got the same thing as stereo. And he had the
 place stamp on it, keep refrigerated. So when I got delivered to the house, we thought they'd
 gotten something large that had to be kept refrigerated. Other times he'd poke holes in boxes and have
 like right on the side, because we were kids, we wouldn't realize that stuff like make sure it
 has air and whatever. So he liked to disguise presents. So I've been thinking about ways of
 disguising the girl's presents, because it won't work for MJ, but it would be fun to do
 to the kids.
 Sure.
 Let's lie in traumatizing.
 Well, no, not lying traumatizing, but they're already trying to figure out what things are.
 So I think we need to step it up a notch, couple of rocks in a box and then one little
 present, that kind of thing.
 Yeah.
 It'll be great.
 Yeah.
 Set them up for disappointment.
 I like where this is headed.
 [laughter]
 Mommy and Dad are getting into the horse for Christmas.
 Surprise.
 We're numb.
 [laughter]
 That's horrible.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 So we, uh, we would get up in the morning and we would have our stockings, but we weren't
 We were able to get up early.
 So we would get up at like eight or whatever the normal time was.
 And we would have our stockings.
 Was there anything consistent that was always in your stocking?
 Always an orange.
 Yep.
 Um, always some kind of chocolate.
 Not chocolate coins?
 No, because we don't really have, we didn't really have good chocolate coins in Canada.
 But always a Clementine orange, always some kind of chocolate.
 Um, and that's a bit of, like the girls had earrings.
 or hair things, or stuff like that.
 But we have socks underwear, that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>Socks underwear?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>They're like essentials, they're not Christmas gifts.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>Hey, congratulations, I bought you some underwear.
 Okay, feels like Christmas now, let's get this party started.
  </li><li>Take the girls underwear back, got it.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>So then what would happen?
 You're opening up your stockings privately in your own room,
 hopefully if you're getting underwear.
  </li><li>No, no, no.
 We are stockings were always out in the main room.
 No.
 Yeah, Jana and all of them got to open up their stockings
 in their room, which seemed very dignified and lovely.
 And even though that's what they got to do,
 we still had to wait and open our stockings
 in front of everybody else, out on the couches.
 But that's because my mom never fit everything
 in the stockings, so she'd buy other presents
 and put those as stockings presents, but they weren't.
 All right.
 In our family, the stockings would magically appear
 at the end of our bed.
 And we could get up as early as we want.
 Or maybe that wasn't the rule and I just did it anyway,
 but nobody seemed to care.
 We'd get up and we would open up our stockings
 on our own in our bedroom without anybody else there.
 And once we'd opened them all up,
 we'd take them upstairs and show our parents
 the spoils of Christmas war.
 And we'd all climb in a bed.
 Dad would pretend to be frustrated
 that we were all climbing in bed.
 And so there'd be my mom and my dad
 for most of my childhood, just me and my two sisters because Claire didn't come along to
 Labs 10. And we'd, same thing, always have a Clementine orange. We'd always have a bag of
 chocolate coins, which is quite rare to find in America. They were everywhere in Britain.
 There would always be a magazine for each of us. There would always be a Bible reading
 for each of us. So that was our equivalent of underwear. Yeah.
 Like a gift that I suppose I should be grateful for, but I'm not. And what else would there
 there would be that there would be the consistent things and then there would be, you know,
 I kind of remember what else it was. They were just the staples.
 So we've adopted some of that for ours, haven't we? Our stockings?
 Yes, we have.
 That our new Jones family stockings, we always have a magazine of some sort.
 Right.
 And we have, we only have coins if I remember to ask your mother to send them, but we have
 oranges. We have chocolate. We have underwear socks.
 I usually do. I put one Barrett socks and everybody's thing.
 What else do we have?
  </li><li>Right, well, skip that part.
 Once you've opened your stockings, then what do you do?
 Then do you all open your big presents
 while food is being made?
  </li><li>No, then we used to have to go and have breakfast.
  </li><li>That's just wrong. - Which was like torture
 because you ate right next to the tree.
 And so as a kid, you're looking at this tree that's,
 I mean, there'd be like 20 of us up at the cottage.
 So that, I mean, it's piled high with presents.
  </li><li>She already, I'm twitching.
 I don't wanna do Christmas with 20 other people.
  </li><li>It was so great.
 As a kid, I loved it.
 Oh, it was so great.
 And, but it was like the longest breakfast ever
 'cause we had to eat.
 We always had this egg thing with ham
 and a cream sauce or something.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh. - I have.
  </li><li>Yeah. - What did they do to you?
 You're like a prisoner of war.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah, you don't get your presents,
  </li><li>Maybe this egg cream ham thing.
  </li><li>Or you could have cream of wheat or pork.
  </li><li>Cream of wheat?
  </li><li>Yeah, it's like a--
  </li><li>You can milk wheat and then like churn it
 and it turns into a cream.
  </li><li>No, it's like a porridge, you kinda like grits.
 It's like Canadian grits.
 Disgusting, anyway.
  </li><li>Let me tell you how crispy it is.
  </li><li>So wait, no, I'm not feeling so refreshed.
  </li><li>And then-- - I'm redeeming
 your miserable childhood.
  </li><li>No, let me tell you what happened.
 So then we would all sit down, we all have places
 that we sat and we would all have a box next to us.
  </li><li>And then you'd take care of stuff.
 where your stuff would go.
  </li><li>You'd be great into the shoes.
  </li><li>The little tiny kids pipe down over their Jones.
 The little tiny kids, whoever the youngest ones were,
 were named the elves,
 and they would bring a couple presents to grandpa
 and grandpa would read out the name of each person.
 So I'd say this is from so-and-so to so-and-so.
  </li><li>I'm bored already.
  </li><li>And then the elves would take the present to someone.
 So we would all watch it get opened,
 and then the elves would bring the next one.
 grandpa would read it.
 And here's my problem with that.
 All people take too long to read things and elves take too long to deliver things
 to set old person.
 Well, it made Christmas like we we unwrapped Christmas for like eight hours.
 It was so much.
 Oh my gosh.
 A hour.
 What did you just played with?
 Whatever you'd opened in between.
 All right.
 Let me tell you how it should have been.
 Oh.
 So we finished opening up stockings in my parents room.
 Yeah.
 And then we descended and living where all the big toys are.
 and then it's a free for all.
 Meanwhile, my mother is making us breakfast
 and bringing us through in a trolley.
 We all eat together.
 And typically there's a cup of tea once the chocolate,
 so let's be honest, breakfast was chocolate.
 Then you would just open up all your presents
 in a haphazard fashion and play with them
 to your heart's content and not get dressed.
 Then the queen speech, which nobody really watched,
 and then an Indiana Jones movie.
 And then a nap, and then get up,
 and then eat dinner, and then go to bed.
 That's Christmas day. Let me ask you, did you have boxing day?
 Yes. Did you call a boxing day? Yes. Do you know that Americans don't know what boxing
 day is? Yes.
 Is there any other questions you had to ask me? No, I'm done.
 Well, so eight hours of opening presents with elves, maybe like 20 grandpa.
 There was 20 of us there. It was fun. Oh my God. And then you knew what everybody got.
 I don't care what it be else at all.
 But for me, darling, as a gift giver, which several of our family is gift givers, to see
 the other person open the present, see the reaction and enjoy it, if everybody just dives
 into the tree and grabs stuff and rips it apart, then you don't actually get to see
 other people's reactions to what you spent time thinking about getting them.
 That makes sense in a weird, twisted sort of way.
 Okay.
 I guess it's better than having to eat, grow, or...
  </li><li>Well, it's a we do kind of a version of both, don't we?
  </li><li>No, we don't.
  </li><li>The stockings, they get put at the end of their bed,
 but the girls always want to open them with us.
 So they drag them in and we all get on our bed.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we all open our stockings together.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And then we go downstairs and we have quick breakfast.
  </li><li>I don't recall having breakfast.
 I recall just being completely fixated
 on Christmas presents.
  </li><li>Are you talking recently or when you were a small child?
 No, we always have breakfast.
  </li><li>Right, but it's usually chocolate.
  </li><li>What?
 I usually make like pancakes or muffins or some things.
  </li><li>Right, but I've eaten chocolate.
 So like your breakfast is like second breakfast.
  </li><li>Okay, well, if we're gonna do that,
 that's almost every day that you've eaten chocolate.
 It's just that you try and hide it better.
 It's not Christmas.
 So, and then we do presents one by one,
 but we don't do like the Santa thing.
 We just get happy to pick one up and read it.
 We don't do elves.
 just sort of do, okay, who's that one to?
 Okay, great, open it and let,
 and we try and balance out that all the kids aren't
 opening all theirs at the same time or whatever.
 So we kind of do a version of both mixed together.
  </li><li>You have a Christmas tradition that you introduced.
  </li><li>I love my Christmas tradition.
  </li><li>Where did it come from?
  </li><li>The pajama tradition.
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>The pajama tradition?
  </li><li>The pajama tradition.
  </li><li>Well, it came from, first of all,
 everybody needs new pajamas every year.
 So once a year you get new pajamas, but basically it was so that you get to open one present the night before.
 What is it with you that thinks wrapping up essential items,
 constitute presents, look kids, you got pajamas, which by your own admission,
 everyone needs new pajamas.
 And look, you got underwear.
 Well, that's your Christmas day pajamas.
 I don't know.
 I just, I heard it somewhere and I thought, oh, that's cute.
 I'm going to do that.
 Find a Barrett tradition.
 Please tell me that there was something more
 redemptive than Christmas gruel.
 Talk to me about Christmas food.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, no, my, I mean, my mom was great.
  </li><li>Wait, yes or no?
 What do you want?
  </li><li>Mm-hmm, my mom is a great cook.
 We would have turkey, turkey was always good,
 the stuffing was always good,
 there was always loads of potatoes and gravy
 and all that kind of good stuff.
 Like just, you know, your typical,
 I guess what we'd have here on Thanksgiving.
 But we didn't have ham, thank God, on Christmas,
 we would have turkey because I'm a ham hater, a hater of ham.
 That's your Jewish roots, baby.
 Ham despiser, a mater.
 Sorry, but I'm trying to think this year because I'm, I don't love turkey.
 I think I'll make us a chicken.
 I don't want to be crazy, but I'd really like some Asian food for Christmas this year.
 Huh?
 Asian food from the Orient.
 What kind of Asian food do you want?
 I want some Thai foods.
 We can't anywhere having friends over for Christmas dinner.
 I know, but you could make it.
 Yeah.
 And you want me to make Asian food for Christmas?
 Yeah.
 Should we should invite some different people over then?
 Maybe some Asians.
 Like I'm bored of the normal, like rose chicken, rose potatoes, roast, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
 OK.
 I want some pizzazz, some spice.
 What if I like made all free-stride food?
 what's while you want to say that i'm just trying to think different
 right outside the box does not
 it's a little further than ready made freeze dried food little further outside
 the box that so you don't want to do asian food now how about i'm in charge of
 the menu to know absolutely not
 it's in control issues tell you what you can do the leftover day and you can
 make it into eat.
 You're so gracious.
 Thank you for gifting me with leftover day.
 I'll make you some chicken fried rice at some point.
 Thanks.
 You know what I'm craving right now?
 Pad Thai.
 Nope.
 Shreddies.
 Shreddies.
 Yep.
 Breakfast cereal.
 Have you had shreddies at any point in the last, I don't know, 10 years?
 I have not.
 Right.
 I'm begging somebody from England, Scotland, Ireland or Wales, to ship me over a pack
 of shreddies. I am not to. I in turn will ship you something from the United States of equal
 awesomeness. But not chocolate because we all know the chocolate. No, but you just
 stuff in America that you just can't get at home. Like what? Dark chocolate M&amp;Ms. Well,
 that's true, but it's still American dark chocolate. How about it tastes good? Yeah,
 that's good. What about a jar of fluff? I have no idea what you're talking about. It is
 -It's a spreadable marshmallow fluff.
 -And you buy it here?
 -You buy it here.
 It's a jar of spreadable marshmallow.
 Who wouldn't want that?
 -I don't.
 -I will trade somebody a jar of fluff for Vox Australia.
 -There you have it.
 Ladies and gentlemen, a jar of fluff coming for you.
 -Hit me up on Twitter.
 -Hey, I'm pretty sure it's not going to go bad or anything
 because it's probably not actually food.
 -Hey, you don't want the bag of shreddies?
 -What?
 well i'm at the fluff you want to back up for either now i don't right so this is
 a negotiation between me and the discerning
 it's
 her
 okay
 connozour
 go for it
 all right let's wrap up this christmas conversation what was boxing day like for
 you for americans boxing days the twenty six of december
 not quite sure it's why it's called boxing day
 i'm sure could look up on wikipedia
 if i remember to help it a link in the show notes boxing day in canada is the
 equivalent of Black Friday and US.
 It's your sales.
 It's your sales.
 Like you're, oh, they've slashed it.
 You know, it's 80% off.
 It's just that.
 Did you say they slapped it or slashed it?
 Slashed it.
 Okay.
 It's just did a picture of them slapping stuff.
 No.
 So you would like, if you got gift cards or you had saved up money to buy something, you
 know, boxing day is the day you go up.
 But people don't go crazy and line up at three in the morning or anything.
 You just go at a reasonable hour, like nine or 10.
 us because Canadians are so civilized. Yes, very civilized. Boxing Day. Boxing Day in the UK,
 or at least in my version of the UK, was almost like a do-over of Christmas, but without the
 presents. It's not like you had more presents, but because you had toys from the day before
 you just play with those. And there's usually some great movies on that you would watch,
 and it was an opportunity to just kind of gorge yourself with food. And then you'd have family
 and friends stop by and say hi to that sort of stuff.
 But you didn't go shopping?
 Well, I never, because I was a kid, but one could.
 But mostly it was another day of playing and unwinding.
 I really liked Boxing Day.
 We don't do anything on Boxing Day.
 Typically, we see in our pajamas.
 Pajamas are featured heavily in this week's podcast.
 Pyjamas.
