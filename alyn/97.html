<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 Better than last week.<br/>
 Yeah, you sound much better than last week.
 Yes.<br/>
 Well, I guess major antibiotics will do that.
 Yay, friend to Biotics.<br/>
 Yay.<br/>
 I just wish they were easier to swallow.
 They're like the sides of a horse pill.
 Talk to me about this week.<br/>
 It was a good week.<br/>
 I still spent a couple days in bed before fully recovering.
 But the students are all back, aren't they?
 Yay.<br/>
 And they shared a church this morning.
 Right.<br/>
 70 staff and students in seven different places around the world.
 They did the whole service this morning.
 I was super proud of them.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah, it's so good.<br/>
 And you spoke last Monday night.<br/>
 I stayed home with sickness.<br/>
 I spoke on the baptism of the Holy Spirit, which I heard was amazing.
 I cannot possibly comment.<br/>
 No, but I did hear it was amazing.<br/>
 And lots of people came up to get prayer for Baptist and the Holy Spirit.
 You were a chapter for a new book.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 You want to talk about this new book?<br/>
 Um, yeah.<br/>
 Uh, a couple of weeks ago, Patricia King, I just shot me an email and said, Hey,
 I'm doing this book for women.<br/>
 I think it's some sort of a devotional book or something.
 And I'm wondering if you would contribute a chapter.
 And so I prayed about it for a few days and then emailed her back.
 my idea of what I'd like to talk about.
 And she said, "That would be fantastic."
 So, and then I promptly got sick.<br/>
 So I was stressed about how much time I had
 to write the chapter with having two weeks to write it.
 And then I got sick for 10 days.<br/>
 So I actually wrote it in a day.<br/>
 And it turned out really well.<br/>
 So that's sort of miraculous for me<br/>
 'cause writing doesn't usually come that easy for me.
 We also want to see the Batman Superman movie.
 Yes, we did.<br/>
 Don't of justice.<br/>
 And there was nobody in the theater.<br/>
 What did you think of the movie?<br/>
 I really liked it.<br/>
 So did I.<br/>
 I don't understand why everybody was so negative.
 I don't know.<br/>
 I mean, it's not a Marvel comics.<br/>
 It doesn't have much of the light-hearted stuff in it.
 But they did a great job.<br/>
 I thought all the acting was fantastic.
 I thought Jesse Eisenberg was superb.<br/>
 Yeah, he really was.<br/>
 But two fun.<br/>
 Yeah, I thought everybody was great.<br/>
 -Yes.<br/>
 -I love that, and this isn't a spoiler really, but it's set when Batman's been Batman for
 20 plus years.<br/>
 -Yes.<br/>
 -I love seeing that side of a weary, grumpy superhero.
 -Superhero.<br/>
 -Yes.<br/>
 -The diet that we were talking about last week, we've now finished.
 -Yes.<br/>
 -How happy are you?<br/>
 -I'm so happy.<br/>
 It's really funny because we have some friends that are on Saturday, we're just starting
 the whole 30.<br/>
 I'm sure for them that felt like, "Oh, this is going to be super restrictive," but for
 I was so excited because I'm like, we can eat whole 30.
 It's a whole new world.<br/>
 Look at all the food we can eat.<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 Because for the next 30 days, we have to maintain the weight we've got to.
 Yes.<br/>
 How much weight did you lose in total?
 26 pounds as staggering as that is.<br/>
 How much did you lose off your waist?<br/>
 Five inches.<br/>
 Five inches.<br/>
 If you have never gotten back, no, you're not.
 Last to cuddle.<br/>
 I'm OK with that.<br/>
 There's so plenty of me left.<br/>
 What about you, babe?<br/>
 I lost 44 pounds.<br/>
 Yeah, you did.<br/>
 And four inches off my waist.<br/>
 Come on.<br/>
 And, you know, in this whole thing of maintaining our way, we now have to eat at, I guess,
 it's pretty much Paleo, really.<br/>
 I've never, I've been so happy to eat almonds though.
 Right.<br/>
 Sad, sad world.<br/>
 It is a sad world.<br/>
 So normally, babe, we talk about a topic.
 Yes.<br/>
 At this point of the podcast.<br/>
 Yes, we do.<br/>
 This week, we're doing something different.
 Yes.<br/>
 Because we're thrilled to have some friends with us today.
 Yes, we are.<br/>
 Henry and Alex Seeley all the way from Nashville.
 6th and Henry are the senior pastors and leaders of the Belonging and amazing church
 up in Nashville.<br/>
 And we've had the real privilege of getting to know them in the last couple of years.
 And just recently they came to the school of supernatural life, blew our students away.
 And we've been scheming this for a while.
 Yes.<br/>
 And we're so excited that you guys are here.
 Thank you so much for making time in your schedule to come and speak on keeping up with
 the Joneses.<br/>
 It's awesome.<br/>
 We're glad to be here.<br/>
 Yeah, we are so excited to be here.<br/>
 You guys have got an amazing story.<br/>
 And there's so much to cover that I'm not sure we're going to get it all covered, but
 I want to start seemingly backwards.<br/>
 I want to start with the belonging because you guys just celebrated your second anniversary.
 You've been running for two years.<br/>
 And it is fair to say that your church has blown up in the best possible way.
 And it's an incredible church.<br/>
 It's full of life.<br/>
 It's full of vibrancy and to go from nothing, no church existing two years ago to where
 you are now is unbelievable.<br/>
 I'm sure the envy of many pastors in Nashville.
 So tell us about how all that started and we'll pick your brains as we go along.
 Well, we moved to Nashville April 2012, so almost four years ago now.
 And we had been part of a large church, a large movement back in Australia and thought
 that we were going to stay there forever, had been with our pastors for 20 years since
 we were teenagers.<br/>
 Both Alex and I met in the youth ministry there and it came on staff with our pastors
 and work with them for a long time.<br/>
 And then a few years ago, God just really began to stir us
 about moving to Nashville.<br/>
 And I had loved Nashville because we had kind of come
 through and to adhere, but I swore that we would never,
 never leave Melbourne.<br/>
 We loved Australia so much.
</p><ul>
  <li>Never tell well for you that.
  </li><li>Yeah, exactly.
 I kind of only ever made two promises to the Lord.
 One was that we would never move to Nashville.
 And the second was that we would never pastor a church.
  </li><li>You know, we got a great teaching on Interfiber.
 I was, you guys might want to see it.
 We need that.
 Yes, but we honestly had no idea the Holy Spirit began
 to stir us and we said the only way we would move to the US
 to Nashville was if we got green cards in the lottery,
 which you guys probably don't know anything about.
 But every year the US government does what they call
 a diversity visa lottery and they give away
 a certain amount of green cards.
 Which is incredible if you think about it.
 And it's, I mean, it literally is one in a million kind of odds, maybe, you know,
 greater odds than that.
 And so the year that we applied, uh, we went through the whole process,
 waited the six months and then they drew it and we didn't get it.
 And at first we were excited because we thought that meant we got to stay in
 Australia, but we felt like God had really spoken to us about moving.
 And then three days later, I was away on tour in, uh, Germany and I got a random
 email in the middle of the night and I started reading it and went, "This is a scam.
 I'm going to delete this."
 The email said, stated that it was from the US State Department and mentioned something
 about them messing up the whole lottery.
 They were going to cancel the whole thing in Detroit.
 That's bad, isn't it?
 I was like, "Yeah, how could the government mess something up like this?"
 We'll just leave that there.
 They did.
 They somehow messed up the whole thing.
 They canceled it and they redrew it three months later
 and we got selected in the redraw.
 And that really was it for us.
 We had made a promise to the law
 that if we got our green cards in the lottery,
 that would be the only way.
 And so we moved on that, sold everything we had.
 And we kept asking God, what were we gonna do
 when we got there?
 And he just said, you just need to go with nothing,
 but my power and my presence.
 And I'll show you the rest when you get there.
 And so we moved.
  </li><li>That's because he was probably thinking,
 if I tell you about that little vow
  </li><li>I'm about not fastering right now.
  </li><li>1,000%.
  </li><li>1,000%.
  </li><li>I'm also gonna pause you there
 because you told, and I appreciate your telling the story
 for speed, but there is so much to unpack there.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, you just glibly say,
 so we sold everything and moved.
 You moved about as far away as you possibly could
 from Australia.
  </li><li>Pretty much.
  </li><li>It's the other side of the world.
  </li><li>It is.
  </li><li>And you sold everything.
 I mean, do you ever stop?
 I remember speaking to Heidi and Roland Baker
 that many of our listeners will know who that is.
 And they, I remember they said, we see no sacrifice in our life.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>We feel like we haven't sacrificed a thing.
 It's all reward.
 And we're like, Heidi, you live among the poor
 in the poorest nation.
 What do you mean?
 Do you feel the same thing that, because on paper,
 if you sit to somebody who hadn't been primed by that,
 hey, you know what?
 I feel like the Lord is saying,
 "Sell everything and have moved to this other world."
 That's a massive jump.
 Looking back on that, do you feel like that sacrifice
 or big or?
  </li><li>I don't, I mean, there's been moments along the way
 when we've realized, you know, it's kind of like God closes your eyes to the reality of some of the journey of it until, you know, you can look back in hindsight and go, wow, we actually, it was a much bigger deal than we even realized at the time.
 Right.
 But, you know, God is so gracious that he always, he'll always set you up for that next season.
 And so for the few years before we left, you know, I'd been on staff, heading up all our creative stuff for our church and our ministry in a few years before that.
 God had really clearly talked to me about coming off staff, which at the time didn't make any sense.
 But what, you know, now looking back, realizing that God had to take us through these two years of us really walking by faith without a wage before we could leave Australia.
 And to see the faithfulness of God through, you know, the first year off staff was our greatest year financial financially that we'd ever had.
 The second year was the most challenging year that we'd ever had.
 and just watching God just be this constant
 through the midst of the whole journey
 and knowing that that had to happen
 so that we could be in a place of being able
 to trust him 100%.
 So when he said go, we were like, well, we can.
 We've seen you provide when it's great,
 we've seen you provide when we've gone nothing.
 And so it's definitely been a sense of the reward
 of knowing that you're walking in the midst
 of the plans of God for your life.
 I mean, you wouldn't want anything else.
  </li><li>Right.
 It's amazing how all of the Lord's plans
 make sense in hindsight.
 But going forward, it has to require faith
 or it wouldn't be the Lord.
 But when you get to the other world and you look back,
 you're like, "Oh, it totally makes sense
 "what that was about."
 So sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you,
 but there was just so much.
  </li><li>It's funny too, 'cause there's the dynamic
 of lots of people wait for every door to open
 before they'll agree to walk through it.
 And God's actually looking for us to step out in faith
 open in order to open the doors. So anyway, I love that.
 That was one of the greatest challenges, I think, being on the other side, being here,
 because there was talk from people that didn't understand that process to say, "I don't know
 if God calls you out of something into nothing." And so there was this struggle for us to actually
 we have to go and pursue God on the matter
 and hear for ourselves that he just wanted
 absolute obedience to God and not to man.
 And so that was huge because that's true.
 People wait for this door to open and I'll go through that
 and that's the next entry point,
 but sometimes God wants us in like a desert, if you like.
  </li><li>Right, when I can clearly see how all the finances
 are gonna be provided and where we're gonna live
 and blah, blah, blah, well, then I'll get on the plane
 and God's like, no, get on the plane.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then I'll show you the rest.
  </li><li>I think man's nothing looks different to God's nothing.
 You know, like man looks at him and goes,
 well you're going to nothing and God's like,
 no, you're going to something.
 You just haven't seen it yet.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, it's not necessarily been done before.
 It's not necessarily, you know,
 it hasn't played out in the natural yet,
 but it's already happened in the supernatural.
 And I think it's kind of when you get on that,
 that on board with that kind of thinking.
 You know, and I remember I saw when we first moved,
 we for a few months,
 And it was a lot of culture shock, I think, especially because when you move from a Western
 country to another Western country, you'll speak essentially the same language.
 And because we've been here so many times over the years, I think I thought it was going to be
 easier than it was. Because it was on the surface, everything is the same. But the systems here and
 all that sort of stuff was just so very different for us. It definitely took us a season to really
 acclimate and you know and in all of that not knowing what we were going to be doing.
 But through that season we started to meet a lot of musicians who were traveling on the
 weekend, loved the Lord with all their heart, out doing amazing things for God but because
 they were gone so many weekends a year you know and they would leave Nashville on a Wednesday
 or Thursday be out on the road to maybe Sunday night Monday.
 And so a lot of these guys just didn't have a place for community and really didn't have
 of a place where they were being poured into.
 And so I think for Alex and I having been,
 you know, in that kind of pastoral leadership position
 for, you know, I guess 20 years,
 feeling like we had so much to pour back into people
 the whole time looking for a home church ourselves,
 but we were like, we've got a lot to,
 let's just, you know, let's just pour back into these guys.
 And so we started opening up our home
 on a Tuesday night every other week.
 And the first week we had seven people and, you know,
 And we, you know, it was an incredible night.
 And these were just people you'd met.
 So these seven people are just people,
 you're in a relationship like,
 hey guys, come on over.
 We just took a couple new friends.
 Some people we just met for the first time
 and they shared their grievance.
 So it's not finding community.
 So are they just coming out?
 Because it is a very, for people who don't live in Nashville,
 it's, I remember when my parents got here,
 they didn't understand that people,
 well they did for a living and they don't understand,
 it's a transient, even week by week it's transient
 because when touring season picks up,
 Like you say, you load on a tour bus Thursday,
 you know, about till Monday,
 and that's your life for a good couple of months.
 And then when you're home,
 you're doing whatever work you can pick up,
 and then you're out with a different band.
 And so it is completely transient.
 And so you guys picked up on that.
 You're obviously both got a hugely creative
 musical background.
 So you instantly gel.
 So come over, what nights did you do it at?
  </li><li>So that was a Tuesday night.
 And we started in November 2012,
 is when we did the first night.
 And throughout that whole thing, you know,
 we were living in this tiny house
 when we first got here.
 And we prayed and said,
 God, if we meant to do this thing,
 then you'll open up a place for us.
 He puts us in a house with this ginormous basement
 that the owners had built this whole area
 for their kids to practice hockey,
 'cause they're Canadian.
 And-- - Yeah, come on.
  </li><li>Yeah. (laughs)
  </li><li>And also, it was just kind of eventually
 gonna be a great space for us to meet on a Tuesday night,
 which was a total bonus.
 So we moved in and started meeting Tuesday nights
 every other week.
 And it was just a word of mouth thing.
 I mean, Alex and I, I think the only people we invited
 were the people that came the first night.
  </li><li>The same after that.
  </li><li>Yeah, the five really,
 'cause seven's including us.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 (both laughing)
 And God really moved quite profoundly that first night.
 And there was a couple of different scenarios
 of people just having such radical encounters with God
 that just changed, there was a marriage
 that was completely restored
 and some other things that happened
 It was really a profound night.
 And so we, you know, we didn't push it.
 We didn't, we actually didn't think a whole lot of it aside from us, just, you
 know, having a space for people to come and worship.
 And over the next probably eight or nine months, just word got out.
 And, you know, every other week we'd open up our home and I choose their night and
 people would knock at the door and people we'd never seen or met before.
 Just knocking at the door.
 Our kids were out there in the pyjamas welcoming people in.
 They were our welcome team.
 And it was the end of that next year that, you know,
 we had a hundred something people in our basement
 and we were really-- - Think hockey or--
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Almost.
 It was kind of like Tetris trying to get everyone in there,
 you know, but we were just worshiping
 by that point we were meeting weekly.
 And we still, Alex and I were still denying
 that it was a church at that point.
 You know, I think there was part of us that was,
 we understood the responsibility of being church leaders,
 having been part of pioneering churches in the past.
 And so we kind of went through this whole wrestle,
 but after a few prophetic things
 and some really strategic things from the law,
 we launched church in February 2014
 with about a hundred something people.
 And you know, now we're getting close to a thousand
 on a Tuesday night and another six or seven hundred
 on a Sunday afternoon.
  </li><li>Which is just so amazing.
 And what I love about that is,
 I think there's an epidemic in the circles
 that we move in in the church,
 where people see God breathe on something
 that is entirely his doing,
 because your marketing plan was to five people,
 hey guys, why don't you just come over and hang out?
 And we'd just love to connect with you.
 That was your sole effort, and the Lord goes,
 breathe is on it.
  </li><li>Exactly.
  </li><li>Before you know, 110 people are there, no strategy,
 but then people will look at that and go,
 we need to change church, we need to be more organic.
 And they work backwards and say,
 if we copy what you're doing, we'll get the results
 you're having, forgetting.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Forgetting that, no, everybody's built to look the same.
 That's A, not how God works.
 B, that is man's efforts to build God.
 It's just, it's so backwards.
 And yeah, and now you've got, you know,
 16, 1700 people in your church, I love it.
  </li><li>And it's, I mean, that whole thing was hilarious to us
 because we, you know, when we started meeting, you know,
 in a public sense, we didn't have a budget.
 We didn't, you know, we weren't,
 Alex and I obviously weren't taking a wage at that point.
 You know, we weren't even really--
 no money to start a chair.
  </li><li>Yeah, we hadn't done the whole,
 it's been two years trying to raise funds
 and all that sort of stuff.
 We just were responding to what God was doing.
 And so we literally had no money.
 And so we were like,
 "Well, how are we gonna let people know about this?"
 So we just start posting about our Instagram.
  </li><li>'Cause you would change locations
 depending on where you manage to find space.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And sometimes it was literally 12 hours before
 or 24 hours before.
 So we just sat over and just follow us on Instagram
 and then that way,
 We don't have to tax everybody.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And so, you know, then there was this whole thing about us,
 you know, conspiring to use Instagram
 to build the church and infiltrate and all this sort of stuff.
 And people labeling us the Instagram church.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm like, this is crazy.
 I mean, two years before that Instagram didn't even exist.
 You know, so there was no,
 we didn't start out with this plan of one point,
 we're gonna get to this thing where we're, you know,
 Instagram's gonna be the tool for us.
 It was just, we literally were using
 whatever resource that we had available
 to just let people know.
  </li><li>And you have no staff.
 It's not like you can be sending out.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>We had no database.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We had no database.
 We had no one's details.
 I mean, we just knew first name basis,
 people coming into our home.
 I mean, anyone could have walked into our home going,
 "Oh, this is free for all.
 I can rob everything."
 But I mean, we just didn't know.
 And I think that was even another thing.
 I remember getting, there was another room,
 had come out that we, our whole strategy was to tell people that we never intended on starting a church.
 With like, and obviously, yeah, I think people trying to quantify something that God, like you
 said before, just breathes on. And yet we preach about this stuff, we read about this stuff,
 when God actually does it, we don't, we don't, we don't understand it. So we have to, we have to
 work it out. But the other thing is if people would even just meet you, you know, I love
 what Bill Johnson says. We're our dumbest when we think we know the motives of another
 person's heart. And it's so true. But just I remember the first night we came to the
 belonging was actually I had a dream we were away on vacation. And you guys meet on a Tuesday
 night or we meet Emily on a Monday night. So Tuesday is our what your Wednesday. So you're
 just zoned out, especially teaching at the school. And so, you know, a lot of our people
 started going which we love by the way. We want everybody in a local church. We don't
 care where it is, we just want believers committed to a local church. So a bunch of people had
 been going and a lot of people, when anything new starts, they want to go check out rightly.
 So we'd heard great things in Asia. It was like, "Do you want to go? Do you want to go?
 Do you want to go?" And of course, we'd finish a Tuesday and we'd be exhausted. So it wasn't
 high on my priority list to do. Then I have a dream and in the dream I go to the belonging
 and meet you guys and just fall in love with you. I remember in the dream you had two kids,
 you had a boy and a girl and this, that, the next thing. And I got your personalities in the dream
 about what you were like on stage, what you were like on stage, what you were like,
 "Ah, stage." So I was like, babe, I think we should go meet them. And you didn't know us from Adam.
 There's no way you would know who we are. But as soon as we walked in, we were greeted,
 which is shocking. First of all, we can maybe unpack that later.
 But it was shocking.
 And then we were just, obviously we knew a bunch of people
 'cause it's Nashville that Christian community's fairly small
 and so we would connect with a bunch of people.
 But I remember you and we were the first people
 to come over and out.
 We knew a lot of people who could have connected,
 "Oh, these are our pastors at an age, you come and say hello?"
 No, you just walked up and you were like,
 "Hey, how are you?"
 And then I was like, "Man."
 And then when we had dinner
 and just connecting with you guys going,
 "Oh, this is nothing more than humble, authentic people
 at the Holy Spirit."
 Oh, I'll put my line to go and you guys.
 The trouble is people hear that story and again, I'm appreciating you're telling it
 quickly.
 But the story sounds like we left this incredibly successful mega church, which was one of the
 fastest growing churches in Australia.
 Is that right?
 Yeah.
 Right.
 And then you moved here and it all blew up.
 Of course.
 That's what you've been trained to do.
 But they forget that for two years, from the time you got here to having people in your
 house, you didn't know what you were doing.
 Yeah.
 I'll probably talk about those two years, what it was like.
 Well, I might talk about it from my perspective because with Henry, he produces, does mix
 engineering and is a worship leader and was itinerant all over the world.
 So technically, Henry could have worked anywhere.
 We could have literally landed in any country.
 He can work from online.
 It doesn't matter specifically.
 For me, it was a big deal.
 So I am local church girl, 100%.
 Same, I was part of the same church
 since I was 11 years of age.
 And we move here when I'm 39.
 So that's a huge chunk of my life
 in under one leadership covering.
 So coming here, we of course started to visit church
 every week to try and plant,
 'cause we were like, we need to serve.
  </li><li>You don't mean plant as in plant a church,
 you mean plant yourself in a local church.
  </li><li>Yes, absolutely, because we just believed,
 don't neglect meeting together.
 We just, and for our children,
 we just never wanna be that person that is a rogue
 doing our own thing.
 So we would go to church after church,
 but just couldn't find that spirit-leaping moment
 of this is where it was meant to be.
 And it wasn't because we didn't like it,
 I just couldn't settle.
  </li><li>Total little stone.
  </li><li>So I think it got to about three months in.
 I didn't know a human being.
 My kids were not at school yet,
 'cause it was from April to August
 that we had to wait for that gap.
  </li><li>Right, right, right.
  </li><li>And I was home, and Henry was working and traveling,
 and I think I actually became a little bit depressed.
 And I would just lay in bed every day
 just wondering what God had done.
 So here we are, go with nothing, too nothing,
 but with the power and presence of God.
 And then it's like, I don't know anyone.
 I can't even connect into a local church.
 In fact, every local church I've gone to,
 people don't even wanna say hi.
 They don't even wanna talk.
 and I'm going high and putting the accent up,
 like I'm Australian, I'm a foreigner,
 still nice to meet you.
 And then that was it.
 And so I'm like, how am I gonna build any sense of community?
 I don't have a job.
 All I know how to do is pastor.
 I've been doing it for the last 20 years.
 I got rejected from two retail positions that I applied for.
  </li><li>No, no.
  </li><li>And the job was like,
 I don't know how to do anything but pastor.
  </li><li>And so I was in a bit of a limbo
 And I remember getting really depressed.
 I had a friend of mine write in and said,
 Alex, don't fall under this.
 This is just the climate of the city
 and you need to begin to pray into it.
 And as I did that, I remember I was reading the Bible
 as it happens in history.
 And this one particular day I was done.
 I think it was around July.
 And I was like, I want to go home.
 I said to Henry, we are not living here.
 I don't like it here.
 It is dried as barren.
 It's dead.
 And I just need to go home.
 And he was just praying and interceding for me
 'cause he'd heard God's voice say,
 "No, we need to stay here."
 And I just began to pray.
 And I remember opening my word that morning
 and it was in two Kings 2.19.
 And it was when Elisha's prophets come to him
 and they say Elisha Elisha, the location here is good.
 But the water's a second, the land is unfruitful.
 And he said, "Well, get me a new bowl of salt."
 And as he put the salt in the water,
 the waters were healed and the land became fruitful
 and has been fruitful to this day.
 And I literally felt the hand of the Lord on my heart
 and He said, "The location is exactly where I've put you,
 "but the waters are sick."
 And they need new salt.
 And you and Henry are gonna be part of that story,
 of bringing salt to bring healing to the waters.
 And I just knew that was the mandate.
 And I knew from that moment on,
 let me ask you about that because I love that story.
 You can't see it 'cause we're in a studio
 you're listening to this through headphones, but I'm tearing up, hearing that story. So God
 gives you that word, which is again, two years in, so blindly obvious. Is there any point where
 when you hear from the Lord or when you get prophetic words about big things that you feel
 unqualified, you challenge your Lord on, you just think, oh, that's me, that's just my ego,
 is that being a struggle for you historically?
 Well, I think this was the first time that the Lord had spoken to me and Henry to do something.
 I think the past had always been the Lord speaking to my leadership, commissioning us to do something,
 and we followed that lead. So this was, I felt like I had my big girl pants on.
 This is the, I'm an adult now, and God has spoken to me and given me a mandate, and it scared the
 the bajib is out of me. I'll be honest because this is what I said to the Lord. Well, that's
 really great. But how am I going to do that? I don't even have a church I'm about of.
 No one knows who we are. I'm a woman in Nashville. They're not going to even let me preach on
 a helper. I mean, what have you done? You've actually brought me to the wrong place. This
 may sound arrogant, but I remember the Lord saying, do you remember when you're a little
 go and you watch Joan of Arc and I said yes I love her. He goes I've called you to be her.
 You're going to change the course of history and I said well that's a bit arrogant, what do you mean?
 But you know in hindsight I'm looking just two years in. I feel like I'm part of not the answer
 but part of even opening the door for the female voice to be heard in the local church in the south.
 And because that's been such a crazy thing,
 because I always, I thought God had chosen the wrong place.
 It's like, hold on a minute, but I remember Henry saying to me,
 it's no coincidence that you won the lottery.
 I'm not Henry.
 And not Henry. He goes, and you got to understand,
 I've never won anything in my life.
 I don't even win any competition that I ever applied for.
 And so to win the lottery, like Henry goes, God chose you to be here.
 He goes, because I can work anyway, but he chose you to be here.
 And so from there, it was like, okay, well then what now?
 You know, you get this prophetic word.
  </li><li>So you were just matter of fact.
 Okay, God, if you said it, I'll believe it.
  </li><li>Yep, absolutely.
  </li><li>So that's amazing 'cause that's what you preach.
 And it's what I like to preach,
 but my internal struggle has been historically like,
 oh no, God, well, they're bigger than I'm small.
 But that wasn't an issue for you.
 We're just like, okay, I'm done.
 I've been in barrenness for two years about time.
 Let's do something.
  </li><li>And it was like, okay, well, how do I do this?
 And he goes, I gave you a commission the week before
 you left Australia.
 I told you to love people like I love people.
 And I'm like, okay, he goes to start doing that.
 Person in the store, person in the school,
 whoever you meet, he goes,
 who are you without the church backing,
 without the paycheck, without the title,
 and without you being Henry Cili's wife, who are you?
 I said, I'm your daughter,
 and I carry the presence of God.
 And he goes, so go do that.
 And that's actually the five people,
 two of those or, yeah, just two of those I invited.
 The others were your friends.
 I think one girl I'd had a prophetic word for
 in the middle of the night, woke up,
 directly spoken with her life, her and her husband came.
 And the other one was Holly's vocal teacher
 that after her vocal lesson,
 I would minister and again speak into her life.
 Those people came and got their lives radically changed.
 But then I would just begin to just talk to people.
 and then it was like, well, then what?
 And we actually had a dinner
 and we had three couples at our dinner
 and at the end of the dinner, this lady came to me.
 She said, why is it that tonight felt like I'd been to church?
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>And I went, that's all we need to do is love people.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You won't know this 'cause you're not inside my head,
 but one of the most profound things--
  </li><li>You probably don't wanna be inside.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>One of the most profound things I'd heard from you to
 was the first time we had lunch together. We were at Wild Ginger.
 [laughter]
 Jesus.
 We were just in chat and we were just getting to hear one another's stories. It was either
 one of you or both of you who said this. You said, "I'm angry at people who dishonor
 the pastoral office." I said, "What do you mean?" You said, "Well, we just see people
 who are titled pastors but don't pastor." I said, "Well, what does that mean to you?"
 He said, "Well, being a pastor, you've got to be with people through all phases of their
 life.
 He's got to love well."
 I'm fed up with people calling themselves pastor and not pastoring.
 It wasn't that they weren't pastoring that bothered you.
 Of course, that would be part of it, but it was the dishonor that was brought to that
 title.
 When I heard you guys talk about your love for people, and obviously I've seen it in
 evidence, I was like, "That is amazing.
 You guys are pastors of pastors.
 You just love so well and the number one goal to your inconvenience is other people.
 So I feel chagrin when I'm around you.
 I'm terrible.
 But you've talked about that.
 When you were at the school, you talked about the, I mean, there's such excellence on everything
 you do.
 If you go to the belonging, there's just, you know, excellence everywhere, which is amazing.
 And it's not even your building to put in place systems that would make that easy.
 huge costs. I saw on Instagram the other day at like 4 p.m. all your car park people and they're
 all in their branded vest and this there's so many little bits of attention to detail and you
 know you're a huge technical person Henry. And so you know we bond over our love of
 nerdery and it takes a lot to take all the tech stuff working but I remember you sharing at the
 school that actually it's more important that the person running that feels loved and they get
 get the stuff right.
 How did you learn that?
 Talk about that.
  </li><li>Yeah, like I said before,
 we've been in ministry, I guess, if you wanna call it that.
 We've been on stuff, both of us,
 in a church context for 20 years,
 and honestly, learnt so, so much amazing stuff from that,
 and God has really grown us.
 And I think it was awesome to come into this season
 where we got to kinda take it back to zero
 in the sense that we were, you know, when we left Australia, we'd been part of that
 church for almost 10 years since we'd planted it. It was almost 10,000 people. And so it
 was very established in the way things were happening. And so I think to step into this
 environment and be able to start from scratch and be able to stop and just say, "Okay, God,
 what was fundamental and foundational to this season that we bring from the past?"
 And then what was contextual for the past and what needs to shift for this season?
 What was contextual for Melbourne that's not going to work here in Nashville?
 What was the blueprint for Melbourne that's, how's the blueprint for Nashville different
 to the blueprint for Melbourne?
 And so that was, there were questions that we were pretty intentional about.
 And I think we really got a revelation about this whole thing of not building a ministry
 but building people.
 We're not about building a brand.
 We're not about trying to build a church.
 We're about building people.
 And so we've really tried to keep that at the forefront of what we do and who we are
 as people.
 And even, you know, I'm lying in bed last night and I just, I said to Alex, I said,
 I feel like there's too many people building towers instead of digging wells.
 There's too many people trying to, you know, build platforms for ministry rather than digging
 wells for people to have encounters.
 And I think that's the irony that, you know, that anyone would even know about the belonging
 because really we've been so understated as far as any sort of promotional or anything
 like that, brand building.
 I mean, I love creatively, I love building brands and I love imagery and look and all
 that sort of stuff.
 But even with that, we've been pretty minimalistic in stuff that we've done.
 Even stage wise at church, we don't have any moving lights.
 It's cool that it's very stripped back because we've really wanted to make this season about
 No other distraction, but just people having an encounter with God.
 And so I think that's kind of the place that we lead from.
 Like we're not, there is no end goal of building a ministry.
 The end goal is building people.
 And so even when we're dealing with our team, with our volunteers, they are the end goal.
 The journey with them is the end goal.
 Not of, hey, we're going to buy this year going to have a church of X amount.
 Are we going to be in this many blah, blah, blah.
 It's not that at all.
 God's already got that stuff.
 We're just being faithful with the people that he's put around us and doing it.
 We're not perfect leaders by any stretch of the imagination, but we are doing our best
 to walk this journey.
 It's been a shift for me, to be honest, Alex has been in a pastoral role for 20 plus years.
 For me, my safe place is the studio.
 My safe place is not really anyone else around.
 There's me in the console and Pro Tools, and that's my world.
 That's my safe space.
 to be in this place where I'm around people, not just around people, but leading people
 and having to speak a lot more than necessarily comfortable for me. But it's been an amazing
 stretch to see what God will do when you just trust Him and step out in His call.
 Where did the actual name come from? Because I love that the name is the vision.
 What had happened in that season, the year that I was just kind of sitting with the Lord,
 I was really unpacking. What did you have in mind, Lord, when you wanted the church built?
 Because I got a little bit, what's the word I suppose disoriented with church as a empire,
 if you like it, as a tower. I'd got to this place where I almost forgot to love the people
 while I was building the ministry.
 So I felt a little bit disconnected.
 And I remember asking the Lord God,
 you need to speak to me because I just feel,
 I've got a lot of questions.
 I've been doing this for a long time,
 but I have questions and I need them answered.
 And I started to look at the way people would be treated
 or the collateral damage of how people were mistreated.
 And I needed to ask those questions.
 And I remember reading through the word
 I was going, well, you're the ultimate leader.
 I want to lead like you.
 Follow me as I follow Christ.
 So you're the ultimate.
 How did you choose leaders?
 And I began to look at how he chooses disciples and began to look at all the characteristics
 and personalities of these men that he's chosen.
 And I start to have this, you know, epiphany like, I'm like, Oh my goodness, you gathered
 your inner circle.
 men that some were misfits, some were just rebellious, none of them really knew who you were. They
 all had a crisis in some area, yet you didn't make them go through the eight steps and make
 them go through seminary and choose the wisest or the most learned. You just chose these 12
 men and you allowed them to belong before they even believed. And something just hit me. And I went,
 And I remember saying to Henry, "Get this."
 He allowed them to belong before they even believed
 and their behavior changed while being close to him.
 And then it says, when he rises again
 and he goes to the mountain of transfiguration,
 he says, "Tell them to meet me there on that mountain."
 And he said, "Some of his disciples worshiped
 "and some still doubted."
 And I'm like, "Oh my goodness, this is Jesus Christ,
 son of God. And yet he thought it was okay to put Judas in charge of the treasury when he was a
 thief and he knew he had a temptation to steal. Yet we wouldn't ever do that in our leadership ranks.
 And it just broke me. Now during the time I was actually discipling a lady who travels around
 because her husband is a defense coach for NFL football. And she had moved to St. Louis. And so
 So she would call me and just say, "Alex, what have you got for me today?
 What revelation have you got for me?"
 And I was almost discipling her on the phone.
 And she used to be a Hollywood scriptwriter and a very, very smart, successful woman.
 And she's an author and she's just an incredible lady.
 We love to exchange stories.
 And I told her about that, what I just shared with you.
 And she goes, "Oh my gosh, Alex, that's it.
 That's the name of your basement thing.
 It's the belonging.
 That's who you guys are.
 you allow people to belong before they believe?" And I just went, "Yes." And now Henry being
 the brand guy, the imagery guy, I thought, "If he, if he, okay, is this, you know, this
 is God." And I say to him, I said, "Babe, I think I know what we're going to call the
 thing because it still wasn't a church." The thing, I said, "It's the belonging." And
 he goes, "Yeah." And then our friend Mia was over and I said, "Mia, the belonging." She
 Because I love it.
 Yes.
 And then we added the belonging company.
 And maybe you can shed light on what the company represents.
 But that's kind of how we got the belonging.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 The whole deal with the company thing.
 You know, we think of company as being like a business.
 But as I started to delve into it a little more
 and kind of research that whole word,
 that the whole idea of company was from a French word
 from the 1500s.
 And it was this word that was kind of had a military context,
 but it was this reference of this group of people
 who would fight together in a military context,
 but also know how to break bread together,
 like how to eat together.
 And that to me was such a representation
 of what I believe the church really is.
 It's we are comrades and we're saints.
 we're in the army of the Lord, fighting together, and we're also breaking bread like we're doing
 life together. And that was such a big deal to me because I feel like that they're the things
 that are kind of missing in some regards in the church is we slip into this thing of the church
 just being an event that we go to or, you know, it's meeting. Yeah, it's a meeting or it's an event
 or whatever, rather than this real sense of, you know, you hear about people trying to be more
 authentic or trying to be more organic. And like right there, you've already missed the fact that
 clearly demonstrating that you're not being authentic. You know, trying to be friendly.
 Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Those things, you don't try. You just, they come out of who you are.
 Right. And they come out of the relationships that you build. And so I think, you know, one of the
 beautiful things that I think one of the greatest testimonies that we hear about our church is how
 overwhelmed people feel when they walk in the door, how loved they feel. Yeah, you guys do a beautiful
 job. Well, it is intentional. And we're again, we're not perfect at that, but our team are
 so amazing. And they do genuinely love people. And so much of that came because so many of them
 walked into our basement or into our house, into our kitchen. And that's what they experienced.
 And so when we, you know, when we outgrow our house, and we started meeting, you know, in a
 public sense, that was the one thing that we said to all of our crew, we were like, hey,
 there's no rules on this stuff. But here's the one thing that we're going to be intentional
 about the same thing that you experienced, that same sense of home and being loved.
 Let's carry that because we can.
 And that is one of the things that's missing in a lot, not every church, but a lot of
 churches, that sense of, as a person, as a visitor, as part of this church, you're more
 important than the event that we're doing right now.
 And a lot of people will say that, but you can totally feel that at your church.
 Yeah, you can.
 Good.
 Well, we're really glad about that.
 But the one thing that, one pet peeve, if I was allowed to have one, was when we visited
 those 20 or so churches, that everybody just walks into a building, they just get greeted
 at a door to be given a bulletin, but it's kind of token.
 And then you go to your seat and then everybody just sits and waits for church to start.
 It's like the movie theatre.
 Yeah.
 And I would be like, "Oh, this just feels awkward.
 What about if you're there 20 minutes early and you're just sitting and no one is engaging?"
 And I remember feeling very lonely every week and just wanting somebody to come and encourage
 or just say hi.
 And so we made sure, I felt like God sent us on a reconnaissance trip for those 20 churches
 to see the need.
 And I think when you've been in ministry for so long, you don't look with those eyes because
 you're the one doing.
 And everyone's Canadian to you.
 Yeah, everyone's could ever wants to know us.
 But now I'm the new person.
 Right.
 and with fresh eyes and now I'm the newcomer
 and no one knows who we are.
 And so now I'm on the receiving end
 and I was like, oh, if I ever had a church,
 I would never want this to feel like this.
 So that's why we would have a black curtain
 when we went to-- - I remember that.
  </li><li>You know, because we wanted people talking to one another,
 not just coming and sitting
 and people actually would get angry and go,
 your website says that church starts at 7.30
 and Henry would go, yeah, it did.
 because you're here.
 There you go.
 So be the church.
 You're having church.
  </li><li>I would be one of those people.
  </li><li>He was just a worship band, hasn't said it.
  </li><li>I walked in and I was like, wait, I have to,
 yeah, why are they late?
 I have to stand here with people I don't know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I've got no choice but to talk to them.
  </li><li>And it pushes you out of that zone.
 And 'cause the thing that I could never get is that
 if we filled with the same spirit that raised Christ
 from the dead and we have the love of Jesus,
 It's very easy to be kind to Christians.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>What someone gonna do if I came up to you, AJ,
 and went, "Hi, how are you?
 "You're not gonna go, please don't talk to me.
 "Get away."
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>You know, I hope we--
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't know.
 But I think we fear rejection.
 And so we stay, it's not that people are being mean
 intentionally, is that we fear just coming up.
 And, but that's actually what's gonna change
 this generation 'cause we don't live in a kind world anymore.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And we need to be intentional.
 And so, and we did it from the base.
 We said, well, you freely receive that.
 Now go freely give it.
  </li><li>Yeah, so good.
  </li><li>If God actually spoke to us next year and said,
 okay, you guys are done now, hand this over.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We would need to be obedient to that.
 Because it's not about us anymore.
 We are not gonna build our identity on the belonging.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's loosely held.
  </li><li>I love you guys.
 I love that you're in our city
 and I love that these are your values.
  </li><li>Seriously.
  </li><li>And I love everything that's happened.
 I could not be proud of you guys.
 Now that's my place to be proud of you guys.
 But when we connect with you, we're just like,
 oh, I just love your hearts.
 I love that you chose meekness over ministry
 and that you chose humility over the spotlight
 and any of those things that you,
 really is true that no,
 I mean, here's a strategy that nobody wants to follow,
 but it's the answer for every successful person.
 Humble yourself before the Lord
 and then do time we will lift you up.
  </li><li>So you spent two years just going,
 what have we done?
 you were obedient, but it doesn't look like anything.
 And no doubt you've got concerned friends and family who are like,
 "Oh, guys, seriously."
  </li><li>Oh, yeah.
  </li><li>You went from a 10,000 person church to--
  </li><li>It's tough.
  </li><li>You have like seven people in your basement
 and long-blasted ones.
  </li><li>We were getting texts about that.
  </li><li>We were, and I had a person who I used to, you know,
 really look up to, still do, literally didn't know what
 we were doing and patted me on the back and just said,
 "Well, good luck with whatever it is you're doing."
 And I remember going home and weeping before the Lord.
 And I said, God, you've made me look foolish.
 And he said, yup, he goes,
 because if you can look foolish before man,
 I can trust you with my presence.
 And I went, all right then.
  </li><li>Beautiful.
  </li><li>I choose to look foolish, I don't care.
 And I threw it off and I went and I'm keeping course.
  </li><li>Love it.
  </li><li>If you haven't checked out the belonging,
 I'd highly recommend going.
 You guys meet on Tuesday nights and on Sunday nights.
  </li><li>Sunday afternoon.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Where can we find you on the internet?
 We're at thebelonging.co.
  </li><li>If you guys are, listen to this in your own,
 but we don't live in Nashville, we can't go.
 You don't need to worry about that.
 If you go to thebelonging.co/live,
 you can watch live and you can watch archived messages.
  </li><li>Yeah, that's correct.
