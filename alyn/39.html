<p> Alright, laughs<br/>
 Hello<br/>
 Not by God<br/>
 Are you on drugs?<br/>
 Well, that's something in Scottish. It's nothing in Scottish. I
 Okay, stop offending the land of my<br/>
 Birth. What am I trying to say?<br/>
 You're trying to say good evening everybody
 I bet you're part of my wife is having a stroke
 Mrs Jones, how are you? Are you slightly jetlagged?
</p><ul>
  <li>I'm underprivileged in the sleep department.
  </li><li>You are below the poverty line.
  </li><li>I'm below the poverty line.
  </li><li>We are recording this from a quaint little cottage
 just outside of Dundee in Scotland.
 And if it sounds different from our normal podcasts,
 that's simply because we're using our mobile podcast studio,
 which consists of the sketchiest setup you have ever seen in your life. You don't even want to know.
 AJ Jones, tell everybody how we ended up in Scotland. Start with last Wednesday when everything
 was normal. Last Wednesday we had a wonderful breakfast with Krista and Luke and as we were
 we were leaving there, we received a phone call about Alan's mom.
 And so basically it by an hour or so later, we had the information that his mom really only had two to three weeks to live at the very most.
 And we needed to be headed towards Scotland.
 And what was weird about that is you say that like that all came out in a linear fashion, but it really didn't.
 And from speaking to lots of our medical friends,
 they were like, yeah, you probably need to get over there
 sooner rather than later.
 So not knowing what we're facing,
 we try to book flights to get over here,
 but there was two tiny little problems, Ajay, what were those?
  </li><li>Expired passports, both mine and Tia's.
  </li><li>And apparently you need a passport
 when traveling from one country to another.
  </li><li>That's what they say, yes.
  </li><li>So again, this is all linear,
 but it wasn't linear at the time.
 We just thought, no problem.
 And so Tia's got an American passport.
 You have a Canadian passport.
 But we thought we could kill two birds with one stone.
 We'll look up the consulate in Atlanta.
 All that there's a US passport office in Atlanta.
 This should be great.
 But then when we read the small print,
 the time for both of them for an expedited passport
 was eight days, eight business days.
  </li><li>That was for Tia's.
  </li><li>And for Canada?
  </li><li>Well, they were saying 21 days, but...
 But what was expedited?
 21 days.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 So our first problem was--
 We didn't have 21 days.
 The second problem is you can't even make an appointment
 at either of those places without having booked travel.
 So it's a bit of a chicken and egg situation.
 You need a passport in order to travel,
 but they expect you to have your travel booked
 to confirm that you actually need the passport.
 So on the advice of a very smart friend,
 we booked 100% fully refundable tickets
 and then canceled them the day later.
 So we get into the consulate
 and you saw Canada and what did they say to you?
  </li><li>Well, when I talked to the lady at the Canadian consulate,
 like I called Thursday morning as soon as they opened
 and she said, "If you could get here today,
 "you'd need to get here by 230,"
 which meant I had an hour to go from,
 oh, I had no idea I had to get everything ready
 to getting the forms, getting passport photos, and getting on the road, and also getting
 TIA and getting packed.
 And what we thought was, well, we'll make appointment at the US consulate the following
 day on Friday, or maybe the same day, on Thursday, to try and get TIA passport.
 So we thought, we'll just get TIA some passport photos.
 But upon reading the website closely, they said, "No, no, the child needs to be present."
 So that added a complication.
 And they said, "Both parents have to be present."
 And I was like, "How's that going to work?"
 If both parents can't be there, you need to sign Daffodave and buy a...
  </li><li>Notary Republic. - Notary Republic.
  </li><li>Oh, I don't know. Notary?
  </li><li>So absurd. - I think Notary Republic is that
 Hippindi van from Atlanta.
 [laughter]
 For a signed Notary Republic.
 So amazingly enough, within an hour, we had all that taken care of.
 And you drove through to Atlanta.
  </li><li>Well, I spoke... - And locked speeds.
 Well, I spoke to our friends who were helping us book tickets and travel agents and trying
 to store out tickets.
 Yeah.
 But the short version of a very long and stressful couple of days was.
 Well, we went and had our passport appointment for T8, and then we had six hours to kill
 before we could go back and pick it up.
 And so we went to the aquarium in rural Wirghi, Atlanta.
 And so the Dolphin Show is literally just about to start and a weird number comes through
 on my phone, which I decided to pick up, of course, because I'm waiting for calls.
 And it's this lady, it's a different lady from the Canadian Consulate saying, "Well,
 you know, I can't believe this, but I think, you know, this is your passport, it's here,
 you know."
 So I started bawling at the beginning of the Dolphin Show.
 I moved by the Dolphins, too.
 Yes, they were very moving.
 So even when I picked up my passport at the consulate, the ladies there, all of them,
 especially the reception lady was like, weren't you just here yesterday?
 And I said, yeah, and it's ready already.
 I've never seen that happen.
 I was like, I'm so thankful.
 So lots of little miracles along the way.
 You drove home Friday.
 We packed Friday night.
 We got in a plane Saturday morning at 8 and spent all day flying, got here Sunday.
 And the fun thing about that was, without us planning it, we were on the same flight as
 my sister with their kids, our kids as cousins. And they were in the same, well, they were
 row behind us. So that was a nice touch from God. We got to Scotland and Jill on Twitter
 had texted me or tweeted me and said, "What do you know is different about Scotland?"
 So what are the things you notice about Scotland that's different from, well, we shouldn't
 say Scotland and America. We should say, "What do you know is different about Dundee
 and Franklin. That's much better with Boone.
 I'm not sure it's going to make any difference.
 Well, I don't want to suddenly say all the right.
 So, for example, my first point is the drivers here are much nicer,
 but I don't want to say drivers universally in Scotland are better or nicer
 than drivers universally in America.
 The Dundonian drivers certainly seem more very friendly, very friendly, always
 letting you merge, always being very courteous.
 You should see what I did on the roundabout today, Darnley.
 I'm terrified what we did around the road.
 You should be both of you sister screamed,
 but we're fine and nobody hit me.
 Anyway, yes, they're much nicer.
 They are much nicer.
 The roads are so skinny.
 We've actually, we've filmed a hyperlapse of our drive
 from the cottage to the main road
 and literally the road is wide enough for my car.
 And so we just pray we don't meet anybody else,
 but we have, we've met tour buses,
 we've met FedEx pickup.
 tractor trailer units. It's just terrifying. People like just pull off on the side, practically
 up the side of the wall to get out of the way and then you slowly move by each other
 with a hair's breath between you and then they just keep going at 50 miles. I didn't
 know your hair is breathed. Yes, I do. That's the noise at night when I'm trying to sleep.
 Yes, that just small little voice is great. Parking spots are terrifying. Oh, I parked
 so far away from the building today, just because I wanted a spot that I could turn into without
 having to pray. Here's a big thing that's different. Is you now have to pay for your own
 plastic bags at any store? So you go grocery shopping and they charge you per bag. And I thought
 maybe it was just that chain, but then we went to a closed store and you're buying, I don't know,
 fifty pounds worth of stuff and they're like, would you like a bag with that? And I'm like, yes,
 well, they charge you five pence more. So. Can I just tell you today? Yeah. I bought clothes for
 the kids today and they made me break a 20 pound note for 5B. So I don't know, maybe we're missing
 the point. Maybe it's like some sort of green thing. Maybe it's some rule that they have to,
 But it sure as heck feels like nickel and diming.
 Well, what's nickel and diming in pounds and pants?
 It sure is like penny pinching, is what it feels like.
 Tylot seats are way more fragile over here.
 Really?
 Do you explain that?
 Well, I've managed to crack two of them.
 No, just one.
 You just cracked it on both sides.
 Well, I like to do things decently in an order.
 Yeah, well done, darling.
 It's been great to revisit all the food I forgot that I love.
 I had sweet chili chips with hummus last night.
 I've just been consuming chocolate like so about I'm going to pay.
 I'm going to go home and be like, Oh, look at that.
 I'm up 10 pounds.
 How'd that happen?
 Chocolate.
 All right.
 Well, oh, you know what the other thing is?
 You know that thing about where two countries divided by a common language.
 Yes.
 I'm thrown because all this has born and done the it's been.
 But then nobody here would know that.
 Well, I don't know.
 I think they don't know it because of my vocabulary rather than because of my accent.
 No, I'm sorry.
 You have no accent left.
 Really?
 Yes.
 Compared to people here, are you kidding me?
 I don't know how many people I just looked at today smiled a nod and then sort of guessed at what they could have been saying possibly.
 My strangest punk was I was in Morrison Spencer's in the cafe ordering.
 I was about to order tomato basil soup and then realized they wouldn't know what I was talking
 about, what they would, but I'd sound like a complete moron. But I wasn't tomato basil
 sounded so strange. So I was like, "Could I order a tomato and basil soup, please?"
 And I think she looked at me like I had learning difficulties, so that was interesting.
 Mrs Jones, our main topic is we're here because we're effectively saying goodbye to my mum.
 Yes.
 Doctors have given her a few weeks to live.
 Medical people say that we know saying she should have been dead by now.
 But when you visit her, she seems completely fine and she asserts that she's fine.
 And in many ways, she's beaten all the odds because she's in no pain, has no infection,
 and she hasn't broken any of her bones.
 Yes, I think she's a confusion to the medical people who look at the facts.
 But nevertheless, she's dying, and I'm aware that when we go to see her tomorrow,
 and I say goodbye, that's the last time I'm going to see her.
 Yeah.
 That's pretty sobering.
 So, what's messed up is my whole family have gathered to say goodbye to my mum,
 and yet we all sit around like everything's normal.
 Right, but I'm not really sure.
 What else you would do she's telling stories and we're just listening and stuff.
 Yeah.
 But it is a bizarre situation.
 It really is bizarre.
 I don't know what to do with any of my feelings.
 Yeah.
 I we asked my mom if she wanted to be on the podcast this week because I thought my
 mom loves to talk and she's got a lot of interesting things to say, but she said she didn't want to be.
 But then in the next breath started talking about all the stuff I wanted to ask her about anyway.
 So I said, "Mom, how about I just record what you're saying?"
 And she's like, "Oh, well, that would be fine."
 So what you're going to hear next is,
 we'll set up a few clips here,
 but basically my mom started talking at lunch today.
 I just plunked a microphone down on the table.
 So you'll hear real life just being recorded.
 We're all having lunch together,
 me and my sisters and AJ and my mom.
 So you'll hear our kids coming in and out,
 and we're just throwing questions at my mom.
 And then, you know, we'll play you the answers that she gave us.
 And it's great because you get real sense for how amazing my mom is and her accent which you're all gonna fall in love with my mom remotely just simply because of her accent but it's a well shot sent by the way it's not a Scottish right.
 The first thing I think of when I think of my mom is being mother.
 What you could say well daw she's your mom but like my childhood especially my early childhood i i just remember my mother being this amazingly.
 Consistent source of love and affection and so i asked her like mom where did you get your approach to mothering.
 And this is what she said.
 My mother and father came from a long generation of Methodist 1834 in the valleys.
 And I think in the 50s there was a very strong moral, you know,
 children wouldn't, mmm, steal, and the neighbours would all pitch in if anybody was ugly.
 And when I went to university to study education and psychology,
 you have all these theories and I remember coming back and saying to my mother,
 "Oh, this is so confusing."
 You know, all these theories, I should have done these years.
 Just forget psychology, just love them.
 And she said, "Never notice if they are..."
 The carpet is threadbare.
 They'll notice if their map is not there.
 Because of course in those days it was a mother.
 The father might have to work.
 And it was a mother that's brilliant.
 So she had very strong views that you were there for a child,
 and I never remember a time when she wasn't.
 I did have a period when I thought I would do other degrees
 and I would have done the route of academia,
 which is quite clearly the Lord had known me to do that.
 And I thought, what is the point?
 I saw all these women, you know, got on top of their tree,
 but their kids are just a drift.
 When I was teaching feminism, you know, we did all this research on
 when we looked at like women at the top, had gone through the past ceiling.
 They were either unmarried, although married, but not children.
 Although married like Mrs. Thatcher with children.
 But a whole army of supporters, well, you can only do that, they're wealthy.
 And then when you look at all the research, all the research done in the years, it's always been the best outcome for children to have two stable parents, male and female, consistently that their lifestyle is your rules.
 Right.
 But lots of love.
 What you want, what you don't want is lots of rules and no love.
 That was what the research show went, I mean from my own experience, that's true, I've seen families are very cold and very hard.
 You know, I like to respond to that, you just gotta love them all the time.
 Most women, possibly men too.
 They liked children at a certain stage, like I had a friend and she said to me, "I can't
 stand children" and they were all full and they actually told you.
 And another one said, "I can't stand them when a baby's in a house, you're paying the
 neck."
 And another one said, "Yeah."
 And the teenagers, you know, just mark two and say, "It's better than the minibarol
 to bring them out with their sins."
 that my mother just loved children.
 And if you go to a train,
 she'd be surrounded by children.
 The same thing happens to me,
 but we're just waiting on a cruise ship to change dates.
 There's four different people come up,
 give me their life stories,
 that says, "What did you do?"
 I said, "I didn't do anything, I just sat and talk."
 So I think you being a people person,
 if you like people,
 I'm the same with children,
 I just love children of all ages.
 I think any other,
 you don't say, "I love that person because you love them
 because they're huge.
 And he's amazing.
 Oh, stories of these women, you know, have really disabled children and they just devote
 their life to them.
 Right.
 But with no possible outcome of them being any better than they are, you know what I mean?
 Yeah.
 I think it's just love.
 God is love and I think we're mating gods and nature, we just reflect that.
 So it's amazing that my mum got her revelation of mothering from her mum who I never knew,
 She died when I was at MJ's age, so I never really knew her.
 But my mum was just raised knowing that she was wonderful and she in turn raised us as
 kids knowing that we're wonderful.
 And I don't know if you'd agree with this, but my mum is one of the most secure people
 I know, to the point where she's so clueless, she's so unaware of how secure she is that
 she doesn't realize that other people can be intimidated by that despite the fact she's
 least intimidating person on the planet.
 Your mother is to mothering what Bill Gates is to Microsoft.
 Right.
 You know, and I've certainly witnessed that.
 She's just a remarkable mother, a remarkable grandmother.
 And all of her, all of her kids are have.
 Good looking.
 Oh, living real relationships with the Lord.
 So she's, I mean, there's obviously a lot your parents have done really, really well.
 You know, we talk a lot about story love, you know, love that's communicated through affectionate touch, loving to a voice and, you know, eye contact.
 And when I learn about story love, I realized, oh my gosh, that's all I was bathed in.
 Like from the moment I had awareness, you know, certainly for my mom, that's all I ever received was this story love.
 And I was talking to her about, you know, now being a parent and now having a home, like my experience growing up was our home was always open.
 like we had tons of people at our house all the time.
 Like my mom and dad were taking waste of strays and, you know,
 she would be feeding people and all my sisters and myself.
 We never had to ask if anybody could stay for dinner or stay overnight.
 That was always a possibility.
 And so I asked her about that.
 Like, how did you like, was that deliberate?
 Is that just the way you are?
 Like, how did you end up that way?
 And that's what she said.
 My mother, well, I think probably a little bit of agrifobia.
 If I wanted to bring friends on, she'd say, "Oh, now."
 And right, we're about two weeks' time.
 And she would make lemon meringue pie, little cakes.
 She'd do the whole British afternoon tea.
 So my attitude was, forget that.
 They can shake what they like.
 I remember 16 here, frequently on the Sunday lunch.
 And they just get what we had.
 We'd have pulled the soup and purple apple crumble.
 But when we were in New Zealand in the '70s,
 I read this Roman Catholic book and it said,
 it was a very wise book,
 and I stuck the pages on the fridge door for years
 and it said that you should,
 how should we always be open, you know,
 to bring people in?
 And, you know, the mothers are happy the wheel.
 And I think today, because women are desperate
 to be as good or better than men,
 and the pressures aren't to work all the time
 and to get bigger houses, bigger mortgage.
 So, babe, while you were out of the room,
 thank you for managing Mr. McGuggins.
 I asked your mom about family day
 because I was saying that you still don't really enjoy
 family days.
  </li><li>Yeah, but how did, 'cause you instituted family days
 for our family, is that because I told you about family days
 in our family, or where did you get the idea
 for having a family day?
 Like in our family.
  </li><li>I think that was because I saw like,
 And joining uncle Paul had one and Janna and Paul had a family day,
 like just a day that it was just their family and they did stuff together.
 And I remember thinking, you know, our family never had anything like that.
 And from the families that seem to have it all seem to have much
 healthier relationships.
 So I decided that that would be a good thing for us to have.
 But it was, you know, it's you, it's your family.
 It's some other families I saw that all had family day.
 sure it looked different for every single family but I'm not sure this clip is
 gonna support what you just said but we'll play it anyway yeah I mean like
 Alan you should hate we did liberalies to have this family day on a Saturday
 and I just because Ty used to work at Sock's office and I say look father is
 important a family we're gonna do something as a family day he still doesn't
 like them it is incidentally I know I can imagine so we go to our bros we go
 go to the beach, barbecues with birds and dandruffs.
 See I never remember having a family day ever.
 You don't? I don't.
 You don't remember making bows and arrows and temples and what you found showing them?
 No. No.
 No.
 You were like photographs of us all doing things together.
 I don't remember family days.
 Oh, you remember family days?
 I don't remember having family days.
 Oh, you came here with a bane of my life.
 I don't like I went on them.
 Go for a family walk.
 If all colors are trying to create memories
 that you've looked back on and enjoyed.
  </li><li>My first priority was your father
 because he would sit and study all day.
 And I used to have this thing that father's a reporter.
 You can't just tump it on the mother.
 So I said, right, we're gonna go,
 can you remember all the high-endage faults we climbed up?
 I got pictures of us all in the snow.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, no one.
  </li><li>I said, right, we're going at the--
  </li><li>He could tell you this, but it's a planned family unit,
 if it all.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I don't remember any of them.
 I got a practice of all these.
 I remember, I remember, was I there?
 You must have been for walks down in my county,
 in the Broady Ferry.
 I got a picture of you.
 There was these contrived times where we were forced to spend time together.
 And to have hey, because he'd rather be studying.
 But I'm trying to be jovial.
 None of us were interested in it, and none of us were at the age where we wanted to be together.
 You want to spend your Saturday with your friends?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, well sometimes I believe in doing what you don't want to do is good for you
 So at least I've been consistent for 40 years
 Hey the man what so I hate them now I
 Think I think I've probably just been programmed not to like them. I do enjoy spending time with our family
 You like them much better than Valium
 Like a lot of things more on Valium wait. We did explain why I'm on Valium right yes, okay, so they know it's not recreational
 right
 I'm not sure you can take Valium recreationally can you well? I'm pretty sure that's what people do legally
 I don't know how my mom got saved so I asked of this question
 Because I knew everything because I come from the method is
 You wanna come to the gospel hall, my mother said,
 you're not going there, they're too religious.
 They don't drink, they don't smoke,
 they don't go to dances, they don't go to the picture hall.
 (laughs)
 Thought to myself that must do something.
 Anyway, in the meantime, my friend who'd invited me,
 her father had a heart attack and he died.
 Somebody had said to her mother,
 I'm so sorry to hear of your loss, Mrs. Morgan,
 and she said, the Lord must have needed it more than me,
 and she was bringing up three young little girls.
 And my mother said, oh, if you can get a piece of like that,
 Go!
 Ha ha!
 I've probably thrown in the Gospel before.
 Must be before she'd been very, very reluctant.
 Of course, when you go to the Gospel Hall, a scarab you would tell you.
 You'd learn a Bible verse and all these kids would stand up and say, "Is he killed such
 as such a jit?"
 And they'd come out with it and I'd think, "No!"
 So it was a very much, "If you don't trust in the Lord, you're going to hell!"
 Right.
 There was nothing.
 You know, as an Methodist we're quite refined and so left.
 You do call it wrong.
 But no, the Gospel Hall, it was...
 Didn't put it for about, you know,
 it shows you this day who you will serve.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>So of course, oh, it's terrible because in the school
 we had this Pentecostal brother,
 he was head boy, and he used to come in,
 and he would be thumping us with the gospel.
 I was like, the Sunday you'd be getting the gospel.
 And then he ended up, "Why go over this?
 "I'll just suss the Lord into my life and see."
 Said, "Lord, I don't really know if you're there,
 "but if you are, I'd actually be a Christian."
 and to market out and read a chapter of the Bible every day.
 So I started geneticism, the time I got to university
 I was nearly to the end of Revelation,
 but you know, plotting through so and so big that,
 so and so and so and so and so big that.
 (laughs)
 But that was my bargain, and I got baptized by emotion.
  </li><li>It's amazing to me that she'd been in church all her life,
 and yeah, it wasn't until she was 15
 that she understood the message herself,
 I should quite similar to you really, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I hadn't been in church every single Sunday,
 but I'd been in church a lot.
 I sang in the choir, it was part of a dramatine.
 Still had no idea the whole thing was about Jesus
 and the whole thing was about love.
 No idea until it was 15.
 I missed it.
  </li><li>I didn't realize until speaking to my mom.
 Well, of course I realized I just don't think
 I'd ever spent time thinking about it,
 but speaking to my mom today,
 I didn't realize that my mom and dad
 have been in the same church for 43 years.
 So long than I've been alive.
 And so when you think of the dedication of faithfulness that's required for that,
 I just ask my mum about that.
 Because I've got people who are friends now and they've left so many churches.
 You know, not for their fault, but because the doctrine has gone so bad,
 especially with this church of Scotland promoting same sex,
 marriage of ministers, etc.
 And I thought to be these 70s, not to find yet another church,
 must be all for. I've been grateful that I've been in one place.
 I'm one brother four weeks ago, said this sermon at night was, "We've been in Loughie
 for over 40 years, what have we done?" I thought that poor boy is going to
 ruin this because every week I've put up posts. Today was the camps. Mothers and
 toddlers, students over a hundred and two, just in my visitors' book that have come
 through your forest, you know, children's work, all day club, girls clubs, boys club.
 Yeah. But the first time I went to the meeting in
 Everest with your father spoke and he spoke on Mary and how she was
 criticise because she'd bought the other master box and the you know the point
 was she'd done what she could so that always stayed with me because you've
 had a terrific pre-stage.
 You know what's amazing babe is if you go on Facebook if you you follow my mum
 don't you face it. So right now you're seeing everybody from kind of all over the world
 really coming out of the woodwork and saying, "Lana, this is what you did for me. You know,
 hey, you might not remember me, but you did this and you did that." I think it's amazing
 because my mom and dad, you know, like I said, for 43 years, have been in the same thing
 over and over again, week by week at church. And I'm sure at times have been discouraged
 going, "What are we doing?" And yet now to see this legacy that my mom has really been
 a part of, you know, certainly within our family, you know, she's influenced, you know, me and
 my three sisters and we've influenced our kids.
 But even when they've come over and visited us, you know, she had a huge influence with
 Jess when Jess was living with us and, you know, the rat lifts and whatever.
 I mean, it's just, you can't help but fall in love with her and be impacted by just how
 well she loves others.
 Yeah.
 And so even in death, you know, watching her impact, people is just incredible.
 So we asked her about the whole dying thing and it was quite eye-opening when she said
 I've always felt that you've already got the next 24 hours. I mean, that's not the bottom at all
 But we're all dying love. It's all the same as you'll die. We're dying every day
 I don't I don't see this as a big but you know since I had this diagnosis last
 Then Christmas or of people that have died and I hope the paper every day
 It was 29 year old is is Grittil or eternal
 over on it last week and I think that's a bloody 29.
  </li><li>It was like a...
  </li><li>And six young men were come last week and you think,
 you know, but I don't think I'm dying, you know, I think,
 oh, we'll do this next week and we'll do that.
 And I keep saying that he's obviously got the wrong person.
 (laughs)
 He's the first to believe it.

  </li><li>Right.

  </li><li>Yeah, but you say that, yeah,
 the same time you've claimed your own funeral.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, it's a girl guy.
 So, how do you live the attention of?
 There's no tension, I just think.
 I like to be all good aisles.
 So, there you go, that's my mum in one sound about right there.
 She's planned her own funeral, but she is nothing but dying.
 She is a walking living paradox.
 She's awesome.
 Lastly, as someone who's seen her fair share of dysfunction, I asked her, "How do you
 avoid dysfunction?"
 This is what she said.
 Kate avoiding dysfunction in life.
 Well, as a Christian,
 I believe you're Bible input into practice,
 but I think on a general human level,

 And be there for them.
 The most important thing is you can give a tattoo at this time.
 Well, babe, our first ever podcast from Scotland.
 Scotland.
 Scotland.
 Land of the brave.
 Please stop.
 stop. We've loved being a Scotland. I'm just, you know, under the circumstance. I was going to say
 I'm sad I haven't got to see more of my friends, but that's not really why we came. And so apologies
 to everybody who knows me in Scotland and I didn't get to see you. We were just run off our feet
 really trying to be with my family and placate our kids when we weren't with our family. Please
 pray for us if you think about us. We fly back to Nashville on Tuesday. Apparently you're all getting
 hit by snow. So hopefully that doesn't interrupt their travel plans, but nevertheless, traveling
 with three small children is not my idea of fun. So please pray that I get upgraded to
 first class and Asia can be with the kids in the economy. I'd appreciate that.
 Don't pray that. Too late. I decree the thing. No, I undecreat them.
 You know what this podcast really has been missing? Bagpipes. We're filming in Scotland
