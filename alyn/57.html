<p> Welcome to episode 57 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Somebody has had their caffeine.<br/>
 I have had some, but I probably need some more.
 Based on the introduction, you don't need anything more.
 Well, I didn't sing a jingle, so clearly I need a little bit more.
 Why are you so tired, darling?<br/>
 Well, I didn't sleep that well last night.
 I ended up getting about four hours of sleep.
 That's never good. Why didn't you sleep, darling?
 Not entirely sure.<br/>
 It may have some sense to do with the quantities of marshmallows.
 I shoved in my face while you weren't watching last night.
 Are you kidding me?<br/>
 Well, because I haven't had much sugar in the last, I don't know, month or so.
 Uh huh.<br/>
 Except when you're cheating.<br/>
 What wasn't so much cheating?<br/>
 No, that's cheating.<br/>
 I rewarded myself.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I burned a ton of calories yesterday.<br/>
 My Apple Watch does not lie.<br/>
 Uh huh.<br/>
 And then you build them back in with marshmallows.
 They were just there and they were white and they were fluffy and they're
 taunting me.<br/>
 They were like, eat me, eat me.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And so I think eating the four or five or six that I did.
 Poor five or six.<br/>
 I lost count.<br/>
 Once the sugar high took over.<br/>
 I just used that many and I didn't notice.
 You have issues?<br/>
 Well, I thought I'd be safe because I ate them at nine o'clock.
 We went to bed at 11 o'clock, but I was awake till two o'clock.
 Who wasn't my finest hour of decision making?
 I think I need to go and help you with that by throwing out the rest of them so that you can't make the same error.
 -How was this week for you? -It was a busy week, wasn't it?
 I mean, I guess we say that every week. Meetings, meetings, and more meetings.
 But good meetings. -Well, let's not go so far as to say good meetings.
 Monday, we were in meetings pretty much all day against our will.
 At one point, I texted the rest of our team and said,
 "Literally, I'll kill you for making me sit through this meeting."
 In one of the meetings, the person presenting, and this wasn't somebody from Grace Center,
 but the person presenting used a mix of times in your Roman and comic sounds.
 At that point, in the presentation, at that point, I wanted to just, I'm sorry, darling,
 I know that's very painful for you.<br/>
 Oh, I was just like, is this a test from the Lord?
 Is this a test from the Lord?<br/>
 It probably was.<br/>
 How do you think you did?<br/>
 Well, yeah, let's move on.<br/>
 I mean, aside from those mandatory meetings that we couldn't escape, it was a great week.
 It was a good week.<br/>
 Ask me what my highlight of this week was.
 What was your high?<br/>
 Jurassic world.<br/>
 Really?<br/>
 In IMAX.<br/>
 Okay, can I just tell you?<br/>
 Emily Mason told us that the movie was calmer than the previous Jurassic parks and that
 no dinosaurs jump out at you.<br/>
 That is not the truth.<br/>
 That is not even remotely close to the truth.
 What did you think it would be?<br/>
 A movie of dinosaurs just reading poetry?
 I don't know.<br/>
 But there's definitely dinosaurs.<br/>
 I can think of like 10 scenes where a dinosaur jumps out of you.
 And it was in 3D.<br/>
 Well we saw it in iMac 3D.<br/>
 So that may have worked.<br/>
 And they jumped out.<br/>
 Good heavens.<br/>
 I almost jumped on to the little lady next to me at one point.
 She was squealing a lot.<br/>
 She was very cute.<br/>
 She kept screaming.<br/>
 And then she sort of curled up in the fetal position and basically was like almost like
 in her husband's lap throughout the entire movie, which he was smiling and quite enjoying her antics.
 I liked it from start to beginning. It was a perfect beginning. Yes, I like the start and the
 beginning as well. It's just that later into the movie, it wasn't so great. I'll plead the four
 hours of sleep and then the minute. No, I really liked it. I thought it was your classic summer
 blockbuster. It was really, really excellent. It was very good. And tonight we're going to go
 see Tomorrowland. Yes. Which I mean, see you're so excited about that too.
 Are you? I'm I think I'm more excited about Tomorrowland. Though I have no idea what to
 expect, I don't really know what it's about. It has George Clooney in it, that's all you care about.
 Right. What else do you need to know? Our deadline for S.O.S.L. was this week, so that was fun.
 Watching everybody finish plan. Thank you to everybody who applied. We are looking forward to
 reading all your applications this week and we'll try to get back to you as quickly as we can.
 So exciting.<br/>
 Today is Father's Day.<br/>
 I had to get it in there.<br/>
 You're just like a jingle machine aren't you?
 Wow.<br/>
 Aren't I?<br/>
 But Father's Day.<br/>
 It's Father's Day.<br/>
 Do you want to tell everybody what you got me for Father's Day this year?
 I got you the same thing I think I get you every year for Father's Day.
 It requires no creativity but you love it and that is the Apple's developer kit.
 That's right.<br/>
 This is how awesome my wife is.<br/>
 My wife and my children every year buy me a year-long membership to the Apple developer
 community, which even though I'm not developer, they give me access to all the pruelly software,
 which this year, this must just mark my maturity.
 This year I did not install the first round of betas.
 This is the first year that you've done that.
 Everyone.<br/>
 Because what usually happens is I install the betas and then my phone stops working or
 my iPad doesn't.<br/>
 And you spend several weeks frustrated, but you still claim it's worth it.
 But I kind of enjoy the frustration because it makes me feel like what Windows users must
 go through.<br/>
 Oh, you're trying to relate to the rest of the game?
 Yeah, really.<br/>
 It's like, you know, last year it was announced, I downloaded it, I installed it like 20 minutes
 before I was preaching it and it.<br/>
 And that wasn't my smartest move to install incredibly flaky software.
 So anyway, this year, what I learned is skip the developer preview and wait for like some
 of the betas, which should be at this week.
 That's exciting.<br/>
 Which I'm really excited about.<br/>
 Main topic for this week.<br/>
 It would be obvious if we would talk about Father's Day, but we talked about it last
 year.<br/>
 Not to say that we can't talk about Father's.
 Father's are amazing, amazing, amazing.
 But I'm not sure if we mentioned this last year when we're talking about Father's Day,
 but this particular season has traditionally been quite rough for you.
 Do you want to explain why?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Well, for me, June 21, which is actually today, this year, but June 21 is my dad's birthday.
 And on the year that he actually killed himself, he killed himself on Father's Day, which
 was June 23rd.<br/>
 So every time it sort of comes up to around Father's Day, I have not only his birthday,
 but the anniversary of his death.<br/>
 And also Father's Day, sometimes they're all on the same day, sometimes, you know what
 I mean?<br/>
 Well, they're never on the exact same day, obviously, because there's, but it's just,
 know, it's just historically been hard. It's hard not to think about him. It's hard not to miss him.
 Right. And then throw in when we got married. My birthday happens to fall within this week.
 Yeah. And it's Father's Day. You know, once we start having kids, not only did you have to wrestle
 through missing your dad, but there was a sense where you realized, Oh, I need to celebrate my
 husband. And the kids wanted to celebrate me. And the face facts, I wanted to celebrate me.
 Yeah. And it's, you know, on one level, it's, I don't know if it's the right phrase to say,
 it's just not okay, not to, but like I had to sort of go, okay, I want to celebrate you. I want
 to celebrate Alan. I want to teach the kids to celebrate you. And, but I also, in the midst of that,
 want to be real to how I'm feeling and allow God to come in, work in my heart anyway.
 As an aside, you know you're talking about you want the kids to celebrate me earlier today.
 I set up Tia who's now six with her her own iPad which she's had for a couple of years,
 but I set her up with an iCloud account so she can text people. And so her first text,
 I mean she said, well daddy, I can't write, but actually what we found is it really develops
 our writing and reading skills getting text from us. But I showed her the emoji page. So I said,
 I said, "Well, you can just text me with pictures."
 And she goes, "Okay, I'm gonna text you what I want."
 So my first ever text from my six year old is four emojis.
 The first one is a DVD.<br/>
 The second one is a CD.<br/>
 The third one is a bag of money<br/>
 and the fourth one is a diamond.<br/>
 (laughs)<br/>
 I'm feeling pretty celebrated.
</p><ul>
  <li>That's okay, honey.
 She sent me a hamburger.
 I was like, "Oh, look, T is texting.
 What did she do?"
 texted me a hamburger. She must want breakfast.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I should point out right now to all the adults
 that Tia likes, she's been asking me for all of your numbers
 so that she can text you, so brace yourself.
 Anyway, back to--
  </li><li>I think she might have a crush on Jeff's lotter, darling.
  </li><li>There's no thing, she just said,
 can you give me Jeff's lotter's phone number
 so I can text him?
 I was like, I'm not sure Jeff's gonna particularly appreciate that.
  </li><li>We're not sure he wants to hear from me, darling.
 But anyway, it's very cute.
 Anyway, sorry, we were talking about celebration in the midst of difficult circumstances.
 You had a revelation about that this week.
 As I was thinking about this week and doing the podcast, I was thinking, it is difficult
 to celebrate in the midst of things not being perfect, but actually, rarely are things ever
 going to be perfect.
 If you have to wait to celebrate until they're perfect, you're probably never going to celebrate.
 Right, and Pastor Jeff has talked about that this week.
 He was talking about how perfectionism forbids celebration.
 Because for the perfectionist,
 they can never acknowledge that something's good
 until it's good enough.
 So they just end up in this cycle
 where you can't celebrate anything
 and he was encouraging us as a staff
 to actually celebrate progress and not the goal.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I think too,
 like celebration also acknowledges trust in God.
 like being able to celebrate where things are at now
 without them being perfect,
 like just being able to go, wow God,
 I see all of this stuff.
 It doesn't mean you don't see all the other stuff,
 but being able to celebrate that also puts your heart
 in a position of trusting God and honoring God
 for what he's actually doing.
 I think there's such a temptation in life
 to look around at the things that aren't great
 and focus on those.
 And one of the things that Don said this morning,
 you know, when he, when he was talking about Philippians,
 Philippians doesn't say,
 "Look at whatever's not working out, whatever's dismal,
 whatever's horrendous."
 It says, you know, look at what's good and true
 and think about these things.
 And I think it's a great reminder.
 Like if you center your heart on being able to be thankful
 and celebrate the things that are around you,
 I think probably one, you're gonna invite more
 of those things towards you, you know,
 out of thankfulness, you're opening doors
 for better things to come.
 But it's not a lie to celebrate
 when there's also stuff that's wrong.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Right, you mean it's not fraudulent?
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause I think sometimes we think,
 like I remember right after my dad died,
 well, probably not right after,
 it was probably about seven or eight months
 after my dad died, I remember the first time I laughed
 and I remember thinking, why am I even laughing?
 Like, how can I laugh?
 He's still gone.
  </li><li>Right.
 And the fact is, it's okay to have, you know, it's more than okay.
 It's necessary to have moments of levity and being able to acknowledge when things are
 okay and it doesn't mean that everything's perfect.
 Right.
 So, I mean, I was just sort of thinking about that kind of stuff, like the challenge to
 not look around you and complain or, you know, but be able to look around you and go, "Okay,
 God, what can I celebrate in what you're doing right now?"
 really powerful thing because you tend to attract whatever you focus on. I think that's why I love
 being surrounded by childlike people. And I mean that in the highest form of a compliment. But
 there's people in my life who will find the good in everything. And I love those people. Because I
 don't know if I'm just hardwired. I mean, I don't know what it is, but I can walk into anywhere and
 notice, you know, the pictures that aren't straight or the light bulbs that aren't on or the fingerprint
 on an otherwise clean table and I can actually miss the greatness for one or two other things.
 Then I have people in my life who don't even notice those things and I'm like, "What is life like
 for you?" And it looks like life is much gittier for them than it is for me.
 Right. Well, that's the whole childlike-ness thing, isn't it?
 Right.
 Our kids really don't care if there's fingerprints or if there's whatever. They just
 walk in a room and want to enjoy the room, want to enjoy the people.
 That's probably because they're the instigators of all the fingerprints.
 Well, that's true, but I still think that there's something about the way kids view things.
 It just isn't the way that we view it. And there's probably something that's better about their view.
 With some friends coming to town at the start of the year and share with the staff at Grey
 Center, and they said something that stuck with me since January, and they said that celebration
 is the highest form of acceptance. And I've really felt like the Lord this year, this first six months of the year, has been really encouraging me to celebrate and to receive celebration.
 And you know, that whole thing of like celebrating the successes of other people. And I think that's a great, it sounds silly to say discipline.
 but i think sometimes if we're not careful we're so caught up on what's going on in our life
 that we forget to push pause and celebrate what's going on in other people's lives right
 and then you know bill johnson talking about honors that his description of honors brilliant
 he said honor is the ability to celebrate who someone is without stumbling over who they're not
 right talk to me about what that looks like in your life well i think in terms of like father's
 I mean, of course I post on Instagram and I was looking for a picture to post of my dad
 this morning and I guess I sometimes think like, if I post this, you know, does that,
 you know, I can post a picture of my dad and I can celebrate the things that he was without
 stumbling over the things that he wasn't because the Lord has healed my heart a lot in that
 area and I can absolutely celebrate him and be really thankful that I had him as a dad.
 You know, and he wasn't perfect, but God's taking care of the rest.
 You know, he's made up the lot.
 Right.
 And I think you have to be able to do that to be able to really love or appreciate anybody
 because nobody is going to be perfect.
 Right.
 So, so for me, it's just being able to go on Father's Day.
 Yeah, there's a lot that wasn't there, but hey, Dad, there was some things that you were
 really great at, and I'm thankful for those things.
 I've been really struck by when Graham Cook was here a couple of weeks ago, and he said,
 "You know, God doesn't look at what's wrong with people.
 He looks at what's missing from their experience."
 Yeah, so good.
 And so you think about people who are not perfect.
 The danger is that we, if we're not careful, will nullify what's good about them by focusing
 on what's not great about them.
 And that line, there's a danger sometimes when God's introducing new revelation that
 we write off what he's saying as purely semantics.
 So I remember when Chip Judd first taught me about boundaries, you know, 12 years ago.
 I was furious with his teaching because it sounded like he was splitting hairs.
 It sounded like semantic.
 It sounded like he was saying, "Well, you can't say you make me so angry because I don't have the power to make you angry."
 I was like, "Oh, this is ridiculous."
 So when Graham says, "God doesn't look at what's wrong with someone, he just asks what's missing from their experience."
 It just sounds like a nice, cuddly, politically correct way of saying the same thing, but it's completely different.
 It's totally different, yeah.
 You know, it instantly ushers in grace.
 It instantly presents an opportunity to help be part of the missing experience.
 And it's instantly make celebrating other people way, way easier.
 And it moves you out of judgment into mercy.
 Here's a fun exercise for our listeners this week.
 I'm assuming it's Father's Day everywhere.
 I guess it is.
 I know Mother's Day is different in.
 Yeah, I think Father's Day is still the same everywhere.
 Well, you know, you've probably been celebrating your father's.
 Maybe you haven't.
 Maybe like AJ, you had a, you know, a negative experience with a father.
 And maybe unlike AJ, you never got the restoration that you would have loved.
 Maybe the things that, you know, your dad was missing has nullified your ability to
 celebrate him.
 But I want to broaden this a little bit further afield than just fathers and just
 ask, who could you celebrate this week?
 And then how could you celebrate them?
 Is it a sampling as simple as writing them a card, dropping them an email, sending them
 a gift voucher, you know, whatever, how can you practically celebrate somebody this week
 and express to them your love and your affection for the fact that they're in your life without
 feeling like you're being insincere because you feel like you're overlooking the things
 they're not good at.
 Rather than feeling you need to overlook them, why not ask the Lord what is missing from
 their experience with him and maybe see if you can minister into that area.
 Yeah.
 That doesn't include here.
 I bought you a book on how to be a better boss because you suck at being a boss.
 Yes, that would not be under ministering.
 No, no.
 We have some listeners questions, babe.
 And one question, which I thought was really, really good fits in with what we've
 just been talking about.
 It's from Annie and she writes in.
 She says, "I feel like I have been in a season of waiting for an extended period of time
 and have seen and felt visible growth in my heart and life during the wait."
 My question is, in the waiting, how do you not lose hope in the very dream that you're waiting
 to see fulfilled? I guess, Annie, I guess my first response would probably be just being
 filled up. Like, keep looking at him. If we only look at the things that we're waiting for and the
 fact that they haven't arrived yet, then we're probably focusing on the very wrong thing.
 And it's like that watchpot never boils thing.
 You know, it's going to make everything feel like it's taking longer anyway because our
 focus isn't actually on the Lord, but on what we feel like we're waiting for.
 Does that make sense?
 So I guess my advice would be to just push into God.
 Like, I think no matter what it is that you're waiting for, the Lord isn't going to allow
 you to miss it as long as your heart is not to miss it. You know what I mean? As long as your heart
 is to push into God and be like, "Lord, I want everything you have for me." And you focus on him.
 Those things that you're waiting for are going to come when it's the right time for them to arrive,
 but it's probably going to feel like a shorter period of time if you can focus on him rather
 than focusing on the lack of them arriving. There's also the other element where character is formed
 in the absence of what you want. And so that it's very easy to praise God and to give him honor and worship and glory
 when you have everything you want. And it's not that that's cheap worship at all, it's very, very
 valid worship from an overflowing heart. But there's something about worshiping God and
 purposes in your heart to praise Him even before what you're looking for and the answer has come.
 Because there's something about declaring God's goodness in the seeming absence of his goodness
 that actually does incredible things for our heart.
 And like you said, babe, if you're just focusing on the negative, it tends to lead to bitterness
 rather than celebration.
 Yeah. So don't focus on the dream, focus on him, but realize that he's somebody who cares more about
 your dreams than you do.
 Yeah. That old ancient Chinese proverb, don't miss today by focusing on tomorrow.
 Is that an ancient Chinese proverb?
 I'm not sure it's an ancient Chinese proverb, but I think I saw on a P.F. Chang's
 fortune cookies. So there you go.
 Our second question this week says this. I just recently started catching up on all your episodes.
 This is the only podcast I currently listen to, and I love it.
 Thanks for a great show. I feel filled up when I write this into you and your guests. Well, thank
 you so much. This is the question. Do you have any wisdom on how to be kind and friendly to people
 without giving them the idea that you want a deeper relationship.
 I'm specifically talking about friendships with people of the same gender.
 There is someone in my life I've spent enough time around to know that I don't want a deeper relationship with.
 This is not a bad person, but I have reasons for not wanting to further this relationship.
 We work together so I can't just choose to never see her.
 In the past I might have opted for somewhat cold interactions and even avoidance, but that's not a healthy solution.
 Other than declining invitations to hang out which makes me feel unkind, even though that's not my intent,
 I haven't had an explicit boundaries talk with her.
 I may responder with a high gift of mercy so I find it very difficult to know how to still love this person
 and help her to feel accepted while maintaining the relational distance I need from her.
 Thank you for any guidance you can offer.
 I'm not sure I have any guidance that you might want to hear.
 Because I'm a much lower responder.
 I wouldn't personally have any of the feelings that you're having.
 So it sounds like feelings aside.
 It sounds like you already know what you want to do.
 You want to not develop a relationship with this person that you work with.
 Because they're not life to you on whatever level.
 On whatever level.
 I think the first thing you probably your heart probably needs to hear is that's completely OK.
 You do not need to be an intimate relationship with everybody you meet.
 You don't have to be friends with everyone.
 You don't.
 And especially the people that really want to be friends with you,
 and you really don't want to be, that shouldn't change what you're deciding.
 So it sounds like you're conflicted there.
 That's not a sentiment I'm familiar with.
 So pardon me if my advice seems a little bit cold.
 So I love that you're being powerful enough.
 you're not just choosing passive aggression.
 But I don't think there's anything wrong with declining invitations to hang out.
 Like the only way a relationship grows is either you invest it in it or they invest in it.
 And so if they're trying to invest in it by asking you to spend time outside of work
 or this or that the next thing, the simple way to ensure that you don't invest in it
 is to decline those.
 And if that leads to a conversation like, hey, how can we never hang out anymore?
 you can address that head on, but it doesn't sound like you're trying a backpedal relationship.
 It sounds like you're not wanting to move forward in the relationship, so it's unlikely that that's going to happen.
 You said other than declining invitations to hang out, which makes me feel unkind, even though that's not my intent.
 If I could just speak to your heart and just say you're not unkind for being honest with another person's feelings.
 What would be unkind is to actually accept an invitation you don't actually want to accept,
 because then that's fraudulent and you're actually investing in a relationship you have
 no desire to do so.
 So yeah, you'd end up hurting their hearts way more later on.
 It's way better to just be like, oh, thank you for asking.
 I don't want to do that.
 Right.
 And it's usually better to use language like I don't want to do that rather than, oh,
 I'm sorry, I can't because my mother's in time that week because that means next week
 when your mother's not in town, it's perfectly legitimate to request it again.
 So it's much easier just to be quite powerful in your conversations.
 Now the tricky part, most normal human beings will read those interactions and probably
  </li><li>Eventually.
  </li><li>Yeah, stop inviting you.
 It may mean that you have to have a more powerful conversation or a more direct conversation,
 which would usually happen in one of two situations.
 One, they're not picking up what you're throwing down.
 So you know, you maybe it may come to the fact that you have a more powerful conversation.
 That's usually that arrives at that person being powerful and coming to you and saying,
 hey, it feels like you don't want to hang out anymore.
 And at which point you can just say, yeah, you know what?
 My friendship quarter right now is completely full.
 I'm having difficulty maintaining the friendships I do have without trying to grow new ones.
 And I really want to honor the existing relationships I have.
 a very polite way of expressing what's going on in your heart, or they might have a meltdown
 if there's a bunch of stuff missing from their experience with God.
 And in which case, you might need to take a kind of software approach.
 I think basically you don't have to feel bad for not wanting to be in relationship with
 everybody that's around you.
 Nobody can actually do that.
 Nobody can be in relationship with everyone.
 Now you can be loving towards them, but you don't have to be their friend.
 So I think first of all, to give you the freedom to say, okay, that's not what I want.
 And it's okay that that's not what I want.
 And that's not unloving to not want that.
 I think the danger is somewhere along the lines, we've been taught that in order to be
 loving, you have to meet the needs of people that are expressing needs.
 That's not love.
 That's insanity.
 Yeah, you can't possibly meet every single person's needs that are around you.
 That's not your job.
 You're not designed to do that.
 So just free you up to be able to be you and be able to invest in the friends that you've
 chosen or that God's placed around you and be free to do that.
 It could be that you're going to end up having to have a conversation and you can still be
 kind and you can still be loving, but you need to be truthful because otherwise you're
 going to end up having the same conversation over and over again.
 So you do need to be able to say, "I really appreciate that you'd like to be friends or
 or whatever it is that they're asking.
 The thing is, I have lots of friends
 that I'm already trying to invest in
 and I just don't feel like I can invest in anymore
 at this time or however you wanna put it,
 but just be clear.
  </li><li>Well, that's it for this week.
 If you wanna see the show notes for this episode,
 go to allonagio.com/57.
 If you would like more information or more teaching
 on the snippet that we talked about there
 about setting boundaries with other people in relationships,
 We have a 3CD teaching.
 Also available is a 3MP3 download set on boundaries.
 You can go to our website, <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/boundaries to find out more information about that and listen
 to some samples.
 AJ, anything happening this week we need to know about?
 Nope.
 I think we're done.
 All right ladies and gentlemen, have an incredible week.
 We will see you this time next week.
 Have an amazing week.
 Well, we probably won't see you, but we'll hear you or no, you'll hear us.
 Okay.
