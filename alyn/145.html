<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones.
 Hey, Jones.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Why you wrapped up in a blanket?<br/>
 Because you keep trying to freeze me today with all these stupid ceiling fans.
 Is that a correct statement or an incorrect statement?
 Absolutely correct.<br/>
 It is so hot today.<br/>
 What was the temperature outside?<br/>
 I think ceiling fans are of the devil.
 I think we need to remove all ceiling fans out of our house.
 I want a ceiling fan in our bedroom.<br/>
 No, sir.<br/>
 I love it.<br/>
 Not going to happen.<br/>
 I like the noise.<br/>
 It's just an instant way of getting cold.
 Can I ask you a question?<br/>
 You also said you wanted to chandelier in our bedroom.
 Are you thinking a chandelier with a fan attached to it?
 I'm thinking, let's put the chandelier in the master bathroom
 and then put a fan above our bed.<br/>
 Negatory.<br/>
 Good, buddy.<br/>
 You love it.<br/>
 You often love the noise.<br/>
 Nope.<br/>
 our son and jay who's for as white noise machine it does in his bedroom and he likes it well.
 Tonight he said to me wait is my sound machine on and it's clearly good.
 You know just definitely he's tuned out he can't hear if it's on or off just terrifying actually think i need to take him back to the doctors he's coughing horribly and he keeps when i say stuff he goes what.
 What maybe is your role going to yeah i think we need to my tubes are a little bit.
 Clog to okay wait.<br/>
 Did you just kept me off because i started talking about my medical maladies yes.
 Okay folks i love my wife yeah and and there's so many things that she's so good at and being a wife thanks darling but one of the things she utterly.
 Sucks that if you any compassion.<br/>
 That is not true.<br/>
 I came in and checked on you on a regular basis for days in a row.
 Or men or wimps.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I do.<br/>
 And that it's medically proven.<br/>
 They're in lies of problem.<br/>
 Ask any wife.<br/>
 Was I sick this week?<br/>
 You were sick.<br/>
 How sick?<br/>
 The same amount of sickness that T was.
 You know, sweet little Tia who didn't complain and just ate a couple of popsicles and laid on the couch.
 No, you were sick.<br/>
 You were legit sick.<br/>
 I had the flu.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 The flu does not mess around.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 I don't think I've ever had the flu.<br/>
 I've had a stomach flu.<br/>
 Really?<br/>
 Yeah, I had a stomach flu back when I was a teacher, but I don't think I've ever had
 the flu.<br/>
 That thing was a beast.<br/>
 It was.<br/>
 So I started getting sick before my family arrived last weekend, and I just thought I
 was just run down.<br/>
 That's all I thought it was.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I don't think it was anything major.<br/>
 But basically they left on Monday and he just collapsed.
 And I just collapsed.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 It woke up Tuesday and just thought, I can probably get out of bed, but I have to cancel
 all my meetings.<br/>
 I'll try working from home.<br/>
 And then you spent Wednesday, Thursday, Friday in bed with a fever.
 Wednesday, I couldn't wake up.<br/>
 Wednesday was horrible.<br/>
 I had a fever all day and I just slept in 20 minute increments.
 And i try to be a good patient.<br/>
 It just if you see her she's making.<br/>
 I am sorry.<br/>
 I'm waiting silent.<br/>
 He faces that you are.<br/>
 What was the one thing you refuse to do for me?
 By you sugary drinks.<br/>
 No, by me right,<br/>
 being a right,<br/>
 being a is a drink that is just die and sugar.
 Right, being a is a gift from the heavenly.
 It isn't.<br/>
 It's horrible.<br/>
 Are you aware that as soon as you bought me, right?
 Beena and I started drinking.<br/>
 I got better.<br/>
 That is all true.<br/>
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 You were already getting better by the time I bought the right.
 Incorrect.<br/>
 OK, think about how much faster I would go over this if you just go.
 Maybe you could go online and look for some clips about how right?
 Beena makes you better.<br/>
 That's, you know, actually proven and for the unenlightened.
 Ribena is a black current concentrate.
 We should put that in quotation marks, black current.
 That I grew up with.<br/>
 I'm pretty sure no sort of black current ever ended up.
 All people who were raised in Britain.
 Remember that you would drink Ribena either in the summer as a special.
 Ooh, it's summer.<br/>
 That's a nice summery drink or when you were deathly sick, you would drink warm Ribena.
 If you had a cold or you would drink ice cold Ribena, they feed them Ribena.
 I'm telling you it's nectar and you refuse to buy me.
 In fact, I had to leave you highly manipulative notes around the house.
 Well, that's actually not why I bought you it.
 You know, not to bring my mother into this.
 Oh, dear.<br/>
 Here we go.<br/>
 The thing I miss most about my mom is that when I was sick, she was amazing.
 At just being Florence Nightingale.<br/>
 Oh, chicken.<br/>
 Oh, let me bring you.<br/>
 you are the anti florin's nightingale.
 Oh, thanks, babe.<br/>
 You're just like, nah, suck it up.<br/>
 That's not true.<br/>
 I made you soup and you're like, meh, I don't want soup.
 And I'd be like, hey, babe, do you want some of this?
 No, I just want a cracker.<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 So you weren't exactly like the easiest person to take care of.
 You know what, right now?<br/>
 I'm not sure I can get any of this podcast.
 My little heart is feeling so hurt.<br/>
 I'm sorry.<br/>
 I was a brave little soldier.<br/>
 You were very brave little soldier.<br/>
 I did not get out bed till Saturday.<br/>
 Yes, it's true.<br/>
 The thing wiped me out.<br/>
 So funny thing was on Friday, I remember waking up Friday thinking, man,
 I have a ton of energy.<br/>
 And I thought I had a ton of energy until I tried to use any of it.
 And then you'd like almost fall over.<br/>
 It was a mirage.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Very funny.<br/>
 Well, my right ear tube canal thing is totally blocked.
 So it felt like there was a giant magnet that was constantly pulling me to my right.
 And I would, I would fall over.<br/>
 Anyway, I should have videoed it.<br/>
 It was kind of cute.<br/>
 Clearly, you don't care to hear tales of my...
 Wows.<br/>
 Survival.<br/>
 Oh, survival.<br/>
 So, given my whole week involved being in bed, fighting for my life, what was your week
 like?<br/>
 My week involved apparently doing a horrible job of taking care of you while taking care
 of the children.<br/>
 Check.<br/>
 And then not much.<br/>
 I mean, there was two storms this week, wasn't there?
 There were non-events.<br/>
 events. There's two storms. I fully trust if you live in Nashville and you don't follow
 Nashville severe weather on Twitter, I doubt you live in Nashville. Okay. These guys are
 the greatest. I love them. The pieces. They're good. Yeah. They're superb. It's a group of
 amateur and maybe professional meteorologists who are superb, reading multiple sources of
 weather forecast data and giving you their considered opinion. Historically, they're amazing.
 What I say next is no dampener on my confidence in them whatsoever. On Monday, Monday morning
 about 8 a.m., they said things are looking pretty scary. Weather is notoriously difficult
 to accurately forecast for a variety of reasons. They're not melodramatic people at all, but
 they were indicating, hey, it's going to be pretty scary.
 And so we're left with this awkward thing of if the weather does get crazy, us canceling
 emanate is unfortunately one of the safest and wisest things we can do.
 We don't want people on the roads in horrendous downpour because when there is a storm, it's
 pretty severe.<br/>
 There wasn't really the risk of tornadoes.
 There was a risk of hail, heavy rains and thunderstorms warning.
 Right.<br/>
 I tweeted out to them, "Hey, what do you think about tonight?"
 And they were like, "Ah, it really depends on you don't want your people on the roads
 when the weather comes."<br/>
 And we just kind of watched it and about midday made a call.
 And the reason we do that is if we cancel, we need to give as many people as much a notice
 as possible.<br/>
 Yeah, if we wait until five or something, we might as well just try and pull off the
 service and see who comes.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Another thing is even if it's not bad weather, most people are like us watching and if it
 looks like it's going to be bad weather, history has told us that even when we run it,
 a lot of people stay home.<br/>
 Yeah, I mean, it's funny if you drive around Nashville, I mean, people seem to be terrified
 of moisture.<br/>
 So, you know, rain or snow or whatever people drive very, very timidly.
 And in truth, that storm between 6.30 and 7, it was chucking it down.
 I wouldn't want to have been driving in that.
 Right.<br/>
 Anyway, we made a decision to call it.
 I later regretted canceling it because I think we could have had it.
 But truth is, I was sick anyway.<br/>
 You were, you were.<br/>
 I don't want to be able to minister.<br/>
 You sounded super croaky, but cute.<br/>
 I can do it.<br/>
 I can do it.<br/>
 I'm going to go teach Germany.<br/>
 I had a killer message too.<br/>
 Well, there'll be other Mondays.<br/>
 Yeah, OK.<br/>
 And then Thursday had nothing to do with us, but the whole school system said, "Hey, we're
 going to let the kids out early around lunchtime, wasn't it?"
 Yeah, Davidson completely canceled school for the day.
 We got the kids at one and brought the kids home.
 And yeah, it was pretty much a non-event.
 There was some rain, but nothing impressive.
 And unfortunately, Nashville's severe weather and some other people got a beating for it,
 Which is ridiculous because they're amazing.
 So that was the most exciting thing with the weather.
 Other than that, I beat my high score bowling on Friday night.
 Thank you.<br/>
 Thank you very much.<br/>
 My new high score.<br/>
 Ready?<br/>
 Are you ready for it?<br/>
 Can I have a drum roll?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Oh.<br/>
 If you've got me a Ribena, sure.<br/>
 I did get your Ribena.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Well, I'll get your drum roll with the same taste that you got me a Ribena.
 Forgiveness, forgiveness.<br/>
 My new high score is 85.
</p><ul>
  <li>I don't know if that's good or bad.
  </li><li>Well, 300 is a perfect game, so it's not really good.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But it's better than my previous high score,
 which was 64.
 Of course, I bowl with either hand,
 'cause it doesn't seem to really make a difference
 which hand I throw with,
 I pretty much get the same sort of score.
  </li><li>Try using both and see if that improves things.
  </li><li>Ooh, very good.
 Yes, we went out and we celebrated a lean, my sweet friend.
 And a group of us went and did one of those progressive dinners.
 So we had appetizers one place and dinner somewhere else,
 then desserts somewhere else.
 And then we went bowling.
 It was fun.
 Wonderful.
 Yeah.
 That must be a nice treat out after you've looked after sick husband all week.
 Apparently I didn't look after a sick husband all week.
 Apparently I just tortured you or something.
 You know what, maybe if the shoe fits.
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong>
 Well, our main topic for this week is not a topic.
 It's a person.
 It is and we're so excited to introduce her to you.
 -Woo-hoo!
 -Jesse is easily one of our favorite worship leaders in the whole wide world.
 -Easily.
 No sense of hyperbole.
 No sense of exaggeration.
 -Nope.
 Voice of an angel.
 -Voice of a thousand angels.
 -Right there.
 -So what do you do to get your voice sound so good?
 Do you just gargle with castor oil?
 -Do you eat baby angels?
 I mean, what are you doing?
 [laughter]
 -I don't do anything.
 I literally don't do anything.
 not only are you one of our favorite worship leaders, but you're also the person that wrote
 the jingle that everybody just listened to at the start of this podcast. So we love you
 for a number of reasons. Incredible worship leader, accomplished podcast jingle writer
 and the voice of an angel. How did you get into leading worship?
 I try to think my parents are both musicians. I grew up in like a very musical household.
 And we, when I was little, my family was Church of Christ.
 And so my parents moved to Nashville and my mom actually started leading worship at our
 church, which was really amazing.
 And I guess I probably started, I mean, I've been singing since I was tiny.
 I like walked out singing, like I used to sing in the doctor's office and like in the
 waiting area, like singing at the top of my lungs.
 I think I started leading worship.
  </li><li>It's so cute.
  </li><li>Probably, I guess probably when I was a teenager
 in youth group, we had a really amazing
 kind of like worship coordinator for our youth group
 that was just all about like, you can sing,
 you're gonna do it, you can play guitar,
 you're gonna play guitar, like just very encouraging.
 So I guess that's kind of when I started.
  </li><li>So potentially your most anxiety-ridden season of life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Would you decide to stand up in front of people
 and do something incredibly vulnerable?
  </li><li>Yeah, I guess so.
  </li><li>And did you learn to play piano when you were a kid as well?
  </li><li>Yeah, when I was a kid, my mom plays piano.
 And so I just, and my dad plays guitar.
 I mean, I grew up sleeping in a sleeping bag
 with a portable TV in the studio
 while my parents were working.
 And we had a studio in our house.
 So it was just like, I probably couldn't have escaped it
 if I wanted to.
  </li><li>So your parents are professional musicians,
 that's all you've ever known growing up.
 And so you come by honestly.
  </li><li>Yeah, I kind of can't help it.
 (laughs)
 That's pretty cool.
  </li><li>We're glad you can't.
 When did you end up at Grace Center?
 Or how did you end up at Grace Center?
  </li><li>So I started coming to Grace Center.
 I was actually at school in North Carolina
 and I would come home on like my school breaks
 and a bunch of my friends who were still living here,
 like in Nashville were like,
 "Hey, you need to come with us to this thing."
 At Grace Center, and I had come to Grace Center
 when I was like, I would come to the youth group
 every once in a while when I was like,
 probably like 15, 14, 15, 16,
 just 'cause even when I was a teenager,
 the Holy Spirit was just like,
 so strong at Grace Center.
 And I would, I mean, I would come even as a teenager.
 So fast forward, I'm in college,
 I'm coming home on my breaks and start going to emanate
 just like whenever I'm home with my friends
 and you guys were there and I was like,
 oh my gosh, this is amazing.
 Grace Center has this incredible young adult ministry
 and it's so awesome.
 And I mean, the Holy Spirit was just as strong as it ever was.
  </li><li>And you were super comfortable
 with all the Holy Spirit stuff,
 even though you grew up church Christ.
 So I guess the church that we ended up at was very charismatic.
 So there was a lot of Holy Spirit.
 I remember, I just remember even at Kids Camp when I was probably like eight getting like
 falling out in the Holy Spirit, like that Kids Camp.
 So I feel like the Holy Spirit was the first person, I guess, I encountered.
 You know what I mean.
 So I don't know.
  </li><li>So you felt comfortable.
  </li><li>So you were freaked out at Emma.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no.
  </li><li>And how did you end up leading at Emma now then?
  </li><li>So I moved back to Nashville
 from being at college in North Carolina
 and moved back to Nashville and Aaron,
 my now husband also moved to Nashville.
  </li><li>Smart man.
  </li><li>At that time.
  </li><li>He knew what he was doing.
 (laughing)
 And he and I, we had sort of like just started dating.
 And so we started going to emanate all the time.
 He was pretty funny.
 I came, we were hanging out one day and he was like,
 "Hey, did you hear that they're doing like worship tryouts
 "for the worship team at Grace Center?"
 And I was like, "Oh, that's cool."
 He was like, "I'm gonna go."
 And I was like, "Should I go?"
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That's awesome.
  </li><li>He pretty much dragged me to worship tryouts.
 I was sort of like, I don't know.
 They already have a lot of people.
 I don't know, do I need to go try out?
 I don't know.
 So anyways, so Aaron drags me to worship tryouts basically.
 And I show up, it was so funny,
 me and Aaron and Josh Parsons, and maybe Trent,
 we all like--
  </li><li>Tried to add at the same time.
  </li><li>At the same time.
  </li><li>So funny.
  </li><li>And, you know, at Grace Center,
 you'd kind of do an encounter weekend
 before you serve in any area.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So the tryouts were like right before the encounter weekend.
 So I was going on the encounter weekend, the next weekend,
 and whoever was supposed to be leading worship
 on our encounter weekend got sick.
 So I ended up leading worship.
 Someone was like, maybe it was you guys.
 I'm like, hey, I think it might have been.
 Actually there's a girl named Jesse coming.
 That's where.
 Would you be able to lead worship on this encounter weekend?
 So that's kind of how it all started.
 Wow.
 So it's so funny that Josh Parsons, one of our worship and creative arts pastors now,
 audition. I mean, if you think about the caliber of the people who
 auditioned, like, you know, you, friend and Aaron and Josh. And so far,
 listeners, if you ever watched Grey Center live stream, there's a good
 chance that you're seeing those four people, some of the most prominent
 players on our worship team who are playing regularly where people who
 try that. And, you know, I, what I love is obviously you guys are so
 ridiculously talented. I mean, you live in Nashville, everybody, you
 It's fair to say everybody in Nashville is at a certain level, musically.
 Oh, yeah.
 And, and yet you guys humbled yourselves and came and tried out.
 I actually, I actually remember being there because I sat there and listened to everybody
 doing the tryouts and just being really excited.
 But that's the thing, that whole flowing with the Holy Spirit, I've been at Grace Center
 for nine years.
 Yeah.
 Wow.
 Nine years.
 I am in awe almost every Sunday at how a group of separate musicians can flow so well with
 the Holy Spirit at the same time without any seeming communication.
 How does that magic work?
 Like seriously, I know that I obviously I can see you guys do hand signals about where
 you're going to go next verse and here's a bridge and I'm not talking about that.
 I'm talking about when the Holy Spirit hits and we go into those long extended spontaneous
 parts, how does everybody know where to go or what you're doing?
 And how do you know if what you're doing is going to end up well?
 Or do I just think incredibly left brain?
 And that's not how it works in the moment.
 I think some of it is, you know, music.
 I guess, I don't know.
 I think that there's kind of a certain point in worship where you could, where you
 you get to kind of a place and then you get to kind of like jump off.
 You get to kind of like jump off the ledge into this thing of like uncharted territory.
 I'm really fascinated by this idea of like, you know, we can all kind of like go through
 and like sing the song and blah, blah, blah, but then we get to this place that's sort
 of like uncharted territory and it's sort of like a risk for everyone.
 And thankfully our church is very comfortable with being in uncharted territory, which a
 A lot of places aren't.
  </li><li>So when you go into those moments of spontaneous worship,
 do you feel like you know where it's going
 or you're just like, I don't know, here we go.
 And you just sort of do your best to do the next note
 that comes after the one that you just did
 and you're all sort of doing that.
  </li><li>So I think a lot of it is trusting each other
 like as a band, like really trusting each other.
 And our band is like, I mean,
 our worship department has just like cultivated a space
 where we can all really like trust each other
 in those moments.
 And so a lot of the time I don't know if it's gonna work.
 You know, I don't know if like work is the right word,
 maybe, but like a lot of the time I'm like,
 I'm not necessarily sure where I'm going.
 It's sort of like, like in the,
 like when you guys teach on the prophetic
 and you talk about like the tissue box,
 like you sort of pull out one tissue.
 And then when you pull out the first tissue,
 then the next tissue comes out of the tissue box.
 And for me, a lot of the time it feels like that.
 I might have just the first thing.
  </li><li>Like a refrain.
  </li><li>Yeah, like a refrain or like--
  </li><li>Or a chorus or--
  </li><li>Yeah.
 A lot of the time it just feels like pulling the tissue
 out of the first tissue out of the tissue box.
 And then it kind of goes from there.
  </li><li>That makes sense.
  </li><li>Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah, that totally makes sense.
 always fast-paced me. I love, I've always loved being around experts in their field and asking
 them to make their thinking visible because it's almost universally, they have the same
 reaction as you do where they're like, "Ha, well, that's interesting." It's like,
 if you ask a chef, "Well, how did you know how much oregano to add there?" and they're like,
 I don't know. When I'd be around profit, I said, "Well, how did you know that?" Most of them were like,
 "I just did." I guess as a teacher, I'm always interested in breaking it down so it can be
 reproducible. I love your answer. I think also the environment that Jeff and Becky and our leaders,
 Josh and Sarah and Chris before them have just created this incredible environment of
 freedom where people can see what's on the other side of, I wonder what happens if.
 Oh, for sure. And I think a lot of it, for me, has been about being patient, like just being
 really patient of like, you know, our services have kind of like a structure, you know, but
 Thankfully, our leadership is just so amazing that they've just created that space and that.
 I remember the first the first Sunday that Aaron and I played with Jeff came back into the green
 room and was just like, hey, just looked at both of us and was like, hey, I just wanted to tell
 you guys that there's no ceiling here. I was like, I just felt like I wanted to tell you
 that like anyone who if you had felt like anyone had sort of put a ceiling on you or on your gift
 or on like, you know, what you carried, like, I just want to like take that off right now that
 there's no ceiling here.
 And, um, you know, that's like, that was like my first experience.
 As, you know, being a part of the worship team in a service on a Sunday and having
 Jeff come up and say that was just like the most, I mean, the most like liberating
 thing. So I think that this is your senior pastor who's met you for the first time
 after you've led worship runs.
 Oh, yeah.
 Yeah.
 -Just come up and just... -That sounds like Jeff.
 -...read my mail.
 But that... I feel like that really set the tone.
 You know, that really set the tone for what the last several years in worship
 have looked like for me, like that there's no ceiling.
 And, you know, those times where I start to kind of feel like,
 "What if I'm doing this? What if I'm not going to be the right time?"
 That's all just like...
 I don't know when performance starts to creep in,
 what if I'm not doing a good job?
 What if I'm not doing good enough?
 What if I haven't picked the right songs?
 Then I just stop and I can just remember that moment of,
 there's no ceiling, there's no--
  </li><li>Right, and you get to be you and worship in front of
 your God.
  </li><li>Yeah, and the worst thing that could happen
 is that if I wasn't myself, maybe,
 everyone in our worship department,
 in our leadership has just so encouraged me
 just to be myself.
 And that has been the most like,
 it's like journeying with the Lord.
 That's been like the, maybe, I don't know.
  </li><li>It produces a fast fruit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When we are who we're supposed to be.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, if you're not who you're supposed to be,
 then you're giving a fake gift, aren't you?
  </li><li>Yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think one of the most memorable times for me personally
 and worship was, it must have been after the more conference. It was the Monday night after
 the more conference. It was you and you were leading and Chris McLawney and Luke Finch
 were also leading. The three of you were leading and we went into that extended time where it was
 just tongues and you started singing like an octave higher than you normally would and the glory
 of God just came down into the room and it was just unbelievable.
 I was just like this.
 People are on the floor everywhere.
 Stop.
 It was amazing.
 And I remember at the end saying to our, to our sound guy at the time, Marcus,
 I said, Marcus, I please tell me that that was recorded and it, and it was.
 And we put it on the internet and it broke the internet server that we had it on.
 And I think I've called it glory.mp3 years where it was.
 Oh, yeah.
 That is in the ass.
 Do you remember that?
 "Oh yeah, David Campbell had spoke that night."
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>And what was really funny was it was kind of,
 it was like the last session or something.
 I feel like it might have been emanated.
 It was like the last session,
 and I just remember I was so tired.
 I was like, I'm just gonna go,
 I was like, I'm pretty much just gonna go home.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>'Cause that moment sort of happened after
 whoever had spoken, and it was so funny
 because I was literally,
 I think I probably had my keys in my hand.
 like I was about to leave and I feel like maybe you grabbed me
 and you're like, hey, can you just go up there and like just
 sing with them or something?
 Okay.
 Cool.
 I didn't know the fartless.
 Yeah.
 So it was so funny because it ended up being like, I'm so glad
 that I stayed.
 You know, it's still my favorite thing to listen to.
 Like it's I listen to it several times a week when I'm having
 my God time, I listen to that track and I get hit by the Holy
 spirit every single time.
 Oh, it's the thing that I'm usually preparing all my messages to.
 It is my go-to soaking me.
 The only thing that's annoying is I interrupt it halfway through with a prayer.
 I'm like, "Shut up, Jones!"
 But it's kind of a nice interlude because when you come back into it, and the second
 part of it, for those of you who don't have a clue what I'm talking about, I'll find
 it, I'll find a link, post it in the show notes, and you can download it in the link.
 And we can break another server.
 Let's do it.
 Break the server.
 But it was amazing.
 I was as amazing for you in the moment or were you aware?
 Because it felt like, I don't want to make too strong upon here, but it felt like that
 began to define part of your sound.
 And I feel like whenever you sing that octave higher than it seems even feasible for your
 range that something happens.
 And you can't put the tune two together.
 It's not formula, but is that,
 have I just made that up or does that sound like
 that's true to you?
  </li><li>No, I think that's definitely true.
 What was so funny was like in that moment,
 I remember, which this has only happened to me
 like a couple of times, I remember sort of like in,
 this is gonna sound so weird,
 but I remember seeing the note.
 Like I remember seeing where,
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Like it would be like, oh, I should go here.
 why should go here, oh, it should go here,
 which doesn't really happen that much.
 And which was kind of weird,
 it's kind of like profits where they're like,
 oh yeah, and then I saw the this.
 It was really weird.
 It was like, I saw the note.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And it was, you know, in the moment,
 I was so glad that I stayed 'cause I was like,
 this is incredible.
 And I, you know, it was just as powerful,
 you know, for me as I think it was for everyone else,
 which, you know, was really cool.
 It was all spontaneous.
  </li><li>It was 100% spontaneous.
 And I think that did kind of sort of define a lot of,
 I guess, yeah.
  </li><li>It's not your go-to move.
 It's not your like, "Ah, nothing's happening.
 "I think I'll sing an octave higher
 "and watch the anointing come."
 That's not what I'm saying.
 But there, I felt like that you were,
 there was a difference in you
 after that moment than there was before in leading worship.
 And I don't know if that's too strong a point to make or not, but that was my observation.
 And I was wondering if you felt the same.
 Yeah, I definitely felt there was it was kind of funny.
 I think around the same time there was a night at emanate where Cole Johnson was leading
 and I was leading.
 I was just thinking about that.
 And I ended up it was just one night at emanate that a few of us were leading.
 We didn't know what to do.
 And you ended up coming up on the,
 it was just so funny.
 It was like the most teacher thing ever
 'cause Alan, you like came up onto the stage
 and you were like, okay, so then what if you went like,
 hi, like what if you sang higher?
 And then like what if you sang higher?
 But then like, no, no, no, no, no, no, saying higher,
 but then saying kind of like this.
 And then, and for a lot of people that, you know,
 as I'm saying that, it wasn't controlling at all.
 It was like we were all sort of like in this moment
 sort of like exploring together.
 And that night I ended up,
 I wonder if we could still find the stream
 'cause I was horizontal on the floor
 and it was just like my feet sticking out
 from behind the floor monitor on the stream.
 And I was like holding this microphone,
 like singing on the floor,
 everybody was just like out.
 It was like let the bodies hit the floor because it did.
  </li><li>Totally.
  </li><li>So I think that for me honestly was,
 that probably came out of that moment
 of just like kind of being able to work together.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And explore what the Holy Spirit was doing.
 That, I mean that night for me, that night changed
 like everything for me.
 And if we hadn't had that night,
 then I probably wouldn't,
 that other, the glory soundtrack night
 probably wouldn't have happened.
  </li><li>But then again, I think that
 Horst Back to Your Humidity, Jessie,
 that I am not a musician.
 And here you are taking musical cues from your pastor
 who, do you know what I mean?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>And I see you do that Sunday.
 I watch Josh and Sarah do that with Jeff as Jeff's,
 like I think we should do this.
 And you know, I watch our worship leaders navigate this thing.
 And I just think it's amazing watching you guys flow like that.
 And I think it's a credit to you as this completely humble
 person who's not precious about their gift at all.
 Because I know other worship leaders would be like, actually, I've got this.
 Thank you.
 Yeah, you're not doing that.
 Hey, I've been singing since I was two in a doctor's office.
 I'll have you know, but honestly, like, you're not like, Oh, seriously, do I interrupt
 your sermon with the verse that you should say next?
 Well, then don't come and tell me what I should, you know, and I, I think that's
 part of the ingredient that makes worship a grace and are so wonderful and utterly amazing.
 Oh yeah, for sure.
 I remember when Chris was on your podcast.
  </li><li>McLarney? - Yeah.
 He was talking about,
 just kind of like along the lines of being humble
 and like taking advice.
 And he was sort of talking about like,
 he was saying like the decisions that I made as a dad,
 the decisions that I made like to be a better dad
 and like to be a better husband, you know.
 are, those are the decisions that have affected his,
 I guess, like, quote unquote, anointing.
 Like it hasn't been anything about like,
 musical decisions or whatever.
 It's like character decisions.
 Yeah, like character decisions.
 I remember Jeff interviewing a great man of God
 and Jeff asked him, "When did you see the anointing
 "increase in your life?"
 And this man of God said, "When I treated my wife
 "with respect."
 Oh, okay.
 Oh, amazing.
 So just even as we're talking about worship,
 I was thinking about, and I texted you after I heard it,
 but I watched the TV show Nashville.
 And it's so funny because I'm not into particularly
 dramatic, whatever, but because when it first started,
 we had a friend who was on it for a couple of shows.
 I started watching it and fell in love
 with one of the characters and just really liked
 that storyline.
 And so I just sort of kept watching it.
 of course they've just killed that person off,
 but I'm watching this show and all of a sudden,
 and I knew, 'cause I think you had Instagrammed about it,
 that you were singing on this episode,
 but I didn't really register that,
 but I'm literally watching it,
 and all of a sudden, I'm not joking,
 I feel the anointing in my living room,
 and I realize you're singing.
 I'm not kidding. - That's amazing.
  </li><li>It was amazing.
 I don't know if we can post a link
 to this song that she sang.
  </li><li>Of course we can.
  </li><li>Well first of all, they kept the whole song in,
 which I was like, wow, that's amazing.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I was not expecting that.
  </li><li>I mean, it's just basically you singing
 for like five minutes while they show stuff in the back.
 And I was just like, oh my gosh, this is amazing.
 But seriously, I just kept thinking,
 anybody watching this show right now is feeling the anointing,
 whether they can realize what it is or not,
 is something else, but there's gonna be something
 that stirs in them as a result of that.
 And I just thought that's so super cool of God.
 How does a worship leader end up singing a song on a hit TV show?
  </li><li>Hit TV show, explain that for.
  </li><li>Well, most people don't know is that I'm actually spending
 like the majority of like my Monday to Friday writing.
 So I, a lot of people don't know.
 I write a lot for film and TV stuff for placement.
  </li><li>Explain that to people who don't understand
 what that phrase means.
 So all of the songs that you hear in ads, in TV shows,
 I'm trying to think like, yeah,
 so if you're watching an ad and you hear a song
 in the background, if you're watching a trailer
 for a movie and there's a song in the trailer,
 or if you're watching a TV show,
 and there's the season finale with the big song,
 that's the kind of stuff that I've actually been writing
 for the last couple of years with,
 specifically like with kind of like a husband and wife couple and we've been writing for
 that. We have like our own little like we decided to make like a little band that we
 called Bien and that's kind of our stuff that's you know that we're pitching all the time
 for film and TV.
 Oh cool.
 Yeah.
 Okay that makes sense to me because I had always wondered what Bien was.
 That's Bien.
 Because obviously the new EP which we're going to talk about is under your name so I was
 like I thought Bien was what you guys were.
  </li><li>Okay, I got it. - Oh yeah, okay, get it.
  </li><li>So we had kind of started being,
 it had sort of just evolved out of us writing all the time.
 And so it's really fun to kind of have like a little side
 project that's like a collection of like these really fun
 like pop songs, kind of like out in the world.
  </li><li>So aside from being on Nashville,
 where else would have we have heard you on TV,
 but not realize?
 Didn't you do something for small little jewelers?
 I forget that.
  </li><li>Oh, they're tiny, tiny jillers.
  </li><li>The biggest thing that I've had so far
 is probably for Tiffany's.
 I had a Tiffany's Christmas ad.
  </li><li>So cool.
  </li><li>A couple years ago.
 And just then like a couple other smaller things,
 like a lot of ABC family shows and a couple MTV shows.
  </li><li>That's amazing.
  </li><li>That's really cool.
  </li><li>That's amazing, I love it.
 So you have a bunch of projects.
 You're a worship leader, you're singer-songwriter,
 You're doing all this stuff with BN for TV and movie placement.
 And you just released an EP yesterday, which is amazing.
 Talk, talk just about the whole EP, Wild Honey, which by the way, I was
 listening to it and I thought, man, this is an amazing 80s pop feel to it,
 which is weird because we're even alive in the 80s.
 Yeah, where are you?
 It just missed it.
 Wait, wait a minute.
 You feel cool.
 So talk about the album and it does have an absolute 80s pop filter.
 How did you decide on that?
 Um, well, as I mentioned earlier, both of my parents are musicians.
 And so I mean, I grew up just surrounded by incredible music and incredible songs.
 They're both just amazing songwriters.
 And, um, so, you know, we were always just listening to music and, you know, a lot
 of the music that we were listening to.
 Like I remember my dad giving me Paul Simon's Graceland, which I love Graceland.
 It's one of my favorite albums.
 AJ and I both love Graceland.
 When we were on a road trip, it's all she wanted to say to that.
 It's me.
 Peter Gabriel.
 It's, I mean, why would you want to listen to anything else?
 Oh, yeah.
 I love Peter Gabriel.
 I love Paul Simon.
 Like that's the kind of stuff that I grew up.
 Me and AJ just need to like, yeah, road trip to California.
 Yeah.
 And we're going to listen to Paul Simon on repeat.
  </li><li>So I just grew up listening to like Paul Simon, Fleetwood Mac,
 like Tom Petty, my dad is like obsessed with Tom Petty.
 I don't even think what else, I mean Bruce Springsteen,
 there's so much weird, I just grew up like surrounded by this,
 like just incredible music because that was just the environment
 that my parents really like cultivated in our house.
 So that was like a lot of the stuff that really kind of inspired the production.
 And production wise, I also really wanted to just like explore a lot of stuff.
 I didn't really feel like people were doing.
 Um, like I felt like people were really exploring like the sense, like a lot
 of sense and all this stuff, but, um, I wanted to bring back like guitar solos and
 really arranged like background vocals and like drum machines and all the stuff.
 So that was some of the stuff that really,
 like production wise really inspired me.
 And the other thing that I think kind of like the spirit
 behind it was Aaron and I watch a lot, like on repeat,
 we will watch these old YouTube videos of Rich Mullins.
  </li><li>Oh, wow, I love Rich Mullins.
  </li><li>We are like avid Rich Mullins fans
 and we will just like watch these videos of him
 just like playing and singing.
 and there is like such a spirit to them
 that's just like this really sweet, sweet spirit.
 And like even like Peter Gabriel just has this like
 incredible spirit and I love just like these pop artists
 that are, you know, I know Rich Mullins was like worship stuff
 but really fascinated by like pop artists who are like
 really incorporating all of this sort of like
 spiritual stuff and their lyrics.
 Yeah. If you listen to the lyrics, that's, you'll really hear a lot of that.
 Speaking of which, I wrote down one of my favorite lyrics from one of my favorite tracks, "Holy Ghost."
 This line here, "If you can raise Lazarus up from the dead, surely you can raise up the
 cynical graves in my head."
 So good.
 You're one of the least cynical people I know.
 But that's true.
 Is that because God's raised up the cynical graves?
 I try.
 It's hard.
 It's hard to not be cynical.
 Isn't it?
 And like being married, like it's hard to not be critical and
 yep, cynical and negative and that's the real work of marriage.
 That is a real work.
 So talk us through the process of the new album.
 How long does it take?
 And what do you start with?
 You start with melody.
 Do you start with lyrics?
 Is everything different?
 So a little backstory, I hadn't written a song.
 This whole thing has taken probably about like three, three and a half years.
 Wow.
 And I hadn't written a song in probably like a year and a half, maybe like two years
 before this whole process sort of started.
 And I had sort of felt, you know, in this time of like not really having written a
 song I felt like the Lord is like, "Hey, what if you made a worship album?"
 I was like, "What if I didn't?"
 And he was like, "What if you did?"
 And I was like, "What if I didn't?"
 He was like, "What if you did?"
 I was like, "What if I didn't?"
 And I was like, "Well, I think it was, I was like, I don't, I mean, hope no one gets mad
 at me for saying this."
 I was like, "I don't really like Christian music.
 I don't really, this isn't what's inspired,
 I'm inspired by all this other stuff over here.
 And I think I was really scared that if the Lord
 was like inviting me to that,
 that it was gonna have to look a certain way.
 And sound a certain way and all this stuff.
 And Shannon McLaren, bless Shannon McLaren.
 She's awesome.
 Hey, what if it doesn't look like
 you think it's gonna look like?
 And I was like, that I could work with.
 So I think a little bit grudgingly,
 I was like, okay, Lord, like we can do this.
 And around that same time, John Engleman,
 sweet John Engleman gave me just a word one night
 that was like, hey, so I feel like you think
 you're in a desert, but the Lord is actually saying
 that that desert is a riverbed,
 'Cause a desert and a riverbed look really similar.
 And the point of the word was sort of like,
 this thing that you think,
 the areas of your life that are looking really desolate
 and looking like you're not sure what's gonna happen,
 that there's a river that's about to start running
 through that.
 Around that time, Aaron and I had just gotten married
 and we had just been going through a lot.
 you get married and you go through a lot.
 And we had both sort of like separately
 been having some different things going on.
 We had a lot of stuff just going on in our personal lives
 by the time we got married.
 And during this season, we were both sort of like,
 you know, what do we feel like you gave us this dream?
 We feel like you've given us like these creative
 like pursuits to like go after
 And like at the same time, like where are you?
 Like why aren't ends meeting?
 Why aren't, why isn't like any of this coming through?
 So it was sort of like for me, I was totally experienced,
 not having written a song in forever.
 It was sort of like I was experiencing a lot of my life
 looking like that kind of desert.
 And so, you know, this whole idea of like wild honey,
 you know, there's that sort of John the Baptist
 in the Bible and he eats like bugs
 and wild honey in the desert.
 And for me, wild honey was sort of just the symbol
 of like provision in my life that like,
 I knew that the Lord was like gonna bring,
 even though like a lot of it didn't seem like it was working
 at the time. - Right.
 That's amazing.
  </li><li>I'm trying to think.
 So, and after that, the songs just started,
 the songs just started coming.
 Like the first song that I wrote out of that was "Wrestle's Heart"
 which is like crazy to think that like,
 after not having written for really like a year and a half,
 two years, wrestles hearts,
 like the first thing that comes out,
 which is like really amazing.
 And I wrote it pretty much in like one sitting,
 which I like never do.
 Production wise, everything kind of started with,
 so I'm totally obsessed with my iPad and GarageBand.
 Everything started with like these little GarageBand demos
 that I would just like sit and make in my living room.
 Like I was like tapping out all the beats,
 Like a lot of the BGVs that are the background vocals that are still in there are like iPad
 background vocals, like a lot of like the shakers and like these little like percussive things.
 Some of the synths are like garage band synths that have like been there from when I started
 writing these songs.
 So,
  </li><li>Wow, that's amazing.
  </li><li>We tried to like keep a lot of that and keep like the integrity of like kind of like the
 magic of those like original, original demos.
 You totally get a feel for that as well.
 One of the things I think that probably nobody would ever know this because they never get to see the inside over those garage button files.
 I remember one day you sent me some files and I opened up and I was amazed that it was like 10 layers of vocals.
 That you tracked yourself 10 or 11 times and then layered them and you'd like manually made your own vocoder.
 And I was like, this is amazing.
 And all these little harmonies and, you know, pitch shifts and it was just amazing.
 And then I couldn't also believe that you'd sang into the iPad.
 Like you just used the iPad microphone.
 It sounds amazing.
 It seriously sounds incredible.
 Like, Apple, please don't change the iPad to like once, you know, in 10 years, I'm like
 still be trying to figure out a way to use my like, how did it iPad?
 Because it sounds so good.
 That's awesome.
 So Jesse, when you reflect on the last couple of years of your life, how would you encourage
 other people, or what would you encourage artists to do to get ready to be able to walk
 into the thing that they have next?
 Because surely you felt like quitting or the project had grown stagnant, or is this
 ever going to actually work. I mean, three and a half years is a long time. So how would
 you encourage other creative professionals just like A.G. was saying?
 So I think like in the middle of all of these kind of like things that we were pursuing
 like creatively, we also just, we took at some points what seemed, what might like seem
 from the outside like a step backwards. Like last year we did the school, so do school.
 Yeah, woo hoo.
 And for us, it was sort of like,
 oh, we have all these things and we wanna go
 and we wanna do all this creative stuff.
 And there was really an invitation from the Lord
 to do the school at what for us
 looked like a very inopportune time.
 Right.
 But I think when you give up your time to the Lord,
 when you, if there's something that the Lord is asking you
 to give to him, do it.
 And you'll see like the fruit on the other side.
 Like I think because we, you know,
 gave a year to the Lord,
 which looked like giving like three days a week.
 When we had, we were like, you know,
 we have this project, we wanna get out,
 we wanna do all this, we wanna do all this.
  </li><li>And you spent several thousand dollars
 coming into the school.
  </li><li>For sure.
  </li><li>Which you could have spent on your EP.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so.
  </li><li>It's totally backwards.
  </li><li>The whole kingdom is backwards.
 The whole kingdom is 100% backwards,
 but it was like because we gave like our,
 I think a lot of, you know,
 I think like a lot of the fruit that we're seeing right now
 is because of, you know,
 kind of like sacrificing our time and our money and
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Our hearts to the Lord and, you know,
 we're just seeing like an incredible return on that,
 you know, not just creatively,
 but like in our marriage, in our lives,
 in our relationships, you know, in our community,
 you know, the, just like the fruit of following the Lord
 has just been more than we could have imagined, you know?
  </li><li>That's so good to hear.
  </li><li>Love it.
  </li><li>We love the school and we love teach people in the school,
 but we love when, when--
  </li><li>When people can identify after the fact, oh my gosh,
 this was a game changer, it's super encouraging, isn't it?
  </li><li>'Cause you're right.
  </li><li>That must have seemed like a detour.
  </li><li>Oh, 100%.
 We were like, we have a project coming out,
 we're gonna go on the road,
 we're gonna like do all of this and this and this.
 And it was like, "Lord, what?"
 (laughs)
 But like, it was like the best decision
 that we could have made probably.
  </li><li>So I know this is probably like,
 you asking me what's your favorite child,
 but what's your favorite track on the EP?
  </li><li>Oh, that's so hard.
  </li><li>Right?
  </li><li>It's so hard.
 I mean, it's probably,
 there's like three that are close to I.
  </li><li>Okay, tell us the three that are close to me.
  </li><li>Probably like number one would be restless heart
 just because,
 I don't know.
  </li><li>It was the first one out of the gate.
  </li><li>It was like the first one out of the gate
 and it's just a really special song to me.
 It's kind of like about the Lord,
 but also like Aaron also like, you know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>My other Holy Ghost is like really fun.
 And Ben Helson's guitar solo is just face melting.
 And I love--
  </li><li>He's a seriously talented man.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Everything in the man
 does make it. - He's incredible.
 And there's some like,
 Amy Grant-esque background vocals in the chorus
 that I love. - Yeah, that's fun.
 And then my other favorite is probably living on your love
 that it's probably the most like Peter Gabriel-ish-ish,
 Peter Gabriel-ish out of all of them.
 But the lyrics are, what's really funny is
 that I sang the demo in like a food line
 parking lot while Aaron and I were like on a road trip.
 He like ran into food line and I like sat at the car
 and like sang the, I hadn't totally figured it out yet.
 And I just like sang it in one pass
 and this like food line breaking lot.
 And that was like the demo that we went off of for--
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>The rest of it.
 But--
  </li><li>I think hearing all that,
 Jesse would be super encouraging to other people
 that are like, I can't do this.
 I don't have a full studio in my house
 or I don't, whatever.
 Like just that you guys sort of just went for it.
  </li><li>Oh yeah.
  </li><li>You know with what you had
 and actually love what you ended up with is so cool.
  </li><li>Oh for sure.
 If I had like waited until I had everything in order,
 I wouldn't have an EP right now.
 Like even it's kind of all been like this little process
 of like saying yes, I mean like the very first step was like,
 okay, God, like I guess I'll do this.
 And you know, now I have something that I'm like really proud of,
 which is like that feels like me and it feels like this 80s baby
 and it's totally worship to the Lord.
  </li><li>It's awesome.
 like it's totally like the my offering
 into the world right now.
 But yeah, it's totally that thing of starting small.
 Like I just kind of started with what I had.
 I was like, I have an iPad and it has garage band.
 And like I think part of, and a lot of that
 was like a lot of those things
 that I really started with at first
 were the really magical things that like
 made it feel magical in the end, you know.
 back to living on your love, that one is the lyric that isn't necessarily like very A to B,
 but it's not the most like narrative lyric in the world, but it's really special to me just because
 every single line is like this like little collage. It feels like just like a collage of my life.
 Like these little moments like Aaron and I would have or this moment of like
 like a moment with the Lord or just like all these different things that that one's just like
 really special in the strings or beautiful and so cool. Yeah, I don't know. Well, congratulations
 and all your hard work. Thank you. Doing anything for three and a half years is just astonishing.
 And to see it go from, you know, star watching you get through all the hurdles that are just
 involved in producing anything to being released yesterday is amazing. And we just love it. We
 We obviously bought a copy of the album because we totally want to support you.
 Guys!
 We're so excited for you.
 Where can people get more Jesse Erle?
 Oh my gosh.
 Wherever music is streamed or sold.
 You guys can find it on iTunes.
 You can find it on Spotify.
 Apparently, you can find it on Amazon Music.
 I have never used Amazon Music, but it's there.
 It's there.
 And the album is called?
 It's called Wild Honey.
 And Jesse Erle, obviously the artist.
 Where can people follow you on social media?
  </li><li>My personal favorite would be,
 they can follow me on Instagram at the Jessie Early.
 It's a little self-centered, but.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It's so hard though to come up with one that's easy to find
 and isn't self-something, yeah.
  </li><li>I don't know why you guys just didn't use
 your first name like me.
  </li><li>Well, you were an early adopter,
 like so early that nobody knew it existed.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It also helps that my parents give me
 an obscure wealth spelling.
  </li><li>Right, it's true.
  </li><li>Nobody's really looking for your name.
  </li><li>Yeah, so you can follow me on Instagram
 @TheJesseEarly on Twitter, @TheJesseEarly,
 and on Facebook.
  </li><li>Well, we love having you on the school.
 We've loved watching you guys graduate.
 We love you and Aaron, you guys are amazing.
 We love the new EP, congratulations,
 and all the hard work. - Thank you.
  </li><li>So exciting. - And thank you
 for taking time out your week to come
 share on our podcast.
  </li><li>Oh, this is the best.
 I'm an avid podcast listener.
  </li><li>Oh. - I have, I keep up
 with the Joneses. - Yeah.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Can I ask a question though?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Favorite Peter Gabriel song?
  </li><li>Oh man.
  </li><li>Really with our last seven minutes
 for talking about Peter Gabriel songs?
 I quit.
  </li><li>Favorite Peter Gabriel songs?
  </li><li>In your eyes is really good, obviously.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>There's another one.
 Okay, so Micala, Micala, walked down the aisle
 to this version of Peter Gabriel doing a song
 by a different band, but it's called Mirror Ball.
 and it just, it got me.
  </li><li>Wow, I haven't heard it.
  </li><li>It's amazing.
  </li><li>Oh, look at that.
  </li><li>In your eyes is my jam though.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Totally worship song.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's a 100% worship song.
 It's amazing.
  </li><li>The Marvelous, Jesse Early.
