  <li>AJ Jones.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>How are you my darling?
  </li><li>I'm good.
  </li><li>You look beautiful today.
 Do you know that?
  </li><li>Thank you, Derek.
  </li><li>I looked across at you when you were cooking earlier
 and I thought, my gosh,
 your hair looks like Jennifer Aniston's.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm that's lovely.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That is a compliment, right?
  </li><li>It is.
 Sure, she is great here.
  </li><li>All right, tell me three of your favorite things
 that happened this week.
 Go.
  </li><li>Three of my favorite things that happened this week.
 soaking together we soaked together this night to Jesse early. Do you like the way I
 didn't say anything creepy there? That was a really good, great control and that's one
 two would be uh probably having Dan fairly here he's a very good teacher. He has, he's
 really enjoyed having him at emanate as well and um and three would be going to wild ginger on
 on Halloween evening because there was nobody there and the kids were so well behaved and
 it was so nice.
 Good answer.
 Thank you.
 I'm about to Trump you.
 My top three favorite things was having a day off on Wednesday.
 That was amazing.
 You've had your turn.
 I'm so sorry.
 Oh my God.
 You blew it.
 And other stuff.
 We had lunch at Silly Euss.
 We had the whole day off.
 We did.
 We had the whole day off.
 Because when you watched our I come betters.
  </li><li>Or what?
  </li><li>Our ankle biters.
  </li><li>Yeah, this is the first time in a long time
 we haven't been responsible for small children.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We were in the Pinewood social,
 which we'd seen about Instagram.
 I thought, "I'll just skip it, looks too ponzi."
 But it was actually really, really good.
 You know what it reminded me of?
 Was the Hollywood/Brown Derby in Hollywood Studios?
  </li><li>It did, it did.
 Hollywood Studios, Disney, Epcot.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Hollywood Studios?
 the brown derby was an abcote or the derby thing was an abcote.
 No, it wasn't. It was the movie theme park. Anyway, it reminded me of that restaurant.
 Open plan, serve virtual dress the same way. You're just tying up on this, aren't you?
 Yeah, I'm going to have to look it up.
 You can look it up on a podcast in the next week.
 So that's number one day off. Just I really enjoyed that day.
 And the coffee at the Pinewood Social is crema coffee, so it was fantastic.
 I don't care about coffee so that didn't do anything.
 But I just feel that our listeners should know.
 Number two was getting the screen in porch,
 wrestled into submission with the help of Matt.
 You did an amazing job.
 It looks brilliant.
 Thank you.
 And then number three was probably the Scandinavian snack bread
 that I had just before I came in that you don't know about it.
 I know.
 You did not.
 Naughty boy.
 But as you said, we're down fairly coming.
 For those of you who don't know Dan, he's the dean of everything at Bethel.
 the Dean of everything. That's the new job that we've given him after we kept introducing him as the
 Dean of everything. Yeah, he's on the senior team at Bethel Church in Reading California,
 and he's just a great, great super mellow, loves pizza, loves Jesus, is an outstanding teacher,
 and has got just a really, really, really long history with that church. He predates Bill,
 and we just love, he's been so gracious. He's come in three years in a row, and we just love it when
 when he comes in and we got to pick his brain about year two, etc, etc, etc.
 Yeah, he's awesome. Halloween, we put up a post on Halloween. So if you care what we think about it,
 there's a post there. Everybody, every, the difficulties, I don't really want to talk about
 Halloween because I don't want people to confuse and think it's a primary message of ours. It really
 isn't. I don't care about Halloween. And that's the difficulty in not caring about Halloween. You
 stand out about everybody who does care about Halloween. But anyway, I'm talking about it.
 I don't even want to talk about it. We've got our website, we put up a blog article about it.
 Yeah. And our kids got sick. Yeah, they did. Except. Except Abby, which is strange.
 Abby's fine. And even tea and MJ, even though they're sick, it's just double barrel. It's
 not. Yeah. Rivers of snot. And MJ is like Velcro. Oh, he's so. So no matter where you are,
 Or he wants to touch himself to you.
 He just wants to stand next to you or sit next to you or if you're lying on the floor
 lie.
 I want to try and have a nap on Friday and he, you were supposed to be watching him.
 Oh sure, just throw that.
 And all of a sudden the door gets flung open.
 He loves flinging open our bedroom door.
 Ta-da.
 Ta-da.
 And then he comes over and says up, up.
 So I let him up into bed of course.
 And then he comes over and snuggles and rubs his nose against my nose, which is really
 cute normally, but when there's like so much snark flowing, it's not the best thing ever.
 No, not good. It's gross. But he's adorable. All right, our topic for this week is
 Duh-duh-duh boundaries. You really want a musical accompaniment to this podcast, which I love.
 These are the boundaries that we live by. I don't know that much. Where did you,
 when did you come into contact with the boundaries? And before we even start that,
 Let's just describe what boundaries are.
 I would say that boundaries are being able to say no and hear no in relationships without
 panicking.
 Oh, that's good.
 Thanks.
 I think boundaries help you understand that which you're responsible for and that which
 everybody else is responsible for and not crossing the threshold or those things.
 With that in mind, where did you first hear about boundaries?
 I probably first encountered boundaries just being married to you and not realizing I didn't have
 good boundaries, particularly with my family. I was, uh, I was okay with boundaries, I think
 with friends and stuff, but with my, with my family, I was just like, I'd get rolled over.
 So why do you think that is? I think probably a lot of people have a hard time holding
 boundaries with their families. There's something in here that goes, well, they're my family,
 and so I should. Right. And you start down the shooting on you. The shooting, yeah.
 It's funny because even though you hadn't heard any teaching, I imagine just from your answer,
 you were fairly bulletproof in terms of boundaries. I don't know if you learned that as being a
 single woman who is ministering around the world that you'd learn to say no. But you seemed fairly
 robust in saying no, or is that just my impression of you? Yeah, because I was starstruck by you.
 Well, no, I was pretty good at saying no, but that's because I had to be right because there was there wasn't I mean on one level
 I remember thinking I'll be so nice is there somebody is saying no for me, right? You're welcome
 But you weren't you didn't exist at that point. Oh, I'm sorry. I learned to say no
 Oh, I see what you say other than to my to my family. It wasn't great saying no with them
 I first heard about boundaries from chip Judd obviously. Yeah, but so chip is one of my heroes
 I love that it just seems like a pattern in God's life that he's been so gracious to me and that my heroes
 I've become my friends
 Yeah, a lot of the friends I have today in
 Previous years were heroes of mine either books had read about them or I'd listened to them at conferences
 And I you know had no relationship with them. So that's awesome. Jesus. Thank you for doing that
 But so I you know I heard chip 2003 he came and spoke in our school and you know
 It was funny because I'm probably fairly well known for the boundaries message in
 that. But when I first heard his message, I love the man hated the message.
 I just thought this is the most irresponsible teaching I've ever heard.
 Is that why you hated it?
 Because you thought it was irresponsible.
 Yeah, I just thought I thought it was so offensive and so outrageous.
 And I think in part, because I'd probably been raised.
 When I say raised, I don't mean, I just mean the climate that I'd grown up in.
 no wasn't permissible. So I'm not necessarily talking about my family that I'd include my family,
 I'm just talking about the general culture, the operating system with which I grew up in,
 in my upbringing, you know, no wasn't readily available. So this concept that you could say no
 fell on Christ-like. Right. I think a lot of people still struggle with that now.
 Right, but the quality of their life suck because of it.
 He said gently and what you have to offer to other people that God's actually given you responsibility for is less because you haven't learned to say no to people that the Lord hasn't actually given you responsibility.
 Right.
 I realized a long time ago if if if I don't get good at saying no,
 then my activities or my social camera, let's just take that is built by other people's requests.
 So as long as people don't ask me to do anything, I have time to myself.
 But if I can't say no, then I have to say yes to every invitation that comes my way.
 And that's going to kill me and it's going to kill our family.
 So anyway, yeah, I heard Chip.
 I didn't like it at all.
 And I don't know if it's just because I like Chip that I stayed with it.
 Or I don't know if it was because of the culture in Toronto, you know, especially
 at the school was really, really equipped by boundaries.
 Yeah, I was surrounded by people.
 friendly. Yeah. I was surrounded by people who were healthy enough to say no without
 no being a source of conflict. I think probably for many people, people will only use no at
 breaking point. So no has got a bad rep. Does that make sense? So, you know, for me,
 certainly, like no would come out blustering and, you know, exasperated. And so watching
 people in Toronto use no really graciously and really, you know, without any hurt or
 anger behind it was quite interesting for me. I remember when we were leading one of
 the international leaders school of ministry and so we had leaders from all over the world
 and we were their small group leaders and I remember it was the end of the day and Kathy
 Harris, who's our dear friend in Toronto was leaving that day. And one of the pastors said to
 Kathy, are you going to be at the meeting tonight? Now, contacts for everybody who's listening. At
 that point, we did meetings every single night, except Monday night. Right. Every night of the week,
 there was a church meeting going on. And we had a big visit and speaker in. And so anyway,
 one of the pastors said to Kathy, are you going to be at the meeting tonight? And Kathy said, no,
 "No, no, I'm gonna be at home with my son."
 And even though Kathy wasn't saying no to this woman,
 this woman was so shocked that Kathy was not gonna show up
 for a church service that she just said,
 "Well, shame on you."
  </li><li>She seemed offended, didn't she?
  </li><li>Oh, she seemed, I mean, it was just absurd
 that you, you as a leader, would not be going to a church
 meeting that your church was putting on.
 And so Kathy, you know, Kathy said,
 "No, I'm gonna just go have some time on my teenage son."
 and the woman was like shame on you and Kathy's like oh no I'm so sorry I don't want your
 shame it's totally okay. You can keep your shame. And I was just like that's amazing you
 know Kathy wasn't saying no out of rebellion Kathy was saying no out of a desire to be
 with her family. And I don't know if that got me started thinking but just watching people
 around me manage their lives really really well and then not blame other people for the
 the choices they've made started me thinking like,
 I think too, even when we traveled, you know, for eight years or,
 or, you know, four years together, yeah, you see so many people in
 ministry that are miserable.
 And actually if they just had good boundaries, it would solve 80% of the
 issues, you know what I mean?
 Because, you know, they're, they're wanting time with their family or their
 kids, they're realizing what's, what things are costing them, but they're not feeling
 like they're allowed to say no.
 Right.
 And you just, so, I mean, I just remember lots of different places going there and just
 being like, yeah, but why don't you just say no?
 You know, you're the, you're the leader.
 You can say no.
 Yeah.
 I would say people pleasing is the number one epidemic that we face in the world.
 Or certainly in the church.
 Yeah.
 I mean, of course, in our world, I'm talking about.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 This whole notion that you've got people who are really trying to manage
 the emotions and responses of other people. And that's normal. You know, like, well,
 I can't do that because she'll be mad at me. Or, you know, I will have to do that.
 Or I'll really upset my mother. Or I, you know, have to do this. Or my husband's going
 to be angry with me. Or I have to. And you're like, okay, whenever you start saying have
 to or should, or you're actually placing the choice at the foot of somebody else's responsibility.
 You're reaction.
 Yeah, you've suddenly realized, oh, I'm no longer responsible for my own actions because
 I'm worried about their reactions.
 That's the type of slavery, it's the type of bondage.
 So how did you end up?
 So really, I don't realize it was from encountering me.
 Well, I would say, I mean, I was pretty good at saying on one level, I was okay even at
 boundaries sometimes with my family about being on time or whatever, like I would just leave
 if we hadn't had dinner already and you know that kind of stuff because everything was always
 laid and but anything emotional I couldn't lay down a boundary at all.
 So I would say it wasn't until you were like hey guess what you don't have to be their
 personal Jesus and you're not the only answer to this problem and it's actually not reasonable
 that you would go out at three o'clock in the morning when you have little tiny kids
 to go and do whatever and I'd be like right right okay okay.
 Right, I have another option.
 Right, yeah.
 I think the revelation that occurred to me was when I didn't have boundaries and people
 asked me to do something that I would, if I had boundaries, really choose to say no to
 for whatever reason, but felt like I couldn't.
 I realized on the inside I was wishing I was sick or injured, so I had a legitimate reason
 to say no.
 Yeah.
 Right? So could you do, could you help me with X on Friday? And you're like, man, Friday is my
 day off. I just, you know, I was really looking forward to doing, you know, this or that, the next
 thing. And well, I suppose I should say yes, because you know, there, and you just end up being like,
 Dang, if only I was like, had food poisoning, then I could say, Oh man, I've got food poisoning. And
 we say that because we think, well, then the other person won't be mad at me because who's going to
 be mad at somebody who has food poisoning. Right. And so you, you, you don't realize it, but you're
 or abdicating decision making to somebody else's reaction.
 I think where the boundaries teaching has been misunderstood
 is that boundaries enable you to be a selfish jerk.
  </li><li>Yeah, like you become a boundary Nazi or something.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>And I think that's probably a phase
 that you'd go through, like I certainly went through that.
  </li><li>Yeah, you did.
  </li><li>Thanks.
 (laughing)
 I certainly went through that
 because you suddenly have this revelation
 of discovering that you have power given to you,
 like, whoa, I get to say no.
 You know, the initial shock that there's another way
 of living life, then convincing yourself
 that it's actually okay to say no.
 And then this phase where you go through
 where you've got no skill at using no.
 There's no grace attached to it.
 It's just taking all your emotional energy
 to actually say no, and it probably comes across
 quite harshly.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I remember, you know, going through that again,
 because I didn't really feel like I ever had a no.
 It would just, you know, I'm so nervous.
 No!
 And you know.
  </li><li>It was a little intense to begin with.
  </li><li>It was.
 But that's, I think that's like any new skill.
 You know, when you're learning to drive stick shift
 in a car, you stall the car a couple of times
 or you over rev, you know, or you're changing gears
 or not that smooth, but the more you do it,
 the more skills you get it and then the better you get.
 And I think that's probably what happens.
 suddenly realize, okay, my freedom in saying no is not so that I can be a hermit and just
 have everything go my way.
 And I think Danny Silk in particular has done such an amazing job in balancing out the boundaries
 teaching along with Dan Farrelly, you know, and Dan was here.
 It's one thing to be powerful, but it's another thing to be powerful with humility and learning
 that okay just because we're in, just because I can say no doesn't mean I have to say no.
 I'm actually learning to give out if you're no.
 Yeah, and it's choice.
 I think what's exciting is especially for us I suppose here, but you know like in Toronto
 and other places where the boundary teaching is understood is you're creating a community
 of people that can effectively communicate without being wounded by saying no.
 And it also means then you mean your yes and you mean your no.
 And if somebody, if you ask somebody and say, "Hey, do you want to do this or could you
 do this?"
 If they say, "Yes, I'm going to take their yes at, you know, and trust it because I know
 that most of our community understands the boundaries teaching.
 And if they want to say no, I want them to feel like they can say no without it affecting
 how they think I view them or anything like that."
 And I would say that we've worked as hard as I know how to foster a community where
 people can say no to us.
 especially as leaders, I'm aware that that leaders can abuse their power, even when they're not aware of it, or even when they don't like to acknowledge that they're aware of it.
 So for example, when we moved house a couple of years ago, I actually only asked our school students at the time, and I did a little preamble going, guys, you don't need to say yes to me because I'm the director of the school.
 That's not why I'm asking you.
 Like if you are able to and you would like to, then we would love your help.
 And if you can't, you haven't offended me.
 I'm not going to be sitting thinking about you guys for Christians.
 But now I'm not here.
 And it does free up people because then you don't have to do the social massaging
 when people are around where you think they've said yes, but they meant no.
 You know, an internal, no nullifies an external yes.
 So they're here, but then you're trying to placate them and pacify them.
 Just make sure that they're OK.
 And that's just exhausting.
 So you're right. What a rich community you can have when everybody understands what everybody else is saying.
 Yeah. Yeah, it's awesome. That's really freeing.
 Yeah, I'm just, I'm very, very grateful for that teaching. It's really, I remember, do you remember
 that we were teaching in Toronto at school? And one of the students who'd been, as funny, she was a
 student she's in her own right was very connected with lots of
 ministries had been connected with some very big name ministries.
 And at the end of us teaching, she came up and she said, can I
 ask you guys pass through? And we're like, ah, she's like, no,
 but are you like real pastors?
 I'm like, yeah, she's like, like, so you, you know, pass through
 church, we're like, yeah, yeah, we do. She's like, but you're so
 happy. And I was so taken aback. Well, that statement, I thought,
 Oh gosh, there's a lot behind that. She said, what's your
 secret. And I said, mmm, probably the revelation of the father's love and being able to say no.
 And I, you know, that's absolutely the truth. Like we get to prioritize rest because we can say
 note to lots of things. Yeah. You know, learning to say no, so you can say yes to other stuff.
 Learning to say no to go and speak at this conference. So you can say yes to being at home with your
 kids. Yeah. And you're still inviting the Holy Spirit into the process. So even if you're like,
 My, my God is to say no, but if Holy Spirit goes, Hey, I'm saying yes, then you can go.
 All right.
 Yes.
 Which is awesome.
 If what we're saying is causing you to twitch that don't, that don't shut us down.
 It's going to be okay.
 If you are listening to something, man, I would love to learn more about this.
 We have prepared three teachings on our website.
 You can get them on CD or you can download them for this week only.
 We are making the digital downloads available, all of them, all three of them available for three bucks.
 They're not only three bucks a piece.
 This way they're going to be a dollar piece, download the whole set for three dollars and you could absolutely revolutionize your life and the lives of those people in your community.
 So three bucks to empower yourself to say no seems like an absolute bargain to me.
 But download them. Have a listen. If you have questions, go to lnaj.com/ask.
 we would love to try and answer your boundary related questions.
 Mrs. A.J. Jones with a hair of Jennifer Aniston is her anything you would like to say is close.
 You look very handsome today.
 You know what it is.
 What?
 You're tired.
 No, you know what it is.
 I don't know where my hair waxes.
 So I got lots of comments.
 It's a light and fluffy look.
 It is totally light and fluffy.
 I blow dried my hair because I couldn't go to the towel drying it.
 Then realize I had no product to put through it. So I'm all
 wistful and light and
 Well, until just that moment when you just like fixed your hair, you're looking a
 little bit like Erkel. It was parted right down the middle, but still cute.
 Okay.
 I'm going to go and cry in my room for a little bit.
 I love you.
 I love you. And we love you listeners.
 Thank you for tuning in. We will see you next week.
 Bye bye.
