<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Happy New Year.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 Can you believe it's 2022?<br/>
 No.<br/>
 In all reality, I think I blinked and erased 2021.
 Like, I feel like 2021 went like a blur.
 It went really fast.<br/>
 2020 was a super slow year.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 2021 was super fast.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I aren't most of like the weird space movies
 about how things are gonna be like hovering and stuff
 in like 2022.<br/>
 What weird space movies are you talking about?
 It seems like a weird space movie kind of year.
 You heard it here for our folks, weird space kind of year.
 Can we talk us through your outfit<br/>
 for people who can't see what you're wearing?
 Oh, well, we record in a basement.<br/>
 It's so cold.<br/>
 And as much as this looks like a finished space, it is not.
 No, no, no, no.<br/>
 This is just poor concrete walls, open studs.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I mean, we decorated ones behind us, but concrete walls.
 So there's no heat and Nashville.<br/>
 I think we have the most snow we have had since we moved here.
 It has stayed.<br/>
 We're now at day three and it's still here.
 You worked out the temperature for both all of our international audiences.
 So yesterday when you worked at the temperature, it was what?
 Nine degrees Fahrenheit?<br/>
 I can't remember what it was Fahrenheit, but Celsius.
 It was minus 11.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So we're always in Toronto, actually.<br/>
 Oh, yeah, we were twin.<br/>
 We were twinning.<br/>
 So yeah, it's quite cool.<br/>
 The kids have been out in the snow every day because they're just making the best of their, you know, like.
 You if I could you'll probably hear move your arms so everyone can hear.
 Yeah, you just were in a classic snow park.
 OK, that's great.<br/>
 That's great.<br/>
 So if you hear that weird noise, it's not the weird space aliens of 2022.
 It's just ages winter jacket.<br/>
 Yes, I'm wearing a sweater and a shirt underneath my sweater and then my winter
 jacket and I have my legs wrapped in a blanket.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I am so cold.<br/>
 I'm just in my regular shirt.<br/>
 I will say that this tabletop is<br/>
 brutal freezing because it's horrible.
 I can feel it through my jacket and my sweater.
 It's so cold.<br/>
 But apart from that, the ambient temperature for me is not horrible.
 Yeah, you're weird though. This Scottish thing. Yeah.
 A huge happy new year to all of you.<br/>
 I know this comes out on the 10th. What is today?
 It comes out the 10th. So your 10 days into your new year.
 We are praying that your new year will be absolutely awesome.
 We hope you had an amazing Christmas, too.
 Amazing Christmas break.<br/>
 When we left our podcast listeners, we were excited about the Jackson's coming.
 We were excited about blowing the minds of our children with the pigs,
 Which, listen to remember, I was so far.
 It was like my idea.<br/>
 You were super hesitant.<br/>
 You were such a liar.<br/>
 And we surprise our son with a hitherto unmentioned Christmas present.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Give us our weekly catch up.<br/>
 Gosh.<br/>
 So our catch up since then was the Jackson's didn't come because they all went down with COVID.
 Womp, wom, wom, wom.<br/>
 Which was so sad.<br/>
 Super sad.
</p><ul>
  <li>There's so many tears about that
 on both sides of the conversation.
 So we have planned for a late Christmas in February
 with them, but they didn't come.
 And so it was a super calm,
 like kind of almost boring Christmas vibe.
  </li><li>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I'm gonna stop you right there.
  </li><li>You don't think it was going?
  </li><li>Well, not like, I mean, like,
 we didn't go out and do big events or like that.
 We just basically played tons of games with the kids.
  </li><li>It was far from boring.
  </li><li>Yes. - So here's what happened
 at least inside my heart. - Okay.
  </li><li>My emotional roller coaster was,
 do you have a state that Jackson's could have gone?
  </li><li>Yes. - Like feeling all my feelings.
  </li><li>So sad. - Sadness lonely.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you know, I'd so looked forward to,
 we're gonna make it to Christmas,
 and then the Jackson's gonna be here,
 and he's gonna be awesome.
  </li><li>Yeah, we'd been counting down the days.
  </li><li>And you know, there was tears and there was sadness.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then I pivoted slightly to,
 you know how it doesn't matter how much you love
 the people that are coming to stay,
 You still have to put an effort when people come to stay.
 Yeah, all of a sudden we didn't have to do the same level of cleaning.
 They wouldn't have cared.
 We didn't have to make up the guest room, which MJ was sleeping in.
 Yeah.
 You know, yeah, our house data are like a level below what you want it to be when
 guests go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 And I stayed in pajamas.
 I think I got dressed maybe three days out of the whole two weeks.
 Yeah, I'd be surprised if it was three days.
 We were off hard.
 Yeah.
 So it wasn't boring for me.
 It was super peaceful.
 And so when you describe like,
  </li><li>Well, that's what I mean.
 Like it wasn't like we had big events or exciting.
  </li><li>As somebody who chooses his words carefully.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm so sorry.
  </li><li>It was boring, it wasn't boring, it was super rest.
  </li><li>It was restful, thank you, it was restful.
  </li><li>And when you describe it, I wouldn't go and do anything.
 Doing things on my time off is the opposite
 of having time off.
  </li><li>Well, I know, but I mean like normally
 we've done like a Christmas lights tour with the kids
 or we've done, you know, and we didn't do any
 of those things either 'cause we were waiting
 for the Jackson's to get here to do some of those things.
 And then we just never ended up doing them.
 But we did, shall we talk about throw throw avocado?
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>So some friends of mine or ours, the rat lifts,
 sorry, they're not just mine.
  </li><li>Hi, Frank and Julie.
  </li><li>Recommended throw throw burrito
 and throw throw avocado.
  </li><li>Which essentially is exactly the same game.
  </li><li>They're essentially the same game.
  </li><li>Essentially the same game.
  </li><li>The avocados though hurt less when you get hit by them.
  </li><li>Correct.
  </li><li>It needs to be said.
  </li><li>And it's, I don't know why this
 because we learned the throw through avocado first.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But it's simpler, it feels like.
  </li><li>Well, it's essentially, yeah, but it is the same game.
 But the reason I got both of them was thinking
 that Jacksons were coming, you need to be able
 to combine the two games to have like 10 people play.
  </li><li>If you've never heard this game?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How do you describe it?
  </li><li>In sanity.
  </li><li>It's insanity, it was a lot of fun.
  </li><li>It's so much fun.
 Like we were playing it pretty much every day.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 And essentially it's a card game where you all have a stack of cards and you're going through these cards at the same time.
 And you're trying to make sets.
 And but if you make sets that have to do with the avocados, it'll either be avocado dual in which case.
 Well, let's look into that level of detail.
 But if you get a card matching card with a kind of action activity with the avocado, a full on war breaks out, we're essentially you have to throw avocados at the other members.
 Yeah.
 Who are playing?
  </li><li>Yeah, we made a no head shots rule,
 but like you essentially you have to move really fast
 and try and get people out by throwing the avocados at them.
  </li><li>And I'm not ashamed to say that I screamed like a girl.
  </li><li>You do?
 I honestly, I was like, we need to actually
 pull the video off of our.
  </li><li>I actually have to pull the video off of it.
  </li><li>You have?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think maybe we should add it in for the members.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>It's a super fun game.
  </li><li>Super great for all ages.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 It gets hectic and it gets chaotic and it gets messy real quick.
 You're not throwing real avocados.
 These are like full of avocados.
  </li><li>No, they're like foam, they don't hurt.
  </li><li>And there's variations.
 It's either a full out every man for himself,
 it's either a duel, it's either,
 it's hard to keep track and that's kind of part of the fun.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I highly recommend it.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was very, very fun.
 So we played a lot of that.
  </li><li>Played a lot of card games.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But I think what the listeners want to know about is
 what happened with the guinea pigs.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>Okay, so first of all, we did keep the secret
 for two whole weeks.
 We had them in our closet for the whole two weeks
 and they didn't know that they were.
  </li><li>Well, we had it in our spare room for the first week
 and then we moved it from the other side of the house
 to our closet.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The spare room still smells like straw.
  </li><li>I liked having them in the closet.
 And Alan, who was like, basically, you know,
 he was the, I don't want guinea pigs person,
 has fallen in love with the guinea pigs.
  </li><li>Hold on.
  </li><li>Right now, is it true that you love the guinea pigs?
 Do you go over, do you talk to them,
 do you cuddle them, did you wanna cuddle them yesterday
 and take little tiny pictures of them?
  </li><li>I don't know what you're talking about.
 Alan does really like the guinea pigs.
 Alan was deeply suspicious that our kids
 would not be into them.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So if I'm gonna be wrong about something,
 let me be wrong about the right things.
 Our kids absolutely love the guinea pigs.
  </li><li>They were so excited.
 The funny part was on Christmas morning
 when we had them come down and we had a tablecloth over top
 of where we had the guinea pigs.
 And Tia was like, "Is it a pet?
 Is it a snake?"
  </li><li>Please tell me it's a snake.
  </li><li>She just wanted any kind of pet.
 And so the guinea pigs are a huge hit.
 Tia still is thanking me at least two or three times a day
 for getting a mini pig. - Where's my love?
  </li><li>I don't know.
 I guess they obviously correctly deduced.
  </li><li>I'm telling you, it's a gateway drug to a dog.
 I've not, I've said that before.
 They are adorable.
 They are very, very cute.
 I was super proud of my kids named them Lincoln's Elder,
 even though they're both girls.
  </li><li>Yep, that's right.
  </li><li>We tried to bath one yesterday, which was an adventure.
  </li><li>Yeah, they don't like that very much.
 They're not a big water animal.
 Yeah, so they didn't.
  </li><li>What I've learned about them is they love to borrow,
 and even after being in my house for six weeks,
 they're right outside my office.
 So every time I walk from my office to the living room
 or from anywhere that has passed there,
 every time they borrow and hide.
  </li><li>Yeah, they disagree.
  </li><li>I'm like, it's me.
 I'm the person who care for you, getting me.
 And they haven't learned that yet, but.
  </li><li>Yeah, it might take them a while.
 Well, I've watched so many guinea pig videos.
  </li><li>Her YouTube algorithm is serving up the
 funniest guinea pig videos.
  </li><li>Making sure I know how to do everything,
 making sure I'm watching for the right things,
 all that kind of stuff.
 And some of them are like, yeah,
 it can take them like six months to get used to who has them.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>So some of them are faster.
  </li><li>Yeah, they won't run away like every time they see you,
 but they are skittish animals anyway,
 because they're used to being prey.
  </li><li>Yeah, maybe I should start wearing like a full on wolf
 outfit around the house.
  </li><li>Yeah, or that eagle up, it's probably not helping them either.
 But anyway, yeah.
  </li><li>Huge hit, kids love it.
  </li><li>Huge hit, kids love them.
  </li><li>You know, we only got two of them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So, and we got three kids.
 And so we talked like, how are we gonna do this?
 And MJ very helpfully said he wasn't interested
 in getting a pet.
  </li><li>Yes.
 and the girls were very excited by getting a pet.
 And we're trying to teach the kids responsibility
 with the pets.
 And so he's like nine.
 So we were thinking, okay, the kids are gonna get a present
 that's gonna knock out of the park for them.
 We need to make sure that MJ gets a present
 that knocks out of the park.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Well, it kind of knocks out of the park,
 but it's kind of like equivalent for his heart.
 And the problem with buying your kids big presents,
 or at least a problem with buying your kids
 big presents in our house as it means they don't get--
  </li><li>As many things under the tree.
  </li><li>As many other presents under the tree.
 Do you want to talk about the fiasco that was our stockings this year or just move on?
 Okay, so I had a stocking fail.
 I got like the basic things, but I forgot about getting toys like little I usually get little
 things.
 You're a nine year old and you open up your stocking.
 And of course, there is a like a tray orange, which should be in chocolate coins, which
 should be in a magazine, which should be.
 But then the rest of the stocking was basically.
 Sarcin other.
 Normally I have like a stuffed animal and like a puzzle and something like that.
  </li><li>We did not get on the park in getting coloring books
 for the girls, but what did Tia notice?
  </li><li>Then I got her this same color book as last year.
  </li><li>So we were like, guys, before they even opened
 their stockings like guys, we just have to be honest,
 we kind of dropped the ball in the stockings.
 But trust us, the rest of Christmas is gonna be awesome.
  </li><li>Yeah, and they were like, that's okay.
 I mean, they were great about it, but--
  </li><li>And then for our little boy.
  </li><li>I've just thought that actually
 you should be the stocking guy.
 You can just talk to me. - I'm gonna be the stocking
 guy. - I'll be the stocking guy.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'll do the stocking guys.
 Yeah, I'll do the stocking guys.
 I'll buy, I'll be the stocking guy.
 Okay, just make sure you buy the right size underwear.
  </li><li>I might need to outsource that to you.
 Our son wants to be a YouTuber when he grows up,
 which by the way, I'm not entirely against,
 you know, as careers go.
 (laughs)
 And he loves playing video games.
  </li><li>And he's quite good at it.
  </li><li>And he's really good.
  </li><li>It's quite shocking.
  </li><li>Yeah, at them.
  </li><li>And this, I was about to tell the story backwards
 and make it sound like we made good parenting decisions.
 I think we made a bad parenting decision
 that was disguised as a good one.
 Like, I think you could spin it as a good parenting decision.
 Basically, my son has a walk-in closet.
 Is it about the size?
  </li><li>It's about nine foot by nine foot.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's not much smaller than the bedroom I had
 in Scotland.
 Like he has a full-on bedroom.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then he has this full-on,
 I don't mean literally a walk-in closet.
 It's huge with his own window, which he never uses.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>'Cause I was close fit and addressed
 with this in his bedroom.
  </li><li>And so we'd had all his toys and Lego
 and everything set up in there.
 And I thought, wouldn't it be cool to have his own game room?
 Yeah.
 And like, Flash screen TV is a fallen price so much.
 Yeah.
 So I thought, wouldn't it be cool if we just repurpose some of the furniture that we already
 have.
 Like, he had this old, racy sofa that had been in his bedroom that we were trying to throw
 out, but he wanted to keep for sentimental reasons.
 So we pushed that in there.
 Old speakers that you had.
 I had some old speakers.
 And the only problem is this is how...
 Well, he doesn't know that's old though.
 He knows nothing about that.
 So anyway, there's present on Sunday, on Christmas morning,
 AJ painted the room, she bought some Fortnite stickers,
 we moved that sofa in, we hung a flat screen TV on the wall.
 Thank you so much to my friend and now neighbor, Ryan,
 who helped me, when I say helped me, he did all the work,
 I did absolutely, there was no, he assisted me.
  </li><li>What do you mean he helped me?
  </li><li>He did it all, there was no power to that room.
 So he ran some power there.
 But he has this flat screen TV at one end,
 a sofa at the other end,
 And I think if I was a nine year old game where I would absolutely love that.
 Yeah.
 So purely it was a dad wanting to knock out the park for son.
 Right.
 But here's what we've noticed as parents prior to this MJ played.
 Video games in the bonus room, which is just an open plan room in our upstairs.
 And the sound spills into everywhere else in the house.
 Yeah.
 And so we're about to have a baby.
 We're not expecting a baby.
 We're trying to adopt a baby.
 Yes.
 More on that in a second.
 And we're thinking, when we have a newborn baby sleeping,
 That is going to be one noisy boy, but the noise level in the house has dropped considerably since he's inside a room within the room.
 Yes.
 Was closed doors.
 Yes.
 So that was apparent in when which was an accident.
 It was an accident, but so yeah, I mean, he's been having a great time and free.
 And it has been nice to not have him because he gets so excited to not have the sound of him yelling about his excitement about what because it doesn't matter what game he plays.
 He still gets loud and excited.
 I mean, it can be Minecraft.
 It can be anything and he's yelling.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Top tip for parents.
 My number one fear about putting a large screen TV
 in my son's room is him accessing content.
 I don't want him accessing.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Now, we've sat down and told our kids
 about pornography and why it's bad
 and why you don't want to look at it
 and how, hey, you will probably be exposed to it
 and your friends will try and show you some stuff,
 stay away from it.
 It's like, it's death.
 But the only item on his TV, the only thing that's plugged in this TV is a switch, which
 we can control.
 But to my dismay, when I went and bought a flat screen TV, of course, all TVs now come
 preloaded with YouTube, Netflix, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
 blah.
 So here's what I did is we use Eero as our Wi-Fi providers.
 You can lock down devices.
 So that TV cannot access the internet.
 So no matter how hard he tries to bypass the security measures on it or or stream something,
 it just will not.
 Yeah.
 And we also have a camera in that room.
 Camera in his room as well.
 So we can see what's going on.
 Yeah.
 And make sure that there's nothing nefarious going on.
 So that was Christmas, which feels like a long, long time ago.
 It was kind of a long time ago.
 At least a couple of weeks anyway.
 I suppose so.
 Yeah.
 I suppose so.
 I'm dense update.
 Oh, well, you seem to feel like you've really gotten the moves.
 down. I don't know if I've really got the moves down. So remember I told you about,
 I've been doing this Apple Fitness Plus. I'm trying something out every, some different
 every day. Yeah. So I committed to doing that specific dance video every week until I got
 it down. I don't have it down, but I can, I'm lot less lost. Just progress.
 Yes. Yeah. You were showing us your moves this morning. Here's the second thing I learned
 as don't do dance moves without the music.
 Because I didn't just look weird.
 OK, yeah.
 So but good job.
 Good job, Danny.
 So there you go.
 That's our Christmas update.
 Hope you had an amazing Christmas, a safe Christmas, a fun Christmas and a glorious
 New Year.
 Our main topic for this week comes from quite possibly one of the best emails
 I think I've ever received.
 Oh, there's a listeners question.
 This whole episode is devoted to a listeners question.
 OK.
 And I've got it right here.
 All right.
 This is from Liz.
 Hi Liz.
 I'm going to read the whole email and then we'll tackle it a bit by bit.
 Okay.
 First off, this is Liz speaking.
 Thank you so much for your podcast and all the work you do.
 I'm not currently a Christian, but listening to your podcast is inspiring me
 and moving my heart toward that direction.
 I can't tell you how huge that is for me.
 I've had to overcome so many judgments to even be at this point.
 And your podcast has been a big part of those shifts.
 You begin to see why this is one of my favorite emails ever because here we are down in our basement
 just talking about our Christmas.
 Just doing stuff.
 Yeah.
 And I'm glad it's impacted people.
 My question, plural, or about how to move further into understanding about Christianity and potentially becoming a Christian.
 I love everything you guys talk about and I have so many questions.
 It is also new to me and I'm untangling 30 plus years of negative misconceptions about the church.
 I've been attending some Sunday services at Grey Centre online, which I enjoy, but it
 seems like the next steps for me would be to find a local church and to get some more
 resources to read and study.
 I would love any advice you have about this.
 I'm especially nervous about finding a church, as my experience with Christianity in the
 past is that it wasn't an alive practice in the presence of God, and that there was a
 lot of hypocrisy in how it is practiced.
 I would love to find a church that welcomes the Holy Spirit with the healthy culture that
 that you speak about, and I just don't know where to start.
 It seems like there's a church on every block,
 and I can't tell them apart.
 In terms of resources, the Bible also feels intimidating to me.
 Can one just pick it up and start reading?
 Or will I feel really confused and need some more tutoring?
 Are there other books you would recommend
 to someone who's at the very beginning of this journey?
 My heart is so hungry to know God.
 I've been down many paths on that pursuit,
 but so far none of them have borne grapefruit.
 In any case, I realize this question may be of no use to most of your listeners and perhaps
 isn't right to air, but I thought I would reach out.
 Feel free to edit as needed.
 Thanks again for everything Liz.
 No editing necessary, Liz, because...
 Such a great email.
 I love your email so much.
 And I know that everybody who's listening, if they're a Christian, they are so excited
 about your email.
 They are so excited about your question and are probably going to have some answers of
 their own.
 Sure.
 People like you who are listening, who are not Christians,
 they're gonna be interested answers.
 This is a great email, super encouraging.
  </li><li>Yeah, or even though there's gonna be people who are like,
 "Oh, actually, I have a friend
 "that would probably love to know the answer
 "to those questions."
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>That's wonderful.
 Are you gonna take us back to the beginning then?
  </li><li>I'm not trying to just back.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>First of all, thank you so much for listening to our podcast.
 I love that you enjoy everything we talk about.
  </li><li>Me too.
  </li><li>Yeah, used to be very taco heavy.
 We haven't done like any taco reviews recently,
 but nevertheless--
  </li><li>Very sad.
 in video games in this season. First of all, I think I would like to apologize and repent really
 on behalf of we're both pastors. Yes. Repent on behalf of pastors because you say I've had to
 overcome so many judgments to even be a part of this point because you're untangling 30 plus years
 of negative misconceptions about the church. So as Christians, as leaders of a church, I am so
 sorry that you have had a negative experience with the body of Christ. Yes. I think you know that
 that shouldn't be. And yeah, I'm really sorry it was.
 And unfortunately, that is like many people's story.
 Absolutely.
 So, you know, it's not an uncommon story, which makes us super, super sad.
 But yes, I mean, we would love to just apologize on behalf of other church leaders that have caused
 you hurt or harm or confusion.
 Yeah, absolutely. So your question is, how do we move further into understanding about Christianity
 and potentially becoming a Christian. The fact that you're even aware of your need is so beautiful.
 I don't know where you are geographically in the world, so maybe some of her answers will change,
 especially according to resources. Well, I mean, Liz, I don't know if you'd feel comfortable reaching
 out to us again and letting us know where you live, like what town you live in. We could see if we can
 help in some way. But the reason I bring that up is something that's huge in the UK, that's not so
 huge in America, although I'm sure it exists, but I'm not aware of it. It's the Alpha course.
 Yes.
 And they probably have an Alpha course online. I should have checked beforehand. If they do,
 I'll put a link in the show notes to it. But the Alpha course is designed specifically for
 where you're at, where people are curious. They might have questions. They want to find
 an environment where they can ask questions, where they're not going to be shut down, where
 no question is stupid, where you get to explore in a small group with other people. And I know
 it's huge in the UK. I am sad to say that I don't think it's huge, at least in our part of the world.
 No, I don't think it is huge in America because most people that I say,
 alphacore say what? Right. So yeah.
 So that would be a great place to start. I'll put Lincoln to show you. I am
 absolutely positive with lockdown that they have online resources or online groups that you can
 join. But that would be a great place to start. So you say you've got some questions and you're
 saying, "Hey, I've been enjoying watching Grace are online. So glad that you joined us online."
 Yeah, that's wonderful.
 That's wonderful. I'd encourage you to keep doing that. And you said, "It seems like the next steps
 for me would be to find a local church." I would say a hearty yes, but you bring up to really common
 problems. How do I know which one is good? Yes, so tricky. Where would you say you would start?
 You've just moved to a new town. Let's make it slightly different for you. You've moved to a new town.
 Yeah. You want to find a good church? How do you find a good church?
 Well, I would probably talk to whatever Christians I meet around and find out what they have to say
 about their churches, why they go to them, what drew them there, that kind of thing.
 Word of mouth is big. And even though you're really new in the process, you can still say,
 "Lord, would you help me find the place where I'm supposed to be?" And then again,
 and see who you end up or what churches you end up hearing about or discovering.
 And some of it might be just trying on different churches.
 I don't mean trying on, I don't really love that.
 Yeah, church shopping.
 Go out a couple.
 See what they feel like.
 See how they feel.
 Liz, the thing that excited me the most about your email is the Holy Spirit is already
 working on you.
 Yes, absolutely.
 The Holy Spirit is already putting, you know, you talked about like, I'm really, you know,
 passionate, hungry to know God.
 Like that hunger comes from God.
 So there's a beautiful verse in the Bible where Jesus said, I will not leave you as orphans,
 but I will come to you.
 So the Holy Spirit is beginning to brew in your heart and he's so good at leading us.
 And you might be like, well, I don't know how you hear the Holy Spirit's voice.
 He's got you this far.
 He can get you the next step.
 So as Edgy says, praying is a really good thing.
 And I like to prayer aloud.
 So if it feels weird to you,
 just push past the weirdness, just say,
 God, I am trying,
 I really want to know you Jesus,
 if you're real, would you lead me where I need to be?
  </li><li>Yeah, and this.
  </li><li>And I believe the Holy Spirit will help you.
  </li><li>Yeah, praying is just talking to God normally.
 You don't have to know the special words or the,
 you know, and yeah, any of that,
 it's literally just saying, okay God, you know,
 If you're real, would you help me?
 Would you, you know, it's just talking to him
 like you talked to the person across from you.
  </li><li>And I would encourage you to stay where you're at.
 And what I mean by that is don't try
 and make your purse super spiritual.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>If you're full of doubt, tell him you're full of doubt.
 He knows already anyway, but.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>The most important thing in our walk with God
 is to be authentic.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And that's what I hear in your email.
 So I would start, like Gage said, ask some Christians,
 get done where you are in the world.
 I don't know if you're in lockdown,
 but maybe go online, look at social media,
 find people that you know are Christians,
 maybe kind of browse some websites,
 maybe watch some online streams to just kind of get a feel
 for it.
 The key encouragement that we look for are people
 who believe the Bible.
 I know that sounds weird, but there are churches out there
 who don't, but maybe say that they do.
 So I'm dressed in the Holy Spirit in this,
 'cause suddenly my instructions sound super sketchy,
 but find some Christians, ask them, go online,
 and then maybe go to some churches
 and just kind of try them on for size.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And trust the Holy Spirit in the process.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Ask them, but yes, getting in a church
 would be a really, really good step.
  </li><li>And community is how we grow best.
 So getting into a church and being part of a fellowship
 actually is how you best ensure growth.
 So yeah, I love it that you're already thinking that way
 because I think that's God leading you just even in that.
  </li><li>And also Liz, again, I keep saying I don't know where you are,
 but I also don't know what your community looks like.
 Do you have Christians around you asking them,
 like they might have a small group that you could join
 or like the Alpha Group that I was talking about.
 Okay, that's the church thing.
 You're also saying, I really can't tell the difference
 between the churches and you want one
 with a healthy culture.
 That's why word of mouth is kind of good,
 because you can't fake fruit.
 Like fruit doesn't lie.
 So of course, you're gonna have disenfranchised people
 who maybe come from a good church and had a bad experience.
 But on the whole, look at the fruit of the lives
 of the people that go to the church.
 Or, you know, like what's its reputation?
 What's its fruit?
 I'm trying to think about that
 because some of Grace and her reputation.
 Listen, I know that you can trust the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit will lead you where you need to be.
 Yeah.
 And I love that you're even processing them.
 In terms of being able to tell them apart, I don't think that's the most important thing to worry about.
 A denomination.
 No, I don't either.
 I think you just want to find a great fellowship of healthy believers.
 And I don't think it particularly matters.
 Most denominations would say that they're marked by how they interpret certain parts of theology.
 Yes. But the truth is most denominations
  </li><li>And usually pertaining to the Holy Spirit
 and the role of the Holy Spirit are often.
  </li><li>Well, not necessarily.
  </li><li>Well, okay.
  </li><li>But most denominations would pry themselves
 in thinking that the reason we're different
 is because we interpret scripture differently.
 And I would argue that most denominations
 are different about the way they do things.
 It's really cultural fit.
 But like all the churches that I've been in,
 I've been in a very conservative evangelical upbringing
 called the Brethren, then I went to a Baptist church,
 then I went to a slightly more open brethren church
 and dipped my toes in some charismatic churches,
 then went to Toronto, which was arguably
 the most controversial church in the world at the time.
 And now at Grey Center, all of them would differ
 in theological perspectives.
 They would all differ some way in the way they did things,
 but the core that runs through them all
 is a belief that the word of God is in area.
  </li><li>I know, yeah. - It is real.
 The practice that Jesus asks us to,
 like things like baptism and taking communion,
 and good Bible teaching, and beautiful people,
 people who will love really, really well.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you will have experienced growth
 in every single church you were in.
  </li><li>Absolutely, yeah.
  </li><li>Which mind, you know, my story is shorter than that.
 I only went to two different churches,
 but very different churches.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But still growth, you know, wonderful people,
 you know, a love for the word of God, that sort of thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 The word of God is alive, the spirit of God is alive.
 So if the church you're going to isn't alive,
 you know, the church you're visiting rather,
 you might not be the church you want to settle in.
 All right, God, I can't wait to hear the questions we get
 from that, that kind of interesting description.
 Also Liz, we're praying for you
 that you found an amazing church
 and we'd love to hear what happens.
 I would love to find a church that welcomes the Holy Spirit
 with the healthy culture that you speak about.
 Pretty much every church on the planet
 will say that they welcome the Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>You think so?
  </li><li>Oh yes, every church would like,
 yes, we're spirit led, like every church would say that.
 It depends what that statement means to you.
 I'm assuming that because you've been listening
 to our podcast, you've been watching Grace Center,
 you know what it means to us.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Again, yeah, look for that.
 And you know, maybe ask some Christians
 about like, I'm really looking for Holy Spirit
 friendly churches that they'll probably not really mean.
  </li><li>I think it's funny that you think every church would say,
 you know, that they're open to the Holy Spirit
 because again, the first church I went to for four years,
 I didn't even know the Holy Spirit existed.
  </li><li>And yet they would still say that yes,
 we believe in the Holy Spirit
 and we would want all our spirit.
  </li><li>I guess they would have, I never heard it though.
  </li><li>My mom and dad, our church, a cessationist church.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>My mom would say, I love our breaking of bread service.
 Everyone is so spirit-led.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Okay.
  </li><li>Like, sure.
 I've read enough doctrinal statements to be like,
 I hear you saying those words.
 I think those words mean something different to you than to do for me.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 In terms of resources, the Bible also feels intimidating to me.
 Can one just pick it up and start reading,
 or will I feel really confused and need some more tutoring?
 Let's just leave that there.
 I'm about to introduce you to a website that is going to so help you.
 Yes.
 Called the Bible project.
 I knew exactly where you're going.
 I'll put it into the show notes.
 Listen, there are Christians who've been in churches
 for 30 years who've got the same questions you,
 but they're hiding it.
 Like at least you're vulnerable and going,
 the Bible seems a bit confusing and overwhelming.
 There's people in the church for 30 years
 who don't read the Bible
 'cause that feels big and confusing.
 The beautiful thing about the Bible is it's alive.
 So while yes, you can just pick it up and start reading,
 absolutely, and the Holy Spirit's well able
 to speak to you about it.
 I would encourage you to start in some particular places.
 Yes, so would I.
 What's important to know about the Bible is it's a collection of books, really,
 66 books in the Bible written by numerous different authors, inspired by the Holy Spirit,
 over about 1400 years.
 It's got lots and lots of different literary styles that if you don't know that when you start reading,
 you're like, "Why is this thing really easy to understand?
 Why is this other thing really difficult to understand?"
 to help you to make your Bible reading journey easier to start.
 I'm gonna give you some prep.
 Listen, you could open anywhere and it's gonna be helpful.
 But I'm gonna encourage you.
 The first thing you need to understand is
 the Bible comes in different flavors, translations.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You wanna pick a nice, modern, easy-to-read version.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So not these and those and things like that.
  </li><li>Yeah, off the top of my head,
 some of those would be like the message is a version.
  </li><li>That's easy.
  </li><li>That's easy to read.
 The new living translation is a, they call it the NLT.
 They're all into their hip abbreviations
 are easier to understand.
 Where I would start reading is I would start reading
 in the Gospels, Alan, what are the Gospels?
 It's the first four books of the New Testament.
  </li><li>Yes, that's what I get to do.
  </li><li>So when you get your Bible, there's an Old Testament,
 there's a New Testament.
 The Old Testament is all pointing to Jesus.
  </li><li>But it's harder to figure that out.
  </li><li>It's harder to see that.
 The New Testament, especially if you start reading the Gospels,
 that's Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John,
 It starts talking about Jesus immediately.
 I would encourage you to start with the book of John.
 The first chapter is gonna be the first part
 of the first chapter is gonna be a little bit weird
 'cause there's lots of word in this, that, the next thing.
 But just stick with it.
 Get a modern translation, read the gospel of John.
 If you wanna dip into the Old Testament,
 start reading the book of Proverbs.
 The book of Proverbs is basically like
 what you would read on Twitter today.
 They're sure, punchy, super helpful things for life.
  </li><li>Yes. - Where would you start?
  </li><li>I would have said the gospel as well,
 but I probably wouldn't have said John immediately.
  </li><li>What was your story?
  </li><li>I would say like just read through the Matthew Mark.
 Like, you know, they're parallel gospels.
 They don't all have the same stories.
 Some of them are telling the same stories.
 And all of those books tell you why they've written,
 the way they've written and who they're trying to reach.
 But so I would say read the gospels
 and then I would also say Romans.
 I think Romans, well, here's the thing.
  </li><li>Romans is a huge book, but it's very clear.
 It's not--
  </li><li>I'm gonna stop you right there.
  </li><li>Okay, you don't think it's clear?
  </li><li>Well, I do love Romans, so maybe I have an issue.
 It's possible.
  </li><li>Again, you can't go wrong, but anything to read.
 And so Romans is certainly good.
 And I'm trusting the whole of this British gonna speak
 through you, but there are heavyweight theologians
 that wrestle with Romans.
 If you want, I would start with Luke as a gospel
 and then Acts, because originally there were just one book.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right, the same author wrote both of them.
 So maybe read the gospel of Luke
 and read the gospel of Acts because Acts is incredible.
 Blow your mind all the stuff that happens in there.
  </li><li>Yeah, and actually, 'cause you're talking about Luke
 and Acts, if you are a apps kind of person,
 if you download the U version app on your phone,
 it's like the symbol for it is like a brown Bible.
  </li><li>A book in the show notes.
  </li><li>Yeah, they actually have a study by the Bible project guys
 that is just Luke and Acts.
 So they walk you through Luke and Acts as you're reading it.
 And there's like little videos to help you understand,
 you know, sort of what's actually going on
 in the historical context and all that kind of stuff.
 And it's a great study.
  </li><li>That's a great point, babe.
 The Bible app that I'm gonna put a link to in the show notes.
 If you're like, I don't know where it's just diving
 and start reading the Bible off, it makes no sense.
 There are daily reading plans in the app.
 I'll look through some and maybe highlight some,
 some suggested ones that will,
 you read a little bit about the Bible
 and then someone's written kind of like a little bit
 to go with it, maybe to explain what you're reading,
 maybe to ask some questions.
 That might feel like helpful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, kind of like me doing these dance videos.
 If I try to come up with dance on my own,
 it would be a nightmare.
 But I've got this person who's coaching me through that.
 That is the worst analogy ever.
  </li><li>That's a horrible idea.
 But I was gonna say like I just started a new app.
 a new like year yearly one.
 Yeah.
 That the Bible project guys released,
 which is a new one that's basically telling you
 as you're going through the Old Testament,
 every place that points towards Jesus.
 Yeah.
 Which is one of their newer ones,
 but there's quite a few really good ones.
 So yeah, if we post them, you could have a look at.
 Yeah, look.
 But I don't know that you want to start
 with a Bible in a year kind of Genesis.
 I was just about to say that.
 Not right now, like, you know, stay with,
 stay with the New Testament and.
 And one of the things I'd encourage you to do is anytime you see something you don't
 understand, just get a little notebook and write down what you don't understand.
 Don't ignore the stuff you don't understand.
 The stuff you don't understand leads you into more wisdom, leads you into more revelation.
 And because the Bible is alive, and what I mean by that is it's not a dead book.
 When you read the Bible, the Bible reads you.
 What I mean by that is as you read it, the Holy Spirit will speak to you through the
 book and we'll begin to bring up questions and talk to you and challenge you and maybe
 confront you, maybe excite you, maybe lead you in places. I'm so excited for your journey
 list. It's going to be beautiful. Okay. Will I feel really confused? Need some more tutoring?
 Listen, there's still parts of the Bible I get really confused about. I still need to
 be sure. I'm friends with a world famous theologian and the other day I've spoken to
 and he said, there's this part of theology that he doesn't know anything about.
 And I was so encouraged.
 This is a man who's probably in his 80s is a world renowned.
 And he's just like, I don't know what to think about this.
 Right. So, you know, you're not alone.
 Well, that same theologian often says, be comfortable with mystery.
 Yeah.
 You know, that there's things that we're not going to understand.
 And I think if you get hung up on what you don't understand to the point where
 or causes you distress, that's not helpful.
 You know, so yeah, having a notebook,
 writing down what you don't understand,
 but realize there are probably gonna be a few things
 that we just don't understand.
 There's things I don't understand, and that's okay.
 And I figure if I need to understand it,
 the Lord will make sure that I do.
  </li><li>Absolutely. - Yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, then you said, are there other books
 you would recommend to someone
 who's at the very beginning of this journey?
 There is, there is a fantastic book
 that I think this is right,
 The Bible is the best-selling book.
 The second best-selling book is Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Life.
  </li><li>Wow, you didn't know it.
  </li><li>I don't know if that's absolutely true.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But it's in my head for a reason.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I'd admit I could have made that up,
 but I'm pretty sure that's right.
 So the Purpose Driven Life is written by a pastor
 from California called Rick Warren,
 and it is a very, very helpful book.
 And I'll put a link to it,
 especially for people who are starting
 journey of faith. I'll put a link to it. You can pick it up. I'd really encourage you to read
 that. Absolutely. Do you have any books that you would suggest? I was thinking good morning Holy
 Spirit. Benny Hinn? Yeah, Benny Hinn's good morning Holy Spirit because I remember reading it and
 it feeling like so many lights went on for me. Where were you in your journey? Well, I was probably,
 I was saved again in a church where probably there wasn't much acknowledgement of the Holy Spirit
 being present and I didn't realize how much he was actually already moving in my life
 and talking to me and everything until I read that book.
 Wow.
 And then I was like, oh, this makes so many things make sense for me.
 So for me, I loved that book.
 I read it over and over again.
 Liz, I'm so excited you took the time to email us.
 And I'm so excited.
 I want to encourage you.
 The Holy Spirit is leading you.
 And if you'll just keep following, if you'll just keep being honest with your questions,
 If you'll just keep being honest about where you are,
 you will find that the Holy Spirit will lead you to the books,
 the people and the places that you need to learn about Jesus
 and hopefully get to know Jesus.
  </li><li>Yeah, absolutely.
 We're so excited for you, Liz.
  </li><li>Can we pray for you, Liz?
 You're not here, but we're gonna pray for you.
 And if you don't want this prayer,
 you can skip to the next chapter of our.
 But I think it'd be lovely.
 I'm gonna pray for everybody who's listened to this,
 who wants to know God more.
 I'm including you, Liz,
 but I'm also not trying to single you out.
 just in case that makes you feel awkward.
  </li><li>Yeah, all right.
  </li><li>Father, I thank you for the truth
 that the Holy Spirit is alive and well and a work today,
 working in our hearts to help us understand Jesus more.
 And I'm praying for Liz,
 I'm praying for everybody who's listening,
 Lord, all of us, no matter how long we've known Jesus,
 or if we're just in the early stages
 of getting to know Jesus, Lord,
 would you work in our heart, in our lives,
 in our circumstances to coordinate events and people
 and books and churches to cross our paths
 so that we can know you more.
 I thank you, Lord, that you said that you wouldn't leave us
 as orphans, but you'll come to us.
 And so we're not alone in this world.
 We're not alone in this journey.
 And I'm asking for Liz, I'm asking for everybody
 who's listening this year, 2022,
 would be a year of upgrades in our understanding
 of who Jesus is, what he's done for us,
 and why he's come to save us.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Amen. - Amen.
  </li><li>All right, Liz, fantastic questions.
 Thank you so much. - Thank you, Liz.
  </li><li>Thank you so much for giving us a whole episode
 to talk about.
 If you've got questions, anybody who's listening to this,
 you've got questions that you would like us to answer,
 go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/ask,
 you can just fill that out there,
 or reach out to us on social media @allen@ag,
 a-l-y-n-n-a-j, and you can reach out to us there.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>AJ, give us a quick adoption update.
  </li><li>So we're in the process still of raising
 all the finances for it, but we're past the halfway mark.
  </li><li>We are past the halfway mark.
 Thank you to everyone who's given.
  </li><li>Thank you so much.
 huge. Oh my gosh, your generosity is astonishing. And it also means that if a situation comes
 up, we can now respond to it. Or before it would not have been able to. Because you have
 to have a certain amount of finances upfront. You have to have half the money upfront.
 Yes. And we comfortably have that. Yes. So that's super exciting. We haven't seen a
 situation yet that we can apply for. So again, just so we're connected with like five or
 six different adoption agencies. We're on file with them and if they have a mom come in and
 the baby that she's going to have matches the criteria that we've been looking at,
 they either contact us or post it online and we put forward, "Hey, we'd like to be considered."
 Yeah. And we haven't had any of those.
 We have to match the mom's criteria as well. So sometimes the mom is like, "Hey,
 like one of the ones we saw recently was they need to live on the west coast so it would be easy
 for visits, therefore we don't, you know, doesn't work for us.
 Or we want the there to be no other biological children present in that home.
 So that, you know, we couldn't apply for that one.
 So there's there's things where, you know, obviously it's going to need to match
 what the mom is hoping for for this baby.
 And then in addition, like, here's why I'm strangely at peace with it is similar
 to what Liz, I was just saying to you about, you know, the Holy Spirit is leading
 you to know Jesus. The Holy Spirit is leading us to adopt.
 Yes.
 So he's not, he's, you know, he's literally leading us. We've done everything that we
 can to get ourselves ready.
 Yes.
 And so it's in his timing.
 Yep.
 And I feel peaceful, but I realized I moved from, from not being open or passive, but
 like willing, but now I'm like a couple of weeks ago, David Wagner, who was speaking
 of our church and he said, you know, said something about barrenness. Like God wants
 to end barrenness. And I was like, yes, Lord.
 but I want my next child.
 And so I'm like now moving to like, yeah, I'm open
 and God's time to like, I, what are you?
  </li><li>I'm excited about it.
  </li><li>I did say I had another dream.
  </li><li>No, when?
  </li><li>Maybe last week.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>A little bit, add a little baby.
  </li><li>So on one level, like we haven't, you know,
 been matched with anyone,
 but we're just waiting in expectation
 and continuing to raise the finances.
  </li><li>You wanna learn about our story?
 If you wanna hear about our story,
 if you wanna find out the most up-to-date place
 to find out what's going on with our adoption journey is alanandag.com/adopt.
 And if you'd like to give to our adoption fund,
