<p> I live in a days but got bored Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones.
 Welcome to episode one eighty two of keeping up with the Joneses were this week.
 We're talking about baptism.
</p><ol>
  <li>G. Jones have you started smoking?
 I haven't know, but I did speak to services this morning and did a lot of yelling while people got baptized.
 Oh, so that's why your voice is all.
 I think it was I think it was the yelling that did it.
 Mm hmm. If you're new to our podcast, my name is out.
 My name is AJ and normally I sound like a female.
 You sound like a female bit.
 OK, thanks.
 I think my voice is deeper than yours right now.
 I can't like it.
 I'm not going to lie.
 I can't believe that this week is over.
 When I think back to Monday, it feels like a different week.
 It feels like two weeks ago.
 This week we had a friend's band and Sarah and from Toronto, Sarah was teaching
 at the school on dream interpretation and advanced dream interpretation.
 Yeah.
 I think that's the problem.
 When we're not teaching, well, we were teaching because we were teaching in the afternoon.
 We still taught.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I was going to say we're so used to teaching that those are kind of the tentpole days of our week.
 And when we're not, they feel like they're missing.
 So we're like, wait, what happened to this week?
 Well, I think it was also a full week because with Ben and Sarah and the kids here and we just had, we stayed up late.
 We had a lot of fun.
 I still can't believe they only left a few days ago.
 Right.
 That's shocking.
 They left Wednesday.
 So Monday to do is it took care of itself Wednesday. We were in meetings all day.
 Wednesday is my favorite day of the week.
 Is it?
 Yeah.
 You know, we alternate. We either have meetings with Jeff, just the Joneses and Jeff.
 We have meetings with our pastors.
 Yeah.
 Or we have our all staff meetings.
 Yeah.
 And then in afternoon, we always have our senior team meetings.
 So it's my favorite day of the week.
 I get to be with all the people I love.
 And it feels super productive, which is like a combination of two of my favorite things.
 There you go.
 Yeah. Wednesday, like you said, we said goodbye to Ben Sarah's.
 as they left very early in the morning.
 God bless them.
  <ul>
    <li>Yes, yes, with their two littles
 'cause they were flying out two days later at the UK.
    </li><li>Oh my gosh.
    </li><li>I know.
    </li><li>I saw pictures of them on Instagram
 with their kids on a flight and I was like,
    </li><li>Oh, for that.
    </li><li>Yeah, I love that.
 No, no, I'm glad I'm staying here.
 And then Friday was interesting.
    </li><li>It was.
    </li><li>Do you remember what you did Friday?
    </li><li>What did I do?
 I went out with Lauren.
    </li><li>Okay, see, while you were swanning off and--
    </li><li>I swanned.
    </li><li>Painting the town red.
    </li><li>Yes.
    </li><li>I was hard at work on our studio.
    </li><li>With a podcast studio, that's not the studio
 that we're talking about.
 The podcast studio is where we are right now.
    </li><li>Yes. - Behold.
    </li><li>Isn't it beautiful?
    </li><li>Well, you're just gonna have to trust me on this one.
    </li><li>It's very beige.
    </li><li>It is very beige.
    </li><li>It's beige and brown.
    </li><li>Yeah.
    </li><li>Imagine a beige room with brown sound paneling.
    </li><li>And more beige.
    </li><li>And a beige car.
    </li><li>Yeah.
    </li><li>Yeah, it's a beige around.
    </li><li>Beige curtains.
 We probably need to unbeige this room at some point.
    </li><li>I like it.
 It's super soothing.
    </li><li>Okay.
    </li><li>I come in here and we have all these sound,
 dampening panels on the wall. So this room is not acoustically dead, of course, but it is very,
 very muted. So when I come in here, it feels like the world just slows down and ushes. It's a
 really nice environment to work in. Which is why when we are able to build the studio downstairs,
 we can make this into our God room and it will be nice and peaceful. But we'll be taking the
 panels downstairs with us so it will return to as noisy as any other room. Well, we'll just fill it
 full of soft cushy things.
 -Okay, I love your vision.
 So I'm not talking about the studio that we're currently in,
 we're actually working on another studio downstairs in our basement
 to help us produce video content.
 It's funny, we've been working on it for months now,
 and this is what I found.
 -Okay, I'm ready.
 -Video is way harder than audio.
 -Oh good.
 -Oh, this is what we needed.
 -Yeah.
 -Audio is a little tricky.
 Like when we started podcasting, we didn't have a clue what we're doing.
 Yeah. And we got guided in the right direction. And audio is that type of thing that was just
 a little bit of effort. You can get it to sound surprisingly good. Okay. But video,
 completely different animal. Oh, there are so many variables to consider. And because we're not
 experts by any means, the learning curve is enormous. I have great faith in you, babe. You've
 managed to do every other learning curve I've ever seen you do. Oh, it's not me that's doing it. I'm
 I'm just finding people who are brilliant at it and applying them with tacos.
 Yes.
 And feed them tacos and suck the knowledge from their brain.
 That's right.
 Yeah.
 So we hit a major milestone on Friday.
 I don't even know if you've seen it.
 You weren't home.
 I haven't seen it.
 It's so cold.
 I don't want to go in the basement until we're heating that thing.
 I don't want to go downstairs.
 I posted a picture earlier of how it looks right now.
 Yeah.
 And it's me and Cooper sat at a table and I had to say, no, no,
 A.G.
 Hasn't grown a beard.
 Epic beard.
 Because it's so cold.
 But for our Patreon supporters, you've been able to watch the progression of the studio
 over the last few months.
 We actually just posted some stuff this weekend, some video we shot last week.
 And then like I said, I just a little clip from this Friday to kind of give you an idea
 of what it's looking like.
 We're excited to get up and running.
 Manateeks are an awful lot of time.
 So while you were out swanning around, like I said, drinking Franklin juice dry.
 Oh, OK.
 I was hard at work.
 Oh, yeah.
 With a hammer and nail.
 No hammers and nails from fall, but Cooper did get an electric shock.
 What?
 I forgot to tell you.
 He did.
 Yeah.
 He touched some bare wires that I had exposed.
 Let's not kill our guests.
 Okay.
 I thought I thought it was the Holy Spirit.
 He was just like, man, but he got.
 Yeah, he got shocked.
 Anyway, yeah, it's important.
 We don't shock our people.
 Yes.
 And then Saturday, I'd like to say we did something more than all staying pajamas and all take turns playing
 Zelda but we didn't.
 I did.
 I did nine loads of laundry.
 Right, but did you also manage to play like three hours of Zelda?
 No, it was like two hours and 50 minutes.
 Hang on, I posted it to Instagram.
 What?
 Well, you can't post this stuff to Instagram.
 No, I thought you looked great.
 Let me just, let me see.
 Yeah, I did three hours and 45 minutes and you did three hours and 40 minutes.
 Did you want to read them your Friday numbers or your Thursday numbers?
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 And oh, look, the internet's not so much.
    </li><li>Oh, we can't look.
 Oh, okay.
 Well, we won't talk about in the fives and sixes then, shall we?
    </li><li>I don't like what you're instimulating.
 You know I can edit this, right?
    </li><li>I know I do.
    </li><li>And then this morning at church,
 we baptized over 50 people.
    </li><li>Yeah.
    </li><li>You baptized a bunch of them.
    </li><li>I did.
 It was awesome.
 I had moments where I couldn't see very well,
 just because my eyes were all tearing up,
 but that's okay.
 Yeah, there was 33 scheduled to be baptized.
 And then I spoke on baptism and basically what happens
 and who should get baptized and all that kind of stuff.
 And then said, if anybody wants to join us,
 if you're just feeling like the Holy Spirit's
 getting your attention and saying,
 you'd like to get baptized today,
 then meet us back here.
 And another 20 people came back or something.
    </li><li>And we bought enough changes of clothes and towels.
    </li><li>For 10 people.
    </li><li>For a bunch of people.
 but then they all had to share matte clothes,
 which can't really be--
    </li><li>Or towels.
 Well, some people just went in their regular clothes.
 I don't know how they drove home,
 I guess they just drove home wet.
 But it's a cold day to do that.
    </li><li>Well, it's fun because that's what we're talking
 about this week, baptism.
 So I'm gonna sit back and relax
 because you're the baptism expert.
 So talk to us about baptism.
    </li><li>So one of the things I found out was that baptism
 is from the word baptism,
 which its root word is Bapto.
 And Bapto actually is,
 it would have been a common word
 that was used to describe what happened to fabric.
 Where if you Baptoed a fabric,
 you would hold it like fully submerged it into bleach
 to clean it, and then you would fully submerge it
 into dye to make it into a new color.
 And it would be a permanent change.
 You'd never be able to take it back to its original state.
 So I thought, oh, that's really interesting.
 you know, considering that baptism, you know, according to Roman six is us, the old man,
 you know, dying and we're being made clean and then going through the process like Jesus
 died and is resurrected.
 We are, we are being submerged under the water in symbolism of dying with Jesus and then
 coming up in symbolism of resurrection, but we are a new, we're a new person, we're a
 clean person and we're never to be the same.
 So I thought that was really cool, you know, that the root word, they would have understood
 it in those times when you said you're going to get baptized, they knew what that meant.
 So while it's really cool that that's the word and where it's from, of course, we're
 not saved through baptism, we're saved by believing in Jesus Christ, but they would
 have understood the ritual to be a cleaning, you know, to me, like to symbolize a cleaning
 or be made clean.
 So I thought that was really super cool, just as a visual.
 That was cool.
 So I thought it was funny.
 Tia, our 10 year old, is she 10?
 No, she's eight.
 Oh, Tia, our eight year old, she got baptized and there was kind of a last minute
 decision.
 Well, it wasn't in that she's been thinking about it for years now.
 Yes, but she didn't realize we were baptizing until last night.
 She heard about it and she was like, I want to get baptized.
 Well, no, she heard about it a couple of weeks ago, but she forgot.
 She heard me talking to Sharon about it and she went baptized.
 I want to get baptized and she got super excited and then she said, but mommy,
 can I wear goggles?
 And I was like, well, let's talk about that.
 Cause I thought, I don't know how that's going to go over.
 So goggles Tia, Tia doesn't like putting her face in the water.
 So she has these like snorkeling goggles where it doesn't just cover her eyes,
 but covers her whole nose as well.
 So she was adamant if I'm getting baptized, I have to wear my goggles.
 So we're like, okay, honey, but we were asking her, Hey, do you understand what
 baptism is?
 do you know why we get baptized?
 And just explaining to her, it's this declaration.
 It's this beautiful visual, like you said, symbolism,
 this declaration to the world,
 that you're a follower of Christ.
 And again, the symbolism is beautiful.
 I explained to her just as Jesus died
 and was buried in the ground,
 but he also was resurrected.
 So we are in baptism, you know, being buried,
 so to speak.
 And then when we come up, we're displaying to the world,
 our passion and our dedication to follow Jesus.
 And she got it.
 I mean, she was excited the whole morning.
 I thought maybe is she gonna chicken out?
 Is she gonna feel freaked out?
 But no, she absolutely loved it.
    </li><li>Yeah, I was sort of explaining it this morning as,
 you know, 'cause it's Super Bowl Sunday today.
 And I was saying, you know, baptism is like
 putting on the team jersey.
 You know, it's putting on and saying,
 this is who I'm for, you know.
    </li><li>That's the sports analogy I actually get.
    </li><li>Thank you. Isn't that great?
    </li><li>Very good.
 So yeah, it was, it was really fun.
 She asked me in the kitchen yesterday,
 she's like, "Mommy, how many times are you gonna
 "have to dunk me under?"
 Which I thought was really cute.
 It's like, I don't know how bad have you been.
    </li><li>I know, it's just kidding.
    </li><li>Horrible.
    </li><li>What did a bunch of people get baptized this morning
 who'd been baptized before?
 Talk about that.
    </li><li>Well, you know, it's interesting in the New Testament,
 we don't see anybody baptized as children per se.
 So that is interesting.
 And the idea is that you're supposed to have a level
 of understanding of what you're doing
 to go and be baptized.
 So, and then of course you have people that were baptized
 like with a sprinkle baptism as opposed to submersion
 and all that kind of stuff.
 So there was a bunch of people that got baptized today
 that were either baptized as children or as teens
 or whatever where they had a level of understanding
 at the time enough to want to do it,
 which is amazing.
 And just, you know, much like Tia,
 I know Tia's understanding of the Lord is gonna grow.
 And probably as an adult, she's gonna go,
 "I wanna do this again,
 "'cause now I more fully understand who God is
 "and who He wants to be to me and what He did for me.
 "But I also didn't wanna squash her excitement
 "about a yes to God at this age and her wanting to do it."
 So sort of the same thing.
 So when we were teaching on year two,
 of course we did two weeks where we go first by verse
 through Romans, which we've talked about in previous podcasts.
 And then year one, did a teaching on the power of the cross.
 And at the end of that, we were having a lot of questions
 about when could we get baptized?
 I'd like to get rebaptized.
    </li><li>Like the students were asking.
    </li><li>Yeah.
 And so the senior team decided to do a baptism sooner
 than we were planning to because of all of the interest in it.
 So the people, most of the people I would say
 from the school that got baptized today,
 had been baptized as children or as young teens.
 And they were like, you know what?
 Now I know what I'm giving my life to fully.
 I wanna give God my yes again today and get rebaptized,
 which I'm totally fine with.
 In Acts 19, Paul rebaptizes a group of people that say,
 "I was baptized into the baptism of repentance for my sins,
 and he invites them to be baptized
 and then to be baptized in the Holy Spirit."
 and he does actually physically water baptize them.
 So it's okay to be baptized more than once.
    </li><li>Right.
    </li><li>It was interesting I was talking to one of the guys
 from Caleb Company this morning, Todd,
 and he was saying that in the Jewish tradition,
 they have something called Mitzvahs, I think he called it.
 And he said it's when you would get baptized
 when you're heading into a new season of life
 or you're experiencing a breakthrough or whatever
 that you would quite often do this thing
 of fully submerging yourself to signify a change.
 And he said even like married couples,
 like they would actually, you'd get married
 and then you would both get baptized together
 and things like that.
 And I thought, oh, that's so cool, you know?
 So yeah, it was really exciting to just see
 a whole bunch of really mature believers
 and believers that have really been walking with the Lord for a really long period of time,
 but that the Lord sort of knocked on their hearts and their resounding yes was evidenced
 in how wet they ended up a little while later.
 So yeah.
 There was a lot of water.
 You know what was interesting?
 That I hadn't seen before was manifestations plus water.
 That's pretty fun.
 That's interesting.
 This could be all kinds of crazy.
 Yeah. And actually, I think because we had so many more people get baptized than we expected,
 we probably should have filled the tank up more. The water would level with every
 closed person climbing out was going down. It was like getting really low. I was like, wow.
 Towards the end, you're like, I was like praying for the increase of water. I was just like,
 This is not good, but it turned out all right.
 So yeah, it was quite fun.
 So babe, I have a question.
 Do you remember when you were baptized?
 I do remember when I was baptized.
 So how old were you?
 Now, see, that's a tricky question because the things I don't do well.
 Our ages, numbers, names, spaces.
 Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
 I'm not very good at estimating time.
 Yeah.
 Like in my head, I've told myself I gave my life to Jesus when I was seven.
 and i was baptized when i was twelve but on a seven made up those numbers
 okay and they feel true okay if my mom was alive she'd be able to tell us i'm sure she had pictures
 somewhere yeah and actually brought my eldest sister alice and she remembers obscure stuff
 like that she can probably remember but yeah certainly i remember being a child and i remember
 you know i was raised in the brethren baby so i had my i had my doctrine right about why i was
 doing it yes i'm glad that the twelve-year-olds in the brethren have their doctor
 and all sort of that.
 But you know how I said that, like I met Jesus as my savior when I was seven.
 He didn't become my lord till my mid twenties.
 So I'm like, ah, I don't get baptized in the Holy Spirit until I was in my twenties either.
 Yeah.
 So maybe I should have got baptized again this morning.
 I could have done it.
 You were a boss up there.
 I was a boss.
 I love baptizing people.
 I tell you what I loved.
 And this is going to sound funny.
 I mentioned it to you this morning as I loved watching you and Shannon up there baptizing
 along with Tony and the other people who baptize.
 And some small group leaders.
 And yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Of course, Bethany, I'm thinking about all the women who were baptizing are women leaders.
 I love, I love watching women do the stuff.
 I love.
 Yeah.
 I just love it.
 happy watching you be a leader in the full respects of leadership.
 I thought that was amazing.
 Thanks.
 I thought it might be helpful for people that are listening to maybe talk a little bit about
 a little bit more about baptism, like the who's and what's and when's and that kind of stuff,
 just to give people a little bit of a grid.
 In Acts 2, verse 38 says, "Peter said to them, 'Repent, and each of you be baptized
 in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift
 of the Holy Spirit.'"
 When you read through Acts, there is just an encounter after encounter of people hearing
 the gospel, and their immediate response right afterwards is baptism.
 To sort of seal the deal in terms of, "I have just committed my life to this, and now
 I want to be made clean and be made new kind of thing.
 It is weird that we've separated the two, isn't it?
 It is, because so many of these stories, the immediate response to hearing the gospel
 is, "Find me water."
 Right?
 Right?
 But it's like we get people saved and then get them through a new members class and a discipleship
 class and then a couple of years later, we're like, "Oh, yeah, do you want to be baptized?"
 You don't get baptized, maybe.
 And it's almost like an afterthought, whereas like you say in the early church, it was,
 "Boom, let's do this thing."
 Yeah.
 I was talking to a friend of ours named Shaley this morning and she was saying when she gave her life to the Lord
 she was at an NFL event her husband played for the NFL and
 She ended up meeting the Lord at one of these events
 And she was she basically got saved and said to the guy right away like I need to get baptized
 Like that was an urgency for her. Yeah, and the guy was like no, it's okay, you know
 You can do that and she's like no
 This place has a hot tub or it has a pool or something
 I need to get baptized."
 And so they, you know, they went and took her
 and got her baptized and stuff.
 And she was saying now at this particular conference,
 I believe it's like a believer's conference
 within the NFL, they baptize every year now.
 They just plan that they're gonna do it.
    </li><li>Come on.
    </li><li>So that's so cool.
 But yeah, I love that because that seemed
 to be the common response, particularly when you're reading
 the different passages in Acts, that, you know, Lydia
 and her whole household believed in Acts 16
 and were baptized or the Philippian jailer believed and his whole household believed and they were baptized and that was in the middle of the night.
 So there seemed to be like a real like, okay, my response is obedience and heading into the waters of baptism, which is really cool.
 I also loved reading about Cornelius.
 So he and a group of other people were their first non-Jewish believers to get baptized in Acts 10,
 which is just really cool too. So I was reading through all these passages and just getting so excited about this morning and seeing people get baptized. So it was really fun.
 It felt amazing. I'm not going to lie to church. It felt electric this morning with everybody getting baptized. I was like, I love this. I felt like anything could happen.
 Yeah, so cool. Well, it's interesting. Like I've been, I've seen baptisms and been part of baptisms before where people got baptized and came up out of the water and they went home and realized they didn't have whatever sickness.
 they came with. And so you, I mean, all kinds of stuff happens in those kind of moments.
 And I love it. So I was thinking in Matthew 28 verse 19, it says, go therefore and make
 disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and
 of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you. And lo, I am with
 you always even to the end of the age. So that when we baptize people, that is what we say.
 I, I, every single person that I baptize today, I said, is my privilege to baptize you in the
 name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit and then dunk.
 Come on.
 Yeah, it was so fun.
 What would you say then, really, who's listening, who is a believer in Jesus Christ,
 but never been baptized?
 Yeah. If you, you know, if you've already given your life to the Lord,
 Find somewhere to get baptized.
 You know, if your church has baptism scheduled, go sign up for it.
 It's not about how old you are.
 We had all ages of people get baptized today.
 We did.
 It was so fun.
 But go ahead and do that.
 Or if you're someplace where you're like, I, you know, I don't know.
 I've just recently got saved.
 I'm not part of a church yet or whatever.
 Talk to whoever prayed with you, you know, whoever helped lead you to the Lord.
 See if they can help you get baptized.
 but basically you just need another believer to baptize you. Come on. Yeah. I think the last thing
 I want to say is I want to read you this verse. It's actually this particular one's from
 the message, but I'll read it from the NAS verse. It says, this is Galatians 3 verse 27. It says,
 "For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ." Really cool,
 right? We all like new clothing. You know, it's an upgrade. In the message, it says,
 your baptism in Christ was not just washing you up for a fresh start. It also involved
 dressing you in an adult faith wardrobe, Christ's life, the fulfillment of God's original promise.
 I was just like, "Ugh, I love it!" So it's the deal, you know, and it's so fun and I love seeing
 the transformation. I mean, you can literally see stuff change over people, so it's so fun.
