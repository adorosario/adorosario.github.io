<body>
<p> I hello happy birthday. Oh thank you very much.
 Do you feel older? I feel wiser. Really? Just like when past midnight you felt wiser?
 Yeah, I just rolled out of bed and I just thought surely I have understanding of the
 end of days, read the book of Daniel and Revelation made total sense to me.
 Amazing. I had no idea.<br/>
 Welcome to episode 58 of Keeping Up With Joneses where one of us is deluded.
 We'll let you guess which one.<br/>
 We had lots of connections this week.<br/>
 We did have lots of connections this week.
 You were a genius in that you managed to make eggs benedict for 10 people.
 I did.<br/>
 Do you want to talk us through that?<br/>
 Because eggs benedict is a hard enough dish to pull off for like one or two.
 But to get them plated cooked ready in the other order and delivered for 10 people and
 still have runny yolks was amazing.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 What was your top tip?<br/>
 That was my top tip.<br/>
 I had help.<br/>
 So I pre-did all the breakfast potatoes and all that kind of stuff.
 And we did mashed avocado on top of the, what are those things called?
 English muffins.<br/>
 Yep, which were toasted on a grill.<br/>
 Yes, so you did the bread toasting I was so difficult and the meat yes
 Like what we did the bacon in the oven and then we transferred it to the grill to kind of crisp up and let all the fat from the bacon drip
 on the English muffins. Yes. We also did some sausages. Yes, but the eggs were spectacular
 They turned out great. How did you do the eggs? I did them in a cupcake tin. So you poached I poached them in a muffin tin you put
 one tablespoon of water in each muffin
 Tin you know like it not with any kind of paper and everything just a tablespoon of water
 And then crack an egg into each one and then put it in the oven at 350
 for<br/>
 Eight minutes eight minutes. Yeah. Well, I actually did close to nine. But yeah, would never have thought of that
 No, but it's right. We're just fantastically. Mm-hmm. It really did
 and they're perfectly formed circles and they were the wraps of delicious so if you
 follow some instagram know that your method of being watering on Saturday morning if you
 also follow some instagram you probably saw the most adorable thing this week which was
 certainly the highlight of my week if not the highlight of my month it was so cute which was
 our little two and a half year old boy mike john crawled in a bed one morning and you never
 lose up i was kind of lounging in bed and he stumbled upside me and he looked at me and said
 "Daddy, would you pray for me?"<br/>
 So it's like, "Sure, honey."<br/>
 So he learns back.<br/>
 I just put my hand on his chest and began praying for him.
 Well, he turned once I finished praying
 and he said, "Would you do that again?"
 So I prayed for him and I must have prayed for him
 four or five times.<br/>
 I ran out of things to prophesy over him.
</p><ul>
  <li>He did.
 I have like over two minutes of you praying for him
 and he just sat there so still.
  </li><li>And then AJ kinda came in and took a photo.
 And in the photo, or I'll put a link to it in the show notes,
 You see MJ lying back with his hands lifted high, classic receive mode.
 His little eyes were flickering as the Holy Spirit was resting on him.
 It was all I could do to not just ball.
 You did ball.
 Well, yeah, I did, but not right then.
 No, he kind of, you finished praying for him and he went, "I play with trucks and jump
 down off the bed and then he is burst into tears."
 It was amazing.
 Very moving.
 Three of our favorite prophets were in one room this weekend.
 Very true.
 Our friend, Larry Randolph, was hosting his...
 Seems like annual conference now, the Blue Moon Conference.
 I think so, yeah.
 And he had Graham Cook and David Wagner in town,
 and so it was fun to see those guys and...
 get a little bit of hangout with those guys.
 And then Brian and Jen Johnson from Bethel Church in Reading, California,
 were also in Franklin at the belonging.
 That's in Nashville, but yeah.
 Oh, yeah, that's...
 I just kind of grouped the two cities in one.
 You're absolutely right. The belonging.
 And we couldn't go on for it because we all had a meeting scheduled, but it sounded amazing and looked incredible.
 All reports are that it was fantastic.
 What else has been happening?
 I've been working some this week on my children's book.
 So I got a couple more pages of the animation done, which is great.
 It takes me several hours.
 Is this your children's book called Demons Don't Make Good Pets?
 No.
 That is a good idea.
 I'm not doing a children's book about demons.
 We could totally illustrate it.
 It'd be amazing.
 Okay.
 This is spirit of gluttony.
 This is a spirit of fear.
 It would be great.
 It could be a pop up book.
 I'm thinking now.
 OK, that's just an idea out there.
 If anybody wants to take that, you can take it.
 You can run with it.
 We don't even need royalties from it.
 Yeah, just go ahead and run with that.
 What was your book that you're doing now?
 That's just won't be buying it for my children.
 Well, the working title, I don't know what it will end up being called.
 but in my head it's called becoming Ben.
 But it's basically about our friend Ben Farley,
 who graduated to heaven last October.
 And it's a children's book about the kind of life that Ben led,
 which is very much partnering with the Holy Spirit
 to see things happen everywhere he went.
 -Wow, and you're illustrating it too. -I am.
 -As I've been watching, you're an amazing illustrator.
 -Thanks.
 The first thing I've actually tried to illustrate.
 And how you're using an iPad to do all in i am i'm using procreate on the iPad no jokes about procreate.
 I wish people could see your mark as soon as i said procreate.
 On the topic of writing stuff i wrote a review of the apple watch many people i bumped into in the last couple weeks and were like how are you enjoying apple watch.
 They don't say that in a high pitch voice but that was me different.
 How do you enjoy for Apple Watch?
 So I, well, thank you. So I actually wrote down a couple of my thoughts on the Apple Watch.
 If you're interested in that or you're interested in the Apple Watch, go to Alan and AJ.com/Watch
 to read that. Of course, one of the most wonderful things in our household this week was your
 birthday today. That's right. Hence my new levels of wisdom. Right.
 dreams and revelation.
 I mean, it's phenomenal.
 And chocolate.
 You got lots of chocolate.
 How were those raspberry lintes, by the way?
 No, we're not good.
 No, I was wondering.
 Tejas desperately wanted to buy them.
 And then what did she say?
 I don't like raspberry when you tried.
 My six-year-old bought me a bag of chocolate.
 And as soon as I opened them, I was like, oh, look at these
 chocolate shoes.
 Like, can I have one?
 I was like, I'm sensing an ulterior motive
 and virtually seeing our topic for this week, babe.
 Yes.
 Do you remember a couple of weeks ago we had Josh and Sarah Parsons?
 Yeah.
 And they came on, they talked about their story of, you know, moving here and
 transitioning, you know, through different seasons of life.
 We probably got more feedback on that session than any other session that we've
 done, just people coming up to us and saying, Oh, I just love their story.
 It was just awesome hearing.
 It was a huge encouragement.
 Wow.
 I know.
 And it is.
 It's, I just love hearing people's stories and their journeys with God.
 And we have another young couple in our church going through an incredible
 transition, Sam and Tink, who are actually heading off to Australia.
 And I think two weeks ago, they were a church.
 And so we've walked with them for four and a half years and, you know, we've
 helped them in their journeys or deciding what they're doing.
 But as they told their story to our church, I was thinking, I never heard that
 part of the story.
 Oh my gosh, that part's amazing.
 That's encouraging.
 Very cool.
 And I thought, I wonder if there's any way we could get their story on the
 podcast that other people could listen to it.
 Yeah.
 And then we realized we run the podcast, of course we could do whatever we want.
 And so we asked them earlier this week to come on the show.
 They've actually left Nashville now at the time of us recording this, but they came
 around earlier this week and we interviewed them and we're going to play that for you shortly.
 But, baby, you had an amazing little revelation that popped in your head.
 We're talking about, you know, what is the theme of this podcast aside from it being salmon ting.
 And you said this amazing thing.
 What did you say?
 I said that when you blossom where you're planted, you will often end up getting transplanted
 into a place where you can grow even bigger.
 So Tink and Sam really blossomed where they were planted here and they took whatever
 opportunities that they had to serve and to grow.
 And now they're getting a much bigger opportunity to serve and to grow.
 So it's very cool.
 I'm not sure if we covered this in the interview, but here's the brief synopsis.
 Emmantink arrived at Grace Center four and a half years ago.
 They just jumped straight and they got plugged in.
 They served in our youth department.
 They served on our worship team.
 They came into the school.
 They then staffed a school.
 They helped out at M&amp;A.
 And they absolutely just got plugged in.
 And I love that picture because, not that I know anything about horticulture at all,
 but I do understand that when you plant something in a tiny little pot, at some point you have
 to move it to a larger pot to help it grow.
 I think that's exactly what's happened to them. They're some of the first fruits of them just
 flourishing and blossoming. And God's saying, I'm going to take you and the area that you've grown
 and all the nutrients that you've sucked up from this song, I'm going to transplant you somewhere
 else so that you can cross-pollinate with other cultures and you can receive what they have and
 bring what they have. So that's the interview that you're about to hear next is their journey
 into this next season of their life. So hope you enjoy it.
 Amazing.
 Adjjons yes, we have some very special guests we do indeed we have Samuel and tingkalicious.
 Wow that is my name and delicious that is my proper god given name.
 They're here right now.
 Sam ting say hello surprise.
 Hey which one switch you can't tell because my voice is gone so I sound like Sam but this is ting.
 Yeah, this is me Sam.
 -Tink, you're in a screamer band.
 Is that right? Is that why your throat is so rough?
 -It's a rough life.
 -Introduce yourself to everybody.
 Tell us a little bit about yourself, where you're from,
 how you ended up sitting on our surface.
 -Well, my parents met in Reno and...
 [laughter]
 I'm Sam, I'm from Smyrna, Tennessee, born and raised.
 Met Tink there when we were 17.
 Started in high school. Yeah, how old do you never context 24?
 Seven years ago. Yes, and we started dating when we were 16, but we met when we were like 13
 So literal childhood sweethearts literal. Yeah, we went to prom together
 We
 Went through the whole going steady thing. It's a fun time. I wouldn't say we did dating right, but it ended up okay
 You know with the whole matching ring scenario.
 Right, right.
 And so you met in school, fell in love, and then tell us how you got into our orbit.
 So we were both youth leaders.
 I was an assistant youth pastor in Smyrna, and we were both really involved in our church
 there.
 It was like his home church and my home church.
 And my friend Shelby Hornbuckle told me about these new pastors that started a movement called
 "M&amp;A" and told me that I should come and stop by.
 And so we came, well I told Sam that I was going to go in, so I went and loved it.
 I had never experienced anything like it.
 I mean I came from kind of a spirit-led church, but I had never experienced the presence of
 God that way.
 So I would come back every Monday while still being very much a member of my other church,
 but would kind of hide in the back of emanate on Mondays and would call myself like a secret
 emanator and would tell Sam about it all the time.
 And it's good because you hid among all the other Asians that came so you didn't stand out at all.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Nobody near there.
 There was the Asian collective at the back and you just joined them.
 Yeah, exactly.
 And we all looked the same so you wouldn't have known.
 Blended right in.
 Blended right in.
 for those of you that don't live in Frankly, there is not a large Asian population. In
 fact, Tink was our first Asian to start attending. And I'm putting up a few signs.
 Talk to me about you said that, you know, experiencing the presence of God. That's something
 that phrase we're familiar with, but there may be people listening. That just sounds
 an alien thing. So when you say experience the presence of God, what did that look like
 sound like feel like? Well, I just specifically remember in worship, um, they're not being
 any words that like it was, it was really just like sounds. And I remember like the
 swells on the guitar and like the crescendo of the music. And all of a sudden I felt like
 tingles on my body. I felt tingles throughout my body. And I felt this overwhelming piece
 And I just wanted to like weep, but it wasn't a sad weep.
 It wasn't anything but like an overwhelming cry that came to me.
 And I just I couldn't stop crying and it wasn't because I was thinking about anything or upset or really anything.
 It was just like overwhelmed.
 It was being so overwhelmed with, I mean, the presence of God.
 So Sam, yep, that sounds as weird as anything.
 So your wife is coming home going, you know, it's one thing to say,
 I was in the president of God tonight. It's nothing to say I went to church tonight and there was swells of a guitar and I can stop crying, but I'm not sad.
 How are you processing all this information from tink?
 Well, I grew up in an assemblies of God church that used to be Pentecostal. So I was used to hearing stuff like that.
 So I wasn't really super surprised about it and it didn't like really freak me out.
 I thought something was kind of weird about it, but what I took away that was so amazing is the teaching sheet.
 She talked about that went alongside of all of the things that were happening, Holy Spirit
 wise and the presence of God wise.
 And it was like, I've never heard anybody make that much sense about the presence of
 God.
 Right.
 So then when did you end up coming to Emily Sam?
 After Tink's first encounter weekend, that was what really sold me at Uniminate.
 Why?
 Because of the teaching she brought back from it.
 She was telling me all right, sins of the fathers and all those things and how they
 line up with scripture and I was like, this is crazy.
 I've never seen anybody dissect that that much.
 I'd heard like utterings about it, like growing up.
 Right.
 But did you notice a difference in Tinkhaff?
 The encounter weekend?
 Yeah.
 She stops smoking crack at that point.
 She threw away all her cigarettes.
 What was the encounter we can like for you, Tink?
 Well, the encounter we can really changed my life in the sense that it was like.
 It was like I took all of that experience that was happening.
 and it all made sense of why.
 It was like I was talking to my heart individually
 throughout the entire encounter weekend
 and was learning why I was the way I was
 and really encountered God
 and letting God completely do 180 on my life
 and just telling me exactly why I was the way I was
 and how he could redeem everything.
 It was pretty awesome.
  </li><li>That's amazing.
 I think we get so used to talk about aging
 I think we get so used to what our normal is, that it's really refreshing to hear other
 people who encounter it for the first time.
 Because you know, all this stuff is really normal and we forget it's not to some people.
 Yeah.
 Well, I think it's life changing when you realize that at least some of the dynamics that you're
 living under have to do with outside things rather than inside things.
 and that you can have freedom from it.
 So life doesn't have to look like that
 for the rest of your life.
 There's actually a fix, if you will,
 and there's a way of inviting Jesus
 into the midst of that
 so that life gets to look so much better.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So it's kind of, it's exciting.
 I love watching people at the beginning
 of the encounter weekend
 and then when they leave the encounter weekend
 and they just, they look different in two days.
  </li><li>We should probably explain one encounter weekend
 is in case there's people unfamiliar with that term and concept.
 It's a weekend where you just go away and you invite the Holy Spirit
 in to deal with your stuff, with your family dynamics,
 with your personal dynamics, with your wounds, that kind of stuff.
 And you get freed up from the sins of previous generations
 and whatever might be flowing down through generational lines.
 It isn't life and that kind of stuff.
 So it's just sort of a clean sweep of your life.
 and hopefully setting you up with great tools
 to be able to walk forward and get free of things.
  </li><li>So the reason we wanted you on the podcast
 is that you guys are about to head off to Australia.
 You're about to partner with our good friends,
 Gary and Sarah Morgan.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And you're moving to Melbourne,
 and that's a huge adventure.
 But as you were sharing your story,
 I mean, I've known you guys for five years,
 but as you were sharing your story at church on Sunday,
 there was details I had never heard before,
 and I was like, man, that is incredible,
 especially in light of, you know, when Josh and Sarah Parsons were on talking about their
 story, I thought it would be huge encouragement for people to hear your journey.
 So, well, first of all, tell us what you're doing and then tell us how that all started.
 We're going to Australia.
 We're going there to just start a young adults group and a youth ministry inside of the church
 that is already established at Hillview.
 And Gary and Sarah just invited us to go on a journey with them and doing that and kind
 gave us a blank canvas to create something there because they were saying that the signs were clear
 and that it's us to come and you know we really trusted that and felt well I mean based on our
 story we had a lot of confirmations. How do you explain Gary and Sarah Morgan to people who have
 never encountered Gary and Sarah Morgan? I mean seriously. Well the way I normally say it is he's
 a legit profit, he will know what your birthday is. And that's how you'll know.
 I love the time.
 Yeah.
 I was speaking to him this weekend. He was at a conference in Perth, I think it was.
 Mm hmm. Yeah.
 I mean, it was one of the most amazing prophecies I've ever heard that he's standing ministering
 and he sees a lady out of the corner of his right eye.
 He sees two dates and he sees a young man playing a guitar in heaven.
 So he goes over to the lady and just says, he knows one of the dates and just says, I
 know this year has been hard for you, but your year of mourning is going to turn into
 laughter.
 And does this date mean anything to you?
 And she said, that was the year my son was born.
 And she said, does this date mean anything to you?
 She said, that was the day my son died.
 And he said, what's your son's name, Reese?
 And she just burst into tears.
 And he said, I see him in heaven.
 Kind of describes the guitar describes the whole guitar that you played.
 Oh my gosh.
 He's worshiping Jesus.
 He was like, what?
 He's going on right now.
 God.
 He's having the comfort that that is to that mom.
 That's amazing.
 Okay.
 So as gnarly and as prophetic and as insane that is on the other end of the spectrum,
 guys, just totally super normal.
 Yeah.
 The chillest dude.
 to reconcile your head.
 Even kind of goofy sometimes.
 Oh, totally.
 Oh, yeah.
 They're super fun.
 He called somebody after the conference and said to this guy, "Hey, does..."
 I forget the number, 8-0-3-0-3-0-9-2.
 And the guy said, "Yeah, that's my pet."
 And his wife hit him.
 And it was his pin number.
 So anyway, that's Gary Sierse.
 You're going to go be with Gary and Sarah in Australia.
 They're really good friends of ours, really good friends of Grace Center have been here
 many, many times.
 How does one get from Smyrna, Tennessee,
 living in Franklin, Tennessee,
 to moving your whole life to the other side of the world
 to go work with some just amazing leaders and prophets?
 And what was your journey to that?
 You must have had this plan,
 you must have just worked the plan,
 just like crowbarred your way in there,
 great looking resume, all that sort of stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah, we paid some people.
  </li><li>Yeah, I paid off a couple of pastures.
 (laughing)
 Now the people how you step into the next season of what God has for you in your in your experience. What happened?
 So when Gary and Sarah were here, so Will Sam and I became students of the School of Supernatural Life.
 I did it a first year by myself and that year was when Gary and Sarah Morgan actually came for having declares and we had seen them before.
 previous to this and have just been blown away every time.
 So that you saw them at a conference at Grace Center before
 and I've seen him call people out and like, just say everything
 that had to be from God.
 And so we already knew who they were and that conference
 and the clairs I was sitting in the back by myself and Sam was at work.
 And I remember watching them prophesy over people and I'm just crying
 in the back and I had this thought to myself for I was just like, man, those are like our spiritual heroes.
 It would be so amazing to work with them. But you didn't know them at this point. You'd never met them.
 No, we'd never met them. I mean, I had talked to Sarah right before that session and I just told her,
 like I kind of gave her like a small prophetic word that I had seen over her as I like a little
 picture, but we'd never like personally met. Okay. And so like I had that thought and then
 I wanted to dismiss it, but in the school you learn that God cares about the things that you care about and that actually the desires of your heart really matter.
 And so I like said with God, I was like, you know, this that would be really amazing to work with them one day.
 How many years ago was this?
 I think this is four years ago.
 Four years ago, you're sitting, you're really impressed by these guys hearts or character, they're gifting their life.
 And you just think, Lord, I mean, it's impractical.
 It's implausible.
 But you're like, Lord, I'd really love to be involved in their life.
 I'd love to have more relationship with them than I currently do, which is zero.
 That was four years ago.
 Yeah, exactly.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, that was four years ago.
 Then what?
 So I had that thought and I shared it with God.
 And then I basically, I had this like vision of us, me and Sam standing next to them at
 their church in Australia that we hadn't seen before.
 And I just, you know, went with it.
 And then as soon as I went there in my head, Sarah Morgan called my name out in real life.
 And so she called my name out and she said, "Tink, where are you?"
 I was like so freaked out and she called me to the front until I walked up to the front
 and her and Gary and AJ gave me the most life changing word that night.
 What was the word?
 Do you remember?
 Well, I do remember Sarah telling me that I was going to teach people how to be child
 like and that it was like a gift for me to be child like.
 And then Gary actually fell out in the spirit.
 I got felt in the spirit and then he was like, I'm going to pull Benny,
 and pick it back up.
 I remember that.
 I totally remember that.
 Yeah, he goes pick it back up.
 I'm going to pull a Benny,
 and I'm going to pull a Benny, and right now pick her back up.
 And so I got up and he said that he saw a lower case D over my head for
 doubt and that I've doubted the things that I'm capable of and I doubt who I am
 and things that I can do.
 And four years ago, was that right?
 Right.
 It was absolutely right.
 And he said that I had to grow up fast.
 He was like, you had to really grow up fast and was the quickening of your
 spirit.
 The Lord says that he's formed a covenant between you and him and that he's
 erasing the lowercase D and replacing it with a capital D for destiny and that
 you're going to catch something that will go viral.
 And then he called me a social media pastor, which was pretty.
 It's very cool, especially considering now, like when you think about, right.
 You're like the guru, the social media guru.
 I do love social media.
 And for the last year at School of Supernatural Life, you are a social media person.
 It's true.
 Because we heard that word from Gary, you know, we were just like, yes.
 And the growing up fast part without going into your whole life, that was true too.
 Oh, yeah.
 Absolutely.
 My dad passed away when I was 16.
 So I had to grow up really fast and move my life over here to Nashville and
 I'll take care of my mom and kind of just take care of myself,
 and learn how to grow up really fast.
 So it was super spot on.
 And it's sometimes hard for people who aren't the people receiving the
 prophetic word to understand the impact of the prophetic word.
 Right.
 Because no doubt it wasn't just that the revelation was correct.
 It is that the kindness of God that he'd call you out by name, minister into
 those deep areas, and then give you a promise that would springboard
 you into hope. He's amazing like that, isn't he?
  </li><li>He's so crazy.
  </li><li>So Sam, where were you at this point?
  </li><li>I was working. I was at Starbucks washing dishes.
  </li><li>Just living the life of glamour.
  </li><li>Well, to be honest, that was the best part about Starbucks was washing dishes, so...
 [laughter]
 I was having the time of my life.
  </li><li>So you don't know any of this has happened to think?
  </li><li>Well, no. I didn't. I could kind of feel like something was going on.
 I knew she was at the conference, and I wanted to be there, but I had to work.
 But people started texting me, being like,
 "Dude, you're watching, the crazy things are happening."
 And that was all they would say.
 And I'd be like, "What's going on?"
 And probably about the same time,
 right before I got any text message,
 I was just washing dishes.
 And I saw that same sort of vision
 of just standing in Australia.
 Like, you know, look at the continent
 and then two little people standing on it,
 like a wedding cake, something like that.
 So that's what I saw.
 And then people started texting me that something was going on.
 And I was like, really trying to wash those dishes fast to get out of there.
 Cause I had to go see what was happening.
 And then, yeah, I got off work and talked with Tink.
 And she told me that the whole thing, she just, you know, went through the story.
 And it was just like, wow, this is crazy.
 Why, why is this happening simultaneously different places?
 So you have a word, you have a little dream in your heart.
 I imagine everything changes the next day.
 You get flights, you're moving.
 No.
 No.
 No.
 So back to normal everyday life.
 Totally.
 Active dishwashing and Starbucks.
 Yeah.
 So what do you do with that?
 You just pocket it in your heart, just treasured it.
 Yeah.
 We just kind of put it away but didn't dismiss it.
 we were like, we're like, well, I mean,
 this is something that we both saw.
 So let's just kind of keep it in our heart.
 And then from then on, we started getting really weird,
 like really weird things would happen
 where we would get unknown calls from Australia.
  </li><li>Yeah, weird connections with Melbourne specifically.
  </li><li>Yeah, specifically Melbourne.
  </li><li>You mean your phone would just ring
 and it was somebody in Melbourne?
  </li><li>Yeah, it would say Melbourne, Australia.
 And then like we got like emails from Melbourne.
  </li><li>Well the emails were all about flights too.
 like flights to Melbourne deals with flights on Melbourne and like this things like that.
 And I would try to unsubscribe from them. I would go down to the bottom of the email,
 unsubscribe and then they would just keep coming.
 It was crazy. So you're getting random calls, emails, signs pointing to Melbourne.
 Yeah. But still no avenues to go to Melbourne. Nothing. No, we didn't even like,
 we weren't even thinking about it. It wasn't even really on our radar. Yeah, it would just happen
 as life went on. Right? And you're in the school, you're watching
 dishes at Starbucks. He's a student in the school now. Oh, right. You're now a student.
 As these things were happening, I ended up going to the year after Tink and she was a
 small group leader. And we asked Tink to come back and be a small group leader. So you're
 Tink, you're staffing the school, Sam, your student on the school. And it comes up for
 outreaches. And it just so happens that this year, one of our outreach locations is Melbourne,
 Australia. Yep. Now, Tink, you have no choice just to
 let people understand, you know, the passes of the school decide, we just pray about it
 and decide who of our staff are going to go where. So you could have gone to Israel, South
 Africa, China, that would have been good.
 I know, I mean, that would have been Australia, wherever. But Sam, you picked Australia. Why
 did you pick Australia as a student?
 Based solely on the signs that we've been getting, like I was like, okay, this, like,
 why I've been getting these emails. I can't stop getting.
 Because I'm going to do outreach.
 Yeah.
 And if I'm not wrong, Australia was the most expensive outreach.
 Yeah, it was. That's another thing too. I knew we couldn't afford it. I mean, we could
 hardly afford to go to school. But I mean, that was like the deliberate sacrifice because
 of the transaction that happened. So we had enough just to put the deposit down and I
 didn't know where she was going to go on outreach. She didn't either. And we both knew we wanted
 to go to Australia just because everything is happening.
 So I put down the $500 deposit and that actually ended up being the only thing we paid for
 that trip.
 Everything else came in.
 I didn't have to pay anything else.
 Because it was like, it was like $3,500.
 It was a lot.
 It was as much as tuition.
 And what's crazy is we didn't know all this stuff about Australia behind the scenes.
 And we just prayed about it.
 I felt like things should go to Australia.
 that you and Kate Dunden led a team to Australia.
 Your husband's a student on the school,
 but there's like 10 other people on the team and off you go.
 And we don't have a clue any of this is percolating in your heart.
 So you got to Australia have exceptional favor.
 Any highlights from being in Australia that you remember?
 I mean, it was the best trip we've ever been on.
 And like working with Gary and Sarah and not only working with them,
 but just being around them was so incredible for us.
 It was like we had never experienced people that lived
 so like saturated in the presence
 and like being around them and learning
 how they lived their life was so inspirational for us.
 And like we came back changed.
 Like that was already enough for us.
 Just the trip in itself was the experience that we thought.
 It was just like, oh God, absolutely just wanted us
 to go there for three weeks and learn everything
 that we did from them.
 And so you were thinking that's what I saw.
 That's what that vision was.
 That was exactly what we--
 Yeah, we thought, oh cool, God just wrapped this up.
 That was great.
 We had some great prophetic things happen.
 A bunch of people on the team got
 like prophetic words of knowledge about people.
 And it was really cool.
 We got to do literally everything we learned in the school.
 And we thought that was it for Australia.
 Sam, didn't you call somebody out by name
 while you were there as well or something or a number?
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I did.
 That happened with me and Kate Dunden got a specific number about this lady waiting on her husband to come see her because he couldn't get in the country.
 And she said, there's a countdown to 24 or something.
 And then 24 days after that, her husband got to come into Australia, like out of nowhere.
 So it was a really special trip.
 Right.
 Amazing.
 Yeah.
 So you come home thinking that's it.
 We're like, that was an amazing connection.
 That's why we made an amazing connection there.
 And now looking back, what was that?
 Um, now we look back and we're like, man, we really did not see anything.
 But God was, God was being pretty like, I don't know.
 It's just so funny when we look back now, because God was leaving us little hints
 throughout the entire time.
 Right.
 And now when we look back, I'm like, Oh, it was like he was being obvious, but he
 really wasn't now.
 It was the appetizer.
 Yeah.
 We didn't realize it at all.
 And, and now it just makes it even better.
 It was like Paul Kane, one of my heroes of the faith said that God gives you a foretaste.
 So you get a taste for what he's bringing.
 And so I just think that, you know, that's it there that you go and comes back to, you know,
 sit this many times on the podcast that your prophetic words are best understood in hindsight.
 So, you know, you're saying we look back and just saw these obvious signs.
 Well, at the time, you know, you don't have a lens to look through.
 So you come back.
 I'll jump in here.
 Gary and Sarah call us and just said, Hey, Sam and Tink, what's the deal with them?
 We're like, they're the worst people in the world.
 We just said, yes, I think are amazing.
 What are you feeling?
 And they're like, we just totally feel that they should be here.
 We don't want to ask them without, you know, we were just running around
 and past you as their leaders.
 Like, what do you think?
 We're like, Oh my gosh, they went to take amazing.
 You know, there'd be absolutely incredible.
 But we were thinking of asking Sam to come back and be a small group leader.
 and we're thinking of asking you think to come back again as a small group leader
 just because we saw such tremendous leadership on you guys, you know, everything we'd given you to do you just
 Blossomed and flourished and we're like man, we would love another year with them
 So we thought it would be fun to give you guys an opportunity to lead together as well
 Yeah, safe environment like where it was familiar
 So he said to Gary sir, you know go ahead and ask them like you know do what you want just so you know from our perspective
 We're thinking of asking to be small group leaders.
 We don't own them.
 We don't have first dibs on them or anything like that.
 You know, just, you know, pitch it to them and then see what they want.
 And I think it was about that time that they reached out to you.
 Is that right?
 And so would you consider coming and you were like, let me pray about that.
 Yeah.
 It was the day after we were asked to be small group leaders.
 No.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, it was definitely was.
 So we asked you to be small group leaders.
 And the next day Gary and Sarah say, would you consider coming?
 Yeah.
 So they ask you, what are you thinking?
 We're thinking, man, it would be awesome to do both.
 Like, I mean, that's literally what I thought.
 I'm pretty sure Tink thought that too.
 Yeah.
 Well, we, we definitely knew it was God as soon as they asked us.
 Yeah.
 Um, just because we had been hearing from the Lord so much
 through numbers. I had been seeing the number 08 since before we even went on the Australian
 outreach trip. And so with that day that they asked us, I saw the number 1208, like a thousand
 times that day. I even went into the Target store and like every clock on the clock, I always said
 the 1208. And I heard the Lord audibly say, like, you'll find out what this is tonight.
 And like between me and God, it's like hard to surprise me, like just in life, like it's really hard to surprise me.
 It's hard to surprise her.
 And so God was like, you'll know tonight, like get ready.
 And then that night we were FaceTiming with Gary and Sarah, which was kind of normal.
 Like we weren't expecting anything of it.
 And at 12.08 that night was when they invited us to move there.
 And it was like, it just, it made complete sense.
 We knew it was God.
 It was perfect confirmation.
 we both just started crying when we got off the phone.
  </li><li>Yeah, our jaws dropped, literally.
 We just hung up the FaceTime and just sat in silence
 for a good five minutes.
  </li><li>You know what I love about,
 I love so much about that story.
 I don't know the 12 or 18.
 But what I love about this,
 'cause I know what happens next,
 is you then called us and just said,
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Can we run something past you?
 And I think there's something incredibly precious
 about being willing to submit
 something that you so desperately want to be God to your leaders who could turn around
 and say, we don't think this is God.
 That's what you said at first is a joke.
 First thing you're like, yeah, that's not God.
 Sorry about that.
 I don't know.
 It was great.
 I don't remember that.
 I wouldn't have had it any other way.
 That's why I brought you to Taser's for those kind of moments.
 But there's that tight rope of, oh God, I really want to do this.
 I hope they don't say no.
 I hope they let me.
 that we would stop you, but there's something so wonderful about bringing that.
 It's certainly in my experience.
 You know, the Lord speaks to me, a dream and a vision or something.
 And then I take it and there's a temptation to just run it, run with it.
 Oh, it's mine, you know, and I don't want leaders telling me I can't do this, blah, blah, blah, blah,
 but we all know where that ends.
 And then you take it to your leaders and say, Hey, this is what I'm thinking.
 God's saying, what do you think?
 When they come back and say, Oh, yeah, this is God.
 It feels like there's a double whammy, a double anointing, a double excitement on that thing.
 Was that, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is that what happened?
 I mean, of course, I said, I don't think it's God as a joke.
 But what was your thinking behind coming and running it past us?
 I mean, it was completely submissive. We learned in the school to have,
 I don't know how you put it in your teachings, but just always have counselors above you whenever
 something comes up from journaling or hearing God's voice and things like that. And this was,
 you know, you're after the school. But we wanted to completely submit it to you guys since we
 kind of have had made you like, you know, you are pastors. We give you complete authority over
 spiritual things like that. So yeah, running it past you is definitely what we wanted to do
 immediately as soon as we got it, just to be sure.
 I'm not trying, I'm honestly not trying to make a point here.
 I'm literally interested in the answer to this question.
 So this is me trying to be cunning and setting you up.
 What do you think, hypothetically, would have been the difference between you
 hearing, I think, you know, Gary Cervasas to do that, not running past us and going
 and doing it, which would be totally okay, right?
 You're mature people.
 You can hear from God.
 you've got people and you're going off versus what you did do, which was run it past us
 and say, "Hey, what do you think? Would you pray about it? Do you think this is a Lord?"
 What do you think the fruit or the outcome would have been doing it one way versus doing
 the other?
 I think if we didn't take it to you guys, the Lord would have blessed it too. And then
 even when we did take it to you, he blessed it even more. I just feel like when we took
 it to you guys, we were literally saying we don't want to have control over anything.
 We want God to be in control.
 And so with us submitting that way and seeking wisdom, it was like the past became brighter
 for us where we could see more where God wanted us to go and the direction that He wanted
 us to go rather than us being on our by ourselves.
 Like, you know, when you look at animals in a pack and they're running, like the one
 by itself is usually the one that gets attacked and we didn't want to be alone on this journey.
 We wanted to have people with wisdom, like sewing into us and just helping us.
 We want to always be willing to get help.
 I think the fruit of that now, from where we are now, is like we see how much the Lord's
 blessed this trip way more than we ever could have expected because we asked for help and
 not saying that in like a way that we're taking credit for it is just like I can see how God
 was absolutely blessing that because we wanted him like we wanted his help and nothing more.
 You know the other thing that's interesting to me which you guys had nothing to do with
 this like the only conversation we had was he guarantees have asked us what do you think
 and we're like we think it's great having amazing time and then you never asked us for
 anything after that ever. You were just like, Oh, that's awesome. And we were really excited.
 And then I think because you were willing to lose it, I think because you were willing to say,
 we think this is God, but we're willing to be wrong. What do you think? And accept,
 our timing, our response. I think because of that, the Lord just promoted you guys
 without even knowing what's happening. So behind the scenes, prophets were coming to us saying,
 who's, you know, Sam and Tink, are you aware of what they're doing? And you know, they helped us
 correct our understanding of what was doing. And their Lord really moved on behalf of you
 without you doing anything in the hearts of your leaders to help promote you and prosper you into
 what's going on. So remember James Gull came to emanate one night. You guys weren't even there.
 It was your night off. Do you remember that? And so James Gull is like, where's Sam and Tink?
 And we're like, dang it, they're not here. So we're texting. So he turns to us and prophesies and
 and says, "Samentink are the first fruits
 "and goes into this huge, big prophetic word,
 "which was almost word for word verbatim,
 "what Gary had called a couple of nights earlier
 "and given me a prophetic word,
 "which I'd completely missed."
 I don't have a clue what Gary was talking about.
 He messaged his thought, "What has happened to Alan?"
 But I wasn't picking up what he was throwing down.
 And yet the Lord was moving on your behalf.
 I feel like you took your hands off the wheel.
 You were responsible, but you were just like,
 "And we're gonna take our hands off the wheel."
 And the Lord just provided resource after resource after resource to the point where,
 you know, pastor Jeff is just like, Oh, these guys are the first fruits of something new.
 And, you know, we want to invest into them.
 And, you know, all this favor came tumbling your way.
 Yeah.
 It's really astonishing.
 I still have trouble wrapping my head around it.
 Yeah.
 All of this were still so shocked by the goodness of God.
 So I had this thought you've probably forgotten completely about this.
 But the Lord brought it back to my attention the Sunday that you were sharing a church.
 And I remember when you were a student on the school, I called you into my office because
 you were so close to not graduating because of your timeliness.
 So I'm not bringing this up to shame you.
 I'm bringing this up to say this is like amazing what God did.
 So I don't know if it's your personality.
 I didn't really know you that well, and but because of your lightness to school, because
 absences, you are right on the cusp. And I remember sitting you in my office saying,
 "Tink, you are about to not graduate. If you miss another thing, you are not going to
 graduate the school." And I remember you being really convicted, and God bless you, you were
 never late again. But I considered this when you were sharing. If you hadn't dealt with
 that little thing, you would never have graduated from the school, which means we would never
 of ask you back to be a small group leader, which means you would never have let him
 out reach to Australia, which means you would blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 Right.
 And I'm just thinking that tiny little thing, you know that verse that says surely God desires
 truth in the innermost parts, that the tiny little thing that we think isn't a big deal
 could have turned your destiny.
 You could have derailed it for a bit.
 Oh yeah.
 Isn't that crazy?
 It's so funny that you just brought that up because I was literally thinking about that
 moment in the car today. When you brought me into your office and I was like, that could have changed
 everything. And it's wild because, you know, part of the message of the school is, yeah, you have
 an amazing destiny, but you also have amazing responsibilities and actually tend to your responsibilities.
 Yeah, be responsible. Well, awesome where you're planning to do what God's asked you to do,
 do stuff on time, you know, all this sort of stuff. And sometimes we think that they are
 completely unrelated elements to the destiny and the God will all work out and it's all fine.
 But I was just thinking, man, this could end up so differently.
 It's crazy. Totally crazy.
 So let me talk about being on time. Was that a weird concept for you?
 Yeah, because I'm Asian and we live on cold people time my entire life.
 Is that a real thing?
 Oh, it's a real thing.
 Okay.
 It's a real thing.
 I can say it because I'm brown, but it's true.
 I mean, like my entire life, I've never really felt like I needed to like,
 I didn't understand the concept of honoring people with your time.
 Honoring people by being punctual.
 Like I just didn't get it.
 And you just think people are uptight or just wasn't even on your radar.
 Yeah, it wasn't on my radar.
 I was just kind of in my own world.
 And then whenever, like, whenever you sat me in your office and it really hit me
 that it was like, oh, I'm affecting my small group leader, and I'm affecting the school
 as a whole.
 But I'm also affecting my future.
 And so when I took that into context, it's like, why wouldn't I just be on time?
 I think it's just a decision, it's a quick decision.
 Just do it.
 Yeah, because you were never late again after that.
 Yeah.
 I just changed the way I thought.
 Amazing.
 I'm so glad.
 Me too.
 So you guys are about to make this amazing change in your life.
 You've transitioned with wisdom.
 As you reflect back on it, what would you say are some of the things
 that God's taught you that have perhaps surprised you?
 What has surprised me is how God has moved in all of the prophetic words
 that have been given to us.
 You mean like Gary's major word?
 No, no, no, no, like little words from.
 I mean, when I was a worship leader for the youth group, even the teens in there that
 had been taught the prophesy and just going to prophetic on Sundays and all the prophetic
 stuff that happened in school with games we'd play, all of those words pointed to this
 thing happening and the stuff around it.
 And there's still some that are still in my heart and still waiting on those.
 But I feel like God has highlighted the small words to me, the ones that aren't epic, like
 like you know, called to the front, you fall out the spirit.
 But just the ones that I got, like just from some random person walking up and be like,
 "Hey, I think God has this for you."
 And it seemed like he has had it for me in all those little times.
 So yeah.
 That's really good.
 That's amazing.
 That's really good.
 Because I think you're right.
 I think we often discount the little words that we get while we're, you know, playing
 a prophetic game or we go to Presbyterian, but it isn't Gary Morgan who gave it to us.
 It's Bob, you know.
 Yeah.
 Or whatever.
 So yeah, it's really fun in hindsight
 to be able to look back and go, oh God.
 Like you were saying the same thing
 through multiple voices.
 I also love that thing.
 Can you share about, you know,
 'cause you shared about the 12.08 thing
 and all the clocks and then calling it, you know,
 12.08 and all that kind of stuff,
 but also about your visa form.
 Oh yeah.
 Oh, that was crazy.
 So Australia just came out with Visa last year,
 which is ironic because had we had gone to Australia before being a Smogger
 pleater, we wouldn't have even tried to get this form because it came out the
 year after.
 And it's a form for people between the ages of 18 and 31 without any
 dependence to come and work in Australia for a year.
 And it's super cheap compared to the rest of the visas that allow you to work.
 Right.
 So I mean, I remember Gary saying, Oh, we got a visa for you.
 It's like they made this for you guys.
 And I was like, that's awesome.
 So I was looking over the document, like just reading all the requirements and stuff and
 Tink reads over my shoulder.
 She's like, what was that?
 Wait, scroll back up to the top.
 And I was like, okay.
 And we scroll back up to the document number and the form number for this new visa is 1208.
 I love that.
 The form document number, 1208, like top right.
 It's so ridiculous.
 It's like you can't possibly head forward thinking that God isn't in the midst of it.
 He's like, Hey, guess what?
 Here it is again.
 So cool. It's insane.
 Tink, anything that stands out to you as you reflect on your transition stuff that you're like,
 man, that's an incredible thing or wisdom you want to pass on to other people who are in your
 season because I was speaking to Gary Morgan last night, I was on the phone with him and I just said,
 Gary, what I love about hearing Sam and Tink's story is how many other people have had a fling
 thought pass through their head like, man, they're my spiritual heroes or I'd really like to be
 connected with so and so. Like why Sam and Tink, there was like, I don't know, five,
 six hundred people in the room that night. Why of all of those people did God orchestrate
 for them to come? Like how much of that had to do with your heart, your desire? I mean,
 it's just it's mind blowing. And I love stories that couldn't be orchestrated any other way.
 If that we were shinning over dinner tonight, that I know of people who've tried to make
 what's happening to you happen, especially with Gary and Sarah. And it just hasn't even
 got past the initial email. So as you reflect, what are some of the things that you would
 encourage people with who are looking and have a desire and they want to move to the
 next step?
 I think for me, like what I've learned the most, especially through this, is that God
 is like so aware of my heart and he's so in tune with me personally that like I didn't
 even have to try to do anything. Like we didn't have to try to make anything happen for us.
 We just had to talk to our dad about it.
 Talking to God, he was my father and really knowing that he heard me was almost enough
 and knowing that he knows best with what my heart desires.
 So me not having to try to do anything by my own strength or by my own ability, but knowing
 that God I've told you what I love and what I want and what I desire and I know that you
 know what's best and that he'll take that desire in my heart and just orchestrate it
 to work out for my good, no matter what.
 And even throughout all that, not losing sight of the fact that God loves me.
 And so even if it didn't happen with Gary and Sarah, I'm sure that something even more
 amazing, like something just as amazing would happen.
 And I know that it's because God would be basing it off of my desire, you know?
 Like just knowing that he knows my heart the best.
 that, you know, like just waiting and trusting him throughout all of it.
 And especially now I look back and it's been like four years since that happened.
 And what would happen if I had that thought with God and I was like, God,
 I would really love to work with them.
 And if I only thought about that for the next four years, like that would have driven
 me crazy. But like I gave it to God and then kind of just like trusted him with it
 and let it go. And then he let it grow.
 It was like, it was just like this seed that I planted in his hand and let him just grow
 it and make it.
 That's awesome.
 And then you go home with the rest of your life.
 You just kind of move on, but you don't lose hope or anything.
 It's just like...
 And you guys too, like just as an outside observer, you, when Alan says you move on with the rest
 of your life, you guys work hard.
 Like, you know, you play hard, you have friendships, you invest in friendships, but you work hard
 in your diligent and whatever, it's not like you're waiting around for destiny to come and find you.
 You're living your life and you're living it well.
 And in the background, the Lord is orchestrating this elaborate tapestry of desire and destiny
 and He's weaving it all together. I just thought, it's amazing.
 Would you guys pray for our listeners? Just bless them. There'll be people who are inspired by your
 story or people who are, I've got dreams and are one God to move on their
 behalf. And, you know, maybe are tired or we are frustrated, but would you just
 bless them and just pray for them? Give them an impartation of your hope.
 Yeah, dear God, thank you for everything you've done for us in the past couple
 years and leading us along this path that you've been building for us.
 And I pray for anybody listening just that is inspired or has a dream, has something
 like that, to just give it to you and to trust you with a God.
 And I pray that you would inspire people to live with their hands open on their dreams
 and submit it to you and that in that they would find such a hope and not a frantic chase
 after their dreams, but like a wild trust in you, God,
 that you totally know what's going on in their hearts
 and what they want and that you're orchestrating
 something for them and they can trust in that
 and believe in that and get on with their lives.
  </li><li>Yeah, Lord, and I just thank you
 that you're such an amazing father
 and that you know the desires of our heart
 and that you care about the desires of our heart.
 And I thank you that you give us the opportunity to just kind of dream with you.
 And Father, I just prefer every person that's listening that's just dreaming with you.
 And I just blessed those dreams.
 And I thank you for our testimony and our story that you're still writing.
 And your word says that we'll overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of our testimony.
 So Father, I just thank you for this testimony and thank you for the testimonies that are
 being written right now. Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
 That's amazing. We're excited about you going to Australia. How can people follow you,
 find out more about you and being on your journey in Australia?
 Um, I just started a blog so they can follow that.
 Alice, your Instagram names, your Twitter names, your blog.
 Take McCloud, everything.
 At Tink McCloud is Instagram and Twitter at Sam Aaron McCloud.
 And then the blog will be <a href="http://www.tinkmakloud.com/">www.tinkmakloud.com</a>.
 So there you go.
 I hope that was a blessing to you.
 We love salmon tink.
 We love you.
 Have fun in Australia.
 We've no idea where you are right now, but I would imagine you'll be
 listening to this at some point.
 And so we love you and we miss you already.
 Yeah.
 You're beautiful smiling faces.
 Yeah.
 Let's wrap this thing up.
 All right.
 If you would like to show notes for this episode, head over to Alan
 AJ.com/58 and as a birthday gift to me because it is the day of Alan.
 One of the things you could do that would be a huge blessing is head over to iTunes,
 search for keeping up with the Joneses.
 And if you could leave a review, it would help us tremendously.
 It would be a real blessing to us.
 It would help get the word out about the show and it would help us reach new listeners.
 And I actually just discovered this week that each iTunes store in each country has its own reviews.
 So the reviews in Canada, for example, won't be seen by listeners in America and vice versa.
 So no matter which country you're in, we'd really appreciate your feedback and go to iTunes.
 Search for Keeping Up With The Joneses and leave us a review that would be amazing.
 Thank you so much.
 Have a great week.
 Bye.
