<p> Well, good evening, mr. Jones evening hot stuff
 Here we are again here we are once again
 I just said that<br/>
 Well, I'll just giggle into the mic in ainley
 How was your week?<br/>
 It was a great week. We had visitors in town, which makes you very happy doesn't it you little people person?
 It does well<br/>
 There's some of our best friends from Toronto so it was just nice is nice to get
 time with somebody who's known me for, I don't know, a hundred years?
 Well, 15 at least, probably.<br/>
 Well, you're missing somebody because we've had lots of visitors.
 Well, not lots of visitors.<br/>
 We have.<br/>
 We've had our dear friend Gabby staying with us from Australia for two weeks.
 It's true.<br/>
 We didn't know her at all.<br/>
 She was completely unknown.<br/>
 We got a phone call from our dear friends Gary and Sarah Morgan, who we do know very well.
 And they called and said, "Hey, we have a friend Gabby coming to Nashville.
 Could she stay at your house for two weeks?"
</p><ul>
  <li>She was amazing.
  </li><li>She was, our kids absolutely fell in love with her,
 as did we.
  </li><li>That's true.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's like she's part of our family in an instant.
  </li><li>Gabby, for listening, we love you and we miss you.
  </li><li>We love you.
  </li><li>But no sooner did she leave,
 literally she left on Tuesday at four o'clock.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 I was at the airport with Gabby dropping her off.
 Well, Ben and Sarah were arriving here
 and you were helping them.
  </li><li>That's right, I got home just as they arrived.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Talk about Sarah Jackson.
 Sarah Jackson is an amazing woman.
 She's an incredible friend, a remarkable teacher,
 just really wise, really, really fun,
 just great to laugh with.
 And she's just a solid friend, she's amazing.
  </li><li>You've known her for like 15 years, talk about that.
  </li><li>Yeah, she came over from Bath, England,
 to do the School of Ministry in Toronto.
 It's gotta be longer than that.
  </li><li>Where we met.
 where we met. Subsequent years later.
 Yes. And she ended up on staff there. And then, um, as a pastor there,
 I remember the day I met her. Everybody was intimidated by Sarah.
 She was Sarah Dally back then. Yeah.
 And so she was this gloriously competent woman. Oh, and she's stunning.
 Oh, she's absolutely beautiful. Yeah. And so everybody,
 special, the guys were super intimidated by her. Yeah.
 And then Ben came along and then we were years later,
 he came as a student and we taught in his school.
 and he got into our little hearts somehow.
  </li><li>And we really wanted them to get together.
  </li><li>We totally wanted them to get together.
 But for some odd reason,
 we didn't,
 well, it sounded like we didn't encourage it,
 we just didn't make it happen.
  </li><li>Well, we couldn't, you can't really make it happen.
  </li><li>Oh, people try out with it.
  </li><li>But we could have been more involved than we were.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>But,
 God's much better at matchmaking than we were.
  </li><li>He's so good.
  </li><li>And they're now married and happy.
  </li><li>He's so good.
  </li><li>And we have a beautiful little baby girl called River.
  </li><li>Yeah, River.
  </li><li>So they've been with us for the past couple of days.
 -The great thing about them is they're absolute foodies.
 -Yes.
 -When they come, we eat really, really, really well.
 -Because we all enjoy food and different foods.
 I made that Korean Thai noodle bowl again tonight.
 -It wasn't Thai, but it was Korean.
 -Oh, I'm sorry.
 The Korean beef noodle bowl.
 -Yes.
 -It was superb.
 -Yes.
 That's from my favorite cookbook at the moment.
 -You know the other thing, Sarah comes and teaches on our school often
 and teaches on dream interpretation.
 She absolutely carries in a 19 for it because when she, when I'm around her, my dream life goes up.
 Yeah.
 And both of them carry like a real healing in 19.
 So I was getting right this week.
 They're both remarkable individuals.
 So it was fun.
 Always fun having friends in town.
 Mm hmm.
 We've also got new youth pastors at Grey Center.
 We do.
 Yeah.
 Which we're super excited about.
 We launched.
 We launched them.
 They were in the launch of the church.
 We launched the launch of the church.
 Last Sunday.
 They're very stage tomorrow.
 Yeah.
 Brett and Shaley were out left.
 breads of former NFL quarterback.
 Yep.
 So me and him have got a lot in common.
 We're both athletic, both.
 Yes.
 Pro athletes.
 And I've kind of amended to him in the physical department, really.
 Okay.
 And now they're both, I remember meeting them for the first day.
 They both did our school and they both came back and staffed our school.
 Yep.
 And now they're going to be our youth pastors and we're so excited.
 Everybody has spoken to all the parents, all the kids.
 It's amazing.
 Yeah.
 Everybody's still.
 All the staff super excited. So, Brian Shelly, welcome to Grace Center. We're super excited to have you.
 Working alongside us. You guys are just going to be amazing.
 It also means we're no longer pastoring the youth.
 Which we were doing temporarily, which we thoroughly enjoyed.
 Yeah.
 With some amazing youth.
 Yeah, really, really awesome youth.
 Absolutely loved it.
 I had somebody email me this week, Joe Turner from Glasgow and Scotland.
 She'd listened to the Jesse Early,
 ooze and hours from the, I think the time we taught her the presence of God, it's been listened
 to over 500 times. That's so. I'll ask her a little weeks and download it. I don't know how many
 times, but she asked a question which many of you may be asking, which is, I love listening to it,
 but how do I download it? If you check this week's show notes, we'll give you a link to where you
 can actually download it. So you can have your own copy to listen to Rong having streamed directly
 from the internet. These are the things I don't have to worry about being married to a techno geek
 like yourself. You're welcome. Thank you. We also had our friends in Mozambique streaming.
 Just tickle some pink that they find Wi-Fi. And then one of the first things you do is
 they download Jesse early singing over you, which I would do if I was stuck in Mozambique.
 I would want Jesse singing over me, which would be amazing. Hey, I wanted to talk this week,
 which I hope is interesting, but we get asked this question a lot. So hopefully it is interesting,
 But we asked a question that kind of sounds like, how do you guys do what you do?
 How do you do life?
 How do you be parents?
 How do you work?
 How do you work together?
 How do you run your life?
 How do you have people staying at your house?
 I thought we talked about that.
 Okay.
 Probably worth at the front end saying, we're not even sure if we're doing it well.
 Yeah.
 But we're not, we're not coming here as experts like, well, let me tell you, we've got this
 I think we're constantly looking at ways of optimizing and improving.
 I think probably the first thing is we both like our life.
 Yep.
 That's good.
 And I think I think looking at our kids who are doing okay, so something must be okay.
 I think there's definitely areas we could do a lot better in, but we're doing our best.
 It's probably also worth mentioning before we start talking about this, that we're both
 High shapers, if you've never done a life language profile
 and you have $45 spare,
 look at the show notes this week.
 We'll post a link to life language profile.
 It's probably the best thing you can do with $45.
 It was basically an assessment
 which will help you understand you
 and help you understand other people.
 But if you have done life languages,
 we're both first language, high shapers.
 So shapers love a plan.
 They see the world through systems and organizations
 They tend to like a plan, like to follow a plan, like to optimize a plan.
 They go into distress as there is no plan.
 Right.
 So probably the number one way we stay afloat is having a plan.
 And it's not like we sit down and make a plan, though sometimes we do.
 Just instinctively we come up with a plan.
 And I would say, if you're listening to this, go, "Oh, I don't make plans."
 I would say, "Yeah, you absolutely do.
 Your whole life, just by the fact that you have a routine, means you have a plan and might
 know have been planned for you, but you most people tend to follow a routine in their life
 in terms of what they like and what they don't like. We've probably just been a little bit more
 deliberate of that, I think. Yeah, well, I think because that's how we both function so or
 we wouldn't function if we didn't have that. So, yeah. So how do we talk about our plan, talk about our
 approach to
 Planning routines that's that type of thing
 Well, I think a lot of what we do revolves around two different things either
 Our children and their schedule or our work schedule. So we have
 For our kids they all go to bed at seven. They all get up at seven
 You know, we all eat at 12 we eat at 5 30
 So there's, you know, we, we know what gets done at what time and like MJ goes down for his nap at 1 30,
 which is when the girls have their two hours of quiet time.
 Right.
 And mommy and daddy get headspace.
 So instantly our weakest split up into days and our days are split up into chunks.
 So our day starts at seven of the family.
 Yep.
 And then we know that there's some definitive points.
 It was going to be lunch time.
 It was going to be meal time.
 It was going to be a bedtime.
 Mm-hmm.
 then we just try and plan productivity around those areas.
 Yeah, right.
 So, and then of course, we know that we work Sunday through Thursday.
 So we, and we have definite meetings and stuff that are always the same every week.
 And then we have flex time, which is when we can do additional meetings or, you know,
 PowerPoint slides or oops, keynote slides.
 Can you skip behind the slides?
 Yeah, our week is pretty much taken care of.
 We meet with our staff Mondays and Tuesdays, and then Wednesdays pretty much taken up.
 We have a pass-ups meeting first thing.
 And then we have meetings in the afternoon that are just weekly meetings that are already
 set.
 So once Monday rolls around, our week is just spoken for and it's just a case ofIt 
 rolls on and then we're done.
 which means the rest of our life has to happen to a degree automatically or at least remove
 as much friction as possible or we're just going to be stressed.
 Yes.
 I read an article a while ago.
 I think it was in the Harvard Business Review and they'd done a whole of research about
 high-level decision-makers, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, etc.
 They realized that a lot of these successful people had outsourced a lot of simple decision-making
 Based on some earlier research, they had found that the part of your brain that makes decisions
 gets taxed really easily.
 And it doesn't actually matter whether you're making a difficult decision or an easy decision.
 So these guys have just sorted out all the easy decisions.
 So Steve Jobs famously only wore Levi's and a black turtleneck and new balances.
 So you never had to think about what to wear.
 Another example might be that these people would always have a dry cleaning picked up
 and dropped off.
 had to think about, you know, always doing laundry or eat at the same restaurants.
 And they know what they eat at those restaurants.
 Right.
 So they don't.
 Which is quite funny because we're very like that.
 Yeah.
 I know like I usually have two things off of any menu that I will order from any restaurant
 and that way I don't have to think.
 Yeah.
 So we I am a bit of an enigma but a lot of the time I don't care about the decisions
 I'm making because I'm saving my decision making energy for the decisions I know I'm
 going to have to make.
 For each of us, we probably start the day looking at what's before us.
 Wednesday is a day where we make lots of decisions.
 Yeah.
 And so, you know, we know where we're going to eat.
 We don't have to think about what we're eating.
 And if I run out of decision-making, I just don't care.
 Just give me the easiest option and the fastest option.
 The other thing that we try and do is we try and eradicate friction.
 Friction comes in the simplest of forms.
 You know, if you have a routine, anything that gets in the way that routine is friction.
 So for example, trying to leave the house, everybody leaves the house, that's a routine.
 You don't know where your car keys are, that's stressful.
 Yeah.
 You don't know where your wall is, if the car's not filled with gas, etc, etc, etc.
 Right.
 So we've worked very hard.
 Which incidentally I filled up this week for $3.04.
 Thank you.
 That was amazing.
 You drive to Canada or how does you get us $3?
 Kroger points.
 Okay.
 Yeah, very excited.
 Very proud of you.
 Sorry.
 Go ahead.
 None was fine.
 So we worked quite hard at eradicating friction.
 So what I realized is I do a lot of tasks and you do a lot of tasks that repeat.
 So we've just invested in automating those things.
 Here's a really simple thing.
 I go into the garage, maybe three or four times a day, our garage at home.
 That's where our recycling's kept.
 Oh, at least.
 Yeah.
 Where our garbage is kept.
 All of our like stored food.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 So every time I opened the door previously, I'd have to turn on the light.
 Now you're thinking, Oh, well, what a huge task.
 But if you're carrying a whole of the boxes, recycling, or two garbage bags, you don't have a spare hand.
 So we just put in an automatic light center.
 So whenever you open the door, the light turns on.
 And I think 30 seconds after there's no activity, it turns itself off.
 Just that one little thing saves me three or four times a day friction, which builds up.
 I see and I always wave in front of it to make it come on.
 I know just walk in because spiders.
 Well, I just trust it.
 I just walk in.
 But that's a really, really simple example.
 Another example would be we calendar our life
 like nobody's business.
 So our assistant, Charlene God bless her,
 has access to three of our calendars,
 or probably more of those.
 You have a calendar, I have a calendar.
  </li><li>We have a shared calendar.
  </li><li>We have a shared calendar.
  </li><li>A joint calendar, Alan Age's appointments.
  </li><li>Babysitter calendar.
  </li><li>And then yeah, we also have a calendar for Babysing.
 We have a calendar for visitors.
 And we have a calendar for things
 need to be done around the house. So I don't have to use brain power to remember to change
 the air conditioning filters or to remember to clean out our humidifier or to remember
 to clean the coffee filter. It just reminds me and I just, it's budgeted in our time and
 set apart for that. What was the grace invention in the last year is Amazon? What's it called?
 Prime or no? Subscribe and save. Talk about subscribe and save.
 Well, if you sign up for, I think it's five different items that can be shipped to your
 house a month, you get 20% off of all of those items.
 Plus free shipping.
 Plus free shipping.
 So, I mean, I always know I'm going to need diapers.
 I always know I'm going to need wipes.
 We go through some regular foods that we go through like canned tomatoes, canned organic
 tomatoes, or whatever.
 So there's just things that I need shipped every month, like pamels, flour and stuff.
 And Mac and cheese.
 It comes.
 Tyler paper, kitchen paper.
 And the great thing with that is since we started doing that, which again is automated,
 requires a little bit of effort up front.
 But after that, we've never run out of Tyler paper.
 We've never run out of kitchen paper.
 It's great too for the kids lunches.
 when school is in session, all of their,
 like the chocolate almond milk, the juice boxes,
 you can find almost anything organic
 that you can find at a store, and it all comes in.
 So I already have all the little things
 that go in their lunch boxes, and it's as cheap or cheaper
 than going out and getting it myself
 and having to think about it.
  </li><li>Right, the other thing we do is,
 we notice that stuff shipped monthly,
 we have stuff shipped quarterly on a schedule.
 So I have our air conditioning filters, you know, the filters for the furnace shipped.
 And so when they arrive, I know it's time to change them.
 Because they ship every three months.
 You know, once they arrive, I just kind of swap them out.
 So little things like that.
 So we're probably working hard to find every area that we can automate.
 Something simple, like we meet with our staff the same time every week.
 That just helps my brain get into a routine.
 If it's not on the calendar, it really doesn't happen.
 Ben Jackson, who was with us this week, gave us a genius idea, which I'm not sure why
 we hadn't done this before.
 And then Sarah share a list in their reminders on their iPhone called grocery.
 So when either one of them is at the grocery, they check it and either of them can add to
 it.
 I was like, why have you not thought of that?
 Oh, that is so clever.
 I made one for you.
 I know I said thank you to the inviter.
 Yes, I will, or whatever I said to it.
 I love that you thanked.
 Thank you, Siri.
 Thank you, Siri.
 I haven't actually looked at it yet, but that sounds great.
 Here's what I'm excited about.
 Apple announced the iOS 8.
 This is me not breaking the non-disclosure agreement
 that I signed.
 But in iOS 8, they've got this thing called HomeKit,
 which integrates your phone with all home automation stuff.
 So for example, at the end of night,
 you could just say, Siri, I'm going to bed.
 And that would just set off a chain of events
 like you'll lock your front door, turn off your lights,
 power down your TV.
 So Siri comes to my house and locks my front door or I need some sort of special lock.
 You need some special lock.
 I mean, right now we already have something like that.
 Our lights are a stereo system.
 Again, that's simple because prior to that, you know, you're lying in bed going, "Oh,
 I turn off this, I turn off that."
 Well, now it's all automated.
 You know, one of the most helpful books I read, which is a very famous book that lots
 of people have read, "Getting Things Done" by David Allen.
 If you're somebody who struggles with completing tasks, David Allen's book is really, really
 good for setting up a system.
 Don't be frightened of systems.
 Like I said, you already have a system.
 If you think you don't have a system, you have one.
 You're like, "Oh, I can never get anything done."
 Well, then you have a system that prevents you from getting anything done.
 Just change the system.
 If you're like, "Oh, I'm always late."
 Then you have a system that ensures you're always late.
 You could just change the system to ensure you're always on time.
 But getting things done by David Allen, again, I'll put a link in our show notes.
 Any other top tips or hacks that you use, babe?
 I guess I have little things that make things easier.
 When I'm cooking, I have those little frozen herbs.
 That is a genius thing.
 I love those.
 So, I love fresh herbs.
 If I have time, today I cut all fresh herbs.
 So that's fine.
 It was my day off.
 But if I'm coming home from work and I'm trying to make something and we try and eat as healthy as
 humanly possible, but I wanted to have flavor, then I have all these little frozen cubes. I can't
 remember who makes them. We can put it in the show notes as well. But I get them at, oh, foods,
 but also trying to think of Kroger has them. But anyway, they're a little frozen basil or parsley
 or garlic or ginger or whatever. And they've been like flash frozen, so they taste like fresh herbs.
 So it's awesome.
 Yeah, little things like that.
 Um, we're in a routine of, when I stay with my sister,
 Caris, and she lives in North Carolina, when we were there,
 it was kind of eye opening there.
 They've got two kids.
 He's an executive for AT&amp;T.
 She's, uh, she works in marketing so they both work.
 They both have kids.
 We kind of came away amazed at like how well they run their house
 and how well they run their kids.
 And what I realized is we're pretty good at automating
 our professional life, but as Emily who's ever stayed in our house notices, we're not
 so good at automating the tidiness of our house, but watching them, I was like, wow,
 these guys have a system that works.
 And so whenever she's cooking, he's cleaning behind her or vice versa.
 So we started doing that and that's really, really helped.
 Well, listen, if you have ideas on our things that are actually proven and working for you,
 Please let us know. We would love some insight on this. We would love.
 Did you say proven?
 Is that not how you say it?
 Proven.
 Proven proven. This is one of those North American.
 I don't know. I was just amused.
 I think proven.
 Proven proven.
 If you have an opinion on proven or proven, please let us know.
 Yep.
 But as it is now sat in and I see here's the thing we had people staying.
 we did, which we absolutely love. But our system had to adjust. So we normally record
 these podcasts Thursday night. But now it's Saturday night and we get up in about six hours,
 six hours to go to church. So we're going to call a night and a week. But if you'd like
 to reach us, shoot us an email or send us a tweet or go to alanaj.com/ask and leave us
 a question. Yeah, ask us a question or tell us something you'd like to hear about or something
 And it's always fun to answer those things.
 Or give us your life improvement hints.
 And we'll include them in next week's podcast.
 Or tell us if it's proven or proven.
 I mean, we need you to know.
 All right.
 Nine-night.
 Or if it's the middle of the day when you're listening to this.
 Oh, good day.
 Enjoy the rest of your day.
 Good morning.
