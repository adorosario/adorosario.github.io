<p> I live in a j's podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is a j Jones.
 Yes, sir. Merry Christmas.<br/>
 Thanks. How the heck are you?<br/>
 Just don't know me that this episode will be released on Christmas Eve.
 It will. That's nice.<br/>
 It's our Christmas gift to the world. Yes.
 No receipt is included. We're sorry.<br/>
 No, no changes.<br/>
 Give it back.<br/>
 Welcome to keeping up with the Jones's.
 The last episode of 2018, episode 211, this week, we're talking about giving before we get into the meat of that episode,
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Tell me how your week was.<br/>
 It was a great week.<br/>
 We had David Campbell stayed with us for about four or five days, didn't he?
 He did.<br/>
 David was our guest last week on the podcast.
 If you missed out, put a link in the show now.
 He's just got a glorious accent and a glorious personality.
 He's one of the most laid-back people ever.
 He was so easy to host.<br/>
 Basically, as long as we had coffee, he was fine.
 That's a pretty good summary.<br/>
 He did drink more coffee than I've ever seen an individual drink ever.
 It was astonishing how much caffeine that man could consume.
 And still go to sleep.<br/>
 And yeah, he said caffeine doesn't bother him at all.
 Apparently, because he could have about 10 cups of coffee and still be fine.
 He, I don't know if it was jet lag or the Holy Spirit or coffee, but he didn't
 get home till what like one o'clock he was ministering at emanate till at least 1230
 I think twenty to one was when he finished praying for the last person then he got home
 around one ish to our house we ended up not going to bed till about twenty past one yeah
 and then got up the next day and taught and he taught all day Monday Minister till one
 o'clock in the morning and then got up and ministered again yeah and he was fine totally
 fine. Yay, I guess coffee. And Holy Spirit, I think. I think probably Holy Spirit more
 than coffee, but anyway, yes. Yeah, he came home buzzing. Anyway, joy to have David and
 absolute joy. I love hosting people. Yeah, it was really fun. And you taught this week.
 The thing is, because we know vacation doesn't feel like it was a week ago, does it? Well,
 yeah, not even a week. Doesn't feel like at the start of this week, I was teaching on
 honor. Yeah. It feels like it was weeks and weeks ago, because we taught Monday, Tuesday,
 And then we are off, baby.<br/>
 We've been off since Tuesday.<br/>
 We went to church this morning.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yes.
  </li><li>But apart from that, it's been full on pajama mode.
  </li><li>Um, it has.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I tried to put pants on this morning
 and I honestly had to pause to stop and think,
 wait, how do these, what are you doing?
 'Cause I've just been in pajamas.
  </li><li>How do I wear your pants?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And again, I should say trousers for our British audience.
 Let's do think I've been under wear list all day.
  </li><li>Yes, that would be a good clarification to put in there.
  </li><li>Yeah, you're welcome.
 So you have been playing Mario and Rabbids.
  </li><li>I think the name is Mario and Rabbids.
 I'm not completely sure of it.
 It was on sale, I think Black Friday,
 and I texted Mr. Will, who is my source
 to all things Nintendo, and said,
 do you think I'd like this game?
 And he said, yeah, I think you would.
 And it's kind of a turn-based strategy game.
 It's like a really violent game of chess.
 So you've got this board, and you place your characters,
 and then they attack the other characters,
 and then it's the other characters turn to tech you and and so on paper it sounded really tedious and slow and not my cup of tea
 But oh my gosh, I've raced through I've loved it
 I've absolutely loved it and now I'm going back and playing all the harder levels to complete it 100%
 Of course you are, but it's thoroughly enjoyable
 I think because it's all set in the world of Mario which I have a deep
 Emotional connection to from my early not I'm gonna say my childhood, but really my late teens early 20s
 It's it's just joyful absolute joyful
 Amazing.
 And it's fueled by David did bring how many pounds of chocolate?
 Oh my gosh.
 I don't even know.
 Like the biggest chocolate bars I've ever seen.
 Yeah, seven metric tons of chocolate.
 So I've been being diligent working through those.
 Yes.
 And the only exercise I've had is shipping books.
 I think I've only had two small pieces out of all of that chocolate.
 Are you saying it's gone?
 I'm saying that's your lack of discipline
 that's not prioritized British chocolate.
 Okay but are you saying it's gone it's not gone it's still where is it.
 It's hidden around the house.
 Where are you just after you see if you can find how i've done no Chris all i've done some christmas shopping
 this all been online i've noticed you've been furiously moving around in fairness you don't usually do the christmas shopping.
 Well, I resemble that statement.
 But in two days, I get to figure out what you've been up to.
 Christmas present wise.
 Yeah, I've punched holes in the box. Hopefully it'll survive for another two days.
 I know. I saw it moving very concerning.
 Yeah, Andy, clue what I've got you for Christmas?
 I don't.
 You don't? That's because I asked the Lord to turn off your prophetic gift in that area.
 Did you?
 I did. Yeah.
 Yeah, but Lord, please don't. I just want this to be a surprise for okay. Well, it's working. No, no, no, no, no, would you like some hints? Yes.
 You're not getting any.
 That's cruel. It's it's only like it's not even it's like a day and a bit away. You can give me one hint.
 Okay, some assembly is required.
 Okay. Okay. That's not a great.
 I didn't say it's going to be a gray hint. Okay.
 Your Christmas present to me, which you bought is currently stuck at customs.
 Yes, well, that's because it's a live llama is being delayed.
 Yes, but I'm so excited. Oh my gosh, I'm so excited.
 I can't wait. Very exciting.
 Anything else about this week we need to talk about?
 Well, the Christmas service this morning was very cute, wasn't it?
 Very, very cute. All these tiny kids doing readings, a couple of them were like just their
 Their chins were at the podium.
 That was very sweet.
 Very sweet.
 Yeah, we basically did a tag team of readings and carols and then got out of their pronto.
 We did.
 And we were done like an hour early.
 Yes.
 Well, like 45 minutes early.
 What time did you finish the first service?
 Well, that's probably true.
 We finished at 9.45 for the first service.
 And then we finished at 10 minutes after 12 or 6 minutes after 12 for the second service.
 The disadvantage of that is then you're fighting with all the Baptists and stuff for restaurants
 because normally we get out late enough that we're not affected by the church rush.
 Anyway, it worked out well today.
 Just to eat with the Baptists, don't it?
 It'll be fine.
 There you go.
 Hey, also, what about that thing that MJ told you in the car?
 You were driving a church today.
 My name is my own business.
 I'm driving with MJ and MJ says to me, "Empathy is when you feel what other people feel."
 I was like, I beg your pardon.
 He's like empathy is when you feel what other people feel.
 I said, are you saying empathy?
 He said, yeah, he said, like, if my friends crying, it makes me want to start crying.
 That's empathy.
 I'm like, you're just the most adorable six year old.
 I was so cute.
 Where did you say he learned that?
 He said he learned it in school in life skills class.
 I never got taught life skills.
 No, I never got taught about empathy.
 I'm like, OK, kindergarten.
 You're already learning about MTV.
 That's awesome.
 Well done.
 Flute nature of the heart.
 There you go.
 Our main topic this week is all about giving.
 It is.
 We didn't plan it for Christmas.
 No.
 We've been doing this 10-week series called Back to Basics.
 These are like we whittle down what we think every Christian should know.
 We start with the Bible and talk about the Holy Spirit and hearing God's voice,
 the Father's love, forgiveness, church, inner healing, healing,
 authority and we're in the ungiving, we basically thought, this is what we think every Christian
 should know about. Yes, like the 10 things we think, hey, if you were to only listen to us talk
 about 10 things, this is what we want you to take away. Right. And I've had fun doing it. I hope
 listeners, you've been encouraged by it. And giving, it's funny because we were at Christmas time,
 but we weren't, believe me, we are not that clever to line up topics with timing. But here we are,
 Yeah, we're talking about giving.
 Where do you want to start, baby?
  </li><li>Well, I guess my first thought is that giving, of course,
 is just an outward expression of an inward heart posture
 of generosity.
 So it's out working of something that's already happening
 in your heart, hopefully.
  </li><li>Yeah, I remember John saying, John Ona, our pastor,
 spiritual father from Toronto,
 who said, "All of the kingdom is built on generosity."
 Like he started with God's heart,
 for God still loved the world that he gave
 his only begotten son.
 the whosoever should believe in them will not perish but have eternal life.
 Ultimate generosity.
 Complete generosity.
 And then of course, Jesus is generosity and laying down his life.
 No one takes my life from me.
 I give it freely.
 I mean, so we love being on the receiving end of generosity.
 Yes, but part of the work of the Holy Spirit is to fashion us into Christ like this.
 Yeah.
 So we leave our old way of thinking and we become just like Jesus.
 And we're most like God when we're generous, when we're when we're giving.
 Right. So to give you an example, uh, you know, we've had many times where we have been out for
 lunch somewhere and someone has just mysteriously paid for our lunch or paid for our dinner or
 something like that. Right. And so, and we, and we've done that a few times. We just, you know,
 when the Holy Spirit's like, Hey, look over there, do you know, pay for that? You know, so it's just
 fun. Like it's just super fun. It absolutely is. And, uh, so today we were out for lunch and
 actually walked by this family that we know and you know they were having food and whatever
 and immediately I was like oh my gosh we could totally pay for the lunch and you know
 just bless them and you know they're just we know them to be a blessing to everybody
 around them you know kind of thing so it was just fun to know that we could actually kind
 of you know get them back which is probably the wrong way of putting it but you know what
 I mean like let me ask you this I haven't been on the receiving end of having people
 buy our meals and then getting to buy the people's meals. Which one do you find great
 joy in doing?
 It's more fun to buy their meals. Isn't that funny?
 Yeah.
 I mean, it's awesome when people buy your meals, but there's something like just, I love the
 just getting to sort of bless someone when they don't expect it and they don't even have
 to respond to you. You know, you can just love them in that way.
 It's Jehovah's Sneaky at work.
 Yeah, it was very fun.
 That little sneakiness that you feel when you're about to do it.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Generosity does not come naturally to our old way of living.
 Yes.
 Like the old man, the unredeemed state, we don't want to be generous.
 Like, I found before Jesus talking about generosity, I just wanted to keep everything
 to myself.
 And we'll talk about whether that is in a second.
 But because it's one of the Holy Spirit's passion to fashion us into the likeness of
 Jesus, God's given us some pretty good instructions to become like him, especially in the areas
 of generosity.
 Yeah.
 giving without first talking about tithing, even though tithing isn't giving.
 Right.
 So, give me a description of what tithing is.
 So, tithing is this universal principle of returning 10% of all that you have back to
 God.
 Why do you say it's a universal principle?
 Most people who repose the tithing sits in Old Testament covenant.
 Why do you say it's a universal principle?
 Because it's in the New Testament as well.
 I think people want to just think it isn't so they don't actually have to pay attention
 do it. It also predates the law. So when people are like, oh, that's, you know, that's the law.
 I'm like, no, I actually appeared hundreds of years before the law. That's right.
 So that's why, you know, we think of it as a, this universal principle. And so it's, yeah,
 it's 10% of your increase. And so your increase is your salary, it's raises and bonuses. It's any
 gifts that you get given. Just, you know, anything that is given into you in cash form, basically.
 Yeah, that causes an increase. I tweeted this out earlier this week. I don't know why I was thinking of it, but I'm thinking that the tithing, when you tithe, you're neither being generous nor are you giving.
 Right.
 Like you're not generous when you tithe, you're merely obedient.
 Right.
 You don't, you also don't give a tithe to God. You're merely returning it. So you can't give what isn't yours. So if tithing is neither generosity,
 Nor is it giving.
 Then you might ask, well, what is it?
 I found tithing to be this brilliant discipline
 that stretches your mind and keeps your heart supple
 in order to give with a heart of generosity,
 not give with a reluctant closed fist.
 Yeah. Or live your whole life under fear
 because you think there's never going to be enough.
 Right.
 I mean, tithing deals with so much...
 Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>It's such a brilliant invention.
 I'm about to use an analogy that is purely theoretical.
 Tithing is like going to the gym for your heart.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So if you think about the people that you know
 in our lives who regularly go to the gym,
 who regularly work out, they are more flexible.
 I mean, physically, they're more flexible.
 They tend to have more energy.
 And what's funny is the payoff that they get
 isn't found doing the workout, the payout comes after. The workout is when they're tired,
 you know, they go to the gym, they work out, their muscles are sore.
 Yeah, it costs them something.
 Right. But the lifestyle of working out regularly yields to greater benefits that you find later
 on in life. Yes.
 Tieding's like that. It's not fun writing checks for 10% of everything that you have.
 But what happens is it keeps anything that would rob generosity away.
 Yes. That's really good, babe. I like it.
 Oh, thanks. I'm actually planning a four week, three week. I can't remember.
 Three, I think.
 Is it three week series at the end of January in 2019? I'm going to be teaching on this whole topic.
 So I've been praying with the Holy Spirit and been talking and been dialoguing.
 So I've got, I've just been rummaging around my head and just dialogue with the Holy Spirit.
 So some of the stuff is popping up. Talk to me about the biggest obstacle to generosity and
 Well, I think the enemy of generosity is actually just the spirit and the mindset of
 Mammon.
 Ooh, we're talking about demonic mindsets and demonic spirits.
 Talk to Mammon.
 How does Mammon operate?
 Well, I think Mammon says that they will never be enough.
 Oh, it's that.
 It almost seems reasonable, doesn't it?
 Yes.
 I mean, it just comes to you and just talks you at the side of your head.
 Yeah.
 Mammon seems logical.
 Mammon seems like he's giving you good advice.
 But actually, Mammon is just another voice of fear.
 Oh yeah.
 You know, it's distrust of God and just thinking, "Oh gosh, there really is never going to
 be enough."
 That's what I love about Tithing.
 Tithing constantly draws this line in the sound that says to everybody listening, spiritual,
 you know, invisible and visible, "I can't be bought and I will not be scared off by
 lack."
 Yeah, I'm with him.
 Right, yeah.
 Tithing reminds us that everything we have comes from God.
 So if we return back to God, what's already his, he can always give us more.
 Tithing, actually, it's funny.
 Tithing demonstrates that we have confidence will never be in lack.
 Yeah.
 Whereas, Mammon constantly reminds us we always will be.
 Okay.
 So, babe, the question is we're talking about tithing, but if tithing has nothing to do with
 generosity, why are we talking about it?
 Well, that's a great question.
 Tithing is our bedrock and mammon kept at bay
 Giving then becomes something that we can practice right and you only get generous by actually giving you will never be a theoretically
 generous person
 Right, it's the by generosity is the byproduct of consistent giving
 Largy speaking we will not give if we're not already tithing if we are not tithing
 We are in idolatry to mammon and mammon says you can't you can't tithe you can't give
 So I've never met a generous giver who wasn't previously a generous either. Yeah, I've heard people say and I remember even thinking this like well
 I'll get generous when I have a lot of money and actually no you won't right
 You know if you don't actually learn to put God first when you have little
 You're not gonna learn to put him first when you have much. It's just gonna get swept away
 I think it was Bill Johnson said when you have little sacrifices easy
 Generosity is hard. Yes
 And when you have a lot, generosity is easy, but sacrifice is hard.
 Yeah.
 The whole thing is you learn both in a biblical principle where you are faithful in the small
 things before you're faithful and the big.
 Yeah.
 So like we have some friends who, this is just brilliant.
 They, they said, they called me one day and they just said, we've been praying and we were
 talking on a night of dinner.
 Wouldn't it be amazing to be able to pay off somebody's mortgage?
 And we're just thinking about, we can't wait till we get to the point in our lives
 where we're so financially full that we can pay off somebody's mortgage.
 And they said, we were talking about that.
 And then the Holy Spirit challenged us going, love your heart,
 but you could actually practice that now.
 And they're like, how could we pay off somebody's mortgage?
 And the Holy Spirit was like, oh, you can't pay off somebody's mortgage right now,
 but you could pay somebody's mortgage for a month.
 And so they called us to say, hey, we're thinking of this couple in the
 church.
 Could you find out how much their mortgage is?
 We'd like to pay their mortgage for a month.
 Right.
 And I was like, I love that.
 That's amazing.
 So in where you want to go.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 We found that there's two types of giving.
 There's one you can give out of your overflow, which is one of the reasons God will give
 you an abundance.
 And then there's giving sacrificially.
 Yeah.
 Right?
 So are we call it tithing giving and giving when it hurts?
 Right.
 The difference between giving and giving when it hurts is usually, I think if you've been
 practicing a discipline of giving, that comes easy.
 The giving that hurts is usually initiated by the Holy Spirit.
 It's like, hey, why don't you do this thing you never think of?
 Like give away a car, give away a house or something extravagant.
 You're like, oh, that's going to hurt.
 Yeah.
 The thing that the two types of giving have in common is what you were touching
 on earlier about lunch.
 Jesus said, or Paul said that Jesus said in Acts 20 verse 35, that it's more
 blessed to give than to receive.
 And the funny thing about that verse, like every verse in the Bible,
 is you will never find out the truth of that verse if you don't first give.
 All right, so I have a question. Can I give if I don't tithe?
 So that again, can you give if you don't tithe?
 You know, I know people that are like, "Well, I give and I'm generous, but I don't tithe."
 Is that giving?
 I mean, I think you can give if you don't tithe, but I don't suggest it.
 Yeah.
 Because tithing protects your money.
 If you're not tithing, then I guarantee that devourer is at work in your life.
 So you'll never have enough to give if you don't tithe.
 Right.
 Right.
 So that's one of the tricks of the enemy that he uses to keep you from tithing.
 You think, how can I like, I can barely make ends meet as it is.
 Why would I make things worse by only living on 90%?
 Right.
 Like, I don't even have the 10% to give to the Lord.
 And I mean, my response to that was, well, you're right and you're wrong.
 You don't have the 10% because the devourer is in play.
 Mm-hmm.
 But the Lord rebukes the devourer when you commit to a lifestyle of tithing.
 So actually the problem is not that you don't have enough.
 The problem is that you've unleashed devourer.
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Oh wow.
 Okay.
 Good.
 So if you actually start tithing, then he blesses your 90% and you will find, we've
 found, this is a true statement that 90% of your money blessed by God goes further than
 100% of your money cursed by famine.
 Way further.
 It does just not make sense.
 It's crazy.
 It's a crazy math.
 Right, we've talked about this before. In fact, we've embarrassingly talked about in public.
 And we keep a little chart, we keep a spreadsheet of everything we give
 dated and everything we receive. And we do that because we like to wage war on a poverty mindset.
 Well, we have a chart of everything we give above the tithe.
 Oh, yes. Let me clarify that. Yeah. Our tithe is a no-brainer. Like, we don't even think of
 money that is ours to disperse pre-ties, like that just does not even factor in our consideration.
 Right.
 In fact, we just loved it the other day our kids got given some money for Christmas and
 our kids, I mean, we didn't tell them, but our kids just said, okay, so we just got
 given a hundred bucks, okay, so 10 bucks to the time.
 That means I have 90 bucks to spend.
 They just like straight off the bat, they were just like, I don't have $100 to spend.
 I have $90 to spend.
 Yeah.
 I was like, kids.
 That's awesome.
 We're getting it because again, they see how we live.
 And it's crazy math.
 The point with telling the story about the spreadsheet
 is at the end of every month and at the end of every year,
 we can see what we gave, we can see what we received,
 and we're just like, Lord, this math does not add up.
 Like, how do you make it happen?
 But it's the Kingdom principles.
 What were we talking about?
 Oh, yeah, Tithing, you were asking, can you give?
 Yeah, our advice, tithe first, give second, and then given it will be given to you kicks in.
 Yeah. Talk to me about that, Vorsk, because you helped me with that.
 Well, I think that verse is about more than just tithing. So that's out of Luke 6,
 and it's verse 38, you know, give and it will be given to you. Good measure,
 press down, shake it together, running over. That's not just talking about tithing, that's
 talking about everything, you know? So give friendship and it would be given to you. Give
 joy and it would be given to you. You know, like whatever the thing is that you're giving,
 it would be given to you. And then it's, but it's over in abundance. You know, it's not just a
 return of what you gave, but it's pressed down and shaken together and then it's still running over.
 So I that's talking about a lifestyle of generosity. Then in everything that you do,
 it's marked by you are because of how generous your father is.
 You are generous to others with everything that you have,
 whether it's time, whether it's resources,
 whether it's emotional capacity, whatever it is.
  </li><li>I remember hearing you teach that verse and you were talking
 and you said, "Give and it will be given to you."
 And then you asked the question, "What is it?"
 And I was like, "I haven't been paying attention.
 I don't know what is the yet."
 And you were like, "It is whatever you give."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like if you give money,
 Money will be given to you.
 We give your time, time will be returned to you.
 And I remember we went through a season
 where we would give things
 and watch as those things got multiplied back to us.
  </li><li>Yeah, I remember like back in the day
 when I first started learning to tithe
 when I was, you know, whatever, 1920 in there.
 And, you know, I'm tithing, but I had no extra.
 But I remember I wanted to give, but I had no extra.
 And so I would just find people and babysit for free
 or do something where I could sow time
 'cause I had time, I didn't have money.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But it was still giving 'cause it,
 like it saved that person the money they would have paid
 for babysitting or whatever.
 And even then realizing, "Wow, Lord,
 you're doing something, you're shifting something."
  </li><li>Yeah, I think you're right.
 I think the amount that you give
 in one sense doesn't have anything to do with dollars.
 I mean, it does, of course.
 But God counts the motive of the heart as well as dollars.
 There's this beautiful passage in Luke 21
 where Jesus is watching the Singlet of Temple
 and he's watching people come in
 and give money into the offering.
 And he sees all these people, wealthy people come in,
 they give large amounts of money.
 And then he sees this widow come in
 and she gives like two mites.
 And he turns into disciples and he says,
 I tell you that she gave more than everyone else
 because she gave all she had.
 Everyone else gave out their abundance.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Currency, dollars, pounds, euros, whatever,
 comes and goes, but heart and faithfulness
 is something you can always give.
 Like you can always sow honor.
 You can always sow forgiveness.
 You can always sow mercy.
 You can always sow good attitude.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I think it was Graham Cook who once said,
 remember him saying, "You know,
 "there's a couple of things I never lack
 because I'm always sewing them.
 And I was like, I really like that.
 And I started pricing that to the point where I'd say, I would say, tell me if you
 think this is me being truthful, two things that we do not lack is encouragement
 and prophetic direction because we're always sewing encouragement and we're
 always sewing prophetic direction.
 Tell us we're always I agree prophesying to other people.
 And so it's just not a lack in our life because we're always, we're always giving
 it.
 And because the Lord is good, it always returns to us.
 Yeah, I totally agree. I think, I mean, before I really got this and before I thought generosity
 was an exciting thing, I think I would have been like, oh, I don't like that very much.
 That's going to require something of me. Yeah, it requires personal responsibility.
 Yeah. Yeah. But I love it now.
 But here's the thing, like we've told so many scary testimonies over the years, like scary
 good, like, like, are you kidding me, Lord? Like, how did you, how did we end up with this?
 And there's Chris Voutin that I once heard say everybody wants the testimony, nobody wants the test.
 Yes.
 Seriously, if you have not read the book The Bless Life by Robert Morris, it's not too late to get this for Christmas.
 If you haven't read The Bless Life by Robert Morris, it is one of the most encouraging and challenging books I have ever read in my life.
 Like every time I read it, I just want to give away everything I have.
 It's so, it's like so empowering and so challenging, but the, I think part of the reason that we're
 fanatics about this is since we've been married, we have given what we've had and received what
 we could never have afforded. Yeah, absolutely. Like we give what's in our hand and I'm constantly
 amazed at how the Lord is, I mean, it's somewhat embarrassing. Yeah. I mean, we shouldn't be
 embarrassed about it, but let me change that word. It's not embarrassing. It's somewhat breathtaking.
 We were just like, Lord, you are astonishing in your never-ending goodness. And I just want to
 encourage everybody else to be people who are tithers, who are givers, and are people who are
 comfortable giving when it hurts, because he's always good. Yeah, he's great. I'm not going to
 apologize for anything I've said, but somehow I feel like whenever I talk about giving, it never
 feels light and frothy always feels like I'm doing warfare. Just even talking about it.
 Do you feel like that?
 Um, maybe a little bit. I think, I think because I realized there's so much life on the other side
 of really understanding it and getting it. I kind of, this is probably not the right way
 of putting it, but I kind of don't care. You know, because I remember my initial reactions to things
 like tithing and giving and stuff like that. And I remember all the fear and then thinking,
 "What's your motivation for talking about this?" And going through all of that process.
 But on the other side of actually grasping it and understanding it and then walking in it and
 realizing the freedom that it brings, I would rather kind of offend with a small O and have people
 shift, have them have a shift in their lifestyle that brings freedom. And then we can sort out the
 the small O later. Does it make sense?
 It does. I was thinking about that verse that the Lord loves a cheerful giver.
 Yeah. For me personally, I didn't become a cheerful giver until afterwards, I was a faithful
 giver. Yeah.
 Like there's nothing cheerful about me giving it was I was an obedient giver.
 And then that led to cheerfulness.
 Yeah. Like I'm glad one of us reigns the other one in because it does get a little bit
 crazy.
 Like we're like, I want to do this.
 The other one was like,
 -Okay. -Let's both hear that.
 -I hope that's encouraging, wouldn't you?
 I don't know when your listening to this episode.
 If you're listening to it on Christmas Eve,
 we're just praying you have the most glorious Christmas ever.
 We're praying for you to have an amazing new year.
 And I want to encourage you for 2019 as you start off 2019,
 consider, like my mom taught me this as a little boy,
 count your blessings, name them one by one.
 I've been nothing but encouraged by charting our giving and our receiving.
 Like it has mathematically proved to me what is already right in the Bible, but it's just
 a constant encouragement.
 And even when we felt like the Lord has asked us to give, when, you know, we take a deep
 breath, but when we look at the, we look at His faithfulness in the past, it encourages
 us to give in the future.
 Absolutely.
 And even actually at the end of every year, we sit down with the kids because at the beginning
 of the year, we usually write a list.
 What kinds of things would you like to see happen this year?
 Sometimes on their list are things that they'd like to have and sometimes it's just experiences
 they'd like to have or things they'd like to see shift or whatever.
 Every year after Christmas we'll sit down at some point and go through that list and
 just be thankful for all the things that God did.
 One of the things Dave Campbell taught us really, he said, "Your kids will grow up because
 Because you're in ministry, your kids will grow up seeing the cost of ministry, the toll
 of ministry that will take on you and the toll that will take on families.
 And you're doing your best to mitigate that, but there is a cost of being in ministry.
 Yeah.
 And he said, if they only ever see the cost, there's a danger that they become embittered
 at the church.
 Right.
 You have to teach them to see the blessing of being in ministry as well.
 So that's one of the things we do when we talk about tithing, when the kids ask us about
 money when we're given things, we tell them like, this is because of God. This is an outworking
 of our faithfulness to God that He is faithful to us to teach them that they're not going
 to live in lack because Mommy and Daddy decided to give our lives to Jesus. That's not the
 kingdom.
 Right. And I do think that. I mean, I think there has been in the past, certainly the
 mindset of, and maybe there still is, you know, if you're in ministry, just expect to basically,
 you know, eat on Tuesdays and Thursdays and, you know, maybe every other Saturday or what,
 you know, I don't know, I'm joking, but you understand what I'm saying?
 Oh, yeah.
 And yeah, so we're just trying to be real intentional with the kids that actually you don't ever lose
 out by following God.
 Right. The righteous will never go hungry.
 Yeah.
 All right. I have a question for you.
 Yes.
 Hide into this very topic.
 This is from Melissa and she asks this my question for the both of you is tithing related.
 I've been following the 50/30/20 budgeting rule. That's where 50% of your income goes towards
 essential expenses, 30% towards lifestyle and 20% towards saving. I'm curious to know where
 tithing best fits into this. Would it go into one of the categories or would you start budgeting
 from income that has already had the tithe taken out? I'd love hearing any input you guys would have.
 I that's fairly easy for me. I would say
 You take the 10% off the top and then you divide what remains with your 50 30 20 rule
 So just take the 10% off the top first and then now with the 100% that you have left
 Divide it up the way that you're you're doing your budget. Yeah, let me ask you another question
 Do you tie pre-tax or do you tie post-tax like do you tie them the gross or do you tie them the net?
 Well, we tithe on the gross because taxes and stuff is something that you also give out
 of, right?
 Right?
 But it doesn't, you know, what we actually received before taxes is what we have received.
 So we give 10% on the gross before anything comes up before any taxes come up.
 I remember I think it was John was once asked that do you tithe on the grosser on the net
 And he said, well, do you want to be blessed on the growth or do you want to be blessed on the net?
 Oh, that's a good question.
 But yeah, like we said, AJ and I are salary, everything that comes in,
 we don't even consider spending 100% of it. We just, we automatically tie. That's just a
 foregone conclusion. It's not even a discussion point. So hopefully that helps you Melissa.
 Well, to wrap up, we pray that you have a glorious and wonderful Christmas and a wonderful new year.
 And we're going to actually be taking some downtime with our family.
 So we will be back in your ears on Monday, the 21st of January, 2019.
