<p> I live in a days podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one ninety six of keeping up with the jones is where this week we're talking about the love sewing and reaping before we jump into that.
 Yes, before we do that we talk about this week yes because I love this week it was such a great week I think weeks where you have long holiday weekends.
 Are a wonderful thing they do more often yes let's do the more and the next one's on July no really yeah july for the couple weeks away i don't know do math but will go there.
 I like for we had a wonderful week we were in atlanta at the start of this week we were oh yeah remember we though you heard the podcast last week with the mighty quin we recorded that like a week and half ago yes.
 We were with our friends Peter and Masha who are pastors and leaders down in a rise life church in
 Atlanta. We had a blast with them. Yeah, it was such a great church and the church,
 just the people of the church were so fun. Oh, I love being with them. Yeah. You spoke
 morning and night on the fallahart and made everyone cry. Well, you know, which is a good job.
 I am sponsored by Kleenex. Yeah. And then the next day we had Memorial Day in Atlanta.
 And so we hung out with Peter and Masha and their daughter.
 We went to is it Ponce City Market?<br/>
 Is that what it's called?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Are you sure that's what it's called?<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Ponce or Ponce.<br/>
 It's beautiful.<br/>
 Yes, it's lovely.<br/>
 We've been number four, just a great eatery.
 And we got to see our friends.<br/>
 Five dollars bakery.<br/>
 They're preopening.<br/>
 Yes, because they opened in Atlanta this weekend, but we got a
 it was like the soft open, wasn't it?<br/>
 It was amazing.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 We also incredible Indian food.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 I was surprised, actually, how good it was.
 Out to the best Indian food I've had in America.
 I would too, actually.<br/>
 It was very good in the pond's market.
 Yeah, too bad we have to drive to Atlanta for amazing Indian food.
 Well, now we have friends there that we can stay with because we stayed with this wonderful family.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Michael and Terry.<br/>
 Thank you for your help.<br/>
 They hosted us so well.<br/>
 So we had a great time.<br/>
 Great.<br/>
 And then on the way home, we got to stop at the, what's the aquarium called?
 The Georgia.<br/>
 Georgia, Maryam.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 which honestly aside from the dolphins the Chattanooga Aquarium is way more impressive.
 Yeah, I think I agree.<br/>
 But they had dolphins.<br/>
 They had dolphins.<br/>
 They had a live dolphin show.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 1800 people in a big kind of like amphitheater with a gigantic tank at the front of 30 foot
 deep water tank with like, I don't know, I lost count six dolphins.
 I know, I think there was more than six dolphins.
 That's why I lost count.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 The coolest thing out of all of those 1800 people, a lady walked up to Abigail, our 11 year old,
 and said, "Hey Abigail, would you like to come and be part of the show?"
 And so we had to sign away a waiver that she could swim.
 And if she got eaten by dolphin, who wouldn't suit that?
 Because dolphins are known reading children.
 They look pretty vicious.<br/>
 Oh, they're all smiles on the front and giggles.
 Uh-huh.<br/>
 You're just waiting.<br/>
 You look at them the wrong way.<br/>
 Me, you.<br/>
 So Abigail got to be part of the show, and she got to touch a dolphin.
 I thought you were going to get to swim with dolphin.
 So I was a little less impressed, but nevertheless, it was very cool.
 I'm pretty sure it takes training to swim with dolphins.
 You just hang on to that fan at the back and it does all the work for you.
 Yes.<br/>
 Or you stand on his nose like those guys did.
 That's exactly what we want her doing at her swim level.
 Imagine if you could commute to work via dolphin.
 Like if you lived in Venice, for example, that would just be awesome.
 I mean, yes.<br/>
 I digress.<br/>
 It was.
</p><ul>
  <li>Fairly.
 (laughs)
 Yeah, it was really fun.
 She was super stoked and she was like,
 "Take a video, I need to send it to all my friends."
 I think she only has like two friends in her phone,
 but they all got a video.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>I put on Instagram stories 'cause it was so awesome.
  </li><li>It was awesome.
  </li><li>I loved it.
 And then we drove home and avoided the tropical storm
 that was coming up from the Gulf.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And actually, this is the first time
 that we've driven home at night.
  </li><li>Are you a fan?
 I didn't mind it.
 Like the kids fell asleep and it was so nice and quiet.
  </li><li>It's the first time I've been in Atlanta
 and there was no traffic.
  </li><li>Yeah, well Memorial Day.
  </li><li>Right, but it was a beautiful thing to behold.
 Tuesday we had a day at home,
 recovering with the day off, which was just great.
 Wednesday we went into work
 and then Thursday and Friday we also had days off.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>But I haven't really been days off
 because you're getting ready to go to Australia.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>What's happening in Australia?
 I am going to speak at the School of Prophets
 and then speak at a conference called Speak
 with Gary and Sarah.
  </li><li>Yeah, you're gonna have an awesome fun hour.
 Dear friends, Gary and Sarah Morgan,
 we'll put a link in the show notes to the times
 that they've been on the podcast,
 fascinating people, amazing stories.
 But you're gonna go hang out with them
 and they're gorgeous kids
 and catch up on the little pocket of Nashville
 that is currently tucked away in Melbourne.
  </li><li>Yes.
 As some of our people have,
 Are they have they migrated there?
 Is that the right way of putting it?
 Yeah.
 They have relocated there for a period of time
 and we miss them.
 So we'll get to see Tink and Sam and Faith.
 And yeah, that'll be good.
 And then you haven't seen much of me the last couple of days
 for why?
 Because you have been a boss.
 I like when you say that.
 I need a t-shirt that says I am the boss.
 I am the boss.
 Because you've been getting the Finding Father videos ready.
 Which isn't much of an achievement given we had a goal
 to have them released last summer.
 Yes, but part of your goal setting,
 your father didn't die in that scenario probably.
 So we might have to give you a little bit of grace.
 Oh, that's right.
 Yeah, I forgot about that.
 I mean, not that I forgot that he died.
 I forgot that that was the end.
 There was a reason that everything got pushed back.
 It's not like me to miss a deadline.
 And so I think as amusing, we missed it by a year.
 Yes.
 But your whole point was, babe,
 you've been working on them steadily
 with a little bit of push.
 You basically said, hey, babe,
 If I looked after the kids for the next four days, could you finish the videos because
 I'd love to take them with me to Australia?
 Yes.
 A little bit of trivia.
 Yes.
 The first time finding father, your book was published.
 In fact, the very first time they came from the publishers, we never even saw a printed
 copy, but they landed in Melbourne, Australia.
 They did?
 For a leader's school.
 We were doing a conference with John and Carol.
 Yeah.
 And we got word from the publishers, "Hey, your books are printed.
 would you like us to deliver them?" And we were like, "Could you do Australia?" And they were like,
 "Sure." So the very first books off the press landed in Melbourne, Australia. And that was the
 first country to receive copies. So I'm thinking, how cool is it that the very first country
 that the Finding Father videos are going to be available are Australia again?
 Yep, in Melbourne again.
 So our Australian listeners, if you see AJ, the finding father videos will be available for purchase.
 You're actually only going to have 40 copies of them with you.
 No, not even.
 You're only going to have 20 copies of them.
 I was going to say, how did I get 40 copies?
 You didn't.
 Yeah.
 You have 20 copies of these.
 The rest of the world, although the videos are edited, they're not available for sale yet,
 because there's a ton more work for me to figure out on the delivery end of things.
  </li><li>What does that mean? - Well, they're high definition
 videos and there's 12 of them. And so that's at least 12 hours of high-depth video. They're
 really big files. So I'm trying to work out, do I want to distribute them over the internet?
 Is that fun? Unless you have a super fast internet connection, people could be downloading
 them for forever. Like you're taking the conference on thumb drive. People can buy them on USB
 thumb drives. But still, they're on 64 gig thumb drives. That's a lot of data for people
 to pull over. So I'm trying to work out the best way to distribute them online. I've got
 smaller people than me to talk to this week. So yes, they're done. No, they're not available
 for sale yet unless you're in Australia next week, in which case they are.
 But hopefully super soon because everything's actually done. We're just trying to figure
 out how to deliver them. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I mean, we could sell them on thumb drives,
 but if I was going to buy something that's digital, I'd want it now. We don't have to
 wait two days until USPS delivers it.
 Everybody though isn't quite as impatient as you are, Dirling.
 Impatient is our kind of word you could use in need of speed.
 Imagine you want to watch something on Netflix.
 You're like, Oh, I'd love to watch that.
 And you're like, congratulations, your DVD will be with you in three.
 No, you've one press play and play it right there in that.
 I got you.
 But most people that are going to do a Bible study are not needing to do it right
 the second they actually buy it.
 They plan it.
 They're going to get together with their friends, that kind of thing.
 So they might have a two-day lead way.
 I'm just saying I could be persuaded.
 Yeah.
 But my goal is to win, win.
 OK.
 Well, maybe we can do both.
 Maybe we can make it downloadable and have it on drives for those that would
 prefer.
 And that's exactly what I'm working on.
 You're amazing.
 Thanks.
 You've done a great job.
 Oh, you're so kind.
 So you spoke this morning.
 How was that?
 That was a lot of fun.
 I so enjoy speaking to our church, our church families.
 I remember when I started because, you know, we've been here 10 years and
 predominantly all of our focus was our young adults.
 So it's not like we were looking for other reasons to speak.
 We would speak every week on a Monday night and then when the school started and
 I don't know, five years ago, I remember when Jeff would go on vacation,
 he'd be like, can one of you speak?
 And I didn't, it's not that I didn't enjoy it.
 It was just you understand, Hey, that's an audience that doesn't know you.
 like an emanate, I feel so at home at the school after the first couple of weeks, I feel so home.
 People know me, they understand my sense of humor, they trust me, they go with me.
 And I've really enjoyed speaking at our church because I feel like I've gotten to know our church family from the front.
 I know that might sound weird unless you're a public speaker, that might not make much sense, but I had tremendous fun.
 It was so good this morning, babe.
 You're very kind, babe.
 No, but really it was.
 I would tell you if it wasn't too.
 that's true. As you know. Yeah. But I appreciate that. Yeah. And poor Jeff, our senior pastor,
 he called me last night, he put his back out and was like, bro, I don't want to do this to you,
 but is there any way you could speak tomorrow morning? And thankfully, just the way the Lord
 works, I'd already had a message prepared for next Sunday when I'm scheduled to speak. So I thought,
 well, I'll just move that up a week. And that gives me a week to prepare a new message.
 Does that mean next week you're going to just speak on like maybe interpretive dance or
 Who knows? I've got a busy teaching schedule coming up because I'm speaking
 of emanate. Because I'm not here to help with anything. You're not your
 spouse emanate. You're swan enough to the other side of the world. Swining
 off. Sipping margaritas. What kind of a noise does this one make? Probably not that one.
 So many concerns. So many concerns. Our main topic this week is all about the law of sewing
 and reaping. Now, eagle-eared listeners will be like, "Hey, wait a minute, Jones, as you already
 talked about this in episode 85, and you would be correct we have." But when I was praying this
 week about, "What should we do our podcast on?" I felt like the Holy Spirit said, "Talk about
 song and reaping." And I was like, "Lord, haven't we done that already?" And I looked up and right
 enough we had. But I would say there's a couple of revelations in our life that have made us who we
 Yes.
 The revelation of the Father's love.
 Yes.
 No brainer.
 Right.
 The importance of inner healing.
 Yes.
 The value of forgiveness.
 Absolutely.
 But right up there in the top five things that our life is built upon, like core values
 would be a revelation of the law of sewing and reaping.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 And I thought, oh, I, I, I'm inspired to revisit that.
 All right, let's do it.
 Well the concept, it's funny.
 It's a universal concept.
 Christians or perhaps biblically illiterate people would recognize it as what goes around comes around
 right or karma yeah right but actually the concept is found all the way through scripture yes but
 it's talked about in one verse in particular yeah so that's Galatians chapter 6 verse 7 it says
 do not be deceived God cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows whoever sows to please their
 flesh from the flesh will reap destruction, whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the
 Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper
 time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up. Therefore, as we have opportunity,
 let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.
 Right. So that's that verse in context. The main verse is, "Do not be deceived. God cannot be
 mocked. A man reaps what he sows." Right. But Paul introduces the concept and then gives an
 example, which Paul does all the time. He goes specific and then an example, specific and an
 example. And so he's, I think it's fascinating that he starts with a warning, "Do not be deceived."
 Right. But that's because we're always deceived about stuff, isn't it?
 right we always think i know better that doesn't really apply to me or i but seriously i've met so
 many people who overlook this warning and i think what paul frank says guys if you understood how
 vital this was the law of so and reaping you would pay attention to what you're sewing so you can
 pay attention to what you're reaping i mean that that whole thing of do not be deceived is so
 important because many people overlook that warning and they think that what paul says next or what
 what we're talking about on the podcast tonight doesn't apply to them.
 Right.
 And I want to say that we've lived a life that proves this verse true over and over and over
 again.
 Right.
 Let me be as simple as I possibly can.
 You planted a garden last week.
 I did.
 All my plants are in.
 You literally dug up all of the soil, put in fresh soil.
 Yep.
 Thank you, Bill.
 And then you planted new gardens.
 What did you sow?
 I have planted a bunch of different tomato plants.
  </li><li>Okay, so you have sown tomato plants.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>What are you expecting to harvest
 from those tomato plants?
  </li><li>Tomatoes.
  </li><li>You're not expecting corn?
  </li><li>I'm really not, no.
  </li><li>Potatoes.
  </li><li>If corn or potatoes comes from those plants,
 I will be very concerned.
  </li><li>Right, but in the natural,
 you're not having to drill up your face,
 you're not having to chant anything.
 You're not confused.
 You know that you've planted those.
  </li><li>And so they're going to give me the fruit
 of what I planted.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>What else did you plant?
 Just out of interest.
  </li><li>I planted okra.
  </li><li>Really?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I thought we'd try it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Green, red, and yellow peppers.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Two different kinds of jalapeno peppers.
 Zucchini, eggplant, and cucumber.
  </li><li>So you have sown all of those seeds.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you are fully expecting to reap all of that harvest.
  </li><li>I am.
  </li><li>Now, it could be that something comes in
 interrupts that cycle, but generally speaking, you are expecting whatever you've sewn, you're
 going to reap accordingly. Absolutely. And it's honestly that simple. There's literally
 nothing more that we can say, but people don't believe that whole thing. As it is in the
 natural, so is in the spiritual. Absolutely. So in the natural, like not talking about
 plants, but stuff you can sow in your life. If you sow kindness towards people, then kindness
 will be shown to you. You're going to reap kindness from all different places.
 Right, but conversely, if you speak about people behind their back, you will reap people speaking
 about you behind your back. Right. So, so dishonor and reap dishonor.
 If you treat people with respect, you will be shown respect.
 Yeah. If you're gossip, then you're going to find yourself gossiped about.
 It's not that hard.
 And actually, you can kind of flip that whole thing
 on its head, can't you?
 And you can look at, oh, what am I reaping?
 Because I bet what you're reaping shows you what you're sewing.
 I know, it's kind of harsh, but it's maybe a good insight.
  </li><li>But it also tells you what you can kickstart in your life.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like if there is a lack of good things in your life,
 start sewing those good things.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, one of the things we try
 and encourage people all the time,
 People who are lonely go so friendship, go be a friend to somebody with nothing in return.
 Yes.
 And you will find that you will flourish in friendships.
 If you're lacking direction, go so prophetic words, go give some, you know, pray for other people's direction and you'll find that direction will come to you.
 Yeah.
 The difficulty when you start teaching like this is I can already hear a criticism of, oh, it sounds like you're trying to game a system or milk the system.
 And I'm like, it is a principle.
 It's a universal principle.
 Of course you can leverage for the good of your own life,
 but I think that's part of the reason
 that Paul is illustrating it.
 One is a warning to save you from turmoil and conflict,
 which you may well have started by yourself
 as in if you sow a critical spirit,
 you reap a critical spirit.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But also that you can kickstart blessing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Peace is this in verse eight.
 You read it already.
 Whoever so's to please their flesh from the flesh will reap destruction.
 There's a true reverse.
 Whoever so's to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life.
 So Paul's basically saying, if you sow only to please your flesh, and by that,
 he means your sinful nature, you reap destruction.
 And again, people think, but that's where I'd point you to the warning.
 Do not be deceived.
 Yeah.
 God cannot be mocked.
 man reaps what he sows. And then he goes on and says, if you sow to please the spirit from the
 spirit, you reap eternal life. Now, clearly, Paul is talking about the message of salvation.
 Right. Right. If you sin, if you please your own flesh, you reap death. Scripture is really clear,
 the wages of sin is death. But if you sow to the spirit, you receive Jesus and you get eternal life.
 So to be sure, that's what he's talking about. But that's one extreme. But the very point he's
 making works all the way back to present day life. For example, if you want to grow in holiness,
 say no to the flesh and yes, the Holy Spirit. Right. If you want to be closer to God, so your time
 to God. Yeah. Well, isn't it in James, it says, "drawn near to God and God will draw near to you."
 Right. It's astonishing. Yeah. Everything you want in the kingdom is on the other side
 a simple obedience. If you want to be closer to God, so your time to God. I think time is one of
 the amazing currencies of intimacy with the Lord. Yeah. It's so funny because I think sometimes we
 write off so much of life to circumstance and actually so much of it is simple choice.
 It's the choices that we've made and we may not have made them today. Maybe we made them last week
 or a couple months ago or a couple of years ago, but eventually you will reap what you sow.
 I mean people often after I finish teaching on say for example blessing or
 Tithing or or the law of sewing reaping is that appears to money as it relates to money
 I mean people who say you know the law of sewing reaping doesn't work for me and
 I I have great sympathy for those people
 But at the back of my head I know they're wrong because I know that they can't have disproved scripture
 Right, but I'm an obviously don't lead with that. I say well, why do you say that? What do you mean by that?
 And usually they say well, I've sewn but I haven't reaped and
 It's not very encouraging what I say next. I mean it's really encouraging what I say next
 But it's not really what typically people want to hear right
 But what I want to tell them is then you're actually in a good place
 And they kind of tilt their head at me and say look what do you mean?
 Because Paul says in Galatians 6 verse 9 says, "Let us not become weary in doing good,
 for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up."
 And so the reason that's good news for them is the longer that you wait, the larger your
 harvest will be.
 Your harvest in the kingdom is always subject to increase.
 Sadly, that's true for both negative harvests and positive harvests.
 I think too, I'm not talking about the people that you're talking about that are tithing
 regularly and maybe haven't seen the breakthrough yet, for sure the breakthrough is coming.
 But I have had conversations with people that are like, "Well, I've given and I haven't
 received anything back."
 But what they're talking about is tipping God.
 Do you know what I mean?
 They're not actually regularly giving.
 They're throwing a bit of cash here and there and going, "Eh, it's not working."
 actually, you might be receiving the tip back. It's just not very impressive because what you gave wasn't that impressive. Does that make sense?
 Yeah, I mean, that sounds kind of horrible, but I just I
 Don't know. I don't know if that makes sense. It does in the verse that I just read Paul's writing to people who think it hasn't worked to
 Right, hence his warning. Like hey guys. Don't be deceived
 So he warns them, but he also encourages them don't become weary and doing good and I would encourage you to be listening
 don't become weary in sewing because at the proper time you're going to reap a harvest
 if you don't give up.
 I wonder sometimes if we give up and we never see the harvest that we've sown for.
 I mean, my personal conviction is the goodness of God is so good that He always sees to it
 that it comes back to us.
 It just might not be in the time or the fashion that we would like.
 Yeah, we have lots of, you know, financial testimonies or testimonies of incredible breakthrough, don't we, babe?
 Yeah.
 But, you know, those breakthroughs really stand out because of how bad it was before, right?
 Before the breakthrough.
 Before the breakthrough.
 So you're just hanging in there, you know, by the skin of your teeth and you're just giving your tithe and you're showing you're hoping for a breakthrough, but it's looking pretty grim.
 And then the breakthrough comes and you're like, wow, God, you know, so we have the testimonies.
 But we also went through the desert.
 Right.
 And the point is we didn't give up in the desert.
 Right.
 We were just like, you know what?
 Do not be deceived.
 God cannot be mocked.
 A man reaps what he so is.
 Lord, we're so.
 We just declare it.
 Yeah, we're sewing.
 We're going to reap times.
 It felt so foolish.
 Yeah.
 Sometimes it felt irresponsible because we're like, Lord, this, this makes no sense.
 And then the testimony comes and it does make sense.
 Do you remember that time we were at jail examiners and we saw someone actually that.
 I, you know, I don't actually think he was aware that he impacted my life, but he was a speaker.
 It was our very first day in Nashville, wasn't it?
 When we came, our very first visit to Gray Center, when we came to check at Gray Center.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 And we went to church.
 Yeah.
 And then we went to jail examiners for lunch.
 Was that our first, that was our first visit to that jail examiners.
 I think so.
 Yep.
 And we love that jail examiners now.
 Yep.
 It's her friend.
 Um, but anyway, we saw James Royal who had been somebody who, I mean,
 Unbeknownst to him, it was the night that he preached on Josiah that was the night that the Lord called me into ministry
 And through through his message and everything and so we saw him. We're like, oh babe
 Like let's pay for him and his wife like let's pay for the lunch
 So we just called the waiter over and said we want to pay for them. Don't tell them it's us
 We just want to bless them, right?
 And then when we go to pay
 Somebody else had paid for her bill and our bill was way more expensive than theirs. They like shared stuff
 Like 10 minutes later.
 Yeah.
 And I was like, that one of the fastest, you know,
 turn around, turn around.
 Ever seen in terms of sewing and reaping.
 But again, I try and encourage people.
 Sometimes we do reap in the same season as when we've sewed, like that example.
 And we've got many others.
 Right.
 But other times, like in the natural, you didn't, you didn't sow tomato plants
 last week and then you don't come out and you're disappointed that there's no tomatoes.
 No.
 You understand it takes seasons.
 Yes.
 And sometimes that's true too.
 Sometimes the seasons are weeks apart, sometimes they're years apart.
 Yeah.
 I was thinking about that time that we got a word from Trisha King.
 Yes.
 She came to her church.
 She gave us just an incredible, profound word.
 She gave our whole church and wasn't just us.
 Right.
 But it really stood out to me.
 I felt like the Lord was on it.
 And she gave us this word about a hundred fold return in a year.
 And so we came home and we were like, that feels like the
 word of the Lord and we would be idiots if we don't attach our faith to that word.
 Right.
 So we just at that time dreamed as big as we could and we were like, let's determine
 our sewing by desiring what we want to reap.
 So if it's a hundred fold, what would be really, really cool to see?
 Right.
 And we came up with the number $100,000.
 Right.
 So therefore, forgive me if this sounds crass, but I'm just being honest.
 This is what we just thought.
 I, we were just thinking it would be so cool to see the Lord give us $100,000.
 Right.
 I'm not, I'm not ashamed to admit that.
 That's really cool.
 Yeah, it was really cool.
 So we were like, all right.
 Well, if that word is true and my math is correct, then if we sow $1,000, we
 should reap $100,000.
 Right.
 Now, again, I don't like telling these stories because it does sound like all we care about is the return.
 And don't get me wrong, I really do care about the return when we got $100,000.
 I loved it and was praising the Lord for it.
 But when we sold that $1,000, it was in a season where $100 would have been extravagant for us.
 Yeah.
 Like it hurt bad.
 Right.
 And the only reason we had $1,000 were we had just been given $2,000, which was
 Amazing right, but we thought and we needed that $2,000. Yes, we did
 but we were like we're gonna
 Ties on that and we're gonna give and we felt like well
 That's how we were like when is another opportunity. We're ever gonna have to be able to just give a thousand dollars, right?
 right
 so we're like all right we're gonna give a thousand dollars yeah and
 We're gonna believe this word
 And we declared it didn't we wrote it up on our
 bathroom mirror and we would declare it right in the morning like we would be like okay lord we
 partner with this word i mean it wasn't just about the hundred full return there was a bunch of
 oh yeah different segments that were part of the word and we just declared those over our family
 and stuff our point is though it was it was sacrificed for us because we needed that thousand
 dollars oh dude yeah it was it was hard but we wanted to so we really we felt faith on that word
 from patricia and so we did yeah and guess what happened in a year uh absolutely nothing
 We got nothing back.
 Now, that's not true.
 It's not we didn't get anything back.
 I mean, we got lots of blessings in the immediate, but we didn't get $100,000.
 No.
 But guess what happened a few years later.
 What?
 We got $100,000.
 No, he did.
 The word was right, but the timing was wrong.
 Right.
 And I think it's good to qualify like even how we got it.
 We got it because our house increased in value by over $100,000.
 in two years. So when somebody wrote us a check for $100,000, but the Lord provided us $100,000.
 The Lord brought the increase. Totally. And our house sold in a day, is that right?
 Less than 24 hours. And we had other houses on the same street as ours that just did not sell for
 weeks and weeks and weeks after that. And once we did all the paperwork and we realized the net,
 as that was called net and the increase we were like and I felt the Lord say, hey, did you see that?
 That's a hundred thousand dollars and we're like, Lord, you are astonishing.
 So it was two years it wasn't one, but God still did it.
 I wasn't complaining.
 Nope.
 So good.
 No.
 We wouldn't be in the house right now if the Lord hadn't done that.
 Yeah.
 And we've just got so many stories of the goodness of God manifesting according to the law of sewing
 and reaping.
 Yeah.
 Okay, so here is three keys to understanding the law of sewing and reaping. Number one,
 you need to understand that it works despite temporary evidence to the contrary and make sure
 that you keep your heart from being deceived in those moments. Right, that's why where that
 warning comes from. Like they do not be deceived guys. Basically this thing works. Yeah, even when
 it hasn't come yet, you haven't seen the fruit yet. It's still a plant. It's still growing. Something
 and still happening. Yeah.
 Right. Number two, you will never reap anything that you theoretically sold.
 Right.
 So you actually have to do it.
 Well, my heart was to give.
 Well, OK.
 And it's important to know.
 I'm not just talking about money.
 The last couple of examples we used are money.
 I'm talking about everything. Right.
 Like everything like in our in our life is just is lived according to this principle,
 but you actually have to do you can't just agree with it.
 Agreeing with it is good, but you actually have to live your life according to this law.
 Yes.
 And number three is don't give up because at the right time, you're going to reap a harvest.
 Yeah, that's so true.
 It's tragic if we bale halfway through the process.
 My question to you, Babies, I said we're not just talking about money, but what can you
 sow?
 You can sow anything and everything.
 Right.
 You know, if you are finding like, I don't know,
 you want favor with businesses or whatever,
 then sew towards other people's startup businesses.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like trade skills, that kind of stuff.
 Like all of that kind of stuff is you sewing
 into someone else and you can expect
 that there's gonna be a return of people
 being, you know, sewing into you.
  </li><li>So true.
 I'm so proud of our community here at Grace Center.
 I, as a leader, when I sit back and I hear
 testimonies of our people giving away things, sewing things.
 Honestly, I'm as in awe of the testimonies of what people
 sold as I am, the testimonies of what people received.
 Yeah.
 And what I mean by that is I'm excited to hear about somebody
 giving away a laptop as I am about hearing about somebody receiving a
 laptop.
 Right.
 But I've witnessed people give cars and houses and laptops and
 iPads and of course money and vacations and just watching it or time
 Just you know people people give all kinds of things and sometimes you may think well
 I don't have any extra money like I literally don't have it to give away
 But you could give time to someone
 All of that is sewing it so I want to encourage you you can
 Change the quality of life you have by paying attention
 to what you're sewing or what you're reaping and we've talked largely about the positive side
 but also the negative side if you realize you've been sewing negative things
 Stop it because it is gonna come back to you and bite you yeah, you cannot sew
 Negative speech and expect it not to bite you. Yeah, it'll bite you just like vicious dolphins
 They're they're the worst you give them just a cross eye and you never know what's coming never know all right, baby
 Let's land this plane.
 All right.
 Because tomorrow you get on one for real.
 For reals, and I still got a finished packing.
