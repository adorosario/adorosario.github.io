<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in ages, but I'll catch more on Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 260 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Mrs. Jones, you're looking a radiant.
  </li><li>Thank you, I'm so excited about this episode.
  </li><li>Any particular reason?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Is it because you've been holding on to the story
 for about 10 months?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Let's just cut to the chase.
 We're not even gonna bother doing weekly catch-up this week.
  </li><li>No. - You've already read the title.
 You've pressed play.
 It's true we're adopting a baby.
  </li><li>We are adopting a baby.
  </li><li>We should say, I mean, I guess we are,
 but we're trying to adopt a baby.
  </li><li>We're trying to, yes, yes, yes.
 We're in the process of.
  </li><li>I don't even know where to begin with our story
 about adopting a baby.
  </li><li>Well, okay, so if we go back to before we even got married.
  </li><li>Before we even got married, yes.
  </li><li>Before we even got married,
 we had talked about, both of us had said,
 we wanted to adopt at some point.
  </li><li>Yeah, just so before we jump in all of that,
 just so the listener is aware,
 I'm imagining this is going to be a longish episode,
 it's probably gonna be at the same length as most of it.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>And we just wanna tell our story about
 how we ended up adopting a baby
 at this stage of life.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And it begins a long, long time ago.
  </li><li>A long time ago.
  </li><li>In a galaxy far, far away called--
  </li><li>A country?
  </li><li>A country far, far away.
  </li><li>But you're right, before we got married,
 before we were even engaged, I think we were talking about
 how many kids do you want, do you want kids,
 you're all, blah, blah, blah, and we were talking about that.
 And the topic of adoption came up.
  </li><li>And I said, I want to adopt, and you said, so do I.
 And I don't know why, but I remember as a teenager
 just thinking, oh, one day I wanna adopt, like, you know.
  </li><li>And I've got lots of fear about talking
 a lot of stuff out loud, I just realized,
 as I went, but also our desire to adopt a baby
 that didn't necessarily look like us.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Not that we're exclusively saying
 we don't want to adopt a Caucasian baby.
 That's not what we're saying.
  </li><li>No, no, but.
  </li><li>But a passion to have a multicultural family of our own.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I don't know, I remember you saying that
 from a very early age.
 I mean, your first friend was Japanese.
  </li><li>Yes, my first best friends were Japanese.
  </li><li>And but just also it's, I have to keep saying this.
 I'm sure wherever you're listening,
 you are in an environment that's more multicultural
 than Franklin, Tennessee.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When we got married, we lived in Toronto,
 which is legitimately one of the most multicultural
 diverse cities. - It is the most
 multicultural city in the world right now.
  </li><li>Okay, well, and that would make sense.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then we moved here and...
  </li><li>This is not, that's not, yes.
  </li><li>Not very racially diverse.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>But anyway, that was our discussion.
 Before we even got married, interestingly,
 were also both from families of four.
 I have three siblings.
 You have three siblings.
  </li><li>And we both always thought we would have four.
  </li><li>Which is so funny because as everybody out there
 who's had kids know, when you haven't had kids
 and you're talking about how many kids you want,
 it's very sweet.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But you usually refine your men.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Once you've had one.
 But regardless, we wanted it to have,
 we had always thought about adoption
 and did very little with it.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Well, I mean, we talked about it in the beginning
 and then we started having kids and then we had MJ.
 And--
  </li><li>So now we're fast forwarding.
  </li><li>We're fast forwarding.
  </li><li>So we talked about adoption before we got married.
 You're right.
 You get married.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We have three kids.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>How old were you when MJ?
  </li><li>I was 41 when I gave birth to him.
  </li><li>And it was a rough pregnancy on you physically.
  </li><li>All of them were rough to some level,
 But yeah, MJ was rough.
 Yeah, just on my spine mostly.
 And which makes sense, I was over 40 and, you know.
  </li><li>So we had wanted four children like we talked about,
 but we knew once MJ was born, we didn't know.
 We came to a realization.
 We would love to have more children,
 but there is no way that you can give birth again.
  </li><li>No, my body wasn't gonna--
  </li><li>No, it was like-- - Survive that very well.
  </li><li>You did bravo well done.
 but we can't do that anymore.
 And I remember saying, oh, well, great.
 So we get to revisit adoption.
 And even when MJ was born, we were still thinking about that.
 And then what happens, baby?
  </li><li>Well, then we just got super comfortable
 having three children.
 And then they get all out of diapers
 and you're like, oh my gosh, I made it.
 Like I--
  </li><li>Can I tell you a funny story?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So you are right.
  </li><li>Yes. - We get to stage a life where
 MJ, you're no longer potty training.
  </li><li>And when they can shower on their own,
 you feel like you've hit the jackpot.
 We realize, okay, this is great.
 Actually, you know what?
 Three's good.
 We fulfilled the Genesis commandment.
 We have multiplied ourselves.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>We don't need to bother with four.
 I mean, it's not like we ever sat down
 and had a conference and made a resolution.
  </li><li>No, we didn't know.
  </li><li>Nothing like that.
 But we just began realizing, okay,
 Hemji's done preschool.
  </li><li>We got you fixed.
  </li><li>We have a rhythm of life.
 Well, we did, yeah.
 I was just important to mention.
 Out of the realization that, yeah,
 we want more children, but we can't have you.
 My body can't do that.
  </li><li>I went and got a vasectomy,
 which is a whole other podcast episode we should do.
 But yeah, now I'm decaf.
  </li><li>I don't think anybody wants to hear
 an entire podcast episode about your vasectomy.
 I just wanna put that out there.
 It's not that interesting.
  </li><li>Do you know what, baby?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You also didn't think that lots of people
 stayed in the bathroom at the watering night
 and you were wrong about that one.
  </li><li>No, I wasn't.
 Only two people actually said that was normal.
  </li><li>No, we heard from it.
  </li><li>Anyway, back to the plan.
 We reached a stage of life where we realized,
 Man, it is really good when all of your kids
 are out of diapers.
 And you're not having to make baby food.
  </li><li>So good. - And we have a different schedule.
 And I guess, well, it's easy street for us.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's good, it's comfortable, yeah.
  </li><li>We're all in school.
 And I remember one day,
 getting rid of all of our baby stuff.
 I mean, I remember that watershed moment.
 I remember, okay, let's get rid of the crib
 and the change table and the stroller
 and the baby car seats and the baby high chair.
  </li><li>We did everything away,
 like just sewed it into other families that needed it.
  </li><li>But I remember cleaning our garage.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I remember the Holy Spirit going,
 just a little,
  </li><li>Oh really?
  </li><li>And I'm like,
 (mimics
  </li><li>Hello, I can't get the whole experience.
 Like, the whole experience is like,
 yeah, sure, you wanna get rid of all that stuff?
 And I somehow like,
 ignorantly thought, well, if I get rid of everything,
 I mean, I guess there's no possible way for us to
  </li><li>Right, I mean, just give away your crib
 and you can't possibly end up having a--
  </li><li>I remember resolving that with that folly,
 that line of thinking.
  </li><li>Okay. - All right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So we're feeling good about our life.
 Life is great. - Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, once you reach that season
 all your kids are dressed themselves and you know can they need less of your attention?
 Man, it was just great.
 So then MJ's around the age of four and I start having dreams.
 Now long time listeners of the podcast know that AJ dreams a lot.
 Big difference between AJ's dreams and my dreams are well, big difference between AJ's
 dreams and most people's dreams are most dreams that are from a lord are symbolic in nature.
 AJ doesn't really dream symbolically.
 So when AJ has dreams about major life changes,
 we tend to pay attention.
 They're fairly literal.
 Tell us some of the dreams.
 Or a high-level overview of what were the dreams about?
 All of the dreams.
 So I ended up having six dreams in a row over a period of
 about two years.
 And all of them were about adopting a baby.
 a baby. A couple of them, they were like slightly older, like two or three. But the rest were all
 you know, adopting a baby. And most of the time it was adopting a boy. But they were
 really specifically, Hey, all in my dreams, I have all the, but I'm this old and we're, you know,
 all that kind of stuff. How old are you at the time of recording? Right now. Yep. I will be
 50 next week. Okay. So hold that in. Yeah. And by the time this comes out, I'll have turned
 52 days before this comes out. So, you know, so all of my dreams are like, this seems like really
 poor timing, but we fall in love with this baby or, you know, and we and we adopt. So and you had
 had some dreams. I had a couple of dreams, which meant they were contagious. And I want
 you to tell one of your dreams in a second. Yeah. But before we go into that, like those
 two years, we've had eight dreams between us. What do we do? What I mean, what are we doing
 with those dreams? We're just praying. We're like, Okay, Lord, like it seems pretty clear
 you're speaking to us really having no idea what to do with what to do with them. And not,
 I wasn't feeling like I do this now.
 Right.
 I was feeling just the invitation of it.
 Am I right in thinking that a common theme in our dreams was we didn't do anything.
 Yes, to go get the baby.
 Yes, the baby came to us.
 Yes.
 Yeah.
 That's why I don't think I think you would wake up and go ahead and I'd be.
 And it wasn't that I was like, whatever, or like you had pizza.
 I'm like, OK, I wonder where this is leading to it.
 I would say for me, I was open.
 Like I am open. Yes. I wasn't passionately pursuing, but I'm open to the idea.
 Yes. Right. Right. So that's how I would tell me this.
 Tell one, tell one of the dreams.
 Okay. So in one of the dreams, I'm walking into the church and we are painting a
 section of the church in the dream.
 And Brett and Shaley are on vacation in the dream.
 There are youth pastors.
 And I go in, you know, I'm there for, you know, both services.
 And at the end of one of the services, I see a person that's, you know, sitting
 halfway back who's still sitting there at the end and she's crying.
 And so I go over and I just say, Hey, are you okay?
 Is there something that I can pray with you about?
 Is there something that you need?
 And in the dream, she says, well, I've just found out a family member is pregnant.
 And they are going to, you know, put up their child for adoption.
 And she's like super excited about that.
 She and she tells me the name of the baby that it's a boy and that the baby's
 name is Ariel.
 And then she says, would you like this baby?
 And I wake up and I'm like, "Well, you know, so right away I actually look up Ariel."
 And Ariel is as much as it's like the little mermaid, whatever. It's actually a boy's name.
 It's a Hebrew boy's name and it means lion of God.
 Wow, I thought man light. That means lion of God.
 It means lion of God.
 And so I was just like, "Wow, like, okay, that was really, you know, that was really intense."
 I remember you telling me the dream when I just, I chuckled maybe an eye roll in dismissive
 way, but like of course you had another dream. I'm like, put on the pile. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
 Trouble is trouble is about six months later, go to church one Sunday morning and you know,
 we're painting a hallway in the church. And I know that because I was overseeing all of that sort of
 stuff. But it smells like paint and you know, Brett and Shaley are on vacation and you know,
 go to church as normal at the end of the service, there's in fact somebody sitting, you know,
 in about the same spot as they were in the dream crying, I go over. And this person says to me,
 I've just found out that I have a family member who is pregnant and is choosing to place the child
 for adoption. And, and I'm literally like, I mean, every domino is falling into, I'm literally like,
 Oh my gosh, this is that dream.
 Well, I remember because I was at home with the kids.
 Yes. And this was first service.
 Yes. So you call me and I'm about to come in.
 Yeah. And you're like, I can tell from the way you're speaking.
 Well, I said to this person, OK, and I prayed for them.
 Because you try to be with them and care for them.
 Yeah. And but I'm literally like, I'm shaken by the dream.
 No kidding.
 You know, and now here it is, you know, so I'm like, and I know this person,
 like I have their phone number.
 So I was like, I'm gonna call you later and check on you
 and you know, whatever.
 And then I go and call you and I was like, oh, babe.
  </li><li>I remember getting a phone call from AJ
 and AJ is, you're breathless.
 You are like, okay babe, I'm in between services.
 I don't know, you're coming in
 and there isn't really a time to say this
 but I think you need to know about it now.
 And so you're telling me, like everything you just said.
 I'm like, of course this has happened.
 Like, of course this has happened.
 And you're like, what do we do?
 What do we do?
 And so we're like, you know,
 I'm trying to load the kids in the minivan and get ready,
 you know, and just, you know,
 trying to pretend everything's normal as I'm driving in.
 And I was like, let's just, let's pray.
 I think our solution would be,
 let's pray about that solution.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>Here's our way forward. - Yes.
  </li><li>Let's pray about this.
 So rather than trying to come up with a plan,
 let's have a plan and post it to the Lord
 and see what we get.
 Because I don't know if you're MCing,
 we had to go through church.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, we still had to, yeah.
  </li><li>And be pastors and be all.
 So again, I think the solution,
 I went straight to left brain.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Is it, do you know if it's a boy
 or do we know if it's a girl?
 Because for the dream to be this specific,
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Right, let's find out if it's a boy or a girl.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And, because PS, I think the birth bomb was due
 in like two weeks. - Two weeks, yes.
  </li><li>So it's like, okay, we've had all these dreams.
 and I've really given it any serious thought,
 but now this is absolutely a God event.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like you can't make this stuff up.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>In two weeks, and at this point,
 we haven't told our families.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>It's just been this kind of thing
 that the Lord has been to us about, okay?
 We haven't told our pastors.
 We haven't told our friends.
  </li><li>We haven't even told our kids, nothing.
  </li><li>We haven't told, yeah.
  </li><li>It's just been our pillow talk.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I'm now thinking, okay, here's a plan.
 Let's put out a fleece.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 boy, then I think it would be foolish if we, you know, if this
 dream is so precise, it would be foolish if we say no and miss
 this. Right. And if it's a girl, okay, Lord, then we're going to
 trust that you have another plan, which is also scary. Yes. Right.
 For a number of reasons. And so I remember saying, you know, why
 don't you tell her, Hey, we know of a family in the church, if
 it's a boy and, and again, I can't overemphasize. This is
 while I'm loading kids into many van and we're driving a church
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I remember worship that Sunday.
 I was not in worship.
 I'm like, "Shout out to the phone."
  </li><li>I was not in the game either.
  </li><li>I'm just praying in time,
 like trying to act casually.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we're texting each other.
  </li><li>And breathe, and breathe, just breathe.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>And what, we ended up doing well.
  </li><li>Well, we ended up not doing exactly that
 because I actually knew this person.
 And so I trusted them and I thought,
 I'd rather tell them it's us,
 not some random person and share with them
 the different dreams and whatnot.
  </li><li>And swear them to secrecy.
  </li><li>And swear them to secrecy, which was not a problem.
 And so they said, well, I know she's gonna find out
 if it's a boy or a girl.
 And so I was like, great, we'll wait to hear back from you.
  </li><li>Now it's gonna be Tuesday.
 And this is Sunday.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I remember that 'cause I didn't sleep Sunday night
 or Monday night.
  </li><li>Oh, neither of us slept.
  </li><li>'Cause I'm doing math and my head going,
 "If we don't this baby,
 when I'm at their high school graduation,
 I will be like 60, I'm like, I am,
 (laughing)
 I'm like, I'm now freaking out,
 like we just gave away everything.
 And we have to go.
  </li><li>A couple of years ago, we gave away everything.
  </li><li>If this happens, we have to fly to wherever it was.
 And so in two weeks time, I could be a dad
 of a newborn baby again.
 Okay, God, are you?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And in those two days, I remember we did
 like an emergency sit down with our pastors
 and whether it was closest to us that we do life with.
 Okay guys, we're gonna bring you up to speed
 on some real interesting news, real quick.
  </li><li>We also did reconnaissance at the local baby store
 because we actually didn't even know like,
 what's out there now and how expensive is what is out there now
 'cause we have nothing.
  </li><li>We're also thinking about like, how do we tell our kids?
 'Cause up until this point,
 we haven't really had any conversations with them.
 And, you know, I remember being in group therapy
 because it was Tuesday, like I would go to group on Tuesdays
 And I remember that was the topic of discussion.
 Like, hey guys, anytime today, like,
 it was like, hey guys, welcome to group and anytime.
 And just like pour it all out and process a bunch of that.
 Yeah.
 But as you can probably tell, if you know us.
 Right.
 So that mom went and had the sonogram and whatnot.
 And it was a girl and there was a family that was in state
 for them that really wanted to adopt a girl.
 And so a good Christian family and that felt great.
 And you know, so that that's what happened.
 We didn't end up adopting that baby.
 And...
  </li><li>Let me ask you though.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause those two days, 40 hours was our rollercoaster.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When we found out it was a girl,
 and we were obviously very happy that
 she was gonna go to a safe home.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What happened in your heart?
 probably equal parts relief and sadness.
  </li><li>'Cause in those two days,
 your maternal instincts had kicked in and...
  </li><li>I think so.
 I was just like, I think because for me,
 I was like, I was so sure that God was speaking to us
 about adoption.
  </li><li>Yeah, you think.
  </li><li>And because that was a closed door now,
 I was like, I don't really understand.
 Like, I don't really understand the specificness
 of the dream and the specificness of this situation
 and it not being fully exactly the same.
 and you know whatever so.
 But at the same time I was like,
 whoo, two weeks, I mean that.
  </li><li>Who, we have a full life.
  </li><li>That felt crazy, yeah.
  </li><li>Do you wanna know how I made sense of it?
  </li><li>How?
  </li><li>I was like, okay, this is an Abraham and Isaac thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the Lord provided a thicket in the,
 you know, a ram and a thicket rather.
 And I was just like, okay, I think that was a test
 of like our obedience, like moving it from theoretically,
 would you be pro's option?
 Sure I would be.
 Like now go pick up a baby in two weeks time
 and you're still sure I've been.
 I think so and the fact that God had our yes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And it didn't come out.
 I was like, oh, we passed a test.
 Like, oh, that was awesome.
  </li><li>Yeah, I did process it a little bit like that.
  </li><li>But I think I was still back to the cleaning out my garage.
 Like, oh, okay, we don't have to do it.
 We can keep our nice stable, consistent life, we're good.
  </li><li>Yeah, and in the process of this,
 the kids had picked up there was something going on.
 And so we had actually ended up talking to them,
 not about the specifics.
  </li><li>Not about this, but just about,
 hey, we have prayed about,
 thought about,
 Mummy's had some dreams about adoption.
 And Abby, who's our oldest, was like,
 that sounds great, she was in.
 But our two youngest weren't.
 They emphatically were not.
  </li><li>And emphatically were not.
  </li><li>Like no, absolutely no way.
 I do not wanna change my family.
  </li><li>We love our family of five.
 They just kept.
  </li><li>And our efforts to explore,
 not change your minds, but to explore like what's at the root of that, they were locked down.
 Lockdown.
 And I remember we both prayed, I remember one night we were in bed and we prayed and we just said,
 "Lord, we are willing, we are willing, but we don't want the blessing for one child to come at the cost
 of great pain and sorrow for three of other children." So if this is you and we think it is,
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>We're gonna ask the work on the hearts of our children
 because we want it to be a blessing for our family.
 Not just something that mommy and daddy go ahead and do
 and your feelings don't matter.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So, and then what happened immediately?
  </li><li>I stopped having dreams.
  </li><li>Which further compounded that it was all a test
 and we passed that.
 You know, like that's great.
 And so for.
  </li><li>Two years.
  </li><li>Two years, nothing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So I don't have any dreams at all for two years.
  </li><li>And our kids would periodically check.
 Well, no, they didn't usually check.
 You did. You would check about every six months and say,
 "Have you had any more adoption dreams?"
  </li><li>I remember the kids like, you know,
 I don't know if it was out of their fear.
 Like, are you guys actually gonna plan with that?
 But I remember them saying,
 "Have you had any more dreams?"
 And we say, "No, I haven't had any more dreams of adoption."
 And then they would pick up like,
 "Ah yeah, just so you're clear, I don't wanna adopt.
 "I'm not sharing my toys with anybody."
  </li><li>Right, right, right.
  </li><li>A lot of it was that, yeah.
 "Don't wanna share my toys with my parents."
  </li><li>Because we would revisit,
 they would bring up some of the comments.
 But by and large, all the dreams stopped.
 Yes, which brings us to 2021 January.
 So end of January 2021, I start a series of three dreams.
 And they're all super short and very specific.
 And so the first dream is Tia coming into our bedroom now as exactly as it is.
 And there's a spotlight on her like she's on a talk show and she has a microphone
 and she throws her hand out to the side and she says into the microphone,
 It's time for the Joneses to adopt a baby and boom, I wake up.
 And I was like, oh, oh, so I didn't even let you finish sleeping.
 I was like, Ellen.
 Cause it felt like, I mean, there was, you know, you know, when you have
 God dreams, there's such a residue.
 I was just literally like, Oh, here we go again.
 And in the natural tier was the most vocal, most adamant against that.
 We are not having a big one.
 Not adopting.
 And so I was like, well, so anyway, woke up Alan and we prayed and we're like,
 huh, interesting. You know, that was a very end of January, beginning of March,
 uh, we go away camping with the kids.
 And it's either the first or second night that we're there.
 I'm, I go to sleep and I have another very specific dream.
 All I can see in the dream is my thumbs and my phone as I'm sending a text,
 um, to Jen Johnson. And I'm just saying, Hey, Jen.
 So I've just paused for those of you know, Jen has this point adopted one or
 she got the two.
 And Brian have adopted two kids.
 Yeah.
 So you're texting them.
 Yeah.
 So I'm, I'm texting them saying, Hey, I know you've adopted.
 We've been having dreams.
 Just curious, like, what's the cost involved?
 What company did you use?
 Anything else I should know?
 Thanks, AJ.
 And then I wake up and I'm like, Oh, okay.
 Well, that time I didn't wake you up.
 I waited till you woke up.
 And then when you woke up, I turned to you and I went,
 Hey babe.
 And you're like, have you had another dream?
 And I was like, nah, so that night at the campfire,
 we're telling stories, which is what Tia likes best is when
 daddy tells the stories of getting stuck up a tree when
 grandpa came up and rescued him and all that kind of stuff.
 Yeah, this is our, this is our spring.
 It's not even spring.
 It's kind of spring break.
 Yeah, spring break.
 We're, we've ran an RV.
 We're away camping.
 Yeah.
 You know, we're around the campfire.
 Again, we are not talking.
 We're not talking about it at all.
 We're just shooting the brain in the case.
 Talking about other things.
 And all of a sudden, Tia in the midst of everything
 that's going on turns to me and says,
 "Mummy, have you had any more dreams about adoption?"
 And I stop and look over at Alan.
 We're exchanging glances like water.
 We're just blinking each other, more cold messages.
 And so then I turned back to her and I said,
 actually, darling, I have.
 And she's like, oh good,
 'cause I think we're supposed to adopt a baby.
 And MJ goes, "Me too."
 And I'm like, "Well, I mean--"
 The two of us are like, what is happening?
  </li><li>So, I look all the hairs on my body
 are standing on end, I was like, what?
  </li><li>And then Abby's like, yeah, I always wanted to adopt.
  </li><li>Which, that was true.
 And so then we had like an hour long conversation
 about the practicalities of that.
  </li><li>Yeah, we just threw open and just like, okay,
 like what, talk to me about your love of adoption.
 Like what would you love about adopting?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then we, yeah, we started talking
 about the practicalities.
 Well, you know, what would you like?
 Would you like a baby?
 you like, you know, an older sibling, like a younger sibling, like, you know, just talking
 about that.
 Do you want a boy?
 Do you want a girl?
 And at one point we say, do you want them to have the same skin color as you?
 And I remember one of them.
 I forget which one you said.
 It was to you.
 It was like, why would that matter?
 Yeah.
 Like if she said it'll be our baby.
 Yeah.
 Why would it matter what skin color they were?
 And we're like, yeah.
 Yeah.
 So we're like, okay, you know, and we're trying to act calm while we're hosting marshmallows.
 Yeah, yeah, this is totally fine.
 It's totally normal.
 So, yeah.
 With this newfound passion and zeal from our kids, we're realizing the Lord has answered
 our prayer from two years earlier.
 Yeah.
 And so this is feeling like, oh, this is actually a deal now.
 I think it was about a week later, week and a half later, I go ahead and send that text
 to Jen just exactly what I saw.
 And she sent back like pretty quick, you know, this is who we used and it cost roughly this
 amount of money and you know, she said, "Geez, go fund me."
 Blah, blah, blah.
 She said all this different stuff and she's like, "Go for it.
 It's the best thing we've ever done."
 And I was like, "Okay, wow.
 Okay.
 Feeling really real."
 You know?
 And hearing the amount of money that's involved, honestly, that shook me a bit.
 I didn't expect it to be as expensive as it is.
 And so I was like, "Wow."
 So we're still praying.
 We're still...
 Because we're praying like, okay, a lord,
 this now really seems on your agenda.
 Not just as a good idea, but as a God idea in this season.
 Like what's the timing of this?
 What do you want us to do?
 What's the timing like, we want to be wise and so keep going.
 And so, and then I end up having another dream
 about a week later.
 And in this dream, I show up at this meeting.
 So it's in a church, it's not a church I recognize,
 It's just like some big church hall kind of thing.
 And there's people there from Toronto.
 And it was, you know, like, you know,
 people I recognized there from Toronto.
 There's people there from our church
 in Franklin, Tennessee.
 And then there was several hundred people
 that I didn't recognize,
 but everybody's smiling, having fun.
 I think we're gonna have a revival meeting
 because that's the mix of people mostly that are there.
 And I turned to you in the dream
 and I was like, "Pabe!"
 Like, and I don't know what we're doing at this meeting.
 I was like, this is going to be great, you know, kind of thing.
 And, and then the, the crowd parts over to the left.
 And I see this crib with a big bow around it.
 And then the crowd parts over to the right.
 And I see like this car seat stroller thing with a bow around it.
 And I turned to Alan, I'm like, Brad, a shower.
 Like I've just gotten the information of why we're there.
 And then Amanda comes up to me and she's the head of our prophetic team in, in Franklin.
 Um, but she comes up to me and she says, uh,
 AJ, your baby is here.
 And I was like, what?
 Like, wow.
 So I like walk over.
 That's when I realized it's hour shower.
 That's the moment I didn't figure it out before then.
 And I walk over and the baby is wrapped in that.
 Uh, see through gift wrap that you put around,
 get back.
 You know that you can see through.
 And in the dream, I'm literally like, that is a horrible idea, like to wrap a
 baby in that, like in cellophane.
 Right.
 In cellophane.
 But anyway, I reach for the baby and the cellophane falls away
 and I pick up the baby and put it up against my heart.
 And then I wake up and I was like,
 oh, that whole dream was about provision.
 And I didn't catch the part at the end
 about it being gift wrapped until actually,
 I think I was talking to you later
 and I was repeating it again.
 And you said, "Babe, it's gift wrap."
 And I was like, "Oh, it's a gift."
 Because it was feeling super overwhelming to even consider again, I'm about to turn 50.
 And, you know, we have very full lives. We have very full lives, but I don't want to miss out on
 a gift that God wants to give us, you know. So anyway, I was like, okay, so at that point,
 we thought, okay, we prayed, we prayed, and then we were like kind of game on, let's,
 Let's talk to our people that we talk to
 when we make big decisions.
  </li><li>So we reached out to Jeff and Becky.
  </li><li>We reached out to Jeff and Becky,
 and we're like, "Hey, remember that conversation
 "we had two years ago about that,
 "two weeks notes to go get a baby?"
 Well, it's back.
 (laughing)
 And bring them up to speed on what's been happening.
 These are the dreams.
 Like, we're inviting you in.
 Like, how are you?
  </li><li>Tell us what you think.
  </li><li>What are the red flags?
 What are we not seeing?
 Are we just over emotional?
 What is your spirit feel as we tell you this?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we call John and Carol and share the same thing.
 And then the friends are--
  </li><li>Gary and Sarah, Ben and Sarah, yeah.
 Like so--
  </li><li>Just bring them in and share.
 And just ask for prayer, like, hey guys,
 it feels like the Lord is speaking to us
 that we don't wanna be reckless.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, we're, this is the thinking that we've done,
 this is the big decision, and it feels like God is inviting us,
 but we want wisdom, like what do you think?
 Would you pray for us?
 and they all prayed for us and just said,
 you know, we think it's great.
  </li><li>Yeah, we think it's God.
 And so.
  </li><li>But tell what like Sarah Jackson,
 who's our resident dream expert,
 not resident, she lives in Toronto.
  </li><li>When I sent her the dreams before we even talked
 on the phone, or no, I think we talked on the phone
 and then I sent her the specifics of the dream.
 And she was like, I love how shaper your dreams are.
  </li><li>Remember, shaper is a life language.
  </li><li>That life's a plan.
  </li><li>If you're fluent in the shaper language,
 you like plan and structure and yes.
 And we're both very high.
 Shapers. Both of us are very high.
 So she said, I love how shape or your dreams are.
 So she said, the first dream, by the way,
 your kids are ready, their hearts are ready.
 The second dream, this is how you're going to do it.
 Like this is who you hire, blah, blah, blah.
 And then the third dream, it's going to be provided for it.
 And by the way, it's a gift.
 And I was just like, okay.
 And at that point, I think I just settled like, yep.
 All right.
 Well, you say that.
 No, you didn't because I round about that time.
 Yes.
 You happen to be, I think I'm seeing a church.
 Are you going to church?
 Oh, that's right.
 Yes.
 No, no, that was before the third dream.
 OK.
 Yeah.
 OK.
 Well, tell us, though, because this is how I'm telling the Lord.
 This was the Sunday we got back from camping.
 So I've had the two dreams.
 We've had the conversation with T&amp;MJ.
 And we camped up until Saturday.
 I'm driving in Sunday morning to first service.
 you're going to bring in the kids for a second. And I'm driving in and I realize Jeff's car isn't
 there. So because normally he always beats us in, right? So I check my phone, sure enough,
 Jeff's not feeling well and David Wagner is going to come. David Wagner, who you know,
 been on the podcast several times. Yeah. A friend of ours, a wonderful profit. Yeah.
 David Wagner is going to come and he's going to speak that morning. And so I am literally like,
 Oh, that's amazing, you know, blah, blah, blah.
 And I'm on the front row and I'm never the kind of person,
 I'm never the kind of person that says,
 I hope I get a word, I hope I get a word.
 I mean,
  </li><li>Conversely, I am absolutely that person.
  </li><li>All right.
  </li><li>I am always asking, if there's a profit in our midst,
 kidding me?
 Lord, I want a word, I want a word, I want a word.
  </li><li>Okay, it just doesn't, I just don't typically do that.
  </li><li>But on this particular morning,
  </li><li>But on this particular morning, I was like,
 "Lord, with this whole thing,
 like this whole adoption thing going on. Like I would really love a word from David Wagner.
 Like that about this thing. Like that would help me so much, you know. And the Lord was so good
 because he was just like, oh, he already gave you a word. And I was like, oh, yeah. So think way,
 way back to first time David Wagner ever speaks. First time he prophesies over us.
 It's a year after MJ's born.
 You've already had your vasectomy,
 and we stand up to get a prophetic word,
 and David starts with,
 "O boy, oh boy, oh boy," another boy for the Joneses.
  </li><li>And arrogantly, I think,
 "Oh, you're so adorable.
 What are you missing?"
 'Cause I just said it vasectomy.
  </li><li>We're both like, "No."
  </li><li>My ability to comprehend that I can block God's will
 by giving away baby stuff or having a snip, snip.
 In hindsight, it's sheer folly.
 But I remember thinking, "Oh, I love you, David."
 Yeah, this is why we don't brops like babies. You know, I'm like, yeah, I'm all like smoggin
 You're sweetheart, right? So I had lunch with them. I don't know. Maybe a month ago. Yeah, yeah weeks
 Yeah, I said hey David
 I need to oh you're an apology and I need to tell you what's going on in our life and remember that word
 He gave us a boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. It's I told him the story
 Yeah, he got a good shot
 And what was funny is when we told the senior team like when we were telling all of the different people and asking them to pray
 Danielle who's on our senior team when we shared it with her
 She said guys all I kept hearing when you're sharing the story is oh boy
 Oh boy, oh boy another boy for the Jones's and she's like I remember when David prophesied that and
 Anyway, so we were like oh, okay, you know like all right so I got my timing wrong
 You were settled after the third I was speaking to our friends. Yeah, I was I
 was
 Not unsettled, but I just didn't know what to do. Right and all of I say journal a lot with the Lord
 Yeah, I mean I journal a lot anyway, but yeah, especially in this
 I'm journaling journaling with the Lord and I'm aware that all of my objections so like in theory. I'm in
 God I always would be
 Practically like I'm like Lord. I don't know how I'm gonna afford this not not just afford the adoption
 Right, but afford a fourth child. Yeah, you know
 I'm not even sure we've got enough to send three kids to college.
 Let them add a fourth.
 And then I realized all of my objections are practical and the Lord is so good.
 Plus I don't want to disobey the Lord.
 Right.
 So I remember generally the Lord, I'm like, and the Lord's in Alan, this is an invitation.
 This is not a you have to.
 Yeah.
 This is, would you like to?
 And I'm like, well, Lord, if I'm honest, I'm not sure I would.
 I mean, again, I love it in theory, but my life is great.
 And, you know, but I don't want to miss you.
 and yeah, you know, so there's anxiety in my heart.
 I loved what the Lord said to me.
 He said, "Alen, you live a rich life."
 And I said, "I do, Lord."
 And he said, "And rich lives are best lived shared."
 And I remember thinking, you're right.
 And I remember we, you know, we talked about it
 and with this revelation of,
 we've made bigger decisions on less revelation.
  </li><li>Yeah, like never in my life have I had nine dreams
 about the same thing and we haven't actioned it.
 Like we've made huge moves based on so much less.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I'm hearing from the Lord,
 like, hey, I'm inviting you into something.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I'm like, yeah, Lord, you are.
 And I'm, this is a really bad example.
 I'm embarrassed to say this publicly,
 but I remembered this.
 A number of years ago, two years ago, I don't remember.
 We had an invitation to take our whole family to Israel
 without any cost to us.
  </li><li>Right.
 a gift came to us and said, "We would like to send your whole family to Israel."
 Yeah. And I was like, "That's kind, but I don't really want to do that."
 Right. I guess.
 Because you definitely, and I was like, "Babe, you go."
 And I was like, "Traveling internationally with three kids, and I'm not really one of those Israel people.
 It doesn't hold a fascination for me, and I love the age you want to go, babe.
 Why don't you go and say, "That's so generous. Thank you so much."
 And then I remember, actually having a little bit of,
 I didn't feel like the Lord's rebuke, but I remember just going,
 and actually Israel's really precious to the Lord.
 And so I wonder if my heart attitude is not only ungrateful,
 but actually kind of disrespectful and dishonoring.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>It's like the Lord has made provision
 to show me something firsthand
 that is so precious to him.
 And I'm like, it's kind of an inconvenience to my life.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>And I really was like, oh, it's a long flight
 and my kids and traveling with kids.
 And I don't really like history.
 And I certainly don't like historical,
 so seriously, I think I really wanna go
 then just think, "Alm, you've been an ingrate.
 You should do it."
 You know, "Okay, fine, I'll go."
 And plus, I'm grateful.
 Like, there's an element of,
 "I'm grateful, but I don't really wanna do it."
 And so anyway, suck up, I go.
 And what do you know, I have the greatest time ever
 and I absolutely love being in Israel.
 Would love to go back.
 It was everything that everybody who'd been to Israel
 was trying to tell you.
  </li><li>Yeah, they were all right.
 It's amazing.
  </li><li>And it helped me understand that sometimes there's
 a blessing that the Lord is offering to you
 that you won't appreciate until you've said yes.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And all your math, all your back of the envelope,
 therefore it won't help you get.
 And what God's looking for is obedience,
 not necessarily agreement or understanding.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>And so I said, okay, God, I have never known you to,
 I've said that, I've preached to so many times.
 The only thing that's on the other side of obedience
 is utter satisfaction.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like the life I have now came to me
 through a series of radical obedience
 where I didn't understand what I was saying yes to.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I can trace it all the way back
 to being asked to be a school teacher,
 which I didn't wanna do,
 but because I follow Christ, I'm gonna say yes.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And it's produced rewards that weren't calculable for me.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I said, Lord, I think this is what you're asking.
 Great, so now I'm like on board,
 but we still don't really know what to do,
 But Jen's message, so we call this company
 and we now get the hard data.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I just want to be really vulnerable here
 and really, I don't know if this is a man thing,
 so men, women, if you listen to this
 and you understand it great, men, I don't know.
 But the entire life that we've been married,
 we've not the entire life.
 The entire time we've been here, the last 13 years,
 we've been working Dave Ramsey's plan
 to get out of debt, to get it financially.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 To become financially prudent and wise.
 And so around the season,
 not only have we paid off all of our debt,
 not only do we have our baby emergency savings fund,
 but we also have a well-stocked savings fund.
 For the first time in our adult married life,
 we've not only paid off all of our debt,
 but we have-- - Yeah, I mean not our house,
 but not everything else.
  </li><li>But we have got money put aside
 that were we to lose our job,
 we would be able to financially be okay
 for three or four months.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And this is new.
 And I'm like, not proud of it,
 but I'm like happy.
 I'm like, Lord, like,
 not only have you blessed us to get out of debt,
 but now we're on the pathway to financial security.
 And I'm listening on this phone call
 about how much adoption is gonna cost
 and I'm realizing, oh, for me to say yes to you,
 this is not just like a mental heart thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Everything I've just saved is buh, buh, buh, buh, bye.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 You know, to get us even started on this pathway, I'm going to have to empty out our savings.
 Yes.
 So now I'm like, okay, Lord, like we're saying yes.
 This is like a pathway forward.
 I'm not sure it is.
 And but I remember we made a decision, right?
 Yes.
 In the morning, we're going to sign on and we're going to start this process.
 Yeah.
 And we're going to trust God.
 And we're, we're going to start the process by bringing our seed into this plan.
 Yes.
 And so it.
 Yeah.
 That and I have a dream.
 Yes.
 And in the dream, it's a new season of life.
 And AJ and I are in our house and we have friends over.
 And AJ is holding a baby boy in a diaper and he has red hair.
 I remember that he has red hair.
 And I, you know, clearly we've adopted a baby boy in this dream.
 And I remember just as part of life, I go over and the baby reaches for me
 and I hold the baby close to me and in the dream, everything in my heart settles.
 Now, before I went to bed, I'd cognitively decided,
 this is a path we're going to take.
 I'm on board with it.
 When I woke up that morning, my heart aligned with you,
 aligned and it moved from obedience, but it was an act of passion and excitement
 for what this would bring.
 Yes.
 The whole thing is moved from decision to desire.
 Yeah.
 I want to tell you one of the dream.
 OK, have maybe a couple of weeks after that.
 So we've already made the decision.
 Yes.
 We've reached out.
 We've reached, you know,
  </li><li>Started the process. - Started the process.
 And I have a dream, and in the dream,
 we're all staying with Chris and Kathy Valleton,
 our whole family. - Yes, okay.
  </li><li>And a little bit of insight into my dreams.
 Anytime Chris appears in my dreams,
 it is always to rebuke me.
 Like every dream I've ever had with Chris Valleton,
 as a prophet, he comes and he brings correction.
 So I don't really enjoy dreams with Chris Valleton.
  </li><li>Yeah, like right away you're on edge, right?
 In this dream, he was so kind to our family.
 Like he put us up for a whole week
 and he was kind and engaging with all the kids.
 You know, he was fun, he was super sweet to be with
 and Kathy, he was also super domesticated.
 He would iron all his own pants
 and I was helping him do laundry.
 Anyway, he said to me, as I met his house,
 he said, you know, Alan, most of the people who stay with us
 a major event in their life happens posting with us.
 And I say, well, it's funny, Chris,
 because actually, Agent, I have a major change in our life
 that's on the horizon.
 And he's like, no, I mean big.
 And I was like, well, Chris, Agent,
 I have a long history of pushing our poker chips
 to the center of the table.
 And this is another one of those.
 And I woke up and I again, I was comforted by the fact
 that, yes, we journey in our personal history with the Lord
 and we look back, we have played this game
 where we push all our poker chips to the center of the table.
 We bet on God and He comes through and it's amazing.
 And I've preached this for forever,
 that the only thing that obedience ever produces
 is utter satisfaction.
 And we have this a long history of looking at stuff
 that's happened in our life that we could never even
 imagine was waiting on the other side of our yes.
 Yes.
 And often, really for us, even man's way
 of looking at a circumstance has been very different
 from what God has offered us.
 And it's always been amazing, you know, on the other side.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So, you know, that was our journey.
 And then you were talking about, so we said yes.
 That means back in April.
  </li><li>April?
  </li><li>We signed on with an adoption agency.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we have completed all the steps
 that we are required to become adoptive parents.
  </li><li>Yes, and there's quite a few steps.
 We didn't include how you would do it.
 Yeah.
 And we very quickly learned that you cannot pass go.
 You cannot collect $200.
 You cannot move on.
 Yes.
 Without something called a home study.
 Yes.
 And what is a home study you ask?
 Well, you need a driver's license in order to be able to drive.
 You need a home study in order to legally
 be able to adopt in the United States.
 Yes.
 And so our home study is a great idea.
 It's just a ton of work.
 Well, I mean, I'm super glad for kids that get adopted,
 that whoever they got given to had to go through this process
 and pass it.
 This rigorous process.
 But it's more intense than getting our green cards.
 Yeah, we were laughing about this.
 Like, I've immigrated to two different countries.
 Yes.
 So I've filled in all the paperwork to emigrate to Canada.
 Filled in all the paperwork to emigrate to America.
 The paperwork for a home study is more exhaustive
 than both of them.
 Yes, they want everything.
 They want everything.
 Give us eight references, get your whole family medical check, give us a result of that.
 We need to hear from, if you've ever been in therapy, we need to hear from your therapist,
 a written letter from them.
 We need all your financial information.
 That is yours.
  </li><li>F-B-I-R-E, fingertips.
  </li><li>Oh, fingertips.
  </li><li>Fingerprints.
  </li><li>Fingerprints.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>See, I can't even talk.
  </li><li>F-B-I background checks, local police background checks, child abuse background checks, all
 kinds of stuff.
  </li><li>All of our stuff, like your will, your insurance, your...
  </li><li>We want copies of all of that.
 Also, we're going to send a social worker to your house to evaluate your house.
 Is it got enough space?
 Are you financially, physically, and socially safe?
 And mentally, yeah.
 And you're mentally capable of caring for a child.
 Or in our case, another child.
 The social worker would come and do an interview with every member of our family.
 Yup.
 Sometimes twice.
 Yeah.
 An exhaustive process that two months and months and months.
 And then in the midst of that, of course, I had a tumor.
 Well, it's nice to mix things up.
 Yeah, it was great to stretch that out.
 Yeah, like hiccups would be boring.
 So yeah, you went and had surgery.
 Yeah.
 And that meant we had to wait
 because the surgeon need to give you a full bill of health.
 Yeah, so it made everything take longer than we expected.
 Yeah.
 For sure.
 But we also got the book ready while we were doing that.
 Well, the book, let me show you what a book is.
 And the book that you're talking about, explain the book.
 Well, so this is like a family profile.
 Absolutely call it.
 the company that we are using who are they're not actually an agency themselves. They're like,
 they are like a liaison between a bunch of different agencies.
 And help you walk through the process.
 Yes, they sort of they're like you're the lady that we first connected with. She said,
 we're like a doula. Like we help you through the whole process of adoption.
 I had to do a lot of doula is but I was like, oh, okay, that makes sense.
 I understood right away. Anyway, so the profile book basically is something that is going to get
 handed to a mom and she'll get a whole bunch of different ones from all different families.
 Well, explain the process.
 So the process looks like this. Basically, if there is a mom that reaches out to one of
 the agencies that we're connected with and says, I would like to enter into this adoption process,
 that mom gets sent out to the families and whatever information they have about the mom.
 Well, I am. We've missed one important but weird step.
 This is a slightly awkward talk about.
 Okay. But when you sign on with agencies, we're with four adoption agencies.
 Yeah. One of the first things they ask you, and rightly so, is like, when you say you're willing
 or wishing to adopt, what are you willing to adopt?
 Like, you know, talk to somebody.
 Would you take twins, triplets? Do you have girls, boys?
 Yeah. What age range, what ethnicity, what what medical problems are you comfortable with?
 and you fill out this form, which is kind of awkward.
 Yeah.
 But these agencies have a record of what the Jones family
 are looking for.
 Yes.
 And so sorry, continue.
 So if a mom comes in and it matches the criteria
 of what we're looking for, then we
 would get sent that mom's information.
 And we don't know how much information
 will be available on that mom.
 Information you mean her story.
 Her story.
 Her story.
 Maybe medical history.
 Maybe some medical history.
 but maybe not much at all.
 We don't, you know, it could be lots.
 It could be almost nothing.
 And then we get to pray, which I'm really excited
 'cause we'll get to pray with the kids
 and say, do we want to present our book to this mom?
  </li><li>Is this the baby that we feel like God has for us?
 Is this the birth mom that we're gonna work with
 in the adoption process?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And if our answer is yes, then our book gets sent to this mom
 and this mom will probably get a bunch of other books
 from different families.
 And that mom then gets to look at all of those different books and decide, you know, what family would I like my baby to be?
 Can I pause you for one second?
 Yes.
 I was speaking to Chris earlier and I looked up a statistic.
 Yes.
 For every one Caucasian baby that is available for adoption, there are 40 families looking for placement.
 Wow.
 Now, we are not limiting our...
 No.
 to our baby presence to Caucasian.
 But I was like, that's amazing.
 Wow. Yeah.
 So anyway, as you said, the birth
 one is going to get a bunch of profiles.
 Yes.
 And she's going to pick one.
 She's going to pick one.
 And if she picks us, then we would get to meet her either via Zoom or in person,
 depending on what state she's in and what she would like to do about that.
 And if after meeting, you know, both she and we go, yeah, this is it.
 then we sort of sign on the dotted line and then we're--
  </li><li>It's called a match.
  </li><li>It's a match and then we get to, you know,
 wait eagerly until the day that the baby arrives, so.
  </li><li>And it's worth knowing that's just one way
 that adoption can happen.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because maybe one of the strangest phone calls
 I've ever had in my life, while we are finishing out
 our family profile, we get a phone call from an agency
 saying, we understand that you're looking to adopt.
 And one of the preferences we've said
 was we take from newborn to three years old.
 And our preference would be a boy.
 Yes.
 And so this person said, hey, we heard this
 is what you're looking for.
 We have a four-year-old boy.
 It's outside of the parameters you're looking for,
 but just wondering if you'd consider this.
 And we're like, what's happening right now?
 Yeah, if he's placed for adoption,
 if you could come to Florida tomorrow--
  </li><li>Can you speak picked up tomorrow?
  </li><li>Can you speak picked up tomorrow?
 It will be $32,000 and we're like,
 "Whoa, what is happening right there?"
 And there was a bit of miscommunication
 because we didn't even, we weren't--
  </li><li>We weren't approved.
  </li><li>We didn't have our most though.
  </li><li>So we weren't eligible to do it anyway.
  </li><li>But I was like, wait, that can happen?
 So while we were talking earlier--
  </li><li>And I've heard several stories like that
 where it was like two weeks or three weeks away.
 I mean, one of the people that we were talking to
 when we were doing our home study,
 she was telling us, like she was doing intake on a mom
 who had phoned and said, Hey, I'd like to place my baby for adoption.
 And she she was asking your questions like, okay, how far long are you
 blah, blah? And she said, well, I'm about three centimeters dilated.
 So, you know,
 so we could get a phone call on a Thursday night.
 I mean, you really could.
 I mean, somebody that she was dealing with was going to get a phone call on a
 Thursday night, you know, so it can be that, you know, months ahead.
 It can be that we could get a phone call and it's a few weeks.
 So I mean, it is one of those things where we really we've signed on for an adventure.
 And we don't know how it's
 any, you know, we don't know anything.
 We don't know what state we're going to go and stay in.
 We don't know any of that because whenever we do adopt, we also need to go to that state,
 stay in that state for 10 days to two weeks until the paperwork's done.
 And there's a whole little bit of
  </li><li>Everything is a moving part.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>And there's no plan, there's just,
 there's just wait and be ready to go.
  </li><li>So where we are today is we have done everything
 that we are able to do to make ourselves eligible
 to adopt a baby.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And we're in the waiting process where we're like,
 okay God, this was a plan you put, you know, on our hearts.
 We suggest we've done the paperwork,
 everything that's necessary for this to happen.
 We are now trusting you to unfold this.
 And as you say, it's interesting that you won't hear this episode until about two weeks
 after we recorded it.
 So it'll be interesting to know what's happened in the two weeks.
 Yeah, because things could have changed by then.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 Here's what we would be eager for you to do.
 Like a request from our hearts is, first of all, thank you so much for listening to
 this.
 Like, you know, I love that people, I love that people choose to listen to us every
 week, but especially this after I love that you are, you were interested enough to see
 the title and hear our story. And we would really, really value your prayers. Because
 as you can imagine, the way we're wired, like high planners, not much left to plan,
 but just huge amounts of flexibility required. So we would love you to pray for us. We'd
 really ask you to pray for us and pray for the birth mom and pray for this child that
 we don't yet know either of them. Right. And in all likelihood, this child could
 already be conceived. So I mean, I'm literally praying every day for the mom and for the baby.
 And of course, we don't know who the mom of the baby are yet. But yeah, if you would pray,
 if you would join with us and pray, that would be amazing.
 There's a couple of things. If your heart is being stirred to connect with us more about the story,
 there's a couple avenues that you could help and we would really value and cherish your help.
 One, pray, absolutely. Two, if you would like to stay up to date with us on our adoption journey,
 If you go to allen and AJ.com/adopt, there's a place where you can put your email in and we'll
 add you to our adoption email list. Your email will only be used for adoption news. Like I said,
 there is a delay of about two weeks between us recording and releasing an episode. And if you
 want to have the most up-to-date information on how you can be praying for us or just even what's
 going on, sign up for that mailing list. Again, once this whole journey is finished, we will delete
 your email, we won't use it for any other purposes. Yeah. To be frank, we have exhausted our funds.
 So, you know, you heard me talk about our, you know, emergency savings fund that we had, and,
 you know, we have taken all the seed that we had, and we have spent all that money.
 We pushed it all to the center. To get this far. And we're aware that the average cost of adoption
 in the United States is between 50 and $60,000.
  </li><li>Which is insane.
  </li><li>Which is insane.
 We don't have that money.
 And we're trusting God.
 God said, "Hey, I'd love you to do this."
 And we've learned time and time again
 that God does not order what he cannot pay for.
 But if you're listening to the story and you're like,
 "I would love to help the Jones family adopt.
 "I would love to sow into adoption."
 You can also do so at the same page,
 lnnaj.com/adopt.
 And for US taxpayers, if you're a listener and you pay US taxes,
 We've worked or are working with an organization to ensure that your donations to helping us get
 this adoption through will be considered as a tax deductible donation, which is great.
 Yes, we're also working with an organization that will match gifts.
 We haven't heard back from them yet. Possibly we will have by the time you can even visit this
 page. But basically, up to a certain dollar limit, if you donate, they will match your donation,
 which is wonderful. For our listeners who are outside the US who don't care about, you know,
 US tax receipts, we've created a GoFundMe to help raise money for the adoption.
 Whether you can give or whether you're praying with us or you want to just hear our news,
 we're just so thankful to have you on the journey with us.
 And of course, from time to time on the podcast, we'll keep you updated.
 I'm sure to be part of our weekly update.
 If you don't see an episode out, it could be that we're flying to a different state to meet a birth mom or a heart.
 But if you're on the mailing list, you're going to know about that.
 You're going to know all about that.
 But thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for listening to this story.
 It's been a story we've been treasuring in our heart for the last 10 months.
 It's really exciting to actually finally get to talk about it.
 The kids have been dying to talk about it.
 So they've been like, when is it coming out? When is it coming out?
 Can we tell our friends?
 Yes. So there's a lot of excitement in the Jones household
 over this new adventure.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So to step today to give, to pray,
 that website again, alanonaj.com/adopt
 is the HQ for all things adoption related.
 You can also follow us if you don't already
 on Instagram @alanannaj.
 And pray for us 'cause we're super excited.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And until we have more news to share,
 we'll hopefully be back same time, same place,
 next week with a regular scheduled broadcast.
 See you later.
