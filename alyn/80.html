<p> I live in a j's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Episode AD.<br/>
 Can't believe it.<br/>
 What do you have to say for yourself?<br/>
 I'm shocked.<br/>
 I really thought when you suggested doing this that we would write out of things to say by
 Episode 10.<br/>
 So I'm surprised.<br/>
 Here we are.<br/>
 Still here.<br/>
 I love it.<br/>
 very fun. I also love it because this was an amazing week so we've got lots to talk about.
 Yeah, I actually ran into somebody in the grocery store today who just listened to our
 podcast for the first time and he goes to Grace Center and he said, "How many of you
 done?" and I said, "We're actually going to record number 80 today." And he said,
 "Do you guys plan out all of your banter and your jokes and stuff or is it as natural as it sounds?"
 And I was like, I mean, no, we just kind of sit down and talk and then this is the magic that happens all the time.
 It's a non-stop magic factory that Jones has up.
 Yeah, welcome to the magic factory.<br/>
 We had a fantastic week this week.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 Well, honestly, it was just even reviewing this week.
 I was filled with so much joy.<br/>
 It was a great week.<br/>
 Part of that was we had our dear friend, Artie Kendall come in.
 We did.<br/>
 And he's lovely.<br/>
 He is hysterical.<br/>
 He's so funny.<br/>
 Well, he is hysterical, but Louise is what makes it even more funnier because she is relentless in her joyful abuse of her husband.
 It's true.<br/>
 And her facial expressions and her heckling.
 And I keep forgetting, though they're American, they lived in Britain longer than I did.
 Yes.<br/>
 And so they didn't acquire an accent.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 Well, she can put on an accent.<br/>
 Yes, she can.<br/>
 But they've got very British sense of humor, which makes it tremendous fun.
 And so, R.T. was with us speaking to our second years, and then we got to take him out to the
 Loveless Cafe, which he loves the Loveless. I've never seen a theologian happier
 than R.T. at the Loveless Cafe. Fried chicken and biscuits, that's all it takes to make a theologian
 happy. This particular thing. And he just got back from Singapore and was about to leave for China.
 He kind of sandwiched us in the middle, which was very kind. But he had to go see a doctor. He
 He wasn't feeling fantastic and the doctor said, "Look, you're fine, but your jet lagged
 out of your tree.<br/>
 You've just come back from Singapore and in two days you leave for China."
 So he couldn't come back the second day because he was ordered to rest.
 So I got to fulfill one of my lifelong dreams.
 Yes, you did.<br/>
 And what was that, darling?<br/>
 I was RT Kendall's understudy.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 I'm not sure that was an agreement that we had.
 And that, you know, I'm not sure I can put that on my resume.
 Right.<br/>
 He blessed me, emailed Monday night and just said, "I'm so sorry.
 I love you guys to pieces.<br/>
 I just can't come in tomorrow."<br/>
 And so I went to my treasury of RT Kendall, understanding theology books.
 Yes.<br/>
 And very quickly using his teaching notes prepared.
 The together.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 On the joyous topic of hell.<br/>
 Hell.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 We talked about hell.<br/>
 We talked about universalism.<br/>
 Annihilism.<br/>
 Annihilism.<br/>
 It was just a barrel of fun.<br/>
 Let me tell you.<br/>
 It was actually super interesting.<br/>
 Oh, thank you.<br/>
 I really like to you spoke at m8 monday night on a fascinating topic tell us about it i did um well i was i was i can't really remember when i spoke and i must be getting old i do remember don't curse yourself i must need more coffee.
 Um, I do remember, uh, at the end, just sort of talking about, you know, you can go into
 the Christmas season thinking about yourself and all the things that you wish that Christmas
 looks like and it doesn't and all that kind of stuff, or you can go in and think about
 the fact that this is about Jesus.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And if every day we could just wake up and go, Hey, Lord, give me an opportunity today to
 love somebody well, highlight somebody to me that I could love well. And whether that
 looks like buying a stranger a coffee or writing a friend a note or you know whatever, but
 highlight somebody to me so that this season can be a season of being thankful and being
 focused on the one that this season is about rather than what you wish life looked like
 by now or whatever.<br/>
 That sounds amazing. I'm sorry I missed it. I was preparing a talk on Annihilism.
 You were.<br/>
 And you did a wonderful job.<br/>
 I would have much preferred to have listened to you preach.
 So that was that was Monday, Tuesday.<br/>
 It just flew by Wednesday was a very special day.
 Why?<br/>
 Because it was Wednesday and every Wednesday is special.
 No, because all our meetings got canceled.
 They did.<br/>
 So we got to freestyle and have a catch up day, which I loved.
 Yeah, it was really good.<br/>
 And then Thursday, all our meetings came back.
 But the fun part was we had our staff Christmas party.
 We did.<br/>
 All of Grace and her staff got together at some friends house and we had
 a riot of a time. We did. It was a very, very fun party and the food was fantastic.
 And I'm not usually one for large gatherings as a lot of you know, but I had a tremendous,
 I thoroughly enjoyed every part of it. That's so good. It was excellent. I employed some of
 the brain science teaching that I'd been teaching on the week before.
 Oh. Well, basically, like you used your brain science understanding on people.
 on myself. Because your thoughts, your feelings and your actions are all interlinked. So if you
 change one of them, you change the other two. Anyway, I had a tremendous time. Absolutely.
 Lory's time loved it. I earlier that day on Thursday, I took MJ for a date, which can only
 mean one thing. Donuts. Well, that's what the three year old has linked. Yeah. In his cognitive
 map a date is a doughnut. Yeah, I went and saw Shannon in the morning and she straightened
 to my hair from you. And as soon as I got home, he said, "Mommy, you look pretty. You
 take me on a date." That boy's got all the lingo. Yeah, he's a smooth operator. So you
 took him out, you had doughnuts? Yeah, well, I said, "Briddy, you want to go?" And he's
 like, "Uh, to the factory for doughnuts?" I was like, "Well, duh." So I went over and
 I got to preemptively try a new drink that Honest Rose users just come out with with egg
 milk.<br/>
 Oh yes.<br/>
 Well actually the following on a Friday, this weekend has really been a weekend of beta
 testing new food.<br/>
 Yes, but I wanted to tell them about the Ranger.
 Oh god.<br/>
 So we're in the car and I said to MJ, you know, what song do you want to listen to?
 And he said, "Mummy, we listened to this song about the Ranger."
 And I was like, gosh, what song is that?
 You know?<br/>
 So I said, what can you tell me a little bit more about the song?
 And he's like the Ranger song, mommy, the Ranger.
 And I was like, okay, baby, but who else is in the song?
 Like is it about something?<br/>
 And he said, my favorite Lord Jesus and the Ranger.
 And I was like, Holy Spirit, I need help.
 I have no idea what he's talking about.
 And then came up with a way to major, which is what he wanted.
 And it's Faith Hill's version and it's only that version.
 Only Faith Hill's version.<br/>
 If you play.<br/>
 The only one he will listen to.<br/>
 And the other version, he throws a hissy fit.
 Yeah, but he loves it and he just wants you to play it over and over again.
 So, and then he said to me when we got home, he was being so cute.
 I turned around and you know, just was having a little chat with him before I got him out of the car.
 And he said, "I mean, you look so pretty."
 I was like, "Thank you, baby."<br/>
 And he goes, "Mommy, if I see a ranger, I'm going to look
 inside and if Jesus is in there, I'm going to climb in so I can be right next to him.
 Oh my God.<br/>
 Oh, it's so adorable.<br/>
 I said, that sounds like a good plan.<br/>
 It was very cute.<br/>
 Moment of silence for adorable child comment.
 Yes.<br/>
 Back to food and beta testing.<br/>
 Back to food, baby.<br/>
 Friday, we got to hang out with our new friend, Mikayla, who normally listens to our podcast
 all the way in Norway but finds herself in the US for a couple of weeks.
 And so she's a good friend of Josh and Sarah Parsons.
 So we hung out on Friday morning.<br/>
 I think mentally she was checking off her own, keeping up with the Jones' meal plan.
 Yeah, because we mentioned so many different things and she's like,
 "I'm all the way over in Norway and you keep talking about donuts and acai bowls."
 But she got to experience a lot. We went to five daughters.
 Now, I'm not sure if we've actually mentioned that five daughters now has a store.
 If we haven't, that is terribly, terribly sorry.
 We don't know. We're not good friends if we haven't told you.
 We're not doing a good job on public service. But $5 has opened a store in the factory.
 And they do way more than just donuts. In particular, we have a good friend called David
 Molner. And they have named a breakfast sandwich after David Molner.
 And it's so good.<br/>
 Which, before we talk about how good it is, what does one have to do to get a confectionery item
 named after themselves? I don't know. But I know that that's now one of your goals, isn't it, darling?
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely is.<br/>
 What would you like to be called the Jones?
 It's not highly imaginative, but I'm going to go with it.
 Anyway, back to the molnir, which is a croissant.
 I can't believe I say croissant, a croissant,
 which is freshly baked, cut in half, layered with bacon, egg,
 and cheddar cheese, and then, obviously, toasted, served warm.
 It's so good.<br/>
 But I heard a rumor, I'm not even sure if I'm allowed to say this on there,
 But I heard a rumor they were experimenting with the idea of doing X Benedict.
 Yes.<br/>
 So I pushed my luck, asked for the favor of the Lord to be upon me, and what do you know?
 They made us an X Benedict molar.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 It was exceptional.<br/>
 It really was amazing.<br/>
 I think my eyes have seen the glory.<br/>
 Oh dear.<br/>
 That's not good because I can't make holidays.
 You know what?<br/>
 You can do all things through Christ whose friends.
 No, I have tried several times.<br/>
 And I can cook most things that I try and cook, but I can't do the holidays.
 You know what, if I can get a confectioner item named after me, you can make holidays.
 Well, already then solved.<br/>
 Let that be our goal.<br/>
 So yeah, we discovered the Molnar with X bandit.
 Then we had Masai Bowl and then we went to Burger up.
 It was just a fantastic food Friday.<br/>
 But then they, you know, because we were sitting in the factory, they kept bringing us out
 different things to try.<br/>
 I just love that.<br/>
 That's why all my meetings are the factory.
 It's like drive by blessings of baked goods.
 It's also I'm gaining weight, hand over fist.
 I'm going to have to stop being at the factory.
 Never.<br/>
 In the very...<br/>
 Friday night you did the M&amp;A social, went to Home Alone.
 Yes.<br/>
 I rather predictably stayed home alone.
 Yeah.<br/>
 No, it was great.<br/>
 You were supposed to wear an ugly sweater if you wanted eggnog.
 I decided that actually I'd rather pay for the eggnog than pay for an ugly sweater that I didn't want.
 That's very producer-like of you.<br/>
 And then in the end, I got free eggnog anyway.
 There you go.<br/>
 And I didn't have to wear an ugly sweater. But there were some fantastic sweaters present.
 You know what? We're already 50 minutes into this.
 Yes.<br/>
 And we're only on Friday.<br/>
 Oh no.<br/>
 That's how action packed our week was.
 Oh, it was, yeah, it was fun.<br/>
 Saturday I went bike shopping with Abigail.
 Yes.<br/>
 I'm buying with the idea of getting a bike.
 The problem with that is I'm trying to find a way I can incorporate exercise into my
 weekly routine.<br/>
 I find it very difficult to do exercise for the sake of exercise.
 You need it to be fun.<br/>
 No, I'm never going to find it fun.<br/>
 I need it to be functional.<br/>
 I've tried running but I end up where I started.
 I'm like, what was the point of that?<br/>
 Okay, the point is that it's good for your body.
 It doesn't feel good.<br/>
 So I'm thinking, what if I tried cycling to work?
 Okay.<br/>
 Like, it's a good 10 miles.<br/>
 I may die.<br/>
 You may die.<br/>
 Well, I've realized that there's a cycle path all the way from our house to our work.
 Every time you say cycle path, I keep thinking you're saying cycle path.
 I hope there's not a cycle path.<br/>
 For 10 miles, all the way to our work.
 That would motivate me to battle faster, mind you.
 That's true.<br/>
 So anyway, the jury is out on whether I am actually going to get a bike or not.
 But the more important thing is Abigail, our oldest daughter really likes riding her bike.
 And she's not quite good at it.<br/>
 But she wants me to come with her and I'm fed up running along beside her.
 So I'm thinking, I'm going to have to get a bike to keep up with her.
 If you run along beside her, there's a reason you're doing that.
 Yeah.<br/>
 My milkshake falls the whole time.<br/>
 Yeah, and it's so hard to do your chocolate.
 I understand.<br/>
 Anyway, that was fun.<br/>
 Saturday night, we went up to Nashville and ate at Dallas.
 Oh, I love that place.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So good.<br/>
 Got a Sierra old friend's Graham and Libby, which was very sweet.
 And then today church, passage, Jeff's back.
 Oh, it's so good.<br/>
 Oh, I love having a pass.<br/>
 Like passage, Jeff.<br/>
 We opened with amazing worship from Jesse early and, you know, the grace of worship too,
 which was amazing.<br/>
 And then Jeff got up and told a few stories about his time in China.
 And then he just said, "You know what?
 I don't really want to move on.<br/>
 I just want to wait in the presence of God."
 So that's what we did.<br/>
 And then we got to pray for everybody.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I was like, "I love that our church will do that."
 It was so good.<br/>
 He said something, which I tweeted out because I thought it was so profound.
 But he said this, "A danger as a pastor is that I can plan where we are going at the
 risk of missing where he is."<br/>
 So he's like, "Look, I've got a message prepared, but I don't really feel the anointing
 on the message.<br/>
 I feel like the anointing is where we are right now.
 So why move on?"<br/>
 I don't know too many pastors who would halt a service.
 Yeah, I mean, it was very good.<br/>
 I love the way he prioritizes following the Holy Spirit.
 That's actually one of the defining characteristics of Jeff dollar.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Holy Spirit first at the expense of everything.
 Yes.<br/>
 And I love that.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Gosh.<br/>
 So good.<br/>
 That's what made us actually want to move countries, wasn't it?
 Mm-hmm.<br/>
 We saw a man who'd just say, "Yes," the Holy Spirit, and we're like,
 "Yeah, we'll come say yes to you."<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Smart decision, high five.<br/>
 Oh, yeah.<br/>
 Oh, there we go. Well, last week, we said, hey, there's a bunch of questions you guys have asked us and we haven't got them and we're sorry.
 Right.<br/>
 So I thought this week we got some great questions, some questions that made me chuckle and I can't wait to hear your answers.
 Oh, no.<br/>
 Yeah. Oh, they're fantastic questions. So without further ado, this first question from James.
 And he says this, my question is about sexy and sexiness. I already like the question.
 Already.<br/>
 And I haven't even read it.<br/>
 Like this is probably one of my favorite questions.
 Sexy and sexiness.<br/>
 A month ago, I went on a date with a girl from church
 who's pursuing God.<br/>
 And I had a great connection with.<br/>
 She showed up to her date with a short skirt,
 a revealing shirt, and obviously no bra on.
 I was very surprised she'd never dressed like that prior to.
 I was raised in and appreciate modesty.
 It seems like with the latest fashion trend
 and what celebrities are wearing the standard for covering
 has lowered even in the church.<br/>
 His question is, what would you guys say the standard
 quote unquote is for modest dress<br/>
 as a Christian man or woman?<br/>
 What is right and wrong in a woman wanting to feel
 or dress sexy outside of her marriage?
 I want my future wife to look, feel, dress and be sexy
 in our bedroom with the door closed, not in public.
 Am I being legalistic?
</p><ul>
  <li>I don't think you're being legalistic.
 I think you're being smart.
 I've always said that I don't have clothes
 that I can't wear to church.
 And that was true even before I had three babies.
 And when my body looked more,
 maybe I could have pulled off those clothes
 a little bit better.
 I've never done the midriff thing,
 or I would literally, in buying any clothes,
 even if it was clothes that I just wanted to wear
 to look nice, to go out with friends or whatever.
 If I couldn't walk into church and those clothes,
 I just didn't buy them.
 Because I guess I didn't, on one level,
 I'm like, I don't wanna have those options.
 I don't wanna cause anybody to stumble.
 And I want somebody when they meet me
 to meet me for the right reasons,
 not because I'm advertising something.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah, I could see where that would be shocking/disappointing.
  </li><li>I totally hear what you're saying,
 and I absolutely agree with you, modest is hottest.
 But in defense of this girl,
 who knows what her viewpoint is?
 Who knows if she's been taught
 that in order to get a guy you have to look like this?
  </li><li>Right, or if anybody's talked to her
 about any of this stuff at all,
 'cause again, the vast majority of the church
 isn't talking about sex, isn't talking about sexuality,
 isn't talking about boundaries and relationship,
 isn't you know what I mean?
 And so people are left to fend for themselves as it were.
 And so they're probably going to trend towards whatever's popular.
 Yeah, or what they think is wanted.
 It's something I didn't understand because I just assumed that all women were just
 less hairy versions of men. And as in,
 I thought that you were just wired the same way we were.
 So men are primarily visually oriented.
 Like we are turned on by what we see.
 Right.
 Women generally speaking, that's not their primary thing that arrives with them.
 Right.
 So that means that a lot of women, unless they know a lot about men,
 honestly, don't realize the effect that what they're wearing or not wearing have on
 other men. So generally speaking, men will spot gapage at 50 paces.
 Right. And that's, you know, women, that's not your fault.
 It's just the beauty of the way God's made us.
 And so I think, I think if you don't understand the effect that you're,
 what you're wearing or how your dress can have on other people,
 then you just may be dressing for a standard
 that you think is required based on,
 you know, what the media is telling you
 or what your friend group, what your peer group are.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But it sounds like you, James,
 or not that you're wired differently,
 but you have a value.
 Like what she was wearing was communicating something
 different to you than perhaps she was anticipating.
 Your question is, what is the standard for modest dress?
 I don't wanna get into what the standard is.
 You know, we're blessed as many women in our community
 who are brilliant at embracing their womanhood
 and at the same time remaining incredibly stylish
 and yet remain modest.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I really appreciate that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Yeah, we have several women at Grey Center
 that are fashion people, they dress people
 and all that stuff, they're stylists.
 They're super trendy.
 and they dress really, really well.
 And they're still dressed modestly, and they, you know what I mean?
 And they have these amazing jobs, dressing, you know, big bands and all that kind of stuff
 because they can clearly dress well, but they can also still dress modestly.
 I think what we hear is either choice of dress sex or dress modestly.
 And I don't think that's the case.
 Like, no.
 These women, though, they're dressed modestly, are still beautiful women who are embracing
 who God's made them to be.
 They're still feminine.
 They're still twin-e.
 Absolutely.
 They're still lovely.
 Yes. Without selling themselves short of something.
 So I don't know if I want to say what the standard is, but I think maybe the standard is that you're
 not causing people to stumble. Not that that's your responsibility, but you can go a long way in
 helping people. So if I can see the rhinestone in your belly button, it's probably not appropriate.
 Oh dear.
 Should I stop now? Yes.
 But no, I don't think you're being legalistic. No, I don't think you are.
 i can't believe the end of that must be more that we can discuss about sexier sexiness
 that's what i do think that sexy and sexiness has a place
 you know in a marriage go on absolutely
 you know i i don't have any problem with that at all
 um he's got it but i yeah i don't i don't think i don't want to address sexy and then go out
 and hang around with my co-workers or people i don't i mean that's that's not who that's for
 Right. Great point. So, yeah. Let's start the podcast. You're good change.
 Princess layout fit. I'll get changed in my hand solo outfit and.
 Yeah. Oh dear.
 Speaking of Han Solo, baby, we're just a mere 12 days away from Star Wars.
 Have we booked tickets? I have.
 Now, tell me again, what is the difference between Star Wars and Star Trek?
 I was never just kidding.
 I'm just kidding.
 I was like, I'm selling your ticket.
 You don't get to come anymore.
 Generally exciting.
 One of the first movies I ever saw in the movie theater with my dad was Return of the Jedi.
 Yeah.
 It was Raiders of the Lost Ark first and then Return of the Jedi second.
 OK.
 So yeah, a special place in my heart.
 Absolutely.
 All right.
 Second question is from Joseph.
 Again, this is a fantastic question.
 He says, firstly, let me say that I switch to an iPhone due to your podcast.
 Listen, I'm just doing the Lord's work.
 That's all I'm doing.
 I'm just a humble servant of the Lord.
 Secondly, my wife and I are pastors in St. Louis.
 We got married a little over a year ago, congratulations.
 And we've discovered something in our marriage that we are working on that.
 I'd love some advice on.
 I grew up as an only child while my wife has several siblings and we live in a
 small one bedroom apartment.
 All that being said, I'm trying to discover what the balance is in marriage between that desire and myself for a little bit of space now and then,
 and not being selfish about it, which I know is difficult for only children like myself.
 Is there such a thing as a healthy line in regards to marriage about what I've heard some people call me time?
 I mean, yeah, I would say you need me time.
 Everybody needs some level of me time that could be that if your wife has several siblings and wasn't
 really able to acquire me time growing up, that she has a lower need for that.
 Right.
 And maybe that's something for her to discover whether, you know, what her needs are.
 Alan and I are both introverts and we both need time with no other people in it.
 So...
 I love that description.
 Yeah. I mean, just no children, no, whatever. I mean, we just need
 that little bit of time now. The truth is with the way our lives look how busy we
 are, we have three children, all that kind of stuff. We don't always get the
 amount of time that we want. And on that kind of stuff you kind of just have to
 suck it up and that's what life looks like right now and that kind of stuff.
 But we also try and help each other get that time when we are able to see each
 other's distress signals of, "Oh my gosh, if one more person asked me a question, I'm
 I'm gonna start to cry, you know, kind of things.
 So I think maybe it'd be good to chat with your wife
 and come up with a, hey, could we start by trying this
 kind of a scenario?
 Like I would love to just get this much space
 in the morning or whatever time of day works
 for your schedule for me to have time by myself
 and then maybe equally make sure that you are meeting
 whatever her need is, because if she's grown up with siblings, like you say, not that I'm suggesting that you've lied or you think that you're lying.
 She may have a need for people.
 So what you might be encountering is you're saying, "I need space," and she's saying, "I need the opposite of space.
 I need connection."
 So if you can figure out a way to meet her connection, then she can probably figure out a way to give you space.
 Yeah, the good rule of thumb is if your spouse is crying into the cornflakes first thing in the morning, they probably need some space.
 Just take that as a distress signal.
 If I'm even eating cornflakes, take that as a distress signal.
 No, but seriously, this, of course, being an only child and having many siblings will contribute to it, but probably a more sophisticated way of assessing what's going on is to get your life language profiles taken.
 Oh, yes.
 Yes. If you haven't already.
 Yes. Because that will really, really clearly indicate what your needs are and will also
 help you understand yourself and help you understand your spouse.
 And then you can kind of work at it.
 So, you know, although the AJ and I are quite introverted, and by introverted we would mean
 we get our energy by being on our own.
 Yes. Like we recharge being on our own, we spend our energy with other people. And so
 So it's not that as introverts we don't like other people, of course we like other people,
 but AJ's need for other human contact is way higher than mine.
 But I still need human contact.
 You know, after about six, seven months of just cave time, I do need to come out of hibernation
 and see other people.
 You wish.
 No, no, no, no, but we do realize that you need more human contact than I do.
 And of course I still need human contact.
 So we've worked out a system of what that means and it works very well at this stage
 of life.
 For example, Friday night, the home alone thing, you really wanted to go to that.
 Yes.
 I didn't because it's been a very, very busy season and I know going out just for those
 two, three hours would be the most expensive expenditure of my energy.
 It also means that we need a babysitter.
 Well, I am, we can kill two birds with one stone.
 I can be the babysitter and I can actually just recharge, which will make me available
 for other events, been a very busy social event. So we look at our week and realize how much
 energy is going to be expanded and then budge our energy needs accordingly. And you might
 need to do that. And life language is a very helpful way of doing that.
 All right, question number three. How many questions do we have?
 We have four. All right, question number three is from Matteo.
 Matteo. This morning I was working through Finding Father. Now I've heard of that book.
 Yes.
 Wasn't that written by a very hot Canadian? It looks a lot like Princess Leia.
 Yeah, okay. So I was working through Fanning Father and the journaling component asked me
 to ask the Holy Spirit what my coming to senses moment was with regard to the prodigal son.
 So in your book you write about the prodigal son coming to his senses and making a change
 of his life. And it made me think about a number of things. For instance, I hear countless stories
 of people who encountered the Lord at some point in their life only to walk away and then return
 later on, much like the prodigal son, was salvation found in the initial encounter or was it found
 in the return? I guess you're asking if salvation was found, why did he walk away from it? Or was
 a real version of salvation found upon his return? I know salvation is so much more than a moment
 and a decision, but a process and a relationship, and I never want to discredit grace in the journey.
 So I guess I'm stuck in the tension between verses such as Romans 10 and 9,
 If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God
 racen from the dead you will be saved, and verses like Philippians 2, 12, work out your
 salvation with fear and trembling. To bring this back to the story of the prodigal son,
 was his redemption found in his coming to senses moment, or was it before that?
 I know this may be a tricky question to answer in generalities because it comes
 down the heart of each individual, but I thought it'd throw out there to hear your thoughts.
 Well, it's a great question, Mateo.
 E, all of the above.
 E, all of the above.
 But in many ways, yes, E, all of the above.
 You were talking about when somebody gets saved and then backslides and then
 gives their life back to the Lord, you know, which time did they get saved?
 And to both.
 I don't, I don't know, like, I guess when I think about it, I'm,
 I don't know if this is what you think, babe, but I'm not really a once saved, always saved person.
 I see I am.
 Are you?
 Yeah.
 I totally am.
 We could talk about this in death, but tell me what you mean by that.
 Well, I think if somebody gave their life to the Lord and then decided to walk away and renounce God.
 Well, I got a new new new new.
 That's a very precise situation.
 Yes.
 So deciding to renounce God, opting out of your salvation, saying, "I don't want that anymore."
 Yeah, we're saying, "Well, I don't really believe that anymore."
 Yeah, but that's not losing your salvation.
 That's throwing your salvation deliberately.
 That's the difference between me losing my keys and deliberately throwing my keys into molten lava.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 So is it possible for one to throw their keys?
 Yeah.
 I can't think of that.
 I mean, are you asking, "Is it possible to get into heaven against your own will?"
 No, but is it possible to, for example,
  </li><li>I've heard people say like once saved, always saved
 and so it doesn't even matter.
 Once they're saved, you know, they can walk away
 from the Lord and whatever,
 and at least they've made a commitment.
 So they're, but I'm like, but would God make you come
 and spend time with him for eternity
 when you decided to walk away
 and say you didn't want to be with him?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, I think the trouble with these questions
 is they're very cold and clinical.
  </li><li>Right.
 think, you know, if you look at the life of Peter, Peter absolutely denied Christ, not once, not twice, but three times.
 Yes.
 And so based on what you're saying, you're like, I'm not going to make you spend eternity with me, but the Lord knew his heart going.
 Oh, sweetheart, I absolutely knew what you wanted to do.
 And I knew what you were able to do.
 And but he also has he was restored to the Lord before Peter died.
 No, no, for Jesus did, obviously.
 But sure.
 But my point there is the heart of the father was to track him down.
 Yes. The kindness of God led him to repentance.
 Yeah.
 And so I don't, I just think it goes against the heart of God.
 To, you know, at what point is your back sliding getting you out of the promise of God's
 redemptive love? Is it stopping going to church? Is it stopping tithing? Is it stopping listening
 to Christian podcasts? Like, where's the line where you have not done enough to be saved?
 I just don't think that that's the way it goes right now. Can I find examples where it absolutely
 agree with people opting out of their self-ages? Sure, sure, sure, sure. But I think, I mean, anyway,
 to be honest, I haven't given it an enormous amount of thought. I guess I just wouldn't want
 to live like a half-hearted existence with the Lord because I know I have fire insurance.
 I think, and I wouldn't want to encourage anybody else to live like that either.
 No, of course. But if you think about the vast majority of your teenage years was spent with fire
 insurance, like you're coming to the Lord was a sincere conversion. But through lack of understanding,
 lack of training, lack of inner healing, lack of good Christian culture, you lived most of your
 like the way you wanted to banking on fire insurance.
 Now, if you were to die with the Lord,
 except you're in heaven and that window of your life.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 Yeah, but I mean, I, I was still to the best of my ability pursuing him
 or what I knew I could find of him in the circles that I was in.
 Okay.
 So I wasn't, I didn't just get saved and then do my own thing.
 No, no, I get that.
 I was going to church every Sunday and I was trying.
 I just had an overwhelming amount of opposition.
 Right.
 You know, so I, you know, I don't know.
 I just here's the deal.
 I mean, there's camps, there's Facebook arguments.
 There's theologians that debate this topic ad nauseam, like enormously.
 And there's people on both sides of the camp, friends of mine who believe
 completely different things than I do.
 And in all honesty, I don't have a well-worked
 theology, I haven't done much.
  </li><li>No, I mean, I don't either.
  </li><li>Much thought to it.
 Because I sometimes feel like some of the arguments
 that people are making is what's the least I can do
 and still gets into heaven.
 And I'm like, whoa, whoa, that's the complete wrong
 end of the stick.
  </li><li>Don't live like that.
  </li><li>No, live in total abandonment.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So what was Mateo's question?
 He asked like a thousand questions.
 But I guess he was saying like when is your salvation happening?
 I think your salvation, of course, is a continual process.
 There's a coming to the Lord and then there's a growing in the revelation of the Lord.
 It happened and it's happening.
 So I got saved when I was seven and then I met the Holy Spirit when I was in my early 20s.
 My experience for the Holy Spirit was a much deeper revelation of salvation than it was when I was at seven.
 But when I was seven, I was as sincere as I could have been for a seven-year-old.
 Right.
 Again, it's not something I've given an enormous amount of thought to pass what I
 instinctively feel, which is terrible, which is why I don't preach on this topic.
 But I'm sure I could look up, you know, any systematic theology textbook,
 and you could train yourself to argue for either.
 I think, forget about arguing and devote yourself to Jesus Christ.
 Yeah.
 How about that?
 I like him.
 Sorry, Matteo.
 We don't have a thorough answer for that.
 But I think where you are today isn't the end of your life, unless it is the end of
 your life.
 But I think the Lord is knitting a whole narrative, a whole journey.
 And so where you are today versus where you are tomorrow, God is a God of upgrades.
 He's constantly wanting to reveal more of himself.
 He's constantly wanting to grow you toward him.
 So if you are suddenly taking stock of your life and realizing, actually God, I'm experiencing
 less of you than I did last year, then it's probably time to evaluate life because you're
 going the wrong direction. He's a God of upgrades and he's a really good God. Just keep pursuing
 him. Amen.
 The last question for this episode is from Rebecca. She's got a brilliant question. She says,
 "My home group in my church was discussing hearing God's voice, which I know you have
 a podcast on. The trouble is I was the only one who believed God actively talks to us.
 When I pray, especially for long periods of time, I feel like God asks me questions in my subconscious or fills my head with a daydream that answers my question.
 I don't think it's manifested from myself because often I'm asked by that subtle voice to do acts of love or humble myself in ways my pride usually wouldn't allow me to suggest on my own.
 So I guess I have two questions.
 One, am I wrong in believing God talks back to us, like not just once in a blue moon, but on a weekly basis?
 2. I just transferred to this new city for college and this church I'm going to is new
 as well. Does it make me a selfish Christian if I want to leave and be part of a church
 family that believes in prophetic ministry and teaches it in how to hear God's voice
 and honestly many of the things you guys will teach on?
 No and no.
 So question one was, am I wrong and believe in God talks back to us?
 No, you're not wrong.
 God absolutely is speaking.
 He loves to talk to us.
 He loves to do exactly the kind of things you're talking about.
 And talk to us and inspire us to be better people and do better things and think better
 things.
 So, yes, you're heading in the right direction.
 But to encourage you, Rebecca, most of my Christian upbringing, I was raised in a great
 church with very godly people.
 But they believe the same thing as your church that no, God does not speak today.
 He could, but primarily he speaks through the Bible.
 No concept that he would speak through dreams or audibly or through your imagination.
 And the greatest surprise of my life was finding that God does speak today.
 If you would like some resources, you would do very, very well to order a copy of Dr.
 Jack Deers' book, Surprised by the Voice of God.
 That would really, really be a helpful book for you to read.
 And two, if you want to learn more about how to hear God's voice,
 just Google Mark Verkler four keys to hear in God's voice.
 and he's got some excellent teaching on it. So you're not nuts. In my experience, I hear
 God as often as I choose to listen to. He's talking all the time. And so your second question was,
 are you selfish for wanting to shift to a church that will teach you about these things?
 No. I think that's just wisdom. I think you're in a season of your life anyway,
 where you're learning, you've moved to wherever you've moved to for college.
 And you're obviously hungry for more of God. It makes sense to move to a place where you can be
 fed and encouraged and challenged and grow. I think that that just makes sense.
 I think let your hunger lead you where you need to go.
 All right. Well, thank you, James, Joseph, Mateo, and Rebecca for your questions.
 I want to wrap up with a very cool thing that I'd love to encourage you all to go to this web page,
 watch a video and then give some money to this project. What project am I talking about this week?
 Bill Johnson on Twitter posted a photo of him being filmed for a new documentary
 about miracles and evidence of said miracles. I was like, oh, this sounds interesting. So I
 clicked through and I watched this video. So this guy Elijah Stevens is tracking down people who
 have incredible miraculous testimonies and then finding corroborating evidence and filming it
 all in a documentary. It's featuring a bunch of the people you'd recognize from charismatic
 Christianity, so Bill and Roland and Heidi, Randy Clark, Sean Bowles, etc. But also a
 bunch of doctors, theologians, professors, etc. It sounds like it's going to be an incredible
 documentary. I love the video. I encourage you to watch it. To whet your appetite, I
 want to play you the video and you'll hear the audio track.
 Hi, my name's Elijah and I'm making a documentary about miracles, but it's going to be different
 than anything you've ever seen.
 What I want to do is to talk to some of the brightest minds.
 I'm going to ask the hard philosophical, scientific, and theological questions.
 Find the best cases that I can and cooperate them with medical evidence.
 I'm a radiologist, a more certified radiologist.
 My name is Dr. Candy Gunther Brown, and I received my B.A., MA, and PhD degrees from Harvard University.
 It is the burning thing in my heart to reach skeptics.
 And everyone has given up on them.
 And today, Caresmatic say no one can reach the intellectuals,
 and I don't believe it.
 She went to one of the experts in the United States.
 And here's what the doctor says in his report.
 I'm at a loss to explain why exactly this has occurred,
 which is pretty interesting for the expert.
  </li><li>If God is healing all these people,
 there should be a trail of medical.
 So that's what I'm going to find.
  </li><li>I've also seen medical records that cooperate.
 The basic facts of those test moves.
 There's quite a number of things that I could give.
  </li><li>Power to heal and the authority to deliver
 calls people to believe the gospel.
  </li><li>The Bible is living in active and powerful
 and the Holy Spirit backs it up.
  </li><li>When they was at my house
 and I start receiving texts from all of my friends,
 St. Sean Boltz, a prophetic minister,
 had called my name out at church.
 So I drive to my church and he tells me my name,
 my birthday that I lived in Chattanooga,
 grew up in Georgia and he says,
 God is commissioning you, go make this film,
 it's gonna be a new prototype for ministry
 and touch lots of doctors' lives.
  </li><li>I heard the words speak to me in my left ear again.
 the same way he spoke to Derivos and said, "Meefafil."
 And I'm here for the same number of people that fell on it.
 So, I'm going to miss it.
 Yeah, I'm making a documentary on miracles with medical evidence before and after.
 And I thought, "Jesus loves the scientists."
 You know, God the Father loves the scientists,
 so let's let them come and test.
 Jesus cares.
 Jesus loves the scientists.
 was alive and he works miracles right now today.
 So, Kickstarter lasts for 30 days
 and it's a do or die type thing.
 Either I reach my goal and you get the rewards,
 or I don't, you're not charged, but we don't make the film.
 And so, I am asking the body of Christ to partner with me
 and what God's doing.
 And so, please help me make this reality.
 So that was pretty awesome, right?
 Yeah, that was awesome.
 I can't wait for them to actually release that.
 Right, and so here's the thing.
 He's almost at his goal of $116,500.
 I think he's just over $112,000 right now, but I would imagine he's probably under budgeted.
 Right.
 I think it would be awesome if we all went online and we pushed him way over what he's trying to
 raise. He's got about a week left, I think, before his Kickstarter runs out. But I would love it if
 we could just throw some money towards that and make this documentary a reality. I think it would
 be so helpful for all of us if we could have a video, if we could have a really well-made
 documentary to show our skeptic friends or test even to use teaching. I think it'd do a great job
 in building the kingdom of God. Lastly, we mentioned that RT was with us this week teaching
 at the school. If you would like to hear RT, he's actually going to be teaching at Grace
 Center this Sunday. If you're in a Nashville, Franklin area, you don't have a church you
 call home, come out. If you can't make it to Nashville, you can watch online at Grace
 Center.us and then we have a watch live button in the top right hand corner. If you'd like
 us to answer any of your questions, go to allenaj.com/ask.
 And finally, if you want the show notes, go to alanaj.com/ad.
 I have an amazing week, and we'll be with you next week.
 Yes, ma'am.
 Faith, life, communication, tacos and video games.
 Pale you donuts in the kindness of God,
 but things we deal with every day.
 From Franklin, Tennessee, they are just like you.
 And me, Alan, and AJ, keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses, sharing their life, experience it, keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses.
 They talk about faith in God and everything under the sun
 If you are a human being, there's something here for everyone
