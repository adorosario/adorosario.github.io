<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hello Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 You know how I am.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm 100 episodes old, baby.<br/>
 Yeah, baby.<br/>
 Yes, you are.<br/>
 How ridiculous is that?<br/>
 It's kind of shocking.<br/>
 Why is it shocking?<br/>
 Well, I think I've said this before,<br/>
 but I wasn't really sure what we were going to say for 10 episodes.
 And now we're at 100.<br/>
 It is funny that whole thing, isn't it?
 Yeah.<br/>
 Everybody's been saying to me, what are you going to do for your 100th episode?
 And the truth is, we're not going to do much.
 No, it's going to be kind of a normal episode.
 Maybe we could give away something.<br/>
 Yeah, not because we're not excited.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 But because I got sick.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I got sick because you got sick.<br/>
 You got sick again.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 I was so bummed by that.<br/>
 I was so I felt assured that since I'd already been sick, I would not catch whatever you had.
 Yeah, but I had something completely different from you.
 Yes.<br/>
 And so my body decided to collect it as well.
 So as you know, our whole family was sick.
 Everybody was sick except for me, Mr.<br/>
 Brilliant Immune System, which I was actually really surprised that you had
 made it without getting sick.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And then come Tuesday of this week, while everybody else has finished their antibiotics,
 everybody else is fine.<br/>
 I come down with what I think is strep throat.
 I mean, it's not a bad guess.<br/>
 Everybody else is being antibiotics for strep and other things.
 So I go to the doctor Wednesday morning and say, oh, my family's been sick.
 And they're like, oh, yeah, let me swap your throat.
 And they said, no, you don't have strep.
 You just have a dreaded lergie, a viral throat infection.
 So I said, what can I take for that?<br/>
 They were like nothing.<br/>
 I was like, awesome.<br/>
 So I tried to fight it and then it knocked me out for two days.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then it took me out as well.<br/>
 You bounced back a little faster than me.
 I did.<br/>
 Well, I didn't have a choice.<br/>
 I had three children.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 I didn't have a choice either.<br/>
 But I mean, I sound, do I sound congested to you?
 I feel a little congested.<br/>
 OK, I think it's doing wonders for my radio voice.
 Yes, it's very manly.<br/>
 But also I went away on the weekend.<br/>
 I was teaching in Georgia.<br/>
 I went and did a prophetic conference, which was tremendous fun
 at Covenant Life Warship Center in Chicago.
 Chicago.<br/>
 Yep, never been there before.<br/>
 And you're sure that's how we pronounce it?
 I checked.<br/>
 OK, because I've been mispronouncing it all weekend.
 Have you been adding an N?<br/>
 I have yeah, I took a manga.<br/>
 They got no N, no Nonga.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 So Pastor Jamie and darling Chan, they're lovely church, lovely staff, lovely people had a great time.
 Stayed overnight, spoke Sunday morning and just drove back to Tennessee a few hours ago.
 And they sent you home with Tim Hortons.
 They did.<br/>
 They're Canadians.<br/>
 Yes, I know.<br/>
 So I very much appreciated that.<br/>
 My Canadian had a little happy dance.<br/>
 are welcome gift or my welcome gift were these matching aprons.
 Yes, me and MJ have got matching Star Wars aprons.
 I'm Han Solo and he's BB eight.<br/>
 He's so excited about that.<br/>
 He didn't take it off.<br/>
 He just wore it with a diaper for the rest of the day.
 And then you and the girls got some matching embroidered ones.
 Yes.<br/>
 So all that to say, we got super sick.
 The whole idea of doing, yeah, here's something fun.
 We're going to do for a hundred is going to have to be push pause on until
 Our pace slows down which you should do after next week. Can I tell you something funny about the aprons?
 Please do so, you know how I'm I'm not great at telling you like gifts
 That I would like like thinking up things. I have to really think right so we were we were in the
 We're at the Franklin Festival this weekend. I took the kids to the Franklin Festival with Cindy right and
 It was really super hot super crowded and the kids didn't want to stay so we did our typical Jones things
 where we drive in, park, and leave within an hour.
 Perfect.<br/>
 But I saw this apron stand and I looked at the apron and I was like, "Gosh, you know
 what?<br/>
 I really love like a girly apron."<br/>
 And I saw these really pretty apron.<br/>
 And I remember thinking if Alan was here, I would ask him if I can buy this really pretty
 apron.<br/>
 But he wasn't.<br/>
 And so I moved on.<br/>
 And then also on the weekend I was in Target and I saw these, you know, adult coloring
 books.<br/>
 So I really like doing anything artistic and that's sort of like a wind down kind of thing,
 like coloring things in.<br/>
 But usually the pictures aren't, sometimes they're not great.
 And so I sort of looked at them and thought, "Ah, one day I'll look into getting one and
 see if I can find one with, you know, images that are okay or whatever. Anyway, so you come back
 from Chickamauga and ta-da! Not only an embroidered girly apron, but an adult coloring book and
 like 74 pencil crayons. So I'm super stoked and it just felt like the Lord had paid attention to
 to the musings of my heart.<br/>
 And even though they weren't like,<br/>
 "Oh, I'm just dying to have that,"<br/>
 but like, "Oh, I'd love to have that at some point."
 Those were the two things this weekend
 that I had sort of paused momentarily in my heart about
 and you came home with both of them.
</p><ul>
  <li>He's good like that.
  </li><li>He is good like that.
  </li><li>It's also funny that they had me
 into teaching a prophetic weekend
 when clearly they're very prophetic
 to know that that's the gifts of my wife's heart.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Tell me where you're dressed,
 because we have just come home from the staff honor dinner that the students put on for the staff of the school.
 No, talk to me about that.
 I guess they did it for the first time last year.
 And it's just all the students get together and they plan this entire event that is just to honor all of the staff of the school for,
 I guess for working for a year, I mean, you know, for pouring into them. It's awesome.
 It is shocking the level of effort and excellence that they go to. I mean, it really undoes
 you.
 I mean, they're all dressed super sharp and they all wear, you know, black and they have
 this gorgeous photo booth and everything's super professional like this fruit tea and
 you know, just everything is to the nines.
 -Yes, and you walk in and they've transformed an otherwise all-purpose utility room into
 this beautiful, even dining room.
 -They've transformed an ugly room into a beautiful room.
 -Yes, and there's burlap and play settings and art hang on the wall and a menu and...
 -Individual teacups picked for each person.
 -Somebody's gone ahead and not just bought food but made it from scratch.
  </li><li>Yeah. - You have your own server
 the whole evening and it's just one lavish affair
 where you're like, "Guys, come on."
  </li><li>It's amazing.
  </li><li>And then the night giving you prophetic words
 and little gifts and you're like,
 "Come on in here." - Oh, and you're in all that kind of,
 yeah, amazing little paintings.
 And everything was done in trios for the food.
 So we had like a trio appetizer and then trio tacos,
 but like think upgraded, gorgeous, gourmet tacos.
 Gordon Ramsey would say very elevated tacos, elevated tacos, and then a trio of desserts
 and sweet bets even made us paleo versions of desserts.
 Right.
 They'd taken into consideration everybody's various food allergies and stuff.
 So it was, it was so lovely.
 It was really lovely.
 All right.
 Our main topic for this evening.
 Yes.
 I was thinking about this.
 I was thinking, you know, what are we going to talk about for a hundredth episode?
 I actually wanted to talk about the joy of starting small.
 Okay. There's a verse in scripture that everyone knows is Zacharya four verse 10 says,
 do not despise these small beginnings for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin. And
 I think the reason it says do not despise these small beginnings is because as humans,
 we hate starting small because usually we're inspired by something big. We see
 something that other people are doing and it inspires us towards greatness.
 but what we fail to take into consideration is the thing that we've seen that's inspired us,
 has been matured over many years. So we start out something small and we're like, we suck at this.
 And it's actually all part of the way God intended it. He actually delights and weakness,
 he delights and coming alongside you and saying, hey, I could help with that. So we're inspired by
 something big, but we're forced to start with something small. But you think everything in nature
 start to something small, even if it's a redwood or an adult. They all start as something small.
 And if they don't start as something small, they actually can't, they can't properly grow.
 But it's unique to everybody. It doesn't matter if you're quote-unquote,
 a creative or not. We're surrounded by people who are highly creative. We're also surrounded
 by people who are highly entrepreneurial, business people. And it's funny because when we compare,
 Let's say we start something, I don't know, we start a blog or we start a company or we start
 trying to write a song. When we compare with what we have versus what we want to have, ironically,
 we get discouraged by our perceived lack instead of our actual progress. So we look at the thing
 we've created and go, "Oh, it sucks. It's nothing like what I want it to be," rather than saying,
 "That's amazing. Half an hour ago, I didn't have this and now I do." So why is that? Why are we so
 So Ben on discouraging ourselves.
 I don't know.
 I guess I think I definitely fall into that trap.
 You do?
 And I do.
 I think even with the Ben book, I just felt like, oh, if I'd asked someone so to do it,
 it would be so much better or whatever.
 And you want it to be what it isn't yet.
 Right.
 That makes sense.
 But ironically, I found certainly in my own life that oftentimes we're more content with
 having nothing and the longing for something than having something small that shows how
 far we have yet to go.
 Isn't that weird?
 So we're more like, "Oh, I wish I was creative."
 And we're content to just stop there rather than saying, "I'm going to be creative and
 pull out a pad."
  </li><li>Present for creativity, yeah.
 pull out a pad and pen and draw something because then we're actually reminded how far we've
 got to go. But ironically, we're actually further than we were when we said, Oh, I'm not creative.
 It's actually the Lord thinks differently. It says in that verse that the Lord rejoices to see the
 work begin. So the reason for that is I've learned that God can do something with little, but nothing
 with lack. Right. That's a good point.
 So most of our problems in life stem from despising the little thinking it's
 lack and actually not giving it to God to grow it.
 Right. And what I've learned about God is he loves to come alongside us with
 whatever we have. You think about the little boy with his loaves and fishes.
 Right. And he says to the disciples, Hey, you feed them.
 He's going to see what they're going to do with it.
 And they're like, Are you kidding me?
 Like there's no way we can do this.
 And so he finds the smallest child.
 I'm not sure if it's a small child. He finds a small boy with small resources and the Lord's
 like, I can do more with this than with your panicking. But often we excuse ourselves from
 progressing with anything because we're more comfortable in our lack than with our little.
 Yeah, I think that's really good, babe. Think about the parable of the talents. You know,
 when the master gives five talents to one and three talents to another and one talent and says,
 go off and do something with it. And what's funny is the guy who got one did nothing and
 ended up getting nothing. And he was thinking, well, I thought you'd be mad. So I hit it. And
 that's what we do all the time. Like, I wonder if the guy with one talent was like, well, if I had
 five, I could do something, but I only have one and I can do nothing. And you know, gosh,
 if I had five, I could afford to lose some of them. But I only have one. What if I lose that? I've
 I've lost everything.
 But here's the thing, we often think it has to do
 with the amount that we start with,
 but it really doesn't because the guys who had the five
 and the three talents, they could have had the same fear.
 They could have been thinking, oh man,
 if I blow this, like I'm gonna lose five of them,
 at least that guy only has one.
 The thing is they risked something.
 And I think in our culture and our community,
 we've prioritized perfection over risking.
  </li><li>I think that's exactly it.
 I think perfectionism is what plays into the whole thing.
 And I think we have a fear of what other people think
 or what we're gonna think of ourselves
 or maybe even what God thinks or whatever.
 And it absolutely freezes us into doing nothing.
  </li><li>Well, there's also that fear that we're being fraudulent
 because when we start something,
 we feel like we're faking something.
 So think about it.
 Think about your New Year's resolution
 and you're going to the gym.
 As soon as you walk into the gym
 you've never been in a gym before.
 You feel like you don't fit in.
 Everybody knows I've never been here before.
 I feel like a loser.
 I feel like I don't fit in.
 And ironically, the only way you will fit in is by continuing to go.
 Yeah.
 So you have to overcome that fear.
 I remember when we started podcasting, I was on a conversation with
 somebody and they're like, Oh, what do you do?
 And I'm like, Oh, I'm a pastor and like, you know, what else you're doing?
 And I started saying, I'm a podcaster, but felt like a fraud.
 Because I'm like, well, how many podcasts do you have to produce before you
 I'm a podcast official podcast.
 You know, we're like that without everybody, you know, like, well, I'm a writer.
 I get, I mean, I guess like there's some magic number in our head that tells us once
 we've crossed that threshold will be legit.
 And until then, we're just a fake.
 Right.
 But I don't think that's true.
 I think, you know, I've been to somebody this weekend and they were saying they really
 want to write a blog post, but posting the first post feels so lame because it's now
 it's out there and everybody can see your first effort, but you also have this huge pressure of,
 if I don't post something soon, then it looks like I've quit and so we panic.
 And we compare ourselves to the people who've been doing it for years and we're like,
 "Oh, but we're not like the people who inspire us. They've got tons, but they actually only have
 tons because they started with one." Right. Everybody starts with one.
 So that's the thing. Don't despise the small beginnings because soon one thing becomes three,
 three things become 10, 10 becomes 20, 20 becomes 100, and before you know it, your podcast is
 or a songwriter or whatever. Again, I guess I would compare a lot of things to parenting because
 that's a lot of what we do. But parenting, everything moves slow and it grows slow and you have no
 choice, but actually in the end, you're happy that it went that way because there was time
 to grow it correctly.
 Correctly.
 You don't get the luxury of waiting till you know how to parent before you get a baby.
 Right.
 No.
 I mean, first baby arrives and you're like, "I'm no clue."
 Right.
 And the next one comes and they're different from the first one.
 You're like, "You're kidding me?
 Is this sick joke?
 What is going on here?"
 Yeah.
 And then number three, exactly the same.
 there's things that are similar, but there's also lots of stuff that's still a learning curve.
 Well, I think talking about the learning curve, one of the things I love about starting small,
 because we start a couple of ventures. You've written a couple of books, we start podcasting,
 we're stepping out into a few other things, all of which requires forces you to start small.
 And I actually love the learning curve that comes with that. I love the rapid increase in
 and understanding.
 And here's a little trick I've learned
 to trick myself into enjoying starting small.
 And it's something that Holy Spirit told me years ago,
 'cause I realized I only ever did things
 I knew I could excel at.
 Which means you're gonna have a pretty limited skill set.
 If you only are ever gonna try things
 you're already good at, then you're never gonna grow.
 But I remember freaking out in teacher training school.
 You know, I was learning to be a school teacher.
 And I was freaking out thinking,
 "Lord, I don't know how to do this."
 And he was like, "Good job, you're in school then, huh?"
 like, "What do you mean?" He said, "You're in teacher training school. The fact that you're
 being trained means you don't already know how to do it. So give yourself a break." And I was like,
 "Actually, that's magical thinking. So, you know, I'm learning to do this, which means I get grace
 learning how to do something. I love the rapid increase in understanding that comes when you learn
 something new." Yeah. And it's fun. I mean, I think once you realize that you can do it or that
 that you're learning to do it,
 and you're becoming competent at it,
 then you start to gain confidence,
 and it starts to be added to your tool belt kind of thing,
 but it's the starting of something that's tricky.
  </li><li>We've got some friends that Zai says,
 that they're total geniuses.
 Tiffany, you probably would have seen
 on the internet on Instagram.
 She does all the amazing Bible journaling artwork
 that you've seen.
 She's one of Zondervan's artists.
 She was involved in the new Bible project,
 the journaling Bible thing. She's just this creative genius.
 Yes, she's so gifted.
 Her husband is this, I don't know, he's this eclectic collection of genius business marketing.
 He's just a super sharp guy, incredibly smart, hardworking people. He told me something a few
 weeks ago that's really changed my way of thinking on this topic. He said, it's actually
 really good to iterate in public. Previously, I thought that you can put something out there
 till it's polished and finished. Which actually is a good excuse for perfectionism.
 Yeah, again, back to that again.
 Back to that whole thing, which is basically fear. He was like, no, no, don't be afraid to put out
 something that isn't yet perfect. Put it out. Then tweak it, edit it, adjust it, change it.
 Let other people watch you evolve what you're doing in public because you build
 empathy with your audience. They see you having the same sort of struggles and process and
 it's inspiring. That's how you build a fan base. I was like, man, that freed me up so much.
 Because I think part of the killer to getting stuff done is we want it just so. We want it just
 right. You don't have to worry about that. People would rather have something than nothing.
 I think it's funny too, because if you think about us as people when we teach and stuff,
 we're happy to be vulnerable, but it feels like it's a different thing to put out something that you know isn't where you want it to be.
 And it's a visual representation of that.
 So with regards to episode 100, here we are recording it.
 We're now sitting in a purpose-built studio for podcasting.
 Yes.
 That's bizarre for me.
 But it is.
 There's a whole story in and of itself of how we ended up with this, which we'll have to tell at some point.
 But we've got sound-insulating panels on the wall. We've got a purpose-built table with countersink
 booms and shock-mounted microphones. We've got headphones to listen to all our recording levels.
 And over in the corner there, there's an edit station with monitors and more headphones and
 hundreds of dollars worth of software. But if we waited until we had all that stuff before
 recording a podcast, we never have started. No. What do we start with? Two cheap microphones
 and two mic stands. Well, what we started with was we borrowed all the equipment from Blake.
 So Blake lent us some microphones, lent us some, you know, music stands and we tried it and we
 didn't have any software to edit either. He edited it all for us. Thank you, Blake. We knew nothing,
 but magical things happen when you start small. Yeah. And I've just seen time and time again that
 that the Lord will come and breathe on something, but he'll wait while you have nothing.
 So my encouragement dear listener is what have you been waiting until you're better at?
 Because forget waiting.
 Just start now.
 Put something out there that God can bless and grow and you'd be astonished.
 So our encouragement to you this week is record that song.
 that blog, write that book, start a business, ask that girl out.
 Like whatever, don't let starting small put you off because there's tremendous joy in
 starting small.
 We did.
 We loved making every episode, even the episodes where we forgot to hit record and then we
 had to re-record it.
 Even most recently, the episodes where all our equipment fails and I'm in tears thinking
 what's going on because you're learning something from everything.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It has been really super fun.
 And if you'd asked me before we started, I wouldn't have thought that I would really
 enjoy it.
 I was just like, "Okay, if you want to try it, let's try it."
 Again, thinking we probably wouldn't do more than 10 episodes.
 And here we are, 100 in.
 Right.
 And actually, I really love it.
 And we want to thank all our listeners for that.
 I mean, honestly, without you guys, there's no point in doing this.
 And we love getting encouragement from you, from around the world.
 We love getting emails.
 We love getting feedback.
 And so thank you so much.
 you, like I said, there's no point in your encouragement for the last 100 episodes is super encouraging.
 In many ways, we're just getting started. 100 episodes isn't that much. Some of the podcasts
 I'm listening to are, I've got way more than that. Anyway, I want to encourage you, go do something
 brilliant and do it by starting small. There's two resources I want to point you to. The first
 First is an article I wrote a while back called 'Practice the Now'.
 It's a short read, it'll take you maybe three minutes and hopefully it's going to inspire
 you that you don't need the things you think you need to get started, just get started
 now.
 Practice the Now.
 The second thing is a brilliant video that Jesse Earley got me into when I preached a
 couple of months ago on creativity.
 It's so succinctly describes a problem that we all face when we start producing new content.
 It's brilliant.
 It'll be super encouraging to you again.
 It's three or four minutes long.
 It's well worth your time.
 Check the show notes for both of those.
 To find the show notes for any episode that you're listening to, just go to allen and
 ag.com/whatever number of the episode you're listening to in this case, it's 100.
 So allenag.com/100.
 If you'd like to send us any feedback or reach out to us at all, we'd love you to go ahead
 and head over to alanahj.com/ask.
 And we promise you between now and next episode,
 we're gonna think of something special
 to mark this amazing occasion
 so long as we don't get sick.
 So thanks for tuning in.
 Once again, have an incredible week.
