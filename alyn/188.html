<p> I'll in an AJ's podcast for your Monday,
 most wonderful show is,<br/>
 Keeping up with the Joneses.<br/>
 Welcome to episode 188 of Keeping Up with the Joneses,
 where this week we are talking about how God is both fast and slow.
 What's with the husky sexy voice?<br/>
 I think it's allergies.<br/>
 Either that or I have some sort of low level cold,
 But I went to the doctor just to make sure it wasn't something else.
 And he swapped me and I gagged, "Heck!"
 And then he came back and he said, "Well, I don't see anything wrong with you.
 Your ears are fine."<br/>
 You know, and he looked at my nose and he said, "Now, I do see that there's drainage."
 I said, "I can confirm the drainage."<br/>
 He said, "That's what I think is going on."
 Poor baby.<br/>
 So you don't have a strap or flu.<br/>
 No.<br/>
 You just sound...<br/>
 No fever or not, nothing.<br/>
 So he said it's most likely allergies or some sort of low level cold.
 Whatever that is.<br/>
 You've taken up smoking and you haven't told anybody.
 Well, actually have a confession to me.
 I knew it.<br/>
 Cigars.<br/>
 All right, babe, let's do a weekly catch up.
 There's only one thing I want to mention this week that's worthy of
 including in our weekly recap.<br/>
 Is it the lovely meal I made for you?<br/>
 It is not that that is a close second.
 Oh, thank you, darling.<br/>
 It is the fact that I am Lord of Hyrule.
 After over 245 hours, I don't, I don't, I think the switch stops
 counting after 245 hours.<br/>
 Well, it's all be thankful.<br/>
 Because it said that last week, but, you know, over 245 hours later,
 I have finally completed the game.<br/>
 Let's imagine what else we could have done with 245 hours.
 I find the point now that there's a difference between finishing a game
 and completing a game.<br/>
 OK, what's the difference?<br/>
 Well, finishing the game is like finishing the story.
 It's what you're supposed to do.<br/>
 But completing it is what I want to do.
 Completing is where you go through every single puzzle that could possibly be there, whether you're rewarded for it or not.
 You're such a good doer.<br/>
 I am a great doer.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And this game was so beautiful, so rich, so enormous, so compelling, and really had like multiple games in one.
 So there was a fighting side to it.<br/>
 There was like, you know, a logic and reasoning side to it.
 There was like a puzzle side to it.<br/>
 There's a hide and seek side to it.<br/>
 There's a long meandering journey side to it.
 You get to cook.<br/>
 You do get to cook.<br/>
 Although you always point out I have no food.
 You never have food.<br/>
 I don't need it.<br/>
 Well, because you have all this armor,
 but then the kids think that they don't need it
 because you won't make food and they don't have the armor.
 And then they're like, I understand why I keep dying.
 I'm like, because you have no food.<br/>
 And they're learning a valuable life lesson.
 OK.<br/>
 It's parenting win via Zelda.<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 So I finished the game.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Months ago, didn't I?<br/>
 months ago, one, maybe weeks ago.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I mean, I finished a bit in terms of completing it.
 I only completed it last night.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And I was all excited because I think Friday night, Saturday morning, Friday night,
 I thought I'd completed it.<br/>
 I had all I had to do left was the compendium, which will you take a photo of every single thing
 and collect these 900 Korok seeds, which are literally little, you're playing hide and seek
 900 times.<br/>
 And sometimes you're just literally finding something stuck in a tree.
 Sometimes you're practicing your archery skills.
 Sometimes there's like puzzles you need to solve.
 They're all very, very simple, but there's 900 of them.
 And so it's very excited.<br/>
 And I called the whole family and we collected the last
 Korok seed.<br/>
 We're super excited.<br/>
 In fact, you got MJ out of bed to see the last Korok seed be collected.
 And then I realized I only had 899.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 No, we're the 900th was.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I'm discounted.<br/>
 The genius child.<br/>
 Yeah, Abigail, I don't want to go into the details of how because it's not going to be,
 there's going to be even less interesting than this particular segment as did nobody
 you've ever seen.<br/>
 It seems Zelda.<br/>
 But Abigail sussed out where I more than likely had not picked up the last Corox seed, found
 it, and was thrilled and then heartbroken because I thought it was going to have 100%,
 but I had someone like 99.45%.<br/>
 in addition to doing 120 shrines and killing all the bosses and all the sub bosses and collecting
 all 900 corks. You also had to visit every area on the map and activate that location. So we did
 the math and realized I was short five places. And God bless you, you sat by my side and we went
 through my encyclopedia and marked off what I had. How do you find them? And suffice to say I'm
 Now 100% I can retire with glory.<br/>
 Yeah, I'm not really motivated to do that, I think.
 Babe, there's 100% completionists and then there's slackers.
 Well, here's the thing.<br/>
 I only have like 157 of the 900 to Korok Seed so far.
 At one point, I too was 157 Korok Seeders.
 I know, but I feel like I've already spent, I don't know how many hours on this game.
 At some point, I have to just let it go.
 Let it go.<br/>
 Somebody asked me, what are you going to do now that you finished
 Zelda?<br/>
 I was like, I've got this great new game called filing my taxes.
 And the beauty of that game is it comes with the deadline.
 It does.<br/>
 And you also have the new game of finishing the finding father videos.
 My friend Will, who's also playing Zelda, and I've been texting him, you know, back and forth.
 And I said, "You know, Will, I've finished and celebrate with me."
 And he's like, "That's amazing.<br/>
 Now you're going to get around to finishing the finding father videos."
 I was like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm unsubscribing from all text messages."
 -And the people are waiting. -Mm-hmm.<br/>
 Anything else noteworthy happened this week?
 I don't think there was.<br/>
 It was just Zelda drinking from the keg of glory.
 Well, for other people, there was a tornado warning on Monday
 that we closed emanate for. And it was so uneventful, we didn't even see rain.
 Well, now here's the thing. Nashville has some pretty peculiar weather patterns.
 Yes.<br/>
 And rather than us trying to forecast and work out what we're going to do every time we have a
 service earlier this year, we decided we are just going to follow the closing patterns of
 Williamson County Schools. The county that we live in is Williamson County.
 and so we realize the schools have got way more stake than we do as a church and there's multiple schools
 and they listen to weather experts and so they make a call and just for simplicity say because it is
 difficult to get the message out to every single person. We just tell everybody do whatever Williamson
 County does now there are times when we think it's probably not going to happen i think would be okay
 but because we're not trying to so confusion we've just made a rule that if Williamson County schools
 cancel, then we cancel. And it just becomes way simpler because we can just train all our congregants,
 pay attention to Williamson County Schools because it's on TV, it's on Twitter, etc, etc, etc.
 So even on events like Monday, when the schools were dismissed at 1130 AM and we had to come home
 and pick up our kids, there is a chance they could have been crazy. I think actually some of the
 praying women in our church sent the, you know, the tornado away from us.
 That's what I think too.<br/>
 They were on their back porch just praying on the name of Jesus.
 Declaring a thing.<br/>
 But that was excitement momentarily.<br/>
 We have not died in our storm shelter.
 This house actually has one.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yes, well, we don't have a storm shelter,
 but we have a basement.
  </li><li>Well, excuse me.
  </li><li>I'm sorry.
  </li><li>We have a room that's but the size of a bowling alley,
 the three sides of it is underground with poured concrete.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>I don't just mean, you know, it's below ground level.
 I mean, it's literally underground.
  </li><li>Yes, that's true.
  </li><li>With like, I don't know,
 10 feet of poured concrete on every side.
 That's a storm shelter.
 We would be substantially safe.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 So thankfully we haven't needed to use it, but the kids are always excited.
 We're going to go down there.
 The kids are on March break this week.
 Yeah.
 And my grandma, no, my mother, not my grandmother.
 If your grandmother was here, I'd be freaked out.
 That'd be shocking.
 I'd be getting some holy water.
 Jesus, a number of years ago.
 My mother has come to be with the kids for a few weeks.
 You were 82 year old mother who drove from Toronto.
 Yes. Who had a hip replacement surgery, the tail end of last summer.
 Yes. She's amazing.
 I know. Yeah. She drove it in two days, seven hours, one day, seven hours
 next. Seven hours. Are you from Ireland?
 Are you on cough syrup?
 I am actually. I'm like trying to do something.
 So your mother got here. Our students are still on Irish all over the world.
 Hello, students. If you happen to be listening, we miss you.
 We love reading your reports on the blog and following on social media Tuesday night after the tornado that didn't happen
 We had all of the students who were not on outreach over to our house for dinner
 We did and it was really fun. How many pounds of meat do you think of barbecue?
 Probably six or eight the the barbecuing was easy the cutting up was hard
 It was yeah, we need a machine that a laser cutter
 You know, we need a robot that cuts meat.
 We have one that does our floors.
 Now we just need a robot that cuts meat.
 I'm on it.
 Well, you know, when you go to the supermarket and you get like a loaf of bread
 and then you just drop it in that kind of loaf slicer bread cutter.
 Yeah, there must be something like that for meat.
 And help me out.
 There's electric knives.
 Is that is that what you mean?
 I said to hold it and it takes too long.
 No, it's fast.
 Electric knives are pretty good.
 All right.
 Well, we'll get on a quick knife with a hedge
 streamer work. Wow. I want to go back to the laser idea. I think the laser idea could
 work. You know buying it. No podcast people help me out here. Talk to me about this morning
 service. It was amazing. We had these two guys come in. They had written a book and they
 were doing a bit of a tour and they are the one guy is a former corrupt cop who framed
 a young black man and sent him to prison for 10 years. And it's those two guys are now both
 living for Jesus, completely reconciled their friends. And it's the telling of their story
 and the power of forgiveness. It was amazing. It was incredible to listen.
 So good. Yeah. It was jaw dropping a time to listen to their story. I'll put link in the show.
 And I highly recommend you watch it. If you guys need a boost of it's all storytelling.
 and it's incredible and it will do wonders for your faith. And it's just so timely for our nation,
 I think, to hear a story of racial reconciliation with Jesus right in the middle of it.
 And I loved it. I bought their book. Yeah, I also thought it was really encouraging in that
 both of these boys, their moms had prayed for them, you know, when they were little and they'd
 both given their lives to the Lord, and both of them had totally walked in the opposite direction.
 And so it's just even for people that are praying for their kids that they're like,
 I don't understand, I sewed the gospel into them and now look at what their lives look like.
 I just, I felt like there was so much hope on it.
 Yeah, there's, there's so much takeaway. I think anybody in any situation
 could be uplifted by listening to them. So Lincoln show notes for you.
 Yeah.
 Our main topic this week is this whole notion about when God is fast and when God is slow.
 Yes, which is funny because I'm pretty sure he's always on time. What's like racing? God's never late, but he sure misses a few opportunities to be early. Yeah, sure feels like that doesn't.
 Well, I just thinking about like Revelation 22 verse 12, Jesus says behold, I'm coming quickly.
 It's kind of like by whose definition is quickly, right? Or 2 Peter 3, 8, where it says with the Lord, a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years like a day.
 And I was just thinking about when you,
 like so we're public speakers.
 So what we do for a living is we speak in public
 about our faith.
 And the danger when people listen to us
 is they're listening to us tell the highlights
 of maybe the last 20 or 30 years.
 And there's a danger they come away thinking
 your life must be like your stories all of the time.
 Yes.
 And I'm like, no.
 No, no, no, no, not at all.
 I learned that from the people who I now know as friends, but I grew up reading their books
 and thinking, "Wow, your life must have been like this constantly."
 I'm like, "Oh no, you have a totally normal life, just like me and everybody else."
 Same kind of challenges, same kind of need for patients.
 But it's been punctuated with events with the Lord.
 And that's kind of what I want to talk about tonight.
 There's two words for time in Scripture, which I don't really want to go into.
 the kranos and the kyros, the kranos being just the normal everyday passage of time
 and the kyros is kind of when God interrupts and sends everything in a new direction or
 with New Zealand or with new passion on it. And I'm thinking like, I remember when I met
 you and I was asking you, how did you get into full time ministry? Because when I met
 you, you were the darling of this church in revival. You were this daughter of the house.
 In fact, I met you a year before I ever met you.
 I came out to Toronto to one of the conferences.
 You were speaking at the conference.
 I wanted your workshop.
 I didn't know you.
 We'd never met.
 I didn't say hello to you.
 I mean, I just was a person at a conference listening
 to you teach and you were amazing.
 And I was thinking, oh my gosh,
 how did you become like this amazing and unguarded person?
 And you know, I'm listening to you speak
 at the end of one season.
 But I remember asking once I got to know you,
 and I think even before we were dating,
 I was asking, you know, how did you get into ministry?
 And you were telling that story of all the people who prophesied.
 Tell everybody that story.
 Well, I got a whole bunch of prophetic words in 94 about traveling the world
 and speaking and stuff.
 And in 94, you were in no shape to be doing anything.
 Is that right?
 Well, you know, emotionally no.
 Right.
 And even meant I didn't, I didn't really like speaking to people.
 So, you know, I mean, I was getting these words thinking, y'all are crazy.
 Like, I don't, I don't like travel.
 I don't like speaking to groups of people.
 And I don't want to do that.
 What were you doing?
 Like speaking of life, what were you doing for a job back in those days?
 I was waiting tables.
 So you were just, you, your life looked like getting up waiting tables and coming home.
 It looked like getting up, waiting tables and then coming to church because we were
 in revival.
 So everybody was at church tonight.
 Right.
 So that's what we were doing.
 And in my mind, I was going to go back to university.
 I'd done YWAM, just finished YWAM.
 I was going to go back to university.
 I was going to finish my degree and I was going to be a lawyer
 because I wanted to argue.
  </li><li>Okay, so-- - I wanted to get paid to argue.
  </li><li>So you have a normal, normal life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you're getting all these prophetic words.
  </li><li>All these prophetic words about
 ministering the gospel and the Lord using my testimony
 to heal others and that I'd be traveling all over the world.
 And I just remember thinking,
 I don't know how all of these major prophets are all missing it.
 And how many words do you think you got over what period of time?
 Well, I got five that first year, all from like,
 recognized prophets from the stage calling me out of a crowd.
 So five different people, five different times, all within a 12 month period.
 Yeah. And it wasn't like I was wearing red or fluorescent pink and hoping for
 prophetic word. I would like purposely wear beige and try and blend in.
 And would you ask in the Lord for any words or any direction for your life?
 I wasn't. Right.
 I really wasn't.
 I mean, all that, all those words to me were like,
 I can't even imagine how you could do that, God,
 'cause you'd have to totally change my heart.
  </li><li>And how long between getting those words
 and your first international trip?
  </li><li>I went with a couple of teams different places,
 but the first time I was traveling,
 me as the speaker was about eight years later.
  </li><li>So that's what I mean, like fast, God, slow God.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because for eight years, you're waiting tables.
 your life looks nothing like your prophetic words.
 There's no indication any of those words
 are gonna come to pass.
 And at least to begin with, your will isn't even in line
 with that, you're just thinking, man,
 they just missed it, they're all smoking the same drugs.
 And then we said to John.
  </li><li>And he just laughed at one, O-H-A.
  </li><li>And then moving in a ministry,
 like can you remember a time when the early part
 of those prophetic words began coming to pass?
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, I did sort of my first youth conference
 thing outside of speaking in Toronto,
 'cause I'd speak to the youth every once in a while,
 in I think '96 or '97.
 So that was about three years after the prophetic words.
  </li><li>But it looked nothing like the prophetic words.
 You're not an nation.
  </li><li>No, I mean, I was in Flint, Michigan,
 so I suppose I was in the nations,
 but yeah, I mean, it was sort of like, okay,
 And honestly, I felt awkward and I would get so nervous I would throw up before I spoke.
 And it just didn't look like what I thought those words meant.
 And then what about when you were, do you remember a time when you were thinking, I'm
 doing what those words said?
 Yeah.
 I mean, for a long season, they were five or six years.
 I mean, maybe three or four years.
 I worked in restaurants and then I got offered this job to work for National Car Rental.
 Again, that didn't look anything like what the words said, but that was an open door
 and it seemed like there was favor on it.
 I walked through that.
 But I remember meeting with the president and the vice president the day they interviewed
 me and I said, "I really believe in five years I'm going to be in full-time ministry,
 but I'll give you 120 percent while I'm here."
 and they said, "Yeah, we'll take it."
 And just before I ended up leaving National,
 I started getting a couple more invitations
 to go and try it and started feeling
 a little bit more like life,
 but it wasn't really till I stepped out.
  </li><li>'Cause didn't 9/11 happen,
 and then a couple of weeks later, you got laid off.
  </li><li>I lost my job the next day.
  </li><li>Who did?
  </li><li>Because the company lost time, aren't you?
  </li><li>$17 million in one day.
  </li><li>And they just started doing layoffs.
  </li><li>Yep, it's a rental company.
 So it's based on airports and all airports shut down.
 And one day they lost $17 million.
 And so I was middle management.
 I wasn't on the ground management anymore.
 I was in the middle.
 And I was the first one to get let go.
 And then he actually gave me 10 weeks severance.
 And I was about to quit.
 So it was like, I had already lined everything up
 because I felt like the Lord said in the fall
 year to go into full-time ministry.
  </li><li>When did he say that?
  </li><li>In January.
 So you're talking like seven years, you got those words the first year, and presumably you got like
 a little sprinkling every now and then for seven years. Yeah, I had a dream, the January following
 all those words where I was speaking at the sky dome and just giving my testimony and telling
 people about the love of God. See, people meet you today and see you're in full-time ministry
 and just think, I don't know. We all think crazy things. We just think, well, you know,
 you're fulfilling your calling. I'm not, I wish somebody would wave a magic wand over me.
 and I could be in my destiny. And you're like, your destiny is slowly carved out of stone using
 time. Like you head towards your prophetic words and time and opposition and patience and endurance
 and wisdom and servitude and long suffering and you know, all this sort of stuff, carves out what
 what your destiny looks like.
 And most people only see the end result and just think,
 oh, there was so many little yeses in there.
 There was, yes, still eating a small group
 and letting it teach there.
 There was, yes, to writing 30 sermons,
 even though I never knew if I'd use any of them.
  </li><li>You wrote 30 sermons before you ever on the road?
  </li><li>Yeah, I had a binder with 30 sermons in it.
 Just, I was like, Lord, if this is what you're calling me to,
 then I'm gonna prepare in that direction.
 You know, it was a whole bunch of little yeses.
 It was, "Hey, could you come speak to the youth and not being like, 'Ugh, youth,'
 but being like, 'Yes.'
 You know, I'm going to say, 'Yes, God, when you ask me to do something.'
 And then you being launched, I would imagine that happened quickly.
 It did.
 I mean, quickly, yes.
 The Lord in the January, I was fasting.
 And he had said, "This is the year you go into full-time ministry in the fall."
 And what was funny at that point is I was no longer longing to be in full-time ministry.
 I was like, "I like my job.
 I like my car.
 I had a free car, free gas, free insurance."
 You know, I was like, "Good God."
 You know, and I felt like the Lord said, "I'm going to confirm it three times."
 And I had three different recognized prophets come up to me and give me the exact same word
 about stepping off of a cliff and the rocks coming up to meet my feet.
 So by the time the third one happened, I thought, all right, I'll meet with Fred, I'll meet
 with John.
 I'll tell them this is what I feel like the Lord is saying.
 And surely one of them will have the good sense to shut me down and to say, you're not
 ready.
 And met with both of them.
 And, you know, Fred was like, this is amazing.
 I'm going to write a letter to all the partners and harvest churches.
 And I was like, wait, what?
 And I thought, okay, well, John, I'll stop this.
 That was the network of churches that Toronto was affiliated with.
 Yeah.
 Because it was scary.
 I was about to just have no income, no support, no nothing.
 And so I met with John and he was like, yes, AJ.
 And he said, you know, in a year and a half, you're going to be turning down invitations.
 You're going to be booked, you know, kind of thing.
 And I thought, okay, you know, you're an optimist, sure.
 You know, and then 9/11.
 And I was praying about Lord, when's the right timing?
 You know, it feels, I don't want to quit, but it's funny.
 We're coming up on five years at the place.
 And I was like, oh, you know, I don't know what the right time is.
 And then when they let me go, they actually paid me through the end of the year to be in ministry,
 because they paid out to the end of the year.
 And I was actually the only management that got that within two weeks, they let off 30 more managers.
 And they all got 10 days severance.
 I got 10 weeks.
 So.
 But when you went, you know, speaking to John and speaking to Fred and then saying,
 we think this is a great idea.
 A couple of weeks later, you're a conference and boom, you're, you're
 launched into international ministry.
 Boom.
 That's what I mean.
 Slow fast and people could be at the conference going.
 I don't, I don't know if people think like this, but like, well, you know, why
 she getting released?
 Why is she getting promoted?
 Why, why is she up there being advertised at this conference?
 And I know nobody sees the eight years before.
 They just.
 Eight years of being a youth leader.
 I mean, just, you know, just any place where I could say, yes, because John asked me to.
 I would say yes.
 Right.
 You know, any place because there was a need at the church, I would say yes.
 I think, um, I think about the parable of the five wise and the five foolish
 versions when I think about the fast, God, slow, God thing.
 Yeah.
 You know, so they're all there for a purpose to meet the bridegroom, but he's
 taken a long time.
 Yeah.
 And so, you know, five of them stay ready.
 And the other five are like, "Man, you know, it's been a long time."
 And they tune out and they get distracted and they just kind of opt out and then suddenly
 he comes.
 And I think a lot of life is about preparing for the suddenlies of God.
 Yeah.
 That slow God, that fast God.
 I mean, there's all these warnings in Scripture about when Christ returns, of course.
 But I'm just meaning, you know, you get all these prophetic words and you think, "Well,
 when is this going to happen?"
 And you realize, "Oh, we don't know."
 I think about Abraham and Isaac, the sun, just the word and the length of time between
 the fulfilments, astonishing.
 I did a brief Bible survey on this.
 This is my quick first past survey.
 28 times in Scripture, it uses the phrase in the course of time or sometime later.
 It's the same Hebrew there.
 So in the course of time, where sometimes they are indicating, in the passage of time
 as things move on.
 Eventually this thing happened.
 28 times compared with 18 times where there's a suddenly with the Lord.
 Yeah.
 I think we live our lives for the suddenly and in doing so we miss out in the course of time.
 Yeah.
 And I think we do our growing in the course of time, not in the suddenly necessarily.
 I mean, I'm sure we grow through a suddenly, but I would say most of the substantial growth
 is in the course of time.
 Right.
 I think God only hints at the sudden lies and speaks loudly about the course of times.
 Yeah.
 Like I remember being a school teacher and I felt like God who'd went into that.
 I did not want to be a school teacher.
 I had no desire to speak to children or adults of any kind.
 You know, I just wanted to lock myself in a server room and be a computer genius.
 Yeah.
 That's all I wanted to do was just be, you know, leave me alone.
 let me solve problems on my own and pay me handsomely for it.
 Yes.
 And I'm thinking that's going to be my life and it's going to be great.
 And I'm going to be really good at it.
 And then the Lord is like, no, I'd like you to be a school teacher.
 I'm like, are you?
 Are you serious?
 And, you know, I, so I went and did that.
 I went back to school, became a school teacher.
 And I tell it now.
 And it's a relatively short period.
 I was a school teacher for four years.
 But when I said yes to God, it wasn't a conditional.
 I'll do it for four years.
 it was like, "All right, I will do it."
 And then after one year and two years and three years
 and in the fourth year, I'm just thinking,
 "Lord, if what you have called me to do is be a teacher,
 "then I will be a teacher."
 And I thought it was a life sentence.
 I'm sorry to be so negative to all the teachers.
  </li><li>It wasn't a nice cushy school, was it?
  </li><li>Well, it was.
 I mean, it was, you know, if you turned right
 out of the school driveway,
 it was a really, really wealthy area.
 If you turned left, it was a really, really,
 not so wealthy area.
 So--
  </li><li>You had a good mix.
 was a rougher school that could have been in by all means. But my point was I didn't want to be
 a teacher. So I'm doing something I didn't want to do. And you know, being ground down to the point
 where I'm like, actually, Lord, if this is what I can do for the glory of God, if this is my role
 in building the kingdom of God on earth, then I say yes to it. And that's what I will do. But
 meantime, in my private devotions with the Lord, he's speaking to me all these prophetic words
 about my life that look nothing like what I'm doing.
 And I'm just thinking, am I making this up?
 Have I just got a fantastic imagination?
 Because I'm seeing myself traveling the world, I'm seeing myself speaking, I'm seeing myself
 teaching people how to heal the sick and how to hear the voice of God.
 I'm thinking about prophesying and dreams.
 It bears no reality to going to teach first and second your word processing the next day
 or, you know, a parent teacher conference. And yet it's the in the course of time that
 I think the Lord pays close, I think the Lord plays close attention to all. But it's the
 whole thing of who you are when no one's looking. Who are you when you're not getting your
 own way? Who are you when you're just doing what is before you? I'm a firm believer in
 blossoming where you're planted. Like make hay while the sun shines. Just who are you
 when your students threaten to throw you out the window? Yeah. Or hang me from the rafters
 by my belt. True story.
 That's why I thought you were in a rough school.
 I was like, they did what?
 Well, I did. I did have a class where they were like, we've given you the class
 and we've dubbed it will be in prison before we're 20.
 There was four, I think there was four boy students in that class.
 And I would pray in tongues before every time I'd see them.
 I'd see them three times a week.
 And I just go out of the blood of Jesus, the blood of Jesus, the blood of you that terrified me.
 Yeah, I didn't have that in my book of dreams.
 No.
 But I, and then all of a sudden, God's like, would you move to Toronto?
 And the suddenly of God comes in.
 And before you know it, I've sold all my possessions, I've resigned from my job.
 And I've moved to Toronto with no promise of anything I have today.
 Just my heart lapped at the thought of living in a warehouse in revival culture.
 I mean, literally I was as happy as could be.
 And I jump on a plane and I go to Toronto.
 And the very next week I meet you.
 Yeah.
 It's a crazy, isn't it? Imagine if you hadn't said all those little yeses before.
 Oh, no, I don't want to. But it gets me thinking in the periods of time where you feel like nothing
 is moving, I want to encourage everybody. Don't resent the slow side of God. I say slow in
 air quotes. You know, the Lord neither fast nor slow. He's just he's brilliant. Everything he does.
 But you know, fine wine takes a while to...
 What does wine do, brew? No, that's beer. What does wine do?
 Ferment. I suppose it does. Fine wine takes a while to age. Yes. Same with cheese, same with
 everything. Same with brilliant people. I, you know, I want to meet brilliant people. It's the
 result of years and years of hard work. Yeah. Not magic fairy dust. So I don't know, I hope
 that's encouraging to somebody out. I want to encourage you that God does move fast, God does move
 slow, leave the fast parts up to him and be brilliant and diligent in the slow parts.
 Yeah, he's doing something, so hang on.
 Or I have a listening question for you. Hit me.
 We'll do no such thing. Good answer.
 I will tell you the question.
 Okay, tell me the differentJoseph. 
 Hi, Joseph.
 He said, "I have a question about dream interpretation. I recently listened to Alan's
 messages on dreams and I very much appreciated your thoughts on them, and specifically,
 If I can hopefully correctly paraphrase a point that many people can interpret one dream many different ways.
 So my question is this, when you have a dream that you feel is from the Lord, do you ever seek outside counsel regarding its meaning?
 Or do you solely trust that the Holy Spirit alone will reveal its meaning to you?
 Joseph, we pretty much always bring it to other people and ask for interpretation.
 We have some people that, you know, we have access to that have some, some gifts in that area,
 but often we will run it by several different people and then just sort of see what the Holy
 Spirit lands on in terms of interpretation. Yeah, scripture says we know in part,
 we prophesy in part. So that's why I like getting lots of parts of revelation. I do want to address
 your paraphrase. I don't think that I said that many people can interpret one dream many different
 ways. I mean, maybe I did that's probably not the takeaway I wanted. I think scriptures
 clear do not interpretations belong to God. I want to be clear and scriptures very clear
 in that it says interpretations belong to God. If I'm asking lots of people, I'm asking
 the gifts that God's put in them for their perspective. And like I said, you know, we know
 in part, we see in part, and I'm trying to still what fits. I don't think that everybody can have
 have their own interpretation and, you know, I'm not into pluralism.
 I think God's very deliberate in what he says.
 But yeah, as AJ says, anytime I have a dream, I write down, I usually tell AJ,
 I run it by Jeff.
 There's again, a bunch of people in my life who are brilliant at dream interpretation.
 I love the journey.
 I love, it's like collecting 900 car ox seeds.
 I do not get frustrated by my dreams.
 I share it and I, you know, pontificate about it.
 I pray about it.
 I process it.
 I get lots of revelation from lots of people and take it back
 for the Lord and pray.
 So I hope that answers your question.
 But I love it.
 I love dreams and I'm fascinated by the content
 of mine and other peoples.
  </li><li>Good.
 Shall we wrap up?
  </li><li>Is your throat gonna last any much longer?
  </li><li>Not much longer, no.
  </li><li>All right.

 Pale you donuts and the kindness of God
 But things we deal with every day
