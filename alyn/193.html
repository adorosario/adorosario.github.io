<p> I live in a days but got for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is welcome to episode one ninety three of keeping up with the Jones is where this week we are talking about parenting.
 We actually record this on Mother's Day which is perfect timing it is perfect yet we had a good Mother's Day.
 Well, I don't know about good. I went to church with you and then promptly left church because as listeners can probably tell,
 I don't sound ideal. I sound even worse this morning. Jeff sent you home. He did.
 After watching you sweat in his office for like five minutes, he's like, hmm, maybe you should leave.
 Please leave. I've been six since Wednesday. Yes.
 And I swear this morning I felt well enough to come in. I am not one of those people that pushes through.
 I'm one of those people that hates when my colleagues come to work sick.
 So I'm not one of those people that just comes and I'm going to be fine.
 I don't do that.<br/>
 So this morning when I woke up, I don't know whether I was just on autopilot,
 but I got up, I had a shower, a shave, I was ready for the day and felt fine until I go in
 and you two looked at me.<br/>
 You and Jeff were like, "Uh, should you be here?"
 And then I was like, "I couldn't think of it.
 I still don't feel good."<br/>
 And then i'm watching you start sweating i was like yeah you probably need to go home you've spent all your energy for the day in the first half an hour.
 It's true yeah yeah i don't know what it is i went to the door on Wednesday because i thought my bestrap i woke up with a horrible throw.
 I mean i want to throw but very sore yeah i went to the doctor and they swapped me and they said it's negative strap and then they send away for you know to a lab to do.
 bacterial,<br/>
 stuff cultures.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 That all came back negative.<br/>
 So the dog just said you probably just have a fire.
 So take five to seven days to clear up, which is why I'm sleeping in the guest room,
 which is why you're sleeping in the guest room.
 But I sleep really well up there.<br/>
 I have to say it's nice and dark.<br/>
 It's the darkest room in the house.<br/>
 It is, but it's also isn't quite noisy.
 It is because the air conditioning is noisy, but it's no, it's definitely not as noisy as other
 noises that occur in our bedroom.<br/>
 Easy.<br/>
 Anyway, so yeah.<br/>
 Well, so I'm sorry because you were supposed to have a nice Mother's Day, but you ended
 up having to look after the kids making lunch.
 I'm looking after the kids.<br/>
 But I took you out tonight and we bought you.
 What do we buy you?<br/>
 Chocos.<br/>
 Now, I don't want to offend because lots of my friends wear these things, but they all
 look ridiculous.<br/>
 They do.<br/>
 But here's the thing.<br/>
 I love doing things like canoeing every time we go canoeing, which is only like once
 or twice every summer, granted, because of alumni trips and such.
 Yeah.<br/>
 I put on these $5 shoes from Walmart and they feel horrible and my feet get waterlogged the
 whole trip.<br/>
 And the whole time I'm thinking, "Why haven't I gotten better shoes when I do this?"
 And then I thought, "Actually, for gardening, my shoes are getting wrecked, gardening, and
 you can just spray off your feet."<br/>
 So I thought, "Actually, these are probably going to work pretty well for camping, for
 gardening."<br/>
 Yeah, for doing I'm not going to walk you because in the year maybe I have a pair of that's
 what I was thinking you never used to like camping and now camping expert.
 I wouldn't put it that far.<br/>
 Well camping enthusiast.<br/>
 Yeah, it's just the chockos the one that looks like you are keeping your big toe hostage.
 I just don't know how they're comfortable.
 Well, I don't I don't mind that, but they don't all have that.
 There's a lot of a lot of the guys ones don't have the hostage big toe.
 I just don't get it.<br/>
 You obviously haven't tried them on because I have to say having tried a pair on today
 for the first time ever, they fit your feet perfectly.
 It's like a glove.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I'm excited.<br/>
 I got really bright obnoxious colored ones too.
 You did.<br/>
 I tried to dissuade you.<br/>
 I was like, babe, what are you, what are you doing?
 Are you testing the limits of my love because it's Mother's Day?
 You actually said you were going to leave me when I was ordering them.
 That's it.<br/>
 I said, that's not funny.<br/>
 It's Mother's Day, so you took it back.
 (laughing)<br/>
 Oh dear.
</p><ul>
  <li>I know.
 It's funny that we're talking on Berending.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Maybe we should be talking on marriage.
 Maybe we should be getting counseling or something.
 Oh, but on the topic of parenting,
 guess what's coming up?
 The Grace Center Daddy Child Camping Trip.
 Oh yeah!
  </li><li>Did see that.
  </li><li>And I thought this is probably the first year
 where you'd be like, yeah, I'll go for that.
 I know how to do it.
 I think it's less about like when I go camping, it's on my terms in the middle of nowhere
 with generally speaking, nobody I know.
 Right.
 And the beauty of it is it's a completely introverted experience.
 Well, sort of with three children.
 Yeah, I know, but they're my three children.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 I know they come there.
 Yeah.
 Well, here's the thought though.
 Our massive tent, which is basically like our own mini hotel.
 Yeah.
 didn't have that when you went the last time you were trying to fit three of you in my two men.
 And it was a bit of a disaster. So actually you have the perfect setup to take all three
 children away camping so that I can have space to myself.
 Let me talk about it when I'm not running out of energy.
 Okay. Well, podcast listeners, pray. Okay. Yeah. Go ahead.
 Let's do our weekly catch up. Okay. Monday seems like a long, long time ago.
 It really does.
 But I spoke at Ammonet on the book of James.
 You did.
 It was great.
 Yeah, the book of James is amazing.
 It is.
 I was just talking about how there's just so much
 practical wisdom in that book just to live a God, the life.
 So that's what I did.
 I'll put a link in the show notes if you're interested.
 And then generally speaking, the rest of the week was just prep
 for the source conference and our normal meetings.
 Yeah, normal meetings.
 I'd probably add into that the building project.
 Yeah, tell us about the building project.
 So we're building a new Children's Ministry wing at Gray Center, which is super exciting.
 And so we're sort of putting our money where our mouth is and making an amazing space for kids.
 So I'm really excited about it.
 But the first thing that happens is the adults get new bathrooms so that we can
 demo the old bathrooms to be part of the Children's Ministry wing.
 Right.
 So they are almost complete and.
 It's been a labor of love for you, hasn't it?
 I love it.
 I love it.
 You're our staff liaison to the building committee.
 Yeah.
 So I'm not really doing much.
 I mean, I get to pick colors and stuff like that.
 But Dennis and Maury are killing it so good.
 But it's just really fun.
 It's like, I feel like every day I go in and it's like Christmas.
 I get to see what the new thing is that's done.
 So I know I'm getting a few Christmas here.
 Some industrial bathrooms.
 Just get me a table saw.
 OK.
 Mommy wants a table saw and some lumber.
 What is one of the chances that the bathrooms are going to be ready for the source conference?
 They're supposed to be ready for the source conference.
 Are we putting money on that? Like is there a wager?
 Well, I don't suppose so because that would be not a good thing to do. But it's looking good.
 The book of Robert says the law is cast into the law, but the decision belongs to the Lord.
 That was my justification for gambling or on that, by the way.
 You can use any scripture to nearly justify any behavior.
 Good heavens.
 Okay. Yeah, I don't know, but hopefully yes.
 Right. Good.
 Okay.
 I say that the rest of the week was spent prepping for source comforts.
 I got Monday, Tuesday and half of Wednesday down and then I was just sick for the rest of the week in bed.
 Yeah, you were pretty much useless.
 And then that brings us to Sunday, Mother's Day, which we've covered.
 And then you spoke at church on our core values.
 I did, which was super fun.
 So we've been downloading as it were or sharing a church what the Lord gave us in January as a team.
 And so we've been expounding on the mission and the vision statement and the core values.
 And it was super fun to teach on. There's a lot of life in the room.
 Yeah, you looked really pretty. I just watched you from home, of course.
 Yes. Well, thank you for watching. I think you should really study those core values.
 We've had lots of people ask us about the keto diet that we're on.
 Did we explain it last week? Or did we just assume every new one was?
 Do you know what? I don't know.
 So the keto diet, as I understand, and I guarantee this far more knowledgeable listeners about this
 than the Nino, but my basic understanding of it is normally our energy source as humans is carbohydrates,
 sugars, and that's what you burn, and that's where you get energy. When you do the ketogenic diet,
 you basically substitute carbids as a fuel for your body, and you get your fuel from fats or
 ketones. Yes. And in order to make that switch, you need to make sure that carbohydrates are
 a very small percentage of what you're eating. Right. So under 20%.
 Well, I'm doing like 5%. I'm sorry. I didn't mean percent under 20 carbs a day.
 Okay. Yeah. 20 total carbs. So, yeah, 5 to 10% at the max of carbs is your diet.
 Right. So what that means on any given day is, well, the way we do is we wake up and for breakfast,
 we have this, well you have coffee, I have hot cocoa,
 'cause I don't like coffee.
  </li><li>It's bulletproof coffee, it's growing on me,
 I don't love it still, but it's okay.
  </li><li>But the idea is you have your coffee, for example,
 or my hot chocolate, and to your coffee,
 you add no sugar, but you add two tablespoons
 of grass-fed organic butter, which sounds gross.
  </li><li>It does, it's unsalted.
  </li><li>Yes, unsalted, and some--
  </li><li>MCT oil.
 medium chain triglyceride oil.
 Yeah.
 And the idea is you're just loading your body up on fat.
 Yeah.
 And you drink that.
 And then you don't eat anything until one o'clock,
 which sounds torturous.
 But believe it or not, you are not hungry all morning.
 No, I mean, I preached twice this morning.
 Didn't think about food.
 Didn't feel hungry.
 It felt great.
 And then around one o'clock, you eat a meal that's
 mostly fat, some protein.
 And then you can have a snack any afternoon.
 Yep.
 So we've made fat bombs, which the winner so far is the chocolate chip cookie dough fat
 bomb.
 Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
 This does not sound like a diet.
 It doesn't.
 I know.
 And then for dinner, you eat something the same.
 And then we stop eating at 6 p.m. and don't eat anything again until to 1 p.m. the following
 day.
 Yeah.
 So there's intermittent fasting, there's very little carbs, there's lots of fat.
 That's my summary of it.
 But it's healthy fats.
 It's like grass fed butter and avocados.
 Avocados, fatty, meat, coconut oil, that kind of stuff.
 Yeah, and your grass fed and organic.
 So tell me about, are we being on it for a week and a half maybe?
 Yes.
 How have you felt?
 I feel amazing.
 Define amazing.
 I feel I have lots of energy.
 I feel really clear headed.
 I feel less grumpy.
 My stomach's not bugging me anymore.
 So yeah.
 I feel really good.
  </li><li>Are we allowed to ask you how much weight you've lost?
  </li><li>I've lost 10 pounds.
  </li><li>In a week and a bit.
  </li><li>Yeah, week and a bit.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And I've lost what, 12 and a bit pounds.
 And for my experience, I've done many diets over the years.
 And ironically, it can be quite disciplined
 in short periods of time.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You know what I mean?
 Like for the way I normally live,
 which is, you know, I'm on the seafood diet
 where I see food and I eat it.
 This thing is amazing in that it doesn't feel like hard work.
 It doesn't feel like you're dieting.
 You get to eat, or at least for me,
 the problem with paleo is none of the food I wanna eat,
 I can eat on paleo.
 Whereas pretty much all of the food I want to eat,
 I can eat on keto.
 And actually the food that I'm not allowed to eat,
 I don't have any cravings for.
 So the big thing for me is the sugar rollercoaster,
 the hive eating sugar and then the grumpy crash from not eating sugar and then the hunger
 pain where you want more sugar. That's vanished. And I just feel full all day. I have to remind
 myself to eat because I am full. And even when I feel hungry, it's a different kind
 of hunger than I was feeling before.
 But I don't really feel hungry. After we have dinner, even though we stay up until 10
 or 11 o'clock at night.
 I don't feel hungry.
 I don't need any food.
 So so I know we're only a week and a half in, but it is the easiest diet I have ever done.
 I agree.
 And I, I to feel sharper.
 I'll let you wouldn't think about the way I slow down trying to spill words.
 It else doesn't help.
 It also doesn't help diving sick, which could be the keto flu.
 Yes.
  </li><li>I explain keto flu.
  </li><li>That's a real thing.
 I don't really know if I can explain keto flu.
 It's just something that your body does in response
 to making such a big change.
 I think some of it is detox.
  </li><li>Undoubtedly.
  </li><li>And then some of it is your body learning
 to switch over to using ketones.
 So typically it's flu-like symptoms.
  </li><li>What about sleep?
 Aren't you sleeping amazing?
  </li><li>I am sleeping amazing.
  </li><li>My only problem is I've had two nights
 where I have been mentally wide awake and alert.
 which is not the norm.
 Thank you.
 But that could be because I've been sleeping all day because I've been sick
 and maybe I've just messed up my circadian rhythms and sleep.
 But anyway, love it so far.
 I give it two thumbs up.
 I mean, I'm enthusiastic about it.
 And if you like guacamole, this is the diet for you.
 No joke.
 That's all I'm eating in the moment.
 Yeah.
 So there we go.
 Hey, also, I met some podcast listeners today as I was coming out of REI.
 I love when that happens.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was really fun.
 They were lovely.
 They go to Lindo Cooley's church.
  </li><li>Good.
  </li><li>Yeah, really cool.
  </li><li>Perfect.
  </li><li>All right, our main topic for this week is parenting.
  </li><li>It is, it's true.
  </li><li>Now if you've joined us this week,
 or if you're new to keeping up with the Joneses,
 there's a danger that we can just assume
 that you know what our kids are like.
 But for reference, we have three children,
 two girls and a boy.
 We have, how old are they now?
 11, nearly nine in a couple of weeks and then a five-year-old.
 Okay.
 So our knowledge of parenting caps out 11 years old.
 We haven't done puberty.
 We haven't done teenage years.
 We haven't done adult children.
 So we know nothing about that.
 Yes.
 The, and we're not experts.
 The only thing we are experts on is raising our three kids.
 Right.
 The way we raised our kids.
 Yeah.
 And I just thought it would be fun while we were talking earlier.
 I just thought, what do you want to talk about in the podcast?
 and we're like, let's talk about parenting,
 because we've all been parented.
 You know, with Mother's Day,
 you're thinking about your mom.
 Yeah.
 I'm thinking about you as the mom of my kids.
 So it's kind of like a parenting vibe.
 Yes.
 One of the things that, again, this is my preamble
 and kind of disclaimers is, I don't think,
 I mean, maybe we're the worst judge of this,
 I don't think that we've been cavalier
 in our approach to having kids.
 And what I mean by that is,
 Sometimes I meet people who don't yet have kids and they just I roll.
 You know, when we're talking about, oh, or they find out they're pregnant,
 they just I roll when people try and talk to them about parenting and they're
 thinking, oh, this is going to be great.
 And then they have a baby.
 They're like, Oh, good God.
 I'm not prepared for this, right?
 By the way, nobody is.
 Right.
 But I don't think we were ever cavalier like, oh, this should be easy.
 No, but at the same time, we didn't go to the other extreme of this is going to
 be a dreadfully hard and whatnot.
 Because for whatever reason, people want to curse you.
 So you're not right, forget parenting.
 Remember when you get married, everyone's like,
 oh, the first year marriage is the hardest.
 Like how about that as a curse for going in a marriage?
  </li><li>You may take your monkey back.
 Thank you so much.
  </li><li>The same parenting.
 I remember when you were pregnant,
 everyone was like, well, get your sleep now,
 'cause you won't have anyone's a baby comes.
 And this would be the last lie in you'll ever have.
 Or I hope you said lots of money
 'cause they cost a fortune.
 And I don't know whether people are trying to be kind,
 But we didn't be, I don't think we were careful here, like, oh, that won't happen to us.
 And neither did we absorb everybody's curses.
 We just had confidence in God writing a story for us that it would be a good story.
 Cause it's a good storyteller.
 Right.
 It's a great way of putting it.
 I think that.
 And then also lots of our friends have just had kids.
 So we're loving watching them step into being parents and loving watching what happens to, you know, our friends
 as they move from husband and wife to mom and a dad.
 And just, you know, all the changes that it brings.
 I think it's beautiful.
 So.
  </li><li>It is really fun to see people's hearts expand like that.
 'Cause I think it's true to say you never realized
 you could love something so much
 until you have that little baby and you're like, wow.
 You know, and then it just,
 it works like that for everyone that comes after it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's amazing.
  </li><li>Well, that's right, 'cause you think,
 I've got this one baby, if I have another,
 how will I have any more love for it?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I can't imagine loving anything as much as I love this one.
  </li><li>Right, and it's not like you have one love tank
 that you split in half, now that you have two kids.
 It doesn't work like that.
 God just gives you more love.
  </li><li>All right, well, my first question to you,
 H. Jones, is when you were growing up,
 were you one of those girls that always wanted to be a mom?
  </li><li>I think yes, but I didn't dream about it.
 Like I didn't, I was gonna say I didn't pick up baby names
 and all that kind of stuff.
 I had one name, but I felt that that was from the Lord
 other than that.
  </li><li>No, I'm talking about when you were a kid.
  </li><li>Yeah, when I was a kid, no, not really.
  </li><li>Right, 'cause you grew up in a fairly intense environment.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>An abusive household.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So you probably weren't thinking, man,
 I can't wait till I have kids.
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>Right, so that was just out of your head
 until the Lord began to heal all that trauma.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Then you began to think about it.
  </li><li>Yeah, that was much later in life.
  </li><li>Yeah, I never thought about having kids,
 but then I never thought about anything I'm doing.
 Yeah.
 Nothing in your current life actually is what you thought you would be doing.
 Well, what I mean by that is before I owned a house, I never went to Home Depot or Lowe's
 or B&amp;Q or whatever your big home renovation store is never ever.
 Right.
 So it's not that I didn't care about.
 I just didn't think about it.
 I just wasn't on my landscape.
 Right.
 And the same when before we ever had our first child, I never went to Toys R Us or I never
 went to a baby shop or I had never, it just that whole world of strollers and, and
 cots and cribs and cart. It just, you know, it just wasn't there. Yeah. It's a bit like
 camping. I didn't know that REI existed until we went camping. I was like, gosh, look at
 all these, you know, things. And so I never thought about, I remember when we got married
 and how long were we married before we had our first child? Oh, well, let me think about
 two years. All right. So I remember you coming to me and saying, I think maybe it's time for us
 to try having a child. Yeah. Which I heard was, let's have more sex. And I was like, that sounds
 great. But no, I do. I remember you asking, what do you think? And I remember just kind of
 shrug on my shoulders like, yeah, I mean, I mean, I guess like I had no strong feelings either way.
 I was just like, I'm sure this will all work out. Yeah. Well, I was like, Hey, I'm 35.
 If we want to have more than one kid we probably need to start doing this thing.
 There's your little planner.
 I remember when we found out you were pregnant though.
 I remember then it got real in my head.
 I remember actually asking the Lord, I said, "Lord, if you do me a favor,
 it's not that I don't want a boy. I'm just scared to have a boy. I can do girls."
 That's interesting. Why is that?
 I think for a couple of reasons. One, I grew up with three sisters.
 So I was always comfortable with girls and also my youngest sister.
 Um, Claire, she was born when I was 10 years old.
 So I remember her and I remember looking after her and I remember baby,
 sing her and I remember changing her and, you know, I remember, and that,
 that seemed easy, but also I, I still didn't have a grid on what it meant to be a man.
 question mark, like a whole lot of stuff about the masculine role and fathering seemed scary
 when it was a boy, but seemed easy when it was a girl.
 That's really cool.
 And that's, and that's what I remember just saying, kind of freaking out a little bit,
 like Lord, I'd really love a girl just to practice on.
 Yeah.
 I think I have a head start with a girl.
 Yeah.
 And then can I have a boy later?
 It's kind of funny.
 We both came into marriage with two names that we wanted to have, didn't we?
 And I don't think we talked about it beforehand.
 No, we didn't talk about it until we were trying to get pregnant.
 I wanted a son called Micah.
 Yeah, so did I.
 And I wanted the daughter called Abigail.
 As did I.
 So it's really funny because we were like, OK, I guess.
 If we have a daughter, she'll be named Abigail.
 And if we have a son, he'll be called Micah.
 So Tia was a wild card name.
 Woo.
 Yeah, why did we end up calling her Tia?
 We couldn't decide on a name for Tia.
 We were just praying and, you know, with Abigail's name,
 even with her middle name and everything,
 I'd had that dream.
 And so we knew what to call her.
 And we knew we wanted to call her something
 Carol after Carol, or not.
 But we just didn't know what was gonna go with Carol.
 And I remember us talking and saying,
 well, we tried a whole bunch of different names.
 And one day I said something about,
 Well, what about Mia?
 And we were like, no, that's not it.
  </li><li>Right, I quite like Mia.
 And I remember I did some research
 at the University of Copenhagen.
 And the research assistant that I worked with,
 actually she wasn't my research assistant,
 she was a colleague of mine on the project we're working on.
 Her name was Pia, she was Danish.
 And I always thought that was a really pretty name, Pia and Mia.
 And then did you suggest Tia?
  </li><li>No, you did.
 I read we had talked about Mia and we were like, well, you know, Mia Carroll, like at least that's
 sort of kind of goes together, but I don't think that's it. And then you called me. I was at work
 and you were home with the kids. You were home with Abby and you said, what about Tia? And literally,
 it was like something just dropped. I went, that's it.
 We have an amazing memory. I have no recall of that. I just remember being in my office.
 That's why I remember. I'll take credit for the great Tia Carroll. So what was going into
 to parenting like for you then.
  </li><li>I think it was super exciting.
 I think, you know, thankfully I'd gone through
 an enormous amount of inner healing
 because I think I was afraid for a long season
 before I wanted to have kids.
 But when I would contemplate kids,
 I would think, man, like,
 I don't wanna put any kids through what I went through.
 So I don't think I should have them.
 and you were just worried that you would be that?
  </li><li>I don't know.
 I was worried that out of nowhere,
 all of a sudden I'd become angry or impatient
 or I don't know.
 I just thought I didn't really see a lot of things done great
 and so I just wasn't sure I'd be able to do it.
 I look at moms who's,
 they're just emulating what their moms did.
 They have these amazing moms
 and they're just being amazing moms themselves.
 And I had to almost research people.
 Like, you know, I remember when Abby was, you know,
 maybe a year, year and a half old,
 and I would watch other moms
 and how they would interact with their kids.
 And I would try and do that.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Because I was like, I don't know how to do this
 and I don't know how to play with stuff on the floor.
 And I don't know.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I would look for any healthy mom I could see around me.
 And then I would try and have like a play date with them or whatever.
 And I'd watch what they did with your kids and then I would try and do that.
 I love that.
 Yeah.
 I think one of the, the sweetest things I've ever learned from the inner healing
 move, John and Paul, Sanford, who are now both with the Lord, they, they were
 real pioneers in inner healing.
 They made a comment and they said that marriage is designed to kill you.
 As in, when you get married, God will use your spouse
 to refine the weaknesses in you.
 You'll use the weaknesses in them
 to refine the weaknesses in you.
 And so marriage really is a process of death.
 The sooner you understand that, the easier life will get for you.
 But kids, having kids is the opposite.
 Kids are designed to bring restoration
 and healing to your soul.
 And I saw that in you.
 Like when you had Abigail,
 like before you had Abigail,
 I'm not saying you weren't feminine.
 Of course you were feminine, but you weren't girly.
 No.
 I mean, I, I were only pretty much primary colors.
 You were a business professional feminine.
 Yes, black, gray, red.
 And once you had Abigail, that whole side just opened up to you.
 Yeah.
 Of nurture and of play and of creativity.
 Yeah.
 And of just this beautiful feminine side to you.
 Like I remember you one day you had your hair.
 The first time I ever saw you with a clasp in your hair, and one of our friends,
 Stuart and Anli, who were good friends of ours in Toronto, they just said,
 "What's AJ doing with her hair?"
 And I'm like, "I don't know what you're talking about."
 And you had like a little pink clasp and I was like, "Ah, your whole feminine side's coming out.
 I love this."
 Yeah, and it was funny because it felt literally like it was something that's
 happening from the inside out.
 So it felt foreign, but it felt okay.
 Does it make sense?
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I love that whole process.
 God's a genius with that.
 Yes.
 Just thinking back about noticing the changes that happened to you becoming a parent.
 Did you notice any changes in me as I became a parent?
 Yeah, I think you've gotten softer.
 Like you've always been physical touch and pretty cuddly and stuff like that.
 But I think because all three of our kids are like super cuddlers, you know,
 they just want to lie on top of you.
 They want to cuddle you.
 I think that side of you, I've seen come out a lot more where you're just really super cuddly.
 Do you ever do the thing where you remember what you most loved about being parented and then you do it to your kids?
 I don't really remember much of my childhood, so no.
 But you do.
 That's why I study other people. I'm still doing it. I'm just studying people with older kids now to try and get tips for going forward.
 But I mean a lot of your Christmas desires, the things you make me do at Christmas is because
 that elicits probably a few of the happy memories you had as child.
 I think, no, I don't think so. I think most of the Christmas stuff that we do is because we
 didn't do that stuff. Oh really? And so...
 Oh, I've always read that. Sorry about that.
 No, no, no, it's fine. I'll just bring up trauma.
 No, it's good. I mean, the only thing I remember at Christmas was sitting on my dad's
 lab and looking at the Sears toy catalog. But other than that, most of what we do is actually
 from things that I've heard from other people. And I thought, that's what I want my kids Christmas
 to be like. But the Jamison Christmas Eve, that wasn't your family's tradition.
 It was stolen. They're all stolen ideas that I thought, I love that idea. I want my kids to have
 So basically everybody around you is a walking Pinterest board.
 Yes.
 Yeah, I see that.
 We are blessed to live in a community with exceptional parents.
 Yeah.
 I mean, there's so many amazing healed up people that, you know, do things really well.
 Now you know, I'm observing you, but yeah, that you can learn from.
 It's great.
 I think that's a trick though.
 I think somehow, by osmosis, we think we're either good husbands or good fathers.
 And if we're not, then I guess we didn't get the gene.
 But the truth is you can design your marriage
 and design your family pretty much any way you want to really
 can you look and you think, I'd like to be more like that.
 Or I'd like to start doing that.
 Like we started doing family days and dates.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, I mean, at the start of this year,
 we sat down as a family and said,
 well, what do we want our core values to be as a family?
 Right.
 I mean, none of this is all new stuff, you know?
 Right.
 completely foreign to my childhood.
  </li><li>But we just watch and then steal and then implement.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I love that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I love it.
 Also, the thing I've learned,
 this is gonna sound terrible,
 is that kids are way more resilient than I'd ever thought.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, super resilient.
  </li><li>I think having learned all this stuff
 about inner healing at the back of your head,
 you're like, oh good God, I'm gonna mess up my children.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I think, and this is where I wanna be cautious
 because our kids haven't turned out yet.
 But I think in the times that we've been humble
 and owned our stuff in front of our kids,
 they've been very gracious and forgiving.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And that's Bill, enormous trust.
 I forget what it was the other day.
 It was Friday.
 Was it Friday or Thursday or Friday?
 I'm as sick as a dog.
 First thing in the morning,
 we're trying to get the kids on the school bus
 and I get them out and the bus is about to come.
 one of them runs back in because they've forgotten something.
 So I'm raising my voice like,
 "Why are you back in here?
 You're gonna miss the bus? Come on."
 You don't even need that.
 And it was a silly hat.
 And I didn't realize it was silly hat day
 or something like that at school.
 So I just thought they were just,
 I just thought that they were being foolish,
 that they were risking missing the bus
 for something of no great consequence.
 And so, I do that.
 And they were in the house and they got the bus
 and everything's fine.
 At night, while I'm putting them to bed,
 the child in question,
 I've completely forgotten about this event, by the way,
 this is now like five, six, seven, eight, nine hours later.
 I'm lying in bed, I'm saying good night to them.
 And they say, "Daddy, why was it such a big deal
 "that when I came back in the house,
 "you raised your voice at me?"
 And I was like, "First of all, I said this,
 "I said, first of all, I love how good you are
 at peacekeeping.
 I love that you haven't just let that slide,
 that you've come back and said,
 "Hey, can we talk about this?"
 I'm like, "I think that's amazing."
 And I'm like, "If I'm honest, daddy was just,
 it wasn't the best version of daddy."
  </li><li>Right, tired, not feeling good.
  </li><li>I hadn't slept well, I had four hours of sleep.
 I felt sick, I was really stressed,
 you're gonna miss the bus.
 I didn't understand that what you needed was important
 and I actually shouldn't have treated you that way.
 And would you forgive me?"
 And they're like, "Oh yeah, I just try and understand
 like what the problem was."
 And I'm like, I love, because I can never remember,
 I can't even imagine doing that in the environment I grew up in.
 Not even having to wear with all that I had a voice to be able to say,
 "Hey, can you help me understand?"
 Me either, yeah.
 And I think that's partly because we've been quick to apologize.
 It would be good to have our kids in here to see what they think about this,
 but they're all asleep.
 It's true.
 But I think I remember Derek Prince saying,
 I wouldn't have the ministry I had if I, he was talking about one incident with
 I think 15 or 16 year old daughter where he was wrong and he went and apologized to her.
 And I think like later in life, the Lord said, you wouldn't have the ministry you have if
 you hadn't humbled yourself in front of your daughter that way.
 Yeah.
 So yeah, I think if we're humble, kids are way more resilient than we give them credit for.
 For sure.
 For sure.
 What do you think have been the big challenges?
 The big challenge is, I was going to say the big challenge is that it's not a nine to five
 jobs, it's a 24/7, but actually the grace is there 24/7.
 Yeah, that's true.
 The big challenges are it's a bit like when you get married, you have a new appreciation for
 how selfish you are.
 Yes.
 Like before you're married, you have no clue how selfish you are, because your time is yours
 to spend as you wish and your money is yours to spend as you wish.
 Yeah.
 There's nobody else with an opinion, so there's no contrast to make.
 and then when you get married you're like, "Oh, I just want my own weight all the time."
 All the time.
 Wow.
 And so then you like, "Wow."
 And we thought it was that selfish.
 Like, "Gosh."
 And so then you work through that and then you think you're good and you're fair.
 And then you have a baby.
 You have kids.
 And you're just like, "Oh, I don't get to spend my time the way I want to."
 And it's not even a soft launch into that because infants, I mean newborns, you know.
 They don't rationalize.
 No, they don't rationalize.
 and in many ways it is all about them for that season.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>And you may want to sleep or you may want to do whatever,
 but that really doesn't matter right now.
  </li><li>But that's why their head smells so good.
 It's like catnip for new parents.
  </li><li>So you don't eat them?
  </li><li>No, you just smell their heads and you're like,
 "Okay, take me to your leader, I'll do anything."
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Challenges, yeah, I think you have a new pre-station
 for yourself, for sure.
 I think you're tireder because your enthusiasm is always up.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I mean, yeah, like my mom, and we did a podcast with my mom about about parenting.
 I'll put a link to in the show notes.
 My mom was an amazing mother and her philosophy, which she got from her mother was you just
 love your kids really, really well.
 You never let I love you be a guessing game.
 You never let them question whether they're loved.
 So you just attack them with affection all the time.
 So my mum was high words of affirmation.
 My mum was high physical touch.
 And so, and high quality time.
 So that's what I think, that's been my philosophy.
 I'm just trying to, I tell my, I think to the point where it's like, we know, I just
 tell my kids all the time, I love you.
 You're amazing.
 You're my favorite.
 Every room is better when you walk into it.
 amazing, you're beautiful, you're talented, daddy loves you. Oh, I just, everything you
 do is amazing. I'll never stop loving. I'm just like, that's my, and I don't feel like
 I'm like mentally have to do that. That just naturally comes, I think probably because
 of what my mum put inside of me. Yeah. And then also, cuddles like, I just, I'm trying
 to, and I don't know if this is going to backfire and be creepy, but I'm trying to get them
 to kind of sign contracts that when they're in their teenage years and their early twenties
 and their late twenties that they're still going to want cuddles.
 Okay, you're having those legally written up, right?
 Yeah, I'm having my attorney just make that happen because it's some of the favorite
 moments. But although it's my favorite moments, like every morning, our kids come down to
 seven o'clock and they wake us up. They come down all sweet and climb in a bed and we all
 cuddle. Now seven o'clock in the morning is not the best time for me to do anything.
 Yeah. I'm barely awake. Right. And I have to remind myself, this is a cherished moment.
 I won't have it forever. This is amazing. Yeah. But take it as long as I can get it.
 We put that in them. And so now they have a craving for it. So I don't know. That doesn't
 sound like a challenge. No, that's where I'm a joy. I think the challenge is being an introvert
 And really in the moments when you know,
 actually I would be a better version of me,
 if I could have some time on my own, but I can't.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so I now have to be that better version of me,
 even though I can't have the time
 that would make me feel full.
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>It does.
 And you saying that makes me realize
 that the biggest challenge of parenting
 is that I'm not always the best version of myself.
 And that makes me sad.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 always as kind or as compassionate or as softly spoken as I'd like to be.
 So I'm not always available for my kids as much as I would like to be.
 Like the other, you know, I love that all my kids love playing Nintendo Switch.
 Nintendo Switch in our house, like MJ saying, would you come play Donkey
 Kong with me?
 Is the equivalent of a kid saying, Dad, would you come and shoot hoops with me?
 Or would you come and play, you know, soccer or football with me?
 I'm just thankful that they're not into that because that would be
 labor of love.
 Will you come play soccer with me?
 What's soccer?
 Would you come shoot hoops?
 We don't have a hoop.
 I have to explain to you, Daddy has no hand-eye coordination, so I don't know if that's
 going to happen.
 But you must have, because you can play video games.
 Yeah, that's different, I'm sure.
 Okay.
 But even having said that, like video games are something I love to do.
 Yeah.
 But it's not always enjoyable playing video games with a five-year-old.
 Right.
 Because, yeah, you might be a bit much different place.
 But I have to remind myself, this is amazing for him.
 Yeah.
 He is loving every moment of this, even if it's not short.
 for me. So that's, I think that's hard. You know, all of your best version of yourself.
 Yeah, I agree. What about, um, biggest joys? I mean, I think you already touched on one of them. I love
 how cuddly our kids are. Um, and I love watching them respond to God.
 That all three of them have a relationship with the Lord and clearly hear from him
 and are just kids before the Lord. They're not sophisticated. They're not whatever, but they see
 stuff and they hear stuff and it's amazing to watch.
 Yeah, I love watching them manifest values that are important to me.
 So I love, I love, I've always loved this about Tia. Tia is so stinking discerning.
 Yes, she is.
 And I'm sure I should have socialized her out with this particular thing, but if she doesn't
 trust somebody, she will not go near them and she will not hide it.
 And I'm like, actually, I'm not going to train you out with that because that's a valuable life
 skill.
 Yeah. Well, it's funny because in the south, you're supposed to just be polite, you know.
 Yeah, don't get me wrong. She's polite, but if she's polite, if she sees somebody she
 doesn't trust or if somebody tries to curry favor and they want something, I mean, she can spot
 an agenda 50 paces and we'll just shut that.
  </li><li>She's having none of it.
  </li><li>And I'm like, you know what?
 I love that.
 I love watching Abigail grow into prophetic words.
 Like all of them had prophetic words before they were born.
 And I love watching them move into those prophetic words
 in very early stages.
 And we've been cautious not to try and push them into things
 but at the same time not to talk them out with them.
 So Abigail, there's a huge thing on her for negotiation.
 which, you know, can give a straighten because it sure can at times.
 But at the same time, that's one of the words over her life that she's going to be a skilled
 peacekeeper and bring in peace and is going to be through negotiations.
 So trying to foster that in her.
 But I love, I love, they're at the stage where they want to be teachable and that makes me
 very happy.
 Yeah.
 And they're all at such different stages right now that it's really fun to just celebrate
 each one where they're at.
 like Abby is this, you know, she's preteen and she's, you know, for her birthday, she
 wanted to get clothes and, you know, makeup and things like that as opposed to toys.
 And so she's just sort of switching into this different creature, but it's quite fun to
 watch, isn't it?
 And Tia is still like, you know, she's, yeah, she's looking at Abby going, what do you
 want to get clothes for?
 They'll buy us clothes.
 I want toys, you know, which is just so cute.
 an MJ is just all boy is knee wants to wrestle and just all boy is more than constant affirmation
 for everything he does which I love.
 Yeah.
 I think that is amazing that he is not hiding his desire for affirmation, not trying to
 manipulate out who just straight up asks, do you like my glasses?
 Any man, he'll just say, hey, do you like my shorts?
 Hey, what do you think my hat?
 Hey, my sunglasses cool?
 And I'm like, oh son, I love that.
 You just, you go be you.
 I think that's, that's amazing.
 Yeah. And he's learned to whistle and snap while sort of
 whistled. He hasn't learned a whistle. He's making a noise.
 He's making a noise while sticking his fingers in his mouth to
 pretend he's whistling, but he has learned to snap. And so he
 likes to show people that to you. I have a question for you.
 Yeah. What one thing are you glad to you now know that you
 wish you had known before?
 Well, one thing, am I glad I now know? I think that God will
 give you the wisdom for everything that you need.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, I, again, I felt like I was coming
 into parenting handicapped.
 And, you know, that I was gonna be
 either dreadful at it or just constantly behind the eight ball.
 And, you know, the Holy Spirit is such a good trainer
 that in the moments when we really don't know what to do
 and there's nobody else to look at or follow,
 you know, he's great at saying,
 "Hey, this is what's going on."
 or hey, go and do this, or hey, go and apologize,
 or just go and connect, you know, whatever.
 So I think, I didn't realize how much God wants
 to be a part of our parenting journey.
  </li><li>Right. - Yeah.
  </li><li>I think for me it's that discipline
 isn't always punishment.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>That sometimes as a parent, you wanna be soft
 because you don't wanna discipline,
 but you know, if the Bible starts anything,
 that's folly. I remember Chip Judd, who's one of our heroes, he just said, "When you
 don't follow through on discipline, you're teaching your kid a terrible, terrible lesson."
 Yeah, you're teaching and to ignore you.
 So, tonight, we're out for dinner to celebrate you and we're at one of our favorite restaurants,
 and MJ's got ants in his pants. He's sitting to my right. He will not eat his food. He's
 like, squirming around on the chair. He's office chair. He's climbing on. He's sideways.
 he's pushed his chair back and he's not eating his food.
 And so I just said, honey, I've asked you twice now, I need you to sit on that chair.
 If you stop eating or you play on that chair, you're going to stand for the rest of night.
 So he's like, OK, well, 30 seconds later, you know, he's off his chair.
 So I said, hey, could you just push your chair to the side?
 He's like, why?
 I was like, oh, you've lost your chair.
 So now you just get to eat, stand and up.
 And in that, like, there's no shame.
 There's no, like, you're bad.
 Well, you know, I'm not shaming him.
 I'm not ridiculing him.
 I'm just letting a consequence fall out.
 And so he just stands and now he's standing next to me and he's eating his play.
 And so I just put my hand up his shirt and I just like rub his back, just stroke his
 back like I do.
 And I'm just keeping my love on.
 I'm keeping affectionate.
 I'm not saying, I'm not saying you're punished because you're bad.
 I'm saying, Oh, this is a consequence of your choice.
 Right.
 And I love, I absolutely love.
 Separating like this punitive heart from an action of discipline.
 Yeah, I think that's such a powerful lesson.
 And I wish I'd learned that way, way earlier, but letting the kids feel the consequences
 of their actions without needing to hold over their head.
 Like the, you know, the other thing, our girls often go to school and they don't
 take responsibility for the room.
 So they don't check that, you know, their beds are made, that the lights are off
 or all that sort of stuff.
 And then just get in the bus and then typically I go through the rooms and I'm,
 you know, after a while, I'm like, why am I picking up after my kids?
 they're thinking self-dressed.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're old enough now.
  </li><li>And turn off all their lights
 and their closet light and their bathroom lighting.
 So just to say, guys, a new rule,
 for every light that you leave on,
 you lose an hour of your iPad or your iPhone.
 So they're like, oh, okay.
 So the first day they left like five lights on.
 So I was like, when they came in, they were like,
 yeah, yeah, I was like, hey, guys,
 you get your iPhones in two and a half hours.
 And they're like, well, why?
 I was like, well, between the two of you,
 you last five of your lights on.
 So that's two and a half hour each.
 And they're like, oh, yeah, remember.
 And I'm not I'm not loarding over them like aha see I knew you never like you know I'm not trying to speak word purses
 I'm just land the consequence follow their actions and
 Within about like three days. What do you know? They're turning out lights. Yeah, but that's a trick
 I think because I was raised and I don't think my I don't know if my parents meant to do this or not but
 It felt like my parents were waiting for me to trip up to point out. Ah ha you tripped up. Ah ha see now is your punishment
 And I could already knows they're being punished.
 I don't think you need to make a song and dance about it.
 So,
 separating consequence from punishment as a tool of discipline is really powerful.
 I was just thinking, we were telling that story.
 I was thinking about, you know, how I said, I used to watch people and then sort
 of learn from them about how to play.
 Yeah.
 Cause I never really was good at playing or I don't have any memories of playing as a
 child.
 Um, but I had this memory of when we first.
 came to Grace Center and Abby was at that stage where she wanted to pretend that she
 was talking on the phone to you all the time.
 Yeah, what's a phone stage?
 And so, you know, you'd hold something up to your face and she'd hold something up to
 her face and, you know, or she'd hand you the phone and you had to pretend you were
 having a conversation.
 And I honestly, I mean, it sounds funny, I just didn't know how to do it, you know,
 so I would be like, "Hello?
 Yep, here's Abigail and I'd hand it back," you know.
 And then she'd hand it back and I'd be like, "Hello?"
  </li><li>Wrong number.
  </li><li>Okay, see you later.
 You know, like, and then one day she did the same thing,
 she handed it to Jeff.
 And I remember Jeff having this whole like
 really animated conversation, like, what?
 It's where?
 Well, that's amazing.
 And he went through this whole thing,
 and I'm watching him in absolute awe,
 thinking it never occurred to me,
 like, to use any storytelling skills,
 to use any, like I just thought this is just a thing
 where we hand something back and forth.
 And she was, she loved it.
 Like she giggled and she thought it was amazing.
 And I was like, oh, okay.
 So that's what you do.
 And I guess my thought was, you know,
 if you find yourself in the place where you're like,
 you know, I don't really,
 I haven't retained very many memories of my childhood,
 or maybe they weren't great memories,
 or you feel like, gosh, I don't know how skilled
 I'm gonna be at this.
  </li><li>Right.
 God is a healer first of all, you know, and when we ask him to step into our world and
 step into our midst, he brings healing in all kinds of areas, but also he can train us,
 you know, he can re-teach us, re-parent us so that we're actually able to be the kind
 of parents we want to be.
 Yeah, that's so true, babe.
 I mean, we're not coming up with a list or anything, but another thing that I've learned
 to do is is kind of the flip side of what you're seeing is not to compare.
 Because comparison just leads to I'm the worst parent alive.
 Right.
 Right.
 But to be able to be in a community with amazing parents, like I think about
 Jonathan and Tiffany's ais.
 Yeah.
 Like I follow them on Instagram.
 And when I see them doing stuff with their boys, I'm like, Oh my gosh, like
 you're parenting geniuses. And then I usually implement some sort of half art, nowhere near
 as good aversion. But if I allow myself to think, man, I suck as a parent because I haven't
 done this. I allow myself to be inspired. But somehow I've learned not to criticize myself in
 the moment. So yeah, comparison is never going to produce good fruit. Inspiration will, though.
 Yes. Yeah. And I think that's the challenge when you see something on Instagram and you see,
 like to go, wow, that's a great idea. I'm going to try that with my kids, which I often do,
 both with Tiffany and Jonathan and others, you know, just like, wow, that's amazing.
 A lot of my stolen ideas are from those things, you know, but yeah, it's also the challenge of
 realizing, okay, I don't want to enter into comparison. I can just use this as a jumping off point for
 creativity with my kids. And, you know, every parent has hard moments. And when none of us
 Instagram the hard moments. We only Instagram the victories as it were or the really hilarious
 flops, right? So I think too, just speaking to your own heart, you know what, you're doing a really
 good job. Well, I think that's all our thoughts on parenting for today.
 Yeah, there's your jumbled thought on parenting wasn't very well organized. But you know,
 hopefully that's a somehow to somebody. And again, we are by no means experts at all,
 other than on our own experiences of raising our kids and let's just say that we're better parents the third time than we are the first time for sure,
 like per abigail like you need to ask for grace because we practiced on you.
 Yeah, but then by the end of your third you know, I'm just eating dog food and I don't even care.
 That is true.
 Well, we don't have to.
 I'm just thinking about the amount of effort we took to teach abigally alphabet versus M.J. teaching M.J. to, well, he'll figure out.
 That's fine.
 That's what they have school for.
 Oh, help.
 I know.
 Yeah.
 All right, we have a ton of listeners questions.
 You guys have been so good at sending them in.
 But as you can probably hear from my voice, my energy is fading just as my voice is.
 So we're going to push pause and answering listeners questions.
 I'm sorry, you've got so many of them.
 In fact, some of them were so good.
 I've sought expert counsel on them because I didn't feel qualified enough to answer that.
 Maybe next week we should do an all listeners question podcast or something.
 Well, here's the thing next week.
 We're going to be coming out of the source conference.
 So who knows what next week is going to look like.
 Oh, that's true.
 That's true.
 So that's not promising.
 We're not promising anything.
 So wrapping up, speaking of the source conference is happening this week.
 And we're so excited.
 Both of us are actually going to be speaking at the conference.
 Yeah.
 Jeff and I are going to be tag teaming the leadership track.
 And then, AJ, you're speaking the final night of the conference.
 You're doing the whole conference session.
 Yeah.
 If you are in town visiting for the conference, please come say hi.
 We'd love to connect.
 We'd love to say hi.
 And if you can't make it and you would love to have made it, we won't be live streaming the conference.
 but after the conference is over, you will be able to get MP3 sessions of all the conference.
 And if you're, I don't want to say you're impatient, but if you're really keen, you could pre-register
 for the conference, even if you're from out of the country and you'll get all the MP3 sessions free,
 you don't have to wait for them to be sold after the conference. But we're really, well, I'd
 listen to them from Alaska say, "Hey, I've bought a ticket so that I can get all the MP3s at this
 That's so perfect.
 Or price, I'm like, you're a genius.
 Well done.
 So that's our podcast for this week.

 They have to be complete by then with references.
 And if you're thinking about doing your two,
 go ahead and start your app.
 We'd love to get some more time with you.
  </li><li>All right, thank you so much for tuning in.
 It'd be great to spend some time with you.
 And hopefully we'll be here this time next week with a better sounding voice.
