<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome back to Keeping Up With the Joneses, episode 202, AJ Jones.
 How the heck are you?<br/>
 202, what?<br/>
 What?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 I'm good, too.<br/>
 He's saying very good.<br/>
 You look very cute.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 We're excited to be back.<br/>
 Last week we were talking about the Bible.
 This week we're going to be talking about the Holy Spirit with our friend Steve Long.
 first give me the weekly catch up.<br/>
 Well, let's see on the school I spoke on Sunchip on year two and you spoke on sexual
 wholeness on year one.<br/>
 Yeah, it didn't help that MJ got a vomiting bug Monday night so that threw Tuesday into
 a little bit of confusion where we swapped things around.
 We did but we made it work.<br/>
 Thank you, Gloria Staff and flexible students.
 It was very sad because I don't think he's ever thrown up before.
 He didn't seem to know what was really happening in the middle of the night.
 He was shaking like a little tiny leaf.
 It was so sad.<br/>
 I didn't know what was happening in the middle of the night.
 You are the vomit king.<br/>
 You are so great at cleaning up vomit.
 I applaud you.<br/>
 I heal you.<br/>
 You're the hero.<br/>
 I don't know what comes over me.<br/>
 I'm normally the person that's just going to wretch at the thought.
 So this is not pleasant.<br/>
 I apologize.<br/>
 But for whatever reason, in the middle of the night, I was Mr. Let's go get some bleach
 towels and I actually just threw out his pillow.
 I just looked at him like, that's not going to be redeemed.
 We'll buy another promo case.<br/>
 Got to go.<br/>
 And then I was teaching him first year on sexual wholeness, which is always a fun
 week question mark.<br/>
 It's, you know, you can't teach that topic in any other way than.
 For line.<br/>
 Well, that's.<br/>
 For choice.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Yeah, you can teach that topic by being around the bush.
 So you just come out and be frank and blunt and God bless you.
 First year students, you did very well.
 Stay engaged with me.<br/>
 And then it's fall break.<br/>
 It was.<br/>
 Yeah, it was fall break.<br/>
 So we went away camping.<br/>
 Yeah, our kids were off school.<br/>
 And so we took some days of vacation and we went away camping again.
 Yeah, what worked really well.<br/>
 Tell me what would be your, what's a year's retrospective on you've been
 camping for a year now.<br/>
 What is your wisdom or thoughts?<br/>
 Hard to believe this hardened man of the woods has only been camping in nature for a year.
 Isn't it though?<br/>
 I have pictures that would just really show how hard you are.
 I love it.<br/>
 I don't know why I love it because on the surface, it's the antithesis of everything
 that is me, but I tell you what, I love.
 I love the fact that we are outdoors.<br/>
 For the whole time that you're out, you're breathing fresh air.
 That's got to be good for you.<br/>
 If nothing else, I feel so much less stressed when I come back.
 I think because your only responsibilities are to make sure everybody is warm and well fed.
 Yeah. Fire and food. It just reduces your responsibilities to almost nothing.
 Yes. And we're getting into the swing of things. We are.
 We're. Yeah. There's a bunch of things you can buy that makes your life way easier.
 And we're slowly collecting the things that we need slash want for our glamping lifestyle.
 It's kind of ridiculous because we realized this was going to be the last camping trip of the season.
 So apparently what good campers do is when they come back and they're going to be putting their stuff into storage,
 you're supposed to air out everything to make sure everything is completely dry.
 So we came home and I set up our tent in our basement just to kind of air out and dry out.
 Yes.<br/>
 And when I set up indoors, I was like, "Good Lord, this is a massive tent."
 It's huge tent.<br/>
 It's colossal.<br/>
 It fills the whole living area of our downstairs basement and that's a massive room. Yes
 And so yeah our tent is no joke, but now I'd love
 You come home. You're physically tired, but you were emotionally rested. So absolutely love it
 And you were the fire king this weekend. I don't I don't know
 What I did differently. I did the same thing I did all the time and previously the fires never stayed lit
 If I did the same thing this Saturday night
 We had some folks over and we had a fire in our backyard
 And I did exactly the same thing I've done all weekend and yet the fire wouldn't take
 Until the very end of the night when we were spreading it out to pack it down and put it out and then all of a sudden
 It took fire is fickle send me your campfire tips people. I need it for next year
 I need to know how to do that anyway great week glad to be away glad to be back glad to have our good friends
 Steve Long with us.<br/>
 Thank you, sir.<br/>
 Good to be here again.<br/>
 And Miss AJ.<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
 You've just flown in literally flown in.
 We took you for pizza.<br/>
 The Sanos pizza, big.<br/>
 That was quite good.<br/>
 Yeah, the crust is exceptional.<br/>
 It is incredible, isn't it?<br/>
 I think we just had this conversation in the car, but I think the taste of Brazilian
 pizzas is still there.<br/>
 But the crust of this place was worth going.
 I don't know.<br/>
 I Brazilian pizza.<br/>
 I don't they put very strange things on their pizza.
 You can think it.<br/>
 It can be eaten.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Yes, that's my concern.<br/>
 So Steve, you are uniquely qualified to talk about the Holy Spirit for a number of reasons,
 but you started out life.<br/>
 For those of you who haven't heard, Steve, we'll put a link in the show.
 It's the last time Steve was on the show.
 But Steve, you started out as a the equivalent of a Southern Baptist pastor.
 Conservative Evangelical.<br/>
 Conservative Evangelical.<br/>
 And then we weren't on speaking terms of the Holy Spirit.
 You didn't know he was talking.<br/>
 We didn't talk to him.<br/>
 He didn't talk to us.<br/>
 He thought he was napping or something maybe.
 It was the Trinity, you know, the father, son and Holy Word.
 That's correct.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And then you end up, and you can tell your story in a minute, but you end up,
 and currently you're the senior leader of Catch the Fire.
 And you go from being a Baptist pastor to helping lead a revival
 led by the Holy Spirit in what was arguably one of the most controversial churches in the church today,
 known for all of the, how should we put it?
 In a very common crazy stuff of the Holy Spirit.
 I would put the commas in their rightful place rather than inverted.
 Talk to us.<br/>
 Tell us your journey.<br/>
 I mean, start wherever you want, but this whole session is all about the Holy Spirit.
 And so tell us some stories.<br/>
 Right. Well, the journey began by my brother Richard, who is a Baptist pastor in the city of Toronto,
 conservative Baptist. And Richard's a little, he's a year younger than me, but I would say he's a
 more intellectual kind of guy, he's a thinker. And it turned out that the church that he was
 pastoring, he got there without knowing that it was a charismatic church.
 The surprise.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 The sheriff's manager.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 And so they sent him to a vineyard conference with John
 Wember in California.<br/>
 And he came back speaking in tongues.<br/>
 And in our denomination, that meant that he should be doing the honorable
 thing and resigned.<br/>
 And if anyone heard that he was doing that, we would report him to head office
 and he'd be fired.<br/>
 Like take your papers and all that kind of thing.
 Except that the church, that's what they wanted.
 So they don't want to fire him.<br/>
 This was what they wanted.<br/>
 So now he's sharing that with Sandra and I and we're a little bit compromised because we're loyal
 to our denomination. We love our denomination, but clearly we love my brother more. And Richard
 began to feed me books to read. And one of them was Jack Deere's surprise by the power of the
 spirit. That was probably the first one I read, read one by John White, all about the Kansas City
 prophets. I remember reading that. That was quite interesting. Anyways, Jack Deere was
 my first introduction to the things of the Holy Spirit and just very neatly, theologically
 presenting that the Holy Spirit was very real and not to be afraid of. So I have that in
 my head and now our Baptist Church that we're at, the senior pastor is open to the things
 the spirit. And we know all about John Arnott and the
 the Vineyard Church by the airport in Toronto. And we began to go to some of their pastors days,
 have yet to have an experience. But we're there, we're listening, we're watching.
 And then when the Holy Spirit came that weekend in January 1994, John Arnott phoned me on
 the Monday afternoon, which would be January 25 and said, Steve, we just had the best weekend
 in the life of our church. The church was five years old. We had to carry people out.
 Well, that was the clincher that I needed to go to the one and only extra meeting with Randy Clark,
 because we'd never seen anyone being carried out. We tried to push them in, pull them in,
 but not carry them out. And so Sandra and I went. We sat in the back row, John and
 and Freel, who are the senior pastors we worked with there, now based in Richmond, Virginia.
 They were there. And my brother Richard and his wife, Terry, were there. We all sat in the back row.
 And Sandra and I met the Holy Spirit for the very first time. We watched. It was quite
 outside of our norm. The worship was fine. But people were manifesting before the meeting began.
 That was a little awkward. Explain that for people who might not know what you mean by manifesting.
 Do you know Peter Jackson?<br/>
 I mean, I know Peter Jackson, but they probably won't.
 Very fact that AJ started to giggle is a clue. Peter, I would say probably laughed for the first 10
 years of the revival meetings where he just was full of the Holy Spirit to the place of joy.
 Just he can't help laughing. Well, he's laughing before the meeting. He's falling down,
 trying to stand up falls over again.<br/>
 And everyone around him that knew him, this was very outside of Peter's behavior.
 And so they're just in shock that God's doing this.
 For me, who's never met him before, he's a, he's drawing attention to himself.
 He's manipulating everybody, like all those presumptions that you
 right when you think you know what's going on and someone else's heart.
 Never met him before.<br/>
 So that's distracting.<br/>
 Anyways, worship's going on.<br/>
 John and Carol lead the meeting well.<br/>
 Randy does a sermon, the very same sermon that he'd done on the Thursday night.
 And we decided we would watch and the prayer team's ministering for about an hour.
 People are clearly meeting God.<br/>
 They're falling down.<br/>
 They're crying.<br/>
 They're laughing.<br/>
 They're shaking.<br/>
 They look to be unconscious.<br/>
 In many cases didn't know that that was the piece of God.
 So you're, you're not acquainted with this sort of behavior.
 No, no.<br/>
 Have you even heard of people doing this?
</p><ul>
  <li>Yep, yeah, heard of it.
 They would be called Pentecostals
 and we didn't want to be one of them.
  </li><li>Right, so you're on the back row,
 auditioning for the flesh, please.
 You're working out, you know,
 your radar's pretty high up,
 you're deeply suspicious.
 And yet you trust, you must trust John at some point
 'cause you've-
  </li><li>Trust to John, absolutely.
 And my brother is there as well.
 And he's trying to explain to us what may be happening.
 This is past his-
  </li><li>Grid.
  </li><li>His grid, his normative as well.
 So you're all watching, you're just watching with interest
 and then what happens?
  </li><li>And then the prayer team ran out of people
 who came to the front for prayer.
 This is now a problem.
 (laughs)
 Because they now start to pray for the people in the seats
 and AJ how many rows would there been?
 Eight rows of people?
  </li><li>Yeah, but that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So.
  </li><li>So you're not back on the background?
  </li><li>We're in the back row.
  </li><li>Well, it wasn't that big a church.
  </li><li>No, it wasn't.
 It was a big square.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>No place to hide.
 Yeah, so we, when we see that,
 Sandra and I decide it's time to go.
 Babysitters was the excuse, but really word,
 we don't want to join this club yet.
 And Randy sauce, leaving, putting our coats on,
 and he ran to the back because on the way in,
 as John passed our row, he just stopped and said,
 "Hey, Randy, these are my Baptist friends that I invited."
 So that's all Randy's heard, Baptist friends,
 Randy used to be a Baptist as well.
 Right.
 So when Randy sees us putting our coats on, we've not come forward.
 He runs to the back and says, guys, can I pray for you?
 And now you have that awkward.
 What do you do?
 Because if you say no, you really look like you're, you know, white trash or whatever it is.
 Resistant, highly resistant.
 Yeah.
 And if you say, yes, we don't know what's going to happen.
 And I would say Sandra and I were not at a good place with the Lord.
 We were very, very dry.
 I was only reading my Bible to prepare sermons.
 Didn't like praying.
 Very critical of Sandra.
 Lots of impatience, lots of anger issues.
 And if anyone needed to be refreshed, it was us.
 And so Randy starts praying and Sandra stops him.
 And he says, "Sander, what's the problem?
 I've got my eyes closed, so I don't know what's going on."
 And she says, I don't want to fall down.
 And Randy says, why would you say that?
 And she said, because I was about to fall down.
 It's like, I'm thinking, Oh, no, Sanders.
 They've got her.
 Aliens of some kind of reach down.
 And that was disconcerting, because this was like two seconds into his prayer.
 And she's feeling the Holy Spirit.
 And that.
 So he said, Randy said, I'm not even touching you.
 And that made it worse.
 Like it's like, Oh my goodness.
 This is real.
 And I had a, Ellen, I had a conscious decision that I knew if I let him keep
 praying, if I put my hands out in front of me, like everyone else was doing,
 that my life would change.
 And I was willing for that.
 And so close my eyes again, put my hands out.
 Next thing I know I'm on the floor.
 I'm experiencing the Holy Spirit in peace for the very first time.
 Wow.
 Don't know how long I was down 20 minutes or so.
 I wasn't, I didn't know the protocols.
 when you get up. Right. That's the truth. I, I, it depends on if Carol's watching or not.
 That's, that's the protocol. Yeah, I don't even know if I've met Carol at that point yet.
 And just felt wonderful on the floor. Eventually got up. It was a silent ride home. What do you say
 to your wife? Would neither of you have experienced the Holy Spirit before? Like what's the talking
 point. And it was awkward because we knew that something had happened, but we weren't
 really sure what had happened. Neither of us was speaking in tongues. That wasn't what
 happened. It was just both of us felt peace. The next morning, I had a inclination to read
 the book of Acts, and I read the whole book, and I saw verses, words that I had never seen
 before. And all of a sudden, I saw the Holy Spirit all the way through the book of Acts.
 it was like I've missed out.
 And it was very helpful that our senior pastor, John Frill, and his wife,
 Anne were there as well, experienced the very same things and had the deepest
 experience of everybody.
 She cried, had some major forgiveness issues that she had to pray through to
 forgive people.
 And then she got drunk with the Holy Spirit.
 And so on our, in our church, we began the journey of just being open to the
 things of the Holy Spirit.
 We had Randy come and preach one night.
 And we jumped in right away and 10 days in.
 So we went on a Monday, January 25,
 on that next Sunday, six days later, the 31st.
 I got a phone call around midnight from John Freel
 to say that John had been to the Sunday night meeting
 and Randy Clark, sorry, not Randy, John Arnott
 and John Freel had a conversation
 that perhaps if the meeting was gonna go another week
 they needed an organizer to help them organize.
 'cause Vineyard were never famous for organizing.
  </li><li>That's a nice way.
  </li><li>And they needed a good Baptist to do that.
 So both of them knew that in my journaling
 from six months earlier,
 the Holy Spirit had spoken to me to say
 that I was supposed to be working with John Arnott.
 I'd already met John and told him that.
 John sort of blew me off.
 John Freo, the pastor I was working with, knew that.
 And so I was volunteered to go and help organize
 another week of revival meetings.
 And the thought was I would be there as long as they were having nightly meetings.
 And that turned out to be 12 years.
 And the Baptist paid the first five months.
 Amazing.
 Yeah, just had to show up at the Baptist Church on Sunday mornings.
 And the first Sunday morning afterwards, all we did different, we were will a
 Cree church, Bill Hybels, a secret friendly church, very good at reaching people,
 people, people getting saved, slow journey, but consistently people getting born again.
 And we did one thing different that Sunday morning at the opening prayer, we said,
 "Holy Spirit, you're welcome here." That's all we did. And during worship, one of the vocalists
 fell down. A couple of other people in the seats during worship, seeing the very same songs we'd
 done before, start shaking, falling to the ground. And we had a non-seeker-friendly service.
  </li><li>Definitely.
  </li><li>But people got born again that Sunday because it turns out,
 Booker Krenthen says that when people speak in tongues,
 they're gonna think you're crazy,
 but when there's prophecy going on,
 their hearts will be open
 and they're gonna know that God's in the house.
 And so that's what happened.
 So our experience, AJ and Ellen,
 was it would be like a little child experiencing ice cream
 for the very first time meeting the Holy Spirit
 wonderful. It turned out to be not as scary as we thought it was and love the Holy Spirit.
 Knowing what you know now and with the language that you have now, how would you describe your
 relationship with the Holy Spirit pre that meeting when when Randi and his team prayed for you?
 Because of course you're you're born of the Holy Spirit, you've been born again,
 you're a follower of Jesus, you're a pastor of a church. I mean you know the Holy Spirit, come on,
 You know, you know, you've been a seminary.
 How would you describe now what you knew or didn't know them?
 I don't think that I knew that he was a person as much as I do now.
 I think before he was more of a entity, he was a force as opposed to a real person.
 Didn't realize that he's a friend.
 Didn't realize that he is supposed to be your best friend.
 Jesus, the words that he uses in John 14, 15, 16 is he's a teacher, he's a
 comforter, he's a helper. So I didn't know any of those words relating to the
 Holy Spirit. I would see the Holy Spirit as being the power of God, the
 anointing of God, more his actions as opposed to his personality.
 And why do you think that in one sense, the Holy Spirit is being the best
 kept secret in the church, you know, in various stages of church history. But why do you think
 the Holy Spirit had been relegated in your church background, my church background, our
 lives as a result to this? We don't talk about why the Holy Spirit was relegated to a backseat
 when we need him so much.
 Well, I think the quick answer is that that's part of the deception of Satan is to keep people
 from the deepest experience that you could have in life is to trick you that you need
 to be afraid of this rather than embrace this.
 And so if you're afraid, you're not going to step in.
 And guys, you remember, AJ, you were there, that John Arnic kept saying, kept reminding
 people that if you've had friends to tell you don't come to these meetings, like people
 were afraid. And John kept saying like, how big is your dot? Are you do you have do you have more
 faith, how do you say that? AJ more faith in a his ability to lead you then than Satan's ability
 to just TV? That's it. Yeah. Yeah. And so that made sense logically, but everything in me was
 be afraid, be unsure and because it was new. And we had in Bible school heard all the reasons for
 not being baptized in the Holy Spirit in the way that the Pentecostals, Charismatics,
 believed it to me. So we talked our way out of experiences and we were very against
 experiences. We were all about intellectual knowledge. And so when you discount a person
 and you discount the fruit of the Spirit or all emotions, aren't they? Love, joy, peace,
 etc. They're not intellectual theories that you're believing they're
 their experiences that you're supposed to have. And so we were taught to
 don't go after your experiences and dada dada. And it turns out that's a big
 line. God's consistently showing himself to every single person in the
 Bible. That's a positive example. He's showing himself being real, being
 personable and experiential.
 That's really cool. I think just, you know, with what you just said and you said earlier,
 you realized you were really dry, you know, that you were coming into this meeting going,
 wow, I'm dry and I'm critical and I'm whatever makes sense if the Holy Spirit doesn't actually
 get to breathe on you that you would get dried up even though you have all the information as it
 were, that your brain wants or well, it turns out that not being filled with the Holy Spirit means
 that you are not being filled with the Holy Spirit.
 It's profoundly simple.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so when Paul says, keep on being filled with the Holy Spirit,
 the reason you have to be keep on being filled
 is if you're not being filled, you're getting dry.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>You're dehydrating, if I can say it like that.
 You're using up the Holy Spirit.
 I don't know how that works,
 but we have to be continually saying, come Holy Spirit.
 We've had lots of people guys over the years
 to say, why did your church experience what it did? And my best answer so far is that John
 and Carol, John and Carol Arnett, our founding pastors say, come Holy Spirit more than any
 other church in the world does. Now I can't prove that. But that's my guess is that John
 and Carol kept saying come Holy Spirit. And he found a place he found a home. He found
 people that were willing to receive him and hang out with him, not be embarrassed by some
 of the goofy stuff that happens and goofy stuff happens.
 And they didn't just say it at church.
 They said it at home, right?
 Absolutely.
 I think you think about who they are.
 Yeah.
 Spent two, three hours every morning or almost every morning that year in '93 of welcoming
 Holy Spirit and pursuing him, they would travel around America, around Canada.
 So, they would go to Rodney Harrow Brown meetings hearing that he was releasing the Holy Spirit,
 Benny Hinn meetings.
 They went to Argentina, saw Claudio Freezin.
 Wherever the Holy Spirit was, they were hungry.
 And it turned out the hungry get fed, the hungry, the thirsty, get to drink.
 Yeah.
 So, your high gifts of administration, you're a great teacher.
 Thank you.
 The Baptist Church is now paying you to work at, like I said, the most controversial church at that time.
 And so you're getting baptized, literally. You're throwing the deep end of Holy Spirit activity.
 Talk to me about some of the things you learned real quick in those days that you did not know about the Holy Spirit, just from interacting with Him, interacting with people.
 I found out very quickly that when I began to listen to the thoughts, the impressions that I had that those were far better than my notes were.
 For example, I think in '94, January '94, we had five conferences, six conferences, like boom, this church went from 150 people coming to a conference to 5,000 at the catch of our conference.
 And the God thoughts that I would have, the dreams that I would have, the times when I clearly knew that the Holy Spirit is speaking to me, that that was far more profound than anything that I had had in my notes for how you plan, how you do this, how you do that, what the books would say.
 say, and the Lord was giving me shortcuts.
 He was solving problems before that problem showed itself.
 And so I just knew how to do stuff right away.
 And I love that being an organizer.
 The best part of being an organizer is finishing the task.
 Yes.
 And if you can cut three steps out because you just get to the finish
 finish line quicker, well, that's the best part of being an organizer is it's,
 you know, connect all the dots.
 And how Holy Spirit was doing that?
 How did you learn to trust those thoughts?
 Rather, I mean, you had to give up some element of control there.
 The Lord asked me to get rid of my notes.
 OK, so I had, for example, if you're going to plan a conference, I would have
 a list of, say, 75 to 100 different things that have to be done.
 And once you got to check beside this, that's done, that's done, that's done.
 And the Holy Spirit asked me to delete every single file I had, every piece of paper.
 I got rid of everything because I heard him say, get rid of your notes.
 I'll teach you how to do it.
 That was scary.
 Oh, yeah.
 That sounds terrifying.
 Well, I was good at it.
 Like I was the organizer for our Baptist denomination.
 I did our national convention.
 I did our provincial convention be like a state convention for our Baptist churches.
 And that's why I lived to check marks.
 And now it's like, am I going to remember all the things
 and the Holy Spirit helped me.
 The next big one, Alan, was when the Holy Spirit told me
 not to have notes for my sermon.
  </li><li>Whoa.
  </li><li>Like no notes.
 Don't prepare ahead of time even.
 Just listen to me.
 And so I remember the first time I went on a ministry trip
 to England and my first place to preach was with Trevor
 and Sharon Baker and Dudley.
 I don't know if you remember those guys.
  </li><li>I do, yeah.
  </li><li>And they had something like seven years of weekend,
 Holy Spirit meetings every weekend and in Dudley,
 just outside Birmingham.
 And I can remember being introduced and standing up
 and still not knowing what I'm gonna talk about.
 And I heard the Holy Spirit say,
 "Open your mouth and I'll fill it."
 And so I stood up and after thanking my guests,
 not my guests, my hosts for welcoming me,
 I said, "I'd like you to turn on your Bible too."
 And a thought came and I said it.
 And I looked at the passage to find out what I was going to be preaching on.
 And off we go.
 And so that's how, you know, I, this was very, very different for me from being very
 organized, very strategic, I'm still strategic, but very, very different how it
 comes.
 It's now revelatory information rather than processed information.
 Hmm.
 I have a funny, uh, beginning of revival type question for you.
 Did you ever have to explain to the hotels like the regal constellation, things like
 that about what they were seeing in their front lobbies because there would be bodies
 everywhere?
 They believed it faster than the Christians did because most of them would be secular
 people.
 So I can remember going in to check in one of our guest speakers.
 I would check in them ahead of time like you guys do for me so that when the guest comes,
 we just take them straight to the room and there's their gift basket and da da da da.
 I'm lining up and a Muslim gentleman, his name is Harun.
 He works at one of the other hotels now by the airport.
 So I've known Harun for 25 years.
 And as I'm in line, maybe two people back and the check-in desk, the regal constellation
 is 800 rooms, big hotel, big lobby.
 And I'm at the front desk.
 There's maybe three check-in staff there.
 And there's a very open restaurant with a very low wall.
 So it's not even a wall, it's sort of like, you know, bushes.
 So you can look into the restaurant, you can see, and people from, we had a standing order
 of 500 rooms every night, under the 800 that we had reserved for our guests.
 And people were always seeing someone that they've met at the revival meetings or just
 seen them or watching them pray before they gave, you know, giving thanks for their meal
 and nodding at them and winking or just waving seeing another Christian.
 And that would be enough that people would be falling over at the breakfast buffet, food
 everywhere, those kinds of things happened all the time.
 Well, this particular day, I'm in line to check in a guest.
 Haroon sees me.
 The lady in front of me goes up to Haroon and incomes or two people come into the room,
 to the lobby, just walk into the lobby and they're on their faces shaking.
 I don't even know if they were believers or not, but they're on the on their
 floor shaking and none of the hotel staff are doing anything.
 They're just walking by ignoring them.
 Right.
 And this lady's freaking out and she goes, isn't someone going to
 call ambulance and a Muslim gentleman says, Oh, no, that's just the Holy Spirit.
 And I just stood there, said nothing, and just enjoyed because they figured it out.
 Right.
 They figured out that this means money for us.
 And that hotel made millions of dollars and did not care.
 Did not care that the concierge many nights is putting people in a wheelchair out of a taxi.
 I'm pushing them up to their room, taking them to their room, tucking them in the bed and heading back down for the next taxi.
 What about, where are there people from your old life who didn't make the jump, who were
 skeptical, critical?
 What did you, how did you parcel that?
 Well, here's one of the ironies, Alan, is when Sandra and I had our experience, we had
 already let our denomination know that we, we felt our time was up and our Baptist structure
 with John and Anne Freel.
 And so the norm would be that you'd tell your head office and that they would be keeping
 their ears and eyes open for another church where you may be a good fit.
 So we weren't placed, but we were, if a church has a need for a pastor, they would call the
 head office and say, "Can you give us five, ten names?"
 And so you start the interviewing process and things like that.
 And the one place that our Baptist denomination wanted Sandra and I to do because we had a
 history of church planting.
 They wanted us to go and start a church and they named the guy who's a retired pastor
 and he's got a little group of like 15 people who started a Bible study, but he wants someone
 younger.
 We were in our mid 30s.
 He wants someone younger to be the pastor.
 And we just said, no thanks.
 We're going to go to the airport church.
 So that was a little scandal right there.
 But it turned out that that gentleman was one of the harshest critics of the revival
 and would come night after night as he's researching to write a book
 about the negative things of the airport church.
 I realized, you know, I recognized him, sat down with him, talked to him.
 He never once said that he was writing a book, but I knew that he was.
 The Holy Spirit told me.
 And so one day I just said, by the way, on your book, any of the questions
 that you that you have, I don't want you to make the mistake of writing something.
 And it turns out you didn't check your facts.
 And so any things that you need to check your facts on, I'm very happy for you to
 we can have coffee together and you can just run by all your questions.
 That was the last I saw them.
 But he still wrote his back.
 Nope. Nope.
 I think he realized that he didn't have the facts and he would be.
 He would have been a guy of integrity that want to be accurate.
 And I think he realized that his bias, his theological bias
 just caused him to see things very negatively.
 And that's that's the way that I used to be before I met the Holy Spirit.
 Was assumed that people being full of the Holy Spirit, that it's flesh, that it's weak
 personalities, it's desperate people.
 People that need a crutch.
 All that kind of stuff.
 Yeah.
 Turns out that the world's best leaders need the Holy Spirit.
 Right.
 Whenever we're recording a podcast, I like to think of me before I met the Holy Spirit, somebody
 who is to the best of their ability, trying to follow the Lord, and are maybe
 interested enough to listen to this, but maybe have no grid for it, no experience.
 What would you say to a person like that who is saying, I hear your testimony.
 I can't fly to Toronto and have you pray for me.
 How does a Christian get more of the Holy Spirit?
 How do they experience the Holy Spirit as a person, not just the Holy Spirit as a
 theology?
 What do you say to somebody who's asking that question?
 It's a good one because like, how do you explain a kiss?
 The best way to explain a kiss is to have a kiss, isn't it?
 Because you're the concept of you rubbing your lips repeatedly against someone else's lips.
 And, you know, if you think about it as a little kid, it's all the germs.
 You know, you're going to get girl cooties or guy cooties or whatever those, those things are.
 But it turns out that a romantic kiss is one of the best things going.
 I agree.
 And that's the way it is with the Holy Spirit.
 So until you begin to taste and see that the Lord is good, you, you, you just don't know.
 So one of the things that I've tried to help people, I love going to evangelical churches and being
 invited to speak on the Holy Spirit and the passages that I usually go to the most are the passages
 where Jesus talks about the Holy Spirit.
 So John 14 15 16. And the analogies that Jesus gives the teaching, the simplicity that his whole
 ministry was based on him experiencing him being led by the Holy Spirit. And nobody, no Christian,
 is going to say that Jesus was weird. He's our example. He's the best of the best of the best.
 And Jesus' secret was that He was constantly hearing the Holy Spirit.
 So like seven times in John's gospel, when it comes to miracles and healings,
 Jesus says, I can do nothing by myself.
 I can only do what I see.
 Can only do what I hear.
 Can only do what the Spirit tells my spirit.
 What I'm taught.
 So clearly, Jesus has a relationship with the Holy Spirit.
 That's very, very deep, but is intangible until you experience it.
 So the best way to receive the Holy Spirit is to just welcome the Holy Spirit.
 And I would say if you can have a friend who can lay hands on you and impart the Holy Spirit,
 because somehow that always goes better. Like fire gets caught easily from taking a log that
 is already on fire and attaching another log to it, putting it on side by side and all of a sudden
 and the other log catches fire.
 So if you have a friend that loves the Holy Spirit
 and have them pray for you,
 there's a very good chance that you'll begin to feel
 and experience the Holy Spirit through that friend.
  </li><li>Can we try something?
 Can we have our listeners lay hands on themselves
 and you pray for them?
  </li><li>Absolutely, probably we'll work.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Let's try that then.
 Can you pray for us and our listeners
 to receive more of the Holy Spirit?
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
 So friends, I'd like you just to close your eyes.
 And the closing of you don't have to close your eyes,
 but the closing of your eyes helps me to concentrate
 and not be distracted by whatever else is going on.
 And if it's all right, I'm just gonna pray a prayer
 for those of you that are a little uneasy.
 So Holy Spirit, would you come and make this an easy process?
 We're asking Father that just like Jesus said
 that when we ask for a fish, that that's what we get from God.
 We don't get any kind of counterfeit ever.
 It's impossible to get a counterfeit from God,
 is what Jesus said.
 And so, Father, for our friends that are listening right now,
 may they begin to feel and experience your spirit,
 the Holy Spirit.
 Now I want you just to be very at peace
 and not necessarily trying to figure out what's going on,
 but just be a receiver, be a sponge.
 Holy Spirit, would you come?
 Now, because I'm listening, I'm here in the Holy Spirit.
 Tell me what some of you are feeling.
 So some of you right now are feeling buzzing in your hands.
 A couple of you are feeling buzzing in your feet.
 That's the Holy Spirit.
 That's a power surge of the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
 You remember when Jesus touched that lady who was bleeding for 12 years,
 the Bible says that Jesus felt power in his body.
 that was the sign to him that something miraculous had happened.
 And so that's very normal is when people are feeling the Holy Spirit.
 They feel a tingling, a buzzing.
 And some of you, you're not going to see it, but your face right now is feeling peace.
 And muscles that have been tense are beginning to just be loosened because of God's peace
 that's with you, his presence that's with you.
 And some of you are starting to cry.
 And that's God's love.
 God's love is bypassing your head and going straight to your spirit.
 So Father, we welcome the Holy Spirit to connect with each person's spirit.
 Deep as part of each of you is not your brain.
 It's a poor processor of God.
 Your spirit is the best processor of God.
 And this is your knower.
 You don't know why you know, but you know that's the Holy Spirit.
 So Spirit of God, would you come?
 Would you bring cleansing?
 Would you bring purifying?
 Holy Spirit, would you bring your love to us?
 your fire to us. We welcome you Holy Spirit.
 AJ, what are you feeling?
 Just peace really like a blanket.
 Ella, I'm getting a little bit tipsy.
 I have my eyes closed. So I wasn't watching.
 I had my eyes closed and I was like, this could be a mistake.
 I was thinking about all of our podcast listeners that listen
 while they're driving on the treadmill.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>That could be a small, low problem.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>You mentioned Jack Deere's excellent book
 Surprised by the Power of the Holy Spirit.
 Or Surprised by the Power of the Spirit,
 I think is the actual title.
 Jack is with us this weekend at Grace Center,
 our Heaven declares conference.
 If you have not got your ticket and you're in town,
 you can go to graceinner.us and get information there.
 If you're not able to be in town,
 we are streaming the conference,
 And if you go to that same URL, graceinner.us,
 you will be able to purchase tickets
 to be able to watch online as well.
 Jack is one of the finest teachers that I know.
  </li><li>Smart man.
  </li><li>His book would be very helpful
 for people who come from a background like Steve and I.
 Jeff Dollar just preached on the baptism
 of the Holy Spirit at Grace and Our Last Sunday.
 I'll put a link in the show notes for you
 to watch that, an excellent message.
 And this week taught on the speaking and tongue.
 So those two tend to go hand in hand.
 If you have questions or want more information,
 I really recommend you read that book,
 watch those messages,
 and of course you can reach out to us on Twitter as well.
 Steve's running now, so you wanna add?
  </li><li>Well, I'll tell you the best sermon I think I've ever heard
 in the Holy Spirit was by another Baptist
 by the name of Jack Taylor.
  </li><li>Oh, yes.
  </li><li>And Jack would be in his 80s?
  </li><li>Yes, probably.
  </li><li>And he just did a Bible study
 on being filled with the Holy Spirit,
 and it was phenomenal.
 So I would imagine that if people go on YouTube
 just look up Jack Taylor being filled with Holy Spirit or some sort of title like that.
 Maybe you can find it Ellen and Senate everybody, but it was a superb Bible teaching.
 And for people like myself who come from loving the Bible, those kind of sermons where it's
 clear this is what the Bible teaches are very helpful if you've got some friends who are
 not convinced that the Bible teaches this because it's in there.
 Was that at Toronto he was teaching?
 That's where I heard them say it.
 Yeah.
 One of our power, what was it called?
 The power in the word or something like that, Spirit and power, Spirit and something.
 I look up on YouTube and put a link to it in the show notes.
 Thanks for that.
 You're welcome.
 Well, thank you, Steve, for being on the podcast and just being part of our lives for
 gosh, over 20 years now.
 Twenty five years that I've known you.
 You were a young one, 17.
 Say it again.
 Say it again.
 You were young or do you want me to say you are young?
 I was probably 20, but yeah, let's go with 17.
 How old were you in 94?
 In 94 would have been 23.
 Oh, okay.
 So you never were young.
 You just jumped from.
 You appeared to be younger.
 Are you?
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Yes.
 And of course, Steve, you're teaching our school
 supernatural life this week.
 I am.
 Students are always blessed when you come in.
 You'll be teaching on healing this week.
 We always have not just great teaching on healing, but amazing show and
 tower as well. We consistently have amazing testimonies of miraculous healings and often
 deliverance as well. So it's going to be a fun week at the school.
 I think the second time that I came to the school, Alan and AJ took me aside and say,
 at some point, can you talk about deliverance because no one's going to do that or I can't
 remember what it was. And so the very first session where we're praying for people,
 the norm is that I ask people when we're practicing, and especially where there's
 pain levels, you got three options people are feeling less pain. They have more pain or no
 changes taking place. And I asked, was anybody having more pain than before? And one of your gals
 put her hand up. And when I explained that that often is a good thing, because it means that the
 Holy Spirit and the person like me praying for her has stirred up the demonic in that person,
 that's why they're having more pain is Satan's trying to intimidate them to stop receiving prayer,
 so that the pain can stay or the demons can stay.
 Well, when we said that, this girl began to manifest quite considerably.
 Yes, she did.
 And I just remember the rest of the students backed away.
 Yes, it was quite dramatic.
 And I think that it was a little shocking my behavior because I'm, I am used to that.
 And it's just a lot of puff and smoke and intimidation kind of things.
 And so I just started telling everyone what was happening and interviewing.
 And it, in hindsight, it probably was, um, what would be the right word?
 It was glorious.
 And it was a
 frequently talked about event.
 Still got free.
 That girl got remarkably free.
 It was terrible things that she'd gone through and been victimized and got free
 that day in public.
 Demons don't make good pets.
 No, they don't.
 They're better out than in.
 Yeah.
 Well, thank you for healing deliverance, teaching, and just general all good chat.
 We love when you come to town and thank you for taking time at your schedule.
 To be with us on keeping up with the Joneses, we're going to take you to your hotel so you can get some rest.
 Perfect.
 We're ready for two days of teaching.
 God bless you all.
 It's funny that we're talking about the Holy Spirit because we actually have a listener's question on the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
 Oh, cool.
 Yeah, an anonymous listener, actually not an anonymous person, somebody who gave me their name, but asked to remain anonymous.
 Ask this question, God has taken me into a season of learning more about the fruits of the Holy Spirit.
 Do you two have any tips or examples of how you're intentional with growing and cultivating the fruit of the Spirit in your lives?
 Well, I mean, I think the fruit of the Spirit is the result of housing the donor, if that makes sense.
 So, so the Holy Spirit is the very DNA of God.
 He dwelling within you produces the fruit of the Spirit.
 So love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
 gentleness and self-control.
 And so I think the way that you,
 my tip would be the Holy Spirit wants to grow
 those things within you anyway.
 And if we stop fighting him, they grow a lot faster.
 And so my biggest tip would be to follow the Holy Spirit even when he wants to bring up
 stuff that you're like, "Oh, that seems like it might be painfully difficult," because
 he is always trying to grow us into the person that we're called to be, and he's always
 trying to grow the spirit in us.
 I think it was Graham Cook that said that fruit goes best in really good soil and really
 good soil has lots of fertilizer in it.
 Don't be afraid if you're going through crappy seasons of life because it gives the greatest opportunity for fruit to grow
 That's great a really positive way
 Difficult seasons of life whether it's crappy seasons of life or whether it's because you know fertilizer often has dead things in it as well
 You know yeah, I didn't think about that. I think for me often when I'm hitting up against a wall
 This requiring say extra patience or extra love
 It's like okay, holy spirit can you show me what you're doing in the season?
 Can you show me what you're aiming to redeem about the season?
 Can you tell me what you're trying to be in this season?
 You couldn't be in any other season for me and how can I partner with you?
 But mostly that that's an afterthought mostly what happened is I just get ground down and realize
 What's required of this is not mine is not my typical go-to action and so holy spirit?
 Would you equip me please? I remember being a schoolteacher
 teacher, I remember having a student whose name I don't remember now, but she drove me
 nuts. And I remember, I forget what happened, she'd slide me that day and I remember thinking
 out tomorrow morning, I'm going to go find her in a class, I'm going to take her out
 and we're going to give her a good talking to. And I remember the Holy Spirit woke me
 up in the middle of the night with that verse that says, "Let your gentleness be evident
 to all." And the Holy Spirit was like, "How does your plan for this morning fit into your
 gentleness being evident to the student?" And I was like, "Lord, you can't possibly be
 And I realized, oh, this is the season where you're trying to teach me gentleness.
 Turns out he was serious.
 And anyway, that student got a shock of her life when I pulled her out of class just to
 say, I apologize, I'm sorry.
 I don't think that was the best example of me.
 And I didn't know what to do.
 And I was like, Lord, I hope this producing grapefruit in her as well as grapefruit in
 me.
 So I don't know.
 I think the life will present plenty of opportunities where the Holy Spirit gets to produce the
 fruit who he would love to do.
 In terms of intention, though, I think I'm always trying to work out what's going on.
 That's the only intention I have.
 Instead of going, "Okay, it's 2019. I'm going to practice joy," which I know some people do and
 have great success with that. But for me, it's rather... I'm trying to learn what the Holy Spirit
 is up to just by inquiring of the Lord.
 -Mm-hmm. I would say just keep giving God your yes, too, in all the little things,
 because it's the little things that grow you.
 Yeah, and also pay attention to your prophetic words.
 Now that I think about it, I've had seasons where at the start of the year,
 the Lord's like, "This is what I'm going to reveal to you about me."
 And so then I partner with that.
 So yeah, check what your words say and see where you can partner with the Lord
 with regard to your words and the fruit of the Holy Spirit.
 Yeah.
 All right. Well, thank you for that question.
 And thank you, Steve, for being with us this episode.
