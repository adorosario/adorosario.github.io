<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome back to Keeping Up With the Joneses,
 episode 243.
 And I have to say, AJ, the beard looks magnificent on you.
  </li><li>Yes, and the short here as well, right?
  </li><li>You can probably tell that we've got our dear friend,
 David Wagner, a special guest on our episode.
 David, welcome back to Keeping Up With the Joneses.
  </li><li>Thanks so much.
 You were here, and I did my research, you were here, episode 86,
 which has easily got to be one of the wildest stories.
 We get feedback from it all the time.
 You came on, you told your story about how God saved you,
 redeemed you, delivered you, sent you around the world.
 If I didn't know you, it's approaching the realms
 of not only implausibility, but impossibility.
 You're aware of that, right?
 Your story is exceptional.
 Yeah, it is a extreme story of God's love and pursuit of a man for sure.
 It's it's like I learned stuff on that.
 Like my eyes were like saucer.
 I don't think we videoed that one.
 I think we were just audio in those days.
 It was just audio.
 It was it was one of those moments for me.
 You asked a question at the end or somewhere in it.
 And you said, how do you know it's God's voice talking to you?
 And for the first time ever, I said it because it's the same voice that woke me up.
 And I tell that story in all the schools that I teach because I never quite said it like that before and
 That has become a hallmark
 Whenever that question is asked and it really just still speaks to me
 So I received a lot just from Sharon in episode 86. You're welcome. Yeah. Thank you
 I hope you're still getting the royalties. Yeah. Yeah, please hey if you haven't seriously in all seriousness
 If you don't know David it would be like this is gonna be a fun episode for sure
 But you would do yourself well to stop right now go and listen to episode 86 go to allenagie.com
 Slash 86 to listen to David's story. It's his heart. His story is radical
 And we're gonna have a lot more fun on this episode. I was thinking this morning David
 You will probably remember this because you have a remarkable memory like every time I tell a story about our history
 You always come in with the details that I've forgotten
 But this is especially precious to me to have you on that episode today
 One, because AJ sick and you so very kindly said, yeah, I'd love to come over.
 But two, you are sitting in the studio that you once prophesied.
 Awesome.
 I dug out the prophetic word.
 I dug out.
 It was a Saturday night.
 It was in 2005.
 I was journaling with the Lord and the Lord told me, he said, Hey, Alan, I actually want
 to begin to use you and AJ in media.
 And my first response was Lord, you know, I'm going to do that.
 We were in school.
 We have here's all the reasons why I can't.
 And the Lord's like, yeah, I don't need reasons why you can't.
 I just need a simple yes.
 And I was like, Lord, I don't know anything about video.
 I don't know how we're going to do this.
 And so the Lord began speaking to me.
 And I just remember going, oh, yeah.
 And it was one of those things that was so close to my heart.
 You know, when you get those words that are so close to the direction
 you wish the Lord would tell you to go in?
 You then become suspicious it was you.
 The way I like to remember it is shortly after that you were speaking
 of grace or emanate.
 I tried to actually go back and search the archives to find the date.
 And I was MCing and I introduced you and you grabbed my hand
 and you began to prophesy about a prophetic TV show.
 The Lord's gonna use you in media,
 the Lord's gonna use you in video
 and began to talk about age and anger.
 And it was such a confirmation,
 it was so close to the word,
 do you remember any of that?
  </li><li>I think it was more 2013.
  </li><li>It was 2013.
  </li><li>I think so.
  </li><li>I started coming to the church in 2011.
 So it'd be somewhere between 2011, 2000.
 and 13, but I think it might have been more to than 13.
  </li><li>Well, so that I just was delayed
 in obeying the Lord then.
  </li><li>In May, I think.
  </li><li>See, this is what I mean, detail, boy,
 but look around, this is some of the fruit
 of your prophetic ministry.
 We have a little boy upstairs,
 which I like to tell that story.
 That A.J. and I were trying to conceive,
 obviously we had two girls at that point,
 we'd miscarried, we really wanted a boy,
 your dad of like a hundred boys,
 or your quiver is full.
 And it was probably the very first time we met you, wasn't it?
 Yes, 2011.
 Yeah, very first time you came in and did prophetic ministry for our staff.
 Yeah.
 And you were on your best behavior.
 And I don't know.
 I don't think we ever talk about this.
 You were, you were the reason I say you were on your best behavior.
 I felt like you were prophesying in prayer.
 Like you were praying some really sensitive stuff.
 And so us being us, we just stopped and we're like, hey, we know that you're
 we're a dad of boys and we'd be left with boy.
 And I read into your right grin,
 and then you gave us that word that Elijah gave that,
 like about this time next year, you'll be holding a boy.
 And then about this time next year, MJ was born.
 So we've got a long history.
 You are known around the world as a prophet,
 and of course we love you as a prophet,
 but I actually love having you as my friend
 more than I love having you as a prophet.
 And I love prophets a lot.
 And so welcome, welcome back.
  </li><li>Thanks, thanks for letting me step into fulfillment.
 It's always good to see what prophecy looks like
 on the other side of it.
 And I think it's a beautiful thing, right?
 I think in covenant relationship,
 we purpose that we would be friends first
 and minister second.
 And there's always ministry,
 but friends are sometimes few and far between.
 So that to me is the highlight of ministry.
 And again, just knowing the two of you
 and your family and now living in close proximity.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Is great.
  </li><li>Yeah, especially 'cause I can just call you
 and you can drive over and sit in our studio.
 So here's what I did.
 I sneak, I don't even ask you this.
 I just banked on our friendship being sufficient
 that you would let me do this.
 I put out on social media,
 what's the question you've always wanted to ask a prophet
 but being too afraid to ask?
 And I'd like to think that I've been on my best behavior
 in my relationship with you again.
 I've always prioritized friendship over a ministry,
 but as a prophetic nerd,
 somebody who loves prophetic culture,
 I'm a student of contemporary prophetic ministry.
 Some of these questions are questions
 I've always wanted to ask.
 They're nerdy, they are wide ranging,
 and so I'm just gonna fire them at you
 and you can answer them for yourself
 or you can answer them for prophetic culture at large.
  </li><li>Yeah, now if I was really prophetic
 I would tell you what those questions are.
  </li><li>Well, I was gonna joke, I was gonna say,
 "Hey David, you're fine, how am I?"
 Yeah, that's a...
 All right, here we go.
 I've largely grouped them by themes
 'cause a lot of them were overlapping.
 And this first theme is kind of about church,
 kind of about community.
 This is a great question.
 My experience of profits are like traveling profits
 who come into town, give prophetic words
 in a corporate setting and then leave.
 Is this what a profit does or is there more to it?
  </li><li>I think there's more to it.
 I serve, I minister a lot as an itinerant.
 So I travel around the world.
 I'm in different churches a lot,
 but I also view myself as a local church prophet.
 Like if you were to kept me open,
 I would bleed local church.
 So I function really well with apostolic people,
 other prophetic people, pastors, evangelists and teachers,
 'cause there's no competition among those gifts.
 And I find great safety in being a part of local church
 because there's covering there, there's protection there,
 there's accountability there.
 And so I think a lot of prophets we do travel.
 I think you can look at prophets scripturally,
 there's the priestly prophets.
 And then I think there's prophets to the nations.
 I think that I have kind of a mixture of both.
 But I think you'll find most prophets probably traveling
 or that's almost the, I don't wanna say the box,
 but it seems to be the vehicle that God uses
 that we go from place to place during up things
 and speaking into foundations and churches and things.
  </li><li>So part of the model of what they've seen
 is a part and parcel of it,
 but there's a whole other side to it, which is building.
 You two ones talked about those places you go to bless
 and those places you state to build.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Unpack that for me.
 I think in the beginning part of my ministry, it was a lot of blessing prophecy.
 And I do believe that that all building prophecy will bless you, but not all blessing prophecy
 will build you. And so I think in my, in growing in my infancy or in my maturing,
 I was a lot of just blessing people with my with my gift. And then I remember in 2000,
 November 2007, I was in Kensington, Connecticut. And the pastor, Rick
 McKinnis, took out a tuning fork, hit it so it began to vibrate and
 said, this is who you are. And the Lord's taking you from blessing to
 building. And I can't tell you how or but as a 35 year old guy at that
 point or 3536, it stirred something in me. I didn't feel like I was
 quite there yet, but I knew it was where the Lord was taking me.
 It was one of those hallmarks.
 And I would get to just declare that prophecy over me in places and four or
 five years later when I hit, I don't know how to explain it, but when I hit 40,
 things shifted and I began to see myself more as a builder than just a
 blesser.
 And because I believe that, you know, uh, according to 1 Corinthians 14,
 that prophecy brings edification.
 It's the first thing it does.
 It literally means to build, uh, to build up.
 And so I want to, I feel like every prophecy I give becomes a brick, a block,
 something that you can build with for the rest of your life or your ministry or
 your family upon.
 Yeah.
 I got a question that's not on my list, but it just made me think,
 I remember speaking to Gary Morgan, a dear friend of both of ours.
 And he said that depending on where he goes is often what people draw out of him.
 Right.
 So, you know, part of that is how you're received.
 You know, so someplace like I'm receiving as a teacher and I'll, I'll teach
 revelatory stuff. Someplace I go and receive as a prophet and I get different types of
 revelation. Do you find that? Like where you go, people draw different things out of you?
 Yeah, I think the Lord meets people in their place of expectation, people in kind of old
 Pentecostal terms, it's pulling on the anointing. It's, and I, you know, I've, I've cut my teeth
 in a variety of places. So most people wouldn't know this about me, but I spend still about
 a third of my time, a third quarter of my time in non-spirit-filled environments.
 So I might be in a Presbyterian church, a Baptist church.
 And so I meet people where they are.
 It's often their first introduction to prophecy.
 So they don't know quite what to expect.
 But by the end, I believe they actually receive the heart of God more than they understand
 the prophetic word of the Lord that's coming.
 But if they get the heart, they'll understand the word.
 So I've walked with people now for, that's the way it started 20 years,
 it's my 20th year in ministry.
 And so there's things right now that I'm hearing like, we didn't know what
 you're talking about them, but we're living in it now.
 And, and so I think those things are really important.
 How do you, how do you do that?
 It's, I think God goes, uh, I think he is drawn to where hunger is,
 where desire is curiosity.
 And I don't think he minds proving himself either.
 Like I don't ever feel like people are testing me.
 you're trying to prove if I'm real or not, right?
 13.
 And that, you know, it's one of those things.
 I think part of my job, not part of your question,
 but I think part of what the Lord's call me to do
 is kind of de-spookify the supernatural, right?
 We make everything so spooky and realizing that
 this is just normal life for the believer.
  </li><li>Well, the prophetic spooky enough.
 Like it's, you know, it is weird enough
 that you know the secrets of people's hearts.
 no matter how normally you make it, but I think one of the things I love about you,
 I'd put Gary in this category too, that you guys are not really interested in your gift being known.
 You're really interested in you being known, and like normalizing or making it every day as best as you can.
 Yeah, I think some of that comes in hiddenness, right? I know how to be hidden, I know how to be seen.
 And the older I get, the much more I prefer to be hidden, because it's in those hidden places in
 God that deeper revelation comes.
 Um, and, and I will tell you this, that often going into a meeting, the Lord meets
 me, yes, on what people are believing for, or their expectation, but he also meets
 me in mind, you know, so Lord, I'm believing to see what I've never seen before here,
 what I've, uh, and I think that is this beautiful thing of, of knowing the father
 like that going, Lord, I want to, you know, I don't just want to be confined to my own
 limited language, like I want to actually see no, and if I
 necessary create words, which I've been known to do, right,
 like next expectation.
 Yeah.
 Because there's no other word for it.
 So the word just allows you to create it.
 And expectation, I love that.
 All right.
 Well, there's question one, this should be great.
 We'll get to this in about two weeks.
 Um, why are many prophets not connected to a local church?
 Like you talked about your love for the local church.
 But why are so many prophets not connected to a local church?
 I believe there's a lot of wounded prophetic people out there
 who felt like they were misunderstood. Nobody knew what to do with them. And they feel or there's
 the stigma or paradigm paradox of prophets have to live alone in caves. And nobody understands us
 and were peculiar people and all of those things. And I know what it's like to be
 misunderstood was misunderstood for a good portion of my life. But when I met my pastor in Pensacola,
 he got this word of that makes and David's not a pastor, he's a prophet and he knew what to do
 with me. And because he knew what to do with me, he knew that this prophet specifically needed a
 pastor needed somebody to just speak into his life because of the,
 I believe cause the mercy gift that I carry,
 which is an unusual thing that maybe we'll talk about at some point, um,
 is, is, is so important to me.
 So I believe sometimes they feel misunderstood. There's a lot of wounding.
 There's, there's that, that stigma.
 And sometimes, uh, to be honest, prophetic people don't always play nice with
 with other, with other people, you know, who are, um, and I think it's,
 It's because of the weight of what they're carrying.
 And again, I think comes back to that,
 that fear of, probably a fear of rejection
 and insecurity in it.
 But also I would go back to almost every time
 it's a wounding that took place.
  </li><li>All right, dove tailing from that question.
 How do you stay accountable in community
 to what you say, especially if you're not part
 of the community you're administering to,
 which is going through,
 so you're talking about the duality of your ministry.
 Like it's easy for you to be accountable
 grace when you're in a time when you're in a time almost every week.
 But what about when you're in other countries and you're prophesied?
 How do you stay accountable to the community that you're administering?
 I don't do anything outside of relationship and assignment.
 So unless the Lord really sends me somewhere, I feel like he's sending me somewhere on an
 assignment.
 I won't go.
 But most of my connections are relational.
 So there's a lot of interconnection.
 If I go to a place, I offer accountability.
 I let people know who my pastors are.
 If they have an issue with anything I say, I say call my pastors.
 And so in the past, there's been times where people have.
 And basically, it was all resolved with some clarity.
 But I'm just not a one-off guy.
 So if I can't go to build and do life with you,
 I may come in one time, I'll still be accountable for it.
 And I think that's really important.
 You know, that word accountability is really interesting
 to me because we almost create a negative connotation
 with it and I'm being held accountable
 for what I might do wrong.
 But I also think there's a part of it
 that actually means an account for my ability.
 So how am I carrying my gift well?
 Am I lazy with it?
 Am I overzealous with it?
 You know, all of those things.
 And so I think accountability is a much bigger picture.
 Probably do a whole episode on that at some point.
 But I think it's really, really important.
 Listen, when I say the Lord is saying something,
 I'm not just putting my own credibility on the line.
 I'm putting the credibility of the Lord on the line.
 And so I think there's what people see
 in my local church accountability
 in my apostolic covering accountability,
 but also in just being accountable to friends, you know?
 I remember a few times as a younger guy,
 I'd go out there a little bit, you know?
 And I was probably prophesying outside of my authority
 or those things in my past year ago.
 All that was good, but you made me really nervous
 when you did this.
  </li><li>Easy tiger.
  </li><li>And he was saying, I'm not saying it's wrong.
 I'm saying that I don't know if you're ready
 for those kind of things.
 And that really helped me.
 And so I love accountability.
 I'm not afraid of it at all.
 We won't go into detail,
 but early on in my relationship with you guys,
 there was a circumstances situation.
 And you said, "Hey, this couple would really need
 "some clarity and will you have lunch with them?"
 And I was just thinking about it.
  </li><li>And I did that.
 And those folks are, they were less known to me then,
 but very well known to me now.
 and connected and we walk those things out together
 and things that maybe weren't seen then
 are now being lived out in multiple ways now.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Again, it's not really our story to tell.
  </li><li>I remember, it isn't our story to tell,
 but I do remember that.
 And I remember your graciousness and your lack of fear
 when I was just like, "Hey, you know,
 we'll probably need your help cleaning up a situation."
 You know, and you're like, "Yeah, be happy to."
 Like, you know, "I'm happy to explain what I saw
 and if I missed it, I'm happy to, I missed it."
 And, you know, I think humility and honor is key, right?
 And so I'm humble enough to say, you know,
 I believe the word of God is infallible.
 The scriptures are infallible, but this human being
 at times might misinterpret something.
 I will promise you this,
 that I would never do it with the wrong heart,
 but it would be at times maybe I misinterpret things.
 Maybe I'm ahead of the game.
 Maybe I'm trying to read something into it.
 And so you humble yourself in the side of the Lord
 and he's able to bring healing and clarity through that.
  </li><li>And your own gifting, are you aware of,
 like I'm just, 'cause you know you
 better than other people know you, possibly.
 Are you aware of weaknesses and strengths
 in your own gifting?
 For example, you know, you might be,
 I'm making this up, you might be really, really good
 at word of knowledge, you might be growing in timing,
 you might be rock solid in future stuff,
 you know, those variations, do you have like
 comfort levels in the stream of your gift?
  </li><li>Yeah, I think that my gift being mercy motivated
 is both a strength, but it could be a weakness.
 I'll never forget a couple of years ago,
 they were really dealt with me about walking in unsanctified
 or showing people unsanctified mercy,
 showing mercy to things that God wouldn't show mercy to.
 Because of the way that I'm wired,
 the way that He created me,
 the beautiful part of being merciful and optimistic.
 and I always wanna believe for the best.
 And sometimes it could keep me from actually speaking
 to a situation in somebody's life that could bring change.
 So that would be one of those circumstance or situations.
 I'm also really aware of this,
 that my job is not to try to out-professize other people.
 But when I connect, when I'm around Gary Morgan,
 my word of knowledge goes way up, right?
  </li><li>Not funny that way that works.
 'cause if I'm around my friend Will Hart,
 my healing, kind of evangelist thing will go up
 because we're connected and I'll watch that walk out.
 And so to me, those are our strengths,
 but I also know when that lifts.
 And so I really try to stay true to me.
 And a lot of things are, sometimes I try to dissect it
 'cause it's fun, like, oh, that was a word of knowledge,
 that was a word of wisdom, that was,
 but it all kind of flows together for me.
 And so I feel like I'm most of the time just,
 I guess unless you're in me,
 you might not understand how it goes,
 but I often just feel like I'm sitting in the heart of God.
 I'm just speaking from the place of his heart.
 Or sometimes when I move more into the office of the prophet,
 I'll feel like I'm actually a spectator to what's happening.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So over these last few weeks, God's been moving
 aware that I'm there, but at the same time,
 almost feeling--
  </li><li>Watching what's happening.
 watching what's happening.
  </li><li>Love it.
  </li><li>How did you fight the temptation to isolate yourself?
 Like especially with your story of rejection, abandonment.
 You know, now you're thrust into this gift.
 Like, what did you do to resist that temptation?
  </li><li>For me, I realized community was life
 and knowing that isolation led to darkness for me.
 So I just chose light and chose community.
 It took a while to build trust around people.
 And I think that we have to clarify,
 there's a difference between isolation and solitude.
 And I've just learned in the last five, six, seven years
 solitude, I didn't like being by myself after I got
 and set free, like I had a FOMO, fear of missing out
 all the time, wanted to be at everything.
 And I was in Australia, I'll be enough
 and January of 2014, the Lord said,
 you can't keep going at this pace.
 I think I'd done 10 days of meetings and then I was moving into youth camps and a
 don't young adult camp.
 And so I want you to come and spend time with me.
 And so I, you know, turn worship on.
 He said, shut that off.
 Oh, my Bible said, and he just had me sit for an hour by myself.
 It was the most difficult hour of my life in that moment.
 But now I practice it just about every day.
 And if I don't, then I really know that I've missed it.
 So I do want to clarify that.
 Isolation is a big trick of the enemy.
 And I tell this story often of my first,
 one of my first times in South Africa,
 watching this Zebra walk down the road.
 It was cut from the kind of its neck down to its throat,
 head down into feet, just walking by itself.
 And the guy leading us said, oh, it's so sad.
 This is the Zebra's last day on the earth.
 He got wounded and got isolated from his family.
 and something bigger than him is going to take him down.
 And he starts weeping and he goes,
 oh my goodness, it's a picture of the church.
 We get wounded and we get isolated because of our wounded,
 woundedness.
 And the enemy goes to and for like a roaring lion.
 And a little while later,
 we saw these vultures circling
 and something had taken it down.
 Not because it was wounded,
 but because it was isolated.
 At the end of the day,
 God gave us another gift.
 We heard the sound of elephants splashing and playing
 and we looked and watched them for about 45 minutes.
 We were walking back to the van to leave
 and we heard this different sound.
 My friends said, there's danger, let's go back.
 And we looked, and there was two lions on the hunt
 and all of the elephants that were once playing
 began to form this perimeter.
 So the bulls were on the outside,
 the females were right behind them,
 the mamas were right behind them,
 teenagers right behind them,
 and the kids just stayed playing
 'cause they were fully protected.
 And it was two in one day, two different pictures, just out of what the Lord was just showing us.
 One was isolation that led to death, and one was what was happened when you're connected to community
 and everybody's in the right place.
 Gosh, I love that.
 All right.
 I don't know if this is the season the prophetic has just gone through,
 but so many people want to know about what happens when you get it wrong.
 Like it was probably the most common question.
 So one of these questions that was sent multiple times is,
 what do you do when you get it wrong?
 And they put in brackets assuming that you do
 and you're made aware of it.
 So you give a word and it turns out it's wrong.
 Well, like what do you do?
  </li><li>Me?
 I would number one, humble myself.
 'Cause I'm not above missing it.
 I would repent.
 And I think those things are important.
 We've made those almost negative,
 but they're actually very positive.
 And then I would go through a process of saying how do I restore?
 Faith trust and integrity in that gift. I don't think you can really restore faith trust and in that gift without going through those first few things
 of humbling yourself and and repenting
 Anytime a prophetic person says don't question the prophet. I'm gonna question you
 Right because we're not above missing it. We're not God. He's in us, right?
 And human nature is prone to, you know, you ate bad pizza, you're tired, you're just trying to get through.
 Something is soullish, whatever.
 If you just own it, why? Because it's not just, again, not just my reputation, not even just the Lord's reputation,
 but it's the reputation of the prophetic movement.
 And we've watched, you know, all kinds of things happen.
 happens. If you were to ask me what's happening, I would tell you that the prophetic movement
 is probably going through this same kind of season. The Lord took the evangelist or healing
 evangelist movement of the 80s and 90s where there's this breaking down to build back up.
 There's a humbling, there's, you know, and there's a healing coming to it. And I think
 when when have on the flip side of that, if I go to a doctor and he misses it and gives
 me a medication that doesn't cure my infection, I don't go on social media and go false doctor,
 false doctor, false doctor, I go, Hey doc, that one didn't work. Can we fix it? Can we
 find something else that will? So I think it's really important to be able to say, Hey, that
 that missed it. And I think you have a conversation, a dialogue like we're having today is really
 important. I get emails. I try to answer as many as I can by myself. People asking
 just questions like you're being asked. There's been times that I think that I missed it in timing.
 Like, so there are things that I thought were going to happen at a time and in my younger days,
 I probably would step out more in time. Maybe not a specific date, but go 30 days or 60 days and
 things didn't happen and people would get crushed by it. And so I started learning like, I don't
 I don't want to, so I'll say this.
 I don't want to put God on a box,
 and I know that the way he sees it on a day
 is like a thousand years, thousand years, like a day.
 But this is what I'm kind of sensing and feeling.
 Again, I don't want to tie it in, but I believe it's a season
 that you're entering in.
 I've learned that with maturity.
 There's been other cases that, where people question it,
 I remember praying for a little girl that had an incurable disease
 and prayed that the prophesied that the Lord would extend her life.
 And she lived to into her teens, but how her family interpreted or received it,
 they thought she was going to live to be in her 80s and 90s.
 And so medically, I mean, I'm not trying to justify it.
 You know, the doctors had given her two years.
 She got eight years.
 Did I miss it? Was I wrong with wrong interpretation? You know my my biggest
 My biggest fear and I use that word
 I want to be careful how I use that word but is I never want to create false hope, right?
 And so I really want to wait on the Lord and then I want to weigh the word that I have
 Right, it's easier to prevent a mistake than to go back to aisle 7 and clean up the prophecy, you know
 and so I think those things are are really important and
 And I think we should honor people, right?
 To me, one of the greatest honors of my life
 is that God trusts me with the secrets of people's hearts.
 And the moment I take that lightly,
 I'm in dangerous territory.
 Like if I just wanna put on a show,
 you're gonna get yourself in trouble.
 If you wanna be the top notch prophet,
 you're gonna be in trouble.
 Why Jesus said, you know, that we should be servants,
 we should be the least of these,
 not the, you know, not trying to, and I think that's a part of where people are missing it.
 We're trying to compete almost like being first to print, first to the news, right?
 So I've got to get it out on social media first.
 I've got to, you know, and, and for me, I mean, if you look at my social media at the moment,
 I've not posted a whole lot in the last year, not because I don't have revelation.
 I think, I think the question, Alan, is, is the Lord speaking something to me?
 So I shout it from the rooftops or in a microphone,
 on a podcast or on Facebook.
 Or is he speaking to me because he wants a friend
 to talk to and share some secrets with?
 And I'd rather be the latter than to be
 the most famous prophet.
 I think that to me is the most special thing.
 So I don't wanna make,
 I don't wanna take the holy and make it common
 or so familiar that it's just like
 we get flippant with prophecy.
 And I think if you take a step back and go,
 how would I want this word spoken to my own life
 or to my son or my daughter?
 I think that prevents a whole lot.
 And this, you know, when has humility and accountability
 and responsibility and repentance become a bad word?
 like I don't get it. My mind's not wired there. My heart's not wired there. And at the same
 time, I see things out there and I go, that hurts my heart. But where's my influence in
 that? How do I? So I've not come against anybody because that's not my place. But I do have
 conversations behind the scenes and in the training that I do. People are like, they
 think they're going to come to maybe a school that I do and they're going to become this
 world-class prophet and they get there and they realize it's more about the heart and
 the father's heart and character than it is about the gift.
 I think gifts can impress us for a while, right?
 But fruit doesn't lie.
 So I would say, what do I do if I've received a bad prophecy?
 I wouldn't start labeling people false prophets or going after them.
 I would go, what's the fruit of their life?
 the fruit of my 20 years in ministry. I'm talking about percentages of getting things
 right or missing it. I think some of that's what's the fruit of my ministry? What is it
 produced? I would apply that to everybody else. We're all prone to have a bad day, but
 when you start turning your bad day into a bad week into a bad year into a bad ministry,
 then we have issues. I think it's time for profits, really. Everybody in the body of
 Christ, but specifically prophets, to learn how to stand in the
 council of the Lord again.
 What is it?
 What is it like to be face to face with Jesus?
 What's it like to spend time in his presence to stand time in his
 council and not just receive the word to give but say, Lord, how
 would you even want me to deliver this word you're giving me?
 I think your glassy eyes have already answered this question, but
 I know the person that sent this question and they're very dear to me.
 And I kind of love this question.
 But they asked the question and then they gave two hashtags and they said,
 do you care if you're wrong hashtag jaded hashtag sat?
 So this is somebody I know they're asking it anonymously,
 but they're very well versed in prophetic culture surrounded by prophets.
 So I'm hearing the cry of their heart.
 I mean, I'm looking at your face, but hey, David, do you care if you're wrong or
 if prophets get wrong?
 Yeah.
 I care deeply. I care deeply because prophecy speaks to me of eternal things, not temporary
 things. It speaks to me of holy things and heart things and destinies. And if I realized
 that I could give a word that could send people on a detour of destiny, that's a pretty heavy
 weight to carry. Looking at my own five kids at times trying to figure things out, right?
 I need to hear clearly for them. They need to hear clearly for themselves, but if people
 are speaking in their lives, they need to hear clearly as well. And so, and I think we need to know
 how to to receive prophecy, to know what to, you know, take to heart what to put up on the shelf.
 I think we'd be better at probably teaching on that. But I care deeply for people who are
 maybe blatantly getting things wrong. I feel very concerned and care a lot for people who
 maybe they're not as anointed as they think they are. What I care about more than anything else is
 the condition of their soul and the condition of the souls of the people that they're quote
 unquote ministering to. And so as a dad, as I believe a spiritual father to many people,
 that's my soapbox. If you stop caring for people or stop caring about if you got it wrong,
 alright, I wish there was a part of me that goes, you know, I don't care what people say,
 But that wouldn't be who I am, right?
 Because I really do care.
 And I should care because that's my reputation that will far outlive me.
 And so I think we should take even greater care of it.
 Like if I looked at prophecy like a baby, I wouldn't just say, "Here you go, Alan."
 Like, "I would hand you a baby with great care."
 And I think that's how the Lord gives us prophecy and care.
 And we should be giving prophecy and care.
 You know, you'll watch me from knowing me for years. There's times where I'll just go like a machine gun and then I hit these pauses
 because some stuff is just
 revelatory information and God's gonna do it whether I speak it or not and I'm confident but then when you start hitting heart issues
 We're ministering to areas of the heart
 You'll often notice me pause or get choked up sometimes because the Lord's doing something in me at the same time
 Sometimes I just feel the weight of the moment
 That I can't just be flippant in yeah, you know if I look even at towards the end of last Sunday at grace center
 But those moments to me are holy if people are responding to what I'm saying
 It's not hype and we can't we can't exchange or we can't mistake
 hype for holy or holy for hype
 so
 Beautiful
 all right, let's jump off of that and
 And let's talk about this last season, because we're kind of flirted around that topic, but
 this is a great question. How do you respond to haters who treat you like you should see everything
 coming? Like, I don't even know if that's applicable to you, but I've seen it thrown at
 profits like, oh, you should've seen this, that next thing. Like, you know, like you decide what
 revelation you get. Yeah. I just take people back to the scripture that the secret things
 belong to the Lord, but that what he reveals to us is for our children, our children's children.
 And so I'm responsible for revelation I get.
 I'm not responsible for revelation.
 He didn't give me.
 Right.
 So they're their issue is not with me.
 It's some disappointment in the Lord.
 It's some cynicism, sarcasm.
 And that becomes a default thing.
 Right.
 I look at everything as a sign.
 So haters to me.
 They used to bother me a lot, but now I just pray for them a whole lot more.
 And I take his sign really what they're speaking to me is out of their pain, not
 it's manifesting as anger or hate, but there's some area of pain.
 So my prayers and Lord vindicate me and it's Lord heal them, open their eyes.
 And so I just view them as, you know, as, as, you know, you get trolls, you get
 all kinds of things if you're gonna be in this today.
 But if it's good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for me,
 right?
 I think the disciples were in the boat with Jesus,
 the storm comes, the wind comes, the waves crashing
 in the boat.
 Jesus, don't you care about us?
 Like, why didn't you tell us when we were going
 across the land, there's gonna be a storm,
 you're gonna take a nap, and then we would know what to do,
 but you didn't tell us 'cause you didn't, and so, right?
 And so it's just a part of ministry,
 and it's why it's a walk of faith, right?
 I think I'm not gonna make something up, right?
 So, oh, there's great peril coming.
 Well, how about just go to the Bible, right?
 In the last days, these things, like second to me, three.
 In the last days, perilous or dangerous times would come.
 Just read that and everything you need to know about
 plagues and wars and rumors of wars
 and how people are acting politically and all that stuff.
 It's all in there.
 So it's already been spoken.
 I don't need to say it.
 No, I'm just kidding.
 But I'm just saying I'm responsible for what the Lord gives me, but I'm not responsible for what he had.
 Well, I think it's unreasonable that they're like, hey, how come you're not on mission?
 You're like, seriously, that's where we're at right now?
 That I didn't prophesy the thing that you're passionate about.
 It's just alien to me.
 Yeah.
 What do you think about the Trump 2020 profits?
 If you're close to them, how have you approached them?
 Broadly speaking, personal details.
 Yeah.
 So here's what I throw this disclaimer.
 I don't know if it's really a disclaimer,
 but I prefaced my answer with this.
 The Lord didn't speak that to me.
 So I don't know how it felt, what they heard,
 what they saw, how they interpreted, what they received.
 And so I can't, you know,
 I'll give them the benefit of the doubt in their heart.
 Could it be a couple of things?
 Let me throw this out.
 I think that the Lord doesn't like pride very much.
 So could it have been that there was a prophetic word,
 but pride prevented that word from coming to pass
 or coming to pass right now in this moment.
 I'm just throwing that out there.
 And so I also think that many people in the church
 have made certain political people almost an idol.
 And God doesn't like idols much.
 So maybe those idols and alters needed to come down.
 I think, again, I think there were some that apologized that humbled themselves and then
 they got lambblasted.
 Right?
 There are others that are still sticking to their guns.
 So people send me stuff almost on a daily basis.
 I kind of imagine you're in box.
 So I, you know, from YouTube, you know, clips and links and all of those things.
 And I'm not, I'm not the prophecy police, but I will bring everything back to heart.
 Right?
 So let me say this.
 So the Lord wanted to be the king of Israel.
 Israel wanted a man.
 They got a Saul.
 Finally, they got a David.
 So things play out like that.
 I think there's a few reasons why people missed it
 or may have missed it in this season,
 especially according to the election prophecies.
 I think sometimes people prophesy preference.
 So they let their preference get in the way
 or they present it in a prophetic way
 and some of that 'cause their passion got
 in the way of that.
 Sometimes people do it for personal ambition.
 So if I'm again, first to print and get this out there,
 then I'm gonna be the guy who prophesied the next president.
 I think sometimes people prophesy things out of hurt
 that are so wound.
 And so maybe that jades them one side or the other prophetically.
 Nonetheless, there's certain things that didn't happen.
 They didn't happen in a time frame.
 So what, you know, I think it's important to have conversations,
 but those conversations have to begin in humility,
 but also the same, I think I need to,
 if I miss it, I need to walk in humility,
 but I also think if we're really believers, right,
 really wanting to get to truth and have a dialogue,
 then we have to humble ourself on the other side.
 'Cause throwing arrows and accusations,
 it's, you know, we're doing the enemy's work.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Right?
 And so I think those things are really important.
 I've had hard conversations with people privately, behind the scenes, not in a text message or
 in an email, but saying, "Hey, I think my authority is connected to my
 authority and influence is connected to my relationship. Some people I have no relationship to,
 so I don't have any authority or say so in their life." But others, I said, "Hey,
 I think you need to repent of that. I think you need to humble yourself in that area."
 I've written quite a bit on it.
 I think in some of my earlier, I haven't blogged in a while, but on my website, I did post quite
 a bit about that in January and February.
 So, people can check that out at fathersheartministries.org.
 Not a plug for my writing.
 It was just I was sharing my heart.
 I'll put links in the show notes.
 I'll go find them and link it for you.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Did it answer the question or do I need to go deeper?
 No.
 All right, let's switch gears to some fun stuff.
 Okay, I'm not asking this question.
 I'm asking somebody, but this is a serious question
 and fun.
 Do you know stuff about my future that you haven't told me?
 Again, I'm not asking for Alan, but generally,
 when you meet people, do you know stuff about their future
 that you haven't told them?
  </li><li>I know, well, I only know what the Lord reveals to me.
 Sometimes it's futuristic, sometimes about the heart,
 sometimes it's certain information.
 Some things I withhold it
 because I don't feel like the timing is right.
 And so to prophesy a certain ministry
 or a certain life event into people's lives,
 it could actually delay them, frustrate them,
 or if they're not ready for it,
 either they can sabotage it or not carry it well.
 And they'll eventually get there,
 but there's hardships.
 And so again, I weigh the words,
 say, "Lord, is this a word for now?"
 Or, "For a way for later?"
 And it's not that I go,
 I know something you don't know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's, I want to make sure that this is,
 yes, it's a word from the Lord,
 but is it a now word from the Lord?
  </li><li>How much of your stuff is, like for me and my gift
 in the prophetic, I have to look to see.
 So like, it's been to Gary, Gary's like,
 "I'm on all the time."
 Like when I say, "On," he says,
 "I'm constantly receiving revelation,
 and then I'm asking the Lord what to share,
 whereas for me, I'm off all the time until I look to see.
 and then when I look, I see things.
 What's it like for you?
  </li><li>I'm on all the time, so the hardest places for me
 are shopping malls, restaurants, airports.
  </li><li>You're constantly aware of revelation.
  </li><li>So you're constantly getting revelation.
 There's no physical way to process that
 and to release all of it.
 So Lord, what's for now?
 Who are you in the minute hood?
 And so sometimes I'm on an airplane,
 people are getting on, I'll see something,
 and I'll just ride it on the napkin,
 and I'll wait for them to get off the plane
 say this may make or may not make sense to you.
 And they go, Oh my goodness, what I'm going through.
 You don't need to look for revelation.
 You always have revelation.
 You need to look for application.
 Am I sharing this Lord?
 Or am I turning this into intercession?
 Do I just keep it to myself?
 Yeah, I think I think the gift of prophecy is given as the Lord wills, right?
 So all of a sudden, Alan, I will.
 I need somebody to speak to this person.
 You're looking.
 You're available.
 God, God activates the gift.
 Do you speak into it as a prophet like me, Gary, other people?
 It's always, we can turn it on, turn it off.
 I've just chosen never to turn it off.
 So I tell people I've been in a 24 and a half year conversation with the Lord.
 So it's, I'm always seeing something, hearing something, feeling something,
 knowing something.
 There's signs where it's more intense.
 Sometimes it seems like it's there, but it's more, more mumbled.
 A lot of that has to do with what's going on in my own life or how busy I am
 and those things, but yeah.
  </li><li>I remember Mike Bickle saying
 that a common mistake people make about prophets
 is that prophets are all the same.
 And he said, that's just not true.
 And the same way that musicians are not the same,
 people are not the same.
 And he said, for example, Bob Jones,
 if Bob has a word for you,
 he will track you down and give it.
 And Paul Kane has a word,
 he's probably not gonna share it.
 And I remember John Paul Jackson,
 another prophet saying that Paul Kane gave him a word
 that I think he'd been waiting 18 years to give him.
 So like Paul Kane,
 be carrying around this word for John Paul,
 And he'd been in relationship with John Paul for,
 I don't know how many years.
 And after a certain amount of time he gave him this word
 and John Paul said, "Blue me away."
 And we went back to Paul Paul,
 there's a life-jazzy word.
 And Paul's like, "Yeah, I've been holding onto it."
 Like what you said for years
 until the time was right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Blue me away.
 All right, next fun one.
 Sometimes I'm afraid a prophet is literally reading my mind
 in an ordinary interaction.
 True?
  </li><li>Not true.
 Again, true prophecy, we only know what the Lord gives to us.
 It's not about psychopathic or ESP, it's not mind reading.
 It's actually hearing what the Lord is saying for your heart.
 And he knows your thoughts.
 I don't know your thoughts.
 And so I think those things are really important to understand.
 Another big fear, right, is he's going to err all my dirty laundry.
 To me, the safest place to be in a prophetic meeting is under the blood, right?
 Because if it's separated as far as these is from the West, if you separated my transgression,
 if he doesn't remember it anymore, how can he tell me of it?
 So if people are speaking more of your past than your present and your future, I question
 the source.
 Wow.
 Right.
 One of my favorite lines, a gal out in a, she mentioned how to Bethel Lindy Cohen said
 that prophecy isn't designed to wow us with accuracy,
 it's to woo us into intimacy.
 So I'd rather have an intimate prophet,
 even more than an accurate prophet,
 'cause if his intimate is gonna be accurate,
 but if he's accurate,
 he can, if he has compromise in his life,
 he can, it doesn't mean that he's being intimate.
  </li><li>So, this is a fun one.
 Again, you can tell this is not my question.
 Am I going to get married?
 (laughs)
 Yes, there's a wedding and there's a feast.
 And so, here's what I believe.
 The Lord really gives us the desires of our heart.
 Sometimes we're waiting for God to do
 what he's actually saying.
 If you wanna do that and pursue that and be pursued,
 he gives us permission.
 I think where people get his weary in the waiting.
 And so, and I can only imagine what it's like to be
 a 20, 70, 30, 70, 40, something, your old guy or gal.
 And all you want to do is be a husband and a dad and a wife
 and a mother and it's not happening yet.
 But here's the beautiful thing is,
 is God knows what time it is.
 And sometimes you're just worth the wait.
 I've told my daughter, Eira, this maybe about a year ago
 a few months ago, and it's probably not what she wanted
 to hear.
 I just said, "Honey, you've waited too long not to wait."
 Oh, like you've, you've, you've, you've waited, you've, you've, you've waited for the Lord to do something.
 You've waited for the Lord to answer your prayers, the desires of your heart.
 So if you don't wait, why settle for a counterfeit?
 Can God redeem?
 Absolutely.
 But the best thing I could say as a dad to, to, to a daughter I love, who I know dreams that the Lord showed me about her and dreams that she shared with me herself.
 I go, honey, you've waited too long, not to wait.
 So don't grow weary and well doing.
 Don't grow weary in the waiting for in-do season.
 You'll reap if you faint not.
 So don't make something happen, but at the same time,
 I watch this other thing.
 Well, I'm just waiting for the Lord to send me.
 And so it's almost like people are afraid to engage
 or pursue or be pursued, because they're waiting
 for something supernaturally to happen.
 I believe it can happen like that,
 But loves a choice, right?
 And so every day I wake up, I choose to love Molly.
 Molly wakes up chooses to love me.
 It's probably harder for her on some days than it is for me.
 But you know, it's a choice.
 So she's my right person.
 I'm her right person.
 And so I think just trusting the Lord and his timing and let the Lord.
 What about this?
 I've thought about this sometimes.
 So sometimes the Lord's getting something ready for us.
 But what if we're ready?
 but the one the Lord's bringing for us isn't ready yet.
 So instead I go, Lord, thank you for loving me so much
 that you're taking care of all of their stuff before they even get to me.
 Oh my God.
 That's so important.
 As a little girl, Eris said these words to me at one point.
 I want to be so full of Jesus that any man that wants me has to go through Jesus to get to me.
 So I go.
 The Lord's God, or the Lord's going to bring it in his right timing.
 And so, you know, whoever this is, guy or gal, you're, you're worth the way.
 And you're also worth waiting for.
 And, and I think those things are, are to know, like, I know we get antsy and we go,
 don't you know, my biological clock is ticking and, you know, and my plan and my
 journal, I wrote down that I wanted to be this by my 22nd birthday.
 And, and why if the Lord has something even greater, something, you know,
 So enjoy that. And here's, here's the big question in this. And I'm giving way more information than what you asked. But let the Lord ask you, answer this question to the Lord.
 Am I not enough for you? Because until he's enough for you, no husband, wife, all of those things is ever going to be enough until he's enough. So enjoy that be married to him in this season.
 And at the same time, the more you're filled with him, the more you become a light that your spouse will be attracted to.
 Oh, love it.
 All right.
 Last question.
 How can we best position ourselves to hear the voice of the Lord?
 I think that really the best way to do that is not in all the books you can read and sermons and teachings and school.
 You can go to it all begins with the posture of your heart.
 I think the number one way.
 So he wants to hear this properly.
 So could you repeat that?
 Yes.
 That would be great.
 But I would simply say this that first Corinthians 14 verse one says pursue love.
 And my only motivation is that I love God and I love people.
 The chance of me missing it or at least missing it on purpose is going to be very
 minimal because there's no other pursuit.
 It's not about fame.
 It's not about self promotion.
 It's not about being known.
 It's about knowing him.
 So if I pursue love and I'm pursuing, I love God and I love people.
 I believe the Lord will speak to us all the, all the time because he loves that.
 He's drawn to that and desire a spiritual gifts to it.
 Don't flip them around.
 Don't desire love while pursuing spiritual gifts.
 And I think those things are so important, but also I, I, I think that it's this,
 get around people of like precious faith.
 If you want to grow in the prophetic, get around prophetic people.
 If you want to grow in healing, get around people who flow in healing and catch that,
 be a part of it, live that out and ask the Lord.
 I think we've stopped this understanding or this pursuit which Jesus gave so wonderfully
 and ask, seek a knock.
 Ask it to be given, seek a fine knock that will be open.
 So I'm constantly asking, seeking and knocking.
 Sometimes I get, you know, you know, oh, that's great.
 I'm glad that you asked.
 I'll tell you tomorrow because you're not ready for it today.
 Sometimes I'll seek it and he'll say, you know what, I've got something for you.
 But let me show you my heart before I show you the word.
 And sometimes I'll knock in the Lord of saying, you know, you showed up just a tad bit early
 day.
 But if you just hang out here for a moment, I'm going to open the door and allow you to
 to see things you haven't, but also pay attention to the random.
 I tell people all the time, what I'm teaching on the prophetic,
 by the time I'm done, you're gonna get really angry
 because you've been hearing God your whole life
 and you just didn't recognize it.
 Like you thought maybe it was intuition,
 you thought it was just this or that,
 and really he's been trying to get your attention
 by what you see, what you hear, what you feel.
 So if you're walking down, you're in the mall,
 you're in a restaurant and a name
 when a circumstances pops up, right?
 It's not just like, oh, that's random.
 It's actually revelation flowing through you.
 Start looking, that engage the revelation,
 and then step out in faith.
 And if you miss it, humble yourself
 and tell them you go to a different church
 than where you really go.
 No, no, don't do that.
 But it's so fun.
 It's so fun living a life.
 Don't pursue prophetic ministry
 more than you pursue living a prophetic life.

 So pray for us, Davey.
  </li><li>Well, Father, I just thank you right now
 for everybody watching and listening today.
 And Lord, I pray that you would release the spirit
 of revelation, knowledge and wisdom,
 but more than that Lord, that we you would release
 an encounter with Jesus the prophet
 and encounter with the father's heart,
 that we wouldn't just know the content of prophecy,
 but the intent and the heart behind it.
 Jesus, you said in Revelation 19 and 10,
 the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
 So Lord, I pray that you would give
 everybody accurate prophetic words,
 I give them testimonies that speak back of your goodness
 and of your grace.
 Lord, anybody watching today
 and even connected to the questions
 that may have been wounded or hurt by the prophetic,
 Lord, I pray,
 the Lord, you would heal the prophetic in them.
 Whether they were misunderstood or shut down
 or would you stir up the gift in them again?
 Or maybe they received a word that was wrong or bad
 or just misinterpreted or somebody had a bad day.
 Lord, I pray that you would heal that word in them,
 that you would restore trust, Lord,
 not just in the person who gave the word,
 but even the ability to trust your voice.
 Lord, I believe that Lord, you're bringing so much healing
 to the prophetic ministry.
 And on the other side of everything
 that's happening in this world,
 Lord, I believe the prophetic and healing
 are actually gonna begin to operate together
 in a greater measure.
 And so Lord, would you release that
 to all of the people listening around the world?
 And what I just released, the blessings of God,
 the prophets reward over people today.
 In Jesus name, amen, amen.
 Amen.
 We're done.
