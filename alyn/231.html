<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Hi everyone, we have a very special episode
 of Keeping Up With The Joneses today,
 where we are gonna be interviewing Dr. Chip Dodd,
 who has written the book that we've been talking about
 for the last several weeks.
  </li><li>10 weeks.
  </li><li>Yes, Voice of the Heart.
 So we're super stoked to have him with us
 answering questions in just a few minutes.
  </li><li>And a quick heads up.
 You guys did an amazing job sending us brilliant questions.
 Here's the thing, we didn't get to ask Chip
 all of the questions you sent in.
 So we'd like to apologize for that in advance.
 You'll see why when you watch the interview with Chip.
 Chip is a man of incredible wisdom
 and has a ton of experience.
 So he's a type of person and when he starts talking,
 you just shut up and listen.
 And that's what we try to do.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And he's also quite prophetic.
 So he actually answered a lot of the questions
 that were sent in without us needing to answer
 or without us needing to ask him rather.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was part of when he would start talking,
 we just found, oh wow, a lot of things are getting answered
 just by what you're saying.
  </li><li>And so while we didn't get to ask every question,
 I'm fairly confident we covered most of the topics
 that were sent in. - Yeah.
  </li><li>'Cause it was also fun for us to read through your questions
 and realize so many of you are asking the same thing.
 So I hope you enjoy that.
 Before we introduce daughter Chip,
 just wanted to give you a quick heads up
 that this is gonna be the last episode
 of Keeping Up With The Joneses for the summer.
 And here's why.
 We started this, well, as I said,
 the beginning of the pandemic.
  </li><li>A couple weeks into the pandemic.
  </li><li>We've been doing it now for like 11, 12, 12 weeks.
 We've been doing this.
 Is that right?
 That's three months?
  </li><li>No, I don't think so.
  </li><li>Is it that long?
  </li><li>Yeah, this is our 12th episode.
 So we've done it for three months.
 And what we realized is we love doing it.
 Do not get it wrong.
 We absolutely love it.
 But what it means is I have no weekend
 because we tend to film these like Friday or Saturday
 and then Saturday I'm editing a lot of this.
 And it takes me away from my kids.
 We've got this precious moment.
  </li><li>It takes me away from me.
 Me.
  </li><li>Takes me away from her and she gets.
 (baby crying)
 And you don't get rowed.
 That was a joke but you are not.
 You're very, very patient.
  </li><li>Thank you darling.
  </li><li>But it's our summer.
 Our kids are gonna be going back to school
 in a couple of months.
 I wanna enjoy my summer weekend with my kids.
 Two pieces of good news for you.
 We're not going away for good.
 We are planning on bringing somebody on board in the fall
 to help us with all the production stuff
 because the videoing part when we just talk to you,
 that's part is straightforward.
  </li><li>That's the fun part.
  </li><li>It's all the post-production and editing,
 which is taking a lot.
 So we're gonna have, hopefully somebody join us in the fall
 who's gonna handle all that post-production.
 And also we don't plan on going anywhere.
 We want to do some online live hangs throughout the summer
 to stay up to date with us, to work out when we're back on air
 as keeping up with the Joneses, and when we're doing live hangs online.
 Make sure you follow us on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.
 We'll put a link in the show, and it's for you to find out how to do that.
 But just want to give you a heads up in case you think we just vanished without a reason.
 That's what's going on behind the scenes.
 Yeah, we're vanishing with a reason.
 Yeah.
 Rest.
 Also, Grace Center opens up as a church again this coming Sunday.
 Yes.
 And so we're doing a phased reopening.
 So our lives are about to get a whole lot busier.
 So hopefully we're gonna see you back in the fall,
 but we just want to let you know where we're gonna be gone.
 And hopefully we'll see you the rest of the summer
 doing some live online hangs as well.
  </li><li>So thanks for being with us.
 The last many weeks we have had such a blast.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Talking about emotions, sharing stories,
 answering questions.
 And we're super excited to finish off this series
 with Dr. Chipdog.
 Yeah, we're so excited that you're here.
 Thanks for coming.
  </li><li>I'm so glad to be with you guys.
  </li><li>Oh, we so appreciate you making time out.
 You're a crazy busy schedule to come on the podcast.
 I guess our first question that we want to ask
 before we get to all our listeners' question is,
 where did you get this revelation from?
 Like how did the revelation of the eight gifts,
 the impairments, the feelings,
 where did that come from?
 Tell us that story.
  </li><li>Well, I'll tell you the short, long story is
 My mentor in Texas had been in treatment
 and she was introduced to the basic feelings
 when she was in treatment.
 And she introduced them to me,
 but I began to plumb what they meant,
 where they came from, where they take us,
 the gifts of them, the impairments related to them.
 And honestly, the revelation was for me.
 I mean, before getting into recovery,
 I kind of had this philosophy,
 be strong in body, mind, and spirit kind of thing.
 That was kind of the closest I could get.
  </li><li>Power through.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>But yes, power, exactly,
 climbed the ladder power through.
 It was really willful and had God as an overlay on it.
 But she introduced me to,
 hey, there's something else you left behind.
 And she didn't use the word left behind,
 but it's just like these feelings
 are what we're all running from.
 So I'm like, "Oh, got it."
 And boy, was it true.
 And so I just sort of stepped in.
 My recovery grew like crazy
 because recovery really is a matter of the heart,
 more than it's a matter of action.
 And action actually subsequent to the heart change.
 And I took off from there
 and this came a mold around inside of me for about eight years.
 I was teaching, talking, sharing.
 And in 1991, this happened in 1988, 1991,
 honestly, the spiritual root system,
 the kind of the rest of the story,
 all sort of came to me.
 It's a mixture of experience, education, background,
 getting to PhD, all of it kind of conglomerated.
 And all of a sudden, the spiritual root system,
 how feelings connect to needs, needs to desire,
 desire to long, needs to hope,
 how it touches on the Imago Day.
 And then on top of that, neuroscience, 20 years later,
 climbs on board and goes, oh yeah,
 the ancient things are true.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So it all is just blessed by it, honestly,
 by my own recovery.
  </li><li>How was the book, or the content of the book,
 received in your professional circles?
 It's a model that I love,
 but I'm not in your world,
 I'm not in the mental health world.
 As soon as we start talking about it,
 the first question is, there's more than eight feelings,
 and people have a problem initially
 until they walk through.
 What was it like for you, Professor?
 Has it been received?
  </li><li>Professionally, well, even not just even professionally,
 it was just not really recognized
 until people began to take the book to sessions
 with therapists, with clinicians.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And basically said, you need to read this.
 (laughs)
 So you need to know this
 because this is true.
 Clinicians got involved and said,
 oh my goodness, they began to gather copies.
 But in the very beginning in 1999, 2000,
 I was doing some radio and so like set up
 by the publisher to introduce the book.
 And it was landing like a lead ball, just boom.
 Because anybody would say, you know, Dr. Dodd,
 what's the, what word would you say
 kind of encapsulates everything you're talking about?
 I would say the word surrender,
 which means to get back over that,
 which you're running from,
 get back over to God, which you took from God.
  </li><li>Which nobody wants to get.
  </li><li>No!
  </li><li>And they said, "Well, thank you very much, click."
 I mean, it was over.
 (laughing)
 I've honestly thought the book would honestly believe
 because of what it had done for me
 and my compelled demand within me to write it.
 I honestly thought that it would be like a piece
 of a movement, even a reformation.
 And I remember Sonia said to me, "Chib, your call
 was to just write it.
 You were obedient.
 You listened to yourself.
 You listened to God.
 You just did what you had to do.
 And so you're done.
 So the rest is not up to you.
 I'm like, "Okay."
 And I did not know that not only it wasn't gonna make
 a big splash, but the ripple effect is we're 20 years
 into this thing. And I have watched in that 20 something year period, I have literally watched
 our culture shift related to a resurgence or a ref formation return to how God made us.
 And in the book, guys, it's all over the world quietly. It's just quiet ripples that come up on
 the shore and somebody picks up the shell, takes it home, and it affects their lives.
 I've been amazed what God has done with it.
 Been humbled by what God has done with it.
  </li><li>The feedback we've got from people all over the world
 saying how encouraged they are.
 I mean, it's changing lives.
 It changed our lives.
 It's changed our marriage, changed our family.
 And ironically, as soon as I first read it, I hated it.
 Like I wanted to throw the book across the room.
 It was horrible.
 And then I fell in love with it.
 And I think my sadness is I could have missed it
 because my intellect didn't, you know,
 I wasn't willing to surrender.
 I was really happy being right
 and not realizing I was wrong.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I associated all of those feelings with weakness.
 I mean, I get asked the same questions,
 a bunch about them, how come there are seven bad ones
 and only one good one?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That's an easy answer,
 because we've been given eight feelings,
 eight tools that allow us to live fully
 in a place that's tragic.
 And anyone who says life isn't tragic is psychotic,
 removed from being alive.
 They are on some very powerful drug.
  </li><li>Delusional?
  </li><li>They're delusional.
 They're removed from life.
 And then the thing is, it's really kind of a basic thing.
 It's interesting how we've been trained to hate feelings
 because feelings are tools that bring us to gifts of living.
 But there are only three primary colors.
 They're only basically eight musical notes,
 but nobody protests, you know, nobody's saying--
  </li><li>They have money. - Yeah.
 Feelings are just like primary colors, they're tools.
 And if you learn how to use them,
 you become an artist with all the tones and shades
 of colors and paint.
 And also feelings, they are in and of themselves,
 they're not moral.
 They are like organs of the body.
 Made your lungs are good, your stomach is good,
 your heart is good, your bladder is good,
 and if it's healthy, it gives all the right signals.
 You breathe deeply, you know it's time to pee.
 It's like you eat and eat healthy things
 that help the stomach.
 So feelings are more like just good as in
 they're made of nature and nature's God.
 But the thing is, what you do with them
 is what's going to matter.
 But you know, my eyes are good,
 But I don't wake up in the morning, open my eyes and cover them, go, Oh, I'm sort of
 ashamed I can see.
 But we're somehow we're raised to believe that I'm ashamed because I feel.
 I'm not ashamed because I can breathe.
 I'm not ashamed because I can pee.
 Wow.
 I'm not ashamed because I can see, but I become ashamed because I can feel.
 Right.
 And that's on that's something taught because I could be taught to open my eyes and hate
 myself.
 I could be taught to hate breathing.
 You know,
 is just proof that the culture we're raised in
 could be more powerful than the God who created us
 in some ways, rejecting how we're made.
  </li><li>Let's get, I mean, you're already beginning to answer
 some of the questions that our listeners have sent in,
 which I love, and you're dovetailing already.
 One of the, I mean, the big question,
 the most asked question that we got
 throughout this whole thing can best be summarized.
 It got sent in by many, many people.
 I wanna pick Isaac.
 Isaac, you sent in this question.
 And his question is, can you speak more to the practical
 application of feeling your feelings?
 How do you do it?
 Is it about a mental game of simply accepting the feelings
 you're feeling or are there practical things we should do as
 well to embrace what we're feeling?
 Yeah, that's that is a great question.
 It's a great kickoff question.
 And I can do part answers or sort of a free part answer.
 But number one, we are literally born.
 doing three things and we're powerless over how we're made, but we come into
 life with knowledge. Right. Now that knowledge is not front of low knowledge,
 it's inborn knowledge of how we create a seek relationship to seek life. Right. A
 little baby comes into life and they do three things. The Ap, the Apigar, APGRA,
 They cry out, which means they're expressing being alive, which means to have feelings
 and be in need.
 They're really crying out with fear.
 I'm no longer where I was and I need to be somewhere else.
 I don't want to go back there, but where am I made to be?
 I know where's the person I'm made to be with?
 So they cry out in fear, probably even in loneliness.
 They know to do it.
 All creation knows to do it.
 Everything has animations reaching for life.
 When they reach out, they do this thing called reflex response.
 They literally go, "That's not it."
 They'll say, "That's not it."
 They'll say, "That's not it."
 Then they'll go, "That's it."
 It's called reflex response.
 So they cry out, reach out, and then take in, which means to bring in life into myself.
 And that is inborn.
 It's not conscious.
 It's not spoken.
 It's simply that which we're made to do.
 how we are created. And now neuroscience has backed it up to say we're created to find fulfillment
 through social connection and social contentment. The spiritual root system says we're created as
 emotional spiritual creatures, created to do one thing, live fully, and we can't do it unless we're
 doing a solar relationship. So the feelings are inborn. They come before our capacity to think.
 The feelings are inborn. They're doing what they're made to do. They allow us to cry out,
 reach out and then take in what we're made to have to grow into people who can give the same thing we
 receive. And what's astounding, we're not made to ever leave that behind, guys. But that cry out,
 reach out, take in, that's serving on the Mount. Jesus said, you do not receive because you do not
 ask. He said, ask, which is cry out and you shall receive, seek, which is reach out and you will find
 knock and the door will be open to you and you can take in what's there to feed you. In other words,
 that which we're born like we're never made to leave behind. But Isaac asked like, okay, but what
 is it? What do you do? Well, you feel your feelings, you tell the truth, and you give it to the process.
 God owns the process. Okay, but practically. Okay, what do you do? Okay, here's what you do.
 Number one, you identify. What am I feeling? That's the first question. What am I feeling,
 which is identify? And then the second question, it's hard to get to if you've been raised on a
 heavy diet of body-minded spirit or feelings or weakness or don't be a baby or if you're going
 to belong in matter, you better shut it up kind of thing. It's going to be hard to know.
 But the beauty is they're just eight.
 And so, you know, you can.
 And you can even ask yourself, if you don't know what you're feeling, you can say, okay,
 what would a person who's going through this feel?
 You can guess.
 Wow.
 You can picture somebody else's life because a lot of times we're removed from
 experiencing our own and we can cry over commercials and movies instead of crying.
 That's amazing.
 Yeah.
 That's amazing.
 And we have more empathy for others than we do for ourselves.
 Especially in the church, you know, deny yourself.
 How dare you have feelings?
 Well, we mature out of our emotions, don't we?
 Or we try to mature out of feeling emotions.
 Yeah, and in the book, The Perfect Loss, which I wrote about the Beatitudes, I say there's
 a big difference between adults and grown-ups.
 An adult to someone who wears a mask to hide what they never learned.
 grown up as a person who's remained a child and they grow fully up into how they're created.
 Oh, Chip, that's amazing.
 Back. So you're imagining you're imagining what another human might feel because you can't do it
 for yourself. That's a great key. What else? What other practical steps do you do?
 You can remember what you can you can identify from the standpoint of remembering what you used
 to be like. If you can remember what you used to feel, what you used to know before you kind of
 got rid of you, you can return to yourself. And then, then a identification also, a lot of people
 say they're confused. It's not confused. And, and so confusion is when feelings are just globbed
 together. And you think of confusion from the standpoint of a different colored yarn, eight,
 eight colors of yarn. Well to untangle yarn you just find one end that and pull. Now so you pull
 that one and you can find one that all starts to unravel. So usually it's for sadness. Another
 practical thing is when I don't know what I'm feeling and I can't identify what I'm feeling,
 what's it like using the feeding sheet for me not to know?
 Okay, so,
 okay, so it's so and most of the time, because you have to be willing to say it's
 on the sheet. And the number of times over the past 30 years, I've said, it's on the
 sheet. It's on the sheet. I promise you it's on. No, it's not. Well, what's it
 like for you for me to tell you it's on the sheet and you're telling me it's not.
 And they and I find the word on the sheet.
 and they say fear or they'll say anger or frustrated.
 Well, no, frustrated anger.
 So it's like, what's it like for you not to know?
 What do you feel when you don't know?
 And most of the time a feeling comes with not knowing.
 And then as soon as you don't know
 and you find out what you feel for not knowing,
 you know what you're feeling.
 You hear the paradox of that?
 It's a big circle.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 All of that is stepping outside of yourself to find yourself.
  </li><li>Well said.
 I wish I'd said that.
 That was perfect.
 You can have that for free.
 I've stolen enough of your stuff.
 There's one back.
 I'm in seven miles and you read 10 feet and got it.
 So the second thing we do after identify is explore.
 So identify means what am I feeling?
 An explorer goes and sees.
 A scientist examines the test tube.
 So when you get to exploration, you don't say why am I feeling it.
 Explorers asked four questions, "What, where, when, and how?" So what was happening when this started going on?
 What's familiar about this feeling? How big is this feeling? When did it start? How did it happen? Where did it come from?
 So you're actually at, you're walking into the journey of your heart. You're actually going into your heart and asking for memories.
 Where does this come from? What just happened? What was happening beforehand?
 So you become an explorer in your own life, which is taking the 18-inch journey, the longest journey
 we ever take is not to the moon, and it's not to the bottom of the ocean. It's 18 inches below our
 foreheads to return to how God made us and to reunite. And that's what a person who is living in
 integrity is actually living what needs integrated. Their head, their heart worked together, the
 the parent and the child, the frontal lobe and the limbic system, the head and the heart
 are connected so that real choices get made.
 So anyway, exploration means what am I feeling?
 Where's it coming from?
 What's familiar?
 In other words, you're getting a story.
 Oh, this happened.
 That happened.
 Oh, this is so.
 And then the final thing is express.
 So identify, explore, express.
 And express leads us to the question of who.
 So first we did, what was our feeling?
 Where is it coming from?
 And who do I tell?
 Because we're created for connection.
 We're created to be known.
 We are literally unable to live alone healthy
 in a healthy way, unable we can't do it.
 Isolation is the ultimate punishment.
 But most people would rather die than live alone.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So expression means who do I tell?
 And you only tell someone
 who knows what it's like to have a heart.
 And you don't tell people who are removed.
 That's called evangelism.
 If you want to get your needs met,
 talk to people who know their own hearts.
 If you're gonna evangelize,
 then go knowing that you're not gonna have your needs met.
 You're out there to care about somebody else's needs
 because somebody cared about yours beforehand.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So identify, explore, express for the purpose
 of getting the gifts.
 I don't like feelings personally.
 Yeah.
 Me neither.
 Because seven of them were very painful and then gladness is scary as heck.
 You know, so I was like...
 Right.
 Yeah.
 But we do the feelings so we can experience the gifts and the gifts are worth the pain.
 That's beautiful.
 That journey was just so beautiful, Chip.
 That explanation, you've answered my next three questions.
 Sonya says about me. She said somebody asked you what time it is.
 You you go describe how a watch was invented. So you know, some of us.
 You go ahead.
 My favorite description I've ever heard about you is I think I forget which one of your staff said it said asking chip a question is like getting in a car and someone releases a thousand butterflies.
 [laughter]
 It is so embarrassing, but that's a beautiful, I love that one.
 Oh, it's beautiful.
 You start talking and there's so many other questions that come from it.
 And you answer so many of them in the process.
 But Stanley asked this question, which you have already partly answered.
 But Stanley's question was, how do you process an overwhelming feeling
 that is made up of multiple layers of the eight feelings?
 And you answered that with the, you know, the, the ball of yarn of eight colors.
 But he said, how do you handle processing through your feeling
 When in the middle of feeling the truth, the feel shifts to another feeling.
 One thing is it's really important that we have other people in our lives to share with.
 Aristotle said that a friend doubles your joys and shares your burdens or halves your sorrows.
 In Ecclesiastes, pity the person who falls into a ditch and there's no one there to give him a hand to come out.
 So overwhelmed means not capable of doing alone.
 Okay.
 So that's important to know.
 And then secondly, I think it's very important to do two things.
 One is to trust your body, trust your heart.
 In other words, your heart knows when it's had enough.
 Okay.
 Because you're talking, Stanley's talking about going to deeper levels
 where there's more and more.
 Some people say, if I start crying, I'll never stop.
 And it's like, no, what's amazing is you'll start crying and your body will stop.
 And at that point, you know, it's time to go eat some ice cream.
 Amen.
 Go take a shower, smoke a cigarette or what.
 But what I mean by that is your body has its own timing.
 Just like a little baby knows when it's hungry and knows when it's
 diaper needs to be changed and cries out, reaches out, takes in the experience of
 coming back to homeostasis or our contentment.
 So your body knows when to stop.
 And the second thing is you've got to parent yourself in the territory of processing past pain or present experiences that are overwhelming.
 You've got to be kind. Parents are kind to children who are overwhelmed.
 So number one, trust your body because your body is always your mind, your brain, your heart.
 God created us to seek health, seek holace.
 So trust the journey, so to speak.
 And number two, be kind.
 I mean, really identify like,
 I don't wanna go there right now.
 I'm not ready to do that.
 So just be willing to lean into your life.
 You don't have to dive in.
 But that's, that a lot of times that's like,
 that can be like torturous,
 or just trying to get it over with, say you did it.
 were made to grow, not get things to get things over with.
  </li><li>So bouncing off what you just said, Chip,
 we actually have a great question from Erica
 that has a lot to do with a bunch of what you said
 and more specifically fear.
 So I'm just gonna read you the question.
 She writes, "What does letting yourself feel fear
 "in a healthy way look like?"
 I started having anxiety attacks at the age of 12
 in a series of major life traumas has only added to it.
 When big fears come, I generally shift
 into high functioning numbness
 with an occasional outburst of panic.
 I don't have a grid for what healthy fear looks like.
  </li><li>Healthy fear is a feeling we've been given
 whenever we're experiencing what we think of as danger.
 Now, I'll touch on anxiety just a second,
 But fear is there to allow us to be babies, to be human, to be grown-ups, all three, in
 a developmental process.
 But fear is a feeling that's there to let us ask or cry out for and reach out for help.
 Fear is a feeling that's saying, "Hey, will you help me?"
 And help comes in, identify people helping me identify consequences.
 If you go do this, this is probably going to happen.
 It helps me learn from life to recognize danger so I don't have to repeat it.
 It allows me to practice results.
 Like today, hooking up all this equipment, this was like hooking up equipment for me.
 It's just like another day for you.
 So I practiced before, you know, I got it all set up before we connected with each other.
 And I called two guys and say, "Now, how is this going to work?
 And what am I going to do?
 And what is this exactly?
 I need to remember."
 Because I was scared.
 So I was asking people to help me, so I wouldn't get on this with you guys.
 And then all of a sudden I get anxious, I go to the toxic shame, I just shut my computer
 and run home or just fake it, but not be present.
 So fear is a feeling that allows us to ask for help.
 And when help arrives, then what happens is we start to develop this thing called trust,
 faith, and even wisdom.
 We start to develop this belief that you know what?
 I'm not alone.
 So fear done well, basically allowing me to ask for help from the right people, which
 which means people who understand that you don't fix life,
 you will learn how to live life.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>No fix, there's no place to go to get away
 from having to be in this struggle.
 Anxiety though is often provoked
 and becomes a physiological response
 to not being able to live in a place where fear was respected.
 I'll repeat that.
 that anxiety, especially when kids were younger
 and when anxiety becomes pronounced,
 what it is, it's diagnosing that they're growing up
 in a place in which fear is not respected
 as a tool that allows us to grow stronger.
 That the fear that was spoken was diminished.
 For example, William, my youngest son,
 is really, especially younger years,
 frightened of tornadoes. We had a storm, terrible storm hit our home and we had a little tornado
 room and the door was open and I was the last one to get in and when I was sitting on the
 edge waiting to the last second he was saying, "Dad, get in, Dad, get in, Dad, get in." I said,
 "William, I will, I promise, I will." And unfortunately I didn't need to. I mean, the storm passed through.
 The house was intact, damaged, but intact.
 A month later storms were coming through again.
 I was watching the weather upstairs.
 He comes upstairs and he's pulling on my pants.
 I'm watching the weather trying to get a sense of when it's, he said, "Dad, Dad, Dad."
 I said, "Wait a minute.
 Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, please, Dad.
 Is it going to be bad?
 Is it going to be bad?
 Is it going to be bad?
 Dad, he was being in need.
 He was being in fear.
 He was being in, depending on me."
 And then he said, "Dad, stop there.
 "Please pray, Dad, please pray."
 "Then what's it gonna be?"
 I mean, he was just, he was being himself.
 And I took my hand and kind of what swatted his hand.
 We had stopped it.
 I'm trying to watch the weather.
 And then I got a grass, not realizing what I was doing.
 And then I turned around and he wasn't there.
 He'd gone downstairs.
 He was gonna have to take life on by himself.
 His fear was judged as ridiculous.
 He still had the fear in him.
 He was hurt when I went downstairs.
 I said, "Well, I'm so sorry."
 He said, "Never mind that."
 I'm like, "Uh-oh."
 So he and his hurt was clearly led,
 "Dad, I don't trust you right now,
 and I'm embarrassed,
 and you humiliated my vulnerability.
 And I was just being what God made me to be.
 I was in St. Ed. Pray.
 And you rejected the most vulnerable
 experience a human being can have, which is said, would you pray for me? Would you pray with me?
 I am so scared. The man who's there to always pray with him, swatted his hand.
  </li><li>Wow. - Which was a go away message. So what he's left to is because fear isn't working, isn't alive.
 The body, remember we mentioned earlier, is always seeking homeostasis, is seeking health.
 So his body has to take over to try to do what his emotions are made to do.
 See, his emotions are made to tell me, tell him to reach out to me.
 But now anxiety has to take the place.
 He's got to handle it by himself.
 Then when fear comes, it turns into the threat of helplessness,
 the potential repetition of being swatted away and, and, and to wind up alone.
 So anxiety is really a, a, a, a rejection of the voice of the heart.
 because when you had your voice, nobody listened.
  </li><li>Wow. - Wow.
  </li><li>So anxiety is an expression of helplessness
 that we have experienced before.
 And usually it's old stuff.
 But then if we're into Nile,
 and we can't pinpoint where the story began,
 we assume something's defective about us,
 and that's where the panic attack comes in.
  </li><li>Wow.
 I'm alone, I'm going to die, no one's there to help me, you know, that whole world.
 And by the way, we all get anxious, anxiety is part of life.
 Because it's fight, flight, freeze.
 I mean, things happen in this life like tornadoes.
 And tornadoes are there to bring us to a fight, flight, or freeze experience.
 We're made to run like crazy, or fight like crazy.
 But our problem is that when it comes to daily life, and we have fight, flight, freeze related
 to daily life.
 about unhealed lack of permission to be God made you to be in the past.
 So you were just talking there about like anxiety is always old, talking about
 growing up in an environment, a family of origin where, you know, your fear is not
 validated, your fear is not honored.
 With a question from Brian, we had some great questions about families and kids.
 Brian asks, can you share tips about how to help your kids understand and
 navigate their emotions and feelings well.
  </li><li>All these questions are phenomenal.
 I recommend that he get the book "Parenting with Heart."
 Because I would say the number one recommendation I have
 for parents raising children is to remember
 what it was like to be a child.
  </li><li>What if you don't?
 then you will accidentally squish your child's feelings.
 'Cause you're gonna be rendered helpless.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>And that's why we're in therapy.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Yeah, welcome to our club.
 You know, that's all of us.
 Because, I mean, listen, number one thing is,
 every parent is going to harm their children.
 It doesn't make a difference who you are.
 Sank whoever you're gonna harm your children.
 And that's the beauty of remembering
 what it's like to be a child.
 A person who's doing everything they can to run away
 from having to be human.
 They're also running away from the most beautiful thing
 that a child knows how to do.
 And human beings, the beauty is that we're capable
 of seeking forgiveness.
 And that's the two things of a parent,
 remembering what it was like to be a child and staying in contact with the
 feeling that of guilt, of knowing like, Oh gosh, from the standpoint of empathy,
 when I was a child, that would have really hurt me.
 When I was a child, that would have really rendered me sad.
 When I was a child, I would have really gotten that that kid is scared.
 Like when I was a child, I would have really wanted to pull in my daddy's
 pants and say, Daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, but at a young age, I learned to
 don't do it.
 Now, if my rules of don't do it become my children's way of functioning, then what I'm doing is I'm
 passing generational pain onto the children. Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. But if I'm able to identify
 my feelings, have explored them and had a process with other grownups about them,
 then I can hear that child because I was one and I can respond accordingly. And if I don't,
 I'm capable of recognizing that and going to that child and saying,
 I'm asking you to forgive me.
 You know what children are hungry to do?
 We unite, reconcile.
 Right.
 Back.
 Yeah, they're great at it.
 Absolutely.
 Because William needed to sit in his hurt like I'm done with you, dad.
 He needed to be able to keep his hurt to see if I would really pursue
 and a parent really has to know what it's like to be.
 Remember what's like to be a child, the parent or child.
 Can't give what you don't have.
 Wow.
 The gift of God in children is that they want to know what was it like when you were a child.
 Like all the stories my children ask of me is, tell me story when you're a little boy.
 They love it.
 And that's God's gift of getting me to remember what it was like to be a boy.
 Oh, that's a great example because they're asking the question over and over again.
 You remember what it's like to hurt.
 You remember what it's like to laugh.
 You remember what it's like to be said.
 Tell me a story about bravery.
 How you overcame, how you broke it hard healed.
 Yes.
 That is so great. In fact, you know, I say this a lot, unless a person can tell their story
 and the feelings that go with it, you probably need to know that they're not very safe people.
 Unless a person can tell their story and the feelings that go with it,
 then they're probably not somebody that you can be close to because they're shut off.
 So there's the gift that parents can give children and it's the gift that children are seeking parents to get back.
 Like you just said, it was beautiful.
 Here's a question that would go along with that chip. Like, so I, I'm somebody who can tell my story to adults.
 I sometimes struggle with like, because our kids, whenever we go camping, we're sitting at the campfire, they're like,
 Tell us a story about when you were a little old. My childhood is not really a nice story.
 It is not even PG 13. It's not. It's dreadful. And I don't have very many nice memories to tell.
 So I've told the nice ones, but I'm also we're sort of in this stage where, you know, we have a
 13 year old and we have an 11 year old and we have a seven year old and they're all capable of
 probably processing different things. So like the 13 year old actually knows that my dad killed
 himself. She doesn't know that I tried to. So I'm sort of like with that kind of stuff like I don't
 want to traumatize my children by telling them what my childhood was like but I also
 do want to validate them make them feel connected. I you know but I don't want to make up stuff either.
 Stories are like books.
 They take a long time to write and a long time to read.
 And so you said it beautifully seven, 11 and 13.
 Yes.
 And those are all developmental chapters.
 And the seven year old chapters are very different than the 13 year old chapters
 and are going to be different than the 18 year old chapters in the 22 year old
 chapters. Just as your life is unfolding, you're unfolding your life backwards to your children.
 And my sons, both of them, were, I believe, like 16 and 18 before I said, and here's the rest of
 of the story. Wow. And they knew, you know, grew up in addiction and what the results
 were and the recovery. And but all along the way, I'm validated their feelings, but also
 having some boundaries. And you know, honestly, one of the sort of the end of the story that
 reintroduce them to me before they knew me. It was amazing that I had gone on a retreat
 with my youngest son and he asked me a very challenging question. I said, "Hey, you want
 some more chips and dip. In other words, I know. And so he picked up on, "Okay, I'm
 going to drop it." So I thought, "Okay, I'm out of this." And then the next morning,
 see kids know, they listen, they pay attention. And if they're alive and
 hard, they're going to come back around to ask again. So the next morning, he came
 back to the very topic that I had successfully avoided. He said, "Damn, what
 about so and so I'm like, hey, well, you're listening outside.
 And so we started talking and then we came home from the
 retreat, which I considered a disaster. But it was like a
 disaster in God's hands. And in God's processes are so scary
 because we don't we have ores in the bulb, we don't control the
 water. We can we can we can but it's the river, the river is
 what we've got to navigate. And I got home and called Sonia, said, Hey, look,
 Sonia, here's, here's what's happened. And it's time for all of us to talk for
 them to know what, what you know, and for them to know, you know, the rest of the
 story. And what was amazing was my, my, one of the oldest son said to me, he said,
 "Dad, that's how come I believe in the Bible."
 He said, because it's about real people living real struggles, struggles with real redemption.
 And he said, I don't even know the man you're talking about.
 I don't know. I don't know that man. So, I think the stories need to be told,
 and God will bring you opportunities. You'll see wisdom as when. But wisdom,
 wisdom just means knowing when. It doesn't mean there's some special moment.
 wisdom is all about timing.
 It's like and life will bring it to you.
 God will bring it to you and you'll be ready when it's time.
 But I think like what you brought up, I think kids need to know not every detail,
 not where we slip off into our own trauma that's unfinished.
 Yeah, the stories of our lives, they need to know because we're still here.
 And we're doing because they need to hear the perseverance, the redemption,
 the reconciliation, the strength that came from sorrow.
 Yeah, even though the sorrow never ends.
 Do you see what I'm saying?
 Yes.
 I think I think that makes a lot of sense to me.
 I know with with Abby, when when I did tell her, I didn't, I'm obviously
 going to tell her details or anything like that, but just sort of I was with
 her and she asked and I was like, I was just like checking in with Holy Spirit.
 Is this going to be good timing for this?"
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I felt like he said, "Yep."
 And so I just sort of very generally explained
 that what my father had chosen.
 But with Tia, because she's a lot younger
 and she's very connected to all of her feelings,
 all of the time, which is totally fine.
 I didn't feel like, you know, as a 10-year-old
 at the time, you need to know this information.
 So I don't know if I did the right thing,
 but I was just like, "Hey, I don't think Mummy's really ready
 to talk about it yet.
 Would it be okay if we waited until you were a little bit
 older?"
 And then I answered that question.
 And so she said, "Sure, Mummy."
  </li><li>It's so beautiful.
 It's so beautiful.
 And like you did a relationship, you saw the Holy Spirit,
 you listened to like your spirit
 in conversation with the Spirit, you know?
 You saw Hell and you trusted love.
 You also trusted the developmental capacity
 and discern differences between your children.
 I mean, look at how much is happening, it's amazing.
 And then you took the risk
 and with the other one, you had a boundary.
 And all she needs to know is that you're present,
 you're gonna stay and that you're her mommy.
 She just needs you to be yourself and have an identity.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you had the identity of saying,
 "Let's talk about that at another time."
 She said, okay, in other words, and she trusted you well.
  </li><li>Oh good, yeah, I feel better.
 Good.
  </li><li>But that's beautiful.
 I mean, you know, look at, you have gone through a hill
 and the child walks and lived and survived and now thrives.
 And so you can tell the story of how you are here.
 And that's gonna be nothing but testimony in the future
 that which was once your shame will be your victory, you know?
 Yeah.
 And your children, your children will admire you.
 Thank you.
 Okay.
 So this is a great question.
 Um, I'm going to pivot slightly to a, the spiritual aspects of some of the
 emotion type questions.
 So, um, this question is from Will and he asks, uh, I believe father, Jesus
 spirit, experience all the emotions and show us how to live fully from the heart.
 The one that causes problems for me is God feeling guilt.
 Guilt seems to be predicated upon sin, yet God also seems to express guilt, regret, in
 scripture.
 What's your perspective on both God feeling all the emotions and guilt specifically?
 Okay, this is beautiful. I've been doing a lot of, I say a 30/15, says that in repentance
 and rest is your salvation. And then it goes on to say in quietness and trust is your strength,
 which means in all cases dependency, turning away from self-will and coming back home,
 home because in repentance it rests as your salvation. The word salvation is Yeshua, which we as Christians know is Jesus in the Old Testament.
 It's Yeshua. Come home. Come home to how you're made. Come home to who you're made to be. Come home to who you're made to be, relationally.
 And come home, finally to what you're made to do, like with total redemption.
 And so repentance means just putting down warfare, just putting down my own way, putting down
 that which I'm running from.
 Sometimes because we're sick and tired, sometimes because it's not working, mostly because we're
 just tired, otherwise we won't repent, you know?
 But coming home.
 And what was amazing was Jesus is like us in every way, except one way.
 never needed to repent. So Jesus had no guilt. How come? Because Jesus never left home. Now what I mean
 by that is it doesn't mean yeah this is amazing. So you go to the Garden of Guess Semine and
 in the Garden of Guess Semine, here's our living proof of how he's like us and yet he never left
 tone. The word that is described to us, Agonista, that he was in agony. Jesus, our Jesus, God's
 son, our Savior, clawed the ground and weeping. And he begged God. He was so afraid. Jesus was so
 afraid. He said, "God, please, please, please, please. I'm so scared. God, please, please.
 Don't, don't do this. Don't do this. Do we have to do this?" And he said, "I don't leave my friends.
 I've got friends, God, especially three of them, they're just wonderful and I really want to stay
 with them, you know, is in our circle. And the people, it's going to be painful, right? It's
 going to be terrible. God's going to be so bad, Jesus. In fact, it's going to be so bad. There's
 going to be one moment that it's going to just be so bad for both of us. My God, my God, why have
 I was forsaken me. And finally he came to, "Do I have to do it? This cup, your will be done. Do
 I have to do it?" God says, "Yes." And Jesus said, "Okay. Okay. For the joy set before me,
 but please God." I mean, that was the one who never left home. He never left connection.
 He walked through everything we walked through, but never left connection. So he never had guilt.
 So he never had to repent because he always stayed in the connection of
 dependency upon God.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Something we can't do.
 So God has no guilt, but God can have sadness.
 God can have regret.
 Jesus had fear.
 Jesus had anger.
 Jesus had loneliness.
 I'm a man of sorrows.
 And think about this.
 Jesus was always getting away.
 He was always staying connected.
 I mean, there was lots to be done, but he...
 I mean, he was like a bad employee.
 I mean, if we had hired him,
 (laughing)
 you know, if we had hired him,
 we had fired him.
 It's like, hey, you're off the job.
 You're just walking away from the clock, you know?
 What do you mean you're eating at 10 o'clock?
 'Cause, you know, and I'm kidding.
 I'd be ridiculous, but he would often go away to pray.
 And he dropped the 5,000 to go with the 40.
 I mean, he had his chance to really do mass distribution,
 you know, to fix everything.
 And he said, no, no, no.
 So the question of God's guilt,
 that God can have,
 I've said that I made man from Genesis six.
 I see what they've done with my creation.
 But see, God is our God, the ultimate shepherd.
 He never stops asking the first question he ever asked,
 which is where are you?
 And the answer in the book,
 the whole description, the answer is emotional.
 The answer is emotional.
 In other words, sharing in the heart.
 I was afraid, so I hid.
 I took my need, I took my feelings, it was silent,
 I took my needs and went into denial.
 Instead of I took my feelings and cried out
 and used my feelings to find the rest of me
 to tell you about it.
 So our struggle is between hiding out versus crying out.
 Our daily job is to cry out,
 meaning feel your feelings, tell the truth
 give to the process and God owns the process. So I mean, I got it. No guilt.
 Great answer. So good. Thank you. So good. I have another question from a spiritual
 perspective. This is from Marissa. Marissa asks, how can you tell a difference
 between an emotion that's truly an emotion versus an emotion that also has a
 spiritual component? Like with fear, what are some signs that what you're
 actually dealing with is a spirit of fear and not just the feeling of fear
 that has a gift within it.
 You know, I think that the spirit of fear becomes actually what is a chronic anxiety.
 Okay.
 And God cares about our anxiety in 1 Peter 5, like 6, 7 and 8.
 It's not about your anxiety as a sin.
 He says, cast all of your anxiety upon him because he cares for you.
 And see, anxiety is about, I'm going to wind up alone, helpless alone, and be, you know,
 gotten whatever that means, gotten humiliated, strangled, die, killed, whatever, helpless.
 But God sent everything that you care about, anything that bothers you, bothers me.
 Right.
 In other words, you're not alone.
 But he goes on to say, but be where, you know, brothers and sisters, for the deceiver
 prowls about like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour anyone indiscriminate. See, the first
 part says he cares for you. The second part, the deceiver just prowls looking for meat.
 And what's amazing is lions hunt the same way hyenas do. They hunt for stragglers.
 Lions and hyenas do not attack the herd. This is the case in which this isn't the line of Judah,
 this is just the animal that seeks, that prays on the victim. So what is it that makes a human
 a straggler or a victim, what happens is when we don't use our voices to stay connected to others
 in God, that's when we become straggles. So the spirit of fear, I think, is predominantly anxiety
 that doesn't translate into neediness. Anxiety that does not translate into neediness.
 So a spirit of fear becomes anxiety oriented and controlling in nature.
 Having been given a spirit of fear, but a spirit of courage, which means full-hearted
 participation and willingness to speak what's happening inside of you.
 And because you know you're never alone, you will dare to step out even when it looks like you are alone.
 It dispels what the spirit of anxiety or the spirit of I'm by myself.
 Great answer, Chip. Yeah, another another thing too, by the way, is that fear, healthy fear, prepares
 us for battle, prepares us for daily life. It's being in need, asking for help, practicing results,
 getting prepared. Fear gets you ready for daily life or ready for battle, but anger takes you to
 it. Anger actually takes you to battle. See, anger is the action, emotion, not rage, anger.
 anger in the gift of anger is passion, which is a willingness to be in pain for something that matters more than pain.
 You haven't been given a spirit of fear to let fear control you. Fear is there to prepare you to get ready to go do what matters to you.
 Right.
 And if you're in intimacy with God and you know that God has done for you, what you can't do for yourself,
 you want to, when you see other people suffering like you want suffered, you can't help.
 I don't want to say, man, you don't have to live like this.
 And somebody says, get away from me.
 Get out of here.
 I'm like, I'll leave in a minute,
 but I want to tell you something first.
 I was once you.
 And see, that's the spirit of fear is not in control.
 Anxiety control, you know, having to be direct,
 direct by environment is what anxiety makes us do.
 That's the spirit of fear.
 Brilliant.
 Wow.
 How are we doing?
 I think I've got time for one more question.
 Is that okay?
 Yeah, great.
 Yeah, I'm loving it.
 Hey, you know, it was up to me. We'll do all day. We'll do it next time.
 This is a great question, Chip, and see where our thinking leads us.
 So I think for me, out of all the feelings in the book, the one that I wrestled
 with the most and had the most gladness about once I think I understood your
 revelation was was shame.
 And so the beautiful gift of shame is understanding I'm human.
 I've got limitations.
 I've got glorious gifts and wonderful limitations.
 and it allows you to show grace.
 It allows you to have grace for yourself.
 Like I'm, yeah, you're right, I am limited.
 In community, you get to have an appreciation
 of that same grace for others.
 Like in the same way that I'm limited, AJ is limited.
 My parents are limited, we all have limitations.
 At what point does the grace that we show to others
 turn to emmeshment or codependency?
 as in, "My grace for you, Chip,
 it then excuses your responsibilities."
 Because I'm, I'm saying, "Oh, well, you're just limited."
 Does that question make sense?
  </li><li>Yes. Yeah, and that's,
 we'll need to do a whole other podcast on that one.
  </li><li>Let's do it.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm serious, let's organize that.
 I'd love to do that, but, okay, so,
 healthy shame is a willingness to acknowledge
 being human and as a human have feelings about being human and the impact of other humans
 on me and impact of being on other humans. So that is the capacity to have mercy about
 limits but also the capacity to have boundaries. In other words, like, look, I didn't do this.
 I did this. I mean, you know, I, when we use when a healthy
 shame becomes toxic shame is when we end up saying, you're
 limited, I'm limited. And therefore I have no boundaries.
 Right.
 But because I'm limited, I shouldn't have any feelings
 shouldn't, should, I shouldn't have any feelings about this.
 Well, the truth is, I was with this beautiful couple this
 morning before we got on. And he is work addicted. And below that, he is validation
 addicted. And below that, he's control addicted. Okay.
 Well, that sounds like a party.
 Yeah. And the guy is amazing. He's brilliant. He's fabulous. And he grew up as a
 tortured soul. My father that just did not care. I mean really like just didn't care. So he,
 she says, you know, I know, I said, I know he can't help it. Okay. Where he grew up and how it
 happened. And I'm saying that's correct. He has an addiction. And I look at him and say,
 and you didn't cause your addiction, nobody plans to be a slave to these things that you can't help.
 You can't stop. And he says, but I apologize for my addiction. I said, you can't. You didn't cause
 it. You can't apologize for it. However, you're responsible for dealing with it. And so to the
 spouse, what do you feel about him having an addiction? Well, I feel angry. What do you feel
 about being angry. I feel ashamed. I feel like I shouldn't be angry because he can't help it.
 I said that's correct. He can't help it. However, it's his responsibility to deal with that he's,
 it's not his fault, but he's got to deal with it. And I look at him and say, it's not your fault,
 but you got it. It's like diabetes or cancer. You got it. Now, what are you going to do about it?
 And you could be angry at his addiction without being angry at him. And you could be angry at him
 for not dealing with his addiction. So healthy shinning permits the truth to be spoken in all of
 its in glorious glory. In other words, she could have her feelings and have boundaries and still
 have mercy. Right. And if she chooses not to have feelings about that, that's when you're moving
 into codependency and emasumen. Well, it isn't just fall. And you know, I don't have a right to be
 angry about it because you don't know how hard his childhood was. And so you start making excuses
 rather than recognizing its limitation and you're allowed to have feelings about that.
 Yes, you know, my recovery is very much connected to,
 honestly, I used other people have it worse almost to my own death.
 Wow. Wow, you're a good Christian then. Exactly. And so I didn't have a right to have
 feelings or right to have pain because other people's pain. Yes. So my toxic shame worked into,
 I shouldn't feel this, I shouldn't be like this, I should be all mercy and grace and goodness
 and be stronger than other people. So when it finally came to me that my I'm created to feel
 and I was always ashamed of being human and ashamed of having feelings and the the
 invention that you're describing is like this woman who would let's say she would say well I
 shouldn't feel this way about it. What we're really doing is running from contempt
 towards ourselves to be human. A person who's a caretaker, enmeshed or hero is
 contemptuous towards themselves for being human. And so the moment they
 don't have mercy but instead have anger, the moment they don't have grace instead
 have hurt, the moment they have a boundary instead of being per, you know,
 what's it perforated? The moment they have an identity or a boundary, they see themselves
 as bad or guilty. Wow. So the caretaker, the enabler and the hero are all sick people
 who are ashamed of having their own needs. That's me. Yes. Oh, what a great place to
 end. Well, Chip, thank you so much for coming. Oh, AJ, I loved it. AJ, thank you. Yeah.
 Yeah, and Al, thanks for inviting me, you and AJ.
 Thank you so much.
 I love your show.
 It's such a pleasure.
 I'm still like, oh, weepy item.
 I'm sure I'm going to cry some afterwards.
 But mostly gladness.
 So thank you so much.
 Yeah, thank you so much for giving up your time.
 Also putting your life's work into these books.
 What can we do if people want to get more of you?
 Like where do they go to get more chipdod?
 They can go to chipdod.com.
 where they're podcasting also.
 Go ahead, it sounds so self-promotion,
 but get the books, get the books.
  </li><li>Yeah, do. - It needs a perfect loss.
 And then hope in the age of addiction comes out,
 I think July 20th.
 And that's gonna be, I think that's gonna be
 a pretty profound book, even though the publisher
 would not let me or Steven go all the way with it,
 but it's gonna be a pretty profound book
 talking about the pandemic of addiction, which is that which
 competes against how God made us.
 It's what addiction is.
 Wonderful. Well, thank you, Dr.
 Chip, for being with us. We so appreciate it.
 We'll put a link in the show notes to everything that Chip just
 mentioned, but we appreciate your time today.
 Thanks so much for being with us and with our listeners.
 Thank you. I appreciate it.
 So big thanks to Chip for being with us.
 Big thanks to everybody who's been listening and everybody who's
 been with us these last 10, 11, 12 weeks, I've completely lost count.
 Yeah, thanks for all your encouragement and your feedback.
 We've had a lot of fun on this journey with you.
 And we look forward to being with you in the fall.
 We pray that your summer is glorious, that it's restful and that you're
 recharged and this whole work that we've been doing in emotions produces huge
 dividends for you, your family and your community.
 We look forward to seeing you in the fall.
