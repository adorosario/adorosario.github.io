<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end an AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Age of Jones? - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>You look resplendent tonight.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>It feels like you've completely skipped fall
 and gone straight to winter.
  </li><li>I would wear this sweater in the fall as well.
  </li><li>For those who are not watching the podcast, you can't see,
  </li><li>Ages wearing a chunky knit white Santa Claus.
  </li><li>It's not Santa Claus.
  </li><li>It's a cow-lneck, it's not a mock-turtle neck.
  </li><li>It's called Santa Claus with wear.
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>When he's kicking the boots up.
  </li><li>What in what world?
  </li><li>Takes his wooly hat off.
  </li><li>Okay, wow, you've spent a lot of time thinking about this.
 It is just an off-white comfy warm sweater.
  </li><li>Your all is gold.
 And I am in a Hawaiian shirt because it's been roasting today.
  </li><li>Yes, but I came home from being away
 and the house is a refrigerator.
  </li><li>In part, not my fault.
 Our nest thermostat is gotten so old now
 that the battery that keeps it fully charged keeps draining
 and it had set itself to 69 degrees.
  </li><li>Is that what happened?
  </li><li>That's literally what happened to me.
  </li><li>I literally was like, my fingers are like little icicles.
  </li><li>And I was thinking, man,
 our house feels perfect right now.
 And then I saw you shivering and chattering your teeth.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>And a weekly update.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>You say you just got back home, where have you been?
  </li><li>We had our small group leaders retreat.
 So normally we would have had it a couple of weeks ago,
 but we had some, you know, COVID related,
 needed to make a different decision scenarios.
 And so we, for the most part,
 all of us got to go away, we were missing one.
  </li><li>You left Thursday, came back Sunday.
 I had to fend for myself.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>May or may not, I've had ice cream for breakfast
 Friday morning while you're gone.
 I can check the video.
 I actually had deep suspicions that you were checking the video all weekend.
 I didn't.
 I didn't check it all weekend because you knew I'd tell the truth about myself.
 Yes.
 Well, yeah, or the Holy Spirit would write you out either way.
 Well, who got who got there first?
 You did.
 You did.
 Yeah.
 Do you have a good time?
 Yeah, it was great.
 I've been on one of those for such a long time.
 Well, what do you do?
 You're so hazing.
 Training.
 Yeah.
 Hazing.
 Yeah.
 No, we just do a bunch of different kinds of training, like how to host MC meeting, how to host or MC or small group.
 That kind of stuff, ministry, like just some basic things, prayer, deliverance, that all that.
 So how do you feel about running effectively for schools?
 First year, second year on.
 I feel more stressed when you call it for schools.
 It's two different school years, but only two schools.
 Let's call it two schools.
  </li><li>Well, it's not because you got one online school
 and you got one in person.
  </li><li>Yes, and then two school years for each.
  </li><li>Hence my Ford discrete school.
  </li><li>School years.
  </li><li>It's gonna be okay.
 (laughs)
 I start teaching tomorrow.
 I have not taught in person at ASOSL for two years.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, not strictly, but this.
  </li><li>Yeah, we recorded it.
  </li><li>Yeah, we recorded it all last year.
 I'm excited, I'm teaching here in God's voice tomorrow.
  </li><li>Yeah, that'll be great.
  </li><li>So you went away while you were away,
 What did I do? Oh, I went to movie theater for again, the first time in like 18 months.
 Wow.
 Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Marvel's latest installment,
 were a bit of Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. So this kind of new installment came out.
 I've been watching all of them with my 14 year old and I said, "Abby, do you want to go
 to the movie theater with me?" And so I checked and I booked our seats, who went to the iMacs
 theater. There was 20 people in the whole theater.
 And then iMacs.
 Yeah, which seats don't have any hundreds of people.
 Everyone was wearing masks and it was just glory. I just love theaters anyway movie theaters cinemas what we call them
 Yeah, yeah
 Really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was a great spectacle and then I did what else I did with the kids
 Oh, I'd start the year start of the year feels like a year start of the week
 I had a COVID scare I was exposed to somebody who tested positive for COVID so I was in
 Like quarantining or isolation until I could get tested, but it was a false
 Alarm for me. You didn't get any symptoms or anything either. So anything else?
 I'm trying to think apparently you sung some pretty strange songs to the children you put them to bed at night based on the text messages I was getting.
 That's not new. That's like par for the course. Yeah, it's odd though.
 I don't know if there's anything else. No, I had to take over Tia's the cleaning of Tia's fingers because you were gone.
 one finger, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, Tia has a metal rod in her finger,
 but the metal rod sticks out and so the--
  </li><li>It's a pin.
 Metal rod makes it sound like it's like--
  </li><li>It is like, you know, rebar.
 It's a big piece of rebar.
  </li><li>That's what it sounds like a metal rod.
  </li><li>Pin.
  </li><li>It's a pin, that's what they call it.
  </li><li>Is it a metal?
  </li><li>It's a metal pin.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay, so she's a metal pin.
  </li><li>It's a size of a pin, friends, not a--
  </li><li>So you say pin and I think like a needle.
 It's like bigger than that.
  </li><li>No, it's not.
 Just that ball in the end that protects it isn't.
  </li><li>But it's pink.
  </li><li>She has a piece of metal sticking out of her finger
 that is an open wound that we have to clean twice a day
 with what do we do, hydrogen peroxide and saline solution?
 And then dress it and I've become a boss at it.
 But I'm glad you're back to do it.
  </li><li>Yeah, I know you are.
 She's glad I'm back too.
 She said you bumped into it a few times with your elbow.
  </li><li>Yeah, I kind of did.
 Abby had a homecoming dance,
 which I don't know anything about that.
 apparently has nothing to do with being at home.
 No, no.
 Well, that was it.
 That can't be.
 I'm just checking my notes to see if there's anything else we wrote about on our home
 on our homecoming.
 No, that really is it.
 Yeah.
 My most like, what are you looking at?
 You're still in dress with your eyes, of course, been away for four days.
 Lock it up.
 Let's get this done.
 Lock it up.
 Our episode this week.
 Yes.
 It's going to be an interesting episode.
 Yes.
 Because it's picking up from an episode we did, I don't know, like four months ago, five months ago, back in May.
 We did an episode.
 It was episode 238 called 50% vaccinated.
 Yes.
 And in that episode, I talk about my decision to get vaccinated against COVID.
 And the decisions that leading up to that, all against the backdrop of us being a family that have not been pro vaccination family.
 Yes.
 And we tell a story about, you know, we actually had to hire a vaccination attorney
 to help us get out of a requirement for becoming U.S. citizens.
 And so, you know, why Alan, did you make this decision?
 And here we are in, what are we?
 September or September.
 By the time this episode is released, you will now be fully vaccinated,
 along with two of our children.
 And I thought, I don't know what I do know you want to talk about it.
 because I asked you, "Hey, do you want to talk about that
 in the podcast?"
 But I thought, what a great follow-up episode to that.
 Like a lot has changed in the four or five months.
 Math doesn't allow me to add that up that quickly.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And I thought it would be fun for our audience
 to listen to your process of how you came from,
 I absolutely don't want to get vaccinated.
 I don't want the kids to be vaccinated.
 Insert clip.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>But I'm back to my choice of, do I live in fear?
 Or do I take everything to God and say, I feel fear.
  </li><li>What do you say? - Can you talk to me about this?
 So again, I don't wanna get the vaccine.
 And I'm not saying I'm never going to get it.
 I'm saying at this point, where I am,
 that's not my desire.
 If at some point the Lord talks to me about it or whatever,
 that's a different conversation.
  </li><li>To where you are now.
 So where do you wanna begin in that particular story?
 I think it's tricky because it sort of came in bits and pieces like in terms of when you got vaccinated in May, you asked me, would you pray about you getting vaccinated and the girls getting vaccinated?
 So, I mean, and you didn't bring it back up after that. You just were like, did I ask you then? I thought I didn't ask you until the kids started going back to school.
 I don't think it was around the time I got vaccinated.
 It was around that time that you said,
 "Would I pray about it?"
 And then you checked back in near the end of July,
 how are you feeling about,
 have you been praying about it, whatever?
 And I've been processing a bunch of things--
  </li><li>Well, back up, what I said,
 would you pray about it?
 What was your first thought?
  </li><li>I thought was I'm always gonna pray about things.
 Of course I'll pray about it.
 I didn't honestly think that I would arrive
 at any level of peace in getting it.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But I'm never gonna not pray about something
 that you've asked me to pray about.
  </li><li>Well, the only thing I'm thinking there is,
 you were so resolute about it.
 This is probably a bad example.
 But if I was to say, "Hey babe,
 would you pray about us getting divorced?"
 Like you would not pray about that.
  </li><li>That is a bad example.
 That's--
  </li><li>No, but I mean your resolution to not being vaccinated
 was like a core value.
 So I didn't, I mean, yes, one is sin the other, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It was such a--
  </li><li>I was like, "Wow."
 It's late at night.
 I'm not going to come up with my examples.
 But anyway, you prayed about it.
 Yes, I started praying about it.
 And I tend to take a long time to process stuff with the Lord anyway.
 And in the midst of all of, in the midst of praying about it,
 ended up finding out about the tumor, having the tumor removed, all that kind of stuff.
 Oh my God.
 And there was just a whole bunch of things where I felt like the Lord was really
 nicely sort of talking to me about, you know, because they had said this tumor, probably
 not cancerous, you know, whatever. But you know, we can, we can take care of it, we can
 get it out and then you don't, you don't have any sort of pain or discomfort or whatever.
 And so even that process was part of it for me because I was like, I was happy to let
 the medical community help me with something that it wasn't cancerous. Nobody could actually
 see it, but they could take care of it. They could get rid of it. I didn't check with them
 what the side effects were going to be of any of the good heavens enormous amount of things
 that they gave me to put me under. You know, like you, you're, they're telling you all that
 stuff and signing, but at that moment, you're just like, I have a grapefruit growing in me,
 and they're going to get it out. And the medical community can help me with this.
 And it's a safe thing.
 Like it's as safe as it can be to have somebody cut you five times.
 Except they make you sound a waiver saying you could die.
 Yeah, you could die.
 And you know, but I was like, yes, Lord, and realizing I'm trusting the Lord in the midst of all of it.
 Like I'm like, yes, you getting surgery is not you not trusting God.
 Right. I'm just like, okay, Lord, this is, this is, this seems to be the best way to deal with it.
 I feel peace about it.
 Okay, God, I'm trusting you to like guide the surgeons and that I won't have side effects and that it will all turn out
 Okay, and as I was processing during recovery because of course I spent, you know, several weeks in bed
 I thought it's interesting like just as I'm processing I had really I had so much fear about the vaccine
 Again because traditionally we're non
 vaccine people but I had a lot of fear about the vaccine and
 I had fear also about the surgery before, but I was like, actually, Lord, I trust you.
 And I'm not actually going to give into fear. And why aren't I willing to say like,
 because I realized I was like, well, I'll trust the Lord that I won't get COVID again.
 Right. And I could trust the Lord that the kids won't get COVID. Or if we get it that we're going
 to be fine. Why can't I give the same amount of trust to the Lord that if we got the vaccine that
 nothing bad is going to happen? And I realized I wasn't willing to do that.
 Interesting. I was willing to trust with a whole bunch of things I couldn't control over here.
 And but not with the vaccine. And but even though when I look back, I'm like, Oh, I was happy for
 the medical community. Help me with this tumor. But when the medical community says we have a vaccine,
 I'm like, I don't know, suspicious, you know, so interesting. Yeah. So I realized, Oh, like,
 This is it is interesting.
 And I thought I, I don't have, I didn't have a problem with other people getting the vaccine,
 to be clear.
 I didn't have a problem with you getting it.
 I just thought for me, I don't want to get it.
 You did have a problem, but then you're afraid about it.
 I prayed about it and then I was fine.
 But I mean, like I have plenty of friends who have gotten the vaccine and I have plenty
 of friends who haven't gotten the vaccine and that's their business.
 like, you know, that's their walk with the Lord and and where
 they're at. And I'm fine with that. I don't, you know, like in my
 head, I'm like, I don't get to have an opinion about that. That's
 your life. But anyway, as I was processing, I was like, Oh, if
 I take the fear out of it, if I'm trusting the Lord, regardless,
 what would I normally do? I would go and start asking questions
 because I actually don't feel like I have enough information to
 really make this decision. And so the first person I talked to
 was a doctor that goes to our church. And she was super
 helpful. I asked her about like a whole bunch of things like,
 Hey, it's supposed to affect your fertility because we're
 talking about getting the girls vaccinated. How real is that?
 And and she's a OBGYN. Like she's this is her deal. And she
 said no, that's that's actually been debunked. But she
 explained it in doctor speak, which I'll be honest went like
 You smiled and nodded over my head.
 I was like, I love you that you think I understand anything that you just said,
 but she like just earnestly explained it all beautifully to me.
 And then I had to say slow down, could you say that like in
 because let me pause for a second.
 Just not only did you get the vaccine, but we also got our two dollars, 14 and 12
 vaccinated. Yes.
 And a lot of your initial concerns were, what if this messes up with our
 reproductive later reproductive life.
 And that was one of the things on the internet, you know, if you just,
 many. If you just follow Facebook and you don't follow the trail to the information and stuff. So
 I read a whole bunch of articles on it. First of all, I read some medical journals and where did
 that come from in this report in Germany? And this is why that's not true and all this kind of stuff.
 And then talk to my friend and she was like, no, AJ, that's not how it works. And so she explained
 it. And it was so similar to one of these reports that I had read. I was like, okay, yeah, I understand
 what you're saying now. Okay, so that's not a thing. And then she was explaining like, this is while
 the COVID part of this vaccine is really recent, you know, because it's adapting the technology of
 this vaccine to COVID, that piece is new. The technology like the carrier of an mRNA vaccine is
 actually more than 10 years old. And and so she's like, it's not really a new vaccine. So I'm like,
 like, okay, that's interesting.
 Anyway, so I, but again, this particular friend,
 she would be a pro vaccine person.
  </li><li>Anyway. - Anyway.
 And, but I mean, but she was super helpful.
 And I was like, okay, that gives me stuff to pray about.
 And I, she recommended some things I could read
 and I went and read some things.
 And I was like, okay, great.
 And then we went and saw Sam, who is our doctor.
 And if I back up for just a second,
 when I saw Danny, who's my other doctor,
 who does like all the, has helped me with all the hormone stuff and the vitamin stuff and whatever.
 When I saw her in January, she had said, A.J., I think it's important everybody gets the vaccine,
 which to me was shocking because traditionally she, she's been no vaccine.
 Like these, you know, her and Sam, we've been, I've been seeing them for 10 years and they've been, we don't vaccinate.
 Right.
 So and the reason we go to our doctor's office that we go to is because they don't pressure us to
 vaccinate our kids. Right. We had we we were absolutely. Yes, we were asked to leave our other
 pediatrician because of our stance on vaccinations. And so we looked around for a primary care physician,
 and we found our primary care physicians who of course would administer vaccines, you know,
 their medical doctors, of course they would do that.
 But they were also entirely happy for us to not and talk through our
 concerns, right?
 Didn't put pressure on us.
 Right.
 So so this, you know, going into the office, chatting with her.
 And I knew you had had a chat with her about getting the vaccine before you
 had gotten it.
 And so we had all this extra time because we'd done our five, whatever
 well people check up things.
 And I just said, Hey, Sam, can I have like 15 or 20 minutes to ask you some
 questions?
 And so you took the kids out into the waiting room and I just asked her all
 the questions that I had, like, can you talk to me about shedding?
 And she explained why that's not a thing.
 And, you know, can you talk to me about, uh, I asked her about the fertility stuff
 as well.
 And she said the exact same thing as Kelina, though more at my level, like
 she sort of explained it.
 She didn't quite use like flashcards and blocks, but it was a, like a lot easier.
 I was like, yes, got it.
 Whiteboard, 15 J.
 Yeah.
 And so-- and then she was talking about just different statistics.
 And she was saying like, you know, AJ, people
 are trying to get a death rate on--
 you can't get a death rate during a pandemic.
 She said, you have to wait till the pandemic is over
 and then establish the death rate based
 on the total amount of people that died,
 because it's based on the population.
 Right.
 She really helped me.
 She went through a bunch of different statistics
 and just like raw data that they see, that the doctors see.
 And she checks it three times a week and whatever.
 We talked about part of why we go to this office
 is because we got booted out of another pediatrician's office.
 But she's been taking care of us for 10 years.
 And she's not been somebody who's ever encouraged vaccination.
  </li><li>For us, for our family.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's been very, very gracious.
 But when I was sitting there talking to her again, she was like, AJ, I, I, I think it's important that you get the vaccine.
 I think it's important the girls get the vaccine.
 I think the risk of the vaccine is so much lower than the risk of Delta.
 And what she was saying is a physician, like all she's dealing with is follow up from long COVID.
 Right.
 So she was saying it's not even the death rate, AJ.
 It's all the long COVID stuff.
 So she was just like, you know, she said with any vaccine, you're, you're
 rating the, the risk of the vaccine against the risk of getting whatever
 the thing is, and the risk of contributing to spreading it in your community.
 And, uh, and she's just like the, the risk just don't add up to not do it.
 And that was a big statement coming from her.
 It was huge.
 Like you walked out of the clinic, but she got super passionate about it.
 Like she got, like she was crying while she was talking to me, which I have
 never in 10 years.
 I mean, she's so laid back and just fun and whatever.
 And she got super passionate about it.
 And she's like, you know, people are just not taking this
 seriously.
 And she said, and this needs to be taken seriously.
 And I mean, she was heartbroken with the amount of,
 you know, what she sees.
 What she sees and patients they've lost and friends
 that she went to medical school that are now dead
 because of COVID.
 And I was like, okay.
 And I thought, I'm still not gonna make a decision
 based on the fear of that, you know, I'm not going to go, I don't want to swing either
 way for against based on fear, but I'm going to just pray and ask the Lord for peace.
 And so then I was, I was sort of had given myself a deadline of like, I'd like to know
 where I am in the next week or two, you know, as I'm sort of processing that. And I'm also
 thinking about external things like my mother's in Canada, and I can't get across the border
 or if anything were to ever happen
 because you have to be vaccinated
 to get across a border or pay two grand,
 like things like that.
 But in the midst of praying about again,
 all of this and considering the ramifications
 of all of the different things coming together,
 I'm also reading or listening rather to Nehemiah,
 I'm in the Bible app.
 And it's talking about Nehemiah rebuilding the wall.
 And we always call it Nehemiah as wall, but actually--
 We call it NEMI as wall, I think, is a crank pronunciation.
 Well, we call it NEMI.
 So we always think it's kind of one guy building the wall.
 I mean, not really, but it's--
 but there's this part where it talks about, OK,
 so these are not the names.
 But Bob rebuilt the wall from Bob's house to Frank's house.
 And then Frank rebuilt the wall from Frank's house
 to Tom's house.
 And Tom rebuilt the wall.
 And so there's this--
 It's a good Jewish name.
 Right.
 Oh, really good news, but they're all like everybody took responsibility for the protection in the building of the wall of their section, even though it was called Nehemiah's wall.
 And so I was like, it just made it did make me think about
 vaccinating. Like I was like, oh, actually, if I get vaccinated and I can't infect somebody else, I actually protect MJ, I protect people that come in contact
 with me and I certainly have enough faith to say,
 Lord, I trust you that I'm gonna get this vaccine
 and I'm gonna be fine.
 So anyway, I just arrived at, oh yeah, I'm gonna get it.
 And when I made that decision, I just instantly just had peace.
 So I was like, okay, I'm good.
  </li><li>And I really wasn't in the loop on any of that.
 I don't even remember asking you when I got,
 that's not how I remember it at all.
 I'm not saying you're wrong.
 My memory about things I don't care about
 is remarkably bad.
  </li><li>And I would be in the category of things
 you don't care about?
  </li><li>No, but like a topic like that is not something I--
  </li><li>You're right, okay, yeah.
  </li><li>Do you know what I mean?
 I'm very, very detail oriented about stuff I care about,
 but I don't remember.
  </li><li>But I didn't process with you because I--
  </li><li>Not at all.
  </li><li>Didn't want your influence.
 I didn't want, I just wanted to know from the Lord
 what I was hearing.
  </li><li>See, but all I remember was watching this looming deadline
 of our kids going back to school and watching no,
 in my opinion, reasonable care for our children
 in the state of Tennessee for their return to school.
  </li><li>Right, and the Tennessee numbers are crazy.
  </li><li>A stark contrast to last year.
 So there's no option to do remote learning
 that COVID policies for Williamson County Schools
 is really, really terrible.
 I mean, it's handed down.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>You know, children are not required to wear masks.
  </li><li>Right.
 I'm like, okay, is there a responsible parenting for me
 to send my children into that environment?
 And so that was a looming deadline for me
 where I am now as one side of our parents,
 I want to get our children vaccinated.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I don't even know where you are.
 So all I remember is saying,
 hey babe, with the school coming up,
 would you pray about the kids getting vaccinated?
 And I remember asking you to get vaccinated too,
 because NJ camp in America,
 we can't get the COVID vaccine from the 20.
  </li><li>I don't think if it's available anywhere
 for under 12 at the moment, is it?
 there are some countries that are vaccinating.
 Yep, there are, but we can't.
 So I'm like, okay, MJT and Abby are all going
 in the school system with parents and children
 who are making choices that we're not.
 What can I do as a responsible parent to protect them?
 And this is one opportunity.
 And that's really all I remember making my ask of you.
 And I remember coming home from speaking to Sam
 because I spoke to Sam and she'd asked me,
 which I thought was out of character,
 I said I was fully vaccinated.
 you aren't, she said, "Please make sure the kids get vaccinated."
 And I said, "Well, we're coming in for a family checkup."
 So, and I came home and said, "Hey, look babe,
 don't want to put pressure on you.
 I spoke to Sam who was a fairly sobering conversation.
 I know you trust her, would you speak to her?"
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And you said, "Yeah."
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I didn't realize for months you'd been pondering this.
  </li><li>Well, yeah, because you'd gone and done it.
 And, you know, which was fine.
 I mean, I had agreed, go ahead.
 But once you'd made that decision, you felt peace.
 Yeah, and I went and got it a few days later, signed up,
 went and got the vaccine.
 And the kids as well, the girls.
 Yes.
 So the very first vaccine T has ever received
 in our entire life as a COVID-19 vaccine.
 Yeah.
 And the funny thing was, we were talking about how,
 when you were in the hospital in February,
 whenever that was, and when I had the surgery,
 in those moments when you're in agony,
 and they're like, hey, I'm just gonna inject this in you,
 and it's gonna help with whatever.
 You're like, yeah, do whatever.
 I don't care, just get me out of pain.
 And even with Tia, like crushing her finger, you know,
 was it they were like, has she had tetanus?
 We were like, no, she hasn't had any vaccines.
 I mean, she's just had her, you know,
 at that point she had one COVID, you know, shot or whatever.
 And they were like, uh, she couldn't eat tetanus
 'cause it was like a steel hinge and the, you know,
  </li><li>It was bone-fungmented, it was an open one.
  </li><li>And we're like, yeah, okay, you know, like,
 so again, it's, you know, I don't feel like I'm not trusting
 the Lord by listening to a medical person.
 Right.
 And any more than I think it's not trusting the Lord if you need medication for depression
 or, you know, some other kind of health thing.
 Like, you know, I don't think that those things are at odds.
 I don't, I don't believe that, that wisdom and faith are at war.
 Right.
 Well, it goes back to you were mentioning Nehemiah or Nehemiah as the Canadians pronounce them.
 And I was, you know, we were reading the same passage together, went through the Bible together.
 And the thing that struck me was when opposition comes and then Nehemiah arms all the builders
 and staggers, those who are building with those who are protecting.
 Yeah.
 And I thought, oh, that's so interesting that he's received a command from the Lord to build
 the wall.
 Yeah.
 Opposition has come.
 And he doesn't just say, well, if God wants it done, he'll take care of it.
 He took steps to be responsible and actually arm the men.
 And some people could say, oh my gosh,
 don't you have faith in God to protect you?
  </li><li>Well, yeah, why'd you fight back?
  </li><li>But the very fact that he trusted God to protect him
 was to equip himself with what was available.
 And so, oh my gosh, you don't trust God
 to protect you from COVID?
 No, I do, which is why I'm getting a vaccine
 that God gave scientists brilliant minds
 to develop this as a way of protecting us.
 And so this notion that to do one means you don't have faith,
 I think that's nonsense biblically and, you know, born out in our life.
 Yeah.
 I think the thing that still makes me sad is which has nothing to do with vaccines.
 It has more to do with the last year and a half is that in the midst of whether you're
 masked, no-mask vaccine, no vaccine is I feel like the body of Christ has forgotten to be
 kind.
 Wow.
 Like one of the things that the Lord was just really hammering home to me the last couple
 of weeks is when it comes to the judgment, like when you get up here, we're not going
 to be talking about COVID.
 We aren't going to be talking about government.
 We're going to be just talking about, did you love well?
 Were you kind?
 You know, and I just, I think my heart feels so sad because it feels like right now, perhaps
 because we're all spending too much time at home.
 We're all under a lot of stress.
 We're all done with COVID.
 We have fatigue, blah, blah, but it feels like everything has become a polarizing issue.
 And we've forgotten to be able to love somebody who doesn't think the same as ourselves.
 And that makes me sad.
 Going back to you getting the shot, what happened to you?
 What were your side effects?
 What were the girls side effects?
 How did it go down?
 The girls didn't have any side effects.
 Really, they just were like, my arm was sore for a day and that was it.
  </li><li>So you had a headache for like two days on our second shot?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Not two days, sorry, two hours.
  </li><li>I was gonna have to, I was like two days?
 I don't remember that.
  </li><li>Nope, two hours.
  </li><li>I don't remember that.
  </li><li>She was not told me.
  </li><li>I spiked a fever with both, but I mean,
 I had gotten tested and I still had antibodies.
 And I told our doctor, like I still have antibodies.
 And she said, I think you can still go ahead.
 And I was like, okay, the first one for 24 hours,
 out of fever of 102, just it like sort of instantly like, oh,
 it came on and it left almost within 24.
 I think exactly.
 Yeah.
 And I literally went from I'm totally okay to it was the day we were at the
 hospital with Tia's finger.
 We got home and all of a sudden I went, gosh, I don't feel okay.
 And I had gotten the vaccine the day before.
 I spiked to fever of 102 exactly 24 hours.
 It was gone and then I was fine.
 And then same thing with the second shot only.
 It was only for about 10.
 Well, no, it was longer than that.
 12 hours.
 You go up and you want feeling good?
 I got up at six and it was gone by about eight.
 Yeah.
 So it was like 14 hours.
 And that was it.
 But it did get up to 103.5 at one point, which was really hot.
 But that was only for like half an hour.
 And then, you know, went back down.
 And--
 So now you feel good?
 So that was it.
 Ready to flex your fully vaccinated status?
 I mean, I don't know how you flexed.
 I'm still wearing a mask when I'm in, you know, inside
 in whatever I'm just like.
  </li><li>It was really sweet going to the movie theater with Abby
 because she was of course fully vaccinated.
 I was fully vaccinated.
 And I also did my due diligence.
 I looked at the load of the,
 how many people were in the room?
 Massive room, 20 people.
 You know, everyone was wearing masks.
 We were wearing masks throughout the whole thing,
 watching it.
 But it was just sweet to have that level of,
 okay, we're gonna go out and we're gonna do this.
 And wow.
 So now looking back on A.J. Jones,
 like what's happened to your head
 when you think about your kids are now vaccinated,
 you're vaccinated based on where you were in May.
 Like how do you, how do you feel?
  </li><li>I feel fine.
 I mean, hopefully I'm always teachable.
 You know, like I don't ever wanna be so stuck
 in my own opinion that I can't even hear the Lord about it.
  </li><li>What did the Lord say?
 I didn't hear that part when you prayed.
 What did the Lord say?
 I felt like the Lord just started pointing out things to me.
 So that's what I mean, like, you know, the stuff with Nehemiah
 and then the Lord was talking to me about, well, you were really
 okay for them to give you whatever during the surgery.
 And you were believing me to protect you.
 Why aren't you believing me to protect you if you got the vaccine?
 Not even like when you get it, but if you got it, well, I mean,
 what's the difference in your mind?
 You know, so it was more like I felt like I was debating with the Lord a little bit,
 like nicely, just him helping me discover where really it wasn't matching up.
 You know, so.
 I find it interesting that the Lord, you know, he does that.
 He just kind of points at things, you know, and I've considered this.
 And, you know, as you, as you talk with him about those things, he's,
 he's a genius like that, leading us to maybe where we need to get to without
 dragging us there.
 Yeah.
 You know, I was talking to somebody at church,
 and when I was in the process of, you know,
 making the decision and just was sharing with this friend
 that I'm, you know, in this process of trying to make
 this decision and she was saying, you know, so am I.
 And I think my best advice was, you know,
 do the research as best you can.
 I'm not a medical person, so there's a lot
 I don't understand, you know.
 And it's not what I'm trained to do.
 That was the other thing, actually,
 that the Lord said to me.
 He's like, before I talk to Sam or Kaelin or anything,
 and he's like, why are you trying to figure this out
 on your own?
 You don't go to Sam or Kaelin and ask them
 to help you figure out the parables in the Bible
 or explain Genesis to you,
 but you would go to them for medical help.
 And it seems like you're not actually going
 to a legit source to help you make the decision
 that you need to make.
  </li><li>'Cause you're trying to figure out
 how on your own you mean?
 on my own and then based on like reading things on the internet.
 But again, there's, you can find anything to support your view.
 It feels, it feels like there's so much fear, uncertainty and doubt.
 And it, you know, it just feels like such a big mess.
 And so I was trying to make sure like that I'm reading peer reviewed things and,
 you know, all that kind of stuff and not like Bob's article, you know, that kind of
 thing.
 But at the same time, I was like, you know, I don't even know that I comprehend all of what I'm reading, you know, to be honest.
 And so that was a part of it for me too, was like, the Lord was sort of like, hey, can I challenge you that actually usually you go to an expert to help you make those kind of decisions.
 You see an accountant to talk about your finances.
 Right.
 You see a chiropractor about your bad back.
 Right.
 Right.
 Right.
 So I was like, right.
 Okay.
 Right.
 You know.
 And I, I still even when I started having those conversations didn't think I would
 end up in a different place than I was.
 I just thought, I'll do my due diligence and, you know, um, but yeah, just.
 Well, one, one of the things that was a consistent point of feedback from the last
 episode that we did, you know, when I talked about my choice is 50% vaccinated.
 I got a lot of feedback, which was so tender from people who basically, the
 story went with, I was so done with COVID.
 I didn't want to hear another person's opinion.
 So I nearly didn't listen to your episode or I saw the title and just thought, no,
 I don't want to listen to your, you talk about why you got about, you know,
 I just don't want to listen to it.
 But the whole expert had me listen to it.
 And I was really touched, you know, even if they disagreed with the outcome,
 they said, we were really touched with the way you made your decisions.
 Like as a married couple, yeah, really touched by, you know,
 your devotion to each other, devotion to the Lord.
 And I just want to make a comment on, you know, your whole decision making
 process. You know, you've talked a little bit about the space that you got from me.
 I didn't know you were going through all this stuff, space to be with the Holy Spirit.
 How did you feel about my initial question?
 I know you were very blasey earlier about like, no, I was fine.
 I was shocked by that response.
 I didn't think you'd be fine for me to ask you about that.
 To ask me about.
 Hey, we pray about doing something I know you don't want to do.
 Like if it wasn't about vaccines and it was something else, hey, would you pray about?
 Could we go and buy or whatever?
 I mean, we do that all the time.
 So it didn't spin me to be asked to pray about it.
 I didn't think I'd end up where I ended up,
 but I was happy to pray about it.
  </li><li>You didn't, what made you so confident
 you wouldn't end up where you ended up?
  </li><li>I don't know.
 I mean, just sort of like, I felt,
 I think because we made a vaccine decision 10 years ago,
 you know, or 12 years ago or whatever.
 I was sort of like, I can't imagine
 that that's gonna change for me,
 but I'm happy to pray about it, you know?
 But again, I think you wanted to stay--
  </li><li>A lot of stuff has happened in our life.
  </li><li>Teachable.
  </li><li>We're gonna be prayed about it.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>I mean, a lot of stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So, yeah, I don't know.
  </li><li>Thanks for sharing your story.
 I love to hear it 'cause I didn't,
 I think when you just casually one day just said,
 "Yeah, I've scheduled the girls to get a vaccine
 and I'm gonna get vaccinated the week after.
 I was just like, say, say nothing,
 don't ruin anything, just go, oh, okay.
 I think I just tried to remain super calm
 and not be like, tell me everything about it.
 And you know, what about that?
  </li><li>How did you get there?
  </li><li>Like, don't talk around with it.
 Let's just, you know, just leave it.
 And so, you know, once I knew you'd done one,
 I knew you would do the other
 'cause I know you don't have to be a quitter.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then I really want you to talk about it
 on the podcast, but I wasn't sure how vulnerable you want
 to be or whether you want us to talk about it
 or what you don't know.
  </li><li>Well, I'm not ashamed that I got, you know,
 vaccinated and it wasn't from that to even have changed my
 perspective on this vaccine. I'm not planning on getting the
 kids all the other vaccines. I'm not this is a pandemic. Let
 me let me just play one audio clip. Just okay. I'm not even
 considering getting the vaccine. Yeah. I don't want our kids to
 get a vaccine. So you were adamant that who knows maybe in a
 couple of years will all be fully vaccinated for everything
 under the same. That's the scariest thing I've ever heard.
 Anyway, yeah.
 I love that you shared that story.
 I don't know if I cut myself off earlier, but I was saying, I was talking with a friend
 and going through the process.
 I just said, in the end, I think it's about you and the Holy Spirit having a conversation,
 making a decision when you have all the information.
 And then it can't be about what anybody else thinks about it.
 And this particular person was married, so I was like,
 you guys need to pray and figure out,
 maybe you're both gonna make the same decision,
 maybe you're not, but you both need to know
 what you're each wanting to do and have some peace.
 And then just head on with your lives,
 'cause it's not worth the stuff.
  </li><li>There you go, pray, have some peace,
 head on with your lives.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I forgot to pull out some listening questions
 for this week.
  </li><li>Okay.
