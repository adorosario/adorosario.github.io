<p> I'll in an age is podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Jones is welcome to episode one eighty four of keeping up with the Jones is where this week we're talking about speaking in tongues.
 You love a shandy she'll have a shandy will have a shandy should have been a.
 fake tongues. Before we get into the topic of tongues, we had a fascinating week.
 We did. We had a great week. We had a wonderful, wonderful week. It started out with two of our
 friends in town, one of whom who lives in towns that wasn't surprised. He was in town.
 He should be in town. Yes. But he was in our part of the town. He was.
 Mr. Lyle Phillips was in first year. If you are listening to this podcast, there's probably a
 good chance to know who Heidi Baker is. And if you know who Heidi Baker is, you know it's a big
 deal to hear her say that Lyle Phillips is her hero. And so if you haven't met Lyle,
 if you haven't heard his story, if you go to episodes 37 and episodes 38 of this podcast,
 you can hear an interview with Lyle where he tells the story of being a drug dealing youth
 all the way to somebody who rescues children from sex slavery. And he's a brilliant storyteller,
 brilliant person. He was with our first year students speaking on missions.
 Yes, and a heart permission.<br/>
 So it was amazing.<br/>
 I had to go, you know, working on a whole bunch of stuff, but every time I was in there,
 you know, you're in there for about five minutes, then you start crying.
 So of course I'd just run out, you know, because I have to be able to see you get the rest of
 my work done.<br/>
 So you know, so avoid.<br/>
 I'll have to listen to the recording later.
 And then in second year, we had Mark DuPont, who, if you've heard my testimony, he's the
 person who called me out back in '92 and said that God had planned for my life.
 Well, yeah, he opened with your dad's dad and he's not coming back, which is my favorite
 prophetic word ever.<br/>
 Yes, and it is funny because I've talked to him about it and I've never heard him start
 or ever prophesy like that, you know, since then in terms of that sort of a shocking remark.
 But if you, before you start using that as your model for prophecy, go ahead and listen
 into my testimony about when he did that. We'll try and put that in the show notes.
 What would, uh,<br/>
 does he talk about that when he was in the show?
 You know what he might have. Yeah. He might have. So yeah, Mark was on the show for
 episode 46, wasn't he? Yeah. Go. If you haven't, if you haven't listened to some of
 the earlier episodes, I mean, our interview with Mark was amazing. He's a great prophet,
 a wonderful man of God with a tremendous history with the Lord.
 Yeah. An incredible longevity in the kingdom in terms of, you know,
 Ministry and integrity and all that kind of stuff.
 So awesome individual to listen to.<br/>
 And then the rest of the week was pretty normal meetings,
 hanging out with their staff, et cetera, et cetera.
 So we had Valentine's Day, babe.<br/>
 Tell everybody what we got each other from Valentine's Day.
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 What is happening to me?<br/>
 We bought the Zelda expanded downloadable content thing for
 for each other instead of doing chocolates, which is probably a good decision.
 Health wise.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So doing flowers, hard chocolate.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 bought each other some big expansion pack to suck more of her life into.
 And so it is, isn't it, Darlene? I haven't started playing it, but oh, it's amazing.
 You're epically involved in the DLC. So there you go.
 Yeah. And then, coincidentally enough, for our wedding anniversary, which was in January,
 I pre-ordered the Zelda Expanded Edition Hardback Guide, and it arrived on Valentine's Day.
 It did. So we got the downloadable content with the book that helps us conquer all things.
 Who says romance is dead?<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 Well, you know, it's really funny because I'm going out this evening with some friends
 and you're going to have to play Zelda without me by your side, which you don't like.
 You like me there.<br/>
 Well, I've dated the podcast first.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Maybe I'll tell you a time I've done, you'll be home and then you can help me with Zelda.
 Well, then it will be my turn to play.
 That's how this thing works.<br/>
 This, ladies and gentlemen, is the current problem in our marriage.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Somebody said you need two switches.<br/>
 I'm like, then we'd never see each other.
 So he helps me in my conquering of high rule and then I help him in his.
 You've got to you understand maps.<br/>
 I don't I mean, I understand the gist of maps, but you have a photographic memory.
 So you can look at something and remember everywhere it is.
 Yes. Whereas I'm like, I'm just going to look this up on YouTube.
 Help me.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 And then Friday night I had a daddy daughter dance with my two little girls.
 You did and they were so cute.<br/>
 So on Thursday I took them out to get dresses and both of them really wanted heels.
 And you know, Abby is nearly 11 and she's just like, mommy,
 everybody else has wedges.<br/>
 Can I get wedges?<br/>
 And, and I'm like thinking, oh, you're going to roll your ankle.
 It's not comfortable.<br/>
 You don't even realize it's not comfortable, but your little heart really wants wedges.
 So we got them sweet little wedge.<br/>
 Forgive my ignorance.<br/>
 There's a huge difference between high heels and wedges.
 Yes, because yes, they're not high heels.
 Not even remotely.<br/>
 Children and high heels, but, but Tia thinks that she has high heels.
 'cause there's like an inch of a heel on it.
</p><ul>
  <li>They both said, "Yes, one point,
 "we're gonna have to take our shoes off we can dance."
 I can barely walk, these high heels.
 (laughing)
 I was like, "You have about a half inch."
  </li><li>I tried to convince them to go for flats.
 Like I just sort of lightly tried like,
 "Hey guys, it's easy to dance in flats,"
 and whatever, and they're like, "No, we want," you know, so.
  </li><li>And then Saturday morning, you hosted,
 well you didn't really host somebody else hosted
 a baby shower at our house, and 35 women came over.
  </li><li>Yes, well, first of all, I actually had to go and do
 open up the church and all that for demo day.
  </li><li>I forgot about that.
 So you were up at like 5.36.
  </li><li>6, yeah.
 And out the door before 7, so went and got all the stuff
 for that and thankfully there's other people
 that are awesome that help put everything together.
  </li><li>We're doing a big construction project at church.
 And so this was kind of the demolition and preparation
 for some of the remodeling.
  </li><li>Yeah, which is exciting.
 And then there was a shower at our house.
 So I had to fly back home and help host a shower.
 My point was with 35 women, the estrogen level was nearing toxic levels.
 Forget the estrogen level, the noise.
 I mean, it was so loud.
 I was over by the kitchen saying pretending to wash things and just trying to breathe because
 I was like, "It's so loud."
 But anyway, yes.
 I took the kids out and proceeded to have a series of parenting fail moments.
 You did?
 When you come home and say, "I'm not proud of my parenting choices today."
 I'm like, "Oh no."
 Well, both of us forgot to feed the children.
 Well, no, not both of us because I wasn't home.
 You didn't feed the children.
 Right, but neither did you.
 So technically both of us failed.
 But you were the parent at home.
 Baby, blame is a terrible, terrible thing to serve.
 Okay, yeah, we both failed to feed the children.
 Yeah, they were playing Zelda and I was busy tidying the house.
 I just want to mention that you failed to feed them the whole time you were in Scotland.
 Doesn't matter, they weren't here.
 You have failed to feed them.
 Okay, go ahead.
 Yeah.
 So I'm thinking it's like 10 o'clock.
 They need to eat something, but I'm also planning on taking to a movie.
 I was going to go and in fact, I did go and see Peter Rabbit, which was brilliant.
 By the way.
 And so I'm thinking, okay, I'm going to take the kids.
 I said, we're going to go for breakfast.
 And they also Chick-fil-A.
 And I was like, don't you want to go McDonald's for breakfast?
 And do you?
 It was like, please, no.
 So we drive to Chick-fil-A.
 It's pouring with rain.
 I mean, torrential rain.
 Get to Chick-fil-A, we're in the line up.
 It's taken forever.
 Either like 10 minutes to get around the building in the lineup and no kidding.
 Just like in a Hollywood movie, we pull up to the, the little voice box where you
 make your order.
 And just as I get there, the manager comes out and rotates the breakfast
 menu to lunch menu.
 And I was like, are you, are you serious right now?
 He's like, sorry, no, I'm serving breakfast.
 So they switched it like 10 30 or something?
 10 30.
 I thought it was 11.
 And I got there about 10, 20, but by the time I slowly approached it, it was 10, 13.
 I said, "You can see if there's any food left in the chutes," which there wasn't.
 So now the kids are like, "They're hungry. I'm hungry. Where is the bowl?"
 I still have to wait in the drive-through line to exit the drive-through line, even though I haven't ordered any food.
 Why didn't you order lunch stuff then?
 It's pretty much the same food.
 Because I was thinking breakfast, breakfast, breakfast.
 What does that mean?
 I just mean I'm like single focused.
 OK.
 Camera breakfast, camera dab.
 Because the movie theater definitely had breakfast.
  </li><li>Let's go ahead.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>So then we went to the movies.
 And the only movie theater that was actually showing
 a movie at time that would work for us
 was up in Nashville, not here in Franklin.
 So drive up 65 again, torrential rain
 can barely see anything.
 And people don't drive with their lights on.
 I'm like, guys, it's the law.
  </li><li>That's illegal, yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, you know, I leaned out my window
 and yelled at a bunch of people
 but they couldn't hear me because of the rain.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So get to the movie theater
 and I'm getting all the kids out
 which was an ordeal because it was pouring the rain
 and you know, I'm trying to coordinate them,
 out, you know, Jack is on the run as the movie theater, get in, and I'm looking at like,
 what am I going to feed my kids? It's now like 11 a.m. Right. None of us have eaten.
 We're just starving. We're crotchety. We're irritable. Right. And I'm looking at
 for disaster. I'm looking at what's available, you know, like kind of menu option wise. And
 the best I can do is nachos. So melted cheese and corn chips.
 Except that's there's no way that's cheese.
 It's like orange plasticy stuff.
 Let's not think about it.
 And corn dogs.
 Corn dogs.
 And then the kids like pounced on me because I was like a deer in headlights.
 I don't know what I was doing.
 So they're like, can we have popcorn?
 I'm like, yes, can we have a large bucket of popcorn?
 And they're like, can we have a slushie?
 And I'm like, that's a great idea.
 We'll give them a slushie.
 So I said, yeah, can I have a Coke?
 That is not a great idea.
 That is a horrible idea.
 Granted, in the cold, sober light of reality,
 You are not going to the movies unsupervised again.
 I swear it was just like frantic, frenetic, it was just panicked.
 And so then I had to work out how to get all of that stuff into the movie theater with three children.
 Anyway, we did.
 They're now high on sugar.
 I can't believe you gave them all caffeine.
 Oh, it was.
 That explains the afternoon.
 Well, what happened then was we get out of the movie theater, some like hour and a half hour and 45 minutes later,
 walk over to the car only to find the I'd left the driver side seat open. I don't know how.
 I thought I'd close the driver side door, but I hadn't. And so our door is just wide open in the
 middle of the parking lot had been for like an hour and a half hour and 45 minutes. Who knows?
 And it's been pouring with rain the whole time. So it's a puddle in the driver's seat, an absolute
 puddle. It was still wet this morning. Oh yeah, it was still wet this afternoon. So I'm like,
 we have a bigger problem. And that problem is the car door was left open, which means the interior
 lights were left open which means we have a dead battery. Right. So right enough, try
 start the car, dead battery and I'm thinking, fantastic. So then I look around the car park
 and there are some guys in a car opposite me and so I walk over, I've got jumper cable
 thankfully and I tap on the window to see if the let me, you know, can you help me start
 my car? As they roll down the window, just this huge waft of marijuana comes out and
 And I'm like, "You know what? I'll take what I get."
 And so I was like, "Hey guys,
 'cause you helped me jump my car."
 They were super helpful, very, very helpful.
 Got the car jumped, came home, was absolutely exhausted,
 and was like, "Okay, your turn to deal with the children."
 That was my Saturday morning parenting fail.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Well, it sounds epic, darling.
  </li><li>They all survived.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're fine.
  </li><li>And the car seems fine.
  </li><li>Ish?
  </li><li>Like taking a bath when you're driving.
  </li><li>Damn.
  </li><li>All right, so this week's topic then,
 just speaking in tongues.
  </li><li>It is.
 Last week we shared five things that helped us grow in our prayer life.
 I think one of the things I mentioned was speaking in tongues because it's been a huge
 part of my prayer life.
 Ironically for something that's had such a big effect on my prayer life, it was something
 that for years was this huge mystery and prior to that was a huge controversy.
 I thought that tonight we could talk about our journey into speaking in tongues.
 What do you think?
 Sure.
 Sounds good.
 Why don't you go first?
 Well, the church that I got saved in had no grid or need, apparently, for speaking in
 tongues.
 Me too.
 And really didn't think it was for today.
 So I really didn't know what it was until I started going to the Toronto Way of Proquition
 Fellowship.
 And I heard some people speaking in tongues, but I wasn't really sure what it was.
 I was sort of like, "Oh, that's weird.
 I wonder why they're babbling like that."
 Right.
 And then when I went to YWAM, there was a whole bunch of people that spoke in tongues at YWAM.
 We are just. I know. And I was like, and they all, you know, had different tongues,
 which I was like, wow, you don't even speak the same language. Like I was totally, you know,
 I was totally confused by the whole thing. And, you know, had a couple of run-ins with what I
 call pressure circles, you know, where they were always fun, where they put the person who doesn't
 speak in tongues in the middle. And then, you know, everybody surrounds them and yells and tongues
 over them and somebody's going, "Say it! Say it!" and you're just like, "Oh, it!" You know?
 Sounds like an absolute nightmare.
 And I would just shut down. I was like, "I don't know what you want me to say. I'm not going to
 make something up and stop yelling at me."
 That must be the equivalent of being pushed down on the prayer line.
 No, I think it's worse.
 Oh, really?
 Because I left all of those full of shame. I can't do this thing that everybody else can do.
 And I had a couple of different people who even say to me, "Tongues is the only evidence that you're baptized in the Holy Spirit."
 And I was like, "Are you kidding? I prophesy."
 I'd be like, "No, Tongues is it?"
 So I was like, "I was both confused and hurt."
 And it was great.
 So it was a source of wounding then?
 It was, yeah.
 And then after YWAM, of course, came back to church.
 I think it was about two years later and probably five pressure circles later.
 Where were these pressure circles happening at church?
 A couple of them were at YWAM.
 A couple of them were well-meaning people when you'd be at their house.
 You know what I mean?
 It was never on the front row at church or anything like that because that church just
 isn't like that.
 Right.
 And then I was at this women's meeting and a member of Mary Audrey was speaking on tongues
 and then she's like, "Hey, anybody who doesn't have the gift as tongues, why don't you stand up?"
 And I was like, "I really debated whether I was going to stand up because I thought I am not doing
 this again. I'm not doing the thing where people scream at me in tongues." But I thought, "Well,
 you know what, I really trust Mary Audrey." So she actually had us all come to the front and there
 was maybe 18 or 20 of us, a couple hundred women there. And she said, "You know, we're not going
 to line up people around you and whatever." She said, "I just want you to, we're going to enter back
 into worship, just spread out across the front, just connect, you know, whatever.
 So they quietly prayed over different people. And some people started speaking in tongues.
 I didn't. And then at the end, like, Mary Audrey came over and she was talking to me and she said,
 "A.J., you know, usually you're walking around singing." And I said, "Yeah." And she's like,
 "Well, the music's playing. Just sing whatever comes into your head." She's like, you know,
 if it's different syllables or different words, just sing them. And she's like,
 And if it doesn't, it's fine.
 It's going to happen, you know, whatever.
 I was like, okay.
 So she went and started praying for somebody else
 and I started singing and so I started singing in tongues.
 And so for the first couple of years
 of speaking in tongues in quotation mark,
 I actually sang in tongues.
 I didn't speak in tongues.
 I was just singing in tongues all the time.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But I think it became sort of a sore point for me.
 You know what I mean?
 Like just the whole thing of the pressure and,
 and I was always confused.
 Why does it seem like people in the same friendship group
 have the exact same tongue?
 Like there's a whole bunch of stuff I didn't get.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So it, but I mean now I like speaking in tongues,
 but again, I don't tend to speak in tongues
 from the microphone because I don't think
 that's what it's for, you know.
 So it's just when it's me and God, I speak in tongues,
 or when I'm putting the kids to bed
 because they want to speak in tongues.
  </li><li>Wow, so you started with singing and then went to speaking.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's funny that you mentioned about
 like I don't think it's for that.
 Like Paul differentiates, I think,
 in Corinthians between speaking in tongues,
 like as something as part of a public service,
 which he mandates is always interpreted
 for the benefit of everybody who's listening.
 And indeed he says in 1 Corinthians 12 verse 30,
 he asked kind of this rhetorical question
 to all speak with tongues.
 like talking about like public worship.
 And of course the answer is no.
 Like when we go to church on Sunday,
 not everybody gets up and speaks in tongues on the microphone.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But then later in 1 Corinthians 14 verse five,
 he says, "I wish you all spoke with tongues."
 So you end up with this kind of like contradiction in terms,
 like do all speak with tongues?
 I wish you all spoke with tongues.
 And I think like the 1230 is the corporate use.
 And I think the 14 verse five is the private use.
 I think Paul is saying, I wish, you know, everybody spoke in tongues for me.
 I was very similar, really, except I didn't go to YWAM and Mary Audrey didn't
 ask me to sing in tongues.
 But basically I grew up in a really conservative evangelical church where we
 did not believe that the gifts of the spirit were for today.
 So healing prophecy, speaking tongues, none of that was for today.
 So therefore I was raised to believe that anybody who was speaking in tongues was
 of the devil.
 Dun dun dun.
 Yeah.
 So that, yeah, I mean, really, I had no expectation that you could speak in tongues.
 And the people that we knew that did speak in tongues while they were crazy charismatic.
 And at best, they were just nice people who were deceived at worst.
 There were tools of Satan.
 Right.
 Okay.
 So really, I mean, literally that was the category I put speaking in tongues in.
 Then I met the Holy Spirit, Reno, really powerful.
 The Holy Spirit hit me.
 I did not go home that night speaking in tongues.
 at this incredible encounter with the Holy Spirit.
 But I, you know, if anything, what happened was my question machine got turned on.
 Right.
 And I was just like, what is the Holy Spirit?
 What is baptism in the Holy Spirit?
 What is speaking tongues?
 What is speaking tongues?
 What is praying tongues?
 Is that different from speaking tongues?
 Right.
 What is prophecy?
 What are angels?
 What are visions?
 You know, and I just started on this massive journey into understanding.
 One of the most helpful messages I ever heard was Derek Prince teaching on tongues.
 And I remember he did this teaching.
 I'm listening to an audio cassette of it, but he did this teaching.
 And he did his ministry time where he said, everyone, everyone who does not speak in tongues comes the front.
 I will pray for you in English.
 And then after that, no more English.
 And on the tape, you hear everybody just spontaneously start speaking tongues.
 I'm like, Oh, wow, I would like that.
 And you know, he was, he's very, he's not laid back, but he's certainly not.
 You know, demanding manipulative for anyway.
 And it just seemed like an ABC.
 And I remember asking the Lord, Lord, I would love to.
 I don't know how to.
 And, you know, when I teach this, I tell embarrassing stories about how I'd sit
 there with my, my jaw slack and my tongue out, just waiting for the Holy Spirit to
 start moving my tongue around.
 Cause I literally didn't know how it worked.
 But what I was encouraged by was first Corinthians 14, verse one, where we're
 told to eagerly desire spiritual gifts.
 Sounds like, all right, Lord, I really want to be able to speak in tongues.
 I didn't have pressure circles. I had some well-meaning friends trying to teach me how to speak in tongues, which is quite a funny thing.
 And all they did was share their experiences.
 Say this, Shaba. Shaba.
 All they did was tell me their experience and then try and recreate it.
 Yeah.
 Which is great, except as missing the Holy Spirit.
 And, you know, so I remember, I remember a friend.
 I said, "How did you learn to speak in tongues?"
 He said, "Well, somebody just prayed for me and told me to say the first word that came into my mind."
 I said, "What was the first word that came into your mind?"
 And he said, "It was Rhoda."
 And as soon as I said the word Rhoda, I said one word Rhoda and the rest followed.
 I was like, "That's awesome.
 Do that for me."
 So he lays hands on me and he prays and says, "All right, Helen, just say the first word that comes into your mind."
 And I was like, "Ag yokes."
 [laughter]
 I know.
 That was pretty much his reaction.
 [laughter]
 It was like, yeah, maybe it'll happen a different way.
 (laughing)
 Maybe it'll happen a different way for you.
  </li><li>But I have heard people, like literally,
 when they're praying for other people to get tongues,
 where they're like, just say this word, say Shaba,
 like they give them something to start with.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I mean, I'm not an expert on teaching people
 to speak in tongues, but it just seems strange
 to offer the word when it's gonna be
 a personal language for themselves, if that makes sense.
  </li><li>Well, honestly, I think the thing that's helpful
 for me, the big misunderstanding for me,
 Derek Prince clarified this for me was,
 I thought it was the Holy Spirit that did the talking
 through my mouth, I know that sounds ridiculous.
 That's why I just sit there like,
 you know, with my mouth open,
 and my tongue out going, "Holy Spirit, you--
  </li><li>Take over, take over my jaw.
  </li><li>Yeah, and what I didn't realize was,
 no, no, you do the talking,
 but the Holy Spirit gives you the language.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I was like, oh, you know,
 that makes, it kind of makes sense
 why people give you a starter word.
 Saying the starter word doesn't mean you're speaking in tongues,
 but it does activate something in faith.
 A bit like when we're teaching the prophetic
 and you ask them to think of the Bible card
 of the most represents the person sound behind them.
 That's not them prophesying, but it is them stepping into
 what does it feel like to get revelation?
  </li><li>Exercising faith, yeah.
  </li><li>So I remember, I don't know how I,
 I honestly don't remember, but I remember having a word.
 I don't remember what the word was.
 Let's say the word was Shabbat.
 I don't remember what it was,
 but I remember as I'd pray to the Lord,
 this one word would pop out.
 And I remember saying that word a lot,
 but he literally only had one word.
 And egg yolk.
 Egg yolk.
 It wasn't egg yolk.
 It was just a word that I would say.
 And I remember this whole time still praying,
 like, Lord, I really want to be able to speak in tongues.
 I remember one day saying to the Lord,
 Lord, I really want to be able to speak in tongues.
 And he said to me, Alan,
 that presupposes that you don't already speak in tongues.
 And I'm like, of course.
 And he says, well, if you don't already speak in tongues,
 what are you doing when you say this word, whatever the word was, Shaba?
 Right.
 And you know, the Lord wasn't being difficult.
 I think he was just trying to point to something.
 So I was like, Lord, is this that?
 And the Lord was like, yeah, but it's one word.
 Now just grow your vocabulary.
 And so what I started doing was just saying that one word.
 And I'd find that one word to turn into a phrase.
 And then sooner or later, I could just free flow in this new language.
 And I say language in inverted commas because at the time I was like, I don't know if I'm making this up.
 Now, here's a fun thing for you.
 Try and make up a free flowing language.
 Right.
 You can run out of syllables or phrases or, but because I was so left-brained and so
 insistent I wasn't deceived.
 One day I devised a test.
 Do you know what my test was?
 Well, it's your test.
 This is Alan Jones's left brain approach to being confident.
 You're speaking tongues.
 One morning I was having breakfast and I picked up the back of the cereal box and I prayed
 out loud in English.
 I just began to pray and just worship Jesus.
 And while I was doing that, I tried to read the back of the cereal box and I found out
 I couldn't.
 I found that when I started mentally reading the back of the cereal box, I interrupted
 the flow of me speaking English and praying.
 And so then what I do is I started speaking tongues, just out loud speaking tongues and
 reading the back of the cereal box and I realized, "Oh, I can do that. I can read in English and it
 doesn't interrupt the flow of the spirit and me speaking in tongues doesn't interrupt the flow of
 me reading English." And for whatever reason that settled it in my heart. Like, ta-da!
 The cereal box test, try it at home! This is me speaking in tongues. Because like everything,
 it's faith. And now, I don't know, some 20 years later, I've been speaking in tongues for years,
 And I don't doubt that it is tongues.
 I know that it is, even though my tongue sounds completely different from yours.
 Yeah.
 And sounds completely different from everybody else's.
 Yeah.
 Um, but that's how I got into it.
 So that's our journey into speaking in tongues.
 I was thinking, babe, what do you use speaking in tongues for?
 Um, well, I mean, to, to pray, to build yourself up, right?
 So, Jude 20 says, "But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying
 in the Holy Spirit."
 So, it's talking about praying in tongues actually builds your spirit man or your inner man.
 So, that's one of the things that it's really, really wonderful for.
 Paul talks about when you pray in the spirit, your mind is unfulfilled, but your spirit
 is filled.
 Right.
 So that's one of the things I do a lot when I'm driving or I'm in the shower.
 It's almost like a reflex.
 I'll just pray in tongues when you're right.
 It's like the strengthening of your spirits.
 It's an amazing thing.
 Another thing I pray in tongues for is I remember when I was learning to flow
 in word of knowledge or flow in prophecy, I would always have to pray in tongues
 before I'd get a vision.
 Oh, wow.
 So if somebody said, you know, do you have a word for me?
 Yeah.
 Oh, I had this picture of like me putting up my radio antenna.
 Right.
 when I'd speak in tongues, I wouldn't see a vision or an image before I started
 praying in tongues. Now, of course, I don't necessarily pray in tongues to do
 that, but to begin with, but I think it's first Corinthians 14 verse 13, Paul says
 that when you speak in a tongue, you should pray for an interpretation of what
 you're saying. And often when I'm stuck or I need wisdom or I'm asking for
 revelation, be that in a church service about what to do, or I remember one time
 We missed a flight and I was like, Lord, I need some vision.
 So I'm understanding what to do.
 And I just start speaking in tongues and it feels like it's like a fast track
 plug in to the spirit realm for revelation.
 Does that make sense?
 Yeah, like a speed charger.
 Do you do that?
 Um, no.
 I mean, I, I have, but that's not most, most commonly I just start talking to the
 Lord.
 I don't necessarily pray in tongues ahead of time, but yes.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Anything else you print on with for?
 Yeah, well, it's also used for intercession, isn't it?
 So Ephesians six. - No.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Ephesians six verse 18 says,
 "And pray in the Spirit on all occasions
 "with all kinds of prayers and requests.
 "With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying
 "for all the Lord's people."
 So, it's always funny.
 We used to joke around about when people would say,
 "Well, I'm going through this certain thing
 "or God seems to be refining this in me or whatever."
 Hey, I didn't ask for this or whatever.
 And I would always say, hey, do you pray in tongues
 'cause you have no idea what you're asking for.
 You know, the spirit is interceding on your behalf
 for actually what needs to happen within you
 to make you look more like Jesus.
 You don't know what you're praying for.
 You may have prayed for exactly this.
  </li><li>Right.
 But even when, I mean, like our job,
 we're often faced with things that way above our pay grade.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Situations, people asking for wisdom or insight
 and we're like, in my natural self, I have no clue.
  </li><li>Right.
 praying for them in going to intercession, I find it very helpful to just praying tongues,
 you know, about a situation or situations. It's a default thing that I just go to. So,
 you know, prayers and English prayers and tongues, scripted prayers, devotional prayers,
 random prayers, groans too deep for words, all those sort of things. Yeah. That's amazing.
 Yeah. Well, here's the thing. If you're listening to this and you speak in tongues, hopefully
 this, you know, made sense. If you're listening to this and you've never spoken in tongues,
 but you would love to speak in tongues, it would be our privilege to pray for you right
 now for a release of the gifts of tongues in your life. The one thing that prerequisites,
 the only prerequisite is that you've given your life to Jesus. And I'm imagining if
 you listen to a podcast like this, you already have. But if you haven't, giving your life
 to Jesus is the best thing you can do. And it's simple. You just believe that Jesus died
 for your sins, your sins being things you've done wrong, you recognize that Jesus is the
 Son of God that he came to save you and you respond by saying, Lord, I want you in my life.
 Would you forgive me my sins?
 And so first things first, if you can pray this with me, if you've never given your life
 to Jesus and you can just repeat this after me, Jesus Christ, I believe that you're the
 Son of God.
 I believe that you died to forgive my sins.
 "Would you come and forgive me my sins,
 "transform my life and I commit myself to following you?"
 If you've done that, if you've prayed a prayer like that
 in your life, you are what the Bible calls
 a follower of Jesus, a Christian.
 To be given the gift of tongues is just one of the many gifts
 that the Holy Spirit loves to give followers of Jesus.
 And you just need to be willing to receive it.
 Just say, Jesus, I would love to be able to speak in tongues.
 And so, Adrian, I was just gonna pray for you right now.
 Lord Jesus, we just pray for everyone who's listening
 this right now who may be able to speak in tongues, but don't know they can. Lord, I ask right now
 that by gift of your Holy Spirit, you'd activate that in them and that they would be given the gift
 of tongues and begin to speak in tongues even now as we're praying. Yeah, Lord, ask that you'd
 activate that childlike faith that just hungers for the things of you and doesn't care what it
 sounds like or looks like. Lord, that they would just be able to push in and grab ahold of this
 thing that you want to give them. It's a gift. Amen. Well, I hope that was helpful.
 As we're talking about tongues, if you have any questions about tongues,
 if you want to ask any questions about anything, if you go to <a href="mailto:ellen@ag.com">ellen@ag.com</a>/ask,
 we'd be happy to answer any of your questions. Speaking of questions, Jenny asks this.
 She said, "You spoke about your two-way journaling process this week, and I've listened to the
 the podcast that you mentioned about listening to God that you put in the show notes.
 Journaling has always been a part of my walk with God, but I'd love to hear more about
 how you use it to hear God as he writes back through you.
 Could you possibly go into a little bit more detail about that process and maybe give some
 tips for someone trying it for the first time?
 That's a great, great question.
 I will give you a little bit of a description of how it works for me, and then I'll point
 you in the direction of two great resources that would help you.
 For me, literally, in my devotional time, when I'm with the Lord, I have my laptop because
 I can type faster than I can write, and I can read my typing, I can't read my writing.
 And I will do these four keys, I quiet myself down, I just get in a place where I'm still.
 I fix my eyes on Jesus, so I'm just looking for where Jesus is in the room, I'm looking
 for visionism, I'm praying.
 And then I do this thing called tuning to spontaneity, I'm recognizing that the Holy
 spirit speaks in spontaneous ways. So I have an expectation that when I come to be with Jesus
 and when I quiet myself down and I'm just beginning to write out my prayers to the Lord. So literally
 I'll sit with my laptop and I'll be like, good morning, Father, it's just great to be with you.
 And I'm typing all this out to him. Like I just, I'm so excited about today. Thank you for an amazing
 night's sleep. I just wonder, Lord, what do you have for me today? And I'll put a question mark there
 and then I'll just close my eyes and I will look for vision. I'll just wait to see what the
 what the Holy Spirit says.
 And no sooner have I put a question mark,
 I begin to hear the Holy Spirit speak to me.
 I hear an audible stream that comes
 from the right side of my head.
 I just hear the stream of flow, of words,
 kind of like I'm talking to myself, but I'm not.
  </li><li>No, you said audible.
 You hear it like you can hear my voice right now?
  </li><li>No, it's like an internal audible.
 It's like when you talk to yourself.
 Or you rehearse a conversation in your head.
 It's as clear as that, but I'm not making up the words.
 I hear it and I just begin to write it down and I write down everything I'm saying.
 And when I've finished that, I might ask some more questions.
 Lord, thank you for telling me that.
 What do you mean by whatever you said, XYZ?
 And again, I wait and I hear something and I write it down.
 And at the end of my prayer time, I end up with this transcript of what I said, what
 I felt like the Holy Spirit said, what I said, what I felt like the Holy Spirit said.
 And then what I do is I haven't written it down.
 I read it, like, what have I written? What is the Holy Spirit? What do I think feels a bit too much
 like me, like what I want to hear? And I might pass it on to AJ or I might talk to Jeff and just say,
 "Hey, I felt like the Holy Spirit said this. What do you think?" In fact, just a couple of weeks ago,
 we went away as a senior team from our church and I felt like the Holy Spirit spoke to me about a
 bunch of stuff. And so I shared it with Jeff and Becky and AJ and said, "Hey, this is what I feel
 I feel like the Holy Spirit said,
 what do you think?
 I hold it really lightly,
 but I haven't built up a 20-plus year relationship
 with the Lord doing this.
 It's, I don't mean to say it because I've been doing it
 for 20 years, I'm accurate.
 I don't mean to say that,
 but there is a level of confidence I have
 knowing that it's the Lord.
 So that's what it looks like for my life.
 Age, I'd imagine it's much the same.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's pretty much exactly the same, yeah.
  </li><li>So there's two resources.
 There's Mark Verclers teaching.
 Mark was the person who taught us this.
 You can find that a link to that in the show notes.
 It's his ministry is called Communion with God.
 And the second resource is A.J.'s book, Finding Father.
 The first two chapters are all about,
 the first chapter is all about hearing God's voice
 and we give you some exercises.
 In fact, the whole book is just 12 weeks of exercises
 and learning to hear the voice of God.
 But the first chapter explains everything I just said
 in way more detail.
  </li><li>And that's because, well, not a lot of people know this,
 but you actually wrote the first chapter of Finding Father.
 I don't want to boast, but the first two chapters.
 Yes, it's true.
 Un-credited contribution.
 Well, you know, I give you credit at home.
 You do. You're very good.
 Yes, it's true.
 So yeah, we talk about how to do that.
 And like I said, A.G.'s book, it's just filled with journaling exercises,
 which is a great way to practice.
 The only way you get better hearing the voice of God is practicing to hear the voice of God.
 So, Jenny, I hope that helps.
 Thanks for being with us.
