<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end an AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode 234 of Keeping Up With The Joneses,
 where apparently this week it's show and tell time.
  </li><li>Apparently it is.
  </li><li>You have brought with you a selection of hats.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Pray tell what's going on?
  </li><li>I have a hat issue, I think.
  </li><li>Is this for our weekly roundup?
 'Cause earlier I was like, "Pape, we've done nothing this week."
  </li><li>But I did something, I got my hair did.
  </li><li>You did?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You look beautiful.
 And also, talk to me about the story of these hats
 because some of them arrived this week,
 but they were ordered a long time ago.
  </li><li>Well, so the black hat was my first ever hat hat.
  </li><li>Wait, I bought you one for Christmas
 and one for Valentine's Day.
  </li><li>Yes, those are the--
  </li><li>I'm on in credit, like those cares about that.
  </li><li>There you do.
  </li><li>They extol my virtues as a husband.
  </li><li>You've done so well.
  </li><li>That's all I was looking for.
  </li><li>In feeding my hat fetish.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay, talk about hats.
 So the Black Hat's my first hat that I bought for my birthday a year and a half ago.
 Put it on.
 I'm sorry.
 I should put the Black Hat on last because it's going to wreck my bangs.
 So that's a big deal for a podcast where nobody can see.
 I know.
 I know.
 But those that watch the video cast are actually going to see my bangs.
 So this is the newest one that you got me, I think, for Valentine's Day.
 I like it because it reminds me of Australia, what was like the corks hanging
 down from it to keep the flies out of the way?
 It's a real good look.
 So there's this one. I don't know if it's on right because, you know, I can't, I can't see myself.
 Well, it's on your head. Does it go anywhere else?
 Oh my gosh. So if you are not watching the video,
 hats and sarcasm, my wife has and Sarah gave me the best glare ever. That's good in the business.
 That looks really pretty. Thank you. Thank you. And then this other hat. I like to call your former Joe hat.
 No, this is not the you call me the my farmer Joe hat. This is like
 It's a straw sun hat that a farm would wear
 Your one sure where a hat this nice here one piece of grass short of looking like a country
 Oh, you're gonna get it later. I am hoping so
 Oh, not in that way, okay
 This is just to keep the sun off my face because we live in Tennessee
  </li><li>Yeah, it does a great job.
 And try the black hat.
  </li><li>The black hat, you wear it a little differently,
 so let me give you this one.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Here, you take this.
  </li><li>I wear this?
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't know where.
  </li><li>It's not gonna fit your head anyway.
  </li><li>Here's to a woman who wears many hats.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like that.
 When you say you wear that differently,
 as far as I can tell, you're still putting it on your head.
  </li><li>Well, you just wear it lower like it.
 You wear it lower on your forehead,
 or the other ones you were sort of back further on your head.
  </li><li>Guys, pray for us at this pandemic,
 and so that we can actually go out
 and talk about restaurants we ate at,
 or movies we've seen, 'cause so far--
  </li><li>And so I can wear my hats.
  </li><li>So far, weekly recap is,
 AJ's wearing her hat.
 They are really pretty hats, I like 'em.
  </li><li>And I got my hair did.
  </li><li>And you got your hair did.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But the most important thing is,
 I bought these hats for your Christmas
 and your Valentine's Day.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And then they were such a backorder they never.
 I thought we were gonna tell a story.
  </li><li>Oh, well, so the straw hat, for Christmas,
 I got too strong, I'm gonna take this off
 and fix my bangs while we're talking
 'cause women can multitask, are you ready?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So for Christmas, I got too straw hats
 and a white hat, it stopped looking at my face.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Nice, you want to become a member?
 Just so you can see the video of AJ's bangs.
  </li><li>There we go, shut up.
  </li><li>Okay, that was amazing.
  </li><li>All right, I think we're good.
 Just hit the mic.
  </li><li>Can we help with some?
  </li><li>Okay, okay.
  </li><li>Let's do this again.
  </li><li>Anyway, put that somewhere where it's not gonna reflect.
 So for Christmas, I got the two straw hats
 and a white hat.
 The white hat didn't, it was on back order,
 back order, back order, and COVID this, COVID that.
 And it arrived in February, at which point I put it on
 and thought, I cannot wear this hat, it looks awful on me.
 So I sent it back and that's how I ended up with the other.
  </li><li>But I just wanna make it clear,
 I did buy you a Christmas present,
  </li><li>Even though it didn't arrive for months
 and then you didn't like it in the first place.
  </li><li>Yes.
 You did well.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Why are you looking behind you?
  </li><li>I don't know, I don't know.
 I don't know.
  </li><li>Did you think that got some sort of skills?
 I don't know what you're gonna do to me.
  </li><li>Use my go-go gadget arms
 and smack you in the back of the head or something.
  </li><li>So you got hats that arrived this week.
 I managed to break our version of the internet.
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>Well, three internet developments.
 One, if you are a Spotify person
 our podcast now available on Spotify.
 That seemed good.
 I announced that and lots of people give me feedback.
  </li><li>So it's lots of people who listen to Spotify.
  </li><li>If you're a person who doesn't know what Spotify is,
 not that I'm saying there's one sitting next to you.
  </li><li>Spotify. - Spotify is a what?
  </li><li>Spotify, you don't know how we have Apple Music
 where you just pay membership and you get all the music
 and you stream it whenever you want.
 Spotify is like that.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So it was one of the big people,
 the big first companies to kind of move in that direction.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So we don't use Spotify, but apparently a lot of people do.
 So I've got great feedback from that.
 So if you're a Spotify user, keeping up with the Joneses
 is now available on Spotify.
 That was a win.
 Exciting.
 We are also adding little snippets to our YouTube channel.
 So that's a win.
 YouTube.com/allonnaj.
 Where I broke things was we have a Facebook page.
 If you go to facebook.com/allonnaj.
 We used to have a Facebook page with lots of people
 following this.
 And then for reasons that are way too tedious to list.
 I basically have to build a brand new one and I couldn't transfer any of our users over.
 So if you happen to be a Facebook user, which I would imagine is a large proportion of people,
 it would do us a huge favor if you could just go to facebook.com/allonnaj and like and follow
 us there.
 Even if you've already done that, we had to create a brand new page and have about to
 delete the old page.
 So if you could do that, it would help.
 And by we, we mean you.
 You both bricked it and had to recreate it.
 Well, part of it was I don't really understand how Facebook works.
 Well, I'll tell you what it was, is I created the page.
 Yes.
 Then no longer wanted a Facebook account.
 Yes.
 So deleted my Facebook account.
 And prior to doing that made you the admin of the page.
 Right.
 Which I thought was enough.
 But no, no, no.
 I needed to make you an owner of the page.
 And I didn't find out too late.
 And there's no way to contact a human at Facebook.
 So I googled and I went on Reddit.
 And I tried everything I knew.
 And it wouldn't work.
 And so in the end, somebody suggested doing this.
 So that's what I do.
  </li><li>Very exciting stuff right there.
  </li><li>You know, it's not, you know, if you're tuned in
 and you're like, I didn't tune in for hats
 and your Facebook was, I tuned in
 for some crazy Holy Spirit stories.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, I'm sorry.
 Before we go to crazy Holy Spirit stories.
  </li><li>Is this a non-agenda item?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>We have an ongoing argument that needs to be solved
 by our podcast.
  </li><li>We have an ongoing problem
 where you're wrong. No, you're wrong. Tell people. And odd. Okay. So here's the deal.
 When Alan has a bath, this is a weird way of starting the story, he thinks it's totally normal
 when he's done his bath to take all the water out and still sit in the bath until it all drains out.
 And then he is dry before he gets out of the bath because he thinks like this is this is what people do.
 I'm like, I know nobody that does that.
 Well, let's just bring in a couple of, you know, one man's waist and fights another
 present.
 You go ahead.
 How many people have you actually surveyed about their bathing habits?
 Like none.
 So I'm the only person you know who does that.
 And I'm probably the only person that you know about their bathing habits.
 OK.
 OK.
 Point number one.
 Point number two is you've never asked me why I do that.
 You say that it like, I don't know, saves you time
 or kills two birds with one stone or it's a fish in
 or some nonsense like that, which it is.
 How long does it take your body to dry by itself
 without a towel in a wet surface?
 You know what this tells me?
 Is you haven't listened to the reason?
 Because those are none of the reasons I have given.
 Oh, what is your excellent reason for this very odd behavior?
  </li><li>When you get out of a hot bath--
  </li><li>I'm gonna check with your sisters, by the way,
 if this is like a family illness, or if it's just you.
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>When you get out of a bath, it's freezing cold
 because the bath water's like 105 degrees.
 And even if your room ambient temperatures
 like 72 degrees, you're cold.
 Whereas if you stay in the bath
 and you let the bath water out, it slowly drains out,
 thus giving the time for your body to acclimate.
  </li><li>And that's insane.
  </li><li>Oh, that is insane.
  </li><li>Best of all, if you lie in a particular way
 when the water drains out, you can capture some water
 in the small part of your back.
 And when you like push your back back and lift up,
 you can make farting noises in the bath with the excess water.
  </li><li>Oh, so that's the actual reason
 that you do this bizarre behavior.
  </li><li>The actual reason is I'm watching Netflix in the bath
 and my episode's not done.
 But, and that's it.
 And then when the episode's done, I get out of bath
 and it just so happens to be that
  </li><li>You're like, you're a weirdo.
  </li><li>No, you are a weirdo.
 And I think I'm gonna do a poll on Instagram.
  </li><li>Oh sure, let's take this to Instagram.
  </li><li>Do one of those yes, no things.
 Is this weird behavior or not?
 'Cause you said I haven't done a poll.
  </li><li>Okay, dude, I live--
  </li><li>Let's just see how many people sit in the bath
 while it drains and then while they dry.
 I'm sure it's completely normal.
 That's why it's in every movie you've ever seen.
 People doing it all the time.
 Here's the other thing, perhaps people have never stumbled
 onto this unique life hack.
 Okay, so you might follow your survey results.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which I applaud your scientific rigor.
 But what you might find is if you're like,
 I don't do that, but dang it, I'm gonna try it.
 I challenge you, go out there, A, B, the whole thing.
 Have a bath, get out of the bath.
 Ooh, it's cold.
 Or stay in the bath.
  </li><li>Or stay in the bath and be cold until you dry.
 See which one you like.
  </li><li>Have you ever tried it?
  </li><li>I'm not going to try it, it's dumb.
 to mark a ignorance right there. All right, well, this is the podcast gold you signed up for.
 When you saw the title of this episode and we're like, you know, holy spirit stories or whatever,
 we're calling it crazy prophetic encounters. They were actually helping to hear about your
 bat. Hats and bats. Yeah. That's what they're listening to. So I thought again, back to why
 we're talking about this is I got a prophetic word. You should write a book. I don't know what's
 right. A book about I survey people on Instagram, which is basically what we do these days. And
 of people give us a list of things to write books about.
 And I'm not writing a book right now.
 I'm doing a podcast.
 And this was one of the things,
 hey, tell us some stories about prophetic encounters
 or Holy Spirit encounters.
 And I thought, that's a great podcast.
 Story time, about times we've encountered the Holy Spirit
 or the prophetic in amazing ways.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Take us away.
  </li><li>You want me to just start with one?
  </li><li>Go for it.
  </li><li>Okay, so those of you that have heard my testimony,
 that you know, you know, I got saved Baptist,
 and then ended up in the church in Toronto
 a number of years later.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I had had one encounter that we've shared
 about on previous podcasts where Mark DuPont
 had prophesied over me and at the end of the service,
 I ended up on the floor, got slain in the spirit,
 didn't know what was going on
 'cause none of this had ever happened to me before
 and was laughing and whatnot.
 But then from that time to the story,
 I'm gonna tell you really nothing like that had happened again.
  </li><li>And am I right to thinking that when Mark profs
 out over you and you got slain in the spirit,
 which is you got so overwhelmed by the Holy Spirit,
 you fell down. - Yes.
  </li><li>That was all pre-revival.
  </li><li>Pre-revival. - Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, pre-revival.
 And, but everybody like around me seemed like,
 "Yay, this is God."
 And they'd stretch their hands towards me.
 And I'm like, "Why aren't you calling an ambulance?
 I can't stand up."
 Like I'm lying on the floor and I just didn't know
 what was going on.
 Anyway, now we fast forward about probably two years maybe.
 And I've, the revival has started in Toronto.
 I've shown up with the team from YWAM because I did YWAM.
 And for the last two weeks that I was with YWAM, the revival had just started.
 So there was like, yeah, there's some overlap.
 And our team actually was already scheduled to come and do this play called
 toy maker and son. And so they just had that happen at the revival.
 Anyway, at the end of all of that, I played Satan in the play.
 It wasn't typecasting though, so you should be fine.
 The youth pastor said, Hey, AJ, you know, come on up here.
 Actually, he said, the name of the person was the apprentice.
 So he's like, why don't we have the apprentice come up and everybody's like,
 and everybody's drunk. Like, you know, yay.
 Everyone's drunk in the Holy Spirit.
 Drunk in the Holy Spirit. Okay. Just in case you're new to our podcast.
 And quite rowdy and you know, and so I was like,
 okay, so I like walk up there and Brian's like,
 hey, do you mind if we pray for you?
 And I was like, you can pray for me,
 but I'm not falling over.
  </li><li>Because at this point you've seen some of the stuff
 that's happening in the church and you don't like it.
  </li><li>I'm not happy.
 I felt like my church got ruined.
 So I've heard all these stories,
 but this is my first time sort of back.
 And it's just like, you know, yes.
 And it looks like chaos to me,
 and I don't have a grid for anything I'm seeing.
 And I feel sad, I feel scared,
 I don't know why my church now looks like this.
 And of course, Brian doesn't recognize me,
 I'm like Brian, it's AJ, and he's like,
 oh great, can we pray for you?
 And I said-- - 'Cause you're in makeup.
  </li><li>I'm in full makeup, full black, drapey outfit,
 everything. - Nice.
  </li><li>And so I said, you can pray for me,
 but I'm not falling over and he said,
 I don't care if you fall over.
 And I said, sure you don't.
  </li><li>So full on AJ Sasse to the max.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm literally thinking I have to leave this church
 and I love John and Carol
 and I'm looking at them at the front row,
 but everything looks crazy.
 And I--
  </li><li>I can't believe people are for this.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And Brian like just reaches out his hand,
 prays for me, he doesn't touch me.
 And boom, I fall over like so fast.
 Did you feel anything happened to you when you fell out?
 Do you feel like you were pushed or knocked down?
  </li><li>Well, I thought I was pushed.
  </li><li>You thought you were pushed?
  </li><li>So I literally stood right back up and I said,
 you pushed me and he goes, I didn't touch you.
 And so I looked over at John and Carol
 who were in the front row and they're like,
 he didn't touch you.
 And he's like, can I pray for you again?
 Like he's just being super calm and everything.
 And I was like, sure, but take a step back.
 So, so he, and this is all like on the mic in front of a couple hundred people.
 So he took a step back and so he's probably standing about a meter away and he's
 just like, Holy spirit, would you come and bring peace?
 Boom.
 I hit the floor again.
 Well, this time I tried to get back up and the bottom part of my body wouldn't
 move.
 So I just sat up and I was like, you pushed me.
 And he said, I didn't push you.
 And I was like somebody pushed me because I felt like I was pushed over.
 and everybody's looking at me like, nobody touched you.
 And he prayed again for peace,
 and I went out again on the floor.
 And at that point, I got stuck to the floor,
 almost like somebody had super glued me,
 like the only thing I could move was my eyes.
 I couldn't move my head, I couldn't tilt anything.
 I was literally just stuck to the floor.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And I just started crying.
  </li><li>What were your tears about?
  </li><li>'Cause I was so confused.
 I was like, I don't understand what's happening to me.
 I feel scared, I feel out of control,
 which turned out to be the actual issue.
 And I cried for a while, and then I just was like,
 I remember saying, Lord, I just need to know if this is you.
 And just got so sweetly said, well,
 have you stuck yourself to the floor?
 And then I just started crying again,
 like really, I mean, really crying.
 And Carol came over and Carol at the time
 was not super confrontational or anything like that.
 But she just leaned over and she looked at me
 and she said, "You need to choose
 who's gonna be in control of your life, you or God."
 And then she just smiled at me and she walked away.
 And I was like, and I ultimately was stuck
 to the floor for hours.
  </li><li>So couldn't get up, couldn't you lost your power
 with your limbs and your, yeah.
  </li><li>They had to like peel me off the floor
 to get me into the bus to go back to the base.
  </li><li>And what did that, like now as you tell our story,
 like what did the event, what did that event do
 for you in the moment.
  </li><li>In the moment it shifted everything.
 I literally was in the bus driving there,
 hearing all these crazy stories about what's going on there,
 thinking, dang it, my church is ruined, I have to leave.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>I felt like when I got there and saw
 what I thought was craziness, I was like,
 I am gonna have to leave, I'm so mad, I'm so sad.
  </li><li>I mean, you're thinking,
 I can't believe these people are so deceived.
 How could this be God, like what's wrong with us?
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm thinking, how could it be God?
 and I don't understand, like I love John and Carol.
 I trust John and Carol.
 How can they be okay with?
 There's people randomly laughing.
 There's people lying on the floor over there.
 Like they're not even paying attention.
 You know, like to me, it wasn't, you know,
 church is supposed to look a certain way.
 But after that, like I remember getting on the bus
 and just being like, I don't have an explanation
 for all the things that I saw.
 And I'm still scared by some of the things that I saw,
 but I do think that it's God
 and I'm never running away from God.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So I remember thinking, okay, I'm not leaving,
 I'm gonna stay, I'm gonna seek to understand
 or at least seek to trust.
 And so I stayed, you know?
 And there were like, I definitely had moments
 where I'd, you know, stuff would be happening
 and I'd be like, man.
  </li><li>'Cause you would have seen some crazy stuff.
  </li><li>Crazy stuff, but also amazing stuff, amazing healings,
 amazing miracles, you know?
 And I would have missed it all,
 'cause I didn't like packaging.
 That's that whole thing, God offends the mind to reveal the heart.
 Yes, I was definitely offended.
 But revealing your heart, like you were having control issues.
 And how sweet that the Holy Spirit spoke to you and then Carol, who knew nothing about
 your conversation with the Lord, confirmed it.
 Yeah.
 Like you need to decide who's going to be in control.
 Yeah.
 Wow.
 I love that story, babe.
 Yeah, it's a good story.
 I love that story.
 I was thinking about some of the first times I ever encountered the Holy Spirit.
 I grew up in a church that was not pro whole,
 I was going to say not pro-holy spirit.
 Of course there were pro-holy spirits, theologically,
 but in terms of practice, in terms of experience,
 that wasn't something we majored on.
 And I remember meeting the Holy Spirit in a very powerful way.
 I've told that story before on the podcast.
 But what that birthed in me was this real hunger.
 And I would buy all the books about what you're talking about.
 Like I read John's books before I ever met him.
 I was reading Derek Prince's stories all about encounters with God.
 And it just birthed the real hunger in me for God.
 And I can't stress enough that when I tell this story,
 I think the danger is that often when you hear people who are in ministry,
 tell stories, you think those things happen to you because you're in ministry.
 And I was not in ministry at all. I didn't know you.
 I hadn't met John and Carol. I hadn't even left Scotland.
 Yeah, I'm a school teacher.
 I can't describe to you how utterly normal my life is.
 And yet I went through seasons of my life
 in Scotland and Edinburgh when I lived as a school teacher.
 All I had, I didn't have any of the knowledge I have now,
 didn't have any of the experience,
 didn't have any of the relationships I had.
 All I had was a burning hunger to know the Lord more.
 And I would just start soaking,
 which we talked about a couple of weeks ago.
 Like just lying down and inviting the Holy Spirit to come.
 Well, what happened was there was several events
 in that little apartment on 47 Warrinder Park Road in Edinburgh,
 where the Holy Spirit would come, would show up into my room.
 Nobody else was there, just me just praying.
 And the Holy Spirit would show up,
 and then my only response would be,
 I'd have to be face down, eyes crunched,
 eyes closed, face buried in the carpet,
 because everything would feel so bright,
 that a presence would come in the room,
 and it was so bright, I'd have to close my eyes,
 closing my eyes did nothing.
 So I'd bury my face in the carpet.
 And I would feel a weight, like,
 oh, not like a weight localized placed on my back
 where I can feel like that's a bag of sugar.
 He weighed a heaviness in the room that would come.
 I remember several times having a commando crawl
 under my bed to get away from it.
 Now you're like, why would you wanna get away?
 Were you scared?
 No, I wasn't scared.
 I, it was so funny because I spent so much time praying
 and asking for the Holy Spirit to come
 that when he did, I would command a crawl away from him.
 And I remember at times having to pray,
 Holy Spirit, you're gonna have to lift off me.
 As much as it pains me, fills me with chagrin
 to ask you to just ease off the accelerator.
 I'm worried that this mortal frame can't withstand
 the weight of your presence.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And I love that.
 I love talking about that.
 That was in my bedroom.
 at home when I was a school teacher.
 And we're not telling these stories on the podcast
 to be like, "Ha ha, look at our awesome encounters with God."
 It's to actually wet your appetite
 for the same encounters that we're having.
 I believe are fully available to everyone.
 You don't have to have been to Toronto.
 You don't have to have gone to a special place
 or heard a special teaching.
 I believe that God honors hunger.
 And yeah, like--
  </li><li>Well, the Bible says he's no respecter of persons.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>So it's not about you and it's not about me
 It's not about favor, it's just about God actually,
 He will draw close to us as we--
  </li><li>A scripture check.
  </li><li>As we choose to resist the devil, if we submit to God,
 if we draw close to Him, He will draw close to you.
 I used to just think that that,
 draw Him close to you was,
 He'll just give you like special lenses
 so you can read the Bible better.
 No, He will literally show up,
 He will manifest His presence.
 And that little apartment on Warrinder part road,
 that saw a lot of Holy Spirit action.
 I remember one time.
  </li><li>Is that the apartment that you lived in with Jamie?
  </li><li>No, different apartment.
 This is when I lived in with Mel and Glenn at some point.
  </li><li>Okay, okay.
  </li><li>Mackie and other time.
 I remember one time the Holy Spirit came,
 I was praying for a friend of mine.
 And the Holy Spirit came so quickly,
 he had the same experiences as you guys praying for him.
 He fell flat on his back.
 You know, I didn't even have time to catch him.
 To be honest, I didn't know that was gonna happen.
 He starts shaking under the power of the Holy Spirit
 so much that the windows in our house start rattling.
 And I'm thinking, I'm going to get a knock on the door from neighbors at some point.
 I don't think we can talk about crazy, holy spirit, incredible encounters
 without talking about our time in Iceland.
 But which time the first time or so many times, but I was thinking mainly about
 the first time that we went to Iceland.
 And we've talked about this again.
 I have, I can't remember the episode, but Chris will do his due diligence.
 Look it up and put it in a little lower third for you.
 Actually, that won't help the people who are not video podcasts.
 When you tell a story about Iceland and I'll look up.
 Okay.
 So the first time that we went to Iceland, we're doing a conference that was sort of out
 in the middle of nowhere.
 I remember they put us in a cabin at the base of a glacier and all that it was stunning.
 Yeah.
 And it was cold because it was November.
 It was so cold.
 We were at this sort of Christian retreat center in Iceland.
 The population of Iceland is not large and there's maybe a total of like at the time,
 I think they told us like three or five thousand Christians total in Iceland, but anyway, we went to this retreat center and
 There was amazing things that happened wasn't there
 I remember there was a bunch of deaf people that got healed at a service
 Well, some of the most amazing things that happened we didn't know about until we came back a couple months later
 So there were certainly a lot of stuff going on that we were aware of but nowhere near the totality of what was happening
  </li><li>Yeah, or even some of them we'd hear like a day or two later,
 like I remember there was three drug dealers that showed up
 to, 'cause somebody owed them money.
  </li><li>To collect a debt, yeah.
  </li><li>To break somebody's knees.
  </li><li>And they showed up high,
 but they came into the presence of God
 and were instantly sobered,
 and they knew that this was something different,
 and they all gave their lives to the Lord.
  </li><li>And then the guy that they'd come to beat up
 to get their money from,
 at the end of the night, the four of them
 were all lying on the floor,
 laughing their heads off as the Holy Spirit was touching.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I mean, there was, there was so many crazy stories.
 There was the first deaf couple that got healed
 at this one service and there was a bunch of deaf people
 that got healed, but it was this older couple
 who had never heard each other's voices.
 They had been married for, you know, whatever.
 And all of a sudden, and this was just like,
 we were emceeing, nobody was praying for them.
 We were just saying, "Holy spirit, come."
 And, you know, kids were talking about the angels
 they were seeing and how they loved coming to these meetings
 because it's the only place that they saw the angels.
 And so we were just like, I mean, literally,
 I felt like an observer that happened
 to be standing on the platform, you know,
 just watching God do stuff.
  </li><li>For sure.
  </li><li>But this, watching this couple, all of a sudden,
 hear each other for the first time.
 And then when they shared that testimony,
 there was other people that got healed
 and their ears opened.
 There was a lady with a tumor who got healed.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, that was the one we didn't know
 about till afterwards.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, there was a guy who, our friend Baldur,
 when rescued him from a psychiatric hospital.
 He was somebody that was well known enough in Reykjavik
 in the capital of Iceland that people would cross
 the other side of the road
 because they didn't want to be near this guy.
 And he got radically touched by the Holy Spirit.
 I remember when we were in worship,
 I was sitting down in prayer.
 I was on my chair, elbows on my knees, praying.
 And then when I stood up to sing,
 I could feel my head, like the altitude was different.
 When I stood up to sing, it was like my head went
 into a cloud of like, whoa, I was suddenly so woozy.
 I sat back down again, clear mind, stood up,
 whoa, same thing.
 And that got more intense when you'd get up to speak.
 I remember one night we couldn't even speak.
 It was a waste of time, try to speak.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like, you know, what are we gonna speak?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>The only thing we could do was testify about Jesus,
 but Jesus was already in the room.
 Right. It's like talking about somebody while they're there, just, you know,
 it was remarkable. Do you remember what happened?
 One of the nights that we left and we were driving home. Yes. Tell that story.
 So, um, it's, it's myself and you and Johannes. Yep.
 And we're all driving along and it's what 11 p.m. at night. Yes. Something like that.
 And it's dark because I so dark out in the country, pitch black, see the skies, gorgeous.
 Right. And we all look over to the right and we see what looks like a massive kind of forest fire,
 but it's like far off. But huge fire. But huge fire. Blazing. You can see the heat stroke waves.
 You know, when you look through a fire and it all looks hazy and wavy. So we like look over and we're
 like, look over there. And we're both freaking out. You'll harness sees it as well. And he's like,
  </li><li>All over the car.
  </li><li>That is the Westman Isles,
 and he has an ant, or it was an ant,
 a relative that lives on the Isles,
 and we thought it's on fire.
  </li><li>We thought the whole village,
 it looked like a village on fire.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so he called his relative,
 woke him up, 11 p.m. and I, like,
 what is going on?
 And the person's like, nothing's going on, I was in bed.
 Look outside, like the whole of the village is on fire.
 But it wasn't on fire.
  </li><li>But all three of us saw it.
 physically solid fire.
  </li><li>No sense.
 Like when I went to Iceland, it was really, really clear
 that there was a lot of angelic activity going on.
 In the spirit.
 So what I mean by that is,
 my eyes are open and I can see the natural world,
 but you could also see things in the heavenly,
 but not with your natural eyes, with your spiritual eyes.
 Not a very helpful description.
 This was physical, physical, like--
  </li><li>Yeah, that kind of scene.
  </li><li>And we can look at it.
 And it's a nation, it's not a nation, sorry,
 village on fire. But you remember we were having visions at night like I had that
 vision of Iceland turned upside down and you know I'm just crazy so much
 crazy stuff. Heavenly activity. Yeah so we just always said yes like when they
 were when they were like do you want to come back we're like yeah always we're
 always gonna come back yeah yeah just that was a time that I would say that is
 the single most I'm not I when I say the single most anointed time of life that
 had nothing to do with me or you. Absolutely nothing to do with us. We just happened to be there.
 Yeah. And the anointing of the Holy Spirit was there. But that was the time where I've probably
 first hand seen the most amazing level of anointing being operated. Yeah. It just felt like
 you would just call out words of knowledge and people would be healed. I remember, here's a story.
 this. I found that the more I've walked with the Lord, the more I think I get over a fence,
 and then the Lord finds a new way to offend my mind. Not that the Lord's looking for ways to
 offend me, but just I keep putting God in a box and he keeps breaking out of the box,
 and that's what's offensive to me. That's a better way to say.
 Yeah, yeah, that's good. So, you know, to begin with, the first time I ever went to a charismatic
 church, I was offended that people were raising their hands. Like, why are you raising your hands
 and worship. What's wrong with you? Do you have a question? Do you all need to go to the bathroom?
 Do you need a hallway pass? Like what is going on? Yeah. So then once I find out that raising
 your hands is in the Bible and it's a cultural thing, I'm fine. Then people dancing, "What?
 Excuse me. I was okay with hand waving, but this thing, you know, then flags, then banners,
 whatever." Right. Right. Then people falling down. That really bothered me. Then people laughing.
 That really bothered me. And sooner or later, for me, all that stuff, I just don't even notice it
 anymore. So I think I'm good. Yes. Well, then one night, the Holy Spirit starts turning
 teeth into gold. And I'm offended. I'm like, why would God do that? First of all, it's a little
 presumptuous that I'd ever be demanding an explanation that God, like God needs my permission
 to do anything. Yeah, explain it to me, God. Why are you doing this?
 Adrian, I were talking. We have a bone to pick with you. Yeah.
 And I saw that in Toronto. I saw like John and Carol praying for dental miracles.
 And I saw, you know, teeth get filled. The Malcom fillings turned to gold.
 So we're in Iceland. Yeah. And we're thinking, oh, you know what would be a great idea?
 Let's pray for dental miracles. I saw, I'm sure I got a video of this and needed to dig this out.
 I was looking in the guy's mouth when this happened. His mouth is filled with the Malcom fillings.
 We have a flash like black gray, you know, like we're looking at a flashlight and I'm watching them
 turn from this kind of dull matte brown into shiny gold. And as trivial as that is, I don't
 mean trivial in that it's very, very difficult to do, I would imagine, not being a metal or
 just, but watching that happen in one sense, it's trivial because nothing, how has that
 changed anybody's life, right? When there's people who are dying or cripples that need
 to be able to get our wheelchairs. And yet simultaneously the most astonishing thing to see.
  </li><li>Right. - God, like with my own eyes,
 I'm watching that happen.
  </li><li>Yeah, well it's signs that make you wonder, isn't it?
  </li><li>It certainly made me wonder.
  </li><li>It certainly gets your attention.
 Well, when all that was happening in Toronto,
 I got to lead a bunch of people to the Lord
 that worked at National Car Rental,
 'cause our buildings were right next door to each other.
  </li><li>Yeah, they really are.
  </li><li>And it made it in the papers that there was this church
 and people's, you know, were getting gold teeth
 and getting dental miracles.
 And so there was people that I worked with
 that were saying, "Hey, could I come with you
 "to your church because I actually have some problems
 with my teeth and they got healed and I got to lead them to the Lord.
 So and then like one of our VPs, he had sort of walked away from the Lord.
 He also came and he didn't need a dental miracle.
 He just wanted to watch what was happening, but afterwards got to pray with him as well.
 So I mean, it's just like to me, I'm like, why did God do it?
 I don't know, but there was a lot of great fruit, you know, so maybe to get people's attention.
 Yeah.
 So Iceland, if you want to hear some more crazy stories from Iceland, then episode 106,
 we did an interview, we did a podcast from Iceland with our friend Baldur, he's one of the pastors
 there. And he, I mean, he's got stories to tell his salvation story alone, his conversion story is
 amazing. So so many stories in Iceland. I think if I'm going to talk about incredible encounters
 with the Holy Spirit. I have to talk about our friend Gary Morgan.
 Yes.
 So you've probably heard us talk about Gary. Gary is from Wales originally. You met him
 first. You and Gary did a conference together in London.
 Yes.
 You came back and told me you've got to meet this guy.
 Yeah.
 I was suspicious.
 Yeah.
 I don't know. I've been told what I'm going to like.
 Right.
 And then I meet him and I'm like, oh, you're absolutely right. He's like a brother from
 another mother.
 Well, and you guys still talk every week.
 Oh, yeah.
 And it's been one of my best years.
 Yeah.
 Yep.
 is, is it fair to call him unusual?
  </li><li>He has an unusual gift.
  </li><li>He has an unusual gift.
  </li><li>And you call him unusual and makes him sound like he's odd.
  </li><li>He's not odd.
  </li><li>No, he's like, he's the most normal.
 He's one of the most normal prophets I know.
  </li><li>He does speak in rhyme a lot.
  </li><li>Yeah, but that's a Welsh thing as well.
  </li><li>Well, that's probably it, yeah.
  </li><li>And a prophet thing, but yeah, it's a Welsh thing for sure.
 So, Gary Morgan has one of the most
 extraordinary prophetic gifts I've ever seen in my life. I know lots of
 prophets. I know lots of people with a prophetic gift. I don't really know
 anybody who operates with Gary from the just naturally supernatural. I mean
 this is not my main story. We're driving with us a couple years ago. We're driving
 out the highway. He's from Australia. His cell phone's not activated. So you ask
 can I use your cell phone? I say sure I hand him my phone and I'm about to tell
 him my pin is and I don't need to because he's already put in my six-digit pin
 which I've never told him.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I have to say Gary and he's like yeah,
 I was like, "Do you need my pen?"
 He's like, "No, I got it."
  </li><li>Well, and we've had several times
 where we've gone to meet him someplace.
 Like we both flew into the same airport
 and he knows exactly where we are in the airport.
  </li><li>Yeah, we've flown in. - He just cuts and walks up to us.
  </li><li>We've flown in from North America
 to Sydney International Airport, big airport.
 He's flown into Sydney domestic.
 And he's come and found us without knowing
 what flight we're on or what gate we're on.
 It wasn't even at a gate.
 He was just waiting on the top of a set of escalators.
 We've been in hotels that he doesn't know where we are
 and he'll just come straight to the door and knock.
 So that's impressive, that's low level.
 But that's just an indication of the level of revelation
 that he walks in in a normal everyday life.
 Like I remember last time I was here,
 Gary and I were sitting in the factory at Franklin.
 Gary and I were just talking.
 And as we get up to leave, he turns to me and he says,
 "That man's name is," I forget the guy's name,
 And I was like, yeah, that is that guy's name.
 Gary never met him.
 I'd never introduced him.
 Gary walks over, tells the guy, hey, I was praying for you.
 Doesn't tell him, hey, your name is this.
 And I was like, why don't you tell him
 that he's like, he already knew what his name was.
 And then gives him a word.
  </li><li>And also Gary's not particularly,
 he's not trying to impress you with anything.
 He's just being obedient with his gift.
  </li><li>Totally.
 But I don't think I've ever talked about this.
 I've had the privilege of being an eye witness
 to some things that have happened behind closed doors.
 When he would stay with us out with integrity,
 every morning, he would come downstairs
 and he would show us at the beginning of the day
 the words that the Holy Spirit gave him
 for the rest of the day.
  </li><li>'Cause he would get them in the shower.
  </li><li>He'd get them in the shower.
  </li><li>Which seems really unfair to me.
 I just wanna say, just very unfair.
  </li><li>That's actually why I lie in the bath for so long.
 I let the water out and angel comes to me,
 gives me the words for the day.
  </li><li>You're gonna have to do it in the morning, I think.
  </li><li>But yeah, he'd come downstairs and say,
 this is a list of the words of knowledge
 got for the day, then we would go out throughout the day and sure enough, he would meet the
 person that he wrote their name down or a phone number or just for integrity. You would just
 say, this is what's going to happen today and this is who we're going to meet. And so one time,
 I'm Gary is going to go prophesy over a major leader and his wife. And he said,
 he'd made an appointment. This person had sought an appointment with Gary actually,
 saying, you know, I've heard that you're, you know, you can hear from God, would you come and
 meet with me? So he says, yes. And to my shock and delight, he said, Al, would you come with me?
 I just want you to be a witness. So I'm like, what do I do? He's just like, I just want you
 here with me. So me and Gary, going to this room where we meet with this leader and his wife,
 and I kid you not. I think maybe this is the only time I've ever seen this. I watched that leader
 literally, not figuratively, fall to their knees in amazement.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Because Gary tells this person the conversation
 that he and his wife had in the car
 on the way to their meeting.
 It was like a 40 minute meeting
 and he just lays out (imitates
 (imitates
 And we finished that meeting, we walk out and Gary's just like, "Bloom in heck."
 I was like, "Are you okay?" He's like, "Yeah, that was crazy."
 And what I loved was Gary was in awe of what just happened.
 Yes. I was as we were. He doesn't play a cool or anything.
 He's like, "What? Is it amazing?" He's aware I'm a conduit from what's happening in heaven
 on earth. I mean, that, like, I didn't receive the word.
 A little Gary's given us amazing words over the years, but just to witness that
 that happen is astonishing.
  </li><li>Yeah, totally.
  </li><li>What about the time you came to the school
 and got one of the students' phone numbers?
  </li><li>Well, I think there was a backstory with that too,
 because he had a dream where he got some information
 for this person.
  </li><li>No, no, she had a dream.
  </li><li>That's right.
 She had a dream. - With one of our students,
 we didn't know this till afterwards.
 Basically, Gary comes to the school, walks into my office,
 He's like, "Bro, I need a pen and paper."
 And he writes down a 10-digit number.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And says, "Does this number mean to you?"
 So I write down this as a phone number.
 So I plug it into my phone,
 and up comes my address book
 that it's a number stored in my phone.
 And so I said, "Yeah, it does."
 And he's like, "I'm gonna go for it."
 So he, you know, this, you know,
 doing prophetic ministry.
 He said, "Hey, I got this number
 "as soon as I walked in the building.
 "Whose number is this?"
 And it was one of the students who said,
 "That's my phone number."
 And of course, that's amazing,
 but what was crazy, which Gary didn't know
 and I didn't know.
  </li><li>Well, he then gives that person a prophetic word.
  </li><li>And the student then gets something and says,
 here's what's crazy, I had a dream.
 I think it was a week before.
 I had a dream that I tried to call you
 and leave a message on your cell phone,
 but I forgot to leave my number to call you back.
 And in the dream, the Holy Spirit was like,
 don't worry, Gary has your number.
 And then you come in today and tell me my phone number
 and give me this prophetic word.
 I was like, you can't make this stuff up.
 Well, that was the weekend with that within just a few days,
 he called out 50 people by words of knowledge and all of those words of
 knowledge were either their names, their addresses, their phone numbers,
 their social security numbers, but they were all like super specific things that
 he would call them out by, but then he, he prophesies over them.
 So it's sort of a combination of that word of knowledge and the,
 and the prophetic flowing together, which is quite fun.
 Um, okay.
 So here's one sort of about angelic invitations
 and third heaven things and whatnot.
  </li><li>Let's just not casually throw about those terms.
 What do you mean, third heaven?
  </li><li>So what you'll hear, you'll understand
 as I tell the story.
  </li><li>Okay, I'll.
  </li><li>Okay, so the back story is probably two years
 before the story I'm about to tell.
 I'm sitting at home minding my own business as it were
 and somebody from the church calls and says,
 Our speaker for this week has just fallen through.
 It's a Tuesday.
 And so at the time, what would happen is one speaker would do Tuesday,
 Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
 We didn't have services on Monday night.
 And so they said, and the MC is also six.
 So could you come in and both MC and speak for the next five services?
 And I was like, Oh, I mean, I can't.
 I'm home, but you know, so I said, yes.
 And so I was kind of nervous because I didn't really have a good plan.
 I would like to have had some time to shape what I was going to do over five services
 and all that kind of stuff.
 And then I'm seeing an addition felt like a lot.
 So I sort of showed up, went to prayer time, still didn't really feel like I knew what
 I was supposed to do.
 But during worship, at one point I looked over at the screen and underneath the screen I
 saw this massive angel.
 And it had a shield and the angels probably 50 feet tall.
 I mean, it was huge.
 It had a shield that was on fire.
 And I just, I looked at it and I just like kept staring at it.
 It was still there.
 It was still there.
 It was still there.
 And then I blinked and I looked back and it wasn't there anymore.
 When you say you saw it, do you mean you saw it like the west when I was were on fire?
 Yes.
 So you saw it real.
 Okay.
 Wow.
 And so I, and then it was gone.
 I'm sure it was still there, but I couldn't see it.
  </li><li>It went to Starbucks.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
 It needed a latte, who knew.
 So anyway, I then something caught my eye,
 so I sort of looked over further along the front row
 and there was a person that was sort of waving at me
 and gesturing things and I thought,
 so I walked over 'cause I'm, you know, I'm seeing.
 So if God's saying something,
 I should probably know about it.
 So I walked over and the person said to me,
 did you see it?
 Did you see it?
 I thought, this is me, my cynical self.
 I'm not going to tell you what I saw because I'm going to be like, yeah, that's
 what I saw, you know, so
 we're filled with faith.
 I know, right?
 So I was like, what did you see?
 And, and this person said this massive angel with a shield in front of it.
 That was on fire.
 And I was like, that's what I saw.
 Anyway, it was really cool.
 And I remember the service went wild.
 Couldn't tell you what I spoke on.
 But so that was the one time I ever saw this massive angel.
 Right.
 Fast forward to like two years later.
 And you and I are in the green room during a conference.
 I'm not even sure why we were in the green room.
 I know neither of us were actually speaking at that conference.
 I was probably stealing cookies.
 Yeah.
 I mean,
 cookies, borrowing cookies, permanently.
 Mm hmm.
 So, but anyway, we were in there and for some reason we were sitting at the
 table with Bob Jones and a couple of other people, his wife, and we were
 all eating steak.
 I remember that part.
 And so we're all in the middle of eating and Bob says,
 Oh, there he is. Do you see him?
 No, I don't mean to make him sound like a parrot, but he.
 But that's literally what happened.
 We're all, you know, polite conversation.
 You know, there's probably about 10 people at that table.
 Yeah, big round table.
 And once you're talking to each other and Bob, who's not talking to anybody who
 just eating a steak.
 Yeah, just cuts across the whole conversation.
 Well, yeah, there it is.
 There it is.
 Do you see him?
 Well, somebody said, what was that Bob?
 He's like, there's Ira.
 There's Ira.
 And we're like, who's who's Ira?
 And then you said, well, I don't see him, but I feel him.
 You and you said, you know, I kind of feel it.
 Well, what happened is before he said there's Ira, I felt an angel.
 And the way I feel angels, the way I tended to discern angels, but before I ever see them
 as I tend to feel them and I tend to feel them on my forearms.
 I that's how I felt.
 So while we're having dinner and I'm a conversation with somebody, I'm like, oh,
 that's interesting.
 And then Bob says that.
 Yeah.
 So I'm like, did you and he said, did you see him?
 And I said, well, I didn't see him, but I felt him.
 And Bob says, boy, you see with all five senses.
  </li><li>We're like...
  </li><li>And I'm like, pretty sure you're filming.
 Pretty sure you only see with one of them.
 And so I think I kept that.
 I was like, pretty sure you only see with one of them.
 He's like, boy, you see with all five senses.
 And I said, well, no, I felt them.
 And he said, well, and then he said, again,
 I see with all five senses.
 I said, so when you said you saw it,
 did you see it with your eyes
 or did you feel it in your spirit?
 And he said, I felt it in my spirit,
 but you see with all five senses.
 Yeah.
 So then he said, he turned to me,
 and the first question he asked me was,
 do you see angels?
 And I was like, well, I've seen one,
 and I described the one that I had seen,
 and he said, that's Ira.
 And he said, Ira guards the well of revival at this church.
 And I was like, oh, that's really cool, you know.
 So--
  </li><li>What else are you supposed to see,
 your response, that?
  </li><li>Right, okay, yeah.
  </li><li>So we all go back to eating,
 and then obviously he looks up at me again,
 and he goes, you've been to heaven?
 And I was like, "Uh."
 And what he doesn't know is we've, you know,
 I've been in Isabelle, I've come and talked to us
 about third heaven encounters.
 And so we've all been just sort of open to Lord,
 if you wanna show us what's happening in heaven.
 And so I'd had a couple of encounters
 where I felt like I had gone to heaven,
 but I just wasn't sure.
 I was really kind of insecure about it.
  </li><li>'Cause around this time, all your friends
 are having these encounters
 where they're having visions of being in heaven
 and they're coming back and they're saying,
 this is what it's like, this is what I saw.
 And so you're like, I'd love that,
 but what you're feeling you're having feels
 way less substantial than what they report.
  </li><li>Right, it's all on the screen in my mind.
 And because I'd had a couple of open visions,
 things that were, God showed up and everything else
 got peeled away, this felt so much less than that.
 And so even though I had felt like, okay,
 I think I'm in the throne room and I've had these couple of experiences.
 I've kind of convinced myself by this point that I've made it all up in my mind.
 Right. I just want to be like my friends. I'm now making things happen.
 And so now I'm like discounting everything. And so he says, you know,
 says you've been to heaven and I was like, well, I don't, I don't really know, you know,
 and, and he goes, we'll come over here. And I'm like, okay, come on.
 And by this time, just the three of us, it's just bobbing you.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Everybody else has finished their food and gone on.
 And there's three other people in the room,
 places in the room, but so I go over in and Bob's sort of
 on that side of you on your right side.
 And so I go over in, stand next to him and he goes,
 well go on, go up.
  </li><li>And he's eating like peach cobbler or something.
  </li><li>Yeah, he's, he hasn't stopped shoveling food the whole time.
 And I was like, sorry, what do you mean?
 And what?
 And he goes, go on, go up.
 And I just thought, okay, I'm just gonna.
 humor the prophet. You know, so he says, put your hands on your stomach. So I like, you
 know, stacked my hands one on top of the other and put them on my stomach. And he put his
 hands on on top of my hand and just go up.
 I'll go. And that's probably more accurate. Yeah. So I'm standing there and for probably,
 I don't know how long it was, but it felt like forever where I'm just seeing black.
 And in my head, I just say to myself, I just I don't see anything. It's just black. And
 He goes, that's the second heaven, keep going.
  </li><li>But what's important, and it's important, you know,
 I'm watching this whole conversation.
 Everything AJ says and reports that she's saying,
 she's saying to herself, she's not speaking out loud.
 So I'm watching Bob have a conversation with my wife.
  </li><li>He's answering what I'm thinking.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That I haven't said out loud.
  </li><li>Yeah, so I'm super confused, but watching this.
  </li><li>Right, so then I come up in heaven
 where the same place where I would normally come up
 in the throne room, it looks all exactly the same,
 which is part of why I was like,
 I'm making it up and I can't even make up something new.
 And so I come up in this spot and I was like,
 oh, you know, it's exactly the same.
 And he's like, yep, that's the throne room.
 Now look around and I'm like, okay.
 And again, you're hearing his, but not hearing mine.
 And so I start walking and he goes,
 and I see the father sitting on the throne.
 Now I'd never seen the father sitting on the throne before,
 but I see the father sitting on the throne
 and I start walking towards him and he goes,
 that's right, walk towards him.
 And so I'm starting to freak out a little bit now
 because Bob is--
  </li><li>Bob is seeing your vision.
  </li><li>I feel like he's narrating my experience.
 And so I'm like, okay, and I keep walking towards him
 and I walk right up to the father,
 the father leans over and he puts his hand on my face
 and Bob says, that's right, he's got his hand on your face.
  </li><li>And I'm like--
  </li><li>And I, but then I just opened my eyes and looked at Bob,
 like, you know, and he's like, there you did it.
 Yeah, yeah, he's, yeah.
 See, you have been to heaven and I'm like, whoa, I mean, inside.
 I was.
 And then my left brain kicks in and I'm like, just firing questions
 life right in center of Bob and getting nowhere because Bob's
 answers aren't helping me.
 I'm like, Bob, how did you know where she was?
 He was like, I was there with her.
 And I was like, pretty sure you were hearing peach cobbler.
 And that's when he was like, boy, you can be in two places at once.
 I get, I get, I'm like, again, pretty sure you can.
  </li><li>No, no, Bob.
 Poor Bob.
 Yeah.
 I mean, that whole evening was quite the...
  </li><li>Oh, what an experience.
  </li><li>Yeah, it was pretty crazy.
 So, I mean, we have tons of stories,
 but I think that, you know, we've told a bunch.
  </li><li>Here's why we told a bunch is, again,
 it's not to be like, "Ah, look at the awesome stories we have."
 It's to provoke you to hunger for your own stories.
  </li><li>Yes.
 I'm so serious about this.
 You just need to be hungry.
 You just need to ask if you will ask the Lord.
 Here's what I learned from Bob Jones.
 I remember hearing that Bob would have five dreams a night
 or five encounters a night.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And I remember saying, Lord, I don't even have one.
 And the Lord reminded me you do not have
 'cause you do not ask.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So I started asking and I started having.
 And I wanna encourage you that if you will pray,
 and we're gonna pray for you in a second,
 if you will pray, if you will make time
 and just say, God, I'm so, not just open.
 Openness is indifference.
 Be hungry, like Lord, I want an encounter with you.
 Would you give me a prophetic encounter?
 Would you bring, make heaven a reality to me?
 Because heaven is real.
 We are seated with Christ in heavenly places.
 That says where we're seated right now.
 Heaven is a very real place,
 and it's gonna be your home.
 If you have a faith in Jesus,
 if you put your trust in Jesus,
 if he's forgiven you, you're sin,
 That's where you're going to end up.
 And the Holy Spirit would love to give you a down payment.
 He is the down payment of your salvation, but he would live to give you a down payment
 of what you're going to.
 Yeah.
 And I want to encourage you, let these stories excite you, hunger in you and ask for dreams,
 visions and encounters.
 Because again, I can't overstate how, how foreign, everything I've talked about sounded to me,
 how alien I thought it was reserved for Uber Christians.
 and it isn't, it's reserved for the kingdom of heaven,
 belongs to children such as these.
 If you will humble yourself, if you'll be like a child
 or you'll be open to having those experiences,
 I know he did it for me, he'll do it for you.
  </li><li>So I was also thinking like a lot of us
 have been told at some point or trained at some point
 that experience is bad.
  </li><li>Right, be deeply suspicious of it.
  </li><li>Deeply suspicious.
 And I just wanna remind us as believers,
 like the Bible is a book of experiences, that's what it is.
 And, you know, again, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
 today and forever.
 He has designed us for encounter
 and he does want to encounter us.
 If all of this is super new to you and you are like,
 I think I want that, but like,
 I haven't even been slain in the spirit
 or I haven't even been filled in the blank.
 My encouragement would be to the next time
 you're just having a time with the Lord
 to just again, get in that restful position
 and ask for it to come in peace
 and pay attention to what you feel.
 Like start paying attention to do you feel any tingling?
 Do you feel a weight?
 Do you feel, because that's how it starts is
 and counter starts by paying attention
 to what is happening to your body and around you
 and then saying yes to it.
 Like not rejecting it but going, okay.
  </li><li>Oh, you know, and also not being like,
 well, I think I feel a little wind or a little coldness,
 but it could be the air conditioner.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>You can do that later, but just engage with
 what you feel, whatever, because if you're asking
 the Holy Spirit to show up and bring His presence,
 He will come.
 So I just wanna say, you could start there.
  </li><li>Yeah, the other thing I wanna,
 the reason I was smirking when you were saying that
 is like how preposterous everything you're saying sounds.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Like I'm going back 20 years going,
 oh my gosh, you sound like a nutter.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And yet, I wish somebody had told me that
 because that would have helped me so much.
 Everything you said is absolutely true.
  </li><li>And it makes it a little scary.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>The other thing I wanna encourage you from is,
 there's a danger that we're telling stories
 that make it sounds like this happens to us,
 like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
 Thursday, Thursday, it's happened to us all the time.
 We're talking stories that have happened over 20 years.
 Like our normal everyday life is exactly the same
 as your normal everyday life.
 These stories punctuate that.
 Yes.
 And we were just talking with Chris here in the studio.
 We tend to tell stories that we have processed through.
 Like we were just talking about, there's a bunch of stuff.
 You know, you were saying,
 I tend to have most of my encounters in dreams.
 Yeah, the majority, I mean,
 I've had other kinds of encounters clearly.
 We've talked about them.
 But the majority of my encounters with the Lord are in dreams,
 are during inOr 
 visitations of the night.
 Or visitations of the night.
 And I've in the last probably couple of weeks
 been having what I would call wisdom encounters, which is a whole other thing where it feels
 like the spirit of wisdom will visit me and give me wisdom about a certain situation
 that I didn't ask for. I'll sit down with you and share what I have written, what I heard
 wisdom say. Yeah. And we'll both be like, Oh, my babe, that's amazing. Yeah. I'm not
 really a talk about again, I'm not trying to be mysterious or cryptic. Or I'm just saying,
 know, we like to, as a general rule of thumb, not tell test
 means we like to have like a good year, two years under our
 bell, or feel like release or permission to talk about those
 or even use them as as teachable moments. Yeah. So can you
 pray for our listeners? Oh, I prayed the last time. So now
 you're praying this time. Yeah. So let me pray for everybody.
 Father, I thank you that you are so good and you're so
 bountiful and you are in your very nature revelatory in your very nature
 you're wise and your very nature you're loving and to encounter any of those
 things is to encounter you and so I ask in the name of Jesus and by the power of
 the Holy Spirit that as our listeners are listening or do you would put a deposit
 into their life of the supernatural that they would have their own test movies
 their own stories Lord I look back in amazement with all of my prejudice with
 all my left brain structure with all my unbelief, with all of my doubt, you still broke through
 and visited me in powerful ways. And I'm asking you would do the same for our listeners that
 you would use this for your glory to strengthen their faith, to encourage them and to lead
 them into great encounters with the Holy Spirit. Thank you.
 And I ask that in Jesus name. Amen. Amen.
 We have a listening question. And if you want to submit a listener's question, if you
 You want to ask us a question and we answer on air, go to Allen and AJ.com/ask.
 But do you remember what the question was or did I need to bring up my phone?
 You're going to have to bring out your phone.
 Have I seen the question?
 I talked to you about it last night.
 It's from a certain pastor's wife who wanted to remain anonymous.
 How can you have friends with people in the church?
 Oh, that one.
 Yeah, asking the question, AJ Jones.
 Well, we got an anonymous question asking if it's okay to be friends with people that
 you pastor.
 Yeah.
 passes or let me read the question. Let me do it properly.
 Yeah, just just get out that phone and.
 Okay. So they said, I'm a pastor's wife and some of my
 pastor wife friends say that you shouldn't be friends with
 people in your church as a leader. I think they're mostly
 speaking from her from past experiences where people have
 left the church or done worse as they're leaving. What's your
 opinion?
 Idi Jones, what's your opinion?
 My opinion is yes, you can be friends with people that you
 pastor. In fact, the almost all of my friends are people that,
 you know, that we passed or are, you know, spiritually responsible for
 they're in our church and they're great friends.
 So I, you know, here's my one caveat.
 I would say, yes, you don't decide whether you're going to be friends
 with people based on whether in your church or not.
 No, you decide whether they're going to be friends on whether it's a healthy
 relationship or not.
 Right.
 So I'm not saying great sense.
 Perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but we have a fairly robust,
 healthy culture about interpersonal dynamics, about boundaries, about
 brave communication, about powerful communication, about inner healing.
 Yeah.
 When you are in that pool and you work on your stuff, you become safe,
 vulnerable people to be friends with.
 Yes.
 So I don't think the rubric or the, you know, deciding factor should be
 or even make sure it's or you know, it's like, are you, you know, is this a
 good match for you guys?
 Are you healthy and spiritual?
 Yeah.
 You've got friends who were, you tell me yesterday who were in San
 I have friends who in seminary were trained, do not be friends with people in your church.
 Like it's not safe and don't ever show your weaknesses and all that kind of stuff.
 And it just makes me sad. I can't imagine doing life like that.
 We will have a podcast if we can talk about our weaknesses.
 Well, our whole church wouldn't exist if we couldn't talk about it.
 So yeah, I have great friends that go to our church.
 I have great friends that don't go to our church.
 And that's not how I choose friends.
  </li><li>Yeah. - So.
  </li><li>So look for health, follow favor, build friendships.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Good.
  </li><li>Well, they're in your church rather than so.
  </li><li>So good. - All right.
