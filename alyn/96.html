<p> I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is, keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones, how the heck are you?<br/>
 Sick.<br/>
 [laughs]<br/>
 Tell us what's going on with AJ.<br/>
 Well, I have a sinus infection that's now taking over my ears and eyes.
 Didn't the doctor say that your sinus infection is trying to eke out of every orifice in your
 face?<br/>
 that, you know? So I was like, oh, that's charming.
 Is that why you woke up this morning with one eye glued shut with eye
 goop? Yes. If you've just joined us, welcome.
 It was so gross. I was like, what the heck is going on?
 They're like, oh, yeah, that's just your sign of infection coming
 out through your tear ducts. I'm like, gorgeous. So I'm now on
 some really strong antibiotics. I had said to them, they're like,
 how do antibiotics work on you? And I said, well, the, you know,
 lighter ones don't usually work, but a Z pack or something like that might work and she goes,
 "Oh, we're going to need something stronger than that." And I was like, "Oh."
 So you've been sick for five days. You've been in bed for three of those days.
 I've been sick for, yeah, six days.<br/>
 Talk to me about what happens on the two days that you think, "No, I'm fine. I can be true."
 I get in the morning and I think I have a shower and I think, "Oh, I think I'm okay. I just feel
 like the dried out feeling like after a cold. But then by the time we get to like four or five at
 night, I feel like I've been run over by a Mac truck. And then the next day I can't get out of bed.
 And it's probably good to point out that you consistently ignore my
 Harvard medical training. And you just don't listen to anything I say.
 Could you produce proof of your Harvard medical training?
 And that's what our marriage has come to. You want proof that I went to medical school?
 Yes. I also want proof that you were in the Marines and the number of other things that you claim.
 I have never ever claimed to be in the Marines.
 No way.<br/>
 Yes you have.<br/>
 Okay, special forces.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Oh, so baby, we have to be gentle with you tonight because you're not feeling well and
 you're sniffing at the microphone.<br/>
 She's going to be at the light.<br/>
 I'm so sorry, people's.<br/>
 It's all right.<br/>
 I'll cut out.<br/>
 Wait, does my voice sound like I'm getting sick?
 I'm not getting sick.<br/>
 No, you're not getting sick.<br/>
 We've been in separate bedrooms.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 It's the only time I'm thankful that we can do that.
 The only time?<br/>
 I like it when you're sleeping in the same bed.
 Yeah, that's what.<br/>
 Except when you snore, that I'm less thankful.
 All right, let's move on for our weird body things.
 So this week was the last of our slowdown schedule.
 All of our students have come back from around the world.
 Welcome back everybody.<br/>
 And tomorrow we get to go into the school or you don't because you're contagious.
 So you stay home.<br/>
 But I get to go in and we all get to hear the stories of what they did while they're on outreach.
 So a super private and we just got great reports from churches from around the world.
 Can you periscope me in?<br/>
 Sure, I won't do that.<br/>
 Absolutely.<br/>
 Somebody else.<br/>
 Well, it means I have to hold my phone up and then I'll get armed fatigue.
 So we need a periscope intern.<br/>
 Our kids run spring break this week, which meant they got to watch us work.
 Well, and maybe sick.<br/>
 So poor, poor little guys at the door tonight, you know, you were trying to.
 return to say good night and and they kept saying I have a cuddle I have a cuddle
 I was like baby I'm sorry I can't go to you till Tuesday.
 I gave the kids two cuddles tonight one for me and one me pretending to be you.
 But apparently I don't do a good mommy impersonation.
 We'll go ahead and do mommy impersonation.
 What did you what did you say?<br/>
 Well I just said the same things I normally say to them but in a high pitch voice.
 Oh, because my voice is so high pitched.
 I was doing my best baby.<br/>
 I was doing my best.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Well at least it maybe had some humor value.
 It's worth doing a shout out at the beginning of this episode.
 For those of you who were listening last week, you remember, I just had the most frustrating time ever recording our podcast for whatever reason are
 really nice and really helpful and normally flawless podcast equipment just
 just died basically and it was way outside of my
 technical knowledge to know how to fix it. So I want to thank Jonathan Zias and Aaron Smith,
 both who came over and spent countless hours. I mean, on one night, we didn't go home till
 about 1.30 trying to work through everything that tech support suggested. I was also thankful
 in that night for separate beds. Yeah. Yeah. But we'll see how it goes, but I think we've got it
 sussed. So Jonathan and Aaron, thank you so much for giving up your time to make this work.
 Thank you for restoring my husband's sanity. I guess the most important thing we need to talk
 talk about Bibb with new iPhones and new iPads got launched this week. Do either interest
 you?<br/>
 That's the most important thing that we have to talk about this week.
 Yeah, can you think of anything more pressing?
 Well, today's Resurrection Sunday.<br/>
 Right. Well, put in context the resurrection of our Savior. The most significant news in
 Apple is FBI delayed their case against Apple. I'm not sure if they've dropped it. We'll
 But Apple introduced new phones and new iPads. Do either of those interest you?
 No, because I have a phone and a night pad. I know but do you like the smaller phone or are you happy with the phone?
 No, I'm keeping my phone. No, right very good. I like my phone. And yes, resurrection Sunday today. Yeah, which is amazing
 It's very good. I don't know how you talk about that. Well, I crying
 Do you want to tell the people where we're going the first weekend of June? We are going to Iceland and how excited you on a scale of one to ten
 84. Okay, your voice belies the fact that actually you are wildly excited. I am wildly sick right now as well. So no, no, I know I know I was
 Sorry, I shouldn't poke fun at your expense. You're doing very well. Thanks
 We're just going to throw that microphone away because it will never be disinfected. It'll be fine. Okay, germs only last on surfaces for eight hours
 Oh, great. Well, we only podcast once a week. So it should be fine. Yeah
 So we're going to Iceland.<br/>
 We're going to Iceland.<br/>
 And we're super excited.<br/>
 We can't wait to see all our friends and family and loved ones in Iceland.
 We haven't been there since when.<br/>
 Uh, well, we had Tia there.<br/>
 So we must have been there in.<br/>
 Oh, she was tiny.<br/>
 So I guess about 2009 late, 2009.<br/>
 So what's that five years or six, depending on, you know, your math.
 You know what, my mind passes filled with other things other than abacus is to be able
 to do mental arithmetic.<br/>
 Maybe even six and almost a half.<br/>
 But you know, it's like, I think I'm traumatized.
 I think I'm traumatized from the last time we were in Iceland because we went to a public
 swimming pool.<br/>
 We did.<br/>
 Well, there was many pools and they're awesome because it was the middle of winter and it's
 all geothermal is boiling hot water. But I didn't bring anything to wear. And so, like, no,
 it's fine. You can just rent it there. I was like, oh, okay. So gross. It really gross. But what
 they ended up giving me was a black speedo. And it was probably like a medium. And I'm like,
 not a medium. Yeah. And it was just horrifying. Yeah. I was, I need an RTF about that.
 It was kind of funny, actually. But it's a whole different scenario over there with that
 public bathing. We mentioned last week we were going to talk about the diet that we've been on.
 To be honest, we should probably have Dr. Ronson, our good friend and our family
 chiropractor. He should probably come on in the next couple of weeks and maybe correct anything
 we say that's wrong. Let's start with our weight loss so far. Because this coming week, we transition
 into maintenance from losing. By Tuesday, we'll have done 40 days. On day 37, I've lost 40 pounds.
 which will make sense to Americans 18 kilograms for anybody in Australia or a metric nation.
 Is Canada kilograms or? Yes.<br/>
 Do we do pounds when we're in Canada or? You can do either.
 Well, that's nearly three stone for the British people.
 That's amazing. What have you lost? 23 pounds.
 Which is also not to be sniffed at. Yeah, it's not quite as fantastic as 40, but women do lose slower.
 And to be fair, I had way more to lose the new did.
 Wait, hang on.<br/>
 Really?<br/>
 We're just going to come up with it.<br/>
 No, it is true.<br/>
 It is true.<br/>
 So the question everybody asks is, aren't you worried that you're going to put it back on again?
 No.<br/>
 And why are you not worried that we're going to put it back on again?
 Because there's a very specific way that you come off of it.
 Right.<br/>
 And it's all like monitored and we weigh in once a week at the chiropractor office.
 And is that why I put all the chocolate that the team UK brought me back into a time capsule?
 to be opened in about twenty years.<br/>
 Because it's too much of a temptation.
 Baby, they brought me milk bottles back.
 Those are horrible.<br/>
 I have no idea why you like milk.<br/>
 But just right now you're making baby Jesus cry.
 No, I'm not.<br/>
 Milk bottles.<br/>
 Jesus is saying you're right.<br/>
 They're horrible.<br/>
 They're amazing.<br/>
 No. OK.<br/>
 They're like chewy, nasty, chalky, sweet things.
 It's like eating sweet chalk.<br/>
 It's disgusting.<br/>
 OK, whatever, Poutine.<br/>
 I make Poutine all the time.<br/>
 And that's totally valid.<br/>
 Wait, and I make milk bottles.<br/>
 Have you ever seen me eat poutine?<br/>
 No, right.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I felt like you were attacking the candy of my national identity.
 And so I lashed out.<br/>
 Milk bottles is the candy of your natural, your national identity.
 Maybe milk bottles and a can of iron brew was my lunch.
 Many a time.<br/>
 I'll give you, but your mother let you just do that for lunch here.
 My mother didn't know she would give me money.
 She'd give me lunch money.<br/>
 And in my first year of high school, I would buy a white bread roll, a packet of pickled
 onion, monster munch.<br/>
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 Oh my gosh.<br/>
 Put the monster munch as a sandwich filling in the white roll, white bread roll.
 Eat that and have a cabry cremech and maybe a Turkish delight.
 So absolutely no nutrition involved in any single thing that you ate.
 It tasted so good.<br/>
 And you wash it down with either.<br/>
 Monster munch is also disgusting.<br/>
 You know, it's amazing that we've remained married all these years.
 You notice how you don't actually get to eat monster munching milk bottles very
 right.<br/>
 And that's why I'm winning.<br/>
 That's why they're special.<br/>
 Well, the whole maintenance thing is for the next 30 days, we have to wear ourselves
 every day and we're not allowed to go above or below by two pounds.
 The weight that we finished the losing phase at.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So I'm hoping to just get a little over 40 pounds lost.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So the question that everybody asks is, how does it work?
 It's really simple.<br/>
 It's crystal math.<br/>
 You have tons of energy and she dropped away like no business.
 That's not funny.<br/>
 But you also lose track of time.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And your children, I'm sure.<br/>
 No, there are no narcotics at all.<br/>
 Do you want to explain to protocol?<br/>
 It's like you take this herbal green tea.
 Well, start with a tack because that's a cool part.
 What's the tack?<br/>
 Oh, you weigh in on this scale that tells you how much your bones
 way on their own, your muscle would weigh on your fat would weigh on your own, your visceral fat,
 which is like the fat around your organs. That's a more dangerous fat, that kind of stuff. So,
 tells you all that stuff. It also gives you a metabolic age. It does give you a lot of money.
 How old your body is telling, based on the facts of your weigh-in, it estimates that your age is,
 like, I was 56 years old. Yeah. That's encouraging. Yeah. I was 39. You were 59. I know, but it sounds
 better. You're older than me. Well, I am older than you by three years. Okay. You're 59 year old
 grandmother. Oh, shut up. So then you do this scanning thing that scans for 2,500 markers.
 These biomarkers, I don't quite understand how it works. That's why we need Dr. Ronston.
 Yeah, we do. But basically, once you've weighed yourself initially, and once you've done this
 biomarker scan. They custom calibrate a bunch of weight loss supplements and
 pictures and minerals. Only one of mine tasted disgusting.
 What a mine tasted disgusting and it was different from your one.
 The one of mine. But the rest of them tasted fine.
 Yes, definitely.<br/>
 And the pills were in pills.<br/>
 And then you would take basically these pills that looked like they were just made out of
 green tea and some other stuff.<br/>
 Yeah, I don't really know what was in them, but they're supposed to boost your metabolism and tell your metabolism to find your fat and eat it.
 You're stored fat.<br/>
 You're stored fat.<br/>
 No, you're structural fat.<br/>
 Yeah, both.<br/>
 Oh, I see this is again why we need Dr. Ronzen.
 I just do the same thing.<br/>
 Start fat and structural fat.<br/>
 Anyway, you're not allowed to.<br/>
 Harvard Medical.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 You don't need any oils or butters because they don't want your that being what your body focuses on eating.
 and they want it to not just you can't eat oils.
 You can't use any personal care products with oils in them.
 So we are better.<br/>
 With new shampoo, new conditioner, new shaving foam,
 new deodorant, new toothpaste, new face wash, all of it, oily free.
 Yes.<br/>
 And so, but I like the smell of the shampoo.
 It smells like Mars, a band.<br/>
 It does smell like Mars.<br/>
 So it feels like I'm in a fondant factory every morning.
 Bonding also one of the personal items that we've got smells like Cadbury cream eggs. Yes. Thank you for bringing that up. I love it. I'm like
 So good, but anyway, so every day<br/>
 You are burning<br/>
 Well, here's a fact for you. It takes about 3,500 calories to burn a pound of fat right so on average
 My body is probably consuming about 5,000 calories a day.
 But I'm only feeding my body about 550 calories.
 And so you're like, "Well, Alan, where did the extra 4,500 calories come from?"
 Or 4,450 calories come from.<br/>
 See that mental arithmetic?<br/>
 Just like, "Wow, amazing."<br/>
 That was MIT math.<br/>
 So, yeah, you're eating 550 calories of food a day.
 And the rest of your calories is coming from this green tea that's telling your fat to burn,
 which is why to begin with, I was losing about two pounds a day, one and a half to two pounds a day.
 And I have now metabolized down to about, towards the end I'm losing about half a pound a day.
 Yeah, which is more like what I lose.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 The biggest thing that we've done, I mean, apart from changing how many calories we're eating,
 which no, you're not typically hungry. The first three to five days you want to punch a baby seal
 because you're so angry and frustrated.
 And you're detoxing, yeah.<br/>
 But after that, you're not hungry at all, really.
 No.<br/>
 Except for if you get regimented when you're eating
 and when you get close to that, you feel a bit hungry.
 But--<br/>
 Even then, though, I'm not starving.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 The biggest change, I guess, is we're eating fish every single day.
 Every day.<br/>
 And what have you thought about fish?<br/>
 I like God and halibut.<br/>
 Halibut's got the worst name ever.<br/>
 If I'm reading a menu and they're like, would you like some halibut?
 I'd be like, no, it sounds gross, but it's super tasty.
 It's yummy.<br/>
 And I like sea bass.<br/>
 I'm no longer a mojima even.<br/>
 You were.<br/>
 I was, but I can't figure out how to cook it in such a way that I actually enjoy it.
 Cod is good.<br/>
 Cod is great.<br/>
 If you just tuned in, this is the fish we like weekly pod.
 So we figured out how to both grill it and steam it and bake it.
 So we're eating so much fish that I'm building my cooking repertoire.
 But I'd like to keep the amount of fish we eat in our diet.
 Yeah, I think it's probably a good idea.
 But you've been enjoying it?<br/>
 Yeah. I'm bored.<br/>
 Well, that's because you can't season it with anything.
 Yeah. I think if we could just pan sear that cod with an a little bit of butter
 shut up.<br/>
 Good crispy.<br/>
 OK. Yeah.<br/>
 Soon and very soon Friday we can have butter.
 Butter.<br/>
 All right, none of that was the topic that we're talking about.
 We'll get Dr. Ronson on.<br/>
 We'll also measure ourselves because not only did we wear ourselves, but we took blood
 pressure readings, we took our waist, hips, all of our inches.
 That'll be in residency and we'll check back in and tell you anything more about
 fish that we remember.<br/>
 But you remember on Sunday, Ben hadn't seen you in a few weeks and he said to
 Sonia, where did half of Alan go?<br/>
 Cause you look so different.<br/>
 Well, it's funny because our students have been away for three weeks.
 So they haven't seen me in three weeks.
 So tomorrow will be really fun.<br/>
 And so yeah, and some stuff.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Half of us vanished.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 An enormous amount.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Our topic for this week is dreaming with God.
 Okay.<br/>
 I've been thinking a lot about this whole thing about vision.
 When our friends, Alex and Henry Sealy, you know what?
 We should have them on the podcast.<br/>
 We should.<br/>
 They're so amazing.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 When our friends Alex and Henry Sealy, who passed with the belonging here in Nashville,
 they came and taught on our school.<br/>
 And I think it was Alex who said vision gives pain a purpose.
 And I just thought, unless you know what you're living for, you're going to get
 super frustrated when life inevitably goes through one of those seasons where
 it's less than comfortable.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And so having a vision, having a confidence of what God's called you to
 makes everything worth it.<br/>
 And you can actually coast in joy.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I think the joy that we found to rest in, tell me if you agree with this, is learning
 that everything that we are granted from God comes by inheritance.
 So it's not by us working or trying to make it work.
 It's just us partnering with God.<br/>
 And even if we do all wrong, he's still so good that he'll bring around his plan.
 Yeah, but I think it's also being faithful in the thing that's in front of you.
 Undoubtedly.<br/>
 But I think this time where how many of you listen to this are aware of the fact that although God's never late, he misses plenty of opportunities to be early.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So typically his time schedule and our time schedule are two different things.
 Yes.<br/>
 The same person who said I'm coming very soon as the same person said that day is like a thousand years.
 So what was my point?<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 I was mystical.<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 I went off into my mind palace.<br/>
 All right.<br/>
 Here's some thoughts for you.<br/>
 I've got seven things.<br/>
 that I think is super important when dreaming with God.
 Okay.<br/>
 Number one.<br/>
 Well, I'm not even going to go on number one.
 This is a bonus one for free.<br/>
 Oh, so eight things?<br/>
 No, this is just an introduction.<br/>
 It's not even a point.<br/>
 It's just an observation.<br/>
 I'm so excited.<br/>
 I mean, being as you've been to both MIT and Harvard, I should be so excited and the
 Special Forces.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 God is a plan.<br/>
 We know that.<br/>
 Jeremiah 29 verse 11.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 on of life is actually discovering what that plan is. And it's worth knowing that God being
 a creative genius doesn't take you from where you are now to where he wants you to go, or A to B,
 so to speak, because B would scare the living daylights out of us and we'd be like, no, I want to
 stay in A. So what he does is he does A to Z or Z. And the other 24 letters in between that are
 these brilliant twists and turns of the scenic route or route of getting to where God's taking
 you. Okay. You are so tired. I'm so tired. I'm really sorry. You're doing amazing. You
 know what? I can't breathe out of my nose. Okay, we'll just keep your mouth open. I
 can mute you. It's fine. Okay. All right. So number one, and this is so well, they're
 all vital, but number one is, it's so important to surrender everything to God. It's going
 to be a slow ride if you're constantly looking backwards at the thing that you're leaving
 behind. So it's just smart to give everything to God. I remember I had this amazing job opportunity
 and it was everything I wanted. It was a large software company. It offered me this job and I was
 so wanting to take it. But at the same time, I heard a word from the Lord not to take it.
 And I felt like I had one foot on the shore and one foot on this boat that was leaving.
 And God was like, son, you just need to make up your mind what you want to do.
 And here's what I learned is if you if what you want so badly is actually him he'll resurrect whatever you lay down anyway.
 And if it isn't him I guarantee you what is planned for you to be infinitely better.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So in my world I desperately wanted to be this software systems engineer genius.
 And I died to that now my love of nerdy tech gadgetry hasn't gone anywhere.
 but now I get to you know it's just funny the right the gods taking me and now end up this place where part of the my job is to design systems of people rather than systems of computer.
 You still do a lot of computer and techie things I do but.
 Not the same yeah not the same kind but so here's the thing sacrifices never fun but the resurrection is always glorious so get good at dying because god what god resurrects is better than what you had in the first place.
 Yeah, I agree. All right. Number two. Okay. So number two, I would say that you want to ask him
 for prophetic dreams, prophetic words, visions, that kind of stuff, and then collect them and
 don't despise your small words or your small beginnings. It's okay if they don't make sense.
 When you get them, I would say I've had lots of words that I was like, gosh, I have no idea
 what they're talking about. Right. And then you look back in hindsight and you're like, oh,
 that was totally right on. So collect them and pray over them and just sort of honor them. Don't
 despise them. Well, it's also that thing that God calls things that are not as though they are.
 Yeah. So you get, whenever he's speaking prophetically, he's speaking into what he's creating.
 So oftentimes he's speaking, like I remember Ivan Isabel, two of our favorite prophets in the
 whole world gave us a prophetic word. And I mean, every time they've prophesied over us,
 because they prophesy destiny words. They prophesy in the future. And I was like,
 "Some prophets, you guys are. You totally missed it. Little did I know that they were foretelling
 everything that we were going to step into." Yeah, if you look back on the stuff that they've
 said over you 10 years down the road, you're like, "Oh, yeah, totally nailed it." But the time
 didn't make a whole lot of sense. All right. Number three and four,
 we might get into trouble for saying. So forgive us if we say it wrong, and hopefully our hearts
 come through. I won't get in trouble because I'm cute and sick and so they'll give me some grace.
 All right, they'll just go after the bearded one. Yes. All right, number three,
 immerse yourself in a culture that supports your prophetic words. What I mean by that is what you
 listen to, what you read, what you watch, all feeds your thoughts. And if you have toxic thoughts,
 you produce toxic fruit. But if you're, and this is what I learned, even if you're feeding yourself
 on good fruit. If you're in a culture that's different to the fruit you're feeding from,
 people will try and convince you that the fruit that you're eating is spoiled.
 That's a terrible analogy. What I mean by that is, evangelicalism, and I would absolutely count
 myself as an evangelical, but evangelicalism is mostly a culture of doubt.
 So imagine me raised as a skeptical, doubt-filled evangelical, trying to step into new things that
 are outside of my frame of reference that the Holy Spirit is leading me into.
 And I am surrounded by people who don't actually believe that it's right or true or scriptural.
</p><ul>
  <li>Hey. - It's really hard to take off
 if everyone around you is saying you can't fly.
  </li><li>Yeah. - So it's important that you consider
 where you are, who you're with, and what you're feeding yourself with, because you could be
 terminating the dreams before they ever hatch in life. Oh, for sure. For example, I mean,
 all the prophetic words that the Lord gave me, before I ever got a prophetic word, just privately
 that He gave me, I just thought, if anybody in my culture heard these, did think I'm on drugs.
 But in the culture that we live in in Grace, I don't know, nobody would be freaked out by those
 words. So I think that's why you remember when the Lord comes to Mary or when the angel comes
 to Mary and says, "Hey, you're going to be pregnant." It says that she just shared it with her cousin,
 who has also had a similar supernatural experience. What I learned out with that is you can automatically
 share everything that God's doing in your life. It's best to find people that God's doing something
 similar with, otherwise if it's outside of the grid or the frame of reference, you could be in
 danger of casting your prose before swine.
 And I think, yeah, I mean, I get what you're saying in terms of swine, but I think it's
 probably fear.
 You know, people get freaked out by anything they don't understand.
 Sure.
 And so they'll want to protect you from the thing that they don't understand that you're
 experiencing.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And that wasn't exclusively my experience I should add.
 Yeah.
 But I did experience a fair share of that.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Number four, can't overstate the importance of this.
 leaders you love and submit to them. I am aware that that sounds kind of self-serving
 given we're leaders, but I've settled in my heart that the vast majority of our listeners
 actually have no opportunity to submit to us. They're in other countries. So I feel okay
 sharing that. And actually, I share that in our culture too, because people get to hear
 my heart more.
 And actually, we love that. So we're not asking anybody to do something we don't do.
 Right. But if people have had bad experience with leaders, what I just said sounds an
 incredibly controlling statement.
 Sure. But actually, most of the Bible could be twisted to sound controlling.
 Okay. Right. But what I'm doing, I mean, you can look at what Jesus tells you to do as,
 "Oh my gosh, you're so controlling." That's rules.
 Oh, I'm not under the Old Testament. But actually, everything Jesus asks you to do is
 for your own benefit and for life-giving. Right.
 But what I've found is you only have as much authority as you choose to submit to.
 And it's much easier to get things done with godly authority than with human influence.
 Oh, for sure.
 So when God anoints you with authority, you find an acceleration, but you're only going
 to have authority to the degree that you submit to authority.
 Now, it's important, and I'm sure everybody understands because we talk about these guys
 a lot, but the leaders we've had have been just incredible.
 Yes, outstanding.
 So John and Carol and Jeff and Becky, but even when I was back in Scotland, I was thinking
 about this, I had a group of leaders in my evangelical church, a group of elders, I think
 with seven of them, super godly men.
 I would imagine it would be fair to say, but I didn't know them all well enough to make
 the statement universally.
 But I would imagine that a lot of the things that the Holy Spirit was doing in my heart
 may have been outside of either their theological grid or perhaps their experience.
 Okay.
 So here's the story.
 When I felt like the Lord asked me to move to Toronto, you got to remember that Toronto,
 I mean, we're so comfortable with Toronto now.
 But at the time, Toronto was one of the most divisive things in the body of Christ, half
 of the body Christ, for what the Holy Spirit is doing in Toronto, half of the body Christ
 saying this is just terrible.
 It was a charismatic hotspot.
 So here I am in a conservative evangelical brethren assembly and I feel like God telling
 me or I feel like God is inviting me to go to charismatic HQ.
 And I said to the Lord, I'm believing this is you.
 And one of the ways I'm going to ask for confirmation is that you give me a blessing from my elders.
 So I meet with the elders and I kind of come out of the charismatic closet.
 Just say, this has been my experiences.
 You know, I've met the Holy Spirit.
 You know, I, and I, as best I could just explain to my process of encountering the Holy Spirit,
 happened, how I got healed, how I hear the voice of God, you know, how, you know, dreams,
 and I forget what I shared, but I must have sped talk for about 45 minutes at an elders
 meeting. And at the end of it, these men just said, Alan, some of what you shared is outside
 of our grid. And we can't actually tell you whether God is telling you to move to Toronto
 or not to move to Toronto. But what we can tell you is we've watched your life for the last six,
 seven, eight years. And we know that you love the Lord and we know that you hear his voice.
 And so we're confident to say, if you believe that God is telling you to go, then we believe.
 Which is just incredible.
 It's amazing.
 Just the wisdom and the God, the maturity of those leaders.
 So there would be leaders who might not necessarily on the surface agree with what I feel like God
 saying, but I still wanted to yield myself to them and submit to them. And I just think submission
 propels you forward. Yeah. We are where we are. See if you agree with this, because we found leaders
 to follow and prioritize their vision over our vision. Yeah. And even like, when I think I've told
 this story before as well, but even their vision for our lives at times.
 Like, for example, I didn't... The only reason I started traveling and speaking was because John
 was like, "I see this on you, do you trust me?" You know, not because I wanted to,
 not even because I think I could, but just, "Okay, John, if you see this and I trust you and I submit
 to you, okay, I'll go do it." And that's actually how I found what's life to me.
 No, incredible. I don't know if you've taught about this on the podcast, but one of the things
 God gives your leaders is the ability to see things in your life and seed form,
 both good and bad. Your leaders in your life, God gives them insight into your lives where
 they see the good that's just beginning to form in your life and they call you to life, but they
 can also see some of the stuff that is perhaps going to trip you up. And it's important that
 that you listen to both the good and the bad because they have a perspective that you don't.
 We've benefited from that so many times when our leaders have sat us down.
 Just last week I had coffee with Jeff and Jeff was like, "Ellen, I love you.
 Here's this thing I'm worried about." His words are big in my ears.
 I'm like, "All right. I don't necessarily see that or maybe even agree with that,
 but I'm going to choose to prioritize your opinion over my opinion because you have a different perspective than me."
 Because I say, we always think we're right.
 Yeah.
 As Jeff would love to say, how would you know if you're wrong?
 Right.
 And God gives you leaders.
 Yeah, it's really good.
 Number five, give away everything you have.
 So that just means stuff like teach what you know, practice the little that you have,
 or maybe the lot that you have.
 You only get to keep that which you give away.
 So, serve in the small places, take the opportunities that you have to give away in the small places,
 because if you're too big to serve, then you're also too small to lead.
 So, it's a choice when it doesn't look like, "Wow, that's not as big and shiny as I'd like it to be."
 Well, are you going to choose to serve and use the gifts that you have now,
 because that's actually what opens doors later on.
 My international ministry started at Marinathicamp.
 It was a nice other videos.
 It was a camp that some of my leaders said, we think you could teach and I was like, huh,
 not sure I'm even good with kids.
 And they saw something to me.
 And not just my leaders, but even the peers, the people around me, encouraged me to do it.
 And I still got some of the teachings on my laptop.
 And in fact, one of the teachings we do at the school is a reworking of that teaching
 that I prepare.
 I don't know how long ago it was.
 So yeah, don't be afraid to start small.
 In fact, everything God does typically starts smaller than growth.
 Think about the kingdom of heaven.
 It's as tiny as a mustard seed.
 And then, and then to the hate.
 Is that where you did that video of you in an angel outfit?
 Or was that for Bellevue?
 That was for Bellevue.
 In fact, I should dig out that my first ever children's second ever children's talk.
 My first children's talk was, I think I made a cake.
 Okay.
 Of course.
 It was that what you do with the brethren.
 Listen, never knock the brethren.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm not.
 My second video would not be possible without my very good friend, Glenn Carter.
 I should dig out that video of me in an angel costume pretending to be double
 O'Heaven.
 I was sick as a dog the day I did it.
 Oh, my gosh.
 Kind of like me right now.
 Oh, yeah, it was just miserable.
 But anyway, I digress.
 Number six, revisit your prophetic words and ask God for a bigger vision.
 Here's the thing.
 There's no limitation with God.
 Any limitation in the vision that God gives you is purely our end because he's the God of the universe.
 You know, the scope of our vision is now and maybe five years.
 The scope of God's vision is eternity.
 Yeah.
 And usually what I found is God gives me the smallest piece my brain can understand that this still requires faith to reach.
 And when I get to that point, it's a bit like when I used to climb mountains for a living.
 You know, there's these things called false summits and you think, oh, I'm almost there.
 and then you get there and you're like, "Tada!"
  </li><li>Oh. - Sorry, can we back up?
 Did you just say a bit like when you used
 to climb mountains for a living?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Was that before MIT or after Harvard?
  </li><li>Yeah, well, I don't want to talk about my check
 or test rate. - Okay, yeah.
  </li><li>Let's go the last one.
 Take us home, baby.
 Number seven.
  </li><li>Practice patience is number seven, so.
  </li><li>I hate patience.
  </li><li>I know nobody really likes it,
 but all I have to say is if you pray in tongues,
 there's a good chance you're praying for patience
 'cause nobody's actually gonna pray for it themselves.
 So I think the Holy Spirit makes us do it.
 Right.
 That's just a thought.
 And all the scripture after this is, "Wait patiently on the Lord."
 Yes.
 You know, you're going to be waiting and it'd be good if you're a patient.
 Yeah, for sure.
 I think for certain longing is one of the hardest things to steward.
 Oh my gosh.
 When there's something that's deep in your heart that you're just like, "Oh gosh, I
 so want this."
 It's just really hard.
 But I think thankfulness is what will keep us in expectation and from turning to entire
 I don't think it's something uglier than entitlement.
 No.
 So be thankful, love what you have right now, and stay excited for what's coming.
 I was also thinking babe, because I'm sick, I've been watching a lot of Undercover Boss.
 Have you watched Undercover Boss before?
 Well, I have because you've made me.
 It's very cool.
 I really like it.
 I know you're doing.
 But what are my favorite shows?
 Are the ones where?
 Did you just clack like a duck?
 I think the machine did.
 My favorite shows are the ones where the boss will sit down with somebody who has a lot of promise and just help them make a plan for how they head forward.
 So a lot of them are like, oh, they're the guy at RBS or whatever.
 That's just flipping burgers, but they have a lot of energy and they have a lot of work ethic or whatever.
 And so the president will say, hey, I want you to meet with my VP and they're going to help you make a plan for how you could actually work up through the company.
 And they just sort of, it's somebody who's a little bit further ahead giving them wisdom and saying, hey, keep a great attitude.
 And it's usually the ones that have a great attitude that they do this for.
 It's not everybody.
 Right.
 But it just makes me think there's probably something to that as well.
 Like, you know, when you're in the midst of being thankful, keep your great attitude.
 And if there is people around you that you could talk to that are where you want to be,
 but a little bit ahead, then start picking their brains if they're open to it.
 It's just a thought.
 Very good.
 Yeah.
