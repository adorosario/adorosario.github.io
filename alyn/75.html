<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hey baby.<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
 Guess what?<br/>
 Oh, what's that?<br/>
 It's episode 75.<br/>
 75 episodes of Keeping Up With Joneses.
 That's shocking.<br/>
 How was your week?<br/>
 It was a good week.<br/>
 You taught on spiritual parents.<br/>
 I did.<br/>
 How do I know that?<br/>
 Um, you were there.<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 And I too was teaching on spiritual parents.
 It's very true. You were.<br/>
 You did Monday, I did Tuesday.<br/>
 Yes. While you were busy on Monday teaching with spiritual parents, I stayed home because
 AT&amp;T came and visited and gave me an early Christmas present. Yes, they did.
 So I don't know if this is normal. I know it's not normal because there's only a couple of markets
 in the whole of the United States where we have what's called Gigabit internet.
 Which is? It's a thousand megabits a second up and down to your house.
 As opposed to what's the normal? I don't know what the normal is. We used to have 50 megabits.
 And that was fast. Well, yeah, it was fast. In the past, we've had 100 megabits, but it's
 extortionate. Google and AT&amp;T are kind of competing for new markets in America, where it's fiber
 to the house. So we have a fiber optic cable that goes from the side of our house to the backbone
 of AT&amp;T's internet. And as the marketing says, I should get about 1000 megabits down and 1000
 megabits up when we're wired to the router. Over Wi-Fi, it's obviously lower than that because
 Why is it a paltry 200 or something?<br/>
 It's a paltry 500.<br/>
 Oh, it's about 250 on your phone.<br/>
 It's about 500 on my laptop.<br/>
 OK, so obviously I'm super excited.<br/>
 I'm actually trying to come up with reasons to leave the house now.
 OK, well, we have a job.<br/>
 So that should help.<br/>
 I could just do my job at home.<br/>
 Sure.<br/>
 What else happened this week, babe?<br/>
 We had our friend Quinn come back to the United States.
 And he brought two friends with him.<br/>
 He did.<br/>
 Jackie and Heather.<br/>
 Welcome to America.<br/>
 Although, as we say this, you're on the flight back.
 Are they the gone already?<br/>
 Yeah, we didn't get to go by to them because we'd leave church to
 per early, but we did get to all go to the Lovelace Cafe.
 We did.<br/>
 And shock them.<br/>
 I don't think they were ready for American food.
 As in the portion sizes or the amount of deep pride.
 Well, consider that they'd never thought of having chicken and
 waffles for breakfast.<br/>
 Yes, that's probably the majority of the world.
 But nevertheless, they looked fairly shocked when that was a
 breakfast option.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 The jacket was brave. Yeah, she did take it. And it was great to see Quinn. And we,
 why would we have to love this? Oh, we went to the movies. We had a date.
 We had a date day. Yeah, we realized we hadn't had a day off in ages and
 sweets and they came and had took an MJ out on a date so that we could have a date day.
 And so what do we do? We went to the movie theater.
 We went to the movies and we saw Steve Jobs movie.
 We did. Thoughts?<br/>
 That was really good. It was really well done. I felt really sad afterwards.
 So die. Yeah. I was like, gosh, I've got a lot. I suppose I just thought he couldn't have been happy and that high strong.
 Well, the thing is, we really like Aaron Sorkin, the guy that wrote the screenplay. Yeah.
 He also wrote The West Wing, which is one of our favorite TV shows in studio 60 on the Sunset Street and the social network.
 Yeah. And newsroom. Yeah, a bunch of stuff that we really appreciate his writing. And so if you like Aaron Sorkin stuff, you'll like the movie.
 I read somewhere from somebody who knows more about Apple than I do that it was a great fictional
 story based on a real character. So that gave me hope that it wasn't or he wasn't as
 awful. And then I guess the thing that was the highlight of our week was the Heaven
 Declares conference that just finished last night. It was so good. The worship was outstanding.
 Yeah, it really was. We're so spoiled for incredible worship. It was absolutely phenomenal. Well done.
 Josh and Sarah and their team. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, it really didn't matter who led. It was just
 consistent. That's fantastic. So good. And the presence of God was wonderful.
 And then of course, having Supraisa and Brian Simmons. Amazing.
 So Brian Simmons has been translating the Bible, the New Testament he started with,
 from Aramaic into English. It's called the Passion Translation. It's a wonderful translation.
 we've really been enjoying reading it. And it was fascinating having him with us talking about
 the process of Bible translation, talking about the Hebrew and the Greek and the Aramaic languages
 and homonyms. And yeah, just fascinating. Listen to that whole sign. And then we had
 Pastor Saphraza and Pastor Francie all the way from South Africa with stories. I can't even begin
 to tell how radical they were. Yeah, it's hard to get your head around some of the stories that
 that they tell. It's like, okay.
</p><ul>
  <li>And then this morning,
 past the Sabraza spoke at Grace Center,
 and it was both services were excellent.
 If you were not able to attend the conference,
 if you go to heavendeclares.info,
 you can watch and you can get the MP3s
 from the teaching sessions.
 If you go to Grace Center's YouTube channel,
 you can watch this morning services
 and listen to worship.
 I mean, it was just absolutely incredible.
 Highly recommend that you do that.
  </li><li>One of the things that Pastor Sabraza said this weekend
 was that when you are afraid, what you are afraid of is not going to be afraid of you.
 And I thought, oh, that's really interesting. You know, his whole point was that everything
 should be afraid of the kingdom of God. You know, everything that isn't of the kingdom should be
 afraid. But if you are afraid of it, it won't be afraid of you.
 -Speaking of pastor's appraiser. -Yes.
 -And speaking of pastor Francie. -Yes.
 -How cool would it be if they were actually in the room right now?
 It would be so cool.
 And so we have a very special episode of keeping up the Joneses.
 We really do.
 Because we have friends all the way from South Africa.
 Yes.
 Hi listeners.
 My name is Surprise.
 Thank you so much for listening.
 Hi.
 It's by the front, speaking.
 Surprise.
 Yes.
 How many languages do you speak?
 17.
 17.
 Yeah.
 Dialects.
 Dialects.
 Yeah, but you also speak English, which isn't a dialect.
 Yes.
 Oh.
 And you got 15 of those supernaturally.
 Exactly.
 So, one day you didn't speak English and then one day the Holy Spirit visited you and you
 did speak English.
 Yes.
 Do you remember what that was like?
 Well, it was like my memoir, I thought I was speaking Portuguese and then, but it was
 on there of an interview and the guy that was giving me an interview for me to go to the
 Bible school and suddenly I was just starting English, speaking English.
 Wow. That's amazing.
 All right. So you speak 17 languages, 15 of which got given to you by the Holy Spirit.
 Can you tell us how you got saved, Surpracer?
 To make this story short, it was the voice that was calling in the middle of the night,
 which says, "Surprise, wake up. Live your village. If you don't live your village, you're going to die."
 Well, I woke up that night and then I went to the house of my friend Gaffar,
 been living in the village very remote villages.
 And my friend Gaffar, as soon as I told him, he said,
 he will be going with me wherever we go.
 Wow. Yes.
 And how old were you when this happened?
 I was 15 years old. Gaffar was 16.
 So you were asleep in your village.
 You had a dream?
 No, it was just a loud voice, it was calling.
  </li><li>An audible voice, an audible voice, yes, that woke me up.
  </li><li>And said, "Get up and leave."
  </li><li>Get up and leave.
  </li><li>And so where did you leave to?
  </li><li>Well, we were just walking on the trail
 and then suddenly the trail got lost
 and we were wandering in the jungle.
 We stayed in that jungle for two weeks.
 End of two weeks we appeared ourselves
 to another province called in Titt,
 a small town called Villanova.
 And on that village, there was a man, a other man,
 that he had a dream of two boys.
 And then the dream was, he was specifically told
 to go to a certain home, one of the sport,
 where he would meet us.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>Indeed, the next day he went to that sport,
 and he saw us.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>And then he collected us to his house.
  </li><li>That's amazing.
  </li><li>And he taught you about Jesus.
  </li><li>Was the man that he started explaining about Jesus.
  </li><li>So when the voice spoke to you,
 You didn't know it was Jesus, you didn't know it was God.
 What was your background?
 Oh, the background was my mother was with Dr. And also my father.
 So your mother and father were which doctors?
 Yes.
 You don't know anything about Jesus?
 I don't know anything about God.
 I don't know about creation.
 Nothing.
 Just what?
 But one thing that I knew was spirits.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Spirit is like no matter what type of spirit.
 But the spiritual realm I grew up doing about that.
 And so how far was the village that this man found you in from the village that you were raised in?
 Today, I looked at the map is impossible.
 It was God that transported us from that village to another village.
 What was it impossible?
 Was impossible because in between is our provinces in Zambesi province.
 And where we go to found is in Tethi province in between.
 There is a huge rivers.
 So on those rivers, you can't cross because there is a lot of crocodiles.
 And you never cross the river and we never cross the river.
 That's amazing.
 And if we could go to other province without crossing the river, it should take us baby
 about two years or three years going via Zambia and so cross to other side so that we
 can not cross the river.
 Wow.
 Yeah, it could not be a position of two weeks.
 And what happened?
 Like, why do you think the Lord asked you to leave your village?
 I think one of the point was he wanted me to save him, as I'm saving him now.
 And because when I left my village, my family got poisoned by the balof crocodile.
 The witches of the village, they took the balof crocodile and put it into the food
 and brought to my family, my family, my mother, my father, my sister, the age, the food and
 the diet.
 So your whole family was killed by other witch doctors?
 Well, some those that have been already married, they were out of their house.
 Okay.
 They are still alive, yes.
 But everybody who was there was they got killed.
 And you would have been killed.
 Had you not been obedient?
 Maybe I could be the first one, man.
 Wow.
 So you're 15 years old.
 You get introduced to Jesus.
 Yes.
 And what happens next?
 So next we stayed with two more weeks in the house of Mr. Lucas.
 And then from there we decided to go fed our trip and then we went to Malawi.
 His way the Lord is supernatural, gave him the Chichawa language of Malawi.
 That was your first language.
 That was my first supernatural language.
 Wow.
 Yeah, which is completely different to my mother language.
 Right.
 But the first day I thought it was my mother, I was speaking my mother language.
 the people who call here completely and is different.
 Here's an interesting question.
 What do you dream in?
 What language do you dream in?
 Oh, if God is communicating to certain people,
 I dream in that language.
 You dream in the language of the people he's
 speaking to people that is being a communicating to.
 When you think in your head and you count numbers, what language do you count in?
 Well, I mean, I count in English sometimes in Zulu.
 And sometimes in Portuguese and something like that.
 When did you meet Heidi in Rowland?
 I met Heidi in Rowland in 1985 at a place called Underbeck in Malaland, South Africa.
 She was coming from Indonesia to Mozambique to work with the orphanage day.
 So they haven't even started the orphanage yet?
 Or no, she stopped at that place where we are staying.
 So this was before she ever came to Toronto.
 It was a long time, yes.
 So she, her and Rowan started this orphanage.
 She arrived in Toronto, burned out, ready to quit.
 That's not a mission anymore.
 Yes.
 What was she like when she came back?
 Oh, I wanted to see if you start speaking of Rowland.
 Yes.
 Rowland, when he came, he was very quiet person.
 He's very genius.
 very quiet, doesn't normal laugh wildly and all kind of that stuff.
 So, but when he went to Toronto, when he came back, he came back in New
 Roland. Wow. Suddenly, he was excitement in his preaching and whatever he does
 was laughing and playing and it was just a nice person. Yes. And then the same hide,
 you hide? Well, she was already laughing, pissing and talking and all kind of that stuff.
 But the passion, it was intense when she came back. And then even when she began laying
 her hands to the pastors, everyone was going under the power of the Holy Spirit to everyone.
 When she just praying, prophesying, whatever, the Holy Spirit was doing amazing intense
 And then the church has multiplied, didn't they? When they came back, the church just exploded.
 Oh, it was almost like there was, well, we were struggling on baby three, four, five
 churches. But when she came back, the church exploded up, baby, I can say 400 or whatever.
 But when after the natural disaster in 2000, the church began exploding like a flood.
 And how many churches do you currently oversee now?
 Well, we stop counting in 2010, which was about 10 to 17,000 churches across the world.
 So you started Africa.
 But you said you started with four or five that were struggling.
 Yes.
 Then you went to four to 500 and then you start counting after you reached about 17,000.
 Yes.
 Yeah, good idea. Stop counting.
 It'd be hard to count.
 We'd stop counting, yeah.
 Can you tell again the story about going into the cholera camp that you told on the weekend?
 People will not know the story and we won't know how bad cholera is.
 So help us understand the epidemic that was happening and then the solution that God gave you.
 normal under the places of the flood, after the flood, the water goes anywhere, everywhere.
 So, and then the people become contaminated with the disease. The disease is a vomiting
 and intense diarrhea. So, because of that, it goes from person to another person to another person.
 and it dehydrates your body very fast and then you die very weak. You can't keep any food in
 your stomach. That is color. So in 2001, when that epidemic started in Maputo and there was a camp
 that the government of Maputo made and it is the tent around maybe I don't know in squares and
 and meters, something like that. So let me not go on squares and meet.
 How many people were inside of the tent? Oh, it was almost is hundreds or thousands of people.
 It's not one tent because it is just open tent and it's just going around just to protect the place.
 Right. Okay.
 And there was a gate so that when they bring the people go inside the tent and then they started
 medicating them. And so while they continue vomiting and direaring.
 So it was in the morning one day we come to the base and we heard that in news that the people
 dying in a massive and there is a camp where they are busy treating them. So then we went to the
 Colorado camp. When we arrived at the gate, they refused when we asked to enter. They refused because
 they didn't want anybody healthy to go into the camp. So they had quarantined all these people.
 Exactly. That is a great name. So they had quarantined all these people in a large
 camp. There's about a thousand people. There's a security guard. No one gets in. Yes, yes. It's an
 epidemic, people are dying and you guys want to go in and pray for people.
 Exactly.
 And they won't let you.
 They won't let us to say if you go as a health inside the camp and you want to go
 come out and apparently Heidi Baker is not an easy person to say no to.
 Oh, yes.
 She began persisting with a very small voice.
 Please let us in.
 And if we die, no problem.
 God, you know, it's going to look after it.
 Please.
 Let us in, let us in, we want to pray for the people.
 Which I was by the count also said, yes, yes, please let us let us see.
 Let us see.
 And are you guys scared at this point?
 Presumably not.
 Oh, this time you call it as contagious or call it a kills the people.
 It was like that mind that comes and say nothing's going to happen anyway.
 So you had holy spirit boldness.
 Yes.
 And you're going to go into an infected camp of people
 vomiting and diarrhea were highly contagious. So what happens? They let you in.
 So they let us in. We went to them and just start to see, hide these busy kissing
 them and praying for them. And I'm just coming around those, I didn't kiss them
 anyway, but I was then praying with them. She doesn't care anything. Just kissing
 everybody. And praying is going to be fine. It's going to be fine.
 So later on she said, "Okay, take it a kind, go out to the shop,
 buy the mineral water, bring the mineral water in,
 let's distribute the mineral water to the people to drink the clean water."
 And which I did, I went out, took the car,
 I loaded the car full of mineral water,
 came up, bring everyone bottle of water,
 and we started drinking.
 And almost by as we spend about,
 I'm few hours that we spent a day and the people are just getting healed.
 So everybody in the tents got healed.
 Everybody was getting healed and the work began for me to transport the people back into the city.
 So the people that were dying in this quarantine camp within the space of a couple of hours,
 all of them completely healed.
 All of them completely healed.
 Wow.
 Pastor Francie, you have a remarkable story that you shared this weekend at the conference.
 Yes.
 Yeah, the story is up in 2003 in South Africa at the conference.
 Okay.
 The Pastor's surprise organized the conference that you would.
 So Pastor's surprise, you come down 2003, you organize a youth conference.
 Yes.
 And Pastor Francie, you're at this conference.
 And as i understand you're out at late night and you're you're encouraging everybody come into the conference.
 And you you run into a group of guys and you say come on in coming in and they don't want to come in.
 A the guys resist the time is said to them come in because now the dark because it is place is a very.
 No good place okay so it's a dangerous place you want people to be safe to invite them in and they don't just refuse to come in.
 but they attack you. Yeah, they beat you. The time they tell me, I ask you to come in,
 one day, I'm saying, no, like coming in one day, I'm saying, let's beat. No, wow, guys,
 this is a conference. Now, wait, the place for play beat one another. The one is, oh, let's kill
 I start to reverse, reverse, run away.
 If the guys come fast to me, it's not impeding me.
 So how many of them are there?
 How many guys?
 I seek them.
 Six guys are chasing you.
 Yeah.
 You're weak because you've been praying and fasting.
 Yes.
 And these six guys overtake you.
 Yeah.
 And they beat you.
 Yes.
 And then one of them starts stabbing you.
 Yes.
 But here's the crazy part.
 They murdered you.
 Yeah.
 Because the time is a bit to me, one is also the voice, "let's kill."
 I will bring a lot of them, I start beating me.
 So at the time that they're beating you, you hear one person say, "let's kill him."
 Yes.
 This is going to sound a silly question.
 But when they're beating you and stabbing you, are you in pain?
 Are you aware of what's going on?
 Or have you started going to heaven?
 Immediate.
 I saw the time beating my body, the time I'm leaving go heaven.
 So you're out of your body and you're looking down and they see you can see that they're
 beating your body.
 Actually, what is what he was saying is that the last voice that he had say, let's kill
 him.
 That was the last voice.
 And then you're then when he was floating, wow, he could not hear about he also those
 that were beating his body.
 So you saw as you're going to heaven, other people beating your body.
 And so there's so many ways we could approach this story, but let's try this.
 So they've murdered you.
 Let's forget that you've gone to heaven.
 Pass a surprise.
 When do you find out that he's been killed?
 Well, the military because the people are still inside the hall.
 Yes.
 And they saw what was happening outside the gate.
 Right.
 And then they call the police and the police because of that village, they know that it's
 very dangerous.
 They call the military.
 So the military that came in.
 So his body is lying on the ground, dead, blood everywhere.
 You call the police, they call the military police.
 They come and take away his body.
 They come and took the body.
 Okay, so they take the body.
 You're at the middle of a conference.
 You must have been distraught.
 One of your passes has been murdered.
 So much.
 So you're all grieving that your friend and your pastor is dead.
 Yes.
 And he gets taken to the morgue.
 Yes.
 Put in a body bag, tagged, death certificate, dead.
 dead. Okay. It's so surreal looking at somebody we're speaking about who was dead. So he's
 in the morgue, he's tagged, he's in a body bag, zipped up. And you're all, what are you,
 are you praying for him to be resurrected? Or are you praying for comfort? What are you
 praying for? We are praying for the forgiveness of forgiveness of that tragedy. The whole
 church was praying, father forgive this voice, father forgive this voice. So you're not praying
 from to be raised from a dead, you're just praying for forgiveness. Well, the whole
 shit was praying for forgiveness for those people. So meanwhile, your body's dead and
 in the morgue. So the story happens that as a day later that somebody else dies and they're
 pushing that body into the following day, yes, the following day somebody else in the
 village dies. Yes. And the in the mortuary in the morgue, they're putting another body
 into the morgue and his body begins twitching in a body bag.
 Yes.
 So the assistant freaks out because it's a dead body that's moving and they unzip the
 body bag and tell us a story surprise.
 Well, and the board was brought to the hospital.
 You see now the board in the doctors now, they're taking care of it.
 Is he back in his right mind or is just as body is alive but mentally he's not awake?
 Oh well, I don't know.
 Okay.
 Do you do you, Francie, do you remember any of that?
 Yes.
 I remember the I remember the time come back.
 I look my left and say another person is a date.
 I look on the side.
 It's a decline immediate, but surprise appear coming.
 He said, don't cry, don't cry.
 And he called the doctor.
 He finally asked for another pastor.
 He said, pastor, go buy the clothes.
 Because you're naked because you've been on the body bag.
 And is your body all bruised and cut and swollen?
 Is that what you said?
 Yes.
 So your, his body must have looked amass.
 So actually, when I arrived at the first time,
 it was not recognized.
 You didn't recognize him as your friend.
 Oh, no. First time I couldn't trust him.
 So his body was just his face all disfigured.
 Body is swollen.
 Yes.
 And but he is alive but doesn't look like himself.
 Yes.
 And then how long between when you and your wife see him
 and when you go back to your past with your pastor friend?
 I think four hours.
 And in the four hours he's completely healed, is that right?
 Very storied.
 So no cut marks on his body, no bruising.
 Yes.
 I mean, that's just amazing.
 Yeah.
 So, okay, there's so much to unpack here.
 I'm sorry.
 This may be my rational mind, but it's amazing.
 So now four hours has passed.
 You're back alive.
 He needs some clothes.
 So your pastor brings some clothes.
 They pass the papa, papa, papa, papa.
 Oh, they're mening.
 The kiliyu.
 I read it the rest of it.
 They jail now in the police.
 And I go, "Wow, I need to see the men."
 So the first thing you do after coming back from the dead is you put on some clothes
 that somebody else has bought for you and you want to go find the man that killed you.
 Yes.
 And so you go to the prison where the jail where the man is.
 Yes.
 And what do you say to the prison guard?
 You ask the police, "Please, any of these men is killing me."
 And they said, "No, you can't see him.
 He's a murderer."
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And you said, "Yes, but he murdered me and now I'm alive."
 Yes.
 Okay, let's just go with that.
 So then the man who killed you comes out.
 What does he do when he sees you?
 At the time we come out, he asked the police, "Please release this man.
 Go home."
 The police said, "No, this man I will release.
 Go home."
 Because this man is a killer.
 He is speaking again and again.
 The police said, "Okay, I'll leave this man."
 So you're saying release the man.
 He hasn't done anything wrong.
 And the police are saying, no, he's killed somebody.
 And you say, yeah, he killed me.
 Yeah, I ask that this man killing me is wow.
 So when the man who killed you saw you, was he, do you think you were a ghost?
 Was he scared?
 I mean, was trembling, trembling, it started shocking.
 He started shaking.
 And what did you do?
 Yeah, I feel that he said, man, I forgive you.
 I said, "The man who murdered you the day before gives his life to Jesus and is now a pastor."
 Amazing.
 Yeah, absolutely amazing.
 Now let's rewind in time, right?
 Because that's the story beginning to end.
 Talk to us about your time in heaven.
 So you're being killed, you're floating up to heaven.
 I don't want to say floating, you're ascending into heaven.
 I don't know what the proper transport mechanism is,
 but you're moving up to heaven.
 You can see your body being beaten and stabbed.
 Then what happens?
 Immediate, I'm a heaven. Everything to me is up and gets you say, "Wow, I look at sight.
 I look at sight, it's like this place is another place."
 Immediate, I saw the one behind you, it's come closer to me, come closer to me, say to me,
 "Man, follow me."
 "The Angel."
 So it's an angel?
 Yes.
 An angel says, "Follow me."
 He says, "Follow me."
 Yep.
 I started to follow the angel because the Bible talked about the man.
 And I invested in Jesus said to me, follow me.
 And oh, this is very good to follow the man, the angel.
 Yes.
 He started to follow us.
 That's good heavenly protocol.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Very good.
 Yeah.
 So I started to follow the angel.
 The angel said to me, I know this man.
 Maganu, this man is a habron.
 And I go, wow.
 So you met Abraham and heaven.
 Yes. Did you speak to him? No. No, you just the angel just pointed him out.
 Yes, I pointing him.
 Yes. Okay.
 This is Abraham.
 Yeah.
 They finally say to me, follow me.
 I thought they follow the man.
 The angel, the final ask to me again.
 I know this one.
 I'm gonna know this is a chakob.
 I go, wow.
 It's a close.
 They're thrown.
 The closer you go to the throne.
 In the throne.
 Yeah, the throne.
 I saw the 24.
 It has held us.
 It has been worshiping.
 It has been a lot of the hunger around.
 It has been worshiping.
 The throne of God.
 I mean, there I recognize my mind saying,
 this place no more dead.
 This place no more sickness.
 Immediate.
 I am making it that.
 I also devotees call me.
 Pras!
 meet it, or to the voice and come back.
 So just to recap, you see the Lord on the throne, you see the 24 elders,
 you see the worship, and as you're witnessing that you're thinking,
 "Ah, this is heaven, there's no more pain, there's no more sickness."
 And as soon as you have that thought, you hear another voicing, "Francy, Francie."
 And it's somebody on earth calling your name.
 And that's when you came back to life.
 What was your first thought when you came back?
 The time comes back, it starts to cry. It's like, ooh, because I like the worshiping. It's amazing
 worshiping. So if it comes back, it starts to imagine, I know life, life is, many things happen.
 And it did this, and it did this, and it got, I imagine from now, as in heaven,
 and a good chance to get to worshiping God only.
 Wow. Yeah.
 Pass a surprise. You were saying that for, I don't know how long, a couple of months, a year
 after he came back to life, that often, Pastor Francie, you'd be speaking to him and he would
 zone out and you learned to realize that even though his body was here, spiritually, he was in
 the heavenly realms. The separation of conversation. So do you remember that, Francie? Do you remember
 sitting here on earth and then suddenly finding yourself in heaven?
 Yes.
 [Laughs]
 What was that like?
 Actually, let me start, is that when we were in a conversation, doing the conversation,
 like for instance, "Oh, you are good, we are having a good tea," and so on, suddenly
 he was saying something else beside what we are talking.
 So he would be answering questions that you hadn't asked.
 Yes, yes, yes.
 He will be speaking something else. Sometimes when the meeting,
 we are talking this and this and this and this.
 Suddenly it's just different story that doesn't exist anymore here.
 And how long did that go on for?
 Well, himself, I think he couldn't recognize that he was doing it beyond it.
 So...
 Oh, yeah, remember.
  </li><li>I remember that. - You remember?
 Yeah, the purpose.
 Did you find that your dream life changed when you came back from heaven?
 Yes, I think in a lot of things, the way I do it things.
 Pass a surprise.
 Yes.
 I can't believe I'm going to ask this question.
 Go ahead.
 How many people have you seen raised from the dead?
 Well, I saw quite a few of them.
 And when I count, it's almost like self-hate to some more.
 Right. People that didn't reason from the dead, that Jesus rose them from the dead.
 And Pastor Francis is one of them.
 Well, we don't count him much because he goes...
 He was just a bonus.
 Only himself, yes.
 He was not anybody laying dead or whatever.
 Yeah. That's the way I do it too.
 Yes.
 I don't count the ones that I didn't actually lay my hands on.
 Yes, they don't even count.
 Yeah.
 That makes sense. Yeah. You're just a freebie.
 Yeah.
 So seven or eight that you've actually laid hands on and seen them come back.
 Yes, yes, yes.
 Do you remember the first person that you prayed for who came back to life?
 Well, the first person that I prayed took that came back to life is a girl in Santa,
 her name in Comatidrai.
 And how old was she when she died?
 She was six years old.
 Six years old.
 Yes.
 What did she die from?
 Malaria, she died from malaria.
 Yes.
 And how did you get involved in praying?
 Well, I was doing crusade in Comatidrai.
 me and a friend, George. So, George was a guy that was playing the costume. What you call the
 according? According? According, yes. So, then we were in this village. We had a good time. We
 started on mending and choose the evening. The number of people drop down. And then on
 Wayne's, the denduna, which is the like a half chief, the denduna of the place came to our place
 place where we were sleeping, me and George.
 And he said that, "No, you have to stop your crusade,
 because the community hall that you are using nearby,
 next to the community hall, someone died yesterday."
 That's why the number of crusade baby was drop it down
 because of that.
 So I said to the Nuna Kannir, I just go there
 to pay my condolences, of course.
 So, we went there, and when I arrived there in that place,
 So inside the house there were six ladies and they were just sitting and so on.
 I agreed to them and I asked them if I could pray.
 The ladies of course go ahead and pray.
 And I started praying and praying and praying.
 Maybe my prayer went long or I don't know what happened.
 And I opened my Bible and I read this small piece of scripture
 in the book of Micah, which says, "The nations will be surprised."
 "So soon, okay, so I close my Bible and then I open my eyes and see all those six ladies were
 sleeping." So, and then I approached towards the little girl where she was sleeping and she was
 wrapped with the sheet. I took off the sheet and wrapped the sheet. So, I put my finger into the
 little hand off in Santa. So I wasn't calling her to come back to life, but I was just praying in
 turn. Suddenly she grabbed up my finger. I was shocked myself because I didn't expect that she
 was going to rise up from the dead. And then when she grabbed my finger, I said,
 so I jumped to the dead. And then she looked at my eyes and said, I'm hungry.
 I look around. There was a bottle of Coca-Cola to lita open and give it to the girl. The girl
 was drinking that nice Coca-Cola woke up with the mother and the mother started shouting.
 Shouting. She jumped, went outside and all the ladies start waking up and so on.
 Then presumably your crusade had a lot more people that night. That evening,
 when we saw that evening was a lot of people outstanding outside the community hall than inside.
 So why do you think they were asleep?
 Do you think God put them to sleep or?
 I think was there because most of the time the biblical Thames, Jesus was telling the
 people to go out.
 And I believe he himself put them out.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 To eradicate.
 Lack of faith.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Wow.
 Some of the most amazing stories I've ever heard.
 You told some incredible stories this weekend that haven't declared.
 Yes.
 were astonishing. Oh, it was amazing. I think some of the people, maybe they will just check
 on your website as well. Yeah. And download what we've been talking. Yeah, we'll put a
 link to the sessions from the Heaven Declares Conference of People can download and listen
 to them. We'd highly recommend that. That would be great if you do that.
 Pass a surprise. Okay.
 Would you pray for everybody who's listening, for an impartation of faith and boldness and
 joy?
 I mean, when I think of you, I think of your joy, I think of your faith and I think of
 your boldness.
 Would you pray for everybody who's listening right now for us to have an increase in those
 things and encounters with the Lord?
 Yes, I'll do that.
 And because joy is very important in life.
 So because without joy you can't live well.
 On Earth though, we all need joy.
 And joy is something that we have to fight for all the time.
 And joy is easy to be stolen also.
 By people that can still enjoy any time.
 So but to fight for it is great.
 So I would pray for special deliciness
 that they may have joy and heavit in fullness.
 So shall we pray Father in the mighty name of Jesus.
 I pray for this man that is listening,
 I pray for this lady that is listening,
 that your power, your anointing,
 in the mighty name of Jesus.
 We believe as we pray.
 If we didn't believe we could not pray,
 we could not save the Lord,
 but we saved the Lord we believe in his love, in his mess.
 I pray that you'll pour out Holy Spirit.
 The love, the joy that you say, I give,
 I give my peace, I give my joy,
 that my joy may be full and completely new.
 Thank you, Lord.
 Thank you, Jesus Christ.
 And I speak healing also,
 even if he is on cancer medication,
 the ability medication I speak of right now,
 healing, be healed.
 So listen now in the name of Jesus.
 Don't resist to this prayer.

 In the name of Jesus.
 I command this body be healed, be healed, be healed in the name of Jesus.
 And I speak also for revelation.
 Because without revelation we go straight.
 I pray that the listener will receive the revelation, the revelation, receive the revelation
 of Jesus Christ, revelation of the Spirit of God, the revelation of the Creator, of
 everything in the mighty name of Jesus.

 So, babe, when we started this podcast, did you ever think that we'd be
 interviewing somebody who'd raised people from the dead?
 No.
 And now 75 and we've just interviewed somebody who's raised seven or eight
 people from the dead.
 Yes.
 And somebody who was previously dead.
 Yeah.
 Gromatically, that's a weird interview to do.
 So when you were dead.
 Things you never thought you'd say.
 So, wrapping up, here's the deal.
 We'd love you to go to heavendeclares.info.
 We'd love you to be part of the conference.
 You can watch the sessions.
 You can download the sessions there.
 I will put a link to those in the show notes.
 If you would like copies of our show notes, go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/75.
 And one of the things that you guys could do to really help us is to share this podcast
 on social media so people hear a surprise, a story, and then go ahead and leave us a great
 review on iTunes. That would be awesome.
 And so it really helps get news out about our podcast. If you leave positive reviews
 on iTunes, their ranking algorithm is a mystery, but almost everyone agrees that the more up
 to date and positive reviews you get, the more profile you have. And we really want
 to get this story out for people to hear. We hope you have a fantastic week filled with
 adventure. Next week, we're going to be talking about life languages and the joy that they bring
 to our family, our community and our workplace.
