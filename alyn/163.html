<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 163 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 This week we're talking about direction for your life and how to find it.
 Plus, we've got some amazing listeners' questions about the word prophetic when applied
 to things other than words, AJ's review of her new planner and a heads-up on the Heaven
 declares conference. But first of all, most importantly,
 A.G. Jones, how the heck are you?<br/>
 I'm great. How are you?<br/>
 Do you feel great, sir, because you're wearing your sexy
 librarian glasses? You just took them off.
 I did, because I can't look at you.<br/>
 I they're like for reading or something.
 And so I can't actually see you, which what happens.
 You look fuzzy, fuzzy, fuzzy, foggy.<br/>
 Oh, well, you look great for the moment you were wearing them.
 Thank you.<br/>
 not to say you don't look great now.<br/>
 I could put on the fake ones if you want me to wear some glasses while we podcast.
 Very much so.<br/>
 Hang on a second, I'll just put those on for you.
 And then you can call me Mr. Money Penny.
 Did Miss Money Penny wear glasses?<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 Oh, Miss Money Penny.<br/>
 Do you like them?<br/>
 They look very nice.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 All right, tell me about this week.<br/>
 Oh, it was great week.<br/>
 It was a very full week.<br/>
 It kind of, it was very full socially.
 Yeah.<br/>
 But we had Monday and Tuesday and Friday off work.
 Yes.<br/>
 work. I know right. Just two days. Ta-da. Yeah, we had some days in Ludentway from the previous
 week. So it was nice to have Monday and Tuesday off and just hang out with Mugs and, you know,
 Mugs being our four-year-old. Yes. He's going to be five soon. He keeps telling me.
 Yeah. How many days? 68. But he was counting. He asks every morning.
 Well, it might not have been full with work, but it was very full. So it felt like we were either
 out for dinner with friends or we had friends over for dinner all week.
 Yes.<br/>
 Is that true or my imagination?<br/>
 No, that's true.<br/>
 Oh, we had a really full week.<br/>
 I'm trying to think what we ate.<br/>
 Oh, we ate a ton of brisket.<br/>
 A lot of brisket.<br/>
 Good Lord.<br/>
 You can never have too much brisket, though.
 And pimento cheese.<br/>
 I tell you, I could have too much pimento cheese, but I can't have too much
 brisket.<br/>
 I was built to live in the south.<br/>
 OK, sweet tea.<br/>
 Yeah, brisket.<br/>
 Yeah, pimento cheese.<br/>
 Should I mention that you drink unsweet tea or not really?
 Well, I, you know, I like sweet too, but just any kind of tea.
 Here's the irony of all ironies.<br/>
 I grew up in Britain and I never drank tea.
 I move here.<br/>
 I drink the stuff.<br/>
 Iced.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 You're a strange one, but you're cute.
 So we'll keep you Wednesday was our staff meeting at Grey Center, which is always
 really fun.<br/>
 It's a great group of people.<br/>
 We have a great time with each other.<br/>
 They're amazing, aren't they?<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And it felt fun because it felt like we're all back from summer vacation or something.
 So the room was full.<br/>
 I was nice.<br/>
 And then Thursday we had our S.O.S.L. school super natural life staff meeting, which was
 tremendous fun because it was like our last meeting before school kicks off this week.
 Yes.<br/>
 I know Tuesday morning, baby.<br/>
 Let's do this.<br/>
 You know, one of the things I think, you know, it's easy to think about the practical things
 God's done to bless us.<br/>
 But I would say easily one of the biggest blessings in our life are the people we get
 to work with.<br/>
 Oh, for sure.<br/>
 Amazing people.<br/>
 Amazing.<br/>
 I absolutely love it.<br/>
 I can't imagine doing the school<br/>
 about the people that we have.
</p><ul>
  <li>I can't either.
 That's why whenever we do the declarations over our finances,
 I stare them down when it says jobs and better jobs,
 just to make sure.
  </li><li>They can have better jobs within the jobs they're doing.
  </li><li>That's true. - Already.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
  </li><li>And it's our job to create better jobs for them.
 But yeah, the pressure is on.
 Ask me why Friday was my favorite day this week?
  </li><li>Well, I was Friday your favorite day this week.
 twofold first. It was a big nerdy day for me. I just got to play with technology all day.
 Yeah. I went out to a friend's house and helped set up a whole lot of electronics. And then
 I got to come home and play video games all afternoon with MJ.
 He loves playing video games with you. It's so cute.
 About time. I mean, I think I feel...
 I think I feel... I feel... I know. But I think I feel the way... Like if I was an athletic father
 and I played baseball all my childhood.
 And then finally my son wanted to play baseball without any pressure for me.
 I think that's the feeling I'm warming in my heart right now.
 Right.
 Only more like couch potato version of that.
 He loves Nintendo and I'm like, OK, train up a child in the way that you go.
 And he will not depart from it.
 I feel like I've done my job well.
 Now you must be playing some sort of a Avengers game because every once in a while,
 I hear you say things like, no, MJ, you're not Spider-Man.
 you're the Hulk or you're not, whoever, and you have to remind him which one he is.
 We're playing Lego superheroes, which is all of the Marvel superheroes.
 And he knows them all by name, obviously.
 Right.
 But it's got this weird split screen where I get confused as to who I'm playing.
 And we have to swap characters.
 And some of the things are quite technical and his motor skills aren't quite there yet.
 I mean, he's improved hugely.
 Like, yeah, she knows where he is and where he's going now, which is a relief because before
 I just took the batteries out the controller and said, oh, you're doing great.
 You're doing great.
 I mean, why you didn't like the game that much, but it was.
 Wait, but is it a timed game?
 No, praise God.
 No.
 OK, you would know if it was a time game.
 Well, I did wonder because I heard on Friday, I'm saying something like, daddy,
 why is the abomination a bad guy?
 I mean, I think he's maybe he could be a good guy.
 And I heard you say, yeah, MJ, you just have to get through that door, buddy.
 We have to get through the door.
 either. Like we don't want to go into the philosophy of whether the
 abomination should be a good guy or bad guy. So I thought maybe it was timed.
 And then this morning he had to stay home from church. Yeah. And he was home with you.
 I went to church for both services. And as soon as I walked in the door,
 he was just like, Daddy, can we play video games? So yeah, I feel like I've reached a new level
 of parenting. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's, uh, that's the goal of our parent. They're right there.
 Saturday we got the speed of technology we got a new TV well new to us a friend of ours was getting rid of his TV and i manage a snag it which i have to love but this thing is colossal it's enormous it is.
 It is the same size is our TV downstairs but in that upstairs playroom it just looks enormous it's like the size of the wall picture quality on it is astounding and so we did movie now we try to move you know each week but as t a reminder that you've been failing at movie now.
 So we went to Saturday night and we had popcorn and we watched some one of the ice age
 And it was so fun just to cuddle children on us so fun
 My mother would be so proud to know that I spent that we can't teach you much of video games
 I'm watching ice ice age with popcorn. Yeah, you missed church this morning. I did and I didn't I watched online for both services
 Yes, well worship was amazing outstanding. It was great on the live feed. It sounded amazing
 Come on. Yeah. And then Jeff Dollar preached one of my favorite messages this morning.
 Yeah, really good. It was so good. He called me yesterday and we were shooting the breeze in the
 news telling me this is what I'm thinking of sharing. And when he started sharing that, I was like,
 "Oh, I feel so excited about what he's sharing." And so I took beautiful mind-mapped notes this
 morning on the message. And I just... Of course you did.
 There was a ton of revelation. And if you like what we talk about this week on the podcast,
 I'd highly recommend you watch the second service of Jeff Sharon because this huge overlap between the two of them. It was absolutely fantastic.
 Did not disappoint.
 Well, speaking of our topic for today, what are we doing, babe?
 We are talking about a topic that I found from all our listener survey. Thank you to everybody who filled in the listener survey, by the way.
 Really appreciate that. -Yes, thank you very much.
 I was shocked to read that nearly 50% of people who responded said the number one thing they needed
 right now was help with direction. So I thought we could start there.
 Okay, sounds good. You know, I started throwing around some ideas of what we'd share on direction
 and it was very similar to what we talked about last week with the whole, you know, navigating
 your prophetic words. And so we started making a list of, oh, here's what you do. And I thought,
 Actually, I didn't get direction for my life until I did something that I think is a prerequisite
 for following Jesus.
 Okay.
 And what's that?
 Sacrifice.
 I know.
 At this point, everyone's like, "Are you kidding me?
 I want to practical steps."
 Not sacrifice.
 But here's the thing.
 Certainly in my life and in the lives of many of the people I've led over the years, often
 we want God to guide us on our terms.
 Yes.
 We're kind of like, "Okay, Lord, just tell me what to do within these parameters."
 Right.
 But then this very narrow field of things that I want to do.
 And I've been meditating a lot recently on the goodness of the Lord.
 And the last couple of times I've been with the Lord, this phrase has been rolling through
 my head.
 And I tweeted it out a couple of months ago, that the only thing sacrifice has ever done
 is lead me into utter satisfaction.
 which is crazy because at the point of sacrifice,
 I thought I was losing everything.
  </li><li>Right, at the time, it never seems like
 the benefit is gonna come.
  </li><li>No, because you're giving away everything
 that's precious to you, that's the sacrifice part.
 And you're watching it die.
  </li><li>And everything that is precious to you
 might actually not even exist yet.
 It's the precious thoughts in your head about--
  </li><li>So true.
  </li><li>What you want the future to look like,
 or what your hopes and dreams are.
 And I think sometimes we forget about the goodness of God in the midst of that.
 And when the Lord says, Hey, would you give me that?
 We think we're trading it in for an inferior dream.
 Because, you know, we don't understand that sacrificing something to God always
 means that you get something better back.
 Right.
 The death is painful, but the resurrection was so glorious.
 Right.
 There's a verse in the Psalms.
 It's long been one of my favorites.
 It says this, the boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places.
 Surely I have a delightful inheritance at Psalm 16 verse 6.
 Today, in my life at 42 years old, when I look at my life, I can absolutely say the boundary
 lines for me have fallen in pleasant places. I have an incredible inheritance. But here's the thing,
 if I was to go back 20 years and look at my life now, 20 year old Alan looking at 40 year old Alan,
 I would not want the life that God chose for me. Well explain that.
 So what I mean is often God's boundary lines don't look pleasant from the outside.
 Oh, right.
 So if somebody had said to you in your twenties, hey, you're going to be a pastor
 and you're going to be in ministry and whatnot.
 That would have looked appealing to you.
 Not not even remotely.
 Right.
 Not even remotely.
 So the thing that did look appealing, my idols got it to kill first.
 Right.
 Because I, you know, if God had come and said, Hey, what God did do, he'd come and
 follow me and I was like, "Where?" And he's essentially saying, "I'm not telling you."
 Because if he told me, I wouldn't want to have come.
 Yeah, you wouldn't have chosen it.
 Right. I would have been reluctant to cross the boundary line into what he called pleasant.
 Right. Okay.
 And yet now that I have, it's utter satisfaction.
 Yeah. I mean, can you imagine having the life that you once hoped to have now? And do you think
 that would have been better. Oh, I mean, I think, well, better, no. I mean, like, I feel utterly
 satisfied. Like, I remember in 2004, I mean, all I ever wanted to do was see the glory of God.
 Like, my whole goal was to see the glory of God. And when I came to Toronto and lived in Toronto,
 lived in that warehouse for five months and got to go to what is now catch the fire church,
 I remember walking with the Lord one evening, I went out late at night and I just wandering around
 with the Lord and I just said, "Lord, I could die happy now. I feel so satisfied that my eyes
 have seen and I have tasted of the goodness of God and everything I ever wanted. You've utterly
 satisfied me." That was 2004 and I feel like in the subsequent 13 years, the depth of satisfaction
 Lord has brought to my soul. I don't even have a definition for. I don't even know to want what I
 have now. Right. And I think that's more what I'm touching on, that statement of I didn't even know
 to want what I have now. Because I don't think I honestly ever expected life to feel this full and
 lovely, you know. And so for me, while it's nothing that I dreamed about 20 years ago,
 it's everything I hoped existed somewhere.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 So I think our starting point sounds negative, but it really isn't. Our starting point would be
 start with abandonment to God.
 Yeah.
 Genuinely just say, "God, I will do anything, say anything, go anywhere."
 And then ask for direction.
 Right.
 God gets to be God and you get to follow because often our direction, if we're not careful as we're just asking God for confirmation bias.
 Hey, God, I'd really like to do this. What do you think? Yes, yes, yes.
 And everything that we're going to say next will be skewed if abandonment hasn't been the prerequisite.
 Right. I mean, God is not your magic. No, he actually wants to have more of a say.
 Right. Yeah. But here's the trick. It feels like we're going to be robbed. Yeah. Now we know that's not true. But when he's asking you to walk away,
 if he does, if he asks you to walk away from a place you love or a job you really want or a career you'd always hoped for or, you know, an outlook on life that you'd always wanted, it feels so hard. But he's not mean. He's not out to rob you.
 He's just the giver of good gifts.
 So our encouragement would be start with abandonment to God.
 If you want direction, get on your knees and just say, Lord, I am abandoned to you.
 I am following you.
 I gave my life to you when I gave my life to follow Jesus.
 I apologize if there's any parts of it I've taken back.
 I'm for you.
 I'll go anywhere.
 I'll do anything.
 You can do anything you want with me.
 And that opens up a whole new color palette for the Lord to paint with.
 Right.
 Good.
 All right.
 Having started with abandonment, what would you encourage people to do next?
 I think start with looking at your prophetic words.
 What if you don't have any?
 Ask the Lord for some.
 Go to a church like ours and get some prophetic words.
 You know, yeah, ask the Lord to start talking to you about, OK, God, if if we're
 setting aside everything I've ever hoped for, what is everything you've ever
 hoped for for me, you know, and you know, it those things may collide.
 They may be the same thing.
 So it's not like, you know, he's a good dad.
 And I think that's the scary part of laying anything aside is it's only scary
 if you don't know who he is.
 Right.
 If you know who he is, if you know how good he is, it isn't scary to let God
 actually make the decisions.
 It's actually a relief.
 See, that wasn't my experience.
 Okay.
 My experience was just, you know, holding on to the rollercoaster rail really, really tightly and white knuckling the thing.
 But then again, to your point, I wonder how much of a revelation the father's love I had.
 I'd like to think I had some on Diodally.
 It's grown over the years.
 Yes.
 But think about now, babe, like when God asks you to do something now, you don't have to white knuckle anything.
 No, no, you're right.
 But I think that's the whole point of life is that you mature.
 Well, if you think of David, David had the confidence to battle Goliath because he'd
 fought bears and lions.
 Right.
 And I think everything up until now has prepared you for tomorrow.
 And I think life with Jesus is one long game of the Lord just upping the ante on how good
 he could be and how much faith we can exercise.
 Yeah, it's good.
 I think.
 Yeah.
 So to your point about prophetic words, like, when I lived in Scotland, I didn't know
 know any prophets. I didn't know what a prophetic word looked like. And I remember
 I just asked an all Lord for direction. And to my delight, prophets would come to me
 in my dreams and prophesy over me. God is not hamstrung by your circumstances. So if
 you live in the middle of nowhere and you're like, Oh, yes, it's so great that you say
 just come to grace in her, but I live like 4000 miles away.
 I mean, Antarctica.
 The Lord can come to you. He's so good. But here's the thing. He's not ambivalent about
 your life. He knows that you're here for a purpose. He has a plan and he'd love to share it with you.
 Another thing you can look at is your dreams. Things like, what is God awakening in your heart
 through your dreams in this season? Do you mean dreams like how I've fallen asleep and had a dream
 or do you mean dreams in a broader sense of hope, dreams, aspirations?
 Well, I think I mean both, really. I think God has often gotten my attention through my actual dreams
 while I'm asleep to shift my heart into believing for something different.
 But also just what your heart gets excited about.
 Sometimes that's actually a great indication of something the Lord actually wants to give
 you.
 Which is a mind boggler if you're racing in a church environment like I was.
 Like I think I was somehow, I'm not sure it was taught this, but perhaps by osmosis,
 I just thought that life with God was just going to be one of sacrifice.
 And I know I've just taught about sacrifice.
 But I mean, like everything's gonna be hard
 and anything good you really want,
 God's gonna wanna take away from you
 because it's right, really soulish
 and you're not very spiritual.
  </li><li>I was like that.
 I always thought that if you gave your life to the Lord,
 I mean, really fully gave your life to Him.
 For sure, you're gonna be sent to be
 a missionary someplace, remote, mint, horrible with bugs.
  </li><li>Right. - You know what I mean?
 Like, yeah, so I think even in the season
 where the Lord was saying,
 "Hey, can I have your whole heart?"
 There was part of me that was like,
 "Oh, this is pretty dangerous.
 I see that buggy situation coming for me."
 You know, but that's only because I didn't understand
 how lovely he is and how good God is.
  </li><li>Well, what's that amazing verse where it talks about
 he opens his hand and satisfies the desires
 of every living thing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I have loved delighting myself in the Lord
 and him granting me the desires of my heart.
 I've loved that whole process of being near the Lord
 him undoing my heart with his goodness of going, "Oh, look, it's no surprise you're
 satisfied by this part of your life. I made you that way." Do you want to talk a little
 bit about the difference between living under a red light and living under a green light?
 Yeah, so living under a red light is basically living, waiting for the Lord to speak to you
 about every single event. So you can't move forward. You can't get peace on anything because
 because you're just waiting all the time
 for the Lord to speak to you about the next thing.
 So you're kind of imprisoned.
  </li><li>Well, you also think that,
 if you're living with a red light mindset,
 it's like being stuck in a traffic jam
 because none of your wills or thoughts or ideas are valid.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>And you contrast that with--
  </li><li>Living under a green light.
 So living under a green light is more realizing
 that you are living under the favor of God
 and you can just keep heading forward
 and keep walking through the doors that he's opening for you
 and keep pushing on doors or knocking on doors or whatever.
 And what stops you is when God says stop
 as opposed to what makes you go is when God says go.
  </li><li>Right.
 And that's an amazing revelation
 where you reach a place,
 because I think it's also maturity in the Lord.
 You know, when you're early,
 an early believer with the Lord,
 The Lord is really, really leading you, but the whole goal of growth in God is not so
 that he leads you like a little child, but so that you're transformed into the likeness
 of Jesus Christ.
 And you start making decisions that what is it that Bill says God wants your mind renewed
 so your will could be done that you know your will is so similar to the Lord that you're
 just doing things that would please him anyway.
 And I love that.
 I remember when we moved here to Nashville, my, I mean, you'd heard from the Lord.
 I don't know how many years in advance to move to Nashville.
 And my whole thing was like, you've moved to here to do what move your how?
 Like, you know, I was living under a red light.
 Like, okay, Lord, it feels like we got a bunch of prophetic words about living
 in America.
 I sure wish you would, you know, speak to us about that.
 And even though the Lord was speaking, I couldn't hear.
 And then one day the Lord just said to me, Alan, would you like to move to Nashville?
 And I was so taken aback.
 I was like, what do you mean would I like to move to Nashville?
 the Lord is like, "Would you like to move to Nashville?" I'm like, "You mean like me personally,
 irrespective of what you were thinking?" And the Lord is like, "Sure." And I thought about it for a
 second. And honestly, this sounds flippant, but it wasn't. I was like, "Well, I mean, they have an
 Apple store and a cheesecake factory." And yeah, I mean, sure, I'd love to move to Nashville.
 And as soon as I said that, I just felt like this huge shift in my spirit where it wasn't like,
 "Oh God, should we, should we move to Nashville?" And I was like, "Oh, we're going to move to Nashville."
 and I felt this ease and this peace and this, you know, release from the Lord, not release from
 the Lord like the Lord was, you know, holding up on it. But I just felt like this pleasure of the
 Lord on the decisions to go places. Yeah. Talk to me about your journey because didn't you
 originally want to be a lawyer? I did. Yeah, I wanted to be a lawyer. Just because I like to
 arguing with people, I think.
 Out of girl.
 So yeah, I wanted to be a lawyer.
 I mean, I think there was a bunch of things that went into that.
 I wanted to be something that wouldn't be boring that I'd get to argue and that would
 be seen as successful.
 Right.
 And your uncle was a lawyer.
 My uncle was a lawyer.
 And but I wanted to be a corporate lawyer.
 I wanted to, I don't know, wear a suit and be aggressive, I guess.
 Put those glasses on in the power suit.
 Aggressive.
 Be aggressive.
 So, um, it was super funny because I even at the beginning of the renewal, like here we are in renewal and all this crazy stuff is happening and I'd, I'd done YWAM. So I'd done this, you know, ministry type school. And, but it was sort of like that's, this is my do my ministry type school before I get serious about going back to school and become a lawyer, like in my head, you know,
 Here you go Lord, here's five months.
 Right, here's five months Lord and then my life is back in my control.
 And then I started that year of the renewal, started getting all these prophetic words
 about being in ministry.
 And it was a huge shift, but it honestly took me about a year to say yes.
 Well, a year to say yes to the idea of yes.
 And then how many years from your yes to when you actually started doing it?
 I started sort of traveling part time and vomiting every time I had to speak a couple
 of years after that, so like four or five years after that.
 But I didn't start traveling full time until 2001.
 So those words were '94.
 I'm trying to do the math in my head.
 Well, so 1994, 2001, what's that, seven years?
 Yeah.
 And what's crazy is you wanted to be a lawyer, revival happens, so you end up waiting tables
 just because it was the most flexible thing to do to earn money and be available to do
 the revival meetings.
 Yeah.
 So basically that was the best job that I could find to be able to not miss any of the renewal
 because all the revival meetings would happen at night.
 So I would do breakfast lunch shifts or long lunch shifts, like lunch clothes shifts, so
 that I could have the nights off.
 And then also if something did happen and something happened, I could just call any number of
 30 people who would pick up shifts and go, "I can't come in today."
 You know what I mean?
 So it was the most flexible thing I could do to still.
 And what's funny is even in that, you didn't go from waiting tables to ministry.
 How you ended up getting your job at National Car Hire rental, whatever it's called?
 Yeah. Well, that was a trip. I was working at a restaurant and I had just started working
 at this particular restaurant. Right. And it was sort of like a, it was on the airport,
 airport strip. And again, I was just trying to, you know, put money away and had gotten to do
 some missions trips and that kind of stuff. So I was just trying to make a decent amount of money
 while still having flexibility. And I'd only been there about a week, and I served this
 table of these two young guys, you know, guys in their 30s or whatever. And it was the
 day that everything went wrong, you know, so...
 Oh, so?
 Well, I... These two guys were sort of sitting in the corner, and on one side of them was
 this table that just... You couldn't do anything to make them happy. And on the other side of
 them was this person that had a mushroom allergy who had ordered a pizza that had mushrooms
 on it and I had said no mushrooms.
 And then I had a huge section and then the owners of the hotel had come in and the manager
 had pulled me aside and said, "These guys have fired the last two servers they had on
 the spot.
 Please be really careful to do everything perfectly.
 I don't want to lose you."
 And whatever.
 And I'm like, "Thanks a lot.
 I've been here a week."
 And so it was just stress.
 was stress and you know the pizza came out with mushrooms and I sort of grabbed it right
 before it sat down and went "oh just a second you know" whatever but I guess I stayed pretty
 buoyant I think mostly because my other job didn't want me to leave the previous restaurant
 and they were like "we will have you back if anything happens come back" so I was sort
 of like "if I get fired today I still have a job" so whatever. But anyway yeah so serve
 these these two guys and at the end the one guy said "hey I'd love to offer you a job"
 I've just, he's like, we've been watching how you deal with stress and how you've dealt
 with all these different tables.
 And I just think, you know, I have a job for you.
 And I was like, Oh, you know, I like my job.
 Thanks so much.
 I just started here and whatever.
 And he's like, well, you know, I work for national car rental.
 And I was like, okay, great.
 You know, and I'm thinking, yeah, you know, like one of those little booths or whatever.
 And I was like, uh huh.
 So that's sweet and everything.
 And he's like, well, I'll just leave you my card.
 You can call me if you want.
 And I'm like, okay.
 So he laughed and then I looked at his card and he was the president of National Car
 Rental.
 So it turns out it was the vice president, the president that were literally sitting
 there taking up my table forever just watching me as everything was going wrong.
 And you know, it turned out to be a fine day and I didn't get fired.
 But here's the thing.
 You never thought, you know what?
 I think I want to be a lawyer.
 Now I screw that.
 I'd actually like to work in middle management in a car rental company.
 You didn't.
 No.
 And yeah, that door opened.
 Yeah.
 You stepped into it.
 Well, I didn't right away actually because I was sort of like, you know, I wasn't particularly
 interested.
 Again, I wanted to, my heart had then adjusted to being in full-time ministry by this point.
 And I didn't know how I got there, but I was pretty sure car rental wasn't the way there.
 And so I wasn't really interested.
 But then he came back in about three weeks later and asked to sit in my section and
 sat there the whole shift as well and was like, "No, I'm serious.
 I want to offer you a job."
 And when you said yes, where was National's Head Office?
 it was the building right next door to the church.
 And I didn't even realize that.
  </li><li>I mean, literally walk across the car park
 and you're at the church.
  </li><li>Yeah, the grass, yeah, it's right there.
 I mean, you could, yeah.
  </li><li>And I remember you saying that basically
 what you didn't realize is you were paid
 to pester all the people at national.
 Basically your job was to go around all the departments
 and review their personalities,
 their profiles, their disc tests, et cetera, et cetera.
 And restructure the teams based on what you thought
 would be the best working environment for them.
  </li><li>Yeah, I mean, for about the first year
 I trained in every single department,
 so I got to work with all of the different managers
 and learn how every department works
 so that I could run any department, which was really fun.
 And then after that, they promoted me to doing exactly
 what you're talking about.
 So for about two years, I basically pastored them.
 My job was to meet with all the city managers,
 and there was about 40 of them,
 and talked to them about their hopes and their dreams,
 and what they felt was going right,
 and what they didn't feel was going right,
 all that kind of stuff and then restructure teams based on strengths and weaknesses to
 try and make the company stronger.
 But here's the thing.
 It's easy in hindsight to see, "Oh my gosh, God was using national car rental to actually
 train you with some of the skills that you need to stay."
 Totally.
 But at the time did you think, "Oh, this is God's totally preparing me for ministry."
 Did you think, "I've totally missed it."
 Like, "Tell me what were you thinking at that point?"
 I didn't realize so much what I was doing.
 I was just having so much fun.
 I thought, "Oh, this fits me.
 I love this.
 figuring out people's strengths and figuring out how to help them and all that kind of
 stuff.
 And I remember talking to John once and John just saying, "Hey Jay, they're paying you
 to pastor those people."
 And I was like, "Oh, oh gosh, I guess they are."
 I see so many people with a major dose of FOMO, the whole fear of missing out thing.
 And they've forgotten that God is too big to let you miss out on things.
 So they're scared to go do a national car rental job or insert whatever job is completely
 unrelated to where you want to be.
 Because you think if I say yes to that and say no to my dreams, obedience to the Lord
 will always ensure you never miss out on what he has for you.
 And sometimes what he's asking you to do, it's back to that whole thing of sometimes
 the boundary lines that God's putting up for your life, although he sees they're going
 to be pleasant places.
 You are on the outside of that boundary line, outside of that fence looking in going, "Why
 would I want to be in there?"
 Like you wouldn't have picked a career in middle management in car rental.
 No.
 And yeah, it was a stepping stone.
 You got promoted like eight times in.
 Yeah, in five years.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 And what was amazing was you gave them a prophetic word at your job interview.
 I did.
 Yeah, I told them the day they interviewed me that within five years the Lord had told
 me I'd be in full-time ministry.
 So I said, I'll give you 150% while I'm here, but you need to know I'll be gone in five
 years.
 But that's the other thing.
 I think often we are spinning our wheels, waiting for our prophetic words to come to
 pass rather than getting on with life while we're coming to pass.
 And I get it.
 Like that was my whole thing.
 Like, but if I say, yes, this, I'm not going to be free when God needs a, no, no, no,
 no, no, no.
 I'm a big believer in blossoming where you're planted.
 Yeah.
 Like just sinking in roots, just doing what is in your hand to do.
 Because it is easier to steer a moving ship.
 Don't be sitting around waiting for direction.
 Get on with life and God will direct you as you go.
 I truly believe that.
 I think National Car until was one of my biggest learning seasons for even the
 season that I'm in now.
 Really?
 In so many ways, like, you know, it was, I had a whole bunch of dreams there that
 were, you know, incredible dreams that came true and all that kind of stuff was
 just taught me about the power of those things, but also what God can do with them.
 You know, I got to lead tons of people to the Lord and I stopped being afraid of man
 while I was there because, you know, I mostly work with men quite literally, you know, I
 was one of the very few females there and certainly one of the very few in middle management.
 And you just kind of had to hold your own and, you know, I learned a lot.
 And I think actually it's been super valuable.
 I didn't really realize though, as you said from before,
 I didn't realize how much I was learning until after.
  </li><li>Well, people forget that Moses was trained
 in Ferris courts. - Right.
  </li><li>We often think, if I'm in Egypt,
 how can I be in the promised land?
 Well, God trains you in every season
 to reign somewhere else. - For sure.
  </li><li>You know.
 So that's it, that's our thoughts on direction.
 And honestly, it starts with sacrifice.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then follow up with prophetic words.
 Listen to last week's episode
 on using your prophetic words to steer your future.
 And faithfulness is super important.
 Let your yes be yes and your no be no.
 If you say you're going to be somewhere, be somewhere.
 And don't subscribe to fear of missing out.
 Right.
 You know, when you show up for work, it may not be your dream job, but give it your 110
 percent because actually that's your witness.
 I speak to a friend tonight and he said, you know, God was speaking to him about his
 attitude because he was saying, I'm in a job that, you know, on paper is a great job.
 It's not where my heart is.
 So I realized I was going to work, not grumbling, but like not, you know, thrilled about it.
 And the Lord said to him, why don't you enter your workplace and hold this thought in your heart?
 I'm entering God's provision for my family today.
 And he said, it's been amazing going to work thinking, I'm at the place of God's provision for my family.
 I was like, good Lord, that's genius.
 That is genius.
 We often think that the chapter or in is the totality of the book.
 Right.
 And it's not the next chapter is being written.
 And God's in control.
 He has a plan for you.
 He will see his plans for your life completed.
 Yeah.
 Now, if this feels like, ah, that's great Alan, but it feels a little bit
 pithy.
 I want like some more meat.
 Go listen to Jeff dollars message from Sunday this morning.
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 It's going to be super helpful.
 Yeah, really good.
 All right.
 Are you ready for a listening question?
 Yes.
 Good.
 Cause this one's for you.
 Okay.
 This one is from Teresa.
 Hello, Teresa.
 She says this question is for AJ.
 I know she started using the Incan Vault Planner in January and I wanted to see how she liked
 it.
 I looked into them recently and saw they had a six month non-date version but also read
 there would be a dated 2018 version released in the new year.
 Which version did you use and how do you like it?
 I love to plan and set goals and I'm very interested in hearing about your experience
 with this planner/general, and if you plan on using one again, thank you.
 First of all, it sounds like Theresa and you are speaking code.
 Explain to everybody who doesn't know what an ink and vault planner is.
 Ink and Vault is a company that released a planner, and it's just, they have two different
 planners.
 One of them has the dates already printed in it, the other one doesn't.
 You can sort of print in the dates.
 And as in planner, you mean like a daily schedule/calendar/ Yeah.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 month, it has like a goals for the month and how you're going to accomplish that and hey,
 journal about this kind of section.
 And then for each week, it says, you know, it breaks it down to what are your goals for
 the week and you check things off that you did get them done or you didn't get them done.
 But there's also like a place where you reflect on what did get done last week or what you're
 thankful for that kind of stuff.
 So I think it's an amazing planner.
 I sort of fell off the bandwagon in May when life got hairy and I was literally looking
 at it this morning and thinking, "Okay, it's time to get, you know, I had sporadic weeks
 during the summer where I used it and I always feel a little bit more put together those
 weeks."
 Right.
 But basically what I do with it is because our whole lives are on our phones, you know,
 on our work calendars and that kind of stuff.
 But what I was doing is on Sundays, I would transfer just that week's worth of information
 and appointments and meetings and whatever.
 I would transfer that all into that week's worth of pages on my planner.
 And for me, that gave me time to think about and meditate on what the week looked like
 and catch anything that wasn't going to work well and even sort of a lot energy for what
 was coming up that week.
 So I don't use it like a yearly planner in that you keep everything for the whole year
 and you're constantly writing in it.
 I transfer from my phone where I put all of my appointments and I transfer that into my
 planner on the Sunday.
 Would you use it again?
 I do.
 Yeah, I want another one.
 So that's what you're going to use for next year?
 Yeah, I love it.
 All right.
 Well, I hope that was helpful.
 Teresa, AJ gives you two thumbs up.
 Whoop.
 Two thumbs up and librarian glasses.
 All right.
 I have a question for you, Mr. Jones.
 Hit me.
 This is from Bethany.
 She says, "Hello.
 I love your podcast and am continually edified by it.
 I've gotten my boyfriend onto listening to.
 He also believes in the Holy Spirit but has less experience in churches and communities
 which exercise the gifts commonly.
 He has questions, some of the terminology you use on the podcast and I don't feel I can
 answer him well.
 Can you explain yours and gray centers' use of the word prophetic in applying to many
 things other than simply prophetic words. For example, prophetic dancing or prophetic worship,
 etc. A second question is like it. How do people mean word? And that's in quotation marks. When
 they use it commonly in your circles, it seems to describe more than just a strictly prophetic word.
 Where did that come from? And is it biblical? I have to say, Bethany, I love these questions.
 I absolutely love them because I grew up in a very very evangelical non charismatic church.
 And when I started going to charismatic churches, I had so many questions about things that were just totally normal to everybody like,
 why do these people have their hands raised in the air?
 Right like I honestly completely confused me.
 Why are those people dancing like when you talk about it looks so happy in church,
 I just didn't, there's so much I didn't understand.
 So I love questions like this.
 There was a bunch of questions in our listener survey,
 like, could you talk about raising hands of worship?
 Could you talk about all this charismatic stuff?
 And I was like, yes, I would love to do a series
 of podcast episodes on that.
 Anyway, to answer your questions,
 and it's a great two questions.
 The first question is, can you explain your use
 of the word prophetic when it's applying to other things,
 other than like a prophetic word?
 So we would talk about prophetic dancing
 or prophetic worship.
 To answer that, I would say that when we talk about prophetic, prophecy can be foretelling
 and it can be forthtelling.
 Foretelling is simple.
 It's telling about the future as the Holy Spirit reveals to you about what's going to
 come next.
 That's the foretelling side of prophetic words.
 There's another side called forthtelling.
 Basically, the Holy Spirit is giving you insight into what's going on in the Spirit realm
 and you're telling forth, so to speak, what's going on in the spirit realm.
 And so when we talk about things like prophetic dance or prophetic worship, like in worship this
 morning, Josh Barsons, who's one of our worship and creative arts pastors along with his wife, Sarah,
 he was playing guitar. And at one point, there was a lull in the service. Jeff Daller, who's our
 senior leader, got up and he said, Hey, this is a sela moment, like in the Psalms, Sela. And
 Josh was playing now. I would say that Josh was playing prophetically and what I mean by that is
 he was playing being led by the Holy Spirit. There was no music there for him to follow.
 Yeah, he's off script as it were for the song.
 Totally. He's just following the Holy Spirit and in that you get a sense of musically what's going
 on in the spirit realm. Now, I know that sounds kind of like airy fairy and but it's, you know, Jeff
 tried his best to use his words to describe what was going on. Hey, it feels like in this moment
 the holy spirit is giving us pause and that while jeff isn't giving a quote unquote prophetic word
 telling us a future event that's going to happen he is explaining with words what's happening
 in the environment and josh was doing a similar sort of thing with prophetic worship so sometimes
 prophetic worship is a synonymous term for spontaneous worship led by the holy spirit sometimes it is
 prophetic in nature in the as it's happening it's making way for the Holy Spirit to do something.
 A great example of this is Josh and Sarah have started a dance team during worship and they're
 not out there all the time. Now here's the thing if you've only been exposed to like a weird middle
 aged woman doing a Calypso dance and her calling that prophetic worship flowy road with a flat
 air or something. We've all seen those people like that god bless her that to me is not like one of
 the best expressions of prophetic dance. If you've seen our worship team online or you've
 been at Grace Center, we have some really, really annoying dancers come out and they're
 dancing as the worship is going on. And for me, when I watch them, it's like this integral
 part of worship and it's prophetic in nature because you've got somebody using movement
 to actually visually demonstrate some of the interplay between what's going on in heaven,
 going on on earth, it's kind of like peeling back in the spirit realm and getting a feel
 for what's happening. So I don't know if that's incredibly helpful description, but that's
 what at least I mean when we're talking about prophetic worship or prophetic dance. Your second
 question is a great question as well. You were talking about how do people mean word when they
 use it commonly in your circles? It seems to describe more than strictly prophetic word. Where
 Where does that come from?
 Is it biblical?
 If you're looking first Corinthians 12,
 verse eight, I mean, all the first Corinthians 12
 through first Corinthians 14, fascinating passages to read.
 But I'm reading from the New American Standard Bible.
 Paul here is talking about the gifts of the spirit.
 And he says this,
 for to one is given the word of wisdom through the spirit
 to another, the word of knowledge according
 to the same spirit.
 And then of course, this prophetic word.
 So let's just take those three things there.
 You've got prophetic words.
 you've got word of wisdom and you've got word of knowledge.
 So again, when we use the term word,
 we're usually meaning some sort of revelatory communication.
 If you think of revelation being an umbrella,
 and under that umbrella,
 there's lots of terms like a word of wisdom,
 which is supernatural wisdom that God gives you
 to help somebody else in a situation.
 It hasn't come by your own strategy,
 your own understanding.
 It's one of the ways that the Holy Spirit has moved through me in the past,
 where I'm listening to somebody explain something, and all of a sudden I have a solution for them.
 It's way above my pay grade.
 There's no way I could have known this would have been helpful,
 or the right thing.
 It's the Holy Spirit giving me a word of wisdom.
 A word of knowledge is information the Holy Spirit gives you about a present or a past event.
 So for example, we've had prophets come to Grace Center,
 And with tremendous accuracy, call out a word of knowledge about somebody's life, perhaps
 their name, their pin number, their date of birth.
 And it's an amazing, powerful way for the Holy Spirit to get people's attention, like,
 "Hey, I know you.
 I know your name.
 I know where you live."
 And then a word of prophecy would be a word either foretelling or foretelling.
 Again, it's one of these kind of generic terms that we use to cover a bunch of different
 things.
 And like I said, it's certainly scriptural.
 You can read more about it in first Corinthians 12.
 All right.
 Well, we want to wrap up by saying thank you to everyone who's filled out our listener's
 survey.
 It is closed now and we'll spend some time chewing through the data.
 And by we, I mean Alan will because that's what he does best.
 Nour delicious.
 Yep.
 Just a nerd-tastic individual you are.
 And then we'll share it with you over the next couple of weeks.
 I read every bit of feedback and loved all of it. Thank you so much for taking the time
 to share your thoughts. Winners of prizes will be notified by email this week. If you've

 And lastly, we have our Heaven declares conference. We announced this morning at Grace Center.
 We're super excited to be having our friends David Campbell all the way from the UK and
 Gary Morgan all the way from Australia.
 David and Gary are dear friends of Grace and I've been with us many times before.
