<p> I'll in an age is podcast for Monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Hey everybody, remember us?<br/>
 Hello.<br/>
 The last time we recorded a podcast was Thanksgiving 2019.
 Wow.<br/>
 It's four months ago.<br/>
 Yeah, four months ago.<br/>
 And you know, people would ask us, hey, where's the podcast been?
 And we would say, uh, life is busy right now.
 But then we thought if we can't get a podcast episode out in a forced quarantine,
 we're all we have to do stay at home.<br/>
 We will have officially run out of excuses.
 Yep.<br/>
 For sure.<br/>
 So we're back.<br/>
 We're back with a vengeance or.<br/>
 Well, we're back.<br/>
 We're back and we're trying to remember how to do this.
 And we'll see how it goes.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 So we've been in our house like many of you for three weeks now and started talking last week
 actually about starting the podcast again because we thought we're home and we could actually do
 it and we do have the time. So we just thought we would give it a shot and then actually a couple
 of you have reached out to me on Instagram and said, "Hey, is there any way you're going to restart
 the podcast. And so the answer is yes.
 Yeah, we're committed to podcasting once a week for the next foreseeable future.
 Because the truth is we are at home. And the other truth is we are probably like
 you like the world is in a little bit of turmoil right now.
 There's something nice about having familiar voices in your ear.
 So I've noticed that like even in my TV viewing, I'm going back to shows I'm familiar
 with. Yeah, I'm watching YouTube videos with people that I am familiar with. And so it's a kind
 of a scary time. We're recording this April 3rd as a Friday night. As I j said, we've been in our
 home for 21 days. AJ's managed to escape like twice twice gone grocery shopping with a mask on
 and gloves and whatnot twice mean the kids have not left the house at all. And we realize that when
 when we reach out to our friends and families around the world,
 every reason a different state.<br/>
 And so some people are like, Oh, I'm so glad to just be at home.
 Some people are loving being with our kids.
 Some people are not enjoying being with our kids.
 Some people have lost their jobs and are freaking out.
 And some people are just stressed and some people, they're worried about
 uncertainty.<br/>
 And so what we wanted to do was we wanted to be a consistent voice for people
 who we used to be a consistent voice to remember that time when we used to put
 out podcasts and every Monday.<br/>
 Yeah, remember when we used to talk to you weekly?
 Yeah.<br/>
 We're back.<br/>
 So we're going to be trying back in part because we want to be a little less lonely.
 We want to be with you as much as we can through this medium.
 And we're hoping that you can feel a little less lonely with us as well.
 So we're going to commit to podcasting just to be with you, especially through
 this season.<br/>
 And then we're going to also try and create some some space to be together
 online.<br/>
 And we'll talk about that in a second.
 Yeah.<br/>
 So if you have listened to us before, which likely if you're following us, you have, you know that normally we would do like a catch up on this is what's happened since the last time that we podcasted.
 But that's a huge window of time. That's like four months worth of catching up. And there's tons of stuff that happened during that time.
 Yep.<br/>
 But we kind of felt like our first podcast back. We don't really want to do that. We want to, and we will, we'll catch you up on a whole bunch of fun stuff.
 But we thought we actually just wanted to say, hi, we're thinking about you.
 We're going to be back in your ears or in your ears.
 Yeah, that's not okay at all.<br/>
 We're going to be in your ear.<br/>
 In front of your eyeballs.<br/>
 So we will catch you out, but just probably not tonight.
 Yeah.<br/>
 What we wanted to do just now was reach out to you and find out how are you doing.
 And of course, this is a one-way medium.
 We're asking you, but we'd love it if you'd reach out to us and tell us how you're doing
 and how we can serve you. What we want to do today though is we want to tell you what we've been doing
 at home. So like these last three weeks, what have we been doing? We want to talk about how you
 can stay connected with us. And we want to point in the direction of some resources that can actually
 get you connected to your heart, get you connected to the Lord, and get you feeling way less lonely
 than perhaps you have been. Yeah. Well, if we're going to talk about the last three weeks,
 Can I talk about my first week at home?
 I'm a little scared. Is it your first week at home when you were homeschooling or your first week at home?
 My first week at home. Okay. I remember that where we go. Well, you were here, but I was quarantined. So that's right
 I<br/>
 We'll talk more about this in future episodes, but I took a team to Israel and
 We of course flew back through Heathrow
 in you know into Nashville and<br/>
 And I got off the plane and Alan was like,
 you are now in quarantine because you've just flown through
 three major airports.<br/>
 And so I spent the first week by myself in my room.
 And I'm not sorry.<br/>
 He's not sorry.<br/>
 But I got to look at my kids from six feet away.
 I had to maintain a six foot distance<br/>
 from my gorgeous children, who I wanted to cuddle very badly.
 And they wanted to cuddle really badly.
 And I wanted to cuddle you really badly.
 I was painful.<br/>
 Yeah, my drift.<br/>
 I think they get your drift.<br/>
 So yeah, that was an interesting first week.
 But I had just spent two weeks with 15 people.
 I mean, 15 amazing people.<br/>
 But as an introvert, it was nice for about the first four days to be with myself.
 And then I was like, I am at, you know, I'm a donkey on the edge.
 So I started negotiating for release from quarantine and got out on day seven.
 It was kind of weird because the whole week.
 So what we've been doing is the first couple of weeks was just all hands on deck with Grace
 and we were helping Jeff and Becky lead our staff in this tumultuous season and set up
 systems to help care for our members.<br/>
 So we were in meetings every day, but AJ would like call in from the bedroom.
 I would call in from the office.<br/>
 And at first everyone's like, are you guys on the same house?
 I'm like, yeah, but she's in quarantine.
 I actually called in from our bathroom because my back went out the day after I got back.
 So my back was out while I was in quarantine by myself.
 And I had to stand to do all the calls.
 And so I stood in my bathroom<br/>
 'cause I had a ledge that was higher.
</p><ul>
  <li>So for us, like the last three weeks being at home,
 we have been in lots of meetings, making decisions,
 almost every hour as stuff has changed.
 This last week things have settled down a little bit.
 Just in time for us to start homeschooling.
 AJ, do you wanna talk about our first three days
 of homeschooling?
  </li><li>Okay, so here's the thing.
 I have never wanted to homeschool ever.
 And I totally respect moms who do it.
 I know I have several friends.
 Yeah, I have several friends
 that are amazing homeschool moms
 and they're super creative and their kids love it.
 It's just, I've really never wanted to do it.
 And so Williamson County sent us a whole bunch of material
 to do with our kids, but it's not easy to understand
 what it is they want us to do.
 It's just, it's frustrating, super frustrating.
  </li><li>Can I tell the story of how frustrating it is?
  </li><li>Just sure.
  </li><li>So at nine o'clock we sit down,
 we print out all the course material,
 ages looking through it.
  </li><li>This is Monday morning.
 It's our first morning trying to home school.
 It's nine a.m.
  </li><li>And nine a.m.
 We're trying to log into Google Classroom and you know,
 et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
 And at 901, M.G. looks at A. James's mummy.
 Frigging is not a word you use in front of the children.
 (laughs)
 I was like, well done, baby.
 Well done, we got up to 901.
  </li><li>I don't even think I made it that long.
 I think it was like 30 seconds in.
 But I feel better because within the next couple of minutes,
 Alan said crap three times while trying to get different
 apps to work on the iPad that are supposed to be so simple
 to sign into.
  </li><li>Let's move on to day two.
  </li><li>I come out and I see the kids all dancing.
 And I'm like, "Aji, what are you doing?"
 She's like, "This is PE."
 But the song she'd picked for them to dance to
 was Rihanna's (beep)
 better have my money.
  </li><li>Which I wasn't completely aware about the language
 that would be present in said song.
 I was just like, "This is kind of beat, let's go."
  </li><li>And day three at 902, Aji was like, "I need a coffee."
 And both our girls were like, "Can we have coffee too?"
 (laughs)
 And then by day forward, we're like, hey, you've been so good.
 You can have the day off.
 No, no, we gave them day five off.
 This is so today, you know, day five, Tia comes to my room at seven for
 cuddles.
 And I was like, Tia, mommy wants to go back to sleep.
 Here's the deal.
 I'm like, if you tell Abby and MJ to be absolutely silent and they don't
 wake us up, then you get the day off school.
 But if anybody's loud screams, turns on the TV and wakes us up, you have school
 today.
 She's like, got it.
 She disappeared.
 I went back to sleep and woke up at 10 past 10.
 She or genius.
 So that's our escapades in homeschooling pray for us.
 It didn't help that we got an email from our principal.
 We got a big long email.
 That part helped.
 But at the bottom, it just said, hey, this schoolwork is entirely optional.
 I was like, why are we torturing ourselves?
 Let's just let our kids repeat a year.
 It'll be fine.
 Because the thing is, I don't know how to do algebra one.
 Like, I don't know how to do it.
 I'm sure I did do it 35 years ago or something, but I don't know how to do it
 And so I feel like there's so much stuff that actually I can't help with so I'm like
 Google it look it up
 Just skip that so yeah, so we're trying to find ways to relax
 I don't know if you follow Ajay on Instagram
 But if you have you've noticed that the way she relaxes is by live streaming cooking videos a bit
 I would imagine that would be
 nerve-wracking. Why is it peaceful for you? It's kind of fun because I love I love cooking
 and I like helping people so I used to teach like this little class with my friend Janine we used to do something called
 operation yum and
 Op yum and what op yum was was we would teach
 Between 15 and 20 women that were all sort of emanate age
 So they're young adults who maybe didn't know how to cook, hadn't been taught how to cook,
 that kind of stuff.
 And we would usually meet at one of our friends' houses who had a great kitchen with a huge
 island that we could all sort of get around and we'd teach them how to do everything from
 like julianning vegetables and dicing things.
 And what does it mean when, you know, just how do you follow different instructions and
 that kind of stuff?
 And then we taught them, each time we'd teach them a different meal that we would make
 all together and then we'd sit down and eat it together and it was super fun and I just
 thought gosh I've actually really wanted to revive that for a couple of years since we
 got our kitchen here because it's big and I thought oh I could probably do this with
 10 people and then I got the idea of well I'm gonna be cooking anyway because I cook
 usually two meals a day and I might as well just go live and teach people how to do stuff.
 So this week I did a healthy chicken soup one day, which is dairy free, it's made with
 coconut milk and all that kind of stuff.
 And then two days later I did a roasted chicken dinner.
 Which was so delicious.
 I'm all in favor of you learning not learning to cook, teaching others to cook because I
 get the spoils of it and it's delicious.
 Yeah, it's the gravy that makes the meal.
 The gravy needs to dive in.
 And I still have some leftover.
 So tomorrow I'll come up with something to use the gravy for.
 I made stock out of it as well, so that got finished today.
 So I'll probably make something tomorrow.
 I don't know what yet.
  </li><li>And then as a family, we found a new video game.
 It's called Animal Crossing.
 And just today I set up my machine
 so I can live stream playing video games.
 So if you'd like to watch somebody else play a game
 where they pretend they're stranded on a desert island
 with animals and you collect wood mostly and butterflies,
 you're welcome to join me anytime I'm online.
 just go to twitch.tv/allonnaj.
 So we're live streaming our hobbies.
 You're live streaming cooking,
 I'm live streaming video games.
  </li><li>Yeah, and I was gonna say actually for the recipes,
 I usually try and post online what you need
 if you wanna cook along with me.
 So you could make the same thing at the same time
 if you wanted to.
 And if you follow me on Instagram,
 you will have seen me post a bunch of pictures
 of different people's versions of soup
 because we made soup together.
 And then I reposted all these pictures
 of all the people that tried to make it, which was really fun.
  </li><li>I love that we're getting to use technology
 to build community and make us all feel less lonely.
 I'm big fans of that.
  </li><li>I'm honestly super thankful.
 Like this is, it's a tricky time.
 And I know that it feels like a lot at times
 to just won't stay home and be happy about it.
 But I'm so thankful that we have social media.
 I'm so thankful for all the devices,
 all the stuff that we have.
 Because again, 10 or 15 years ago,
 this would have been a really different scenario and a lot more isolating.
 Yeah, it would have been awful.
 It would be terrible.
 And so I'm super thankful and I'm trying to just sort of stay on the
 thankful side of things and not think about how much my extroverted side
 wants to see all my friends and hug them.
 So that's a big one.
 If you're an extrovert, I want you to know that we are praying for you.
 I'm high.
 We're both fairly highly introverted.
 So for me staying at home is like a gift.
 And I'm thinking about my extrovert influencer friends.
 I'm thinking about my single X-reverted friends
 where this must feel like a prison sentence.
 We are praying for you.
 We're trying to reach out, trying to connect with you.
 If you need help, please reach out to us.
 If you just need somebody to FaceTime or talk to,
 please, please reach out to your friends
 and to your community, don't be alone.
 The thing I wanted to encourage everybody with is
 is that you're not broken for the way
 you're currently reacting.
 Like it is an unusual time that none of us have ever been in.
 And I want to encourage you to have huge amounts of grace for yourself in this period.
 The other thing we want to do is we want to give you some resources that can help you stay connected to your heart and to the Lord.
 One of the things that grace centers been doing, which I really, really love, is each day, Monday to Friday, our pastors are doing a thought of the day.
 It's less than five minutes. It's a thought, a prayer, it's a Bible, so whatever it is.
 And if you're not following Gray Center on Instagram or on any of our social media networks, I'd encourage you to and every weekday morning, first thing in the morning, one of our pastors goes online and just shares a little thought today.
 Age and I got to do it this week.
 We've had Pastor Tony and Pastor Jeff and I saw Pastor Josh this morning do it as well.
 So get fed first thing in the morning.
 We'd encourage you with that.
 Also, we've been experimenting at Gray Center with providing services like church services.
 Yeah.
 And now that we're all under house arrest, mostly that means that we're streaming from
 Jeff and Becky's house.
 But we're not actually under house arrest in case people think that it's gotten that
 bad in Tennessee, but we've been asked to stay home.
 No, we've been ordered.
 They got ordered from an ask to a governmental order.
 Yep.
 We're now at home.
 We're also trying to think, AJ and I are trying to think about how we can teach resource
 equip or just simply be with people.
 And what we're going to do is this coming Wednesday, which is 8th of April, we're going
 to do just a live hang on Instagram from 3pm to 4pm.
 We'll both be on Instagram, we'll do an Instagram live, we just want to hang out with you, be
 with you.
 We're not teaching, we're not doing anything other than just being present with you.
 So if you would like to do that, 3pm Wednesday 8th of April, follow us at Alan and AJ on
 the Instagram.
 We'll let you know when we go on the gram on the gram. Look at you.
 I'm down with the kids.
 Talk about your other favorite resource that came out this week. Oh, my goodness.
 So my new favorite album, I love, I mean, I love music anyway, and I love
 presence music, like where you can just feel the presence of God on it.
 But Stephanie Gretzinger released a new album this past week.
 And it's so perfect for just the season.
 It's just kind of amazing, but it's called forever amen.
 And I would highly encourage you to download it, press play, and then just
 don't turn it off.
 I mean, leave it on all day long.
 It's so great.
 It's a really great album.
 I agree as well.
 I've forgotten.
 It's so weird because we know we podcast with headphones on.
 We're not podcasts with headphones on because I think after two and a half years
 we know not to go off axis on our mic.
 We hope so.
 We're going to see.
 I've forgotten what it's like to sit next to H in here, her tummy growl all the time.
 I'm sorry.
 Because he had he's had to restart a couple sentences because my stomach just is really loud.
 It's always been like that.
 So it your stomach does grumble out for sure.
 It just it wants to be heard.
 Well, today, all we want to do is we want to get online.
 We want you to hear a voice, see our faces and we wanted to send that an invitation to you to remind you that you're not alone.
 You have a heavenly father who absolutely loves you.
 You have a savior who died for you so that you could be safe and secure.
 And you have a Holy Spirit who would love to comfort you.
 And you have two Scottish Canadian American people who would love to just be with you too.
 Here's what we'd love you to do is we'd love you to join us on Wednesday on Instagram live.
 If you can, if you can't do that, and even if you can do that, we'd still love you to reach out to us.
 Just follow us on any of the social network things that we're on and reach out to.
 Let us know how you're doing. Let us know how we can serve you. Let us know what you would like us
 to talk about on the podcast. We are just looking forward to being with you and helping us all feel
 a little more together in this crazy season. Adrijones, do you want to pray for everybody?
 Yeah. All right. Father, I thank you that you are still on the throne. God, that you are faithful,
 that you are kind, that you are true, that you know all the circumstances that we're facing right now
 and you are present.
 And Lord, I ask that you would come
 and you would just surround each person
 that is listening to this podcast
 or that they would feel your presence,
 that they would know your comfort
 and that they'd know that they're not alone.
 And God, we ask that you would move on behalf of humanity
 and take out COVID-19.
 And Lord, in the meantime, while we wait,
 God, that you would just show us how big you are
 in this season, that we would come out of this season
 just fuller people that are closer to you, that know you better.
 And yeah, God, I thank you that I've found you faithful in every
 season and I will find you faithful here too.
 In Jesus' wonderful name.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 Thanks so much for being with us today.
 Um, I don't know what schedule we're going to do.
 We're going to release this one on Saturday.
 We used to release them on Monday.
 I think maybe we'll move to Saturday.
 Who knows?
 We'll try and do something a week.
 If you're not already following us on social media, please do so.
 You can subscribe to this podcast, wherever you get your podcast from.
 Just look for keeping up with the Joneses.
 And we look forward to being with you again.
 Stay safe, wash your hands, stay indoors.
