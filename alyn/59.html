<p> Mrs Jones welcome to episode 59 of keeping up with the Joneses.
 Thank you sir.<br/>
 Let's keep up with you. How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 You're wearing your beautiful apple watch.
 I am.<br/>
 How are you doing with your green rings?
 Um, well I fell off the wagon with you last week but I'm back with the wagon.
 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br/>
 You pulled me off the wagon.<br/>
 I did know such thing.<br/>
 You forcibly pulled me off the wagon.<br/>
 I feel kind of guilty because I wrote that review on the apple watch.
 And was talking about how amazing it is it motivating me to get my green ring.
 Yeah, and that's absolutely true. But then what did I do? You did a software update.
 I did a software update to beta software, which is completely incomplete.
 And it tanked your watch. It totally tanked my watch. So while my watch is tanked, I am
 having more than a couple of days because there's no point the software has rendered it useless,
 which will serve me right for installing pre-release software. I did warn you. Remember last year?
 You did. No, I just said that wild-eyed look in my eyes and it was just like, "Damn, damn, damn it."
 New software, oh, it must. Oh, oh, oh. And there goes the watch.
 Yeah. It was in dependency. It was. So happy birthday America.
 Yep. 239 years old. Yep. That's not that old. 1776.
 Coming from a country where I'd walk past houses that were older than this nation on my way to work.
 know that July 4 is actually the day that the Constitution was signed and not actually
 the day that they declared independence. Nope. July 2 is the day they declared independence.
 Is that historically accurate? Because that's going to get lodged in my brain and we will.
 That is historically accurate. I wonder if that's going to be in our citizenship test.
 Hard to say. I doubt it. But now I know that piece of information.
 who was our first present, who was our fourth or 16th or 22nd.
 You're going to pass with flying colors.
 It's going to be fine.<br/>
 I had this week, a monumentous occasion happened.
 I mean, it's way up there with the day I got married, the birth of my three children.
 I'm so offended right now because I know what you're about to say.
 It's after about, I don't know, maybe six months worth of hard work and toil
 Concert effort prayer on many occasions. What was my achievement this week AJ Jones?
 I can't I can't after that leg lead in to say what it was. I finished
 Champions Road, which was my final level to be in Super Mario 3D world. Yeah, and it I don't know how many hours
 I've tried to be actually finished are you?
 Well, no<br/>
 No, you're not there's the slight rub. Mm-hmm. I have completed every single level in the game
 game as of this week. And Matt and our 8 year old daughter helped me finish it. There was
 much rejoicing. And then I restarted the Wii just so I could see my congratulations who
 finished the game. But instead it greeted me with 4 shiny stars instead of the 5 I was
 hoping for. And upon further research I realized that in order to get 5 stars to truly 100%
 complete the game. It requires that you play every single level with every single character.
 So I had to replay the game with all five characters, which I managed to do in only 24
 hours. And that's pretty much all you did do for that 24 hours. It is. And that was
 on vacation. So I was allowed to, but I find myself back in the situation where I was
 prior to beating the level in that I have to rebreat it another three times
 for the three characters that haven't played that level.
 So my nightmare continues, but I'm encouraged.
 It feels amazing.<br/>
 Does it, darling?<br/>
 I'm so glad.<br/>
 And I rewarded myself with a bag of lint chocolate.
 Great.<br/>
 Joy leads to joy.<br/>
 Tell me about your week.<br/>
 What was the highlight of your week?<br/>
 Aside from me finishing Champions Road?
 I think possibly one of the highlights of my week was
 I took the kids to the splash pad, the new splash pad in Spring Hill, and MJ's never
 been to one.<br/>
 And so, you know, just stuck his bathing suit on him and he went out.
 He just sort of watched everybody very cautiously, then he went over and put his hand in the
 water and squealed and ran away.<br/>
 And that's what he did for about the first 20 minutes was just touched water and then
 squealed and ran away.<br/>
 And then he started getting really brave and getting really wet.
 That's really brave.<br/>
 He didn't want to leave.<br/>
 to begin with, he wasn't that that chuffed with it, but the girls had great fun.
 If you can hear explosions as we're recording this, it's not our fault. It's the fireworks
 from the Memorial Day weekend. So we're not to blame. I'm sorry.
 It's fireworks from months ago. I'm Memorial Day weekend. He means from Independence Day
 from July 4th. Oh, that's right. I do mean that. Thank you.
 That's okay. I got your back. I got your back.
 Have we told our podcast listeners about your shoulder?
 I don't know actually.<br/>
 Your janky shoulder.<br/>
 I have a janky shoulder.<br/>
 And we don't know what caused your janky shoulder.
 What's the official diagnosis?<br/>
 I have an impingement in bursitis and frozen shoulder.
 I understood one of those things, frozen shoulder.
 What is an impingement and bursitis?<br/>
 I'm not completely sure.<br/>
 Let's move on.<br/>
 I think they're the same thing maybe or there's, I don't know.
 And so you've been a physio or physical therapy as Americans call it.
</p><ul>
  <li>What do they make you do?
  </li><li>All kinds of horrible stretches
 that are horribly painful.
  </li><li>I think I like word association, physio pain.
 My sister's a physio.
 And anytime she try and cool and cool, inspect me.
 If I have a couple of friends who are physios
 and anytime they try to help me,
 they've basically hurt me first.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm, yeah, it's not great.
  </li><li>But you are feeling better.
  </li><li>I'm getting more movement back.
 Yeah, I'm still stuck in certain directions
 where I can't get my arm to move at all.
 you'll be back to playing golf in no time, babe.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm all about the golf.
  </li><li>We are officially off work.
  </li><li>We are.
  </li><li>And we're doing a mix of staycation and vacation.
  </li><li>Yes, we are.
  </li><li>And so this week, I wanted to talk about
 the process of unwinding and resting.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Here's what I would say.
 I think there's a difference between unwinding and resting.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>I think unwinding is something you do
 on a daily, perhaps weekly basis to just help.
  </li><li>To stress and to do.
  </li><li>Yeah, to help counterbalance the busyness
 of the day slash the week.
 I think resting is something different. What do you do to unwind?
 I think to unwind, the main thing that I do right now is go to the gym.
 Really? Because you do like doing that.
 I love going to the gym.
 And talk to me as somebody who's allergic to physical exercise.
 And that's a medical diagnosis. I am allergic.
 That is a lie.
 No, listen, my symptoms when I physically exercise is I become weary, short of breath.
 And I have cramps.
 And you sweat.
 Yeah, like I have like increased heart rate.
 I have what feels like a fever.
 Maybe your allergic to the gym.
 So as somebody who's unable to go to a gym
 because of medical reasons--
 Right, obviously.
 What you tend to love it.
 I do.
 So is that just because you're a mom and there's no children?
 That's some of it.
 I can just get in my head.
 I put my headphones on.
 I usually watch HGTV.
 Like I watch like home renovation shows.
 Oh, I thought it was a Holy Ghost TV.
 Oh, well, they don't have that at the gym.
 Oh, OK.
 But most of it-- or sometimes I just put my headphone in so that people don't bother you
 not that they really do anyway.
 And I just walk in silence or walk around in silence or do the elliptical in silence.
 Here's another difference between you and I talking about unwinding.
 If you're in the car driving somewhere, you have no music on.
 Nope.
 You're in silence.
 If I'm in the car somewhere, I always have either a podcast or music on.
 Do you find having noise music, whatever, doesn't unwind you?
 It doesn't unwind me.
 Well, it kind of depends on the day.
 Sometimes I listen to Johnny swim when I'm driving, but that's about it.
 They're the only people unwind you.
 Yeah.
 Congratulations, Johnny swim.
 You officially online my wife.
 I like to sing along.
 But, but I like silence and I don't feel like I get enough silence in my day.
 So I'm happy to ride in silence if I'm by myself.
 Hmm.
 Rest then, you know, because I've seen there's a difference between unwinding and rest.
 I'd say unwinding is kind of the counterbalance to the business of the day.
 I would say rest is more than just the absence of work.
 I'd say it has to be something that you actively do that nourishes your soul.
 Fred Wright, who was a man I had to sit in a tiny office with and be very, very scared while asking
 if I could date you. So spiritual data of yours, he gave us some great advice years and years and
 years ago. He said, the balance of your life has to be made up of you feeding your spirit,
 feeding your body and feeding your soul. And so he was like, Hey, you know, it's really good that
 you're working. It's really good that you're ministering. But when was the last time you did
 something that nourished your soul and for him it was like golf I think. That would not nourish
 my soul at all. So as opposed to going to the gym which is unwinding, what feeds or nourishes your
 soul? What makes you feel like you again? I think probably creative things. I don't think that I've
 been doing much that's been very nourishing to my soul so maybe I've not prioritized that
 correctly but what I mean other than I love cooking new recipes if there's nobody asking me questions
 if I'm just by myself in the kitchen cooking right that's lovely so when you go out and play
 settlers of katana with people that's a choice you've actively made over doing something else
 does that nourish your soul being with some good friends playing a good board game yeah
 Yeah, that does.
 And you used to paint a lot.
 I used to paint.
 You went through that season of happy animals, happy lion,
 happy giraffe.
 Yes.
 I still, like I think creative things probably nourished
 my soul more than even, like I like being with other people,
 but I think I probably need to figure out stuff for my
 introvert to be nourished.
 You've been illustrating all the pages of your new children's
 book and you can get lost in that for hours.
 Yeah.
 On the one hand, that's work.
 Yeah.
 On the other hand, that's incredibly creative.
 Yeah, it's kind of doing both for me at the moment.
 But does it does it deposit in your drug container?
 I think I don't know.
 Maybe it deposits in a different way to it.
 When I'm finished a page, I'm really happy.
 So I don't know if that counts.
 I think that's got a count.
 Yeah.
 Um, I mean, I used to love photography.
 like I used to love it.
 And especially when you could do dark room stuff,
 I'd stand in a dark room for eight hours a day.
 I would rent extra dark room time and just sniffing
 all those chemicals in the dark.
  </li><li>It was all about the chemicals.
  </li><li>I understand what you're saying.
  </li><li>Yeah, I just want to get high.
 Toxic things.
  </li><li>But now you've got kids.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You just can't spend eight hours in a dark room.
  </li><li>I just can't.
 Nor do I have all the equipment.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Well, it's not called Photoshop.
 We've moved on quite considerably.
  </li><li>I knew what to do in a dark room.
 I don't know what to do in Photoshop.
  </li><li>Oh, come now.
 I've seen your Photoshop work.
 It was beautiful.
  </li><li>Oh, thank.
  </li><li>When we go on vacation,
 as opposed to being on staycation.
 So here's an interesting thing.
 I'm as happy as can be on a staycation.
 You, on the other hand, wanna pull your hair out.
 Talk to me about why is vacation different for you?
 Why is going away somewhere different than being at home
 and not having to go to work?
  </li><li>Well, remember Christine Stroop taught us this course
 and we did these videos.
 Do you remember what the name of the video was?
  </li><li>I do.
 is our personal ministry's pastor, an amazing person at Grace and her and a dear friend
 of ours.
 She was some sort of like understanding women, understanding men.
 Yeah, Allison, somebody rather.
 It was, yeah, anyway.
 Anyway, they talk about how women have diffuse awareness.
 So we're constantly aware of our environment and what's not done.
 Right.
 So for me, if you're, like when you said, "Oh, let's have a staycation."
 I'm like, I'm not gonna rest at all,
 'cause all I'm gonna see is all the things
 that still need to be done at our house
 and everything that's not clean.
 And, you know, so for me,
 that's not gonna be a vacation at all.
  </li><li>Whereas I have singular focus,
 I'm seeing champions road and I'm tuning out the kids
 that are hungry and the baby that needs a diaper changed.
 And the fact that cushions are on the floor
 and the dishes from breakfast from the side,
 which, you know, we're gonna get to later.
 I can just focus and tune all that stuff out.
 And I can't do that at all.
 And apparently that's a theme for women.
 Diffuse awareness.
 It's not necessarily multitasking.
 It's this awareness that's completely diffused
 and you're aware of your whole environment, screams at you.
 The pillows are saying, put me back on the sofa.
 The blinds are saying, straighten me.
 The kids are saying, bath me.
 The countertops are saying, wipe me down,
 all that sort of stuff.
 And so all of that friction and noise,
 which is why you like going to a hotel where we have a maid who does all that for you.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 That makes sense.
 And I don't have to care about the bathroom or the floor or the whatever.
 Yeah, totally.
 I think I'm a simple creature.
 I think you're a simple creature too, baby.
 A cute, but simple.
 Thank you.
 Yeah.
 That's what it says on my resume.
 Allen Jones, cute, but simple.
 In the what unwinds me and what rests me.
 are usually the same things. Just give me solitude. If I can just be on my own, I'm really,
 really happy. I think because we're in the people business and most people interact with
 our extroverted sides. So whether we're on a podcast where we're sharing stuff about our life,
 or whether we're speaking publicly, and we have to be extroverted because a group of people
 listen to us. But the truth is we're quite introverted, both of us. So for me, being on my own is just
 absolutely wonderful. I really, really recharge just being alone. And because I could just read,
 I could fritter around on the web, I could watch videos, I could even just learn stuff. I love
 learning things and growing emerging skill sets. That just makes me very, very happy.
 Or I like playing video games, but I also realize that need to finish things bleeds over into
 normal life. So part of the joy of me staying home on a staycation is there's a bunch of things
 around the house that I would love to do, but don't get time to do during the week.
 So I'm thinking, man, I'd really like to fix that or clean this or paint that.
 And because most of those tasks are like an hour, a two-hour job, I know that I could allocate
 time to that, get that done, and that sense of reward would be there. But then I also find that
 once I've rested and I've had downtime, I actually look forward to being with people.
 So there is that you know, you feed your introvert and your extrovert side comes out.
 I feel the same.
 Is there anything else that keeps you from resting?
 Three children.
 I mean, you just think if you were going on vacation without three children,
 it would probably look real different.
 Like I would get coffee in the morning, grab a book and spend the whole day at
 the pool on a chair reading.
 That would be it.
 And I'd be in the room.
 on the internet.
 In the air conditioning.
 Surfing.
 Talk to me about your revelation about God resting.
 Well, I was thinking when you're talking about, let's talk about rest, that actually
 it's pretty important to God.
 God rested, God set up a Sabbath.
 I think God knows what he's doing when he tells us to rest.
 And we get, we short-circuited, I think, by not resting.
 We short-circuit things God could be doing in us, or even just, I think I'm a better
 person when I'm rested. I'm a better mom, I'm a better wife, hopefully. So I think rest
 is super important. And it's a funny topic for me to talk about because I don't feel
 like it's one I've mastered. I feel like it's one that I'm still like, oh, I need to learn
 about this.
 Right. And sometimes it can seem such a lower priority to rest when there's so much to be
 done.
 Yeah.
 is because my needs in resting are so low, I can kind of rest fairly easily. Because
 what you need to rest is greater than what I need to rest. Like it's pretty frictionless
 for me to rest. I'll just retreat.
 I'd say you do a pretty good job of resting almost every day for some sort of section
 of time. Because you can tune everything out and you do have that ability and I just don't.
 So I often end up going to bed thinking, oh, you know, I don't really think about it actually.
 But when I think about it now, I rarely take time for me unless somebody calls and says
 something like, hey, do you want to come over and do a cotan or whatever?
 And then I'm like, oh, oh, yeah, I'm allowed to do that.
 But I do think as I'm walking out, oh, I'm leaving the house looking like whatever.
 So I don't know.
 I don't know if it's shame.
 Like I don't know if shame says to me, you can't rest right now.
 around you, you can't rest right now, everything isn't tidy and everything's never going to be
 tidy, really. But even though everything's never going to be tidy, I don't know, I still can't
 disconnect from that enough to rest. Now, when we met, you were much better
 arresting when you were on the season. Yes. Do you think that's just because this season has way
 more responsibilities than it did when we first met? Yes. We don't have three children. Yes.
 Because in reality we're at work and then when we're not at work we're maintaining our children until they go to bed at seven yeah and you have to feed them and cuddle them and take care of them apparently i mean they just they don't come pre.
 But once you put them down at seven then we're exhausted she's why you force yourself to go to the gym yes so probably in order to help you we need to schedule some more rest activities probably.
 Yeah, I mean, probably, yeah, we just need to kick our shapers into gear.
 All right, let's kick our shapers into gear. Well, it's good that we're going to be resting
 this week. We are. And on the topic of that, next week, there will be no podcast.
 I'm sorry, but we're taking a week off because we're prioritizing rest.
 That's right. Executive decision just made. Perfect.
 But we'll be back in two weeks time. Do you have time for a listenist question?
 Yes. It's kind of related to what we've been talking about.
 Okay. And this is an anonymous question.
 And it says this, I'm listening to a previous podcast about boundaries.
 I am in a newly appointed leadership position at my church and it is taking up a lot of my time
 on top of already having to work a full time job.
 Well, I'm constantly being asked to fill in here and help there at the church
 in addition to this new leadership position.
 And it's putting a strain on life and my marriage.
 But it's hard to know if I should say no to some things
 because there is a need to be filled in those areas.
 I don't want to dishonor my leadership by saying no, but at the same time, I am stretched
 so very thin.
 Do you have any thoughts?
 I have plenty of thoughts.
 Yeah.
 Can you talk to your leaders and just tell them, "Hey, this is what life looks like for
 me and I totally want to serve you and I want to be available, but the deal is I need to
 prioritize my marriage as well."
 Can you have that kind of a frank conversation and say this is what my full-time job looks like
 this is the you know what I can do and then beyond that I can't do anymore and
 honor my my marriage in my life and money for rest and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, I think there's a
 probably a good thing to sit down with your wife and just drop your priorities for
 this season of life and just work out, you know, what's most important and then anything that falls
 below the line of most important, you just can't do. If you don't draw those priorities,
 very quickly, some priorities will be drawn for you and they might not necessarily be the ones
 that you want. I think too, you want to just stay open to the Holy Spirit and say, like, when
 stuff does come along, sometimes we'll do stuff that would normally be outside of our boundaries.
 But it's like, oh, we really feel like the Holy Spirit's asking us to do that thing,
 but it's the exception, not the rule. Right. I would say in life, in our
 life. Our priorities are marriage. Our kids, obviously the Lord, right? I'm just assuming
 that's a given, but our marriage, our kids, our job. And we're very, very fortunate to have
 leaders that would hold the same values to that. And so, you know, one of Jeff's primary
 rules that would seem is constantly checking on his staff going, are you okay? You know,
 do you have everything you need to come back? Are you taking vacation? Yeah. All that sort of
 stuff and he's very, very good at that. So that's kind of our priorities. Anonymous,
 you're also in luck because we prepared a three CD teaching on this. You don't have
 to have on CD, you can download it as well. Where we answer a lot of questions like how
 do I honor my authority? How do I set boundaries? How do I communicate boundaries? How do I work
 out what I want to say yes to and what I say no to? How do I do that with tact and grace
 and all that sort of stuff? And you can get that at our website at allenaj.com/boundaries.
 But I think it just comes down to a really nice conversation with your leadership about
 staying hate, by the way, I'm volunteering for this.
 And I want to be a team player, but at the same time, I want a marriage and I want my
 kids to grow up loving me and loving the church.
 Can you help me make some decisions?
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Well, we are done for this week.
 We hope you have an incredible week.
 If you're like show notes for this week's episode, go to Alan and ag.com/59.
 Remember there will be no podcast next week as we are going to be on vacation and we're
 choosing to take a week off.
 Yeah.
 But doesn't really love you.
 I so wish you could all hear MJ save vacation.
 It's so cute.
 You should hear him say osteoporosis.
 Even cuter.
 It's really cute.
 He can't say the, sorry, he says, "acation."
 We go on vacation.
 Maybe we'll get him on the microphone for the next podcast.
 Oh, be so funny.
 I know we've got you on tender hooks until then have an incredible two weeks.
 We love you.
 Bye.
 Bye.
