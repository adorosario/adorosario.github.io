<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Welcome to episode two 14 of Keeping Up with the Joneses.
 Where this week, we're gonna be joined
 by Danny and Sherry Silk, but for right now,
 Alan, how was your week?
  </li><li>Our week was great, except we're totally faking it
 because we haven't had a week.
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>Nope, we're recording this the same day
 We released what will be last week's episode.
 True.
 Because of a variety of reasons.
 Anyway, we're recording this Wednesday.
 This is how determined we are to not be late for next week's podcast.
 We're recording it like six days early or five days early.
 And part of that is because you're leaving me again.
 I am.
 Where are you going?
 I'm going to Florida.
 Is it going to be slightly warmer than our frozen tundra that is our basement?
 Yes.
 It's supposed to be between 60 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit, which is lovely.
 Mm hmm and it was so cold today in Nashville that the kids had a snow day and what's amusing about a national version of a snow day there was no snow I mean so it's snowed between six and seven a.m.
 Six and seven a.m. and so I mean very little accumulation but everybody in Nashville freaks out if there is any snow and because it sucked the roads a little bit obviously they're like we're shutting down the buses we're shutting down the schools.
 And if we shut down the buses in the schools,
 we then also shut down the church.
 And so we had a snow day.
  </li><li>Well, even though it's not quite being a week
 since we spoke to you,
 we have had a weekend since we last recorded something.
 And this weekend, Denny and Sherry,
 who are gonna be on the show in just a moment,
 were speaking at Grace and I did a killer job.
 They did a Saturday session and Denny spoke on Sunday,
 as well, the two sessions.
 But today he was supposed to be doing an all staff
 at Grey Center, but because of the snow, they all get canceled. So that was a bit of a moi, moi, moi.
 Yes, sad. But we do have something with him tomorrow still, so that would be great.
 Yeah. Well, thank you for tuning in. Without any further ado, we're going to hand over to us
 earlier in the day when we sat down with Danny and Sherry. So take it away, previous Alan and AJ.
 Welcome to episode 214 of Keeping Up With The Joneses, where this week we've got our friends
 Danny and Sherry silk all the way from, I don't want to say Bethel Church in Redding,
 California, but you're now in Sacramento. Does that matter? To some people it does.
 Geographically speaking, we've got them from California in Tennessee for the frozen tundra.
 Okay. So Sherry, you and Danny are known around the world for teaching on love and marriage and
 relationships. And so we actually thought it might be fun to put you guys to the test a little bit
 with some questions.
 Okay.
 All right.
 Let's do this.
 All right.
 So, Sherry, what is your dream vacation spot?
 Somewhere warm.
 I don't know.
 Hawaii.
 Hawaii.
 All right.
 Question number one.
 What is Sherry's dream vacation spot?
 Somewhere tropical.
 Let's go Hawaii.
 What do you think is the next big purchase Danny would like to
 make?
 Probably outdoor kitchen remodel
 or some kind of gun.
 A bigger tractor.
 Tractors and better tractor.
 Where was your first date?
 We went to lunch at an Italian restaurant in Weaverville.
 The Wrath of Khan, the movie, The Wrath of Khan.
 Trackies, really?
 No, no, no, not trackies.
 Just that movie was just that movie.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 What is Sherry's favorite food?
  </li><li>For lemonade.
  </li><li>For lemonade.
  </li><li>What is your favorite food?
  </li><li>Something I hardly ever eat, bread, bread,
 and more bread.
  </li><li>Bread is a good thing.
 What is Danny's favorite junk food?
  </li><li>Danny's favorite junk food would be peanut M&amp;M's.
  </li><li>Reese's peanut butter stuff.
  </li><li>Okay, so what is Danny's most repeated phrase?
 Like just the he would use all the time?
 You're welcome.
 You know, I'm pretty sure that could have been this week.
 So that's probably right.
  </li><li>What do you think Sherry would say
 your most repeated phrase is?
 Probably what?
 There's an insight that deserves a little bit more,
 a little bit more probing.
  </li><li>Who's better at managing money, you or Danny?
  </li><li>Me.
 (laughs)
 I mean, not 'cause of spending,
 it'd be more like paying attention to what would be on me.
  </li><li>Sherry.
 What is one thing that Danny does for you that he hates,
 but he does it for you anyway because you love it?
  </li><li>Probably quality time listening.
 (laughing)
 Okay, I just hate it.
 But he, he for a not talk and I'm like,
 I would love to, I have needs.
 I have some needs here.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm missing.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>What's one thing that you do for Sherry
 that you hate but you do anyway because you love her?
  </li><li>You talk a lot.
 Yeah, so she wants to talk a lot.
  </li><li>Oh, so you stay present,
 and connect it quality time.
  </li><li>And I just, you tell yourself you're interested.
  </li><li>I do it, but sometimes it's more than I wanna do.
  </li><li>Okay, so then what is one thing that you do for Danny,
 that you hate but you do it for Danny 'cause he loves it?
  </li><li>Hate is such a strong word actually.
  </li><li>I know, okay.
  </li><li>You dislike or it requires effort.
  </li><li>Driving fast in the car with Danny.
 So you're driving, he's driving, he's driving,
 and you dislike it.
  </li><li>And I don't like driving fast.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But you just, what?
  </li><li>Don't do it.
  </li><li>Don't say anything, just no.
 I usually just get on my phone.
  </li><li>Try not to pay attention.
 Okay, you're not gonna die.
  </li><li>We're not gonna die, we're not gonna die.
  </li><li>Which room in the house does Sherry want to renovate next?
 Our bathroom.
  </li><li>It would definitely be my bathroom bedroom combo.
 What's the one thing in life that frustrates you the most?
  </li><li>That's kind of on par with the hate question.
  </li><li>That's a lot of them.
  </li><li>What is one thing in life that frustrates you?
  </li><li>Clutter, yes.
 I don't do well in clutter.
  </li><li>Injustice.
 So what I got you here, Danny,
 known around the world for your great thinking,
 for strategy, for helping leadership teams think,
 for helping people transition change.
 When you look, or when I look at the transformation
 that Bethel is making around the world,
 this huge global impact,
 you think about Bethel music,
 Bethel publishing, Bethel for church,
 Bethel conferences, Bill Johnson, Chris Voutin,
 yourself, the school,
 just this massive thing that's having this huge impact
 on the world.
 I remember the first time I came out to Reading,
 and I don't know how to say this delicately,
 but I was expecting Reading to have the impact
 of New York City or Dallas, Texas, and I get there,
 and I'm like, this is kind of like a really small town,
 stuck somewhere in the early 70s.
 And then as I listen to you start talking about Weaverville,
 where kind of the birthplace of everything happened,
 which is an even smaller little town,
 I'm thinking you guys must have had to,
 At some point, change your mind from, I don't know,
 what you want to call it, small-town thinking,
 to start thinking that God wants to use you globally.
 Talk to me about that journey of thinking about
 that this little church in Weaverville
 could have the global impact it's had all over the world.
  </li><li>Well, since we met Bill Johnson back in late '70s,
 that's when he arrived in Weaverville,
 he started saying things like,
 Weerville is the center of the universe.
 And by that, he meant that he didn't want
 our little life experience to keep us small-minded.
 He was talking about Africa.
 He was talking about the impact that you make in Hollywood.
 He was talking about the economic difference
 that we could make.
 And we all shaken our head like, what is he talking about?
 So you had no grid for what he was talking about.
  </li><li>Well, we're from, we were both 3,500 people.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>In a mountain valley, literally,
 we are isolated, we're the real deal.
 It's not a suburb of something.
 It is a, it's the county seat.
 You know, it's a destination
 for the people that live in that area.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So he very quickly began to teach us
 about how big God is,
 how much to expect from being a believer,
 and to think about legacy,
 to think about investing your life in covenant,
 and then making a difference with your legacy.
 So it's been quite the tutelage of Bill Johnson,
 and really all I did was just prepare us
 for what we'd be stepping into decades
 before we ever stepped into it.
 So would you say you guys had the mindset ever before you saw the reality of what the mindset was needed for?
 Like you were already thinking big before the bigness of what you were doing came into reality.
 Yeah.
 It very much was a wealth mindset in a poverty context.
 And so we were we were we were tutored by a king.
 You know, I mean, a king got exiled to Weerville.
 Kind of like Moses, you know.
 Moses was raised in Pharaoh's house,
 but he had to talk to a bunch of slaves.
 And eventually, you know, he talks him into,
 let's get out of here.
 And so that's kind of like what we built it.
  </li><li>I remember being with John on it.
 We were, I think we were in Wales
 and we just finished this revival night.
 John and Kyle prayed for everybody.
 There's just bodies all over the floor.
 Heaven's come down.
 It feels amazing.
 It's glorious.
 There's healings and miracles.
 And after the service, I don't know, it's like midnight.
 We all go back to where we're staying.
 And as they're having a cup of tea
 and eating some peanuts before they go to bed,
 I said to John, almost like a throwaway statement,
 almost as an expression of astonishment.
 I said, "Oh, John, did you ever think
 "you would see the day where this is
 "what your life would be like?"
 And he sharpened by his answer.
 And he said, "Yeah, yeah, I really did."
 And I guess the question I want to ask you, Danny,
 is when you think about moving from Weaverville
 to Reading to now you literally,
 I mean, you spent 200 days last year,
 more than 200, more than two thirds of your year
 in the nations, is this what you thought you would be doing?
 Like, does it look like Bill trained you to think
 like it would look?
 Well, the way, actually, how it's happening and what it looks like now, I don't think any of us,
 I think we all had an inkling really that it was going to take us to the globe,
 take us to the nations. But I think that we've thought more like missions trips to the middle
 of a desert somewhere or a jungle or something. I don't think any of us really thought about
 the impact of that writing books and speaking of conferences and meeting with leaders and
 the high leverage relationships that we have today, I don't think that any of us anticipated
 that. We didn't really have that language. We didn't have that. Did you ever think you would
 meet an alien? Like, no, I didn't know. At some level, it does feel like we're living an alien life.
 Every once in a while, I'll catch my glimpse, my reflection in a mirror or someplace in
 how this shakes my head and go, "Can you believe the life that you are living right now?"
 There's a theme all the way through Scripture, all the way through life. God meets us with who we
 are, we meet Him with who we're not. You just see it. Every Bible character, the Lord comes to
 Saul through Samuel, prophesy. "I'm the least of all the tribes, and my family's the smallest,
 and I'm nothing. And time, time again, you know, I'm not a mighty warrior. I'm hiding here in this
 winepress. What was your own journey of understanding your leader was global impact? Like, do you
 wake up at the moment? Like, ah, I'm Denny Silke. I'm kind of influential. Like, how did that journey
 and did you have to fight that? Were you insecure? Did you just have to get over yourself and just
 listen to your prophetic words and just say, all right, bye. I am who God says I am. Talk to me about
 that internal journey for you?
  </li><li>I think what happened is my outside kept changing,
 but my inside didn't change that much.
 So I get to be the same guy everywhere I go,
 no matter who's around me or what's happening outside of me.
 I'm not totally thrown by who's sitting in front of me
 or who's there or who's asking the questions
 or what town I'm in,
 or where I'm not generally changed by the way
 changed by what's out there. I do realize that inside what's changed is the value for
 what has become normal to me by the people outside of me. I just didn't realize that
 not everybody had the same culture, the same experience, the same perspective or understanding
 that I grew up in. I just grew up in this. So to find so many people that have so much
 value for what feels very normal to me is it allows me to be myself everywhere I go and
 to be really happy to meet with people and keep giving it away because I love it.
 What are three things you wish you could tell every mom before they have kids to kind of
 set them up to succeed. I would say give yourself a break. You're going to be
 tired. You're going to make mistakes. Yeah. And maybe being able to check out
 from the situation like, oh, it's all chaos right now. Just let it be. Just let it be chaotic.
 Put the stuff down. For me, I was like, I'm very, I like order and structure. So I would get
 anxious around my house getting messy or not getting something done I wanted to or and I would my anxiety would increase and
 And then I'd be frustrated and and I'm getting that all over everybody. So just chill out
 Chill out for sure. I can definitely relate to that. Yeah, and I we were pretty broke when we had little kids so
 Finding ways to do fun stuff or or take good care of yourself is hard sometimes when you don't have any money
 So I would do, there are people that can help you though.
 You probably have a friend that has a teenage daughter
 and they would come over maybe once a week on Tuesday
 from during nap time.
 And I would drive to the end of the road with the newspaper
 and I would sit in my car and read the newspaper
 just because no one stopped.
  </li><li>I didn't interrupt it.
  </li><li>Nowadays I'd have my phone,
 but it's just like, just don't look at it
 like a huge obstacle, just kind of figure it out,
 find some time for you, it doesn't have to cost much money.
  </li><li>You were at Grace and I this weekend,
 doing a conference or doing a mini conference, I guess.
 You said this fascinating thing between you
 and Sherry's parents or parental units,
 there's 15 marriages.
 You talk a lot about the friction that you and Sherry had
 early on in your marriage.
 That's a whole lot of brokenness.
 And now you're known around the world
 for emotional and relational health, healing and robustness.
 A whole lot of transition has to happen from,
 from this kind of model of brokenness,
 your own experience to the relational health you
 teach on and model.
 What was that trajectory like?
  </li><li>Oh, how you know, I think that
 coming into a relationship with Jesus
 was the transformative work.
 I mean, I'm one of those guys that the day I got saved,
 my life dramatically changed.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So I credit so much of what's going on in my life today
 and the foundation I stand on with just that transformation.
 And then the gift really of being around people
 who loved each other, who had, you know, like the Bill and Benning had five and six generations
 of ministers, you know, their family, our ministers, their children, all our children are ministers,
 and you're like, what is the deal? What is that? And so tapping into that brought some kind of an
 inheritance into my life through the honoring of a father and a mother, I get in on that.
 So I feel like I got accelerated, Sherry got accelerated.
 And then we just turned our very bullheaded humans.
 And so we weren't going to let go.
 We just weren't going to let go.
 We're still not going to let go.
 We're just absolutely going to work it out.
 And I think that's probably the key is, is we're just going to work it out.
 But with divorce and remarriage as a model that was available to you, like that had been
 modeled for you, you think it was A, your salvation experience, and then B, being in this culture
 where people modeled a completely different option for you.
 You changed that kind of bullheaded thing to we will make it work rather than piece
 that I'm done.
 Yeah, we had an option.
 I had an option that none of my family members had.
 They could only endure until it ended
 and I get to endure to the end.
 And so it's an option that nobody in my family
 or Sherry's family really ever had offered to them
 and we both took it.
  </li><li>What do you wish you could tell every grandparent
 when they're starting out that would help them
 with their grandparents.
  </li><li>Miss.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I think one of the lessons I can tell a little story.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So one of the lessons I learned
 around the bat was,
 Brittany came over and she had Delaney
 and Delaney was about two.
 And she said, "We cut her bangs."
 I said, "Absolutely, 'cause I used to be a hairdresser
 "a long, long time ago."
 So I cut her bangs.
 And then a few months later, I was watching her again
 and her bangs were getting long.
 So I cut her bangs again.
 And Brittany came to pick her up and she looked at her and said,
 "Did you cut her bangs?"
 I said, "Yes, I did."
 And it was this revelation, like I was trying to be helpful.
 Right.
 But I went over my line of where, you know,
 you're not the parent, you're the grandparent
 and you don't get to make those decisions,
 even though you think you're trying to be helpful.
 So Brittany and Ben were very young and they got married.
 So you're still in that mom mode for me.
 I was in that mom mode,
 But just learning that you're a support,
 you're in a support role, you're not the main person.
 And to just accept that, they're gonna do things different.
 It's okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, so Janet's there's to do different.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Last question, and I love that I get to ask these questions,
 is what is the lesson, the personal lesson
 that's taking you the longest to learn?
 Probably that more is not necessarily better.
 I think that my personality and my,
 whatever is inside of me always thinks that,
 you know, if two's good, then four's twice is good.
 And if I got there last time in a day,
 then I think I can get there this time in 12 hours.
 I just think that it's, I'm always going too far too often and I need to really just be
 present, be happy with where I am.
 I'm not a super ambitious guy, but at the same time I do love a huge adventure.
 I do love a huge amount of something.
 And can you pinpoint like events or situations that help you learn that lesson?
 Like is it a type of thing where you hit the wall and go like, I should probably learn
 that I can't go that far that fast?
 Or is it people speaking into your life?
 Like what helped you see the light?
 Probably just thinking that I'm invincible.
 Oh, that little chest.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 and thinking that I can just eat whatever I want for as long as I want. I can do whatever I want.
 I'm going to stop, bro. I don't want to hear that. Let me just stay in my denial for a little bit
 longer. So I'll have an extra part. I have an extra piece of that. I'll go for the best piece of that.
 I'll do that every day.
 I think I've been learning that there's a certain maturity that comes with moderation
 in my life.
 I'm going to stop you, brother.
 I don't really want to listen to this part of the world.
 I race cars, I hunt large animals, I have a huge appetite for more.
 And so being present, it's getting easier to do because my life is changing, my body's changing,
 my endurance levels are changing, and I have grandchildren. I think grandchildren really
 help me enjoy the now more than ever, you know, not be not be
 anticipating what's coming and going and getting it and planning
 it out and spending all my time in the how how's this going to
 happen? When's this going to happen? Wouldn't it be great
 when it happens? And just enjoying the right here right now.
 That's beautiful all around me. Beautiful.
 Okay, so last question.
 You are working with people that dream big
 and they think big and you are more of a planner
 implementer type person.
 So how do you manage working with the dreamers?
  </li><li>Well, it's a process in my life for sure,
 but what I had to learn to do was to not get overwhelmed
 by their dreams and not be the no,
 like don't be the no in the dreamer's life.
 So I could, because I see problems,
 I naturally see obstacles, that's how God made me.
 But when we're in dream mode,
 I don't need to bring that to the table.
 I can do all that later.
 I can get the team from point A to point B for right now.
 Let's just listen to the dreamers talk
 and not be the big fat no.
 And my critical eye, just not pointing that at people.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Point it at the problem or the system or whatever,
 but don't use my critical eye for people.
  </li><li>That's good.
 I think that's super helpful for me.
 I am pretty high shaper planner person.
 And when Alan calls Blue Sky Dreaming Meetings,
 I will just be like, you know,
 well, yeah, but that can't work.
 So like, take that off the list of things
 that we're dreaming about because, you know,
 and he's like, I don't think you understand
 what we're doing here.
 So yeah, it's good, it's good of a reminder.
 Well, thank you for your wisdom.
  </li><li>One of the things I'm most excited about
 is when I see people embrace technology
 in a really, really beautiful fashion for the kingdom.
 And I guess maybe two years ago, a couple of years ago,
 you started the Loving On Purpose Life Academy,
 which is this amazing resource
 that people from anywhere around the world
 can tap in and sit with you,
 teaching them face to face on a variety of topics.
 Talk to me about where that came from,
 what your vision was and how that's going.
  </li><li>Well, it's kind of tied to the more is better.
 I started traveling 200 days a year,
 thinking that more is better and it's not.
 It's actually worse.
 it's worse on so many levels.
 You know, I'm exhausted, my body's hurting,
 my missing my family, it's just on and on and on.
 So we decided to really put our efforts
 into what we thought was coming,
 which would be the use of online media.
 So we've transferred everything that I've ever said
 into some form of an e-course,
 and we continue to do that.
 We unroll about three a year.
 And it's been phenomenal.
 I mean, we presently have over 10,000 students enrolled.
 We are, we have an online community of folks
 that are just getting to know each other
 while they get to know this culture and these skills
 and this way of seeing themselves and God and relationships.
 And I was super excited about just,
 my daughter is now very involved.
 She handles the whole family end of what we do.
 So we have family relationships and leadership training.
 She's coming on with the family stuff.
 And she will soon take over the relationship stuff
 and then her husband right along with that.
 And then we have this whole group of people
 called Love Champions that are coming on
 and filling up all these e-courses.
 And as well, you know, going around and doing conferences
 and building their own communities.
 And it is a movement in many ways.
 And that's coming out of this online material.
  </li><li>And give me the URL so I can put it up on the screen.
 Where do people go to find out more information?
  </li><li>Just go to lovingonpurpose.com
 and you'll find the Life Academy there.
  </li><li>And I'll put a link in the show notes
 to people who are listening to this in your ears
 right now as we're driving.
 But when you think about like an online course,
 there's a danger that can sound sterile
 disconnected, but it really isn't. You're a super engaging speaker. The resources are
 produced with just top notch excellence and they're really, really transformational.
 Yeah, tons of great feedback about people's experience.
 Danny, Sherry, thank you so much for being with us. Where can people find you on the
