<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones.
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Welcome back to episode 79 of keeping up with the jones is thank you.
 Our regular programming continues.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Although last week's programming was pretty fantastic.
 I did have a lot of people come up to me say your kids are so cute.
 They are.<br/>
 For those of you who don't have a clue what we're talking about, if you go to AlanAJ.com/78 last week, our kids took over.
 We took a week off for Thanksgiving break.
 It was very cute.<br/>
 According to MJ, it's about Jesus.<br/>
 And according to, well, it's not worth going into.
 Maybe don't listen to it, but my favorite part was where Tia said about the fee.
 What's the fee you said?<br/>
 And she said, I don't know.<br/>
 Well, what's the name of the song that she's actually singing?
 My country is of the.<br/>
 And she thinks it's called my country, Tis a fee.
 Yeah. So I said, what's the fee?<br/>
 She's like, I don't know.<br/>
 And she just went into song.<br/>
 So that was your early Thanksgiving present. For those of you who are not from America,
 Thanksgiving seems to be like a dry run for Christmas. It shares a lot of similarities,
 except for gifts. That's the weird thing. So all your families get together, you eat turkey,
 and you're thankful is the gist. As somebody who's new to America, relatively new,
 I'm catching up on all the vacations. I think it's like a celebration of the harvest.
 It's the time of year and the harvest would have come in.
 That kind of thing.<br/>
 There's no way the harvest came in November.
 Well, in the south there is really.<br/>
 That's why it's in October, early October in Canada.
 OK, you have to bring Canada into everything, don't you?
 We're talking about an American hold and you bring in Canada.
 We have it too in Canada.<br/>
 I just want to say that.<br/>
 Go ahead.<br/>
 No, go ahead.<br/>
 We went to Canada.<br/>
 OK, go ahead.<br/>
 Sorry.<br/>
 We went to North Carolina to be with my sister and her family.
 Yeah.<br/>
 It was really good.<br/>
 They're tremendous hosts.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 They looked after us, basically they fed us and let us sleep,
 which is pretty much what we did.<br/>
 They understand the need for cheese.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 So basically, I slept most of the vacation.
 You slept a lot of it.<br/>
 Which was great.<br/>
 And then second to sleeping, we watched a lot of movies.
 We did.<br/>
 In the best armchairs ever.<br/>
 It's hard to overstate just how awesome those armchairs are.
 Yes.<br/>
 They're like power reclining.<br/>
 The other style.<br/>
 Yeah, exactly. Yeah, they were absolutely luxurious. So we love that.
 And Cass and Ben, thank you. You guys did such a great job
 in hosting us and feeding us and making sure that our kids got to
 play with your kids while we slept.<br/>
 And we had s'mores.<br/>
 We did and Ben, it should know is the fire starter.
 Yes.<br/>
 He did a very good job at making lots of fires.
 He's almost Canadian. Sorry. I had to throw that in there too.
 Canadians are known for starting fires.
 Of course. They're in the North. They have to be able to start a fire.
 They would have died the entire race.<br/>
 That's how I figure it.<br/>
 But if you ask Abby and Tia what their highlights were, they're like the s'mores.
 Yeah.<br/>
 They love that.<br/>
 And they were great.<br/>
 We drove there and back and they were completely fine.
 It's amazing.<br/>
 MJ is at the stage though, where he asks how much longer and he asked about 15
 minutes into a seven and a half hour drive.
 Mommy, how much longer?<br/>
 I was like, oh, dear.<br/>
 Talk to me about your iPad Pro because last time we talked, you got your iPad Pro,
 but you didn't get the pencil or the keyboard, but we rectified both of those problems.
 Give us your review of the iPad Pro and its paraphernalia.
 I love it and it's paraphernalia. It is very big. So it's almost the same size as my laptop.
 Right. But it's not very heavy.<br/>
 No, it's not heavy at all. And in terms of being able to do art, because I do most of my art
 stuff in Procreate, it's amazing. And the pencil is, it's so good. It's so fine. I wish I'd had it
 when I was putting the book together because it would have made it easier.
 Well, on the topic of that, you've been illustrating a book for a year, maybe?
 Yeah.<br/>
 A year. And so you were previously using just a Bluetooth stylus from the company 53.
 And you're using that not in the 53 app, but in the Procreate app.
 And so you've illustrated a book, you've done several months worth of work. Compare the Apple
 Pencil with the 53 Pencil. Oh, there is no comparison whatsoever. I would never think about getting
 the 53 Pencil if you have an option to have the Apple Pencil. Would you only have the option to
 have the Apple Pencil if you have an iPad Pro currently? Right, at the moment. But I mean,
 it's just so much better. It's hard to even... There's no comparison. So thumbs up for the Apple
 pencils. We also found the Apple keyboard. We were in North Carolina, went to the Apple
 store, of course, and they had two on the shelves, and they were shot there, she had only stock,
 so we picked one up for you. What do you think of the keyboard?
 It's great. It feels great. You could spill your coffee across it. I mean, not that you would try,
 but you could, and you'd be fine, because it's all rubber.
 Is there anything that you are finding yourself you can't do on the iPad Pro that you need your
 MacBook Air for?<br/>
 I don't know because I haven't tried to work with it yet because we just got it when I went on vacation. I'm not trying to do work
 out of girl<br/>
 Yeah on vacation. So I might have to answer that at a later time, but so far two thumbs up so far two thumbs up
 Fantastic. Yeah, well this week has been Thanksgiving as we were mentioning and
 Apparently it's a tradition where if we go from the table says what they're thankful for we didn't do that
 Did we I don't remember? Yeah, I don't think we did that
 No, I don't think so.<br/>
 I thought, it's interesting I was speaking on brain science before we went on vacation.
 Yeah.<br/>
 A bunch of research had done, especially in the area of neuroplasticity.
 Dr Caroline Leif said this, "When you are thankful, your brain releases nerve growth
 factors that help change the brain."<br/>
 Isn't that amazing?<br/>
 That's very amazing.<br/>
 I thought we could put that into practice, and we could practice being positive people,
 and actually saying what we're thankful for.
 a couple of ground rules. Usually when you ask this question, what are you thankful for?
 The go-to answers are things like my family, I'm thankful for Jesus. And I'm not saying
 that there aren't things you should be thankful for or that they're not the health things to call
 out. But let's just say that they are given that we're thankful that we have food and oxygen
 and a relationship with Jesus and a healthy family. Again, I'm not demeaning those things.
 They are amazing. We're very, very grateful for them. Let's add to that list.
 Let's add to that list. And of course, those are things that we're very, very thankful for.
 But A.J. Jones, I want to hear three things from you. And I've got three things
 that you were thankful for. Ladies first, what do you think for?
 Number one would be grace and error. Oh, good choice. Yes.
 Yeah, I'm just super thankful for everything from the value for the presence of God to who we work with, to
 the worship, just the value on healing of the heart. And I love, I love, love, love our church.
 And I think because Grace and her is such a huge part of our world, because we work there,
 our friends mostly go there, that kind of stuff. I just love an environment like GC that is
 so for people and for God and for healing and is full of hope. It's just really, really good.
 Yeah, you're kind of blurring the edges there because your number one and my number one are
 fairly similar. The thing I hand down for number one was the staff that we get to work with.
 Right. And similar to what you said, it's a huge privilege if you can enjoy your work. But
 what about if you enjoy not only the work, but the people you work with? Yeah. And I just,
 I'm so thankful for our staff. You know, Jeff and Becky, who lead the church,
 I don't know leaders like them. I don't know leaders that are so
 not intimidated by other people who are so content to let other people shine, who are so gracious in
 the way they think about other people and the way they think about their staff.
 The only time that Jeff and Becky are on our case is about if we're working too much.
 Yeah, I mean, they are amazing.<br/>
 The biggest conflict we have with our boss is, "Are we working too hard?" That's a wonderful
 position. Are we making sure we have enough time to ourselves and thanks?
 Yeah. And this is where we get into danger of if I mention names, then the people's whose names
 I don't mention may feel left out and I don't want to go down that track. But I think about the
 staff we work with on a daily basis and it's an absolute joy. We couldn't do what we do without
 the staff that we have. No, and it's fun. I mean, we get to go into work and it's fun. Like,
 I look forward to driving in and working, which is awesome.
 We're in this fortunate position that we frequently get compliments, either by M&amp;A or by the school,
 or things that we have responsibility over. And the danger is that people would think that it's us
 that have contributed to the brilliance of that. And it's really not. It's our staff.
 Yeah, we have an amazing team.<br/>
 The staff we work with, the staff we work for, the staff we work for us.
 It's an incredible team. And we get to do what we do because we have an amazing team of people who
 love the presence of Jesus, who value our culture and our community so much that they're
 prepared to go after their stuff, who are exceptionally competent and brilliant and
 just love Jesus. So I love being part of a team. I think when I was younger, everybody was
 here. What do you want to do? I was like, I don't have a clue what I wanted to do when I grew up.
 All I knew was I wanted to be able to go to work and work with brilliant people and get to where
 what I want.<br/>
 We've been both of those things in the head.
 Everybody at Grace Center, we are very thankful for you.
 Just tremendous staff and it makes our job an absolute dream come true.
 It really does.<br/>
 It really does.<br/>
 What was your number two?<br/>
 My number two, which is funny for Canadian, is living in America.
 Talk to me about that.<br/>
 Well, I mean, I guess most nations are fiercely patriotic.
 Right.<br/>
 But, I mean, growing up, I was, and I still am, was so proud to be Canadian.
 You know, I was just, I loved any place I traveled.
 I've seen many, many nations, but I just love that I'm Canadian.
 And having said that, I live in America.
 We've lived here almost seven years now.
 And I'm so thankful for America.<br/>
 I'm thankful for Franklin, Tennessee.<br/>
 I love where we live.<br/>
 I love everything from just the fact that we don't have feet of snow every year.
 Amen.<br/>
 To, you know, just we're in the middle of rolling hills and, you know, it's mostly green all
 year round.<br/>
 I don't have to.<br/>
 I don't own a winter jacket.<br/>
 You know, like I could use one for a week or two a year, but that's not really worth
 it.<br/>
 You know what I mean?<br/>
 So I love that in the grocery store, people are nice to each other and you know, the whole
 Southern hospitality thing.<br/>
 And yeah, I love living here.<br/>
 It's funny because when we started dating, I'd felt like the Lord said that I was going
 to end up in America.<br/>
 And I knew that you were fiercely proud to be Canadian.
 And not that Canadians have this intense rivalry with America by any means, but I knew that
 you so loved Canada.<br/>
 I was wondering, like, how is this going to work out?
 And I remember one day we weren't even married yet.
 So I think we were engaged.<br/>
 I think we were engaged.<br/>
 We were engaged.<br/>
 And I just flow the idea past.<br/>
 You're saying, babe, you know, I just wonder, have you given any thought to where we end
 up?<br/>
 Like I just, when I pray for that Lord Singlet, we're going to end up in America.
 And you're like, oh, yeah, I've known we're going to live in America for years.
 I was like, "Oh, bonus, that was easy."
</p><ul>
  <li>Well, I think I started falling in love
 with America slowly when I would go and visit Holly
 in Florida.
 It's not hard to fall in love with Florida.
 But I started, and then as I would travel
 into the States to different parts,
 I just, there's something that always felt like home
 no matter where it went in America.
 And so that to me was interesting.
 It is funny that we ended up in a place we didn't know existed.
 Yeah.
 Like if if someone was going to give us a map of Americans, a big
 place to live, it seems to say we didn't even know what was in Tennessee.
 No, never been to Tennessee before we moved here.
 And I just love that we live here.
 I don't pine for anything else.
 Yeah, me too.
 So that's your number two.
 That's my number two.
 What's your number two, baby?
 My number two, I'm probably going to get grief for because it's a little broad.
 And it may be a little stereotypical for me as a nerd to say this, but I'm genuinely
 thankful for the internet.
 I know that that's probably like I'm thankful for electricity or I'm thankful for fresh air,
 but my whole life is dependent on an internet connection.
 Your whole life?
 My whole life.
 I mean, all the way you exist.
 The parts of life that I enjoy most require an internet connection.
 And this week I found tremendous joy whether I picked up my iPhone or my iPad or my laptop
 or even my wristwatch. I loved that all my media came with me no matter which device I'm on,
 all my music is there, all my movies are there, my books that I'm reading are there, all my notes,
 all my work. I love the removal of friction in having access to stuff that I value.
 So for example, my Bible is on every device I own, all my notes from my Bible, all the highlights,
 all the marks, all the comments. I love that. I love that I have got almost instant access
 to learn anything I care to learn. That's remarkable that I can watch a couple of YouTube
 videos and know about calligraphy, for example, or know about how to edit in Logic Pro, or
 you know, just all these it lowers the barrier of learning, of understanding things remarkably.
 And so I, you know, just this week, I was incredibly grateful for the fact that we could
 watch movies on my sister's TV that I had bought a couple of days before that were
 streaming from the cloud.
 So this whole infrastructure that I love, the fact that you're listening to this podcast
 only exists because of the internet, right?
 I love this.
 I don't want to sound like a hippie here, but I love the barrier of entry that is so
 low for anybody to be a publisher or a writer, an author, a movie maker. I just love that.
 I think it's incredible. My life has been greatly enriched because of internet technologies,
 whether it's the web, whether it's cloud services. I just got unlimited storage from
 Amazon.com for $5.
 Amazing. Do you know what I'm going to do with that?
 What? Well, the first thing I want to do, we cleaned out our garage yesterday.
 Yes, we did.
 I can't believe I say garage.
 We cleaned out our garage.
 Gottage.
 We did.
 We cleaned out our garage yesterday and I came across a whole load of old DVDs
 of archived home movies and stuff like that.
 And I thought, I'm that's what I'm going to do with terabytes of space,
 petabytes of space.
 It's unlimited storage.
 What's a petabyte?
 A petabyte is a thousand gigabytes.
 So there's bytes, megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes, and then petabytes.
 Then x about the bites you joking brawn to bites and gia bites brawn to bite yes wow.
 Okay well see i've learned something new to me married a nerd so there you go yet big surprise Alan loves the internet but i'm genuinely
 It's a real shocker.
 If anybody should be thankful for the internet, it's you.
 I truly am.
 You are.
 I think it's amazing.
 Yes.
 Thank you.
 Al Gore.
 All right.
 Number three.
 Number three.
 Friends.
 I, uh, Oh, great.
 I go for the internet and you are for friends.
 Well, I'm a social creature.
 All right.
 Hang on.
 Hang on.
 Yes, the internet allows me to stay in contact with my friends.
 Okay, texting face time phone calls is texting really over the internet.
 Yeah, I message.
 Okay, I thought I was texting from my phone from like a cell thing.
 Yeah, but you're adorable.
 Keep talking with friends.
 Okay, so friends, I'm just, I'm, I guess I'm thankful for the internet as well.
 I'm thankful. I have friends literally all over the world that are amazing and that even
 though we hardly ever see each other anymore because we don't really travel, they're still
 family. They're still amazing. And then I have friends here that are just stellar people.
 So I'm just really thankful that the Lord heard my cry for friends and for relationship
 and answered it with the people that he has answered it with because I'm thankful for
 them.
 He gave you friends, he gave me the internet.
 See, he gives us what we need.
 Hey, did we discuss on the podcast, on the topic of internet?
 Sorry to just hijack your friends.
 I was doing something sentimental and now we're back to the internet.
 But to be fair, to be fair, this is important and impressive.
 I am waiting.
 Did we tell our podcast listeners that we now have Gigabit internet?
 Yes.
 I'm pretty sure we did.
 Okay.
 Well, even if it's worth knowing again, we have fiber to the desktop.
 I'm sure they're all really excited.
 I was in the megabits.
 It's amazing.
 I love it.
 Anyway, sorry, go back to your friends.
 What does it love about my friends?
 I can't remember what it's saying now.
 So I love my friends.
 I'm thankful.
 Yeah.
 Our life is richer because of your friends and my internet.
 Okay.
 What's number three for you?
 For number three, again, you're going to think I'm cheating and I hope I'm not.
 Okay.
 exceptionally thankful for grace. So of, you know, we were talking earlier that we're, you know,
 obviously we're thankful for Jesus, etc, etc, etc. Gosh, that sounds terrible. Jesus is relegated
 to a, etc. The Lord knows he's not relegated to an, etc. But when I think about grace, you know,
 the grace that the Lord has shown me, like I was a wretched person. I was just thinking about the
 grace that my friends have shown me. Being with my sister this week, she was talking about
 me as a teenager or me as a child. When you were a dreadlocked hoodlum?
 When I was a dreadlocked hoodlum. But life wasn't great in my early 20s. I was a horrid person,
 really, just was a very, very negative, bitter, angry, demonized person. And yeah, I had
 Tremendous friends who demonstrated tremendous grace to me.
 And of course, my family too extended amazing levels of grace.
 And I just think about the grace that we enjoy from friends and family who give us a break,
 who recognize when we're tired or when we're hungry.
 I think about the grace that my kids show me.
 Like our kids are amazing.
 Yeah, they are.
 Like when we apologize to our kids for, you know, perhaps not reacting the best way or being short with them.
 And you know, they're like, oh, we've given you just when people extend you grace.
 It's an exceptional feeling.
 Yeah.
 And what I say next doesn't dilute that feeling, but that grace is minimal in the face of what God shows us.
 Yeah.
 I was thinking this morning in church sitting there that.
 You John 3 16 for God loved the world so much that he sent his only begotten son.
 And I just think that the way that God treats broken and gray vile people.
 is not with hatred, is not with anger, is not even with judgment. He treats them with his own son.
 Yeah.
 While I was still a sinner, while I was in my wretched, debased self, the father just looked at me and
 was just like, "Oh, I want you. You think you're horrible, but you're lovely to me. Wait till you
 see what you're like redeemed. You'd be astonished at how amazing you are." Yeah.
 And so just been on the receiving and continually of grace.
 Oh my gosh, it's amazing.
 So I've just been meditating on that while I've been thinking about how awesome the internet is.
 I've been thinking about how amazing grace is.
 And well, I guess that palances it out then.
 No, really though.
 This grace that the Lord shows us, grace that each other shows, grace that our staff show us.
 Yeah.
 Grace that you show me that I just think it's amazing.
 And yeah, I love it.
 I scandalous, really, the kindness, the goodness, the graciousness of God.
 It's astonishing.
 It is astonishing.
 You know, I think the kindness of God is the best kept secret in the church.
 Yeah, I wish it wasn't such a good kept secret.
 No, I'm not right.
 I know what you mean.
 But I think that extravagance, which by the way isn't extravagant to him, it's who he is.
 It's not like God wakes up and puts on his extravagant t-shirt today.
 He's like, "Yeah, you know what?
 I'll be more extravagant than normal."
 No, he's just a radiant in his kindness. And I think understanding the revelation of the father's
 love for me is the thing that transformed my whole life. Me too. If you're listening to what
 I'm saying and you haven't experienced that kindness, or perhaps you have in theory, perhaps
 you have a working understanding of what Jesus did for you on the cross, but you find it has
 has an impact to your life, that you're not in awe of the graciousness and the kindness
 of God, that you're not moved to your knees by his ridiculous amounts of love and affection.
 Would you let me pray for you? If you don't want me to pray for you, just press pause.
 Otherwise you're getting prayed for. So Father, I am in awe of you Lord, and I've
 joking about the internet and how astonished I am about that. But in all honesty, that
 just completely pales into insignificance when I think about your great and your vast
 affection. That you love everybody who's listening to this with astonishing unrelenting
 affection. Yeah. That you looked at us in our worst moments in the moments where we
 drop our heads with deep shame when we think about the things we've done or what we're
 like. And none of that is intimidating to you. None of that is a barrier to your great
 affection. And your response in our lowest seasons of life was to extend mercy and grace,
 was to send Jesus to bring us into this never ending relationship with you, a relationship that
 is only ever upgraded, only gets better and better, and that your thoughts towards us are as
 countless as the sound on the seashore Lord, you're ridiculous and extravagant. And I'm asking
 for everybody who's listening, Lord, that you would give them an incredible revelation today,
 that you would push pause on their life and that they would encounter this majesty, this
 grace, this kindness, this extravagance, this ridiculousness, really. Lord, your love that
 knows no bounds, that is constantly reaching out toward us and that you will never leave
 us, you'll never forsake us, you're constantly pursuing us with kindness. And so Lord, I
 just ask for everybody who's listening to this, if they don't know you, if they haven't
 accept to Jesus as the Lord of their life, Lord, that you would move upon their heart,
 that grace would be there for them to just say, "Jesus, I want you."
 And if they have given their life to Jesus, but perhaps they don't know you, Father, they
 don't know you as a dad, they know you as an angry God, that you would push past that
 barrier and you would introduce yourself to them as the kindness person they will ever
 meet in their lives.
 And for all of us, Lord, I just thank you for our churches, I thank you for our friends,
 I thank you for love.
 I thank you for grace.
 I thank you for the internet, Lord.
 I ask that we would this week just foster in our hearts
 gratitude, thankfulness and excitement about who you are
 and what you're doing in all of our lives.
 Amen.
 Amen.
 I have another quote for you as we end.
 OK.
 There's another quote from Dr. Caroline Leif.
 Hit me with it.
 She said, "Your perceptions adjust your brain chemistry
 in a positive or negative direction, and you get to decide."
 So one of the things you can do is exactly what aging I've been doing is when your conversations
 this week, when you're with people refuse to entertain negativity.
 Yeah, a worry or criticism.
 Yeah.
 And foster things like, Hey, tell me three things you're thankful for.
 People would love it.
 Just, but it doesn't matter how silly it seems, just be just express gratitude and
 thankfulness and you actually change your brain chemistry in an amazing way.
 I realize.
 Sorry.
 I just think that's amazing.
 I think it's amazing because Scripture encourages us to be thankful.
 And then God made our bodies to actually physically respond and rejuvenate and heal through thankfulness.
 Correct.
 Pretty wild.
 I realize we haven't answered any listeners questions.
 The reason for that is you guys have been wonderful in sending in questions, but a lot of the questions are so detailed and so long that you really need a pastor to answer them.
 You don't need strangers who have met you.
 We'll do our best in answering them.
 So if you've got questions you'd like to ask us or if you've got topics you'd like us
 to talk about on the podcast, hit us up at <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask.
 And if you'd like the show notes for this episode, go to <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/79 and you can
 get the show notes there.
 Well, we pray you have an incredible week, replete with the goodness and the kindness
 of God.
 Yes.
 You know, I'm praying that prayer for a great revelation that fathers love.
 I realize that my wife has written an incredible book on that topic called Finding Father.
 A.J. Jones tells about Finding Father. Finding Father is a three month or 12 week
 Bible study where you just spend time daily in the message of God's heart towards you and
 get healed, basically, have your heart healed and your mind renewed in terms of who he is and what
 he's really like and what he thinks about you. And we've had tremendous feedback from people
 who've read the book, who've just been like, "You know what my life's completely changed?
 I have a completely different understanding of the revelation of God." And if you'd like more
 information about that, if you'd like to download a free chapter, go to <a href="mailto:ellen@ag.com">ellen@ag.com</a> and just look
 for Finding Father, hit the store link on the top right hand corner, and you can find information
 or you can get it on Amazon Kindle or for your iPhone or iPad and the Apple's iBook store.
 What do you laugh on that?
 You, you're adorable.
 Okay.
 Have a great week.
 Bye.
