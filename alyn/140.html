<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday, most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones
 Welcome everybody to episode 140 of keeping up with the jones's.
 140.<br/>
 That's right, 10 more will be 150.<br/>
 Do you know when 20 more will be at 160?
 Do you see the mental arithmetic prowess in action?
 Amazing.<br/>
 Um, you're still sick, what the heck?<br/>
 I am still sick.<br/>
 You've moved from vertigo to either bronchitis or pneumonia.
 I still have vertigo.<br/>
 Oh, you do?<br/>
 I don't have the crazy whole room spinning, but I still have the, I feel dizzy all the time.
 Wow. So now you're on quite the cocktail of drugs.
 I am.<br/>
 You're on steroids.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Which is amusing because you take them at night and you can't sleep.
 I'm not finding it quite as amusing.<br/>
 What I mean is your hyper.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Like, like tonight, you just sat and giggled in the corner.
 Well, yes.<br/>
 You sent me a picture of a clown doing ballet and thought it was a funny thing ever.
 It was funny.<br/>
 Right. So you're on steroids, but you're also on some sort of cough syrup that has hydrocoding.
 Yes. Yeah, just coding.<br/>
 Not hydrocoding. I don't think so.<br/>
 No, I think it's hydrocodone. You're on something that's an narcotic because you use a prescription for.
 Yes. And that's supposed to knock you out, but because you've taken steroids, it doesn't.
 Right. And it's supposed to make me stop coughing, but it's not really doing that either.
 So I've banished you to the sofa.<br/>
 She's very uncomfortable.<br/>
 The sofa is yes if you stop coughing you can come back to try to come back into the bedroom last night.
 I did but you were like sleeping in star formation of taking up the entire bed.
 So I just took my pillow and headed back out to the couch.
 Why don't you just wake me up and ask me to move over because you're snoring so loudly I had the
 thought of that would keep me awake anyway. So I might as well just go back.
 I'm sorry. Yeah. So you're on steroids, coding syrup, albuterol. Yes.
 to help your lungs open up.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And today you started antibiotics.<br/>
 Is it through my sin or something?<br/>
 Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 I'm so done with being sick.<br/>
 It's been over a month.<br/>
 Oh, well, baby, I'm hoping the doctor did say if you didn't feel better to take the antibiotics,
 I'm hoping the antibiotics will kick it.
 Me too.<br/>
 I needed to kick.<br/>
 I need it to be kicked to kick it.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 Yep.<br/>
 Let's do a review of this week.<br/>
 We had the wonderful Alex and Resele on year two.
 Yep.<br/>
 Our friends passes the belonging came in and spoke on life in leadership to our year
 two students, which was amazing. And you spoke to an angel's demons and third heaven experiences
 and year one. That's always a fun week. It is fun. So we teach on spiritual warfare. We teach
 about angels, we teach about demons, we talk about discerning both of those things,
 talk about what's in the Bible, which there isn't a huge amount. Like when it comes to demons,
 the gospel writers just assume that everybody knows what they are.
 So, we talk about how to be careful navigating
 extra biblical content.<br/>
 And in summary, anytime you're listening to anybody
 teach extra biblical content,<br/>
 you wanna make sure it's not controversial biblical content.
 And you actually have to really trust the person
 that's speaking.
</p><ul>
  <li>Right.
  </li><li>And don't put too much weight on stuff
 that actually isn't in the Bible.
  </li><li>Amen.
  </li><li>And then we talk all about the heavenly realms,
 which is a whole fascinating thing.
  </li><li>It's very cool, isn't it?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Then you had a horse sink Tuesday.
  </li><li>I did.
 ask you how that went.
  </li><li>Thanks.
  </li><li>How did it go?
  </li><li>I went great.
 I went to Moss Tacos beforehand too.
  </li><li>So you gotta feed your soul before you heal your soul?
  </li><li>Yes, that's deep.
  </li><li>That sounds great.
  </li><li>That's really deep.
 You should put that on mug.
  </li><li>I would say that it's been the busiest week of the year.
  </li><li>It was a crazy week.
  </li><li>But it was great.
 Busy, busy.
 It wasn't great for you 'cause you're sick.
  </li><li>No, no, it wasn't.
 Every day I'm just like, I just wanna be in bed.
  </li><li>And we were out every night, lots of catching up
 friends, lots of meetings.
 But good, good catching up.
 Yeah. And lots of work, which is great.
 Yeah.
 Thursday night.
 Why was I so happy about Thursday night?
 Thursday night, we did the sex talk for married couples.
 When you say we did the sex talk, would you like to clarify that?
 Yes, I did absolutely none of it this year.
 And it was glorious.
 You just grinned on the front row.
 I did and laughed and snickered.
 For a number of years now, we've offered people who are about to get
 married a really practical primer on sex.
 Because, well, as pastors and people who've been married, we know that it's not quite
 as easy.
 Do you even want to talk about this?
 I'll flag this as explicit and then we'll be fine.
 Parents were about to talk on sex.
 So if you're kid listening, you might want to use your discernment wisely.
 So the reason we started doing these sex talks for a couple of years about to get married
 is as pastors, we can't stand the thought of people having a bad sex life.
 Right.
 sad because lots of people are having a bad sex life and then they can't talk about it
 or they feel like they can't.
 Yeah, because nobody talks about it.
 So nobody talks about really about money or sex in the body of Christ and the two things
 that most married couples have difficulties over our money and sex.
 So we're doing our best to do that.
 But anyway, we started with newlyweds.
 And then as we've taught on the school year after year after year, we do a whole week
 on a school called sexual wholeness, which is ministering into sexual sin, sexual trauma,
 all that sort of stuff.
 And a lot of the married couples in the school would say,
 hey, there's a bunch of questions we wanted to ask,
 but didn't feel like it would be helpful to ask that
 in a bunch of single people.
 Is there any way that you could do some sort of ministry
 for married couples?
 And thus was born our almost annual sex talk
 for married couples.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so it's a funny evening.
  </li><li>It is.
  </li><li>But it's weird because sometimes you're speaking
 to people who've had sex way longer than we have.
  </li><li>Yes, which is, yeah, it's definitely weird.
 This is the first year that I didn't teach any of it,
 and I just sat there and listened.
  </li><li>Right, and part of that is because you were
 drugged out with your eyeballs,
 and you know what you were gonna say up there.
  </li><li>Who knows, anything could happen.
  </li><li>But thank you to everybody who came out.
 We had a great night, I hope you did too.
 And then Friday night, we went to see the Lego Batman movie
 for a family movie night.
 What do you think, I don't even get a chance to speak to you.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>About that, what did you think was a movie?
  </li><li>It was good, I spent most of time either with MJ Oni
 or Tia Oni.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're still getting used to movie theaters.
 Yeah, yeah, but I mean, that's kind of why I go
 is for the cuddles.
  </li><li>MJ said that the movie theater
 was the biggest movie theater ever, except for Jesus.
 Jesus is bigger than the movie screen.
  </li><li>That kid is way too cute.
  </li><li>I loved it.
 If you like the Lego movie,
 you're gonna love the Lego Batman movie.
 Same sense of humor.
 There's lots of private end jokes
 for Marvel MDC fans alike.
  </li><li>True, very true.
  </li><li>And yeah, two thumbs up, it was excellent.
  </li><li>And our friend David Campbell is here from England.
 Of course he's Scottish.
 He says he is a missionary to the lost in England.
 Well, yes, he is.
 I can't believe he's lived in England all these years and has an accent as thick as he does.
 Yeah, because that is a really Scottish accent.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Are you hoping I get a tune up?
 I am actually.
 I was I already asked him if he could somehow just follow you around whispering to you.
 That's a little creepy.
 That's not creepy at all, babe.
 Thanks for that.
 And he's spoken amazing word at grace.
 That's morning.
 Yeah, I did.
 It was really good.
 Our main topic for this week came out of a conversation we had randomly with some friends this week who were talking about having kids that is a married couple.
 They don't have kids yet.
 And they were talking about their various fears and excitement about having kids.
 And I was like, Oh, yeah, I know that we've got three.
 I vaguely remember that.
 So I thought it would be fun to talk about having kids how we ended up with kids.
 No, not that part of having kids.
 Right.
 Yeah, we already, you know, although that would be a fun podcast.
 That's not like a whole other podcast show.
 But anyway, I was thinking about this whole thing of having kids, because it's funny
 watching the progression of couples that, you know, we pass through young adults.
 So we pass through people from their twenties all the way up to their late thirties.
 And so it's funny watching this progression of people wanting to be single, then people
 wanting to date, then people wanting to get married, and then people thinking of having
 kids and then people having kids and watching the way everybody navigates those so differently.
 I just love the way God's made us so unique.
 Like there's some people we know all they want to do is be a mom.
 And there's other people who are like, I don't want kids at all.
 Right.
 And just watching how the Lord weaves everything through their life is amusing.
 It is very cool.
 What was it like for you?
 Think about our lives pre kids.
 Tell me about whether you, I mean, what were you, because when we got
 married, we even talked about having kids.
 I think we did.
 Cause remember we had talked about how we wanted to name our first girl Abgal.
 Oh, yeah, that's right.
 So I always knew I wanted to have kids.
 I just didn't know if I would be a good mom.
 And I was kind of terrified of being pregnant and giving birth.
 Right.
 So yeah.
 And how many of you have I'm trying to think back.
 How many of your friends in that season life had kids though?
 Oh, lots.
 Did they?
 Yeah, because I got married really late.
 Oh, yeah, that's right.
 Yeah.
 I remember praying and asking the Lord, I said, I don't think I'm ready to have a boy.
 I'd love a girl first growing up with three sisters.
 I thought I would be able to do girls.
 I understand girls.
 But back then, I wasn't sure how I would relate to a boy.
 I was like, what if you grow up and want us to become a sports person?
 Now I've found a solution to that.
 I'll just outsource it to all my friends who play sports.
 Right.
 We've surrounded ourselves with some sporty people.
 You know, if Michael Jones wants to play football, we'll just get bright over.
 Right.
 He wants to play baseball, just get Mr.
 Bill over.
 Yeah.
 And so on and so forth.
 Right.
 Yeah, what is this?
 If he wants to learn a shoot gun, we'll get Danny over.
 I mean, it's just.
 It's perfect.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 and if he wants to be a nerd then you know then he can just sit next to you yeah okay good so you
 didn't want to have well you did want to have kids but you're terrified of the thought of having
 kids well i was worried um then i wouldn't be a good mom i mean i think whenever you think about
 anything that you've never done before it's easy to listen to that voice it's like you're gonna
 suck at this right it's gonna be horrible or you should try something else so but you're a great
 Thanks.
 I love watching you parent.
 Really?
 Yeah.
 Oh my gosh, you're phenomenal.
 Oh great.
 See, that's good to know.
 Yeah.
 So it's funny that it would be most like the enemy to tell you you're going to suck at
 something that you're going to be brilliant at.
 I was clueless.
 I didn't really give any thought to having kids.
 I was just excited to be part of the baby making process.
 And I thought if you were, I just thought if you've thought it through, then I'm fine
 to go with you.
 You know you tend to think something through way more thoroughly than I do and I'm a fairly thorough thinker through
 So I was like yeah, if you thought this through great plus I thought I got nine months to get used to the idea
 Yes, well, yes all the time it takes to get pregnant plus nine months. Well, let's talk really let's talk about that
 Let's talk about getting pregnant. What part of what part of getting pregnant? Did you want to talk about?
 I mean there's plenty of parts I'd like to talk about but the but I was thinking of I think in our naivety
 We were just like, well, this is no problem.
 It'll be easy to have kids.
 You'll just get off the pill because you were on the pill at that point.
 Yeah.
 Did you want to talk about that for a second?
 Oh, well, the pill for me was not a good scenario.
 Well, all three options of the pill that you took were not a good scenario.
 I took three different ones.
 All of them I reacted to in various different ways.
 One of them, I was having horrible chest pains and thought I was having a heart attack.
 Not a good look.
 No, it wasn't.
 The other one turned you into the most emotional I've ever seen you.
 Oh, yeah.
 I was like, you know, crying if I walked into a room that was pretty.
 I was just like, what is going on?
 Um, yeah, it wasn't good either.
 And then the other one just totally killed my sex drive.
 So, you know, it was effective, but as a contraceptive, very effective, right.
 Very, but not good for first year of marriage.
 Not so much.
 So I think after trying the three back to back about a year in, we just went, yeah, let's stop.
 and we switched over to using fam.
 Oh, no, describe fam.
 Fam stands for family.
 What does it stand for?
 It stands for something.
 Something about a family.
 It's best described in the book.
 Taking charge of your fertility.
 Yes, but it's a way of charting where your monthly cycle is.
 But we're just getting into all the details.
 This is this way.
 It's a way of just charting where you are in the ovulation cycle with some fairly.
 Accurate.
 Yeah, you loved it because it involved.
 Charred.
  </li><li>Charred.
  </li><li>And axial spreadsheets and all this sort of stuff.
  </li><li>Yes, it was a beautiful thing.
  </li><li>And it fit your cycle.
  </li><li>It did.
  </li><li>No pun intended, but it fit the way your brain works.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Well, we've had other friends that have tried to use it.
 And we're less, less, how shall we say,
 conscientious in their charting?
  </li><li>Yeah, they were a little looser
 and ended up getting pregnant, but.
  </li><li>I think, I mean, I've got to be careful
 in what I say because we know of some friends
 who are so fertile that if they look at each other
 the wrong way they produce a baby would seem true. And so we were all thinking, well, no
 problem. You'll just come off contraception. We'll have a baby. Right. But that was not
 the case. No. I mean, you weaned off the pill for about three months, and then we started
 trying to have a baby and it took us 10 months. No, I weaned off the pill for about a year.
 Oh, wow. Before we started trying, it still took us 10 months. Right. Yeah. Which now
 that we got three kids, and I want to be sensitive, because if you're listening to this and you're
 having fertility issues, it's going to sound like I'm putting myself in the same group as you.
 So forgive me if I'm treating your feelings insensitatively and I'm really not trying to do that.
 But we have three kids now, but before we had any, all we knew was that every month that we
 thought we were going to be pregnant, we weren't. And so that was a little disheartening to say the
 least. Yeah, it was disappointing every month. And it was at 10 months of very specific trying.
 Yeah. And then between Tia and MJ, it was two and a half years of trying with a couple of miscarriages and just.
 Was it really two and a half years of intentional trying? Yep.
 It's a whole new spin on your sax life, doesn't it? Oh boy, does it?
 All of a sudden during that week, sex is no longer for fun. It's functional. And it's just like,
 you're just not having a great time. We're just like, let's just get this done.
 It is a purely scientific endeavor.
 Horrible.
 I remember in that season we had a Bible study that would meet our house.
 Remember?
 And I remember at one point, you were alarm went off.
 And so there's a group of people in our house, all these young adults.
 And we're like, ah, it's so sorry.
 We were just going to go upstairs and make a baby.
 I just talked amongst yourself.
 We'll be back in about half an hour.
 Somebody brought that up to us a couple of weeks ago that they remembered it.
 Oh, I'm being in our house.
 I'm sure they remember like, all right, it's time.
 Hang on, guys, we'll be back.
 So what was the issue with there?
 There's no issue, obviously, because we produced three healthy children.
 Well, there was.
 I mean, between, between Tia and MJ, I was having a progesterone problem.
 My hormones were sort of all out of what I was.
 So I could get pregnant.
 I just couldn't keep it.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 All that to say was it wasn't as simple as we thought it would be, but you can't
 take that as a baseline because we know other people who is way simpler than that.
 Yeah.
 All I'm saying is the whole thing of having children is unique to every
 person, everybody has their own story.
 It's true.
  </li><li>What was the best advice we got?
 Because boy, do people want to give you advice
 when they find out you're having kids?
  </li><li>I think the best advice that we got was that kids
 can fit into your life.
 Like the way it doesn't have to be
 that kids completely change your life.
 It's that kids actually can fit in with your life.
 Like it can kind of be designed if that makes sense.
  </li><li>And we have to remember at that stage of our life,
 we were on and off of airplanes every week.
 We were in a different part of the world every month.
 Yeah. And so when people found out you were pregnant,
 probably that was the kind of advice we got
 from Patricia Butzma, one of our pastors in Toronto,
 and she just said, oh, kids fit in with your life.
 So. Yeah.
 And she had like a million of them, well, five or six.
 Right. Which seemed like a million when you have none.
 Right. And yeah, 'cause we were sort of like,
 oh, we're pregnant and we travel for a living.
 What are we gonna do?
 And she was like, you'll be fine.
 You know, they'll just come with you.
 They're little, they're portable.
 Right. Yeah.
 What was the worst advice we got?
  </li><li>I think people saying the equivalent of,
 well, you know that you're never gonna sleep again
 or take this season while you're pregnant to get sleep
 'cause you're never gonna get anymore.
  </li><li>Or all your whole life changes, but not in a good way.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And of course your whole life changes, of course it does.
 But I think if people have had negative experiences
 with their children, they then expect your experience
 to be negative with children.
 And we've got to remember that all of our experiences
 are unique to us and unique to the way we're wired.
 It was John and Paul Sanford who said that marriage is designed by God to kill you as
 an husband and wife.
 What they meant by that is God will bring your partner with the exact opposing issues
 so that your heat said, and I don't think he was meaning this, that marriage is designed
 to grind.
 I was like, "Oh, yes, it is."
 But that's not what he meant.
 But basically the whole refining process that you and your spouse are meant to in one
 since but heads so that you rub the rough edges of your life away.
 Right.
 You know, the whole weaknesses of others will be used to refine the weaknesses in you type
 of thing.
 And then in the same sentence, he said that kids are designed by God to bring healing
 to your life.
 And I saw that in you in that you became way more in touch with your feminine side after
 you had Abigail, our first daughter.
 Even when I was pregnant with her, I think shopping for all these little pink things.
 Right.
 to color pink. You were not through through. You were not girly.
 But I, as I was buying little beautiful little pink things for her, I was like, oh,
 well, maybe I wear a pink sweater.
 That was the first thing I got was like a zip up cardigan kind of thing.
 And, and then, you know, even more so when I had Tia, like with each child,
 the Lord sort of healed different parts of my heart.
 It's amazing like that.
 Yeah, it's amazing. What changes did you see in me with MJ?
 Like with the girls, you would sort of, you would definitely play with them and
 and tickle them and stuff like that.
 But the rough housing with MJ is just really, really sweet.
  </li><li>Right, he loves it.
  </li><li>Yeah, they're just sort of wrestling
 and the ninja and all that kind of stuff.
  </li><li>I love that.
 See, it's funny, 'cause when you have little girls,
 they flirt with you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>They're designed to flirt with their daddies.
 You know, they try and tease you
 and they try and get kisses,
 and they stick their bum out of you,
 so you pinch their bum and they run away,
 and they're just desperate for daddy's attention.
 You know, they'll make eyes at you.
 With a boy, they wanna fight their daddy.
 And it's the same thing, he wants to pin me to the floor,
 like nothing he loves more than wrestling,
 or now he's a ninja, so he wants to do all his ninja moves.
 And that's a really fun, and he wants to help.
 Anytime I'm doing anything, he's there,
 and he wants to help.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's so cute.
  </li><li>Screwdriver's power tools.
  </li><li>Any boy stuff, he just wants to get in there.
  </li><li>I love that thing.
  </li><li>It's very sweet.
  </li><li>So we had a baby, how traumatic was that?
  </li><li>Well, you know, like the first one was the most difficult
 in terms of body trauma, I suppose.
 Right. And they don't prepare the husband for much.
 Pardon?
 They don't prepare the husband for much.
 What do you mean?
 Well, for example, I don't want to grow people out.
 They don't prepare the husband for much?
 Right. Well, did you know that after giving birth,
 you then have to give birth to the placenta?
 Yes.
 I did know that.
 Well, nobody told me,
 sound like, "Why is she pushing?
 Is there another one in there?"
 And, "Oh my gosh, what is that?"
 It was like a face-ugger from Alien came out.
 (laughs)
 You're hysterical.
 No, I was like...
 And then Abigail needed to be like, she needed some help coming out.
 So they put like a suction cup on her.
 So when she came out, she had a cone head and I was like, what is that?
 I love her. I love her. I love her.
 And I was like, Oh, does that go away?
 What is going on?
 But it resolved in like a day, didn't it?
 Yeah, less than 24 hours.
 Yeah.
 So giving birth was.
 It was a lot less.
 I'm sorry. It was hard for you.
 It was hard for you.
 'cause well, like, let's space it.
 It wasn't inside of you.
  </li><li>But what I mean is there was way less activity
 than I was expecting.
 Like you watch the Hollywood movies
 and the wife is screaming and, you know,
 there's all these doctors running around
 and it really wasn't.
 It was just a whole lot of waiting until the last bit
 and then there was some pushing.
  </li><li>And I don't really scream anyway.
  </li><li>No, you don't.
  </li><li>No.
 In fact, I'm just sort of very, very quiet.
  </li><li>You're very focused.
  </li><li>Yes.
 But I mean, even though, I mean, Abby was what?
 Six and a half weeks premature and 18 hours of labor
 and three hours of pushing
 and lots of other traumatic things.
  </li><li>So that's what I mean, 18 hours plus three
 is what, 21 hours?
 So I'm thinking, you know, your water's broken,
 we're rushing to the hospital.
 Oh, it's just drama and baby's coming
 and we need a doctor stat, we need this
 and some hot towels and hot water.
 no one brought hot water or towels.
 I'm not sure where I got that idea from.
 And 21 hours later--
  </li><li>It's called the midwife or something.
  </li><li>21 hours later, there's a baby, like 21 hours.
 There's a long time away.
  </li><li>Yeah, was it a hard feeding bait?
 Was it a hard feeding bait?
 Because I was having interactions like every two minutes,
 but you know, I could see where that might
 feel really long for you.
  </li><li>All I'm seeing was 21 hours was a lot longer
 than I was expecting.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>But you did a great job, it was very proud of you.
  </li><li>Thanks.
  </li><li>I tell you what's scary is watching the epidural
 needle going. What's scarier is getting an epidural and that it doesn't work. Yeah. Oh,
 yeah. Bummer. That was that. Yeah. All right. Good times. Let's skip this part. I'm
 very queasy. Moving right along. Let's talk about the early years because we're well
 aware we don't know what we're talking about with kids. As in, we haven't had teenagers.
 We haven't had teenagers. So all we've had, you know, our oldest kid is about to turn
 10. So we don't know nothing. You can't even believe she's about to be a double digit
 kid. Right. So unique classification. Thank you.
 The early years. Let's talk about the early years. Yeah.
 We did something called baby wise. We did. Now, I want to stress
 any parents listening to this, understand that what we're talking
 about is not that we did it right. And if you're not doing the way
 we did it, you did it wrong. That would be farcical to suggest.
 We are absolutely not commenting on how you're choosing to parent
 your children. Our best piece of advice is find something that
 works for you and your lifestyle and go for it.
 For us, we are very, very high planners.
 We schedule and plan pretty much everything.
 So baby-wise, give baby-wise in a nutshell.
  </li><li>Baby-wise in a nutshell is a way of scheduling
 feeding and sleeping patterns to help the baby sleep
 through the night and get good full feeds
 and sort of get on a routine where their metabolism
 is helping to direct their sleep.
 And we did baby wise with all three children.
  </li><li>We did.
  </li><li>And the results of that were,
 what just again in a nutshell, what did we see?
  </li><li>In a nutshell, well, even though the first two
 were pre-me, they both slept through the night
 by nine weeks.
 And by slept through the night, I mean,
 they would sleep eight to 10 hours.
 By 12 weeks, they were all sleeping 12 hours a night
 with one dream feet around 11 o'clock.
 MJ was sleeping through the night by seven weeks,
 but he wasn't pre-me.
 He was like a normal seven pound baby or eight pound baby.
  </li><li>So that means two months after having a baby,
 we were back to getting 12 hours of sleep a night.
 I mean, the kids were, we were back to getting eight hours
 of sleep a night. - Right, we didn't tip
 a few, go to bed at seven with them, but yes.
  </li><li>And since then, to this day,
 they still go down at seven p.m.
 They wake up at seven a.m.
  </li><li>All three of them, yeah.
  </li><li>And by the time, I mean, literally our routine
 for putting them to bed is go upstairs, clean teeth,
 get in pajamas, climb in the bed.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then we usually sing them a song about Jesus
 and praying tongues over them and then kiss them and that's it.
  </li><li>And that's it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>What was the other method that was presented to you?
  </li><li>Well, the other method, I mean, I think it's called
 by a bunch of different names,
 but probably demand feeding is what it's known as.
  </li><li>And we're on two ends of a spectrum.
 So there's plenty of options in between those.
 On the one hand, you're scheduling the baby.
 On the other hand, demand feeding,
 you're letting the baby decide when it wants to eat
 and when it wants to sleep.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And we didn't opt for that.
 I think because our life was just so crazy.
 We didn't want that option went on an airplane.
  </li><li>No, the idea of the baby being scheduled appealed to me
 and also when you have a NICU baby,
 those babies are on a schedule.
 So-- - What's NICU?
  </li><li>Neonatal ICU is NICU.
 And so in the intensive care units for babies,
 they have all those babies on three hour schedules
 or four hour schedules.
 And there's a bunch of medical reasons for that,
 so that new milk doesn't sit on top of old milk,
 give them gas, therefore give them colic,
 all that kind of stuff.
 And so because that was the schedule
 that Abby was already on when she came home
 was on a three hour schedule,
 even at 12 days old, we just maintained that schedule.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>But that's one of the things
 a baby wise direction to do anyway.
  </li><li>All right, so the early years
 were fairly straightforward, wouldn't I?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I mean, really?
  </li><li>Really straightforward, yeah.
 I think my parents, I don't know about your mom,
 does she ever comment, I think they were a little,
 it's weird because you know my parents have,
 they've raised four children,
 they have like a hundred grandchildren.
 So when they watched us doing baby wise,
 they were like, what are you doing?
  </li><li>Yeah, they would say things like,
 never wake a sleeping baby.
 And I'm like, nope, it's time for it to wake.
 It's a scheduled feeding.
  </li><li>Right, and you can't put the baby down
 because you know, look, it's bright as a button.
 It doesn't need to sleep.
 And so they were like, but after, you know,
 they come visit us once a year, when they'd come,
 be like, "Oh my gosh, your kids just go to sleep." So for us, it was a lifesaver.
 Yeah. It worked really well for us. Yeah.
 And the book, we'll put a link in the show notes. It's called "On Becoming Baby Wise."
 Right.
 Very helpful.
 All right. You're a working mom.
 Yes.
 What's that like?
 It's both good and hard at times.
 Talk to me about the good stuff.
 Well, I mean, I love to work. I love my job. So I don't feel like, "Ugh, I have to work." I feel
 like, "Oh, I have a calling and I love working." And I was going to say, and we've been lucky
 enough since having kids to have a job where we're working for the church and really we're
 able to work around what we need to do for the kids to feel loved and like they're getting enough
 time and us to get our work done. So it's not like I have a nine to five job where I leave the kid
 at a preschool all day or anything like that. So it's not been that hard. I think that's probably
 a lot harder. And over the years, our boss, Jeff Dollar, has been so flexible with us.
 We've done various things. We've done job sharing. We've done hour sharing. In the early days,
 we'd cart our baby to the meetings we were at. And even to this day, one of the things I love is
 Like right now our kids at the age were up until a couple of months ago they would come to church with us on both services on a Sunday
 and they were getting to the point where like we're bored being the same service between the same craft to services.
 Yeah, and so we spoke to Jeff and he's like, oh it's a priority your kids do not grow up presenting church.
 So by all means, you know, bring them to one service and you guys trade out on whichever service and that level of flexibility makes it possible to do what we're doing.
 What's the bad stuff about being a working mom for you?
 I think it's pretty much impossible to get all this stuff done that is in my head that
 a mom should do.
 So like maybe the state of our house, you know, and not having enough time to really
 clean the house or get the laundry done in the amount of time that I want to get done
 and that kind of stuff.
 Like there's lots of things that sort of fall by the wayside because of the amount of stuff
 for trying to pull off because when the kids are home,
 we want to spend time with them as opposed to spend time cleaning.
 I think from what we found from just pastoring,
 the universal thought that goes through mom's heads or I'm failing as a mom.
 Yeah.
 This is something I'm not doing right.
 I wish I could be doing this better.
 And I think the challenge for both of us as as we've had to learn to be kind to
 ourselves. Yeah.
 And I've had to learn to be kind to you because I realized I grew up with all
 sorts of norms like Adam mom who quit her job to stay home and look after the kids and raise the kids.
 Right. And it was only when we were in our teenage years that she go back to work part time.
 You know, the time that we wouldn't even know if she wasn't there because we were at school and
 she was a university lecturer. And so I was comparing my childhood with their childhood,
 which was the fair. I remember one point you were like, Hey, babe, I worked the same numbers of
 hours as you. Why are you expecting me to do 100% of the parenting and homekeeping and 100% of the job?
 Why aren't you doing 100% of the homekeeping too? We do 100% of our work together. And I was like,
 you make a great point. I'm not sure I like the point you're making, but it seems solid.
 And it took me a while to realize, oh, I have all these
 inbuilt ideas of what you should be doing and what I should be doing. What I should be doing is
 is modeled on my father. I have worked all day. I will now come home. I will put up my
 feet and you will prepare dinner."
 Right. And it's like, "Oh, but I worked all day too."
 Yeah, but obviously making dinner is your job. Again, it was being programmed in my head
 because that's what I saw my mom do. And you're like, "I'm fine to make dinner. Would you
 like to do laundry while I'm making dinner?" When I go back to the thing about being kind
 to one another, we had to realize something had to give.
 Yeah.
 So for the most part, that's our house.
 Yeah. It is what it is.
 Our house is tidy when our guests come over, but for our schedule, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday,
 so hectic, that usually it's a mess.
 It's really Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, that it's a mess.
 Right.
 And usually we try and do some picking up or some semblance of order Thursday and Friday,
 and then it goes back into messville.
 Right.
 Because I'd rather have a messy house than messed up kids.
 Right.
 So and sometimes we fail at that too.
 Sometimes we get really focused on getting the house clean
 and the children are being parented by iPads
 for a whole morning while we try and get it there,
 but we're trying to avoid that.
  </li><li>Right.
 But here's what I've learned is kids are super resilient
 if you're humble.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like our kids, we've apologized lots to them.
 And I realized, I realized if,
 I don't think we deliberately said how to do this,
 But I think it's because of all the inner healing that we've had and all the inner healing teaching
 we've sat under.
 It's as we've given them space to share their hearts, we found out that they trust us with
 their hearts.
 So they'll often come to us and say, "Hey, my heart got really hurt when you said this,
 Daddy."
 Or I remember one day I forget Rose, I was really short-tempered and Abby had lost her
 iPad.
 I don't know.
 She'd lost something.
 And you know, she was in the, I can't find my own iPad.
 I don't know where it is.
 And I just quipped, well, sucks to be you, I guess.
 As in, what I meant by that is,
 well, it's your responsibility to look after your iPad.
 I'm really sorry that you can't remember where it was.
 I'm sure it will come out.
 But she just paused and then she looked at me and she said,
 "Daddy, that's quite unkind.
 'Cause it doesn't suck to be me.
 It's actually great to be me.
 I'm just sad I've lost my iPad."
 And I was like, "Right, I'm sorry."
 Darling, you're right.
 You're right.
 So sorry, that's not what I meant.
 And MJ so for both of them.
 He was playing this afternoon, he came up to me
 and he said, "Daddy, I'm the boss of me,
 but you're also the boss of me."
 And I was like, "That's right, darling."
 And he said, "So children are the bosses of themselves."
 I said, "That's right.
 "Children get to learn to manage their own behavior."
 Yeah, but their parents are also the bosses of them.
 I said, "That's right until they grow up to be adults."
 And then the grown up children
 just the bosses of themselves." And he said, "That's right." But the children are not the
 bosses of the parents. And I'm like, "You are four, and you have a solid understanding of boundaries
 and responsibility. I love this." Yeah, it's really good. I also love that they can just come up and
 express their hearts. They're quite good at saying, "Hey, when you said that, you hurt my heart." Or
 in different seasons when things get really busy, Tia or whoever will say, "Hey, it feels like
 like you guys are getting a lot busier.
 Is there any way you can, you know, be less busy?
 Like, okay kids, like good.
 Good for, you know, expressing how you're feeling.
 And yeah, let us work on that.
 Let's get that fixed up.
  </li><li>But it's always alarming when they say that.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's sad.
  </li><li>That's like, uh, okay.
  </li><li>I mean, that's what Tia said this past week.
 She's like, this past week felt so busy, mommy.
 And I was like, oh, baby, it was.
 It was like our busiest week since September or something.
 And she said, okay, well, can you not do that next week?
 Oh, yes, we heard.
 I mean, they feel like somebody else is putting them to bed.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 Yeah, that's hard.
 Yeah.
 So ebbs and flows.
 Yeah.
 And one of the most important things I wish somebody had told me is that kids swap allegiances between parents.
 Swap allegiances?
 Well, they do.
 So they go through a season where they're totally fixated on daddy and want nothing to do with mummy.
 Yeah.
 And vice versa.
 Yeah, especially when they're little.
 And that was a shock the first time they did that.
 Yeah.
 I was like, why are you rejecting me?
 And then all of a sudden they're gone.
 They're daddy's girls.
 I'm like, oh, all right.
 So in summary, give me the hardest thing you found about parenting and
 the your favorite thing about parenting.
 I think the hardest thing about parenting is feeling like you're possibly
 failing all the time and therefore screwing up your kids.
 And you're probably not as long as you're good at saying, would you forgive
 mummy for acts. And then what was the other question?
 What's your favorite thing about parenting?
 My favorite thing about parenting is just watching them learn and grow and
 fall in love with Jesus and have a real relationship. I think that's pretty cool.
 I would agree. I think the hardest thing for me parenting is there's a
 constant mirror of your behavior wandering around. Yeah.
 And the more you know about inner healing, the more you're aware of what you're, you know,
 anything could be potentially damaging. And so you have to trust that the Holy Ghost is looking
 after your kids. Yeah, for sure. So every time I discipline my kids, I'm just like, oh, Holy
 Spirit, I hope that was done with love. I hope that's not going to be the thing that in counseling
 30 years later, they're like, and I remember this time, I doubt you just said to me go to the room.
 And then I think my favorite thing is watching all of my kids become their own versions of themselves.
 Yeah. And I think that's magical watching that. That there's nothing quite like that.
 Which is amazing. It's really cool. So I hope that was helpful. Even for people who don't have
 kids, we try to talk about what it was like before we had kids. If you've got anything you
 would like us to clarify, let us know. AJ, we're going to skip a list of questions this week because
