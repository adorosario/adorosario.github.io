<p> I live in a days but got more monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones yes sir look at you look at me i wonder if our lessons can tell there's a difference about this week's episode i don't know maybe do you sound different standing up.
 I suspect it might sound slightly different just because I'm somewhat in pain.
 So we had a fun week this week and by fun, I mean, right.
 It was a crazy week.<br/>
 So last week we mentioned that AJ's mom took a trip, broke her hip, got taken in for surgery.
 You could have made a really good wrap out of that.
 Go ahead, try.<br/>
 I don't think that's my gift set.<br/>
 OK, never mind.<br/>
 Move on.<br/>
 And so AJ flew up to Toronto this week to go see your mom.
 Yeah.<br/>
 Let's just start there. How was it being back in Toronto?
 Wow, it was good. I mean, I got to see a bunch of people I love which was fantastic
 Mm-hmm and I got to eat it. So shall I twice you're so weird. No, I'm not you just love so shall I love Swiss?
 I don't know any Canadians that love so shall a as much as you do
 Well, that's possibly true, but it's only because you can't have it. I don't know
 But I I think I know lots of Canadians that like especially Johnny Carol loves wish only all right move on
 Okay, so you went to speciality you had good Thai food you had good Vietnamese food I did that wasn't the point you to visit though
 Did you get to see your mom? Yes people were asking me today. How's it?
 His mom I was like to to be honest. I don't know I haven't talked to a few about it
 She's doing quite well. We've been texting and so she's more worried about me
 Am I back in the fact that I've been in bed for the last three days? No, I'm right. So let's talk about that
 So you were up in Canada. Yeah, and you call me and you're like
 I can't move.<br/>
 Yeah, I couldn't move.<br/>
 What happened?<br/>
 Well, basically, it's, you know,<br/>
 the previous Friday I had done something
 like I had leaned over and I went,<br/>
 oh, oh that didn't feel good.<br/>
 And I thought, I don't think it's out.
 I think it's okay, you know?<br/>
 And then, you know, Monday I didn't end up getting to go
 and get adjusted or anything<br/>
 because it was like the holiday weekend.
 Right.<br/>
 And then I flew, Tuesday morning.<br/>
 So I flew already feeling a bit sore.<br/>
 Being in economy.<br/>
 Being in economy.<br/>
 terrible seats, you know, dragging my bag, all that kind of stuff.
 And then just sleeping in a bed that wasn't my own bed and driving a rental
 car that had absolutely no back support because it was like an economy car,
 you know, that kind of stuff.<br/>
 And you said that terrific in Toronto's pressure than you could imagine.
 It's insane. Like it was taking me like an hour and a half to go like 20 miles.
 I mean, in a car. Yeah.<br/>
 And you're stressed because, you know, you don't know what's happening to your mom.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, and I'm stressed because even though it's the city
 that I know, everything looks different.
 Like it's crazy, babe.
 Like if you drive to mom's house, remember how these
 to be fields all along, major Mac?
  </li><li>No fields. - No fields.
 So it was just everything was like, just stress.
  </li><li>So your back goes out, you call me from the airport
 and apparently, Air Canada wants to send you to hospital
 and not put you on a plane.
  </li><li>That's right.
 Yeah, so when I checked in, because I was having trouble
 breathing because of where it was out.
 And so I asked the lady to lift my little carry on baggage.
 I said, I can't lift it.
 My back's out.
 And then I couldn't even lift my purse or anything.
 And so she put me in a wheelchair.
 The guy that was pushing me in the wheelchair was like,
 ma'am, I think we need to take you to a hospital, not
 to a plane.
 And I said, I just need to get home to Nashville.
 I have people there that will take care of me.
 I just need to get home.
 And he's like, OK.
 So they got me on the plane.
 and they carried everything for me.
 And then in Chicago, same thing,
 they sent like a little golf cart guy
 and he picked me up and it was like a mile and a half
 to my gate, so that's a good thing.
 I didn't try and walk that one.
  </li><li>Oh, you were pretty mobile.
 I came and picked you up.
 And I was like, I don't know how this is gonna work.
 And then when did you fly back?
  </li><li>I flew back on Thursday.
  </li><li>And it's now Sunday and you've been in bed nonstop.
 So there's a miracle you're up on your feet tonight.
 If I had a, I don't know if a camera was made
 post this Instagram. AJ, if you can imagine, is standing up in our studio. She's standing
 with one arm on her back. God bless you. Look at this dedication for podcasting.
 Yeah, come on. Give me some points. But the really cool thing, babe, but all the flight
 stuff was member, both you and Sarah Jackson texted and said, "I'm praying that God sends
 a friend or something to help." And on the flight from Chicago to Nashville, who was
 sitting next to me, but Josh acts.
  </li><li>Our chiropractor friend.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So when he got in the flight, he was like right away,
 like, what's wrong with you?
 I was like, I think I'll put my back out.
 So as soon as we get off the flight, he adjusted me,
 which was super helpful, obviously.
  </li><li>And then our own beloved chiropractor
 has been making house visits,
 as well as our beloved massage therapist.
 Is that a correct term massage therapist?
  </li><li>Well, she is a massage therapist,
 but now she's trained in something better,
 which is like resetting muscles.
  </li><li>Yeah, and she's been doing that nonstop and it's crazy.
 It's like on/off switches for your muscles.
  </li><li>It's pretty wild.
 So I've had good care and I think that's probably
 why I am up and walking.
 My mom texted me last night and she said,
 "My dad's back went out like that,
 grandpa's back went out like that,
 and he had to lie in bed for two weeks
 and you just need to listen to whatever they tell you to do
 and I'm like, I am not lying in bed for two weeks."
 No, you are not.
 I'm building you a pulley to get up.
 The interesting thing is because your back has been out,
 I have not been able to sleep in bed with you.
 No, you haven't poor things.
 'Cause every time the bed moves, I'm an agony.
 So I'm just like--
 Or if I roll over and pull a sheet the wrong way.
 So I've been sleeping on the floor.
 Yes.
 Which is not fun, but I'm getting amazing sleep.
 I can verify that.
 I was gonna record it for you last night,
 but I could hear you snoring in the bedroom with the door.
 From the living room.
 I was like, well, I know he's asleep.
  </li><li>But tonight I'm sleeping with MJ.
 The girls, we have 10 and eight year olds,
 they're doing a sleepover in their own rooms.
 MJ's like, "Hey, who's gonna do a sleepover with me?"
 And I was like, "Why am I sleeping on the floor?"
 He's got bunk beds in his room.
 I'm sleeping in with him.
 So tonight we're gonna have a boy sleepover.
  </li><li>Well, we're trying to make things fun, aren't we,
 for vacation.
 So they're like, "We're on vacation."
 So they're having a sleepover in their room.
  </li><li>And the other thing is, you're supposed to be finishing
 your third part of your father hearts here as a church,
 but you just were lazy or what was the deal?
 I was just totally lazy.
 I just didn't feel like doing it.
 No, I can't move my arms.
 So even though I'm standing, I can't lift anything.
  </li><li>Well, yesterday you couldn't stand up
 and breathe at the same time.
  </li><li>Well, that's true.
 Yeah, but I can do that for at least 15 or 20 minutes
 in a row now.
 So I mean, I'm just, I know I'm shown off.
  </li><li>So proud.
 And so I spoke for you.
 I spoke. - You did it.
 You did a great job.
  </li><li>How do you know you didn't even watch?
  </li><li>Yeah, I did watch.
 I watched the first service.
  </li><li>Yeah, okay.
 I'm kind of glad you didn't watch
 'cause I said some humorous things in the second service.
  </li><li>Oh, well, they're gonna upload the video, you know,
 so I will be able to watch it.
  </li><li>You're gonna be too busy.
  </li><li>Now I'm motivated.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Which is funny because I was speaking this morning
 on orphan thinking.
 The stinking thinking that keeps us from walking a sonship.
 Which, coincidentally enough,
 I thought we should talk about tonight on the podcast.
  </li><li>Well, already then.
  </li><li>And then I have a whole bunch of listen questions
 that are brilliant questions.
  </li><li>Oh good.
 overview of the whole orphan mindset?
 Well, the orphan mindset, yeah, I mean, we, it's funny, because when we first
 started doing this teaching, you know, most of us are calling it the orphan spirit.
 But of course, it isn't a spirit.
 It's actually a mindset.
 It's a, it's a way of thinking.
 Um, but it's basically living like you don't have a dad, a great dad in heaven
 that's taking care of you.
 So you don't realize that you have security and you have love and you have purpose.
 And so you basically have to fight and strive for everything that you need in life.
 Here's the funny thing about that, though, babe, because I was sharing this morning.
 I first heard Jack Frost teach this in like, I don't know, 14, 15 years ago, maybe.
 Yeah.
 And I remember thinking, oh, this teaching doesn't apply to me because I know the Bible
 better than these people.
 Oh, so what, so what you just said is it's like that you don't know that you have a
 loving father or you don't know you have a good, you don't kind of father.
 And I was like, oh, I can call it all the verses.
 Right.
 So when I say no, I mean, you live like it's true.
 And there was a big difference.
 But here's what I was thinking this morning, it came to me as I was teaching.
 If you were teaching last week about father types, this whole concept that subconsciously we've taken our interactions with our earthly father.
 And we've then overlaid that on our relationship with our heavenly father.
 For example, if you had a distant father, that's what your model of fathering looks like.
 So it's all in all likelihood your relationship with your heavenly father is going to be distant and you're not going to think there's anything wrong with that because that's what fathering is right.
 So there's a danger that we could be living with less than Jesus paid for because our norm is normal to us but could be seriously under nourished.
 According to what's available from from Jesus so how do you know if you're thinking like an orphan versus thinking like a son.
 Well that's a good question. Did you come up with an answer for that question?
 I did. I said by age of books, she wrote two chapters on it.
 Well no seriously, seriously though, because the danger is we all have a normal and it's just good
 to examine the normal. Is your normal, a scriptural normal, or is it just what you have?
 Because for example, I used the example of, you know, I was kind of facetious, is it how many of
 of you know, those crazy Christians who actually think that God cares about where they park
 in a parking lot. You know, you've met those Christians who are like, I have a parking
 and 19. And I said, yes. Here's the crazy thing about those people is like, AJ is one
 of them. You actually think that God cares about where you park. He does. And as a result
 of your belief, you always have amazing parking spots. It's true. It is hysterical. It doesn't
 even, I don't, I don't even sweat going to the mall on Black Friday, because I know I
 I will have a spot near the door.
  </li><li>Right, and my point was to the people who actually believe
 that God cares about that, they see the fruit of it.
 To the people who think that's dumb,
 they park in like law F or G and walk all satisfied
 that see God doesn't care about your parking.
 And that's, that's, you know, here's the thing,
 God does care about little things,
 but if you don't know that,
 you're never gonna access that part of his heart.
  </li><li>And the thing is, parking matters to me.
 So that's some of it too.
 It's like there may be, maybe it doesn't matter to you where you park, but it matters to me.
 And because it matters to me and he's a good dad, it matters to him.
 Right.
 Which I can just imagine people freaking out listen to that.
 Right. I know. I know.
 Well, whatever.
 Here's the other thing.
 Here's a scriptural example of that.
 I was thinking about Luke 15, prodigal son.
 Yeah.
 Thinking about the older son.
 Yeah.
 So that, you know, part of the concept that people struggle with is, well, how can I have orphan thinking
 if I'm a son of God.
 First John three, verse one, you know,
 a great is a love that God has lavished upon us
 that we should be called children of God in such we are.
  </li><li>Right. - Right?
 So we're children of God, we're not orphans.
 But Jesus told the story of the prodigal son
 to illustrate even though we are sons,
 we don't live like it's true.
  </li><li>Right. - For example,
 the older brother, he freaks out when the father
 slaughtered the fatted calf, the younger brother.
 And when the father's like, "Hey, dude, are you okay?"
 He's like, "Are you kidding me?
 This guy who just squanders all his money, you you slaughter the fat cat.
 You never even gave me so much as a young goat to celebrate with my friends.
 And that just instantly gives you an insight into his head.
 He's like, Hey, I've done everything right.
 I've stayed here.
 I've slaved for you.
 I've served you.
 You never give me a thing.
 And so even though he is a son and he's doing the right things, he doesn't think
 like a son.
 He's he still thinks like a say because the father's like, right, my son.
 I'm always with you.
 And everything I have is yours.
 And I was like, oh my gosh, how many of us as Christians don't understand that Jesus bought the form and gave it to us?
 That everything he has is ours and we're grumbling about what we don't have.
 Yeah.
 That's orphan thinking.
 It's totally orphan thinking.
 When you were telling that story, I was thinking about, you know, sometimes a really good indication of an orphan thinking moment is one fairness as a play.
 So as soon as you're throwing the fairness flag, there's something in your heart that believes something
 that God isn't going to answer something for you but has answered it for someone else.
 Well, it's that whole thing of other people's blessings don't come at the expense of yours.
 Right. But if you're an orphan, you think it does.
 Right. If you're an orphan, God has crocodile arms and you know, they're really short and he
 can't get to you. Right.
 You know, or he likes other people better than you.
 i don't know that maybe so there's all kinds of little heart reactions that are really good indicators that an orphan spirit or an orphan mindset.
 Is alive and well so talk to me about this because i said to them this morning i said guys i feel bad.
 All i'm doing is diagnosing when you might be thinking like an orphan we need to write a bunch of jokes like you might be an orphan if.
 I have some. I'm sure. But I said, you know, all I'm doing is diagnosing what North, I'm not actually
 giving you a solution for that. And I said part of that is because you need to get in touch with
 what you're robbed from. Because if I only give you a solution to a problem you don't think you
 have, it's a wasted solution. But let's say we are aware, let's say we have bought your brilliant book
 and we have read the chapter, the two chapters, an orphan thinking, how do we get out of thinking
 like an orphan.
 Well, I think with each situation, like when you realize, "Oh, I'm having an orphan reaction
 here.
 I'm engaging in an orphan mind thought process thing, you know, where you go, "Okay, Holy
 Spirit, what do you want to say to me about what I'm believing about God?
 You know, what am I believing?"
 And then let the Lord help you unwind that.
 Does that make sense?
 You mean it's a slower process than a magic prayer?
 No.
 I mean, it isn't a magic prayer.
 It is literally just in the moment going, wow,
 I can identify that this thing that I've always thought
 is normal or whatever is actually an orphan way of thinking.
 Holy Spirit, will you come and help me with that?
 Where did I get that from?
 Is there somebody I need to forgive?
 Can you tell me what the truth is
 that counters what I've been believing?
 So you're just asking the Lord to help you
 with a process of renewing your mind.
  </li><li>Brilliant.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then, you know,
 really the Lord is the one that moves that
 from your mind to your heart.
 And when of course when it's in your heart
 that's when you live like it's true.
  </li><li>Come on, I love it.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>All right, well if you wanna catch up
 on AJ's three part series on the follow heart,
 the last part done by somebody slightly less Canadian
 than AJ.
  </li><li>As a handsome Scottish stand in.
  </li><li>Thank you, you're under study.
 Then I'll put a look in the show notes.
 You can watch all three messages
 from that on Grace and her website.
 Are you ready for some listeners questions?
 I believe I am.
 This one's from Becky P.
 How would you explain the difference
 between a gift, an anointing, and an impartation?
  </li><li>It's a great question.
 I think in some respects,
 those terms can be used fairly interchangeably.
 There's quite a bit of overlap.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I think about when Paul says,
 I think it's Romans where he says,
 "I long to be with you so that I may impart
 "some spiritual gift to you."
 So impartation is this fascinating thing
 all the way through scripture,
 found in the Old and in the New Testament,
 where God or a man or a woman of God imparts to somebody else a gift or an anointing that
 they have to somebody else.
 And it's often through the laying on of hands, sometimes through a prophetic word.
 Like, I've been activated in gifts by prophetic words spoken over me.
 And so I think a gift ranges anywhere from, I mean, I think all gifts come from God,
 whether somebody would say, I don't even believe in God, I'm not a Christian, but you
 you recognize as a musical talent on them or there's an artistic talent, I would say
 that's a gift. It's not something that they worked to get. They've probably most certainly
 worked to refine and work to add. I'm a big believer in studying your gift. I think an
 anointing is a gift that required no effort. I don't know. I think a gift and an anointing
 can be used interchangeably.
 I think an impartation is a mechanism
 for receiving either of those things.
  </li><li>Right.
 I think too, an anointing sometimes is on a gift,
 but I don't think all gifts are anointed.
  </li><li>Ooh, pleased to unpack.
  </li><li>Well, you know how you,
 there's some people that have a gift for something,
 and they might, for example, you might have two singers.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And they both sing the exact same song,
 and it's beautifully sung in both ways,
 or by both people.
 but with one of them, you feel the impact of it,
 that you feel the anointing behind what they're singing.
 So I think sometimes an anointing rides on a gift.
 I don't think that necessarily because somebody's gifted,
 they're necessarily anointed.
  </li><li>And sometimes you have people who are anointed,
 amateurs who are not as gifted as a professional.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I think about Chris McLawney, right?
 Chris is somebody who is obviously gifted,
  </li><li>Yes.
 anointed. So when Chris just plays like an opening chord, it's crazy. There's an anointing
 on it. Somebody asked to get up and play the exact same chord and the anointing wouldn't
 be there, but there is on him. So I don't know, Becky, it's such a great question. It's
 probably worthy of a better answer than the one we've come up with, but that's my thinking
 so far.
 All right, I've got one for you, but this is from Jill P. She says,
 "Hi, Alan, I missed you while you were on hiatus and I love listening to your catch-up podcast.
 Thank you so much." My question is, what is the best ways you've found to deal with things in your
 heart that are manifesting physically? Oh, this sounds interesting. I've noticed some extreme
 emotions in the last few months surrounding specific people and circumstances. And when I
 look at it logically at these things happening, it doesn't seem that I should be bothered,
 the old "why am I reacting to this? This doesn't seem to be bothering my mind."
 But I am. I've been through enough inner healing to know that these reactions often stem from
 broken and unhealed places in my heart, but I really don't know what to do about them.
 I've asked the Holy Spirit to show me what's going on, to help me see it for what it really is,
 and to show me what I might need to do to heal. I'm also trying not to spend time trying to quote,
 unquote, figure out what my issue is and just allowing him to show me the right timing,
 but it seems frustrating and is hindering some relationships.
 Are there things I can do to speed up the process
 or at least open up myself more to keep from hindering these things from being healed?
 I hate knowing something isn't right but not being able to fix it.
 I hate seeing myself react out of a glaringly obvious hurt place
 but feeling hopeless to change it.
 Great question, Jill.
 And probably a feeling/environment we can all identify with at some point.
 Yeah, I mean, I think it sounds like you're doing all the right things in terms of, you know, your end of it, if that makes sense.
 So you talking to the Holy Spirit, you identifying a reaction that you're like, wow, that's a really big reaction to something.
 That's obviously rooted in something deeper.
 Hey, I'm going to talk to Holy Spirit about that.
 I'm going to ask him to help me out with that and help you identify stuff.
 So it sounds like you're doing all of the right things.
 Um, I, I'm assuming from your question that you feel like your reactions are doing
 some, uh, level of damage in the meantime.
 Um, so I guess my thought would be to ask the Holy Spirit to help you with that.
 Like to say, Hey, Holy Spirit, until we have this sorted out until this is, you
 know, until we know what the root of this is.
 And it's, you know, dealt with, would you help me manage me?
 Right.
 Um, and would you help me to just either not end up in the situations that
 flare it up or to know what to do when it does flare up?
 And I'd also encourage you, Jill, that, you know, God never reveals anything
 in us to make us feel bad.
 He's merely pointing to the site of the next miracle he wants to do in your life.
 And so I would encourage you to, it sounds like you've done a lot of processing
 with the Lord, which is great.
 I'd encourage you to process that with safe people in your community.
 You're inner healing people, your leaders, your pastor, your small group leader,
 whoever, and just say, Hey, this is coming up because expression reinforces
 impression.
 If you're feeling something, you can't put your fingers on it.
 Often, you know, we're our own worst counselors.
 So actually talking about it, expressing it to somebody else,
 usually gives greater clarity as to what's going on.
 And, you know, many a time I've just enjoyed sitting down with friends or
 colleagues and saying, man, this is what's going on. And I feel stumped. And they're like,
 Oh, have you considered this? I'm like, I have not, like Daniel could interpret the
 dreams of others, but he couldn't interpret his own dreams. And so yeah, try sharing that
 with other people and, and then doing what age is saying. But you know, you're on the
 right path. You really are. So just I'm sorry, it's frustrating, but it's on to something.
 Yeah. And I totally agree with Alan, of course, with what he's saying about sharing it and
 inside of safe community. Because often for me, it's those people that provide the key to unlock
 whatever it is that's going on. All right, all right, babe, I have a question for you.
 This is from Bailey S. Bailey asked, this may be silly, but I have a 10 month old baby who will be
 one years old in August. We are first time parents and I've had a lot to learn. One thing I want
 some wisdom about is gift giving. We want to celebrate our children, make them feel known and
 loved but without making them feel like the entire world revolves around them. That sounds
 bad but what I mean is that I want them to have perspective and not take it for granted,
 especially around Christmas time when most people make it about Santa and all of the gifts.
 We want our children to remember that it's not all about gifts and that there are less
 fortunate people among us. It may be something silly to spend time thinking about but I'd love
 wisdom in this area.
 Hmm.
 I think Bailey, if your everyday heart is that your kids would notice what's going on
 around them and know that there's people less fortunate and you know that kind of stuff
 that you're probably not in danger letting them have a day where they're actually celebrated.
 Right.
 So it would be different if every day was very insular and they never know about other
 kids or things that are going on in the world or whatever, and then you celebrate them and
 they never sort of get that outside perspective. But it sounds like just because that's already
 on your thought and you don't even have a one year old yet.
 Yeah, well done.
 That probably they're going to be fairly exposed to what's going on around them and you'll be able
 to have those conversations and talk to them. I do think it's super important to celebrate your
 kids. I think it speaks messages to their heart that help them through life in terms of
 of just their security level and just knowing that they're important and they're celebrated
 and they're loved.
 And so I don't, I don't, for myself, I probably wouldn't want to make one of my children's
 birthdays about less fortunate people unless that was something that they were choosing
 to do.
 Right.
 Like, so if my daughter, who's maybe a little bit older and a little bit more aware was
 like, "Hey, you know what I would like to do is I would like to give my birthday money away," or
 "I would like to do whatever." That's totally cool. That's something she's choosing, but I'm not
 going to choose that for her because actually I want to celebrate her.
 Yeah, I think the same thing, babe. I think if your day-to-day concern is for the well-being of
 other people and your children aren't insular, one day of celebrating them or two days at Christmas
 and at birthdays isn't going to be a problem. Plus, when you're one, they're not even going to
 You can remember anything.
 I know you're talking about longer term,
 but they're not gonna remember if you got them
 a pack of biscuits or a Nintendo Switch,
 which you should totally get them an Nintendo Switch.
  </li><li>And certainly, when it comes to Christmas,
 you can't get away from presents or important to kids,
 and that needs to be okay,
 'cause that's exciting.
 But obviously, as Christians,
 it's not about Santa Claus for us.
 It's about Jesus, it's about what happened.
 And so you just make sure that you're,
 while maintaining fun and celebration,
 explaining what you're celebrating.
 Yeah, so.
  </li><li>And in case you're wondering,
 we told our children from day one that Santa wasn't real.
  </li><li>That's true, we did, but we told them not to tell
 other children in case, you know.
 So this is Becca G.
 And her question is, hi Alan and AJ,
 I've been reading through Finding Father,
 and I really enjoy the journey it's been taking me on.
 But I find, as I come across the reflection
 and activation section of the day,
 that I get stressed when it mentions soaking.
 I love the idea of soaking and hearing from God clearly,
 but even when I have felt that I have checked all the boxes
 to prepare for soaking,
 it is still hard to quiet my thoughts and connect with God,
 even though I know he is always with me.
 I also struggle with laying down to soak
 because I find myself falling asleep.
 Do you have any encouragement or advice
 on how I can better achieve soaking?
 I do because Becca, what you're describing is everything that me and AJ both went through learning to soak.
 I honestly thought soaking was the biggest waste of time.
 Me too.
 I was like, what is the point I'm lying on the floor doing nothing?
 Do you realize how many other things I could be doing?
 So part of what's happening is you're just learning a new discipline.
 Like anything new that you learn sucks.
 We're trying to teach our kids how to swim at the moment,
 and it's just like watching an octopus on crack.
 It's like terrifying.
 Yeah, so they look like they're gracefully drowning.
 Right.
 And so whenever you're learning a new thing or learning a drive, learning a bake, you're
 constantly in a state of flux because you're like, "Am I doing it right?
 I don't know.
 Is it like Mercik, no maneuver?
 I don't know.
 How do I fold in egg whites?
 Is that the same as stirring?
 And I know I'm going to screw it."
 And you just get freaked out.
 And so the way that goes away is just by continual practice.
 And I know you're thinking, "But if I'm doing it wrong, won't doing more of the same thing,
 doing it wrong, make it even more wrong?"
 It really doesn't.
 It all sorts itself out.
 So like any discipline, it just needs to be practiced.
 In terms of not wanting to fall asleep, my encouragement is do at a time when you'd not
 normally fall asleep.
 Right.
 So if you like typically are tired in the afternoons and could nap, that's not a good
 soaking time for you.
 So there's just some things you can do that are logical steps that help it be a little
 bit easier.
 One of the things that I tend to do is have pen and paper or my phone with me to write
 down a list so that if there's things that are sort of coming to my mind that I think,
 "Oh, I should be doing this and now I need to remember that," and you know, whatever
 that are distracting me from being able to just be totally peaceful, I just sort of
 jot him down real fast so that I can get back into a space with the Lord.
 And also being an environment that's conducive to your own heart.
 Like if somebody was, if I was reading a book about how communion was God, they're like,
 go outside and go for a walk in nature and just breathe in, you know, God's beauty.
 That right away would just not be good for me because I'd be like, I hate the outdoors.
 There's mosquitoes.
 And it would be perfect for me.
 And it would be perfect for AJ.
 So maybe lying down isn't good for you.
 So find an environment that is good for you and, you know, try that.
 But stick with it.
 Just persevere.
 I think that you're doing great.
 I think your heart to have it work is the key to having it work.
 I think the Lord is going to honor your diligence and your efforts.
 Your opinion.
 All right, baby, the last question for this week is from Lisa D.
 Are you ready?
 Yeah, I'm ready.
 Lisa writes this first and foremost, I absolutely love your podcast and I'm
 constantly recommending it to others.
 Thank you so much.
 Appreciate you doing that.
 I'm writing today because I'm starting a small group with a few women around
 my age from my church.
 I've been wanting to read your book, Finding Father, but was curious to find
 out if you've heard of a small group doing a study with the book.
 I'll stop there. Have you heard of small groups doing study with the book?
 Yes, many.
 Yeah, from prisons and soccer camps to small groups to home groups.
 Football teams.
 Yeah.
 Churches, everybody.
 Yeah.
 All right. Are there any additional resources for a study like that?
 Can I lead the study if I've not read the book before?
 I had also remembered hearing a few months ago on your podcast that you would be
 releasing videos in conjunction with the book.
 When will the videos be available?
 And would you recommend waiting for the videos to begin this study?
 Thanks.
 Wow, those are great questions, Lisa.
 I think yes, we have videos that we're currently just finishing up the editing on, and we hope
 to get those out soon.
 Well, good news is we're about to go on vacation, and there's nothing I like to do more on
 vacation than video editing.
 Oh, yeah.
 So we've got how many videos, babe?
 12.
 They've all been recorded.
 They've all, we've edited two of them.
 We've got another 10 to finish editing, and then we need to work out a way for distribution
 So we do have videos.
  </li><li>I think if the, Lisa, if the father heart message is new to you,
 it might be good to at least do the book on your own first
 and let the Lord sort of talk you through it
 before you take another group through it,
 or at least be like halfway into the book before you start
 so that you've got a good foundation of where you're going,
 what you're looking at, and you can sort of encourage them
 if they do get stuck about what's coming.
 But certainly once the videos come out, that would probably be your most helpful way of
 leading a group through it because then you don't actually have to teach it yourself.
 And a good primer might be to watch the last three weeks that you've taught at Grace and
 her on the follow-har message.
 Yeah, that would help a lot.
 The right introduction to the course.
 Again, I'll put a link to that in the show notes.
 Yeah.
 All right, well, we are done for this week.
 As you probably heard me say about two minutes ago, we are on vacation for the next two
 weeks, baby vacation.
 Boop, boop.
 So I think after the last few months that we've had what with my father passing away,
 my back going out, your mother falling over and breaking her hip and your back going
 out, we are ripe for a vacation.
 Yes.
 So we're going to be resting.
 That means there's going to be no podcast for the next two weeks.
 We just are looking forward to some downtime.
 The next episode should be released ready for Monday, the 31st of July.
 So we hope you enjoy two weeks without our dulcet tones in your ears.
 Until then, I'm going to post the top 10 episodes of this podcast for all time on our website.
 Have a look at them if you've missed any.
 Listen to those for the next couple of weeks and we should be back at the end of the month.
 Sounds perfect.
 Okay, we pray that you have an incredible two weeks of rest and incredible encounters
 with the Lord.
 If you want the show notes for this week's episode, go to allen and AJ.com/157 and you

 Alright guys, thanks for being with us.
 We'll see you in two weeks time.
