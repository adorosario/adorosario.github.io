<p> I've come to horrible conclusion.<br/>
 What's that?<br/>
 We may be the most boring people on the planet.
 We may be.<br/>
 And I say that based on this week's activity.
 When I sat down to review, what do we do this week?
 We did very little.<br/>
 That's what my pause was for.<br/>
 But I...<br/>
 My pause was to indicate how little we had done.
 And it was spring break for good mistake.
 I know, poor babies.<br/>
 You know what I think is the problem?<br/>
 What?<br/>
 I think the problem.<br/>
 is that the holidays keep or vacation times keep sneaking up on us because we're not
 completely Americanized yet and we haven't got into the rhythm and the routine of
 remembering oh yes spring break is coming up or Memorial Day we can or so
 we keep forgetting to take time off and do something with that yes we should
 remember next year like because it was amazing kids had a week off we could have
 done something. We could have gone somewhere warm. That's not raining. Right. But instead
 we stayed home and it rained. We did. And then we worked. Yes, we did. But you were a
 great parent. You took them to the zoo. I refuse to go just done. My religious beliefs
 about the engagement of animals. Right. Okay. That's why you didn't go. Is it? Or I just
 don't like the outdoors. I was thinking that's probably more. How was the zoo? The zoo was
 Good. It's under construction. I guess they're putting, I remember last year reading something
 about them, the city putting like $10 million into the zoo. That's probably not the right figure,
 but you know, some enormous amount of money. Right. And it looks like we're actually going
 to eventually have lions, which yes, the zoo right now doesn't have lions, but we might have them.
 And you're excited about lions? Well, it'd be nice to have a few more animals. You can literally
 do our entire zoo in about an hour and a half. Why do I feel like you're going to say something
 about Toronto. Toronto, Australia, Singapore, they all have really big suits, Chicago.
 Yeah. I couldn't recognize most of the animals you took photographs of.
 Well, every reason I only showed you one picture and it was a goat that was lying down.
 Well, it looked like a goat without any legs. Well, that's because it was lying on top of it.
 It was missing one horn and fairness.<br/>
 Right. So what was it supposed to do? And then the other one you had a picture of Tia with a large rat.
 It's a kangaroo.<br/>
 Again, was it lying down?<br/>
 No, it was standing up.<br/>
 Ah, I didn't like a kangaroo.<br/>
 Wow. I was just... she wanted to touch it and I was like, "Don't touch it. They're like large
 jumping rats." But she wanted to touch it. And the zookeeper was like, "They're very soft and
 they're very friendly. Just don't touch the really big red ones."
 Why am I to touch a really big red ones?
 I don't know.<br/>
 I don't know.<br/>
 They didn't really stop for people.<br/>
 They just sort of case the joint.<br/>
 At one point it was blocking the way out.
 Let's go back next.<br/>
 We can encourage you to touch the red one to see what happens.
 Now let's pick somebody else's kid and encourage them to touch the red one.
 That's horrible.<br/>
 Um, the real reason I stayed home.<br/>
 Well, the real reason was I don't want to go to the zoo.
 That's right.<br/>
 The second real reason the excuse you used was I did home to work in our taxes.
 So it's funny, you know, I feel like I just got grown up enough to understand British tax
 system. And then I moved to Canada. And then after a couple of years began to get the Canadian
 tax system underneath my belt. And then we moved here. Sorry, babe. And I've been here,
 what is this our six year? This is? Yep. And I still don't understand our taxes.
 which praise God for good accountants. Yes, very thankful for that.
 You know what I've been doing when I should have been doing my taxes?
 What? Wait, let me be afraid that again. You know what I did in addition to doing our taxes?
 What? Because I spent a lot of time on YouTube. You did.
 I know that comes as a huge surprise to you. I am shocked and appalled.
 But I stumbled upon somebody I've known about for a long time and have watched his videos several
 times, but I spent large quantities of time this weekend watching videos of Ravi Zacharias.
 Yes, you did. Yeah, he's an Indian DJ. He's kind of got a hip hop bang grab mashup.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. She just can't help yourself. Come on, me.
 Ladies and gentlemen, I'm so sorry.
</p><ul>
  <li>I'm sorry.
  </li><li>I'm sorry.
  </li><li>I just, really.
 The only sound effect I could actually do is this.
 (popping)
 (laughing)
  </li><li>And that's why I married you right there.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>But the thing is women can't make sound effects.
 You know that right?
 Only men do sound effects.
 Women, very few women can do sound effects.
  </li><li>Okay, give me a sound effect and I'll do it.
  </li><li>A machine gun.
  </li><li>Okay.
 (explosion)
 Give me another one.
 in elephant.
 How big you're impressive.
 You're right. I am quite good at them.
 You are remarkable.
 Do you want to ask me to do any
 sentiments? So
 so Ravi Zacharias.
 Actually, the first time I ever heard Ravi Zacharias.
 I know I made a joke about him being an Indian DJ.
 He is from India and Canada and America.
 But the first time I heard him was a mashup.
 Somebody had taken one of his sermons
 and mashed it up with some dance music and it was really really good. But anyway, I've watched
 them several times. But I spent the whole weekend, and for those of you who don't know who Ravi Zacharice
 is, he's a professor who has traveled around the world for, I don't know, 30 years, 42 different
 nations. And he's a statesman for the kingdom of God. He really is. He's his main ministry is in
 in the area of apologetics, defense of the gospel.
 And so you often see him in debates with leading atheists.
 And but he's so gracious and so wise.
  </li><li>And where he speaks. - It's called "Labs"
 but brilliant.
  </li><li>Yeah, wherever he speaks, he does a Q&amp;A.
 He speaks a lot of universities.
 I would highly recommend visiting his website,
 rgim.org or if you're British, rzim.org.
  </li><li>Or Canadian.
  </li><li>Or Canadian.
  </li><li>Or Australian.
  </li><li>Or Australian.
 from New Zealand. Just go to the show notes. I've typed out for you. Or just search for him on
 YouTube. Just great, great, great in like seven minutes sound by answers. Anyway, got me really
 interested in apologetics. Cool. I'm going to invite some of his people to come and teach
 on school in second year. Some of his people to come and teach? He has a whole team of people.
 I doubt we'll ever get Ravi. He's like two and a half years out in advance. But he has a whole team
 with people who minister and that would be cool. Come on, let's do that. Anyway, that's what you can do.
 My mom, your mom, I got a speaker this week. Yes, you. She was in hospital for most of the week
 and didn't have Wi-Fi. Imagine a hospital with that Wi-Fi. Well, maybe they're trying to make
 them rest. Oh, that would not be wrestle for me. No, nor the nurses.
 But anyway she's home and she's really really bright and really happy and so everybody's been
 asking and thank you for your love and your care for my mom. But she's home she's very bright,
 she had an infection I think on her chest which is why she had to go to hospital but
 allows she's back. Talk to me about allergies while I sneeze.
 Sweet Alan has allergies and Abby seems to have them a little bit too. She seems to be a little
 sneezing festival, but you have been definitely
 barraged.
 Is it because Nashville is a dussel?
 Is that what they say?
 Yeah, it's because we're surrounded by hills on all sides.
 So apparently all the allergens just stay in.
 So when the seasons change, is that what it does it?
 I don't understand how it works.
 I don't know fully.
 And you've been trying to hippie medicine on me.
 Everybody says eat local honey.
 I'm like, no, I've tried eating local honey.
 It's delicious, but does nothing for my allergies.
 Okay. And then you were trying to get me to do it.
 Yeah, but you only had it three times.
 I've knew wing of bear.
 No. I was trying to get you to do all those to tear a allergy oils.
 Which you fed me what? Peppermint?
 Three times. Oh, peppermint, lemon, and lavender.
 Two drops of each in some water.
 And I did nothing.
 But you didn't take it pretty many times.
 Well, how many times are you supposed to take it?
 I took it three times in one day.
 You did not.
 You took it twice one day and once the next day.
 That was it.
 Right.
 And the reason I took it, I refused to take it anymore is it didn't give me any relief.
 But I think it's the kind of thing you have to build up in your system, darling.
 Oh.
 It's just like...
 Tell what it says in the hippie guide to Madgy Caron.
 I drank an ounce of water.
 Why do I still feel dehydrated?
 Water doesn't work.
 Well, you actually have to drink a little bit more than that.
 Okay.
 So you think this week I should just drink that, what?
 Three, four times a day?
 I think they say two or three times a day.
 Why don't you try it for a week
 and then you can tell everybody if it worked.
  </li><li>All right, fine.
 I'll try it for a week.
 (Mm-hmm)
 I will become a hippie.
 I will stop washing my hair
 and I will wear hemp clothing
 and I will use my essential oils.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Anything else happened this week?
  </li><li>We went to Flipburgers, didn't we?
  </li><li>We did.
 Up in the Sylvan Park area in Nashville.
 we did. So we did an impromptu date with my cousins. We did a nice little double date
 up there. It was very fun. They do strange things with their sangria with like, what's
 that called? Dry, not drydax? Was it drydax?
 Yeah, it was drydax. Or no, what's it called? Liquid nitrogen? No, it's hydrogen peroxide.
 Yeah, that's what it is. Oh, it's something. I don't know if it's hydrogen peroxide.
 anyway, it's something that was liquid nitrogen.
 Yeah. Yeah. So it kind of freezes and smokes the top of it and then it looks normal again.
 And then they had a foie gras milkshake.
 Yeah, which we didn't try.
 Mm-hmm. The guy was trying to convince us that he's like, "No, it's quite sweet and everything's still disgusting, still disgusting."
 They had good onion rings.
 They did. And the toppings on their burgers were very interesting.
 You know, I had this week, which was delicious going in, but not so nice coming out.
 Yeah.
 Do we need to talk about this?
 Yeah, I've kind of already had.
 It was Korean street tacos, and they were delicious, but they did not sit well with
 my constitution.
 No, no indeed.
 Should I go on?
 No.
 Okay.
 No, indeed.
 I have some list of questions.
 Okay.
 might help us segue into our topic. The first one isn't a question, but it's a sweet comment.
 It's from Chris Law, who's an amazing photographer, by the way. His Twitter username is Chris
 Law photos and I browse his Twitter feed for some Friday morning and the tech excellent
 photos. He said this, "I was excited to hear about your school of supernatural life students
 heading out around the world. I met your team to South Africa led by Blake and Ashley two
 years ago when my missions team from Bethel School of Supernatural Ministry were also in
 now spread at the same time. Such a pleasure to minister alongside them, have fun together
 and see the ways we had so much to share with one another. When it was time for our team to
 head home, we really felt like we were leaving family behind. It's very nice of you to write
 that, Chris. Thank you. Our students are actually with a Bethel school team right now in Scotland.
 They were ministering together in Edinburgh. Yes, they were. That's correct.
 So we have team right now in Uganda who just the photos are amazing, the test is amazing.
 Yeah. Lots of healings and incredible.
 And the kids are so cute.
 Beautiful, absolutely adorable.
 We have team in Scotland, an all-female team.
 So all the Scottish men that I know who are not yet married and are not creepy.
 You might want to head to Aberdeen this week and get managed to buy some awesome
 Holy Spirit-filled women.
 And are not creepy.
 Yeah, well, I don't want our students coming back and going,
 a bunch of creepy guys came out and told us that...
 Can we post some sort of link to a self assessment creepy test?
 Yeah, absolutely.
 Absolutely.
 So they were in Glasgow, they were in Edinburgh, and now they're in Aberdeen this week.
 So guys were so proud of you, we love you.
 We have a team in Georgia, they were in Mississippi and now they're in Georgia.
 And they're one of our favorite places to be.
 They were with Mac and Allison.
 Yes, very beautiful.
 St. Simons Island.
 On St. Simons Island.
 Yet they're doing ministry there this week.
 We have another team here in Nashville.
 And then we have another team who stayed home and prayed for everybody.
 And we haven't done it with them all this week.
 It's true.
 It should be awesome.
 The team in Nashville has been seeing some incredible miracles as well, apparently.
 You can find out all about that at schoolsupernaturallife.org/blog,
 where they've been blogging and posting photos and videos and whatnot.
 Right.
 You ready for an actual question?
 Yes.
 All right.
 This is from Nina.
 She said, hi, Joneses.
 I'm right to ask for any wisdom. You'd like to share regarding maintaining thriving friendships
 through life transitions. Many of my closest friends are courageously following the call of
 God in their lives, and the journey has yielded moves across the country and around the world.
 In your experience of living and traveling internationally, what kind of advice do you have for stewarding
 long-distance friendships well? I think it's funny because in many ways,
 I mean, we've had our fair share of people who've moved away from our life, and then we've had a fair share of moving away from other people's lives.
 And I think that when, for example, when I left Scotland, I left some great friends and moved to Canada,
 and they were very, very gracious in understanding that I'm now leaving their orbit of normal everyday life.
 So just throw in one aspect of living on the other side of the world as a time change.
 So even now with friends and family in Scotland, realistically, I can't connect with any of them till the weekends.
 Right.
 Because by the time I'm done with my daily responsibilities here, they're all asleep.
 You know, Monday through Friday.
 Yeah.
 So that instantly narrows down your opportunity to stay connected to the end of the week.
 And it's not like their life has got any less busy because I left the country.
 And now i'm in a different country developing new friendships of course.
 And so you absolutely have to adjust to different rhythm a different pace and of course a different frequency of communication.
 And then i think it has to be a ton of grace on that and we've got a bunch of relationships that.
 For example that long distance and we don't see those people we rarely skype will follow each other instagram when we see each other again at conferences or we're in the same country together.
 we just pick up where we last left off. Then we've got other relationships with people who are far,
 far away. I'm thinking of Gary and Sarah, for example, where we'll face time with them several
 times a month. Then I've got other relationships where it's entirely text-based. Then I've got other
 relationships where they have just fizzled and died not because you aren't interested in their lives
 or because you don't care, but just the paths of life and the pace at which you're working,
 you just never come into each other's orbits. And I think you have to be very, very flexible
 with all those things. Because in the meantime, while we're here, we've cultivated new relationships.
 So I think some relationships are seasonal and some relationships are lifelong and the ones that
 are lifelong. They survive the distance. They survive the distance. Yeah. And I would say with
 those ones, even if I haven't talked to some of those friends in months, my affection for them
 them hasn't changed. And just when you do get to see them, it does feel like you just
 were with them yesterday.
 Yeah.
 So, yeah.
 Nina, I think it's interesting that you don't have to have people move to the side of the
 world to cope with the flux of relationships. Because even if those people were still here
 geographically, everybody goes through changes, people get married, people have kids, people
 get new jobs and that will change the available energy, time and impetus for relationships.
 And I think you just get to ebb and flow with them.
 And I don't think you can have one method for how that looks.
 I think you need to just sort of almost take it as it comes and then just realize some
 friends, like Alan was saying, some of you are texting with all the time, I have some
 friends I'm texting with all the time and I have some that I'm totally not.
 it's usually both it's both sided if that makes sense to us what do you mean well
 um the friends that I'm like shooting text back and forth they do the same
 thing like they'll shoot me a text hey miss you think about you today you know
 blah blah or they'll send some little funny thing or whatever and then I'll
 shoot it you know and it doesn't matter that they're in a different country and
 you know whatever and then I have some friends who again my level of affection
 for them hasn't changed but we don't really communicate at all unless there's
 those moments of coming together in the same place.
 Right.
 So, I just sort of, I'm not trying to make one relationship look like another, I'm just
 taking it as it comes.
 So, Nina, I'm not sure if any of that was helpful.
 Other than give each other lots of grace and you can't force relationships and you also
 have to let relationships breathe.
 Yeah.
 All right, our topic for this week is based loosely off a conversation we had in bed
 the other night. That's dangerous. Not that. It was one of those we went to bed and I just
 said to you, "Hey babe, this is what I've been thinking about." And then we talked about
 it for a while. So do you want to do a recap? Well, I think we were talking about like,
 what do you do when you know that God has a call in your life and it's more than what
 you're walking in right now. And how do you balance that with walking in what you're walking
 in right now and not getting frustrated or taking your eyes off the goal kind of thing?
 Yeah. It's funny. I'm in the process of writing an article for our website on that, which I
 hadn't put two and two together to realize that's what I was doing. But I was. I just
 thing is really interesting because we meet people all the time who have passions or desires
 or feel like God put stuff in their spirit, but their environment doesn't seem to back
 any of that up. A great biblical example would be Joseph, for example, who's all these words,
 dreams, and prophecies about his life. And yet for the vast majority of his life, he's
 either a slave or in prison or both.
 Right.
 And so his surrounding context seems to suggest that he's a fool for even believing those
 things.
 And yet you keep reading the book and you realize, no, no, no, no, all those words were
 pointing to reality.
 So how do you not get disappointed or discouraged or dismayed when you're working at Whole Foods,
 but you feel called to be a film director?
 How do you not get discouraged when you're a stay at home mom, but you feel like God's
 called you to, you know, minister to the nations?
 You know, so we've just been thinking about that.
 And I, it's a real interesting challenge to say yes to God in the future, as well as
 yes to God and your daily responsibilities.
 Yeah, because you need to stay in the present.
 That's the whole thing of blossoming where you're planted.
 I think as I think about it, like every job I've ever had, every promotion I've ever had,
 I've never really been looking for promotion.
 I've just been looking to give my 100% to whatever's been put in front of me to do.
 And even with church stuff and ending up in ministry and all that kind of stuff, I wouldn't
 have said that was the goal.
 My goal was just to serve in whatever areas were put in front of me that I could serve
 and things just kept opening up for me to walk a little further and walk a little further.
 Does that make sense?
 It does make sense.
 So I think there's, I think it's a huge key to stay in the moment, stay humble, stay present
 in the things that God's asked you to do and do a great job on the things that God's asked you to do
 until he opens the door to the next thing.
 I fully agree. I remember, I don't know how many years ago it was, but you know,
 I remember a number of years ago I felt in my quiet time with the Lord, all the Lord was
 talking about was what we're doing now.
 And talking about prayer and prophecy and training and equipping and living in a different
 country and administering in different parts of the world.
 I was a school teacher.
 I just thought, how is that ever going to be the case?
 And so it's weird because on the one hand, all your time with the Lord, he's just brewing
 all these thoughts of destiny and dreams in the future and yet the reality is tomorrow you have
 to teach third year programming and you haven't marked a homework that you need to do and you
 haven't made the assessment that's due on Friday. And so the real temptation is to just drift off
 into the dream life about what God's going to be doing because let's face it's far sex,
 you're far more interesting, far more fulfilling than doing your present day duties. But the trouble
 as I'm paid to do my present-day duties, I'm not paid to dream about the future.
 Right.
 And so part of that is I just said, "Lord, I have no idea.
 I feel all this stuff in my heart, but I don't see any avenues for it.
 I don't see any opportunities of how I can get into living in another country or how
 I could do this or how I could do that."
 But I do have these responsibilities.
 I'm going to take the energy and the passion, the stuff I want to show into my dreams and
 so into today.
 And I just thought, "It's not glamorous.
 It's not why I want to be a school teacher."
 is what I am right now, so I'm going to be the best culture I possibly can.
 But you're always living with a yes in your heart towards whatever God has to do.
 Right. And you're taking baby steps towards that.
 But you're not trying to make it happen or crowbar your way into an anointing or a calling
 or any of that kind of stuff.
 One of the things that I see a lot of people do or have a fear in their heart,
 and I certainly understand that is, you know, we encourage people to serve somebody else's vision.
 and I think somewhere in our hearts we've realized or we believe the lie that if I serve your vision,
 it comes at the expense of my vision. And that's absolutely not the case. You so where you want to
 go. So in us serving, for example, John and Carol, or serving Jeff and Becky, like we find tremendous joy
 in doing that. And that's not at the expense of what God may or may not be doing in our lives in
 10, 15, 20 years down the line, it's saying yes to what God's asked of us now while
 nodding yes to what we think he's asking us to do in the future. So me going and serving the
 vision of my headmaster or the principle of the school I worked in wasn't a trade-off of the
 vision I had in my heart of what was coming. Does that make sense?
 Yeah. But I think I see lots of people scared to quote and quote, settle down or scared to get a
 nine to five job because they feel like God's called them to be an entrepreneur or scared to,
 you know, put a lease on a house or buy a house or, you know, settle down or put down roots rather
 because they're worried that that's coming at the expense of the dream of their heart. But that's
 not the way God works. Right. You're not bigger than your destiny, so to speak. You're not going to
 to do something that's going to talk God out of your destiny.
 Short of disobedience and refusal to see.
 I was going to say, well, hopefully you're not.
 Right.
 Right.
 I just think God's majesty is that you just blossom where you're planted and it actually
 accelerates the next season of your life.
 Yeah.
 And so that I would totally agree with that.
 I just think from observation, some of the people that I've seen that I'm still like,
 Why hasn't there been a breakthrough is they haven't learned to be where they are and blossom
 there.
 They're always forward looking, if that makes sense.
 They're always thinking about what they feel that they're called to rather than being present
 in the moment and learning how to serve or learning the things that God needs them to
 learn so that he can promote them.
 So I think, you know, there's, there's so many benefits of being able to live in the
 moment. And it doesn't mean that you stop dreaming with God. It's just that you recognize in
 dreaming with God, you say, "Yeah, God, that's awesome." I say yes. And now, right where I am,
 right where I'm planted, I'm going to walk out the destiny that you have for me today
 in this moment. Right. It's saying yes to the now. Right. It's so easy to say yes to
 the future because it doesn't actually require anything. There's no commitment, no follow
 through needed.
 And I think that God isn't going to open up the future, yeses, until we learn how to
 be present in the now.
 I think thankfulness is another key to probably.
 Unlocking the thing.
 Well just, yeah, I mean I was going to say unlocking the storehouses of heaven, but just,
 I think living from a place of being thankful, regardless of what your current circumstances
 are it does unlock something in your heart that enables you to live in the place where
 you are without grumbling and get whatever you're supposed to get out of it.
 So that's our encouragement for anybody who's listening to this who feels like they have
 a dream and a destiny in which you all do.
 By the way, you feel like you have something in your heart that you would long to be doing
 but you're stuck doing something different.
 Do this something different with great applause and watch God open doors that you couldn't,
 You didn't even know we're there.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>All right, any closing thoughts, Adjjones?
  </li><li>I don't think so.
 Do you have any closing thoughts?
  </li><li>I have two.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>We have an amazing conference coming up.
 May 15th and 16th.
 Go to musthavemore.com.
 We have Graham Cook and Jonathan David
 and Melissa Helser coming to the conference.
  </li><li>Can I get a whoop, whoop?
  </li><li>And then our school of supernatural life,
 we're talking earlier about our students.
 We are our school of supernatural life.
 We were talking about them earlier.
 They're currently on average.
 We would love it if you would come and do our school.
 If you go to schoolsupernaturallife.org,
 you can find that information all about our eight month
 school and we'd love the opportunity
 to invest in your life and see God change it
 in radical ways.
  </li><li>And we've already accepted,
 started accepting students for both year one and year two.
 So it's exciting.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, that's right.
 That's what you did.
  </li><li>It's really, really early in the year.
 Yeah, I mostly just read apps and accepted apps.
 Yeah.
  </li><li>Come on.
 What we hope you have an amazing week.
 Yes.
 We'll try and be more interested next week.
 Yeah, we're going to try and do something dangerous or scary this week.
 So we have something to talk about.
 We are.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 That's awesome.
 Maybe we'll camp in the backyard.
 That could be dangerous.
 You never know what's out there.
