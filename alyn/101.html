<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Those wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones.
 Yes.<br/>
 How are you?<br/>
 I'm good.<br/>
 You look super hot.<br/>
 Oh, thank you.<br/>
 It's that wonder woman outfit does it for me every single time.
 Hey, yeah.<br/>
 I mean, I just have to wear it when we podcast.
 We've had a really transitional week.<br/>
 We have.<br/>
 Let's fill up highs and lows.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 We on the high end, we said goodbye to all our students who graduated on Tuesday night.
 And that's kind of the low end.<br/>
 It is also.<br/>
 I know what it looks like tomorrow to go into work and the students are there.
 And it feels weird.<br/>
 It feels weird for at least a month.<br/>
 It does because we're not teaching.<br/>
 Yeah, we're not teaching 10 times.<br/>
 We're teaching maybe once.<br/>
 I was just thinking how weird Sunday felt because I came home from church and I didn't
 have to think, oh, man, I have to polish off six teachings before I go to bed tonight.
 So, well, there's a high and a low in that too, but yeah, Tuesday night we did graduation.
 It was great to see the hall full with students and with friends and family.
 Yeah, it was amazing.<br/>
 That was incredible.<br/>
 So, big congratulations to all our graduates who graduated Tuesday night.
 You did great.<br/>
 You did awesome.<br/>
 Well done.<br/>
 You really did.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And a huge thanks to all our staff as well.
 I was thinking if we could have done graduation again, I think I would have labored the fact
 that the students would have got nothing were enough for our incredible staff.
 Yeah. I mean, we can't do this school without them.
 No, and Jeff and Becky were very kind and honoring us,
 but the real honor goes to our staff and to our small group leaders, who,
 I think it was, I forget who was, it told us this great example that often in ministry,
 you look like you're the person on the top of like a carnival float just waving at people.
 Right.<br/>
 And everyone's like, oh, you just such a good job on that carnival float.
 But in reality, there's like 100 people in bicycles underneath the carnival float making it go.
 And that's our staff. They're so hard working. And it's a fifth year that we've done the school.
 It was the first year we started a second year and we had new staff. They just got thrown in and
 we're so proud of our staff. The pace was crazy and we all made it.
 I know it's going to be Pina Coladas tomorrow.
 I can remember.<br/>
 Actually, everybody asks us also, the students aren't there.
 Like you guys just, what do you do?<br/>
 Supermellow.<br/>
 Like, you know, do you have anything like what do you do?
 One of the first things we do is we review every piece of feedback we get.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then we tweak everything and get ready for everybody who's coming in September.
 Yeah.<br/>
 We're super excited about it.<br/>
 But we also have other jobs that are.
</p><ul>
  <li>They're sort of semi-on hold for the eight months of the school,
 and the minimum is being done, and now we get to get cut up.
  </li><li>You know, on the topic of our amazing staff,
 and on the topic of other areas of responsibility,
 Michelle Vouter spoke on Monday night emanate.
  </li><li>She did a fantastic shot.
  </li><li>She was astonishing.
 Teaching on peace.
  </li><li>Growing peace.
  </li><li>We'll put a link in the show notes.
 If you don't get to see that,
 it's an excellent, practical teaching
 on how to develop more peace in your life.
 And Michelle is such a carrier of peace and joy in the Holy Spirit and watching her talk
 about that was awesome.
 Yeah.
 She's somebody you need to watch on video and not just listen to an audio because she's
 super animated.
 Yeah.
 Her arms and everything.
 I'm coming up with my own impression.
 Or or?
 Well, she does this thing with her arms or she goes like this.
 See, if you were watching me on video, you'd know what I was saying, but this is a podcast.
 Okay.
 Sorry.
 to fashion and that's Michelle voters apparently.
 Let's skip the rest of our week because it was just busy.
 There was some respite in that we had some surprise visitors from Toronto
 whenever dinner with them, but let's go straight to Friday.
 Friday. What happened Friday?
 Friday was a beautiful day.
 Is that because you have an amazing husband who surprised you or something?
 It is. You took me.
 Let's talk about me.
 OK.
 You randomly came up with the idea.
 There was no randomness.
 Well, you've never done it before.
 So I said, I surprised you.
 Yes. You surprised me with a spa day.
 That's right.
 Yes.
 We got mani patties.
 No, but that's OK, because I don't really love people touching my feet.
 Right.
 But we got massages in the same room.
 Why is that so creepy?
 I know a couple's massage.
 OK, you said couples massage.
 We paid to random strangers to touch us.
 It is kind of weird.
 Really think about it though.
 It's really weird.
 It's like, Hey, here's the money rub me.
 But it's totally fine because my wife's like next to me.
 Right.
 It's yeah.
 Yeah.
 What what's weirder is having not been in a spa before.
 So you go into separate locker rooms, obviously.
 So there's a man's room in a ladies room and you get changed.
 you put on this robe that you hope somebody has washed.
 I know I didn't think that to us like,
 they steam these or if they just like,
 wash them.
 Oh, so you're wearing this robe and then when the staff of our
 members comes and gets you and they take you through to a,
 what is called a coed relaxation room, but there's nothing.
 It's not called a coed relaxation.
 It is in all the literature.
 It doesn't take coed on it.
 It does.
 It says relaxation now.
 It's a coed relaxation lounge which is way too glamorous term for what is otherwise somebody's living room that's slightly dark while mostly undressed people with robes that don't fit properly or clothes are sitting in armchairs while waiting for your massage.
 and then nobody's talking and you're not supposed to use your phones.
 So everybody's just sort of staring at each other.
 And they're playing music, which I can only describe as soaking music without any anointing.
 So just super annoying.
 We decided to call it the lounge of awkwardness.
 So awkward because anybody who sat down or stood up, I was like, I don't know where to look.
 But they're they're they're a good lord.
 So there was nothing relaxing about that part.
 No, at all.
 No.
 but then we had but there was free free water that tasted kind of like orange or something.
 Like orange with smiling geraniums or something.
 And then and then yeah you go into this dark room and this is sounding so morbid.
 Well you know anybody's had a massage you know that usually the room is sort of darker.
 Yeah, but it was at the Gaylord Opry, which in itself is a great place.
 Yeah.
 I love going there.
 But let's gloss over that.
 That just sounds weird, dark.
 No, it was good.
 It was good.
 And then afterwards, there was like Sona's and a eucalyptus steam room, which when the steam first started firing, I thought something was horribly wrong and I was going to cook alive and I almost ran out of this team room.
 But then I decided it must be safe, but it was a little scary.
 Right. But then it got better because on Friday and Saturday of this week, we were doing our load day.
 So we have finished the first part of our diet, which was basically lose a lot of weight, maintain that weight loss for 30 days.
 And you could be done. You could be done on that bond, but we decided to go for another round.
 So in order to do that, you have to do two days of loading where you're trying to fuel your body with as much fat as possible.
 Which I took as a personal challenge.
 Yes, you did.
 Yeah, and I thought I'm going to defend my family's honor. How I will give that.
 So we went to Bartaco and feasted. Yes, we did. And it was super good.
 And then, babe, remember, we almost ran out of power in the leaf on the way home.
 Right. Talk about that. Well, in the morning, you had said,
 should we take the minivan? And I said, oh, we'll be fine.
 So yeah, so when we were getting bar taco, I realized we were not going to be fine.
 And so we drove around and we tried to find a charging station, but to our
 chagrin, there was the charging stations we found all had motorized vehicles parked
 in them.
 We have petrol based vehicles parked in electrical vehicle, parking only.
 Right.
 So after you hit their tail lights with a crowbar that we keep in the front
 work on for services. We moved on.
 Yes. So we went to a couple different places and then we sort of in Starway down Hillsboro
 Road and around Mackatcher.
 Well, you thought you thought we'll be fine.
 Yeah. I thought we'll just make it home.
 And actually true to your prophecy, we did.
 Yes.
 But it was somewhat scary to watch you go from 10% to 8%, 5%.
 You're like, babe, put your arms at the window and flap.
 Something's going to work here. I was like, babe, we're going to be fine.
 No, I just started speaking in tongues.
 But literally as we rolled into our driveway, it had.
 Everything was flashing.
 Everything was flashing.
 Zero percent zero miles as we actually as we drove into our subdivision.
 And then Saturday, you were out all day at Pearl event.
 We'll talk about that in a second.
 I stayed home and made cupcakes and Madlands with the girls and filmed it.
 They've been watching YouTube kids a lot.
 Yeah.
 So they now want to be on YouTube.
 So I spent the whole day filming.
 I haven't edited it yet, but they just love it.
  </li><li>Yeah, and they're so cute.
  </li><li>And they made awesome cupcakes.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Talk about the Pearl event.
  </li><li>The Pearl event, it was a women's event
 that I was invited to speak at.
 And Crystal Black was speaking there as well as Alex Seeley
 from the belonging and a couple of others.
 And it was great, it was a women's event.
 There was just over 100 women, I don't know how many.
 It was a long day though, wasn't it?
 It was a long day.
 Because of the marathon and the event started at nine,
 I wasn't sure what traffic would be like.
 I don't really know downtown Nashville that well.
 So we left at seven thinking,
 okay, we'll get there by eight or eight, 15 or whatever.
 And we got there like 20 to eight.
 So.
 And you didn't leave until seven p.m.
 730.
 Yeah, so we were there almost 12 hours.
 which you know it was great and in the holy spirit totally showed up and we did a fire tunnel slash pearl tunnel they got pearls at the end of the fire tunnel and
 and so there was there was lots of high points and the worship was fantastic.
 Yeah so it was fun.
 I said Saturday night we got to go for sushi.
 We did because if you're going to have a low day and you can eat anything you want you know what I want is sushi.
 Right. And if the goal is to eat fat, let's eat fatty fish.
 Yes.
 And tempura fried vegetables.
 Yes, although neither of us finished our food because it was just like, I can't do this.
 Ridiculous.
 Yeah, it was bad.
 Speaking of food, we're going to segue into our main topic.
 But I want to let you know that at the end of this podcast, we're going to be talking about giving away donuts, coffee, burgers, books, all the good things that fuel our life.
 we're going to be talking about that at the end of this podcast, talking about how we can fuel you
 with the stuff that fuels us. So stay tuned for that. All right, our main topic for this week,
 my darling, is I want to talk a little bit about learning.
 Within the context, we've just finished eight months of doing the school. And I thought we would
 pause and reflect on what it's like, not what it's like running a school, but what are some of the
 the observations we've made as we've watched hundreds of people learn stuff.
 Yeah.
 And can I share some of that?
 I remember when I was in teacher training college, I did my degree, I left, I wanted
 to be a computer person, got all the plans, I went back to do my postgraduate in teaching.
 And I had a lecture there, it was actually a tutor for a while, a great man who's now
 no longer with us.
 I hope he meant Jesus.
 I gave him a copy of CS Lewis book.
 He was an atheist at the time when I met him.
 But anyway, I digress.
 His name was Dr. Tom Conlon.
 And he very early on, he wrote up this formula on one of the white boards that
 said learning and then an equal sign and then experience plus reflection.
 His whole premise was you only learn when you reflect on an experience you had.
 So here we are.
 We got five years of running a school under a belt.
 Let's reflect on some of the experiences we've had and see if we can help people
 and ourselves learn stuff.
 Yeah, come on.
 It'd be great.
 Wednesday Churchill said this.
 He said, the most important thing about education is appetite.
 And I'd probably start there.
 I think in watching students come and get their lives transformed.
 It's true no matter where you apply this, but basically what you put in
 determines what you get out.
 Yeah.
 And yeah, it's the hungry ones.
 They get the most out of anything.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 The biggest change comes from the biggest hunger.
 Yeah.
 We had Dick Joyce with us this morning.
 Yeah.
 Speaking at Grace Center, and he did something brilliant.
 He said, you know, before I speak, can you stretch out your hand to me?
 And we're going to pray for me.
 And he said, we're going to do this for two reasons.
 He said, one, I want you to pray and ask God to fill the person he sent to speak to
 this one, which I loved.
 And he said, the second thing is you're stretching out your hand towards me because
 we don't want to be passive listeners this morning.
 You want to reach it and you want to grab something from God.
 And I thought, that's amazing.
 Because the difference between hungry people and people who aren't hungry is
 the hungry people are looking for food.
 The other people are indifferent about whether food arrives at them.
 Right.
 Hungry people are not apathetic and they're not sort of like going through the
 motions.
 They're actually looking to get what they can right out of each experience.
 Because I realize I can be guilty of that.
 I realize that especially as a teacher, if somebody doesn't teach me in the way
 I want to be taught, I find it very difficult to feed myself.
 Right.
 And I can just kind of tune out, get bored, switch off.
 But actually my hunger level isn't dictated by somebody else's teaching level.
 Right.
 If you're hungry, you're going to find scraps wherever they may be.
 And actually, even if you go into any event, whether it's a service or
 school or whatever and just say, you know, Holy Spirit, would you help me
 mind for what you have for me today?
 Right.
 And, you know, and stay open.
 He helps you with that, even when the teaching style is something that isn't typically conducive to how you learn.
 Right.
 And the truth is you can learn something from everyone.
 Sure you can.
 Yeah.
 You know, there's a strange phenomenon that probably everybody's seen and we've probably experienced it in our own lives that we go to a conference or we go to a tree or maybe we go into a school and we experienced this mountaintop high while we're there.
 But then if we're honest, when we look back on our lives afterwards, there's a danger that we can plummet into a valley.
 One of the strangest dynamics that we've seen is that sometimes those that burn the brightest
 tend to burn out after the experience. What would you say are some of the things that you can
 implement to make sure that what you have becomes a lifestyle and wasn't just an event?
 Well, maintaining intimacy after the event, whatever that may be, whether it's a conference
 or school or whatever that you learn to feed yourself and you learn to check in with yourself
 and make sure that you're still in line with what God's asking you to do and who He's asking you to
 be. I wonder if the reason that we experience a mountaintop in the first place is because we've
 actually put a draw on the anointing of God. I forget who taught me this but it says,
 "There's only some stories I can tell at conferences that I can't tell on a Sunday morning. On a
 On a Sunday morning, it hasn't cost anybody to show up.
 Right.
 Yeah, that makes sense.
 So no faith level is activated.
 It's just like, "No, go on, entertain me, do something."
 But when you go to a conference that's cost you, I don't know, maybe a couple hundred
 dollars, you've placed a couple hundred dollars value in your expectation.
 So when you go, you're hungry.
 Right.
 And if you think about the events that we've gone to or the conferences or the schools
 that we've done, it's a big shift.
 You're like, "I'm taking time out of my work, my career.
 I've maybe paid hundreds, if not thousands of dollars.
 Now I want something, you know, so you set aside time.
 You basically prioritize God and your finances in your time.
 And as a result, you kind of get what you paid for in a sense.
 I wonder if there's a way that you can do that in normal everyday life.
 Well, again, I think you probably asked the Holy Spirit to help you stay hungry and stay open.
 But it's probably going to take more effort.
 I remember when the Holy Spirit fell in our church one Sunday morning.
 I wasn't actually there. So this is me talking about hearing it from Pastor Jeff, but Marcus
 Hendrickson, who's our director of technical services at Grace and her, just a genius in
 his own right, was speaking to Jeff, Pastor Jeff afterwards. And Jeff was wondering, "Do
 we do another service tonight?" And so he said, "Markus, what do you think? Do you think we should
 do another service tonight?" And Marcus said, "Well, I think..." And then just fell down and just began
 to weep. And Jeff was like, Oh, my gosh, when it was happened, is everything okay? And when
 they got Marcus off the floor, just I didn't hear what you said. And Marcus said, I think God's
 worth more than our inconveniences. Yeah. And that's what I mean when you when you get excited
 about what God is doing, you tend to prioritize him in a way that supersedes your inconveniences.
 So if you think back to Toronto, it's not convenient to fly to the other side of the world. You think
 about all the people who came from England or Australia or Korea or all over the world.
 They're going and they're purposing in their heart to find and to be touched by God.
 I wonder what it would be like if we woke up each day thinking, "God, I'm going to find you today.
 I'm going to have an encounter with you today. I'm going to learn something new about you."
 Right. It'd probably be a lot more fun.
 I'm excited to try that this week.
 Let's do it.
 Do you think we have to wait until tomorrow morning?
 Maybe, but that's just because it's just us awake now.
 The things we tell people to do to keep what they've got,
 as stuff that all of us can do immediately is things like cultivating a devotional life of
 worship and prayer and journaling and rest. Dick Joyce I mentioned earlier,
 who was the speaker at Grace on this morning, said something so profound. He said, "The disadvantage
 of coming to a church like Grace Center is it's entirely possible that you can come once a week
 and warm your hands on the fire of somebody else's intimacy and go away all week and not
 notice that you're in luck. And I was like, Oh my God, so good. Because it's a danger you can confuse
 anointing with momentum. Yeah. And realize that actually I'm sustaining my spiritual growth off
 of other people's test of things, other people's revelation, not my own.
 Yeah, or you can confuse time spent at church with time spent with God.
 Oh, stop it. Now you're maddling.
 Well, I went to church on Sunday and on Wednesday night. Oh,
 what do you think is one of the the death knals to growth in God and teachableness?
 Oh, for sure.
 I think sometimes we've we think we've heard it all and somehow that comes across such a dangerous
 trap isn't it it is it really is and it's what's kind of dishonoring and we how could how could
 we possibly have heard it all what did david campbells he taught the second or something about that
 he said whenever you hear something that you've heard before all gods doing is building a stronger
 wall. So he said, you know, a brick layer just puts the same type of bricks on top of the other
 bricks. And it just builds a wall, a taller wall. And so he was talking about how God lays
 precept upon precept upon precept. That's the fun thing about listening to different people teach
 the same thing. So you could listen, for example, David Wagner teach on the introduction to prophetic
 ministry, and you could listen to Gary Morgan, and you could listen to James Goll, and you could
 listen to John Paul Jackson and they might be sharing much of the same wisdom and revelation,
 but they're all going to have completely different perspectives, completely different nuggets,
 completely different insights on the same information.
 Yeah.
 And then you get to kind of build your understanding from there on the stuff that God impacts you
 with out of what they've taught.
 I speak to Gary Morgan this weekend and as Gary always does, this brilliant saying is
 the danger that you can confuse knowledge with knowing.
 And he said, "A lot of people are content
 to fill their head with knowledge,
 but it's not the same as knowing,
 you're having lived it, having an experience."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And that's a big trap.
 I thought the other trap is isolation, you know,
 withdrawing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So we see that a lot.
 Sometimes our students are, you know,
 it's a pressure cooker being at the school.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 we provide a very intentional community.
 And for whatever reason, and I get it, you know, if you're of a personality, we're like, okay, I'm all people doubt.
 I can understand the need to just rest and recharge.
 But if you don't rejoin community, an isolation can be a breeding ground for sin.
 Yeah, it's super dangerous because you're your own worst counselor.
 and when you've isolated yourself, then you pull away.
 You're the only one that is counseling you and you can end up way down the road before you realize
 that you're on the wrong road.
 One of the things I learned to do a while ago, I don't know who taught me this,
 it was the whole thing of a relationship audit. The basis was look around at the people that
 you're with and ask yourself, "Do I want to look like them?" Because if not, you might need to add
 some healthy people to your relationships.
 That's good, babe.
 Yeah, I think it was David Monner who posted on Instagram that you become the average of the five people you hang around with most.
 Which I don't know if it's true or not, but there's certainly the element, the birds of a feather flock together.
 So it's just one of the things we encourage all our students and I'd encourage all our listeners is be plugged into a local church.
 Yeah.
 Be done just to attend a local church be part of that church serve because truly you only get to keep what you give away.
 Yeah.
 And that's how you grow to, how you continue to grow.
 Think as I'm thinking about, you know, obviously having
 graduated year one and even I think how many year one students
 have we graduated to date something like 300.
 Okay.
 I just, I would, if you're listening, I'd love to encourage
 you if you've graduated year one to pray about year two, because I
 honestly think that the transformation is as significant coming
 out of year two as it is out of year one. And just even the Bible piece and understanding,
 you know, where things come from and why they're written the way they are and how do we properly
 interpret it is gold. But then add to that, it's a whole bunch of different speakers,
 it's leadership focused. And everybody I think is called to be a leader in their own arena.
 So I don't think it's ever a loss to go and learn about how to lead people well when actually
 we're called to lead in the body of Christ.
 Well, the other thing is our school isn't a ministry school per se.
 It's not training for ministry, it's training for life.
 Right.
 So we're all called to be leaders.
 I mean, primarily we lead ourselves, but we'll be leaders of our family,
 we'll be leaders of our department, our shift.
 You know, this one of the things we try and stress our students is in the Lord's
 eyes, there's no difference between the spiritual and the secular.
 Yeah.
 Once you're saved, you're in full-time ministry.
 Yep.
 But your harvest field might look like your office rather than a third world nation.
 Yeah.
 And your podium might be your lunch table speaking to your colleagues, not a church podium.
 Right.
 And so we try, especially in first and in second year, really focusing on transferable life skills that work wherever we, you know,
 teach a week on how to handle humans because shock, you're surrounded by them and they don't come with a manual.
 Yeah.
 And people are weird.
 I mean, if you think about it, the only normal person is the person you see in the mirror.
 Am I right?
 Um, sure.
 I was going to say, well, sometimes I can see more than one person in the mirror,
 depending on how many people are in the bathroom, but not the point.
 So yes, if you've done first year, we'd love to encourage you to do second year.
 And if you haven't done first year, we'd really encourage you.
 There's so many great schools that we know of tons that are,
 I'd encourage you to and research them all.
  </li><li>Yeah, and pray and just say, Lord, you know,
 here's the deal.
 You can always invite God into the process, I hope you will.
 And just ask him, Lord, would you make a way?
 Like if there's a place that touches on your heart,
 it doesn't, I'm not just talking about our school,
 any school, you know, if you're like,
 oh, I'd love to go to Bethel or I'd love to go to Toronto
 or I'd love to, you know,
 start talking to the Lord about that
 and ask him to help you make a way.
 And then take the next steps,
 talk to whoever needs to be, talk to and get their input.
 I remember when I was planning on going to Toronto.
 And so again, like I just said, if you're thinking about doing YWAM, if you're thinking
 about doing Bethel or worship you or Toronto School, the horror or any of these schools,
 they're amazing.
 It's an amazing opportunity to invest a relatively short amount of time into what God could do
 next for you.
 And you see rapid transformation in your life.
 That's what I love about these things.
 But I remember speaking to one of the elders in my church back in Scotland saying, "You know,
 I don't know. I'm not sure if this is the Lord or not." And Morag said, "Aunty, you know what,
 if it isn't, it's only five months of your life. You've just had an extended vacation in Toronto,
 come back, pick up your life where you're left off." And I thought, "That's great wisdom." So
 put in perspective. But yeah, pray about it. And then, so where you want to go, head towards that
 direction and see what sort of favor opens up for you with your boss and all that sort of stuff.
 Yeah. All right, I want to talk about donuts. Donuts.
 And coffee. And coffee. That sounds like two of my favorite things.
 We should talk about donuts and coffee. Well, here's the thing.
 We, last week, recorded our 100th episode. This is episode 101.
 And the stay of our life, busyness, gang sick, graduation.
 We didn't get to do anything to celebrate it.
 So here's what we've done. To celebrate 100 episodes,
 we want to give away $100 worth of donuts or coffee or juice
 or burgers and for those of you who are like, "Yeah, but we're not in Franklin. We can't
 visit all these places. Don't worry. We've got you can move here. Oh, I mean, you can
 move here." And in the meantime, we've got a hundred dollars worth of iTunes or Amazon
 gift cards. We'll build it however you want to be blessed. So here's what we want to do
 is we would love to hear from you about how we're doing on a podcast because actually
 we record these episodes for you guys, for our listeners. So if you would take some
 time just to tell us how we're doing, how we can serve you guys better. It would be a huge blessing
 for us. April, the month that's just passed was the highest month of listeners we've ever had.
 And we love that you tune in every week. And we really want to build a better podcast for you.
 And in order to say thank you for listening, we want to give you an opportunity to get one of
 these gift cards to be able to bless yourself, fuel yourself with the same stuff that fuels us.
 is basically if you look at our credit card statement each month.
 Yeah, you'd yeah, you would see five dollars.
 Very great.
 Honest.
 So I'm sorry, you're up frankly, just.
 Amazon and I too.
 And so we want you to live some of that.
 Oh dear.
 Here you do it.
 You go to Allen and AJ.com/survey.

 Life, communication, tacos and video games
 Paleotronuts and the kindness of God
 The things we deal with every day
 From Franklin, Tennessee
 They are just like you and me
 Alan, and AJ
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 Sharing their life, experience it
 Keeping up with the Joneses, keeping up with the Joneses
 They talk about faith in God
 And everything under the sun
 If you are a human being
 There's something here for everyone
