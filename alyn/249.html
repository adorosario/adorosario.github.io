<p> Hey everybody, you're probably used to hearing our theme tune right now and are perhaps a bit
 surprised why we're starting a little abruptly. I'll get to that in a second. First a little bit
 behind the scenes, we record these episodes anywhere between a week and two weeks before
 they're ever released, which means sometimes we release an episode and events are happening in
 the world that at the time of recording they weren't happening and probably your heart has
 has been stirred by what's been happening in Afghanistan.
 And if you're like us, you're thinking,
 yes, I'm absolutely praying for Afghanistan.
 I'm praying for God's will to be done.
 I'm praying for peace.<br/>
 I'm praying for the refugees.<br/>
 I'm praying for wisdom for our leaders.
 But if your heart has been stirred,<br/>
 like I would like to do something more,
 but I don't know what to do.<br/>
 I don't know how it would give.<br/>
 I don't even know where to give.<br/>
 I don't know who's got boots on the ground.
 It just so happened that last week<br/>
 after we released our episode,<br/>
 We got in touch with one of our friends, a former staff member at Grace Center.
 Chris and Jerry Nuss, they are Americans who live in Germany.
 And it just so happened that last week, a lot of the refugees who were being rescued from
 Afghanistan by the United States, the planes were landing in Germany.
 And almost immediately, Chris and Jerry mobilized.
 And we follow Chris on Instagram when we saw what was happening.
 Our daughters, Chris and Jerry's daughters, live here in Nashville.
 They're both good at Grace Center.<br/>
 They started mobilizing, giving people would give to them.
 They would forward it to their parents so that they could be equipped and resourced.
 And so I reached out to Chris this week saying, "Chris, how can we help?
 How can Alan and AJ help?<br/>
 We would love to get you in front of our audience."
 And so what you're going to hear now is a brief interview.
 We stopped and we chatted very early this morning for us mid-afternoon for her.
 And what you're going to hear is Chris talking a little bit about what her and Jerry are
 doing, being right there in the midst of things and how you can help too.
 Chris, now so good to see you.<br/>
 What a bizarre season and time that we're living in.
 What a joy that we've got Zoom so that we can even have this conversation.
 Can you tell our listeners who you are, how we know you, and what you're doing?
 I'm Chris and Mary to an amazing man Jerry and we are
 Part of actually the Grace Center family. We've been apart for probably the last 10 years and so
 We have been in Germany twice now<br/>
 This is our second tour our first tour was done in 2012 and then we returned back to here in Germany in
 2019 and we've been here ever since you are in a unique situation
 So you and Jerry, you are Americans, but you live in Germany, you live on the US base there.
 For people who aren't familiar with the size, the scope, the significance of the US base,
 can you just help us understand the significance of where you are in Germany?
 We live near the base, actually we're only five minutes from the base because we actually
 are not in the military.<br/>
 Jerry works for the military.<br/>
 So he works at Larmsee, which is Longstool Regional Medical Center.
 The scope of it, there's about 60,000 Americans that live in this area.
 And that is service members, department of defense, contractors.
 So Ramstein, Joint Air Force Base, which means it's Air Force and Army, is the largest European
 base here.<br/>
 And so with everything happening in Afghanistan, which I'm sure our listeners are fully aware
 of because it's international news. You know, last week or this week I've been
 watching your Instagram feed blow up. Talk to us a little bit about what you
 are doing, what you are seeing, what you're in the thick of and when I say you I
 mean Ramstein, Ramstein, Ramstein, what you're seeing on your doorstep. It
 started last Friday night when I got a phone call from and I have to be very
 careful not to mention names because of offset which we called operation
 security so people know I'm not trying to be vague. It's just protecting our
 service members here. I got a phone call from one of our really good friends who
 was on the tarmac doing assessment when the refugees were getting off the plane
 and it was pretty frantic and this person asked me this was about 11 o'clock at
 night. I need help. I need food. I need comfort toys. These children are getting
 off, they're screaming, they're terrified, they're in full-on traumatic meltdown. Some
 of them don't have shoes. It's cold. Can you help? Can you help? And so Jerry and I called
 a few of our friends that lived near us that don't live on base and said, "Hey, this is
 the emergency right now. Can we come over? Can you empty out your pantry?" So we did that.
 We got on the base and my friend, Metas there, and this person said, "These kids are getting
 off and they're rumbling through our pockets and the soldiers' pockets looking for food,
 looking for anything to drink.<br/>
 So that's when it started.<br/>
 The following day, Jerry and I, we kind of looked at each other and we said, "This is
 the beginning and this is not going to go away anytime soon.
 What can we do?"<br/>
 And so Jerry and I just said, "Listen, let's go on base to the commissary.
 Let's buy supplies as much as we can, blankets, clothing, food, whatever.
 let's just drop off, find out where we drop it off at.
 So I found, we found out where we dropped it off at,
 we came back and it was pretty amazing
 what we saw the first time and that was you see refugees,
 you know, in line, huddled, trying to stay warm,
 it was pretty a heartbreaking sight.<br/>
 We had spoken to our girls, Corey and Sarah, after that
 and they just said, "Hey, you know, I bet you there's people
 "that would like to help because at the time,
 And Jerry and I were just using her own money.
 And I said, well, I guess, and they're like, yeah, mom, let's see what we can do between
 Corey and Sarah, and then myself, just putting it on Instagram, reaching out, and people
 reaching us.<br/>
 We have raised close to $10,000 in less than a week.
 And I'm watching your Instagram post of you literally going to, I'd imagine your version
 a Walmart and buying food stuffed animals blankets supplies and and then
 watching you're saying that there's plain loads of people coming in you know
 and hundreds of people getting off the plane with nothing because they've
 fled their homeland lost their house some of the kids don't have shoes blankets
 they're barely they're getting off the plane some have like what we would call
 like a pillowcase maybe of their items I had a soldier come up to me yesterday
 and says, "Ma'am, do you have a suitcase?"
 And I'm like, "I don't, I can go get some though."
 And he goes, "I have this gentleman in there
 that he just came and it's just ratted,
 it's falling, his suitcase is just falling apart."
 Everything that comes in, it's amazing.
 Every morning I wake up and I get messages
 from Corey and Sarah, this is what we got today.
 And I'm just absolutely blown away<br/>
 by the money that comes in.<br/>
 And then I get up, take a shower, have a cup of coffee,
 get in my car, and I'm spending that money.
 And so I'm hitting every grocery store that I can.
 Today I kind of did get in trouble with the gentleman in the produce department at
 Kowflins, the German store, because he goes, "Are you the one that took all my bananas
 yesterday?" And I'm like, "Oh, I'm sorry, sir." Because you can only have two boxes today.
 And I said, he goes, "But you can order." And I went, "Oh, thank you." And so I was able to order 10
 boxes, but everything that I delivered, like for today, will be gone within the plane that arrives
 today. They couldn't even tell me how many planes are arriving, but she did say
 what is coming in today. There's not enough food that can be donated that we
 can feed them all. That tells me there's a lot coming in today because I think
 they're trying to get them out so quickly. But it's going in it and it's
 purchasing food, it's purchasing clothing. And the cool testimony about
 this whole thing, Alan, is when these checkers look at me and they look at my
 they will say, "Is this for the refugees?"
 And I said, "Well, yes it is."<br/>
 And they would say, "It is amazing what you are doing.
 You are so kind.<br/>
 You are this.<br/>
 You are that."<br/>
 And I just said, "You know, this is just what you do.
 It's humanity.<br/>
 It's just kindness and it's loving people well where they need it."
 And for them to see that, I think it's a great testimony of what we're doing.
 And I have to just say some of these stores have said, "We're going to give you an additional 20%
 20% off your whole purchase.
</p><ul>
  <li>Wow.
  </li><li>I had a lady today donate probably $100
 with a toys, a German economy, take 'em, they need 'em.
 And so, it's been amazing, the impact that it's had.
  </li><li>What's the greatest need that you have right now?
 I mean, obviously money, like money,
 but what's the greatest need of the refugees
 when they're getting off the plane?
 Like, what surprised you about what is needed
 that you might not have considered was a need?
  </li><li>Female undergardenments.
 shoes of all sizes, clothing with probably the biggest
 need is they're noticing that, you know, of course, our hearts go
 out to children, right? But there's men arriving with not
 proper clothing. So it's men's clothes. It's it's women's
 clothes. I went out yesterday and purchased hundreds and hundreds
 of dollars of fleece jackets and jackets and coats. So really,
 it's clothing, warm clothing, blankets and food.
 I saw I saw a photo of of Jerry with a shop and car filled with
 apples and I saw another shopping cart filled with stuffed animals and I was like that
 is going to be the strangest shopping list ever.
 Yeah and two were really trying to do a lot of comfort toys because they are experiencing
 the workers are saying there's a lot of trauma happening just cultural wise so yeah.
 So you know I was so moved by what you and your kids were doing on social media seeing
 this. And for all of us, I think we feel helpless going, look at this situation, of course we can
 pray, we want to give, we don't know where to give or what's going to happen to the money.
 And watching you, you guys be literally the hands and feet of Jesus, bringing
 water, bringing food, bringing comfort, bringing supplies, and the fact that we can get in on that,
 that we can resource you to go to the stores and go do that is phenomenal. Where can people who want
 to help or want to give practically like obviously I'm going to talk about how we can give to you
 but what are some of the avenues that you've seen are going to be really really helpful
 for people giving monetary gifts? The organization that I know that does a lot
 is the charity navigator.org and I'll say that again so you can put in the show notes or whatever
 One thing I do want to say is I want to encourage people,
 whether it's a dollar or a thousand dollars
 because we've had $5 amount donated,
 I had a thousand dollar amount donated.
 And in my eyes, there's no difference
 because that $5 impacts thousands and thousands and thousands
 and I'm talking thousands of lives here on the ground
 just as that a thousand dollar does.
 So the amount is not, you know, really.
  </li><li>So practically speaking, how do we give to you
 so that you can go shopping later today.
  </li><li>They can go to my PayPal or they can go to Sarah Nuss,
 my daughter, she has a Venmo,
 and she's been collecting that way.
  </li><li>So people can give electronically via PayPal or Venmo,
 we'll put links in the show notes
 to let people know how to do that.
 If people wanna follow you on Instagram
 to actually see, literally,
 boots on the ground events as they're happening,
 what's your Instagram, where can people follow you?
  </li><li>It's just Chris Nuss on Instagram,
 I'm sure you'll put in the show notes too or a link.
 And one thing I do also wanna say is,
 you know, we hear that we're pulling out August 31st, right?
 I mean, that's the goal.
 It's gonna be longer here.
 We've got pods that are being erected right now on base.
 And so even though we'll be pulled out on the 31st,
 the need is gonna be continual until further notice,
 really, we just don't know.
 So food and clothing is a huge need right now
 because they're running out.
  </li><li>Yeah, and also the difference in climates.
 You're saying that people are arriving in sandals
 and you're in the 40s and 50s in Germany, it's cold?
  </li><li>The first plane that landed the other night,
 we had one of the worst storms hit Germany
 and a friend of mine who was doing triage
 texted me and said, "Pray, pray, pray."
 We've had tents collapsed.
 I got knocked in the head.
 This person sent me video and it was flooding
 and these poor people were, they were clamoring,
 trying to get them safe.
 It's been tough.
  </li><li>Tell some stories that you're allowed to tell
 of just the beauty of God
 in the midst of tragic circumstances.
  </li><li>Probably one of my favorite stories is
 they're one of the planes landed,
 and I guess they had maybe two or three women
 give birth on the plane.
 So I believe the flight is a four hour flight,
 four hour flight coming up from Afghanistan.
 And a young gal came off, she was in full labor.
 They got her on a gurney,
 and Obie, near to some large, larmsy, met the gurney,
 and she was giving birth at that moment.
  </li><li>You're talking about the gurney being a stretcher
 off of the airplane.
 So this is the tarmac of the airport.
  </li><li>She got off, they said,
 "Halt, we've got a baby coming.
 "Like we can't go any further."
 And it was beautiful because all the Afghan women
 of that flight, surrounded that gurney and made a circle
 and held up their heat jobs for privacy.
 And they, some of the people said it was the most beautiful
 thing they ever saw because in their culture,
 it's a very private thing, right?
 And so just to honor that culture, part of them,
 and just to see these women just say,
 okay, we're gonna do this,
 and this is what it's gonna look like.
  </li><li>And literally watching life go on in the most fundamental
 sense in the midst of shock trauma is just so powerful.
 Right, right.
 So that was a pretty fun story.
 Stories of some of the volunteers just playing soccer
 with these kids, trying to get their focus on the moment
 and how to enjoy that moment of just hitting a soccer ball
 and giving them toys.
 Another thing is crayons are a huge thing.
 Every picture that they drop, boy, we're putting it on the wall, and we're going to highlight it.
 Having them get off, a lot of it is getting off the plane and meeting them and handing them a fresh blanket.
 It's important when you say plane, we're not talking a commercial jet with two, three, two rows of seating.
 You're saying these are just massive cargo planes with no seats.
 Yeah, if you think of like in the movies that you see where they have like the Humvees on there and they're just
 Piled up and that is what they're coming in on they're literally sitting on
 the bare metal frame of the airplane and they just are piling off and
 So it's you know, it's pretty it's pretty intense
 Just seeing our soldiers just stepping up and loving on these kids, you know
 Wow
 doing what they're doing.
 One thing I think is really amazing is anybody who's had a hand in this in supporting it,
 whether financially or voluntarily, I just want to encourage people that this could
 stick to be a part of their story.
 They get to own this as their story.
 I think it's a beautiful story of humanity when it comes down to it.
 I love where, and Matthew just talks about, when I was hungry, you fed me.
 When I was naked, you clothed me.
 There's something about being the hands and feet of Jesus.
 And I think it's a great picture of the body, Chris.
 I can't go see your refugee.
 You can.
 I can put money in your hands so that you can get.
 It's just beautiful.
 Every part, you know, doing its part.
 Yeah, absolutely.
 And every, and every, every item that I get, and then if Jerry's with me, we pray over
 it.
 We said, Lord, whoever touches this God, you know, would you, Holy Spirit, would you just
 ooze over it, you know?
 And then we also just pray, whoever touches it has dreams and visions of Jesus because
 we know in the Muslim culture a lot of Muslims come to the Lord because they get a visitation
 in their dreams by Jesus.
 And so I'm just like, "Oh, Lord, you know, just ooze out of all this stuff."
 So it's, it's, I'm expectant of good things.
 Well, Chris, thank you for giving us your time.
 So appreciate it.
 I know that literally it's almost statement to say that you guys are busy, but for you
 you to pause in the middle of the day to catch us up on a tangible aspect of how we can help
 is super powerful. Thank you for all you and Jerry are doing. I love your passion. It's
 beautiful seeing the Christian Jerry that I know on display and you getting to put your
 gifts into action and you know we're praying for you. We bless you in what you're doing.
 Thank you for all that you're doing.
 And I'm just going to say this would not be able or be possible if it wasn't just the generosity of just everyone abroad.
 And I mean from strangers to people you know well and just thank you, thank you.
 I can't thank you enough. And the people on the ground, we call them boots on the ground, appreciate it.
 Every time I drive up, I just, she's back. And so that's just encouraging.
 But it's not me. It's everyone who's donated has impacted thousands of lives.
 Thank you so much, Chris.
 You are so welcome.
 Thanks for listening to Chris and now back to our regularly scheduled programming.
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
  </li><li>AJ Jones. - Yes, sir.
  </li><li>Episode 249. - 249.
  </li><li>Of keeping up with the Joneses. - Yes.
  </li><li>And we always like to start with our weekly catch-up.
  </li><li>We sure do. - What a week.
 What are we?
 What are we?
 Give us a catch up on this week, why don't you?
 Is there anything outside of the trauma that we should say first or should we like, if
 we can think of something nice to say?
 I've got some fun stuff.
 You do the trauma.
 Quick trauma notice, if the description of medical procedures or accidents are going to
 trigger you, just hit that chat or skip button and we'll move on.
 And you want to miss the update.
 Yeah.
 So basically Sunday the short version is Tia and Abby and some girls from church were running around and
 Tia ended up getting her finger closed in the hinge of a metal door. Was it the hinge side? That's what she said
 So
 screaming ensued and
 You know I you were already with Tia by the time Abby found me and she's like come Tia's hurt her finger
 And I'm like okay, you know and Tia can have big reactions. So I was thinking yeah, there's no problem. So like you know
 Oh anyway, we I come around the corner and all the first thing that I can all I can see is all the blood
 That's all I can see and then you're like don't look don't look I'm like it's too late. I looked I mean it was
  </li><li>You know when you're in shock
 and you don't quite remember things properly.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So fast, are you okay if I just fast forward to today
 or do you wanna keep on chronologically?
  </li><li>So yes, so you like wrapped some gauze
 around this heavily bleeding digit
 that was angled in the wrong direction.
 So we know something's definitely broken.
  </li><li>Oh it's her pinky.
  </li><li>And the nail is off and it was,
 Anyway, why are we talking about this?
 So load was funny because we liked each other and went,
 okay, how are we going to do this?
 Like is, and we were just like, we're doing this together.
 Like, you know, as opposed to, it's not just one of us taking Tia.
 I think normally when trauma happens or crisis happens,
 I'm okay in that moment, except when I was my kids.
 Like I literally had brain fog.
 I remember I'm looking, sweet Kate has opened up the first aid kit
 and I'm looking at the first aid kit
 and nothing in my brain is processing.
 Like it's a wall of everything I need
 and my brain can't process anything that I need.
  </li><li>Well, and it needs to be said,
 Tia is screaming her head off,
 which with good reason.
  </li><li>It also needs to be said that the end of her finger
 is hanging off.
  </li><li>Yeah, any adult would be screaming their head off.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But she's like--
  </li><li>But we get in the car and we can't think.
  </li><li>And she screams the whole time.
 I can't, I'm just like, I am just driving,
 just tell me where to go.
  </li><li>I hear I look up on a map and I've looked up on a map.
 And also I know where the origin care is.
 I know, I can't even think.
 I can't think of how you're there.
 And I pull up, you know, the map and I don't know where the map is showing that I am to
 know where everything else is.
 Like it's, I was like, oh, this is a trauma response.
 Like I can't process those busy information.
 Neither one of us.
 We're just like, and then, you know, now you're in a small vehicle with a child that's
 screaming and we're saying, you know, Tia, it's fine.
 You're allowed to scream.
 You're like, you know, but she's just like in agony.
 So we take her to the, the, well, I said, should we take her to the hospital?
 and you were like, no, COVID, blah, blah,
 let's take her to the walking clinic.
 We got to the walking clinic.
  </li><li>Well, the reason I'm saying that is Vanderbilt
 had just announced the day before
 that they have no ICU beds at all.
  </li><li>Right, right, right.
  </li><li>ICU, is that what it's called?
  </li><li>Yeah, but shit, I mean, you wouldn't be an ICU
 for a second, but you're not saying this.
  </li><li>My brain's confused, ER with ICU,
 because they're all like--
  </li><li>Oh, is that what happened?
 'Cause I was like, okay.
  </li><li>Okay, okay.
  </li><li>Okay, my brain.
  </li><li>Sorry, okay. - And also we had friends
 who went to the doctors and they couldn't get seen
 because of so many COVID patients.
 I was like, I don't want to drive all the way there
 and then not be able to be seen.
 So we picked the biggest kind of urgent care.
  </li><li>Like a Vanderbilt walking clinic.
  </li><li>Yeah, so we get there.
  </li><li>And we get there and you know, Tia comes inside
 and of course she's still screaming.
 And so everybody that's like waiting around
 is looking at this poor, beautiful, big, proud guy.
  </li><li>Everybody except the person that's checking
 and the other guy who I'm I overheard them just say,
 yeah, I just need a doctor to know to get off work.
 And I'm like, could you go after the screaming child?
 where the blood is falling out of her head?
  </li><li>Just, could you move?
 Maybe you could you move?
  </li><li>And you couldn't miss the blood.
 I mean, it was soaking through everything.
 Oh no, it was just, anyway,
 all of a sudden these two nurses come out of the back
 and they're like, can you just tell us what this is?
 And we'll tell you if we can even help you.
 And they're like, is the skin broken?
 While they're looking at this,
 and we're like, oh yeah, the end of the fingers
 kind of hanging off, they're like,
 take her right now to Vanderbilt Children's at Williamson County
 to the emergency.
  </li><li>They have a pediatric emergency,
 which somehow we missed even though it's right around the car.
  </li><li>Right, I didn't realize it was there.
 And so we drove there and Tia got out of the car.
 She's still screaming this whole time, by the way.
 So we're at like, gotta be at it,
 50 minutes of screaming.
 You know, I mean, that's the worst part, if you ask me.
 So we get out of the thing and this lady comes right out,
 you know, in response to her screaming,
 she'll, do you need a wheelchair or anything?
 No, it's our hand, great.
 And they just like basically walked us past everything.
 Like we'll get all your information later.
  </li><li>We'll get all your paperwork later.
 Let's just get that poor sweet screaming in pain child.
 And they put her in this room,
 all of a sudden there's four women in there.
 They're all super sweet and they ended up--
  </li><li>I mean, the first thing they did was numb the finger.
  </li><li>They froze her finger, which also hurt like the dickens.
 So now she's screaming even louder, but then it froze.
  </li><li>Yes, was it a couple of minutes?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>She stopped screaming.
  </li><li>Yes, and then daddy became like a glorified iPad stand
 holding the iPad so she could watch.
  </li><li>Well, we were Disney plussing the whole way from church.
 I'm like, let's watch Disney Plus.
  </li><li>Which made the screaming slightly less in volume,
 but not much.
 So that was pretty horrific.
 We were there for about two hours.
  </li><li>That was pretty quick for an ER visit.
  </li><li>It was, they saw us very quickly, but we had to wait.
 It was long enough that they had to re-freeze the finger
 before they did stuff to it because of the freezing
 had already.
  </li><li>They took an x-rays and the attending physician
 was wonderful.
 She was just like, okay, I'm gonna do x-rays.
 Here's the thing I'm concerned about is, yes,
 is clearly broken in one place.
 I have a suspicion it's broken in another place
 and where it's broken is a growth plate
 and that's not a good place for it to be broken.
 So let me send the X-rays to the person who's on call
 who just so has to be a hand specialist.
  </li><li>Yeah, or a spied hand specialist.
  </li><li>So she sent the X-rays and took also a photograph
 of the finger, which not to be gross,
 but the end of her finger was a kind of almost right angle.
  </li><li>And then kind of busted like a grape.
 I mean, it was gross.
  </li><li>Oh, I was so gross.
  </li><li>So gross.
  </li><li>Is there any you are still listening to this part?
 Like you're bold. - Both trying to like
 be calm and show her faces where we're in.
  </li><li>Oh, I can't call you.
  </li><li>I can't call you to just not lose my mind.
  </li><li>But I did take photos 'cause I thought later on
 I'm gonna want to look at it.
  </li><li>Okay. - I haven't yet.
  </li><li>You know what?
 You don't have to send me those photos.
 I've seen it enough in real life.
 So anyway, that's fine.
 They refreeze the finger, they stitch it all up.
  </li><li>No, they clean it out.
  </li><li>I mean, that took forever.
 Then they couldn't get the bleeding to stop,
 so they had to use something rather to get to stop
 and that didn't work,
 and then they used something rather else to get to stop.
 Then they put some sort of gel on it,
 stop it from bleeding.
 Then they stitched the whole thing up
 and they couldn't get the nail to go back on the bed.
  </li><li>So they just threw out.
  </li><li>So they just threw out.
  </li><li>The whole nail just dropped.
  </li><li>And put some sort of bass lean covered something
 so that it wouldn't stick to something rather else.
  </li><li>You remember in a lot of details.
  </li><li>Yeah, and then they like wrap it up, you know,
 with the finger next to it, and they're like, you know,
 here's some antibiotics, and we're gonna go see
 the specialist on Wednesday, so great.
 So somehow I end up, oh, 'cause Tia picked me,
 I end up doing the doctor's visit of trying to get
 this thing off of her finger, well--
  </li><li>Wait, hang on, you skipped a bit, so that's Sunday.
 Monday, Tuesday, she goes to school, it's normal.
  </li><li>Yes, it's great.
  </li><li>Wednesday, you go see a specialist.
  </li><li>Wednesday, we go see the specialist, we get in there,
 and they're trying to get this bandage off.
 And I guess it had kept bleeding so much.
 And then there was also this gel stuff,
 which is supposed to make the blood coagulate.
 Anyway, it made it like a cement thing on her finger.
 And so it took them 45 minutes of soaking the thing
 and then snip, snip, pull a little bit.
 She go, oh, oh, oh.
  </li><li>'Cause it's all attached to raw skin.
  </li><li>Yeah, there's nothing, it's all like, oh.
 And I'm just trying to distract her with a baking show.
 Look, look over here at the baking show.
 Don't look over there.
 Who's your god?
 Anyway, so this specialist comes in
 and basically he's like, well, you know what?
 You know, it looks pretty good.
 All right, well, probably what we'll do
 is we're just gonna splint it.
 And then he sits and he looks at me for a minute
 and then he goes, you know,
 I just wanna X-ray to just check one more thing
 before we do that.
 And otherwise, you know, we're just gonna splint it
 and we'll make this special little finger cast
 and blow a button.
 Great, sounds great.
 And then he comes back after the X-ray and he's like,
 you need surgery.
 So--
 Because the growth plate was impacted.
 It's broken through the growth plate.
 And so basically there's a piece of bone
 that-- and they're both short pieces of bone
 before the growth plate.
 And then the knuckle comes right after that.
 And so he's like, I'm going to pin all of those things
 together, the two pieces of bone, the growth plate,
 and then knuckle.
  </li><li>But no, but this is my favorite part.
 And by favorite, I mean the grossest part.
  </li><li>And the pin's gonna be.
  </li><li>No, no, not even that, but confirm my suspicions.
 'Cause you know, when you first look at it
 and you think, oh my gosh, your finger was hanging off.
 And then you're like, was I just overreacting?
 Was it really hanging off?
 Well, that's what he said.
 He said, yeah, there was no bone keeping.
 The only thing that was keeping attached was the flap,
 you know, one side busted out like a crepe.
  </li><li>The flap of skin on the one side.
  </li><li>And the other, to just fell off.
 He said, I just put that back up,
 really I didn't imagine it really was just hanging off laughing in the way.
 Yeah. And so anyway, so he's just like, I just want to put a pin in it and make sure that there's
 nothing between in the break between the go, you know, the plate or like, okay. So then when he
 he's like, I should do that tomorrow. So today we take Tia in for this morning, this morning.
 And I mean, they're amazing.
 Oh, Vanderbilt, Bravo, joint and bone and joint Institute.
 Yeah, I mean, amazing.
 And the the doctor we had was lovely, like everybody was amazing.
 Basically, he comes out after he's done the surgery and was like, actually,
 I had to go a little bit further and I had to do, you know, to peel back.
 And we're like, we're good.
 You do you a little less detail, be good.
 But he's like, I think I've fixed it well enough that the nail should grow in properly.
 And but she's going to have this pin with a ball on the end of it,
 woosh, sticking out the end of her finger that is pinning her the two short pieces
 and the growth plate and the knuckle.
 I can't wait to look at the stats to see how many of you actually listen to this chat.
 Can you tell?
 Because I don't think I would listen.
 No, I would have skipped by now.
 Anyway, so they right now she's upstairs watching TV. I have fed her a stream of anything she
 wants to eat and she's they froze her hand. They said she won't feel anything for the
 whole day and then they have some pretty extensive painkillers for her for tomorrow and the
 next day.
 The thing I was not looking forward to, I don't have much experience with surgery. I
 I mean, I've watched you have two.
 I've watched MJ have one now that there's Tia.
 The thing I don't like about is when they wake up,
 especially from a general.
 'Cause the one time with MJ,
 he didn't know where he was, didn't know who we were.
 He was like climbing.
 He climbed on me like a spider monkey.
 Did he even just use terrified?
 And so I was just thinking, you know,
 like we were praying about that this morning.
 And, but Tia was fine.
 Well, when I came in, she was shaking really violently.
 Like shivering.
 Yes, because that's what you do when you come.
 I mean, that's pretty normal.
 So they wrapped her up in all these blankets,
 but she was still shivering.
 Well, I mean, within half an hour,
 she's giving us much sass as she always said.
 She was sassing us pretty good, yeah.
 And she's just saying, can we go for lunch?
 And I'm like, honey, you haven't eaten anything.
 You just had surgery.
 You'd be under general yesterday.
 Let's just let your stomach settle.
 And then maybe we'll go out.
 Yeah, she's back to ruling the roost from our master bedroom.
 So how are you doing?
 'Cause that's been quite the journey from Sunday to Thursday.
  </li><li>Oh, you know, actually it's been so rough.
  </li><li>Well, you were gonna be going away today.
  </li><li>I was supposed to be going on retreat,
 but we had some people from our team
 either come down with COVID or have to get testing
 because of living with people that just got COVID.
 So we had to cancel a retreat.
  </li><li>Post-pone.
  </li><li>Post-pone, yes.
 I'm so thankful because--
  </li><li>I'm more thankful.
  </li><li>Well, I wouldn't have been able to leave.
 I would have had to just say,
 y'all drive and I'll somehow catch up because
  </li><li>'Cause I have issues.
 You wouldn't, you would stay home
 and your team would run it.
  </li><li>Well that's true, yes.
  </li><li>For the fact that you were like,
 I could just do the surgery and catch up with you later.
  </li><li>Oh no, like I meant a day from now or two days from now.
 I don't mean, yeah, I don't mean I'll drive fast
 and catch up, that's not what I meant.
 Yeah, so I was, as much as I was so bummed
 on Monday and Tuesday when we're like,
 okay, we have to postpone this retreat.
 I'm so thankful because that would have been awful.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So.
  </li><li>I've had my fill of surgery waiting rooms.
 Thank you very much.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm pretty done with hospitals actually
 for this year. - For this year.
  </li><li>Yeah, we're three for three on ER visits.
  </li><li>Dang, right?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But we're gonna hit that sweet deductible limit
 any minute now.
  </li><li>Then we're in the clear.
  </li><li>All the elective surgeries I can between now and disabled.
  </li><li>That's what I was thinking.
 I was like, okay, what kind of things do I actually
 need to get sorted. Yeah. Oh, bless you, baby. Dude, I just, you know, I'm
 literally like, okay, we're gonna record the podcast. We're gonna have dinner.
 And then I'm going to collapse. I'm probably gonna just go somewhere and cry.
 You know, I'm just like, don't blame me baby. But anyway, yeah, don't blame you.
 Oh, look, I'm starting to cry. You're allowed to cry. Do you want to take a
 minute to cry? No, it's fine. It was just a rough week. Really was. Do you want
 some happy news. Yeah, what's your happy news? Well, do you actually remember that the kids
 started back school? Like, that was like last week, they went back to school. They did the
 first school week of school. We after five years of living in this house, finally got
 around to putting up some photos. We did. And some paintings. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the
 kids were like, why is it taking you for five years? I'm like, I don't know stuff like,
 life gets in the way.
  </li><li>But we're so happy they're at, aren't we?
 And our chair finally arrived,
 the one we paid for in February.
  </li><li>We, March, I think it was.
  </li><li>Was it?
  </li><li>Yeah, we bought, we bought--
  </li><li>I thought it was supposed to be delivered in March
 and we bought it in February.
  </li><li>I don't know, sometime a long time ago,
 and we got, obviously far, far away.
 We bought sofa, a love seat and a chair.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And because we're all back ordered and COVID shipping
 and all that sort of stuff,
 they all arrived in stages.
  </li><li>Well, yes, but this is the third chair, right?
  </li><li>Well, yeah, we got the two sofas,
 And then we just like said, we don't like too so far.
 So we only want one of them sent back one of the stuff
 is the sentence, the love seat.
 Yeah.
 And then the love seat was back ordered.
 Meanwhile, the chair arrived, but it was broken.
 So we sent that back and then they sent us another chair
 a couple of later.
 There was stained.
 There was stained.
 So we sent that back.
 And now in what are we August?
 Yes.
 We finally have a whole together.
 Yeah.
 And then, you know, we put our paintings up.
 I thought that was fun, like, hard.
 Although at one point it wasn't fun and like hard
 I want to burn down the house.
 It's true.
 You were like, I'm not joking.
 The thing is if it's a millimeter different
 in height from the one next to it, I'd be surprised.
 I mean, it's like you're not gonna look at it and notice it.
  </li><li>Except I looked at it and noticed it.
  </li><li>Okay, I'm just saying, when you looked at it today,
 did you think, man, that millimeter is killing me?
  </li><li>No, it's acclimated to it.
  </li><li>No, that's not what it is,
 'cause you wouldn't acclimate to it.
 I know you.
 So anyway, it's like, if there's a difference,
 which you can't tell 'cause they're quite far apart,
 then it's like maybe a millimeter.
 And he was like, that's it.
 Let's burn down the house.
 I can't take it.
 They're not.
 And I'm just like, oh my gosh.
 So I'm like, baby, I want eventually we'll paint this room.
  </li><li>I'm set up for failure.
 'Cause here's why, right?
 It's hang up three identical photos in frames,
 except they're not identical
 because the frames are not identical, you know?
  </li><li>There.
 I measured them.
 Some are 17 and a half, some are 17 and three quarters.
 Some are like 17 and a quarter and a half, you know?
 So they're not identical.
 So then I'm trying to do the math on the wall.
 So it's already set up to trigger me
 'cause it requires math, which I have difficulty doing.
  </li><li>I wanna just say that they are the same,
 I bought all three from the same.
  </li><li>But the quality control is such that the tolerances
 between each of the three frames are not exact.
  </li><li>Yes, there's a, yes.
  </li><li>So now I'm trying to do mental arithmetic.
 Like what's the width of the wall, split that in half,
 the center one goes in there, then there's the distances.
 And then I've learned from history
 that just because it's mathematically accurate,
 it doesn't mean it's necessarily pleasing to the eye,
 which you're not gonna know till they're up there.
 Then you gotta make sure there's not studs behind the wall
 because I'm using these certain wall hooks.
 Then I'm putting them in and the way it is,
 how are you gonna measure from the top of the ceiling?
 'Cause what we've also learned is ceilings
 are not always level.
 Like so already I'm like stressed.
 And then I'm having to use basic tools.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 curious to me that in some aspects of my life, I have a huge bandwidth to manage stress and
 in other areas of my life, like I don't know, hanging up photographs.
 And anything really around the house.
 Yes. Usually it's better if I'm doing things with power tools.
 Do you mean power tools? This is a hammer.
 Well, yes. Any kind of tool.
 Yeah. So anyway, they're up. But most importantly, the thing we need to celebrate
 about is I 100% had Skyward Sword HD this week.
 -Yes, we said-- -From when MJ wiped out my file,
 I started again and I successfully 100%
 a couple of years ago.
 -Yeah. -And the last two--
 -The World Rejoices.
 -The World Rejoices.
 So thank you, you can send cards, flowers, accolades,
 wreaths, you know, be perfect.
 -It didn't take quite the same amount of time
 as doing Zelda Breath of the Wild.
 No, like the things you have to do to 100% Skyward Sword are really limited.
 Like you have to collect, for example, I think 24 heart pieces.
 Yes. 24 heart pieces and 27 cubes.
 In Breath of Wadd, you have to find 900 corox seeds and 120 shrines.
 Like so different.
 Like a hundred and something quests as well.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 So no, not sure.
 Like, yes, yes, yes, yes.
 I've thoroughly enjoyed it.
 And now I've replayed it this time in hero mode.
 That's what you're doing right now.
 But I got the amiibo for it.
 The hard to find price gouged amiibo that was going for $175,
 which I found not much over market price.
 But let's not discuss how much.
 Let's move on.
 Anything else on our weekly update to do to say?
 No, we're done.
 You crack me up.
 I got storage containers.
 Yep.
 Super excited about that.
 I love storage containers.
 I love organization. So I'm excited. I'm going to have some good time off storage.
 You're going to detox all of your stress and anxiety from this week in storage, aren't you?
 I am. I'm literally like, I need a task or something to do to just get out all of the
 stress from this week. So that's how I'm going to do it. Storage containers.
 I look forward to the fruit of your labor.
 Yes.
 All right, our main topic for this week is all about favor.
 It is.
 And I was shocked to learn that despite the fact in the last couple of weeks, last, I
 don't know, 10 or so episodes, we've talked a little bit about favor fitting to the kindness
 of God or favor with relationships.
 We haven't really talked about favor as an episode and since episode 56.
 Wow.
 So I was like many years ago.
 But the reason I've been thinking about it a lot recently is I've been reading Nehemiah.
 or Nehemiah. Nehemiah. And there's a lot in Nehemiah all about favor. And you know,
 I've obviously read Nehemiah before, but they never stood out. And in the first couple of chapters,
 he's talking about accessing favor, using favor. And I was like that. I mean, there's some real
 keys in here that I thought would be fun to talk about. Yeah. Incidentally, I've also been
 reading Nehemiah. You've been listening to Nehemiah. Listening. Yes. Yeah. Did the
 favor stuff stand out for you too? Yes. A whole bunch of stuff has said to me that I
 haven't noticed before. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, the funny thing about favor, and we
 talked a little bit about this in the concept of, you know, when we talk about the kindness
 of God a few episodes ago, is the misconception that when we talk about favor, somehow we're
 talking about living a life that's excused from any troubles or difficulties.
 Right. Like, oh, you have favor, you've hit the jackpot, everything's going to be like,
 that's how you know you have favor is that you don't have any any problems ever.
 You win a lottery, you get free Ferraris, right. You can eat as much chocolate as you want,
 you never put on weight, you know, every love to favor. I'm like, no, like a biblical definition
 of favor. When you look at the Bible and the characters in the Bible who are recorded as having
 favor on their life, their lives were not marked by an absence of difficult things,
 right?
 Or trauma.
 Yeah.
 Classic example would be Joseph.
 Yes.
 So, you know, Joseph is coat of many colors.
 We all know that story, highly favored by his father.
 Yes.
 Beginning of his life, huge amounts of favor.
 End of his life.
 Second most powerful person in all of Egypt next to Pharaoh.
 Yes.
 Huge ruler.
 Huge.
 End with tremendous favor.
 Yes.
 Between the beginning of his life and the end of his life, the whole thing is about being
 kidnapped and abused about being cheated on and sold in a slavery and beaten up
 except I would argue even in the midst of those circumstances favor followed him
 because favor followed him at Potiphar's house and at the prison and that's so
 important to know that even even the difficult seasons of his life weren't
 marked by an absence of favor favor was in the midst of that right it's just
 important to understand right the outset that favor isn't about us never
 experiencing tough times. Right. Favour. I mean, if that's, we're spending a lot of time
 talking about what favour isn't. And I think that's important before we start our journey
 or otherwise we're thinking about a different thing. So that's what a favour isn't. How
 would you describe what favour is? How would you describe what a favour is? I feel like
 you have like a definition. Of course I have a definition. I've studied it for years.
 But I'm just thinking like, let's shoot the breeze for a second. Like, talk to me what
 you think favors because it's clearly, I mean, you were tracking on something with Joseph.
 I think it is consistent regardless of circumstances.
 I think it is something that you don't earn, but I think something that you could lose,
 but you would lose it based on character, not based on circumstances.
 because Joseph's circumstance is sucked,
 and even in the suckiest of circumstances,
 it still records him as having favor.
  </li><li>Right, and not even complaining
 and still turning to the Lord, and so yes.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause twice, I'm thinking about
 when he's thrown into prison.
 It talks about God gave the prison warden,
 it gave Joseph favor in the eyes of the prison warden.
  </li><li>Yeah, maybe.
  </li><li>And the other time when he was sold in the slavery
 and potter for sex. - Before that, yeah.
  </li><li>And he found favor.
 So even though he's a slave, his slave master has,
 you know, finds his favor.
 They're finding favor because they're impressed with him.
 So when you think about Joseph, like,
 so the first one is he's, of course, sold into slavery,
 but he must have been impressive.
 Even though he's in these horrible circumstances,
 it's totally unfair.
 He shouldn't be a slave.
 He's a beloved son.
 You know, he's not innocent.
 He's innocent.
 He's not in his own country anymore.
 Like he had every right to pitch a fit and you know.
 was very southern of you.
 Pitch a fat.
 Pitch a fat.
 But he ends up in Potiphar's favor.
 That's got to be because of how he's walking out this
 ridiculously hard circumstance.
 And so again, he gets raised up inside of Potiphar's household,
 then right back into the cycle, he's falsely accused and it all looks bad again.
 He's back.
 He's sent to prison and then he ends up in favor in prison again and helping
 to run the prison, right?
 So you just think that tells you a lot about how he was
 walking out circumstances, regardless of whether it looked
 like he had any favor anymore.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It also tells you that your favor is transferable
 from season to season.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because the favor stayed with him.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>I think one of the difficult,
 one of the difficult is when you start talking about favor,
 that misconception that means favor is,
 everything's gonna be great and fairy trees
 and Chris's presence and just awesomeness.
  </li><li>Fairy trees.
 I don't know what fairy tree is.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>It sounds like something you would think
 by a company with a favor.
 That's one thing. - Uniquients.
  </li><li>Well, the other thing as soon as you start talking
 about favor or you start talking about favor on your life
 or testimonies or stories, which by the way,
 Bible encourages you to do, we'll get that in a second.
 Usually what I've noticed in the hearers,
 as you're telling us stories,
 is it brings up this internal divide between those
 who have favor, those who don't have favor.
 And I think that's like a tragedy
 because we as believers in the New Testament
 have favor because of our position in Christ.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Everybody has favor.
 So under a new covenant,
 there isn't a notion that some people have favor
 and some people don't have favor.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And I think that right there
 is one of the most important starting points
 for us to access the favor that's on our life.
  </li><li>I wonder though, if, I like that you said access,
 I wonder if it's just like healing and many other things.
 It's about whether you're actually appropriating
 that you have favor or not.
 You mean the provisions there
 but whether you're walking in it.
 Right, if you're like,
 because I'm just thinking we can choose to walk as,
 I'm a victim, nobody ever sees me, I'm a shadow.
 And know that person isn't walking in favor,
 even though they're saved and it's available to them.
 They're choosing to identify with,
 with being a victim or whatever the thing is,
 rather than choosing to appropriate,
 I actually have favor, I have access to favor.
  </li><li>I'm gonna back off the choosing.
 I fully agree with everything that you're saying.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>But I think about my own life,
 I didn't know there was another choice available.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So you know I've talked about before,
 you know, like Isaiah 61, Greg McSward, blah blah blah blah.
 I would have just pushed back to say,
 "Well, I'm not choosing anything."
 I just didn't even know it was available.
  </li><li>Can we say unwittingly choosing?
  </li><li>Yeah, like unaware that it seems
 an option to live in.
 And that's, you know, my people perish for lack of vision,
 like just not understanding what's been purchased for you in Christ.
 So favor doesn't mean you're excused from difficulties.
 Right.
 There's no concept under a new covenant of people who have or don't have favor.
 And yeah, as you rightly point out, it does seem like some people are more
 favored than other people.
 Yes.
 Which we know isn't true, but we can see the fruit of.
 And so why is that?
 I think it's because Scripture clearly teaches us that we can grow in favor.
 So you think about Samuel, you think about Jesus.
 Both of those men are recorded off in Scripture that they grew in stature and
 in wisdom and in favor with both God and man.
 So that's crazy.
 How could Jesus grow in more favor with God?
 I don't know.
 No, but you can.
 And it's probably like, you grow in wisdom, you grow in maturity.
 You grow in your skills.
 Like I'm a better teacher today than I was 20 years ago.
 You know, like I remember the class example.
 I remember wanting to learn a swim.
 Don't laugh.
 And of course, as a British person, I was severely, you know, handicap,
 just because of my pedic, but I remember going to the university
 as I had a swimming pool and I remember going each lunch time.
 I thought, I'm just going to swim every day.
 I couldn't swim a length.
 No, that comes as a huge shock to you.
 Yeah, I'm surprised.
 So I would time it.
 when all the swimmers were swimming lengths and they were down at the deep end, I would swim a
 breath across the shallow end, right? I would just go back and back again, out of their way.
 And thinking this is embarrassing, this is horrible. I don't understand how me doing the same thing
 that clearly I'm not doing very well is going to get me better, but within a couple of months I
 could start swimming across the pool and I could start swimming length. My point is I grew in my
 skill by doing something. You are horrible for me. And that right
 there was a judgment of God, even though I don't believe in
 that. What is about that example is particularly amusing to
 your, your laugh, to go across with wise instead of length wise,
 never, why would never make it on a length. But so they didn't
 have ropes up between the lanes or anything? Well, I guess it's
 Scotland.
 It's all my Scottish years.
 You'll forgive my my wife.
 I was joking.
 I heard judgment.
 No, but seriously.
 Did they not have ropes?
 No.
 Everybody was in lane swimming backwards and forwards.
 I would just time it and swim across and then pause.
 Catch my breath and swim back again.
 My boy was OK.
 We could all swim in the pool somewhere better than others.
 And I grew in my swimming ability.
 Yes, I like that.
 Really bad example.
 My point is we all have favor.
 Some of us are learning to paddle in the shallow end of our favor.
 Other people have learned how to cooperate with favor.
 But you talked about a stewardship I talk about is growing in favor.
 It's good.
 Can I read your verse from Nehemiah?
 You may.
 All right.
 Let me, let me pull up my Bible.
 Hold on.
 So Nehemiah, Nehemiah one says this.
 Um, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 Well, hang on.
 Before I get to that, we've talked about what favor isn't.
 Let me talk about what favor is.
 You had a good example.
 The way I thought about it was,
 favor is all about divine outcome,
 irrespective of circumstances.
 It's the hand of God moving on your behalf
 to accomplish God's purposes.
 It's like this divine acceleration
 that comes on your life against all odds.
 It makes the impossible possible.
 It reduces friction.
 I like to say that favor is a gift that God gives to others on your behalf.
 We'll unpack that a little bit more as we look at these.
 But I think probably the easiest way to describe is what the world calls luck
 is actually often the favor of God on your life.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 There you go.
 We're so we're talking about we're talking about growing in God growing in favor of a bigger part.
 So here's Nehemiah 1 1 right at the start of Nehemiah.
 N'amiah gets this report about what's happening in the city Jerusalem.
 He's in a foreign land, he's serving a pagan king.
 And he's so heartbroken that he's moved to actually go help the plight of his people.
 And so it says this, "Namiah 1-11, please grant me," this is the prayer that he prays to the Lord,
 "please grant me success today by making the king favorable to me.
 put it into his heart to be kind to me.
 Like if that's not a bare bones definition of favorite work
 and him, you know, I think today would be like,
 oh my gosh, is he just asking God to manipulate the king?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>To give him, you know, favorable outcomes?
 I don't think he's, he's just asking the Lord,
 Lord, you put this word on my heart.
 Would you grant me favor?
 But he breaks down what the favor would look like.
 It would be success.
 It would be that the king would be favorable to me
 that he would be kind to me.
 And I think what's beautiful about this is
 N'amaya is literally taking his favor out for a spin.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>He's like saying, "Okay, well,
 "I'm in this covenant relationship with God.
 "I'm gonna see what's waiting for me on the side."
 So in this story, N'amaya is the cup bearer to the king
 and he's kind of going out on a limb here.
 He's heard about like Jerusalem, like I said,
 and but what he goes to ask for is kind of extravagant
 because he's so grieved, he's grieved, he's saddened.
 And it's not like he's just going, the king going,
 can I have unpaid leave from work?
 I just got some bad news from home.
 Look at what he asks for.
 He goes to his boss, who's not a Jew,
 and just basically says, hey, can you let me take
 some time off work, that's the big thing.
 But also, could you write me some letters
 so that I can trade on your name
 so that I can have safe conduct.
 Oh, and also, can I take some of the timber
 from your Royal Park to help with my building project?
 And also, could I have some of your army officers
 and could they accompany me?
 Like these huge excessive requests,
 and amazingly, like the king says yes.
 Now, put it in today's perspective.
 Imagine you work for a boss
 who is not sympathetic to you being a Christian,
 and you wanna go do some long-term missions work,
 and you don't only say,
 "Hey, could I take six months a year off work?"
 But could you also pay me for that?
 And also could you fund my trip?
 And also could I use the corporate credit card
 to fund all the expenses while I'm there?
  </li><li>That's essentially what he's saying, yeah.
  </li><li>It's outrageous, but look at his prayer.
 Going back to his prayer,
 please grant me success today
 by making the king favorable to me.
 Put it into his heart to be kind to me.
 And that's where I get that line from,
 like favor is a gift from God that he gives to others for our behalf.
 Yes.
 He's saying, God, would you make the king favorably disposed toward me so that I can
 accomplish what you've put in my heart?
 Yes.
 It's just this, like favor is not to better our life.
 That's a side effect of it.
 It's to further the work of the kingdom with grace, with ease, and so that everybody in
 our community is blessed.
 Yeah.
 But I have a thought for you.
 you also think though that it was really easy for God to answer that request because the thing that
 was on Nehemiah's heart was on God's heart. Yes, I do. You know, Nehemiah wants to rebuild the wall,
 right? So he wants the restoration of Jerusalem and that's God's heart as well. I remember you say
 that. I remember once listened to an interview with Bono from YouTube and you remember he was
 doing the drop the debt 2000, you know, the year of Jubilee. Okay. And so somebody once asked him,
 like, how is it that you have the gall to go to government leaders,
 you know, leaders of nations and ask them to cancel the debt?
 Like, is it not uncomfortable for you?
 Is this kind of scruffy rock star to go in and basically petition
 kings and leaders and say, hey, would you cancel the debt?
 And he said, yeah, you would think it would be.
 He said, but I've got a secret weapon.
 He said, I've got God on my shoulder.
 And he said, and his heart is for the poor.
 Yeah.
 You know, he was like, I'm just going to go make an earth request for what is a divine heartbeat.
 Right.
 I was like, I love it.
 Beautiful. Yeah.
 So favor is a gift that God gives to others for your benefit.
 How do you grow in your favor? You start asking for it. Like Nehemiah didn't just assume he had it.
 He asked for it. And the way you grow in it is your requests get bigger, which sounds easy.
 No, because your faith gets bigger.
 Your obedience gets bigger as you step out to walk in your favor.
 Yeah.
 Any thoughts on that?
 No, I think that's great.
 Yeah, I've got another prayer for you.
 This is long being one of my favorite Psalms.
 OK, it's called the prayer of Moses, but it's found in the Psalms.
 That's interesting.
 Yeah, Psalm 90 verse 17 says this, "May the favor of the Lord our God rest upon us,
 establish the work of our hands for us.
 I pray that prayer all of the time.
 It's probably been the most consistent prayer
 that I have prayed in my entire life.
 Establish the work of my hands for me and grant me favor.
 Like I pray that all the time.
 Lord, basically, would your favor rest upon my work?
 I always thought it was cheating when I'd read about Daniel.
 And the Lord gave to Daniel, understanding wisdom of all kinds of literature.
 I remember studying for my finals in university.
 Lord, I would love some of that, that Daniel anointing.
 But it's something I've asked, like I've always asked for favor to be on my work.
 And I think part of the reason I love to work so much and I love to work hard
 is because there's a racism and nointing, there's an ease, there's a passion.
 And I love it. I love work.
  </li><li>Yes. - Except hanging out picture frames.
 But I do. I love my job.
 And in the jobs that I've had, I have found favor as I have worked.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Thoughts about that, Darn?
 Because you've had favor on your work as well.
 Yeah, I was thinking about that. I was like, I can only think of one job that I have had since I
 started working and I started working at 13 that I haven't had favor and promotions.
 Like, I was thinking about it today when you were saying we're going to speak on favor.
 And I remember working for a clothing store when I was 16.
 I'm still, you know, obviously still in high school and whatnot.
 And they made me the assistant manager.
 You know, I'm, I am a part time staff member who's in high school.
 And they made me the assistant manager of the store.
 That's outrageous.
 Just because I like to work hard when I was there and, you know, I, I like to do
 things like scheduling and organizing things and, you know,
  </li><li>Tell the story about how you got hired a national car rental
 and then how many promotions you had in a certain--
  </li><li>Yeah, that's another one.
 Yeah, I had just started working
 at this restaurant called Graffiti's.
  </li><li>You were a server?
  </li><li>I was a server.
 And I had only been working there a couple of days
 and I had one of those shifts where sort of everything
 was going wrong in terms of like I had sent in an order
 So there was, you know, there's these two guys, business guys, sitting in the corner
 table and they seemed like nice guys.
 Everything was fine with their table.
 The table next to them, they had a food allergy.
 I knew I'd put in the order right and I'm watching a different server put the food down
 in front of them and I'm like, there is mushrooms on that.
 And so I sort of swept in and grabbed it and went, I don't think this one's yours, you
 know, and just sort of went back and like got that fixed and then there was something that
 happen, I can't even remember with the table on the other side of them. And I realized, you know,
 I could tell they were kind of paying attention, but I thought they might be from corporate because
 we'd been told, Hey, corporate's around all this week. And in fact, I had this other table with
 owner at it at the exact same time. And so I was just sort of like, okay, it's my first week. And
 honestly, I was thinking, if this doesn't go well, and I get fired today, my other job asked me not
 to leave and said they'd always have a position open for me. So I was like, you know what, it is
 what it is. You know, there's things I can control and things that I can't. Anyway,
 sort of the whole thing ends and these guys are still sitting there. They're just waiting.
 And so I went over and just said, hey guys, do anything else? And the younger of them,
 the two just said to me, hey, yeah, I wanted to offer you a job. And I was like, oh, that's so
 I have a job, you know, like, here I am working my job.
 And he's like, no, I think you'd like this job
 and you know whatever.
 And I was like, oh, you know,
 and I'm just trying to be kind and polite and everything,
 but I'm sort of like, you know, and I was,
 oh, well, where do you work?
 And he said, oh, I work for National Car Rental.
 And I was like, okay, and this guy's like 30 something.
 And I'm like, oh yeah, oh great.
 Well, you know, I think I'm good.
 like I just started this job and everything's like,
 well, I'll just leave my card and you know,
 you can give me a call if you want to talk about it.
 I was like, okay, so you know, he gets up and leaves.
 I'm like, see you later.
 I go over, pick up his card afterwards.
 He's the president of National Car Rental.
 And I was like, huh, well, that's interesting.
 But I didn't even pursue it.
 Like I was like, I just started this new job.
  </li><li>'Cause you're thinking he wants you to be a sales clerk
 at a rental, at the airport or something.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was like, no.
 And I liked serving tables and I liked, you know, just,
 I knew how to do that.
 So about a week later, he shows up again
 and he literally just asked for my sections at Downey's
 like, I'm here to ask you to work for me again, you know?
 And I was like, you know, and so I'm trying to be like,
 I was like, oh, great, did you want to thank for lunch?
 You know, and like serving, whatever.
 And then when he left, he's like,
 would you just come and meet with me once,
 like to see what I'm, what I'll offer?
 And I was like, yeah, sure, I will, absolutely.
 So ended up going in for this interview with him
 and the vice president of operations.
 And they offered me a job that included having a brand new
 four by four and free gas and free insurance and, you know,
 all like all the bells and whistles making great money, you know,
 and in middle management.
 So not, not counter whatever, but like in city management level.
 And I was like, okay, but sort of like based on what?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Like based on what are you offering this to me?
 And he was just like, I just love the way you handled it
 when everything went wrong.
 And he's like, and I think I can use that.
 And I remember telling them at the interview,
 I'm gonna be in full-time ministry in five years.
 So if you still wanna offer me the job,
 I'll do that for five years.
 I'll give you 110%, but I just wanted to let you know
 in case you didn't wanna make the investment.
 He said, well, we'll take it.
 But then, but that, I mean, that was an exceptional way of getting hired from nothing.
 You didn't apply for anything and you're in the door.
 But then how many times were you promoted in the five years you were there?
 I had promoted eight times.
 Eight times.
 Yeah.
 And I mean, I got to do some stuff like that they'd never asked anybody to do before
 since, you know, so like a one point for a year and a half, they essentially paid me
 to pastor all of the store managers for all of Toronto and for the airport.
 So there's like 30, you're talking about probably 30 managers total.
 And my job was to go around and meet them and have lunch or have coffee with them
 and, and help them like sort out, Hey, what are you dreaming about?
 And is this a good fit for you?
 And, and, and even teach them how to work as a team together and all this kind of
 stuff. And I was just like, you want to, you want to do what?
 You know, yeah.
 So I, I loved it.
 I mean, it was, it was great.
 Um, but I think when I look consistently, like other than one, uh,
 restaurant that I worked for, for like a short period of time, uh,
 where I had witnessed to the owners daughters and they were of a different
 faith.
 And so I got fired for doing that.
 Um, other than that job, I have been promoted every job I've ever had.
 That's favorite right there.
 I think it's, I mean, I love hearing that story and I've noticed that.
 And the time that we married to that favor transfer over
 one of the things that people have consistently asked us over the years working at Grey Center is
 How do you get so much stuff done?
 And I would say the answer is that prayer establish the work of our hands for us that yes, we show up and
 Of course we work, but I
 We do work hard, but it's so fun. Yes, but I also think other people
 Work hard to like it's not for lack of work, but I think there's a grace. There's an ease. There's an anointing
 that I think favor reduces friction and you you can I
 mean I would I would put a lot of the fruit of our labor
 The you know the fruit coming from that not just our labor but an answer to that prayer
 Lord established the work of our hands for us which so that's totally cool. I don't think I've ever prayed that
 I don't think I've ever prayed for favor.
  </li><li>What's because I pray for you, Daria?
  </li><li>Well, thank you, we're one.
  </li><li>Yeah, I'm like, you know.
  </li><li>So I'm just like, I've ridden in on that.
  </li><li>Yep, absolutely.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>I'm more praying about life.
  </li><li>You never prayed that prayer?
  </li><li>No, I pray stuff like, make me kind
 and give me a clean heart and help me to treat people well.
 Like, so I don't know, I don't know.
  </li><li>Wow, you've never prayed that and you still have favor.
 Think about what your favor is gonna be like
 when you start praying that.
  </li><li>Right, maybe I should start and see what happens.
  </li><li>Let's continue, Nehemiah.
  </li><li>Okay.
 Nehemiah, chapter one ends with Nehemiah making his request before the king.
 Yes.
 Look what it says, says this.
 "Nehemiah 2, verse 8, 'The king granted these requests because the gracious hand of
 God was on me.'"
 Yeah.
 "Like, Nehemiah knew where the answer came from.
 It was the hand of the Lord.
 It wasn't the hand of the Lord on the king.
 It was the hand of the Lord on Nehemiah.
 The favor on Nehemiah's life caused the king to respond favorably."
 keeps going and he says,
 "No, that's it, the King grant these requests
 "because the gracious hand of God was on me."
 I think it's amazing, the King didn't reply
 because he was godly or because he was righteous.
 He says it was because the hand of God was on Nehemiah.
 I love that.
 When we cultivate a rich relationship with the Father,
 favor begins to follow.
 And it affects all aspects of our life.
 Proverbs three, verse one, says this.
 One of my favorite proverbs, I love this.
 My son, do not forget my teaching,
 but keep my commands in your hearts
 for they will prolong your life many years
 and bring you peace and prosperity.
 Let love and faithfulness never leave.
 You bind them around your neck,
 write them on the tablet of your heart.
 Then you will win favor and a good name
 in the sight of God and man.
 It's important to remember favor is not a reward,
 it's simply a byproduct of living righteously.
 So if you listen to this,
 Understand that you already have favor,
 learn to grow in favor by asking for it,
 like ask God for favor,
 and then also live righteously.
  </li><li>Yeah, I think character is what can disqualify you,
 or lack of character is what can disqualify you
 from accessing favor.
 I mean, although I don't think it,
 which is, you know, I don't wanna,
 I don't think it necessarily always does though,
 'Cause I certainly can think of people who are not righteous
 but are still walking in some level of favor.
  </li><li>Absolutely.
  </li><li>But I think for how, right, for how I want to live,
 I'm gonna pay attention to the character stuff too.
 I'm not just saying, oh, Father, give me favor,
 but not actually living right-chisly.
  </li><li>I think where we get into trouble,
 where I've got into trouble historically,
 there's a thin line between expecting favor, which I think is right to do, and entitlement.
 Yes. All right. Well, you think things should be given to you for whatever reason?
 Well, I have favor. So I'll get that. Yeah. And I should get this. Or basically, God,
 you owe me this. That's where we get into trouble. But I just think of time and time again,
 in our married life, where we have taken our favor out for a spin, where we've asked
 and the Lord has...
 Provided, for sure.
 ...graciously provided.
 Yeah.
 And on reflection, I'm like, "If I hadn't stepped out, that favor wouldn't have been
 given to me."
 Yes.
 Like there's a great possibility if Nehemiah didn't go approach the king, none of that
 would have happened.
 For sure.
 No, you don't know that, but the inference in the story is because he went out and stepped
 out.
 And so I want to encourage you, if you're listening this week, start deliberately asking the Lord
 for favor.
 Yeah.
 that I've mentioned there, pray over them and see what the Lord does in that.
 That sounds good.
 You look like you're ready for a listeners question.
 I am ready for a listeners question.
 How about a listeners question about the Enneagram?
 Oh, yes.
 How about that?
 Okay, this is an anonymous question.
 Okay.
 So this, hey guys, what are your thoughts on the Enneagram?
 I've done some research that indicates that it's based in very bad things, but I know
 I know there are a lot of Christians deep diving into it,
 and it's alarming to me.
 Clearly, I've made up my mind as to what to think,
 but I would love to hear your thoughts.
 A.J. Jones, what are your thoughts?
  </li><li>My thoughts, anonymous,
 is that it's alarming to me as well.
 When I first started hearing about the anagram,
 just hearing about it from different friends,
 that kind of stuff, every time I would hear about it,
 I would just get this huge sort of check in my spirit.
 Like just like, ugh, this isn't good.
  </li><li>How does that feel?
 How do you know that check is there?
  </li><li>I feel usually two things.
 I feel like a stop,
 like a, you know, don't just don't go there.
 And I also feel kind of slimy at the same time,
 like I'm like, "Ooh."
 So to me, I'm like, "Ooh."
 Those two things for me were like,
 "Oh, there's something that's not good about this.
 "I didn't know what it was.
 "I didn't really bother with it that much
 until everybody and their mother was into it.
 And actually some people on the school were asking like,
 what do you think of the anneagram?
 And I thought, oh, I should do some research
 as to why I feel this way.
 'Cause honestly for me at this moment, it's enough.
 If I feel like the Holy Spirit is like,
 have nothing to do with that,
 I'm fine to have nothing to do with that.
 And I don't need to research it further.
  </li><li>And that's consistent with the way you've lived your life.
 Yes.
 And often afterwards I'll find out I'm so glad I had nothing to do with.
 Like that time that I wanted to go see a movie and I asked if you'd come and see the movie
 and I'm leaving a movie named Anonymous for a reason.
 And you were like, no.
 And I was like, why are you like, I just feel like checking my spirit not to go see it.
 And I was like, I really want to see it.
 And you're like, well, you're grown up because do what you want.
 And I went to it and then I came home and said, can you do deliverance on me?
 I think we got the firehills.
 I was freaked out by that movie and you had to do deliverance on me.
 So I've learned to pay attention to that thing.
 When I did some research afterwards, it does have some basis and some foundation in a cult
 and an occult teacher who came up with it and all that kind of stuff.
 And to me, I'm like, if the foundation has anything to do with occult stuff or somebody
 who operated in the cult came up with it, to me, if the foundation's rotten, the thing's
 rotten.
 And so I would stay away from it.
 for me, I know even less about the Enneagram, I just trust my wife's
 discernment. I have never had an interest or hasn't peaked my interest.
 I hear a lot of people talking about it. I, yeah, so I am vaguely aware of
 what it is, you know, but I have nothing more than going on.
 Yeah, I did end up reading an interesting article that actually will
 encryst send to me when I was doing a whole bunch of research, which maybe
 we can post a link to in the show notes, but also like so
 reading that you could go well maybe this is just one guy's
 opinion but Wikipedia mentions all these same people being the
 ones that came up with it.
 A piece of settled.
 Not just Wikipedia but there's like a so I sort of like even
 back check that I I would stay away from it.
 Okay.
 So anonymous what do we think?
 That's what we think.
