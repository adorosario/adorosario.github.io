<p> &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; I'll end in AJ's podcast for your Monday &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Most wonderful show is &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;<br/>
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Keeping up with the Joneses &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
</p><ul>
  <li>Everybody, if you could just hear
 what AJ Jones said before we start recording,
 it would make your mother blush.
  </li><li>It would not, not if your mother was married.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>It made me blush and I'm married.
  </li><li>Alan and I had a discussion like a couple days ago
 where he was like,
  </li><li>Oh, I didn't know that that was your need.
 So I'm just making my needs known for later.
  </li><li>With, with, with, with, with very specific,
 very articulate and very granular in your needs.
  </li><li>You know what though, isn't that helpful?
 Now you know exactly what my needs are.
  </li><li>It's very helpful and I feel guilt for shaming you
 so that my shame will go away.
 (laughing)
 Whoo, and now I'm blushing.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Welcome back to the podcast.
 We're excited that you're here.
  </li><li>Why don't you usually get to make you blush?
 So that's kind of fun.
 Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's been the other way around
 for 15 years, so buckle up, buttercup.
  </li><li>So now you're getting paid back.
 You've discovered the little button
 that you can press and make me go.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>Oh, look at that.
  </li><li>How was your week?
  </li><li>Good.
 It was good, it was good week.
  </li><li>Do you want to know where new?
  </li><li>No, didn't go anywhere new.
  </li><li>Do you know any new movies?
  </li><li>Nope.
  </li><li>Yesterday we didn't have a teenager.
 This morning we woke up.
 We had a 13 year old in our house.
  </li><li>And she's gorgeous.
 He's just stunning.
 It's probably worth mentioning right at the start that we are running on several hours
 of sleep.
 Or several hours less sleep than we should be running on.
 Yeah, I read a study that said that drunk people outperform sleep deprived people.
 Oh dear.
 So technically we're podcasting drunk.
 That explains a lot about the last 10 minutes.
 Right.
 We have a 13 year old.
 Of course we're on lockdown.
 She understandably had lots of feelings about not being able to have a party, not being able
 to go out with a family tradition that we do every birthday.
 We can't do any of that.
 And so she was feeling lots of sadness.
 I asked what she needed.
 And she was like, you know what?
 I want to do something special.
 Yes.
 So I was like, well, what do you want to do that special?
 And she was like, I would love it if you could make me an escape game.
 Yes.
 And so I was like, you mean you want me to lock you in a room and you have to solve puzzles
 to, yes, she was like, yes.
 So then the kids, the other her siblings were all like, can we play?
 we play. So for the last week, I've been scheming and devising a, what do you call an escape
 room? And ordering tricky things like books with combination locks and things like that.
 I couldn't save. And so the plan was last night, we all locked them in this room. I literally
 reversed the lock on the bedroom. So the lock was on the outside. So they truly were locked
 in. And I'm not sure if that's legal. Well, we had contingency plans. Yeah. Very specific
 continuously plans, which they later followed, which is where the stories go.
 And so we put them into bed at eight o'clock.
 We thought this was going to be great.
 We went to bed at two a.m.
 I get a phone call.
 OK, we didn't go to bed at eight o'clock because I still had to make cheesecake
 and other things for the birthday.
 So we actually went to bed at like 11 30.
 Right.
 They went to bed at eight.
 Yes.
 About two a.m.
 From the data sleep, my, my wrist vibrates and I look at it and it's my daughter.
 And she's like, can you come upstairs?
 So I got stairs. All three kids are kind of having a revolt.
 It looks too hot in here. I'm hungry.
 Can we sleep in our own beds?
 So I'm like, yes.
 And then came downstairs.
 Well, then I had to kind of reconfigure our house alarm and our lights
 and because there was a bunch of home automation stuff
 into integral to the escape game.
 Yeah.
 So needless to say, I didn't really get any sleep between two and...
 Well, you came back to bed at like two forty-five
 and got back in bed and I lied there for another 45 minutes.
 still couldn't sleep. So I got up and left.
 And then you getting up convinced me to go on trying to sleep.
 So I played on my phone for like another hour and a half.
 Well, I was taxing you because I wasn't sure if you were asleep or you were playing on the switch.
 And then I realized, wait, you're not dead.
 At first I couldn't find you on any of the cameras.
 I was like, have you been raptured?
 Because if so, that messes with my theology.
 But we're sitting in the dark because I didn't want to light to wake anybody up.
 Right. So I eventually I got up.
 I just played Nintendo till dawn.
 Yeah. He got up at like 5.30.
 and I went back to bed at six and then we got up at 7.45 and so who knows what's
 gonna happen in this episode because it's hard stringing words together. I'm
 amazed I showered and didn't drown and I don't know how you would drown in a
 shower but I could have done it. We wanted to thank everybody who has started
 listening to the podcast all of the new people and then all of our faithful
 people that have been watching for a while and we're so happy to be back.
 We've also enjoyed doing the live Instagram hangs with you guys and answering
 your questions and seeing your names go by and it's just been, it's been super fun.
 Last week we started on this journey about feelings and we introduced this
 wonderful book, well, a book that wasn't wonderful the first time I read it because
 I really didn't enjoy it, but now love it.
 A book called Voice of the Heart by Chip Dodd.
 Many of you in the comments said you've already purchased a copy, so hopefully
 that's arrived by now.
 It's the book that we're gonna be using
 to go through these eight feelings.
 And indeed in the book, Chip makes this radical statement.
 He says that basically there's only eight core feelings.
 And one of the keys to living fully
 is to get very, very fluent with what those eight feelings were.
 So a reminder, our eight feelings are.
  </li><li>Hurt, lonely, sad, angry, fear, shame,
 guilt and glad.
 You win a t-shirt or a ticket or something,
 'cause that was great.
 Here's the thing, if we don't understand
 that there are eight core feelings,
 which I didn't until I read the book.
  </li><li>I thought it was ludicrous.
 I was like, there's not just eight.
 There's so many more than that.
 How can they say that?
  </li><li>Right. - Very limiting.
  </li><li>Yeah, so initially that was our reaction.
 But what I've since come to learn and appreciate is
 that if we don't practice the discipline
 of distilling what we're feeling into those eight core feelings.
  </li><li>Which takes work.
  </li><li>Which takes work.
 we end up moving away from the truth of what we're feeling.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So what I mean by that is,
 especially in our church world,
 especially in the Christian world,
 it's not good to have some of the negative feelings.
  </li><li>Well, actually probably the only feeling
 like we talked about last week is glad
 is the only one that we would probably say,
 "Oh, that's a good feeling."
  </li><li>So here's a discipline I want you to try and practice.
 And then in the coming weeks that we're doing,
 this is what we'd love you to do is
 whenever you're feeling a feeling,
 Or whenever you're feeling something,
 like forget if you're feeling a feeling,
 let's say you're just like, I'm feeling something,
 your first attempt is going to be probably
 to say something other than those eight feelings.
 Like I'm super ticked or I'm, you know, I'm just,
 oh yeah, I'm upset.
 There's a great banal vanilla statement.
 I'm upset.
 Stop right there.
 That's beautiful.
 Like you've identified something's going on in here,
 but I'm upset, doesn't help you,
 doesn't help the people who are in relationship with you,
 sit and think what makes up my upset.
 If I was gonna make a shopping list out
 of the eight core feelings,
 what part of those eight core feelings are in my upset?
 Because upset for you might be very different than upset for me,
 which might be very different than upset for you.
  </li><li>I often say I'm aggravated or I'm frustrated.
 Like I feel frustrated and you'll be like,
 oh, what feeling is that?
 Which makes me feel frustrated.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>But even we had something last night.
 do you want to talk about?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Let's talk about that so I don't uncover you.
  </li><li>Okay, so we just got into bed and I was like,
 I just need to cuddle.
 I feel things, you know?
 So we're talking about and I said,
 babe, I think I feel overwhelmed.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And you said, do you know what's overwhelmed?
 Like, do you know what you feel in that?
 And I was like, oh, yeah, I think I feel angry
 and lonely and sad.
  </li><li>And so moving from overwhelmed to angry, lonely and sad,
 man, oh, I know what angry and lonely and sad feels like,
 I can be with you and you're angry, lonely and sad.
 I can sit with you, but feeling overwhelmed,
 like feeling overwhelmed for me might be made up
 a completely different feeling.
 So the discipline we wanna get you to just play around with,
 just start practicing this with yourself is,
 whenever you're feeling something, stop and kind of work out,
 what are the components of the something that I'm feeling?
 Because we, what me, I spent years getting away
 from those eight core feelings.
 And so it takes a little bit of work returning to them,
 but here's the beauty.
 Any step away from those eight core feelings
 is the step away from truth.
 And if we want the vulnerable relationships
 that we're all dreaming of,
 that comes out of being truthful and being vulnerable.
 And so it's a simple step, but gosh,
 it's sometimes really hard work
 because sometimes I don't know what I'm feeling.
 And for me, I need to talk about it.
 For you, like, we had a little discussion about
 how long you'd been feeling that for
 and why it was at 11 p.m.
 That you'd carried that all day.
 Do you wanna unpack that?
  </li><li>All day.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was feeling,
 and it was getting added to all day.
 And so some of it was, yesterday was just a busy day,
 getting ready for a birthday today
 and doing things like grocery shopping
 and wearing masks and making cheesecake for the first time
 and all those kind of things,
 but then throw in some conversations with family
 and things like that.
 And I didn't process how I was feeling
 about anything I was just sort of piling on.
 And so I realized I sort of woke up
 and immediately felt kind of lonely.
 And then it just, I just was collecting in buckets
 All day. Yeah, and my question, which is this might sound like a shaming question.
 That certainly wasn't my heart.
 I don't know if it felt shaming to you was.
 I was curious about what it was that took the whole day to go through that until 11
 p.m. before there was awareness of this is what I'm feeling.
 And I think I think I even said last night, babe, my sadness is you've walked through
 all of this distress, all these feelings without knowing what you're feeling, without knowing your needs.
 all day. And I'm glad to be with you. Now that could all be my story about not being
 involved and yadda yadda yadda. But do you know what was going on that took you to 11 p.m.?
 Well, so I think it's safe to say I'm historically bad at knowing what I'm feeling or how I got
 there. And because I don't really verbally process a whole lot, it takes me a while. Like I tend to
 contemplate. And then also it felt like there was so much to do and so much to get
 done to be ready for today that it didn't seem like I could do that. Which I probably
 could have because I probably spent more energy running from how I was feeling like in terms
 of what it cost me. So yeah, I mean, I think I was choosing to be disconnected from how
 I felt. But then I wasn't actually because I could feel it the whole way through. Like
 at dinner, I said, we were doing our highs lows and unexpected. And I said, my low is
 I felt sad all day. And so Tia said, "Mummy, why do you feel sad?" And I said, "I don't know."
 Like, so I knew I was feeling stuff.
 Something, yeah.
 I just didn't feel like I had time to stop and think about it.
 Right. And the reason we tell that story when we go back and forth and contrast and like,
 "I'm just this verbal processor who's going to talk all the time and you like to sit,
 contemplate think is there's not a right way of doing this.
 There's a beautiful clumsiness to learning to walk out.
 Like my approach of just talking about it isn't better than
 AJ's approach of of sitting with it.
 Like there, I think I have fear in that we're talking about
 this that somehow we're like, okay, so this is what you need
 to do, ABC, feeling feelings, tell the truth and everything's
 going to be okay.
 No, like life as we're going to discover is not okay.
 Life has the opportunity to be incredibly glorious, but life
 life is also filled with incredibly tragic moments like, you know, a global pandemic
 that's shutting down the whole world. And yeah, in that we get to be human, we get to
 be clumsy, we get to be together, we get to be a par. And so we're just trying to, we
 are trying to make our living visible as an encouragement. Good. How do you feel sharing
 all of that in front of everybody?
 Yeah, I'm fine.
 What's fine?
 What's fine?
 Oh, okay.
 Oh, you said group and they would say stuff like that.
 I'd be like, oh, I feel really angry right now.
 What's fine.
 Fine.
 I don't know.
 I, I feel a piece.
 I feel, I feel less lonely.
 Oh.
 So talking about the loneliness you felt yesterday leads you to feeling less lonely.
 Yeah.
 I mean, even just talking about all that stuff with you last night.
 Uh, I, I, then I felt right asleep.
 So in the previous night because it it had started with a conversation
 With a family member the previous night where it just wasn't identifying how I was feeling and I just
 Didn't sleep well carry that into the next day kind of thing. Yeah beautiful
 I think what I would love to encourage you with is again cuz Allen started this journey before I did he all of a sudden had this new
 set of language
 that I was like, I don't know how to talk that.
 Like I need some definition.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And for me, it felt a little scary
 just because I was like, I don't know what it means
 when you say you're angry and why we're okay with that
 and things like that.
 So yeah.
 So I think I just want everybody listening to realize
 or to know that in the next couple of weeks
 we're going to try and bring some definition to what do all these emotions look like?
 What it like when we say angry, what does that mean? When we say lonely, what does that mean?
 Because it's you're learning a new, a new way of kind of relating to the world and relating to
 your own heart. And it does to begin with take work, like take effort. But it starts getting a
 a little bit easier as you get used to it.
 I, when I first started going to group
 and people would sit there and,
 and they would read off that they felt all eight emotions.
 And I was just in my head be like, how?
 How?
 Like, in my head I was like, my question is how?
 How do you feel eight emotions at once?
 How?
 You know?
 And I would always be like, huh, well, I feel glad.
 And I know they're gonna say, if I only pick glad
 that I have to pick another one.
 So I feel, you know, I'm trying to like, you know,
 I just, it took me longer to catch on.
  </li><li>Oh, that's the truth.
 I mean, I literally, I literally couldn't identify
 my feelings if you wrote them down on a piece of paper.
 And that's not an exaggeration.
 For a year, every week, either my therapist
 or in group, they'll be like,
 "And what are you feeling?"
 And here's a cheat sheet.
 There's eight of them written down, just, you know, talk about.
 I couldn't tell if I was angry.
 I thought in order for me to feel angry,
 you know, a child had to be kidnapped in front of me,
 like, "I am angry about that injustice.
 "I didn't realize I could be angry about lesser things.
 "I thought angry was reserved to the big stuff."
 And, you know, I wasn't fearful of you kidding me,
 like I'm more than a conqueror in Christ.
 I've got no fear.
 I didn't know what to do with them.
 And so I want to encourage you that just listening
 to some of like us unpacking what's inside a feeling
 will probably help you identify,
 like, oh, I didn't know that was shame.
 I didn't know that was a component of fear.
 Yeah.
 And I'm excited about that.
 Before we even jump into that, though,
 I want to tell you some really good news about feelings.
 I also want to tell you some good news
 and some bad news about feelings.
 And it's this.
 First of all, I want you to understand
 that feelings are just a truth about an experience we're having.
 That's kind of a confusing statement,
 but your feelings are true to you
 about how you experience an event. Now, the event that you're having feelings about might
 not be real. So just before we started recording, we were trying to have something new, we've
 got some new lights, we're trying to have a bunch of stuff. I'm trying to set the camera
 up, I've had to move stuff around in the studio. And I hear AJ go, this big long exhale, which
 to me is code for, hey, you suck. You are the worst person ever. Like, I wish you weren't
 born. I can't believe how bad you are all of this. You literally suck. Like that's code in my head.
 So I'm having really real feelings about that really, really experience, but the narrative that's
 told me that when AJ breathe heavily, she's upset me isn't true at all. That makes sense? But that
 doesn't nullify the feeling I was having. So I'm feeling fear that AJ's upset with me. I'm feeling
 guilt that I'm not better at this. I'm feeling really toxic shame that, you know, if I was, you
 you know, better prepared.
 I wouldn't have to keep her waiting.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I'm feeling sadness that, you know,
 sometimes I'm causing her pain.
 And so I said to AJ, "Hey babe, I feel really sad
 when you make that, you know, breathing."
 And AJ said, "Babe, my whole life,
 I do, everyone's a while, I do deep breaths.
 I don't know if it's because I was asthmatic
 or whatever it is, but I've always done that.
 And it doesn't mean anything at all.
 It's been happening for 15 years.
 And every time I do it,
 you think I'm upset with you and it happens all the time.
 I'm not upset.
 I just breathe that way.
 That's a suddenly I'm like, oh, the story I told myself about what you're feeling isn't
 true.
 So don't get hung up on your feelings like, well, well, those feelings weren't right
 to have.
 We're not talking about whether they're right to have or not.
 You're going to have feelings whether you think you should or you shouldn't.
 You will have feelings.
 You will have feelings.
 But it's a truth just about the experience you're having.
 That's all it is in one sense.
  </li><li>And it's still your truth.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the reason we wanna get really, really good
 at feeling our feelings is it allows us to be present
 and truthful with ourselves, which allows us to be present
 and truthful with each other, which allows us to be present
 and truthful with the Lord.
 It just enhances our relationships.
 If we're gonna move away from the truth of what we're feeling,
 we then build this hidden agenda that we're now managing.
 So like if I'm not brave enough to actually tell AJ,
 "Hey babe, I feel scared when you say
 "because this is what goes on inside my..."
 Here's, let me make my storyteller true to you,
 which is hugely vulnerable because
 Agee could turn around and shame me for that.
 Like, well, you know, that's your issue.
 And, you know, you should man up
 and I can't believe all this nambi pam.
 She didn't do any of that.
 She was just like, babe, I'm so sorry.
 Like, this is how I breathe.
 That wasn't the truth of it.
 And I'm like, oh, okay.
 That builds intimacy and that builds connection.
  </li><li>I know, I kind of, kind of just want to like jump you
 right now actually.
 (laughing)
 We'll be back after this commercial break.
 And we're back.
 Feelings work on telling you leads to unexpected adventures.
 So here's the good news.
 I want to tell you, this is a great news about feelings.
 Every feeling comes with a gift.
 and we're going to talk about what each of the gifts are with each of the feelings.
 The only way to get to the gift of the feeling is to feel the feeling.
 And that's why it's really, really important that we're truthful about what we're feeling
 in part so that we're authentic to ourselves, but also so that we receive the gift
 that God packaged up inside the feeling.
 Yeah.
 Here's the downside.
 If we're not going to be honest about what we're feeling,
 if we refuse to feel what we're feeling,
 if we try and hide our feelings, if we live with an agenda,
 that you did that I didn't have feelings about the way
 you breathe, all that sort of stuff.
 What's gonna end up is we're not gonna get the gift,
 we're actually gonna get an impaired version
 of the feeling, which basically means your feelings
 are gonna come out sideways.
 So what we're gonna do every week is we're gonna take
 the feeling, like this week we're gonna talk about hurt,
 we're gonna talk about what is the gift of hurt?
 Which even that just sounds bizarre.
  </li><li>It does, it's yes.
 As somebody who's experienced a lot of hurt,
 it didn't feel like there was a lot of gift in any of it.
  </li><li>So we're gonna unpack what the gift is,
 And then we're gonna look at,
 well, what's the impairment if we refuse to feel our feelings?
 I was more in touch with the impaired version of the feeling
 because of course I practiced refusing to feel my feelings.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But this is the promise.
 There's a gift and there's an impairment.
  </li><li>As we said this week, we're gonna focus on hurt.
  </li><li>Ooh, can I get a whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.
 Here's the thing about hurt.
 Nobody wants to feel it, but actually feeling hurt
 is vital for full living.
 Her actually tells us that we're in pain.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And understanding that we're in pain
 is just huge for full living.
 There's a physical, a physiological disorder
 called congenital insensitivity to pain.
 It's literally where you have no pain receptors.
 It's a very, very rare disease,
 but children can be born with it.
 And I remember hearing about this
 when I was a kid thinking, "Man, it'd be awesome."
 So never feel like you're in pain.
 Now as a parent raising children and thinking,
 Wow, actually, my children not knowing they're in pain would be terrible, which is why it
 leads to sadly really high death rates in infants because they don't know the stovas on.
 They've got their hand there and they don't feel pain or...
 That's kind of like me with the bath.
 From infant mortality to it's like you having a bath, please go on.
 Oh, I'm just thinking because I serve tables for 14 years, I don't really feel heat in my fingers
 and I can pick up hot plates and it doesn't really burn me or I can burn me and not really feel it.
 So like at restaurants, waiters will hand you a plate and they'll go, "Oh no, I'll put it in front of you.
 It's hot and it never feels hot to me." The problem is I use the same hands to stick my hand in the bath to
 determine if it's the right temperature before I place my entire body in the bath and usually it's
 cook your innards hot and I have not clocked that. So now I use a meat thermometer.
 True story. We keep a meat thermometer in our bathroom, so A.G. doesn't scold herself, and as she says, cook her inners.
 Yep.
 Right. The point is, knowing that you're physically in pain is essential for survival.
 And as it's true in the physical, it's also true in the emotional as well.
 Feeling her is a gift that lets you know that the pain is present.
 Yeah.
 And what's interesting about her is, her actually shows up in all the other feelings.
 That's amazing.
 So when you're feeling loneliness, there's the hurt of being alone because we're social beings, we're made to be connected with people.
 When we're feeling sad, there's hurt in the loss of what we're grieving over.
 So you will find hurt in all seven other feelings.
 Hurt is an absolutely vital feeling.
 So here's the thing.
 We will get hurt in life.
 No.
 Yes.
 Hurt is absolutely unavoidable, and that's not an ungodly belief.
 That's just the truth. You live on a planet with a bunch of other people.
 Hurts going to be part of it, right?
 So if you think about John 16 verse 33,
 it says in this world, you will have trouble that word trouble there means
 pressure. Yeah, it means pressure. It means affliction.
 By the way, that's Jesus speaking. Jesus is telling everybody, yeah,
 hey, in this world, you're going to have trouble.
 Yeah. Well, when we actually became Christians, we didn't,
 we didn't get something that said, now everything's going to go perfectly
 swimmingly and you're never gonna have problems again.
 And here's what's worse is your hurt is often caused by the people who are closest to you.
 Oh, that's for sure.
 Which means the person sitting next to me is hurting me the most.
 See, just evidence and example of that.
 By the way, you missed my sensitive nipples.
 If we are gonna have the rich relationships that we desperately desire,
 we are literally signing up for a world of hurt.
 Yep.
 Right? If parents, you know this, you've got kids and you love them, but they're able to hurt you
 and cause pain like nobody else. And if you don't have kids, you had parents, you remember
 being hurt by your parents. Yeah. Right? They love you. And we experience hurt. And so
 hurt is unavoidable. And we're going to have the option to feel hurt a lot.
 So we might as well get good at processing it. Right.
 Because in order to live fully, we actually have to get good at feeling hurt.
 See everything in Alan age eight get to the gift and her well actually there's two gifts and her two for the price of one amazing number one is if we will feel our hurt if we will get in touch with the pain.
 We will find healing and not only that we will find the courage to find healing and that's our two gifts and you might be thinking well how does that work well.
 It's more good news disguised as bad news.
 Good.
 (laughing)
 If we've worked really hard to avoid our feelings,
 there's another thing that we've been working really,
 really hard to avoid.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And that's our needs.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>Right?
 Because in our culture, we don't wanna be seen as needy.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Especially in church culture.
 Like, well, I don't wanna be one of those needy people.
 As a pastor, that's one of the most common things
 when I meet with people and I'm saying,
 I'm so sorry you're going through this.
 Like, you know, let's talk about that.
 And they're like, well, I didn't wanna talk about it.
 I just didn't wanna appear needy.
 I'm like, news flash, we are created utterly needy,
 utterly dependent.
 We remember the good news is we needed a savior
 because we couldn't save ourselves.
 Somehow we think we get saved
 and then we no longer have any needs.
  </li><li>That's actually what, when I finished the Sage Hill
 training, one of the people who led our group said to me,
 their desire for me was that I would get needy.
 And I was like, what?
  </li><li>I'll punch you in this throat.
  </li><li>You want me to do what?
 But I get it now.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Honestly, one of the gifts of feeling hurt,
 a feeling hurt tells us we're in pain,
 our pain tells us we have a need.
 Knowing that we have a need
 is one of the first steps to finding healing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Then you have something Jesus can answer, don't you?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So if I'm feeling hurt because I was rejected,
 then I'm aware that my need is to be accepted.
  </li><li>I've a thought for you.
 go on. And we may have talked about this a few weeks ago, or maybe it was just you and I talking,
 but I was just thinking about, you know, Jesus, when he would heal people before he healed them,
 he always asked them what they wanted, even though you would think would be blindingly obvious. Well,
 he's a leper. Well, he's blind. Well, he's, but he's actually asking them to be in touch with what
 they need so he can actually answer a need. It's almost like Jesus knew about the human condition.
 Who knew? That's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like blind part of us. What does he want me to do
 for you. Yeah. Are you kidding right now? I'm going to dance. Right. We probably need
 more sleep before we're going to the podcast. Honestly, we're professionals. Okay, where
 were we? I don't know. Back to the notes joke. Right. We're talking about if we're feeling
 our pain. Our pain will tell us what we need. So we're talking about like, if I feel pain because
 of rejection, I know my need is acceptance. If I'm feeling hurt, perhaps I realize that like, oh,
 what I need in my heart is I need somebody to take responsibility for the heart they caused me.
 And I need somebody to make amends. Or perhaps I'm hurt and sitting in my heart,
 realize, helps me realize that actually what I need is some space. So feeling our feelings leads
 us to our needs. You're going to hear that over and over again that repeatedly that you're
 not going to know what you need till you know what you're feeling. One of the most common
 questions people ask people who are in trauma, like when my parents died, my parents died
 within about a year and a half of each other, beautiful, well-meaning, honest, good, sincere
 friends would call me and they'd be like, "Hey, if there's anything you need, just let
 me know." And it wasn't lip service. I know these people would drop and do anything for
 me. But that was a useless question because I didn't know what I needed.
 Right.
 Right. So so important to feel our feelings so we know what our needs are.
 Yeah. So when we embrace that we're needy and we admit that we're hurt, we
 actually get to take the first steps towards healing, which is actually
 really encouraging.
 Yeah. Also, when we admit that we're hurt, we're actually practicing a form of
 vulnerability, which is so powerful. And it says that God draws close to the
 humble, but he knows the pride from afar. And so, you know, admitting that
 that your hurt is a humbling process.
 You were just saying, hey, you actually had access
 to the control panel of my heart
 and now I am feeling hurt because of our interaction.
 It's hugely vulnerable, hugely powerful
 at building rich, authentic relationships.
  </li><li>Yeah, but again, I think if you are used to living
 with a protected heart, which you're doing all the work
 on that, or as a survivor to talk about,
 living vulnerable feels really, really scary.
 But the fact is healing actually lies on the other side
 of being vulnerable and feeling your feelings.
  </li><li>Amen.
 Chip writes something brilliant in his book.
  </li><li>When we tell the truth about hurt,
 others can help us heal.
 Healing sets us free from lowered expectations,
 counterfeit fulfillments, hopelessness,
 resignation and toxic shame about how we're made.
 One of the gifts of hurt is that it gets us
 in touch with our needs very quickly.
 So that's the gift. If we feel our hurt, it leads us to healing and it leads us to the
 courage to find that healing, which is beautiful. But AJ, what about the impairment?
 The impairment. Oh, it's resentment, isn't it? Yeah. If we refuse to feel our hurt, we
 move into resentment. Now ask me, what's the wrong with resentment?
 Alan, what's so wrong with resentment? Well, the major problem with resentment is when
 When we move in a resentment, we refuse to look at the internal focus of our pain and
 we move all of that focus on to external things.
 So it's the government's fault, it's the church's fault, it's the liberals fault,
 it's the conservatives fault.
 It's anything else other than what's going on in here.
 So it's really lonely to live with somebody in resentment, really hurtful to live with
 somebody in resentment, ironically.
 Resentment really denies the heart, it denies the humanity of feeling hurt.
 And if I'm in resentment and refusing to feel my pain, you better believe I'm not going
 to let you feel your pain.
 Right.
 And so I'm just not going to be a safe person to anybody who's in pain.
 Right.
 Because I'm going to be like, suck it up.
 You know, you think it's bad.
 Let me tell you what's going on.
 You know, let me tell you what I've overcome.
 And it's not about overcoming.
 It's about denial.
 Yeah.
 I used to do that actually.
 I have a funny story.
 Tell the story.
 Tell the story.
 Well, I remember, you know, I remember going with, we brought our whole youth group to go
 go and see Titanic, which questionable decision right there anyway.
 But anyway, we brought the whole youth group to go see this movie.
 And at one point during the movie, you know, there's like 18 of us were all in a row
 and everybody starts crying.
 Well, during this season of my life, I didn't feel any emotions.
 Like everything was just locked down, you know?
 And so anyway, people start boo-hooing about the movie.
 Describe boo-hooing.
 You know people are openly weeping and crying and emoting you know emoting at the movie and
 an I lean forward and and yell down the row. Oh
 Suck it up with you. It's a movie
 That was one of my banner moments as a youth leader a day bringing course correction to the youth of Canada
 My my story was with
 Like not feeling my own hurt was a ji and I went away
 We've got some dear friends called Chester and Betsy Kiltra.
 They run a ministry called restoring the foundations
 of very, very powerful ministry,
 work on the inner parts of your heart.
 And so we're with them, we went away
 for like six, seven days of intense ministry.
  </li><li>It was supposed to be five, but they kept extending it.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>Yes, yes they did.
 Yeah, I need to go back to them and go like,
 oh yes, yeah, so sorry about that.
  </li><li>Right, yeah.
  </li><li>And we're with them and at one point,
 we're doing like one-on-one therapy or two-on-one.
 It's Chester and Betsy in the same room with me.
 And at one point, Chester basically just kind of kicks back
 on his chair and just says, "Well, Alan,
 "I guess congratulations are in order."
 And I'm like, "Well, why is that?"
 And he's like, "Well, you've matured yourself
 "to the point where you no longer need Jesus."
 And I'm like, "Oh my God."
 "I beg your pardon?"
 He's like, "Well, Jesus said that he came
 "to heal the broken heart and bind up those
 to a crushed in spirit and wow, you don't even feel hurt.
 So like there's just no need for him in your life.
 And so I know he's joking, but I'm back pedaling
 to try and defend myself and like talk about what,
 you know, like what are you talking about?
 And he's like, well, scripture encourages us
 to pour out our lament to the Lord.
 And it sounds like you just don't have any negative feelings.
 You don't have any hurts.
 And honestly in that moment, I was thinking, yeah,
 because to have a negative emotion
 means that you're spiritually weak,
 To allow yourself to be hurt by somebody means you haven't spiritually matured.
 Now that I'm a spiritual giant, I can allow myself to belittle myself by feeling some
 sort of negative emotion by this mere human who's hurt me.
 Behold the man of God.
 So that was a wake up call for me.
 Now of course in my head I didn't think I have matured out of my need for Jesus.
 the way I was living my life was saying that as such.
 It's like, it's okay, God.
 I don't know.
 I got this.
 I got this.
 I wither the storm.
 Watch this.
 Kevlar.
 Tevflon.
 Right.
 All this hurt just bounces off me and it just simply wasn't true at all.
 Now, consider the irony of that.
 I'm a people helper.
 I'm a pastor.
 I'm supposed to sit with the broken hearted.
 If I'm not willing to face my own pain in my own broken heart, how can I possibly offer
 anything of care or compassion or or
 Encouragement to people who are broken. Yeah, my advice is just gonna be hey suck it up like here's some verses take two a day
 You'll be fine. Yeah a verse Band-Aid here you go. Mm-hmm. Yeah
 I think isn't resentment just old pain that we've never dealt with and just it leads us to distrust others. Oh
 Absolutely sometimes resentment is there because we are unhappy with the way life is turned out
 Right and so we've got this idea of what life should look like and then we're angry at everybody else or angry at God or angry at ourselves
 That our experience isn't matching up to what we demand that it would be and that can lead us to resentment
 Where we're not we're not engaging with the life we have because we're demanding a life
 We don't have the Bible puts it this way this this is probably I say this about every verse
 I was gonna say this is probably one of my favorite verses the Bible
 It's true is really is one of my favorite verses, but it's so powerful
 This is Proverbs 19 verse 3 and it says this,
 "People ruin their lives by their own foolishness
 and are then angry at the Lord."
 Ugh.
 Let me read that again.
 "People ruin their lives by their own foolishness
 and then are angry at the Lord."
 The Bible is just talking about this whole resentment.
 I can think of so many times in my own life
 when I've resented God because his prophetic words
 didn't come a pass or this thing that, you know,
 this promise that he's said in Scripture.
 And by the way, I've been declaring, declaring and tithing and it hasn't come true.
 And now I'm not even a promise, maybe even just like a want that you didn't get.
 I'm angry at the Lord while refusing to take any responsibility for the choices that I have made.
 Some of those choices are directly about refusing to admit that I'm hurt.
 And so resentment is something we really, really want to move out of.
 I love the bit in Chip's book where he says this, "vulnerability to hurt initiates a bomb for your
 pain, willingness to surrender to your pain begins healing.
 In admitting pain and reaching for help, you find healing.
 However, you need to reach to those who know the experience of hurt and healing
 themselves, not those in denial.
 Yeah, thanks, Chip.
 Ouch.
 I would have been one of the people totally in denial.
 And that that's a key thing.
 Like a lot of the questions we've had when we've done our Instagram lives is
 like, how do I feel my feelings?
 And my encouragement is like start with you in the Lord.
 Psalm 139 says this beautiful thing about search me,
 oh God, know my heart.
 Like if you will do that,
 the Holy Spirit will be so good at coming alongside you
 and knowing your heart, leading you into what you're feeling,
 even if you're not yet aware of that's what you're feeling.
 One of the most damaging things you could do
 is start being vulnerable with all this feelings work
 with those who've not done any feelings work.
 Because if they don't have a value for it in their own life,
 they're certainly not gonna value it in yours.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Yeah, I would definitely say if you're in a place where it's hard for you to identify
 what you're feeling or what your needs are, stillness is one of your best tools for that.
 And just literally setting aside time to ask the Lord because he actually knows your heart
 better than you do, you know, and have a conversation.
 I often, if I feel stuck, will put on soaking music and just connect with the Lord and then
 I start to feel the things that I've been running from,
 but I can start to have a conversation.
  </li><li>You know the problem with asking the Holy Spirit
 to help you know what's going on in your heart?
  </li><li>He helps you know what's going on with your heart?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You can't run at that point.
  </li><li>Like my favorite recent time is that,
 is I'm in the pantry and I'm scanning the shelves.
 And the Holy Spirit's like, are you hungry,
 or are you lonely?
  </li><li>He's like, "Ah!"
  </li><li>And I was like, "Can't hear you when I'm eating Doritos."
 (laughing)
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, no, my feelings take delicious.
 My feelings are crunchy and spicy.
 (laughing)
 Well anyway, that's our first feeling.
 It's hurt.
 The gift of hurt is if we feel our hurt,
 we discover healing and our courage
 to begin the journey to healing.
 If we don't feel our hurt,
 we're gonna end up in resentment,
 and everybody else's, you know,
 all the feelings of resentment
 are gonna come out sideways,
 which makes us not fun to be around.
 And so, yeah, practice feeling your feelings.
