<p> I live in a j's podcast for your monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones
 Mr. Lounge Lizard.<br/>
 Why am I a lounge lizard?<br/>
 Because you're laying back in your chair.
 Well, I've got the luxury of lying back.
 Why not take it?<br/>
 That's right.<br/>
 As Confucius once said, why stand when you can sit and why sit when you can lie.
 Is that true?<br/>
 Well, it's a true premise.<br/>
 I don't Confucius said that on that topic.
 follow up from last week when i talked about my break dancing name yes being
 vault here yes several people when he's a french philosopher not a marker
 yes which i'm aware of but as a nine ten year old i wasn't familiar with
 french philosophy but i was familiar with the big
 sharpie esque brand called the vault here which i did a google search for
 and good lord am i still talking about this you bet
 okay<br/>
 welcome to keeping up with jones's welcome
 I must say hi to Lindsay from Texas.<br/>
 Who's Lindsay from Texas?<br/>
 I was sitting at the factory.<br/>
 We were having a meeting.<br/>
 I think we were waiting on some people come.
 You went to get some coffee and last week and Lindsay came up and said, hi,
 I just want to say it.<br/>
 I listened to your podcast and I thought that was very sweet.
 So I thought I want to say hi back to her.
 I also ran into a gentleman in the factory who said hello, but I don't think he
 gave me his name.<br/>
 I think he just had hi and then he walked away.
 So high, random gentleman from the factory.
 Did he mention listening to the vodcast?
 He did.<br/>
 Oh, I see.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 I was wondering where that story had similar ideas.
 He was like, hi, you don't know me, but you know, anyway, that's always fun because it is a, it is a somewhat weird phenomenon because here we are recording with nobody listening.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then we put out on the internet and our, our server says many of you listened, but we don't know many of you.
 I mean, we know many of you anyway.<br/>
 In fact, most of our conversations with our friends go something like, "Oh yeah, this happened."
 They're like, "Yeah, we know we already listened to your podcast."
 -We probably have to ban our friends from listening and then we can have normal relationships.
 -Right. Do you know I was happy about this week?
 -What were you happy about this week?<br/>
 -I was happy because Comcast came and finally gave us decent internet.
 -Yes.<br/>
 -The story is the house that we moved to is only served by Comcast. You can't get internet
 from anybody else. So that made it simple. I was sad to say goodbye to AT&amp;T or last acts because
 we had gigapower which is fiber optic to the house, side of the house and then a thousand
 megawits a second down and up which was awesome. It was no, it happened.
 I mean, yeah, I mean, I used it all the time. How good he was I about that.
 You were on a giddiness scale of one to 10, probably 48. Yeah. And so moving here, Comcast
 are the only people who provide, right? Now, lots of people have bad things to say about
 Comcast, but I literally have never had a bad experience with them. People have always dealt
 with have always been very nice. And this instance was no different. They've just started rolling
 out again, a thousand megabits a second. And the tech guy who came out, this was his second
 ever install of that particular one he'd done plenty other. So he let me tag along and he let
 me ask all these questions and explained everything he was doing. And so now we have really fast
 internet and I'm very happy.<br/>
 And you just like to be cutting edge, probably made you happy that you were the second install
 ever for calm cast in all honesty.<br/>
 I didn't realize calm cast was just rolling out.
 There's only two markets have rolled out Austin and Nashville.
 And I didn't realize it was like a week or two old.
 I thought they'd been doing it.<br/>
 So I had it.<br/>
 I doubt there's too many people are going to be interested by saying next,
 but I got new wireless routers.<br/>
 Wow.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 I know.<br/>
 If you're interested, reach out to me on Twitter.
 I'll tell you all about them.<br/>
 You know, I'm not going to be reaching out to you.
 I don't know.<br/>
 I don't even care.<br/>
 It's meant to.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Tell me about the highlight of your week.
 The highlight of my week.<br/>
 Well, well, I have a sad thing.<br/>
 How can that be a highlight?<br/>
 How can that be an answer?<br/>
 It's not a highlight.<br/>
 It's a sad light.<br/>
 My coffee machine is not working.<br/>
 And what did you do to it?<br/>
 I did not do anything.<br/>
 I returned from being away on a weekend thing and it is not working.
 And I tried to do all kinds of different things like run vinegar through it and such.
 Well, did you try to scaling it?<br/>
 Yes. With vinegar or the approved solution?
 I don't have the approved solution, but it's not a descaling thing.
 It's not showing the descaling sign. It's showing the wrench.
 Yeah. Well, I'll hit it with a wrench and see what happens.
 No, it doesn't. That's what you're supposed to do.
 Okay. Yeah.<br/>
 Why don't you become a proper coffee person and do pour-overs?
 Apparently it only takes 42 minutes to make a cup of coffee.
 I know, right.<br/>
 And some wings do.<br/>
 You measure in this.<br/>
 I don't have that kind of time in the morning.
 Can you imagine kids just leave me alone?
 I need 20 minutes to make my cup of coffee.
 Yes, not going to happen.<br/>
 I had a dental appointment this week.<br/>
 You did tell us about that.<br/>
 So I'm currently getting all my amalgam fillings removed out of my teeth
 because as my dentist said, he said, sort of, they've been in there for quite a
 long time and with no disrespect to the land of your father's, it's not known for
 his great dental work.<br/>
 So that means I have to sit in a dentist chair for several hours as they drill
 out the amalgam fillings, clean it all out, patch up any decay that might be hidden
 by those 30-year-old fillings. And then they make a temporary, it's not really crown,
 I think they call it a partial crown, an onlay. And then that takes a good couple hours,
 then I go away and about two weeks later I come back and they replace the onlay with an
 official one. But anyway, I have a wife. Yes, you do. But anyway, I have a mouthful of white,
 rather than a mouthful of amalgam. Oh, you will have. Yeah. So I roll up on Friday,
 ready for my appointment. I'm not nervous. I'm just a little anxious because you just sit there
 for three hours and somebody drills in your face and then your face is numb for the rest of
 day and blah, blah, blah. So I think I'm going to be late by a couple of minutes. So I call Kelsey
 at the dentist. They call see him at town. I'm on my way. The rain is terrible. I should be a couple
 minutes late and she says for what and I said for my appointment.
 So just hold on so she I can hear typing.
 She's like, well, the good news is that you're really early and I said, for what?
 She said your appointment that's in a month's time.
 So I showed up a month early for my appointment.
 So you didn't actually even make it there?
 No, I just said, OK, turn around and I've you.
 I've picked up something from Craigslist.
 Let's talk about the craigslist list, King.
 Oh, I love that title.<br/>
 Yes, I'm like a pirate finding treasure.
 You are.<br/>
 Yeah, you are.<br/>
 You, you're finding some pretty, some pretty fantastic things.
 Well, I'm not really doing much.<br/>
 I have this really fancy app that allows you to put in search queries and it'll notify you by email anytime anything posts of vague interest, the keyword you put in.
 Oh, so it just I was wondering how you were managing to find these things.
 Yeah, it's great.<br/>
 So the great thing about living in Franklin is we earn the downstream from some very wealthy suburbs.
 So people throw out, or not throw out, but sell at a ridiculous price point, stuff that costs way,
 way, way, way more. So if you just pay close attention, you can pick up some great deals,
 which is what I did instead of going to the dentist.
 Yep.<br/>
 Anything else happened this week?<br/>
 Well, I mean, every week is a good week.
 It seems like it seems like we say the same thing every week.
 We met with amazing people, which we did.
 Yep.<br/>
 And we're gearing up for school.<br/>
 We're doing some training with our small group leaders
 and just getting ready.<br/>
 So that's pretty exciting.<br/>
 And you spoke at legacy tonight.<br/>
 What did you speak on?<br/>
 I spoke on feelings, nothing more than feelings.
 Don't sing.<br/>
 Feeling.<br/>
 OK, you're so predictable.<br/>
 Nothing, boy.<br/>
 Lyle and Allison Phillips, our friends,
 run a church called Legacy Nashville.<br/>
 And they have just finished a series on relationships.
 I was the last person now.<br/>
 And I talked about feelings as being something that can help
 or hinder your relationships.
</p><ul>
  <li>That's great.
  </li><li>Well, I hope it was.
 They're quite funny because I don't know that audience
 and I'm sure many of them don't know me.
 I was trying to work out whether I was making a good
 impression or bad impression.
 (both laughing)
 And you weren't there to help me.
  </li><li>No, they didn't egg you or anything.
  </li><li>Nope, no, my targe runs flash.
 Well, so you must have been okay.
 So our main topic is actually the power of words.
  </li><li>Ooh.
  </li><li>Ooh.
 And, you know, Jeff has been doing a series
 on the power of words and he has been absolutely killing it.
  </li><li>He really has.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And drawing out stuff that I haven't ever thought of before,
 you know, on that topic.
 So you and I have probably heard a lot of sermons
 the power of words from a negative standpoint, like what negative words do.
 And that's true. We've taught a bunch on the power of your words, curses and all that sort of.
 Sure, sure. But he is almost entirely focusing on positive words and basically
 declarations and the promises of God and knowing what's coming out of your face and that kind of
 stuff. And so it's been super, super good and very tweet-worthy.
 I mean, we just you're getting tweet after tweet after tweet.
 I've listed a bunch of the tweets that I wrote down this week and last as a kind of a memory reminder.
 That's how it take notes pretty much now is I just tweet stuff out and I thought we could talk about the tweets or if you can think of any others.
 Your memory is probably going to be better than mine.
 Well, I love this first one that you wrote down words are heavens instruments for creativity.
 That was basically him talking about Genesis 1 with our world being created by God speaking
 it into existence.
 And Jeff was talking about the premise that we create the world we live in by the words
 that we're saying.
 Yeah, which is totally true.
 Right.
 He was also talking about how worlds and stars and everything are still being created.
 God is still speaking and things are being created, which was pretty cool.
 I was thinking I had a dream.
 I forget when I had a dream.
 number of years ago and in the dream, the Holy Spirit said to me, "Your present circumstances
 reveal your prior thinking."
 Right.
 And that whole thing that we've been pondering a lot about, that you're living right now
 in your expectation of yesterday.
 And if your expectation was there, you've probably spoken according to your expectation.
 So Jeff is just challenging us.
 Why don't you think bigger and speak towards your future as described in Scripture?
 Yeah.
 It's just so profound.
 Yeah, it's a really, really unlikely that you would be thinking something and it
 doesn't make its way out of your face.
 Right.
 Cause Jesus said out the overflow of the heart, the mouth speaks.
 Right.
 So it's a good indicator to understand your level of expectation of faith by having
 people tell you what they hear you say.
 You know, we have a friend called Will and Will lived in England.
 that she's moved back to England.
 And so when Will was moving out to Nashville,
 Will Kim did our school last year,
 I was helping him with his visa stuff,
 just talking through the visa process.
 And I was talking about some of the pitfalls to think of
 and what struck me by Will and his positivity was
 never once did he side with a negative outcome.
 He always sided with a positive outcome
 and it just struck me and I just thought
 that is incredible.
 And it struck me because
 I think I've been trained to think about negative options
 and how we'd be prepared for them.
  </li><li>Right, and that seems like wisdom, isn't it?
  </li><li>But Will's point was, we don't know,
 for example, I was saying,
 "Hey, your entry to the United States is largely dependent
 "on the agent that you get when you get to customs
 "and border patrol."
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And so, and he's like, "Oh, well, that's great.
 "I'm gonna get an amazing agent."
 And I was thinking, you don't know
 you're gonna get an amazing agent,
 but he could equally retort.
 Well, you don't know I'm not right.
 And it never entered his head that you'd have any difficulties.
 And guess what?
 He never had any difficulties.
 So just it was so refreshing.
 We've got a bunch of friends like that.
 And I'm trying to be like that who just have this positive expectation.
 And they're surrounded by that in their words.
 And I love it.
 We've been watching MJ just loves finding name.
 Well, he must watch it two or three times a day.
 Yeah.
 And of course, of course, Dory is relentlessly optimistic.
 Yes.
 and there's a brilliant bit when they're all caught in the whale, and the whale swallows them.
 And he's like, "The water's going down, look, it's half empty." She's like, "Oh, funny, it looked
 half full." And there's just this back and forth of his negative view and her positive view.
 And as Gary says, "War is a great misuse of imagination." I just think about how much effort
 we sincerely plan negative thinking, and it seems folly to think positively. But why not flip it?
 Right. Running worst case scenario all the time in the back of your head and then planning
 for worst case scenario and then not being surprised that we get worst case scenario.
 Well, of course you do. All your effort is headed in that direction.
 Jeff said this. He said, "Our lives are molded by the messages we allow ourselves to hear."
 Talking about our upbringing and not talking about today. What you choose to hear about yourself
 That's so important.
 Yeah.
 And he did spend some time as well reiterating from some teaching that he did a couple of
 months ago about the difference between hearing and listening.
 Right.
 Be careful how you hear.
 Yeah.
 Be careful how you hear.
 I loved when he said today, he said, "Don't believe in the power of the enemy more than
 the promises of the Lord."
 Boom.
 And then he turned it around and he said, "Ask yourself, you know, the next time you're
 Am I believing in the power of the enemy more than in the promises of the Lord?"
 And I thought, "Oh, I was really struck by that.
 Like, "Oh, I hope I'm not, but I feel like a challenge to chat with God about that."
 Well, he was talking all about in numbers the 12 spies that go out and look at the promised land.
 Yeah.
 And they come back and they, you know, the story, they all bring a bad report and the two of them don't.
 And his point was what destinies do we talk God out of because of our unbelief and negative reports?
 And when Graham Cook was here, he said, God meets us with who we are, we meet him with who we're not.
 And this whole premise that our biggest challenge in life is actually believing God.
 And then living according to what he's already said.
 I'm so determined to do that.
 I think that's what I've loved about Listen to Jeff last couple of weeks.
 filled with applicable optimism. Yeah, for sure. Like when he's speaking, you can tangibly sense
 change coming. Yeah. Oh, and the atmosphere feels like excited about the future, which is lovely.
 How about this line that he said, the words that we speak are connected to the mindset we have.
 We talked about that a little bit earlier, but that's even more interesting when it comes to
 Proverbs 18 verse 21 death and life are in the power of the tongue and those who love it will eat its fruits.
 That whole thing of actually you get to decide what kind of life you're going to have an amazing life full of life or a sucky life full of death.
 Right.
 We're just like, you know what?
 Life is difficult.
 Life is hard.
 And you speak out the reality that you're going to live in.
 Yes.
 And I think it's hard.
 I think that cycle is difficult really because to a person who their expectation is aligned.
 with negative things happening. And maybe some of that is because of past experience
 and they're continuing to experience it because they're continuing to claim it and make that
 their world. It's hard to convince that person, "Hey, actually, your words are what's perpetuating
 this." You may not have had your first negative experience as a result of your words, but
 as you keep aligning your expectation with negativity and you keep aligning your words
 with that, you're actually creating a negative environment where all you can possibly receive
 back is negative.
 Just terrifying.
 Yeah.
 So it's like you need a total reboot, you know, of how you're thinking and what's going
 on in your heart and whatever and being able to trust God for good things.
 Well, here's something interesting about what you just said, because what you just
 said is the bulk of our teaching thus far.
 Right.
 stop saying negative things. But Jeff quotes Steve Backlund from, I mean,
 Bethel in Reading, California, he said, eliminating wrong words does not create life.
 Life is released by words that are in agreement with God. And Jeff went on to say,
 it's not enough to not be negative. Right. But you can't just sit there like,
 I'm just not going to say anything then. Well, but that's, I think that's been the sum total of our
 efforts is I'm not going to be negative. But Jeff is like, actually, you have to go one step further,
 have to be positive. Our thoughts, our words and our lives must output positivity. It's
 so life giving. Yeah, it's really cool. I just think, gosh, what
 different is that going to make for our kids? For everybody that you come around, if we could say
 positive things, I think it just creates a much better environment for everything.
 I was thinking about when Patricia King was here a number of years ago. We haven't
 I haven't talked about this on the podcast, I don't think.
 I talked about it last time I spoke at Grace Center
 and I felt super self-conscious.
 So if I can be super self-conscious in front of those guys,
 I can be super self-conscious here.
 But when Patricia was here last at Grace Center,
 she gave Grace Center a word
 and I actually tracked down the word on YouTube.
 It's not the time she was at Grace Center speaking it.
 It was some other time on her video channel,
 she was giving it's the same word that I'll put a link
 in the show notes.
 But she gave us four prophetic words
 for the season we were in
 And they were so life-giving.
 They're taken from four different verses.
 I'll let you listen to the word if you want.
 But basically, she gave us these four prophetic words,
 me and you took them home.
 We wrote them down, we wrote them on our mirror,
 we wrote them on our phones, we wrote them everywhere.
 And we just started declaring them.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>These were the four words,
 and they give us so much hope and optimism.
 Number one, you can smile at your future.
 I love that.
 So we've just started saying, I can smile at my future.
 I'm smiling at my future.
 Whenever we're faced with negative things.
  </li><li>Yeah, or uncertain things.
  </li><li>We would just say it and I'll smell it in my future.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then the second one was,
 you're facing seven years of great abundance.
 But I mean, try and tell me that's not more,
 what's more optimistic than that?
 Well, maybe eight years or nine years is more optimistic.
 But what if there's no end date on that?
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>What if every year is the start of seven years
 of great abundance?
  </li><li>What if it's dog years?
  </li><li>Oh, I like where you're at.
  </li><li>Does that work or does that go backwards?
  </li><li>Does that mean we have to get a puppy?
 No.
 Okay.
 I will greatly bless your seed and you will reap a hundred fold in one year.
 Yeah.
 So we wrote out all these words and that's from Proverbs 31, 25, Genesis 41, 29, Genesis
 22, 17 and Genesis 26 verses 12 and 13.
 So we wrote those out and it wasn't enough to not be negative about those words.
 I mean, there was a negative pushback from those words like, Oh, I can't believe that.
 you know, that's ridiculous. Oh, it's not enough to just be neutral about it. You actually have
 to be positive about it. Right. And so we found ourselves challenging one another to stop our
 negativity, but not just that, but move to the opposite spirit. So that whole thing about,
 I will greatly bless your seed. That word is useless if you don't give the Lord seed to bless.
 Right. Right. True. Yes.
 So we decided, well, actually, if that word is true and we believe it's to be true,
 out of our lack, we decided to sow seed. Do you remember that?
 Yeah, I do remember.
 Do you want to tell that story?
 Well, I think around the time that Patricia was there, I can't remember what it is for,
 but for some reason, we were expecting a check for $2,000.
 Right.
 And you know, the truth is that's a useful amount of money for doing things like paying off debts or
 you know buying your children clothes buying your children clothes that kind of thing for school or childcare, right?
 Um, but after we heard Patricia's prophetic word, um, we just thought okay, well
 let's let's sew, you know, so we sewed a thousand dollars of it right and we got that number because
 Well, we got that number because it just popped in our head and we were like, holy moly, that's half of that.
 And that huge.
 Yeah, I was like, I'm prepared to give 10%, which is $200, which feels big.
 Now we're giving away $1,000.
 But I thought, actually, it wasn't so much of a fight because I was so filled with optimism about this.
 Right.
 I was like, you know what?
 What's the worst that can happen?
 We don't deserve this $2,000 that's coming anyway.
 It's coming as a gift.
 So let's give some of it away.
 Yeah. So we decided to give away a thousand dollars and please, please, for the love of all
 it's holy. The reason I feel self-conscious talking about this is, A, nobody talks about money,
 B, the point of this story isn't that we gave away a thousand dollars.
 And it's not a method. No. But that, well, it's kind of a method, though.
 It is a bit of a method. We're teaching a method. We're talking about, actually,
 you have to be positive, you have to speak positive.
 But it's not about the amount of money, it's about obedience.
 Correct. Yeah.
 So we gave that away, that felt great. Tell you what didn't feel great is when unexpected bills showed up that we could have done with a thousand dollars.
 But then we had an opportunity to not be negative and just say, I can smile at my future.
 Yep.
 And actually practice like these baby steps of no, I'm going to be positive. I'm going to be positive.
 Yeah.
 Do you know what was funny?
 Well, it was funny.
 Well, was at the end of the year we hadn't reaped a hundred fold.
 No, we hadn't.
 And so we're like, oh, the guest Patricia King is a false prophet.
 We didn't say that.
 No, of course we didn't.
 But what I'm saying is you have an opportunity when it doesn't look like things are passing out your way to jump to negativity, to jump to blame, to jump to criticism, to fill in what we don't understand with what we think we understand.
 Right.
 It's so dangerous to do that.
 Yes.
 All right.
 Let me clarify.
 Patricia King is not a false prophet.
 She's an amazing prophet and she's a dear friend of ours.
 And as somebody we greatly respect, I was being very flippant and I hope that is cleared that part up.
 But what we did do at the end of the year was go okay we didn't reap a hundred fold in a year,
 but Lord we're choosing to believe that we can smell our future and here's the thing.
 Goddess so I mean God's already.
 Is ludicrous to say God you owe me anything when he's given us Jesus Christ of course so that that's not even a debate I just try to never ever say Lord you owe me because that's that's pitiful and that's going to be embarrassing on the day of judgment when I'm welcome to paradise.
 Right.
 Right.
 So that's not even up for, it's just like, you know what, God?
 I'll let you figure that stuff out.
 So then fast forward two years, three years.
 It's been two.
 Two years.
 We move into this house and we just love this house when we think it's amazing.
 And somebody, we're telling stories to somebody about how we're moving house and it dawns
 on me.
 So with regards to our old house, we bought our house and three years later we sold it
 And guess what the equity was that we had in the house by the time we moved out?
 Ooh, ooh, ask me, ask me.
 Canadian in the corner.
 Oh, 100,000 dollars.
 And so we, I mean, we weren't thinking of selling the house.
 We weren't thinking of moving house.
 There was no real reason to do that.
 And the last time I checked all the houses in the neighborhood that were
 competing with ours hadn't sold ours was the only one that sold sold in a day.
 Yeah.
 And I just think, Lord, you're amazing.
 There's no reason our house should have gone up a hundred
 grand in value.
 No, but there really isn't.
 No, that's just astonishing.
 And I look back on that and just say, Lord, I think that's
 directly attributed not only to giving a thousand dollars and
 getting a hundred thousand in return.
 You literally reaping a hundred fold.
 Right.
 But also our declarations are speaking out with those things.
 Now, I have to say that the old Alan has having some struggles even telling that story and even
 saying that because it sounds... Oh, baby, you're not old. You're just, you know, you're young and
 vigorous. I'm just going with positive. Oh, yes. That's right. We're speaking positively.
 But... Previous Alan. I think the previous Alan didn't have a grid for this.
 I think in a previous season of my life, I would have struggled with these concepts because
 This is how life should work. You work hard and you eat out a good life for you and that's how it works.
 Right.
 Whereas this sounds too fanciful to be true.
 Right.
 And I think I would probably say, well, you know, I've given in the past and that never happened.
 So that's ridiculous.
 But I think I would challenge myself by saying, yeah, but when you gave in the past, did you give out of duty or did you give out of expectation?
 Right.
 Did you partner with faith or did you partner with this is what I have to do?
 I mean, I totally hear what you're saying and I'm not trying to throw wrench in it or anything like that.
 But I also think even when I was giving out of duty, I saw God's faithfulness because you're giving out of obedience, even if it's, you know, even if I didn't necessarily have a level of faith associated with giving.
 Right.
 But I would say the more that I got good at giving the more faith that I had,
 that I was entering into something that was of the kingdom that I didn't fully
 understand.
 Well, we just have some friends and I assume this is okay to share because
 they shared it publicly at Grace Center.
 But we have some friends who just have this amazing testimony of
 they just bought a house.
 They were in a two bedroom condo with five people.
 And they were just asking God for a new house.
 It sounded like like five adults.
 Well, no, it was two adults and two adults in their three sons and their three sons.
 That's still a lot.
 Yeah.
 Got it.
 But the point was they were saying we wanted a new house, but never believed we could.
 Yeah, because let's be practical.
 I mean, they just sided with logic and that's be practical.
 And yet what they realized coming out of their faces wasn't practicality, but it was
 negativity.
 Right.
 And so God bless them. I love these guys are so they're so diligent.
 They just were going to do a belief audit and realize we're believing a bunch of nonsense.
 And so just ask the Lord for some new beliefs.
 And he gave them the beliefs before they ever got the provision.
 That's an important part.
 They felt like they should believe God for a house without any of the provision for the house.
 And as they moved towards getting a house, the Lord provided the provisions.
 And my favorite part of this is they husband and wife were having a conversation saying,
 "We feel challenged to give more than our 10% tithe.
 Let's tithe 12%.
 And on the day that they decided we're going to tithe 12% and the day that they sent in
 their paycheck for 12%, they got three checks in the mail.
 They weren't expecting two to come quickly, but all two came plus a bonus one and the
 the bonus one was bigger than it was the biggest check of the lot.
 Wow.
 And so I just loved being a bystander watching their process of them declaring and then the
 fruit following.
 Yeah.
 I think we want the fruit before we'll follow.
 Yeah, I would say that's true.
 For sure.
 Well, can I finish with the last part that just blew my mind that Jeff was speaking about?
 Because here's the thing.
 the Jeff said we've heard before, but I had never heard it with his twist. So he was talking about
 the verses in James about the power of the tongue, you know how the tongue is really small but super
 powerful. Yeah. And so he was talking about, you know, the horses can be steered by a tiny bit and
 a large ship is steered by a small rudder. But then it goes on to about how a forest fire started
 by like just a tiny spark. And so I'd always lumped all three examples into the negative power of the
 the tongue. But his point was the first two is a horse and a large ship. And his point
 was both are directed or steered by something small. And in this case, the allegory is to
 the tongue. And Jeff's mic drop moment was the course of your life is determined by the
 words that you speak. Now it sounds too new agey, but it's straight out of the Bible.
 I don't think it sounds new agey. Oh, come on. Maybe it's just my brethren roots springing
 I mean, but it sounds like oh so what you're saying is you just speak positively and positive things will happen
 Yes, well the word of faith people they've been believing that for years, right?
 Well, and that's the thing I think everybody is so uncomfortable about anything getting close to the thing that we're raised in to believe was bad
 Right for me like my struggle moving into anything
 I couldn't get near any of the truth of the charismatic movement because I was warned about the excesses of the charismatic movement
 Yeah, I gotcha.
 Same with healing.
 You know, these people who say that they heal the sick blood.
 So you're resisting getting to the fruit because of the folly or the excesses of these movements.
 So I think it was amazing.
 I just thought, Lord, the course of my life is determined by the words I speak about my
 life.
 I is smart, I is kind, I is wonderful.
 I've good looking.
 I have the body of a Greek God.
 Yeah.
 Anyway, here listeners, what are you, what is the quality of the words that you speak
 about your own life?
 That's your challenge.
 What is the quality of your words regarding your future or your expectations?
 It's a good challenge.
 Thanks.
 I'm the challenge master.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Can you read out the listeners question?
 And I'll answer it.
 All right.
 We have a listeners question from Paige.
 Hit me with it.
 In one of your episodes, Alan spoke about this app that asks you questions and essentially
 talks you off of a ledge or helps you figure out how to get out of your funk.
 What was it?
 Oh, I probably don't have to say question mark.
 Please and thank you because I feel like I could use the app frequently this summer while
 living with my parents.
 Dear Patience, sorry.
 I'm glad you asked Paige because I actually in my sermon tonight when I was at Legacy
 Nashville I talked about this app.
 So the app is called Mood Notes.
 You can get it on the app store.
 It's a couple of bucks I think, but it's so worth it.
 Basically what happens is you open up the app and it asks you, "How are you?"
 And it has this little picture of a smiley face or a frowny face and you move your thumb
 up to make it happier and you move your thumb down to make it sadder.
 No matter where you put it, it then says,
 "Hey, what just happened
 "that could be contributing to your mood?"
 And just asking you to stop and reflect
 on why you're feeling, how you're feeling is so insightful.
 So you just write down,
 I don't know, my wife just shouted at me
 because she's super impatient and doesn't understand
 that I'm a creative person that likes
 to move slowly in the morning.
 And I need lots of sleep in the morning,
 which is why I don't get out of bed when I'm asked.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh, real life lessons.
  </li><li>Yeah. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And then ask you to pick some feelings
 and it gives you a list of positive and negative feelings
 and it's really funny, it's like a feeling chart.
 You just go down and go, am I feeling anxious?
 Am I feeling hopeful?
 Am I feeling, and you just grade yourself on how you're feeling.
 If you have some negative feelings,
 it then says, hey, here are some common traps
 regarding your thinking.
 These are some of the things that people fall into
 when they have a negative trigger.
 And you read through them and you think,
 Does that apply to me and you check them off?
 And then what it does is gives you some helpful feedback
 based on what you've checked off.
 And I find it amazing for deescalating any negative feelings.
 So it's called Mood Notes.
 I'll put a link in the show notes.
 It's a great app.
 I highly recommend it.
  </li><li>Perfect.
 Well, just to wrap up for today,
 we have our Heaven declares conference coming up
 in October on the 27th to the 29th.
 And we have Andy Squires will be leading worship and Lafe
 Hetland and Jamie Galloway are speaking.
 So we're super stoked about that.
  </li><li>That's gonna be an amazing conference.
  </li><li>Oh, it's gonna be so good.
 I can't wait.
  </li><li>Those guys are powerhouses.
  </li><li>They are, and they're fun.
 So I think it'll be great.
 If you want the show notes for this week,
 go ahead and head on over to alan and AJ.com/116.
 I can't believe we've done 116 of these.
  </li><li>It's amazing.
  </li><li>It's shocking.
 Yep. And if you want to ask us any questions, you can go ahead and shoot us your question
 at <a href="mailto:allen@aj.com">allen@aj.com</a>/ask and we will answer it on the air if we can.
 Thanks again for tuning in. We so appreciate it. We pray that you have an incredible week
 filled with rich revelations about how awesome your world is.
 Yeah, amen.
