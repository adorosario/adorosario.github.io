<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Mrs. Jones.<br/>
 Mr. Jones.<br/>
 Oh, it's so good to see you in a podcasting studio.
 It's been a while.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Welcome to episode 287 of Keeping It With The Joneses.
 We normally start with a weekly update.
 AJ, what's the problem with doing a weekly update
 on this episode?<br/>
 Well, I think the main problem is that it's probably
 been about four months since we've recorded a podcast.
 So a weekly update might not give all the information
 that is wanted or required.
</p><ul>
  <li>The other thing is, let's face facts.
 I'm not sure everybody wants a weekly update
 or a four monthly update.
 I think everyone wants to talk about another update,
 which we'll get to in a second.
 We are creatures who have it.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And having a weekly update for something
 like 280 odd episodes, it would feel,
 I would feel remiss if I didn't do it.
 If you don't wanna hear our update,
 use a little chapter marker to skip to this.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was gonna say, hey, you never know.
 People might wanna know like what we did on sabbatical,
 that sort of thing, so.
  </li><li>So let's make this not a weekly update,
 but a sabbatical update.
  </li><li>Okay, sabbatical update.
  </li><li>Quick reminder, we went on sabbatical end of June.
  </li><li>Yes. - Yes.
  </li><li>Literally four months of bad.
  </li><li>Yep.
  </li><li>Give us an update.
 If you remember, you had lost your voice,
 so now that you got your voice back, flex away my darling.
  </li><li>Well, my hope for sabbatical was that we were gonna be
 able to do an RV trip. That didn't happen. I still hope at some point we will do an RV trip.
 But as we were considering all the different options with the kids, while they had said they
 were excited about the RV trip, when it came down to it with presenting a number of different
 options, they resoundingly wanted to go back to Disney or just Disney kids.
 Well, we sat down with them and said, look, we could go to Toronto, we could go to New York City,
 We can get cabin in the woods, which looking back, that part of us.
 They were never going to go for it.
 Yeah, but we're going to get a lake house.
 Yeah.
 We could go RVing, which I hope they didn't pick because I didn't think we could afford to go RVing.
 Now having gone to Disney, I realize it's just as much money.
 I do think I tried to mention that, but we can move on.
 You lost your voice.
 I don't remember much of what you said in those days.
 Fair enough.
 I was surprised that they wanted to go to Disney because we'd been there literally a year before.
 Yes.
 And we did try telling that like yes, hey, and still they loved it.
 That's what they wanted.
 Yeah, we're not going to rehash our vacation to Disney.
 Yeah, because the truth is we did that on episode 248 up at Lincoln the show.
 Not much has changed.
 Well, there's a couple extra rides.
 Yeah, tell us about the extra rides.
 Well, uh, ratatouille, which is.
 Read me for a tattooie adventure.
 Yeah.
 Oh, I'm so sorry.
 Yep.
 And Epcot quite good.
 All kind of new technology.
 Lots of screens that kind of stuff, but just so good.
 And the guardians of the galaxy ride.
 What is it called? The, the
 it's called guardians of the galaxy cosmic rewind.
 Yes. Now I loved it.
 You did not.
 I don't do well with, I do well with going up and down and even upside down.
 I don't do well with spinning round and round like the teacups.
 And that is a free flowing roller coaster,
 meaning it does go up and down, but the seat that you're in also swivels,
 360 degrees. It does. So sometimes you're going backwards,
 sometimes forwards, often from side to side, and it's changing back.
 But we think we worked out why I didn't do well on it.
 Because I am tougher and less of a big chicken.
 No, I think because as they go along, they give you vantage points for your
 eyes to focus on and track. Like screens to watch part of the story.
 But it was so overstimulating for me.
 I wasn't sure what I was supposed to be looking at any point.
 Yeah.
 I just looked ahead and I think that just made me really.
 You were just looking at the tracks.
 I was pretty green when I got off it, but you and the kids loved it.
 Yeah, I did it twice.
 Yeah.
 Yep.
 Also, and I've got right next to that is the space 2020 restaurant, which is
 quite fun.
 A total ripoff.
 It's a total ripoff.
 A total ripoff.
 But it's a great idea.
 It is a great idea and very fun.
 But only if you ignore how much it costs for a family five.
 Yeah.
 Like the food was good.
 It still was not worth how expensive it was.
 No, but your own vacation, if it's an experience,
 it was a chance to die in space.
 Yes.
 There was lots of fun Easter eggs.
 There was something new about this trip to Disney
 that wasn't there last year.
 What?
 I can't even think what you're talking about.
 I got COVID.
 Oh, yeah.
 Having managed to escape COVID for two years.
 I got it at Disney World.
 Yeah.
 Got COVID.
 And I was, I got a single moment for three days at Disney.
 Yeah.
 Did you do three days?
 No, we took one day in the middle off and moved that day's passes to our final
 day that we were supposed to be resting before we drove so that we would
 hopefully get one extra day with you at the park.
 And thankfully it rained all day that day.
 So that worked out great.
 Yeah.
 We were just home and the thing with the version I got of COVID was the first
 three days I had COVID, I didn't know I had COVID.
 Like the first day I was like, I feel tired.
 And it's like, am I tired because I've just spent all day
 in the car and we're up early and we're packing.
 And you know, and then the second day I felt hot,
 but I'm in Florida and I've just walked around three parks
 on that one day.
 So do I feel hot and tired again, because I'm sick?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I took a test and there you go, I was positive.
 So we quickly rearranged and quarantined.
  </li><li>Quarantined you, but you know, we'd been riding in a car
 and all that together, but none of us got sick.
  </li><li>Six. - I tested negative on day six,
 I think, a quarantine for five days, day six,
 I was negative, so we all went back.
  </li><li>And we got three more days to Disney as a family.
  </li><li>Yeah, but COVID at the happiest place on Earth.
  </li><li>Yeah, sadness.
  </li><li>So yeah, that was our sabbatical.
 Good time with our kids. - Yep.
  </li><li>We did take our kids through the entirety
 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
  </li><li>Did we actually finish it?
  </li><li>Well, we didn't do any of the TV shows,
 but we did all the movies.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And there were some versions of movies,
 I had to download and edit quite considerably.
  </li><li>He like ripped them to the computer
 and then had to rip out everything that was like
 bad, demonic witchcraft.
 And then we had a much shorter version of some films.
  </li><li>Just a talk to you strange movies.
  </li><li>Well there.
  </li><li>And even then having edited those,
 I was like, yeah, that could have done with a second edit.
 But our kids are up to date on the Marvel Cinematic Universe
 just in time for Black Panther, what kind of forever.
  </li><li>The funniest part of those edited videos
 was when you would pause it and go, "Okay, so right now there would have been like a really
 bad scene where basically the only thing you need to know is this person's bad." And then there
 would have been this other scene where all you have to know is this person died. Okay, and now we
 pick up with the movie again. Anyway, it was very funny. But I know, and you know, and we all know
 that you didn't tune in to hear us talk about old news. You want to hear about new news? Well,
 Well, they might have.
 They might not know about new news.
 They might have just tuned in to hear.
  </li><li>I've had a couple of full paths
 where I've assumed that people have known our new news,
 but they haven't.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And the way of communicating it,
 you know, wasn't very gentle for their heart.
  </li><li>Right, because you think they know.
 So everybody might not know.
  </li><li>Tell everybody what you know.
  </li><li>Our new news is that we no longer work for Gray Center,
 which is both very sad and exciting.
 Strangely exciting. Yeah. Imagine you no longer work at the place that you love. Isn't that exciting?
 Wasn't the first thought that popped into my head? Yeah, but it is true. It's very sad because
 we, you know, love Grace Nair. We love the staff. We love the congregation. We loved what we did.
 We loved pouring into that group of people for nearly 14 years. Yeah. But it's also very
 exciting because we find ourselves presented with an opportunity that I'm not sure lots of people
 will get at the stage of the life, which is to not know what you're doing.
 The other side of that coin, quick, quick, quick, is to know
 new adventure as a plan.
 And there is a, you know, endless possibilities of what we might do, right?
 None of which we currently know.
 Well, yes, precisely.
 Is excitement the right word?
 Oh, it is like I do feel excited.
  </li><li>I do too.
 It's strange as a very high shaper
 and this having not been our plan to feel that way,
 but I do.
 I'm excited.
 I'm like, Lord, I know we're gonna get to do something awesome
 with you.
 I just don't know what it is.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think when you have an event like this,
 it's inherently disruptive.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Especially when you think about for our family,
 which has been very hard for our kids,
 is both mom and dad worked at the same place.
  </li><li>Yes.
 of the same place that we all worship as a family, which is also the same place that
 is the source of most of our relationships with friends. Almost all of our friendships,
 yep. And so to feel that upheaval and that disruption, you know, that has taken a toll.
 And probably as you're listening to this, and I don't want to shame you. But possibly
 the reason you're listening to this is you might be thinking, well, what happened? And
 who said, "What?"
 And what about this?
 And I heard that.
 And our simple response to all of that is to say,
 sincerely and quite honestly,
 there are no bad guys in this scenario, Taw.
  </li><li>Yeah, and we have tremendous love and appreciation
 for Gray Center and for the staff, Jeff and Becky.
 And yeah, so there isn't hard feelings or--
  </li><li>Or an axe to grind or a story to sell
 or anything like that.
 Yeah, we're in this fortunate position
 where we have actually left with wonderful relationships
 and a deep appreciation for what we,
 when I don't mean me and you,
 I mean, we as a staff accomplished in the last 10 or so years
 and just taking those memories with us,
 but also carrying those relationships
 into the future with us as two is something wonderful.
 'Cause you hear about people perhaps going through things
 like we've gone through and it being messy,
 it being ugly, there being bitterness on all sides.
 And we actually feel very, very content,
 knowing that God absolutely has good things ahead
 for Grace Center, has good things for Alan A.J.
 that there is blessing on both sides.
 And I'm sitting with the curiosity,
 the wonder, the joy, the possibilities
 of what God might have been up to.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And I think as I sort of think about things,
 if for myself, I so loved being at Grace Center.
 And I know we both did, love being at Grace Center,
 that I wonder, just in the back of my head,
 like if the Lord had said,
 hey, I have this other thing,
 how willing my heart would have been to hear that,
 just because I was Grace Center for Life.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so I think part of my excitement is like,
 okay God, like here we are in this whole new world
 where we really don't know what's next.
 I don't know if I would have been willing
 to consider being in this position.
  </li><li>Yep.
 but we are here and God's huge and so I'm fine.
 Do you know what I mean?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So. - I do not even,
 as much as it pains me, I have to be honest and go,
 what might you be able to say now
 that I wouldn't have been able to hear earlier?
  </li><li>Yeah, because I'd be going,
 well, don't wanna hear it
 because I want to stay at Grace's address.
  </li><li>Oh, absolutely.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I fully agree with you on that.
 So we find ourselves in this weird tension
 where on the one hand,
 we are sitting with lots of sadness and loss.
  </li><li>Tremendous sadness.
  </li><li>But intention with that,
 tremendous optimism and excitement.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And really the last couple of months
 I've been living within that tension.
  </li><li>Yes.
 And some days I'm more sad and other days I'm more optimistic.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think that's healthy.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I tell you what, that's new.
 Me holding those things in tension is new
 because I don't know why I know this is not true
 and I know this sounds ridiculous,
 but I've often thought that you can only hold one thing
 at a time.
  </li><li>Yes. - And I've learned that.
 That is not true. - Nope.
 Here we are, just living in tension.
  </li><li>So all that to say, now what, AJ?
  </li><li>Well, the truth is, (laughs)
 we don't know, but Gray Center again is a very generous church.
 We don't have to make a decision right away
 about what that looks like.
 And so we have, we've determined to take a couple months
 just to rest and hear the Lord and then we'll see.
 We just don't know.
  </li><li>Yeah, the truth is we don't know.
 And it is curious to be in the situation.
 Our median age is about 50.
 It's 49.5, I did the math earlier.
  </li><li>You did do.
  </li><li>But what I mean is not a lot of people get to enter
 this season of life with a fresh page waiting to be written.
  </li><li>Yes, true.
  </li><li>True, like I didn't think we'd ever have to consider this.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>Like you said, I thought it was gonna be great
 serving for life.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>So now there's this gift about like, okay God,
 what are you up, because nothing takes the Lord
 by surprise.
 What are you up to now?
 What are you up to now?
 Yeah.
 So if you have answers on a postcard, send me to us.
 That would be...
 We'd love to hear it.
 We are.
 We are currently praying and fasting and resting.
 Yes.
 And just inviting the Lord to say what He would like to say.
 Yes.
 I thought it would be fun.
 I don't know if this is going to be fun.
 I thought it would be interesting to answer the most frequently asked questions we've
 received in the news since it's been released that we no longer on staff at Grey Centre.
 Okay. I have a list for you. Okay. Okay. You ready? Yeah. The number one question on everyone's
 lips is why don't you guys work at Grayson anymore? Take it away, AJ.
 Well, I think that's probably best answered by actually watching Jeff explain it to the
 congregation. I will put a link in our show notes to Jeff announcing Artaparture where he frames
 why we are leaving Greyser and you can watch that.
 But essentially, what we know is that God's really good at positioning people where they
 need to be.
 And so we're just trusting that he's...
 But that's what's happening.
 That's what's happening.
 All right, question number two is, are you guys moving?
 We really hope we're not moving.
 We really, really hope we're not moving.
 However, we didn't see any of this coming.
 We don't know what the Lord has for us.
 And so as we're seeking God and we're trying to be open.
  </li><li>The way I like to say is we love living in Franklin, Tennessee.
  </li><li>We do.
  </li><li>And we don't wanna move.
  </li><li>We do not wanna move.
 The only place we wanna be more than Franklin, Tennessee
 is at the center of God's will.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So if a geographical shift is needed
 to stay in the center of God's will,
 then obviously we'd do that.
  </li><li>But our preference would be to stay here.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We've got chewy's, we've got Mexican.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>We've got time, we've got wherever we are.
 Also, great schools for our kids
 and established family norms.
  </li><li>And we love our house.
  </li><li>Yeah, we know all that.
  </li><li>But yeah, where we live is less important than--
  </li><li>Being in the center of God's story.
  </li><li>Being in the center of God's story.
 Another common question we get asked,
 which I actually really love this.
 Lots of people have asked this question.
 I think it's very sweet for them to inquire about,
 how are your kids?
  </li><li>They are much like us, you know,
 living in the tension, I think.
 I'm kind of hesitant to answer on their behalf.
 They have their good days and their bad days.
 It's been difficult.
  </li><li>I agree, yeah.
 I don't want to speak for my kids.
 I also want to protect the privacy,
 but I think you're right in general terms.
  </li><li>And we're trying to do our best to make it as easy
 as we can for them, make sure that they can talk
 about how they're feeling.
 And I am so thankful, Alan Jones,
 that you did all this feelings work years ago
 and then introduced me to it,
 introduced our family to it,
 because I honestly think we're being able to process
 what for the kids is very, very traumatic
 and it's been difficult for us as well
 in a much healthier way because we're comfortable
 feeling our emotions and able to talk about that
 without it feeling like, okay, enough emotion.
  </li><li>Yeah, or like that you have to hide that part
 of yourself or you're gonna get into trouble for it.
 Yeah, yeah.
 Yeah, I think I was surprised
 at what was most precious to the kids.
 Yeah.
 And again, I think credit where credit is due,
 our kids loved Grace Center.
 Yes.
 But it really do love the people,
 but love the building as well.
 That's what surprised me.
 Their emotional connection to the space was beautiful.
 Yeah.
 I thought it would be about like,
 oh, we're not gonna see our friends anymore.
 And I kind of felt a bit of shame when I realized,
 oh my gosh, I had a tribute such,
 not that that's shallow,
 but I thought that would be some total.
 But some of the values that were important to our kids,
 I just think reflects the beauty of the place
 that is Gray Center.
 And again, reflects the hearts of the brilliant people
 that we have leading Gray Center.
 I did last Sunday was the first time
 that we as a family went to a different church
 since we've been here.
 One of the fun things, sidebar,
 one of the fun things when we were on sabbatical
 is that you and I, we left the kids going to Gray Center.
 Thank you to everybody who made that happen for us.
  </li><li>Who helped to make that happen, yeah.
  </li><li>Thank you.
 But we would go to different churches.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>In just get a sense of what the body of Christ is like
 in Franklin, Tennessee.
 And it was beautiful.
 It was beautiful as me, both as a pastor
 and as a leader, but also as a person,
 a member of the larger body of Christ
 to go to different churches
 and see beautiful reflections of the body of Christ
 represented all over our city.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I mean, I think we've been to seven or eight different
 churches now and so many amazing bodies, like so many different churches that are doing amazing
 things. And I was super encouraged. I was like, wow, there's so many great churches here.
 But last week, we started that journey with our kids. So again, I don't want to keep over
 using the word excitement, but there was certainly curiosity, maybe touched excitement. For us as
 a family last week, going to a new church as a family and saying, like, you know, what did you
 What was your experience?
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>What was good?
  </li><li>Curiosity's probably a better word.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>To sum it up.
  </li><li>So, yes, our kids are feeling their feelings.
  </li><li>They're feeling their feelings,
 but they're gonna be okay.
  </li><li>Okay, another question.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Let's do with us more to do with Grace Aaron,
 kind of the stuff that, you know,
 what's happening to S.O.S.L.?
 School of Supernatural Life.
  </li><li>S.O.S.L. closed this summer,
 so it does not exist anymore, so nothing.
 (laughs)
 Nothing is happening to it.
 (both laugh)
 Yeah, episode of sale, as a thing has lived its season.
  </li><li>Yes. - I'll put Link in the show once again
 to Jeff telling the congregation about that.
  </li><li>Yep. - So you can hear his words
 around Esso sale and the values
 that are around the school and what's happening.
  </li><li>Yes. - Oh, this is a big one.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And I understand this.
 We haven't talked about this for a long time,
 but what's happening adoption-wise?
  </li><li>Well. - Wait, I'll answer that.
 A whole lot of nothing, a little bit of something
 and a whole lot of nothing.
 We have been able to put in our family
 for one or two situations.
 But it-- - Back up, back up, back up.
  </li><li>So it's just been real slow.
 And all the social workers that we have talked to
 and people at the different adoption agencies
 have all said, and maybe that's because of COVID,
 whatever, but it just slowed down everything
 really slowed to a halt in terms of just available
 situations to adopt.
 And then if you add to it, we're not the normal family
 that people are looking for.
 A lot of moms, birth moms are looking for,
 there's no other children in the home already,
 or younger parents.
  </li><li>Let me explain how it works.
 So we work with about five or six different adoption agencies.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And they all have their own little way of doing things.
 But basically a birth mom comes in and says,
 I'm looking for adoptive parents.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So they have their internal process.
 They either pick us to say, hey, would you like to be involved?
 Or they let us know the situation and we pray.
 But either way, a situation is presented.
 And not a lot of those situations have been presented
 over the last year.
  </li><li>Well, no, not a lot.
 And then that mom also can, in the very beginning,
 have some preferences.
  </li><li>Have some preferences.
  </li><li>So. - Which rules us out for a love.
  </li><li>We get ruled out of most of them.
  </li><li>Yes. - Yes.
  </li><li>We don't want a religious family.
 I'm so sorry.
  </li><li>We're like, we can't do that.
  </li><li>We only want kids in the family who are also adopted.
  </li><li>Yes, or no other children. - Or no kids.
  </li><li>Or no more than two children.
  </li><li>So there's lots of things where we can't apply for.
  </li><li>Or there must be a dog in the house.
 Yes, that was one too.
 So there's--
  </li><li>So we thought about getting a dog.
  </li><li>We thought about getting a dog.
  </li><li>And then we thought there's so much change in our life
 right now that we wanted.
  </li><li>We did not.
  </li><li>But then the ones that we have been eligible to apply for,
 there haven't been an awful lot of those,
 but when we have applied for them, we didn't get picked.
  </li><li>Well, and usually those situations are those moms,
 and I can't imagine how difficult it is.
 are being presented with 15 families to choose from.
 So yeah, we have not been picked.
  </li><li>We have not been picked.
 But one of the things that was probably our first concern
 on hearing that we were in the long
 we were working at a Grace Center is how does that affect
 our adoption status?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But we spoke to our social worker
 and formed of what happened in more cases.
 And they've reviewed our file and they're like,
 it's not a threat or a challenge.
  </li><li>Yeah, you're still eligible.
 We've just updated our home study for another year.
  </li><li>Just renewed all our paperwork and our fingerprints.
  </li><li>Yeah, and so-- - Why do we renew our fingerprints,
 given our fingerprints don't change?
  </li><li>For the same as they were, I know.
  </li><li>But that's a redo background checks,
 but we're still in the running--
  </li><li>Yes, so pray for us, we're hopeful,
 and right now we're at home, so it's great timing.
  </li><li>One of my favorite questions?
  </li><li>Yes. - This is the last question.
  </li><li>Oh, okay. - It goes along lines of,
 I heard this crazy rumor that,
 blan, blan, blan, blan, blan, blan, blan.
  </li><li>Oh, I've heard many of crazy rumors that I'm like,
 what now? (laughs)
  </li><li>And the answer to all of them is none of them are true.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 Don't believe the crazy rumors.
 Don't believe the crazy rumors.
 That's my favorite thing.
 Again, this is a reflection of the quality
 of the people in our community.
 Is it rather than propagating those crazy rumors,
 we just get phone calls or text messages or emails going,
 "Hey, I heard X, Y, and Z."
 But yes, from some people certainly, yes.
 They're coming straight to us and we're like,
 "No, that is not true."
 But it's creative thinking on the parts of some people.
 Well, yes, but that's the thing.
 I think it's human nature to write a story.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh.
  </li><li>And we don't even realize most of the time
 that we're doing it.
 We're assuming a whole bunch of things
 to connect three dots.
 And then that story grows.
  </li><li>Makes a sense.
 We need story to feel safe.
 And a made up story is better than mystery often.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Well, I mean, I know I do that about,
 if we get in a fight.
  </li><li>Yeah, about everything.
  </li><li>It's easier for me to think I know about your motives.
 So I can justify my behavior.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>We know.
 (laughing)
 But is human nature.
  </li><li>No, it's incredibly like the crazy stories
 you've heard are not true.
  </li><li>Yes, I think one of the things in this season
 that's been really amazing is the amount of different people
 that have told us, hey, we've been praying for you guys.
 And a lot of them probably not even knowing really
 what's going on.
 And so we actually really wanna thank you
 for praying for us and for covering us
 because we have felt that.
 We have felt so covered.
 in again a very difficult transition.
 We have felt God's peace and his comfort and supported.
 So thank you for praying.
 It's meant the world to us.
  </li><li>Yeah, people from all seasons of our life,
 like historical seasons of our life,
 are emailing, reaching out, like,
 "Hey, don't know what's going on."
  </li><li>Sending us dreams, all kinds of stuff.
  </li><li>Oh, we feel really cradled by the love of God.
 So thank you for all of that.
  </li><li>Thank you.
  </li><li>All right.
 episode, a little bit of a short episode than normal.
 We did want to get something out, probably more that we're going to unpack about.
 Well, as we know more, we currently don't know more, but yeah, we'll unpack as we
 know what we're doing.
 We absolutely will.
 But want to leave you with three requests, three things.
 Number one is we, Adrian and I were thinking about this earlier, like we're fast
 approaching 300 episodes.
 Yes.
 We've covered a lot of material, but if there's stuff that you would love us to do
 podcast on about, yeah, talk about.
 episodes about. Yeah. Reach out to us. Go to alanag.com/ask, for example, or you can email us. Hello at
 alanag.com. With your ideas. Social media. Yeah. No. What would be helpful in the season of your
 life so that we can serve you well with podcast topics are going to help bring transformation.
 That's number one. Yes. Number two, copies of Finding Father of the Books that AJ wrote were
 out of stock pretty much all summer because we were on sabbatical and we didn't want to order
 anymore. We didn't want to ship anymore. We were trying to like legit rest. We hit the
 off button. We did. But they're back in stock and they make wonderful Christmas gifts. So
 order them now. And then lastly, number three, a huge thank you to the members of our podcast
 that make the show possible. If you would like to become a member, I don't think it's
 a better time to become a member than right now. Because we're about to just kick off
 something all new. Seriously, if you become a member of the show, you get discounts on
 in all our books and courses,
 just like Finding Father we just talked about.
 You get prior to Q&amp;A,
 you get video versions of this podcast.
 And a big thank you to our members
 because we just upgraded our studio.
 Hopefully we sound a little bit better.
 Hopefully we look glorious.
  </li><li>We've got all kinds of cameras in here.
 I don't know where to look.
  </li><li>It is, it probably doesn't look any different
 to our members, like from this side of the camera,
 it probably looks very similar.
  </li><li>But it's different.
  </li><li>But it's a lot different.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And the goal is to make it easier
 do sees episodes faster. Yeah. Yeah. And if you remember, you can see that every
 time Alan has lunch, he deposits some of it on the front of the shirt.
 Mexican food. So also should come. Did you eat Mexican food today?
 Yeah, I had about hot tacos. So tacos is Mexican. Therefore, I'm fine.
 What did I spell? I don't know. It looks white. Yeah, it's it's all I
 had a creme sauce. Anyway, but come remember, see the food stains on my shirt, go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/join
 and we look forward to being with you next week.
 Goodbye.
 Bye.
 Episodes not over yet. This is post-production, Alan. I have just finished editing the episode
 that you've just watched or listened to and realized, A.G. and I probably spoke a bit too
 quickly. So we've just finished saying, "Hey, we'll see you again next week." And at the
 The time of recording, that was incredibly honest.
 We were like, "Ah, we love this.
 Can't wait to get back in the swing of podcasting again."
 But then I started editing and I said to AJ,
 "Hey, you know, if our plan is to be off
 for the remainder of this year,
 podcasting each week will necessitate that we're not off."
 And she was like, "Yeah."
 So after a little bit of thought,
 we've decided that we're not gonna be podcasting again
 until the new year.
 So we did wanna get this episode out
 with everything that's happened.
 One of the pieces of feedback that we got from people
 is, hey, your voice is missed in this.
 We would love to hear where you're at.
 So we wanted to get this episode out
 just to let everybody know where we're at,
 what we're doing, what we're up to,
 so that you could see our faces, hear our voice,
 let you know how we're doing and what's going on.
 But we are not quite ready to jump back
 in the saddle for podcasting.
 So that's gonna be a 2023 thing.
 We do wanna be people over word
 and we realize we said, hey, we'll see you next week.
 and you won't.
 So feel free to reach out to us again.
 Still send us your feedback on what you'd like us
 to talk about because we are excited about podcasting.
 We do wanna help you.
 So if you've got thoughts, questions, topics, queries
 that you would love us to investigate in 2023,
 go ahead, send them in.
