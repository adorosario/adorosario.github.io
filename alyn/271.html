<p> Mr. Jones. Yes, Madame. Episode 271.<br/>
 Can you believe it? Keeping up with the Jones is happy Valentine's
 day. If you're listening to this on a Monday, thank you.
 I was speaking to her.<br/>
 But nevertheless, happy Valentine's day to you, my love.
 What were we discussing before we hit record that you have a colossal
 zit coming in on your nose?<br/>
 So I've been working the last couple of days and there's been someone
 in my nose and so not to be gross.<br/>
 But when I stick my finger at my right nozzle, I couldn't feel
 but it would feel sore and there was nothing on the skin and I think it's a
 zit between the inside cavity of my nostril and the outside.
 -It looks like just your standard zit on the outside.
 Don't rub it.<br/>
 -How was that?<br/>
 -47, I have a zit.<br/>
 -It's heard bright like a little beacon.
 I might call you Rudolph.<br/>
 -Dolorious.<br/>
 -Or we could name it.<br/>
 Let's call it Edgar.<br/>
 -Welcome to episode 271, where this week we're discussing myself a steamer.
 AJ Jones, give us a weekly update.<br/>
 Oh gosh.<br/>
 What a week.<br/>
 And there's our weekly update, our main topic for this week.
 Yeah, it has for a number of reasons been pretty intense.
 I don't know if it's been intense.<br/>
 It feels long and it feels a substantial week.
 I think it felt it.<br/>
 Well, yeah.<br/>
 Talk to me about your intense week then.
 Well, you know, normal church on Sunday, which was great, but it's, you know, it's usually
 long.<br/>
 you're shaking your head the whole time you're saying that. I don't know what you're saying.
 That was great. Great. And why don't we skip to the bit? Romans. I taught Romans.
 That's not where I was going. I was thinking about the adoption update. That was the intense part
 on Wednesday. I don't think everyone wants to hear about Romans. I think you all want to hear
 about it. Did we get a baby? We didn't. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. The mom chose a different family,
 which, you know, we were praying if this isn't the baby that we're supposed to adopt, then
 She won't choose us and she didn't like on one level, it's like, yeah, that's.
 It's exactly what we asked for. Right. And on the other level, I'm so sad and I would have loved it
 if we had been picked. You shared something beautiful on Wednesday, our pastor's meeting.
 Do you think you touched on last week about trying to do it differently this time?
 Yeah. Which is like, you know, keeping your traditional method would be shut down your heart.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And I should keep my heart open and experience all the feels in between.
 Now that now that's what I'm trying to do.
 Yeah.<br/>
 How is that being upon reflection?<br/>
 So you didn't get the baby.<br/>
 Oh, it's harder.<br/>
 It's harder.<br/>
 I think so.<br/>
 But then it's hard to say like I think even when you think you're shutting down your heart,
 I don't know that that's actually I'm ever fully successful at that.
 It is a weird thing.<br/>
 I mean, I think you summarized it beautifully that on the one hand genuinely
 We're trusting God in the process.<br/>
 So he started the only thing we can conclude is, wait, go God.
 You know, you got this little baby, an amazing family.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And it doesn't happen to be us.<br/>
 And that's okay.<br/>
 Cause you initiated this and yet still part of our hearts were preparing
 like, Oh, end of March, we're going to have a baby.
 There's a potential.<br/>
 And yeah.<br/>
 So it did, it did create some impetus for researching like best
 baby formulas and all the different things that I haven't looked at yet.
 So I think I'm just going to continue to invest in the direction of research.
 Does that help your heart?<br/>
 Yeah, I think it does because also now that we haven't picked by this mom,
 we're back in the race again, sort of, you know, like, and, and you can end up
 with scenarios where you get picked in the baby's born two weeks later.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah, or the baby's already been born.
  </li><li>Right, I think I would feel better in the moment
 of saying yes to a baby to know that I've already
 gotten some idea of what needs to be in place, yeah.
  </li><li>Today's Saturday. - Yes.
  </li><li>We found out Wednesday night.
  </li><li>Yes. - How's your heart feeling today
 about adoption, general outlook?
  </li><li>I feel great, I feel hopeful.
  </li><li>Yeah, and you're like the sadness
 about not getting picked, where's that?
  </li><li>It's probably like 10%.
  </li><li>10%, okay. - Yeah, like it's,
 You know, I let myself cry quite a bit on Wednesday,
 cry a little bit on Thursday,
 cry with my therapist Friday morning.
 And yeah, otherwise I have tremendous amounts of hope
 and I know God's orchestrating it,
 but it's hard.
  </li><li>Yeah, it is.
 Thank you to everybody who prayed for us.
 If you are listening to us and that Venn diagram,
 if you are listening and you're also an adoption newsletter,
 you know pretty much as quickly as we do.
 So thank you to everybody who wrote in and said,
 "Hey, you know, praying for you
 Thanks for your purse, I appreciate that.
 That was one component of a busy, heavy week,
 but there was some fun lightness in the midst of this week.
 Both of us did something we haven't done in a long time.
  </li><li>We did?
  </li><li>We went to the movie theater.
  </li><li>We did go to the movie theater.
  </li><li>Yeah, we took our daughters on dates.
 What did you go see?
  </li><li>I took Tia, who's totally into musicals
 to see West Side Story, the new one by Steven Spielberg.
 And he, it's fantastic.
 I mean, I have no interest in watching that at all.
 No interest really in musicals.
 I watched the trailer and was almost in tears.
 It looks beautiful.
 It's beautiful.
 You would love it.
 I've never even seen the first one.
 He did such a great job of keeping,
 it feels like the first one,
 even the coloring and the tone
 and all that kind of stuff he kept with
 what the first one felt like.
 You know, many of the dance scenes
 have even some of the steps from the original.
 I mean, just like, it's amazing.
 One of the characters in the original who plays Anita,
 she plays a role in this one as well.
 So it's just, oh yeah, it was beautiful.
  </li><li>I think Tia loved it. - Yeah.
  </li><li>And quality time.
  </li><li>And was your theater busy?
  </li><li>It wasn't, no, it wasn't super busy,
 but there was like, 15 people there,
 20 people, something like that.
  </li><li>Okay, so the answer to that question is no.
  </li><li>Spaced out. - Yeah.
 a small theater. So that's a guy I took at happy to see the new Spider-Man movie, which I hadn't
 yet seen. We were waiting for it to come out in digital release to watch a home. But when I booked
 a movie theater, when I booked the tickets, me and I were the only people in this whole
 theater. And when we got there, there was maybe, maybe five other people, but like you say, all
 spaced out in. But you were in those ones where you get food. Yes, but they've shut down the food
 service. So they don't serve you or bring you can order stuff at the bar and they kind of bring it
 in a to-go container for you, but they've really, really limited
 menu, really limited service, but I don't care.
 Because I see Spider-Man.
 It's a beautiful nod to Spider-Man movies.
 It's really good.
 I think you would, I think you would like it.
 You got a little bit, and I don't even want to be critical.
 I don't know if I was tired, but I got a little bit bored, a lull in the
 center of the movie.
 Overall, loved it.
 Really good.
 All right.
 Well, maybe I'll watch it at some point.
 Continue our escapade into media consumption.
 Escapade into media consumption.
 We went to a movie theater for the first time in like a hundred years.
 Oh, OK, I got you.
 We have a new video game that we start playing here.
 Sorry, that was my segue.
 New video game that we're both playing.
 Yes.
 Do you want to talk about it?
 Do you even know the name of it?
 Rising Phoenix.
 The Phoenix rises.
 Nope.
 Rising of the Phoenix.
 OK, it's I think it's called a mortal's Phoenix rising.
 Okay, well that's practically the same thing.
 I like, yeah, it's not a great name.
 It was going to be called monsters and gods.
 Gears of the Rings are a little bit suspicious of it.
 And then realized once I played it, like the genre of it is, is, is quite fun.
 It's set in the context of Greek mythology.
 Yes.
 So initially there's a bit hesitant because I didn't, you know, want to play with gods.
 But then I realized it's a lot of poking fun at Greek mythology.
 All the gods have been destroyed, the Greek gods.
 Yeah, and you're like a hero running around.
 Yes, and it's very similar in gameplay to Zelda Breath of the Wild.
 Yeah, so all the buttons are different.
 Completely different controls.
 And but the tone is very different in the graphic style, the sense of humor.
 There's a narrator, there's two narrators that I actually quite find quite humorous.
 But funny.
 I keep jumping off of cliffs and trying to use the link button for flying.
 and then I fall to my death.
 Yeah.
 I'm about four days ahead of you.
 So my job in the last two days has been to be your tech support.
 I don't know how to solve this last.
 I started yesterday, didn't I?
 Yeah, last week.
 And then I just needed some help.
 That's all.
 I'm happy to be that person.
 Not unlike when we started playing Zelda.
 Yeah, I would get so freaked out.
 I'd be like, I can't do it here.
 Do it.
 But it is.
 I bought it because it was on sale.
 It was I got it and all the DLC for like 25 bucks as normally hundred bucks
 I got for 25 bucks and I had a gift card from Christmas
 Thank you, and I you know it's burning a hole in my pocket. So I bought it. Yeah, I know I mentioned this earlier
 Yes, it's Valentine's Day the day we release this episode. Yeah, what are we doing for Valentine's Day this year?
 Aren't you taking me someplace nice for dinner
 We literally had a discussion last night about what do you want to do about nine today and i was like knowing you your gift is probably higher than quality time.
 Would you prefer a gift instead of going out and you're like yeah i would and then just smiled and then tell me what gift you're wanting.
 Oh well i mean i'd be fine have both dinner and going out but it is great.
 [laughter]
 But that wasn't my question.
 So what did you say? What's a question?
 What is what?
 My question?
 No! My question was...
 I anticipate that you are probably before a nicer gift than going out and getting a gift.
 Yeah, me.
 Instead of going out, is there a gift that you want?
 And you just did that kind of like smile at Tia does, where you've like been planning something.
 But you never told me what you wanted.
 Well, I'm debating.
 are shortlist. But we need cutlery. So I was going to cut. But I thought there's no way
 you're going to go for that. No. So honey, I love you. Here's some silverware that we desperately
 need because all our forks go missing. I don't understand the spoons, the little spoons. I
 blame you. I, well, I think I'm selling them in the black market. No, I think there's somewhere
 hiding in that accessibility law in office.
 I feel really bad because we're
 insistent that the kids tidy the room and I don't know why none of them have clocked
 that my office is disgraced and why they don't leverage that against me.
 I know.
 I'm like, oh, my office is so bad.
 Yeah.
 I'm going to clean up the pressure wash robot.
 Yeah, that we use all the time.
 I've been in great debate.
 I was thinking about it today because I was thinking that I wanted to try going in one
 of those float tank places.
 She's bouncing up and down.
 I don't know if you can see.
 It's not because she's cold.
 It's when you talk about gifts, her love language for gifts is so high.
 You want to go in one of those salted float tanky places.
 I can make that happen for you.
 But I'm not committed to that yet.
 I'm still pondering.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 Well, you've got a couple of days.
 Well, I haven't found time to say to everybody else.
 The Valentine's Day is a sore day for you.
 I'm really sorry.
 I don't know what to say other than,
 you know what, it'll be Tuesday before you know it.
  </li><li>I used to host a Valentine's Day party
 when I was single, between first husband
 and you, the Wonder Child.
 (laughs)
 And I used to call it Black Monday party
 or Black Tuesday party.
  </li><li>Where was Chip Dog in those days?
  </li><li>All right, and then I just invite all my single friends
 over and we would sit around and eat stuff
 watch movies.
 All right.
 Well, with Black Monday behind us, we hope you've had an amazing week wherever you are
 in the world, whatever you're weak has been like.
 We pray that it's been blessed.
 Our main topic for this week is going to be talking about, remember the book that I read,
 The Bless Life?
 Listen, if you haven't, I think I mentioned this last week, if you haven't read The Bless
 Life by Robert Morse, I'd encourage you to do that.
 It's easily within the top five books that have changed my life.
 It currently holds the record for the book that caused me to get down on my face and pray.
 Like I think I went, yeah, the most.
 I think, I remember reading Jack Deere's Surprise by the Voice of God.
 I remember having to close the book and being astonished.
 I couldn't believe what I was reading.
 This book, at least two times, possibly three times, I was faced down on the floor praying
 because the test minutes in that book are so astonishing.
 I've been teaching at Grey Center for the last three weeks.
 Tomorrow will be the fourth and final week.
 All about the topic of blessing.
 Week one, it's so funny.
 I deliberately spent half the time.
 What do you smile at?
  </li><li>I was like, I can't even remember week one.
 It was like a whole three weeks ago
 and I feel like I've aged since then.
  </li><li>Not a tall baby.
 You look not a day over 50.
  </li><li>Thanks, sweetheart.
  </li><li>Week one was all about why blessing
 is not synonymous with money.
 And yet blessing must include money.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Week two was similar,
 but it was all about why salvation
 is the ultimate blessing.
 And yet it's not limited to blessing.
 And I deliberately spent 50% of the time allocated
 to this topic to try and convince believers
 that God wants them blessed.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I would put myself in that category
 'cause I did not grow up,
 I didn't grow up believing God wanted you blessed.
 And yet of course in a truth or true or false
 multiple choice thing does God want you blessed?
  </li><li>Yes, of course.
  </li><li>Yes, where you draw the line of what blessing looks like,
 I never had it, like I always laugh
 when people, there's a theologian I follow from Britain who said he tweeted out one day and I
 saved a tweak of thought this is just hysterical. It should be immoral for pastors to earn over 75,000,
 I think it was 75,000 pounds a year. And I was like, I'm fascinated to know why 75,000 pounds is
 okay, but 76,000 would be immoral. Right. Like, I just be so curious to know like, where did that
 line get crossed and a moral how, like, earn that? Or if they got residuals off, I don't know,
 they own a patent and they got that. Like, this whole notion. So, like, we all at some point believe
 that God wants us blessed. We just can't decide what blessing looks like. So anyway, I spent two
 weeks thoroughly trying to convince people it's in the Bible. God wants people blessed. Then last week,
 I talked about one of the foundational keys to living a blessed life is lifestyle of tithing.
 which produce some fascinating questions we're going to explore in a second.
 Tomorrow, God willing, I'm going to be teaching about the second half because a life of tithing is
 good, but it's not enough. In Malachi, it talks about, hey, you've robbed me. How have we robbed
 you in tithes and offerings? And I think certainly for most of my life, like once I was convinced I
 I was a tither. My approach to money was like the tithe was a security blanket for me.
 Like, well, I've tied that 10%. And so now don't you dare ask me for anything with a
 9%.
 In fact, it's mine.
 And I would feel immune to any request because I'd be like, no, I tithe, you know, like just
 a smug thing. And I didn't realize that that was a stronghold of selfishness in my heart.
 Yeah.
 Didn't realize that. I'm trying to remember what changed that for us. I remember one thing
 that changed first. Do you remember years ago? One of my heroes is a man named Paul Kane.
 He's now with the Lord. Very, very gifted prophet and had some severe moral failures
 towards the end of his life. And I remember listening to him maybe like 10 years ago.
 So this was after one of the major disclosures and he was speaking on mercy. Bear with me
 because this could sound haughty and I don't mean it to sound haughty at all. But I'm listening
 to this man who's probably one of the greatest living prophets, at least of our generation.
 So amazing revelation, amazing ability to hear the voice of God. And I don't know how old he is,
 he's in his 80s when he said this, right? Well, he's 17, maybe early 80s. And he was
 astonished because he just discovered the revelation that when you show mercy, mercy is granted to
 you the lost soul and reaping, which of course is that's a revelation we've lived with for years.
 Thank you, John and Carol, aren't it right like the importance of forgiveness?
 Yes, a lot of sewing and reaping and everyone to be in judgment if you want mercy for you
 You have to show mercy to others. Yes, and it was amazing and
 Kind of head tiltingly staggering to hear this great man of God
 With vast enthusiasm say I need mercy more than anybody else
 Which means I need to show more mercy than anybody else and he was just talking about
 Like how he dedicated this year to being the most merciful he'd ever been in his life
 So I was a really like humble listen to this great man say that but be kind of shocked
 You didn't already have that revelation. That makes sense. Yes, cuz it was our bread and butter. Yes again
 Thank you John and care. Yeah, I was so moved by his testimony
 And I think it was shortly after we in 2008 was it
 Was it it was no cuz we moved here in 2008
 We moved here at the end of 2008
 But we came here for we came to Gray Center for the first time and they took up that offering and that was the year that the Lord
 I had talked to you about being generous.
  </li><li>That's right.
 And so it would have been January 2008
 that I heard Paul Kane say that.
 And I remember saying to you, babe,
 'cause we'd just been given that $76,000 check.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>We'd just been shown mercy.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Generosity.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so we decided that year we're gonna give away,
 we're gonna be more generous than we have ever been.
 And so with that year in mind,
 we purposed to just give like the Dickens.
 Is that an expression?
 give as much as we could, yeah.
 Give radically as much as we could.
 And that was, like that really changed something for us.
 I think I got a new boost of that from reading The Bless Life.
 Yeah, that makes sense.
 And I don't remember when that was.
 But that started for us this little ledger that we would keep
 about what we'd give and what we bless.
 And so...
 And what we'd receive.
 And what we'd receive at Beggaparn.
 And so I think we've talked about this before,
 but AJ and I are not only tithers, but we're givers.
 What that means is any increase that comes to us, our income, our salary, gifts, we've
 purposed in our heart, we're always going to tie, that's a no-brainer for us.
 But we've also purposed that we're going to set a portion of money above and beyond the
 tie to give away.
 So, we have an account, a ledger that we just keep stocked with money and our whole
 purpose is to sow, to just give it away.
 And that's what we do and we track when we give.
 Now, I'm not going to have time to talk about this tomorrow in the sermon.
 I talk about it on the course we're about to do where not only do we tithe, not only do we give,
 but we're also open to this other category called giving the hurts.
 That's giving that we haven't planned to give on.
 Yes.
 Why am I talking about this?
 Where do we get to?
 We're talking about giving, Paul Kane, the whole thing of, of giving and watching what happens when we give.
 And I love that we can now testify to the truth that I think it's Luke.
 Luke six, is it?
 Gave and it will be given to you a good measure.
 Press down, shaking together, running over.
 How many of you have heard that in a Testament talk?
 Like a offering talk.
 Yeah, an offering talk.
 Thank you.
 And it's got nothing to do with money.
 No, no, no, no, it's totally lifestyle.
 Like it's so curious that has nothing to do with money.
 It's all about what we're talking about.
 We're talking about like not judging and forgiving.
 But the most important word in there is it, given it will be given to you.
 And I remember we went, I don't know what year this was, but we went through a
 season of being deliberately intentional about giving specific things and watching
 the things that we'd given be returned to us.
 We practiced giving away iPods.
 Oh, that's right.
 And we discovered we received iPods.
 Yeah.
 We gave away watches.
 Boy, that was hard.
 And received.
 We used those iPods.
 Do you want to tell the story?
 Well, I mean, I just remember giving them away and thinking we traveled full time.
 This was before we had Apple phones or whatever, like it had all of our music on it.
 We spent our lives on planes.
 The click wheel iPod.
 And it was like, man, given this away is going to hurt, you know, because we use it.
 Well, you're in a country that the import fees on an iPod were just so expensive.
 Yes.
 Is that right?
 Yeah.
 And you were moved to give away an iPod.
 Yeah.
 And then you got an amazing iPod.
 Did.
 I remember giving away a watch.
 I haven't told this test phone in public.
 I've never been a watch where I wear an Apple watch for obvious reasons.
 But I've never been a watch where I really haven't.
 I don't really like jewelry.
 Yeah, but I do like well made things.
 Yes, I'm really not a watch person.
 But I had bought a watch.
 I don't know why I bought a watch.
 I think I'd been given a watch.
 Yeah, that's right.
 I was I was given a watch.
 A really nice watch.
 Yeah.
 And I'm not a watch person.
 somebody in my life who really was a watch person. Yeah. And they wanted to start collecting watches.
 And so it seems like this watch means more to you than it is to me. And so I gave them the watch.
 Yes. And then I got another watch. Yes. And there was somebody else who the watch was way too hip for me.
 And they happened to say I really like a watch. And so I gave them that watch.
 Is this the one with the blue face? That's the one I remember. I don't remember.
 Okay. And then shock of all shocks, I get a watch I've really liked. Yeah.
 I'm not a watch person, but one of the watches I do like is a Rolex Submariner.
 Yeah.
 And so one day I was a blue, somebody gave me a Rolex, a vintage Rolex Submariner.
 And I remember, A, being shot that somebody gave me a Rolex.
 And I remember putting it on my wrist.
 And I remember as soon as I put it on, the Holy Spirit, I could hear him.
 He's right here.
 You whisper to me, he's like, you realize this is not yours to keep.
 And I was like, I get it.
 And at that moment, I felt the Holy Spirit said, it's yours to steward.
 And then I'm going to ask you to give it away,
 which was totally fine. It was so humorous. I had that Rolex. I don't know for how many years,
 I wore it, I think twice. I took it out occasionally because you've got to wear it
 I wore it in public twice because again, I'm not really a watch person. One was our anniversary
 and another time was a formal occasion. And then the Lord put it on my heart to give it away.
 But we've just seen time and time again, things that we've given have been returned to us.
 Yeah, for sure. Well, so that dynamic also works with money.
 Yeah, because it works with anything.
 It, it, but I was thinking, I remember one time that we, we were just sort of identifying
 some people that have poured into our lives.
 And so that month we wanted to just send a check to somebody, you know, that's in ministry
 that had really impacted us and just said, thank you, you've really impacted us and wanted
 to send you this gift.
 And so we sent that person $200.
 That's right.
 And then about two weeks later, we got to check from somebody that I don't think I'd
 minister at the church in a couple of years.
 Okay.
 And you knew this person.
 Yeah.
 And they just, same thing.
 They just sent a letter saying, hey, just wanted to say thank you for impacting blah,
 blah, but they sent us a thousand dollars.
 And I was like, well, all right then.
 I think it's funny.
 It's amazing, isn't it?
 I mean, it's amazing, but it's the same principle we've taught for years on non-blasting topics.
 So we've taught about the lost song and reaping.
 Do not deceive God, kind of be Mark, man, re-treat your judges.
 What do you so?
 What is wrong with me today?
 You're so funny. It's Edgar. It's taking over.
 Sucking all the blood from my brain.
 That's right.
 Don't touch it.
 But we teach about the lost song and reaping from a negative aspect.
 Like, don't sow judgments, so you reap judgments.
 Right, well, we teach those.
 Yeah, but what I'm saying is we never get pushed back
 on the spiritual aspect of that. But as soon as you start talking, like, blessing or physical
 aspects to it, people get upset. People get up in arms about it. And I don't understand why.
 I think one of the most missed areas regarding giving is people get confused between dollar amount
 and heart motivation.
 Okay.
 So I think people think in order to be generous, you have to give large amounts of things away.
 Right.
 But that's not true. To be generous is a position of the heart rather than an amount on a ledger.
 Right.
 So you remember Jesus watching the offering box and people coming in and then the
 widow giving the widows, you're not wearing your widows, might necklace.
 Well, if I'd only known.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And he said, you know, tell the truth. She gave more than all of the others. They gave out their
 excess she gave all she had. So her like monetary value was minimal, but it was all
 she had. I remember, I'm going to tell a story tomorrow, I remember being in church,
 and I remember it was worship and I remember being preoccupied and worship because I was
 worried about how we were going to make ends meet. And we, the big thing that we had coming
 up that month, that week was our car payment, which is 400 bucks.
 Yes, I remember this.
 And then Jeff decides to surprise everybody
 with an impromptu offering.
 Yeah, an extra offering.
 Yeah, just like, hey, let's take up an offering.
 And again, in my head, I was like, well, I'm, you know, great.
 I mean, all that we had money to give.
 Right.
 And I remember the Holy Spirit saying, is that so?
 And I was like, Lord, I've got no, like, we've got no,
 like I'm literally being praying to you about like,
 where are we going to get money?
 Like in two days, we have a car payment.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 How are we going to do that?
 And the Lord reminded me I had $4 in my wallet, like $4 measly
 dollars.
 Yep.
 And I remember the Lord saying you could give that.
 And I remember like, like eye rolling, but also being reluctant to give those four
 dollars because well, you know, I need $400 and I've got four.
 So now I only need $396.
 Somewhere that was my thinking.
 Yeah.
 And I remember the Lord, you know, the Lord's never mean about anything, but he's like, oh, okay.
 And I was like, you really want my $4.
 And he's like, I don't meet your need anyway.
 Exactly.
 So I remember being partly humiliated that all I could give in an offering was $4 and partly
 laughing like this is so beautiful. So I remember going up with a very tightly closed fist,
 and I remember putting $4 in the offering, just thinking, I mean, Lord, the lunacy is,
 I thought that by holding on to that I could do something like that. We come home that afternoon
 and the long story short, Jeff calls and just says, "Yeah, it was the next day."
 No, it wasn't that Sunday afternoon.
 No.
 Oh, see, we...
 That was the next day, because we were going to emanate.
 And I remember because I had enough food in the house
 to feed the kids, but I didn't have enough food for us.
 So I was like, "Hey, babe, I'll just...
 You go to Jeff's, I'll be right behind you.
 I just have to figure out something because I didn't know how the sitter
 would figure out doing food."
 And I was...
 And then I had told you, like, "I don't have food for us,
 So we're gonna go to emanate and we used to--
  </li><li>We'll eat snacks.
  </li><li>Snacks and emanate.
 And I was like, that'll be what we eat tonight.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So we go over to Jeff's house and Becky assaults you
 as soon as you walk in.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And she puts money in your shirt pocket for groceries.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which is crazy 'cause I don't know how she knew that.
 We didn't--
  </li><li>I don't know.
  </li><li>We didn't tell anybody.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we thought that was it, but no, what we didn't know
 is somebody had approached Jeff and said,
 we wanna pay off the Jones' minivan.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And we were like, wait, what?
 You know, we're shocked.
 The $4 I was holding onto in an effort to bail to my car payment.
 When I gave that $4 to God, a minimal amount, but required a heart response.
 It was literally all we had.
 I was like, "Oh, I'll see that $4.
 And I'll raise you your whole minivan being paid."
 And I mean, it would have been amazing even if it was just the $400 payment.
 Oh my gosh, it was amazing that we got grocery money.
 Right.
 Like, "Lord, you saw us, you married me."
  </li><li>My name on that is what she gave us was $40.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So she just stuck $40 in my hands
 and I don't even know how she knew
 that we didn't have groceries.
  </li><li>No clue.
  </li><li>And so I started crying at that and Jeff was like,
 you should probably sit down and then.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>I forgot all these little details.
  </li><li>And then so we sit down and hey,
 somebody's paying off your minivan and I was like,
 but when I look back, it's like we gave $40,
 them and got $40 for groceries.
 And we didn't just get the $400 car payment,
 but actually they paid off them.
  </li><li>Many, many, many, yeah.
  </li><li>So my encouragement is,
 is you've heard the cliche, you can't outgive God.
 You really cannot.
 And I think tithing and giving are both just tests of the heart.
 Like what's going on in your heart?
 And I want to encourage you, like practice being generous.
 If you're going to wait for God to put it on your heart to give,
 you might be waiting a long time.
 Like I've never noticed that God--
  </li><li>Yeah, because usually your heart's pretty hard
 if we're waiting for God to make us do it.
  </li><li>Well, pick anything else.
 Have you noticed that the Holy Spirit has an expectation
 that you would pray more than you are waiting on Him
 to tell you to pray?
 Does that make sense?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like think about it in any relationship.
 If you're always the person phoning somebody to say,
 "Hey, do you wanna hang out?
 Do you wanna hang out?
 Do you wanna hang out?"
  </li><li>Yeah.
 Right.
 Right.
 And at the same time, if you were like,
 if the only time you praise when you feel conviction,
 you're missing out on a beautiful relationship with God,
 same thing with giving.
 And I think one of the greatest miracles
 God's done in my heart is he's turned me from a stingy person
 to somebody who is passionate about being generous and giving.
 So great.
 And this will probably come as no surprise to you.
 But I've had an amazingly fun time
 pairing the teaching and doing the teaching at race center.
 that does not come as a surprise.
  </li><li>I love it.
 I've loved getting to be with people.
 Part of the sadness of being a teacher
 is obviously there's way more stuff I want to teach
 than I've got on four weeks.
 And I'm really sad about the stuff I don't get to say
 'cause as a teacher,
 I don't like giving incomplete revelation.
 Part of the other sadness I feel the limitations
 of the model that we have is I don't get to answer
 people's questions.
 Like one of the things I've loved is especially
 the last two weeks as soon as I've finished speaking,
 I go to the back to just greet people as they're leaving
 and thank them for coming.
 and I get asked really, really good questions
 that I'm like, "Oh, I wish everybody could hear that."
 And so that's just one of the limitations of it.
 However, part of my effort to solve those limitations
 and to actually be with people
 and to be able to answer questions
 and explore stuff that perhaps I've left unsaid
 that I don't realize is unsaid
 is I've created a course called the More Than Enough Course,
 which explores all of this in way more detail.
 And if you've loved or been challenged by, let's say,
 If you engage with the material the last couple of weeks
 at Grace Center, I would encourage you to sign up
 for this course.
 It's going to be a nine lesson course
 where we're going to go into way more detail
 about what we've talked about.
 We'll certainly cover the key concepts
 we've talked about at Grace Center.
 But I'll go into more detail.
 There'll be exercises for you to do.
 I'll meet with you weekly so that you can ask me questions.
 We'll have a little private forum where
 you can ask me questions live or on paper.
 I'll provide more resources.
 And I'm really, really excited about doing that.
 To get information about that, go to <a href="mailto:allen@ag.com">allen@ag.com</a>/more.
 Wait, wait, wait.
 I have two listeners questions for you.
 Oh, look at you.
 Right. Right.
 This second.
 You're coming fully formed?
 I'm coming ready with like those questions, things that you refer to.
 All right.
 Hit me with your listeners question.
 OK, here's my question.
 First of all, are you distracted by my glasses?
 OK.
 You probably saw me to a second.
 Oh, like, when did you put those on?
 Just a moment ago.
 I prefer the red.
 I know.
 Well, I have red.
 I think.
 I just thought I'd do blue today.
 All right, so listeners questions,
 this one is from anonymous,
 and it's about tax return returns.
  </li><li>I got lots of, I guess it's tax season,
 so I got lots of tax return questions.
  </li><li>I have a question about tithing
 on my income tax return.
 Should I tithe on my income tax return
 if I have already tithe on it out of every paycheck?
  </li><li>Okay, so I don't know how this is gonna apply
 around the world because I've forgotten both Canadian tax systems and the British tax system.
 But here in America, I think what this person is saying is, "Hey, if the tax return I'm getting
 is just a return of my overspending, my overpaying tax." Yes. On income I've already
 tithed on. Wouldn't this money be tithe free?" And the answer to that question is, it depends
 because sometimes the return that you get is simply an overpayment of what you've already paid.
 In which case it has been tied to that.
 Had been tied, though.
 But sometimes your tax return has things like tax credits in it.
 Like here in America, we get a tax credit for having children.
 Yes.
 That means we get essentially free money, we don't get free money, but it's
 increase of money that we didn't earn.
 Yes.
 In which case we would tithe on it.
 Yes.
 So just to complicate things even further is we're big believers in never outgiving God.
 So we've historically always tized on any increase that comes to us.
 Yeah, even like birthday presents and things.
 But even a tax return that was returned to you out of money you've already tived on,
 what's the downside on tithing and giving on that?
 Right.
 Like, "Well, I don't want to be a double tither because you don't want to be doubly blessed."
 You know, I'm not pleased to hear a tone of sarcasm or putting it down in that.
 I'm just saying you're never going to go wrong giving to God.
 So we've historically always just, any time we get attacked for turn, that's increased.
 It's money we weren't expecting.
 Because you know what it's like when you go to your account or when you do your taxes,
 you're like, "Come on, come on Jesus. Why old do I not?"
 And so that relief to say, "Oh, I don't owe anything.
 Oh, and I'm actually getting a return."
 Like that's an increase you probably weren't expecting.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So even if it's an increase in stuff
 you've already tithed on, you won't go wrong
 tithing on again.
 I'm not saying that out of legalism,
 I'm just saying that out of joy.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But the real answer to your question is,
 it depends on what your tax return is made up of.
  </li><li>Yes.
 So this is from a business owner.
 So it says, the tithing on first fruits was huge.
 I'm wondering if you know the best way to tithe
 when running a business for me, an art business in brackets,
 where I've already tithed on the money I've spent on materials.
 When I get paid for a painting,
 should I tithe on the full amount I'm paid for the painting,
 or on the full amount minus the materials?
 Thanks for any insight you can give on that.
  </li><li>I also got this question a lot onto--
  </li><li>Like a version of that.
  </li><li>Which makes sense, 'cause Gracie has made up of a lot of--
  </li><li>Or, you know, creative people who run their own businesses
 and what they do.
 And I've thought long and hard about this.
 And really my answer is influenced by Dave Ramsey.
 I would imagine there's a wide variety of answers
 that you could give that would all be good.
 Here's what age I do because we also have a side business.
 So you probably know, you're listening to this podcast.
 We have a side business that sells our courses,
 video courses, sells H.J's books.
 You know, when we go speak at churches, et cetera.
 our podcast all falls under that.
 So what we do is any increase that we make into the business,
 we do not tithe on until that increase comes to us.
 What do you mean, Alan?
 So let's say we sell in a month, I don't know,
 $1,000 worth of books, okay?
 We leave that $1,000 in the business
 because there's gonna be expenses,
 there's gonna be ordering new books,
 or there's gonna be shipping,
 or there's gonna be payment to our web hosting, whatever.
 We don't tithe on that increase until AG and I touch that money personally.
 So maybe we go to our business account and maybe we pay ourselves.
 Let's say we pay ourselves $2,000 out of that business account.
 When that $2,000 hits our bank account for us, that's when we tithe and give on that.
 So any of the money that's coming into the business, we don't even work out if it's
 profit or income.
 We just let it take care of itself.
 And then when it comes to pay us, that's when we tie.
 So for this artist person, you know, let's say you sell a painting for $2,000, but let's
 say the canvas cost you that you're going to go not trying to work out what is what.
 I would encourage you leave it all in your business account.
 And then when you pay yourself out of the business account, that's when I would tithe
 because we're firm believers are not just tithing on our income, but tithing on our
 increase.
 So I hope that helps.
 I don't know if I complicate things.
 Do you want to add anything to that?
 No, I was just thinking about, here's my wondering, and I don't know that this wondering is going to
 help at all in this conversation, it's like, oh, but then does that mean our business isn't blessed?
 Like should our business be tithing? Well, so the reason I mentioned Dave Ramsey there,
 because Dave, I remember listening, we were at a conference and Dave was answering that very
 question. And he was talking about nowhere in scripture, our businesses as entities required
 to tithe. So, your businesses could, we could, out of our end of year, when we sell our account
 for our business, you could tithe off of that. But the way we do is any increase that we take
 out of it. Anytime we pay ourselves from the business, we tithe on that. Like I said, there's
 probably a variety of different ways to answer that. That's the best thinking that we have on that
 so far. If you want to ask us questions about tithe and giving finances, answer like that,
 Go to <a href="mailto:allen@agio.com">allen@agio.com</a>/ask or just reach out to us on social media.
 And we wanted to let you know we're going to be on vacation next week.
 And so we're actually not going to release our next podcast until February 28.
 So we're going to have some time off that with me dancing.
 You know, for those of you who can't walk.
 The vacation dance.
 That was my vacation shuffle.
 You should be careful.
 Anytime you dance, usually you hurt yourself somehow.
 Oh, I thought it was going to go sexual.
 But it did.
 I'm like, I can say every time you dance, you know, I just want to jump you and I was like, wait, no, that had been through my experience.
 Usually you wound yourself somehow.
 I don't have a dancing.
 I don't have a dancing gift.
 No, no.
 So no podcast episode next week.
