<p> Island and AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Welcome to episode 289 of Keeping Up with the Joneses.
 I'm here with the Bearded Wonder, Mr. Alan Jones.
 I love that's my new name.<br/>
 The Bearded Wonder?<br/>
 You had coffee with a friend this morning
 who I don't think I'd seen since before Christmas.
 Maybe.<br/>
 And she was like, I really like your beard.
 I keep forgetting I have it.<br/>
 And then she asked if I liked it.<br/>
 Which is a good question.
</p><ul>
  <li>Do you like the beard?
  </li><li>I do, I guess.
 (laughs)
 I know it doesn't sound convincing, does it?
  </li><li>What's your argument for in a game?
  </li><li>I think it looks handsome.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I don't like it when I kiss you
 that your hairs go up my nose.
  </li><li>Yeah, I don't like that my hairs go up my nose.
 I'm actually thinking of shaving it off.
  </li><li>You are?
  </li><li>No, I think so.
 I might actually just trim it down and see if I can do it.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no, 'cause I remember the last time.
 So a couple, the last time you grew a beard,
 and then you like shaved it down to various horrific versions.
  </li><li>Oh, I wasn't thinking of that.
 I was thinking of like keeping it as it is,
 but like this is right now a three,
 like I went over it with a beard trimmer, a three.
 So maybe taking it down to a two,
 with this like,
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Tiding up a little bit.
  </li><li>Okay, that's okay.
  </li><li>Okay, that's okay.
 Quickly, move from the beard discussion
 to a weekly catch up.
 We've had an interesting week.
  </li><li>We have.
 episode is a week late.
  </li><li>It is.
 And do you wanna say why?
  </li><li>I really like having COVID.
  </li><li>I managed just to be an overachiever.
  </li><li>You are.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>You know, in our family, we've only had COVID once.
 And I thought, you know what?
 Let's go for it a second time.
  </li><li>You like to lead the pack?
  </li><li>Well, let's hope we're not leading the pack.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>I got COVID for the second time.
 And you can still hear, I don't know if you can still hear
 a little rasp in my voice.
 It was so nondescript that I didn't even take a COVID test
 until what, three or four days in.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 I was like, "Dell, why don't you take a COVID test?"
 I'm like, "Yeah, sure, I'll take a COVID test."
 Because I--
  </li><li>I just like to say that the day before that,
 I suggested you take a COVID test.
 And you went, "Is that COVID?"
 And you're like, "The deeper."
  </li><li>I don't, you and I remember that.
 Interchange very differently.
  </li><li>Okay, it was the deep, I must say, your voice
 when you have a cold and it's all deep, it's like,
 (growls)
  </li><li>Well, I did have a voice.
 My primary symptoms, I had a voice that Barry White.
  </li><li>It's not COVID, I don't have a fever.
 I'm like, oh, okay, Dr. Jones.
  </li><li>Turns out, apparently, you can't just guess
 whether you have COVID now.
 I took a COVID test. - I think that's a rule, yeah.
  </li><li>How did COVID went straight into isolation for--
  </li><li>How did COVID?
  </li><li>What did I say?
  </li><li>He said I took a COVID test, how did COVID?
  </li><li>I had a COVID.
  </li><li>Well, the thing is, I didn't have any,
 I didn't have a fever.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It does make me think,
 it does make me wonder how many people
 who have cold right now actually have COVID.
  </li><li>The vid.
  </li><li>And they're not aware of that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I had no fever.
 I had a sore throat for the first day
 and then it went.
 But it's the usual thing, like, do I have a sore throat?
 Just because I didn't sleep well, two nights in a row.
 Oh, look, my sore throat vanished overnight.
 Like I slept and I didn't have a sore throat the next day.
 Then I had the mother of all congestion,
 I thought it was a cold.
 Anyway, turns out I had COVID.
 The way I describe it was I was sick enough
 if I had a job to be off work.
 (laughing)
 I was sick enough to be in bed.
 But not sick enough that I couldn't enjoy the benefits
 of being in bed, watching TV, video, playing video.
  </li><li>Right, right, well put on Wednesday,
 which was your first day of sort of symptoms.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I knew that something goes up
 when about 10 o'clock in the morning,
 you left your desk and you went,
 I just don't kind of feel myself.
 And I think at that point,
 one of the things I'll sidebar on this one,
 one of the things I love about this house
 is that we have a huge guest room upstairs.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>That is separate.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so. - It's very easy for us to isolate.
  </li><li>The second that one of us goes,
 "Huh, I just don't quite feel myself or I don't, you know, whatever.
 We divide because otherwise we both get sick and then you have to figure out which sick
 adult has to take care of the children that are not sick yet, but they're about to get
 it because you're out there interacting."
 So we always divide.
 So it was literally, I think 10 o'clock in the morning when you're like, "I just don't
 know how I feel.
 I just went and grabbed my pillow and walked upstairs."
 I was like, "And we're done."
 Yeah, we're pretty good.
 We're pretty good at isolation.
 So none of the rest of us got it.
  </li><li>Nobody else got it.
  </li><li>No, we just kinda locked you in a room.
  </li><li>Yep.
 Well, I don't really need to come out of the room.
 You would bring me food.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And you would make it like small enough
 that it would just slide under the door.
 So I've lived on craft singles.
  </li><li>That's not true.
 I've made you soups and all kinds of things.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, I basically stay in my room.
  </li><li>Just you had tray service to your room.
  </li><li>I had tray service.
 I have fast internet.
 I have a PS5 and an Nintendo Switch
 in my bedroom.
  </li><li>I mean, what else do you need?
  </li><li>There's no real reason to leave.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
 The other main headlining event was COVID was one.
 The other was we're under a winter weather advisory.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Kids have been off school the last couple of days.
  </li><li>Yes, they went today late start,
 but I was really surprised by that
 'cause there's ice everywhere still.
  </li><li>Two hour late start, which causes chaos.
 But I have loved having the kids home.
  </li><li>I know, they're so fine.
  </li><li>I loved having the kids home the last couple of days.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Probably because I was quarantined in my room,
 I didn't have to be with them.
 But no, I'm kidding.
  </li><li>We loved having them home
 'cause I was dealing with it.
 No, there's-- - It was lovely
 having them home.
 I really enjoyed that.
 Yeah, the weather has been all over the place.
 Our trees look amazing though.
  </li><li>They do.
 Actually, I wanna go take some pictures of them.
  </li><li>I went out to be at the bus stop with MJ today
 'cause you picked up tourist letters.
 And if you just stand still, you can hear--
  </li><li>The crackling.
  </li><li>The crackling of the ice on the trees.
 It sounds amazing.
  </li><li>That's very cool.
  </li><li>And then anything else?
 Like, I mean, my week was inside of a room.
 What was your week like?
  </li><li>Well, I mean, once we knew you had COVID,
 I kind of canceled a bunch of things
 'cause I was supposed to get to see a whole bunch of people,
 but I just, it just in the effort of,
 in case I have it and just don't know or whatever,
 I don't wanna spread it,
 especially since a lot of people I would hang out
 with have babies or, you know, whatever.
 So that slowed down the week quite a bit.
 So mostly I just painted in.
  </li><li>Yeah, you've been painting like a storm.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like a storm?
  </li><li>Is that an expression?
  </li><li>You've been painting a lot.
  </li><li>I've been painting a lot.
  </li><li>I love painting.
  </li><li>If we don't know where mommy is,
 She's in the basement painting and I now have to layer up.
 It's been so cold that I'm layering up.
 Or especially in the middle of an ice storm.
 Yeah.
 Freezing.
 Yeah, so cold.
 I was curious as, you know, I've been out this week
 with the week before and I got sick at the end
 when we, end of the week when we usually record an episode.
 I was thinking about how in one sense our life
 hasn't changed that much because we're still
 pastoring people even though we're not pastors at a church.
 Like most of our week is still spent meeting with people,
 talking to people, helping people, helping people,
 helping people process.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I just thought that was,
 'cause usually when we come and record these episodes,
 I just sit down and open up my calendar and go,
 what was our weekly update?
 And I look at our week and I'm like,
 oh, yeah, we did a lot of that stuff.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>How do you feel about that?
  </li><li>I mean, I feel fine about that.
 There are people we've invested years of relationship with.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I feel great.
  </li><li>They're not equal.
 (laughs)
 He just pulled the strings.
 For those of you listening,
  </li><li>Out of my hoodie and the strings are in equal.
  </li><li>She had one string that was tucked
 and that was off me.
  </li><li>Well, it was leaning over.
  </li><li>Okay, there you go, it's equal, it's perfect.
 Okay, just don't touch it.
  </li><li>I'm fine.
  </li><li>Everything's fine.
  </li><li>I was painting in this shirt yesterday,
 which I shouldn't be 'cause I tend to get paint all over them,
 but I was, and so I tuck those strings in.
  </li><li>When I look over to the part of the basement
 that you paint in.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But yes.
  </li><li>This paint all over the floor.
  </li><li>There it is.
 (laughs)
 But what part of the painting process is that?
  </li><li>It will be.
 The paint that's all over the floor is from this spinner.
 The like lazy Susan thing that I made.
 And like it just peels off the floor, it's acrylic paint.
  </li><li>Does it peel off the floor itself?
  </li><li>It's not self-feeling now.
 But Tia enjoys peeling it off the floor.
  </li><li>You're blaming on that, 13 year old.
  </li><li>So I left it for her.
 Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Very good.
  </li><li>The other thing we did this week
 as we launched the Finding Father Spring School.
  </li><li>We did. - Never mouthful.
 Tell the good people all about the school.
  </li><li>Well, the goal of the school
 and getting to do it together is basically
 to learn how to hear God's voice or sharpen that
 if we already know how to hear his voice,
 experience more of God's love.
 And to figure out together, well, how do we live from there?
 How do we live from there and live in peace?
 So that's what we're gonna do together.
 And basically to join the school,
 all you need is a copy of the book
 and a copy of the teachings,
 which you can get all of that on the website.
 And then you would join me for a live call
 every other week.
 And we just processed together,
 I help you with anything where you might be getting stuck.
 And yeah.
  </li><li>I was looking, we did it three years ago.
 We called it the final final summer school
 'cause you did it in summer.
  </li><li>Yes, yes.
  </li><li>I had a great time.
  </li><li>It was so fun.
 I mean, I looked forward to it a lot.
 And then I got, I got mono in the middle of it, didn't I?
 And you ended up doing a bunch of weeks.
 Yeah, I stood in for you.
 If you have done the school previously,
 or if you've enrolled in the Finding Father video course,
 and you would like to get in on this cohort
 of students going through it,
 if you want to meet with AJ on Saturdays
 for the live coaching part, you can still do that too.
 You should have got an email if you're,
 if you're a previous student of either the summer school
 or the Finding Father video course,
 you can get in on that.
 But for anybody who wants to get in on it,
 if you go to findingfather.school,
 that you can find the links, all the information you need.
  </li><li>So good. - So good.
  </li><li>And it closes February 20th.
  </li><li>February 20th, yep. - So, don't delay.
  </li><li>So our topic for this week.
  </li><li>Yes, ma'am. - Is dealing with anxiety.
  </li><li>I thought that we'd look at anxiety
 from a three prong perspective.
  </li><li>Okay. - So I thought we'd look at it
 from a spiritual perspective.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>I think we'll look at it from an emotional perspective.
 And then I wanna look at it from physical,
 kind of like a brain science perspective.
  </li><li>Love it.
  </li><li>Because I think I know you have been in church meetings
 where everybody treats a subject as purely dualistic.
 It's either God or it's the devil of work.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Which sometimes leads us into error.
  </li><li>Yeah, for sure.
  </li><li>'Cause not everything is a demon hiding behind a rock.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Sometimes we can completely ignore the spiritual perspective.
  </li><li>Yeah. - And I think there's actual wisdom
 when we step back and in year two of "S.O.S.L."
 I remember I started teaching on brain science
 'cause I was fascinated looking at the neurochemical components
 of what we previously talked about as emotional
 or spiritual events. - Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>And I actually be able to say,
 "Oh, look, you can see through brain imaging
 what the brain physiologically looks like
 when this stuff is happening."
 So anyway, I wanna talk about anxiety.
 Think it's super important.
 We were talking earlier, we've both got an interesting history
 with the topic of anxiety.
  </li><li>Well, the other thing I was thinking is
 when you were just talking about,
 I wanna look at it from a spiritual perspective
 and then, let's look at it from these three perspectives.
 I was thinking, well, it makes a lot of sense
 'cause we are actually, we are three in one.
 We are spirit, we are soul, we are body.
 So it makes sense to look at all of those components
 'cause I think often we don't, as you say.
 We just want to assign it to it's bad or it's good or it, you know, whatever.
 I also think there's a tremendous amount of shame for believers around even saying that you might be
 having anxiety. So that's why I love that we're going to talk about it. Yeah.
 Do you want to talk about your relationship with anxiety?
 Well, I was saying it's so funny because we can all have our own perceptions about what we're
 like. And so I actually said to you, this is how I feel I am. Do you think that that's accurate?
 'cause you're the person that spends the most time with me.
 But I would say I'm not a particularly anxious person.
 Like I, that's not my first response.
 It takes quite a bit for me to arrive at anxiety.
 Like I have a hard time thinking of times
 when I've been anxious.
  </li><li>Yeah, I was doing some quick back in the envelope math.
 I think I've only experienced you in anxiety twice
 in my life.
  </li><li>18, 19 years.
  </li><li>Maybe I'm gonna add that to three
 'cause I just remembered another event.
  </li><li>You did? - Yeah.
  </li><li>Which one?
  </li><li>When you were in a payphone
 and you had a family member who was in crisis,
 but I didn't think it was crisis when we were dating
 and it was triggering your old familial patterns
 of being family glue.
 And I was just like, okay, we're gonna breeze right now
 and we're not gonna rush to rescue.
 Do you remember that?
  </li><li>No, I don't remember it all.
 I probably blocked it out.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>But even then, we're talking like less than five times
 in 20 years of knowing you.
 have I seen you anxious?
 Like even in all the stuff that we've been through,
 we've been through a lot, a lot of crisis.
 I think even times when we're,
 I remember one time we were at an airport
 and the plane that we were about to get on landed on fire.
 And I would say we were both very calm in that situation,
 but just watching you, you tend to be very calm
 and you don't tend to go to anxiety.
  </li><li>Do you remember the time we were on a plane
 that was trying to land in Wellington, New Zealand
 and the wind was too high and they tried to land
 like several times.
  </li><li>Only because you mentioned it.
 I've never thought about that.
  </li><li>That was horrific 'cause I can't be like the planes
 coming in sideways and they were like, nope,
 and they kept trying.
  </li><li>But even, you would get a nervous flying,
 which would be different than anxiety, I would say.
 And we're maybe blurring some terms here.
  </li><li>I don't enjoy flying.
  </li><li>You don't like flying and you don't like turbulence.
 Where I'm kind of like, egh, you know, about turbulence.
 So yeah, you don't tend to be a very anxious person.
  </li><li>No, I mean, I think when you said,
 oh, we're gonna talk about anxiety.
 I can think of one solid time when I remember thinking,
 I'm, I don't know if this, if panic attacks are the same thing.
  </li><li>Go and tell your panic attacks, sorry.
  </li><li>But I felt like that's where I was headed, rapidly heading.
 I think I've told it before, but it was when we were going
 to Israel or we were in Israel and we were going down
 to go through Hezekiah's tunnel.
  </li><li>You don't have to explain what that is.
  </li><li>So Hezekiah's tunnel is a tunnel
 that is dug underneath David's city.
 It was dug by two teams that miraculously
 ended up meeting in the middle
 so that when the Assyrians attacked,
 they still had water.
 I mean, it's like this, it's a really, really cool story,
 but you can go down and walk through Hezekiah's tunnel.
 And, you know, I knew there was some water in it
 'cause they said, you know, where like teavos
 something and I was like, okay.
 Or teavas.
 Like sandals, they're kind of like rubbery sandals, you know, that are attached to your
 feet.
 But anyway, so I don't like closed spaces.
 That's part of why I don't like flying.
 I don't think I put tunnel and closed spaces together maybe as quickly as I should have.
 And so, and you, we all went down, we have our guide, Abby, you know, Tiam, J and you.
 you're at your sort of out front and you see what,
 well you read something I never read.
  </li><li>Well, first of all,
 (laughing)
 the thought of what we're gonna do
 didn't sound appealing at all.
 Like, okay, you're gonna go through tunnels
 that sometimes the waters are up to your chest
 depending on the height of the water.
  </li><li>No.
  </li><li>This is what I read in the guide.
  </li><li>I never read that.
 (laughing)
 I never would have signed up for that.
 You will be wading through,
 and then sometimes, like, I'm particularly broad shoulder.
 Like, sometimes men won't fit through the tunnels
 and you'll have to hunch up.
 And right there, I'm like, no,
 this does not sound like fun at all.
  </li><li>Okay, I did not read any of that.
 I just, Raimi told me that it's like ankle deep,
 and it's, you know, you have to do it.
 Never told me.
  </li><li>But they didn't tell you that the water level
 would fluctuate depending on how much rain was in the area.
  </li><li>Yes, but they said like, then it might get up to,
 in places like up to your calves.
 They never set up to your chest.
  </li><li>No, I saw like, oh, it could go from the middle
 of your shins up to your chest, certainly hip height.
 How deep was it for you when you went?
  </li><li>Well, let's back up because you're--
  </li><li>We enter.
  </li><li>We enter.
  </li><li>We get to where you have to see,
 you have to drop down into this hole
 to go into the tunnel and at that point you're committed.
 There's no getting back out, right?
 So you see it for, I can't see past you
 and the kids are in between us.
  </li><li>Are you blaming me for this?
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>Okay, I just wanna know where the story goes.
 But Tia sees it and goes, "Nope."
 Like she's like not doing it, you know, kind of thing.
 And then MJ Luxon goes, "Nope."
 And so I was like, "Babe, it's okay.
 "I'll take them to the dry route
 "and I'll meet you at the other end, you know,
 "whatever."
 And I'm thinking, "Oh, oh God, okay."
 You know, and then--
  </li><li>And I went the dry route, and I'll tell you
 that the dry route was supposed to be the easier thing.
 There's no water, you're still walking through tunnels.
 You know, it's a guide.
 But I have a backpack on my back.
 Not a big mountain even a backpack, just like a,
 You know, like a backpack.
 Yeah. You know, there was times when I wouldn't fit comfortably.
 I did the dry route when I took the team and it's still, yeah, it's a little squishy,
 but at least it's there's a lot of water.
 There's no water and there's light.
 And you're not going to drown. Right. Yeah.
 So there's that. Yeah, go back to your story.
 But Alan also saw the sign that says this is a 40 minute walk in water in pitch black.
 Like they give you this tiny little pen light that you're like, I mean, this,
 Is this even on?
 But when you get inside, it's so pitch dark
 that you feel like you have a flare.
 It's so bright this little time.
  </li><li>I'm feeling anxiety with you describing the story
 on a podcast.
 So you willingly got into a hole with rushing water.
  </li><li>I was the first one and Sarah,
 our guide was like, yeah, you get in
 and then we'll put Abby between us and I'll come last.
 And I was like, okay.
 And I didn't see the sign that said it was 40 minutes.
 So I was like, I can do this, I can do this
 'cause Abby really wanted to do it.
 Otherwise, I would not have.
 but I was like, I don't want, you know,
 Abby to not do it because I'm afraid
 and you know, that whole thing of like,
 okay, even if you're afraid, just do it afraid, like go,
 you know, how bad can this be?
 Anyway, I drop in and it's waist deep
 where you drop in and then you kind of come up with slant
 and it's about knee deep and then it gets
 to about ankle deep for the rest of it.
 But it's freezing cold.
 I mean, we did it in March.
 And so, I mean, it's freezing cold
 And then all of a sudden you're just in this dark,
 and the walls are weeping water.
 So you're just like, I mean, I'm like, oh, okay.
 And so Abby comes in and she comes out, you know,
 of the deep part and then Sarah, and we start walking.
 Well, I'm realizing I'm like forgetting how to breathe.
 I'm so, it's so enclosed at times,
 you're literally hunched over, like I was hunched over,
 and the walls are hitting both my shoulders.
 You mean it's so low that you're out of control.
  </li><li>It's so low, yeah, and a couple of times
 it's low enough that I was hitting parts on my spine
 as I'm hunched over trying to get through it.
 And the water off the walls is getting on your arms
 and all that kind of stuff because--
  </li><li>Yeah, this sounds like a nightmare.
  </li><li>And it's cold, you know?
 And we're on our own, it's not like there's
 a good, a million people with us, it's just the three of us.
 Potential for all the disaster scenarios
 to go through your head.
 I'm just like, I know it's been standing for thousands of years,
 but this will be the day when it falls
 and I've killed my daughter.
 You know, like I, and then I'm like,
 and Abby's just seems to be doing fine.
 Like I'll be like, so Abby, I'm trying to sound calm.
 How you doing?
 She's like, yeah, good.
 You know, kind of thing.
 And I'm like, okay.
 And so I'm like praying in tongues,
 constantly praying in tongues.
  </li><li>Well, slow down for a second.
 What are you feeling in your body as you're in there?
 If you go back to that state.
  </li><li>Oh, I'm, I'm.
  </li><li>What do you feel?
 What do I feel?
 I was terrified.
 I was literally shaking and I was having to coach myself
 on breathing.
 So you're having a step outside yourself
 and soothe yourself.
 So your heart rate is elevated.
 Oh, I'm sure it was.
 Your breathing is--
 Yeah, yeah.
 And I'm literally like, OK, what can I focus on?
 OK, I have this little tiny light
 that even when you're pressing it the whole time,
 it only gives you about two feet in front of you.
 And the rest is pitch black.
 And is your brain readily supplying you
 with nightmare scenarios?
  </li><li>Oh yeah, like, oh yeah, every nightmare scenario.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And of course I'm like thinking of, you know,
 what I'm gonna say to the different people
 that told me to do it, it was gonna be great.
 (both laughing)
 But I was just like, I mean, it was awful.
 And I literally was like, Jesus, just like,
 if you would just get me out of this tunnel,
 like I'll go anywhere.
 You know, like I'm negotiating, I was great.
 And then everyone's like, hey, and Abby's just like,
 she's chatting away with Sarah and they're,
 well, I didn't realize I was basically speed walking.
 Like I need to get out of this tunnel now.
 So we've been walking for about 10 minutes
 and I'm thinking, 'cause I didn't see the sign.
 Like how long is this tunnel?
 'Cause I'm hoofing it through this tunnel.
 And so I say to Sarah, like, and I'm trying to sound calm,
 "Hey, Sarah, any idea how long this takes?"
 And she's like, "Well, I've never walked it this fast before.
 Normally it takes about 40 minutes,
 but we might make it in 20."
 (laughs)
 I was just like, "Oh, dear God."
 So we, I mean, we walk as fast as we possibly can.
 And then about three quarters of the way in,
 we come on the back of this German tour group
 that are barely moving.
 And I got to get out of this tunnel.
  </li><li>You're like, come on, Lance, let's go, go, go.
  </li><li>Go Hans, go.
 And they're all like, look at the,
 you know, you're listening to them talk about,
 they might not evolve in German
 'cause I could understand some of what they were saying.
 No, you can't get past them.
  </li><li>It's single file.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's single file.
 And so they're like walking real slow
 and talking about like, look at this, you know,
 seam of whatever kind of rock in here.
 And I'm just like, this is all my nightmares come together.
 My mother used to make me look at the rocks.
 I don't care.
 I just want to, you know, anyway, at the end of the tunnel,
 there's a guy that's selling t-shirts that says,
 I survived Hezekiah's tunnel, and I still want one
 because I'm just like, yeah, I did, you know.
 And when we took the team the next year, I didn't go.
 I was like, not doing it.
 Did it once, did it for my daughter.
 She said she had no idea.
  </li><li>That you were freaking out.
  </li><li>I was completely freaking out.
  </li><li>Well, I remember, 'cause when you came out,
 you started going through my backpack looking for liquor.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You were like, there's gotta be some alcohol in here somewhere.
  </li><li>Give me something.
  </li><li>Yeah, you looked pale, you were speed talking,
 talking a million miles away, you're claws.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Were digging into me, you were hanging on me for dear life.
 You were in a highly- - It took a while to regulate.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>To regulate.
  </li><li>You were like, all your nervous system
 was fully present on account for.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, and I remember later, we went back
 and the kids just wanted to like, have a rest or whatever,
 And I was like, I need to go walk.
 Like I still felt so--
  </li><li>Had so much adrenaline.
  </li><li>I had so much adrenaline, so much stress
 that I'm literally like,
 I don't care that everywhere I walk is gonna be upstairs.
 I don't know how that works in the old city,
 but you're always going up the stairs.
 But I just was like, I have to,
 I'm still so keyed up from being--
  </li><li>Yeah, sounds like you're right on the edge of a panic attack
 there.
  </li><li>Oh, I literally was saying to myself,
 you cannot lose your mind.
 What I wanted to do was just break down crying and stop.
 And I was like, you don't have that option.
 Your daughter's behind you, you're gonna freak her out,
 you have to keep going, so just keep going.
  </li><li>Well, also thought you can't go back.
  </li><li>You can't go back.
 I mean, and it's dark, I mean, it's just, it's so dark.
 And you're cold, I don't like being cold in the first place.
 So it was just, it was a recipe for disaster.
  </li><li>It's not a good time to mention that this episode
 is sponsored by tourism for Israel.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>How can you imagine?
 Go to Hezekiah's tunnel.
 You'll love it to just kidding.
  </li><li>Okay, well that's quite the primer, Frank.
 (laughing)
 Oh my gosh.
 Well, I don't know where to start
 because as you were describing your story,
 I said that I want to talk about it
 from a spiritual perspective, an emotional perspective,
 and a physiological perspective.
 I think I might start there with a physiological perspective.
  </li><li>Yeah, because that's probably where I was camped.
  </li><li>Well, there's a whole bunch.
 If you look at anxiety from a neurobiological perspective,
 which I am not a neuroscientist, like not even remotely.
  </li><li>You like to pretend you are though.
  </li><li>I like to pretend I'm a physician of any kind.
  </li><li>Yeah, I know, you're just like,
 "Hey, let me look at that, why?"
 "That is what I want to see whatever it is."
 No.
  </li><li>Be that as it may, I am fascinated by knowledge
 and learning new things. - Yes, yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>So there's two neurotransmitters
 that are believed to be involved directly with anxiety
 in the human brain.
 The first one is GABA,
 which stands for gamma amino butric acid.
 We'll just call it GABA from now on.
  </li><li>Yes, please.
  </li><li>And this is what's called an inhibitory neurotransmitter.
 So this helps decrease the activity of neurons.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>The second one that we've probably all heard of is serotonin.
  </li><li>Shall we call it Sarah?
  </li><li>Yes, Sarah for sure.
  </li><li>Gavin, Sarah, they're out for a walk together.
  </li><li>And serotonin helps regulate mood and anxiety.
 Yes. All right. So there's those two neurotransmitter work.
 And then there's two areas of the brain that they think are active or,
 or tend to be overactive in people with high anxiety. Yes.
 The first part is the amygdala.
 And that's probably what was firing hugely when you were in Hezekiah's tunnel.
 Okay.
 The amygdala is a part of the brain that controls the fight, flight,
 freeze response. Yes. Right. And it sounds like you were in all three.
 Rotating, even like seriously. And then that's probably what caused your boy
 to speed up and walk and let's just get through this.
 I'm gonna hold it together.
 You also had, interestingly,
 some prefrontal cortex activity,
 which is the front of your brain,
 which is kind of the administrative part of your brain
 that was taking over, going,
 no, you don't have the luxury of losing it.
 You have your daughter here.
 But stay with your amygdala for a second.
 That's the part that is your fight flight freeze,
 the part of your brain.
 The second part is the hypothalamic pituitary,
 adrenal axis.
  </li><li>It's very short for a bit.
 There is, they call it the HPA axis.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>So the HPA axis is a system in the body
 which is all about stress management.
 When it's activated, it releases cortisol
 which contributes to anxiety.
 So you know how you said, I came home
 because you just wanted to rest
 and no, I needed to walk off all that adrenaline.
 You probably had higher levels of cortisol
 running through your body.
 All right, so there is absolutely
 a physical component to anxiety.
 And I want to leave that aside for a second
 because what we're going to do is we're going to talk
 three of them. And then we're going to talk about an approach with all three in mind to
 helping us deal with anxiety. Oh, that sounds good. Yeah. So there is a neurobiological
 physiological, physiological, yes, of anxiety, for sure. Yes. Let me talk about the emotional
 part of anxiety. Yeah. Our feelings expert friend, Dr. Chip Dodd, who's been on the show
 before wrote a brilliant book called The Voice of the Heart and many others. He maintains
 that every feeling has both a gift and an impairment.
 That when we feel our feelings,
 we receive the gift of that feeling.
 When we refuse to feel a feeling,
 we end up with an impairment that feeling.
 So he says that anxiety is actually an impairment of fear.
 That is when we refuse to be present with our fear,
 when we refuse to feel our fear,
 when we refuse to talk about our fear.
  </li><li>A knowledge it.
  </li><li>When we just push it down, we deny it's there.
 It's kind of like holding a beach ball under water.
 Eventually that thing's gonna spring up
 And while we're suppressing our fear, while we're not talking about it, anxiety is the byproduct.
 Yes.
 Which is an interesting way of thinking about it emotionally.
 Sure.
 But it makes a lot of sense.
 Oh, totally.
 For sure, yeah.
 Totally.
 Now, before I'd done any feelings work, if I was listening to this podcast, I'd be
 firing up an email to myself to say, "Ah-ah-ah."
 Second Timothy one says that we don't have a spirit of fear, but we have a spirit of power,
 love, and of a sound mind.
 Yes.
 Right?
 Therefore, we don't need to be talking about this fear stuff and you know that's all fine.
 just put a bandaid on it.
  </li><li>But what's funny about that is that's actually
 a fear response to fear.
  </li><li>Oh yes.
  </li><li>Right?
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Because if you actually read that verse,
 we can say, yeah, yeah, you're right.
 We don't have a spirit of fear,
 but we actually have power, we have love,
 we have a sound mind.
 Those three combined allows us to be present
 with what might be scary and we'll still be okay.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Like we won't receive a spirit of fear
 by talking about our fear.
  </li><li>Right.
 What was the gift of fear?
  </li><li>The gift of fear.
 So if we work hard and we feel our fear,
 and we talk about our fear and we give space to it
 and we give it to God,
 we actually receive faith and wisdom.
  </li><li>So that sounds more like what that verse is talking about.
  </li><li>Consider the irony.
 If we are actually human and we bring to God
 the stuff that we're scared about.
  </li><li>Right, and by the way, he made us to be able to feel fear.
  </li><li>He absolutely did because fear is actually necessary
 for a safe life.
 you're walking down the road and a line comes out the way.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And jumps at you, you know, your fear kicks in
 what we were talking about earlier,
 you're a little amygdala and your fight flight frees
 as you run away.
  </li><li>Right, right, yeah.
  </li><li>So fear is actually a really healthy thing.
 And actually being able to process that
 and think about that is actually a good thing.
 But when we refuse to do that,
 that's where anxiety is produced
 from an emotional perspective.
  </li><li>Got you.
  </li><li>What's interesting is you actually find
 that pattern repeated through scripture.
 So Psalm 55 verse 22, the whole of Psalm 55,
 David is really emotionally present.
  </li><li>Yeah, he's got to love David.
 He's just telling it like it is.
  </li><li>Fully present with a fear.
 But in verse 22, he says,
 cast your burden on the Lord and he will sustain you.
 He will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Now what's interesting is cast your burden.
  </li><li>That means you have one.
  </li><li>That means you have one.
  </li><li>Right, right.
  </li><li>Right, cast your burden.
 Tell the Lord the thing that you're scared about,
 the thing you're worried about,
 thing that your worry is going to overtake you, which if you read Sam 55, he absolutely
 does that.
 He has that on the Lord and in doing so, God's going to work wonders for you.
 He's going to ensure that you will not be shaken.
 But if you keep it to yourself, if you try and deny it, if you're just moving the opposite
 thing, you're going to end up with anxiety.
 It's funny that you were saying, I was trying to keep it together, I understand for the sake
 of your daughter, but it didn't make your feelings go away.
  </li><li>No, it also makes me think, and this is probably like a,
 just an interesting side note, but you know,
 when he says, and he won't allow the righteous
 to be shaken, right?
 It's interesting that when you,
 when I've observed panic attacks,
 usually there's a whole bunch of shaking
 that is involved in that scenario.
  </li><li>Yeah, both physically and emotionally.
  </li><li>Yes, or how about first Peter 5'7,
 where it says cast all your anxieties
 upon the Lord for he cares for you.
  </li><li>Yeah, it doesn't say deny all your anxieties.
  </li><li>No, it says cast all of them.
 And that means you're gonna have some.
  </li><li>You mean it a lot.
  </li><li>And you can't cast what you're busy denying.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So again, it's like be present
 and tell the Lord about it.
 Why? Because he cares for you.
 To have anxiety is not to lack faith,
 to have anxiety is to be human.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And our solution is to give it to God.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But in order to give it to God,
 you have to be present with it first.
  </li><li>Yeah, you have to acknowledge it first.
 So anxiety basically comes to us when we refuse to feel our fear.
 Right.
 And the solution for that is to actually talk about our fear with the Lord and other trusted
 people to kind of get it out into the light as a word.
 Yeah, chip summarizes as, you know, feel your feelings, talk about your feelings, give it
 to God.
 Yeah.
 And I love that process.
 So good.
 I've been reading Genesis recently and I was reading about Jacob and Jacob is being hugely
 successful in this story. He's been with his uncle Laban. He's worked for 20 years.
 Forever. Changed his wages like 10 times. Cheat him out of a wife, got his wife anyway. He's
 like now done and he's moving and the Lord told him, "As you go back to your kinsmen,
 go back to your family and I'm going to prosper you." And so he starts doing that and being
 to the Lord. But then Esau, his brother comes out with like 300 men and suddenly Jacob's like,
 And you read this beautiful passage where his fear, his anxiety comes to him and he's caught because he's like,
 "Wait, Lord, you've asked me to do this thing, but it looks like it's going to go south."
 But I also realized that actually last time I crossed the Jordan, I just had a staff and now you've given me everything.
 So no, you're going to be good. Oh, and, PS, I'm only doing this because you've told me,
 "Please, please, you know, don't let my brother overtake me."
 And it's this beautiful human moment that I think we all face when we follow the Lord,
 we're going to come into circumstances that feel overwhelming, feel scary, can be anxiety-inducing,
 and the trick is not to ignore it, the trick is to take it to the Lord and set it in its proper
 consciousness. Yeah. Hey, Lord, anxiety is saying this. Yeah. What do you have to say to it? Yeah.
 Which brings us neatly and nicely to the spiritual component.
 Right? So we've talked a little bit about the physical component. Yeah. We've talked a little bit
 about the emotional component. The spiritual component of anxiety is interesting because I think at its
 root, anxiety is always about contesting God's word.
 Really?
 So you look at the very first question that's asked in
 Scripture, Satan comes along.
 And the very first question is, did God really say that you can't
 eat from fruit, the trees in the garden?
 Right.
 Right.
 The first challenge is all about God's word and its
 desires to produce anxiety.
 And we see that it does because as soon as they disobey God, they
 start hiding.
 Yeah.
 And God's like, where are you?
 Yeah.
 Right.
 First recording of hide and seek.
 And that's consistent throughout Scripture.
 That the enemy is constantly asking a question that undermines.
 Absolutely.
 Did God really say?
 Yeah.
 Which, the fruit of that is all with anxiety.
 Yeah.
 That makes sense.
 So God says, where are you?
 He's like, well, I'm hiding because I was afraid.
 Yeah.
 So the first response is like fear, anxiety.
 Oh, God, what's going to happen?
 Yeah.
 And it was all about God's word.
 You see this in the life of Jesus, Matthew four.
 Jesus is led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness.
 And then the devil comes along and asks some three questions.
 Now, to be biblically sound, it only says that Jesus was hungry.
 It doesn't record that Jesus was anxious.
 Right.
 But look at the questions that Satan's asking Jesus.
 They're all about inducing anxiety.
 Okay.
 All right.
 So question one is, if you're the son of God, tell these stones to turn into bread.
 Question two, if you're the son of God, then throw yourself down
 and God will protect you with the angel.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And then question three is like,
 hey, if you'll worship me, I'll give you everything.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>And what's interesting about that,
 the first two questions are designed to bring about anxiety
 around his identity.
  </li><li>Yeah, if you're really...
  </li><li>If you're really the son of God.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And what's curious about this is this is Matthew chapter four.
 Guess what was in Matthew chapter three?
  </li><li>What?
  </li><li>You know already.
 It's baptism of Jesus.
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>Matthew chapter three closes with the...
  </li><li>This is my beloved son.
  </li><li>Here you are, my boy.
  </li><li>Oh, please, yes.
 This is a beloved son.
 Yes.
 And so the very next thing, the thing that is attacked
 is an identity.
 And then the third question--
 The very thing that God just spoke about.
 The very third clearly.
 The very third God just spoke.
 The word of God came out.
 And the next thing, there's questions designed
 to challenge the word of God and to do anxiety,
 if you're the son of God.
 The third question is all about his destiny.
 And I think anxiety is usually about who we are
 and what we're becoming.
 Yeah.
 Think about it.
 Think about what you've been anxious about this week.
 I bet there's a high probability it's about who you are,
 about your identity, what kind of person you are,
 kind of mother, kind of father you are,
 how successful you are, where you are in life,
 where you should be in life by now,
 or it's about your future.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>It's crazy.
 And it's all rooted in trying to undermine
 what God said about us.
  </li><li>So anxiety then is most often about who we are
 and where we're going.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 If you look at Jesus' response as brilliant, it's like it is written, it is also written
 for it is written.
 The best tool to combat a challenge against God's word is God's word.
 Yes, for sure.
 So if you bring all three of these things, the spiritual component, the emotional component,
 the physical component, I've got a list of things, the practical things that we can employ
 in life that will help reduce anxiety in our life.
 Ooh, I love it.
 Let's do it.
 What's number one?
 two are going to go together. Okay. Number one and two are the things that arguably have produced
 the biggest change in my anxiety levels and yet remain the biggest obstacles in my life.
 I know what these are. Number one would be exercise and number two would be food.
 Yes. All right. So number one exercise. Exercise, I think everyone knows exercise reduces stress.
  </li><li>Yes. - Stress is a huge contribution to anxiety.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>But also exercise increases levels of GABA
 and serotonin in the brain, which is good.
 But it's even simpler than that.
 And I know you're gonna laugh
 'cause I've made you do this last couple of weeks.
 Dr. Andrew Huberman, who is a neuroscientist
 out at Stanford University.
 What is that? - I was like,
 do we wanna shorten his name to Huberman?
  </li><li>Maybe it's Huberman.
 Huberman Huberman, it probably is Huberman,
 and I said it wrong.
 Okay. Hoops, hubs. He has this brilliant teaching. He talks about optic flow. He says,
 just even go out for a walk. He talks about lateral eye movement. Your eyes naturally moving
 left or right. The flow of information going past your eyes because of optic flow has huge
 benefits at soothing the amygdala. Okay. And you're like, well, that didn't work because I was
 in a dark tunnel. I couldn't see anything. There was nothing going past my eyes. But it's
  </li><li>It's interesting that what you want us to do
 to get rid of your stress was go for a walk.
  </li><li>You are yes, afterwards, yes.
 And even in the last couple of weeks,
 especially since Scott died,
 there's been a couple of times when you've been like,
 just put on your clothes, we're going for a walk.
 And I'm like, I don't want it or anything.
  </li><li>That's cold as miserable as damn.
  </li><li>It's cold, it's miserable, but you're right.
 Like once we get out, it does do something.
  </li><li>So your exercise doesn't have to be insane,
 kettlebell, you know, ridiculous workout.
  </li><li>Just going for a walk is gonna be huge.
 Did you wanna say something else?
 I'm worried I cut you off.
  </li><li>No, no, that's fine.
  </li><li>All right, number two is diet.
 We know that food affects our mood.
  </li><li>Some people more than others, I won't say who,
 but there is a whole category of food grips
 that we call comfort food.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Yeah, that makes us feel better.
 But also there's a whole group of food that we can eat
 that makes us feel better, but actually makes us feel worse.
  </li><li>Yes.
 Again, if we're thinking about those two neurotransmitters in our brains, right, Gaba
 and serotonin, there's things that you can eat that can actually help raise the levels
 of that.
 That's right.
 We need to feed Gabby and Sarah something different.
 I was going to say, what are you laughing on that thought?
 Just wait, she'll tell you.
 So tryptophan found in Turkey, balls of founded chicken, found eggs, found in dairy food.
 Tryptophan is a building block of serotonin.
 The foods that are naturally high in tryptophan will help boost serotonin.
 Foods that are rich in magnesium help support GABA.
 Okay.
 So, what?
 So, leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds.
 Okay.
 But what's interesting, because I know you were commenting on me and my diet, I found
 that when I do keto, which is naturally high in foods like we've discovered, my mood stabilizes
 way better than on ketosis.
 And it's the keto diet is naturally low
 in all the things that you're allergic to.
 (laughs)
 Sugar, chocolate, carbs.
 Sorry, go ahead.
  </li><li>No, it's just cocoa.
  </li><li>Cocoa, which is the main ingredient of what now?
 What is it called?
 Chocolate, yes, go ahead.
  </li><li>It's cocoa and sugar that I'm highly entirely.
  </li><li>Wait, chocolate, cocoa and sugar.
  </li><li>All right, number three.
 Nevertheless, food is important.
 Number three is sleep.
 I don't think it takes a rocket scientist to realize that when we are low on sleep, it absolutely affects.
 Sleep? Are you low on sleep?
 When we are low on sleep, it absolutely affects all parts of our body.
 Oh yeah.
 But especially our emotional makeup.
 Oh yeah.
 I always, I always, whenever I talk to like new moms that it's like their first baby and the baby's not sleeping yet.
 And so they're not getting a sleep and they're like, I feel like I'm losing my mind.
 I'm like, oh yeah. Yeah, that's, that you are.
 You are because not because of you.
  </li><li>To live this way, you're gonna make it,
 you're gonna make it, but you know.
  </li><li>Do you know that people who are intoxicated
 outperform people who are sleep deprived?
  </li><li>You're kidding.
  </li><li>No, well, I shouldn't say that universally.
 In one study, they found drunk drivers
 outperformed sleep deprived drivers.
  </li><li>Oh my gosh, that's terrifying.
  </li><li>Sleep deprivation is a big, big deal.
 So getting healthy sleep is gonna support
 your emotional and physical well-being for sure.
  </li><li>And did you know, are you ready?
 I can't give you the name, but I probably could
 on a different podcast.
 But I follow a German doctor who said that women
 actually eat more sleep than men.
  </li><li>I don't know that based on--
  </li><li>Because of hormones, for hormone support.
  </li><li>I was gonna say anecdotal evidence,
 but we'll do it for hormones for sure.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Oh really?
 Yes, so apparently this guy was saying that most women
 would be healthiest having between eight to 10 hours of sleep,
 And most men can still be like healthy
 and have healthy hormone levels and boba at six.
  </li><li>Wow.
  </li><li>So that's, I thought that was interesting.
 Yeah, number four.
  </li><li>Number four would be therapy.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And there's a wide, you know,
 I'll put a lot of things under therapy.
 But actually just talking to somebody
 about what's going on inside your head
 is very, very helpful.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>And we can bear witness to that ourselves.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, for sure.
 So there's tons of different therapeutic approaches,
 but just the act of talking about whatever's going on
 in your life will help lower your anxiety for sure.
  </li><li>For sure.
  </li><li>Number five is prayer.
 And we already talked about Psalm 55,
 Kesha Burden on the Lord, or 1 Peter 5,
 Kesha cares upon him, but what about this?
 Philippians 4 verse 6 says,
 "Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer
 "and supplication and with thanksgiving,
 "let your request be made known to God
 "and the peace of God which surpasses
 all understanding will guard your heart and mind. The precursor to experiencing the peace
 that will guard your heart and mind. It's unfathomable, by the way. The precursor to all of that is prayer.
 Love it. Isn't that great? And again, I said that earlier, you can't cast in prayer what you're
 busy denying in life. Right. You have to acknowledge it. Absolutely have to be present with it.
 All right, number six, you taught me this, live in day type compartments.
 Yes, but I would have said it differently.
 How would you have said it?
 Basically, don't borrow trouble.
 Yeah, well, that's the exact phrase you taught me.
 Jesus taught about, you know, do not worry about tomorrow because...
 Tomorrow takes care of itself.
 Each day has enough trouble for it.
 And I remember one day, very early on in our marriage,
 we were talking about something and you said, honey,
 I'm going to encourage you, don't borrow trouble.
 And I was realizing that in an effort to minimize my anxiety about tomorrow,
 I start worrying about tomorrow thinking it was care.
 Yeah.
 Worry does not equal care today.
 Yeah.
 And sometimes weary worry is actually just control masquerading as like totally
 like I'm just trying to be well planned, you know, whatever.
 And it's it's actually worry and control partnering up and yeah.
 But be where your feet are.
 Yeah.
 Ur.
 Be where your feet are.
 I was number six.
 Yes.
 I came to my end of my list abruptly.
 I didn't know how many I had, but six is it.
 There we go.
 I think having said all that is probably important for people to know that we are not doctors or
 therapists or counselors or whatever. Or psychologists. No. So we're just people that are looking at
 the world and looking at the word and seeking wisdom. It's also important to know that anxiety
 is on a spectrum. Sure. And so there is a portion of the population who have very severe anxiety and
 a list like the six things I've just given might not help. Sure. And I'd encourage you,
 if you're in that situation seek help from trained professionals.
 Absolutely.
 Have no shame about that.
 Yeah.
 It's not God's will that we would live burdened by anxiety.
 Yes.
 And anxiety is a feature of life and Scripture tells us how to do.
 But sometimes we need support more than the six-up just giving me.
 And I think often anxiety is seasonal too.
 You know, you can have seasons where it really is, I am now overwhelmed by the amount of negative
 information I'm trying to process and I need help in this season and it doesn't
 say something about the rest of your life.
 Exactly.
 Guess what babe?
 What's that?
 I have a listeners question for you.
 Oh you're turning the tables?
 Uh huh.
 Right.
 Give me your question.
 Alright I will.
 This is my favorite part because you put glasses on and how does the glasses actually
 help you because it all it does it makes your eyes look much bigger.
 Does it actually help you read that better?
 Yeah I can't read it if it doesn't.
 It doesn't look like you can read them with them.
 I can I'm just trying to look around my mic.
 Okay, this is going to be wonderful.
 All right, go.
 Right in front of my camera.
 Read this.
 What's your question?
 Is it a listeners question from Rebecca?
 Okay.
 And it says, not sure if you've heard of the beam of podcasts
 hosted by Marty Solomon,
 but basically he's a messianic Jew
 that's going through the podcast with a theology student
 like a rabbi would with a disciple.
 Anyway, (laughs)
 he really unpacks the Western versus Eastern perspective
 and understanding of scripture.
 So episode one, right at the beginning,
 is the proverbial bomb that the creation story
 is in fact not a story of how the world was created,
 but rather a poetic chiasm, portraying God
 to people who already have preconceived ideas
 of what God is like.
 So it was rather a retelling
 of a commonly known fable, but retold in a way that revealed important, separating truths
 about who God is and what his character is like.
 Okay.
 Thoughts?
 Oh, that's the question.
 Oh, no.
 I was like, that is an essay answer.
 No, a podcast answer.
 Keep going.
 Question asked.
 Oh my God.
 Oh my gosh.
 Sorry, I didn't realize it.
  </li><li>It scrolls. - I admit.
  </li><li>It scrolls. - It's scrolls.
 Yes, it's scrolling. - You can use your thumb.
  </li><li>Scrolling will help.
 Okay, so my question is,
 have you ever heard that the creation story
 is just a poem concept before?
 I know you visited the Ark Encounter at one point.
 And what do you think about that?
 I'm currently leading a house group
 and we are going through this podcast.
 And every week we are like, dang,
 I'm not sure what to do with this.
 I love that.
 We are on episode 10 and we've spent all semester
 getting through 10 podcasts.
 But yeah, I know you guys are great teachers
 and I really would love to know what you think.
  </li><li>Thank you, Rebecca, for sending that question.
 What great question.
 First thing, I want to try and answer this
 in a couple of different ways.
 The first thing I would say is that I don't want to offer
 a critique on something I haven't listened to.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>I did look up the website of that particular podcast.
 the time they had nearly 320 episodes.
 And I realized even if I listened to 10% of those,
 which I'm not gonna have time to listen to 30 odd episodes.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>Still that's just a drop in the ocean
 of episodes that they've done.
 So I don't necessarily wanna critique that podcast itself,
 but let me give you a couple of thoughts,
 starting with a 30,000 foot view perspective of scripture.
 One of the things that I've come to really, really appreciate
 is that before the Bible was ever God's word to us,
 it was God's word to a different people group.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And so one of the things that we've learned,
 and there's some great resources out there,
 I'd direct you to the Bible project
 who I think do an amazing job of this, a textbook.
 This is a tone that's quite accessible
 called Grasping God's Word, another one,
 a famous book called How to Read the Bible for All It's Worth.
 All these things, all these resources do a great job
 of helping you read the Bible with a perspective
 that before it was God's word to you,
 it was a God's word to somebody else.
 So there's going to be cultural idioms, sayings,
 cultural context, political context,
 even narrative context, that us in the West
 may be reading the Bible without a knowledge of that.
 A lot of that will go over our heads.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>So actually having access to people who can explain,
 one of the things I loved when we were in Israel
 was getting a Jewish perspective on texts
 that were so familiar to us in a new light.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>So I love that from that perspective
 of having a rabbi, having somebody who is well-trained
 in a different school of thought approaching the scriptures,
 love that, I think that's really, really beautiful,
 very, very essential and incredibly key
 to understanding the text appropriately.
  </li><li>Sure.
  </li><li>Let me zoom in a little further
 and just maybe kind of repeat myself a little bit.
 I've particularly appreciated the Jewish perspective
 on scriptures, 'cause again, a lot of the scriptures
 written by Jews, two Jews, four Jews for the Jewish people, and me raising Scotland
 without any cultural or historical understanding of that.
 Decidedly not Jewish.
 Decidedly not Jewish as a Gentile. Hugely helpful.
 Getting those perspectives on it. And if I zoom in to your specific question, have I heard
 that the creation account in Genesis is actually just poetic, it's a poem,
 it's not actually be taken literally. Yes, I absolutely have heard that before.
 Sure, so have I.
 And it's not something I hold to for a couple of reasons.
 The first one is I would be very cautious about categorizing parts of Scripture as things
 that don't actually mean what they say they mean.
 Because if we're free to do that with a creation account, what other parts of Scripture are
 we free to do that with?
 And if we make the creation account a poem and not actually a literal recording of what
 happened, how do we interpret other parts of the Bible?
 that reference that.
 So if we think about in the beginning,
 the word was God, the word was God.
 He was in the beginning, yes.
 By him, all things are created.
 Does that poem now challenge that?
 Sure.
 Our good friend, David Campbell, says it this way.
 He says that if you only believe the part of the Bible
 that you do like, and you don't believe the part
 of the Bible that you don't like,
 then you don't believe the Bible you believe yourself.
 And that's the very thing that we wanna get away from.
 We want to get away from being able to categorize certain parts of scripture as well.
 You know, it's this, therefore this.
 I'm a firm believer in the inerrancy of scripture.
 I'm a firm believer that the Bible is without error.
 I'm a firm believer that yes, we do need to read the Bible in the context that it's in,
 but I would be very, very cautious about taking large portions of scripture and saying,
 because it's this, that means this.
 Right.
 with that information then. Like first of all, I love that you're going through this and I love
 that you're asking us for a perspective. Thank you for giving us the privilege of speaking into that.
 I think it is hugely important to be aware of schools of thoughts regarding scripture,
 but I think it's equally important to be aware that we don't have to believe everything we're taught.
 Yes. So for example, I am very well versed in a cessationist theology and I could actually
 They recite from scripture the main arguments of cessationists.
 That's people who don't believe that the gifts of the spirit are for today.
 I could talk about the passage they would use.
 I could talk about the tricky passages of scripture that would seem to suggest that
 they're wrong and I could explain that away.
 But in the same way, I can also, and I'm very familiar with the charismatic theology
 about why the gifts of the spirit are for today.
 Knowing both of those things has actually helped me inform what I do believe.
 Right.
 I don't believe both of them.
 I only believe one of them.
 Right.
 with the arguments about women in church,
 women in ministry, as in all the churches,
 women should remain silent, for example.
 I've talked about these passages before.
 I'm familiar with the arguments that we talk about
 why women shouldn't be in ministry.
 And I'm familiar with the arguments
 about why women should be in ministry.
 And even though I know both of them,
 I don't believe both of them.
 So I don't think there's anything inherently wrong
 with knowing how different--
  </li><li>Other people of you think this.
  </li><li>Exactly.
 I think we have to be careful with what we do with them.
 And I love that you're even asking these questions
 so you're figuring them out for yourself.
 I would not say that the creation account in Genesis
 is merely poetic, merely allegoric in nature.
 I would say it is a description
 of how God created the earth.
 And I know one of the things I loved about my father,
 my father was a world renowned scientist
 and he would get a hassle from the scientific community
 for holding to that.
 And thankfully, I don't know anything about science.
 Like, you know, the whole creation
 versus evolution argument is not one I am bothered by.
 It's not one I wade into.
 It's not one I'm particularly well equipped to defend.
 I just love the Bible and I love believing the Bible.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>And I hope that long kind of meandering talk
 answers your question a little bit, Rebecca.
 Any thoughts, Idya Jones?
  </li><li>I was wondering why you brought up your dad.
  </li><li>Well, I'm just thinking about,
 like as soon as you say that,
 there's gonna be a whole group of people who would say,
 "What about this? What about this? What about this?"
 And my father with a great pedigree as a scientist
 was numerous papers published for him.
 He loved all this stuff.
 This was his hobby, the whole creation,
 versus evolution.
 And as a well-educated scientist, he could explain things.
 And for me, it's not an argument I go into.
  </li><li>Oh, I got you.
  </li><li>Do you know what I mean?
 I'm just content to be simple and child-like and go,
 "I believe the Bible."
 Yeah, but what about this and what about that?
 Yeah, yeah, I believe the Bible.
  </li><li>Love it.
  </li><li>H.E. Jones, what do the people need to know
 as we wrap up.

 He's like putting on beard oil.
 And I'm like, okay, granted, I have my hair up.
