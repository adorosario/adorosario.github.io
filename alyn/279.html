<p> I'll live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 AJ Jones.<br/>
 Yes, sir.<br/>
 Welcome to episode 279 of Keeping Up With The Joneses.
 Yes.<br/>
 We're recording on Mother's Day.<br/>
 We are.<br/>
 And I'm looking at pretty plants on my phone.
 Okay.<br/>
 Put the vote down.<br/>
 Tell good people your fault. What's your favorite thing about mother's day today?
 My favorite thing is the way you got up early and made me coffee and breakfast
 You're welcome<br/>
 But honestly, so least I can do when I think about the fact that you first three children
 At least you can do<br/>
 I don't need my crime we don't need to talk about my accolades
 or lack thereof. I don't like what you're
 stimulating. Tell me your favorite thing
 though seriously but well let's change
 the topic slightly away from any fault
 that could be mine. What's your favorite
 thing about motherhood? About motherhood.
 Yeah. I'm gonna have to go for cuddles
 manna, manna, he and fanna white never
 mind. Like I was giving an answer on a
 game show. Oh I see. I got you. Yeah I
 I like cuddling children.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 It's like the best thing about motherhood.
 You know you can get cuddles from the anytime you want.
 It's not the same.<br/>
 It's actually cuddling that got us into this.
 It is, yeah.<br/>
 I think cuddling would use slightly more dangerous.
 Certainly more expensive.<br/>
 Well, regardless, Happy Mother's Day.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 You're a wonderful mother.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 A serious question.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I haven't opened up Instagram because I know I'm going to be inundated by people's posts about
 what amazing mothers, you know, their marriage to or they have.
 And does it bother you that I haven't posted one this year?
 Like I have done in previous years this year.
 I just, I don't know why I just don't have the fortitude, the mental aptitude
 to say something nice about your wife and the internet.
 Thanks.<br/>
 I don't want to push it too far.<br/>
 I mean, you did do coffee and breakfast.
 Wait.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Now don't touch yourself.<br/>
 I'm pretty sure I also ordered my own mother's date present.
 So what happened?<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 You're killing me here.<br/>
 Let me put you this way.<br/>
 If you want to know who's making dinner, don't look in the mirror because it ain't me.
 Yeah.<br/>
 What did you want to say?<br/>
 I want to restart this.<br/>
 Why I wanted to ask you was, oh, yes.<br/>
 Would you like me to post something to Instagram or.
 Does it do?<br/>
 You're not high words of affirmation, are you?
</p><ul>
  <li>That, well that's entirely true.
 I do like words of affirmation.
 I like to be thanked for things.
 But it doesn't, I don't get personally offended
 if you don't post something on the internet.
 That's not.
  </li><li>That was my impression.
 And I just--
  </li><li>Like if I saw everybody posting,
 I wouldn't be like,
 &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; And posting, posting, posting, making me &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
  </li><li>It just wouldn't enter into my head.
  </li><li>And that was my impression.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 But if you do post something, then I'm like,
 oh that's nice.
  </li><li>No, no, you've already told me that you don't want me to.
 I'm just telling you like what happens in my heart. Okay. Yeah. What if I privately told you because here's the thing every year
 I post a picture and you're like, why'd you pick that picture?
 I like that picture. Like is it the double jin?
 What is it the fact that I wasn't there?
 But this picture made it good. Maybe if you supply me with the picture. Yeah before the day is out
 Okay, I will post a picture because I think my copy is good
 It's just my photo picking skills, apparently, leave much to be desired.
 They need some help.
 Not for me.
 I just think you look great in every picture.
 No, that's the problem.
 Or it's the great thing and it produces a problem.
 Sorry.
 Well, anyway, happy Mother's Day.
 Thank you.
 Happy belated Mother's Day to all of our North American listeners.
 And if you're not in America, you're like, why are you talking about Mother's Day?
 That was months ago.
 Because we have them at different times for Britain.
 Because if you're a kid, it's in March or something, isn't it?
 Or... I don't know.
 You don't remember?
 Well, I don't have a mom anymore, so I don't have to remember things like that.
 Okay.
 Thanks for bringing that up.
 Speaking of moms, I should call mine.
 Okay, good. Good to go.
 All right.
 Give me a weekly update and really it's a bi-weekly update.
 Is that the right phrase?
 It's a two-weekly update because last week we didn't record anything.
 Yes, but if it was a bi-weekly update, that would mean we were going to doing every other week.
 Right. So that's not what we're doing, but we did skip last week.
 We did, which is funny because our topic this week is all about.
 I have a last week.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 It's all about like lessons from landscaping and how they apply to real life.
 And one of the lessons just, you know, this is called foreshadowing, by the way, is it flipping exhausting.
 So tiring.
 So tiring, which life is as well.
 But anyway, let's not jump into that.
 What is your weekly update?
 What do we do in the last two weeks?
 It's noteworthy.
 It isn't the last two weeks.
 Well, we bought a bunch of lawn equipment.
 We're going to talk about that more.
 Yeah, so avoid that.
 Skip all the lawn things.
 Correct.
 OK.
 Thanks for picking up Wives, Thorpe.
 I got you.
 Graduated our in-person school.
 Congratulations to all of our S.O.C.S. students.
 Yes, yes.
 Well done.
 And the online school will graduate in about 10 days.
 I think.
 Nine days.
 What else did we do?
 I don't know.
 It's all been like a blur.
 We baptized nearly 80 people.
 Yes.
 I baptized 26 of them.
 You did?
 In the next morning, I noticed that I had baptized them.
 But to be fair, again, not to jump into our main topic, you baptized them after doing a little
 landscaping, which I think killed your four arms, your shoulders, and your back.
 It's true. It's true.
 And just go braces.
 He does. And he picked yellow bands because it makes his teeth look dirty.
 That's what he said.
 Is that true? Were you there when he picked the color?
 He wanted to pick pink and the, what do you call it?
 the person who's installing them was kind of blinking me Morse code going don't let him pick pink.
 So I steered him into another color and he picked yellow and so it was a choice of pink or yellow. I
 thought yellow was great. Okay great well then it makes him luckily he has dirty teeth. Well he does
 so okay and I didn't know there's so much stuff that had happened and now I can't think of anything.
 I feel like something significant happened yesterday what was yesterday? Oh yeah the um
 Family summer batch thing.
 There we go.
 Yeah.
 We had an outreach for a church and we got visited by
 Scottish weather.
 We did.
 It was cold and drizzly.
 And today's weather would have been much better.
 It's like standing in a vertical puddle.
 OK.
 You're just like constant like a cloud.
 Constant haze.
 I got I made good use of my rain boots.
 But we did have we had like a prophetic tent and a healing tent
 and a dream interpretation tent.
 We did have people come to those.
 MG invited a whole bunch of kids from school, but five of them actually came.
 I love seeing people come from our community into the grace in our orbit, and whether it's their
 kids or jumping on a playhouse, or whether they're a dream interpretation booth,
 or getting prophetic ministry. It just felt lovely to be with people from different cultures,
 different backgrounds, and get to share with them the kindness of God. So it was great bravo to all
 all of our staff and our volunteers that pulled that event off.
 Like that was amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And then I think we just came home and that was good,
 but tiring.
  </li><li>It was in cold.
 So we were gonna, in our minds,
 we were gonna do some gardening when we got home.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>But I had just spent six hours outside being cold
 and died and wanted to do that anymore.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Are you doing the math?
  </li><li>I did a count on my fingers and you're right,
 it was six hours.
 I love when you check my bath.
 Anyway, so I had a hot bath for like an hour and a half.
 I just kept adding hot water.
 But to begin with, I got in my bath at the regular temperature that I use a meat thermometer
 to establish.
 And normally I get in and it doesn't feel hot.
 I just know that I'm not supposed to go hotter or you can cook your innards.
 So I'm like, "Ah, good enough."
 Anyway, get in and my skin was all like, it felt like pins and needles.
 like my skin was burning and it was my normal temperature,
 I think 'cause I was so cold.
  </li><li>It was freezing, I had wet feet when I came home.
 But those kids, they loved, they were not deterred by wet feet.
  </li><li>Did you see how many children were eating ice cream?
 They're wet, they're running around,
 it's freezing cold and they're eating ice cream.
  </li><li>That's childhood free.
  </li><li>There you go, yeah.
  </li><li>All right, well we're so so horrific,
 I'm amazed that we actually made it through a weekly catch up.
 And I'm sure other significant stuff happened.
 Oh, I wanted to tell, last time we were talking
 about our air conditioning unit went out.
 Remember we were recording and it was roasting hot
 and our air conditioning went out.
 I had maybe one of the most interesting encounters
 I've had in a long time.
  </li><li>Okay.
  </li><li>Basically I called a friend or a friend called me,
 we were shooting the breeze and I was just catching up,
 I said, "How's your week?"
 And he said, "Oh, my AC unit just went out."
 And I said, "No getting started mine."
 And so there that day he said, "You know,
 "I went and bought the tools to be able to read your meter
 and I've let me swing by and see what your,
 you know, your meters app or your units app,
 whether it's low on free on.
 And so he swung by, didn't know how to read the meter
 'cause we have a different kind of AC unit than his.
 So he sent a friend who he works with, a copy of that.
 Well, unbeknownst to me, a few days later,
 this friend who I've never met just shows up at my house
 at like 7 p.m. at night and proceeds to diagnose,
 fix and repair my AC unit.
 And, you know, it takes, this is like 7/30 night.
 He won't take any food, he won't take any drink,
 he won't take any money, I'm offering to pay him.
 And this is so random, this is somebody I've never met.
 It's only tangentially connected to me
 through a friend of mine that he had to work with.
 But he just thought, I'm in the neighborhood, let me stop by.
 And so I asked him, I said, why are you doing this?
 And he said, I know what it's like to be without AC.
 I know what it's like to have a wife and kids without AC.
 And he said, I just think that all of us are good at one thing.
 And if we were really good at sharing the one thing
 that we're good at, the world would be a better place.
 That was his philosophy.
  </li><li>That's so good.
  </li><li>And so he fixed our air conditioning unit.
  </li><li>Amazing.
  </li><li>And I was like, are you an angel?
 I had to text my friend say,
 "Is this guy for real or is he an angel?"
  </li><li>Mm-hmm.
  </li><li>So there we go.
 Our week was good, AJ wake up, stay with us,
 stay away from the light.
  </li><li>I know, I'm fading, I'm fading.
 It's Mother's Day and I should, it's Sunday
 and therefore it is what time, what time is it?
 Map time, that's what time it is.
  </li><li>Yeah, we'll power through.
 Okay. All right. Our main topic for this week is life lessons from landscaping.
 Life lessons from landscaping.
 Now we have to fish the open this with maybe like a crowning ceremony that all
 the judgments I've made against my dad have come hurtling through time and landed
 upon me. Oh, sad when that happens, isn't it?
 It's so weird.
 I'm a middle-aged computer nerd who is suddenly a middle-aged landscaping nerd.
 Can we call you a landscaping nerd just yet?
 Or are you like a nerd apprentice?
 An absolute nerd apprentice.
 But what I mean is all of my, if you look at my Google history, yeah, it is not
 searches about new Apple products.
 It searches about the best folding ladder to buy.
 What kind of leaf blower you should get.
 the advantage between this polka extension for a pole saw and buying a chainsaw and i know nothing and so
 where we started is we when we bought our house neither of us have got particularly green thumbs
 correct well i can grow things i just forget about them that's all
 as i said neither of us have particularly green thumbs i for years have had allergy so being
 outside has never been good for me at all. And we, when we built the house, the person
 who owned the house or built the house originally, I think they invested some substantial amounts
 of money into landscaping. So we have a particularly flat trees and bushes. Yeah. Yeah. We have
 a flat lawn, they built some retaining walls, like most of our neighbors, the lawns are
 sloped. And you know, the clearest person put some effort into it. Irrigation system,
 landscape lighting, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
 And for years we've paid somebody to come and do our
 landscaping, trim the bushes and the trees and put down
 fresh, mulch each year and the stuff that you have to do
 that isn't just mowing along.
 Well, I had to let him go after,
 how would you say it delicately, babe?
  </li><li>He didn't do what he were paying him to do.
  </li><li>Okay, there you go.
 And trying to hire new people in this season is insane
 because everybody's slammed.
 And so through, I think just toxic shame,
 I was like, okay, we actually have to be people
 who take care of, actually, I remember what it started.
 I remember already thinking,
 I need to get this taken care of,
 and I was trying to outsource it,
 trying to hire people to do it, couldn't find anybody.
 And then one day I get out of our house
 to go take MJ to the bus stop,
 and I look over our neighbors, our wonderful neighbors,
 and they had just spent the weekend
 tidying up all their front yard,
 their landscaping looked amazing and beautiful,
 and I was filled with toxic shame and thought,
 right, babe, we have to pull the plug.
 And even though we don't know how to do this,
 we're gonna figure it out together.
  </li><li>Yes, you did decide that we were going to figure it out
 together. (laughs)
  </li><li>You showed a mode of come of interest.
 True? - I did.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And so I ordered a dummies guide to landscaping
 off of Amazon.
  </li><li>Yeah, but it's literally landscaping for dummies, right?
  </li><li>'Cause I was calling landscaping for dummies.
  </li><li>Landscaping, yeah, landscaping for dummies.
 Did a little bit of research on the tools that we might need.
 And I can't overstate how much of an amateur I am.
 Like, imagine the worst person ever to do any landscaping
 and they're a hundred times better than I am.
  </li><li>My house plant, my one house plant,
 well now I have two, has nearly died twice
 and I was not involved in either scenario.
 Let's just say that.
  </li><li>I was more meaning.
 I often feel like there's an innate amount of knowledge that everybody has about basic
 things like trimming bushes, mowing lawns, edging.
 You know, that sort of stuff, like the innate stuff that people that men should know.
 I know none of it at all.
 I remember years and years and years ago, when we first moved to America and realized that,
 "Wow, when you live in the south, sometimes you need to mow your lawn twice a week because
 it's crazy."
 I remember our landlord had a lawnmower,
 and he said, "You can just use it."
 I remember being in tears, not knowing how to use it.
 And I remember imagining that all of the people
 in our neighborhood were hiding behind their windows,
 pointing and laughing, because I didn't know how to start it.
 I didn't know that you needed some sort of oil mixture.
 Like it just attacked me in the core of my,
 "I am not good enough at this stuff."
 And I remember one of our young adults came over
 and saved me and they did that for us.
 So part of this was like coming of age story part of this is coming of age story for a
 47 year old man.
 Part of this is like William Wallace conquering over the tyranny that his is overgrown garden
 It's exact pain in my face blunge out freedom, but a lot of stuff has changed by the way. This is this fascinating
 I'm saying the emotional toll. Let's it stay. I understand okay did some research
 Yeah, and found out that nowadays you don't even need
 gasoline and oil and
 two stroke engine things and
 Holy cords and whatever they are
 Things I don't know what they're called
 But they were always noisy always smoky always smelly always heavy and they had a motor in them
 And I think I'm allergic to anything mechanical. Oh, but since then
 Lithium ion batteries have come out and most well not most all the part of tools we bought are all
 electronically powered Jones. Yes battery. Stay awake. Oh, I see you closing your eyelids. I didn't close my eyelids
 I was reading that book over there. This is redeeming heartache
 I'm really alone, I'm really enjoying it.
 Okay.
 And it ties into our story of lessons from landscape.
 It does.
 Wow.
 But anyway, we dropped a pretty penny on some tools that we didn't have.
 I felt redeemed when our neighbor walked over and said, "You picked some good tools."
 Those are the good ones to buy.
 Yeah, if Wes, like, approves of your tools, you're good to go.
 Oh, you know, my man points went through the roof.
 It's true.
 Anytime he comes over and even says anything nice about the yard, I'm like, "We're doing
 a good job."
 I'm not throwing the bus, but I felt particularly good when on one morning I said, babe, we need to put down tarp and you scoffed at me.
 And then that afternoon, Wes came over with a tarp and said, what?
 He said, you know, it's easier if you just like throw all that debris on a tarp and then you can drag it places.
 And I was like, and I let it go. I didn't bring it out, but I decided that slide.
 You liar. No, I rubbed your face.
 Get your face. I knew it.
 the woman that God put me with, trying to talk me over.
  </li><li>But we've made it work.
 I have no idea.
 I know you have five points that you've learned from land.
  </li><li>Well, I've got five lessons.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>But basically, to kind of fast forward,
 this was a big emotional hurdle for me to get over.
 My dad loved, my memory of my dad was he spent
 every waking hour that he wasn't working in the yard.
 And we had a beautiful corner law.
  </li><li>You did have a beautiful--
 where he had trees and he had like a proper garden
 where you grow berries and vegetables and we're not there
 but he also had perfectly manicured lawns
 and flower gardens and a shrubbery and hedgerows
 and trees and all this sort of stuff.
 I never learned how to do any of that stuff.
 So I'm completely close.
 I don't even know the names of half the stuff
 that we've got in our garden.
 And I downloaded an app that promised it
 if I took a photo of it would tell me
 and I think it's lying.
 But in one weekend, we managed to spend
 an ungodly amount of money.
 We managed to spend an Apple laptops amount of money on...
  </li><li>Power tools.
  </li><li>On power tools.
 And I think with my great enthusiasm,
 we thought, oh, we'll do the front garden on a Friday
 and we'll do our back garden on a Saturday.
  </li><li>I never thought that was gonna happen.
  </li><li>That's what I was thinking.
 And how much did we get done on a Friday anacenter?
  </li><li>Just the front garden.
 And we're really not finished it.
  </li><li>We're not even remotely finished it.
  </li><li>Yeah, we've hacked the bushes.
 We've done like a bunch of the power tool-y...
 And we're not even sure if we did that right.
 No, we'll see if they live.
 All right.
 Yeah.
 Well, that's the background.
 We just dove in, clueless, what we lack in experience
 we made up for enthusiasm.
 And both nights, I think we were in bed by 8.30
 after having had ibuprofen and Epson salt baths
 and wondering whether we'll ever regain the use of our limbs.
 Yes.
 That's right.
 All right.
 So you don't know what my five life lessons are.
 No.
 But I've collected five of them.
 I'm so glad.
 Because as a teacher, whenever I'm doing something--
  </li><li>Because I think three is too little,
 10 is too many, seven of them even.
  </li><li>Well, it was again, Wes, though who we need to bronze
 and maybe have a statue of him,
 a water feature in our backyard.
  </li><li>We should, we should.
  </li><li>He came over and he said, yeah, there's a sermon in this.
 I was like, if there's not a sermon,
 there's at least a podcast we do.
  </li><li>Right, well here's the thing,
 if you've been listening to our podcast
 for a couple of years anyway,
 you may remember the podcast where I talk about the fact
 that I had a vegetable garden
 that I thought wasn't growing any weeds for like two months.
 I was like, man, I guess like, you know,
 you just plant it and it never grows weeds.
 And I had no idea that the whole time,
 Deirdro is actually weeding my garden
 at five o'clock in the morning for that whole time.
 So Deirdro is married to Wes.
  </li><li>And Wes indeed relived next to us.
 And pretty much any credit that we can have
 is do them and any errors is all us.
 Yes, she also wrangled the snake out of our tree.
 We have amazing neighbors.
 Yeah, where would we be?
 Yeah, yeah.
 All right, lesson number one,
 which these are lessons I learned landscaping
 that are easily applicable to your life.
 My life?
 Or like everybody's.
 Okay, good.
 Lesson number one is things seem overwhelming
 until you start.
 Oh, that's so true.
 Pick any part of your life that needs to be changed.
 Getting out of debt, losing weight,
 starting a new relationship, finding friends, going back to school, having kids, buying a house,
 moving cities, like all of it seems overwhelming until you start. And I would say that starting
 is the hardest part. And part of the problem, at least for me is my pride gets in the way.
 I don't know if I'll be able to do it. And you just have to acknowledge that being an amateur
 is the price of admission. Yeah. And most things, especially in landscaping. Yes. Especially
 landscaping. We came out. We have these. These are called skip laurels. Is that right?
 Those ones? I think so. I don't know what they're called. You're the one with the fancy
 app. I think they're called skip laurels. Okay. Well, Mr. Bill told me there was skip
 bills, skip laurels, Mr. Bill, who also deserves credit for guiding us in the right direction.
 I should say that Mr. Bill said don't take more than a third off the top of your skip laurels and we took half at least half
 Maybe two thirds. Sorry bill
 The problem is those skip laurels were seven eight feet tall
 Oh at least and I'm six foot. Yeah, and we had a
 what's called a pole saw which is like a mini chainsaw in his drummer and
 those things weigh a lot. Yeah, and try to hold them over your head and shave
 bushes and a straight line that you can't see the top of was insane. So I was like,
 I bet you if we just hack these to the ground, they'll just grow back again.
 And they also blocked tons of light coming into your office, which I suppose isn't
 bad, but also I like to stand in the office and watch the kids bus and now
 with them trimmed down like that, I can actually see. Well also we had two trees
 outside of my office, which we also chopped down limbs. Anyway, my point was
 we did not know what we're doing.
 I was worried that we would kill them.
  </li><li>They seem fine.
 They seem like they're--
  </li><li>Look how many you are now going, they seem fine.
 You were the biggest opponent to me hacking them.
  </li><li>Well, I think I decided, I don't love them that much,
 that if we end up killing them doing this,
 'cause we don't actually know what we're doing,
 I don't actually care if we can put something else there.
  </li><li>And again, once we started, which was the hardest part,
 I'm not sure I'm doing this right,
 I'm not sure I'm gonna do it wrong,
 I'm not sure we're going to get there from my homeowners association saying what blight
 if you brought up on our neighborhood, house prices are plummeting because of you, you
 incompetent number three, right? All the stories that are innate and running through our veins.
 I didn't think of me that. Yeah. Right. I was just like, I'm going to take a chainsaw
 to those ungodly beliefs as well as to my skip laurels. So we hacked into pieces. And
 even though I was absolutely exhausted, there was a joy in seeing some level of progress.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Which leads me to lesson number two.
  </li><li>What was lesson number two?
  </li><li>Lesson number two is very similar to lesson number one.
 Lesson number two is start anywhere to begin.
  </li><li>Start anywhere, that's good.
  </li><li>Because I was like, I don't know,
 we're gonna do it wrong, like should I start weeding?
 But then if I weed, am I gonna have to just reweeding?
 'Cause when I trim and I'm gonna do this,
 but what if that's wrong and what if I should do it
 when it's wet or what should I do if it's when it's cooler?
 It's just like, you know, shut up,
 get rid of your fear by embracing it and just start.
 And what I learned is that progress begets progress.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I think, I don't know whether it's my personality type,
 but I want to know I'm doing it right
 before I start doing it.
  </li><li>Oh, I do too, absolutely.
  </li><li>And actually, if you just start doing it,
 it's easier to move a moving ship,
 or it's easier to steer a moving ship,
 than it is to go, I'm gonna go in this direction,
 but I'm gonna make sure everything is right
 before I start, just jump in,
 what's the worst that could happen?
 And I say that with a week,
 and nothing disastrous has happened yet.
 Yes, but that might be a great theory for all things in life.
 Hey, listen, armchair critic.
 It's the best thinking I've got so far.
 Start somewhere.
 I'll use that theory the next time I cut your hair.
 I'll just start somewhere.
 And we've talked about like my emotional hurdles to getting started,
 that somehow by me not knowing what I'm doing, it's a mark against me as a man.
 Did you have any emotional hurdles with landscaping?
 I don't think I don't think like that kind of emotional hurdle.
 I think it was more.
 I just didn't want to do something that was unredeemable.
 Oh, if I do this on make a mistake.
 Yeah, like what if I like absolutely kill everything by accident?
 Cause it would be by accident.
 Like I think I would.
 I would have probably preferred to either have somebody over that knows what
 they're doing and let them talk to us or watch a
 gajillion YouTube videos or whatever. But it we just
 didn't end up having that kind of time. And then it was
 like, it's Friday. It's two days where the weather is
 good. And here we go. And so I think I just felt like, Oh,
 normally I actually prepare something for parents
 that way. So you jumping in, probably dragged in by my
 enthusiasm, kicking and streaming. I was I was like, I got
 home from therapy and I was like, I was going to rest for a little while before we do this.
 And then you were already outside sweating and you're like, let's go, let's go.
 So I was like, yeah.
 And we very quickly discovered that when you use a hedge trimmer or a pole saw, you discover
 muscles in your forearms primarily.
 You didn't know existed.
 Yeah, I used the hedge trimmer for about an hour.
 And by the time I put it down,
 I was having a hard time getting my hands to reopen.
 And then all of the muscles in my,
 what is this called, forum, we're spasming.
 And I literally like, you're like, well,
 all right, well, help me pick up leaves instead.
 And I'm like, I did not, nothing's working.
 Like, and it probably took a good like hour, hour and a half
 before I could like really start doing stuff again.
  </li><li>I know this will come as a huge shock to you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>But I googled and the Mayo Clinic had an article
 on that because at one point in the afternoon to my absolute shock against my will, my left
 hand's middle finger curled in towards itself and touched the bed of my thumb and I couldn't
 open, I could not open my hand again. It just...
 The bed of your palm.
 Yeah, the kind of the ball of my...
 Yeah, the ball of your hand.
 My middle finger would just close and I couldn't open it. I mean, I could force open with my
 right hand. But basically my arm kind of, not after fade, but kind of turned in again
 it's like, what is happening? So I googled it, I'm like, am I having a stroke? And they're like,
 no, it's just loss of electrolytes and dehydration. And I was like, did you tell everybody what
 I handily did for you when that happened? I'll give you a hand involved ice.
 That's right. You made me a mini ice bath.
 I did. Which you only used for about 20 seconds and you're like, this hurt.
 I was like, yes, it does hurt.
 That's because what the Mayo Clinic said would help is water and electrolytes,
 which you curiously chose not to get me and instead made a bath that the Mayo Clinic did not suggest to get.
 Okay.
 But as soon as I drank some electrolytes and I hydrated myself, you wouldn't even give me an IV.
 I was like, "What kind of wife are you?"
 [laughter]
 I was ready to go.
 The kind of wife that doesn't have a nursing degree, that's the kind of wife I am.
 All right, lesson one.
 Yes.
 Things seem overwhelming until you start. Lesson two, start anywhere to begin.
 Yeah.
 Lesson three is curious. It doesn't make sense at first,
 but it's really true what you can't do can help you or what now what you don't know can help you
 Okay, you're gonna have to I'd none of that makes any sense, right? Okay, stay with me
 What can't do can help you because it actually leads you to humility. So when you start welcoming your shame
 It actually opens you up to receiving help from others
 So at one point we are trying to trim the holly tree and the holly tree is what 25 feet tall?
 even with our gigantic extension kit and the polka,
 we can't reach the top of it.
 And you're suggesting I get on a step ladder,
 which I think you just want my life insurance money.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>Well.
  </li><li>But we really can't do it.
 And sweet Wes wanders over and he's like,
 hey guys, you know what you're doing is looking good.
 And so we were asking what about this and what about that?
 And because we don't know,
 we're literally at the end of our rope.
 We don't know how to do it.
 And so he starts giving us help.
 He comes over and brings us some tools.
 We didn't know we had, he gave us alternate things
 and us embracing what we don't know how to do
 or can't do actually made a springboard
 for other people to jump in and help us.
 Another thing that we didn't factor,
 and this, by the way, this is a discouraging thing,
 that the more work you do,
 the more clean up you have to do.
  </li><li>Oh yeah, that's the worst part.
 Like when you're going around and trimming a tree,
 you're just like, I mean, the tree looks better,
 but now there's stuff everywhere.
 Right, we've got three trees on our front lawn.
 I don't know what kind of tree they are.
 Done there, big trees.
 We trimmed, we pulled out this pole saw,
 which now I want a chainsaw.
 Pulled it out and we were like chopping off limbs.
  </li><li>I don't think I want you to have a chin.
  </li><li>Which is great, but then those limbs have to go somewhere.
 And our city will pick up piles,
 but they have very specific limits.
 We made three of those very specific limits
 on our curb. But we also managed to fill 25 30 gallon yard waste bags when we shoved them in our
 garage. Plus, like a small car is worth of stuff that we piled in our garage because we were like,
 we don't know how we're going to take this to the skip or dump. What do you call it or the landfill
 whatever it's called? We don't have to do it. I think there was 15 not 25. No, you had five
 bag. You had five packets of five. So that was 25.
 Oh, I thought there were packets of three. No, there are packets of five.
 I counted them because I filmed them. Okay.
 And I also sent at the end of each day, I sent Mr. Bill photos of my
 hard work.
 What you had done to me is affirm me affirm my manhood.
 Tell me how amazing I am. The funny part about that is like Bill does
 probably all his own mowing of acres.
  </li><li>Yeah, so he's probably like--
  </li><li>He's like, "Wait a go, buddy."
  </li><li>"Wait a go."
  </li><li>"Wait a go."
  </li><li>He got a couple of bags.
  </li><li>But what we don't know what to do is,
 we've got all these bags that can get picked up
 until garbage day.
 And they're in our garage, like, what are we gonna do?
  </li><li>Well, and the minivan had just died.
  </li><li>So we couldn't dump them in the minivan to take them.
  </li><li>Yeah, 'cause we would have just shoved all that stuff
 in the back of the minivan, but we couldn't do that.
  </li><li>So we couldn't do it.
 So what do you do when you need help
 but you don't know what to do
 is it leads you to humility to ask other people for help.
 So we asked a friend of ours at church
 who was a giant truck and we don't wanna be taking advantage
 of the people who have big trucks, right?
 'Cause that's the curse of owning a truck.
 Hey, could you help me move?
 Hey, could you help me do this stuff?
 But he's got two teenage sons who are like,
 "Hey, can we pay your sons to clean up some of our mess?"
 Which would have taken us, I don't know, half a day easily?
  </li><li>It would have taken a good while, yeah.
  </li><li>And so in about half an hour,
 he drives over back up his truck,
 his two teenage sons get out,
 they clear all of those bags, all of the waste.
 And I'm like, Lord, that's so beautiful.
 The healthy shame of like, I can't do something
 leads us to the help that we need.
  </li><li>Yeah, leads you to community.
  </li><li>Can you think of a time that hasn't ended
 to do with landscaping where that thing showed up for you?
  </li><li>Well, I would say the thing that comes to mind
 that's very similar to that is like when you have a baby
 And the healthy shame recognizes,
 I can't actually heal from this
 and figure out all the things that are new,
 like breastfeeding and all that kind of stuff,
 and continue to make all the food or whatever.
 And that typically is like a time,
 especially if you're part of a church work
 or part of community where people will drop off meals
 every day and that kind of stuff.
 So your limitations actually become an opportunity
 to build relationship with one another.
  </li><li>But it takes vulnerability and humility
 to see the fruit of that.
  </li><li>Yeah, yeah.
  </li><li>You look like you're ready for lesson number four.
  </li><li>I so am ready for lesson number four.
 I'm actually ready for is the nap
 that comes after lesson number five.
 So let's do lesson number four.
  </li><li>Honey, there ain't no nap.
 Look how beautiful the daffod sunlight is.
 Coming through our trees.
  </li><li>It's a busy nap.
  </li><li>We're gonna go out and roll up our fleas
 and do some landscape.
  </li><li>I need anybody nap.
  </li><li>Yeah, well, that first. - One other one
 on Mothering Sunday.
 Lesson number four is transformation is contagious.
  </li><li>Transformation is contagious?
 You got that from what we did?
  </li><li>Well, we started working on our yard
 'cause Mezzan Deirdre had worked on theirs.
  </li><li>Well, that's true.
  </li><li>Like the beauty of their yard
 was a stark contrast to the mass of ours.
  </li><li>And then Mike across the street
 actually suggested that the Bible says,
 Do unto your neighbors as you have done for yourselves
 and suggested we should come over and do his yard.
  </li><li>I'm gonna be pointing it out that that was backwards.
 But the same thing, he was like,
 you know what, you've inspired me
 and he went off to Home Depot
 and he picked up some mulch and he worked on his yard.
 So that whole thing of transformation is contagious
 is a real thing.
 I was watching an interview with Jordan Peterson.
 Do you know who Jordan Peterson has been?
  </li><li>No, no idea.
  </li><li>He is a professor at the University of Toronto.
 Good university great university very sharp man and he was talking about the whole principle which is actually found in Genesis in in in Genesis chapter two.
 Where he was talking about the danger of entropy entropy is let things left to themselves don't get better they degrade right and actually stewardship is required for multiplication to take place right and I was just I was really.
 I was legitimately feeling overwhelmed by the state of how bad our landscaping is and here's the curious thing all we've done is made our first steps attack on the front the back is as bad as it was before and the front doesn't actually look good no moment but because effort has been applied my anxiety about what that looks like has gone away.
 And there's an excitement about okay as I lend my time my effort my skill my labor let's not say skill my labor towards that yeah it has to bow.
 To what I'm doing and produce something that's better than if I just can stuck my head in the ground thought it will be fine repeat what your point was.
 Did it contagious transformation is contagious but I think so I mean gardening aside.
 I think that's why things like the School of Ministry and things like that also work because people come and they go through transformation.
 And when you see somebody else actually going through transformation and having the fruit of something that you desperately want,
 then you're encouraged to go after it because you start to go, "Huh, well, if it worked for them, it could work for me."
 I mean, it's that whole thing, isn't it?
 Yes, a visible demonstration of what you're hungry for.
 Yeah.
 And especially when it's people you know, you're like,
 well, God can do it for them.
 He can do it for me.
 Yeah.
 I think about that related to our feelings journey.
 What do you mean?
 Well, I start going to see a therapist,
 and it's all about feelings, and both of us roll our eyes.
 And then I go to group therapy, which I'm surprised
 you didn't do ocular damage for the amount of eye
 ruling that you did. But you begin to see transformation in me that
 piques your curiosity and moves you from suspicion toward attraction.
 Yeah.
 Right. So you're like, I think I want some of what Alan's experiencing.
 Yeah.
 And I think that would be an example that, you know, the, the
 healthier emotionally, financially, relationally that we get it.
 It salts the water, so to speak, or it salts the oats, so to
 speak to make the horses in our life want to drink water.
 Okay, sure.
 I'm mixing every metaphor.
 Next week's podcast is going to be lessons I learned from ranching, apparently.
 I'm sorry.
 It really is the curse of a teacher that, you know, I'm nothing more than a bumbling
 amateur, but I instantly want to give away everything I've learned.
 And I haven't really learned that much, but we're still working on there.
 You know what's curious is there's some weird people out there
 that when I started talking about landscaping,
 they're like, "Oh my gosh, I love landscaping.
 I would love to come join you and do landscaping with you."
 And I'm like, "I can't tell if you're mocking me
 or you're being serious."
 And they're like, "No."
 The thought of being outdoors and weeding
 and I'm like, "Come on over."
  </li><li>And we will make room for you.
 Number five.
  </li><li>Number five.
 I've kind of already touched on this,
 but God bless is what you do, not what you wish for.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 So that, you know, I was talking about Jordan Peterson, I didn't really have to jump into
 my next piece, he was talking about like entropy.
 And I was listening to what he said and really, really struck me that when God, and I've
 taught on this, I've taught on this with the relating to boundaries, relationships and
 money, but there is a defined flow that we are one, creating God's image, that we're
 two, we're given power and authority and three, we're blessed and supposed to multiply.
 Anytime that we follow that flow, that we do what we're built to do and we govern with excellence, good things happen.
 I, entropy is interrupted by care.
 So if I will just exercise the care that is mine to steward, it's my yard, my landscaping, my responsibility.
 If I will put effort towards that, God will bless that.
 I'm just like, "Oh, I wish God would make it pretty."
 You actually have to partner with heaven.
 just as the same in your life where.
  </li><li>Well, I mean, your easy correlation there
 is things like getting fit or weight loss or whatever.
 I mean, you have to actually step into
 some level of partnership, don't you?
 'Cause it's not just gonna happen by wishing it
 or thinking it's a good idea.
 You know, like, well, I agree.
 And my agreement should be enough to make me skinny.
  </li><li>And you're like, no, it's the chocolate
 that you keep hitting your mat.
  </li><li>That's right.
 acting your will. All right. It was one weekend of landscaping. As soon as that we finished
 recording now, we're going to go back outside and who knows we'll have more lessons for
 next week. But that was some of the stuff that came up. If you happen to be a landscape
 gardener or a master gardener or you have any sort of top tips for us, here's what I've
 done so far. Bob that book, I'm in the landscaping and lawn care sub-read it, my YouTube algorithm
 is now feeding me things like how to edge a lawn properly, how to take care of beds.
 If you have got any tips from your experience of having a green thumb, anything that we
 need to know, if you have a wish list of tools that you have purchased that you're like,
 okay, if you don't have one of these, you need this in your arsenal, we are hungry
 bumbling amateurs who would love to learn more.
 Tell us what we need.
 Tell us what we don't know.
 We'd love to learn.
 Yeah.
 type of person, you know, on your recline chair with your feet up with, for whatever
 reason, a sheepskin rug over you while wearing a fleece.
 It's a fuzzy blanket.
 And I'm dying here because it's so hot.
 If your suds are weird, you look like you're saying in the spirit, give me a listen's question.
 I'm not saying that.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 I'm ready.
 This is a question from anonymous, but I'm actually saying is give me a nap.
 And they're saying.
  </li><li>I have two questions about baptism.
  </li><li>Oh, right.
  </li><li>You're a resident baptism expert.
  </li><li>Oh gosh, okay.
  </li><li>Last time I made you talk on baptism.
 I felt so stirred and I went to my pastor and asked,
 "When are we doing baptisms again?"
 And mentioned that I wanted to be baptized again.
 My leader asked some good questions
 and told me they were uncomfortable baptizing me again
 if I'd already been baptized.
 So guess my question is, what do I do
 if I want to be rebaptized
 but my leader is unwilling to baptize me.
 That's question number one.
  </li><li>I think my first response would be,
 I would pray about, okay Lord,
 well who's supposed to baptize me?
 Or if you're feeling led by the Holy Spirit
 to get baptized again and your leader
 is not feeling comfortable with that,
 then you have two choices.
 You either wait until they are comfortable with that
 or you say Holy Spirit, is there some other way
 that you want to do this?
 That's my thought.
 But it is biblical to be able to be baptized again.
  </li><li>All right, are you ready for question number two?
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>Question number two is, do you have any insight
 into what is a good age to talk to your kids
 about baptism?
 And is there a certain age that it is better to wait until?
 Like when they're old enough to choose for themselves?
 Thank you for all your wisdom and love in this area.
  </li><li>I think 'cause I don't have like a,
 They can only do it once.
 I would say, I don't have an age where I'm like,
 oh yeah, don't talk to them until they're this age
 'cause they won't really get it.
 Like Abby, I think got baptized the first time
 when she was six and she knew.
 Like she was like, I love Jesus.
 You know, I love Jesus and I wanna get baptized.
 Like great, let's do it.
 You know, now she just got rebaptized last week.
 And because she knows a whole bunch more about who he is
 and how she's trying to walk with him and stuff now
 than she did when she was six.
 And she felt like she wanted to do it.
 And so, yes, absolutely.
 You know, I'm gonna encourage her to do that.
 Both T and MJ got baptized at camp last year.
 That was the first time MJ had ever been baptized,
 but Tia got baptized when she was like four, she wore goggles.
 I remember that.
 She was so cute.
 But she was like, I want to be baptized, but she was afraid of going under the water.
 And so she wore goggles with the nose piece and everything like, like scuba diving goggles
 into the baptismal tank so that she could get baptized and not be worried about getting water up her nose.
 You know, and we were like, yep, that's what you want to do.
 That's fine.
 Like Jesus doesn't care that you're wearing, you know, goggles in the baptismal tank.
 Yeah, I think one of the things we've tried to do is not wait until it's a certain good
 age to talk to our kids.
 We've just talked to our kids about everything at an age appropriate level.
 And we've often let their curiosity draw out of us what we're going to answer them.
 So even like with some really mature topics, like, for example, your dad is no longer with us.
 The answers we've given them, we've told them the truth, but we've given them degrees of the truth,
 because you want to be sensitive and not traumatize a small child.
 Yes.
 But we haven't kept that from them, even the question about where do babies come from.
 We've always told them that and scaled it up to what they need.
 And it's the same thing with things of the spirit.
 Tongues, prophecy, baptism, angels, heaven and hell.
 We haven't waited until a certain age, we've just tried to meet them where their comprehension's at.
 Yeah. And allow the Holy Spirit to dictate the pace at which we share with them.
 It allowed them to be where they're at in terms of hunger as well.
 So.
 And understanding.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.

 graduating people from the School of Supernatural Life this past week and
 the online school in a few weeks and so just wanted to bring that up to you if
 you have been a listener for a while you've heard lots of testimonies there's
 plenty of episodes that we have where we've interviewed different students who
 have done the school. But the school of supernatural life is

 with our S.O.S.L. online, you can take the school from anywhere in the world,
 anywhere in the world, whether you've done first year and you would like to continue your journey
 of transformation, you can come back for second year online, or whether you're new to all of this
 stuff. And you've been listening to our podcast and can, man, I would love to learn more about,
 you know, finances and inner healing and the supernatural, the school supernatural life is
 a wonderful, wonderful course we've filmed everything available online for you to take from
 anywhere in the world. I know you just thought I passed out, babe, but it's like choked on the
 chocolate that I ate. I found these blueberry dark chocolate from Costco and they're in delight.
 Yeah, you can take it from anywhere in the entire world and then we also do live calls
 with the online students so we get to stay connected and really help you as you process
 through all the information. And if you listen to our podcast and happen to be new to Grey Center,
 as we have got so many new people who come to Grey Center and you're wondering what the
 school is head up grace and our US slash school to learn all about the school how it dovetails
 brilliantly with a culture at grace and we'd love you to come do the school applications
 for the school's supernatural life clothes when June 15 June 15 so that deadline is
 rapidly approaching it is and you need all your references and by then as well so so if
 you've been pondering what's next in your life have a look at those websites and see
 if God's leading you to do the school but for now we have more lessons from landscaping
 to achieve.
 Sajjajomes, throw off that fleece, that sheepskin rug.
 Let's get transformed into our gardening equipment and go out until the soil and add
 God's multiplication.
 Turn back your...
 Alrighty then.
