<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday.<br/>
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is welcome to episode one seventy five of keeping up with the jones is where this week we're talking about a few of our favorite things.
 Ten things to be precise before we get there let's start here.
 Hey, Jones, how was our week?<br/>
 It was a good week.<br/>
 It was a full week.<br/>
 I love the way your intonation was up.
 It was a good week.<br/>
 It was a full week.<br/>
 Well, I was just thinking it was really good.
 It was really full.<br/>
 It's just it was it was a it was a big week.
 Is there anything you want to give me credit for?
 Um, yes.<br/>
 Go on.<br/>
 You put together a treadmill for me this week.
 I love.<br/>
 I love.<br/>
 that you just don't hit what I'm aiming at.
 No.<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 Think about early mornings.<br/>
 Running.<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 As you're acting in the back.<br/>
 Yes, you ran every morning this week.<br/>
 At what time?<br/>
 At like 6.30.<br/>
 Indeed I did.<br/>
 Ish.<br/>
<strong>[LAUGHTER]</strong><br/>
 What do you mean?<br/>
 It was-- well--<br/>
 Well, by the end of the week, it was approaching like five
 just seven before your butt got out the door.
 But he did great.<br/>
 He ran every morning this week.
</p><ul>
  <li>You are the worst for encouraging.
 I'll have you know, I'm more to the bad formation.
  </li><li>I'm aware of that.
  </li><li>I need a firm.
  </li><li>I did affirm you every morning this week.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>You need that formation now for it too?
  </li><li>If by affirming, you mean,
 that isn't actually verbal or affirming.
  </li><li>I didn't ever grant to you for going out.
 You did when I'd get out of bed, admittedly my sense of social awareness.
 No, wait, wait.
 No, I did not grunted you for going for a run.
 What I grunted at you for is actually slamming the full force of your body into the bed.
 So you're all like, you'll never even know I left.
 I'm going to be quite as a mouse.
 You know, and shake the whole bed.
 I'm like, yes, I had no idea.
 In my defense, we have a new bed.
 Yes.
 And it's a beast.
 It is a beast.
 And so when I get out of bed, I'm barely awake, of course, and I'm staggering through to
 the bathroom and invariably my sense of spatial awareness is not online yet.
 And so I just hip check the end of our food board every morning.
 But at least I didn't walk into the ironing board.
 That was one of the things I was terrified about.
 But it's not that dark in our room.
 You can't see this stuff?
 Well, so says the person who's lying in a slumbering state at 6am.
 Let's see you get up this week and see if you can navigate safely to the bathroom.
 Okay.
 Anyway, I think we were talking about how awesome I was.
 I'm actually up every week.
 We were amazing.
 Yes.
 And you went for a run every day.
 And we'll throw an I assembled your treadmill, but we'll get to that later.
 Yeah.
 So anyway, yes, we were having an amazing week.
 You were talking about how awesome I am for getting up every morning.
 What else?
 Well, you spoke at emanate on raising leaders.
 I did. I had a lot of fun. I have spoken to Emily in forever, but I loved it. It was
 tremendous fun.
 I heard it was very good.
 And then we got a props over some people. We had the wonderful Daniel Helson teaching
 on supernatural evangelism in first year at the festival.
 Yes. And I understand it went really well in the testimonies were just never ending.
 Yes. So that's really cool.
 And then in second year we had our friends Denise and Ginger come in and teach our students
 all about heart sync and do some live heart sync sessions.
 Big.
 them if they'd come on the podcast next year and talk about horizons. So that's going to be fun.
 -And then I bought a treadmill. -Yeah, let's talk about that because that was your
 birthday present. That was what you wanted with a treadmill. Everybody gave me so much abuse
 for "getting you a treadmill" for your birthday. I'm like, "I don't get her one.
 How rude and insensitive do you think I am? She wanted one. Talk to me about your desire for a
 treadmill. Well, I was going back and forth between this Breville oven thing that I wanted
 and a treadmill. So the irony of you are going back and forth between something that puts calories
 in your body or something that takes calories out of your body. Well, in fairness, the Breville
 oveny thing that I wanted is the air, which means it does dehydrate things and it does airfrying
 and stuff like that. So it actually makes it easier to eat healthy. But I was thinking
 about, you know, in seasons where I have felt really stressed, one of my best stress management
 tools has been walking on a treadmill. So I used to just go to Planet Fitness and walk
 for a couple hours when I felt really stressed and I come home and I feel like a lot less
 stressed. And I just thought, actually, I really wish I had a treadmill. So I started
 doing a little bit of research.
 What I think you mean is you've been so inspired by my new levels of athleticism.
 The ice spurge you onto greater levels of health.
 Sure.
 Let's look at it that way if you would prefer.
 Well, let me ask you this.
 Why don't you run in the morning?
 Because there has to be an adult in the house, so I can't go running with you.
 Sure.
 Blame the safety and welfare of our children on your lack of desire to exercise.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 There's a guy to do with the fat and freezing cold.
 Freezing cold and dark.
 It's not dark.
 It is dark.
 Listen, I'm the one out there running through the fields.
 Okay.
 But it's not the guy who teaches our self defense course.
 He says not to run at dusk or dawn.
 If you're a female, that's because he's worried about vampires and werewolves.
 And the one still I don't believe that's true.
 Plus I run with a crossbow.
 Awesome.
 And I'm going to see.
 You see Scottish guy running through the hills of the crossbow.
 You'll know it's out.
 So anyway, you wanted to you wanted to treadmill.
 So you did some research.
 did some research. We started out of the Sweet Home, our favorite website.
 Yes. And they recommended one that I didn't have enough money for. However,
 we looked on Craigslist and found the exact treadmill that the Sweet Home recommends
 for the exact amount of money I had. So we went, we drove to like the sketchiest part of
 the Nashville area, I think that I've been in so far. And it was a big warehouse.
 It was filled with overstock stuff.
 Yeah.
 But it still looks sketchy.
 It did.
 But the guy was lovely and helped us get everything in the car and then we
 brought it back and then our poor neighbor who is probably going to wish we
 could lose his phone number came over and helped us get it inside.
 I put it together for you later that week.
 Yes.
 And it's it's great.
 Doesn't move when you run on it.
 I love it.
 If it did move when you ran on it, it would be more of like a really advanced
 skateboard than it would a treadmills.
 I love it exactly what I read.
 But I just meant like at different places where I've gone and run on treadmills,
 some of them are not the same quality and they kind of really move when you
 run on them. That's all.
 Right. Well, I was very impressed with the build quality and the instructions
 for assembling it.
 And you followed them brilliantly, darling.
 I feel like there's a coded message.
 I don't recall coding any messages.
 Right.
 Yes, on Thursday night, we went on a date.
 We did.
 We went to my favorite Vietnamese place, which is Vuey's, which is so good.
 And then we went and saw Thor Ragnarok.
 Easily one of my favorite Marvel movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
 Yeah, it was really good.
 Incredibly funny.
 Very clever, very funny.
 Great story, tremendous weight.
 I had wondered from the trailers if it was going to be super dark and it really wasn't.
 It was great.
 Despite the fact that opens in sort of like a hellscape with a satanic like figure.
 Yes. Well, it does do that. Yes.
 But the dialogue just removes any.
 So funny.
 Any fear or intimidation from that.
 Yeah.
 And then Saturday we got to celebrate the wedding of a good friend of ours.
 Yes. Sweet Kate, she got married, which is lovely to this fantastic guy named Ben.
 And we got to eat at the Loveless Cafe barn.
 Which is never a bad thing, is it?
 Now, the Loveless Cafe, for those of you who don't know,
 It's kind of like a Nashville staple.
 It's something you need to come and see.
 Yeah.
 The RT Kendall's favorite restaurant.
 I've just declared it.
 I'm not sure if it is, but I've never seen a theologian happier
 than when eating fried chicken at the Loveless Cafe.
 But anyway, they catered for it and they're born
 and it was amazing.
 And the barn is lovely.
 Like it's gorgeous.
 Come on.
 Yeah.
 It was great.
 And then our dear friend, Jeff Daller,
 has been sick for 10 days with a virus.
 He has the poor guy.
 Oh, just I won't go into gory details, but it just sounds horrendous.
 Yes, gory they would be.
 But what that means is I've had the privilege of speaking twice for him because he's been
 unwell enough to stand in the podium.
 And so this morning I did part two of dreams.
 I started dreams last week.
 I didn't mean it as a series, but I thought I wonder if he's going to be better.
 And if he isn't, well, hey, presto, I've got a bunch of teaching on dreams.
 So taught on that.
 Excellent.
 And then you were doing self-defense all afternoon.
 You had a 10 hour day at church today.
 I did.
 Yeah. Talk to me about some of the moves you learned.
 Well, I can show you later, darling.
 You know, if you mess with me.
 It sounds like an invitation.
 I'm going to make signals.
 We, we, uh, we learned a whole bunch of stuff.
 Um, so basically the idea is that if anyone were to, um, come up to you in a
 parking lot or someplace and try and grab you, drag you to the van, any of that
 kind of stuff. It's all of the escape and defense sort of moves to make sure that you
 don't get taken. So which sounds horribly scary, but actually it was really empowering
 to be like, oh, that actually makes sense that you do that. And I feel less scared by
 that sort of thing.
 And all that without the need for a crossbow?
 No need for a crossbow.
 unbelievable. Yeah. But we did get to watch some tasers getting fired and things like that.
 Did anybody volunteer to be tasered? Not this year. Yeah. So this week's a little departure
 from our normal podcast whereby little, I mean a hard left and maybe stopping at a rest
 stop that also happens to be a shopping mall. But basically as we're coming up to Christmas,
 I've had lots of people ask me about, well, not lots. I've had enough people that's made
 me think, oh, I should probably write a quick article on our website about some of the things
 we love because people say, oh, you have this, do you like it? Do you think my husband would
 like it? Or hey, I'm thinking about buying my wife this as a day like this. And so I've
 started this afternoon, I think because I've been starting thinking about Christmas shopping.
 I know there's some people who've already finished it. Don't speak to me.
 Please don't speak to me. I haven't even started.
 As I started thinking about that, I thought about what are the 10 things I've loved using this year
 in terms of material objects, 10 things that I use on a weekly basis that I'm really, really grateful for.
 See, we're kind of combining our Thanksgiving.
 What are we thankful for with our Christmas?
 What do we want to influence our friends to buy?
 OK.
 And then you came in and I was like, hey, babe, give me 10 things that you you've loved using.
 Yes, but I feel misled by you.
 Well, that happens because you definitely have things on this list that are not new this year,
 which is what you told me. Because otherwise, my list would look a little bit different.
 Well, it's a great list of things that you've used this year.
 Yes. Minor, obviously, more nerdy.
 Yes.
 Years are more kitchenery or less nerdy, however you want to look at it.
 Well, that's a pretty good nerd objects on there. But anyway, I'm going to, after this,
 I'm going to compile all these things into this week's show notes complete with links to the relevant stores if what we're talking about you're like
 Oh, I think so and so would love that head over to Ellen and AJ calm slash 175 you'll find the list there ready to go
 Yeah, so AJ given our first three items are identical. Why don't we start there? Okay? All right?
 So your number one item on your list was
 It's an iPhone 10 I
 I know but I was trying to make it fit into a partridge in the fair tree.
 You're beautiful. Talk to me about your love for the iPhone 10.
 Well, I've always loved iPhones in general. I just like them. The thing that's great about this
 is Face ID works really well for me where thumbprint ID didn't always work well for me.
 Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. I need a moment. Thumbprint ID. That just rolls off the tongue.
  </li><li>Didn't you work for Apple Market?
 (laughing)
  </li><li>You mean touch ID?
  </li><li>Yeah, that one.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Touch ID.
 Well, the thing is I served tables for like 14 years,
 so I'm pretty convinced that some of my fingerprints
 are a little bit messed up.
 So it was inconsistent, but face ID,
 because I didn't ever put my face on a hot plate,
 works really well for me.
 So yeah, I like it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>I like the screen, I like the features,
 I like the new camera in it.
 I just, it's a great phone.
  </li><li>I don't mean to be mean by what I say next.
  </li><li>Oh, great.
 Buckle up, butter gourd.
  </li><li>I've had a bunch of people say,
 "Do you think I should upgrade?"
 And depending on the age or the technical savvy
 of the person asking, I'll either say no or yes.
 And what I mean by that is-
  </li><li>Now you've just given yourself away.
 People are all gonna be assessing,
 did he say no or yes?
 Like does he think I'm a techno tart or not?
  </li><li>I just mean, it took me a couple of days
 of misplaced muscle memory,
 'cause I kept touching the Thumbprint ID button.
  </li><li>The Thumbprint ID button, see?
  </li><li>Yeah, I kept going to reach the button.
 And I knew what to do,
 oh, it's looking for my face, looking for my face.
 I gotta imagine if you don't understand
 that that's gonna feel super frustrating.
 And 10 years of muscle memory
 to press a button that doesn't exist anymore
 could be frustrating.
 So I'm just saying, no,
 if you're in that category
 where you get tripped up fairly easily by technology.
 Don't bother upgrading.
 But if that isn't a problem for you,
 I would highly recommend it.
 I love it.
 It's super fast.
 The screen is glorious.
 It's just a win-win for me.
  </li><li>I think it was funny the first night that you had it,
 'cause mine hadn't arrived yet.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And in the middle of the night,
 I was like, where is he?
 He's not in bed.
 And so I picked up my phone and looked at my Nascam,
 and you were sitting on the couch,
 doing something on your phone.
 But because it's constantly sending infrared
 to make sure that it's you.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Right?
 And we have an infrared camera.
 It looked like you were just taking selfies
 of yourself sitting on the couch.
 I was like, what are you doing?
 Come to bed.
  </li><li>That's right.
 The Face ID sprays like 30,000 invisible infrared dots
 to your face to kind of map the 3D version
 of your face to check it's constantly authenticating.
 Is this Alan Jones using Alan Jones's phone?
 But like you said, our cameras at night use infrared
 so you could just see this big white glow.
 Like what are you doing?
 It looked a bit like a really slow strobe.
 So it amused me immensely.
 All right.
 Number two on our list, continuing on the Apple theme is the Apple Watch.
 Well, to give it a proper title, a series three with the thing with LTE.
 Explain what that's about.
 Well, that just means when when we go out running or anything like that, you don't
 have to bring your phone anymore to connect to your watch, you actually have a little
 phone on your wrist.
 Right.
 So if you're out and about and you fall, you can make phone calls from the watch without
 needing a phone.
 Right.
 It also does your GPS.
 You can actually go for without your phone.
 You'll still get messages, etc, etc.
 Right.
 So if you leave your phone at home by accident or something, but you had your watch on, you
 would still have your phone, like you'd still have the ability to make phone calls, send
 text messages, all that kind of stuff from your watch.
 We had the very first generation of Apple watch, which we used for a number of
 years, and I really enjoyed, but good Lord was that thing slow.
 Whereas the new ones are super fast and the battery lasts seemingly forever.
 Yeah, but that was the thing I think that frustrated me the most with the first
 generation one is how fast the battery died where this one seems to last a couple
 of days, which is lovely.
 Having said that, I just mind this with Apple at the moment because the digital crowns
 stopped working, but they're shipping me a replacement model.
 It should be here in the next day or so.
 But yeah, they've just been beautiful.
 Beautiful watches.
 If you have a series two, I wouldn't bother upgrading, but if you have anything
 before a series two and you like it and you're thinking about a new watch, I'd recommend it.
 They're great.
 Cool.
 All right.
 And then lastly, well, not lastly, but number three, I think the last Apple product on there
 is the AirPods.
 pretty good which i think it's funny that it's on your list because they are not yours they are mine right so technically i don't own air pods
 but aj does and i use hers because she's not using six o'clock when
 i'm being an athletic king in going for a run for singing morning but here's what i love wish you could see the way he just stretched when he said that like some sort of
 victor
 from a crusade or something i'm drinking from the keg of glory
 Leaving the house and not having to bring a big bulky phone while running and just having your watch with your air pods.
 Wireless connected to your wrist having a running app on your wrist plus apple music streaming all your songs that's kind of joyous it's amazing and the airport do not fall out of my ear while running which is amazing as well because.
 you have the strange shaped ears to talk about that what you you can make this weird popping sound with your ear because it's like a perfectly round soup bowl kind of scenario.
 I don't know what to say well it's odd here's the sound she's referring to this is from my right ear.
 Okay.
 Do you get that?
 Okay.
 Yes.
 You can hear it.
 Okay.
 Use my last ear.
 Can't make that sound.
 Yeah.
 So.
 I just thought I was a gift from God.
 No, it's just really weird.
 So, but my earpods still fit your ears, which are very different shape than my ears.
 So there you go.
 And having no wires is glorious.
 Or earpods, I call them earpods.
 And these little, you know, little attention to detail things that are really nice.
 It's very easy to switch devices.
 There's no pairing and unparing.
 You can take one of them out and your music automatically pauses.
 I'm taking one ear phone out as the universal, you know, nonverbal communication
 sign for I'm trying to do something right now, but I will pause and graciously
 listen to you, but be quick with your request, which speeds up conversations.
 Hey, do you know what?
 We learned something today at the self-defense course about taking one thing out of your ear.
 Sure.
 Go.
 So he was saying if you're ever out running, particularly if you're running through a
 wooded area or a desk or dawn or running by yourself, which he doesn't recommend in the first place.
 And you don't have your crossbow.
 and you don't have your crossbow.
 He said only run with one ear pod in because you cannot hear anybody who were
 if they were going to run up behind you and try and grab you or anything.
 So he was saying, hey, ladies, please stop running with both ear pods in
 unless you're running in a gym or someplace safe.
 All right.
 So there you go.
 There's your top tip.
 So AirPods for the wind.
 AirPods.
 If you have a commute, the battery lasts forever too.
 Yeah.
 They also double up as hands-free wireless for speaking to people in the car as well.
 And I use it just for playing my music in the car because we have an 8-track and a tape in our car itself.
 We don't have 8-track, I just like.
 The other thing is it's tape and CD.
 You'll often, while cooking, you'll have your iPad up on the kitchen counter,
 your AirPods in while you're cooking.
 There's no wires anywhere to kind of trip you up.
 And the kids can be watching TV and you don't care.
 And you use them a lot.
 I'm really impressed.
  </li><li>I just like that.
  </li><li>Yeah.
 All right, so that's our first three.
 At this point, we divert.
  </li><li>We definitely divert.
  </li><li>Tell me your number four.
  </li><li>My number four is my Breville grill.
  </li><li>Now, explain this to people who haven't seen one.
  </li><li>Well, it's a grill/pinnini press.
 Like you can smoosh sandwiches
 with either flat plate or grill plate.
 And you can also open it up flat
 and make stuff like pancakes or fry stuff on it.
 Like imagine a laptop, the top of the screen goes back 180 degrees.
 You can fry stuff on the screen and on the keyboard.
 Do you like the way all my analogies are computer?
 Oh, it's like, well, okay.
 Well, it's like a sandwich press that goes back all the way to open up into big
 grilling space. Now, you had a Quiznor one, which was like about $60.
 And that when we first got married, you went through about three of those.
 Yeah, I've had two or three of the Quiese-Nart.
 What's the difference?
 Well, the build quality is completely different.
 I mean, when you're talking about Breville,
 the thing I love about Breville is their build quality
 is just phenomenal.
 And their warranty and all that kind of stuff is great.
 So the Quiese-Nart, much smaller grilling space
 or cooking space, much less of a build quality to it.
 And so they didn't last as long.
 Uncompletely inconsistent heat and coils.
 completely inconsistent heating coils.
 Yeah, where the Breville is consistent,
 it's by temperature as opposed to one, two, three, or four,
 you know, that kind of stuff.
 Yeah, it's great.
  </li><li>And it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say
 you could use it every single day.
  </li><li>Every day, yeah.
  </li><li>It's amazing.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Yeah, the kids make their lunches on it.
  </li><li>Yeah, we do.
  </li><li>Put these in just using pancakes.
  </li><li>Yeah, case of Dias, like we do so much stuff with it.
 Yeah, it's a brilliant thing, I love it.
 My number four is not so much a thing rather than a system.
 A system.
 So Sonos is this company that make wireless speakers.
 You basically buy a speaker, you plug it into power and that's it.
 There's no other connection that's needed.
 And it wirelessly streams all of your music over the internet.
 And what's clever is you have an iPhone app or you have a Mac app or a PC app.
 You load up the song that you want.
 can import all your songs from iTunes or I can just play everything from Spotify and
 Apple Music or Google Play or wherever your music is stored and you can create playlists
 and it's modular.
 So you just buy speakers, you need them.
 So over the last couple of years, I've just been adding a speaker here and there every
 time it's my birthday or Christmas.
 And so now we have, I don't know, six or seven speakers throughout the house in different
 rooms who own them in our bedroom or bathroom or living room or kitchen or dining room or
 guest room.
 And it's amazing.
 It keeps all your music in sync.
 So you can have, you can either have a different song playing on a different speaker, or you
 can group them all together for party mode.
 But the sound quality is phenomenal.
 And the ease of use is amazing.
 And I've loved it.
 I highly recommend it.
 For my birthday this year, a bunch of you delightful people all got together and surprised
 me with the Sonos sub, which is a subwoofer.
 And it pairs with the play bar, which is a sound bar I had in our living room anyway,
 and some rear speakers, and it's turned our living room into a wireless surround sound
 system.
 And I just, everybody who comes over and listens to it is just like, man, the sound quality
 is phenomenal.
 It really is good.
 But I love having music.
 Every time we wake up in the morning, we've got music playing in our bedroom, in our bathroom,
 as we're getting ready and then moving through the living room.
 Pentatonix, baby, you love it.
 do have Pentatonix and I have a kill switch as soon as Pentatonix comes on nukes the Sonos
 system. So there's a bunch of speakers that I think they start right now they start 150
 bucks for the small bookshelf speaker and it's a great way to store your home sound system
 one by one. Yeah. All right, what was your number five? My number five is the Coleman Instant Tent.
 Okay, now I had my reservations about what it meant by instant.
 Yes, but it's pretty instant.
 It's pretty instant.
 It's literally under two minutes.
 Yeah.
 And it's up like completely up.
 And it's an eight man tent and it's an eight man tent.
 Well, I don't believe you could fit eight men in it.
 No, but it's it's a big tent and it's it's great.
 Yeah, we bought it for camping.
 I think you were like, I have one chance to make sure that Alan likes camping.
 Yes.
 I'm going to try and remove all friction.
 And this is the tent that we bought.
 That's right.
 And that's it.
 It works.
 It's fantastic. It's a great tent.
 All right. My number five is an Amazon Echo.
 What a surprise.
 Do you remember when I persuaded you to let me buy an Amazon Echo?
 Yes, it was over a year ago.
 It was like two years ago.
 That's what I'm saying.
 You're using things that you said we had to have them within the last year.
 But we use the Amazon Echo this year every single day.
 But I would have had my frying pan and my knives on my list.
 if it was just if we used it this year, but I saved our listeners from frying pans and knives.
 Well, they might have wanted to know if you want to know about frying pans and knives,
 green pant, contact AJ green pant, she'll talk to you all about them.
 I nearly killed your green pandas. I accidentally just walking the light here.
 I accidentally left one of the pans on on the grill top for what two hours. Yeah, it was not
 pretty, but it survived.
 It did.
 I think it survived.
 Well, I haven't used it again since then, but it looks like it survived.
 Let's just say it did survive and never talk about this again.
 So back to the Amazon Echo.
 The Amazon Echo is a strange product.
 You're so wonderfully weird.
 It's an amazing product.
 It's like a cylinder that has got seven or eight microphones in it.
 And it's also a speaker.
 We don't really use it as a like a speaker.
 I know people do. We have a Sonos system, which is a lot better sound quality.
 But it is this, the best way to describe it is whole house Siri.
 So you can just ask at the Amazon Echo with a trigger name,
 which I won't say in case you own one because it'll start listening.
 But you just say, Hey, insert trigger name,
 and then ask any sort of question that you would.
 The reason we use it so much is we've connected it to a lot of our home automation
 devices. So our lights, our doors, our speaker system,
 And we can ask it to turn lights on, turn the Christmas tree lights off, change the temperature in the house,
 lock the front door at night, all that sort of stuff.
 Set a timer, all kinds of things.
 We use it. Our kids use it. Our kids have grown up with a home automation robot that they just speak to.
 How to spell words, what time it is.
 What's the temperature out today so they know how to dress for school?
 They can call us. You can make like audio calls on it.
 So we've used it. Honestly, every since several times a day,
 for the last two and something years that we had it.
 And I highly recommend it, especially if you're wanting to get into home automation
 because easily works with more home automation devices than any similar product like
 what is it, the Google Home or Apple's forthcoming home pod, which will be out later next year.
 All right, number six.
 Number six.
 For me, well, I don't know that there's no cost associated with this, I don't think,
 unless it's minimal, like a couple of dollars.
 But the Bible project study app.
 So the Bible project guys have an app out and it's, you can sort of read through the Bible chronologically,
 but it also has all of their Bible videos that go with it.
 They give you sort of the background and the history and, you know, the context for what you're about to read.
 So I really enjoyed it this year. It was great.
 That's what you've been using as your read through the Bible in a year.
 Yeah. Yeah.
 Yeah.
 The Bible project man. They're doing some killer work. Yeah, they're really good
 If you haven't seen any of the Bible project videos
 I'd encourage you to just set aside some time and get on YouTube and search Bible projects and watch their videos there
 They're just absolutely fantastic. They give you an overview of biblical themes or biblical books their video content is superb
 Highly recommend it. I can't believe you picked a Bible app. I feel so shallow now number six my number six
 is the Nintendo Switch.
  </li><li>Wow, that just tells you so much about us.
 No, just kidding.
 (laughs)
  </li><li>The Nintendo Switch, this is true but sad.
 I've probably spent more time playing with the kids
 since we got the Nintendo Switch
 than before we had the Nintendo Switch.
  </li><li>Well, then in all the previous years with the Nintendo Wii,
 'cause the Switch just seems so much easier to use.
  </li><li>Super accessible for the kids.
 They're all, you know, wanting to play it.
 And it's very, like, depending on the game,
 We were playing, it's very community minded.
 Like it's not just a kid playing on their own.
 They're all helping each other.
 They all want Daddy to watch or they're, you know,
 and they can wander around with it.
 It's this device that can operate in handheld mode
 or docked and plug them to your TV.
 So if the kids want to watch something on TV,
 you know, the other kid can take the Nintendo Switch
 in their room and play it.
 The games are just, I mean, we only have two games.
 We've got Mario Kart and Super Mario Odyssey,
 but both of those games are absolutely charming
 and delightful.
 And you've even been playing the Switch.
  </li><li>I have, I've been playing Mario Kart.
 I haven't gotten into Odyssey.
 I don't typically, that's not the kind of game I like.
 I just like, probably I like Mario Kart
 'cause I used to be into racing and it's just great fun.
 But yeah.
  </li><li>I've had a number of families say,
 do you like the Nintendo Switch that much?
 And I'm like, yes, I highly recommend it.
 I have loved watching my kids play with it.
 They just jumped straight into it.
  </li><li>And they love playing it with you.
  </li><li>Love it.
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And even if it's just,
 even if they're just watching me play it,
 which is a bonus,
 or them playing and me watching,
 they love it.
 And I don't wanna stretch this point,
 but they're learning great problem solving skills.
 Like I'm amazed at their in genuity,
 is that how you say it?
  </li><li>Ingenuity.
 Yeah, they're like, they're just so sharp.
 Although I will admit, last night I was in the church
 that we were in, at the wedding,
 and I was looking around the church,
 and I noticed that there was pillars,
 and one of the pillars had an odd number
 of little turrets on it, and I was like,
 I wonder what would happen if I climb up there,
 and I was like, wait, not in a video game.
 (laughing)
  </li><li>What would happen is security would be called,
 and they would get you off of their pillar.
  </li><li>I'm gonna ground pound that,
 and see if I got a magic power move here.
  </li><li>I'm so worried.
  </li><li>That's as bad as when I was assembling your treadmill.
 I was reading the instructions in the diagram
 was so small, I pinched to zoom on the paper.
  </li><li>I saw that happen.
 It was like, did that work for you?
 (laughs)
  </li><li>What's happening?
 All right, number seven.
  </li><li>Number seven is the Ink and Volt day timer.
  </li><li>Now, admittedly, the Ink and Volt sounds way cooler
 in my head than what actually turns out to be.
  </li><li>No, it is so cool.
 You don't know what you're talking about.
  </li><li>But it sounds like a ray gun.
  </li><li>You don't like anything that's analog.
  </li><li>That's not true.
  </li><li>You just don't wanna write down anything or.
  </li><li>No, no, no, no.
 I'm not dissing the thing.
 You love this thing.
  </li><li>Yeah, it's great.
  </li><li>I've got my ink involved.
 Sounds like a ray gun or something.
  </li><li>Oh.
  </li><li>And then it's like, oh, it's a--
  </li><li>It's not a ray gun.
  </li><li>It's a journal.
  </li><li>It's a day planner, but it's really brilliantly done.
 It has, I don't know how to explain it.
 You need to go look at it.
 It has monthly objectives and weekly objectives and things like that, which is great.
 And then, yeah, it's just, I really like it.
 And you've used it.
 Fair play.
 You've used it all year.
 Yeah, I want to order my next one.
 Right.
 I'll put a link in the show notes and you can go see what it is and why age is so excited
 about Planner.
 Yeah, it's a great Planner.
 It's really great.
 All right, my seventh thing falling on from Nintendo Switch is Super Mario Odyssey.
 Of course it is.
 Right, but here's the thing, it's $60. How many hours of joy is our whole family go out of that?
 Well, I thought I was part of the family and if I'm part of the family, then none.
 That's not true. You've had long periods of uninterrupted time.
 It's true, actually.
 While the rest of the family are upstairs.
 It's true. Last week, there was one day where I think I didn't see anybody for about six hours
 accept to come down and get a snack.
 That's glorious.
 But it's basically a puzzle adventure game that's wide open.
 It is accessible to all skill levels.
 Like I have almost completely done the whole game.
 I think I've got about five paramons left.
 They're ridiculously difficult.
 And at the same time, my youngest child, who's five, just collected 251 moons.
 Now, admittedly, we've helped them.
 Do you eat them?
 You don't eat them.
 your ship called the Odyssey.
 But it's just a light fall.
 It is colorful, it is creative, it rewards inquisitiveness,
 it's filled with moments that just make you giggle with joy.
 It's incredibly clever, incredibly satisfying to play.
 And like I said, you don't have to be a complete fanatic to play it.
 You can drop in, play it whenever you want and leave.
 It's it's scale so well like like tea has not got much confidence playing the game
 She's really really good, but I've just watched as the game coaxes you through each of the levels
 It's glorious if you have a switch I'd really encourage you get super mario odyssey. That's my number seven
 Bring it home, baby. What's your number eight number eight the treadmill now?
 You've owned the treadmill for two days. Are you sure you want this on your list?
 I don't know but right now I'm excited about it and I thought I wasn't allowed to use any of the other things because I hadn't gotten them within the last year.
 I want to recommend this book called the importance of forgiveness by john arne i think you love it.
 Can we talk about knives on the treadmill then i can get both of them in the knives on the treadmill.
 Yeah so anyway i like my new treadmill yeah you've been using it.
 I have you just put your iPad up on the tablet holder yeah and then you just watch an episode of Netflix well right.
  </li><li>I do. - That's genius.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>I think what an idiot I am, I was 6'13 in the morning.
  </li><li>I know.
  </li><li>I just wanna watch a video.
  </li><li>That's right.
  </li><li>It is weird, I ran on the treadmill once,
 I don't think I've ever run on a treadmill before.
 You get sea legs, like I couldn't stand up afterwards.
  </li><li>Well did you just press stop when you were done?
 Or did you actually like wind down?
  </li><li>I wound down.
  </li><li>Oh see I just pressed stop and then I just sort of stand there
 and feel really wonky for a while.
  </li><li>Yeah but even like slowing it down, I was like,
 And it's an artificial experience because obviously you're running and going nowhere.
 Like I found if I thought about what I was doing, I nearly fell over.
 But if I distracted myself, I was okay.
 Okay.
 Uh, I don't have any of those problems.
 I mean, other than I feel a bit wonky because I just pressed stop and then I just deal with it.
 Can you get out of bed and not hit your hip on the footboard?
 On a regular basis.
 You need to teach me that trick.
 Wow.
 I know.
 I'll teach you a bunch of things, baby.
 I got a list.
 All right.
 So your treadmill is on the list.
 My treadmill is on the list.
 I'm enjoying it.
 Yes.
 It's great.
 Here's an item that we bought this year.
 We bought a ton of them.
 Nest cameras.
 Yes.
 Nest is a maker of...
 They started with the Nest Smart Home thermostat, which we've used for many years and love.
 It's great.
 But they also sell these cameras, both indoor and outdoor cameras, that stream constantly
 to the internet.
 It makes some people feel squeamish to think there's something recording you all the time.
 I quite like it. It makes me feel really safe, especially considering I'm the only person that can see the contents of it.
 Right. And it's not like we have cameras in our bedroom or anything like that.
 Do we? Or do we? We don't. No. No, we have them on our, you know, outside our house and then front door, back doors.
 And inside our, the public areas of our house. Yeah, I like it for security purposes.
 It also archives everything to the internet so you can go back and watch it. And bonus, you can make time lapses.
 You do? I haven't made any hilarious time out lapses.
 I'm filled with time lapse of the, you know, the birthday parties that we've had or
 when we were putting out the patio furniture at the start of the summer.
 Oh, right. Yeah.
 It makes me look really busy and effective. Yeah.
 So yeah, nasty.
 And fast.
 You can look at your house from anywhere in the world.
 You can see what's going on. It's great. Love them.
 All right. My number nine is the Anova Suved.
 Oh, look at your French accent.
 Thank you.
 Crayby-ah.
 a merci.
 Ula la.
 Mm hmm.
 Rawr.
 Okay.
 And there goes our French listeners.
 You sweet days.
 Just sweet dreve de gay.
 You are very tired.
 Yeah.
 All right.
 Why do you love the anova sous vide?
 Well, it's just a really fun device, isn't it?
 When you're cooking meat and stuff with it, you would not believe how much moisture
 it keeps in your meat.
 It's just unbelievable.
 taste like you're eating butter. I mean, it doesn't taste like butter, but it's like,
 you know, it's just the, oh, it's lovely.
 That's it. That's all you're going to say?
 Well, yes. I made some pot de creme.
 Look at you, baby. I don't know what to do. If you put those librarian glasses on and
 start speaking French to me, it's all over.
 Podcast over. Let's go.
 Yeah, the pot de creme was amazing.
 So it's quite fun.
 I've done steaks in there. We've done chicken. We haven't done fish. We need to do some
 fish in there.
 We have done food.
 Yes, we have.
 Oh, I stand corrected.
 The idea is that you put whatever you're cooking inside like Ziploc bags and suck the air out,
 or if you have one of those food savers, drop them in some water and the sous vide cooks
 the food in this water at a very consistent temperature.
 And of course, as Edgy says, it locks in all the moisture and then you finish off your
 food.
 It's fully cooked when it comes out, but just for texture, you finish it off in a hot grill
 or in a pan and is unbelievable.
 Yeah.
 So basically if you're thinking about traditional cooking or slow cooking or
 anything, you would sear and then you would cook.
 And with this, you cook it and it's based on temperature and then you sear it at
 the end.
 So it's yeah, it's great.
 It's great fun and it tastes fantastic.
 Does take longer, but the results are worth it.
 Significant longer.
 So we used it more in the summer than we really have in the fall because we tend
 to have last time. But Christmas is coming. I want pot to cram.
 Okay. Thanks for letting me know. Okay. See if there's some way I can come up
 with the paleo version of that for you. No way. Number nine. Yes.
 Phillips Hugh lights. Okay. That's something we've also had for a number
 of years. I know, but I add to every year. So I bought light bulbs this year.
 But that's well, I add knives to my knife collection every year.
 You know what? You can have a bonus and you can talk about your knife. Okay.
 Okay, I'll take it.
 Phillips you lights or I think the first people to have Wi-Fi enabled light bulbs.
 Now you might be thinking, why do I need Wi-Fi enabled lights?
 You don't, but you do.
 If you want to have a decent dance party, you do.
 If you want to have a decent party, she speaks the truth.
 Ladies and gentlemen.
 So Phillips says they started out with these ridiculously expensive $60 bulbs and they've now released much cheaper.
 You can buy like the white light bulbs for around $15.
 You can buy starter kits for about $100.
 And basically, what you do is you buy this starter kit.
 It usually comes with a hub that just plugs into your wireless
 router and then maybe three light bulbs.
 You name the light bulbs.
 You set them up in an app.
 And then you can speak to your phone.
 You can say things like, hey, Siri, turn on this particular
 room or that particular room.
 Or if you have an Amazon Echo, you can speak to it and just
 say turn on the living room lights or turn off the kitchen
 light. And I've tried a variety of different light bulbs over the years, some cheap, some
 really expensive, hands down, the best quality have been the Philips Hue bulbs, super reliable,
 super consistent, no glitches, amazing. And again, this is the type of thing that for
 the last four or five years, I've just been buying a couple of light bulbs every Christmas
 and every birthday until almost all of our light bulbs are our Phillips you certainly
 downstairs certainly yeah upstairs all the kids bedrooms now when you say name the light
 bulbs this is what went through my head I shall call you Bob and I shall call you Frank
 and I shall call you Philip but what you actually mean is name the rooms of the light bulbs are
 in well you actually name the light bulbs so like in our office right now I have office
 office, office two, office three, office four, and they're in a group called office.
 So if I say, hey, sir, you turn off the office lights, our lights go off.
 Right.
 Hey, sir, you turn on the office lights to 100%.
 And so you can set them to wake up like all our kids wake up in the morning with the lights
 gradually dimming up.
 We go to bed with our lights dimming down.
 You can get really advanced.
 You can connect them to your home automation system, but they're just tremendous.
 And again, they're super modular.
 So you can probably plus they last about 22 years
 and they cost hardly anything to run because they're LEDs.
 So highly recommend Philips Hue lights for the win.
  </li><li>&acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf; Philips Hue for the win &acirc;<sup>TM</sup>&ordf;
  </li><li>All right, your last item, AJ Jones.
  </li><li>My last item before my bonus item.
  </li><li>Uh-huh.
  </li><li>Is Kitan for iPad.
  </li><li>Which is?
  </li><li>It is the game Settlers of Kitan,
 but it's on both my iPad and my phone actually.
  </li><li>So you don't need friends to play with?
  </li><li>You don't, you can.
 And I occasionally do play against friends online.
 Well, me not playing the game,
 but because I have a hard time being ruthless with friends
 and I much prefer to play ruthless.
  </li><li>Have I played a monopoly deal with you
 and considering I'm the closest human being to you alive,
 I would be my testament that you have no problem
 being ruthless.
 Well, that's different.
 I do.
 Sometimes I feel bad.
 I'd probably be able to beat you without feeling bad, you know, because I know that,
 you know, probably wouldn't bother you.
 You would have to beat me first to determine whether you feel bad about her.
 Well, maybe you'll have to play guitar first.
 Well, yeah, I was talking about monopoly deal.
 I've beaten you several times.
 Don't even don't even to looted woman, but you digress.
 Uh-huh. So I, uh, I play Kataan on iPad. I don't think every day, but, but several times a week.
 It's your little unwind. It's my unwind. Yeah. Like if, if you were to go and play the Mario game or,
 you know, watch YouTube videos or whatever, this would be how I would sort of unwind so that I can
 go to sleep unless I lose. And then I have to play another game because I can't go to bed having
 just lost a game. No, you frequently turn off the, I say, can I turn on flights? You're like, not yet. I am not yet Lord of Catan. Okay. Okay. It's very important. You can just call me LLC for short.
 My last item, my final item should really be the first item because it is the thing upon which almost everything else on my list depends on. It is the ERO.
 The Lord. Oh, it is the hero Wi-Fi router system. We upgraded our Wi-Fi router to Eros when we
 bought this house. And we have had rock solid, super fast internet ever since. Basically, what
 Ero does is it replaces your Wi-Fi router in your house. The traditional model is you would just buy
 a Wi-Fi router, or one would come bundled with your cable company. You'd put it as close to the
 the center of your house as possible, and that you would hope that as you moved further
 away from it, perhaps your bedroom or upstairs, yeah sure the signal gets a little bit weaker,
 but you just put up with it. And so if you go to Best Buy, you will see hideous versions
 of people trying to mitigate signal loss. And you end up with these like alien shaped
 Wi-Fi routers with like nine antennas, looking like a mohawk and going in every direction.
 Eero has a much better solution. What they do is rather than having one Wi-Fi router,
 you have a bunch of them. You have one beside your cable modem, and then you have others
 that just plug into an electrical outlet around your house. And what happens is you end up
 forming a huge mesh network so that Wi-Fi is available all through your house. They
 are a little on the pricey end, but given pretty much everything in modern life depends
 on having good, solid, stable Wi-Fi. I highly recommend them. It's going to be one of the
 best upgrades you're going to do this year. It's one of those weird things that you're
 throwing money at something you will never notice. You'll be grateful for it. But honestly,
 how many times have you complained this week about your Wi-Fi being bad? Eero makes all
 of that go away. They are constantly updating the software for it. It's just hassle-free
 Wi-Fi and I highly recommend it and they're not paying me to say that.
 All right.
 And my bonus one, number 11, may be my icon classic with stuffed knives.
 What is so good about these knives?
 They're just beautiful knives.
 They, they're really weighted really well.
 I have several friends that are quite into knives and into cooking and stuff like that.
 And when they use them, they all comment on, and how well they fit in your hand and
 how nicely weighted they are. They're just lovely nights.
 They are also fairly expensive.
 They're expensive. Well, I've been collecting them for six, six years,
 five years, something like that.
 Every year for Christmas or for a birthday you put together,
 your Williams and Sonoma vouchers and buy a knife.
 Yes. Meanwhile, I'm gathering my best buyer Amazon vouchers and buying a light bulb.
 Well, no, you would get several light bulbs for the price of one of these.
 Slowly but surely we're building our collection.
 We're working on it.
 I'm going to have my set.
 So there you go.
 Hope that was helpful and/or fun.
 Hopefully this year you can upgrade the lives of you or your loved ones to some quality
 Alan and AJ life tested products.
 And granted, I think a lot of the things that we've mentioned are quite expensive or can
 be expensive, some of them.
 I guess our whole, the way we do stuff is we collect or we save until we have enough
 for the one thing that we want. Does that make sense?
 Yeah, I'd rather have less quality products than more inferior products.
 Yeah.
 Because you're...
 Which leads to less frustration.
 Yeah, because you're buying things that are hopefully going to last way longer.
 Yeah.
 I'm all about reducing friction from life. So, there you go. There's our friction-free top 10 list.
 A bonus one from AJ. I have a listeners question here,
 but I'm realizing we've been talking for almost an hour.
 Yes.
 And we have errands to run before tonight is over.
 I still need to get groceries too.
 All right. Oh my gosh.
 All right. Well, thank you so much for joining us.
 If you'd like the show notes for everything we've talked about this week,
 including links to the products that we mentioned, head over to Alan and AJ.com/175.
 And until next week, stay safe, have fun, be happy.
