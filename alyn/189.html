<p> I live in a j's podcast for monday most wonderful show is keeping up with the jones is a j jones yes sir how the heck are you.
 I am well I think but still slightly under the weather you are in fact one of the things that i was thinking about reviewing our week is you've been sick this week i have but we haven't said welcome to episode one eighty nine.
 We can't just did okay welcome episode one eighty nine it's Easter Sunday it is and so this week we're going to be talking about the resurrection of Jesus Christ in a minute.
 Yes right now we're back to my cold or something so this time last week.
 You went to the doctor's well not this time because it's nine p.m.
 But seven days ago you went to the doctor yes because you're eighty two year old mother was arriving town yes and I just thought I want to make sure I'm not contagious.
 Answer the daughter ransom test on you.
 You weren't sick.<br/>
 Yeah, so he said it's probably just allergies because everything's in bloom.
 Or perhaps it's a minor cold.<br/>
 I have never known allergies require people to take time off work.
 Yeah, I don't think it was allergies.<br/>
 I took two days off work this week, but I mean, nobody else has gotten sick from me, which is great.
 I know.<br/>
 I'm tired. It's the great outdoors.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 You need to acclimate yourself like me, you know, go side, go camping, hiking, stuff like that.
 Yes, we should all take a leaf out of your book.
 [laughter]<br/>
 Last week I was very excited because I'd finished Zelda.
 Yes.<br/>
 This week I finished our taxes.<br/>
 You did?<br/>
 I'm not sure which one I felt required more endurance.
 I would say more time was put into Zelda than taxes.
 I don't know. It was certainly more stressful.
 Really?<br/>
 Well, yeah, I mean, in one sense, I don't really do anything.
 We just meet with our accountant,<br/>
 but the accountant can only do so much according to the data that we give him.
 Yeah.<br/>
 It's a huge, this week was very, very busy.
 So the amount of time I had to collate all the data and give it to him.
 But thankfully we've been working with him for like four years now.
 So I have a spreadsheet that is all set up.
 Of course you do, darling.<br/>
 But still I take it super seriously.<br/>
 So it's really...<br/>
 I would say you do spend a good 15 hours accumulating all the information from it.
 Which is the fastest I've ever done it.
 Yeah.<br/>
 And every year I'm like, I need to get better at record-keeping for next year.
 And then by the time I've done this year's, I'm exhausted.
 I'm like, ah, we'll deal with it next year.
 But I got out of his office and I had adrenaline fatigue.
 I was like, "Yes."<br/>
 But, I mean, right enough, I had a busy week, stayed up late, lots of nights, got up really
 early and plowed through stuff.<br/>
 But nevertheless, Zelda one week taxes the next.
 But you know what that means?<br/>
 It means... what does it mean?<br/>
 It means I can start Zelda in Master mode.
 You did start Zelda in Master mode.<br/>
 Are you trying to pretend that you didn't?
 a reward for my endurance and my hard work.
 Yes.<br/>
 We'll talk about that a future date.<br/>
 Okay.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Tim, about the beginning of the week, your mom came into town.
 Yep.<br/>
 Mom, my mom's 82.<br/>
 She drove here from Canada.<br/>
 So she drives seven hours, then waits, then seven more hours, you know, with a nap
 or sleep in between.<br/>
 I'm hoping she's sleeping and I just waiting for the sun to come up.
 Well, I guess I'm thinking in Zelda now, just wait, sit by the fire.
 And in the morning, start running around again.
 Um, yeah, so she got here on Sunday night and which was good because Monday I was like just out of it.
 I just slept and rested.<br/>
 And got a blast.<br/>
 I shouldn't go to the kids.<br/>
 She did.<br/>
 She played with them and read to them and did numbers and letters.
 And the kids are thrilled because of the remind me she's our only living grandparent.
 Yes.<br/>
 He came to me and said, can I get a new nana and grandpa?
 Like I don't know if she thinks we could purchase them somewhere.
 I think Amazon Prime has them.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 Two day shipping that she'd be here no problem.
 Do you order the accent, especially?<br/>
 Yeah, it's an add-on.<br/>
 It's pretty cool.<br/>
 Poor little chicken, but they're loving having your mom here.
 They are.<br/>
 It was helped by the fact that she brought a bunch of Canadian chocolate with her.
 She did.<br/>
 But I'll see your Canadian chocolate and raise you the mother load of goods from
 Great Britain that we got today.<br/>
 Seriously, and there's more to come tomorrow.
 Why?<br/>
 Because I know some other people that brought us chocolate.
 we have had teams in Scotland and in England on our reach all of our students came back this week
 fy which was amazing yes i know you know that i'm just like yes i did know that yes thank you but
 we had teams in Scotland and England and god bless them they have brought back spoils but not
 only that friend of the show mr christ law is in national this week for wedding and he lives in
 England and before he came out he said hey you know is there anything i could bring over and i just
 He's gave him a list like a ridiculously long list.
 Just thinking here's a sample to come.
 Like pick one of these.<br/>
 Yeah, but it looked like he spent a month's rent on bringing up groceries.
 He brought you everything.<br/>
 I still don't know why anybody eats Monster Munch.
 It's revolting.<br/>
 You take those words back, young lady.
 I saw a vanity fair video where Emily Blunt and James McAvoy, the actors, were talking
 about a typical day in Britain and they featured Monster Munch and Marmite to two of the things
 that arrived this week. Oh yeah when I saw that come out of the bag I'm like I'm gonna have to
 ditch that somehow. Nope I'll put a link in the show notes for those of you who've never encountered
 Monster Munch and or Marmite you haven't lived in the glory realm so I'll point into a video
 where they describe it. You've said be warned. Anything else happened this week? Well I gave
 We have an update on our building project for Children's Ministry.
 So we are putting in a whole new wing for the Children's Ministry at Gray Center.
 16,000 square feet, I believe.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Double what we currently have.<br/>
 More than double.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 And it has a Children's Auditorium.<br/>
 It has, you know, just, it's just way updated.
 It's got a playroom, which with the play center is already in.
 We just, we're going for broke here with these kids and.
 That's not the clear.<br/>
 We're going for horrible expression, but you know what I mean?
 We're going for going all in.<br/>
 Um, so we're really excited.<br/>
 Everything's on its way now and we have, um, you know, all the studying up and all that kind of stuff.
 So we're doing electrical and plumbing.
 And so we're going to start to see some really tangible transformation in the next little bit.
 So it's really exciting.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 The first part of it is all planning and budgeting and filing permits and waiting and estimates and waiting and then
 I'm waiting in the last two weeks.<br/>
 They've demolished a bunch of stuff and built a bunch of stuff.
 It's amazing.<br/>
 Yeah, we had a whole bunch of people from Grayson or show up to help us demo,
 which was amazing.<br/>
 And now we're building it out.<br/>
 So that's exciting.<br/>
 Apparently we're pouring concrete tomorrow the next day.
 So I've never seen that happen live.<br/>
 So if I disappear from the school, that's where I went was to go check on that
 concrete pouring.<br/>
 I'll be holding on to my more might today and tomorrow just in case he gets.
 Oh, now that's an excellent idea.<br/>
 All right, our main topic for this week is inspired by with David Wagner speaking at
 grace on this morning, which was amazing.
 Oh my gosh, it was so good.<br/>
 It was glorious.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 But he read Isaiah 53, a passage I'm very, very familiar with.
 But I don't know why it really, really stuck in my heart this morning.
 So I've been meditating on it all day.
 It's phenomenal to think this was written nearly 700 years before Jesus came on earth.
 Yes.<br/>
 And it's a prophecy about Jesus.<br/>
 I'm going to read it to everybody.<br/>
 I'm reading it from the New Living Translation.
 This is the words of the prof Isaiah.<br/>
 He said, this is Isaiah 53,<br/>
 "Who has believed our message?<br/>
 To whom has the Lord revealed his powerful arm?
 My servant grew up in the Lord's presence
 like a tender green chute, like a root and dry ground.
 There was nothing beautiful or majestic about his appearance,
 nothing to attract us to him.<br/>
 He was despised and rejected.<br/>
 a man of sorrows acquainted with deepest grief. We turned our backs on him and looked the other way.
 He was despised and we did not care. Yet it was our weaknesses he carried. It was our sorrows
 that weighed him down, and we thought his troubles were a punishment from God, a punishment for his
 own sins. But he was pierced for our rebellion, he was crushed for our sins, he was beaten so we
 could be whole. He was whipped so we could be healed. All of us, like sheep, have strayed
 away. We have left God's path to follow our own, yet the Lord laid on him, the sins of
 us all. He was oppressed and treated harshly, yet he never said a word. He was led like
 a lamb to the slaughter, and as the sheep as silent before the shearers, he did not
 open his mouth. Unjustly condemned, he was led away. No one cared that he died without
 descendants that his life was cut short in midstream, but he was struck down for the
 rebellion of my people. He had done no wrong and had never deceived anyone, but he was
 buried like a criminal he was put in a rich man's grave. But it was the Lord's good plan
 to crush him and cause him grief. Yet when his life is made an offering for sin, he will
 have many descendants. He will enjoy a long life, and the Lord's good plan will prosper
 in his hands. When he sees all that is accomplished by his anguish, he will be satisfied. And
 because of his experience, my righteous servant will make it possible for many to be counted
 righteous, for he will bear all their sins. I will give him the honors of a victorious
 soldier because he exposed himself to death. He was counted among the rebels. He bore the sins
 of many and interceded for rebels. A powerful, powerful chapter. Seven hundred years before
 Jesus ever came to earth and before he lived his life and died his death, those words were written.
 Amazing.<br/>
 It's phenomenal.<br/>
 You know, the crucifixion of Jesus is just horrendous, like on so many levels.
 Yes.<br/>
 Like if you were to read about it in the newspaper today about a man beaten within the inch
 of his life and then, you know, he flogged and then hung on a cross and just left to
 die.<br/>
 I mean, we would be appalled.<br/>
 The trouble is we're so used to it.<br/>
 People wear the crosses jewelry.<br/>
 It doesn't really hit you what a horrifying and horrific death is.
 Right.<br/>
 And of course, as an innocent man on top of that, dying a gruesome death, a horrifying loss.
 Yes.<br/>
 But the resurrection, on the other hand, also glorious.
 Yeah.<br/>
 But the glory of his resurrection doesn't diminish the horror of his death.
 And when you think about it, the price he paid was so that we would go free.
 And I think that's what struck me this morning as David was preaching.
 He was unpacking it brilliantly.<br/>
 Yeah, he was. I loved it. There was so much that
 Even when he was just talking about how the very beginning of Genesis, he was talking about how there was darkness covered the earth,
 you know, and then and then God created light and all that kind of stuff.
 And then he was talking about when Jesus died and darkness covered the earth again.
 It was a reset.<br/>
 It was God saying, this is a do over.<br/>
 So amazing.<br/>
 I thought that was amazing.<br/>
 I'd never thought about that.<br/>
 I think.<br/>
 You know, days like today,<br/>
 that I'm so familiar with.<br/>
 And there's a danger of becoming over familiar.
 We just become not blase but we're, it's not news to us that Jesus died and gave us life.
 But it's amazing to be reminded of what happened that literally everything that we have,
 everything we preach, everything we hope for comes from the death of Jesus and the reality of his
 resurrection.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 As we read in earlier in 1 Corinthians, the Apostle Paul, he was dialoguing with a bunch of people
 who are questioning, "Yeah, did Jesus really, you know, get resurrected? Is there really a
 resurrection after we die?" And an argument that continues to this day. And he says this,
 this is 1 Corinthians 15, he says, "If our hope in Christ is only for this life,
 we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world." He's just saying, "If our relationship with Jesus
 only affects this life, if there's nothing after this life, then we're to be pitied." Because all
 all the sacrifice, all the obedience. I mean, if there's nothing after this world, we're
 doing it wrong. We're pious, sure, but we need to be, you know, living for ourselves
 right now if there's nothing else. Right. And yet that's not the truth. And he goes
 on and says this, in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead. He is the first of a
 great harvest of all who have died. So you see, just as death came into the world through
 a man, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man. Just as everyone
 dies because we all belong to Adam. Everyone who belongs to Christ will be given new life.
 But there is in order to this resurrection Christ was raised as the first of the harvest
 and all who belong to Christ will be raised when he comes back.
 Amazing. I know that's, you know, I don't want to be flippant about this.
 But I've been, you know, I've been in grief counseling for, I don't know, a couple of months.
 I'd been talking, I lost my parents, both my parents in the last two years.
 So I've been thinking about death and think, you know, I'm largely in grief counseling because
 I'm seemingly not upset. That sounds terrible. I don't mean to say that, but I'm, I'm, I don't know,
 you're never really prepared for death. But I think the glorious hope of the resurrection,
 not only of Jesus, but also of my parents, is what gives me tremendous peace. Like my whole
 life, I watch my parents live for the one they served. And now I know they're with him ahead of
 me. And they're not sick and they're having a great time. They're having a phenomenal time.
 And it's a temporary pause on our connection. So I will see them again when I do die and I'm
 resurrected with Christ. I'll see them again. So I don't think it's terrible. I'm not sad that
 that they're in heaven, of course I'm not.
 I think the great certainty of life is death in taxes
 as they say.
</p><ul>
  <li>Yes.
  </li><li>You know, dealt with taxes this week,
 but death, I'm prepared for death
 because I have a glorious hope in Jesus Christ.
 And when you come to Resurrection Sunday,
 it puts everything in perspective, I think.
  </li><li>It was really fun today as well.
 Between the two services, there's about 15 people
 that gave their lives to the Lord,
 which is really exciting.
  </li><li>Oh, my God.
 Yeah, I love it too.
 Today is a day that changes everything for them.
 It's amazing.
  </li><li>I think whenever I hear people misunderstand God,
 you know, when I hear people talk about,
 oh, you know, God is, you know, this
 or God's judging people or God's that,
 I like to remind myself,
 'cause usually I'm not in conversation with those people,
 it's just maybe comments I've read on Facebook
 or I hear on TV or an interview or whatever,
 I like to remind myself that it was God
 gave himself for us. You know, we're often in a world where people are quick to accuse God of
 injustice, but the grazed injustice is that Jesus paid for our sin. Yes. And I think, you know, when
 you read through the Gospels, it's really clear that that's why Jesus came. Listen, listen, John 11,
 this is Jesus speaking to Martha. Lazarus has just died. He's about to resurrect Lazarus from the
 dead. She doesn't know that yet and in this conversation she thinks is purely theoretical.
 And Jesus says this to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Anyone who believes in me will live
 even after dying. Everyone who lives in me and believes in me will never ever die."
 I remember being a kid.
 Conampling that verse, I remember being like MJ's age, five, six years old and just thinking,
 that is amazing that even when i die i will live.
 And so i've had that that revelation since i was a little child but i think it's phenomenal.
 It is remarkable it really is remarkable.
 I think one of the big regrets i have of my life is that.
 I like teaching i love teaching.
 And i think i'm a good teacher.
 But i wish i was a good evangelist.
 Do you know what I mean?
 Like when I teach, I see fruit from my teaching.
 Yes.
 And I find it very easy to teach and it's very natural to teach.
 And I feel the anointing of the Holy Spirit on me when I teach.
 Yeah.
 I, I wish I can see other people with that gift of evangelism on their life.
 And I'm like, Lord, I is such a simple profound truth.
 the power of Jesus' death and resurrection, I wish I could convey it as profoundly as I can,
 you know, some of the other revelations that God's given me. Do that make sense?
 Yes. Yeah.
 So here goes, you know, you'll never get better if you don't practice. If you're listening to this
 and you don't have a relationship with Jesus, it's really important to me that you know that he
 died so that you could live. David, our friend this morning was saying that Jesus didn't come to make
 bad people good. He came to make dead people live.
 Yeah, I love that.
 I know. And so the Bible says that without Jesus, we're dead in our sins. I love that
 line that we read earlier in Isaiah. All of us like sheep have straight away. We have
 left God's path to follow our own. That is quite literally the problem that we face today.
 Yeah.
 Everyone is arguing that their way is right, but everyone has left God's path. Right.
 So all the destruction, all the despair, all the horror that we see just by scrolling
 through Reddit or scrolling through BuzzFeed or you know, whatever your new sources of
 choice.
 And you just look at the calamity of the world.
 It's because all of us like sheep of straight away, we, we've left God's path and we're
 trying to figure out in our own.
 And the truth is Jesus is the way back to God.
 He's literally the path to God.
 Yes.
 And the trouble is many people like to think that all paths lead to God.
 I mean, it's so palatable.
 Yes.
 Right?
 But it's completely false.
 Yes.
 It's a huge error.
 Only Jesus Christ is the way to God.
 So if you don't have a relationship with Jesus, you're literally missing out.
 Yes.
 Like you're missing out on peace.
 You're missing out on a life where you're made right with God and an eternal thing.
 You're missing out on eternal life.
 You know, everything we talk about in the podcast from British chocolate
 and video games and Zelda and prophecy and angels and powerful communication and boundaries.
 And you know, all that sort of stuff.
 It's all good.
 None of it is important in an internal perspective.
 Right.
 Only Jesus Christ is death, his resurrection.
 And your response to those things is like I was saying earlier, I'm completely ready to die.
 I have absolute peace that if I die,
 I will live with him forever.
 We've set up stuff so that you and the kids
 are taking care of.
 I've got a glorious inheritance.
 I'm ready to die.
 I'm happy to be alive.
 I love living, but I am not.
  </li><li>You get that was the part I was waiting for.
 The other side of that coin is you want to live.
  </li><li>I do.
 I love it.
 Are you kidding me?
  </li><li>Yes, but you're not afraid of dying.
  </li><li>I'm not afraid of dying.
 I'm totally at peace with death.
 And I'm like, Lord, this is amazing.
 And I can only say that because I have a relationship with Jesus Christ.
 Yeah.
 And if you don't have a relationship with Jesus, you can have that peace and that
 promise to, and the way to do that is to pray this with me.
 So this is a prayer.
 All you have to do is repeat what I'm saying.
 And the Bible is really, really clear.
 If you, if you believe in your heart, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus
 is Lord, you'll be saved really clear.
 This is only one name under heaven by which men and women can be saved, and that's Jesus
 Christ.
 So, repeat this with me.
 Lord Jesus, I believe that you are the Son of God, that you are the Son of God, and that
 you came to earth, and that you came to earth to pay for sin, to pay for sin, the world sin,
 the world sin, but my sin, but my sin.
 I want to receive your gift of forgiveness and I want to receive your gift of forgiveness.
 I confess that I am a sinful person.
 I confess that I am a sinful person.
 I have done things wrong.
 I have done things wrong.
 I have said things wrong.
 I have said things wrong.
 I have thought things wrong.
 I have thought things wrong.
 And I'm asking you to take away my sin.
 And I'm asking you to take away my sin.
 And give me the gift of eternal life.
 And give me the gift of eternal life.
 And the gift of the wonderful Holy Spirit.
 in the gift of the wonderful Holy Spirit.
  </li><li>And I purpose in my life.
  </li><li>And I purpose in my life.
  </li><li>To follow you.
  </li><li>To follow you.
  </li><li>And to grow in love with you.
  </li><li>And to grow in love with you.
  </li><li>As your Holy Spirit empowers me.
  </li><li>As your Holy Spirit empowers me.
  </li><li>Amen. - Amen.
  </li><li>Now if you prayed that,
 and you've never prayed that before,
 I am gonna be so excited to receive an email
 from me, send us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@allonanaj.com">hello@allonanaj.com</a>.
 It's A-L-Y-N-A-N-D-A-J.com.
 because we would love to hear that.
 And if you listen to this month on the road and you think,
 "Oh, this isn't a current episode, I don't care.
 "I'd love to hear it.
 "I'd love to be able to send you something
 "to help you in your relationship with Jesus."
 And if you are saved, we haven't forgotten about you either.
 It's a glorious reminder, like meditating on Isaiah 53,
 meditating on the things we've talked about.
 It's incredible.
 Jesus said, "Anyone who believes in me will live
 "even after dying."
 And yet many Christians claim that promise,
 but they haven't even started living before they die.
 Do you know what I mean?
 I mean, Christians who look like they're baptized in vinegar.
 They're going to heaven.
  </li><li>Yeah, they have to.
 It makes me so sad.
  </li><li>But they're, I think they've put all their faith
 and expectation in the future life
 and have no expectation for the present life.
  </li><li>Yes.
  </li><li>It's important to understand that Jesus came to give us
 life and life about it.
 I remember being like that.
 I remember barely hanging on a life
 thinking, "Where's the great promise that we preach?" The reason we don't see the life
 we want is because we refuse often to give God total control. I realized in my life,
 there was, like I was like, "This far you can have, but the rest is clearly mine to manage."
 And I've realized that if I've only given God access to parts of my life, I've only ever
 experienced part of his delight. We've come to realize if we push all the poker chips to the
 center of the table. By that, I mean, when we choose to live in abandonment and obedience,
 utter satisfaction has flooded our soul.
 Yeah. And the thing is too, it's not just about him being your savior. It's about him
 being your lord, isn't it? Right. So it's not just that your eternal destination has
 changed. It has and that's amazing and we're so thankful. But he's your lord and him being
 your lord looks like he's actually calling the shots. Right. Yeah.
 So there you go.
 Whether you're saved or not saved,
 whether you have a relationship with Jesus
 or you don't, it's important that we give him our whole lives.
 Not just the Sunday Easter.
 We used to have these commercials,
 the RSPCA in the UK,
 it was a royal society for the pretension of...
  </li><li>Pretension?
  </li><li>For the prevention of cruelty to animals.
 I'm amazed I can remember the acronym.
 Wow.
 You used to have these like posters that said,
 "You know, a puppy's forever not just for Christmas."
 Yeah.
 OK.
 Right.
 And I was thinking Jesus is forever, not just for Easter.
 OK.
 Oh, very cute.
 Thanks.
 Yeah.
 Hey, would you like to listen to this question?
 No.
 I'm just far too tired and my voice is giving out.
 Your voice is going.
 All right.
