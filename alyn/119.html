<p> I live in AJ's podcast for your Monday.
 Most wonderful show is keeping up with the Joneses.
 Woman in flannel, how are you?<br/>
 I'm well, how are you, man and check?<br/>
 You're wearing the Tennessee State flag.
 Pretty much.<br/>
 Yep, the red, white and black flannel.
 Why are you wearing flannel in the middle of 90 degree weather?
 Well, it wasn't 90 degree weather.<br/>
 It's gone down.<br/>
 Praise the Lord to 82 today.<br/>
 I'm calling forth the fall.<br/>
 I don't understand what everybody wants to be in the season that's ahead of them.
 I'm just done with sweating.<br/>
 So you don't sweat though.<br/>
 I know, but I feel hot.<br/>
 And because I don't sweat, I just basically overheat and then eventually pass out.
 And so I want, I like the seasons where I don't have to worry about that.
 To be fair, I've never actually seen you pass out.
 And you're just conveniently missing when I pass out.
 The last time I was passing out I was making waffles in the heat in our kitchen.
 I was there for you passing out and I wasn't there for the waffles. How did I miss both those things?
 You went out to breakfast with like one of your little friends and left me with the kids and I
 passed out in the kitchen with only MJ downstairs and woke up with him on my back.
 That doesn't make any sense because we have air conditioning. What would the weather have to do
 I think it was the waffles.<br/>
 I think it was the heat from the wall.
 I don't know.<br/>
 There's no be blaming waffles for nothing.
 All right.<br/>
 We had a tremendous Labor Day.<br/>
 I think we mentioned last week the Ratlifts who were on the show last week,
 they stayed over with their kids.<br/>
 And it was, was it the first leap over our kids have ever had?
 It was, and it was really good.<br/>
 They were behaving like it was.<br/>
 Abigail, our eldest must be a shaper because she had made a plan of everything that was going to happen.
 Oh, like a week and a half beforehand.
 We need to do this.<br/>
 We need to eat this, mummy.<br/>
 And then we're going to do this.<br/>
 And you know what we need actually to make her plans come to fruition for the future?
 A fire pit in the backyard.<br/>
 Is that what she wanted?<br/>
 She really wanted s'mores.<br/>
 And I can't blame her with fall coming.
 Who wouldn't want s'mores?<br/>
 We're going to put a fire pit.<br/>
 We have a big backyard.<br/>
 We just need somebody who knows how to build a fire pit.
 I'm sure I can do that.<br/>
 I'll just give me a couple of minutes on YouTube so you all come up with it.
 Okay, just don't hit the sprinkler system when you're digging.
 Yeah, we got our sprinkler system working this week.
 Thanks to our valiant neighbor.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 Most of your wests.<br/>
 Did you, did you see any of them happening?
 No, because aren't they happening at like three or four in the morning?
 It's not like I'm getting up to check.
 No, but I was testing them.<br/>
 I ran through them on Saturday or I should say I stood and watched while
 Wes showed me how to get them working.
 Um, I did see them when we realized they were still on in the backyard.
 I think the kids are going to love that.
 We won't tell them, but next summer they can play running through the spring
 clear system. Try seeing that quickly.
 Well, we could just sit them in the backyard and tell them to just sit there
 and then turn them on without telling them. It'd be great.
 You're an evil woman and I love it.<br/>
 I wouldn't actually do that. That's kind of mean.
 So that was Monday.<br/>
 But funny Tuesday was our orientation for school of supernatural life.
 Another year kicking off.<br/>
 What do you think about that? Our sixth year?
 I can't believe it. I'm super excited about this school year.
 There's lots of faces that I don't know that I haven't seen other than the pictures on our walls that we've been praying for all summer.
 So it's going to be quite fun to get to know people.
 Were you proud of me that I didn't make any jokes about snake handling or drinking poison?
 Yes.<br/>
 Did you not?<br/>
 Are you sure you didn't?<br/>
 I thought they don't know me well enough to know my sense of humor.
 Give it a week.<br/>
 I'm not going to freak them out.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 And then Wednesday, new iPhones were announced.
 They were.<br/>
 New watches.<br/>
 Yes.<br/>
 I managed to pretty much successfully avoid any input from people.
 Of course, when an Apple event is on, everybody texted me, but the stuff they texted me was
 like, "Hey, new phones, did you see them?"
 And of course, a new phone for coming, so I just said, "I'm waiting for the big reveal tonight."
 But Mario is coming out for the iPhone.
 What?<br/>
 Yeah, Mario.<br/>
 I don't think I saw that part of the reveal.
 Did you hide that from me?<br/>
 No, nothing. Let's move on.<br/>
 What kind of Mario?<br/>
 Mario.<br/>
 A game that you can play one handed on your phone by Nintendo.
 It's going to be great.<br/>
 I'm going to be a widow tomorrow game on your phone now instead of threes.
 Oh, I love threes.<br/>
 If you, if people have not checked out threes for the iPhone, it's a game I
 return to all the time.<br/>
 It's so soothing.<br/>
 If you have an addictive personality and you don't want to be addicted to a game,
 don't check out threes.<br/>
 You ordered your iPhone.<br/>
 What do you want to talk about?<br/>
 My valiant efforts are ordering your iPhones.
 You are remarkable.<br/>
 Thanks.<br/>
 Thank you.<br/>
 I was hoping for a little bit more detail on that.
 Your remarkable stems from the fact that at 158, you wake up and you buy them online.
 Right, because they're announced at 12am Pacific time, which is 2am Central Standard Time.
 Yes.<br/>
 So you're right.<br/>
 I wake up, I set the alarm, I roll over and I thought, I'd order them, but by the time
 I got on about, they were a little bit late because I was waiting for them as refreshing the page.
 But I got your phone booked and bought, but mine had sold out by the time I got that about five
 minutes past midnight. I'm sad about that. Well, I'm not. They'll get them. I don't much care what,
 I was wanting the jet black, but then I realized I put mine on a case anyway. You're not even going
 to know what color is. So I'll just take whatever something plus I did mention that to you. You know,
 I did say that shiny black is going to be nice, but if it's in a case, you won't be able to.
 You did, but there was literally zero seven plus models at all.
 I think you should get a nice pink one.
 I might do. I quite like the pink.<br/>
 Yeah. I think it's a flex your masculinity.
 I'm confident my mask.<br/>
 I know you are, babe. I know.<br/>
 So mine's coming. I get to get it on Friday.
 I'm very excited. I just always get excited when there's a better camera.
 Right.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 The Lord quite kind to you.<br/>
 And there's been several times that you've had your phone before I have.
 It's true.<br/>
 I must be his favorite.<br/>
 Sorry about that, babe.<br/>
 But did you also did you see the new watches?
 I did.<br/>
 They look the same to me.<br/>
 They're identical.<br/>
 They're a tiny little bit thicker.<br/>
 Thicker.<br/>
 Just you wouldn't even notice.<br/>
 It's just like on a micron scale.<br/>
 Yeah.<br/>
 A little bit thicker, but they are they look identical to the old ones,
 except for the ceramic one,<br/>
 which is beautiful. Yeah.<br/>
 But it's ceramic and ridiculously expensive.
 Well, it's not ridiculously expensive compared to the gold ones.
 Oh, that's true. But it's ceramic.<br/>
 Like it's anyway, I guess I didn't anticipate it being like $1,000 for a
 serenity. I'm not going to bother upgrading our watches.
 No, because what they do.<br/>
 There's no point. No. Well, my watches find it tracks my steps.
 It buzzes on my wrist when my phone's ringing.
 It sends me text messages. I'm happy.<br/>
 Talk to me about the Go Conference.<br/>
 The Go Conference.<br/>
 It was fantastic.<br/>
 Um, Lyle and Allison, of course, at Legacy Nashville, we're hosting it.
 And it was my first time hearing banning Leopster live.
 So.<br/>
 And banning is the leader of Jesus culture.
 Yes.<br/>
 And he is an outstanding speaker.<br/>
 He's very engaging.<br/>
 He's a great storyteller.<br/>
 Um, he doesn't pull his punches.<br/>
 everything we like. So it was great. It was great listening to him. He made some excellent,
 very solvent points. So banning was speaking. You also heard Heidi?
 Yep. Heidi spoke last night and I went with some of my neighbors to go in here. Heidi.
 That would have been fun. Were they used to the Heidi experience? No, I kind of prepped
 them on the way there. So we were driving in and I was saying, have you ever heard Heidi
 speak before?" And they were like, "No." And I said, "Well, she might speak." I mean,
 she does have a doctorate of theology. She also might just lie on the floor or kneel or
 sing or giggle or whatever. But whatever happens, you're definitely going to feel the
 Holy Spirit. So they were super stoked. And it was really fun. They actually had all the
 kids. They brought all the kids in from children's ministry. And they were all over her like
 a rash and she loved it. So she basically spent most of the evening telling us stories,
 talking about the goodness of God and the faithfulness of God through these stories,
 and then, you know, intermittently hugging children, kissing them on the head, you know,
 answering their questions. And she was totally not distracted at all by them. I mean, she
 just, I mean, they would sort of stop and go, you know, she'd say something like, and
 then this elephant and one of them would say, I've seen an elephant, she'd stop and she'd
 be like, "Have you seen an elephant?" Well, that's very exciting. Did you like the elephant?
 You know, and I'm just like, "Okay, I love it that you're taking the time for these little kids."
 Yeah, I couldn't do it.<br/>
 Oh, no. I mean, I was really, really challenged by it. I loved it, and I felt like
 the challenge of my thing of wanting everything to be succinct. That's not the right way of saying
 it succinct. It's succinct. And just easy to follow probably takes precedent over distraction.
 And actually, she didn't see any of those kids as a distraction. Amazing. So yeah, it was
 pretty wild. Well done, Lael and Alison, you killed it. Great job and organising a conference
 for our city. Thank you for doing that for Nashville. Appreciate it. All right, our main
 topic for this evening is a topic all about personal responsibility. And it was, we were
 talking about it, it was kickstarted by someone stuff banning shared on the Thursday night.
 I wasn't there. You were there and you gave me the door to take babe. How was it? And you
 were like, I want to make everybody in the body of Christ listen to this message. I was
 like, Oh, it was that good then. It was so good. Yeah. I mean, seriously, when, when
 Go conference gets the Thursday night message up. Go listen to it. It's fantastic. But there was
 so much to process and to chew on. And it was everything I can do to stay seated and not stand
 in my chair and wave a hanky. I mean, I was just like, go, go banning. I would want to see that.
 Well, it was pretty close. I didn't have a hanky though, so I decided to stay seated.
 But yeah, it was really, really good.<br/>
 He started off by talking about the passage in Ephesians 4,
 where it talks about apostles and prophets and pastors and teachers and whatnot.
 And he's saying how they are to build up this saints and to call forth the sons of God.
 And so he started by talking about how if you read the Bible,
 everything the Bible talks about God's children as being a family.
 you know, just the language is he's a father, your children.
 Right.<br/>
 There's so much encouragement throughout scripture about being, about being sons and daughters
 and listening to your fathers and that kind of stuff.
 And so he was talking, he spent some time about talking about how God has set up the
 kingdom like a family.<br/>
 And so we're not a business, churches and a business, churches, a family.
 So then he went into some stories about what his family was like growing up and he's sort
 of from a small family and not very many external relatives kind of thing.
 And then he married his wife who was from a large family with lots of step this is and
 just, you know, extended family.<br/>
 And he started talking about Thanksgiving being his very favorite holiday because he
 would go and there'd be 25 or 30 of them all in this house.
 And as a family, you walk in and everybody has your role to play if you're all going
 to eat.<br/>
 Right.<br/>
 And so he said, "You know, the first time you go, you're a guest."
 But the next time you go, you pick up a potato peeler and you get it done.
 And so he said, "His job for the last 21 years has been peeling all of the sweet potatoes
 and all of the potatoes for all the different mashes and all that kind of stuff.
 And he kept referring back to that throughout the evening.
 Like, you know, he would talk about the whole thing of, you know, when people are frustrated
 that their leaders aren't releasing them fast enough and all they can see is the thing they
 think that they could do better or whatever.
 And he'd be like, you know, guys, at Thanksgiving, I'm not peeling potatoes, staring at grandpa
 who's carving the turkey, just thinking, one day, that shall be mine.
 I'm just thinking, you know, what we're doing this all together for one common goal.
 And so there was lots of things where he would use an example where it was like, that just
 made it real simple to be able to diagnose when people are orphaning out or when you're
 orphaning out yourself.<br/>
 Like when you're like, wow, if I really saw this as family, it'd be fine that I was
 peeling potatoes, you know?<br/>
 So it was kind of interesting.<br/>
 And then he also spent a bunch of time talking about personal responsibility, which is when
 I wanted to like stand on my chair and scream because his premise was what I wasn't there
 to help me understand.<br/>
 His premise was he thinks the biggest problem in the body of Christ is that nobody has any
 personal responsibility.<br/>
 So that we read the Bible and we want to outsource the stuff that makes us uncomfortable or might
 take some effort and we either want to outsource that to our pastors or Christian leaders or
 just anyone else rather than us being responsible.
 And he used the example of they, when they had this new puppy and they took the puppy
 to puppy training school.<br/>
 And he said, you know, two or three classes in, he realized they're not training the puppy,
 they're training me.<br/>
 And I'm saying, hang on a second, I want you to train the puppy.
 You know, I want you to, I want you to fix this problem over here for me.
 they're saying, basically, no, you're the problem.
 And so he's like, that's how we treat our Christian walk,
 is that it's the puppy and we're saying to the pastor,
 hey, fix this or make this easier for me
 or provide for me everything I need<br/>
 for this Christian walk to be easier.<br/>
 And he's just like, do it yourself.<br/>
 So he used lots of examples and he was talking about
 Jesus' culture in Sacramento.<br/>
 He's like, we keep it pretty simple.<br/>
 And he started talking about, you know,
 when people would come up to him and be like,
 hey, what are you gonna do to help me find community?
 You know, and he's like, well,<br/>
 I guess the next time somebody asks you out to dinner,
 say yes, or invite somebody to Starbucks
 or have them over at your house,<br/>
 or, you know, and they're like, no, well,
 what are you gonna provide for me?<br/>
 And he's like, but this is the problem,
 is that we all want it provided for us.
 We don't wanna effort it.<br/>
 and we actually want somebody else to take on our responsibility.
 Right.<br/>
 It's funny because in our own community, I noticed the people who have
 community are the people who built community.
 Yes, exactly.<br/>
 So we've got people in our culture who are high influencers, high
 connectors, and they have no problems finding community.
 It's so funny.<br/>
 I remember watching one of them just walk new to Emily and he just walked up to
 something's like, "Hey, I want to do life with you."
 And that made an appointment to have coffee with them that week.
 And I was like, "Oh, see, you're building community."
 I think the most outlandish example of that was
 we were running a pre-marriage course.
 What was it, 12-week-long course?
</p><ul>
  <li>Yeah.
  </li><li>And so-- - This is many years ago,
 isn't it? - Yeah, we had 11 couples in it.
 So that's 22 young adults all in the same stage of life,
 all getting ready to get married.
 Yeah.
 And we were with them for 12 weeks in a row.
 And at the end of it, we asked for their feedback.
 And they were very kind to give us feedback, yeah.
 This is what we liked, is what we didn't like.
 And the funniest piece of feedback for me was,
 I said, one of the questions we asked was,
 what could we do better?
 And they were like, it would have been nice
 to have got to know the other participants more.
 So maybe you could have hosted a meal.
 And I just sat back kind of a gas gun.
 Wait, what?
 You were all grownups.
 You were all in the same room together,
 every single week. - Every single week.
  </li><li>Any of you could have gone to any of the other of you
 and were like, "Hey, can we get dinner next week?"
  </li><li>Yeah.
  </li><li>Why were you waiting for somebody else to arrange that?
  </li><li>Yeah, and that's exactly what he's talking about,
 is that sort of thing, you know?
 I was talking with my neighbor as well,
 the day after I was kind of excited about Banning's message
 and just sort of like thinking,
 because I guess I've heard that a lot
 the last couple of years, like,
 oh well, you know, I just couldn't find community
 or whatever, and I'm thinking,
 I don't think I've ever had that problem my whole life,
 but I think that's also because if I wanted to get to know
 somebody, I'd go up and start talking to them.
 I don't know, like I don't wait, you know?
 So I was talking to one of our neighbors,
 and he was saying when he was on staff at church,
 He was always amazed at one of the things that people would say, and this is one of the things that drives me crazy anyway.
 Is, oh, is that a negative confession?
 That makes me feel aggravated.
 Is when people say, well, you know, yeah, the worship was good or whatever, but I didn't feel fed.
 And it's like, when did it stop being your responsibility to feed you?
 Right.
 You know, so I think it's definitely a problem.
 You know, one of the other examples he gave, banning gave, was that he said somebody came
 up to him and said, "Hey, you know, I led my neighbor to the Lord.
 When are you going to be starting the discipleship class?"
 And banning was like, "When are you going to be starting one in your living room?"
 Like, why is that up to me to do that for you?
 That's, you know, the Lord's actually given you a connection with this person that you
 just led to the Lord.
 It's your opportunity to actually walk out the Christian life and help the person that you just led to the Lord
 You know, so I just was really I was like, yeah
 How do we inspire people?
 To take more responsibility for their own lives and their own walks and what that looks like
 You want to become up with I don't know if I've come up with anything babe. I really don't I I
 Partially, I wonder if there's people that are built, well, and I don't know that I fully agree
 with this, but maybe there's certain seasons where people are able to take responsibility,
 and there's other seasons where because of whatever's going on, or whatever kind of
 training they've had, or whatever kind of life they've had, they haven't been able to actually
 arrive at taking responsibility for their own lives. What do you think?
 I think I have been in all parts of the story that you've been telling.
 I can remember times at church complaining that I'm not being fed because it hadn't done
 on me that I could feed myself. I think part of it felt overwhelming.
 I think the resources that we have today, there's no YouTube back when I were a lad.
 There's no YouTube, there's no podcast. You would just order cassette tapes.
 And I don't even know where to order them from.
 But once I figured that out, I, I fed myself, but I, I remember complaining that there's,
 I think we're just not very good at realizing we can sustain our own personal revival.
 That we've got the Holy Spirit.
 We've, we can come before many times we want.
 I, and I think it's human nature to want to delay growth.
 Yeah.
 By outsourcing it to somebody else.
 Well, you know, I'd be better if my doctor was this or I would be fitter if my gym was
 open more or if somebody else would make me run in the treadmill.
 Well, that's why we buy expensive gym memberships or expensive gym equipment because it has
 the illusion that we are taking responsibility without us actually having to do anything.
 You know, so we'll buy the expensive running equipment or we'll buy the gym membership
 and we feel like we've made progress towards a goal of being healthy, but our life doesn't
 change.
 just take like slimming pills or something.
 So we don't actually have to put in any effort whatsoever.
  </li><li>Or we buy nice bibles, but don't read them.
  </li><li>Right.
  </li><li>So it's, yeah, I've totally been there
 and then obviously as a leader as well,
 I'm on the receiving end of lots of people telling me,
 hey, you know what you wanna do, you know what you should do?
  </li><li>Yeah.
 And really, I don't mind when people are baby Christians
 and whatever, and they need a splint,
 they need some scaffolding to get started and to get going.
 I think it's concerning when they're 20
 and they're 20 years in or 10 years in,
 and they're still needed to be spoon fed.
 Well, I think you have a problem there.
 I think there needs to be something diagnosed.
  </li><li>I remember the change for me was when Paul Kane,
 I heard Paul Kane, who's a hero of mine say,
 "You're as close to Jesus as you choose to be."
  </li><li>Yeah, that's harsh.
  </li><li>It's so true, yeah, it's absolutely true.
  </li><li>You have as much intimacy as you want to with the Lord.
 And suddenly when the responsibility was put in my corner,
 I was like, "Oh, see, I look at all these prophets
 and just think you have an intimate walk with a Lord because you're special.
 And it's like, no, you have an intimate walk with a Lord because you've chosen
 to have an intimate walk with a Lord.
 You can have as much of him as you choose to.
 Yeah.
 And so you can just choose to have more time.
 One of the things this year that I've been purposing in my heart is I realized
 last year there's a danger that as a leader, you can spend more time putting
 in effort for other people's intimacy with a Lord than you do with your own.
 Right.
 like we can conclude, I'm spending time with you, Lord, but if the only time you're spending time with
 the Lord is on behalf of other people, you're not spending time with the Lord.
 Right.
 And I'm purposesing in my heart to not let the bled, there's a wonderful verse
 in the Old Testament where the Lord says, I'm paraphrasing here, but basically I'm anxious that
 once you get your nice house, you're going to forget me. Yeah. And with the Lord giving us this nice
 house, I'm like, Lord, I am not going to let the to do list of the stuff we have to do in the house,
 the repairs, the upgrades, the drapes, the furnishings, all the stuff, you know, because you could just
 get caught in an ever ending to do list of upgrades. Or just even unpacking. And I'm like, I actually
 don't want to sacrifice my intimacy with the Lord for any reason, not even good reasons. And as a
 As a Christian leader, you can confuse what you're doing for the Lord in replace of your
 relationship with the Lord.
 Look how busy I am.
 Look what I'm doing for you.
 And the Lord doesn't care.
 I'm sure, but actually what he wants is face to face time.
 So that's my personal responsibility.
 That's where I'm aiming on my effort in personal responsibility.
 Yeah.
 I like it.
 It's good.
 I think one of the things he sort of, when banning was speaking, he brought it background
 to as well was not just your personal responsibility, but if churches have family, how are you
 being part of the family?
 And I think, you know, often churches have difficulty getting people to volunteer for
 things or to help out with things because there's a view that certain things are maybe less
 then or well you know I just I don't have time or I don't have you know whatever
 like I'm I don't know how to do X but if you think about it in terms of a
 Thanksgiving dinner you show up and you just get involved you don't know how to
 do X you ask somebody to show you how to do X and everybody does part so that
 you can all enjoy something together I just love the analogy of that and one
 One of the things that he said at the end was there's only three people that don't help
 in this scenario.
 And he said, "The children are allowed to be children."
 Wow.
 And he said, "A guest?"
 And you're only a guest the first time you go someplace.
 And then the last person is the rude guy that sits on the couch and says, "Bring me a snack.
 I'm watching the Super Bowl while everybody else is doing something."
 He said, "That guy is just, he's the immature person in the room."
 Yeah, nobody wants to be that guy.
 Right.
 But I think that there's times where we are being that guy, where we're just saying, "Hey,
 you know what?
 Everybody else do it for me, please."
 And I'm really too tired to help or, "Hey, just bring me some popcorn and I want to do
 this thing over here."
 So I think it was a really good wake up call.
 The whole message was a lot of, it was an interesting way of looking at something that
 we often see and being able to actually call it what it is, which was really good.
 Jay Banning.
 Jay Banning.
 Go for it.
 Go Banning.
 It was really lovely.
 It was great to meet him and stuff.
 I was a really good conference.
 And then of course next week is the belongings conference.
 Come on.
 So two conferences, two weeks in a row, just super exciting.
 So we're looking forward to that.
 You ready for a listen question?
 Mm-hmm.
 This is an interesting question from Beatrice.
 She asked the question, "Not sure if this is where I'm at, but this question popped
 into my head.
 If I don't believe in healing for myself, how can I believe in healing for someone else?"
 And for context, I've been praying for healing for my hip pain for 20 years.
 I guess the first thought that comes to mind, Beatrice, is that you must believe in healing
 because you've been praying for healing for 20 years.
 So on some level, you must know that healing is possible.
 I think there's two ways of tackling that question.
 I think the first one is, if we're going to pray for the sick, we actually have to be
 convinced that God wants people healed.
 Because otherwise, if we're not sure that God wants people healed, why are we asking
 him to heal people?
 Are we playing the numbers?
 Is it like a lottery game?
 So that needs to be sorted out first.
 And we've settled that matter.
 We've done careful study, exhaustive study, and realized that Jesus, every example of
 Jesus in the Gospels, everybody who came to him looking to be healed, he healed.
 Yeah, not a single one, did he not heal?
 And what's interesting is we also know that Jesus only did what he saw his father doing.
 Yeah.
 And he only did the will of the father, so we can conclude that it was God's will to
 heal people.
 There's a number of reasons we believe that.
 Again, I've taught my head the Lord's Prayer.
 He taught us how to pray.
 This is how you should pray our Father in heaven, a halibir name.
 And then he says, "Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
 And so he's using heaven as a template for how life should be on earth.
 And in heaven, we know there's no sickness.
 We know there's no tears.
 We know there's no pain.
 So therefore, that's the standard that God is looking for here on earth.
 And then either so the Old Testament passages that the Messianic prophecies about what
 she's would do.
 So I don't want to do an exhaustive teaching on that, but absolutely believe that God wants
 to heal.
 So you have to have that settled in your heart.
 The second thing that I've noticed is I've noticed that a lot of people who believe God
 for healing, they themselves still need healing either for their loved ones or for themselves
 or for their family.
 So you think about Bill Johnson, who it's one of our great proponents of healing today.
 Well, his son Eric is deaf and we're hearing it.
 And yet they've seen deaf people get healed, but they haven't seen Eric get healed.
 I think about John Arnett, our spiritual father, watching him with really, really sore knees
 scheduled for surgery and yet seeing God use him to heal many, many other people.
 So you are not excluded from being used by God to heal other people if you yourself
 are in pain.
 And I remember a friend Ben who ultimately ended up dying from cancer.
 Even in his trips to see doctors and for treatment cancer, he would be praying for everybody
 who needed healing and seeing people get healed.
 His sermon on outreach was all on healing.
 So I think, I like what AJ said, at some level you must believe in healing Beatrice or why
 would you even come to the Lord and ask for that.
 And then the third component I think is it's often easier for us to have faith for other
 people than for ourselves.
 I think for sure.
 And there's something wonderful about in our area of need pressing in for breakthrough
 for other people in their area of need.
 And I'm not sure exactly what you're asking Beatrice, but I think you're on the right
 right path, I'm sorry that you've been in pain for 20 years.
 We'd absolutely love to pray for you in a second.
 But don't I think about the people that Jesus healed in the
 gospels, I think about the man who was born blind from birth.
 And it would have been easy for him to go well, I've been blind all
 these years, you know, I guess this is where God made me.
 This is what I guess is my lot in life.
 And yet one encounter with Jesus changed that theology.
 So I'd encourage you to strengthen yourself in the Lord, especially by what he is doing. Find
 testimonies rather than focusing on what he's not doing. I don't mean that in a chaos where I
 would hate to be in pain for 20 years. I'm not indicating that you're doing anything wrong at all.
 Just my encouragement to you is it is amazing what experience can do to your theology.
 It's amazing to me that everybody I know who is moving powerfully in healing has a theology
 that God wants to heal. And conversely, everybody who has a theology that God doesn't want to heal
 aren't seeing any healing. So get around people who heal the sick, go wherever you can and press
 in. Let's pray for Beatrice just now for him. Let's pray for anybody who's in pain. Lord,
 I thank you that you died not only for the salvation of our sins, but for the healing of our sickness.
 And right now to anybody who's listening, Lord, we speak your life. We speak resurrection life
 into bodies. We pray specifically for Beatrice for this pain that she's had for 20 years,
 and we command that pain to go, and we command your will be done in her hip as it would be in
 heaven. But I thank you that you're so kind and you're so generous and you love to heal,
 and I ask that you would extend your healing power to Beatrice and to all who are listening
 to this podcast. Their radical healings would take place right now, and lives would be changed
 In Jesus name. Amen.
  </li><li>Amen.
  </li><li>All right, as as you mentioned,
 our friends Alex and Henry Sealy are hosting
 the Belonging Conference, this coming weekend in Nashville.
 It's gonna be an exciting time.
 We're just thrilled that all these churches
 are throwing conferences to bless our city.
 It's amazing.

 And next month in October,
 we've got our own Heaven Declares Conference
 happening at Grace Center.
 Also, starting Tuesday, September 13th, we'll be accepting Apple Pay on our website to purchase
 any books or products from your iPhone. I know that's going to be cool.
 That is very cool. So if you have a touch ID phone and you're using Apple Pay at Whole Foods or
 wherever, soon you'll be able to make purchases on the web using Apple Pay. It means you don't have
 to put into credit card details. Everything's secured. That's so cool. I know. And starting
 Tuesday, if you buy any products off our website, you've got the option of using Apple Pay at checkout.
 and in about another week's time when everybody upgrades to OS Sierra, Mac OS Sierra, the new
 desktop operating system for Apple laptops, you will be able to use that for your desktop browser
 too. If you want show notes for this week, head to allen and AJ.com/119. And if you've got any
 questions for us that you would like us to answer or just talk about as an episode topic,
 go to allen and AJ.com/ask. Hey, I just want to lastly thank those of you that have been
 stopping us as we've seen you at different conferences or, you know, in the factory or whatever and just saying hi and letting us know that you're listening.
 It's so fun to be able to get to put a face to some of the people that we're talking to that we have no idea who you are and
 be able to actually meet you in person. So thanks for stopping us. It's fantastic. Yeah, and thanks for listening.
 We so appreciate that you've got a choice of
 who to listen to every week and we just love it that you choose to listen to our ramblings every week. Mm-hmm.
 Have a great week.
